Electricity, gas, water are necessities.    If there are increases in the necessities, then luxury items go first or rent is increased(and paid in full on time.      Kick him out.  He knows he has it good where he is because you are not coming down on him hard.   If he ain't going make it a police matter.  Rape accusations seem to go somewhere quickly.         Dump his stuff out the door.          ( I have seen landlords  that will hold and auction off the stuff) to recoup part of their lossess.       I am betting that he has not paid a damage deposit either so he loses nothing.   He is just inconvenienced by this turn of events.      You are the one legally responsible to pay the bills otherwise the utility companies can sieze your property(car) and auction it off to recoup their money.(read your agreement(fine print)).    This is business.|`|xnsU60hhaa	You have done absolutely nothing wrong. He has no business telling you which bill to pay! His responsibility is to PAY rent, ALL of it, when it is due. The bills are in YOUR name which makes them YOUR business, not his. Give him an eviction notice along with a notice telling him how much he owes you. And if he isn't paid in full, take him to small claims court.|`|AA10819407	Sounds like the renter from hell..  Raise the rent again...(read link about this below)     Here is a link on renting without a lease..     Good luck on getting him out, get the legalities, the pros and cons from a legal point before you do this again..On some instances I have seen a bad renter have more rights than the one doing the renting...    edit: also be careful about family you invite to stay with you, the police told us at one point that since we invited him in OUR HOME it was also considered his residence...  Lucky for us a bit of persistant family persuasion got him out.  Nightmare....If you think about it, make sure you remember when you told him when you wanted him out.  Write him a note with this date, that way you won't have to start the new 30 days...Make copies, see if you need it notarized.(The court house)This is called the school of hard knocks..So sorry you are going through this...make sure someone has your back to be safe around this guy.

Wait until he is out of the house, then leave his crap outside and make sure you have the lock changed as well.  EDIT: You CAN do it; it is your house! And you do NOT have to see him if you throw all his crap outside, that's what I did! I did the exact same thing to this one guy I hated, I waited until he left then put all his crap outside with a note telling him he was out and to stay out, then I changed the lock on the door. He yelled all this stuff through the window until I told him I would call the police if he said one more word. He left!|`|OXNiEDROaa	Your roomie pays you....to compensate for the bills.

ktCFG0tMaa	Um, you should probably tell him something like "I find your Feminine side more attractive then your masculine side". Very unique situation by the way.|`|SaQ5d420aa	You are entitled to have your own turn-ons, fetishes, and partiality of what you want in a lover.  And just because you find someone attractive you don't have to "do him" or even let him do you.  A healthy relationship is based on more than just long hair, or how well a dress fits over a guy's hips.   If it is not appropriate for him to be wearing a dress while you two are running the streets on your bikes, then you either need a new friend for that activity or get over trying to control what this friend looks like when he is with you.    As for the drag --- just tell him he looks good in drag and ask him to go out to dinner and show with you. a real date.  And it does not have to end in the sack unless BOTH of you want that to happen.  Otherwise you are just being a whore.|`|vKvNDPbDaa	im sure if you tell him how hot you find him in drag.  don't say u don't think he's not as cute when he's not.  maybe he will want to please you and dress the way you find him more desireable.

Se puder, eu irei assitir a esse programa!<br>  <br>  Acho bacana que uma emissora de TV se interesse por mostrar a vida dos gays como realmente é. <br>  N?o acho que mostrar a realidade dos gays na TV seja um incentivo ao homossexualismo. A sexualidade é algo que está presente no íntimo de cada um de nós. Uma pessoa que realmente é heterossexual n?o vai se tornar gay por causa de um programa de TV. O máximo que pode acontecer é um gay se sentir encorajado a assumir sua homossexualidade, o que é muioto bom, pois ninguém merece ficar escondendo sua realidade dos outros pelo resto da vida.<br>  <br>  A Record está de parabéns por tomar essa iniciativa!

N?o acho que ele seja obrigado a ficar com alguma mulher da qual ele n?o gosta só para provar pros outros que ele n?o é gay. Além disso, pode ser que ele tenha namorada, mas n?o tenha se casado com ela por n?o querer ter um relacionamento sério.<br>  Eu também n?o acho que o Professor Pasquale chame tanta a aten??o assim.

bxGaaErDaa	Fabiane, seu texto traduz verdadeiramnete o que é o amor.Bem, como a idéia era trocar textos..rs..eu escolhi esse de uma autora que eu amo, a Martha Medeiros. Eu n?o sei se vc conhece os textos dela, mas posso adiantar que todas as mensagens neles s?o lindas.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  >>>>>>>>>>>>>A PRINCíPIO<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<br>  <br>  <br>  A princípio, bastaria ter saúde, dinheiro e amor, o que já é um pacote louvável, mas nossos desejos s?o ainda mais complexos.N?o basta que a gente esteja sem febre: queremos, além de saúde, ser magérrimos, sarados, irresistíveis. Dinheiro? N?o basta termos para pagar o aluguel, a comida e o cinema: queremos a piscina olímpica e uma temporada num spa cinco estrelas. E quanto ao amor? Ah, o amor...n?o basta termos alguém com quem podemos conversar, dividir uma pizza e fazer sexo de vez em quando. Isso é pensar pequeno: queremos AMOR, todinho maiúsculo. Queremos estar visceralmente apaixonados, queremos ser surpreendidos por declara??es e presentes inesperados, queremos jantar à luz de velas de segunda a domingo, queremos sexo selvagem e diário, queremos ser felizes assim e n?o de outro jeito. é o que dá ver tanta televis?o. Simplesmente esquecemos de tentar ser felizes de uma forma mais realista.<br>  Ter um parceiro constante, pode ou n?o, ser sin?nimo de felicidade. Você pode ser feliz sózinha(o), feliz com uns romances ocasionais, feliz com um parceiro(a), feliz sem nenhum. N?o existe amor minúsculo, principalmente quando se trata de amor-próprio. <br>  <br>  <br>  Dinheiro é uma ben??o. Quem tem, precisa aproveitá-lo, gastá-lo, usufruí-lo. N?o perder tempo juntando, juntando, juntando. Apenas o suficiente para se sentir seguro, mas n?o aprisionado. E se a gente tem pouco, é com este pouco que vai tentar segurar a onda, buscando coisas que saiam de gra?a, como um pouco de humor, um pouco de fé e um pouco de criatividade. Ser feliz de uma forma realista é fazer o possível e aceitar o improvável. Fazer exercícios sem almejar passarelas, trabalhar sem almejar o estrelato, amar sem almejar o eterno. Olhe para o relógio: hora de acordar. é importante pensar-se ao extremo, buscar lá dentro oque nos mobiliza, instiga e conduz mas sem exigir-se demais. A vida n?o é um jogo onde só quem testa seus limites é que leva o prêmio. N?o sejamos vítimas ingênuas desta tal competitividade. Se a meta está alta demais, reduza-a. Se você n?o está de acordo com as regras, demita-se. Invente seu próprio jogo. Fa?a o que for necessário para ser feliz. Mas n?o se esque?a que a felicidade é um sentimento simples, você pode encontrá-la e deixá-la ir embora por n?o perceber sua simplicidade. Ela transmite paz e n?o sentimentos fortes, que nos atormenta e provoca inquietude no nosso cora??o. Isso pode ser alegria, paix?o, entusiasmo, mas n?o felicidade...<br>  <br>  <br>  "O tempo n?o pára! Só a saudade é que faz as coisas pararem no tempo..."<br>  <br>  <br>  _____________________________Beijinhos...|`|gxT2aHrFaa	Amei!<br>  Pura verdade.<br>  Por que tentar explicar algo t?o sublime e que foge a nossa raz?o?<br>  Alias, se a raz?o explicasse, n?o seria amor!<br>  <br>  Ent?o: amemos sem pudor!<br>  xD|`|qxI050PBaa	Verdade, interessante!<br>  <br>  Valew pelo texto!|`|RIJrxRdlaa	muito lindo parabéns pelo seu bom gosto.<br>  vou deixar um aqui pra vc.<br>  <br>  Meus pensamentos descompassados, assim como meu cora??o, dan??m fora do ritimo. E me tranco aqui dentro e pelas janelas de minha alma eu vejo o mundoo, girando, girando, giraando como uma roda gigante. Que muitas vezes emperra lá no alto me impedindo de descer!<br>  E sem regularidade, hora ou momento meus sentimentos explodem me transformando em uma metamorfose. Tem dias em que meu cora??o bate t?o forte que chega a doer, maas eu n?o sei o porquê ... Por medo ?? poode ser ... Por ansiedade?? poode ser ... Por felicidade?? poode ser .. Por amor ?? Será ? o amoor n?o deveria nos deixar mais leve? O amor n?o nos serviria para deixar mais contentes, paraa melhoorar nossas vidas ?<br>  Mas s?o taantas as pessas que despertam-nos sentimentos, sem a inten??o de alimenta-los posteriormente. Oque vamos fazer com tais pessoas mal intencionadas? Que só nos fazem vir mais e mais para dentro de nós mesmoos, enquanto o que deveriams fazer é sair, levantarmos perante o mal do mundo e gritar que estamos cansados..., cansados com a banaliza??o do EU TE AMO, cansados de sermos tratados diferentes só por acreditarmos em um mundo melhor, cansados da maldade das pessoas.E quem sabe se nos juntarmos e mostrarmos que estamos descontentes, o mundo n?o poossa melhorar ? E quem sabe com um mundo melhor eu n?o possa entender o que se passa dentro de mim .

Por que deixaram sua marca. E isso ninguém apaga.  N?o se esquece um amor arrumando outro, se esse está vivo dentro de nós. O amor que conhe?o n?o se acaba assim. Aquele verdadeiro. Podemos sim, tentar escondê-lo dentro de nosso cora??o se isso for possível. Em um cantinho oculto, mas mesmo assim, saberemos que está lá. Pronto pra explodir. Explodir de saudade. Doces lembran?as de ótimos momentos. De carinhos e beijos. Músicas e vinhos. Conversas e risadas. Companheirismo e afinidades. M?os dadas e abra?os. De sentir saudades de nós. Dizem que o tempo ajuda resolver. Para mim pode passar um dia, semanas, meses. A cada início de ano será inevitável n?o lembrar. O amor impossível para muitos, mas n?o para duas pessoas que acreditaram. E Realizaram. Em um momento algo os distraíram. E uma acredita que caminhar sozinha é melhor. E seguem, cada um no seu. Caminhos paralelos que n?o se cruzaram mais. Assim eles pensam que seja. Mas isso somente o amanh? que pode ser daqui uma semana ou uma década poderá confirmar. Eles estavam certos? O amor se verdadeiro e recíproco irá justificar uma vida ! Amor que  resistiu as cicatrizes deixadas,<br>  amor em sua mais pura essência.<br>  Amar...<br>

Mzlv282oaa	A tradi??o dos antigos conquistadores, desde a prehistória, era a de destruir os totens, locais de cultos, símbolos de cren?as e supersti??es no sobrenatural, das quais se originariam as religi?es arcaicas. Tais religi?es, a princípio, foram politeístas, complicadas, com deuses cruéis e também inventados pelos beneficiários da ignorancia humana: os cham?s que se transformariam em adivinhos, em curadores, em profetas até chegar a sacerdotes e criar oferendas, sacrifícios, holocaustos, dízimos, indulgências etc.<br>  <br>  N?o há como determinar qual seria a primeira religi?o que surgiu na face da Terra. A Terra tem de 4 a 5 bilh?es de anos e a vida tem 2 ou 3 bilh?es de anos. Os seres unicelulares foram evoluindo até alcan?arem a condi??o de primatas, de onde sairiam os símios e os homens, duas espécies totalmente diferentes, ligadas a um passado remotíssimo mas comum a ambos. Há registros fósseis (Lucy, na Etiópia) que apontam para sete ou mais milh?es de anos, e registros arqueológicos em Atapuerca, Burgos, Espanha, onde se encontram vestígios de que seres humanos já fabricavam ferramentas para fabricar outras ferramentas, armas e utensílios domésticos, há um milh?o de anos (dez mil séculos). é impossível afirmar quais seriam as supersti??es da época, mas se ainda hoje há tantas supersti??es, podemos imaginar como seria naquele tempo. <br>  Sociólogos costumam comparar as religi?es das tribos que se conservam em estado primitivo, como a dos Dogons do Mali, na áfrica, ou das tribus totêmicas da Austrália e até mesmo dos indígenas norte-americanos, mais recentes, para formar uma idéia de como seriam as cren?as dos nossos remotos antepassados.<br>  <br>  Só no tempo de Alexandre Magno (século IV), discípulo de Aristóteles,  seus exércitos levavam na vanguarda sábios e escribas que reuniam e conservavam as tradi??es religiosas orais e escritas das tribos e povos analfabetos. A idéia de Alexandre era criar uma religi?o simples e fácil de entender, baseada nas tradi??es comuns dos conquistados para facilitar o domínio sobre eles. Seu objetivo foi em parte alcan?ado, depois de sua morte, com a reda??o da LXX-Septuaginta, base para as três religi?es "dos livros", judaica, crist? e islamica. Estudiosos mais profundos e sérios opinam que a influência dos deuses egípcios e seus sacerdotes pode ser notada nas escrituras. O monoteísmo adotado por Moisés teria origem no deus Aten, criado por Amenofis III (depois Akhenaten) para deter a má influência dos sacerdotes de muitos deuses sobre o seu governo. E em Roma, os sabidíssimos pontífices, todos patrícios, das muitas seitas anteriores ao nascimento de Jesus Cristo, também aproveitaram a Septuaginta para desenvolver a nova religi?o monoteísta com que se salvaram do ostracismo imposto pelos Césares, o Cristianismo,  pregado como única religi?o verdadeira logo após Constantino I aceitar o apoio dos crist?os nas lutas contra Maxêncio e Licinio. A for?a militar romana e a inteligência dos pontífices sob a lideran?a do Pontifex Maximus criariam a maior e mais poderosa organiza??o religiosa, política e econ?mica da história da humanidade em todos os tempos: a Igreja Católica Apostólica Romana, a que sabe das coisas.<br>  As outras religi?es, seus sacerdotes e crentes que n?o se converteram foram eliminados da face da Terra, com excess?o da religi?o judaica, necessária para dar legitimidade ao mito crist?o, e à religi?o islamica, que surgiu no século VIII, impulsionada pelo fantástico e genial Maomé′.|`|OoJxIdgtaa	N?o tem saber qual foi a primeira religi?o, pois pense, uma religi?o  forma-se a partir do momento que acreditamos em um deus?<br>  ou quando surgiu o primeiro profeta (cristo, maomé, buda..)?<br>  Eu acredito que a partir do momento que acreditamos em ser superior (Deus) e come?amos a reverencia-lo, pronto formou-se uma religi?o.<br>  Ent?o levando em conta isto, imagina na época das cavernas, os primeiros Homo Sapien, reverenciava o trov?o (que mais tarde tornou-se na mitologia Zeus) assim se pensarmos como você, nosso deus é o Trov?o?|`|uRVgFnE4aa	acredito que seja a catolica apostolica romana|`|eJ41yL2maa	Das atuais religi?es Ana C respondeu corretamente foram os Vedas(base do Induismo)s?o mil anos mais antigos que os escritos judaicos e também se remontam milénios de tradi??es passadas oralmente.<br>  Suponho que as primeiras religi?es sejam sobre a natureza e seus fenómenos inexplicaveis(Trov?o, fogo, chuva etc) logo vieram as baseadas em astronomia(estrelas, sol, lua, etc) e por último as de deuses a nossa imagem e semelhanza.<br>  Logicamente crentes v?o dizer que seus deuses s?o melhores e únicos, v?o ignorar que o cristianismo é um agregado a religi?o judaica e que na regi?o até hoje quase ninguem acredita em Cristo, a maioria continua sendo judaica ou se converteram para o Islam|`|ChX932z0aa	Ateísmo, porque os primeiro hominídeos n?o tinham um Deus.<br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  E religi?o significar ter contato com Deus mas n?o precisa ser o Deus bíblico e sim o universo, talvez o Sol mas como eles n?o tinham tanto conhecimento acho que o Deus deles eram eles mesmo.|`|2eIjjGPtaa	Se essa quest?o for uma daquelas que motivam as "briguinhas" entre religiosos, digo o seguinte: isso já está cansando!

Com a vinda de Jesus, um novo pequeno povo é levantado, a Igreja Apostólica, a partir dos doze discípulos de Cristo). E assim será até o fim do mundo. Hoje Deus ainda tem uma pequeno povo fiel que irá anunciar:" Sai dela Povo meu" (da Babilonia), (Apoc. 18:4). Estes s?o os fiéis de Deus espalhados por todas as denomina??es apostatadas deste século. E Deus vai juntar estes dispersos para formar um só povo, com um só Pastor (Jesus). (Jo?o 10:16 e 11:52). Está é a Igreja que Jesus virá reclamar como Seu, por ocasi?o da Sua segunda vinda, em breve.

S?o coisas distintas.<br>  Religi?o é um conjunto de preceitos sistematizados que enformam um grupo paralelo ou transversal socialmente, nacio ou transnacional que se organiza estruturalmente para fazer face a preceitos previamente estabelecidos por uma doutrina ou filosofia que lhe está na base.<br>  Assim ,os primeiros atos religiosos ter?o sido de espanto perante as for?as natuaris e de incredulidade e medo perante a morte dos individuos. Esses atos ter?o originado, através da fala e da necessiade de estrutrurar a vida dos grupos humanos,  rituais. Rituais de enterramento e/ou venera??o de mortos, rituais de endeusamento e/ou aplacagem das for?as naturais. Daí aos sacrificios humanos vai um passo, misturados com necessidades de luta entre os grupos rivais.<br>  As primeiras religi?es n?o se baseariam em cren?as mas sim em adora??es a coisas endeusada e divindades.<br>  A primeira religi?o conhecida que praticou o monoteísmo foi a egipcia, durante o reinado de um só faraó,Amenófis IV, ou Akhenaton,muito antes da judaica. Instituiu o deus Aton como a única divindade que deveria ser cultuada, sendo o próprio faraó o único representante e mediador dessa divindade.Nefertiti  era a mulher deste faraó e atingiu no Egipto uma importasncia politica e rewligiosa sewm par entre as mulheres reais. O filho de Akhenaton era Tutankhamon.<br>  O monoteismo terá sido imposto em tempo record no país, sendo construidos templos em todas as cidades num espa?o de tempo nunca antes visto gra?as a uma nova tecnica de constru??o por blocos. Os militares deveriam ter ajudado o seu faraó a reprimir os sacerdotes "desempregados".<br>  Pensa-se que Moisés (cerca de 1250 aC esteve a conduzir os judeus na travessia do deserto até cerca de 1210. O Faraó subiu ao poder em 1364 logo deveria haver ainda ecos do monoteísmo egipcio na juventude de Moisés que fora passada no Egito) terá estado em contacto com os conhecimentos deste faraó e talvez se tenha inspirado em muita da legisla??o judaica pelas medidas de Akhenaton.|`|ButNZKc7aa	Foram os Vedas.|`|bXOzxJVPaa	ha eu acho que foi a de cristo e os apostolos|`|5a44567b44e18729519a3b5e62ceded8aa	Nhanderuvu?ú é considerado Deus supremo na religi?o primitiva dos índios brasileiros que habitavam as terras tupiniquins atualmente chamadas Brasil.<br>  <br>  Os exploradores portugueses descobriram essas terras em 21 de abril de 1500 e inicialmente as nomearam ilha de Vera Cruz. Depois, verificando que n?o era possível contornar a tal da ilha, concluiram em se tratar de um imenso território o qual passou a ser chamado Terra de Santa Cruz devido à forte influência religiosa em tudo o que nomeavam em suas viagens exploratórias.

Assim ele diz:<br>  <br>  "Tup?-Cinunga ou "o trov?o", cujo reflexo luminoso é tup?beraba, ou relampago cuja voz se faz ouvir nas tempestades sua morada é o Sol.<br>  <br>  Tup? representa um ato divino, é o sopro da vida, e o homem a flauta em pé, que ganha a vida com o fluxo que por ele passa."|`|RHFGb8uWaa	Crist?.<br>  <a href="http://noticias.terra.com.br/ciencia/interna/0,,OI2937053-EI238,00-Arqueologos+encontram+igreja+crista+do+mundo.html" rel="nofollow">http://noticias.terra.com.br/ciencia/int...</a><br>  Um abra?o|`|EM2ohd0naa	Para mim, cada continente tem sua religi?o e contam a origem do homem de forma diferente.|`|Jux8Irffaa	Nenhuma....!!!<br>  <br>  Na verdade, o povo só buscava adorar a Deus sem ter que ter grupos, apenas se juntavam e o adoravam.<br>  <br>  Simples assim...!!!!<br>  <br>  bjOOO|`|507b1f8ffdc9ff8192c58c86e015cd33aa	O amor a todas as pessoas seria a religi?o ideal.
KIzPfFKxaa	Fluente meeeesmo, só português e inglês.<br>  <br>  O português porque sou brasileiro.<br>  <br>  O inglês porque sempre gostei de línguas, desde pequeno. E pela escola e o bombardeio cultural era a primeira língua estrangeira "óbvia". Hoje vivo disso, dou aulas.<br>  <br>  Me comunico razoavelmente bem em alem?o e espanhol.<br>  <br>  O alem?o comecei a estudar há uns 7 anos, mais ou menos. Queria aprender outra língua além do inglês e achava pouco desafio no espanhol. Daí resolvi ir pro alem?o que era algo completamente estranho e novo. E me apaixonei pela língua, pela cultura e pelos países. Mas fiquei nesse estuda, pára, estuda, pára... E até hoje n?o posso me considerar fluente, pois ainda penso antes de falar e cometo alguns erros gramaticais, mas entendo praticamente tudo...<br>  <br>  O espanhol foi uma briga... N?o sei porque, mas nunca quis estudá-lo, achava que já dava pra me comunicar em portunhol e tava bom demais... Só comecei a estudar quando vi que fazia diferen?a no mercado de trabalho. Hoje minha pronúncia é boa e até que n?o sou t?o ruim na gramática, mas os falsos cognatos às vezes me pegam... E dependendo do sotaque n?o entendo nada.<br>  <br>  Agora o inusitado, o japonês e o chinês.<br>  <br>  O japonês eu comecei a xeretar quando era adolescente pq queria entender alguns jogos de video-game. Mas nunca dei muita importancia. Cheguei até a estudar, mas abandonei de tal forma que esqueci tudo. Agora t? retomando e surpreso como as coisas v?o voltando. Mas t? no básico do básico do básico.<br>  <br>  O chinês é totalmente por motivo profissional. Estou dando aulas de português para uma chinesa que n?o fala inglês. E aí o bicho tá pegando. Mas t? horrorizado... hahaha... é a língua mais difícil que já vi até agora...|`|awEVvfSnaa	Afora o Português falo outros 8 idiomas isto significa que posso me comunicar com cidad?es de 133 países em suas respectivas linguas oficiais ou a segundas ( Isto de acordo com a ONU) Detalhe comecei estudando ainda crian?a e desenvolvi em fun??o das minhas atividades profissionais.

U7EARdCkaa	Hey C C, I'm working a 5th of Smirnoff tonight, what you got? lol|`|qXq0nmBzaa	I read unexpurgated fairy tales as a child (that means they hadn't been sanitized for little children). I found them so much more satisfying because the villains always got punished (sometimes gruesomely but that appeals to the black/white realities of younger children).<br>  <br>  So, bopping 'em on the head is my choice. It's the part that makes bloodthirsty children (and they all are, to a point!) cheer. <br>  <br>  I don't believe it creates a violent culture. I think parents do way too much to cocoon their children, much to the detriment of raising children who can handle what life dishes out. <br>  <br>  Giving children a bland, boring, germ-free existence doesn't really help them. Showing them by action and example works much better and a parent can always explain that Wile E Coyote is not real, just for silliness.<br>  <br>  BTW, here's a link to the original WB cartoon, "The Bashful Buzzard" where the bumblebee song was introduced.<br>  <a href="http://video.google.com/videosearch?hl=en&q=bringing+home+a+baby+bumble+bee&um=1&ie=UTF-8&ei=9BygScHlFpjeM5irvOIL&sa=X&oi=video_result_group&resnum=4&ct=title#" rel="nofollow">http://video.google.com/videosearch?hl=e...</a><br>  <br>  And here's a link to the current camp song words:<br>  <a href="http://bussongs.com/songs/baby_bumble_bee.php" rel="nofollow">http://bussongs.com/songs/baby_bumble_be...</a><br>  <br>  Thanks for some fun memories.|`|0ede6ed5af86402f961daba9a691dc95aa	I don't remember that song, but I do remember the bumblebee song.

"Down comes baby" "London bridges coming down"|`|X3Lp0ewMaa	Yes I have I drive a school bus and the Pre-K and Kindergarten kids sing that song. Needles to say they have changed it. But I don't think it's a bad thing and we were not bad when we were kids!! That's a sign of the times....|`|AxtRjMlGaa	Yes, I still sing it the original way. Yes, the world is a different place "Dorothy" you are not in the 30's 40's 50's 60's anymore.

I guess if we answer that question, we are dating ourselves and everyone will know about how old we are!<br>  But, I do remember it. And bopping them on the head was what we sang.

(among other things)|`|Dm9L3EdAaa	My preschool class sang "Little Rabbit Foo Foo."  The field mice got bopped on the head. I like it the old way too.|`|aN3w9WzBaa	why would little bunny foo foo be turned into a goon if he/she was just kissing them on the head?? that doesn't make any sense to me at all. i am definately sticking to the old version.  it is the parents job to teach children no violence, not cartoons<br>  louie lou|`|707gOCvbaa	Butters from South Park sings that song in various episodes. The original too. it's so fricking hilarious.And yes the world has gone mad. Happy New Year !!!!|`|nwnILcEAaa	Yes, it was very popular with the Scout troops. Nothing wrong with that song the way that it was.|`|XzLUA7ataa	Well, I remember it, too.  Our grandchildren all sing the original version.  It usually comes up when out on long drives in the car.

HfZeQR4Aaa	Hey sorry you didn't get in. You may have a 3.7 gpa, community service hours and campus involvement etc, but you need to mesh well with the sorority. It's easier for friends of sorority members to get into a sorority because they already know them. The friends have probably been to many of the parties and interests meetings. They share common interests and goals anyway. They may have a 2.8 or 3.0 gpa. It's more than grades and community service. <br>  <br>  Obviously you weren't overlooked because they did interview you. Not every African American sorority is the same.  How were you with the members before you decided you wanted to become a member? Did you talk to any of them? Attend any events? Did you befriend a member, not kiss up but really befriended a member? <br>  <br>  I knew a girl who had all the paper requirements but she didn't pledge the sorority for two years because she was rejected do to poor attitude and she had a huge chip on her shoulder. She did all of the necessary things to get in but her attitude stunk and every one on campus knew it but her. Finally, when she got her act together she was able to pledge. I am not saying that you're like this but this is just one particular case. I hope this helps.<br>  <br>  Also for the person that asked why are black sororities segregated, it was because blacks were not allowed to join white sororities. Therefore, we started our own. We don't keep other races from joining black fraternities and sororities.|`|A9EydXySaa	why  do they segregate themselves and have their own sorroty?<br>  <br>  isnt that what your ancestors faught against :[<br>  <br>  <br>  edit :  woooow. i get thumbs down for acknolodging that its segregation.<br>  <br>  really wow.lol!<br>  its cause im mexican isnt it??? its cause im light skinned mexican. <br>  i guess were not good enough for our own sorroity.<br>  :[|`|yhfG07Jtaa	I am white, and I can assure you that social sororities of both races always put connections above achievements. That's just the way it is. If you want to get into a social set, you need social connections. The same thing will hold in the corporate world, so start getting some skills. <br>  "I'm hoping to get on with GE, doesn't your uncle work there? Can I talk to him?" "I'm hoping to get into AKA, isn't your aunt a soror? Can I talk to her?"<br>  Remember, it's not what you know or what you do, but it's "who you let see you do it." [Etta James]|`|11ISiUJbaa	I noticed  the answer  about making social connections  in the corporate world to get ahead.  Getting ahead in a lot of companies is like smoking dope - you have to suck up big to get high|`|BmOs3tOsaa	Its a joke. If you had a WHITE ONLY sorority it would be considered racist.
KTKxrP7naa	There is an English subjunctive but it's not used very often.<br>  <br>  It's used with verbs and noun of 1) requests, 2) necessity, 3) urging. The subjunctive is the bare form of the verb (the infinitive but without the "to"). There's no past, present or future.<br>  <br>  I request that he come earlier.<br>  I requested that he come earlier.<br>  I made a request that he come earlier.<br>  <br>  She urged that he explain things more clearly.<br>  She will urged that he explain things more clearly.<br>  <br>  It's necessary that she write down every thing.<br>  It was necessary that she write down every thing.|`|I2Tw4zOAaa	The correct grammar would be<br>  <br>  I want that he BECOMES doctor (still awkward)<br>  It's better that he DOES it.<br>  It's necessary that she LEAVES. <br>  <br>  Unlike spanish or french English does not have a subjunctive tense. <br>  In spanish  Quiero que él sea un médico  it is necessary, but in english it does not actually exist.  English is very annoying, it takes time to learn what sounds awkward.|`|26ZLytX9aa	It should be:<br>  <br>  I want him to be a doctor<br>  It's better if he does it<br>  It's necessary that she leaves<br>  <br>  And yes, it would definitely catch the reader's eye if you used the Spanish and French subjunctive, so be careful!|`|2ZGEqEJXaa	..."I want him to be a doctor"<br>     "It's better if he does it."<br>     "It's necessary that she leaves."<br>  <br>  There is not an equivalent to French or Spanish subjunctive.|`|5ULJZsqpaa	Those three sentences are all incorrect/ awkward English.<br>  <br>  I'll just write a pile of alternatives<br>  <br>  I want him to be a be a doctor<br>  I hope that he becomes a doctor<br>  I want him to become a doctor<br>  <br>  It's better for him to do it<br>  It's better that he does it<br>  <br>  It's necessary that she leaves<br>  She needs to leave<br>  She has to leave<br>  <br>  <br>  These sentences are all natural spoken English. But with the last sentence, I personally would prefer to leave the word "necessary" out altogether, and choose one of the others. However it may still be the better option depending on the context you're writing it in. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps :)|`|aSTmFCiBaa	spanish=yo quiero que el sea(es) doctor,french=je veux qui'l sois (est) ..docteur,,,the changes to subjunctive are orthographic,,that is,the letters of that tense are slightly different, with the declarative verb in parentheses but emphasis is not made by capitalizing the subjunctive verb,,tho this does make sense ,it's not customary,,,,,in english,,,I want him to be a doctor,,,I want him to do it.As you wrote the sentences they are correct|`|98XPkvSqaa	The first example is not quite correct.  It should be: I want that he be a doctor. The other two are correct as you have written them.<br>  <br>  What I found is that if you are writing a paper for an English class, you had better use the subjunctive when it's called for.   For other subjects, ya pays yur money and ya takes yur cherce.  English teachers will watch every word and every comma.  Teachers of other subjects are more interested in what you say about the subject than how you say it.  But, to be on the safe side, it's probably better to use the subjunctive if it's called for.  At least then you can always argue that that's the right way to say it, although admittedly most people don't understand the English subjunctive anymore.

Sorry, but get over it.|`|3r252UIRaa	That's odd. I love Asian people and culture. I can't wait until I'm an Asian again in a future life. Sometimes I even wish I was Asian!

The ones like you need to take pride in yourself and your heritage.

I see too many Asian people especially who lack pride and respect for their heritage and it seriously makes me sick. Don't let no one get you down for being you. Who else are you gonna be?

h07uBpjNaa	The fact that you wrote the question tells me that you already know the answer. Just compare the description of how you felt when you were living a righteous life with how you feel now. Your boyfriend is using you. You're giving away your most precious gift for free--no commitment, no strings. The power has been sucked out of your life because you cut your connection to the power. <br>  <br>  Sin is anything that gets between us and God. You have described a lifestyle where you have put at least a few things between you.<br>  <br>  If you really want to reclaim your power, there is good news. God is the God of second chances. He's given me a BUNCH of second chances! Ha! But seriously, God is anxiously waiting for you to return to Him. To get your power back, you'll need to be strong. You'll need to stop living with your boyfriend, stop having sex before marriage, and find some new friends. You need a boyfriend who will lead you to church, who will help you grow spiritually, with whom you can have the closest kind of spiritual intimacy. You need friends who will help you to learn to have fun without the booze.<br>  <br>  The best place to get all that is a good Bible-believing, Jesus-glorifying local church.<br>  <br>  I will pray for you after I send this answer. Sincere best wishes are coming your way.|`|zM327P5Taa	You are a human being, and before you were just praying to your imaginary friend.

REPENT!|`|cebad5b46077e5b2866e0817f2c2e8caaa	If you are sincere about wanting to return to having God in your life and receiving holy spirit, then you must stop doing the activities that are blocking that.  You need to repent of your actions which means to stop practicing them and resolve matters and ask for forgiveness for making wrong choices.  <br>  <br>  We are all imperfect and we make mistakes.  Even King David had an affair with a married woman and then conspired to have her husband killed.  Manasseh led an entire nation into false worship.  Your life course doesn't even compare to theirs.  The key is that they realized their wrong course and stopped it.  They sought forgiveness from God and moved forward in pursuing a righteous course.  That is what God looks for.  Not WHAT you did, but how you behave after the fact.  If you could never care less and want to live that kind of life until you die, he gives you that right.  But in order to receive his gifts, you must do things that benefit yourself, mentally, emotionally and spiritually.  He gives us those tools to do so, we just have to choose to use them.|`|9BeUbORtaa	Backsliding is second only to waterboarding in my list of favourite religious sports.|`|ehBPus3Zaa	When you go to church and feel guilty, that is the Holy Spirit trying to convict you enough so you will repent and start to do what you KNOW is right. Thank God, all we need to do is pray and ask Him to forgive us for doing the sins, He will forgive us when He sees true repentance. Being sorry for your sin requires you to turn from it and not do it again. Somewhere along the line, you started compromising your principles and you need to be stronger and get back to how you know God wants you to live. (you can't do the same things as the world does, because they think sin is fun and sometimes it is. But the consequences of that sin will pull us away from God and the devil uses anything he can to make us think that God doesn't care or we have sinned too much for God to love us. His love is unconditional in that He loves us no matter what we do. He hates sin, but He loves the sinner.|`|29X6EEsKaa	No offense, but if your literally seeing God that's not healthy.

This is the fate of man, to know sin and then to make a conscious choice if they want to continue to dwell in sin, or they want to let God become someone who will lead them to a better life and understanding of why they are created.<br>  <br>  You will sin, and you more than likely will love it. The flesh is very deceptive, yet without spiritual discipline those fairy tales are just the beginning before the nightmares invade. <br>  <br>  Get back to the Lord when you are able, and stop the sinning. You wont regret it. When your boyfriend cheats on you, when you get into a car accident because of drinking and driving etc. God is very intelligent, and should not be second guessed. Sin is here for a reason, you must learn that reason for yourself. Read the word.

Most girls experience same-sex attractions during adolescence, but that has no bearing on what will ultimately become their sexual orientation.<br>  <br>  Television and movies have made it fashionable for girls to label themselves bisexual and "dabble" in same-sex relationships, even though most girls who do are straight.  Some are doing it because it's considered cool and others mistakenly assume they're bisexual because they don't realize the attractions are usually temporary and end when hormone levels settle at normal levels.  If you attend your 10-year class reunion, you'll find that virtually everyone who identified as bisexual in high school grew up to be happily heterosexual (10% will be gay, statistically).  The hipness of "playing lesbian" actually makes life harder for kids who are struggling to accept their genuine homosexuality.  For them, sexual orientation isn't something they can wear for a while and then discard when it's no longer in style.  Very often, they're used by peers who want to satisfy their curiosity or test their own boundaries without the risk of being labeled gay.<br>  <br>  A lot of people will tell you to experiment with both guys and girls and then decide your orientation, but that's bad advice.  Any human can enjoy physical stimulation from another person, male or female, and it has no bearing on sexual orientation.  A gay man doesn't turn bisexual or straight if he has sex with a woman any more than a lesbian turns bisexual or straight from sleeping with a man.  The acts are just acts and anyone can do them and enjoy them.  Sexual orientation is as innate to someone as eye color or musical talent and nobody gets to "decide" what it is.  That's why there are so many people who call themselves bisexual in high school, but very few who don't identify as straight or gay once they're in their 20s or older.  Most bisexual kids are actually straight or gay, but haven't waited to find out what their true orientation is.<br>  <br>  Don't stick yourself with a label, since the odds are huge it won't apply to you in a few years.  I have a friend who announced she was bisexual at 15 because she was attracted to other girls.  By the time she entered college, she knew she was straight.  More than a decade later, there are still people who won't let her forget that she came to a stupid and wrong conclusion when she was a confused kid fighting an epic battle against teenage hormones.  And she's the first to admit she never would have announced she was bisexual if it hadn't been considered cool to do so.<br>  <br>  Very often, sexual orientation doesn't make itself known until late adolescence or early adulthood.  If you've always liked guys and the attraction to girls is something that started in adolescence, odds are you're 100% straight.  You're just going through the hormonal hell that has plagued girls for centuries.  Try not to worry about it, since your sexual orientation will become clear with no action required on your part.  In a few years, you'll know exactly who you were meant to be.|`|DIj072Sqaa	You're totally not alone. This is probably the most asked question on Yahoo answers LGBT section.

Khw6v2Gcaa	Heard about the Great Flood? You are correct, we all come from Adam and Eve. Then the Flood wiped out all but Noah and his family. Well, they multiplied and many people became fearful another flood would come even though God promised He would never flood the entire earth again and showed it with the sign of a rainbow. Those fearful people started to build the tower of Babel. It was tall and they believed it would be strong enough to protect them from another flood. Well, "the Lord said, 'Indeed the people are one and they all have one language, and this is what they begin to do; nownothing that they propose to do will be withheld from them. Come, let [the Trinity] go down and there confuse their language, that they may not understand one another's speech.' So the Lord scattered them abroad from there over the face of all the eart, and they ceased builing [Babel]."<br>  <br>  By the way, evolution believers, what would happen (seeing the moon is moving slowly away from the earth) if millions of years ago and the moon was touching the earth since it would have reached where it is from the earth by the time millions of years have passed? Wouldn't we lose our gravity force or it would be screwed up because the moon was on us?|`|QHUycGFvaa	After the flood, Noah's descendants populated the earth.  They built the tower of babel so that if another world wide flood came they could go straight to heaven. God didn't like this, so he mixed up their languages and sent them every different direction possible on the earth. Soon people just multiplied and wha la!|`|mlI1YvCnaa	Most people who think that all people came from Adam and Eve,would say that they believe in adaptation, that a species can branch off as far as becoming a different race, but that they can't go so far as to become a whole new species, not what I believe but what I hear from thous who think like that.|`|cpOtr6Thaa	I don't believe in evolution but I do believe in adaptation.  As people spread out and inhabited the different parts of the globe, they adapted.

There is really no genetic differences in people to come to create any group smaller than a species.<br>  <br>  But when it comes to ethnicity and race, we judge people according to how they look, how they talk, and their religion or how they celebrate things. There is no reason for race to exist. Also, ethnicity can depend on where you grow up, so a baby from America, raised in Asia could be considered ethnically asian if he learned their culture.<br>  <br>  But from what I remember, theologians believed that all the major races were formed by one of Noah's sons. But the New World people stumped them, and that idea couldnt really state how they came to exist.|`|fpDVR5a9aa	Generally some cristians will accept micro evolution rather than macro evolution not realising that there is no such distinction in science.|`|hR3AE1ARaa	I love questions like this ! Please keep asking! All the genetic information of all the races were placed in Adam when GOD created him, what other answer is there?|`|eO2rnf7yaa	The variety of ethnicities demonstrates adaptation.  It does not provide evidence of evolution as an explanation for the origin of species.   All species have some ability to adapt over many generations.   Adaptation within species is clearly demonstrated to occur,  even though most of the actual mechanisms that give rise to adaptation are not known.  <br>  <br>  A lot of adaptation happens even withing individual living beings.   For example,  horses bred for many generations in a very warm climate will tend to have a certain length and density of hair,  but they will grow much more robust coats if moved to a much colder climate.  They will do so the very first season.   They essentially become much hairier horses,  but they don't  become polar bears.   Their species remains the same.    <br>  <br>  I am Roman Catholic.  It is my opinion,  and the teaching of The Church that the Book of Genesis stories about Creation are allegorical.  The Book is not a science text,  but it is still True.  The Truth is that God Created everything.   The Catholic Church does not claim to know exactly how or when God started His Creation.<br>  <br>  Peace be with you.|`|yHD5wVopaa	Most creationists believe in the sort of genetic drift that is the driving force of evolution. After all, genetic drift has been proven. However, Answers in Genesis and others subscribe to "super-evolution," The unfounded idea that all of our genetic differences arose from a population of eight people who clambered off Noah's Ark about 4000 years ago. The genetic acrobatics involved for the rest of the animal kingdom in this view are much worse.|`|Kz7BsZk6aa	Looks like you stumped 'em with this one...|`|fitsd4FGaa	God used different magic markers.|`|7d49ddbf3b36edeb5a77c20235621a44aa	maybe food coloring .lol|`|hZjPYyFTaa	For God's sake you are 'reflecting' on religion and don't even know that traditional Christianity accepts evolution and a whole lot of scientific theories.<br>   <br>  Fundamentalists, are not stupid but they are very loud and certainly promote the denigration or devaluation of real learning, reason, careful inquiry. Its all about irrational conservatism and anti-intellectualism for them. <br>  <br>  Most people who post here make that same erroneous assumption equating being ‘religious’ with some form of stupidity while they the non-religious as somehow intellectually superior.<br>  <br>  Now that you know that there is a difference between science and religion and that they co-exist together to glorify God. You might want to know that devout people believe in the private nature of spiritual belief, the unity of peoples, forgiveness of wrongs and helping the poor.

That ought to drive believers to work for equal rights and treatment for all.<br>  <br>  2) Hope for the future gives us courage to stand for what's right. With our future in heaven secure, we can step out boldly to help those in need, to stand up for the rights of the downtrodden, and to stand for the truth. It doesn't matter what happens to us in this life because Jesus has paved the way to heaven.<br>  <br>  3) We have an understanding of evil. The Bible teaches us about the origins and pervasiveness of evil in this world. We can live our lives with greater understanding because of this. A great example of this is the Constitution of the U.S. The founding fathers understood that mankind is evil--that's biblical. As such they built checks and balances into the foundations of our government to prevent any one part of government from becoming too powerful. A biblical view of the world tells us what will happen when men get too much power.<br>  <br>  I could go on, but I think that's enough for now...

I don't mind a drinker but wouldn't stand it if they are complete drunkards.|`|s2drWdMkaa	smokers annoy me cuz wen im breathin im breathing in there smoke.<br>  and drinkers only bug me if they're being all stupid so yeah|`|UGQ2UiSaaa	well it depends on the person whos doing it<br>  cos to be honest i dont hate either :/|`|JYXDj402aa	people do dislike alchohalics as well as smokers.

vxeMZXrgaa	~no, I dont think so. If she calls you then great; if she doesnt, then oh, well. BTW, my mom works at Starbucks. Stay away from her! LOL~|`|Hb04EISQaa	Complete bad*** move yeah.  I hope you walked it off like it was nothing.  As long as she smiled you may have her in the palm of your hand.|`|R2iCzRjsaa	I don't think you messed up, not sure she will call, but she does know you are interested.  Visit her again soon if she doesn't call, watch her body language to see if she is pissed, or receptive.  If she puts on pissy attitude, then look elsewhere, as there are many "fish in the ocean".|`|ff942327a5dfda0994d9bfa18f84cadfaa	Not ril-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-y-y--y bad...why don't you wait for the next time she works and drop off your chat name next time.  That way you can both talk--if she has chat--and laugh together and stuff like that.  If she smiled at the piece of paper, she's probably in love with you. =D<br>  <br>  She might be too shy to call you, though, so why don't make the next move too.  And also a $11 tip wouldn't hurt her.  Why $11?  Because $10 is too easy.  Anybody can pull out a 10-spot from their wallet.  But the exta dollar makes it look like you're rilly thinking and caring--and it's different.  Plus, it'll give you plenty to talk about when you guys reminisce about the tip on your first date--maybe even on your honeymoon--or your silver anniversary even.|`|qL3dGTXDaa	You could call it messing up but I would call it "caught up in the moment". At least ya got some spunk in ya. I would tell her you were taken by her great smile and you had this silly idea she would call you. Then order your latte', leave a huge tip and go. Remember, she still has your number.|`|RWgjnwl9aa	The main thing is you took a chance  hey  you never know I hope she calls you Good luck|`|PQQipirDaa	well that depends what did you order and did you leave a tip?<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit: if you didn't leave a tip she will probably think you are cheap, no call.|`|ND1nFEWSaa	not customary for a man tp give a girl his phone number rather ask her for hers<br>  <br>  you have to make another first impression, go back and talk to her|`|w2oMdHxXaa	It gets easier and less stressful to approach someone you admire. At least you did "bust a move". Ball's in her court now.|`|QMsLWrSpaa	lol they will think you were cute. So did you get a call of a text?|`|gIwe9Ctfaa	Abviously not.<br>  Only way to know is to wait for a call, ay?|`|ZYvdnIYGaa	if the chemistry is right, she'll call ya
DhgU7x0Daa	The dozens of groups and individuals seeking reparations for slavery. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reparations_for_slavery#Proposals_for_reparations" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reparations...</a>|`|VpR6qvb5aa	Well, I hear about it on yahoo answers every day. A more common variant, though, is black people that blame their problems on whites in general. It's always easier to blame somebody else for your shortcomings than it is to deal with them yourself.<br>  <br>  I also get tired of people (of any race) that insinuate that because I am white, my ancestors were slave owners, and I should somehow feel guilty. The fact is, the majority of whites immigrated to this country AFTER slavery had ended- my ancestors included.<br>  I'm not sure how us horrible white people should "confront the past", as you call it. I guess you think we should feel guilty, or something. But there is really nothing to confront.<br>  I think YOU are the one who feels guilty, and you are attempting to appease your guilt by lashing out at other white people. <br>  I hope you feel better now.|`|l2qtG4yfaa	It is funny how the person said 24/7 on Yahoo! but cannot provide an example.<br>  <br>  Along with the person who said Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton who say they are always doing it---why can't you provide an example of them doing it?|`|5akAfzB3aa	Let me start by saying, a "good" answer is subjective whether YOU like it or not.<br>  <br>  And yes I have heard it. Comes up a lot in talks about racism and oppression. And to be quite frank, I don't care what ancestors did, I don't care what happened to your ancestors. Sure, it wasn't great and I don't agree. But I didn't put anyone in shackles and no one I know, black or white was put in shackles so everyone should just bloody get over it. You included.<br>  <br>  Lots of terrible stuff happened in history, most people just accept it as history whilst others like to use it as a weapon. It's pathetic.|`|0UjFOsHkaa	I agree with Hunter. I never owned a slave, nor did my family, so why should I have guilt? On both sides of my family, my ancestors were kept as slaves, and I'm white, and don't hold a grudge against anyone. Go ahead and throw the guilt card at me, it's not gonna do much|`|5PKrR25Qaa	Its always white people whining like cry baby's about slavery..|`|6SwaWSoyaa	Tara J, it's so weird seeing you outside of the LGBT section trolling. <br>  <br>  I hear people whine about it, but I also hear others making a bigger deal of them whining about it. So I think they are both equally at fault.<br>  I personally think slavery should be viewed as something positive in the black person's mind. think about it. they are genetically strong now and it is so refreshing to look back now and compare it to modern society and to see that they aren't walking around in shackles. they aren't being beaten by some d-bag plantation owner.<br>  as a white person they should see that it is rewarding that they aren't lazy like the plantation owners, they aren't being known for so much hate, etc.<br>  sure it is mostly a situation that is outweighed by the negativity but it just shows that we can come through any struggles as a nation.|`|dyFRchmtaa	nah, darling im black myself, some black people do like to claim racism, as soon as they don't understand what they did that made them fail in some thing for example.. It does happen, but I can see what you mean how some white people will feel as soon as a black person claims racism, they say they are using the race card, whinning.. racism is something a white person is likely not going to experience, so if they make a racist claim its less going to be effective as we live in a white-dominated country. Thats why some use the WHINE card.|`|kaDuXT00aa	In the bible it says that you should judge a person by their fruit not the color of their skin or anything else.  Allot of white people don't wanna remember or take responsibility and that's a terrible thing but hating people will only destroy you hate is a weak emotion and a dangerous one.  I don't blame whites for what they did to the world or what they brainwashed other whites to believe in i pray for their forgiveness and try to be a blessing to them.  We don't have the power yet to seek justice for the dead only God can tell if we will.|`|HenWgGkFaa	It's telling that people who make that accusation use the word "whine", which carries a negative connotation. In a history class, we listened to tapes of interviews conducted in the 1930s with former slaves, and some white people in the class got angry about that. One woman talked about the slave owner who sexually abused her for years, and once his son reached adolescence, he encouraged his son to rape the woman. Some white students began making jokes about her accent at that point. They did whatever they could to obstruct learning details about this nation's racial history.|`|BmOs3tOsaa	I got 2 names for you.<br>  <br>  Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton.They are always using slavery as an excuse to shake down corporations.<br>  <br>  Also, My ancestors did not do a terrible thing like you said. They brought them over here and gave them an education,food,a place to live,and a way to earn a living. Before slaves were traded by their BLACK original slave owners in Africa they had nothing. Matter of fact look at Africa today. They still have nothing.|`|OOP6Hesyaa	My ancestors enslaved no one. Less than 1% of white Americans owned slaves. There were 262,000 free blacks pre-Civil War in the South, and 28% of them owned slaves. However our history books do not tell you this, and are hellbent on making white children ashamed to be white. You are yet another victim.|`|8ZVrAl2Zaa	Oh my God, will you just shut the **** up?<br>  YOU SHOULD GET OVER IT.<br>  No one is complaining about anything. Black AND white people don't care about that ****.You're probably some stupid 12 year old who doesn't know the real world and is trying to justify black people to look cool. Just shut the **** up. You really think white people care about what their ancestors did? Really. Think about it you dumb ****. <br>  <br>  Edit: We're angry because we're sick of idiots like you that spew bullshit like this. And I don't know why black or white people are complaining, we are now ALL equal. So shut the **** up.|`|e9ldIRQmaa	24/7 on Y!A<br>  <br>  EDIT: I don't really care what my "ancestors" did (BTW I am 4th generation immigrant from Germany), because what happened with slavery and all that was over one hundred years ago, don't you think its time we move on? NO one from that time is still alive and no one is suffering so why even whine/complain about it in the first place.<br>  <br>  oh I am so sorry for being such a disgrace to the white race! ;l<br>  <br>  Look in the mirror hunny.<br>  <br>  Oh yes! The white race is just so dumb and embarrissing according to you, Im sorry if you hate the white race so much and if you are in fact white, why havent you suicided yet?!?<br>  <br>  And my example is this question and much others.
KTKxrP7naa	The technical word would be "dysphemism". Not, it takes the "eu-" prefix (which means "good") and instead uses "dys-" (which means bad).<br>  <br>  People who say the word is oxymoron either don't understand your question or don't know the meaning of the word "oxymoron".

6ELSwKKvaa	She might be lesbian and she likes you and doesn't know how to handle it. Talk to her about it and ask her if she likes females. If she does, just tell her that you won't force her to be straight if she doesn't force you to be gay. Let her know that it just isn't your idea of a good time and if she continues to push the idea then you won't be friends anymore. She should respect your boundaries.<br>  <br>    Also, it isn't really nice to call them Ewww Lesbo. it is sort of a derogatory term and it shows your obvious lack of knowledge about homosexuals and your bias against them. Try to look into the topic more and learn about them. They are no different than any other person on the planet except they have desires for the same sex instead of the opposite sex. They are not sexually deranged or promiscuous. It is just a simple difference in who they are attracted to.|`|DIj072Sqaa	Who's to know. If you want to kiss her then just do it and see how she reacts. If she's interested in more it should be obvious.|`|w6tQEuKCaa	lol..she maybe is..and she still got the kiss..lol....but naw just ask her you knw sit her down and be like.... _____are you gay/lesbian?? and if she says she is if your a TRUE friend youll still be her friend and be there for her...or mabye she just bi-curious..i knw itll be hard to execpt if she really is but u have to be there for her|`|mxVAdEfSaa	Maybe your friend and you can do two girls and one guy at the same time you should in joy it.|`|EZyHOht7aa	She's a LESBO!|`|iwNYcerfaa	homo and lesbo are the same thing. You are the homophobe. Give her my number I'll find out.|`|d0WaYTeGaa	You'd have to ask her. Either way just let her know that it made you feel uncomfortable. Let her know that you're glad to be her friend, but you don't like girls at all, not even for experimenting or practicing. If she's your true friend she won't be offended and will still be your friend. Nobody gets hurt. If she's not a true friend then there's no loss for you.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ~~Note to everyone else. If you suck at answering questions or giving advice (though some of you it's both) stop answering questions and you might not make idiots of yourselves.~~<br>  <br>  ~~HELLO!

I'd agree with the first answer, make the kiss last. Thats really the only way that you will truly know if shes a lesbian. And thats what its called, lesbian. Not lesbo or homo.|`|SaJ0kQOTaa	Whether she is or not.. it would probably in your best interest to make it clear that you're straight and not interested in girls, not like there's anything wrong with being gay.|`|nQpGcBGdaa	IDK, but next time you two are alone and she kisses you, make the kiss last, if she cool with it, shes down|`|BmOs3tOsaa	I wish everyone would stop turning homo|`|CMUHp7vHaa	sounds like it<br>  or she could just be bi-curious<br>  dont be so mean about it though...|`|ikL5ZdfAaa	yup shes gay but dont treat her so mean|`|9RYHLTPoaa	uh i dunno ask her!|`|AehApcTEaa	she could be bi...<br>  but you should ask her...<br>  you wouldnt want to jump to conclusions,its not what a good frend would do...

JWzyUV7haa	Greetings from a Master Mason. Sir, if it is indeed that old and an heirloom, you may want to consider keeping it. I gather from your question that you are not a Mason. You may want to consider speaking with the local Masonic Lodge members about this item if you have no intention of keeping it. They may indeed be willing to purchase it for their own display. More fittingly, you would donate it and have it displayed with the history of it's owners. Since they are family members, and Masonry very much a family tradition, you may want to ask them about becoming a Mason yourself. Fine, upstanding men are always welcome.|`|F7YzHVyUaa	With your history, I'd keep it.<br>  <br>  Why the paranoia about selling it?  You can do anything you want.<br>  <br>  There isn't much you can believe on Coast to Coast AM.  You really should find a better source of information.  George Noory, Art Bell and their kooky guests are purely for entertainment.|`|ChQYiLhPaa	I kid thee not! Some guy that studies symbols in America culture was on Coast to Coast and figured out the meaning of all of them.  From symbols in government to corporate symbols, the very same evening he received legal threats from a federal judge, and various legal and death threats. "We're gonna lock you up!" to "We're gonna kick your _____" <br>  So... Seller beware, try to sell it to people in to Conspiracy Theories first.  They'll respect it more.|`|pNxuvKUOaa	You will have no problem selling it. There are a lot of History of Freemasonry books out there and they are bought and sold on Ebay and other sites with no problems at all. There are a lot of copies of this book for sale (search Bookfinder.com) and prices are down because it has been reprinted in paperback.
EzrdyxAiaa	because over the years the texans have looked at the new mexicans as step children and no one likes there step children or step mother!!!
OLL9Cdbtaa	I feel like im turning prejudiced especially towards Hispanics. I live in an area where Hispanics are the majority and I have had some racial runs ins with some of them and it makes me mad as hell that they would would even call me a names when they have names that they can be called too. I hate myself for allowing those idiots to make me feel this way, its makes me feel like im letting them win. I'm glad that you asked this question so I could get my feelings out to someone other than my parents.|`|g2JlIuRcaa	Oh yes there was a time when i used to make racist remarks and have terrible thoughts. I have tried to change my ways.  I realized how ugly it is.   I try to live by the golden rule.  treat others how you want to be treated. I am not perfect and i slip up but i try, dammit|`|5lbKGofgaa	I'm not prejudice against anyone.  But I face it all the time so I know how it feels.|`|HsT9sW5Xaa	We were all ignorant and close-minded pricks at some point in our lives. Whether or not we realized it.|`|IgHUhZs8aa	I've been brought up not to have prejudices, but I have to admit that I have a prejudice against bigots, which I find hypocrytical. Anyone who uses racial or religious slanders I mark as bigoted or prejudiced and don't even think of them as a rational human being, no matter how much depth they may actually have. Other than that, I'm proud to say that I'd give anyone a chance. ^_^|`|qcPrUL84aa	Everyone is prejudiced. EVERYONE. There's no sense arguing against that. Being prejudiced does not make you a terrible person, nor does it necessarily mean you're racist or intolerant or anything like that. I'm a very open-minded person, but I'm totally prejudiced. I look at people and make assumptions about them - based on what they wear, how they look in general, etc. It's just a natural thing to do. Someone saying that they are not prejudiced is just plain silly. It's simply not true.|`|e9ldIRQmaa	Everyone is judgmental at some point or another...|`|f4uYkNwkaa	im probably the most prejudiced person in the world lol.|`|AA11586960	we are all Prejudiced at some point in our lives <br>  <br>  there is always something we don't like<br>  <br>  take i hate the way americans spell english words wrong  and call it English why not American  that would be Honest <br>  <br>  the French in Canada are known as French Canadians  <br>  <br>  and the Mexicans speak Mexican with a Spanish background ??????
sWXrnErnaa	It's simply your minds way of dealing with everything for the day so you can get a good night sleep, a way of making peace with the world. Its easier to do because the stress of the day is gone, most of us are able to relax and chill out and we know no one is going to be calling us or wanting something, or expecting something. <br>  <br>  It sounds to be like stress may be getting to you, you need an outlet something that will assist you to unwind and de-stress. Meditation, yoga, tai chi, or something like that. If your an athletic person, swimming slow long distances has the same effect.<br>  <br>  As for being afraid of facing the problems of the day, try to deal with them better on the spot, perhaps you need some assistance, councelling or anger management etc, whatever it takes not because you have to get "well" but because you want to feel good about yourself and you have the right to that. <br>  <br>  For now to face your regrets and worries by writing a journal at night before going to bed, them you can face the night on your own terms<br>  <br>  hope that helps|`|AA10564185	sara, i know what u mean.|`|P91FugsAaa	You sound like you don't know what you want in life.  Figure out what you want, and then go for it.  When you are doing what makes you happy, you won't have any trouble making other people happy.|`|ExCAedp4aa	Perhaps you're a vampire?  Maybe you're not telling us you partake in the mad weed in the evenings? <br>  <br>  Seriously, perhaps you're just able to unwind more and put things into a different perspective, you're able to distance yourself from the hectic pace of the day which helps your mind relax.|`|X48z0Lwwaa	When your brain is at rest, it can solve problems efficiently.  When you're on the verge of falling asleep you're brain is at rest.  Think of your brain like any other organ.  It's always working.  It will process information without your directed attention.  Many great thinkers have epiphanies late at night or while lying in bed.
3zt1PPnjaa	Jack,<br>  <br>  Remember that we are all humans.If you really want to stop these unwholesome actions. The first thing you can do is just not answer the question at all. If you see a question or answer that makes you angry then remind yourself where obeying anger leads, try to be mindful of your thoughts and feelings and know that they are only that. So don't let them take advantage of you. I never answer any questions that have already been asked many times before or if the question is a joke, racist, hate, etc. So to start off you can answer the questions that only ask for help or for some understanding. Help them with your answer without attacking anyone and only answer the question. Try to cultivate patience and empathy. These two characteristics of a person go a long way.|`|s7hEvXQdaa	Don't take any questions or answers personally.  Consider that you are enlightening the seeker and aiding the education of your fellow man.  No one is expressing his opinion TO anger you and being so invested in the question/answer that you become angry doesn't SERVE you.  Bonne nuit, my brother.|`|2tn8EALqaa	Get off the site then.<br>  <br>  edit: oh wow, I almost didn't realize it was you Jack, king of Anti Racism. I soon realized you answered a troll's question (the obama one) and now that I realize it was YOU I'm really shocked by the racist answer you gave.<br>  I laughed and commented and applauded the troll on his job well done in exposing the racism that "doesn't" exist in america. Funny you were one of the people I disagreed with.<br>  You are a total hypocrite.<br>  Stop spewing your fake "i'm so peaceful" crap.<br>  <br>  There have been times in this section where three-five "i hate n words" trollls have been on here at once. Now, one fake "i hate crackers" troll is on here and whites are going berserk. Hilarious.|`|56dfvnwmaa	1st just go visit the polls and surveys section<br>  2nd realize that many people here are very PC and they take many questions about any group personally. they assume that youre talking about every person in a group as opposed to just in general<br>  3rd dont take it personally. its not worth it. after a while I realized that even though this section can be interesting, there are way too many PC people that dont even answer the questions and just criticize<br>  <br>  but best bet is to just take a break from this section altogether and block those people that ESPECIALLY piss you off|`|VpR6qvb5aa	It is because you have a low tolerance for stupidity.<br>  I suffer from the same problem, and I get frustrated with most of these people myself. Tonight, it's Kitty. I wish we could thumbs down the questions, that might help a bit.|`|VhBW7AjAaa	You'll just have to grow up and be the more mature person in the argument. If you can't do this, then perhaps it might be better if you just avoid this section completely.|`|jdKTs3aHaa	No offense but i think you just need anger management class. You're letting your anger get the best of you.|`|GPznIhzMaa	This is one of the biggest problems with this section as well as in Politics and Relationships. I've asked innocent questions before and gotten some insulting answers accusing me of being racist, ignorant, uneducated, immature. I've even gotten hate mail for my answers. The thing that worries me is that there are a lot of young kids on here asking innocent questions and I've seen them getting similar answers. People need to think twice before posting insulting answers. All the trolls make themselves known, so why attack someone who's probably on here to honestly learn about other cultures? I know that if I was a 12-year old, I would feel hurt and confused as to why people were calling me names for asking a question.<br>  <br>  You just have to keep in mind that some people take things way too personally, and there are some who are just plain angry people so they take it out online. A lot of those insults and hate mail don't even deserve a response. By responding, you're only fueling the fire and giving them the attention they seek. Next time this happens, just ignore, give them a thumbs down, block them, or report them if they have broken a community guideline.|`|M2UWOTAjaa	A certain amount of anger is normal, especially for people who passionately care about a cause. That is why I constantly ridicule the Fundies (Ridicule destroys everything," is a French proverb). I am supportive and sympathetic to those I think need such things, and I will answer the innocents who ask questions like What does 'Greek' mean in sex? <br>  By nature I'm quite confrontational. Not everybody is. You can develop tact and poise without any cost to your integrity.|`|6NEPcZFfaa	We all do the same thing. Can I recommend something to you with all respect though? Get to know some more people in this world. I have seen some of those answers and you've answered like those people I want to strangle on the street. You seem like you need to experience a few more things in life.|`|l2qtG4yfaa	Well Jack, you have some serious issues against black people. The only time I see you get angry is to bash black people.<br>  What you need to realize is that people are people, stop generalizing, stop hating, stop attacking.|`|tVUBqdSzaa	one way is to just ignore it and forget about it.<br>  another is to answer it and defend yourself but in a calm way, you don't want to come off as rude, just think about your answer and if you think it doesn't sound rude then, you're a-okay!|`|pfke6Jieaa	just simply dont answer the questions and dont insult others. unless they insulted u then it would be ok if u do that but only after they still keep abusing it and being insulting.|`|cFSpYoDfaa	Sounds like a personal problem to me that cannot be resolved by yahoo answers. A shrink maybe?|`|decWPAHkaa	Stop taking Y/A so personal and you'll be just fine.|`|3BB9drn6aa	You could try what I do: Try and think from the perspective of the other person. <br>  <br>  For example: Abortion. I personally don't agree with it, but I can see the other side of the debate. <br>  <br>  Pro life sure, but.... what if a girl is raped? Does she not have the right to an abortion? <br>  <br>  Or; I don't agree with blacks holding a grude against white people for slavery that happened over a 100 years ago, BUT, I can see their side; they had distant relatives that were inslaved and beaten by white people with nothing to show for it but scars. <br>  <br>  The most important thing for you to remember is that there is always another side. No matter how much you believe in what you believe in, they too may feel the same way. If you want to have a intelligent debate, then really try to see their point of view, and don't be upset about it. Accept their point of view, admit if they have some valid points, even if it goes against what you believe in, and most of all, don't start the name calling game. If anyone does not like another persons point of view, and they start calling names, then it usually means they have no arguement or anything intelligent to say. If that's the case, really, be the better man and tell them, " I didn't call you any names, I tried to have a open and honest debate/discussion but if you can not find anything intelligent to say other than to call names and insult me for my beliefs, than there is no point in discussing anything with you.

XxDQGEalaa	I agree....the term 'life' is vague enough in everyday 'life'. It's a propaganda tactic for insuring a direct opposition to a subject that is unclear.<br>  <br>  I have my own cause, and I call it pro-thought. Anyone who disagrees with me is obviously against thinking. Isn't that how it works?|`|f3nwI8ytaa	In a moral vacuum, language becomes a marketing tool rather than a vehicle for truth.  Both "pro-life" and "pro-choice" are jingoisms.  They communicate feeling without imparting knowledge.  You must know this. I've seen you exploit the emotive power of language often in your questions and answers here.  I admire your ability to do so.  It reveals a pretty deep grasp of the human psyche.  In a sense, all of our language has become political.  Power is the ultimate goal of social discourse today.  Some would say that's because power is the one objective truth that exists.  I disagree, but cannot deny that this assumption seems to under gird our approach to life.  <br>  <br>  peace|`|I1w0HfQbaa	Yes, I agree with you. However, it is a simple political tactic the Christian Right uses to support their cause. I would not get bent out of shape about it. If I am "pro-life" then how could anyone be against me and my policies because I support life. It effectively shuts off dissenting opinion regarding birth control, condoms, sex education in public schools, and support for useless abstinence only programs, restrictions on a woman's right to choose and a slew of reactionary programs.|`|XsTJPMHqaa	Well many pro-lifers believe they're pro-choice as well; they just see that choice as being whether or not one chooses to have sex. If you choose to, then you're saying you accept whatever may come. So we do accept choice, and isn't this implying that we're anti-choice?<br>  <br>  Why do those who are supporters of a woman's right to live still use this accusatory, fallacious language?|`|LGBNKuxRaa	I've taken to describing myself as 'pro-death' because honestly, I don't see how the labels could get any sillier|`|GQk0UNjfaa	The term 'pro life' is incorrect for those who oppose choice.|`|AA11946554	If these fools could think, they'd realize what 'life' means and they wouldn't be for taking away the rights of the actual living humans in the situation. I refer to them as anti-choice b/c, well, they are. They don't have a clue what constitutes living and even if they did, they and their imaginary friend are all for killing it off when it's of an age to disagree with them. Actually, when you read the OT, that deity is for killing them at any age based on whether they're unfortunate enough to be born at the wrong place and/or time.|`|nXxtBkguaa	Shouldn't we stop using "pro-choice"?<br>  The very term suggests people who support life are anti-choice, which is preposterous. We only believe that the woman and man had the choice of weather or not to have sex, and then the choice of weather or not to use protection.  To say that we oppose choice is prepostorous since we are in support of two choices regarding abortion begs the question (a fallacy). Why do those who are supporters of a baby's right to life still using this accusatory, fallacious language?<br>  <br>  it goes both ways pal.|`|7422ddf097669bd7b6e3d48e56258b87aa	If anything even resembling a human fetus was discovered on the planet Mars, what do you think all the newspaper headlines in the world would say?<br>  <br>  There is no scientific dispute. Only political nonsense that is shamefully and decrepitly deceptive, for the purpose of facilitating the murder of the innocent, for the convenience of others.|`|Y3Z6B7dHaa	who are you to say what a life is, or what a human is.<br>  <br>  who are your trainers to say what a life is, or what a human is.<br>  <br>  who is anyone to say what a life is, or what a human is.<br>  <br>  my point being that most cultures throughout time believe/believed in a soul, spirit, ect. you can do all the science you want. people will still believe that soul/spirit is what makes a human.|`|rGEZup0Zaa	Also, plenty of people are "pro-choice" in the legal sense, and yet wouldn't<br>  personally decide to abort.|`|JnXmSLDfaa	Yes,<br>   the term pro-life is a poor one to use in my opinion.|`|LsJqpTWsaa	If you think about it, they do the thing about pro-choice. It's not a big deal.|`|ebcfaff0504724aa2ad756522576c3b2aa	If you were "pro-choice" on the issue of owning slaves, would you not also be "pro-slavery", even if you did not own slaves? <br>  Therefore if you were against slavery, you could unequivocally be called "pro-freedom". Would it be fair to say a person who is "pro-choice" is "pro-freedom" on the slavery issue? No! Not if they did object to laws that outlaw slavery and think it is a personal choice whether or not to own slaves. They indeed don't care about the freedom of people who were "chosen" by others to be owned as slaves. <br>  <br>  Likewise how can you say that you're in favor of "life" if, to you, it is okay to take an unborn child, an innocent life, and have them physically destroyed and sucked out of the womb. Just so it's not you making the choice, eh?<br>  <br>  If an embryo or a fetus growing in the womb isn't alive, then what exactly is it? You're only either dead or alive, there's no scientific or otherwise standard for something in between.<br>  <br>  Obviously everyone makes choices and has been given free will. That doesn't mean we shouldn't answer for what we CHOOSE to do in our own lives, especially when we CHOOSE to destroy the life of another human being. That's where rights and natural law sometimes don't overlap. Violence isn't going to end anytime soon, that doesn't mean it should be welcomed with open arms, since some people choose to commit violent acts.|`|OsCCese3aa	Some use "anti-abortion" as a synonym to "pro-life" but this isn't accurate either.  A person can be both pro-choice and anti-abortion, in that they agree every woman has the right to choose but disagree with the act itself.<br>  "Pro-life" isn't a term used solely by pro-choice activists; it's used by pro-lifers as well.  Maybe "anti-women's-reproductive-rights" would be better suited.|`|UkKEvilYaa	"To call it "life" ? The real question is at what point does life begin? When does this fetus have rights a right to live that over rides the right of some one else deciding it should die. Do let society decide? A society that has a relative morality that changes almost on a daily basis. Or do we take a foundational truth that has not changed saying life begins at conception? Who is te ultimate authority in when a being begins to have rights? These are the questions to ask my friend.|`|dFfQxy92aa	This looks to have been asked by a pro-abortion trouble maker trying to provoke.<br>  <br>  An unborn child is a person, not a "fallacy".  And should have the right to live.  Hence: pro-life|`|fznvorZjaa	If abortion is right, then it should be right no matter what it's opponents truthfully call themselves.  They are pro-life after all.|`|X48z0Lwwaa	Yes.  "Anti-family planning" is more accurate.  Forcing people to have unwanted pregnancies is plain stupid.|`|TYPztzBlaa	Well, the term "pro-choice" implies that the other side is "anti-choice".  Your point?|`|tsLoOCqBaa	That's why 'pro-life' was chosen as the term to represent them. Because it makes the opposition look bad. <br>  It's merely a mind trick meant to screw with you.

2nRjy734aa	First, the one-drop rule applies to NO ONE. It is unscientific and was found unconstitutional (and good riddance) in 1967. It was founded by white, separatist racists and therefore should NEVER be advocated. I'll be so glad when people stop referencing it. <br>  <br>  You can't "consider" a mix ONE race. It is just that - a mix. A person of mixed race, no matter what race they "look" like or "identify" with, carries the genetic traits of all the races of his parents, both those that appear outwardly and those that don't. <br>  <br>  Your father is white. Your mom is white, black, and native American.<br>  Black+white+native American = Black, white and native American. <br>  <br>  You are ALL OF THE ABOVE. "apple picking" got it right - multiracial.<br>  <br>  Classifying the direct offspring of two or more races as ONE race is advocacy for internal segregation.|`|A9EydXySaa	lol your like everything! :D<br>  that is awesome really!!<br>  idk what i would consider you.<br>  but really, that is so cool, you have so many cultures!!!!<br>  :D|`|6SwaWSoyaa	You just answered your own question.

U5zcbHuZaa	No, success is to love unconditionally and raise the expectations. Love does not mean you allow excesses -- does Allah do things this way? No, he admonishes and punishes and promises more punishment to come in the hell fire. If you love others, you will keep reminding them of their obligations to Allah, to themselves, and to others.<br>  <br>  To me, success means doing what Allah has asked me to do, to not balk at Allah's plan, to accept it and go along even with the parts I don't like, to follow the cues given to me when they come, and to receive reward from Allah for doing this.

They do it for self gratification and to be self righteous.<br>  <br>  I came out of a bookstore one day to find a young woman with a double stroller scraping my pro-choice bumper sticker off my truck. I asked her politely what she thought she was doing, seeing as she was messing with my private property. She turned to me and told me I was a baby killer (it's not the first time I have been told that--I live in a conservative area and I am unapologetic about my views). I found her comment very interesting, since I have never actually killed a baby. I also don't know anyone who has. I know people who have had pregnancies terminated, and my GYN does that procedure, but I wouldn't call that baby killing. I pointed those facts out to her.<br>  <br>  Her reply was that abortion stops a beating heart (another one I have heard a million times). I politely pointed out that a high powered rifle aimed at the head or chest of a GYN who performs that service, when the trigger is pulled, also stops a beating heart. She sputtered and tried to come up with a clever response while I took out my phone and dialed 911 to report her for vandalism to my vehicle. When she heard what I was telling the dispatcher, she hurried away. I can only imagine that her "convictions" were not strong enough for her to feel comfortable facing the police on the issue.<br>  <br>  Ignore them. They're idiots. Does abortion stop a beating heart? It sure does. When you can convince me that that beating heart is a viable baby, able to survive outside the womb on its own, maybe I will change my views. Until then, they can leave me be.|`|JuRHr9g9aa	many say "murdering babies" because God says he knew you before you were in the womb (jeremiah 1:5) - implying that you are a full human being once conceived.  so murder, put to death, executed, etc could all be different variations.  if you don't believe in God, then i could see how you could have a good argument for pro choice.  if you do believe in God, then it is tough to ignore what He has said in scripture.|`|rn7UAtYJaa	Not all pro-lifers are like that.

The procedure used depends largely upon the stage of pregnancy and the size of the unborn child. Dr. J.C. Willke, in his book, Abortion: Questions and Answers (Hayes Publishing Co. Inc, Cincinnati, 1985), has divided the methods of abortion into three main categories: those that invade the uterus and kill the child by instruments which enter the uterus through the cervix; those that kill the preborn child by administration of drugs and then induce labour and the delivery of a dead baby; and, those that invade the uterus by abdominal surgery.<br>  <br>  Dilation of the uterus is required in cervical methods of abortion. The usual method of dilation is to insert a series of instruments of increasing size into the cervix. A set of dilators, metallic curved instruments, are used to open the cervix sufficiently to accommodate the instruments of abortion. In contrast with a normal birth, where the dilation occurs slowly over a period of many hours, the forceful stretching by the abortionist to open the cervix takes a matter of seconds. This premature and unnatural stretching of the cervix can result in permanent physical injury to the mother.|`|7422ddf097669bd7b6e3d48e56258b87aa	When you say "the science of abortion" do you mean the technology they use to suck out the baby's brain, the way they chop the baby up into little pieces while still inside the mother, or the way they inject saline solution into the womb, in order to burn the child to death?<br>  <br>  How would avoiding this type of destruction of innocent life be in any way elitist?|`|QluBTwCvaa	Once a child is conceived he changes shape constantly.  For the first nine months he needs a special environment and nutrients provided by the mother. For the year after birth he needs the mother's milk and a controlled environment so that he will grow and be healthy. When he starts to walk and talk, he needs a protected environment for his safety and health. When he is four he can do many things but is not worried about consequences, so he must be protected from his own new abilities' potential for danger. And on we go with new skills and new dangers.  His body keeps changing shape his whole life until it dies. At which stage does a pro - death person decide that he is not convenient to the "pro-death's" space and snuff out that life and remain guiltless?

Morally speaking, people shouldn't even have premarriage sex and they wouldn't get in this arguement if they followed god's laws.

QDz0FBv1aa	Well to put it in simple terms. No. Theres a whole bunch of other religons out there with different gods. So which is the real one. And how did God create him self?|`|6Zi7cA5Paa	here is your answer:<br>  <br>  Isaac Newton, had invited a scientist-friend of his, a man who professed atheism to dine with him. Seeking to corner his friend with his own arguments, Newton placed a model of the solar system on his table and invited his friend to view it. Upon examining it, Newton’s friend exclaimed, “what a marvellous craftsmanship!” Who fashioned this exquisite model?” Newton replied casually, “This model has no maker, it materialised from nothing.” Disbelief writen large on his face, the friend asked, “What do you mean?” To this, Newton smiled and replied, “How can you my friend, insist that this model has to have a maker, while vehemently denying the existence of a divine Creator?”<br>  <br>  Moral: If a model of the solar system must have a creator then what about the gigantic solar system itself? Let us worship that Creator who has created you and me.<br>  <br>  next...........<br>  <br>  Is there any proof that God exists?" was asked, by an atheist, of Imam Abu Hanifa and he replied, "Forget it! At the moment, I am busy thinking about this ship. People tell me there is a big ship, it contains <br>  different goods on board. There is no one to steer it, no one maintaining it. Yet, this ship keeps going back and forth; it even traverses big waves on the oceans; it stops at the locations that it is supposed to stop at; it continues in the direction that it is supposed to head. This ship has no captain and no one planning its trips." <br>  <br>  The atheist who posed the question interrupted and exclaimed, "What kind of strange and silly thought is this? How can any intelligent person think that some thing like this can occur?" <br>  <br>  Imam Abu Hanifa said, "I feel sorry about your state! You cannot imagine one ship running without some one looking after its affairs. Yet you think that for this whole world, which runs exactly and precisely, there is no one who looks after it, and no one owns it." <br>  <br>  Hearing the reply, the atheist was left speechless<br>  <br>  next..........<br>  <br>  Once upon a time there was a king and he was a wise man too. In his kingdom used to live many other wise men. Now some of these would not agree to believe that God did exist, while others not only agreed but argued to the satisfaction of the King that there was 'God'. The King, being a wise man, arranged for a discussion.<br>  <br>  The date and time for discussion was fixed. The king held his court at the appointed time on the appointed date. The non-believers assembled in his presence but the believing wise man did not come at the appointed time<br>  <br>  The people waited and waited till they lost their patience and uttered the words: "He has no arguments to advance in support of his conviction, so he will not come. He has lost, we have won."<br>  <br>  At last, the wise man arrived and there was an uproar in the court of the king. The people cried: "Why are you late? You have lost".<br>  <br>  The king asked him to explain the cause of his delay. The believing wise man explained, saying: "I started from my home in time, but when I came by the side of the river which I had to cross before reaching here, I did not find a single boat, by which I could cross and reach the opposite bank".<br>  <br>  Upto this point the disbelieving men heard him patiently and did not say a single word. The believing man then continued:<br>  <br>  <br>  "I waited and waited till at last I saw some planks of wood coming out of the river".<br>  <br>  And the unbelieving men began to shout "O, It is a lie. It is unbelievable. It is unthinkable".<br>  <br>  Continued the believing wise man: "Plank by plank came out of the river and then I saw the planks were cut to proper size and shape and joined to each other with nails by themselves until they formed a boat. And then I took my seat in it and came over to the other bank. I am late because of the delay in the availability of the boat".<br>  <br>  Amid a roar of the non-believing men, the believing wise man tried to convince them of the cause of the delay; but the opponents would not believe him. Then he said:<br>  <br>  "You do not believe what I say. It appears the story of the boat forming by itself is something impossible for you to believe. Now in the name of justice, I ask you. Do you see the earth, the sun, the moon, the stars and the skies? Every thing is set according to a plan. But you say it came into existence without a Creator. In other words you deny the existence of God. How far is your statement reasonable and justified?<br>  <br>  This silenced them all and there was no answer to this. So the non-believers lost and the believer won.<br>  <br>  So, there is a God, Allah Almighty.|`|b660102b2fc9513dd1125d9410450d92aa	God is real.

Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what! <br>  <br>  Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead.

I know that a user named Ninja & Ducky is a Niqaabi, and she comes here on the Ramadan section sometimes.<br>  <br>  I think it takes a tremendous amount of courage, and love for Allah (swt) to wear the Niqaab (Not that the Hijab should be demoted by this, but wearing a Niqaab is a highly commendable decision, in my opinion).<br>  <br>  I do not believe it is compulsory on Muslim women, though. Probably more or less Mustahab (Recommended/Praised in Islam). It's more of an individual's personal decision on how modesty should be portrayed, and I have a new-found respect for Sisters who do wear the Niqaab.<br>  <br>  And, InshaAllah, I hope Allah (swt) guides you in making your decision a lot more clearly. MashaAllah, for having the courage to consider wearing it.|`|JNr86XAVaa	It is up to you and we cant decide for you.|`|Vz3F1uw3aa	salam sis... <br>  <br>  Niqab was donned by our beloved Prophet(SAW)'s wives, daughters, and the noble sahabiyat.

Niqab is a personal choice that does not hurt others. People must learn to respect it.<br>  <br>  It's not hard to wear the Nigab or even the Hijab. Actually, the hardest point is to make a decision. When we want to do it we always start thinking that we might face difficulty which I would say that is normal.<br>  <br>  I would suggest you JUST DO IT. For sure, you will find out that is not hard at all. I would say the same to those Muslimah who are now thinking of wearing the Hijab.<br>  <br>  When I wanted to wear the Nigab I was afraid that something might happen and I might have to take it off.

The main character in one of her series is a werewolf and she can smell a different in vampires, like a vague scent of decay.

Homosexuality<br>  <br>  It doesn't. The Bible says that both homosexual and heterosexual sexual relations are immoral.<br>  <br>  Created in the image of the one God and equally endowed with rational souls, all men have the same nature and the same origin. Redeemed by the sacrifice of Christ, all are called to participate in the same divine beatitude: all therefore enjoy an equal dignity.<br>  <br>  The Catholic Church believes there is nothing sinful about being homosexual. But all unmarried people (homosexual, bisexual, and heterosexual) are called to celibacy.<br>  <br>  The Church specifically says that homosexuals "must be accepted with respect, compassion, and sensitivity. Every sign of unjust discrimination in their regard should be avoided."<br>  <br>  Official Church documents:<br>  + "Always Our Children: A Pastoral Message to Parents of Homosexual Children and Suggestions for Pastoral Ministers" <br>  <a href="http://www.usccb.org/laity/always.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.usccb.org/laity/always.shtml</a><br>  + "On the Pastoral Care of Homosexual Persons" <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/library/docs_df86ho.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.newadvent.org/library/docs_df...</a><br>  <br>  For more information, see the Catechism of the Catholic Church, section 2357-2359: <a href="http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt3sect2chpt2art6.shtml#2357" rel="nofollow">http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt3s...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  3. It doesn't.<br>  <br>  4. All over the place.<br>  <br>  Here are some Scriptures that teach against premarital sex:<br>  <br>  Exodus 22:16-17: An man had to marry the woman with whom he had premarital sex, if the father approved of the marriage, or pay a high price.<br>  <br>  Deuteronomy 22:13-21: Premarital sex is viewed as evil and a disgraceful thing.<br>  <br>  Proverbs 5:15-21: A man is to be a virgin when he takes his wife.<br>  <br>  In addition to these Scriptures, there are over 30 other verses in the Old Testament speaking about a "virgin" or "virgins." Virginity was highly cherished as the standard for God's people.<br>  <br>  In the New Testament we don't have verses describing the act of premarital sex and its consequences like we do in Exodus or Deuteronomy. It is clear, however, that virginity is still the standard for unmarried Christians and that sex outside the context of marriage is still considered sin.<br>  <br>  1 Corinthians 7:7:28,34,36-38: Virginity is assumed for unmarried women just as in the Old Testament. Virginity is still the standard for God's people in the New Covenant.<br>  <br>  1 Corinthians 6:16-18: Sexual intimacy "unites" you with your spouse. Outside of marriage this is called "sexual immorality." <br>  <br>  1 Corinthians 7:1-2: Marriage is recommended avoid sexual immorality.<br>  <br>  1 Corinthians 7:8-9: Premarital sex isn't an option for dealing with lust. Marriage is once again recommended avoid sexual immorality.<br>  <br>  Ephesians 5:31: Paul is affirming the Old Testament standard of uniting in flesh only with your spouse. One fleshness is to happen when a man is "united to his wife." <br>  <br>  1 Thessalonians 4:2-8: "Acquire a wife in a way that is holy and honorable" or you are in sexual immorality. Sexual sin harms others besides those who engage in it. Premarital sex "cheats" the future spouse by robbing him or her of the virginity that ought to be brought to marriage.<br>  <br>  Hebrews 13:4: It is a pure marriage bed or you are an "adulterer" or "sexually immoral."<br>  <br>  1 Timothy 5:2: As a Christian man, if you are not married to her, then she is your sister whom you must treat "with absolute purity."<br>  <br>  2 Corinthians 11:2: Although this passage is talking about Christ and His people, it uses the analogy of a Christian man receiving his bride "as a pure virgin." Virginity was the ideal. Premarital sex was viewed as sexual immorality - just as in the Old Testament.<br>  <br>  <br>  5. It does not. In fact, the NT says that a man has authority over his wife AND a woman has authority of her husband.<br>  <br>  The husband should fulfill his duty toward his wife, and likewise the wife toward her husband. A wife does not have authority over her own body, but rather her husband, and similarly a husband does not have authority over his own body, but rather his wife. (1 Corinthians 7:3-4)<br>  <br>  With love in Christ.|`|nyylb6qUaa	I am glad to see a christian on here. I  first want to say I am very proud of you. Here are some answers to your questions:<br>  <br>  1. Exodus states that "Thou shalt not kill". Now, psalms says that "God knew me before I was conceived. People say that abortion is fine because the child is not a human life. The bible however states that God knew us before we were conceived. So then, if God knew us before we were conceived, in his eyes, we are alive. Therefore, abortion is murder.<br>  <br>  2. You are exactly right on this question. Very good insight.<br>  <br>  3. The bible does not say dinosaurs never existed. The book of Job says that there were cavemen, and it talks about big behemoths.<br>  <br>  4. Romans 1:29 talks about fornication. Paul lists several sins that make people the lowest of the low.<br>  <br>  5. It does not specifically say that women are lesser then men. It says in Ephesians 5:22-27 that wives need to submit unto their husbands. The book of Genesis describes women getting the shorter end because of Eve.<br>  <br>  Very good questions my brother. Hope I was able to help.

I view the bible just as a book that an " Author Wrote". Like a normal author would right books. I.E. Harry Potter made by Rowling's. It's stupid for people like you, and other fake christians and catholics, and other stupid, idiotic religion out There to think, and get so carry away in such naive BS. You see people like you, and other fake christians who take " Religion" so seriously are the reason why crimes happen, why there's hate, and why theres some much evil. Technically, the only reason there is evil is because your stupid religion re-calls it anyways!!! Bunch of Morons!!!!|`|tsLoOCqBaa	It doesn't say any of those things. Too bad there are still those who like to over analyze and misinterpret.|`|AA10153636	Jeremiah says that God knew him in the womb and formed him there.  So God is recognizing a fetus as being a person and there fore it is wrong to kill a person.<br>  Jer 1:5  "I chose you before I gave you life, and before you were born I selected you to be a prophet to the nations." <br>  <br>  2. Lev 20:13  If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them. <br>  *So God calls gay sex an abomination here and it is then wrong and a sin to do that.   We do not judge people, but God does judge people that break his laws, and we are to warn people of that judgment.  <br>  <br>  3.  It doesn't say that dinosaurs never existed, because they were here at the same time man was..<br>  <br>  4.Act 15:20  But that we write unto them, that they abstain from pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from things strangled, and from blood. <br>  1Co 6:18  Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body. <br>  1Th 4:3  For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication: <br>  1Co 6:9  Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, <br>  <br>  5. The Bible doesn't say that the woman is lesser, but that she is to obey her husband as he is the head of the home.  God put the man in charge of the family and the church.   <br>  Col 3:18  Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord. <br>  Eph 5:24  Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing. <br>  Eph 5:22  Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.|`|Jw3VExIpaa	it did say somthing about dinosaurs existing but god wipped them out its like the beasts of the world were unholy then thrown out and for abortion and gays and all the other stuff look it up in google its all in there. second of all the bible shouldnt be changed and you cant pick and choose what you want to believe just like you cant pick and choose laws that you want to follow|`|1LZdc4K5aa	I would reccomend going to a christian forum.

Jeremiah 1:5, Psalm 139: 13-16, Exodus 21:22-25 prescribes the same penalty of someone who causes the death of a baby in the womb as the penalty for someone who commits murder. This clearly indicates that God considers a baby in the womb as just as much of a human being as a full-grown adult.<br>  <br>  2.Leviticus 18:22 While Sodom and Gomorrah were surely guilty of many other horrendous sins, homosexuality was the reason God poured fiery sulfur on the cities, completely destroying them and all of their inhabitants. To this day, the area where Sodom and Gomorrah were located remains a desolate wasteland. Sodom and Gomorrah serve as a powerful example of how God feels about sin in general, and homosexuality specifically.<br>  <br>  3. Job 40:15ff.  Those who believe in an older age for the earth tend to agree that the Bible does not mention dinosaurs, because according to their paradigm, dinosaurs died out millions of years before the first man ever walked the earth. The men who wrote the Bible down couldn’t have seen dinosaurs alive. Behemoth is said to be the mightiest of all God’s creatures, a giant whose tail is likened to a cedar tree.<br>  <br>  4. Ephesians 5:3, 1Thessalonians 4:3,  If "living together" means living in the same house, that is perhaps somewhat of a different issue. Ultimately, there is nothing wrong for a man and a woman to live in the same house – IF there is nothing immoral taking place. However, the problem arises in that there is still the appearance of immorality. <br>  <br>  5. 1Timmothy 2:11-12, Ephesians 5:22-33, "Adam was created first, then Eve. And Adam was not the one deceived; it was the woman who was deceived." That is the reason. God created Adam first and then created Eve to be a "helper" for Adam. This order of Creation has universal application in the family and the church. <br>  <br>  There is some, I said some, of the places in the Bible where it mentions of your questions.  I know I wrote a lot, but you wanted the places in the Bible and I added a description for each.|`|vciEtUcPaa	Alli,a christian is one who has made Jesus Lord of their lives.And if that has happened then your lifestyle and attitude should echo that.You just can't pick and choose what part of the Bible you're going to accept.It's not a smorgasbord where you pick a little prophesy here and maybe some grace here or there.If Your opinions run contrary to what the Word says,then repent and change.Trying to justify sin because it feels good will land a person in hell.as far as your asking where these things are in the Bible,do some studying."Study to show yourself approved unto God,a workman that needs not to be ashamed,rightly dividing the word of truth.|`|S77199zgaa	1.It doesn't say abortion is wrong but many Christians believe that abortion is murder and the bible says murder is wrong.<br>  <br>  2.It doesn't say.

That is debated today, because times have changed and courtships are different (back then people would get married at an early age without dating, etc.) Some Christians believe that moving in together is wrong because it leads to sex before marriage.<br>  <br>  5.

I Thessalonians 4:3 "flee fornication" <br>  <br>  5. The Bible doesn't say women are less than men, it says the wife is to submit to the husband, and the husband is to love the wife even as Christ loved the church. Ephesians 5:22 and Ephesians 5:25. That doesn't lessen the women in any way.|`|NRQm8d0Vaa	1.  Matt 18:10<br>  2.  Gen 2;24-25 ,Lev18;22<br>  3.  doesn't say that, it actually speaks of large beasts similar to dinosaurs<br>  4.

Moses is the messenger that setup jewdism.<br>  Hindus worship multiple Gods and they have strict beliefs.<br>  sikhism is also in India but sikhs believe in God and theyr'e vegeterians.<br>  Muslims also believe in the same god as jews and Christians. The only different  is that they think Christ was a messenger just like all the messengers before him the like moses, Nova, and mohamad who came after. Their holy book is Quran. Many of the strict practices that muslims do is not in the quran and therefore are only traditions.|`|aF4mFlJiaa	Do you know any Jehovah's Witnesses?

No one else thought as I did, so you can imagine how very interesting "Bible Study" got at home. My mother was so shocked by my steadfastness, but nothing she said could change my mind. As shy as I was, I stood my ground and refused to accept my families' beliefs. For whatever reason, I simply could not accept the Christian concepts to the point I got nothing out of the studies. <br>  <br>  When I was fourteen, I decided I wanted to search for what I could not find in Christianity. I was literally starving spiritually for something I had no name for, but felt it existed somewhere. <br>  <br>  I visited other religions--studied with some of them, but there was always that point where I was aware they were not for me. I just about visited every church/religion you could think of and they all fell short of the concept I had in my mind and heart for My true religion. The one religion I kept searching for was that which I could serve with all my heart and soul totally, fully, truly and uncondionally beyond a shadow of a doubt. <br>  <br>  I was an oddball among my family and my peers. All during my childhood strange things happened to me that could not be explained by ordinary standards. I stood out like a sore thumb. I stopped going to church except for special family funcions and funerals. I prayed to God often, and tried to live my life each day to the best of my abilities with God's guidance. I prayed to God to show me where I belonged. I asked Him where did I belong? I prayed for years and years, and would you believe I finally got my answer? Almost 4 years ago, I got an unsolicited letter out of the blue from a man who got my name from a penpal list sent to him by his sister-in-law. <br>  <br>  I answered his first letter and from then on, it all was very interesting. I could read from the flavor of his letters that he was Muslim; he acknowledged this fact. I noticed his beliefs were a lot like my own and over time,he told me that without knowing it,I basically lived my life as a believer. We had so much in common when it came to serving God. <br>  <br>  He sent me literature. The first piece of literature was so very beautiful, I could hardly stand the overwhelming emotion that came forth as I read it. It touched me to the point that I could not hold back my tears. I was so shaken by it; I have no words to explain what was in my heart at that time. I thorouhly studied all the literature sent thereafter, and it had the same emotional affect upon me. <br>  <br>  There came a point in my studies where I hungered to know more and more, so I bought my own Holy Quran. I needed to read this Book from whence all this beauty and truth flowed. I have never been able to simply take someone's word for anything. Religion is definitely not something to embark upon with "blind" faith; I have always felt the need to seek truth and knowledge for myself. <br>  <br>  The first day I got the Holy Quran [English translaton], I read the opening, Al-Fatihah. It was short, but so very beautiful and so powerful!!! That year I read the entire Holy Quran. I learned the Five Pillars of Islam and the Six Articles of Faith. <br>  <br>  At the age of 45, Allah finally told me where I belonged. I accepted Islam openly and fully. That which I sought, but had not the name of, was in fact Islam. I eagerly embraced it fully and as natural as the air I am blessed to breathe each day I wake. My soul was starving for Islam, and my heart yearned for it. Islam has never felt like a stranger to me. By the Grace, Love and Mercy of Allah, I AM HOME!!!! AMEEN! <br>  <br>  As far as I know, I am the first in my generational family line to become Muslim. Needless to say, my family members were not happy campers! It was like a single republican [me] being in the midst of generations of democrats! All praise be to Allah, One of my two sons embraced Islam a year later. <br>  <br>  In closing, I would like to include a part of something I wrote to a friend who recently apologized for some very harsh/bitter things he said with regard to Muslims/Islam as a result of the 9-11-01 bombings in the U.S. These words sum up all that I feel for Islam: <br>  <br>  "I embraced Islam because I have basically lived my life in this manner anyway--all my life. It seemed so natural and befitting to embrace Islam, and so I did. It has wrapped itself around me like a cloak of warmth, honor and protection. I try to wear this "cloak" each day to the best of my abilities--I want to make it even stronger, for in doing so, I come closer to becoming what God has ordained for me to become. Whatever, that is, I know it is a good thing. God only has goodness and is goodness." <br>  <br>  This is my story of How I entered into Islam. This story has no ending. It begins again each time I wake and will not end until Allah calls me back to him. In the meantime, I will strive to work very hard at sending good things ahead of me!

83275bbee3a48525b38d928f44cc193eaa	Never come out until you're ready!<br>  <br>  Because once you 'come out' you never stop coming out.  Meaning that whenever you meet someone new, the new person in your life will either hear from you, your friends or enemies that you are gay.  So, every time you meet someone for the rest of your life, your "Daniel, et.al." the gay guy, lol.  Which isn't bad, but you don't just come out one day and its "whew" over with.  Nope, from then on out, every time you meet someone its something they will learn about you.<br>  <br>  So, don't do it until YOU are ready!  Personally, its the best thing I've ever done, but I'm lucky to have a wonderful, loving family.|`|fdc721c8e9fa936f998a77bb5b1c3b0aaa	There is nothing wrong with waiting until you are out of High School, I am waiting till I am out of High School to tell everyone, my mom knows, and I tried to tell my Dad but I don't think he wanted to hear it, so, and a few friends know, but I will deny it if someone asks me or tells me I am, mostly because HS is stressful enough without having to deal with people judge you on your preference, like in reality it doesn't matter what others think, and this is true, but still, everyone cares what others think, so for my own sake, I am waiting till after HS to tell everyone and be open about it.|`|IgHUhZs8aa	Telling people the truth and not putting on airs is how you find out who your true friends are. If your friends abandon you when they find out, they're horrible friends and you didn't deserve them in the first place. But you should be comfortable with it yourself before you do anything, because running away with embarrassment is never fun.|`|AA11485682	Coming out when you feel ready. Some people are ready to come out when they're young, other people need more time. I'd say do it sooner rather than later, but you shouldn't come out if you're uncertain that you'll be safe or that people will accept you.|`|wn4k7EDBaa	i think that there is nothing wrong with not coming out until after. i won't. it is hard enough going through high school, let alone going through it openly gay. why would you want to do that to yourself? just do what feels right. maybe you only come out to one person... its really simple do what makes you happy|`|86pzq89Xaa	you take that risk only when you feel ready for the rewards/repercussions....you don't ever have to tell anyone if you don't want to|`|AA10517807	your sexuality is your business and no body else's. you don't have to tell  anybody if you don't want to|`|pZu6Mk42aa	if ur asking all these questions then ur probably not ready to come out.|`|MRvwEnB0aa	I don't believe in "coming out!" What's the big deal? Do you absolutely NEED to get permission to be what you are? Yes! I know that peer pressure can be a real difficult thing. But most of these "friends" or relatives don't have the capacity to accept anything they're afraid of anyway. So why bother.|`|5qFmukWwaa	You have to do what's right for yourself.  Its just like having sex for the first time, or getting married, or having children...you are the only one who can know when the time is right.|`|HH90Eghaaa	Of course its ok!<br>  I waited until I was certain, and financially independent from my parents before I came out! Wasn't sure how they would take it! Turned out great but I don't regret my decision to wait!|`|X0Vb97oYaa	If you must... Although i have to say that sometimes it's best to come out early, as later on, you will regret not having done so. You can if  you want, but if you find that you need more time, then let it be so. <br>  Finding out if your friends accept you or not is all part of asking them how they think about gays- not directly of course, or else you'd be giving away alot more ;) <br>  That's all i have to say.|`|cIvFOzoiaa	Tell people when you're ready, it's your life and only you can know what's right for you to do when it comes to that kind of a decision.|`|ITiuIb1Waa	come out when ever your ready to and not a minute sooner,whenever you feel comforable|`|nisfxpXHaa	You should come out when your ready. <br>  <br>  <br>  L
Xsen794Aaa	"Sie sind meine welt" could mean "you are my world" if you're being formal to the person with whom your speaking, which is weird for a statement like this.  But it could also mean "They are my world," which is also just a weird thing to say to someone in general.<br>  <br>  It's especially weird because it's being put with "ich liebe dich," which is the informal way of saying "I love you."  These two clauses don't belong in the same sentence.  It should be either "Du bist meine Welt, ich liebe dich," or "Sie sind meine Welt, ich liebe Sie," but I'd go with the first one because you wouldn't say this to someone and be so formal at the same time.<br>  <br>  Lexicon:<br>  sie= you (formal) or they<br>  sind = are (conjugated form of "sein"=to be)<br>  meine= my (in front of feminine nouns)<br>  Welt=world<br>  ich= I<br>  liebe= love (verb; conjugated form on "lieben"= to love)<br>  dich = you (case when something is being done to "you")|`|5yRRRPsRaa	Hi.<br>  <br>  "Ich liebe dich" means "I love you".<br>  The first part puzzles me -- I think it can mean either "They are my world" or "*You* are my world", being this *You* a formal way to adress someone older than the speaking person, or with a higher hierarchy.<br>  <br>  Hope it helps,<br>  JML|`|vn4LCpdgaa	well in the literal translation... sie sind meine welt would mean they are my world. and ich liebe dich of course means I love you.

5FR2afKeaa	ghosts and spirits are different.<br>   Ghosts you can see while spirits you cannot.<br>  My theology is that ghosts are spirits that havent entered the spirit world and are stuck between our world and the spirit world in other words they are lost and have not fully accepted that they are no longer a part of our world, it is tragic but through time they will if they want enter the spirit world and we will no longer see them but could notice things that they do but other ghosts will not accept because they are really having such fun or their deadline that was given to them to enter the spirit world has expired and this is tragic because many of them would like to be at peace but cant now because of this and this is why they manifest themselves to us to let us know that they are unhappy and to see if we can do anything for them i:e say prayers to god to finally let them have peace once and for all.

Physically, there is no reason or evidence for ghosts to exist.|`|ccFIoqkNaa	Yes there are<br>  (How many times is this question going to be asked by people)|`|rftEZA50aa	maybe.|`|dTDnnCAPaa	Nope.|`|82981bdf8a4b0ac0c84ad5280e52bff8aa	This totally depends on your own perception. Paranormal activity has and continues to be studied yet just like god it is very hard to prove it exists. <br>  Example - all world religion shares many common themes and scientific evidence will suggest that all religions are in fact made up. Given that almost 80% of the world's population follow one faith or another suggests that a god does exist. <br>  Your perception is your own definition and if ghosts exist in your view then they exist.|`|uoNo41Oiaa	first of all learn grammer "are there ghost in the world?" <br>  second yes there are, ghosts or spirits are like cells if you like they arnt living but you cant really say they are dead. when you die, only you body dies. you spirit leaves the shell or body and goes in search of a new one. this is where the though of reincarnaion comes from.<br>  the ghost are spirits who havent yet found a body in which to comand. <br>  <br>  Some ghosts are balls or orbes these are spirits which have taken no particular shape. ghosts which have a human or animal shape are spirits who liked there previous image. <br>  <br>  hope this helped, my theories arnt everyones cup of tea!|`|NbmnWwqEaa	Yes, there are . . . <br>  Some of us can actually see them . . . <br>  And ghosts are there for a reason . . .<br>  Spirits are different from ghosts.|`|zEoRcL91aa	I believe that people are haunted, not places.

4mkKoYn6aa	i dont have a stance on this my opinion is that thou the number of humans in this planet need to change other things, the amount of humans means nothing if the humans that are here are messed up|`|zyw4i3kRaa	That's a dangerous line to cross & one that needs addressing as well, only who gets to decide? <br>  <br>  The UN has discussed such a thing for quite some time in private and more & more, especially with the reaction to the octupulet case, I get the feeling intolerance is growing in regards to 'useless eaters' & humanity in general.Its sort of frightening to see how many people (even here in Yahoo answers with Darwinists & fundies) take the basic view that mankind is rotten to the core,an animal or tremendous disappointment & nothing else, instead of maybe deeply confused species trying its best. These kinds of things happen though when you make living in the country harder & harder & pile people together in monolithic cities like sardines in a can. Human life depreciates in value. Forced Immigration & multiculturalism hasn't exactly helped with this frustration either. I'm still of the opinion that those in charge of such decisions have known this all along though, I don't care how many think that's paranoid, its not like these kinds of problems haven't made the rounds before.|`|AlJrVK8Gaa	You pose an interesting and sensitive question.  At our current rate of growth, we will reach a point in the future where the earth's resources can no longer sustain us.  There is an equilibrium in the world's resources, and the balances are shifting.  There are only so many pieces of the pie to go around, and we are rapidly reaching that limit.  We are at the point where there is not enough to go around, there are the have's and the have-not's, the winners and the losers.  We will see continuing famines and energy shortages.<br>  <br>  In nature, this problem works its self out.  When the land cannot support an animal population, there is a famine and half the population dies.  After that, the land can once again support that population. <br>  <br>  The question is what to do?  <br>  <br>  Do countries like the US and Great Brittan give up their resources to help the rest of the world?  That can only last for so long, until everyone in the world lives in a "third world country".  <br>  <br>  Do we impose population control?  This goes against human nature.<br>  <br>  In the past, when resources were running low, wars were the by-product and solution.  If country A has just enough water to support themselves and country B does not, eventually country B has a choice; die of dehydration or attack country A in an attempt to get their water.  In the end, thousands of people die and the water supply can once again support both countries.  Its not a happy solution, but it is a solution none the less.<br>  <br>  The fact is that there are only limited resources.  Technology can allow us to use our resources more efficiently, but we cannot artificially replace our limited resources.<br>  <br>  I don't like the idea of relying on wars, so to me there is only one solution....population controls.  Each family is only allowed to have only one child.  This will limit the population of the world.  I don't like it, but it is the only solution that I can see.  If we can't increase the supply, we can only decrease the demand.<br>  <br>  A very interesting question indeed.|`|DtotNQ3oaa	Yes, but so far only white people have a little to negative growth number.If they make even one law to control population i know we will disappear.That is my thought.BEST WISHES !|`|AA10356839	No, we do not have a moral obligation to limit growth.|`|BocSPse8aa	How would limiting population save humanity?<br>  <br>  You should add more details to your question.<br>  <br>  And no why? How would it help? I mean if what youre trying to say is that people shouldnt have 14 kids like that dumb mom that just wants attention, then yes.<br>  <br>  But i dont understand how limiting population growth save humanity...saving it from what?|`|ozvC05yJaa	I don't know if our obligation is to LIMIT the population as much as to help it. Lots of the world population is impoverished, and I think it would do humanity better to help them out than to have fewer children.|`|ckIQfT2saa	well by meaning more abortions, killings, war etc.........then no<br>  <br>  but if you mean like not having as much children, then yes if you could talk the millions of people in this world to stop having unpretected sex.....but i doubt they will listen|`|Ag0jb7Neaa	i think so<br>  we have opted not to have biological children<br>  there are enough kids out there who need support and love, i just can't understand why more people don't see that

Have fun, cause it's your birthday. & Also, I don't think you are too young to be renting a hotel. As long as you have parental supervision.. you're fine!|`|rPoKRm8gaa	You can get movies.

Also used to say, they don't sell drinks at the theatre because the kids will spill them on the seats.

Ladies shouldn't be heard when walking - step lightly and don't clomp along.<br>  7. People judge you by the quality of your shoes.<br>  8. Don't chew gum in public.<br>  <br>  Yes, my sisters had more rules than I did!

If that's the case and you really want people to know you didn't mean harm, explain yourself and apologize. That's it. If you really are racist and meant what you said then you should stick by it and take whatever you get.<br>  <br>  And you do not need Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson to publicly forgive you. Who gives a flying pig what they think anymore. I'm all for the cause of ending racism improving the lives of the black community as a whole, and America...all that good stuff but they are on a whole new level!

My wife is Chinese, and we both can't understand why professional grudge seekers play offended at a one time innocent joke. After all, East Asians do actually have slanted eyes, if you don't like that, sue God. Now if Miley was a card carrying member of the Aryan Nation, the feeling might be different. But in most cases, my answer to grudge hounds is, if you feel offended by such small stuff, get a life, and remember that you might be sinning in the same way.|`|uVQ6OSu3aa	Just say, hey ive got black friends, and I made a mistake with a bad joke.

I love my family......?|`|olgdyKzEaa	I personally don't care if the toilet seat is up or down. I absolutely cannot stand it when people pee on the seat and don't clean it, though. That concept is so beyond me... how do you not clean up after yourself? How do you pee on something and not even think to wipe it up? It's not like it's hard. I have little patience or respect for people who don't clean up their own messes (this goes for in the bathroom, everywhere else in the house, at work, in public... everywhere). My four year old understands the concept of wiping off the pee with toilet paper when he misses. He also understands the concept of putting his toys away, putting his dirty clothes in the hamper, and generally cleaning up after himself. If my four year old boy can do it, why can't a grown man? There's just no excuse for leaving puddles (or even droplets) of pee all over the place.<br>  <br>  To answer your specific question, yes, I generally do trust sitting on the toilet without looking when there are males in the house. The only male who lives here is my son, and he's certainly not a slob. My brothers spend a significant amount of time in my home, and I do not remember ever having to check for puddles before sitting down. My brothers clean their own messes... they've done this for as long as I can remember. I was not raised in a family of slobs, and now that I have children of my own, I refuse to raise a family of slobs. (And yes, peeing on the seat and not cleaning it up when you're done is slob behavior)|`|FPsU6HOXaa	in response to lady cath:<br>  -why do you have to check the toilet seat in your OWN house?<br>  -you should trust your partner to NOT leave a mess for you.<br>  that's just rude +disrepectful!<br>  -because if a man properly aims // sits, he doesn`t even need to lift the seat. for a woman, she knows to sit, so she`ll just end up falling in.<br>  - - - along with this "age old" question is the "age old" idea that men are to be considerate of women!<br>  - example: ladies first / opening the door for her / rising when she leaves or comes to the table.|`|VMY7No0eaa	I have fallen into the toilet ONCE.... then the explosion happend... <br>  THIS WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT... when the light was not on...IT shocks you awake... and instantly puts you in a bad mood.<br>  <br>  I would suggest putting in a urinal if you don't want to deal with the seat...or buy one of the automatic closing seats.(they have them you know)<br>  <br>  I guarintee if you want into the bathroom in the middle of the night and had to do a poop and you forgot that you didn't put the seat down then you fell in THE COLD COLD WATER... waking you up COMPLEATELY AND PUT YOU IN SHOCK... you would understand.<br>  <br>  During the day it's easy to see the seat is up ... at night not so.<br>  so training is in order... seat down! at all times!

But as you said, she does pay her rent every month.

But you live there and you need to do whatever you think is best. Take care ?|`|bLARMYAfaa	What if they break up the week after your snitch makes her lose the appartment?

Really nice, trusting people like you attract selfish, wicked people that will take advantage.

So in the moment they wil pretend to be grateful, but once they get what they wanted out of you they could care less about you. <br>  <br>  Try to gravitate toward people who offer to help YOU for a change, and then you can feel the love of give and take, not "give-give-get trampled on".|`|uXdx9vuBaa	just seems like you just had bad luck with some nasty people. But there are alot more nasty people than good people.  Dont change b/c you had a few mishaps.  There are good people out there who will appreciate your kindness.  Many people do not expect to return favors either. If you plan on doing random acts of kindness in the future, do not expect anything back in return this way you wont get hurt.  Even if they offer they will do something, chances are they wont.  Its just how people are sometimes.<br>  <br>  There are many mean people in the world and the nicer you are, the more meaner people it seems there are. This is b/c you are a nice person and stand out from the rest of the crowd.  You actually have a gift and dont realize it.|`|a9e8bc83e62624fca53023ca2634933aaa	A lot of people are like that, but you can't let it get to you. I think they were just greedy and took advantage of the opportunity. I can't stand people like that =/|`|o38i8ba3aa	First of all, you are nice to go out like that and if everyone was like that then we wouldn't be having this conversation.  However, those people were just users.  Unless you really know someone, a good friend or a family member, then maybe you shouldn't go all out like that.  Unfortunately you are asking for trouble or letdowns.  I mean, as much as my heart goes out to some people and their situations, sometimes there is just nothing that can be done.  Think about it, they put themselves in their own bad positions and you can't be expected to bail everyone out that you meet.

The wider the halo, the more likely the rain.<br>  <br>  The reason for this is because the halo is caused by moisture in the air and the reflection of the sun's light off of the moon being refracted through the moisture.|`|HEDSOHq1aa	no scientific evidence|`|KKh8rikGaa	Old folks said that, I don't think it's true ALL the time though|`|MYO2k9EUaa	I don't think so, because everyone on Earth can see the moon, and you say you've observed this on several occasions.

Z5vvgPnOaa	It is a shame that you have to use your own money to have your 13th birthday party, and that the present your mum gives you is money which you will end up having to spend.<br>  <br>  I think it is a bit awkward to ask people to pay - but if my daughter was invited to an ice skating party, I would send her with money just in case.<br>  <br>  Maybe you should consider changing your plans - have a party at home (hire some dvds or have a pj party or a themed party), at the beach, the swimming pool or the park. That way you don't have to ask people to pay, and you won't end up spending all your money.<br>  <br>  Best wishes for your 13th! :-)|`|rPoKRm8gaa	Go to Pudding Edge/glow in the dark mini golf.

There is no cost!|`|ozwLZwXeaa	There is a service that you pay for and they send you a device that if you fall down and can't get up, you push the button and it calls for help for her. You could notify the police or whoever, that she can not talk so they know that information.<br>  My jaw was wired shut for 6 weeks and I learned to talk by forcing myself to do that our of necessity. I had six small children and I was the only one home with them during the day. I stretched the rubberbands that were hooked onto the wires and made words come out. She should try that. My dr said he thought I would never be able to talk again because the auto accident really messed up the bones in my face. But I needed to, so I did.|`|uVQ6OSu3aa	She can still call 911 and not hang up. Or moan into the phone but not hang up. The police will respond quickly.
eGvyFeW9aa	This is very normal for a straight person.|`|swkhohjgaa	I'm bisexual and to me you sound normal. Finding women attractive and being attracted to them is two different.|`|QNGzjvRKaa	Technically I'd say not if you haven't "slept" with a woman. You are just having fantasies / thoughts about sex which is perfectly normal.|`|npFQCNhSaa	normal i guess|`|GB1f4sEEaa	When you see an attractive woman, do you just admire how attractive she is or do you have thoughts of touching her, kissing her, etc?<br>  <br>  If you have sexual thoughts about someone of the same sex, you may be bisexual to a degree.|`|vn16f38naa	lol! I wouldn't worry about it hun. Everyone does it. I'm straight and I will say "Dude she's so friggin hot!!" and my girlfriends would look at me funny and be like, "Oh come on!! You know it's true!"

It could be that you're in a current state where your mind is at war with your feelings trying to discover your true sexuality. This goes on within many people throughout their lives, even if they're not teens.<br>  <br>  You could just be "bi-curious".|`|KBBonf97aa	It's completely normal and you're not bisexual!  Everyone likes looking at attractive people, regardless of gender.  The entire advertising industry is built on that fact.  Cosmetics and clothing manufacturers know all women respond to images of sexy, beautiful women, so they use them exclusively in their advertising.  And most straight men claim they're indifferent to the sex appeal of other guys, but they're lying so we won't think they're gay.  The fact that guys are universally decked out in Abercrombie & Fitch suggests those sexy ads are hitting their target audience.  <br>  <br>  If you've always liked guys, you're straight, and there's nothing wrong with recognizing the fact that some women are dead sexy.  Thinking it wrong would be like saying you can't find roses beautiful because lilies are your favorite flower.

First you recognized God for who he is, asking for His Kingdom and His will be done, verse 11 is asking to be given our daily bread-His knowledge, His words, asking that He forgives you of your sins as you forgive those who have done wrong to you, and asking that He order your footsteps keeping you safe from evil. Prayer is YOUR communication with God. It don't have to be a drawn out speech but you talking with God about thankfulness, grief, repentance-whatever is on your heart you need to express to Him. In all things you must thank Him, Philippians 4:4-7

KBxz1Wfyaa	About 8 years ago we went to the very first Art Show and Auction that a local Not For Profit was putting on.  They were showcasing a good friend's art.  She had just passed away the year before to cancer.  My husband and I showed up in jeans and the t-shirts we had from the benefit we helped put on when she was first diagnosed.  What a surprise when we walked in and everyone was in after 5 attire.  It didn't bother my husband a bit but I saw the people looking down their noses at us.  After a few glasses of wine it was all good.  I thought about how my friend was just laughing her you know what off because when she was alive you only saw her in jeans and paint splattered t-shirts.  <br>  My husband and I then surprised a few by buying some nice pieces of art and I had a ball running up the bid on some just so those snots had to blow the dust off of their check books. lol.  We have gone back every year since then to the event.  Some years we have dressed up and some years if we happen to have been out riding his motorcycle that day, it's jeans.|`|g0gMQUCVaa	Last one I remember was my son's graduation from military boot camp.  We wore dresses and suit and tie.  Everyone else wore jeans.<br>  <br>  I felt like a real dork.  Oh well.  We had fun anyway.  Afterward, we took Ryan to a really, really nice dinner.  He was in a dress uniform and really looked sharp.  It was fun.|`|GrKiEDb1aa	One Saturday morning my wife and I jumped on my bike...aka motorcycle...and went for a ride.  We headed west out of Virginia Beach along I-64, which turned into Va 58.  We went all the way out to Danville, then headed north.  We wound up on Lynchburg (home of Jerry Fallwell).  It was late in the afternoon, so we had dinner then got a room.  Called home and told our youngest(in high school) we wouldn't be back until sometime Sunday.  From Lynchburg we headed east, wound up in Scotland (Virginia, not the country) and caught the Jamestown Ferry (my wife actually asked the guy at the booth..."Where does the Jamestown Ferry go?"  He replied, "Ah....Jamestown?"  hahahahaha<br>  Then on to Jamestown, took a trip over to Yorktown and toured the battle fields,  then on to 17, across the Coleman Bridge (way high and with the grated part at the top...scary on a m/c).  Picked up 64 and back to 'the Beach.'|`|59Wg2cI3aa	Quite often we o things spur of the moment, on some occasions it may have better had we considered what we were wearing, ...but oh well|`|f6570cfbea3dd78b529876a088bffb0eaa	I've gone to wedding wearing jeans and shorts only because I had so much to do that day.

Needless to say we drove on back down !|`|8G42oyydaa	You just never know do you? Symphony, got dressed up but not over the top, velvet top, long black skirt and everyone else was in jeans, figure that one out, it was in Saskatchewan so that might explain it, my date wore a suit LOL  We were getting a lot of looks, I like to think they thot we looked good.<br>  <br>  It wasnt spur of the moment though.<br>  <br>  And my daughters wedding, I had a really bad car accident the evening before, I was stoned on demerol and muscle relaxers, could hardly move without screaming and I looked a wreck, I just couldnt get it together that day. <br>  <br>  Wish I could do it all over again,  the long skirt I wore wasnt exactly flattering and neither was the evening dress kind of jacket I picked to go with it :-(   I looked like a midget (I'm quite short and had to take my heels off because of the back pain) at a funeral, both were black. I feel bad about that, I mean the mother of the bride dressed all in black? <br>  <br>  Wish I could turn back the clock and do it all over again, without the accident and the pain.

Hf94X5Wvaa	I'm sorry I must have been absent that day in school, the homosexuals are doing what now?|`|IvZo21kEaa	Umm, what? I thought homosexuals were trying to return the whole SEPARATION of church and state clause. But I grew up in the US, maybe it's different here in Canada?<br>  <br>  Or has my friend Turtle finally got his wish and made homosexuality a religion?!?!?! That would so effin cool!|`|wW7OIHcAaa	I'm sorry but I don't quite get what you're saying? The homosexuals have taken over my computer too.|`|TyRfv0eoaa	Wait a minute... you stepped in WHAT????|`|OsxQNDHzaa	Were you dropped on your head as a baby?  We're tyring to do the complete opposite!!  :@)|`|wnSvjwWuaa	Did you miss out on the monthly newsletter?<br>  <br>  What gay people want and are fighting for is the COMPLETE OPPOSITE of your misinformed and misguided assumption: We are not after religion accepting us, we want the governments (of the world) to recognize our unions so we can (and should) have equal rights with straight people BEFORE THE LAW, not some deity or god.<br>  <br>  We want religion to STAY OUT of legislation and public policy, especially when it has dire legal implications and consequences, like gay parents being torn away from their children, or employers having an absolute right to fire an excellent employee just because the employee is gay.<br>  <br>  It's quite obvious that you're the only fool/idiot here. (And don't bother acting all aghast that we call you that - you called us that, if you can dish it, you sure as hell should be able to take it.)<br>  <br>  Facts, not moronic ideas and opinions, are what matter. Get some.|`|FR5ttYfFaa	I SO totally get what you're saying! I had that dream last night too!!!<br>  <br>  EDIT: OK, serious answer now. Yes, religious people claim that homosexuals are denying them their rights (like fighting for gay marriage, etc). But you see, homosexuals (that's us) have an argument too. They believe that religious people are denying them THEIR right to believe what THEY wish to believe in this free country.<br>  <br>  So if 2 sides have the right to believe what they want, but it's only possible for ONE to actually have their way, what is their to do? The answer is that, religion stays out. That was the solution the founding fathers had in the first place. Because everyone has different religious beliefs (or lack thereof) and everyone has the right to their beliefs. But that system causes problems because the government can only work one way, you cannot have the government work in favor of EVERYONE'S beliefs, it's simply not possible.<br>  <br>  So then, you must be wondering why we believe the government should side with us? Because religion is unsubstantiated. You cannot prove to me that religion happened. You can tell me that the bible is true, blah blah blah, but there is no way for you to PROVE to me that it is true. HOWEVER, nearly every mental health organization has said that homosexuality is not a mental illness and is not abnormal. Therefore, the government should be on that side.|`|tVUBqdSzaa	rewind, for a second. what are you talking about?<br>  =ppppppp|`|d7oz9FV6aa	I think I have a more important question: Why are you on here?
FmazIF6Maa	Yes, I believe in magic. I don't believe in the concepts of "black" and "white" magic... that's mainly from fiction.<br>  <br>  Magic is energy, like electricity, it's neither good nor evil. And what constitutes "right" or "wrong" uses largely depends on the morals and ethics of the culture/religion that is using it. <br>  <br>  For example, to a Christian, a Wiccan doing a protection spell may be considered evil, while in Wicca there is nothing wrong with casting spells for things you need. But in Wicca, prayer is considered a type of magic, and praying for someone to be converted to Christianity without that person's permission would be considered a violation of free will and therefore unethical. So a lot is on how you view it.<br>  <br>  <br>  Magic is usually not what people expect because of centuries of sensationalized stories from superstitious Christians, charlatons who tricked and scared people, and horror fiction. They are waiting for special effects, and it doesn't work like that. Real magic is subtle, it's part of nature. It doesn't deliver your desires on a silver platter without the work, it just gives a boost to the goals you are working for in your life. <br>  <br>  Real magic is like making an herbal tea to cure a sore throat-- but then science figured out that herbs heal, so what was once magic is now science.<br>  <br>  Real magic is burning rosemary and meditating on an orange candle when you want to prepare your mind to pass a test-- then science came along and figured out that different scents and different colors have different effects on our brains, so that's also considered science in psychology.<br>  <br>  I think the problem is that people are looking for "proof" in a form of a magical effect that doesn't really exist... and real magic just isn't thrilling enough to spark any interest, it doesn't measure up to the fantasy, so it is poo-pooed as nothing special. So all magic ends up getting dismissed.|`|KKh8rikGaa	If you want it to be "real" bad enough, I'm sure you or anyone else could come up with instances where no other explanation would do except 'black magic",just be carefull in what you believe in, there is another side to this also, know what I mean.|`|QvF8dR7Taa	yes,its been recorded in the bible also and speaks of it a few times.i have done a little spell casting my self.don't just do it for fun,the results are anything but not funny,only use on people who deserve it.|`|q7fN0kIsaa	yes i do believe in magic.<br>  yes i have had experiences.<br>  yes i do believe real magic can be performed.|`|AA10356839	No. Luck maybe, but not magic.|`|gCXNTbP2aa	In the bible, it says that black magic does exist but you have to be a satanist to do it. do not do it for the love of God though, i do not want you to go to hell.|`|WPCATkoYaa	No I think movies and shows brainwash people into thinking it exists.|`|36sadBuVaa	no|`|dcISbhGyaa	yes it exists all right be very careful though if you are going to perform or practice it|`|sx7B4Xo8aa	INN A YOUNG GIRLS HEARTTT<br>  <br>  <br>  but yes haha i do believe magic exists...|`|FwJLD1uDaa	not that kind so much, but magic like spells and ghosts and fairies and such.
KBBonf97aa	There's way too much emphasis placed on the first kiss and I think a lot of people embellish about how great theirs were, since they're usually awkward and kind of clumsy.  When adults look back on first kisses, the stories seem to become larger with time (sort of like how their two-block walks to school become four-mile uphill treks through snow).  I think people exaggerate about how wonderful a first kiss is because we've all been conditioned to think of it as a significant life event, which it isn't.<br>  <br>  Truth be told, I can't remember my first kiss (and I wasn't drunk!).  I can't even remember who the guy was, since it was actually an insignificant event.  I'm sure I like him and all, but we weren't exactly soul mates.  But I've had some very memorable kisses since then!|`|AA11042493	My first kiss was a peck on the lips. It was the neighborhood boy who lived down the street(age 9). The other kids dared us to kiss, so we did. It was not romantic, it was sort of embarrassing because the other kid stared. Later when we went to high school he told me he had liked me me from that day on. I had a boyfriend at that time, so nothing else ever happened. Soon after that he was killed in a drug deal. I felt really sad about the first guy I kissed was dead :(|`|cucY09Xvaa	Lol, I wish it was!<br>  My first, non-kiss, was when I was 11, because we were pressured into it by friends.<br>  But the real kiss, well, backrow of the cinema, haha.

Usually one or the other. <br>  <br>  For instance; if an unattractive, slobbering male were to flirt with a pretty girl; she could say "Gag me with a spoon" to demonstrate the same thing she could by saying "Gag me."|`|R2iCzRjsaa	Old Valley Girl talk.

c90J0FuFaa	Elizabeth, It's home to me and has been for over 40 years. I'm glad you are proud of our state and trying to show others what we have to offer. Too often, people that have never been here base their opinions solely on what they've seen on tv or read in history books. There is no denying we have a troubled past but the Mississippi of today is not like it was back then. We are still segregated for the most part but so are other areas in the country.<br>  As for the health and education, our critics are right to put us down. We continuously rank near the bottom of most health and wellness categories and while not everyone is overweight, we have higher rates of heart disease and diabetes than most other states. Part due to poverty and lack of education and partly due to  the fact that southern food is so darn good.<br>  I used to worry about what others thought of us too until I traveled outside the area and realized most folks don't dwell on it as much as we do. We want to defend out state because we're always being ridiculed by others. Most of them have never been here and say it just to make themselves feel better. Don't worry about them. Keep being proud of Mississippi but also recognize that some of their views are justified....and we need to work to make that not the case. <br>  I've lived in the big city and traveled all across the US and Mississippi has some of the warmest people you'll find. I hope you stay here and continue to make it a better place.|`|ca6c1bac92d16664e751aef99dc02c33aa	when i think of mississippi, i think along the lines of what you said about "some of the most beautiful scenery, rich in history, and above all, some of the sweetest people in the world live here."  i think of the mississippi river...<br>  <br>  and you did not mention the food!  is there something wrong with delicious fried chicken, cornbread, or anything made with crab or shrimp??|`|lJHPiAa5aa	i went to mississippi for the first time two summers ago and i swear i thought i was going to see nothing but trees with nooses and red necks with straw sticking out the side of their mouths lol but that was just a stereotype i had to clear up..i will say the mosquitos are freakin HUMUNGOUS lol and they're is to much damn grass its just wayyyy different than cities up north considering i grew up in chicago lol|`|AA10535085	Lived in Mississippi part of my life, attended Southaven High School the year after it opened.

Tvc6Tmz5aa	If you are referring to the horoscopes in the daily newspaper then no. If they were, only 12 different things would be happening to everyone in the world on that particular day. Having your chart done by a competent astrologer is something quite different altogether. If done properly, it can provide you with a surprising amount of insight and guidance. They are based on your exact day and time of birth as well as the location. They are exclusive to you and much more personal than just saying "I'm a Leo or Cancer" therefore this is how I am.|`|wTMMG0enaa	well, the fortunes in fortune cookies come true for me...and im a virgo|`|2PZnXjZ7aa	Ehhh, I'm a Geminius (Taurus/Gemini cusp.)

I might be biased, but I do have traits of both signs.) No wonder I was never found "unexpected riches" or was visited by "messengers of good news!" I haven't found a accurate cusp horoscope.

Twin studies are the most interesting, where twins were adopted out as infants and researchers went back and studied them later. In one case two brothers raised by very different types of families were both firemen and loved the same musical artist, had the same hobbies, etc. Then in another, both families were similar but the twins were not. <br>  <br>  You will have to research this one  alot and make your own choice here, psychology is as much an art as it is a science.<br>  <br>  As for the evilness, some people are cowards by day, and when they get to hide in their home and post they all of a sudden have big balls and want to take their miserable lives out on others, its pathetic.<br>  <br>  Some people have nothing better to do than rip on individuals who use intelligent time saving techniques and don't spell out all of their words...it's mostly the young generation that does this, so older people who have negative views are exhibiting ageism.
eb4e977a0cb9ce50b08bf74f0f3a0c61aa	Werewolves do not exist. The body cannot withstand that kind of change - you would die from cardiac arrest induced by massive system trauma long before you could resemble a wolf. It would require massive loss and growth of bone structure, reshaping of the skeleton, a complete rearranging of all major organs located in the torso as well as the nervous and circulatory systems. The skin itself would have to thicken and all your hair follicles would have to repattern themselves to grow fur. Lastly, the brain would change, and when you lose brain tissue you lose the memories and functions associated with it, such as in a stroke. If a person could change into a wolf, and then back, they would return to human form with the mental capacity of a wolf, and be a drooling idiot at best and a homicidal maniac at worst.|`|Da1bmBQnaa	maybe no ware wolf but maybe  the   chookacabra<br>  it is like a dog that sucks the blood out of its vivtims|`|ZswJ3toraa	yes my friend...<br>  i am infact part human part wolf<br>  <br>  i live in a fictional place called lala land|`|RoFTfke3aa	there are two types of werewolves. There is a m-shift werewolf and a p-shift werewolf. A M-shift werewolf does not physically turn into a wolf, only they think they are a werewolf deeply so at some points they go savage. Now, a P-shift werewolf includes alpha werewolves and beta werewolves. Alpha werewolves are the ones that can control themselves and change when ever they want. Then, beta werewolves are the ones that are uncontrollable. They have to change every full moon and they attack anything that breaths basically. The only way to become an alpha werewolf is to be born and beta werewolves come from being bitten by an alpha werewolf. If you are an alpha werewolf then you would start to notice it around 14 or 15 years of age, as this is when you are mature enough to change. The first few times you change will only be on a full moon and you will not notice it, but about 4 or 5 months later you will. Every night you will get Extreme pains as your body starts to change, and it's not like the movies how it happens fast. No, the change happens very slow at first, but over time it goes faster. Now, beta werewolves come from being bit by an alpha werewolf, saying you live. If you were a beta werewolf it would probably take you a while to notice. As you don't feel the change because you black out, and you always wake up normaly as there are no side effects. Like you don't get cravings for anything you don't feel hyper, nothing. As an alpha werewolf your wolf characteristics effect your human daily life.|`|XktkAZVfaa	I do not believe in them, but I am sure they originate from some other story that is probably really interesting. You should look up where the story of werewolves originated, who knows... maybe they are real??,  although it would take a lot of arguing to persuade me into believing.  Kind of like how the vampires of Transylvania originated from Elizabeth Bathory who was a serial killer who bathed in the blood of virgins, now I think that classic story is much more interesting than the fake vampire stories from todays age, because it was real and much more scarier.|`|0zr5YEJ6aa	my friend kyle is!|`|NgRiFZ7Baa	Those people who joke that they are werewolves are unaware that it's really not something to joke about.<br>  I'd really, really rather not message youso you can ask me questions... it makes me feel like an exotic animal when someone does that.<br>  I'm a half-werewolf. Half-werewolves are created by either being bitten by a half-werewolf, coming in contact with bodily fluids of a half-werewolf, or your mother becomes a werewolf while pregnant and gives birth before the subsequent full moon. I for one had intercourse with a half-werewolf, and that turned me. It's an odd experience, like out-of-body. Have you ever seen X2, X-Men United? It says exactly what it feels like when Scott Summers (Cyclops) and Kurt Wagner (Nightcrawler) are talking about the mind control - "I could see it happening but I couldn't stop myself".<br>  However, it's not a problem in my life, because of medicine that can be taken to stop the transformation. We lovingly call them "werewolf pills". These pills, when taken by a werewolf, stop the transformation on every night except the full moon. It happens every night, getting stronger as the moon grows fuller, and is at its peak on the full moon and nonexistent on the new moon. But the pills stop the transformation on every night except the full moon, so people only see them on the full moon... makes sense now, right?<br>  Werewolves were nearly eradicated by nervous people until it was determined that they were human enough to have human rights in their favor. This meant that they couldn't kill us, only "displace" us to "secure areas". Half-werewolves, however, can take the medicine every day because the transformation is never complete. So they can't really be tracked as sufficiently. Therefore, half-werewolves are still around and in much greater numbers...<br>  If you want to find a werewolf or a half-werewolf, look for these signs:<br>  1. Twelve hours after the pill is taken, it wears off and the person experiences a brief moment of anger and vicious temperament. It wears off quickly, but not quickly enough to be noticed if it's every day but the new moon. These anger issues become longer and fiercer as the full moon approaches.<br>  2. A werewolf will typically, as the full moon approaches, grow more energetic between noon and six in the afternoon. Watch for this.<br>  3. A werewolf will appear more tired as the full moon approaches. The lack of sleep is not damaging; in fact, it is unnecessary, but it looks as if otherwise. If a person accomplishes more than it seems there is time for, it may be because he doesn't sleep as much, because he's a werewolf.<br>  <br>  Look for these signs to locate the werewolf nearest to you. And to those who say it's physically impossible... of course it is! If it wasn't, it wouldn't be magic, would it?|`|gCXNTbP2aa	When you die and go to heaven you can be whatever you want.|`|dcISbhGyaa	Werewolves do exist as vampires do to........probably not here in this boring place called the U.S but they certainly exist in a certain part of Mexico|`|HEDSOHq1aa	yup, i'm a wolf (canis lupus)|`|GIomZTYPaa	so they say...its just fictional. sorry not real :/ but if you wanna belive it..you go right ahead! :DD

I have seen it a bunch of times.|`|yaj7NN9saa	Most guys are going to want to have sex AT LEAST every once in a while, especially on the wedding night.<br>  <br>  So I am guessing you will just have a VERY hard time finding a man, because most everyone has a sex drive, and it just so happens men crave more sex than women, generally speaking.<br>  <br>  So good luck, and may I ask why no sex?|`|9BFyrI0waa	Umm I think this is the wrong section to ask that. =] All the guys here are gay ...|`|8PA58u3kaa	honey, u'd be surprised how an opinion can change after a few years.

Right now you consider yourself Bi, but maybe you are a lesbian. You will not know until you see later on in life who you want to spend the rest of your life with. It might be a boy or it might be a girl. Just meet people and you'll fall in love with someone. It doesn't matter if it's a boy or girl as long as you love that person. Don't kill yourself over thinking what you are. You are you and that's it. You can't say if you're lesbian in one minute. It will take time for you to realize that.|`|FJPKtZN5aa	i think you are not bi i think your lesbian|`|H7ENkTxaaa	In that case the answer is yes.|`|lcGxxaYvaa	okay so have you ever dated a girl?<br>  (if you have not in the past three year you called your self by then your not that much of a lesbian are you) <br>  back to my question ........<br>  okay so have you ever dated a girl?<br>  how did you feel when you were with her?<br>  do you think it was better when you were dating a guy or a girl?<br>  but whatever you will know sooner or later1 good luck?|`|AA10832514	Its okay to be whatever you are.  You don't need a label to define yourself.  If you define yourself as a lesbian, you'll have trouble with dating a guy that you might really like.

AA11588233	Actually konnichiwa is hello or literally good afternoon<br>  <br>  Moshi moshi is something that Japanese people say when they answer the phone. <br>  <br>  So both pretty much imply "hello" bilut moshi moshi is over the phone.|`|AA10409832	If I'm not mistaken, Konichiwa, is the correct greeting.|`|hUhxjEWaaa	こんにち（今日）は　（konnichi wa)-is a general hello used during<br>  the day in person<br>  もしもし　（moshi moshi)- is used on the telephone<br>  both are polite, and saying moshi moshi when you know the person who's calling can be embarrassing|`|KiN3KVihaa	Konnichiwa (there are two 'n's in there) means "good afternoon," this is used for greetings during the day.  Ohayou(gozaimasu) is good morning, and konbanwa is good evening.  Moshi Moshi is used only when picking up the phone--I have never heard it used in face to face talk.  And besides, usual formal language is used on the phone until you know who exactly you are talking to just in case it is someone above you so you wouldn't accidentally be rude to them.<br>  <br>  "Moshi" means "if."  And what I have heard is that when the phone system was first being installed in Japan, it was not very reliable, so "moshi moshi" was the word used after picking up the phone as a way of saying "'if if' someone is on the other end."  I don't know if that is a true story though...<br>  <br>  "oi" is sometimes used as an informal greeting between close friends.<br>  <br>  Konnichiwa - こんにちは<br>  oi -おい<br>  moshi moshi - もしもし<br>  konbanwa - こんばんは<br>  ohayougozaimasu - おはようございます|`|837091b1bcd6524b4da0b21fb220b9a6aa	There are a lot of 'hellos' in Japanese depending on the situation.<br>  Mashi mashi is usually used as a non face to face 'hello' for phone calls and such.  Konnichi wa is a general 'hello' which is close to a good afternoon.  Also konbanwa is good evening. Yo is a really casual greeting among friends.  Ohayou is good morning.  Just wait until you want to say goodbye;)|`|WKUv05hpaa	I studied japanese for a couple years in college, and dated a japanese girl, so here goes...<br>  <br>  'konnichiwa' is something you would say during the day, and means roughly 'good day'. This would be funny to say at night, so instead you would say 'konbanwa', which means roughly 'good evening'. In the morning, you would say 'ohayo gozaimasu'.<br>  <br>  'moshi moshi' is used exclusively on the telephone, and would sound funny in person.|`|AA10978481	moshi moshi is usually used when answering the phone or in informal occasions between friends. (in english, it would be like saying, "What's up?" of something casual like that)  Konichiwa is more formal for everyday use like talking to people in passing.

They might look like h*ll on the outside, but be the most wonderful person on the inside. Your weight is just the outside beauty. To some people that is all that is important, but they aren't worth it anyway if that's all they care about it. I don't know your age, but you are probably still young and have lots of time to find the right guy. Hope this helps. :)

eb4e977a0cb9ce50b08bf74f0f3a0c61aa	Here is truth - read and understand. <br>  1. Vampires, defined as a humanoid being that MUST consume blood or energy to survive do not exist. Cut and paste time, as it is too much work to type this out over and over and I "recycle" my own answers instead of retyping them so here goes. A brief discussion of the human digestive system and then the probable vampire population given an exponential growth rate should explain why vampires are not possible. <br>  <br>  2. The human body is not designed to process large amounts of blood for nutrition. There is not enough protein, carbohydrates, and fats present in blood to maintain a complex creature such as Homo Sapiens or any theorized offshoot mutations. When a human ingests food it is first broken up into a bolus by chewing, then churned up in the stomach with digestive juices to form a mass called chyme. It then passes through the pylorus into the duodenum, part of the small intestine where it mixes with bile salts and secretions from the pancreas and liver which continue breaking it down on a molecular basis, mostly affecting fats at this point. The broken down nutrients pass through the wall of the intestines and into the bloodstream where they are carried to each cell or stored for later use. Indigestible bulk continues through the intestines, turning a dark brown from the bile. Water is absorbed from this mass in the large intestine depending on the needs of the body - a well-hydrated person will usually have a softer stool than a dehydrated person will. Water also enters the bloodstream, and this is what helps to maintain blood pressure. The pressure tends to balance itself in a healthy person because the bloodstream goes through a formation in the kidney called the Loop of Henle, where the narrowing blood vessel forces excess water and cellular waste such as urea out through the cellular wall into the kidneys, where it is excreted through the ureters into the bladder, and then out of the body via the urethral passageway.<br>  <br>  3. IMPORTANT - A person physically unable to process his own food for nutrition therefore also could not process blood - it's the same process. Ingested blood does not transmit directly to the veins anyway - it would be chemically broken down by the digestive system.<br>  <br>  4. Theoretical ingestion of blood to supply these nutrients would therefore have to occur at least once a day, and would require the ingestion of the entire blood supply which could not happen as the stomach is far too small to hold that much liquid volume. Hold up your clenched fist - under normal conditions your stomach is about that size. Furthermore, such a mass would be difficult to pass thru the intestines as it has no fibrous bulk, would create an intestinal impaction, causing massive vomiting from the large concentration of iron present, and any "real" vampire would have to eventually expel the waste, which would come out as a black, tarry, smelly goo, just as stool does when blood is present from a upper GI bleed. <br>  <br>  5. These humans that affect the whole "vampiric lifestyle" are NOT vampires. They are simply humans playing their own little game, in their own little fantasy world, usually pandering to their own little sexual fetish, which may or may not actually be sexual. I too, play my own little game, in the SCA, but mine is a game where the deeds that I do are determined by the strength of my arm and sword - I am a warrior, with just as much skill and ability as any warrior of ancient times. The difference is that I am claiming to be something physically possible: a warrior, and I prove it everytime I strap on my armor and walk onto a SCA battlefield. The so-called "vampires" are claiming to be something physically impossible: a walking corpse, and all they prove is that black Victorian clothing, a pair of false fangs, and a little makeup make for a good Halloween costume - it does not make you a vampire.<br>  <br>  6. Even if a vampire feeds once a week, and his victim also becomes a vampire, that is exponential growth, with four iterations a month. First iteration: One makes one, total two. Second iteration: Two make two, total four. Third iteration: Four make four, total eight. Fourth iteration: Eight make eight, total sixteen. 16 vampires at the end of one month, 256 at the end of the second month, 4096 by the end of the third month, 65,536 by the end of the fourth month, 1,048,476 at the end of the fifth, and 33,572,832 vampires at the end of half a year! By way of comparison, there are currently approximately 33 million people who have HIV/AIDS in the U.S. alone, and the disease is a world-wide epidemic. I see people every day in the hospital with AIDS, but never has there been one documented case of a vampire attack. Do the math - vampires are a mathematical impossibility. As for the idea that vampires existed "a long time ago" consider the estimated global population 5,000 years ago - using the above mathematical rationale, a single vampire could have taken over and converted every human on the globe in less than two years. This falls therefore, under the logic of Occam's Razor - which states that when you have removed every impossible answer, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth. Since there is no "vampiric plague" swarming the earth, the logical deduction is that they don't exist.<br>  <br>  7. Point of clarification about "vampire" bats: vampire is simply the name we have given them because they do drink blood, same as a flea, mosquito, leech, or spider. Are these creatures vampires? No. They are living creatures, not legendary monsters. They can subsist on blood because of their smaller size and proportionately larger stomach volume. Drinking blood does not make you a vampire anymore than eating raw meat makes you a werewolf, although it might make you a mosquito.<br>  <br>  8.The humans who profess to be vampires are victims of an all-encompassing self induced delusion. They are as human as you or I, regardless of their claims, and if they ingest HIV tainted blood they can most certainly contract the disease, esp. if they have any cuts, sores, or lesions in and or around their mouth. It is a very dangerous delusion to be laboring under. Note that there is absolutely no scientific or medical proof that these people derive any benefit at all from the ingestion of blood, and even worse are the so-called "psychic" vampires, because their delusion is one that they cannot substantiate with any concrete evidence at all.<br>  <br>  9. There is no "vampire" gene. People are not "born" as vampires. When a woman goes to the hospital for prenatal care there are many tests done on mother and child, even while still in the womb, to check for many things, including genetic anomalies that result in deformities and birth defects. If such a gene existed, in today's world with today's technology it would have been found - we have already completely sequenced the human genome. It would also have to follow Mendel's law of dominant/recessive gene theory. Again, the odds on that many "vampires" all escaping the notice of the medical/scientific community are so low as to be almost nonexistent. The idea that there is a global "vampire community" engaging in controlled breeding to keep the "bloodline pure" is delusional in the extreme.<br>  <br>  10. There is no "vampire virus" - as I have already pointed out, HIV is a virus, and look at how fast it has spread - virtually everyone knows someone with the affliction. According to the "vampire websites" there are "thousands" of vampires running around. If that was so then at least one of them has ended up in a hospital for bloodwork when they became pregnant, had a bloodborne infection, was injured in a car wreck, etc, etc, ad nauseum. The anomaly would have been detected and medical science would have isolated it, studied it, applied for research grants on it, published papers on it, and turned it into the talk of the medical and scientific community, as well as making its "discoverers" celebrities and rich beyond their dreams. A virus cannot alter your DNA in such a radical fashion without killing you.|`|Lk4aCBACaa	Ok people she didn't say "vampire," she said "psi vampire" by which I assume she means "psychic vampire" not the blood-drinking kind. It has to do with psychic energy, or the electromagnetic field that we all have, though I'm personally undecided on how much of this stuff I believe.<br>  <br>  Do a google search on Michelle Belanger.

Firstly, stay attuned. If you think you're stealing energy from a person, then start focussing on them - tell them a story/joke/sing them a song whatever - DON'T let them do all the talking. If you dont feel like you can control it, sit with your arms and legs crossed. Try to draw energy from the whole world, not just one person.<br>  <br>  Keep your energy levels up (also make sure your chakras are balanced if you know how) eat well and exercise a little (just 30 minutes of fast walking every day does wonders).

But be careful about letting the feeling escalate, so that you are unable to function.  Most do feel a little weird around strangers...that's why they're called strangers.  But you have a little script you are playing in your head that says, "I am not what these 'strangers' expect me to be"--as if.  No one has such an agenda of expectations and if there is anything at all to those feelings, do not take anything personally.  I can't say that enough.  DO NOT take things personally.  No one is judging you.  At the same time, if you find you are "feeling everything", focus.  The world is a big place.|`|Ji1DVABtaa	No dear, you're not weird.

We directed Moses by revelation when his (thirsty) people asked him for water: 'Strike the rock with your staff;' out of it there gushed forth TWELVE springs so that each group knew its own place for water.

Allah, to whom belong Might and Majesty, said:<br>  <br>  "Today I have perfected your religion and completed my bounty upon you, and I was satisfied that Islam be your religion." (Quran 5:3) <br>  <br>  The following Sunni commentators mentioned that one or some or all of<br>  the mentioned verses of Quran (such as [5:67] which was about the Allah's<br>  order to Prophet for announcement of appointment of Ali, [5:3] which was<br>  about completeness of religion, and [70:1] which was about the curse of<br>  a person who became angry at the Prophet for this announcement) were<br>  reported to have been revealed in the event of Ghadir Khum:<br>  <br>  1. Ibn Jarir al-Tabari (d. 310), in "Tafsir al-Bayan"<br>  2. al-Jassas (d. 370), in "Ahkam al-Quran"<br>  3. al-Hafiz Abu Nu'aym (d. 430), in "Asbab al-Nuzool"<br>  4. al-Tha'labi (d. 427 or 437), in "Tafsir al-Tha'labi"<br>  5. al-Wahidi (d. 468), in "Asbab al-Nuzool"<br>  6. al-Qurtubi (d. 568), in "Tafsir Jamiul Hukam al-Quran"<br>  7. al-Fakhr al-Razi (d. 606), in "al-Tafsir al-Kabir"<br>  8. al-Khazin Baghdadi (d. 741), in "Tafsir al-Khazin"<br>  9. al-Nisaboori (8th century), in "Tafsir al-Nisaboori"<br>  10. Ibn Kathir (d. 774), in his "Tafsir" (complete version) under the verse<br>      5:3 (It is ommitted in coincise version!) narrated from Ibn Mardawayh.<br>  11. al-Hafiz Jalaluddin al-Suyuti (d. 910), in his "Tafsir"<br>  12. al-Khatib al-Sharbini, in his "Tafsir"<br>  13. Abu al-Saud al-Hanafi (d. 972), in his "Tafsir"<br>  14. al-Aloosi al-Baghdadi (d. 1270), in his "Tafsir"<br>  ... and many others.<br>  <br>  Imamat is the Grace (Lutf) of Allah which attracts mankind towards His obedience and keeps them away from His disobedience, without compelling them in any way. When Allah orders mankind to do something yet He is aware that either they can not do it, or it is very difficult for them to do it without His assistance, then if Allah does not provide His assistance, He would be contradicting His own aim. Obviously, such negligence is evil according to reason. As such, Grace (Lutf) is one of Allah's character, and He is purified/exalted from inadequacy of lacking such attribute. In fact, the holy Quran states that: "Allah is Gracious to His servants..." (Quran 42:19). And, there are many other places that Almighty uses the word Grace (Lutf) in His book. See for instance, 6:103, 12:100, 22:63, 31:16, 33:34, 42:19, 67:14, etc.<br>  <br>  The messengers of God were entrusted the responsibility of bringing new commandments from Allah to the people. They were warners as Quran testifies. However, some of the messengers were Also Imams/Guides. The successors of the last Messenger of God were not messengers/prophets, and as such, they did not bring any new massage nor did they cancel any of the regulations set by the Prophet (PBUH&HF). They just served as guides and guardians of religion. Their mission is to explain, elaborate Shari'a (Divine law) for the people. They clear up confusing things and events which may happen in each era. Also they are the only individuals who have the full knowledge of Quran and the Sunna of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH&HF) after him, and as such, they are the only qualified people who can properly interpret the verses of the holy Quran and explain its meaning, as mentioned in Quran itself (See 3:7 and 21:7).<br>  <br>  Imamat is a great bounty of Allah, because when people have a righteous leader who guides them, they can get closer to righteousness and depart from corruption and deviations in the matter of religion. A divinely appointed Imam is also the most liable person to rule as the head of the community who can maintain justice and remove oppression. Of course, people have been given free will and can refrain from accepting the Imam, but they will be held responsible for that, as was for the case of the prophets. Nonetheless, the Imam would remain as a Proof of God on the earth and as spiritual leader for the believers among people who benefit his guidance.<br>  <br>  =======================<br>  <br>  Superiority of the Imam <br>  <br>  =======================<br>  <br>  The Shi'a believe that, like the prophets, a divinely appointed Imam should excel the community in all virtues, such as knowledge, bravery, piety, and should possess complete knowledge of divine law. If he does not, and Allah entrusts this high position to a less perfect person when a more perfect person is available, the inferior has been given preference over the superior, which is wrong rationally, and is against divine justice. Therefore no inferior person may receive Imamat from Allah when there exists a person superior to him. <br>  <br>  =========================<br>  <br>  Infallibility of the Imam<br>  <br>  =========================<br>  <br>  If a divinely appointed leader is not infallible (Ma'sum), he would be liable to errors and to deceive others as well. In such a case, no implicit confidence may be placed in his sayings/commands/actions. A divinely appointed Imam is the most liable person to

iLFYj6Qgaa	No, if your name means candy in French, it will not necessarily mean candy in English, because the word for candy is not the same in both languages.<br>  Names are universal, they don't have to change because you change languages, but the meaning in a specific language will always remain related to that specific (original) language.|`|gZ0NPuleaa	Your name is your name .You pronounce it as you like.

QFLtTeKEaa	Foster homes can be just as bad or worse than the home that a person leaves and your friend may be placed with other foster kids who have serious problems.  This decision needs to be made carefully and consider also that CPS isn't always interested in self-referral cases even when abuse is involved (I know from personal experience as a youth).    <br>  <br>  Your friend needs to talk to an adult that he or she trusts.  This should be someone who could advocate for them like a teacher, school counselor, or someone respected in your community.  <br>  <br>  You are being a good friend to this person by trying to find solutions and caring as much as you do.  Hang in there and good luck.  These things take time.|`|aWcD7Ou5aa	You can't apply to become an orphan or a foster child.

MYO2k9EUaa	I think her skin is darker because the Atlantian people live outside (in their bubble), not sheltered as much under buildings who shield pale persons. <br>  <br>  Living "outside" for thousands of years (evolution) causes the skin of a person to produce melanin, a pigment that colors people's skin and protects from the sun's ultraviolet rays. Eventually, all descendants of that person have this darker colored skin, even if they don't use it.|`|eYwzlsk4aa	Hmm...interesting.

AA11374158	An interesting question.  Firstly, there's no Nobel Prize for maths; just medicine, literature, chemistry physics and peace.  I'm an ex maths teacher and I live in NZ.  All the Asian students I've taught have been good at maths; Japanese, Chinese, Indian and Korean, not just Chinese.  For what it's worth, I think it's because they all work hard, especially the ones from cultures with a Confucian element.  With all due respect to my fellow Kiwis, the three predominant groups of settlers here, Brits, Maori and Pacific Islanders, are lazy buggers, and English speaking people in general tend not to value education.  We've had it too easy.
pzY0ARqDaa	How can you begin your own coven? First off you need to ask yourself if you're ready, have the knowledge and wisdom to be a spiritual leader of a group of people who are coming to you to learn. Having the title Priest, Priestess or Shaman isn't enough. Especially if that title is from a self dedication. <br>    <br>  That's not a put down, it's practical experience. Someone who has not worked within a gathering doesn't necessarily know what it takes to run a gathering. That experience of working with others is part of the process to learning the wisdom of a pagan practioner and especially as a High Priest or Priestess or whatever the title. <br>    <br>  Taking on the role of a coven leader is a huge responsibility and requires more than just knowing a few basic concepts of pagan beliefs. And on top of the knowledge is the wisdom to know when and how to share it. How to help those who come to you without interference in their path of learning. You can't learn for others. A teacher doesn't teach until a student is ready to ask a question, because until then, the student may not be ready to learn. Forcing them down a path they are not ready for is a kin to interference, not the wisdom of leadership. Everyone is in the right place, for their current progression to enlightenment. Don't push people who are not ready to be guided. <br>    <br>  As a teacher, do you now how to plan for a class? Do you have the understanding and wisdom to teach the topic you are offering? Have you been a tarot reader for a year and now think you are ready to teach? Each person is different, but a year of study and practice, may not be enough. <br>  <br>  You will need to know how to create training material, and class schedules. How to develop a lesson plan or a curriculum for advancement within your gathering. <br>    <br>  In addition to the teaching, you will be taking on the role of spiritual advisor. Do you have the knowledge and more importantly the wisdom to take on this awesome responsibility? You will be looked upon as a spiritual counselor, do you have the understanding of psychology to take on this role? There are organizations around the country who offer counseling training for ministers. I highly recommend them. <br>    <br>     Setting The Foundation <br>  You will also have to face all the management issues of running an organization. To a coven leader a gathering is also a business, with business issues and demands. The biggest thing that destroys new organizations isn't lack of membership, but rather lack of leadership and planning. Being able to handle the leadership role, conflicts, dramas and responsibilities of a group are all key talents that will be utilized and needed. <br>    <br>  Here are a few things you will need to think about. <br>  You must set the foundation of your coven. That starts with the basics. <br>  A business plan. <br>  A business license or other legal licenses for your county or state. <br>  A checking account separate from your personal account. <br>  You will have to prepare accounting documents for all donations and or money you take in. <br>  You will also have to prepare federal and state tax returns.<br>    <br>  Even if you don't bring financial services into your group, you will need to define a Charter for your organization. This will include (and it's not limited to these): <br>  Principles Of The Coven <br>  Principles Of Belief <br>  Clan Troth <br>  Dedication and Initiations <br>  Code Of Ethics <br>  Press Releases<br>    <br>  As the leader of a group such as this, you will still face other management issues. Do you have the skills to handle conflict? Do you have the knowledge to execute conflict resolutions between members? Do you have the wisdom to handle conflict when it arises against you as the leader of the group? Do you have the strength to put down discord and help balance or resolve issues or mini-dramas? Do you have the strength to ask someone to leave your group if necessary? Do you have the strength and wisdom to squash petty fights that unjustly become directed at one member of your group? Can you remain above the personal relationships or friendships that can create favoritism from you and create unfairness within your group? <br>    <br>     Community Building <br>  Do you have the knowledge of community building. Regardless of the effort you put into the foundation work, your gathering will not be successful unless you can advertise it's offerings, and be part of your community. Attract members and provide valuable services to those who join you. Not to mention include a bit of fun. <br>    <br>  Do you have the knowledge to plan rituals, and direct them with other members. One of the biggest problems with a gathering leader is they often forget that not everyone is on the same level. Even those who have attained the wisdom to run a gathering sometimes forget they need to 'hand hold' new members. This isn't ego or arrogance, it's just part of their nature. They do things by osmosis, because it comes natural to them, and they forget that others may not be aware of those things. One big example, is|`|kN00x0Vaaa	Starting your own Coven takes experience, and not just book experience.

pzY0ARqDaa	Being a Wiccan or Witch is generally not something you are born as or just wake up one morning and decide to become. More often than not, you come across it by accident unless you were raised that way. Many find the philosophies of how Wicca and Witchcraft view nature are the same as the one's they currently hold. They just didn't know there was a specific belief system that shared the same views. <br>  <br>  As Silver RavenWolf accurately stated in her book To Ride A Silver Broomstick. "The Charge comes to each of us in a different manner. It is that moment in our lives when we feel the Magick of the Universe for the very first time coursing through us... and we know beyond all real and imagined shadows that this calling to the mysteries is indeed there. That it is truly there, and not a whimsical flight from reality." <br>  <br>  If you are one who has seen striking similarities between what you believe and have found here, there are generally accepted ways to increase your awareness and find communion with others who feel the same. The following are the steps I would recommend to any one who wishes to learn more. <br>  <br>  Read everything you can get your hands on that will tell you more about the beliefs of Wicca and Witchcraft. Only by learning as much as you can about the basic beliefs and tenets of this path can you decide if the old way's are right for you. <br>  <br>  While doing this, you will begin to form associations and hopefully find correspondances within yourself. Note these feelings in a journal or diary. Write down the reasons you think Witchcraft is your path. What does being a Witch mean to you? What do you hope to achieve and learn? What do you fear about following this path? How do you see the Goddess and God? What does the Divine mean to you? Be absolutely honest with yourself here, this is a private book and nobody else will ever read it. This notebook will help you design your dedication/self-initiation ritual and eventually evolve into your Book of Shadows. <br>  <br>  There are no right or wrong answers and it is not a test. It is only a way to help you define your understanding of this path. <br>  <br>  Most importantly, listen to your inner voice. It is usually very good council and will not lead you astray. If something you read, hear or are told does not feel right, then it usually isn't right for you. If everything still feels right and you are sure Witchcraft is the path for you wish to follow after all this studying, now is the time to perform a dedication ritual. <br>  <br>  This ritual should be yours and yours alone. Design it however you want to and in a way that will be most meaningful to you. A dedication ritual means exactly what it sounds like. You are dedicating yourself to the Craft and making the decision to live life in closer harmony and balance with the earth and nature. You are making a commitment to yourself and the Divine. <br>  <br>  Mine was on the shore of a remote high cascade mountain lake here in Oregon. The dancing light of the campfire on the trees, a full moon reflecting off the snow pack fed waters of the lake all combined with the energy of surrounding nature. This setting was ideal for me but something completely different might be right for you. <br>  <br>  I haven't mentioned anything about spells because you need to complete the first two steps before you even think about working with spells. <br>  <br>  Before you begin working with magick, you need to understand what it is, where it comes from and the ethics involved. You will also need to learn and understand the basic structure of rituals, Casting circles, calling quarters, invoking the Goddess and God, raising and directing energy, grounding, centering and closing the circle. <br>  <br>  Magick is raising and channeling the energy found in yourself, nature and in the Divine. A Witch combines this energy with their focused efforts. It takes dedication, effort, energy and hard work to achieve a desired result. The main ethical tenet to always remember is the point of the Witches Rede: <br>  <br>  <br>  "An It Harm None." <br>  <br>  <br>  Magick is not Hollywood hocus-pocus. It is not bending the natural order of things to fit your needs or desires. If that is what you are looking for, you are in the wrong place. <br>  <br>  Witches have had enough bad press over the past few centuries and are working hard to turn those misconceptions around. We do not need people running around claiming to put spells and hexes on people because they cannot face reality, are not willing to work for what they want or are looking for an easy solution to their problems. Magick doesn't work that way... <br>  <br>  All your reading and study will help you prepare for this. The Suggested Reading Section of our on-line catalog offer some excellent resources to help you understand these basic concepts. <br>  <br>  You will also find that meditation and visualization exercises will increase your concentration. The ability to focus and visualize will greatly increase the power of your magick. Breathing exercises will help you focus as well so spend time on them. <br>  <br>  If you are interested in joining a Coven, most will require the traditional year and a day of study before initiating new members. This gives you time to explore the religion and decide if it is the right path for you as well as giving you and the Coven members time to get to know one another. Covens are generally very selective and rightfully so. There are many out there who seek this path for all the wrong reasons. <br>  <br>  Blessed Be and may your path be Bright!|`|gIf4xk3Paa	I would seriously suggest that you get more knowledge of the philosophy of the wiccan practice if you want to take up that faith. From what little I've read of Wiccan, it seems unique. Unlike some of the other rip-off religions that I've studied.<br>  <br>  You should get a good grasp onto what you are about to jump into before converting to a different religion. Knowing how to convert is essential to the learning process. If you don't know how to do that, then you haven't studied enough.<br>  <br>  Below my rant in the "what is your source?" text box, is good place to start. Or just Google (philosophy of wiccan). Good luck!|`|dFBccLExaa	Well, the best way to start is to read all you can, and then put it into practice. If you're not sure how to do that, you can email me, and I can walk you through the basics of how to get going. :)|`|vUSLyZzZaa	NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO...|`|FmazIF6Maa	You're right-- if you read enough, these are things you should already know. I'm not being rude, but might I suggest continuing your research?<br>  <br>  You become Wiccan basically when you learn about Wicca and decide you want to walk the path of the Wiccan religion and embrace the Wiccan rede. <br>  <br>  You could mark that with a ritual if you like, as a rite of passage to mark your decision. Or if you're over 18 seek out a coven to join.<br>  <br>  A "Book of Shadows" is a fancy name for your personal spiritual journal. You write whatever you deem relevant in it. Your feelings, things you've learned and your thoughts on them, your experiences, your dreams, favorite quotes, your favorite incense blends or favorite cookie recipes you come across, your ritual structure if you adapt a specific method. If you ever start practicing magic you can write info as you study and spells. You don't have to rush to put anything together, just start writing down what seems significant. Believe me if you keep up with it, it will grow quickly enough, there's no need to try and pad it just to have one.|`|Tvc6Tmz5aa	I'm guessing that you haven't studied Wicca: A Guide for the Solitary Practitioner by Scott Cunningham or Drawing Down the Moon by Margot Adler. Either one will be very clear and concise into providing answers to some of your questions. I noticed that another question you posted stated that you were already Wiccan and were attempting to form a coven. I don't mean to be rude by I'm guessing too that you really haven't researched deeply at all but are here looking for easy answers. Wicca is a faith that goes beyond covens and Books of Shadows. I am in no way trying to discourage you. Only hoping that you understand that Wicca is a way of life, not a passing fancy. Good Luck
65QqZBnjaa	"Sex change" minimizes the long, expensive medical process I went through.  My TRANSITION took 4.5 years and about $80,000.  Transition entails a million little details, not just one operation.<br>  <br>  As long as someone goes to one of the major surgeons they should have no trouble with being able to orgasm as  all the nerves are left intact.  As far as wetness goes the tissue used for my vagina slowly changes over a period of about 2 years to provide some moisture.  However, for most of us not quite enough for sex and so like lots of other women we use lube.  As far as appearance goes it fall within the normal range for natal women.  In other words: Men can't tell the difference.  Another key you're missing is hormones.  Long ago I started on estrogen.  For transexual women it changes our sexual response so that it's identical to other women's response.|`|VRsu7c3Paa	There are lots of sensitive nerve endings in a trans-womans vagina, and clitoris just like a biologically female would. Pretty much orgasms remain orgasmic. People can still get them post-op, and usually do unless there are complications from surgery.|`|AA11639059	Part of it is the art of the surgeon. Part of it is the response of your tissue to the change in hormones. Part of it, an important part, is between your ears.<br>  <br>  Most practices today preserve some of the same neural pathways so similar sensations will elicit appropriate responses. It isn't the same as the real, but some people come amazingly close.<br>  <br>  As for the MTF, the person usually retains the prostate gland. There will be a fluid flow for ejaculation, no sperm of course since the testicles were removed. Sometimes this also has minor secretions of lubricating fluid very much like in a woman's vagina, although it usually is very small, and sometimes doesn't happen at all. The glands that are analogous to the prostate that allow for a woman's response will probably be removed with the vagina, so a FTM will have some problems on this part. The mechanics is pretty different and satisfying surgeries are rare.<br>  <br>  Finally, the biggest and most important sex organ is your brain. I know of paralyzed men that still can get an erection even though they cannot feel or control anything below their waste. Their brain makes it happen (hormonal signals). Whatever the state of the changed equipment, if you experience a sexual euphoria, you will produce the same endorphins as if you had well working original equipment.|`|CDft5bscaa	im both cases the erectile organ still exists, mtfs have clitorises made from part of the head of the penis, ftm penises were once clitorises|`|vzicHzU5aa	I have always wanted to know this too.
ErXKMHGAaa	Both. It is mainly of Jewish decent, but it is also considered of German decent. Making it Germanic-Jewish.<br>  <br>  Fried or Friede in Yiddish means "peace" (not to be confused with the Hebrew "shalom").<br>  Man or Mann in Germanic means "man" or "maker of" - the name in its whole means "peacemaker".
QoOx93PPaa	Well, I think ten o'clock at night would be the general time at which they should start to quiet themselves down. I'd talk to them first, ask them to be a little quieter. If they didn't begin getting quieter at that point, I'd go and talk to the landlord. Give them a chance to do better before going to the owner.|`|faPKwClPaa	Any time it's affecting your life.  The time of day has nothing to do with it.  <br>  <br>  I'd absolutely talk to the landlord.  You have every right to live in your apartment in (relative) peace and quiet.|`|rJJhMQ37aa	10 PM.   Talk with the landlord.|`|vs5rK3iRaa	"Margie K" and "heart on my sleeve" have it right.  There is no excuse at any time for people in an apartment to be stomping and making a lot of noise.  They should be reported to the manager immediately.  You have a right to live in peace at all hours of the day, and not be disturbed by some inconsiderate neighbor.|`|4ZAZfT0Gaa	12:00 going|`|4a2eee5eefa1d6701c73d4bd94101010aa	10 pm.  I would first slip a note under the upstairs neighbor's door asking them nicely to please keep the noise down after 10pm.  The floors are not insulated and their sounds carry loudly down to your place where your infant is trying to sleep.  Often, people are just not aware of how much sound carries (once a friend from out of town was staying for a few days with me and we sat up talking and laughing and listening to old records until very late.  I thought we'd been pretty quiet but found out the next day the neighbor downstairs was fuming because we'd kept her up all night.  She didn't even bother to knock on the door to ask us to keep it down so we didn't know).  If the noise doesn't abate, talk to the landlord.  I know where I live there are laws that say after 10pm (I think that's the time) people have to keep things quiet unless you've notified your neighbors and whatnot ahead of time.|`|wpqJr2FMaa	9:30.<br>  Because the upstairs families never know who is downstairs.<br>  It could be a senile woman who can't hear a thing, it could be a family of two parents and a teenage kid who needs his rest, or it could be a mother with an infant.  <br>  <br>  You should definitely talk to them, and tell them bluntly that it is unacceptable to be making a lot of noise during the middle of the night.  I would not talk to them during an incident, but after or before, because it may be hard to talk to them when they are angry.  <br>  <br>  If they are not complying, you should talk to your landlord, because it is unfair for you to have to put up with noise at that outrageous hour.|`|0003a5b50268aea93401640c3a727d6faa	Unless this is some sort of frat house, anything after 10:00 which is unreasonable is reportable.  <br>  <br>  If you can move, do so, if not, report it in writing to landlord/management, then police.  <br>  <br>  There are kiddies involved and you as a mom supporting their welfare and deserve better.  <br>  <br>  Initially try to talk to them about this in a nice way.  Then, the gloves are off.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|A6PS0jRfaa	I'd say 10pm.I live under a family with two boys who are about 7 to 9 years old.They sound like they are playing wwf wrestling until the wee hours of the am 1 -2 am in the summer.I always shut down my noise by 10pm and try to restrict things like carpet cleaning and anything loud to my days off from work and then I do that stuff during the daytime when most are at work/school.I think people are just rude really.|`|K5IOSGXAaa	At whatever time you think it is too much. There is no set time, it is when it is interfering with your right to live. I would complain to the landlord and let them take care of it. Don't get personally involved.|`|ClZWgDoxaa	10 P.M. is probably the cut off for noise.. At least during the work week.. First try and talk to them, if that gets you nowhere, then move up to the big boys .. (landlord.)<br>  Good luck!|`|rNdun1V7aa	this should never happen. they should be respectful of you all hours of the day. ABSOLUTELY call your landlord.|`|KBaeecQzaa	For me it's unacceptable to hear noises at 9pm.|`|UTgz8yNnaa	i would talk to them and be like can you please quiet down a little bit and if they dont listen go to the landlord.|`|s9Uufsr0aa	9pm<br>  I'd try talking to then first, then the landlord if it continued.|`|DqL6I3MFaa	I would ask them (providing you know exactly who the person is) is they'd try to be more understanding about the entire situation. Chances are they may have not even been aware of their doings or didn't really think it mattered. But I'd definitely talk to them about it, not the landlord. We're all mature adults and we should go about things in that way.|`|64da92cd6c966448ac534cca1147e00aaa	i've lived in apartment buildings my entire life and 10pm is the median "quiet time"<br>  <br>  i would try talking with them first. they may not even be aware of the noise they are making, and it sets a better and nicer tone than going directly to the landlord. i lived somewhere and got a complaint via the landlord and i was so put off, like - why couldn't they just talk to me? that i wasn't very accommodating to reducing the noise (i was younger and stupider, but you get my point)|`|e6Kyqb22aa	Are they aware of your infant? I would say about 9:00pm but with a baby, my step-mom gets us to shut it at like 6:00pm...a little too early for other people to be tip-toeing...so yeah between 7:00 and 9:00. And talk to them first and then possibly if they simply are not understanding, your landlord. good luck!|`|olgdyKzEaa	I'd say 10pm at the latest if the upstairs people don't know the preferences of the downstairs people. Even earlier, 8:30 or 9, if there are young children (because they have earlier bedtimes than adults and older children).|`|clhmVg4Laa	dependingg on the main people in the apartment it could be 10 or if its a younger generation apartment building it could be 12.  I would probably talk to the landlord and say its kinda distracting.|`|71b5d9acd0e084b723a6c805c9cfd85daa	During the work week - I'd say 10:00 or 10:30.<br>  <br>  Weekends - 12:00.<br>  <br>  However, I bet there is something within the lease that talks to noises.  Check with the front office.<br>  <br>  You pay just as much rent as they do.|`|ZlWhnobDaa	about 10 or so. if theres old people in your apartment building cut it off at like 9 or so. its just polite.|`|6f3fe02b641ca65408cbb81afbfee8caaa	I consider 10:00 PM to be late, for making loud noises.  For "too late", it's going to be around 11:00 PM - 12:00PM+ .  <br>  I would consider 11:00 PM to be unacceptable when loud noises approach.  At 10:00, people should or should have been sleeping or getting ready to sleep.  Otherwise, it would be a noisy wreck.  If this is happening to me, I would call the Owner or Landlords to fix this problem.  Call them about your upstairs neighbors being very loud when the time is 11:30 at night.  If you go up to them and tell them that they are very loud, then they may as well just complain to you and give a fake excuse or anything they would do, because they know you are not the boss.  If the Owner/Landlord came to talk to them, then they will not complain, give a fit, probably no excuses, and they know that the Owner/Landlord is the boss, because they live here.<br>  Talk to the Owner/Landlord, you may not want to include your name, but include where they live.

suSWUm5Jaa	Ghost,<br>  <br>  Bonjour!<br>  <br>  You are right, Rosetta Stone is very expensive. And, in my opinion, waaaayyyy overrated (not good for grammar, sort of boring and surely not fun). On the other hand, you have to pay something to get a well-structured teaching, a real program, designed by experts.<br>  <br>  I have used Rocket French, which is really good, especially for speaking skills. It works great. If you devote sufficient time (15 minutes or so daily), you will learn fast. It is complete, serious though fun. Fun is important to learn a language because, as I have just mentioned, you need to study it everyday. You can download the program; it is cheaper than ordering the hard copy and it is much cheaper than Rosetta. If you don't like it, you ask your money back but really, it has worked great for me. Follow the program, be committed and you will reach a great level fast!<br>  <br>  Bonne chance!|`|WqZYpMwnaa	Byki.com is no doubt the best software i used and only at $50 bucks and its great!! I learn my spanish from it!! Check it out byki.com! I have RS in portuguese and i like byki better because you can even print flash cards and download it into your ipod and listen in bed or where-ever your at. Rocket French is super good to, better then byki due to it being fun with pictures and native speakers on the software you can talk with..
farAMKNpaa	No you're right.I think she's just saying that so she can keep her boyfriend.Just because he's darker doesn't make him black.African albino<br>  people are don't even look like black people,as you may have seen.They<br>  are as white as chalk but that doesn't matter,because they are still black.<br>  They were born in Africa and they will forever remain Africans.Skin color<br>  does not the change the race you are.So if the boy is Dominican,it doesn't matter how dark he is,he's still Hispanic.|`|NCvX4I0baa	In that case it doesn't really mean anything what race people are. The most important thing is that you remember what you are and where you came from. Knowing your cultures and tradition. You said "That means nothing" than why are you making it a big deal? Complexion pretty much defines race in a lot of cases. Being respectful of other race would also mean not setting a line between "your" race and "their" race.|`|XHCoIo3zaa	Hispanics come in all races.  A person can be both Hispanic and Black.  It is possible that the boyfriend is a Dominican with African roots.|`|WAoNhHB1aa	Why do you care?|`|yhfG07Jtaa	Dominicans are mostly descended from African slaves. They are black. Don't you ever watch major league baseball? <br>  Hispanic means he speaks Spanish. People in the Dominican Republic speak Spanish because it was a Spanish colony. Same reason that people in Haiti (the other half of the island that both nations occupy) speak French.<br>  Sounds to me like you need a basic course in the historical geography of the western hemisphere. Which is to say, sounds to me like you are culturally illiterate and happy to remain that way.|`|I2Tw4zOAaa	You are right that complexion has very little to do with race.  I am lighter than some white people in the winter yet I am still not white so your point is extremely valid.  However I do not know for sure if being from the Dominican Republic means he is necessarily Hispanic.  For instance my friend from Puerto Rico is black even though he speaks spanish as his first language.  Same with my neighbor from Haiti, she is clearly black in race despite having no direct African descent.  While I don't feel it should matter what his race is as long as he makes her happy, it is none of my business, therefore I have no right to try and change your mind.|`|INIJXLVCaa	Well...lol<br>  Hispanics are...interesting when it comes to defining race. I dont know if her boyfriend is Afro-Latino...but some hispanics of African descent would swear up and down they are Spaniards and want nothing to do with Africa. They dont like African Americans and refuse to relate to them...even if they look just like them. On the other hand you have Afro Latinos who relate more to their African heritage and just grow up feeling closer to their Black or African roots...a lot of it also depends on how they were raised. <br>  <br>  In your case and I am surprised that you  see hispanics as "one race" because thats far from true...thats like saying all Americans are "one race" of people.....<br>  <br>  You should take a trip to Latin America...preferably somewhere in South America..like Brazil or Colombia....you should learn about the history of that region so you understand the diverse racial makeup...|`|nBkHjCFQaa	well a hispanic is someone who is of spanish descent.<br>  <br>  its just like american, everyone in america calls themselves americans because they are from the US, Dominican is nationality just like American. African is an ethniticity.|`|pfke6Jieaa	many dominican ppl i seen were black. hispanic is not a race because anyone can be hispanic. its only a culture. maybe u should look at him again and compare him with a mexican. do they look the same?|`|itwZHhi8aa	You'd be surprised that alot of hispanic countries have people of african descent, especially dominicans.|`|h1Pxqz5vaa	Keep in mind that there is no such thing as race. We are all mixed up so as far as we know,he could be part black. who knows|`|pSliodDvaa	no interracial dating = racist<br>  <br>  all humans are the same race (the human race)|`|2nRjy734aa	Harriet said: "Am I right or wrong?"<br>  <br>  You are absolutely correct. Though I find it stupid (and a form of racial segregation against one's self), Hispanic people are allowed to choose which race (black or white) to classify themselves as. That's why you see on census forms "hispanic-white and hispanic-black." This is because in their lineage is a mixture of races. However, that's just what they are - a MIXTURE, or THEIR OWN RACE. A person who is the direct offspring of two or more races cannot lay claim to any 1 race. Though Dominicans have African ancestry, that is not the ONLY ancestry they have and therefore they are not only African or black. No matter what they "consider" themselves, they are the genetic makeup of their ancestors. Many are considered "black" because they are black-skinned, but that would mean some Arabs (who are classified caucasian), Eastern Indians, etc are also black. That's ludicrous. Skin color is only ONE genetic marker of a race. It does not give one right to claim it. You daughter's boyfriend is not black. <br>  <br>  You've got a good head on your shoulders, thinking on logic and not emotional attachment (like many answers here)!|`|MTkXXOsjaa	You're right on the account that race is race and skin color doesn't necessarily dictate race.  A white guy with tan skin is still a white guy.  A black woman with lighter skin is still a black woman.  As for "changing your mind" on the whole interracial dating thing, I don't think there's anything that needs to be changed.  Your daughter has the right to be with whoever she wants and it would only be for the better to respect her decision.  Er, unless the individual in question is a "bad seed" so to speak...|`|8d870d0a492b90cf08114f969a9cd21baa	You are wrong.  Many Dominicans consider themselves black and are of African decent.  Have you read about DR or the race/history of the people?  It is a spanish speaking country but what does that have to do with race.  Many Dominicans would be angry to be called black even if they are darker than you and relax their hair.  It depends on the person and there are all races of people in all countries.|`|86d6ceaf091a87fdb16c07d5c93ed356aa	"I don't agree with interracial dating, even though I respect people of all races"<br>  <br>  Ok, hypocrite..<br>  <br>  well Harriet...<br>  <br>  Your wrong because your daughter said hes blacker. Thus showing that HE never said anything about being blacker.<br>  So the better question is "Why does my daughter consider her boyfriend black?" <br>  And the answer is.. "Because shes an idiot like her mother" That's why.|`|YeZvTjFtaa	You are a Racist get over yourself!<br>  <br>  Shyt my mother would be out of her mind to tell me that.  Where do you get your crazy ideas from?  You can't judge someone b/c of their race.<br>  <br>  Wow,, how immature, are you sure you are old enough to have a daughter?  You sound so juvenile and immature.|`|71b5d9acd0e084b723a6c805c9cfd85daa	I think it is confusing to your daughter to hear that you respect people of all races .... unless they try to date your daughter.<br>  <br>  You have done a great job of teaching her that all races are equal... but a poor job of teaching her your prejudice.|`|34AOmnycaa	He very vell may be. Hispanic isn't a race. He probably is black and also is Dominican, just like Sammy Sosa|`|2JSNqBomaa	Because he finds people that are black to be more popular than he is therefore he considers himself black|`|LcxgPUjCaa	ok he is hispanic and there is nothing wrong with africanAmericans and Latinos to date each other.<br>  The most beautiful people i know has been born from and interracial couple!|`|ly0DIyoqaa	she means that he acs blacker in a more ghetto way and your more conservative i could say if you wouldn't mind|`|zF4LUzJcaa	Well since you respect ppl of all races, then you should give him a chance other than making ur daughter persuade. (*_*)|`|3r252UIRaa	No. Hispanic is not a race. Most Dominicans are black.|`|l1ctIW7eaa	you're wrong because you don't respect people of all races if you don't agree with interracial dating

It gives you a behind the scenes perspective. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD...read the book b4 u watch the movie...|`|cMZEmpp0aa	Whatever you do, do NOT use "Memoirs of a Geisha" as a reference about geisha. It's kind of lacking in the accuracy department. <br>  <br>  Anyway, the tea ceremony isn't something limited to geisha. A geisha would perform the same kind of tea ceremony as a non-geisha. So instead of looking for tea ceremony info that specifically mentions geisha, you would probably be alright finding information on the tea ceremony in general. You could also talk about special events that involve tea ceremonies, like Baika-sai.

Unless you were born under a rock and never met another human being, someone would know, someone would care and many more would cry and mourn.  I imagine that you think you aren't worth having around or worth dealing with.  You may have made some mistakes and think that choice is the way out.  You think people would be better off without you.  You couldn't be more wrong.  Trust me, I know.  We dealt with this when my 13 year old son's best friend (whose sister is my 15 year old daughter's best friend) made that choice just ten weeks ago.  He didn't comprehend the amount of people who continue to cry for him.  You are in a different place with different people, but the outcome would be the same.  Like you, he didn't think people wanted him around or noticed him.  He was wrong and so are you.  His father, step mom, mom, sister, my children, my husband, myself, teachers, old friends he hadn't seen in a while, cousins, his church family and hundreds more that came to say goodbye all noticed, cried and were forever changed.  We noticed and cry, but he never believed that we would have given anything to have him here.  You need to reach out and you will find people who want you, no matter what your faults.  Please, don't put people through this, they would rather help you than bury you forever.  Anything you are going through that has you down will eventually go away.  It is hard to foresee when you are depressed, but if you get help, in a year or so, you will look back and realize that most all problems are temporary.  You will probably look back and be thankful that you didn't make a sad, PERMANENT choice for a TEMPORARY problem.  <br>  Look at all of the people who responded so quickly to you.  We care and would notice.  We would be affected because we would have failed you.  These are strangers trying to reach out to you.  That is because we all know that one person makes a difference.|`|qXf9zfJ4aa	im not 100% sure but i do believe its also a sin. <br>  <br>  <br>  WHOEVER gave me the thumbs down go **** yourself. dude if you wanna kill yourself go right ahead. im not gonna stop you|`|fgvBhOL1aa	Suicide is seen down upon. Suicide is a sin because life is seen as a way of God's love. <br>  Suicide affect people even though you do it quietly. For example, the people that find you dead would try to connect to everyone you know and they would have to waste their time figuring the reason behind it.|`|yuVh6pFCaa	yes   if your destroy your self you are destroying a temple  you are the light that beacon of hope  he want you to shine in the dark world|`|Goxj1meyaa	yes, a boy in my school just commited suicide by jumping of the building two days ago.  it affected me so greatly i cannot even explain, i didnt even know him.  <br>  it always affects people. please please please dont do it.  its a mistake and im sure there are people who care for you.<br>  its not worth it<br>  and spiritually speaking, yes its a crime against god, it says it in the bible.|`|e4yNSpiGaa	the first thing wrong is the misery you'll leave behind with anyone who may have loved you. the second thing wrong is, if by chance the bible is true, then your not going to have a very pleasant after life.<br>  you should decide for yourself. hell, here on earth, where you can change things, or hell in the pitts of an unforgiving, unrelenting, barbarack and sinister fallen' angel who will end all your chances for change or happiness. there you will burn far worse than anything you've imagined, and there will be no resporators.<br>  bobby|`|fRBZSVvIaa	Look don't do it, and yes everything is wrong with suicide!|`|05d37286bed96dc28e6b203a5182c768aa	Yes It's murder, you are murdering yourself & causing your family & loved ones suffering.<br>  I've often wondered what goes through the mind of someone that kills themselves, how sad they must be, and how much pain they are going through for one to end their precious life.<br>  People that kill their family and then themselves are just plain sick &/or demented. They have a problem, a mental problem.<br>  Romans 6:7 says death pays the penalty for our sins, I do not know about self induced death? Only the Creator knows that one.|`|Tmmm02Woaa	The only time I think suicide should be implemented is if you have committed a crime....then by all means off yourself because I don't want my tax dollars going to pay for you to rot in prison the rest of your life...other wise buck up and face your problems....oh yeah and it will affect someone...even if you do not know a single person in this world it will at least affect the person that has to wrap up your dead body and haul you off.|`|epE3uvMVaa	it will always affect someone/ ALWAYS|`|noF0WCkUaa	I agree with Skittles. There is no possible way that suicide won't affect anyone. Life's too interconnected to avoid it. Plus, there is no telling exactly why we are in this world, and for that reason should not retreat out of it. <br>  <br>  Through suicide we cheat ourselves. We let the 'dread' win. You WANT to rise about the 'dread'. <br>  <br>  That's just how I see it.|`|bOhvvbUIaa	If your talking spiritual. your spirit will live on without your body and go to hell. cause you killed yourself....|`|6cd34e0e10ad99af4363d4f3f4a2b994aa	Scripturally speaking the taking of ones own life would be murder in Jehovah’s eye’s.  2Petter 2:12, 13a 12But these [men], like unreasoning animals born naturally to be caught and destroyed, will, in the things of which they are ignorant and speak abusively, even suffer destruction in their own [course of] destruction, 13?wronging themselves as a reward for wrongdoing<br>  <br>  Showing how precious life is to Jehovah God I would like for you to read Exodus 20:13 and 21:22,?23.  All of these scriptures show that life is important in Jehovah’s eyes.  We need to have the same outlook as Jesus did when he was on earth, “My food is for me to do the will of him that sent me” - John 4:34.|`|SLRX7Gphaa	Suicide is one of the most retarded things you can do.

I would say yes, though. Because, why would God put you on this planet if you were just supposed to take yourself out? Do you think you might have a purpose here?<br>  And it does always effect people. More than you would know.|`|7KeGDQyXaa	I would miss you.|`|O4VpG9fqaa	Yeah, it'll affect other people.<br>  ..<br>  But c'mon.  You care about their emotions so much that you're forcing yourself to deal with whatever it is that you're dealing with?  <br>  Be more generous to yourself.|`|oY2bcfrvaa	now this all depends on the religion your part of when u say spiritually speaking take for example the japenese think its an honor to commit suicide americas murder rate is higher but Japans suicide rate is higher so its really all about what u believe|`|m6GSXW40aa	YEAH do not murder|`|oHsxp5weaa	No. I really thought about it and I could not come up with one reason... sooooo....no.|`|lIx6kngbaa	yes in the bible it says wrong|`|PHZUzww2aa	"... as long as you do it quietly and it does not affect anyone else?"<br>  <br>  Obviously not.

They need to learn something profound or find their epiphany about life before they die.<br>  <br>  Personally, I think its selfish even if no one else is involved. Life is too great just to throw away.|`|eO2rnf7yaa	I believe we have a duty to each other to be of service.  If you could just quietly disappear with no one knowing,  that could be only because you have failed to be of service to anyone.  There are hungry people in this world who have no way to feed themselves.  There are lonely people, mentally disturbed people,  sick people, homeless people and countless kinds and numbers of other needy people.  We all have a duty to serve these people.   <br>  <br>  If a person is ready to commit suicide,  then that person is obviously free to act.   That person's free actions should be put to good use - in the service of others who are needy.   In my opinion it is a grave offense against God to kill any innocent human being.   No single person has the right to sentence anyone to death,  so even if you see yourself as guilty of some horrible deed - such as murder,  you still do not have the right to kill yourself.  <br>  <br>  I am Roman Catholic.  I believe it is profoundly wrong to willingly take your own life.  Anyone who has done so should be prayed for sincerely.  We should always Hope for God's Mercy,  and we should pray for the salvation of all persons - living or dead.   Suicide is wrong.|`|ZoPln7vaaa	YES! Its completely wrong! its killing yourself, and killing is a sin according to the BIBLE|`|tmckNa4baa	If one disappeared, everyone would know! Suicide hurts everyone, plz just dont do it. If u suicide, how would u know where u would end up? Heaven or Hell? Are u sure you'll be in a better place? Your hurting urself and others. Think about this more carefully.|`|29X6EEsKaa	It seems that somebody always has relationships with other humans, who will be affected by suicide. So it affects other people.|`|2gx2LgzEaa	Your taking a life, even if its your own. <br>  <br>  Spiritually speaking its one of 2 unforgivable sins.<br>  <br>  Thou shalt not kill. and if you kill youself, how are you supposed to ask forgiveness to get a clean slate? you cant. and it doesnt happen automtically.<br>  <br>  That goes for any denomination or dogma. the rules ar ethe same on that<br>  <br>  and suicide ALWAYS effects someone else. This is from experience in dealing with 3..<br>  <br>  >How is someone not going to know? Im not going to candy coat this at all again from experience. Suicide is a CHICKEN **** way to go. its NEVER THAT bad. COWARDS are the only ones who take that road, and this goes for the demented suicide bombers as well.<br>  <br>  It takes a STRONGER person to face something and learn from it, and that in turn makes them THAT much stronger.<br>  <br>  NOTHING is worth calling it quits to put yourself out. because again, your not just effecting yourself, your not teaching anyone any lesson. your effecting everyone around you. and again, spirtually speaking as you ask, you will burn for it.<br>  <br>  Dont get mad, get even.|`|5nfqY9T7aa	It ALWAYS affects somebody else.|`|SWS8QWvhaa	if u commit suicide ur basically wasisting the life tht jesus gave and foght 4 us to live for...plus its a sin and it hurts more ppl then u think|`|AA12034666	Yes. Spiritually speaking, God takes us when He is ready to take us, when we have completed the mission He has set forth for us in this life. If we check out early, it kinda screws with His plans. All suicides affect someone else. Either someone they know and love, or someone they have yet to meet.|`|64d4893f2b5ad37e1908f80ec7b0c4c2aa	Ah, but you may not know for sure who would be affected.  Besides, you only get one chance at life, so why hurry death?|`|AA11440601	Yes.<br>  <br>  And suicide always affects others.<br>  <br>  Catholics believe suicide when committed in full knowledge and deliberate consent is a complete turning away from God (a mortal sin) and will send a person to hell.<br>  <br>  There are 3 conditions of a mortal sin: grave matter, full knowledge, and deliberate consent. <br>  <br>  While suicide (or any kind of murder) is always a grave matter, people who commit suicide may not always have full knowledge of what they're doing. Drugs can definitely impair one's thinking, as can other things, such as diseases, intense pain, or anguish. <br>  <br>  Therefore, suicide is not automatically treated as a mortal sin. <br>  <br>  We are commanded by Christ not to judge others so we leave final judgment to God who alone knows each person's heart.<br>  <br>  The Code of Canon Law does not list suicide as a reason to deny a person a Catholic funeral or burial in a Catholic cemetery. <a href="http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P4C.HTM" rel="nofollow">http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.holycrosscemeteries.com/faq/#Section_17" rel="nofollow">http://www.holycrosscemeteries.com/faq/#...</a><br>  <a href="http://home.att.net/~faithleap/suicide.htm" rel="nofollow">http://home.att.net/~faithleap/suicide.h...</a><br>  <br>  For more information, see the Catechism of the Catholic Church:<br>  On mortal sin, paragraphs 1857-1859: <a href="http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt3sect1chpt1art8.shtml#1857" rel="nofollow">http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt3s...</a><br>  On suicide, paragraphs 2282-2283: <a href="http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt3sect2chpt2art5.shtml#2282" rel="nofollow">http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt3s...</a><br>  <br>  With love and prayers in Christ.|`|67EaIAvbaa	thou shall not murder....GOD would know.|`|CdCpNtFOaa	yes
OQ84rqQ0aa	If he is trully ur friend, u should be able to talk to him about anything.. I know from experience( i just found out an old friend of mine is bi) that its just better to confront him. Be understanding though and still treat him like a friend though even though u may feel uncomfortable. if at all possible it may be easier to write it to him, it is less confrentational and it gives him time to think it over..  Before u get in his face and call him GAY! make sure u start with something like this," hey dude...umm youve been actin kinda odd lately and i just thot id let u know bc i know if i was actin this way, id want u to tell me.."    and if he doesnt admit it and u still have ur doubts, just make sure u dont start those sweet little pushing matches.. that way u dont feel awkward.. On the other hand if he does admit it, u need to tell him how u feel about it, so he doesnt think wrong of u either way.. and if things get too intense for u, unfortunately u may need to find a new main buddy,<br>  <br>                                      IUnderstandUrIssue!<br>                                                      HDR:)|`|xC0XMb62aa	if he is your friend, you shouldnt be posting about him on yahoo answers.

It's enough to open the door to a more open conversation and also enough for you to back off without too much risk.

5db661aa7c4e9f42fa8139651a98c24caa	I'm sorry you feel that way TruthSpeaker.  I believe this community is like any other - composed of all sorts of people.  Many sincere, and yes - many who are not.  <br>  <br>  I'm sure alot of questions are asked based on one's own beliefs or "agenda", after all it's what we know.  But that doesn't mean the one asking isn't open to receive new insight and perspective.<br>  <br>  I often feel as you describe where churches are concerned.  We live in the Bible Belt where there is a "feast" in that there is a church on every corner, but there is so much dead religion that there is an actual famine where the Word of God is concerned.  Sometimes I wonder where all the sincere preachers of the gospel have gone.<br>  <br>  But they're out there whether I see them or not, otherwise people wouldn't continue to be born again, and people like yourself who are hungry for the truth would cease to exist at all.  The sincere ones are still here - I'm writing to one now.<br>  <br>  If you have enjoyed R&S in the past, keep searching TruthSpeaker.  Those who want the truth and are willing to learn are here -  and like a best friend in a city full of strangers, it's worth finding them when you do.|`|oVHFz52Laa	I do not know how you view my questions, but I can tell you that they are sincere.

Give me the details--this would be with contacts online so therefore this would be like a chat room or something similar where God fearing believers can contribute--feedback and questions right? and I am sure it is not to ostracize the unbeliever but to strength our own belief to better ourselves to serve others.

8l5wC4Zeaa	This name is of English topographic origin for someone who lived by a marsh or fen. <br>  <br>  The name derives from the Old English pre 7th Century 'fenn', translating as 'a low-lying marshy area', and is first recorded at the end of the 12th Century, (see below). <br>  <br>  In 1292 one, Richard atte Vanne appears in 'The King's Rolls at Wiltshire'. <br>  <br>  In medieval English dialects of the south west 'V' was regarded as the normal pronunciation of 'F'. The forms with an initial 'Fa' represents the East Saxon form of 'Fenn'. <br>  <br>  In the 'modern' idiom the name has seven spelling variations: Fann, Van(n), Vanne, Vanns, Vance and Venn. <br>  <br>  On April 23rd 1571 Magdalyn Venn married Andrewe Jeffery in North Petherton, Somerset and on February 9th 1590 Ursulay Vann and Charles Savadg were married in St. Margaret's, Westminster. <br>  <br>  The first recorded spelling of the family name is shown to be that of John del Fan, which was dated 1199 - The Pipe Rolls of Essex, during the reign of King Richard 1, 'Richard The Lionheart', 1189 - 1199. Surnames became necessary when governments introduced personal taxation. <br>  <br>  In England this was known as Poll Tax. Throughout the centuries, surnames in every country have continued to "develop" often leading to astonishing variants of the original spelling.|`|njrKjJVwaa	www.houseofnames.com/xq/asp.fc/qx/venn-f...|`|SiPGcBnYaa	Venn Diagram! that's exactly what i thought haha|`|OC13yekvaa	idk about that, but i do know that Venn is the world's most boring child! he is like," Look father. I am outside of my bed room. Look father. I am inside my bed room." that is how the Venn Diagram started. :)|`|wDigwK2maa	I looked it up on a few name meaning websites, but it doesn't exist.  So it's probably just a name the parents made up.  The only thing I can think about is the Venn Diagram (whose creator was John Venn).
avfdeyxNaa	People never really asked me until I came out at fourteen, and then started going out with the same gender and got the usual "OMG UR GAY/BI?!?!?!" from other people at school who didn't know, etc..I just pretty much ignored them, I'm happy with who I am and who I'm with, even if they're not.<br>  <br>  ANYWAYS....I am proudly bi, and out (:|`|duNWQeLaaa	Has anyone ever asked were you gay/lesbian, etc.?   Yes.<br>  How did you react?   I replied "No."<br>  Were they freaked out or shocked by your answer?   Not in the slightest.<br>  What's you orientation now?  I'm gay.<br>  Are you out of the closet? Sort of.<br>  <br>  I replied "no" because I didn't want them to know that I was gay.  The question really didn't surprise me since I am a 'little' bit flamboyant.  <br>  <br>  Similarly, they weren't surprised by the answer because they were just asking out of curiosity. <br>  <br>  xx|`|s2wcWcu1aa	1) yup<br>  2) i just said yeh :)<br>  3) lol yeh he freaked out, he was brought up on the other side of the world and i presume homosexuality was less common. but it wasnt bad, he just kept reffering to me as his bisexual friend, and assumed everyone else i hung around with was bi too :p<br>  4) bisexual<br>  5) sure am :) its much nicer than being in it.|`|IiscnSGGaa	1.yes a bunch of times <br>  2.i just told them the truth <br>  3.they just looked at me with a WOW look <br>  4.i am still a lesbian<br>  5.i am out the closet|`|fea8b41fbdf34f932cc83f9f0cb629c4aa	i never had that problem|`|9RYHLTPoaa	No.. i wish someone would, so i could say "YES!

lDEGaK7Laa	What pro-lifers don't understand is that it isn't their choice. They don't get to dictate what people do with their bodies. Whether the fetus is really a baby or not doesn't even matter; abortion is a right that every woman should have in a free society. If women don't have that right, if they are required to give birth to a baby, it's nothing more than reproductive fascism.<br>  <br>  Pro-lifers assume that the women who have abortions are monsters, but in reality, they're probably the most humane. Most of the mothers who have abortions have them because they are too young to take care of a child, too poor, or just in the wrong circumstances. Getting pregnant is an accident; it wasn't meant to happen and not everybody has access to good information about birth control (thanks to the conservative agenda).<br>  <br>  Abortion is never an off-handed decision like so many pro-lifers assume. Abortion is always a hard, gut-wrenching decision, not some new form of birth control.|`|8pQrIL90aa	You know I encouraged women to have abortions, and one told me that she would hear the sound of a child crying when she tried to fall asleep at night.<br>  <br>  You do have the option to kill the child. But its killing a child. Point blank.|`|aWcD7Ou5aa	I just want chicks and guys  to start using birth control so there are not so many abortions and unwanted, mistreated kids.|`|f7fcb6877caa0ad4f41dd9af2258ee0aaa	It doesn't mean that at all.  It just means that fewer children would be brutally murdered.|`|HIskrREJaa	no, but they might think twice about it when their 13 year old daughter goes and shoves a coat hanger up into her uterus because she's desperate enough to get one and then dies from infection.|`|56dfvnwmaa	yes they do. same goes with politically correct people<br>  <br>  I wonder who I offended more. the PL people or the PC people...|`|FyLfEPv0aa	You mean a fantasy world where we don't kill infants?<br>  <br>  Ya, we're so out of touch, huh.|`|mSFjbetxaa	Anti-choice people are totally unconcerned with the woman involved.  That is a good indication that they have lost touch with reality.<br>  <br>  Let's not forget that it took President Obama to finally make sure that our children all have healthcare.  The fundie republicans fought that for well over 20 years.<br>  <br>  It seems that fundies lose interest in children after they are out of the womb.|`|eO2rnf7yaa	We just don't think the killing of innocent human beings should be condoned.  That people will continue to behave immorally no matter what is not a justification for allowing abortion to remain legal.<br>  <br>  At the point of conception the thing that exists is genetically human, genetically unique, and is alive.   We must as a society protect such beings unless we can prove the "thing" is not a living human.   Theoretically, that could be done - just prove it is something else.<br>  <br>  I think the only fantasy surrounding abortion is the expectation that we can survive as a human civilization while we willingly destroy millions of humans before they even draw their first breaths.|`|bOaqWNxRaa	I'm pro-life- perhaps I live in a fantasy world. I don't know. Maybe there are no answers.<br>  <br>  But isn't it weird that aborted babies now have a monetary value? Did you know that people can sell the body parts from aborted babies: the heart, the kidneys, etc. The value of human life now has a quantifiable price. <br>  <br>  I have no illusions about making abortion completely illicit. I personally do not think that people will stop having intercourse, nor do I think that parents will suddenly love unwanted children. <br>  <br>  Children are the last sacred thing in this world, besides God's word. <br>  <br>  The ancient Mayans sacrificed their children and their people. Are we still so savage in our modern world that we would commit the same crimes?|`|cIvFOzoiaa	They are entitled to their opinion and probably think that us pro choice people live in our own fantasy world.<br>  However, a part of democracy is freedom and choice, as in pro choice.<br>  Pro life, while having some good intentions, may just ruin lives of unwanted children who were born under bad conditions, like crack addict babies.  Also, the Earth is overpopulated, so what's a few unborn babies in a country of over 300,000,000?  Also, it isn't murder because life begins at birth, which is why we count our years from birth, not conception.<br>  These are some of my reasons for being pro choice.|`|AA11620976	I've always felt there is a certain childish ,idealistic naive quality to their position on children and life in general<br>  Maybe it's because they're the lucky ones who had great childhoods and they never went to bed hungry , or got beat up , or sexually abused or abandoned , or shuttled from foster home to foster home  .......and  they honestly believe that if they can stop abortions then all of the children that they  save will indeed have the same awesome childhoods that they did.<br>  I personally think that they need to get out more , take off the rose colored glasses and get a clue as to exactly WTF is going on in the lives of some of these kids that their efforts caused to come into this world.|`|hZ9omSataa	they believe in the impossible, yet tell us that most scientific theory is impossible, they laugh @ evolution like it is some joke, but they come up with insane *** stories about water and wine and Resurrections..everything about their life is based on fantasy, so, yeah, they are going to believe that if some stupid law is passed that the world will be all Norman Rockwell....|`|wIOf22wRaa	No it isn't a fantasy world, it's reality and we try to do what's right. In my opinion, if it is rape it's a different situation. But, if someone has sex on purpose and then wants to get an abortion, they shouldn't get one because they need to take responsibility for their actions. After all, abortion doesn't make you unpregnant, it makes you the mother of a dead baby. Abortion is just an excuse for whores to get away with sleeping around and i don't care who says otherwise. Oh and just for the record, not only do i stand up for helpless people, but for animal rights as well.|`|2LcyVsrlaa	I think that pro-deathers (because I refuse to allow abortion supporters the term "pro-choice") live in a little fantasy world.  <br>  <br>  The fantasy that the baby is not really a person, with a heartbeat, an identity, a fingerprint.  <br>  <br>  The fantasy that the only person who is affected by abortion is the mother (well, for lack of a better term...) <br>  <br>  The fantasy that "pro-choice" only applies to abortionists.  <br>  <br>  The fantasy that abortion is safe for the mother (for lack of a better term...)<br>  <br>  The fantasy that human life is cheap and expendable...<br>  <br>  .....need I continue?|`|J4lfOSPiaa	Sad to say but I think that most of society is running around with blinders on whether pro life or pro choice.  A fantasy world?  Maybe!  Would making it illegal change the statistics on women seeking an abortion with that alleged wire coat hanger and some moron stuffing it up your uterus?  The other day I was at a flea market and found a complete OB-GYN set of D&C surgical instruments for sale.  A smart nurse could make a lucrative business of illegal abortions with sterilized equipment purchased at a flea market.  How is that for the land of opportunity?  No fantasy there only some good old fashioned greed would work!|`|PAUB1Sm3aa	I wouldn't go that far. They don't usually focus on that part of the argument; most of them are concerned about 'murdering a baby.'<br>  <br>  I disagree with that, as it's illogical to have a baby born into a potentially poverish or abusive household [if every pro-lifer agreed to care for every unwanted child, then I would be fine with it].<br>  <br>  But it is ideal to most of them that every child born is adored [though, psh, not likely] and that people who are not trying for children should either not have sex or use protection.<br>  <br>  Not like that's ever going to happen; no matter how much stance taken against abortion there is, I highly doubt it will ever be outlawed. There are too many orphaned children and now that the economy is down, people who can't afford children [I know that sounds bad, but it's true.].<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  If you outlaw abortion, you are taking the choice away from the person who is, right here and now, ALIVE and breathing on the earth. Who matter more; the unborn baby or the live mother? <br>  <br>  The definition of life is uncertain. However, babies in the womb do not yet have conscience or memory; do you remember what you did in your mother's uterus? <br>  <br>  I support abortion because I support the here and now. I understand how it's guilt-wracking for some people, but you can't take away that choice from others. You can't restrict abortion for everyone just because YOU think it's wrong. You need to allow others to have a choice to do what they think is right.|`|AA10975334	If they don't want kids why don't they either have the surgery which will greatly decrease the odds, it is still possible to conceive but it's rare,they can use birth control, same case, OR if they don't want children they should use this great thing they call a calendar and keep an eye on when the woman is fertile or not fertile OR they can sleep in separate bedrooms, which chances of that are very unlikely<br>  There are many options to take other than just having an abortion|`|nGyOmjPsaa	It's more like; they want abortion illegal because abortion is like handing a kid a gun and letting him run wild with it.<br>  Abortion is wrong and it should be stopped.  I'm sorry, but if your life was on the line I would do everything I could to stop the blood shed.  Life should be let alone to live as it isn't our say in who can live or die.<br>  Abortion is inhumane.<br>  God bless+|`|48ce97659b087798ebee5f52cd249e3aaa	While they may be out of touch with reality, it doesn't mean that they can't hope for a day when all children who are conceived are wanted children.<br>  <br>  "most still think abortion is killing the actual baby"  What does that mean?

30b80549ef581ba10302258d8ca2bfbaaa	Hmmm…Well I definitely wouldn’t say that race is “irrelevant” to me. I think about it constantly, talk about it all the time to my friends and family, and I feel like race has such a heavy influence on society that it would be kind of blind not to acknowledge its importance. But other than that I guess it doesn’t matter that much. I definitely don’t hate anyone because of their race, and although I do kind of believe in preservation of different races, I feel like such an idea is treading on thin ice. I hear myself saying things that I never thought I would say. Like the most controversial thing that my friends were just shocked by was my new thing about  me not wanting to have mixed kids. That’s just a personal thing not a rule that everyone should live by. Its  so confusing to be stuck in my head honestly because I genuinely want to raise a black child like its just something I have to do. The problem with that is in my everyday life I have a tendency to be drawn to people with interesting personalities, not their race. Thats kind of why I have a bf of a different race. I try not to think about it on a daily basis because if I limit myself based on minor frustrations that I have about race or what kind of children I want then I could miss out on meeting some awesome people. <br>   <br>  I have been called a sell out before so I would never judge someone for who they are. I think its ridiculous to think that an image portrayed of black women is who I’m supposed to be. **** you. I’ve had to defend myself over and over for speaking differently, my religious beliefs, listening to “white music” (what the **** is white music?), etc. Seriously if I try to educate myself about my history and I’m  proud of being black then that’s all you need to know. Its upsetting to me because I was one of those self hating, token black, ignorant assholes walking around putting down people of my own race. I’ve had to change completely as far as my views on race go. I know what a sell out looks like so don’t even tell me that my interests, the way I speak, or WHO I ******* DATE define who I am as a person. I think people should be free to be who they want to be as long as they aren’t hurting anyone. I also think that it says something when you give one group of people so much credit that anything outside of the small box of stereotypical behaviors and personalities you’re given from day one is reserved for them. For the billionth time people you cant act like a race of people. We aren't genetically programmed to be different - society dictates how we're supposed to act. <br>  <br>  What’s up with people looking down on other cultures though seriously? You’re no different from someone from “the ghetto”. You’re no better so stop acting like they’re the scum of the earth. I know most people will disagree with me and that’s fine but I just don’t think its right to judge people on where they come from. I hate the way some people think that black people are okay as long as we aren’t “too black” or ghetto. So because someone else hasn’t been as  fortunate enough to have an easier life or a bit more pocket change they’re “trash”? I cant stand people who think like that. I have family living in the projects and they are some of the best people I know.  I kind of feel like people who actually express strong dislike or hatred toward “ghetto people” are kind of talking about me...I’m not stereotypical at all but what happens when you hate a certain group of people? You look for common things to group “those people” together. Most black people aren’t living in the ghetto but most people living in the ghetto are black. So if that’s the face that you associate with “ghetto” (and im assuming it is otherwise half these people wouldn’t feel the need to say “oh if they were white id feel the same”) and I’m black…you’ll probably be thinking something derogatory about me at some point. <br>  <br>  I’m ranting again aren’t I ? <br>  Basically no i don't have expectations or standards for black people. i think they should act and dress the way they choose to without being crucified for it. I just think everyone should be proud of who they are as long as they aren't trying to be something they're not for the sake of pleasing other people. <br>  <br>  rant over : ]|`|DQZK3eKfaa	I totally agree with you. I hate how you get accused of trying to be a certain race because of how you dress. <br>  People in the "city" still ask me why I talk so white, but I just talk normal, I don't talk like like ehmahgawd (I'm saying this b/c its the stereotype),|`|c614aa36f47781f6160bcceaebb97251aa	Race doesn't matter to me. But unfortunately, people like to make a big deal out of one's ethnicity, rather than their abilities. Regardless of our race, we are still human beings.|`|GcOWoAmSaa	Race is very important to me. NASCAR is why I got satellite TV.|`|dyFRchmtaa	some people prefer mainstream culture, they may shun their own culture, which could mean they are racially self-hatred of their culture, and do not want to be remined of their races culture, because they are not happy with it, they want to fit in with mainstream society. Some people don't like being different, living a different life, maybe different language. I think its more likely that you get ethnic minorities experiencing these feelings as mainstream culture is 'white' culture. People may be brain-washed with what they see on TV, they start to desire it and shun their own people and race.|`|f3jZAL1naa	Personally I don't care but I know that society is different. I get along with people based on personality, common beliefs and values etc... I have friends of many different cultures but I guess that's because I come from Canada and multiculturalism is very common here. But I do know what it's like to be apart of an ethnic minority even though I'm white. So I understand what it feels like to be oppressed and it sucks. So I don't believe that race should be an issue at all. We should even go so far as to celebrate other cultures.|`|zTuc5eDIaa	Haha that is so true most people who denounce racism are guilty of exactly what you described.<br>  <br>  Me? I tend to look down on anyone who acts like a ghetto trashy gangster, whether they are white black or Asian. I've seen plenty of "wiggers" and they piss me off just as much as the black people who try to act ghetto.|`|5tVSnJKEaa	Race plays no factor in my life and I honestly don't care for race. The way I see it is we are all humans; I believe this and would never dislike someone for their race, because I know I don't want someone hating me for being  Mexican American. Which as of now it's pretty common with all these immigrants coming here illegally.<br>  But people have no way of picking their race it's what their born into, is it their fault their Mexican? No, so why dislike them for it? People who judge based on ones skin color are ignorant. Like Dr.Martin Luther King said " People should be based on the content of their character not the color of their skin.|`|uDYshODsaa	with me race doesn't count for anything.<br>  why is it that people are proud of something they gain by accident of birth? and why should someone look down on someone for that same reason? i'm not proud of my race or proud of being an american or any of that really. <br>  <br>  huh, i really don't have much to be proud of at all. i'm not athletic, my grades are mediocre and i'm not very good at anything. <br>  <br>  i just realized how pathetic my life is|`|pfke6Jieaa	very little. i think in my country we have a strong belief in staying in our country blood lines but thats all bogus. just marry anyone u want to it doesnt matter as long as u dont forget ur heritage. its good that most ppl still stick to their race there is nothing really wrong with that at all, not everyone has to mix. i know what u mean but this section is full of crappy ppl with crappy lives so they make dumb statements. i also dont believe in acting a certain race thats stupid.|`|BmOs3tOsaa	Racism is an imaginary word invented by the liberal media|`|PM808Qjkaa	I think it's irrelevent.

I have Spanish, Native American, Italian, French, Irish, English, and Indian ancestry, so I'm not even quite sure which racial/ethnic group I would adhere to anyway.<br>  <br>  I grew up American, and only followed American culture. When I was younger, I was militant about things becoming too "un-American", but my militant attitude led me to become arrogant, self-centered, and hateful. I didn't like my attitudes, so I changed myself a bit. Not that I don't care about my country (because I do), but I've stepped back from the mindset that we are "Gods gift to the Earth". Unfortunately, sometimes I still let that old arrogant attitude get the better of me. Nobody's perfect, I guess.|`|A9EydXySaa	to me its not important.<br>  im white-techniqually german and irish.<br>  but i always feel like if i say something like bad about someone who has different color of skin its like are you rascist?<br>  noo...i just dont like how they act and stuff.<br>  i hate how thats how things are everything bad said about someone of color its like oh are you rascist?<br>  most likely the person who said something isnt.<br>  i feel like when people say that, its covering up cause they know they shouldnt have said or done something.<br>  wehn in reality you say something to a white person, and its not are you rascist.<br>  idk if that makes sense.<br>  <br>  but idc about race. i care how people act.<br>  <br>  my boyfriend is guatemalan and el slavadorian.<br>  i have muslim friends<br>  black friends<br>  hispanic friends (of all the different kinds)<br>  asian (all kinds koreon, chinese japanese)<br>  pretty much everything<br>  <br>  i have phillipeno family.<br>  ive always had different best friends of all races.<br>  <br>  i hate how everything is race though.<br>  like obama, i mean most voted for him because he is half black. to be real.<br>  and then everyone claims oh race doesent matter then they are like YEAH WE HAVE A BLACK PRESIDENT.<br>  <br>  wich is great but really?<br>  why does it matter were all human.<br>  idc what race anyone is.<br>  <br>  just how they act.<br>  it will always be here though. there will be stupid ignorant people who care about race.<br>  <br>  there is only one race- human.<br>  <br>  <br>  like craftkevin says! were all the same we just have different credit scores.<br>  lol watch his videos and youll see when he says it :]<br>  i agree with you though 100% !

When two people are married, they are to be so close that they become one. I believe that it is difficult or impossible to ever be really, truly close to someone who does not share your faith. This difference will always be a wedge between you. It will become more pronounced when children enter the picture. You and he will have a power struggle over how the kids are raised. The kids will be the big losers as the two of you fight.<br>  <br>  If this issue is a surprise to you then you don't know your boyfriend very well.

They're barely out of the Stone Age!<br>  <br>  At any rate, yes, a third-world country could do us significant damage by planting nuclear bombs in one or more of our cities.  They could not destroy us, bu they could damage us badly.  So then what would happen?  Remember our national anger after 9/11?  Imagine how much worse it would be if we got nuked.  The offending nation would become a large glass ashtray - and it would be just too bad for anyone downwind.  We might regret it later...but that wouldn't keep us from doing it.<br>  <br>  And even the leaders of North Korea know that.|`|FkdEyXudaa	Whoaaaa!!!

3RQkgTSOaa	Furtive eye contact, talkative, makes idle chitchat about nothing in particular, nudges you lightly with a shoulder or elbow, makes casual physical contact (hands on shoulder, leans against you), seems uncharacteristically flustered around you when normally they are calm and collected, calls you by a pet nickname.|`|nQpGcBGdaa	For me, its when I give a chick eye contact, and she does the same.

EVby6dGCaa	It seems you need to do a bit of work to demonstrate that there actually is a hell in the first place -- by which i mean a repository of some kind for souls who are to be tormented for eternity (or even for a set time frame, let's be lax about it).<br>  <br>  Then, let's examine belief: A person generally believes what? Could it be that they believe what they perceive to be true?<br>  <br>  Now I think we all will admit that we don't know everything. We therefore have incomplete knowledge, which means we are going to have incorrect beliefs. <br>  <br>  Your assumption seems to be that a person who errs in his judgment about certain things must be punished; I'm unable to see why that would be so.<br>  <br>  A person believes that the Bible has nothing of value in it. Does that make that person a terrible person? Stupid? That's a different story. But evil? I think not. The person is just believing what, so far as they can discern, the facts of which they are aware point to. Stupidity, in my opinion, is not  evil; it is lack of information. <br>  <br>  I can't see why a person who believes something is condemning himself to dannnation. However, if a person honestly believed that there is no God, and they pretended to believe, then that would be reprehensible.|`|xBd96wvRaa	Eternity and how you experience it is solely based on the level of inner peace you have when you die.|`|KfeeV5nraa	what are theists?<br>  answer mine<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AsL0imTWDmkBp55J6h4n9fvsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090220193111AAIEh9q">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AsL0imTWDmkBp55J6h4n9fvsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090220193111AAIEh9q">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|c1Dpi0eyaa	It might be more appropriate if they were made to watch heaven with no chance of getting there for a couple thousand years for their lack of belief in anything but their own thinking.|`|9g2X9smKaa	YES .|`|AA11124121	we are apostates...and considered worse than sinners..|`|8rvPgdSIaa	Well are God is a forgiving God, so therefore the final judgment is up to him, not what any of us say. The thing people mix up is that we evolved from monkeys.  Let me say this, if that was the case, why can we talk, think outside of the box, and create new technology. We are not animals and were made by a Creator's hand, its like everything was meant to happen this way.  He made nature to serve for are clothing,homes,food and so on.  God works in mysterious ways so asking me stuff isn't going to help.|`|Ddd8LDPGaa	really dude, i don't know if I'M going to hell because i don;t believe in the bible and jesus, but i believe there is a god somewhere , but i think after death there is nothing, it's like sleeping but not having a dream, nothing happens to you, i don't think there is a hell or a heaven|`|QtCQtXDVaa	You are not going anywhere.

Based on personal experience, the more I know and understand Him, the more I love Him.  It's similar to our relationships with people.|`|nzdDdKtyaa	Even demons acknowledge the existence of God.|`|IzRdQx95aa	"All theists" would mean any believe in any God, from any religion. And a lot of religions don't believe in hell, i.e. Buddhism, Judaism...If you're referring to the Christian religion, then possibly. But what God is a loving God that would send a person to hell for actually contemplating religion. God, in theory, gave you the ability to think. Anyway, religion shouldn't be based on quilt. A "creator" as you said could be carbon atoms, which, scientifically speaking, life on Earth owes its existence to. I don't think carbon is going to damn anyone to hell for not loving it.|`|592720da4c62512d890fcde1e6f75314aa	Theist would then also have to believe in heaven and hell.... <br>  Being atheist myself means for me that I can say that there may be one god or a hundred gods but that doesn't mean that I have to believe in all that they stand for.|`|OQ84rqQ0aa	In order to get to heaven, u only have one way..

F0UF9DDeaa	Firstly... If a person kills a roach because it is spreading over 5000 diseases around their home, that is not what GOD meant in the 10 commandments by thou shalt not kill... that is meant as Thou shalt not kill another human being, just because you want to. GOD gave us power over animals or insects.. read your bible hun. Secondly.. Do not take things so literary... It is called a figure of speech. She means she thinks she's hot. Hell -fire-hot.

Note that these Gospels did not come into the Bible as original and authoritative from the authors (Gospal charecters) themselves, but rather from the influence of early church fathers, who were redactors of the bible.<br>  <br>  Simply because someone makes a claim, does not mean it represents reality.<br>  <br>  Josephus Flavius, the Jewish historian, lived as the earliest non-Christian who mentions a Jesus. Although many scholars think that Josephus' short accounts of Jesus (in Antiquities) came from interpolations perpetrated by a later Church father (most likely, Eusebius), Josephus' birth in 37 C.E., well after the alleged crucifixion of Jesus, puts him out of range of an eyewitness account. Moreover, he wrote Antiquities in 93 C.E., after the first gospels got written! Therefore, even if his accounts about Jesus came from his hand, his information could only serve as "Hearsay".<br>  <br>  What about other Josephus's writings... specifically the one called 'Discourse to the Greeks concerning Hades' in part 7  ???<br>  <br>  There is NO metion of Jesus in these writings....YET Josephus says, Quote: "and if you will apply your ears to the hearing of the inspired prophets, the interpreters both of God and of his word, and will believe in God, you shall both be partakers of these things, and obtain the good things that are to come"<br>   ....If there is one such place that Josephus could or would mention Jesus it would be to include Jesus along in these writings as well !  ...since Josephus mentions G-d and the Prophets ! .... instead the emphesises is only on the Prophets, and G-d, and interpreters of his word, which could mean the Rabbis, and Priests of Judaism!<br>  <br>  The writings  'Discourse to the Greeks concerning Hades' show that there is another reason of suspicion ,that the mentioning of Jesus in  'Testimonium Flavianum ' was not coherant, with what was written in "Discourse to the Greeks concerning Hades" which points to another clue to the possibility of insertions or interpolations by early church redactors , in 'Testimonium Flavianum '.<br>  <br>  After Josephus died, his writings were gone over by the early church with a fine tooth and comb.( Even Josephus couldn’t defend his own writings).<br>  So using Josephus, to say anything about Jesus is scholarly absolutely not valid.<br>  <br>  We presuppose the existence of such diverse historical figures as Aristotle, Copernicus, Mohammed, George Washington, and John F. Kennedy because we are in possession of consistent testimony from a variety of contemporary sources.<br>   The existence of the historical figure is the only reasonable hypothesis that will account for such consistency. <br>  With Jesus this is not the case as many New Testament researchers have so convincingly demonstrated.<br>  <br>  I can not tell you exactly what the early church fathers did...I can only say SINCE THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF THE AUTOGRAPHS, the Christian claims are mere "SUPPOSITIONS"  starting in the second century after Jesus. <br>  The Church fathers had to invent (fabrications) of word-for-word Dialogues of the Gospal Charecters without the original autographs.<br>  <br>  However we do have an abundance of evidence supporting the "mythical" evolution of Jesus. So if you hear anyone who claims to have evidence for a witness of a historical Jesus, simply ask for the author's birth date. Anyone who's birth occurred after an event cannot serve as an eyewitness, nor can their words alone serve as evidence for that event..... after all most of us are in the search of Proof -for-Truth, which is what God or Atheists want to begin with.|`|ad08fe27604f983a2b098f5c3a9bdfa5aa	Have you ever read Herodotus?  He was possibly the first historian and was born about 2500 years ago.  Many of the things in his books have turned out to be true, and he certainly mentions many places that existed and still exist.  He even mentions the island that is now called Britain as a source of tin, which it was.  <br>  <br>  He tells a little yarn about how at one place far to the east of Greece, gold  is found in sands, and is guarded by huge furry ants, bigger than a fox but smaller than a dog. According to the story, the ants bring the gold to the surface but stay underground during the heat of the day.  So for a short period, the local people could gather the gold but had to run away before the ants became active in the later afternoon and attacked them.  <br>  <br>  Until recently, this story was regarded as a silly tale that someone had told him and he repeated in his book.  But a dozen years ago, it was found to be partially true.  Animals, but not ants do bring gold to the surface in one place, far to the east of Greece, in modern Pakistan.  But the animals are marmots, not ants.  Marmots are burrowing squirrels.  It seems that the old Persian word for marmot could also be translated as "mountain ant".<br>  <br>  It is my suspicion that much of what is in the Bible is similar.  Yes, the people in it did exist, by and large.  Jesus, Peter, Pilate and many others are real figures of history.  But the stories about them may not be quite accurate, particularly as the surviving stories were written by those who believed that Jesus was divine and wished to propagate the idea. Biased witnesses.  <br>  <br>  We have basically one source for these people and stories, and that is the Bible itself.  To go back further in time to ancient Egypt, we have evidence that people like many of the pharaohs existed.  Not only do they appear in the lists of kings, their inscriptions can be found here and there and the remains of buildings they had built still exist.  In dozens of cases their preserved bodies remain.  There are multiple, more or less independent sources to support the proposition that they existed. <br>  <br>  The same goes for many other prominent historical figures.  There are multiple sources to say that someone in history existed. With the Bible there is in effect, one source.|`|YZv8Ub3Haa	>The cities/empires and regions mentioned all existed.<br>  The places in New York mentioned in Spider-Man all existed.<br>  <br>  >Jesus is in Roman/Jewish records.

The god of the Old Testament was such a maniacal tyrant, that he in no way can be related to the god of the New Testament.  The only reason the Old Testament is even considered valid is because of the ancient prophecies contributed to Jesus, and the Ten Commandments.

Sins can only be forgiven if you confess them directly to the Lord (sacrament of confession).

After all, God will not MAKE a person walk to Him if he or she does not want to. If one wants eternal separation from the Lord, he or she will SHOW it in their actions. <br>  <br>  That being said, we Catholics believe that confessing your sins to the Lord Himself is the only way to redeem yourself of your wrongful actions. As for the actual confession, the priest acts merely as the intercessor to God as His "earthly representative", as you might say, to wash away one's sin.

flKkoiwbaa	No. LOL . . . <br>  <br>  Black cats got their bad reputation way way back in the Middle Ages.  The Catholic Church, trying to gain power, attempted to demonize many of the facets of rural (i.e. pagan) life.  Cats in general where demonized by church authorities, who believed that cats were witch's "familiars" - demon companions who did the witch's bidding.  Black was also considered evil, as was the number 13, yadda yadda yadda.  So the poor black kitties got a bad rap, which they've been trying to shake ever since.<br>  <br>  Don't listen to a bunch of ninnies from the Middle Ages!!!!  I have a black cat, Zelda, who's brought me nothing but good luck (and lots of love, too!)<br>  <br>  Have fun with it . . . buck convention and name one of them Lucky and the other Fortunata, or something.<br>  <br>  Congrats on your new babies . . . .take good care of them :-)|`|nuhi9H6paa	Few animals are the subject of as many myths, both good and evil, as the black cat. It seems that this mysterious, graceful animal engenders strong emotions, both historically and in present times. No matter whether the associations are positive or negative, the black cat continues to remain a powerful mystique in society.<br>  <br>  In Western Society, black cat myths are often associated with bad luck. One of the more popular myths is the one in which the black cat crosses one's path. This portends very bad luck for that person who encountered the feline. +<br>  <br>  On the other hand, good luck omens are also associated with black cats. Fortunately, many more stories point to the connection between good fortune and black cats. The ancient Egyptians venerated black cats and treated them as royalty. In fact, killing a black cat was a capital offence. Cats were mummified upon their death to preserve them for the afterlife.<br>  <br>  Even though many folks believe that a cat crossing one's path is bad luck, many think that a black cat crossing one's path means that person will have good luck. <br>  <br>  Moreover, if the cat is stoked three times or spoken to, the luck will be even greater.<br>   <br>  One of the French myths is that if one has a black cat with even one white hair, Lady Luck will smile upon the owner. In most other cultures, the black cat is considered to be a symbol of fortune - a prized possession - and the owner considered to very lucky|`|AXwMsPuCaa	No, they are not.  Its all superstition really.  They only think that because of witches.  Its also because of the color black. I mean the Black knight, a dark wizard, black magic.

I remember one time, my friend's mother had said "You're so gay" in front of me, and of course, she doesn't know. He does, though, so he looked at me and mouthed "I'm sorry." Most people don't mean it as an insult to homosexuals, so I guess it's not that big of a deal.|`|4aN1PF2haa	No not at all cos I know that they don't mean it to be insulting specifically to gay people - it's just the way the word has changed over time I guess, it's not like it's a personal attack or anything... even I use it so it would be pretty hypocritical of me to get offended by other people using it.|`|4pgzNYcEaa	I see it as a form of discrimination.

They oust the idea that they do not believe in a God which catapults them to deity status. Everybody has faith in something. I believe it takes more energy to be an atheist because you are trying to swear off something that MUST exist because before you were born FAITH was alive in the hearts of mankind. In this new world you dont suffer a consequence for not believing, but I am willing to bet in books that there was no atheist in past times when the whole village or town depended on various Gods to produce rain, babies and food and they prayed. <br>  <br>   Atheism is really a childish look at life,  a hard attempt at trying to "BE" but without any proof that a God does not exist.|`|fbrdhY1aaa	I don't like to "view" them as a group because they're individuals and should not be lumped together.  I have met a few atheists, and out of those people, I had one who was really arrogant and rude, one who was really nice and intelligent and didn't flaunt his lack of belief in my face, one who was so closed-minded that he couldn't even discuss the definition of faith without calling me filthy names, and one who clung to The God Delusion as a means of explaining away my belief in God...<br>  <br>  As you can see, if i were to lump them together and describe my experience, it would more than likely be negative.  However, I like to give every person the benefit of the doubt and try not to generalize.  Based on that, I can safely say that I have many atheist acquaintances, and one that I'm really fond of and respect.
mFy3M8mVaa	This has been a hot topic in the zoology section over the past couple of days. <br>  *Sigh* I would be a hypocrite if I said that no one should have a wild and potentially dangerous as a pet, as I have a number of potentially dangerous (and a few downright lethal) animals as pets. The difference is that my pets have been rescued from idiots who only wanted a status symbol and weren't capable of handling or providing proper care for these animals. I didn't go out looking to buy any of them. I just couldn't stand the thought of any of these beautiful creatures being destroyed because of irresponsible people. I took them in because I am able to give them a good life, proper care and ensure their safety and make sure that they don't harm another animal (i.e. a human).<br>  In conclusion, there is a right way to keep wild and/or dangerous animals in captivity and a wrong way.<br>  <br>  I work at an animal sanctuary, as well. I am the big cat keeper. Most of our cats were former 'pets'. One of our lions was purchased by a family in Toronto as an exotic pet for their young children. By the time he weighed 40 pounds they could no longer handle him, he was injuring their children and the parents finally realized that a lion is not a good pet and called me up. Some people are just plain stupid and shouldn't even be trusted to take care of a hamster.<br>  <br>  EDIT: ROFL at Ruth's description...The Incredible Hulk with Alzheimer's! That's hilarious! :D|`|4WFtzJheaa	No..they are not domesticated, and they are not compatible with humans, even though we are related, they are very different and do not understand. when they attack as a pet it is not out of maliciousness, it is because they are in an environment that they cannot comprehend and they see things as threats that we see as commonplace. imo it's selfish to keep a chimp as a pet..|`|AA11666466	I've seen it where people would adopt them and when they are "babies," they are easy to take care of and not much trouble but then when they are teenagers (I guess a few human-years-old), they start reeking havoc on the house and property. In the one show I saw, this teen chimp climbed the curtains, tore up the furniture, tore everything up, bit people... just imagine a really strong wild toddler on PCP. So, it's a great idea up until then.. after that, they must be let go and later be found in someone's drainage system and crawling out of toilets.|`|JseyoIfLaa	There are more tigers and lions in captivity in peoples private homes than chimpanzees. I think it is a very bad idea to have these animals as pets. There only about 5000 tigers left in the wild, but an estimated 10,000 to 15,000 in private facilities in the US.|`|RWgjnwl9aa	No never they're wild  they aren't meant to be pets'  look at what happened in Masschusetts with that chimp these animals aren't meant to be domisticated|`|YieY5Ddpaa	I'm not sure how this is related to religion and spirituality... but, no.

Also, I feel no sympathy for the woman or the friend, but for the chimp.  It's only natural that he would attack because he was protecting his owner from a stranger, and SHE STABBED HIM!

6ELSwKKvaa	Having lived 40 years on this ball of dirt we call earth, I can tell you that as bad as you feel right now.... it will eventually get better. Things suck at the moment but that will eventually change. It can be helpful to write a letter about what you are feeling. You don't need to give it to anyone but it is a way to get out all the negative feelings. Allow yourself to cry when you need to. It is a great release.<br>  <br>    Know that God loves you and that things will get better.

KBxz1Wfyaa	Love being in the woods just watching and listening.  We will hike in the woods to a spot, settle in and just watch, being still and quiet.  Soon the birds, squirrels, rabbits and deer will forget we're there.  Squirrels are hilarious to me.  They can just chatter up a storm and we've seen better fights than HBO has when it comes to them finding nuts to "squirrel" away for the winter. If we are sitting down wind from deer so they don't catch our scent, what a pleasure to watch them especially in the spring after they have given birth.  Sometimes we've been lucky enough to see a doe that's had 2 fawns.  <br>  I digress.  I can rough it but these days not for long due to some physical limitations.  Now days I need an air mattress in that tent or I can't walk the next day. We have old beams and wood stored in our barn salvaged from a barn my husband helped take down a few years ago.  Our plan is to build a very small cabin in our woods.  Now I could live there 24/7 when we finally get it built.  We've got the spot picked out.  I'll have him build a very small porch on it so I can put a couple of rocking chairs for us on it.  We have a very small pot belly stove in our tool shed to put in it.  <br>  I am equally comfortable in a 5 star hotel when I feel the need for some pampering.  Haven't been able to afford that luxury in quite a while though.<br>  By far I enjoy watching nature the best.|`|MGOFjVnVaa	tent, definitely. camped in siberia (lake baikal), in zimbabwe<br>  (kariba damarea),camped in various places in south africa and<br>  all those camping vacations at the age of sixty and above.<br>  <br>  lunches right right out of the boxes an cartoons on the roadside -<br>  i enjoyed that very much.<br>  <br>  a five star restaurant - fine, provided the food is good, which<br>  is not always true. but a couple of times a year is enough,<br>  i do not like all those waiters and waitresses around, i do not<br>  like the menues to be read like romance poems and i do<br>  not support owners of "in"places so they can drive around in<br>  their porsches or hummers at my cost.|`|ZW0JHvdraa	A four- room suite at the Hilton complete with private chef, personal masseuse, and dinner at a 5-star restaurant with George Clooney :)<br>  <br>  I guess I could learn to enjoy the tent deal if George came with it! lol<br>  <br>  I had the rare pleasure of meeting him in person, and he is as nice & down-to-earth as he is good looking!!|`|34090baae43bdcb8c4c4335f475f6aa1aa	It doesn't have to be the Hilton, but I prefer the hotel, only because aches and pains would prevent me from the tent.  I loved camping in my youth, and a camper would certainly work, and be fun.<br>  I like both a picnic in the park, or by a lake or river, and normal restaurants........to me 5 star restaurants are reserved for very special occasions.|`|f6570cfbea3dd78b529876a088bffb0eaa	I used to go camping a lot in bear country.  We'd build a camp fire and cook our food and wash our dishes in the ice cold water of the rushing stream where snakes sunbathed on the rocks.  I liked it but then it got old because while it was intended to be our vacation, my husband would grab a beer and sit around talking with his buddies.  It was me--all by myself who put up a ten by ten canvas tent, cooked the food and washed the dishes.  Days later, when it was time to pack up and leave, oh yeah, guess what?  It was me tearing everything down, packing it into the car and when we got home, it was little ole' me who aired the tent out on the clothes line in the sun and carried everything into the house and put the stuff away.  I put a stop to that.  The next time my husband told me he was thinking of another camping trip, I told him to go and have a good time.  The only time I finally got a vacation was when I was left at home all by myself.  Now that was living.  As for hotel stays--hate 'em.  Who knows how many people soiled the sheets before I was expected to lie on them.  Five star restaurants don't interest me either.  I like to know how my food was prepared and by whom.  I'd rather cook my own food.|`|g0gMQUCVaa	We have a Winnebago Vectra.  That works for me.  When I was young I liked to camp under the stars or in a tent.  Not anymore though.

My husband jokes that my idea of roughing it is a room at the Hilton that faces the parking lot instead of the swimming pool.<br>  <br>  We do a lot of boating and water skiing in the summer, but go home at the end of the day.  A lot of our friends stay at the lake in tents or campers, but I prefer to go home, shower, sleep in my own bed, and return to the lake in the morning.  Plus, we find the campgrounds are always so noisy -- some people are up late at night playing loud music, then there are those who get up at the crack of dawn.  I know, I sound like a grouch, and actually am a grouch when it comes to my sleep!<br>  <br>  That said, I would prefer a picnic in the park rather than a 5-star restaurant.|`|rJJhMQ37aa	I'll do the Hilton, thank you,<br>  and the 5 star restaurant<br>  <br>  But I do remember with pleasure, those times Mom got us out of bed at 4 AM.

I love my luxury!|`|uuQrhnJ4aa	I am a nature lover, but I cannot camp due to physical disabilities. My particulars cause too much pain w/tent, pop-up or full out RV. I'd love to be able to be right there in the middle of the nature, but I've only done it once in each of the modes mentioned & paid for it dearly afterwards (& I was young then-I woudn't even attempt it now due to the pain severity w/just avg activity). <br>  <br>  I like access to the nature & being miles away from civilization in order to commune with the flora & fauna and then returning to my basic hotel room with heat/ac, running water, bathroom & a bed. In those situations, I spend a lot of time on the balcony enjoying the view when I'm not out there in the middle of it! <br>  <br>  4 room suite at the Hilton isn't my style. Too much of a nature lover. In a hotel like that there are so many ppl, it's not really 'getting away'  & with all the amenities there, you are basically being entertained by a corporation instead of using your imagination, & appreciating the world around us that so many ppl take for granted/are not even aware of.<br>  <br>  If it were not physically impossible, I think I would enjoy camping. I grew up in the country.<br>  <br>  Lastly, I love picnics. I eat outdoors whenever possible-whether it's lunch on the front porch or a packed picnic. I do like to eat at restaurants, but I don't require a 5 star. Anything from a diner to a moderately priced place w/nice atmosphere will do. I travel all over the state trying new ones w/friends.|`|aced1634cc8beb7af40e221d3df797a2aa	Love the outdoors - I am now home bound since about 2002 - unless my memory fails me.<br>  <br>  Through out the years - we took our kids camping on the desert in the spring and then up on the mountains when the desert was too hot.<br>  <br>  We tented first - then bought a tent trailer - then inherited my dads old camp trailer, which I laid outdoor carpet in - made new seat covers and new curtains- spruced it up real pretty - tried that for a few trips, but felt claustrophobic sleeping in it.<br>  <br>  Then traded the tent trailer for a posh camper that sat in the back of our new truck - the truck was bought for the new camper - which was even more claustrophobic.<br>  <br>  To make a long story short - we preferred to sleep in a tent - set up a second tent for the porta potty - sit around the camp fire while we did our dutch oven cooking or fry the catch of the day over the camp fire on a grill.<br>  <br>  When you love the outdoors - all is needed is a place to sleep or get out of the rain.<br>  <br>  I am now developing cabin fever and can't wait to sit outside and do a little bird watching.<br>  <br>  When we traveled and stayed in Hotels/Motels I always took my can of Lysol.

Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8<br>  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became<br>  flesh (John 1:1-14)<br>  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm<br>  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh<br>  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6.

In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John 8:58.<br>  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see<br>  Exodus 3:14.<br>  23.

But as is usually the case, a lot of  the next generation fell away. By the time the Constitution was written, a lot of people were marginal or nominal (in name only) type "Christians".    Calling yourself a Christian was the socially acceptable thing to do.  Occasionally a revival would come along and a lot of people would get right with God again.

A church is a body of people. He wa right, lighthouses are more useful because the church will always be corrupted and outside the governmental structure. <br>  Christianity has very little "religion" in it. Only a few verses and they only suggest how a christian should conduct themselves. <br>  Christianity is perverted, with all the false teachers and all the evangelist who milk the people and tell them life is about prosperity and living high on the hog..its all corrupted by the wicked hearts of men.<br>  <br>  So this does not discount america as not being built on a biblical foundation, because the old testament tells you that even if GOD when sitting right outside people would still sin!|`|D8SpQAgLaa	I for one do not believe it.

"<br>  <br>  "History, I believe, furnishes no example of a priest-ridden people maintaining a free civil government.

Avarice, ambition, revenge, or gallantry, would break the strongest cords of our Constitution as a whale goes through a net. Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other." --October 11, 1798<br>  <br>  "I have examined all religions, as well as my narrow sphere, my straightened means, and my busy life, would allow; and the result is that the Bible is the best Book in the world.

And if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without his notice, is it probable that an empire can rise without His aid? We have been assured in the Sacred Writings that except the Lord build the house, they labor in vain that build it. I firmly believe this. I also believe that, without His concurring aid, we shall succeed in this political building no better than the builders of Babel” –Constitutional Convention of 1787 | original manuscript of this speech<br>  <br>  “In the beginning of the contest with Britain, when we were sensible of danger, we had daily prayers in this room for Divine protection. Our prayers, Sir, were heard, and they were graciously answered… do we imagine we no longer need His assistance?” [Constitutional Convention, Thursday June 28, 1787]<br>  <br>  In Benjamin Franklin's 1749 plan of education for public schools in Pennsylvania, he insisted that schools teach "the excellency of the Christian religion above all others, ancient or modern." <br>  <br>  In 1787 when Franklin helped found Benjamin Franklin University, it was dedicated as "a nursery of religion and learning, built on Christ, the Cornerstone." <br>  <br>  Thomas Jefferson:<br>  “ The doctrines of Jesus are simple, and tend to all the happiness of man.”<br>  <br>  “Of all the systems of morality, ancient or modern which have come under my observation, none appears to me so pure as that of Jesus.”<br>  <br>  "I am a real Christian, that is to say, a disciple of the doctrines of Jesus." <br>  <br>  “God who gave us life gave us liberty. And can the liberties of a nation be thought secure when we have removed their only firm basis, a conviction in the minds of the people that these liberties are a gift from God? That they are not to be violated but with His wrath? Indeed I tremble for my country when I reflect that God is just, and that His justice cannot sleep forever.” (excerpts are inscribed on the walls of the Jefferson Memorial in the nations capital) [Source: Merrill .

This phrase is not something invented later! Prophet Muhammad (s) said that the TRUE followers of imam Ali will go to Paradise, and this is a great felicity. Also Jabir Ibn Abdillah al-Ansari narrated that: The Messenger of Allah (s) said: "The Shia of Ali are the real victorious in the day of resurrection/rising" <br>  <br>  References: <br>  <br>  al-Manaqib Ahmad, as mentioned in: <br>  Yanabi al-Mawaddah, by al-Qundoozi al-Hanafi, p62 <br>  Tafsir al-Durr al-Manthoor, by al-Hafidh Jalaluddin al-Suyuti, who quotes the tradition as follows: "We were with the Holy Prophet when Ali came towards us. The Holy Prophet said: He and his Shia will aquire salvation on the day of judgment."|`|qPSkkPqwaa	There was no shia or sunni names in the lifetime of the Prophet (saws)..<br>  That is all i know. <br>  Other than that, Only Allah knows best what happened. But im Muslim (sunni)|`|nZ4u47ZVaa	i agree with adeeb.<br>  There were no shia's or sunni's<br>  i kind of know the reason but i can't really explain it.|`|f8dz0ffFaa	asalamalykum <br>  if you are given references  you do not accept! ok i ask u to read my reply with an open mind<br>  The word "Shia" means "followers; members of party". As such, the term "Shia" alone has no negative or positive meaning unless we specify the leader of the party. If one is a Shia (follower) of the most righteous servants, then there is nothing wrong with being Shia, specially if the leader of such party has been assigned by Allah. On the other hand, if one becomes the Shia a tyrant or a wrong-doer, he shall meet with the fate of his leader. In fact, Quran indicates that on the day of Judgment people will come in groups, and each group has its leader in front of it. Allah, to whom belong Might and Majesty, said: <br>  <br>  One day We shall call every group of people by their respective Imams. (Quran 17:71) <br>  In the day of judgment, the destiny of the "followers" of each group highly depends on the destiny of his Imam (provided that they really followed that Imam). Allah mentioned in Quran that there are two types of Imams. Some Imams are those who invite people to Hell fire. They are tyrannical leaders of each era (like Pharaoh, etc.): <br>  <br>  And We made them (but) Imams inviting to the Fire; and on the Day of Judgment no help shall they find. In this world We continued to curse them; and on the Day of Judgment they will be among the hateful. (Quran 28:41-42). <br>  Certainly, being the members of the parties of such Satanic Imams has been severely denounced in Quran, and the followers of such parties will meet the fate of their leaders. However, Quran also reminds that there are Imams who are appointed by Allah as Guides for the mankind: <br>  <br>  "And We ASSIGNED from among them some Imams who GUIDE by Our authority since they were patient and believed firmly in Our Signs." (Quran 32:24) <br>  Certainly, the true followers (Shia) of these Imams will be the real prosperous on the day of resurrection. Thus being a Shia does not mean anything, unless we know the Shia of whom. Allah mentioned in Quran that Some of His righteous servants were Shia of His other righteous servants. An example was Prophet Abraham who was mentioned in Quran specifically as the Shia of Noah: <br>  <br>  "And most surely Abraham was among the Shia of him (i.e., Noah)" (Quran 37:83) <br>  Notice that the word "Shia" is explicitly used, letter by letter, in the above verse as well as the following verse.) In another verse, Quran talks about the Shia of Moses versus the enemies of Moses: <br>  <br>  "And he (Moses) went into the city at a time when people (of the city) were not watching, so he found therein two men fighting, one being of his Shia and the other being his enemy, and the one who was of his Shia cried out to him for help against the one who was of his enemy" (Quran 28:15) <br>  In the above verse of Quran, one is named the Shia of Moses (AS) and the other one is named the enemy of Moses, and the people at that time were either the Shia or the enemy of Moses (AS). Thus Shia is an official word used by Allah in His Quran for His high rank prophets as well as their followers. Do you want to say Prophet Abraham was sectarian? How about Prophet Noah and Prophet Moses? <br>  <br>  If somebody calls himself a Shia, it is not due to any sectarianism, nor any innovation. It is because Quran has used the phrase for some of His best servants. The above verses that I mentioned in support of Shia, has used this term singular form (i.e., one group of followers). This means that it has special meaning, such as: THE Shia of Noah (AS), THE Shia of Moses (AS). Also in the History of Islam, Shia has been specially used for the "followers of Ali". The first individual who used this term was the Messenger of Allah himself: <br>  <br>  The Messenger of Allah said to Ali: "Glad tiding O Ali! Verily you and your companions and your Shia (followers) will be in Paradise<br>  Sunni references: <br>  <br>  Fadha'il al-Sahaba, by Ahmad Ibn Hanbal, v2, p655 <br>  Hilyatul Awliyaa, by Abu Nu'aym, v4, p329 <br>  Tarikh, by al-Khateeb al-Baghdadi, v12, p289 <br>  al-Awsat, by al-Tabarani <br>  Majma' al-Zawa'id, by al-Haythami, v10, pp 21-22 <br>  al-Darqunti, who said this tradition has been transmitted via numerous authorities. <br>  al-Sawa'iq al-Muhriqah, by Ibn Hajar Haythami , Ch. 11, section 1, p247 <br>  Thus the Messenger of Allah (PBUH&HF) used to say the phrase of "Shia of Ali". This phrase is not something invented later! Prophet Muhammad (PBUH&HF) said that the TRUE followers of imam Ali will go to Paradise, and this is a great felicity.

Dirty children.  NO, it is not a matter of money.  People hear me say that and they say, "oh, they don't have alot of money."  Neither do I, and I always could afford water and a paper towel to wash my kids' faces.  And a brush for a little girl's hair isn't that expensive.  Please, clean your children and brush their hair.<br>  6.  I work in a retail store and I hate when customers ask me a question, but don't believe me whenI tell them the answer.  <br>  Example:  I had a lady who wanted to buy stamps at our customer service counter.  I told her we do not sell stamps.  She proceeded to tell me that she purchased them there last week and I didn't know my job.  I explain that I have worked there since the store opened and we never sold stamps.  She insisted she got them from ME last week.  I explained that the grocery store down the street has them and she must have gotten us confused.<br>  7.  BAD, INCONSIDERATE DRIVERS:  yes, I have places to go and I am in a hurry, but I stop at all stop signs and lights.  I use my turn signal and only pull out when it is safe to do so, and that doesn't mean pull out and assume the other driver coming will slam their brakes.  If I have to slam my brakes when you pulled out, you shouldn't have pulled out.  Then there is the driver who will pull out and not even accelerate, but when you try to pass, they want to speed up.  I will run you off the road and not look back.  I understand that many others have somewhere to be just like me, but just because you are running late is not a reason to risk my life with your reckless driving.  Try leaving your house earlier.  We have a bunch of snow birds here in FL, and they drive 30 mph on a 60 mph highway while they sightsee.  I know they may be on vacation, but I am not.  I have places to go.  They wonder why no one likes them.  It is because many are inconsiderate to our daily lives, while we go to and from work and school, they clog up the roads going half the speed limit as if they are the only ones on the road.  Please enjoy our area, but go the speed limit and pay attention to where you are going.  Then there are the lane mergers.  They realize they are in the right turn only lane and don't want to turn right.  There is plenty of signs to indicate that, but they don't try to get over until the last minute and with no warning they try to swerve in front of me.  NO GO here.  If you respected me, took a moment and use your turn signal to alert me to what you are doing, I will let you over.  But if you just try to run and squeeze me out, I am willing to play crash derby.  I have insurance and you'll buy me a new car since you made an illegal lane change.  A little side swipe action doesn't intimidate me.  I see that as a challenge.  Despite my road rage, I must be dong something right.  In 16 years of driving, I have never even had a fender bender.|`|Z6kjwFcHaa	I hate it when people don't take hints.  Like when you don't like a guy but they keep pushing for your number and for dates and stuff, after you've clearly hinted that you don't like them.|`|AA11627889	People who feel the need to give you unsolicited advice, especially strangers. Also older people who try to make jokes at my expense. <<I don't know if that makes sense exactly, what I mean is, because I'm relatively young, older people seem to think they know me to a T. That is, the music I like, the type of attitude I have and how I live my days and they provide commentary in order to be funny or find common ground with other older people in social situations.|`|KBaeecQzaa	Rude people. Disrespectful people.<br>  Strangers who treat me like if they know me from a lot of years ago.<br>  People who often assume I have a lot of money because I look like if I was from Europe.|`|brUt1Fupaa	People who honk their horn to indicate displeasure.  The horn is supposed to be used as an ALERT.  In fact, if you're driving then honking the horn can divert your attention from the road and increase the risk of an accident, especially since it can potentially divert the attention of multiple drivers (all those nearby).|`|WaYZQhnHaa	People who go through a door (at a store, for example), and let it shut without looking to see if someone was right behind them.<br>  <br>  And... when you hold a door open for someone, and they just walk through without so much as a "thank you", or without taking the door from you.  Like they think you're the designated door service or something.  lol|`|1TrRrWMLaa	People who are rude, people who tap their pencils, or anything, that really upsets me. Also people talking with food in their mouths.|`|0pVXLyGhaa	I hate left hand turns!
yJZeRu5Vaa	you have to make the decision if his friendship is worth putting up with the rumors. sounds swell to me|`|kS77uSjuaa	you should follow your heart<br>  i know that sounds so cliche but it can really help|`|R1FjOFkUaa	You're not doing anything wrong at all. Just continue being friends with him because you seem to have a really great friendship going on there =]|`|40dUfARwaa	dont give a **** what other people think<br>  tell them to go **** themselves<br>  you guys are just friends, and others cant deal with that. <br>  dont stop hanging out with him just because of people, and explain to your family about him<br>  <br>  people shouldnt judge people based on looks<br>  hes human and they should have a mutual respect for him|`|iLIQIqvLaa	if you feel comfortable then it shouldnt really matter what other people think. sure right now, what others are thinking means everything to you, but you are the one who is getting a close relationship with him not anyone else so they shouldn't be worrying about it. what other people have to say about you won't mean anything in a few years from now when you'll most likely be out of highschool but will still have this friend by your side and there for you. everyone is equal, people are people, maybe they should all get to know this guy and they will find out how cool he is like you did.|`|vTra7n5baa	This is not at all strange, but feels different to you because you have never ventured outside your own social circle or comfort zone.  What you're describing is called growing and and getting life experience.  If other around you can't see that then they are unworthy of your attention and are ignorant.  Plus, this has much more to do with having an open mind than it does sexuality so stop even thinking about sex as far as this situation is concerned.  Be thankful you have a new friend because one day, you will be old and alone with no one to talk to.|`|rCWga8SOaa	its okay to be sensitive ..jesus was sensitive<br>  i understand your situation but icannot put it into words|`|ggMDAo0Kaa	I have friends of all kinds and glad I do.|`|ApX89NKiaa	It is perfectly natural to feel the way you do. Its called "true friendship" when you really like a person for their morals and personality you become close with them. He sounds like a great guy and you should be proud to have a friend like him. to you he is different, new and mysterious plus you see he is more open and accepting of others. As for your family sit them down and tell them exactly how you feel about him. That he is a great and honest person and you really like him a lot but you just like him as a best friend. If they love you they will understand and if you figure out that it might be something more, well who is someone else to tell you who you can and cannot love? If your friends and family are really true they wont disown or tolerate you but accept you for who you are. Best of Luck!|`|VHaSKFC2aa	It sounds like you've found an actual friend. <br>  <br>  Its SO amazing that he's weathered all of the gossip and rumors of high school and still stayed warm and optimistic, its very hard. <br>  <br>  Now you have to decide if you want to go back to your seemingly shallow friends (because seriously, we're still making fun of people about being different?! After high school everything changes.) or if you want to stay with this person that has already enriched your life.<br>  <br>  Yes, you will have to go through some gossip and people being mean, but just think, he did that alone, so you can do it with him. It sounds like a fun challenge to me. It also sounds like you have someone who will stand beside you as a true friend instead of instantly slashing you for changing your ways (IE your old friends). <br>  <br>  Its sad that you can't stay friends with both, but if there's a way you can help others understand how nice this guy is then maybe they'll stop being arses.<br>  <br>  About your parents, if they are concerned for you and your sexuality you can sit them down one night, like in a casual way at dinner, and tell that that although you like this person, you're just friends with him. That you've found out that he's a nice fellow and that you're secure in what you want. :)|`|ZqXUduJMaa	It's hard to hang out with anyone who's "different" - but you have developed a real friendship with this guy. Real friends are hard to find, and the most precious thing you can have in life. <br>  <br>  After you get out of high school, it won't be as big a deal. Try to ignore what everyone says and enjoy your friendship. It doesn't make you gay to have a gay friend.
AA10819407	I would say any finger you are comfortable wearing it on...|`|0lnamekJaa	I ONLY wear rings on my left hand... <br>  <br>  I wear one on my "ring finger" and one on my middle finger... And sometimes a pinky ring when I want to wear all gold and can't wear my silver middle finger ring. <br>  <br>  I'm not married... <br>  <br>  Wear it on any finger you want... It doesn't matter any more...|`|FKR45WLPaa	It doesn't really matter if it doesn't look like an engagement ring.  I have always worn rings on my left ring finger just because I am right-handed.  Wearing it on my right hand felt like a hindrance.  If it makes you uncomfortable, wear it on your right ring finger.|`|TNH8QMOaaa	Any finger except the left hand ring finger as it is the reserved finger for an engagement ring.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  B2CJewels.com<br>  <a href="http://www.b2cjewels.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.b2cjewels.com/</a>|`|DgCRryxFaa	I would wear it on my ring finger on my right hand, but I think any finger except your left ring finger would be okay.|`|vxeMZXrgaa	~right~|`|gMnFZELKaa	right hand ring finger or middle finger on either hand
nkMbQFv7aa	Be yourself|`|Wb7n512Waa	A person’s thoughts, habits, and lifestyle and desires are tremendously influenced by family, education, society, and public opinion. If you develop within some tendency to like things that aren't affirmed in your society then it would be natural that it is dampened by the lack of support. If you feel strongly about your preferences then perhaps you could overcome the opposing pressure of society in two ways. One is to immerse yourself in media, books and internet materials that go along with your preferences and find a group of people to hang out with either virtual or real that agrees with your tended preferences and ideas. I would add that the degree that you feel a great  purpose to be in association with your preferences the more that you can hold on to it against society. An example of that is that if a person wears the color pink all the time even if it is out of style but the reason for wearing it is because he wants to expand breast cancer awareness in the world. So in this example you see some feeling of importance is associated with wearing pink in this persons eyes.<br>  <br>  Here is a very good video about how our desires are influenced by inner and out pressures:<br>  <a href="http://www.kabbalah.info/engkab/kabbalah-video-clips/free-will" rel="nofollow">http://www.kabbalah.info/engkab/kabbalah...</a>

U7EARdCkaa	What the hell,,,,,,if you gotta go ,,,you gotta go,,,|`|KBxz1Wfyaa	I live in a rural area so taking a tinkle if you happen to be out on your property or traveling a back road is the norm.  Many years ago some friends and I were riding around on the back roads and the urge hit.  As we finished and got into the car, who should happen along but a county deputy.  It was a cold night and after he saw we weren't drunk but just stopped to pee he had a good laugh because when he shined his flashlight at the side of the road he found the evidence on the snow.|`|ac825b3aff0d9322a9befa72bcf651f6aa	If you need to go,then you have to, there is no alternative,you can only hold it for so long. <br>  He must have heard her sigh<br>  Your idea of the law could very well be true. There are numerous daft laws that haven't been repealed..<br>   I wouldn't advise anyone to test the validity though|`|g0gMQUCVaa	I'm pretty sure it's illegal to do both.  I think in the country it's okay but I think there's a health issue in cities.|`|iNkOiNC7aa	u from one of the colonies?|`|bLARMYAfaa	If you gotta go, you gotta go! Your body's needs are more compelling for you than any law. <br>  <br>  Now if you do it in a unpopulated rural area without rest stops, the cop arresting you would have to be a particular numbskull to do so, but in a city or suburb there are health issues. In such places, you'd always find a Stewarts or gas station that will let you use the facilities if you buy a coffee. Now if you defecate outside, cover it/bury it as far as possible, and avoid being near water.|`|hXQnR2Scaa	Relieving oneself in public is illegal regardless of whether you defecate or urinate.

When you've been together for years, you don't think twice. Honestly, you try to fart :)|`|Iu0AJDviaa	Yup,sure do- Our favorite game is fart tennis.<br>  And when i fart in front of the kids,i say ' gee we've gotta get that creaky floor fixed'  and they laugh their heads off. hehehe!|`|ytl2PONXaa	If I had a significant other then yes I would. <br>  <br>  Farting is normal.|`|GtPnXzPAaa	We like to fart and play "Guess what I had for luch today?"|`|ShaUAySvaa	what the? i suppose farting is a language lol!|`|rMhJceVuaa	hahaha yea but weve been together for like 3 years|`|ldAJ3Et8aa	3 of us.|`|65lTdKNgaa	only if i knew them for long enough!

VRsu7c3Paa	A school counselor most likely will not be trained for that, and will most likely won't remain confidential. What you want is to find a therapist that is LGBT friendly, or a social worker at an LGBT youth center. Usually it's confidential where they won't tell your anybody anything unless you are causing yourself or others harm, or if there is a court order. <br>  <br>  You can see a therapist, if you need to you can tell your parents you're having troubles in school and want to see a therapist. You can look on lambda business for gay youth services in your area.|`|JYXDj402aa	hmm, im not sure if they can actually do something about it. but they will definitly listen to your problems if you just need to talk to someone.<br>  best of luck to you :)|`|aWcD7Ou5aa	You need to talk to someone.  I don't know if the counselor will tell your parents, they may.  They do have hot lines for teen mental health that you can call. I am googleing it right now so I can give you some numbers, if you want you can e-mail me. Remember, there's always tomorrow unless you end your life, then, you have nothing.  I found the number, its 131 114.  Love ya!|`|FJPKtZN5aa	hey i know exactly how you feel i have a medical condition that know one knows what it was for all of the summer and fall and there still not 100% sure , and i used to/still do feel like i want to die., if you want to talk you can talk to me. xmcrguyx@yahoo.com|`|plBN572qaa	i would suggest doing volunteer work....with your friends as well<br>  <br>  why not help somebody in need, you know?|`|3RQkgTSOaa	Unless one of your school counselors actually IS gay, they'd probably be way in over their heads with this one. Are there any free clinics, crisis help lines or LGBT community centers where you live? They would probably be more likely to be able to help. If not with ACTUAL counseling at least with getting you involved in dealing with others with similar backgrounds and issues. Even TALKING to someone about this kind of stuff can help (someone you trust) but you have to be sure they're qualified to handle the issues you'll be throwing at them.<br>  <br>  There might also be some online opportunities but really a face-to-face is the best way to deal with something like this.<br>  <br>  Come to think of it, your school counselors may not be able to handle this but they should know of someone who can. There are some professionals who are very generous with their time and may be able to provide some guidance free of charge.<br>  <br>  One word of caution: be careful about revealing the fact that you've got thoughts of suicide. Some schools/institutions are required by law to report students to their parents who mention such things. Just a warning...<br>  <br>  Good luck. Keep us posted.
naPYuaDQaa	are men to blame for female homosexuality?<br>  <br>  It's in ur deoxyribose nucleic acid my friend but yes sometimes there can be traumatic events in your life that may change someone's sexuality.|`|6ELSwKKvaa	There is not a heterosexual man alive that has said to himself "I am sick of woman's Bullspit, I think I want a d*ck up my butt." It just doesn't happen, so you might want to get that idea out of your head.<br>  <br>    People are gay because that is how they were made.

As a front to hide their inner fear, towards people who are a different, color, race, gender, sexual orientation or non or religious beliefs. <br>  <br>  Which goes both ways, just as you are being taunted and targeted in the USA because of your beliefs. Outside the USA, Americans are called terrorist, murders,  rapist and oil thieves. They too are spat at or are verbally or physically bashed or taunted daily. <br>  <br>  Because of the acts of the mass genocide and illigal torture of over a million plus innocent people in a soverign nation by their previous warmongering president.<br>  <br>  If more Americans were to see and experience what they give out dished back onto them everyday. They would know being xenophobic and racist towards other people who are different from them is wrong.|`|g2JlIuRcaa	sadly racism will never die in this country.

I'd tell a counseler but im sure they are just as racist. Be proud of who you are and don't buy into their bs.   If it makes you feel better we have a black president.

My daughter married an Afghan young man, so I know how you are feeling. Ignorance is bliss and no one can say they are responsible for their actions and beliefs because it's easier to go along with the crowd than stand up for something you don't agree with. We don't ask whites or blacks why they wear baseball caps backwards, wear pants around their knees, get tattoos, etc.  Why should they ask why you wear your traditional clothing.  Sometimes America isn't so free after all is it? But mostly it's fear of not knowing or understanding.<br>  <br>  Be well
vDG0iA8laa	I, as a long time married transvestite, think body hair on either gender serves NO purpose whatsoever, so why have it around...  I've been shaving my entire body hair for eons, and I quite truthfully can't ever see the day when I would let ANY of it grow back..<br>  Those so called macho males who let their body hair grown I guess are auditioning for the remake of King Kong, and the g/g s who don't shave their pubes - should. No one wants to floss whilst eating..<br>  Rachelle In High Heels|`|fN4fpRntaa	i like feeling up my guys with hairy legs. i have always preferred hair on my men, maybe some chest hair to accent well developed pecs. mmm...<br>  <br>  but men with great legs, and hairy ones are simply an orgasm! <br>  <br>  i have shaved my legs in the past, and did not like it, so i let the hair grow out. and yes, men with hairy anything are HOT!!!!!! ;)|`|5akAfzB3aa	I like hair. Smooth, I'm less fussed on, but it doesn't bother me so long as it doesn't look artificial. Too many guys today like the forcibly smooth look.|`|4azCh1aeaa	idc if his leg is hairy or not it doesnt matter to me.<br>  i do not shave my legs!
LF2t9DPZaa	An agnostic is a person who believes that it is impossible to know for sure whether a god exists.<br>  <br>  The word is often misused to refer to a person who is merely unsure or undecided on the issue; this is not really a correct usage of the word.<br>  <br>  It is not a religion in the usual sense; it merely describes a particular belief a person might hold.|`|UinOWcMUaa	People who are Agnostic belive.. or rather<br>  <br>  either...<br>  don't personally know. <br>  don't know but will lead my life in the assumption that no God exists. <br>  don't know but will lead my life assuming that God does exist. <br>  cannot give an opinion because there is no way that we can prove the existence or non-existence of God given currently available knowledge. <br>  cannot give an opinion because there is no way to know, with certainty, anything about God, now and in the future. <br>  <br>  Know, God exists. But we do not know anything about God at this time.|`|AA10192697	it's not a religion but a belief. Agnostics haven't figured out if a diety exists or not. They are open to both sides without taking a side.  If GOd is proven to them , then they'll accept Him and be ok with it. If God is proven not to exist, then they accept that and are ok with it.<br>  <br>  They are open to whatever the truth without looking for it themselves.|`|Hf1UkrWXaa	It's not a religion. You are not stupid at all for asking either. It's being intellectually honest in saying that there probably is no god, but i don't know if there is a god. It's saying "i don't know, and i'm okay with that" to everyone.|`|2x37XgxCaa	Agnostic is a term used to describe a person who can't make up their mind.  They "sort of" believe in Christ Jesus, but they don't want to commit to Him...so they sit on the fence.  The Bible tells us that you can't serve two masters...you will cling to one and hate the other.  I pray that you will ask the Lord to come into your heart and discover that He is real.|`|f1e8a20a0e5d8904fb72bbeeeca190d8aa	It means you are clueless.|`|Gn6jwmzCaa	Agnosticism is for people who would at least like to believe that life is not just "you live then you die and everything goes black".<br>  <br>  Agnosticism is for people who at least hold out HOPE that there is some kind of afterlife where they will see friends and family again.<br>  <br>  Agnosticism is for people who do not DEMAND to have all the answers for which there are no answers...they are content in ignorance and patient in waiting until death for the answers.<br>  <br>  Agnosticism is NOT for people who need to use books written by man to tell them what god looks like and what god's personality is like....followed by demands that everyone else believe the way they do, or die a violent death at the hands of a god worshipper.<br>  <br>  Agnostics DO NOT sort of kind of believe in Jesus...they reject any and all forms of religion as stupidity. Jlk dude is the type of person I just described in my above description.<br>  <br>  That is my definition... :-)|`|fuPqQPvtaa	It's not a religion, it's a philosophy.  It proposes: "I don't know."<br>  <br>  So you could be an agnostic Christian or an agnostic Atheist.  You can be uncertain about a belief and still hold it.|`|idRvGHOEaa	It's when you can't decide if God exists or not, like a fence rider. It's not a religion, but more of a crisis of faith.|`|Vjan4Vq2aa	Let's break down the word elements:<br>  Agnostic: "a"-not+"gno"-know: A person who does not know.|`|TAvPmMQ3aa	<a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=What+is+Agnostic%3F" rel="nofollow">http://lmgtfy.com/?q=What+is+Agnostic%3F</a><br>  <br>  <br>  OH So HARD!|`|K8QTdUnfaa	A legitimate position of one who is ready to question religion but not ready to give up god.|`|VY5Scj9zaa	it means that you dont know if there is a god or not and there is no way of knowing. at least not now.|`|UFMvhn2Gaa	"I don't know"

Ask him all the questions you are wondering and see where that goes... apparently, you aren't going to get to him through text or phone calls... and if you proceed to call and text him, he's gonna think you're crazy.|`|cpOMMZffaa	It sounds like he's pulling your strings.<br>  Maybe moving on would be best, because if he's going to do that to you, it isn't worth it.|`|DIj072Sqaa	I think you've done what you can, move on. If he's interested he'll resume contact. Maybe he has his eyes set elsewhere or he's otherwise focused. (Saying that I'm awful at responding to people but I have my reasons)<br>  <br>  I should add my reasons being that I'm in a relationship so any flirting beyond that tends to result with the person being ignored even if I like them.
Rn4GXoJAaa	I have been personally and physically attacked when I was in school, not really since then. The funny thing is, at least two of those atheists became believers before we graduated. It was really awesome! <br>  <br>  As for my fam, they are not believers sadly.|`|NCRfZRopaa	1. Like others have said, apostrophes are not used for plural nouns. <br>  2. Atheists have never gone after my family nor do I know of any other family that has been "attacked" by atheists. <br>  <br>  You've seen this happen... but that is what you've seen. It's not on mass scale. Besides, you're the majority. Most Christians have attacked atheists for being immoral, amoral, etc. Christians have attacked us saying we'll burn in hell forever. It's also VERY hard for atheists to get into the government.<br>  <br>  We're not trying to corrupt you and other theists. Most of us just want to give people an injection of critical thinking and logic.<br>  <br>  As for laws... should women be a lower rate citizen and second to their husbands (Mark 10:29-30, Luke 2:23, 5:11, 18:29-30, Roman 1:27 and so on)? Should we be damned for having thought-crimes?<br>  <br>  God seems like the proverbial Big Brother. He may be possibly be evil  for ignoring the pleas of many people throughout the world.

That is Satan's biggest mission is to destroy us all.<br>  <br>  He has no problem with the atheists and non-believers, and those claiming to walk with God, but only show so on the face, so these ones are in the power of Satan, but his ultimate goal is to cause those of us loving Jehovah God to stumble and lose our narrow road to salvation.<br>  <br>  Beware of atheists, liars --- those claiming to be one thing but living just as the rest of the filthy world does.|`|03c287c9e9e2feef723946b70ad122f4aa	Nope<br>  <br>   With God before us, who could be against us.|`|czf6uhIraa	"trying to deliberately corrupt"<br>  <br>  Really...|`|FjiRPKp2aa	By get at what are you talking about?

Two weeks ago, they wrote some nasty messages on the walls of the room the Christian kids met in for Bible club, and some Christians have been complaining about being bullied in the hallways. It does worry me to see this increased violence toward Christians in the school system. I know some of these Christian kids, and I don't think they were being evangelical, they were just meeting to pray every afternoon.|`|075c7DdDaa	You don't use an apostrophe for plural nouns!|`|Y3LPXeuEaa	No, no, no...you use apostrophes in contractions and you do not use them in plural nouns.

Don’t let this chance pass you by be confident don’t worry at all and a simple tip: know what you are going to say before you talk to him and wear perfume that way you will leave him your memory and presence plus you will smell good.

ZoSKEChqaa	Do things for others when you are assured of gain. Turn it into a game. Start calling it points when people trust you more etc. Use those points to manipulate them and control them, for gain. This is where I get my motivation. I'm a guy who needs motivation for the simplest things but I will always find a way.<br>  <br>  What I'm saying here is unethical but you can do it in such a way that you will never get caught and you can make it all legal. This is a sociopath's way of life, but a smart one at that.<br>  <br>  One last thing, and this is the number one rule of my life. I never let anyone control me emotionally. I never depend on anyone. They depend on me. I set it up like this to feel like I don't have to feel guilty about being rude by accident, etc. Getting to this stage is a walk in the park if you use a certain chemical to numb certain parts of your brain permanently.|`|pUIGCtaZaa	Even though most people with morals are labeled as being "boring", you are so much better off having a set of good morals that will guide you in life. When immorality comes into play, people make choices that put them in the wrong situation and most of these situations can have a negative impact on you for the rest of your life.|`|DgCRryxFaa	Being moral kinda seems like something stuffy but it's actually best for you.  When you are considerate of others, you are well-liked.  Being well-liked is definitely not losing in life.  Helping others will make you have a sort of happiness that you can't get from being selfish.|`|v0l1JEloaa	Don't stop being moral!

If you have a reputation of being selfish, you'll most likely end up alone.|`|I9CD3ORQaa	Honestly, there is really little correlation between doing good things for others and having good come your way.  There's no karmic force out in the universe that will reward your good behavior with good things in your life right now - it's just not as easy as "My Name is Earl."<br>  <br>  But, you should still go on being a good, moral person.  You'll find that the better a person you are, the better people will be toward you.  Don't confuse this with my previous statement, though.  There's no guarantee that good things will happen due to your good action, but people will likely be nicer to you because you were nicer to them, and will do so because of the way you treat others.  People don't like to be nice to a$$holes.  They'll work around them, and sometimes cave into their a$$holeness, but won't be happy doing so.  I don't know how people can live with themselves being rude and mean to everyone.<br>  <br>  Anyway, do good always.|`|RWgjnwl9aa	The only one who will lose out will be you!

I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16 tells us that the Bible was "breathed out" by God.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1: 11-12 tells us that the gospel was a revelation from Jesus Christ himself, which was recorded by Jesus disciples and Paul.<br>  <br>  God himself chose the disciples and the people whom He knew were going to spread His word and write the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors. The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist?

As far as I know Jesus Christ is the Son of God and Michael the Archangel is in charge of all angels.  All three has separate roles and separate names and separate ranks.  If all three have separate roles, ranks, and jobs; how in the Universe can they be all one and the same?  Why would God send Michael down to be Jesus?  Michael already is assigned to his rank and duty.  Jesus is assigned to his rank and duty.  Each has their own place to be and their own duty to carry out.  If that be so that Michael can turn (become) into Jesus just because he wants too, then that leaves open the fact that Jehovah can turn (become) Jesus just because he wants too.<br>  My answer is No.  Jehovah God Almighty (One Supreme God), Jesus Christ, Son of the Almighty God, Michael the Archangel the Chief of the Angels.|`|140b1c561177bc5cc3baf4ae5b15a6a8aa	No.<br>  Michael is an angel.<br>  <br>  In your Jude 9 verse, Michael does NOT say, "I rebuke thee." to Satan, but "The Lord rebuke thee."

From that time he began to be called dragon, serpent, devil and satan, imposed upon him by the holy archangel in that battle as a testimony of his iniquity and malice.  Deprived of the happiness and honor, of which he had become unworthy, he was despoiled also of his names and honorable titles, acquiring in their stead such as designate his ignominy.  The wicked plans which he proposed and enjoined upon his confederates, namely, that they should deceive and pervert all those that live in the world, manifest sufficiently his wickedness.  He therefore, who intended to scourge the nations, was consigned to hellish regions, as Isaias says in the fourteenth chapter, to the profound abyss, and his cadaver was delivered to the moth and the worm of his own bad conscience; thus was fulfilled in Lucifer all that the prophet says in that chapter.<br>  <br>  Saint Michael the Archangel (celebrated on September 29th). In Hebrew, the name Michael means “Who is like God?” and it is said that this name is used by the other angels as a battle cry when fighting the enemy Satan. It is believed that Michael is the prince of all the other Angels. He has been invoked as the patron and protector of the Church since the time of the apostles. Michael is mentioned four times in the Scriptures: In Daniel 10:12 he is referred to as “one of the chief princes;” In Daniel 12, concerning the end of the world it says “at that time Michael the prince shall rise up and fight for the people;” In the Epistle of Jude, verse 9, we read “Even the Archangel Michael, when his case was being judged” (this is a reference to an ancient non-biblical account of a dispute between Michael and Satan); In Revelation 12:7-9 we have the story of the great battle in heaven between Michael with his angels and the dragon who is Satan; these verses read: “Then a war broke out in heaven; Michael and his angels battled against the dragon. Although the dragon and his angels fought back, they were overpowered and lost their place in heaven. The huge dragon, the ancient serpent known as the devil or Satan, the seducer of the whole world, was driven out; he was hurled down to earth and his minions with him” (NAB). Many non-scriptural references have been made about the Archangel Michael throughout history by different peoples and cultures; even today he venerated by Jewish, Christian and Islamic people. In this window Michael is shown standing above the slain dragon (a reference to Michael’s triumph over Satan). He holds the sword used to slay the dragon upright in his right hand (notice that the tip of the sword is not within the frame of the panel–indicating that it is actually much longer). He wears the armor of a knight; the shield held with his left hand bears the Latin inscription “Quis ut Deus” which refers to the meaning of his name, “Who is like God?” Michael the Archangel is the patron saint of artists, bakers, bankers, coopers, dying people, fencing, Germany, grocers, hat-makers, holy death, knights, paramedics, paratroopers, police officers, radiologists, sailors, security guards, sick people, soldiers, storms at sea, sword-smiths and watermen.|`|Vjan4Vq2aa	No. Jesus is God, not like him.|`|mTWLCsmzaa	Nope.<br>  <br>   It does speak of how Micheal and the angels will wage war. And Jesus will lead...

Revelation 1:1–2<br>  <br>  V4 - "...having become as much better than the angels, as He has inherited a more excellent name than they.<br>  <br>  v5 - "For to which of the angels did He ever say, 'You are my Son, today I have begotten You.'? And again, 'I will be a Father to Him and He shall be a Son to Me.'?<br>  <br>  v6 - "And when He again brings the firstborn into the world, He says, 'And let all the angels of God worship Him.'<br>  <br>  v7 - "And of the angels He says, 'Who makes His angels winds, and His ministers a flame of fire.'<br>  <br>  v8 - "But of the Son He says, "Your throne, O God, is forever and ever, and the righteous scepter is the scepter of His kingdom.|`|nGyOmjPsaa	No.  But great job if you wanted to sound like a Jehovah's Witness!  Haha! :)<br>  If that were so then his name would be closer to that of Jesus' name. "God saves" along those lines.  You would have to understand the nature of angels and their ranking.  In short (I don't feel like explaining it to you because I think you can do the research on your own) there is the Archangel, the Cherubim and the Seraphem and the lower rank angels.  The Archangel is considered God's soldier, his right hand man, his sidekick, his wingman, you get the picture.  He is the closest to God in relationship compared to the other angels.<br>  Jesus is God, the Son of God and one with the Holy Spirit and God the Father.  This is the Trinity and the Archangel, as much as we love him, is not part of the Trinity.  Sorry about your luck, cowboy.<br>  God bless+

XqpRYh52aa	More Christianity's twist on the bible rather than the bible itself.<br>  Christianity is a fear based religion.It teaches that god should be feared and also if was not fear based then the concept of hell would not be necessary.|`|ylaGS5EHaa	Depends on the nature of the universe/eternity. If God has arbitrarily set up the rules and the consequences then, yes, it is fear. If on the other hand there are certain eternal principles that God tries to teach us like a parent tries to teach their child so that we may avoid the consequences of wrong actions, then it is love that it is based off of.|`|Eo7KcX3Waa	No, the bible is written by God, and fear is not of God, satan deals with putting fear in people's mind, and he is a liar...<br>  So satan tells everyone that wants to believe him that God is threatening us with fear, so that nobody would want to serve Him...|`|iHDYncuXaa	No. There is no fear in the main message, which is God's love and grace which comes through his gift of salvation.|`|P5ZkSjyQaa	Most religions keep their followers in line with fear.|`|BFcVLRc2aa	Well I'd like to think so, but others CLAIM it's 'love'.

Ironically none of Jesus' public sermons had any reference to Hell. (Paul and the early church plugged in those falsified Jesus quotes about 60 to 100 years after Jesus died.)|`|3BB9drn6aa	You summed it up very nicely. It is true; the main premise of the bible is fear, as well as control. If you do not do this or believe this, you will burn in a lake of fire and brimstone for all eternity; simple as that. You answered your own question really.|`|YzA8KXqkaa	fear leads to cowering<br>  cowering leads to shame<br>  shame leads to anger<br>  anger leads to rebellion<br>  rebellion leads to freedom<br>  <br>  "The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want him for long."<br>  - Ernest Hemingway|`|Y3LPXeuEaa	I don't think the bible has a main premise.

The main do's and don't's. Simple, don't lie, don't steal, don't covet, don't cheat, etc. Be good to strangers, help neighbors, do good in your community, take care of the planet, etc. Simple.  And then to spread His word to all you meet.  Simple.  If this scares you then you scare easily.|`|e8a42257dd2b34817d2020222ee63839aa	Love.<br>  <br>  If people tell you that the message of the Bible is "you're going to hell" they're probably twisting scripture around to make it fit some of their political agenda.<br>  <br>  Jesus said He gave us one preeminent commandment:  Love one another.|`|yHD5wVopaa	The Bible is, for the most part, too complex to have a "main premise." Each Book of the Bible has its own. I suppose the closest thing to a general premise is the idea that the Bible describes people's relationships with God. The relationship varies from Book to Book in the Bible, and in some places, it is built on fear. In others, it is built on love. And in yet more Books, the main premise deals with human nature itself.|`|R1LvhhTeaa	No - mostly it's a history of a people - a history of what they thought of god - a big pile of morals and advice.  There's fear used, but it's pretty minor.  I think you'll find that the real use of fear comes from the modern fascist christians.|`|xZ1GD4zbaa	then why does it tell us that God Himself came here to rescue us from our own actions?<br>  <br>  Why does it say He loved us, He even died for us, even when we were still His enemy and hated Him.<br>  <br>  Don't hate Him? Then why do you fear Him?|`|g4AAZRuxaa	Yes it is to Fear the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.

ebc5fdfac8f50e088056beb5d5d6f767aa	In the early stages of Sumerian culture, the gods and goddesses who<br>  formed groups were indistinguishable from demons. They were vaguely<br>  defined, and had changing shapes. When attempts were made to depict them they were represented in many varying forms. Some were winged bulls or lions with human heads; others had even more remarkable composite forms. The "dragon of Babylon", for instance, which was portrayed on walls of temples, had a serpent's head, a body covered with scales, the fore legs of a lion, hind legs of an eagle, and a long wriggling serpentine tail. Ea had several monster forms. <br>  <br>  "lamassu", depicted as a winged bull with human head, the protector of<br>  palaces; the "alu" was a bull-like demon of tempest, and there were<br>  also many composite, distorted, or formless monsters which were<br>  vaguely termed "seizers" or "overthrowers", the Semitic "labashu" and<br>  "ach-chazu", the Sumerian "dimmea" and "dimme-kur". A dialectic form of "gallu" or devil was "mulla". Professor Pinches thinks it not improbable that "mulla" may be connected with the word "mula", meaning "star."<br>  <br>  The "Golden Calf" of the Hebrews was a Bull. Moses had it destroyed and the later Christians demonized those Gods it represented.|`|MHMndoCcaa	The Gallu - The Gallu was said to take the form of a bull and roamed the streets at night.|`|8c4df1df3be917b865cf9c92a0982e79aa	Zanoilie......He was a Babylonian Demon known to take the form Of a bull in the site of people!!!!|`|PvIutORkaa	that's not a question about skin

I think people should just put aside their differences and treat everyone equally. just because people with mental conditions see the world differently doesnt mean that WE should look at them differently because once you get to know them they are like all the rest  of us anyways because ultimately, we all see the world in our own way. Also I think some people take a lot of things for granted. Just wake up and realize that there is soo much to live for and that you are that one making yourself miseralble and the only one that can make it better is you.

They were systematically murdered, enslaved or shoved out of their homes. They been almost entirely eradicated due to disease, poverty,suicide, and murder. They've been forced onto reservations which are controlled by the government and therefore cannot accept outside helpful donations from others.  Most reservations are without running water in the house so they have wake up early in order to travel miles to wells in order to get water. Many aren't lucky enough to get the water they need.  Their schools are sub par at best and absolutely horrid at worst which means they can't get the education they need in order to make their lives better. They loose a little bit of their culture every year. They suffer an unemployment rate that doubles the National average.They are routinely ignored or just plain forgotten about by the rest of us. <br>  <br>  <br>  However, it's not important who gets "the most abuse." What is important is finding a way to overrule the abuse suffered by all races of people. It's important to heal the racial rift we have in our culture. It's important for us to come together as sisters and brothers, not African people and Caucasian people and Asian people and Native American people.|`|6SwaWSoyaa	Actually, as a person of black and white mix, I can honestly say that I think Native Americans and Muslims are discriminated against the most.<br>  <br>  Some people may wonder why Native Americans?<br>  <br>  think about it.<br>  a) people call them Indians which they really aren't.<br>  b) they were the original slaves, but then early settlers decided they were too weak so they killed them off.<br>  c) they have the highest suicide rate of any race in america.<br>  d) they also live in the most extreme poverty of any race.<br>  e) they are more expected to conform to the average american culture and to drop their rituals and pow wows.<br>  <br>  add:<br>  alli i understand. i get called the n word sometimes and i get called a cracker by others. so doesn't that make me a crigger? <(^_^)><br>  some people can't handle the idea of mixed people.|`|zCjzu5claa	whites, hispanics and middle eastern people are more sexual abusers<br>  hispanic and blacks are more physical and verbal abusers<br>  asian people are more physical|`|e8lAALzgaa	I don't know who gets the most but I would say blacks, middle easterners, and Latinos(specifically Mexicans).

62364eb8ec72973c388641049ba83389aa	All of us indigenous and non-indigenous Australians agree fully with our Labor governments decision, that it's time to close our doors on immigration. <br>  <br>  After seeing the damage our previous Howard government did giving many illegal boat people. Who don't show or have any respect toward indigenous, non-indigenous and the one hundred and fifty six global country foreign born Australians, or show any respect to our culture, customs, laws and lifestyles as migrants into our country.<br>  <br>  By trying to use separatism within Australian society and making demands for separatist communities, schools, laws etc. When our government says no to their demands or wants, they call all Australians racists. <br>  <br>  Most have bitten the hand that has fed and housed them by becoming nothing more than a burden on all Australians and within our society. On our social security, welfare, government housing education, health and legal systems. Also by committing crimes against Australians which has never seen within our country.  <br>  <br>  All Australians have been tolerant to all cultures and people who want to live in harmony within our country. As a nation we don't want to see our country, become like many other countries who have opened their doors and friendship. To separatist minded people who made demands on their host countries. Who have change their laws, traditions and culture just to suit these people. <br>  <br>  Our Prime Minister and both indigenous and non-indigenous Australians believe, by making our laws tougher to enter or by closing our doors on immigration. We all can retain our culture, customs, laws, values, identity, lifestyles and freedoms within our free society. To start building our foundations to become a republic.
nIcPHrXUaa	I'm sorry that happened to you.I made some terrible decisions yrs ago and have been haunted by them-never was in jail,but ruined a lot of relationships,lost my health care license/ruined my career and my self-esteem. I'm no religious fanatic, but broke down one day and phoned a Church. They introduced me to whole new way of thinking. I forgive those who hurt me and am recovering to show these people I CAN get back on my feet. I really do understand.

TC, Donna|`|lBw50ySpaa	Jayann had a great answer. <br>  Writing a letter to the community and paying for it to be published, if you have to, is a great way to start.  Volunteering is a great way to help yourself.  A local man whom I know to be a thief does some charity work.  He is remarkably good at getting recognition for it in the paper.  He is a contractor, and I know it helps his business.  Yesterday my friend witnessed a man try to drag him out of his car at a gas station and beat him up.  The man was yelling about money he owed him.  I'm not surprised.  I know for a fact that he has ripped off dozens of people in the 4 years I've known him, but with the help of his charity work he keeps getting more victims.  <br>  <br>  If you really want to change your ways, and build a lasting reputation, go to church.  When people see you there week after week, they will believe that you are trying seek a better self.  It takes commitment to go to church every Sunday.  Do volunteer work for the church, and give it time.  Don't be discouraged if you don't fit in, try another church.  I have been to biker's church, a church made up of ex-cons/ex-addicts most of whom are living there as a halfway house situation, footwashers with a small congregation that harmonize like angels for 45 minutes of the service, and the kind I grew up in that nearly put you to sleep.

yHD5wVopaa	This question should really be in the Science sections. But, the pictures in the medical books do show this, contrary to what others might say.<br>  These are not technically gill slits, but the precursors to them. In fish, those little arches become gills, in us, they do not. Now, why do the embryos of two different animals use the same exact structures? That is due to about 800 million years of genetic change, which most call evolution.|`|ef4edd8f1c0d16fab298d474bf08b339aa	Haeckel's drawings used artistic licence, his theory was associated with Lamarckism, it was quite clearly wrong in supposing that embryos passed through the adult stages of more primitive life-forms, it ignored organs such as teeth which are "held over" to a late developmental stage, and it was used by Haeckel to promote the supremacy of the white European male.|`|LUGWyWrLaa	Well I would imagine that since the fetus lives in fluid and doesn't developer lungs until later on that there would need to be some means of getting nutrients into the body.  Isn't Gods plan simply amazing.|`|g0lKlQGnaa	Pictures of it on the internet as proof?<br>  <br>  lmfao|`|lLC7Cf2zaa	Because we originated from fish that grew arms and legs and crawled out like alligators and frogs and other amphibians, then turned to primates and eventually humans.  It would be very early in development, however, like within the first month.  <br>  <br>  And we don't live in fluid and therefor have these fish gills to breath with in it - we have umbilical cords for that!  OMG!<br>  <br>  But this is interesting - and I am humbled to accept a partial defeat.  This is not evidence that Darwin was wrong, however.|`|2WnbP80Taa	like it or not mankind still does not know all the answers,  it is only logical to assume that if the baby is in amnoitic fluid that the 'gill slits' are there for a purpose.  The fetus also has a heartbeat if viable at 6 weeks gestation, therefore, veins (of any type) and a brain are also a possibility of need, and the unmbilical cord per ultrasound is not necessarily seen until the 8th week gestation--what does it use prior to this time frame?|`|sWXrnErnaa	The answer is a very simple one, it is that way because it is. <br>  <br>  For a more complex answer - the theory I subscribe to is that each stage of our foetal development represents a stage in our growth or "evolution", from single celled organism to a complex sentient being that humans have become, which is just a microcosm of the universe repeated within ourselves. <br>  <br>  This therefore means the 'gills' (which are not really gills) and veins are a representation of the amphibious stage of our development. <br>  <br>  These stages also show our link to Earth and all the other creatures upon it, our Divine connection, by whatever name one chooses to give - our Creator or Creators show their signature in nature, in science we see that everything is connected, linked together with precision, with logic, with order.|`|3oNcHdgCaa	The "gill slits" in human embryos might use the same basic DNA that creates the gills which fish have, but in humans those structures specialize into the inner ear bones and various sections of the throat. Nature often takes structures that are present in many species and alters them for completely different uses.|`|evStsOQiaa	We developed gills through natural selection so that the fetus can become a sea creature instead of a land animal if it so chooses to before it is born. That is what Charles Darwin taught me.

AA11025703	I am a Christian, one of Jehovah's Witnesses.<br>  <br>  We don't "support" any National groups, or political parties.<br>  <br>  That said, we also don't "stand against" them.<br>  <br>  We ONLY endorse/support Jehovah, through his representative, Jesus as a Governmental power.|`|d05b366085d8773ec7654e3ad2b991cdaa	If you do a little more research you will find that JWs bravely resisted Nazism and paid a very heavy price for their courage.<br>  <br>  Jehovah's Witnesses, in Germany as in the United States, had refused to fight in World War I. This stance contributed to hostility against them in a Germany still wounded by defeat in that war and fervently nationalistic, . attempting to reclaim its previous world stature. <br>  <br>  In Nazi Germany, Jehovah's Witnesses refused to raise their arms in the "Heil, Hitler!" salute; they did not vote in elections; they would not join the army or the German Labor Front '(a Nazi affiliate, which all salaried employees were required to join after 1934).<br>  <br>  Jehovah's Witnesses were denounced for their international and American ties, the apparent revolutionary tone of their millennialism (belief in the peaceful 1,000 year heavenly rule over the earth by Christ, preceded by the battle of Armageddon), and their supposed connections to Judaism, including a reliance on parts of the Bible embodying Jewish scripture (the Christian "Old Testament"). Many of these charges were brought against more than 40 other banned religious groups, but none of these were persecuted to the same degree.  The crucial difference was, the intensity Witnesses demonstrated in refusing to give ultimate loyalty or obedience to the state.<br>  <br>  In April 1933, four months after Hitler became chancellor, Jehovah's Witnesses were banned in Bavaria and by the summer in most of Germany. Twice during 1933, police occupied the Witnesses' offices and their printing site in Magdeburg and confiscated religious literature. Witnesses defied Nazi prohibitions by continuing to meet and distribute their literature often covertly. Copies were made from booklets smuggled in mainly from Switzerland.<br>  <br>  Initially, Jehovah's Witnesses attempted to fend off Nazi attacks by issuing a letter to the government in October 1934, explaining their religious beliefs and political neutrality. This declaration failed to convince the Nazi regime of the group's harmlessness. For defying the ban on their activities, many Witnesses were arrested and sent to prisons and concentration camps. They lost their jobs as civil servants or employees in private industry and their unemployment, social welfare, and pension benefits.<br>  <br>  From 1935 onward, Jehovah's Witnesses faced a Nazi campaign of nearly total persecution. On April 1, 1935, the group was banned nationally by law. The same year, Germany reintroduced compulsory military service. For refusing to be drafted or perform war-related work, and continuing to meet, Jehovah's Witnesses were arrested and incarcerated in prisons and concentration camps. In 1935 some 400 Jehovah's Witnesses were imprisoned at Sachsenhausen concentration camp.<br>  <br>  In 1936 a special unit of the Gestapo (Secret State Police) began compiling a registry of all persons believed to be Jehovah's Witnesses, and agents infiltrated Bible study meetings. By 1939, an estimated 6,000 Witnesses (including those from incorporated Austria and Czechoslovakia) were detained in prisons or camps. Some Witnesses were tortured by police in attempts to make them sign a declaration / renouncing their faith, but few capitulated.<br>  <br>  In response to Nazi efforts to destroy them, the worldwide Jehovah's Witness organization became a center of spiritual resistance against the Nazis. An international convention of Witnesses, held in Lucerne, Switzerland, in September 1936, issued a resolution condemning the entire Nazi regime. In this text and other literature brought into Germany, writers broadly indicted the Third Reich. <br>  <br>  Articles strongly denounced the persecution of German Jews, Nazi "savagery" toward Communists, the remilitarization of Germany, the Nazification of schools and universities, Nazi propaganda, and the regime's assault on mainstream churches.<br>  <br>  The children of Jehovah's Witnesses also suffered. In classrooms, teachers ridiculed children who refused to give the "Heil, Hitler!" salute or sing patriotic songs. Classmates shunned and beat up young Witnesses. Principals expelled them from schools. Families were broken up as authorities took children away from their parents and sent them to reform schools, orphanages, or private homes, to be brought up as Nazis.<br>  <br>  After 1939 most active Jehovah's Witnesses were incarcerated in prisons or concentration camps. Some had fled Germany. In the camps, all prisoners wore markings of various shapes and colors so that guards and camp officers could identify them by category. Witnesses were marked by purple triangular patches. Even in the camps, they continued to meet, pray, and make converts. In Buchenwald concentration camp, they set up an underground printing press and distributed religious tracts.<br>  <br>  Conditions in Nazi camps were generally harsh for all inmates, many of whom died from hunger, disease, exhaustion, exposure to the cold, and brutal treatment. But, as psychoanalyst Bruno Bettelheim and others have|`|TyRfv0eoaa	In 1934, the German government wasn't yet actively engaged in genocide. If it had been, I doubt the yearbook would have made such a statement.<br>  <br>  The Nazi machine didn't move into full swing against the Jews until later in the 1930's. Jews were not arrested en masse and deported in 1934. The government was certainly anti-semitic, but Germany's government always had been. Anti-Jewish violence had been around for centuries.<br>  <br>  The JW's were probably trying to placate the government's concerns about them, to appear as loyal Germans, so they could continue their work. The fact is, politically, JW's don't get involved in politics.|`|3oNcHdgCaa	It was only 1934. A lot of well-meaning people in Germany did support the Nazis in the beginning, before they realized what they were really planning to do.|`|19922ecff123841b68f933197d10192baa	Doubt it.

The danger people see in Mardi Gras it that after dark, people occasionally run around naked, there are gratuitous displays of flesh, and lots and lots of alchohol. Plenty of sex, some occasional drugs, and more fleshy mounds being flashed all over the place, and occasional violence (Drunk men fighting over topless women).

If you can demand reparations from all whites just because of something that happen to your ancestors centuries ago just because we happen to share a race with a handful of individuals who enslaved blacks, I think I can demand reparations from all blacks because of the wrongdoings I have PERSONALLY received by these black men within the past 2 years.

It's used in the case that the person you are talking to is just a friend, not such a great friend that you can just use their name. <br>  A girl can be named kiri, it would be the same as naming your girl mist in English. In Japan everyone would call her mist in Japanese.<br>  Yukiri is a better way of combining mist and snow. <br>  <br>  Interesting Japanese naming fact: Different words in Japanese actually sound the same (so are written the same in Hiragana, the symbols representing syllables like ku ki ka etc) but use different Kanji (symbols for whole words).

gDr6c4hraa	Praise be to Allaah.<br>  <br>  there r many things that contain alcohol like<br>  <br>  perfumes:<br>  <br>   If the percentage of alcohol is very little, we say that it does not matter, and a person may use them without any concern, such as if the alcohol content is 5% or less. This does not matter.<br>  <br>  If the percentage of alcohol is very high, so that you can detect it, then it is better not to use it except where it is necessary, such as for sterilizing wounds and the like.<br>  <br>  In cases where it is not necessary, it is better not to use it, but we do not say that it is haram. The most we can say is that this high alcohol content is an intoxicant, and no doubt consuming intoxicants is haram according to the texts of Islam and the consensus of the scholars, but is using it in ways other than drinking it permissible? This is open to speculation, but to be on the safe side we should not use it. If you say that it is open to speculation because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “O you who believe! Intoxicants, gambling, al-ansaab [animals that are sacrificed on stone altars for idols], and al-azlaam [arrows for seeking luck or decision], are an abomination of Shaytaan’s handiwork. So avoid (strictly all) that (abomination) in order that you may be successful. Shaytaan wants only to excite enmity and hatred between you with intoxicants and gambling, and hinder you from the remembrance of Allaah and from al-salaah (the prayer). So will you not then abstain?” [al-Ma’idah 5:90-91], then we look at the general meaning of the phrase So avoid (strictly all) that (abomination), and say that alcohol should be avoided in all cases, whether it is drunk or applied to the skin, or used in some other way. If we look at the reason why, Allaah says, “Shaytaan wants only to excite enmity and hatred between you with intoxicants and gambling, and hinder you from the remembrance of Allaah and from al-salaah (the prayer). So will you not then abstain?” We may understand this to mean that only drinking it is forbidden, because applying it to the skin does not lead to that (enmity and hatred, etc.). So, in conclusion, we say that if the percentange of alcohol in this perfume is low, there is no need to worry about using it, but if it is high, then it is better to avoid it unless it is for a need, such as sterilizing wounds and the like.<br>  <br>  <br>  vinegar containing alcohol:<br>  <br>  Secondly, it was reported that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whatever intoxicates in large quantities, a small amount of it is haraam.” (Narrated by Ahmad in al-Musnad, 2/91, 167, 179; 3/343). If the vinegar would cause intoxication in large amounts, then a little of it is haraam, and it comes under the same ruling as wine. If a large amount of it does not cause intoxication, then there is no reason not to sell it, buy it or drink it. <br>  <br>  <br>  cosmetics:<br>  <br>  It is safer not to use beauty products that contain alcohol, because of the difference of opinion as to whether intoxicating substances are naajis (impure) or not. If one is forced to use them and the amount of alcohol contained is very small, then it is OK, in sha Allaah.<br>  <br>  <br>  medicines:<br>  <br>  If the medicine containing alcohol is essentially an intoxicant, such that drinking a large amount of it would make one drunk, then it is haraam to take it or to give it, because the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: "Whatever makes one drunk in large amounts, a little of it is haraam" (Reported by the four muhadditheen and others; see also Saheeh al-Jaami’, no. 5530). If it is not an intoxicant, then it is permitted to give it and to apply it to the skin, etc.<br>  <br>  Using alcohol in ways other than drinking it may be permitted if small amounts are used, such as mixing it with perfumes that are used on clothes or the body, because it keeps them from spoiling, and because it keeps the clothes clean. This is OK, but drinking it is not permissible under any circumstances. <br>  <br>  dissolves kidney stones:<br>  <a href="http://www.islam-qa.com/en/ref/8795/alcohol" rel="nofollow">http://www.islam-qa.com/en/ref/8795/alco...</a><br>  <br>  And Allaah knows best.|`|q9C46Wuqaa	Liquor (khamr) is defined in Islamic Law as any intoxicating drink that could affect the person’s mental coherence. It is forbidden by consensus of the Muslims.<br>  <br>  The evidence for its prohibition from the Qur’an is Allah’s saying: “O ye who believe! Intoxicants and gambling, sacrificing to stones, and (divination by) arrows, are an abomination of Satan’s handiwork: eschew such (abomination) that you may prosper.” [S?rah al-Ma’idah: 91-92].<br>  <br>  There are many authentic had?th from the Prophet (peace be upon him) in this regard. He said: “Every intoxicant is khamr and every form of khamr is unlawful”.<br>  <br>  If a drink intoxicates if consumed in large quantities, then it is unlawful for a person to drink any amount of it, even if he does not drink enough to feel the effects of intoxication. Our Prophet (peace be upon him) said: “Every intoxicant is forbidden, and whatever intoxicates in large quantities, then a handful of it is unlawful.” [Musnad Ahmad (23843), Sunan Ab? Daw?d (3202) and Sunan al-Tirmidh? (1789)]<br>  <br>  The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: “In the way of wine, Allah has cursed it, the one who drinks it, the one who pours it for others to drink, the one who sells it, the one who buys it, the one who presses it, the one for whom it is pressed, the one who carries it, and the one for whom it is carried.”<br>  <br>  Liquor is known to be the master of every mischief. Its affliction is physical, moral and psychological. There is a prescribed punishment in the Islamic law for drinking. The punishment is a flogging of 80 lashes with a whip.|`|WyjRm10jaa	medic swap..|`|AA10824205	Alcohol and Liver Disease<br>  Moderate alcohol consumption has no positive effect on health - contrary to a number of studies - while heavy drinking doubles men's chances of dying from a stroke, research has found. <br>  The large-scale study took place over 21 years, and while it confirmed that binge drinking is extremely bad for health, it contradicted studies showing reduced levels of heart disease among people who regularly drink a little.<br>  <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/377381.stm" rel="nofollow">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/377381...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Drinking too much alcohol can lead to three types of liver conditions - fatty liver, hepatitis, and cirrhosis.

I'll copy and past it, and maybe you'll see from another point of view. <br>  <br>  Significance<br>  <br>  <br>  As I walk out into the bitter cold night, <br>  Calgary, Canada, <br>  January; the nights are long and the days are short. <br>  It is a simple walk to the store to grab some milk. <br>  Just another mundane task, <br>  An order to compliment the P & J of what will be dinner. <br>  <br>  I start my walk down the broken alley of ice covered hills, <br>  The thoughts of my life seem to take me over. <br>  The cold <br>   Soon to be frost bitten ears mean nothing over my thoughts. <br>  <br>  I categorize what I have in my life; <br>  <br>  What have I really done?<br>  What have I accomplished?<br>  What do I have? <br>  What do I want to have?<br>  How do people refer to me?<br>  How will people remember me? <br>  <br>  A car turns down the alley towards me. <br>  The speed is excessive, <br>   I know he sees me. <br>  I step to the side, <br>  He passes in his Mercedes S-Class without a worry of me. <br>  <br>  Who does he think he is!?<br>  <br>  I picture him in a big house, <br>  Probably an executive in some big company, <br>  Six figure salary, <br>  Living his perfect life. <br>  <br>  Who does he think I am? <br>  <br>  Am I of no significance to him?<br>  <br>  I wonder of what I am, <br>  What do I have? <br>  What will I leave behind? <br>  My legacy. <br>  <br>  What I am, <br>  What I have, <br>  What I leave behind<br>  It’s not enough. <br>  <br>  I am no one. <br>  I have nothing. <br>  No big house, <br>  No savings, <br>  No respected job, <br>  So what do I have to leave anyone? <br>  <br>  I start to think that maybe the driver has a reason not to respect my life, <br>  My safety. <br>  <br>  Though the thoughts quickly change like a spark that starts a fire. <br>  <br>  Who is he?<br>  What does he have?<br>  What will he leave behind?<br>  <br>  Is he an executive? <br>  Respected or feared?<br>  So he has a hundred thousand dollar car, <br>  Maybe a mansion to boot. <br>  <br>  He is alone in his car. <br>  Maybe he is also alone in his life. <br>  A pricey car with no one to share it with. <br>  A mansion with empty rooms. <br>  When one day his time passes, <br>  What will he leave behind? <br>  <br>  I reflect on what I do know about myself, <br>  My life, <br>  As simple as it may be. <br>  <br>  I have two sons who are the most handsome in this world. <br>  I have a blessed ex-wife who holds a masters degree in law, <br>  Yet still she respects and holds love in her heart for me. <br>  I have my current wife, who supports me, <br>  Through all my successes and failings. <br>  <br>  I have love,<br>  Respect, <br>  From both families of my children. <br>  I have knowledge that I have passed onto others. <br>  I have touched lives,<br>  Helped many throughout the years. <br>  I have stood up for what I believed in, <br>  Stood up and fought for social change. <br>  I have always fought for “the little guy”. <br>  <br>  But am I the little guy?<br>  <br>  Is “he” better than me?<br>  <br>  I realized that he does not know me, <br>  He does not know my life, <br>  Does not know my accomplishments, <br>  Does not know my sons, <br>  Does not know my hopes<br>  My dreams, <br>  Not just for me but for my sons<br>  <br>  If I were to pass on, <br>  It would mean nothing to him. <br>  <br>  I realized that I do not know him, <br>  His life, <br>  His accomplishments, <br>  Nor his family if any, <br>  His hopes<br>  His dreams, <br>  <br>  If he were to pass on, <br>  It would mean nothing to me.

2d8a30b9f6641151f5c5048773c2626caa	Hi Brittany,<br>  <br>  The answer to your question is that is is different for every volunteer, like you said.  In my group of volunteers, some people work for cities, some for schools, some for orphanages, and some for NGOs.  Most of us do some of the same things, but this is also dependent on where you are sent in the world.  I am serving in Eastern Europe right now, and a lot of our focus is on business and tourism development and teaching English.  We all work with youth to a certain degree, we all assist in translating documents or grant applications, and we all spend a lot of time teaching English to both kids and adults.  In Africa, a lot of volunteers work in education or in the health field (vaccines, STDs, basic health information).  In South America, a lot of volunteers work in agriculture and infrastructure.  The South Pacific is education for the most part, and China is mainly teaching English.  Do a search for blogs for Peace Corps volunteers--there are a lot out there.  You will be able to see pictures, read stories, and get a better feel for what a volunteer does on a day-to-day basis.  Good luck!|`|5d8a3c03e0eaed818f8bcdc8c279bf5faa	Would you even want to do that while obama is in house?

KBBonf97aa	If you use an eye liner pencil with a very sharp tip, you can draw a thin line just below the eyelashes that will look subtle, but stay in place better than eye liner applied above the lashes.  I usually do both, since I have the same problem with "vanishing" eye liner.  The kohl pencils are great for that.

MhfneF0xaa	Awww, man I've been there! Kids can be so cruel, I know.<br>  <br>  Try to pursue you friendships on an individual level. Kids can be so much more cruel in a group. When you get them by themselves, they are almost never as cruel.  Don't take this personally, they are just showing off for the group.<br>  <br>  So try to develop friendships on an individual basis, at least to start off with.<br>  <br>  Try to find at least one friend with whom you can share these feelings. As I say, I have been in the same situation, and I found one friend who was willing to be honest with me, and also listen.<br>  <br>  Foremost, however, be a friend, even to those who aren't friendly to you. This doesn't mean hang with them, or pester them. It means stand up for them when somenone else gives them a hard time.<br>  <br>  You won't have any trouble finding a situation like this, I promise!<br>  <br>  "To have a friend, be a friend!"<br>  <br>  And I wish you the best of luck and happiness!|`|aW5uShwtaa	That age sucks.

It seems like now they think you are a pushover, tell them to shut their mouths and they might respect you more. Be mature about it though. If they make fun of you, you should laugh don't take it personally because that is what eats away at you. Once they realize their cruel jokes don't offend you anymore they will leave you alone. I hope this helps.

What was a good book, has become the "obssession" of lonely, teenage girls everywhere. You've all blown it way out of proportion and subsequentally destroyed its image, passion and power. Sure it was a cliche love story involving surreal creatures and Deep pitted love, the kind of thing most strive for but never see, that does not mean you should cause mass "edward" hysteria, or even provoke the fact that because of Twilight vampires are real. <br>  <br>  Because of this barage of teenage fan-ship no one can inquire about vampires/werewolves anywhere anymore without it being asumed that they are also on the "vampires are real because i watched twilight and want my own personal god of a vampire: Edward" band wagon. <br>  <br>  This book has been made into a sick "twelve year old girl" fad, and its sickening.|`|EJAvOHxGaa	Vampires.

Also animals are stronger and have better senses than people. In theory, vampires r super-human and were wolves r super-animal, so if the animal is stronger 1st then the super animal will be stronger than the super man.<br>    If u classify them as demons, the werewolf is better because it is not under the devils control and has few malevolent intentions outside feasting (wolves feast on live prey).|`|8c4df1df3be917b865cf9c92a0982e79aa	Vampire they are the closest to what a God is.

FmazIF6Maa	I generally don't believe robbing from the rich and giving to the poor is a morally correct thing to do...  however, Robin Hood's case was special.<br>  <br>  The rich that he was robbing from was a single corrupt monarch who had unfairly taken from his people to the point where they were starving and desperately impoverished. <br>  <br>  That's what makes Robin a hero; not that he took it upon himself to redistribute the wealth, but that he was stealing back what had been unrightfully taken and giving it back to those in desperate need that it was taken from.|`|EJAvOHxGaa	I'd say he did the wrong things for the right reasons.|`|uAKBGfAlaa	That's a very good question. <br>  <br>  I think that Robin Hood was both a hero and an outlaw.  The reason I say this is because he did steal from the rich.  Stealing obviously would put you in the Outlaw catagory.  But at the same time, he didn't steal it for his own personal gain, but for those in need.  For those that he gave this money to, he's their hero.|`|MYO2k9EUaa	He does steal from the rich and give to the poor...<br>  <br>  OUTLAW.

In many way he is a hero to the common people yet a criminal to the nobles at the same time and he did all of it just for revenge as they killed his father, destroyed his castle, stole his land, and took away his nobility.  I have to say he not a hero, but not really a criminal.|`|8c4df1df3be917b865cf9c92a0982e79aa	By Tradition Hero by History outlaw. What I mean our mythical Robin hood was everything women wanted and men wanted to be. He was Roger Godberd he was Born in the area of Leicester. <br>  <br>  He served under Simon de Montfort, the 6th Earl of Leicester, as well as two other barons. When all three were killed in a clash with the monarchy, Roger assumed the leadership. The leadership which the Monarchy according to law were to take control of. He opposed the law which made him an out law by right.<br>  <br>  This put him at odds with the royals so, according to history, in October 1267, he settled in Sherwood forest. He lived there for four years defying the authorities stealing from rich and poor not like the mythical Robin. He could call upon 100 men but was eventually caught in 1272. <br>  <br>  Roger / Robin wasn't around during the time of Richard the Lionheart. The monarchs were Henry III and his son Edward I.<br>  <br>  Fans of the Robin Hood legend might be shocked to hear but, it was the Sheriff of Nottingham who caused Roger Godberd's downfall. Roger was first captured in the grounds of Rufford Abbey. He was taken to Nottingham castle but managed to escape. That prompted drastic action. The sheriff was given money to raise the finest army in the land to finally defeat the outlaws<br>  <br>  Roger was eventually captured and sent to jail. He was kept in three different prisons  over three years while awaiting trial. That took place at the Tower of London where he was pardoned.<br>  <br>  He returned to his farm and lived there until his death, never heading down the outlaw road again.<br>  <br>  <br>  Now Our Myth of Robin is he was the son of a Lord. He went to The Crusades and came back to find things had changed. So he went against the law for the good of all people and thus became a hero!!!|`|e6Kyqb22aa	he was an outlaw and a criminal in a good way. He stole from the rich to give to the poor

10bb153a928c9693ebec1b2660853526aa	1. Find the IP address of your internet router box (probably came with the CDs or in the pamphlet it came with); the IP address will be a number with dots, like 128.128.99.188 or something like that. Put that into your internet bar (just like you would www.google.com). That will take you to the router box's configuration, where you can see what kind of password protection you have on your wireless (WEP or WPA, 64-bit or 128-bit). You can double-check what kind of key you have, and if that complies with the rules on the Nintendo website.<br>  <br>  2. If everything checks out as being the right length and kind of protection (from the step before), then your computer's hardware address might be wrong. This is call the MAC address, kind of like your computer's personal DNA tag. Still in that same site as the step before, find where you can see what your MAC address is (it should be something with colons, like 00:4F:39:CD:01 or something like that). If the MAC address is disabled, then no worries. If it's enabled, then in your Wii's Internet settings, you must add this MAC address to the "allowed" list, to make sure that the Wii (for some reason) doesn't block your internet.<br>  <br>  3. Try setting your router box's "channel" to either 1 or 11. It didn't mention where to find that, but try going through all the Wii's settings.<br>  <br>  4. See that your Wii's router box is working okay. They were a bit vague on what specifically to check.<br>  <br>  5. In the first site I mentioned, check to see your router box is set to broadcast modes called "mixed" or "b/g." If it's "g only," it could potentially block things.<br>  <br>  6. Try this: <a href="http://www.nintendo.com/consumer/systems/wii/en_na/connectingOnline.jsp?entryId=manualSetup" rel="nofollow">http://www.nintendo.com/consumer/systems...</a><br>  <br>  7. If all else fails, unplug everything, wait 30 seconds, and plug everything back in. This resets some settings that could be causing the problem.<br>  <br>  If all seven of those steps fail, they recommend going here: <a href="http://www.nintendo.com/consumer/systems/wii/en_na/online.jsp" rel="nofollow">http://www.nintendo.com/consumer/systems...</a>|`|OfHoaWf7aa	Into which language?

I wouldn't say it's a straight out rejection, but I would say give her some time and don't rush things. Best of luck...|`|TJ05HUGJaa	she probably does but just having a rough time be patient|`|OWqz9EuFaa	maybe she just doesn't want to marry you....|`|JbTPuZtlaa	maybe you caught her off gaurd. dont worry about it im sure if you love her and she truely loves you, it'll work. however, if she skips town, thats a bad sign -.-|`|yQYpaFiFaa	sort of. it is usually how people stall.

UinOWcMUaa	Definetly was created :) We are too far intellegent to believe in Evolution, and know that even our atmospheric elements dictate a(n) intellegent designer know as God..|`|nhGIZE71aa	Purpose is not a fundamental principle.  Just like an earth without computers gave way to an earth with computers, a universe without purpose gave rise to a people having the concept of purpose.<br>  <br>  Purpose is only a human-made concept.  There is no fundamental significance to it.  The true universe lies beyond all human conceptions.|`|gU4VdD6Oaa	I do think we evolved to create purpose. It's one of the things that makes us human. <br>  <br>  The cool thing about the theory of evolution is it allows you to explore a question like this. To put the question in evolutionary terms, we'd have to ask, "what advantage is it to humans to have the idea that what we does should have a purpose."   I think that "purpose" is a concept that drives us to do very complex things which don't seem to have immediate utility. I don't know if this is the answer, but it is an hypothesis which could be explored in greater depth. <br>  <br>  And that is what makes the theory of evolution by natural selection a very useful theory.|`|AA10556726	It really is not a mystery.  We are symbol processors, or simply we can use symbols (words, pictures, digits, characters, etc) as meaning various (or a wide range of) concept.  The side effect of this is that we can think that anything, like life, has a meaning or purpose.|`|LGBNKuxRaa	initially I suspect people were mainly obsessed with things like survival and reproduction. those do tend to focus the mind like nothing else, even now. purposes other than that were an afterthought.|`|03c287c9e9e2feef723946b70ad122f4aa	I blame PBS. 2|`|v7Wflu78aa	The quest for purpose, the quest for finding the grand "cause and effect" in life, is built (evolved) into us.<br>  <br>  Humans survive because they can make cause-effect connections.  Plant a seed - that's where a plant grows.  Pick up a tool over there, and it has an effect (a purpose) over there - where you can spear a fish with it.<br>  <br>  But, we are so good at finding purpose, that we seek it and find it even where it doesn't exist.<br>  <br>  We have evolved to ask, "What is the purpose of life," when, in fact, there is no purpose.<br>  <br>  "The purpose is to..... " when there is actually no purpose.<br>  <br>  It takes more thinking to distinguish between, on one hand, coincidences and  correlations, and, on the other, cause-and-effect relationships.<br>  <br>  However, if you are not willing or able to do that analysis, and accept that some things just are because they are - until we find a cause some day - then you can pretend that a sky fairy, or tinkerbell, or Zeus, or JeZeus, or God created a grand purpose.  It feels good, but it's not accurate.|`|QFLtTeKEaa	Really great question if your assumptions are correct.  I don't know the truth, but I believe that we understand very little.  Concepts and sensations are unique to the human experience; rocks don't "see" and salamanders aren't likely concerned about "justice."  <br>  <br>  So, the question of purpose is a human question rather than a universal question.  Purpose is the reason for which something is done.  Human beings are a thriving species because they have reason.  We reason small problems such as how to get what we want to eat.  We reason larger problems, for example, how to trade goods between to cities.  We ponder how to manage our emotional ties with others.  And then, we ponder the functioning of our own mind.<br>  <br>  Whether looking outward toward the ends of the universe and space or inward into why am I here, we are applying the same trait.  <br>  <br>  This ability to identify and solve problems may be a fluke, a beneficial attribute that easily expanded past its original purpose, or the universe may have purpose, or maybe only very few of us are actually obsessed with purpose.  I don't know, but thinking about it gives me something to do when I'm bored.|`|K8QTdUnfaa	Really no evolutionary advantage to people getting depressed and offing themselves.  Much better to form a group dynamic and believe that death can't touch them.<br>  <br>  Okay that's making a few assumptions but remember that ancient humans did not have access to the knowledge we have today.|`|Fpi8im9taa	Nobody is *given* a purpose. Each person finds their own, unique thing to accomplish in life.<br>  <br>  Maybe us humans just want to be able to influence, for better or for worse, the lives of other people for the sake of society.|`|AA11536715	Ego+curiosity=made up answers|`|ypVQlOJvaa	I blame PBS.<br>  <br>  .|`|gItLVFY2aa	You get my vote for question of the week.|`|L4eoLmvJaa	just lucky, I guess

pT8mVjUaaa	Believing or disbelieving in ghosts is a personal thing.  Some can believe and it doesn't bother them at all.  Some are terrified by it.  Most are in denial about it because, while their subconscious knows they exist, it is too frightening to face for them, so they claim to be skeptics and deny the existence of ghosts no matter what proof they see, or more importantly, hear (as in EVP).  It is all in what you choose to believe.  Me, I am not afraid of anything, so I believe in ghosts.  I took the time to look for myself to see if I could find proof that they exist.  I found evidence that I personally can accept that makes me believe they are out there.|`|sS1jlF2naa	Yea, my house has a ghost :P|`|GJfBU0bAaa	yep. boo|`|NxxnyruVaa	Yes i do, when i was a kid we had this dog for like 8 years and everyonce in a while you'll see himit used to happen alot after he died butnow not so much...and plus my mom says she saw her dead grandfather after he died so it depends on personial exeriance i guess|`|R3k8MqjVaa	Since ghost is singular and not plural, which particular ghost are you refering to?

iwNYcerfaa	Most men have fantasies about being with two women at the same time.. I have been with two women at the same time ( I don't anymore because I'm very commited in my relationship) but when I did. It was a huge turn on because all the attention is given to you by both women. So, maybe it's a fantasy for most men.|`|vDG0iA8laa	As a long time married c/d - t/v with much adoration for females and emulate them as much as I can to the nines, Ito me the majority of women are indeed a work of art, and two see TWO of them at the same time and each of them appreciation each other at thew same time, is as best an explanation as  I can give<br>  Plus they know what THEY like, and when it's returned in a similar manner, it becomes very pleasurable to not only the two ladies, but any or all viewers.<br>  Rachelle In High Heels|`|DIj072Sqaa	I think it's the same mentality of straight guys who presume they can 'convert' lesbians.

I for one worship every sunday with just my daughter and I because there are too many corrupt pastors that deceive the people that attend their church. And most church's are more like social gatherings than actual worship sessions. There are also a lot of great pastors and church's, but most of the time it is hard to tell until it is too late. You might want to look into the many books of the bible yourself, without others telling you how to interpret it. All religions can take a bad hold on someone's mind if taught by the wrong people. So teach yourself, and ask questions of people you trust.|`|AA11726497	Yes, religion is man trying to make himself acceptable in the sight of God.  True Christianity is God reaching out to man and inviting man into a personal relationship with Him through His Son Jesus Christ.<br>  How?<br>  100% of us will eventually die, you can know with 100% surety where you will go.  1Jn 5:12  He that hath the Son hath life: and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life.<br>  <br>  Accepting Jesus Christ as your personal Savior is the most important <br>  decision you will ever make.  Jesus Christ will change your life in ways you <br>  could never have imagined.  He is the source of life and in Him is life.<br>  <br>  1.  Realize that God loves you.  John 3:16 Says, "For God so loved the         <br>  world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him <br>  shall not perish, but hath everlasting life."<br>  <br>  God loves you and He has demonstrated that love through the person and work of His Son Jesus.  <br>  God created you and God wants to have a meaningful relationship with you .  <br>  He has a plan and purpose for your life.  He wants you to have real lasting <br>  hope, peace and joy.  Things that the world cannot give you.  <br>  <br>  2.  Recognize that sin has separated us from God.<br>  Romans 3:23 tells us, "ALL have sinned and come short of the glory of God.<br>  The Bible tells us that we have all chosen to go our own way, to do our own <br>  thing, instead of following God, His commands, and His perfect will for our <br>  lives.  When we do this we sin, and sin carries a high price tag.<br>  <br>  Romans 6:23 says, "The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal <br>  life in Jesus Christ our Lord.<br>  <br>  We deserve death and hell because of our sin, but God does not want to give <br>  us what we deserve, He wants to give us what we do not deserve, namely <br>  forgiveness of sin, peace with God, hope, inner peace, joy, eternal life, and a <br>  home in heaven.<br>  <br>  Jesus provides the only way to have all of these.  Do you want forgiveness of <br>  your sin and peace with God?  Yes or no?<br>  <br>  3.  Respond to God's only provision for sin.<br>  Jesus said, "I am the way, the truth and the life, NO ONE comes to the Father <br>  but through me.  John 14:6<br>  <br>  Acts 4:12 Neither is there salvation in any other, for there is none other name <br>  under heaven, given among men, where by we must be saved.<br>  <br>  We cannot get into heaven or have peace with God through our own efforts.  <br>  The only way to God is through the Son, Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  Ephesians 2:8-9 tells us, "For by grace are you saved through faith, and that <br>  not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: NOT OF WORKS, lest any man should <br>  boast."<br>  <br>  Do you want to know Jesus and experience true meaningful life?<br>  <br>  If yes, tell Him you are sorry for your sin, that you believe that He died <br>  for you, and rose again, and ask Him to come into your heart and be <br>  your Lord and Savior, and you have God's word that you will be <br>  saved.<br>  <br>  "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."  Romans <br>  10:13.|`|h07uBpjNaa	I think your caution is well founded. There are many corruptions of the truth out there.

Dont get religion confused with Christ and relationship with God.  The Pharisees who rejected Jesus were "religious".  They were so thick in there religion they didnt even recognize the messiah there scriptures and prophets foretold.  A lot of "religious" Christians do the same thing.  They are so caught up in religion they miss the real thing! Jesus Christ's teachings are not religous.  Having a relationship with him is not religious.  Religion is mans doctrine and his  ways of handling the organization and teaching of its followers.  Its not bad in and of itself.  But because man is corruptible so is his religion.  God is incorruptible...|`|udUzdU7Raa	It certainly is possible. You may not have found a religion yet that suits all your beliefs, or maybe there isn't one for you.

Religion is the outward expression of what you feel inwardly.|`|8pQrIL90aa	No. There is a portion of religion in the bible that must be obyed, because it shows faith in God. Cannot believe in a GOD unless you also abide by the rules of that God.|`|ZoPln7vaaa	yes! I do, and I don't Christianity as a religion, its a way to GOD|`|03c287c9e9e2feef723946b70ad122f4aa	Yes<br>  <br>  Religion divides...reality unites. Jesus Christ is Real.|`|UnLkBsViaa	I think a lot of people believe in god but not in religion. Personally I don't believe in god, at least not a personified god like the god of the bible or the ancient gods of what is now called mythology. I know that there is an invisible energy that gives life - that is a scientific fact - what we don't know is the source of that energy. I don't think it's a god, but I keep searching for the answers.|`|k5X78IM3aa	Yes, definitely.  I believe in God...I KNOW there is a God...the same one for all religions...Supreme Being...Creator...Great Spirit. And no, you don't have to believe in religion to believe in God.  My daughter also knows God is, but she avoids religion like the plague.  She will go by a Catholic church once in a while to talk to Mother Mary...but she goes when no one else is there.  She is not Catholic & she does not go to mass.  Now having said that, let me tell you something that happened to me.<br>  <br>  When I was a little girl, lightening struck the house.  In a panic, I thought I was going to die so I prayed to God that He would not let me die...I didn't want to die. A "white light" appeared to me & said, "You're going to be alright, Nala"...and I was.  I calmly walked to the kitchen door & saw hugh balls of fire shooting out from behind the stove.  <br>  About 15 years later the white light appeared again when  I had been in excruciating pain.  It did not speak that time but I had an overwhelming sense of peace & calm.<br>  <br>  You are right to believe in a Higher Power.  There is definitely one.  And I know many people who believe in this Power without being religious.  I, on the other hand, enjoy the fellowship of being with other people who believe & I enjoy some church activities, but I still have trouble with that word religious.  Some people have given it a bad connotation.  (smile)|`|yHD5wVopaa	Yes it is possible, you yourself have proven it. Many people find the world's religions rather unsavory, and don't want to be affiliated with them. You're free to do so and still believe in God.|`|eO2rnf7yaa	It is possible to genuinely believe in God and not practice any organized religion.  Lots of people do it.  I am Roman Catholic.  I believe God exists,  and I seek to learn more about Him from the 2000 year-old Catholic Church.   You and I are not the only two people to whom God has made Himself known.   I believe he came to Earth in the person of His son, Jesus Christ,  and that Jesus Christ has made it possible to spend eternity in the presence of God.   If you want to learn more about why over a billion people practice the same religion I do,  try reading The New American Bible and the Catechism of The Catholic Church.  The Catechism is available from Amazon.com for less than twenty U.S. dollars.  <br>  <br>  I don't think you should be afraid of the Catholic Church "having a hold on your mind" as you indicate you fear from some religions.   We Catholics openly encourage education and critical thinking.   This is evident by the thousands of schools, colleges and universities the Catholic Church has opened and continues to sponsor around the world.<br>  <br>  You can definitely become Catholic and keep your mind.  In fact,  most people who join the Church as adults do so after a great deal of careful and critical use of their minds.   I hope you do not settle for merely believing God exists.   He has made available to us the opportunity to learn a great deal about Him, and to grow more intimate in our relationship with Him.   The Catholic Church provides you with this opportunity.   <br>  <br>  In any case,  may Peace be with you.|`|AA11124121	Being a Christian, or Spiritual, without being a part of Christendom.<br>  <br>  That's what you said, basically.

a0565811de871e19a5c2a7b27aeadf50aa	Generally a white or Caucasian person. i.e., "WASP", not necessarily a foreigner.  We would not refer to a native of Japan, Africa , or Tahiti as a "haole".<br>  <br>  The origin of the word "haole" is quite interesting.  When ancient Hawaiians first encountered Caucasians, it was their impression the Caucasians looked almost corpse-like because of their pale skin.  "Ha" = breath, "ole" (shortened for "a'ole" = none, without).  "haole" = without breath.|`|gZ0NPuleaa	White person|`|yEsw7UkWaa	It means foreigner or foreign and can refer to people, plants or animals.<br>  <br>  Mostly applied today to those that are of a Caucasian background, or act like they are.|`|daQcjqyXaa	it means white person.<br>  'hapa' means someone who has a Hawaiian parent and a white parent.  thats me :)

One of the Pharoas bragged about 'pillaging' the House of David. That's a fact. My head hurts. I don't have much room for facts so I sort of make them up as I go along. The priests lauged when he said he wanted to build a House of God to honor His Name but the priests knew what them descendants of Eve would look like. Does that make any sense? The priests aided Jesus just praise Your Name in building His tent. Which tent He pressed hard against His Father's house. He was told to by the Holy Ghost which just spake saying, "Greetings unto the Household of Jesus". His babies are just waiting for Him to come home and just raise God's hand up for Him so He could wipe those ashes off of them the 'widas' had rubbed on HIm with their candles I think.|`|vOuSZnKxaa	To a religious person faith = fact, so most already believe they are teaching their children truth.|`|9onFys4baa	They should be given a bone.... and if they are really good, an ice pack to nurse their bruised face.|`|6ec55368aa773b05b3b9440af5f7fc50aa	God loves you.An there is nothing you can do to change his mind.|`|zM327P5Taa	Yes, for every truth they tell, they'll get one less slap!|`|FjiRPKp2aa	To us those are the facts.We will be rewarded thank you very much.
d0WaYTeGaa	Even with all of the experience I've had with angry lesbians (trust me, being gay I attract a lot of drama, lmao) I would simply re-assure her and let her know that what you feel for her, even if it's not love yet, is real, and you wouldn't mess it up over that crazy_____ (u can fill in the blank).|`|nQpGcBGdaa	tell your girl what the deal is, and then go snatch the hoe up|`|ZQYFd8icaa	Restraining order!!!!|`|R1FjOFkUaa	I think you should tell your current girlfriend the truth. Maybe you should also tell your ex to stop messing around or else you'll get a retraining order. If she doesn't stop, then I would get one. I don't know if this is a little weird, but maybe if you talk on the phone with your ex and tell her to stop messing around, you could have your girlfriend on the other line because I bet your ex would say some crazy stuff =] . It would help reassure your girlfriend that you don't have any kind of relationship with your ex. Good Luck.|`|s2wcWcu1aa	thats out of hand by your ex. if youve explained to her that its over and attempts to sabotage your current relationship aren't going to change that, then there's not a lot else you can do about her. maybe get a new number, or if it gets REALLY extreme then maybe a restraining order would be necessary :p<br>  <br>  and just let your current gf know the situation, assure her she's the only girl for you and basically be all cheesy n stuff :p

Are you going to follow through on what you think you want out of life..? <br>  I here with a fully supportive, understanding, and knowledgeable wife in a way have the best of both worlds as I can dress as often or as little as I want and have the occasion (s) for.

eYwzlsk4aa	Envious and jealous of the beauty of a mortal woman named Psyche, Aphrodite, (Venus) asks her son Cupid (known to the Greeks as Eros) to use his golden arrows to cause Psyche to fall in love with the vilest creature on earth. Cupid agrees, but then falls in love with Psyche on his own. When he leans over from a distance to kiss her, he causes one of his own arrows to fall forward, piercing him.<br>  <br>  When all continue to admire and praise Psyche's beauty, but none desire her as a wife, Psyche's parents consult an oracle, which tells them to leave Psyche on the nearest mountain, for her beauty is so great that she is not meant for man. Terrified, they have no choice but to follow the oracle's instructions. But then Zephyrus, the west wind, carries Psyche away to a fair valley and a magnificent palace where she is attended by invisible servants until night falls and in the darkness of night the promised bridegroom arrives and the marriage is consummated. Cupid visits her every night to have sex with her, but demands that she never light any lamps, since he does not want her to know who he is.<br>  <br>  Cupid allows Zephyrus to take Psyche back to her sisters and bring all three down to the palace during the day, but warning that Psyche should not listen to any argument that she should try to discover his true form. The two jealous sisters tell Psyche, then pregnant with Cupid's child, that rumor is that she had married a great and terrible serpent who would devour her and her unborn child when the time came for it to be fed. They urge Psyche to conceal a knife and oil lamp in the bedchamber, to wait till her husband was asleep, and then to light the lamp and slay him at once if it is as they said. Psyche sadly follows their advice. In the light of the lamp Psyche recognizes the fair form on the bed as the god, Cupid himself. However, she accidentally pricks herself with an arrow, and is consumed with desire for her husband. She begins to kiss him, but as she does, a drop of oil falls from her lamp onto Cupid's chest and wakes him. He flies away, and she falls from the window to the ground, sick at heart.<br>  <br>  Psyche then finds herself in the city where one of her jealous elder sisters lives. She tells her what had happened, then tricks her sister into believing that Cupid has chosen her as a wife instead. She later meets her other sister and deceives her likewise. Each returns to the top of the peak and jumped down eagerly, but Zephyrus does not bear them and they fall to their deaths at the base of the mountain.<br>  <br>  Psyche searches far and wide for her lover, finally stumbling into a temple where everything is in slovenly disarray. As Psyche is sorting and clearing, Ceres (Demeter) appears, but refuses any help but advice, saying Psyche must call directly on Venus, the jealous shrew that caused all the problems in the first place. Psyche next calls on Juno (Hera) in her temple, but Juno, superior as always, says the same. So Psyche finds a temple to Venus and enters it. Venus orders Psyche to separate all the grains in a large basket of mixed kinds before nightfall. An ant takes pity on Psyche and with its ant companions separates the grains for her.<br>  <br>  Venus is outraged at her success and tells her to go to a field where golden sheep graze and get some golden wool. A river-god tells Psyche that the sheep are vicious and strong and will kill her, but if she waits until noontime, the sheep will go to the shade on the other side of the field and sleep; she can pick the wool that sticks to the branches and bark of the trees. Venus next asks for water flowing from a cleft that is impossible for a mortal to attain and is also guarded by great serpents. This time an eagle performs the task for Psyche. Venus, outraged at Psyche's survival, claims that the stress of caring for her son, made depressed and ill as a result of Psyche's lack of faith, has caused her to lose some of her beauty. Psyche is to go to the Underworld and ask the queen of the Underworld to place a bit of her beauty in a box that Venus gave to Psyche. Psyche decides that the quickest way to the Underworld is to throw herself off some high place and die and so she climbs to the top of a tower. But the tower itself speaks to her and tells her the route that will allow her to enter the Underworld alive and return again, as well as telling her how to get past Cerberus by giving it a small cake, how to avoid other dangers on the way there and back, and most importantly to eat no food whatsoever in the underworld, as that would trap her there forever. Psyche follows the orders explicitly and eats nothing while beneath the Earth.<br>  <br>  However when Psyche has left the Underworld, she decides to open the box and take a little bit of the beauty for herself. Inside, she can see no beauty; instead an infernal sleep arises from the box and overcomes her. Cupid (Eros), who had forgiven Psyche, flies to her, wipes the sleep from her face, puts it back in the box, and sends he
nOeUT67Laa	Judging from your description of your question, you're not asking if the world will end...you're merely asking if human societal structure as we know it will end.<br>  <br>  If this is your question, I don't think it's an easy one to answer.  Things may certainly CHANGE, but that doesn't mean for the better or worse.  I think that eventually, we have a period of time in the future where things seems pretty damn good.  Then, at some other point in the future (including right now), things WON'T be that great.  Normal fluctuations is all I think we'll see.  A car getting broken into (even at higher rates than "normal") is not a signal for the end of the world.  And even if it was the end for humans, which it's not, it STILL doesn't mean the end of the world.  There are loads more animals here that might keep going just fine without us...even better.<br>  <br>  If you mean will the Earth someday end, the answer is yes.  Sometime in the next billion years, possibly.  Maybe later.<br>  <br>  P.S. It has NOTHING to do with anything supernatural.|`|VtKNVxVzaa	This recession is nothing compared to what lies in the future.<br>  <br>  THIS IS WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS:<br>  When you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be alarmed.

From Black Codes to KKK having over 3 million members to Plessy V Ferguson to segregation. The struggle of black people was NOT slavery. If anything, slaves have been the STRONGEST of any blacks in America!

It's partly the US's education system for failing to give them an unbiased view of history. The history they teach in school is basically "white people are so bad." I would know I've taken AP US History. The point I'm trying to make here is that slavery has always existed and always will. We ARE animals. And animals do the same thing. Look at the Mongol Empire. Yes, the greatest empire in history was a non-European Empire. Stretching from Korea to India to Ukraine the Mongol Empire is the largest contiguous empire known to man. The Mongols raped, pillaged, and enslaved millions. When they invaded Europe they shipped Europeans back to Central Asia where they were used as slaves.<br>  <br>  Another example is just Europeans vs. Europeans. The Vikings took plenty of Irish as slaves. The English controlled IReland for 800 years, destroyed their culture, and forced them to learn English. <br>  <br>  The Persians, Chinese, Romans, Mongols, Spaniards, Portuguese, Indians, and British have ALL been enslaved AND enslaved others. It's not a one way street. <br>  <br>  AND just to let you know it was the Arabs that turned the Europeans on to the slave trade. The Arabs had been trading Ethiopians, Jews, etc. for years before that. And I'd like to also point out that it was the Africans that sold the Africans to the Europeans... There had been African on African slavery going on for years before the Portuguese arrived and still this exists today in Africa.<br>  <br>  EDIT: To the girl below me: I'm whie, and yes, I know the names of my ancestors that were enslaved. MY great grandfather was taken prisoner by the Brits in Northern Ireland and had his put in an oven.<br>  <br>  Try not to generalize. If I generalized about you you'd call me a racist.|`|M2UWOTAjaa	Jack, I am confused about you. You kept saying There are no races, but you are fixated upon the subject. Let's refer to ethnic gene pools instead.  Yes, every civilization in the world had slaves, as did all the tribal groups - even in Africa slavery was an institution. But only in the Americas was slavery based upon the false construction of race.<br>  You don't need to get defensive. I certainly had nothing to do with slavery. My ancestors came from Ireland after the Great Famine and the first generation couldn't even read English, let alone vote for any policies on a national scale. They were plenty racist all right -  since they were treated like dogs by the British they lashed out at AA so they could feel superior to somebody.<br>  But AA are still victims of slavery on account of the stigma attached to that status. This stigma still haunts them.|`|e9ldIRQmaa	Again, this event was over 100 years ago, the people who suffered and the evil people that made others suffered are all DEAD, none of them are alive, no one owes anyone nothing.

When exactly were your ancestors enslaved? Do you know their names? I can name mine, that's the difference. And I don't think anyone owes me a damn thing, so stop generalizing all of us. You whine when people accuse you of being racist, but look what you write about, something no black person on this board brought up.|`|KXB9DckRaa	When will white people get over slavery and stop bringing it up. You sound angrier than any black person I've ever known.<br>  <br>  <br>  By the way, American slavery was CHATTEL, slavery in history was mostly all debt bondage and forced labor. The people were still people. America was different in the slaves had no rights at all, sweetie. I know the truth maigh make you feel bad, but GET OVER IT and please, for the love of God, read a book or two.|`|8ZVrAl2Zaa	You know what else I hate?<br>  When black people call white people racial derogatory terms, and they think it's okay.<br>  But if anyone else calls them a racial derogatory term, OH NO IT'S A HUGE CRIME!<br>  Seriously.|`|dyFRchmtaa	Yea the polish and the jews ect ect.. i am black british, i agree|`|YeZvTjFtaa	Cracker I bet u haven't yet!  It is time now for all the Crackers to be Slave!<br>  <br>  We will see how much you like that Shyt!!|`|522Oa2apaa	its kinda hard to measure the injustices that were committed by your evil white race toward blacks and jews. jews are rich now bcuz they have gotten reparations of over 100 billion dollars and 4 billion is given to then annually. whites have NEVER been slaves, its more like indentured servants who were treated MUCH better than compared to blacks. you said "why is slavery the excuse for every problem?" i say- " why are blacks an excuse for white people problems?"<br>  we are all different and blacks have such a load of problems to deal with everyday to even worry about who else have been slaves upon this land. also , go and study the history of black america and their TREMENDOUS contribution to america, then you would not say such IGNORANT and EVIL things. afterall you said " i feeel no sympathy" just proved your evil race.|`|g2JlIuRcaa	Thye may not be the only group but blacks have been through so much in this country. Not only were they STOLEN from their country. They were sold as property and their women were raped and families were seperated and treated like cattle. If that wasn't bad enough once they were freed, they were treated like second class citizens. And this happed for over 100 years after slavery. Lynchings, no jobs, kkk, jim crowe lawas, kids getting spit on.  Oh and i'm sure you've never heard of a little boy named Emitt till??  Well that was what sparked the civil rights movement and was once of the worst crimes against children in human history. I'm sure your anglo teachers never taught you about that one. Well this kid was beaten to death( you couldn't even see his face) for whistling at a women)  They died an anchor to his leg and let him drown in a river, like an animal.  They are thousands of more stories just like that. And you wonder why blacks are pissed off.  People spew this hate about blacks and yet they don't even bother to learn the history.  It gets me so pissed off when i read this stuff. I blame the white anglo school system that doesn't bother to tell the whole civil rights story. The good with the ugly. Kids need to know the ugly side so it doesn't happen again.  BTW emmitt was only 14 years old.  14 years old and he was murdered like that.  Imagine that. Imagine if you knew him. How would you feel then????|`|OOP6Hesyaa	People who believed that blacks are the only ones who have suffered on this planet, and that whites are responsible for all suffering are nothing but idiots who know nothing about history. What about all the Africans and Arabs who are CURRENTLY enslaving blacks over in Africa? And what about the 4,000 blacks that owned slaves here in the US when it was legal? Did you know that pre-Civil War there were 262,000 free blacks living in the South, and that 28% of them owned slaves? Yeah, that's a figure you anti-white racists like to skim over.|`|bYUzDvDUaa	hey who every said  that crackers should be enslaved  should  be quite cuz ur  *** wasnt enslaved okay and any hw wtf did i do to repress  blacks  jews or any other race okay  u need to let  it go !! its stupid okay and plus  it was our ancesters that did it not me infact hell my ancesters werent even here okay!! theey was in iceland!! and i dont understand why i get freaking called cracker okay o and  indians  think about them okay they was  freaking screwed bad to!!!|`|R2bnQmrLaa	There are worst evils you can commit on humanity.

If you take the time to study it out, you will no longer have a need to wonder, you can know for sure. The martyrs the Bible speaks of that come through the Great Tribulation, are the Jews and those who repent and believe and turn their lives over to Christ during the tribulation as well as those who were found to be lukewarm at the time of the rapture and find themselves outside the door and then afterward get off the fence and really choose Christ. Read the parable of the ten virgins. Also, read the letters to the Churches in Revelation. The parable of the ten virgins as well as the letters to the 7 Churches, will illuminate that not all who claim to be "Christians" will find themselves included in the rapture.|`|Pf4wlWZAaa	shame,,,shame|`|py57svUyaa	Noooooo.

udUzdU7Raa	I agree. The evolution theory is faulty. Never have scientists proven to us why the evolution suddenly stopped.

They also believe that man has survived because he has a larger brain, but science has proved that man only uses 1/10 of one percent of his brain, where as the monkey that has a smaller brain uses their whole brain. Therefore science has proved creation is right & they don't even know it.<br>  Anyone that believes in evolution is in fact proving that only 1/10 of one percent is all they are using of their brain!|`|jER0X5OPaa	Keep in mind that evolution is a theory, and that it doesn't have the answers to everything.<br>  <br>  My teacher pointed out to us the other day that chimps, etc. evolved for a different environment, so we are not necessarily more evolved than them, we have just evolved for different needs, surroundings, etc. For example, if a human just moved into the environment that a chimp lives in, we would have a much harder time than they do and would be at a disadvantage, whereas if a chimp came into our environment, they would be at a disadvantage.<br>  <br>  I don't think the theory says that humans came from apes. It's that we shared a common ancestor. Meaning, there was a being a very, very long time ago that was not a human, but not quite a chimp, either. Eventually, this creature evolved in two different ways (not necessarily at the same time). One of those ways was walking more and more upright, etc, while the other was staying more hunched over, amongst other things. So it's not that one came from the other, it's that we each share an ancestor from way back in the day.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure if we will ever know if evolution is right or wrong. It is just a theory, though it does have a lot of evidence to support it. Also, keep in mind that gravity is a theory, also. If you would like to know more, try googling evolution and see what comes up.|`|8OjEcDyBaa	Evolution does not mean that all creatures will eventually become intelligent and dexterous enough to convert potential energy into rotational energy (make cars).<br>  <br>  Evolution simply states that creatures that are less successful at surviving are less likely to procreate, and that the qualities associated with not surviving successfully will be genetically eliminated over time. <br>  <br>  The fact that spider monkeys do not make cars simply means that the intelligence and dexterity required to make cars is not necessary to their survival. <br>  <br>  With humans, though we can survive without cars, the intelligence that allowed us to make them was at one time necessary for our survival in the natural world, and therefore, the humans that possessed this intelligence procreated more frequently and it became the norm among our species. <br>  <br>  <br>  Best of luck,<br>  -Fox|`|LsJqpTWsaa	We didn't come from them, nor did they come from us.

nuCXcLUIaa	I never quite fit in at high school.  I recently took a test here in California during my second year and passed.  Currently I haven't found anyone to really connect with, but I have hope for the future.  My high school was a lot of homophobia, drugs, and sex thrown into a Catholic high school background.  So after you heard about the kid that almost od'd at the party, you got to go to mass.|`|pYn2L2DHaa	There were people who shunned me in high school, particularly the jocks and the well-off kids from the east side of town.    Of course, these were the same folks who had never left the city and were working relatively low-paying jobs, and on their third and fourth marriages when I came back for my 30th high school reunion.      I came back with my partner of 15 years, told about having concertized in Europe and the U.S., premiered several pieces which had been written for me, and was living a successful life in Texas -- to the stony stares of the jocks who never left the city, had never taken any real risks, and had really done nothing with their lives.     Payback's a b!t?h -- and frankly, I loved every minute of it!|`|8ZUVToXgaa	Not really....I was sort of the popular unpopular kid.    Almost everyone in my grade knew of me and liked me but I wasn't so popular that lots of people hung out with me. I just had a handful of friends that I'd hang with after school.|`|ox5GMwEEaa	i was a loner..No one liked me i think that fact that I was gay! I was made fun off..the works.. I sat alone at lunch..never had Friends. I think that hurt me and how to react with people! Now I am 24 and I am still really shy. I know really know how to meet people. Although im getting better I think it did affect me!|`|52VDjbNTaa	I'm in high school at the moment.  Only a few people know, about 5?  I'm not really accepted by any apart from my best friend, who is completely cool with it.  The rest are very homophobic, which is quite scary for me, and the main reason I haven't come out yet.|`|4f53edbce16f4673f58a9dcccc9dfddfaa	For me, it really depends how you look at it.  I was involved in a lot of activities and knew a lot of people and was the kind of person who had tons of acquaintances and said hi to people in the hallway all the time, and I also had a small number of close friends, so I wasn't shunned, but at the same time I wasn't like this popular kid either.  I like the description of the one guy who replied, "popular unpopular kid".  I was never like the type of kid who hung out with the most popular kids at school, but at the same time I don't think they disliked me.  I was never completely disregarded or anything, despite being a "goth" kid or whatever.  I never really fit the mold of the rest of the "goth" kids at my school (who weren't really goth anyway) though since unlike them I was successful academically and had friends and acquaintances of all different types (surprisingly, I wasn't really friends with the so-called goth kids, but moreso with the gays, the Asians, the indie kids, and then one group of people I hung out with were all Wiccans and were slightly weird, but none of them were goths [or mallgoths in the case of my high school]).  I will say although I wasn't really shunned and I did have close friends, I never felt like I had too many friends that I could just call up and hang out with anytime I wanted, like as in best friends, I guess.  That might have just been me being afraid that they didn't really want to hang out (even if they did), so I never reached out to them to do so.  And as far as life now, in college, it's pretty much the same way.  I have some close friends and we hang out on occasion, but I don't feel comfortable enough just calling them up on a random night and asking if they want to hang out so when we do hang out, it's at their invitation typically.|`|tvHIotngaa	yes but now I have an excellent group of friends.|`|h49orCfEaa	Yes, but I found out a lot about myself and others through a book titled "Please Understand Me". Yeah, it's a really cheesy title, but it taught me things that my mother/peers could not.|`|5JrVhb04aa	I was never really liked by the majority of the kids at school and it was mostly based on appearance and rumors about me (I'm pretty sure rumors drove away some friends that quit talking to me for no reason) but I did have my own small group of friends that were with me through everything no matter what. I believe it did make me more guarded towards other people though and I find it extremely hard to let people get too close to me now, but I guess other than the social awkwardness life is ok.|`|uaAVh0bXaa	Yes I was never the popular girl but I did have a small group of friends whom two-three of them I am still friends with. Sure I had aquantances such as a couple of 'goths'(but in fact they were mallgoths...they just thought they were goths),a couple of 'emos' & a couple of 'preps' but my group was basically the hyper,random & normal crowd. I have found people who have accepted me(I used to be the 'emo' at school but now I'm not so much an 'emo'. I mean sure I still wear skinny jeans,band tees,converse,fishnets but I also wear boots,bright colors,cute 'preppy' outfits & gypsy/17th-18th style clothes so I have discovered my own individual tastes) Sure the guys still don't pay  any attention to me but as some people tell me 'its not you,its them.They're just freaking blind' & besides 70% of NZ guys are hidious,I prefer Italian,French,Irish,English,Australian & some American guys. I think as you grow up the more you realize that people will accept you as long as you don't intimidate them via looks. Unfortunatly everything in this society comes down to first impressions & if you look scary or different then you wont be accepted in this world.
ZoPln7vaaa	Yes! Its absolutely a rapture|`|Rt4bJfVAaa	No.  What it instead shows was a completion of the act of redemption of Jesus Christ.  Who can say but the old saints tell the living Jews that Jesus Christ was more than a miracle worker.  He is the messiah of Israel whose power is not just spiritual rebirth but with resurrection power also.  Remember the resurrection is proof that man is no longer under the curse of sin which is death both in body and in spirit.  That is what Jesus did for those that believed.  They no longer were under the curse of sin.  <br>  <br>  It may have something to do also with what Peter wrote in 1 Peter 3:18-22 18For Christ died for sins once for all, the righteous for the unrighteous, to bring you to God. He was put to death in the body but made alive by the Spirit, 19through whom[a] also he went and preached to the spirits in prison 20who disobeyed long ago when God waited patiently in the days of Noah while the ark was being built. In it only a few people, eight in all, were saved through water, 21and this water symbolizes baptism that now saves you also—not the removal of dirt from the body but the pledge[e] of a good conscience toward God. It saves you by the resurrection of Jesus Christ, 22who has gone into heaven and is at God's right hand—with angels, authorities and powers in submission to him.<br>  <br>  The rapture is a different incident and one that could occur at any minute.|`|vmOyWzilaa	This was to show the people..... that many people they knew and/or heard about years ago that died were actually resurrected from the dead, proving that with Christ there will be a Resurrection for believers.<br>  Isn't that wonderful Praise God.|`|nzdDdKtyaa	Sounds more like a mass-resurrection.|`|UD7d70awaa	God loves you.|`|FjiRPKp2aa	I believe that was a sign of things to come.The old testament saints rose with Christ. It will be our turn some day.|`|udUzdU7Raa	This is called the first resurrection. When Jesus Christ was resurrected, those who died before him were also resurrected. The same thing will happen when he comes again. When we are resurrected, our bodies are made pure, with no defects. They had become eternal beings like God. Once they had finished their preaching, they returned to live with God in heaven.<br>  <br>  You may want to do some reading on the subject to get a fuller understanding.|`|M8s1886Paa	actually my teacher was explaining this to us today in class. when it says "and the graves were opened" it means jesus already came to earth and then he opened the graves of those who were dead in christ (good people) and were sent to the holy city for a thousand years and no there is no rapture. after this those who are still alive and follow christ go to the holy city also and then all the wicked are burned in the lake of fire until they die(not forever and ever) and then the devil and all his demons are trapped on erath for those thousand years to think of what theyve done. the good people who are in "heaven" use those 1000 years to ask god and jesus all the questions they have and to see why some people didnt make it to heaven, and then god brings down the holy city from the heavens and sets it on earth and then the wicked dead people will rise from their graves and see the good people in the holy city and try to get in and also the devil and his demons will try to destroy the holy city and then god will show them all the sins they have done and they will know why they arent in the holy city and then god will put them to sleep and he will destroy the devil once and for all and the people of god will live happily ever after in the holy city<br>  <br>  im sorry if this is hard to understand but im 14 and trying my best to reemember it<br>  <br>  also you might want to see a dvd called the final events by pastor doug bachelor|`|d42418ca88e523b628710adb23553fb1aa	They were resurrected, I have no knowledge of a so called rapture, mentioned in scripture.

You can retaliate by inviting the brother for lunch but make it clear his girlfriend isn't invited--or better still, invite the brother's girlfriend but without the brother then make sure she has a fantastic time (so next time she'll be the one who insists you are invited).|`|VMY7No0eaa	3 mo is the ans.  not ready to include you in the FAMILY.  the other gf does not have issues with your bf.. so included    I SUGGEST that you mend fences w/ the bf's bro. if you want to be included.|`|0XsykyuFaa	you should take it|`|OXNiEDROaa	If there is a rift, it was a smart move.  He wanted to visit his brother without snippy comments being made or glares from across the table....or you coming back stating "you didnt take my side" you didn't support me" etc.      we girls are weird like that.  Be happy you weren't subject to the obnoxious brother!|`|Z7KRAzbeaa	He wants to see his brother and the two of you do not get along...so why would he invite you?  Sounds like you want him to choose you over his brother.  You've only been together 3 months and I doubt he likes the fact that he is in the position to have to choose.  If you really like this guy, then try to not say negatives about his brother, and probably next time he would invite you.  If his brother said something bad to you in front of your boyfriend, and your BF did not speak up for you....I would move on.

I would have called the teacher out on that if it had been me... I know my husband was born in the Philippines, and his family moved here when he was 2 years old... and when he tells people he was born in Manila, and the fact that he is Filipino they automatically assume he is not a citizen and ask for his green card... he then puts them in their place when he whips out his "American Citizen Passport"...

Seriously, there were MANY terrible things to happen AFTER slavery that involved many white people all over the country who might have never owned slaves either. There is RACISM in this country that you people don't seem to notice because you only see the anger directed at you from frustrated people and you run and hide and call reverse racism. <br>  <br>  The day I realize that more white people know things about other cultures and traditions of people apart from themselves, I will stop classifying all of them together. You might not be racist yourself, but you are coming from a long line of people who looked like you and did terrible things in this country, Welcome to America sweetheart! A country built on supreme racism.<br>  <br>  AND: I like Irish people, I like the traditions and the culture.  I'm not dumb. I know many Irish were even Indentured Servants and had to go through VERY tough times in America. I know the importance of Kennedy's Presidency in America as a Catholic and a lot of other things, but somehow it seems hard to find a white person (regardless of where they come from) who can sympathize or even try to understand black/Mexican people..... I don't understand that.... and It bothers me......|`|ytl2PONXaa	White people founded Europe. America was founded by the Spanish. <br>  <br>  And your teacher is generalizing because she is a horrible instructor and you should say "I'm Irish and my people were enslaved too, when do we learn about that?" <br>  <br>  It will teach her a lesson or else piss her off enough to send you to the principle where you can state that she is singling you out for being white, which is racism.|`|zCjzu5claa	Im hispanic myself and yeah I have to say she was pin pointing you really bad, which is wrong, but sadly Ive also seen situations were the teacher can be either hispanic or black and attack white people with "racial lessons" and Ive also seen and experienced the same you are with white professors as well who also say negative comments about black and hispanic people. so yeah, this all sadly happens because of lack of respect and racism.|`|nG9nxMySaa	people have a lot of biases whether they realize it or not. just ignore it, the teacher is ignorant to make such generalizations. she probably wasn't even really trying to single you out. just don't worry about it.<br>  <br>  i just went to ireland a couple months ago, lol :)|`|ae64998b9af9beb58d578c1c5fbd8e78aa	ignorance<br>  it will fail to shock you after a while<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  answer mine:<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=ApuA6UZ_DZzw.qkKa7J1Ndrsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090220204238AA65Uwm">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|ef7tAoYsaa	People just hate whites.

My full race is white and my ethnicity is half cuban and half american.  There is a difference between race and ethinicty btw. My mother's family is irish. Anyways i am sure some people look at me and think the same way.  My dads family has been here for 50 years and my mothers prob since the 1900's.  Even though there were slaves in cuba my family never owned them. And as far as i know there were no slaves in ireland.  Sadly people don't know that side of me nor do they care. All they see is skin color. I am sorry you had to go through that.<br>  My struggle is that fact that i am proud to be hispanic and speak spanish but am constantly hurt when people deny my hertiage due to the fact that i am have white skin.

That is why all mammals have such similar skeletons, with mostly minor differences of scale and proportion.  <br>  <br>  Big jumps are very unlikely because so many more things can go wrong than can go right with each mutation.  So small, incremental changes are more likely to be survivable until further mutations alter then in ways that make then better for a few lucky individuals.  <br>  <br>  It is sort of like making random changes to an airplane's design while it is flying.  The final result not only has to work, but all the steps that got it there have to work, as well, even though some of them may not work wonderfully.<br>  <br>  -- <br>  Regards,<br>  <br>  John Popelish

tK5swgX1aa	I think everyone should just get along|`|g2JlIuRcaa	i guess it depends where you live.  blacks and hispanics get a long better in nyc cause they live in the same neighborhoods. Plus there are many afro latinos in new york and new jersey  Blacks and hispanics in the southwest and LA don't seem to get along because they are very different culturally.  Mexican Americans don't have much afro blood and i guess they see some blacks as a threat.  In miami there also racial problems. Miami is mostly populated by cubans. most cubans who came during the revolution were the rich white upper class. They are mostly conservative and have problems with blacks and other groups.  Plus i don't think minorites like to be lumped all together. While their struggles may be similar there are a lot of differences that cause conflicts.|`|zCjzu5claa	hispanic people and black people get along better than these two races than with white people. when hispanic people and black people dont get along is in ignorant high school, because these two races both have a very strong character and they both want to be the boss and not be bullied around by either one, so they tend to clash at each other in school and this is no good, because while the white people are being ignored, they tend to study more while blacks and hispanics are chopping of their heads in fights, white people then graduate, then hispanics and blacks are the bad generation in this world in the eye of the ignored.

2dfdfcdb4d65c895a40f81c0cb21ef17aa	Apparently, some people do have legitimate fragrance sensitivities...and it's true that some people  go overboard with the cologne wearing and make things worse.  I used to be one of the latter when I was in my late 20s-early 30s.     This is what happened to me re: people complaining about excessive use of cologne.  Just imagine walking into a break room on the job and hearing someone saying that you smell like a funeral parlor!  Talk about humiliation!  I cried in the bathroom for an hour while furiously trying to wipe off the perfume from my body....I was 28 at the time, but did Iearn my lesson? No. Fast forward 5 years, age 33 and imagine finding a typewritten note on your car complaining about your supposedly liberal use of perfume and the note is signed "concerned breather."  When I complained to human resources about the letter, they actually sided with the letter writer and told me to tone it down or stop wearing it...or I'd be written up!      Years later, I found out where fragrance senstivity is concerned, the issue isn't so much with cologne itself or whether or not the scent gives offense, it's the chemicals that make up the colognes that cause the allergic reactions...and that's the real problem! Some colognes and scents can literally make a person physially sick.  Let me tell if I had know about this back in the late 80s and early 90s, I would've NEVER imposed my cologne on people. I really feel bad about this now.  So I now support fragrance free environments.  It took awhile, but I learned my lesson  and now most of the time I wear no cologne at all or I stick to a the lightest scent I can find...and I wear it only on special occasions and NEVER to work!  So not worth the hassle...or the risk that I may have been responsible in causing someone else to get sick.       There are many workplaces and even entire cities with ordinances re: the use of perfume in public places.  That's the trend these days and it's not likely to reverse itself.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	Depends on the fragrance, also some people are actually allergic to the scents. Jungle Gardenia makes me nauseous.|`|vwoqIUR6aa	people have their preferences.

mSFjbetxaa	Because his story was made up decades after he, supposedly, died.|`|4GiIXWUXaa	Because WE speak english goober.<br>  <br>  Otherwise it's Yeshua.<br>  <br>  xoxo ?|`|LQQAQDkIaa	Because of Latin and Greek. Pax Christi|`|ZoPln7vaaa	Its we who call HIM like that as we speak in English|`|pRF5LLloaa	Because English the the best know and most used language in the world.  Chinese has more NATIVE speakers, but the majority of the world has English as a second language.<br>  <br>  Like most of the words in the English language, "Jesus" is an anglicized pronunciation of a word from another language, in this case the Greek word, "Iasou".|`|eTED1Nwwaa	The simplest answer is translations.  With every new translation comes new meaning.  Jesus just stuck.<br>  <br>  Also, a few hundred years ago most people didn't have a Bible.  The only people allowed to even read the Bible were those who were high up in the church; pope, bishops, etc.  It was up to them to tell the people what the Bible said.  <br>  <br>  This made it a lot easier for those who were reading the Bible to make it say what they wanted it to.  The people in the church probable wanted to worship Jesus in there own language and this is the name that got passed down.|`|69750f25faea5e6021c54c23d0dcb774aa	“Jesus” (IPA: /?d?iz?s/) is a transliteration, occurring in a number of languages and based on the Latin Iesus, of the Greek ?ησο?? (Iēso?s), itself a Hellenisation of the Hebrew ????? (Yehoshua) or Hebrew-Aramaic ???? (Yeshua ), (Joshua), meaning “YHWH rescues”. "YHWH" is the name of God in the Hebrew tradition, often rendered as "the LORD" in English.|`|py57svUyaa	That is a wrong assumption. He is best known as Jesus to YOU.  I have known him most of my life as Je?í?.  Most languages clone names, the older the more 'customized' the names are.|`|3oNcHdgCaa	Because names tend to get translated through different languages over the course of thousands of years. The English "Jesus" comes from the Greek "Iesous"|`|9KBqN0KAaa	Jesus probaly would've had a slight touch of the tarbrush too.<br>  <br>  but that's never mentioned.|`|0Ad0SrEfaa	We call him Gomer where I live|`|AA11690436	Best known by whom?  Over a billion and a half muslims know him as Issa.|`|YupMCYHlaa	Actually that is a good question.  Not one single book of the New Testament was written during Jesus' lifetime, or by anyone who ever actually met him or talked to him.  The books were all written in Greek, which was the language of writers in the Roman Empire, not a language that Jesus spoke.  So though his name was probably more like 'Yeshua' (Joshua), we know him by his Greek name, Jesus.

e8a42257dd2b34817d2020222ee63839aa	We work at our salvation every day.  "Saved" isn't supposed to be something a Christian worries about.    Jesus gave us once preeminent commandment:  Love one another as I have loved you.  That's all we need to focus on.    Unless you're believe in Him only to avoid going to hell, being "saved" is a non issue.|`|HBp5r76haa	Just one way: follow Jesus Christ.    If you love Him with all your heart and you strive to be like Him every day of your life, you will "stay" saved. Remember that the Holy Spirit dwells in you and He who started a good work in you will finish it.    You don't want Scripture, but this one is hardly taken out of context:  "8He will keep you strong to the end, so that you will be blameless on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ." (1 Cor 1:8).    I have been studying the whole Bible since the moment I gave my heart to Christ. It took me about 1 year to read it from beginning to end. Then I kept reading it as the Spirit was leading me and have new revelation every day.    My Church is a non-denomination full-gospel Church in Daly City. We believe in the power of the Holy Ghost in the Church of Christ still today.|`|7kJFmyxdaa	Simplest of answers: Once you accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior you are saved. Nothing or no one can take that away from you. If you are asking how to remain right with God, you read your Bible, pray and follow His instructions in right living. You are not perfect. Jesus was the only perfect person who walked this earth. We are all sinners. Christians are simply sinners "saved by grace". So don't think just because you messed up that you lost your salvation. You did not. Ask God for forgiveness. He will forgive you. You can not lose your salvation.|`|ttTDiJWfaa	The whole "saved" thing is about them trying to take your money and turn you into a subserviant lapdog. You do know that,don't you?|`|TyRfv0eoaa	Peter told the crowd on the day the church began how to be saved. I believe the same thing: Repent, be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ into the forgiveness of sins, receive the Holy Ghost with the initial evidence of speaking in other tongues. To stay saved, live for God.    I've been studying the Bible since 1974, in English as well as Hebrew and Greek. I'm an Apostolic Pentecostal.|`|EpqSDAGyaa	Believe with your heart and confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord. Staying saved iS another story..Seek God through prayer reading the word of God , fasting. Try to be Christ like as much as possible. The most important of the the commandments is LOVE.. so show much love to EVERYONE!|`|9mLjDa5kaa	I've been blessed by the Lord Jesus to be able to study the Bible every day for over 9 years.      I am loosely with a Free Grace system  :)     It is IMPOSSIBLE to lose or "leave" salvation (John 6:39-40, 1 John 5:13).     If you think you can lose or "leave" salvation, then you might not be saved at all. Because Jesus gives ETERNAL life, not "temporary" or "probationary" life. So if you think you can lose it, then you don't understand the Gospel of Jesus Christ. What you have is a false gospel of works, and no false gospel will get you into heaven (Galatians 1:6-9).     In other words, until a person believes that what he has received from the Lord Jesus is permanent and cannot be lost, he is not yet born again. A person cannot believe in Christ alone for his eternal destiny and also believe that he must do something (or avoid doing something) to keep it.|`|ba0d5ff814e4de743ed883cab2a57206aa	A person gets saved by believing that Jesus died for the sins of man and that they are sinners in need of a savior and they ask Jesus to be their personal savior.  Once saved you stay saved. Satan may put doubt on your mind about being saved, but that does not mean you are not. God stays the same, it is man who changes.  I have been going to bible studies on and off for 22 years.  I go to an American Baptist Church.|`|db7df25ea31227e5641d5c32d43c3bcdaa	to get saved you need to call on jesus to save you and believe he raised from the dead. Romans 10:9-13    When Jesus knocks on your hearts door ask him in.  Revelation 3:20    Pray as this man did.  Luke 18:13    once we are saved we receive the holy spirit.  It is our down payment of God for our inheritance we receive.  It is called our earnest payment.  The holy spirit is the guarantee of our salvation.  Ephesians 1:13-14  Ephesians 4:30    A person who has the holy Spirit will not go back to a sinful state  1 John 3:9  Whosoever is born of God does not commit sin; for his seed remains in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.       The power of the Holy Spirit keeps us from Sin.    Jam 4:7  Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.    I have studied the bible for 42 years and am southern baptist|`|61fe545ae98d416c70ed3a3245764042aa	One is saved by trusting in Christ as the Savior completely. "Staying saved" is a weird phrase because it creates the idea that we must "do" something in order to be (or remain) saved. That's antithetical to what Scripture teaches, however, since Scripture teaches we're saved by grace alone trough faith alone because of Christ alone. He is our Savior - alone - period. We trust only in Him and in His righteousness - not in our own works. Now, some people would say: "Well, that means I can sin with impunity and still go to Heaven!" No. You can't & (if you're really saved) that will be the last thing on your mind. For, while salvation is grounded in Christ alone, that salvation also includes sanctification. God, if He has saved you, will change you in this life. What you once loved (i.e., to sin) you will begin to hate as you grow in the grace and knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ.     Studying the Bible for 10 years.     Attend a Reformed Christian church.
6oASoFr7aa	I'm so annoyed by all these percentages and **** some of y'all keep throwing out there. First of all we only make up 13/14% of the population. Segregation only ended like 50 years agos. Back then you muthafu**cka's (white) parents could go get a job at a nuclear facility or hi tech job without a degree or anything just because you were being white. Then you muthfu**cka's set up a system where you gotta go to college to do anything knowing that 1st and 2nd desegregate blacks wouldn't be ablr to afford. Show a black man how to do anything and he'll do it 10x better than you. Y'all bullshit are schools, even with scholarships y'all end a better position to go school than us. And I personally think the whole k thru 12 set up is bullshit. How you gone say you went to school for 12yrs and then come out without a degree, everyone knows that you it's easier to learn **** when you're young. I have an A.S in computer programming and the typical prototype caucasian always get the job before me. I was fortunate enough to cut my own lane. I don't believe the statistics in the since that there told. No matter how many black folks who are on food stamps there are way->way more white ppl on foodstamps and getting government aid. I don't like how they portray my brothers and sisters in Africa for 1 bc how you going to say someone has AIDS just because they cough. It takes one stripe there for someone to beconsidered to havve H.I.V. 2 stripes here and 3 stripes in Canada, to be honest I don't even believe that it's a true std. (Read Dr. Peter Duesenburg-the man who discovered the retro virus-google the movie the otherside of AIDS) I've seen tons of single parent family statisrics and remember white ppl make up more than 70% of the population so no matter how big our numbers seem relative to our population, yours will alwaya be bigger compared to ours-relatively. I usually try to stay away from this section of Y!A but I see i'm going to have  visit once and awhile to slap some of you crackers across the face with my big black di**ck. That's why you muthafu**cka's have to go and have operations and pay for it.|`|4Vmlf902aa	Maybe he thinks Madea is the craziest black woman in America.|`|2tn8EALqaa	RIHANNA represents strong black women? Funny. I wonder why "Oprah" doesn't or why "Condoleezza" doesn't.<br>  Typical.<br>  80% have children out of wedlock? Oh whatever.<br>  <br>  <br>  Anyway, no, I wouldn't, because that is silly.|`|0rDDPTi5aa	Yes she is.  People are misunderstanding the question.  It does not mean that black women never suffer domestic violence or have children out of wedlock, but the fact of the black race surviving what it did, would not have happened without the strength of the black woman.  Let me explain.<br>  <br>  <br>  During slavery, the males were often just used as studs, the black female typically was the sole caretaker of raising the child, in addition to her duties as a slave.  After slavery, during segregation, job opportunities were slim for black males, many moved up North to the big cities to get work, who was left to hold down the fort?  The black woman.  Many times she has been forced to take on the role of woman and man, and not lose her head. <br>  <br>   In most cultures, the male was the head, and took on the resonsibility of working and making the decisions, while the woman was at home.  In the black family, the black woman never had that luxury.  That's probably why you do not see a lot of black feminists, they were already in the workforce and having to take the lead, they were forced to do so, much earlier than white women began to enter the work force, that did not happen until WWII.  <br>  <br>  The first self made female millionaire in America was a black woman, Madam CJ Walker.  Also, black women had to fight racism and sexism, and was often viewed as the bottom of the totem pole in American heirarchy:<br>  <br>  white man<br>  white woman<br>  black man<br>  black woman<br>  <br>  All of this, yet black women are succeeding, some even more so than black men, and they often hold the family together.  That is why Larry King said that.  Please read the link below, very interesting.|`|VpR6qvb5aa	No.<br>  Except maybe for Florida Evans.|`|ElwwR0HTaa	yeah.|`|EufLQ9dKaa	Look at history, you will find the answer to your question.<br>  Harriet Tubman, Madame C.J.

Giving birth to the child who is a result of the master's rape, breastfeeding and caring for the masters children, fighting for your rights right next to your brothers. Sitting in the front of the bus because you know you deserve to even when others say your black skin is not worthy. Even though some black men say you're not good enough when they really just want a weaker woman who will stand for anything and not tell them about their not so good ways. 62% of black women are in the workforce.  Sorry, but the stereotypical Sha Nae Nae does not represent all of us! Our strength is passed from generation to generation.  Michele Obama said she loves Barack because he is one of the few men she knows who is not afraid of a strong woman.  Black women are survivors.  We are born to be. Larry King would not be saying it if it were not true! JEALOUSY IS A BAD THING AND AN OBVIOUS THING. NO ONE ELSE IN THE WORLD HAS SHOWN THE STREGNTH OF A BLACK WOMAN.

ISLAM is the only religion that ALLAH gives us since from the first Prophet Adam to the last prophet Muhammad (PBUH). If you always read a bible, we noticed that holy People written there they are praying as what we are muslims doing 5 times daily. They vowed down to the ground till their forehead touched to the groud level. Jesus Christ says in the bible: I am not come here to destroy the Prophets nor the Laws but to fulfill on it. Meaning, even the manner of praying to GOD has not been changed by any prophets. In addition; fasting also was prescribed to us mankind and it is written in the bible that the prophets also doing it..I hope you satisfy my opinion...May Allah bestow HIS mercy on you..|`|3HR1SfGMaa	I believe that would be called spiritual but not religious
386wULS8aa	His circumcision-name was Saul but Paul like all others of the bible, Mary, mother of Jesus, John (banned to the island of patmos) had God sent angels or himself in a dream and told them to write down what he said. God wrote the bible using people, just people. You have to read the bible and ask for God to open your eyes, The bible is a spiritual book not a literal book, its Gods word, not mans.

Why? because God was sending Paul to the Gentiles {of all people} for a Pharisee to teach the Gospel of Jesus Christ because a Pharisee thought they were above the Gentiles.<br>  Any time in the scriptures when you read of an angel or the Lord  appearing to people their first feeling is fear and some don't know if they are dreaming, just as the angel appeared to Joseph about Mary when he was sleeping.<br>  Paul was teaching what God instructed him too and Paul was teaching what Jesus taught except Jesus was teaching the Jewish people.

s2GCKeouaa	Not only that, but Thomas has more parallel verses with Mathew, Mark, and Luke, than the Gospel of John has.

I think that Mark and Thomas are actually the oldest of the Gospels.|`|zPfgFXU5aa	The gospel of Thomas is a forgery written by the Gnostic Cult which means it fails the test of Apostolic authority.     None of the early church fathers from Clement to Irenaeus ever quoted from the gospel of Thomas. This indicates that they either did not know of it or that they rejected it as spurious.     In either case, the early church fathers fail to support the gospel of Thomas' claim to have been written by the apostle. (It was believed to by written around 140 A.D. which is much later than the NT Gospels  and there is no evidence to support its purported claim to be written by the Apostle Thomas himself.)    The gospel of Thomas fails to conform to the rule of faith. It purports to contain 114 "secret sayings" of Jesus. Some of these are very similar to the sayings of Jesus recorded in the Four Gospels. For example the gospel of Thomas quotes Jesus as saying, "A city built on a high hill cannot be hidden." This reads the same as Matthew's Gospel except that high is added.     But Thomas also claims that Jesus said, "Split wood; I am there. Lift up a stone, and you will find me there." That concept is pantheistic.     Thomas ends with the following saying that denies women salvation unless they are some how changed into being a man. "Let Mary go away from us, because women are not worthy of life." Jesus is quoted as saying, "Lo, I shall lead her in order to make her male, so that she too may become a living spirit, resembling you males. For every woman who makes herself male will enter into the kingdom of heaven."  which conflicts  with the known teachings of Jesus and the Old Testament.       The lack of manuscript evidence plus the failure of the early church fathers to quote from it or recognize it shows that it was never used or accepted in the early Church.     This "gospel" therefore fails the test of continuous usage and acceptance.|`|QLDMmp6Taa	There are several early church fathers that denounced it as heretical so that is probably why it never even was considered.  I read that the earliest copy was believed to have been written sometime between 50AD and 100AD (seems like I read somewhere though, that current surviving copies are much later-- past the time when they put the bible together???).    EDIT:  There are other things that didn't make the bible either.  Some of them are not considered to be even heretical (like the story of Joseph's death).  You shouldn't put too much stock in those books...the early church Fathers knew what was true and what wasn't.|`|lTx8Hoheaa	Good point. Just because a room of bigshots voted to not make it canon, doesn't make it so.|`|WhUV9k6Jaa	Because the Gospel of Thomas implies that God is within and you don't need the Church to have a relationship with God.  That doctrine doesn't fill the collection plates.|`|oHrqbdydaa	Canon is very arbitrary. After all, if they put a totally whacked out book like Revelation in there, anything is possible.
gHSarVD1aa	Jesus was crucified for saying he was GOD. The Gospel of John and Hebrews goes into great detail about Jesus being fully GOD.    But I am afraid that people will heap up for themselves teachers that will "properly translate" a book that is written on a sixth grade reading level to make it say the exact opposite of what is so clearly stated in it.    This alone should be a big fat flashing clue that we are in a really nasty spiritual war. Hang tough bro! Watch and pray. We will make it.    May the LORD richly bless you.|`|81SiImlSaa	With respect I have to tell you that the Bible is not a book of facts, it is a book of stories which people, like yourself, use to justify many beliefs and actions.   I do not mean to be offencive but you really cannot use the Bible alone as your basis for your supposition.  You must offer separate, verifiable and quantitative sources outside the Bible.   Anything less makes your statements, not false necessarily, but definitely flawed.|`|60303894b298b261e863d683d3b7c896aa	Some translations have worship where others have something different.(Matthew 28:17) and when they saw him they did obeisance, but some doubted.    Douay-Rheims Bible  And seeing them they adored: but some doubted.     Darby Bible Translation  And when they saw him, they did homage to him: but some doubted.     Weymouth New Testament  There they saw Him and prostrated themselves before Him. Yet some doubted.    World English Bible  When they saw him, they bowed down to him, but some doubted.    Young's Literal Translation  and having seen him, they bowed to him, but some did waver.    Scholars derive the Greek term from the verb kyneo, kiss.The usage of the word in the Christian Greek Scriptures (as also in the Greek Septuagint translation of the Hebrew Scriptures) shows that persons to whose actions the term is applied prostrated themselves or bowed down.|`|2BBKHggeaa	OBEISANCE  The act of bowing, kneeling, prostrating the body, or making some other gesture to betoken submission; or simply the paying of respect. It adequately translates the Hebrew hishtachawah and the Greek proskyneo in many cases.    Christ Jesus has been exalted by his Father to a position second only to God, so that in the name of Jesus every knee should bend of those in heaven and those on earth and those under the ground, and every tongue should openly acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father. (Php 2:9-11; compare Da 7:13, 14,?27.) Hebrews 1:6 also shows that even the angels render obeisance to the resurrected Jesus Christ. Many translations of this text here render proskyneo as worship, while some render it by such expressions as bow before (AT; Yg) and pay homage (NE). No matter what English term is used, the original Greek remains the same and the understanding of what it is that the angels render to Christ must accord with the rest of the Scriptures. Jesus himself emphatically stated to Satan that it is Jehovah your God you must worship [form of proskyneo], and it is to him alone you must render sacred service. (Mt 4:8-10; Lu 4:7,?8) Similarly, the angel(s) told John to worship God (Re 19:10; 22:9), and this injunction came after Jesus resurrection and exaltation, showing that matters had not changed in this regard. True, Psalm 97, which the apostle evidently quotes at Hebrews 1:6, refers to Jehovah God as the object of the bowing down, and still this text was applied to Christ Jesus. (Ps 97:1,?7) However, the apostle previously had shown that the resurrected Christ is the reflection of [Gods] glory and the exact representation of his very being. (Heb 1:1-3) Hence, if what we understand as worship is apparently directed to the Son by angels, it is in reality being directed through him to Jehovah God, the Sovereign Ruler, the One who made the heaven and the earth and sea and fountains of waters. (Re 14:7; 4:10,?11; 7:11,?12; 11:16,?17; compare 1Ch 29:20; Re 5:13,?14; 21:22.) On the other hand, the renderings bow before and pay homage (instead of worship) are in no way out of harmony with the original language, either the Hebrew of Psalm 97:7 or the Greek of Hebrews 1:6, for such translations convey the basic sense of both hishtachawah and proskyneo.|`|s2GCKeouaa	He quite possibly believed himself to be God, but who's to say that God (or The Gods) did not appear in the flesh in various periods of human history?

The scriptures don't "prove" anything to them..To them they are just words in an old book...It is God that opens their hearts to consideration..Not us...    The purpose of the Apostles was to tell the people the good news..Not make them believe it...Even the apostles went through their time of consideration and conclusion before accepting Jesus...    They have been told, they choose not to believe..Think of the sermon in the Temple..

No matter what we say nor how many times we say that God and Jesus Christ are in fact real, nothing we say will change their minds. We are to pray that God reveal Himself in them by opening their spiritual eyes.. We are to pray that God will change their hearts. This is something only God can do Himself. Then once their heart is indeed receptive to the truth we can begin ministering to them about God and Jesus Christ.    1 Timothy 2  1I urge, then, first of all, that requests, prayers, intercession and thanksgiving be made for everyone 2for kings and all those in authority, that we may live peaceful and quiet lives in all godliness and holiness. 3This is good, and pleases God our Savior, 4who wants all men to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth.|`|r8rykCkGaa	There's no way we can "prove" to an Atheist can Jesus is God come in the flesh because they don't want to believe.

AA11856921	What you are asking is a path to destruction. Look up the meanings of the words, "decision", and "commit". If the man you are with knew that you are thinking this he would realize what an unstable woman he has. Wicca is deception by spirit beings. With hypnosis you run the risk of the hypnotist unconsciously "suggesting" another outcome to you. You should realize that you have to consider all things the best you can before deciding something and then remain faithful to yourself by sticking to a decision made. New information should not be allowed in your mind unless you find that something you used for your decision was a fraud someone convinced you was true. If you, or someone else, changes after your decision that is not fraud. Relationships go through phases that can be problems. This has been studied.

Nearly every religion and faith speaks of seeing your "life come and flash before you" and you go through a life review where an elder angel/council/apostle runs through your life book with you and shows you where you erred and what you could have done.     (I highly suggest reading Life On The Other Side and The Other Side and Back by Sylvir Browne among other authors, it should give you a clear picture of what I'm talking about).     And by the way, Wicca is a religion, and no there is no spells to make you see the future. That's just imaginary. True spellwork is used with intention and the mind, and has nothing to do with what you see on Buffy the Vampire Slayer or Charmed.

um9W8Dy8aa	Nazism was( and still is) incompatible with Christian theology and ethics    There really is no such thing as "Atheist Ethics" for there are so many forms of atheism, ideologies that have atheist antitheism as a basic,such as Communism, and individuals who have no ideological connection who are atheists.    You are right in that atheism (in its materialistic forms) cannot sustain an objective yardstick for morality. In the end, if there is no objective  "Thou shalt not"s of basic "Reason of the Ultimate Mind" then" Might makes right".     The problem is that  if one can make morality totally subjective and subject to consensus wholly, then morality becomes simply 'mores',customs,tastes and the like    The problem with the history of Christendom is not the objective morality it had but the rationalizations that people with power made to get around the demands of the 10 Commandments and the Beatitudes    If we can kill humans because they are inconvenient(as in abortion), then the only justification for such is to make that legal and the "most philisophical " way is to dehumanize and demonize the victims so that the perpetrators can portray themselves as" the real" victims    The very existence of conscience and the almost universal need to rationalize one's own evils or moral  flaws or sins seem to argue for the existence of God as the Ultimate Source of Conscience as well as the Uncaused Cause of all existence|`|rGEZup0Zaa	WTF?    Atheism: lack of belief in deities.    How do you go from that simple statement to saying an atheist has no means to morally condemn Nazism?    The vast majority of Nazi's were theists, mostly Christian.    Their belief in an absolute, unchanging moral yardstick did NOTHING to stop them from perpetrating the very atrocities you use to wrongly denigrate atheism. In fact, their belief that they were doing "the Lord's work" in exterminating Jews and other 'undesirable' elements was one of the forces that drove so many to buy into Nazism.    BTW, read Mein Kampf. Hitler rails against godless atheists just as much as he does the Jews. Your argument is pathetic for being so mis-informed.|`|cfda9b5d078d37da24e0ff1809dee8d5aa	No.|`|kkSyz6aoaa	you mean UNalieneable, right?

Then you're saying Nazis didn't believe there were any rights at all, so how could they take any rights away?  So what should atheists believe?      That the Nazis had no right to say ANYTHING ABOUT Jews' rights!  It was none of their damn business!   But OK, you're saying since it was the gov't at the time...yes, you would say they were not given any rights by the establishment, and we knew that!  Don't make it so complicated!    Listen, saying ppls rights are alienable means you subscribe to some establishment, see?  So unless the atheist subscribles to it, which, not subscribing to God, they probably don't, then why should an atheist worry about whether some establishment's ideology should affect their views?    Sheeeeesh!|`|AA11586960	Under Himmler's atheist thinking if you denounce the fuhrer you should die     even Mohamed said in his teaching if you do not believe in me and Allah you should die Mohamed put himself equal to his chosen god     if you have no fear for your sole then all that matters to you is your opinion Hence 75 million died in WW2     we only prosecuted the few leaders to show how Moral the USA was but they let thousands Escape to south america as payment for fighting the Bolsheviks    the Nuremberg trials were a farce that is why the British held their own to finish the job    what did Eichmann say in Israel this court has no rights this country did not exist i don't recognise your authority he was tried found guilty and executed no loss to humanity and he as far as i am concerned has never payed for breathing my oxygen     all those found guilty were on some ones opinion they had commited crimes against humanity the NAZIS saw russians as animals and only to be used as slaves     But like in all wars the winners make the rules|`|cl4wdRnvaa	You couldn't make less sense if you tried.

I get the connection. It's not surprising that atheists will try to deny it. You are spot on. Your point shows the fallacy of post-modernist thinking.    The answer to your Q is No, were were right.|`|bbb941465ccc4a1ec3a57d5ff0a4b17baa	Godwin's law = you loose.  Thanks for playing.|`|s2GCKeouaa	This is a common "Christian Nation" argument -- the idea that our rights are derived from the Christian God, and without the Christian God, we would have no rights.  But this is NOT the logic of atheism -- atheism has nothing to do with this (I do not personally agree with atheism, but this is a gross mischaracterization).    The idea that our rights to Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness are inalienable is a Humanist idea -- neither Theistic, nor Atheistic.  Some of our founding fathers were strong people of faith, and some of them (Jefferson for example) were possibly Atheists -- but they were all Humanists.  Humanism is the belief that human beings deserve dignity and freedom, and that our rights are inalienable and intrinsic to being human.  Any form of totalitarianism violates the freedom of the individual, on which the United States Constitution was founded -- this includes regimes such as the Nazis, as well as attempts by Fundamentalist Christians to force their beliefs on others and deny others their rights through legislation (for example, banning gay marriage.)     Only a secular government can guarantee the rights of all people regardless of faith.|`|4qT0TfMZaa	Now, there's one of the stupidest bits of nonsense to come down the pike in a LONG time!  C'mon, you can do better...|`|e5f8b9685ec9f440ed81d5aea8e10ed0aa	You are making the assumption that Atheism is a philosophy.  Atheism is simply an understanding or declaration that there is no god.    I am an Atheist and a Humanist.  Humanism is my philosophy and I like to think it is a positive statement of my beliefs.    Humanist thought includes the ideas of individual rights as well as the betterment of society.    As a Humanist it is easy for me to believe the Nazis had to be stopped and were wrong.  Now... the details of Nuremberg are a bit trickier to decide.  Many questions arise... such as... who is really guilty?   Is it helpful to execute the guilty?  How far down the chain of command do you blame?  It is not so easy to decide.    I think it is critical for the "world" justice system to hold leaders responsible for their actions.  Often, individual soldiers are led in a false direction using threats, and terrible psychological pressure...so... it makes sense that common soldiers can be forgiven of some of their actions.    Just my read on the trial.|`|eBKJRmEgaa	Atheism is a lack of belief in a god or gods, that's all.|`|WX1b747Iaa	You're not following any logic but your own there, and it's diseased. People who commit crimes have the inalienable right to trial, not the inalienable right to get away with it. This has nothing to do with atheism, one way or another. If you don't like the Constitution, don't blame it on atheists and by all means go live someplace where you're not oppressed by it. We don't need God's authority to establish law, get over it.|`|urIm4YaBaa	You're making a leap from "lack of belief in gods" to a political stance concerning the basis of human rights.

Xsen794Aaa	Well, I don't know what you want to know because you didn't give a lot of information, but you should look up genders and cases, which are very important in German.  If you don't know what cases are, you should look up "grammatical cases" in Wikipedia and read the article.<br>  <br>  You know how "I" and "me" refer to the same person, but the words are used differently in the grammatical sense?  That difference is called a "case," and German doesn't just have two of them, it has four! Also, they don't just do it with pronouns like we do, they do it with articles and adjectives.<br>  <br>  Also, how you phrase a sentence can change the word-order.  For instance, if you say when something is going to happen, putting the indication of time at the beginning of the sentence changes were you put the verb.  There are a lot of words and situations that change the verb order in German. <br>  <br>  Also, they have things called "separating verbs," like in English, when you say "I'm going to PICK my brother UP from school," the plain form of the verb is "pick up," but in the sentence, we separate it with "my brother."  In German, they have many verbs like this, but they're a little harder to use.|`|5yRRRPsRaa	Hi.<br>  <br>  Yes, I can say a couple of useful things to have in mind while learning German:<br>  <br>  -When building up your vocabulary have in mind that German nouns have a gender --unlike English nouns-- and they have a different form for singular and plural. The best way to deal with this is learn each noun with its proper gender and plural --it is not as hard as it sounds, you'll get used to it.<br>  <br>  -In German exists a personal pronoun to respectfully adress to certain people --someone older than you, someone you're just being introduced to, someone with a higher hierarchy, like your boss. In English, you'd use "you" every time, but in German you must be careful to use the proper "you":<br>  <br>  du - informal "you"<br>  Sie - formal "you" -- always capitalized.<br>  <br>  This sounds like a pain in the ..., but turns out that using "Sie" is very easy because verbs don't take any conjugation, you use the infinitive form --so, while you're a beginner in German, you're very likely to sound very polite.<br>   :-)<br>  <br>  That's a bit I can tell you about German --I'm a beginner.<br>  <br>  Tschüss,<br>  JML.|`|oEfa2myTaa	Guten Tag!

So what does 2000 years compare to that? <br>  <br>  People that have taken Him into their hearts shall go up to heaven (wherever it is, no one shall ever know until He comes, which will be soon, although no one will ever know when) for 1000 years while Satan thinks about his faults.

Theres just too much to disprove that theory.  Evolution, million year old fossils which were carbon dated, or maybe they found the half life of some other thing.  <br>  And purity, our moon was created by an asteroid slamming into earth millions of years ago, blowing chunks of it into space, where the matter collected and formed into the moon. (theory most accepted pretty much anywhere in society.)|`|QyAyQf3Laa	The Genesis Account and Dinosaurs<br>  <br>  While the radioactive dating method is innovative, it is still based on speculation and assumption. In contrast, the Bible account in the first chapter of Genesis simply states the general order of creation. It allows for possibly thousands of millions of years for the formation of the earth and many millenniums in six creative eras, or “days,” to prepare the earth for human habitation.<br>  <br>  Some dinosaurs (and pterosaurs) may indeed have been created in the fifth era listed in Genesis, when the Bible says that God made “flying creatures” and “great sea monsters.” Perhaps other types of dinosaurs were created in the sixth epoch. The vast array of dinosaurs with their huge appetites would have been appropriate considering the abundant vegetation that evidently existed in their time.—Genesis 1:20-24.<br>  <br>  When the dinosaurs had fulfilled their purpose, God ended their life. But the Bible is silent on how he did that or when. We can be sure that dinosaurs were created by Jehovah for a purpose, even if we do not fully understand that purpose at this time. They were no mistake, no product of evolution. That they suddenly appear in the fossil record unconnected to any fossil ancestors, and also disappear without leaving connecting fossil links, is evidence against the view that such animals gradually evolved over millions of years of time. Thus, the fossil record does not support the evolution theory. Instead, it harmonizes with the Bible’s view of creative acts of God.<br>  <br>  The fossil record of the dinosaurs supports not evolution but creation.<br>  ----------------------<br>  <br>  The Dating of Dinosaurs<br>  <br>  Dinosaur bones are regularly found in lower earth layers than are human bones, leading many to conclude that they belong to an earlier time period. Geologists call this time the Mesozoic period and subdivide it into the Cretaceous, Jurassic, and Triassic periods. The time frames used for these periods are on the order of tens of millions of years. But has this been established with any certainty?<br>  <br>  One method being used to measure the age of fossils is called radiocarbon dating. This dating system measures the rate of decay of radioactive carbon from the point of death of the organism. “Once an organism dies, it no longer absorbs new carbon dioxide from its environment, and the proportion of the isotope falls off over time as it undergoes radioactive decay,” states Science and Technology Illustrated.<br>  <br>  However, there are severe problems with the system. First, when the fossil is considered to be about 50,000 years old, its level of radioactivity has fallen so low that it can be detected only with great difficulty. Second, even in more recent specimens, this level has fallen so low that it is still extremely difficult to measure accurately. Third, scientists can measure the present-day rate of radioactive carbon formation but have no way of measuring carbon concentrations in the distant past.<br>  <br>  So whether they use the radiocarbon method for dating fossils or other methods, such as employing radioactive potassium, uranium, or thorium, for dating rocks, scientists are unable to establish the original levels of those elements through ages of time. Thus, professor of metallurgy Melvin A. Cook observes: “One may only guess these concentrations [of radioactive materials], and the age results thus obtained can be no better than this guess.” <br>  <br>  That would especially be so when we consider that the Flood of Noah’s day over 4,300 years ago brought enormous changes in the atmosphere and on earth.<br>  ----------------------|`|3KD6RRhPaa	Well if Jesus was crucified about 2000 years ago, then its quite feasible.    <br>  <br>  I have scientific studies that was written before man went to the moon, and these clever world renown people made a statement based on mans theory that this world in millions of years old, therefore the dust on the moon should be about 20 feet thick. So based on this they built the moon buggy with gaint feet pads.  But once man landed on the moon, they found that the dust was only a few inches thick, debunking all mans theories.   So they again made another study based upon these new findings that the earth can only be around 6-7000 years old.<br>  <br>  But the thing is, we should rather be fulfilling our roles here on earth doing Gods righteous work instead of wasting time on worthless theories.|`|2tf60aRSaa	Makes more sense that the incredibly large population (not to mention genetic degradation) that would have resulted from being on earth living in our own refuse and effluence for MILLIONS OF YEARS.|`|ExCAedp4aa	They're fooled by the earth's plastic surgery.

The rest of the world however like India, China, Indonesia, Central and Southern Africa and the Americas, Norther Europe are all a few billion years old. It's because God placed the entire area of the Middle East inside a wormhole and that area leaped forward in time from billion years ago to today but it only took 6,000 years. God also protected the people, plants, and animals living in the other regions outside the wormhole from the Global Flood that Noah experienced...

Fasting doesn't have to be dramatic like no food for days.  Catholics fast only a few days a year and consists of one full mean and two smaller meals with no snacks in between.  You can also deny something like a favorite food, television, computer, or you can add something like doing volunteer work, sacrifice buying something and give that money to the poor.

Romans 8:5,6|`|51fe01ef6db0c1bd743afcb3e7a2e1ffaa	Prayer and fasting is defined as voluntarily going without food in order to focus on prayer and fellowship with God. Prayer and fasting often go hand in hand, but this is not always the case. You can pray without fasting, and fast without prayer. It is when these two activities are combined and dedicated to God's glory that they reach their full effectiveness. Having a dedicated time of prayer and fasting is not a way of manipulating God into doing what you desire. Rather, it is simply forcing yourself to focus and rely on God for the strength, provision, and wisdom you need.     Far too often, though, the focus of prayer and fasting is on abstaining from food. Instead, the purpose of Christian fasting should be to take our eyes off the things of this world and focus our thoughts on God. Fasting should always be limited to a set time because not eating for extended periods can be damaging to the body. Fasting is not a method of punishing our bodies and it is not be used as a "dieting method" either. We are not to spend time in prayer and fasting in order to lose weight, but rather to gain a deeper fellowship with God.     By taking our eyes off the things of this world through prayer and biblical fasting, we can focus better on Christ. Matthew 6:16-18 declares, "When you fast, do not look somber as the hypocrites do, for they disfigure their faces to show men they are fasting. I tell you the truth, they have received their reward in full. But when you fast, put oil on your head and wash your face, so that it will not be obvious to men that you are fasting, but only to your Father, who is unseen; and your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you."|`|b9MbC3Uraa	To show that you are devoted to god. The bible says that he punish all that feed on the beast. The whole world pretty much feeds on the beast now I think he'll be more lenient but those who try will be more rewarded.|`|qtXsNipdaa	Fasting is simply denying your soul. It is not a hunger strike.  It is meant to take away something that keeps you from Christ.  Instead of eating, watching tv, listening to music, etc, you spend time in prayer and seeking Him.  A fast is meant to weaken your soul so that you can strengthen your spirit.      I remember when I was younger, I would "fast" something for Lent.  The thing is, I never spent time with Jesus during that fast.  Basically all I did was skip a few meals for no reason.    Fasting is not about legalism.  There are no brownie points in heaven for fasting.  It is simply a tool to weaken your flesh (lusts, cravings, desires) so you can strengthen your spirit by spending time in prayer, praise, worship, etc.|`|Uj9cLwbpaa	It cleans out your digestive system.

Fasting allows us to do penance, and make a sacrifices that can be offered to God. When we give up something we love, it helps us remember just how much Christ gave for us.

HH90Eghaaa	Lol! Mainly because straight people feel the need to do it all the time! Actually they will tell you exactly what they are doing in behind the closed doors of their bedroom!<br>  <br>  Eg) We're trying to have a baby! Rephrase: We are having lots of unprotected sex!<br>  <br>  Eg) I'm pregnant! Rephrase: I had unprotected sex, now I'm knocked up!<br>  <br>  Eg) Its our son's 1st birthday today! Rephrase: Roughly a year ago and nine months I had sex! <br>  <br>  And the list continues! Even the State and Federal government knows what went on behind those closed doors as soon as they signed that Birth Certificate!<br>  <br>  Best part is they actually expect you to Congratulate them!<br>  <br>  Basically what I am getting at is be proud of who you are! Straights certainly are, so you can too! When you are ready come out! If you never are then don't! But just be who you are!|`|XnNT4l0Xaa	Don't "come out" if you don't want to. <br>  <br>  I did, I guess in a way. It was randomly though. I just woke up one morning and was like, "hey I think i have a crush on a girl" (no joke.) Then I started telling my friends, most of them were fine with it. If you're scared of other people's opinions, don't be. Because eventually they get used to it, or you realize that there's something about *them* that really bugs you too, and learn that they aren't worth your time. <br>  <br>  I don't get the term "closet." Because, it's not like we were born and raised in a closet and then one day, we come out of it and all of the sudden everyone knows that you're attracted to the same sex. It doesn't work like that. <br>  <br>  You don't have to be in it. You don't have to come out. Heck, you can just pretend you were never in a closet. That's what I did. And if anyone ever tells you that you're too young (however, I know nothing about your age) then ask that person when they started feeling attracted to the opposite sex. When they tell you, be like "oh, really? Well isn't that a little young?" It's weird, I know. But it turns them off. <br>  <br>  Hope I helped! Good luck.|`|MBH7xIwUaa	You don't have to confess it to the world, and if you plan on keeping what's behind closed doors behind closed doors (as in never living with another woman or going on public dates with another woman) then you don't even have to tell the people close to you. It's your business, and your business alone. Some people like to "come out", some don't. Personally I chose to "come out" because I'm a very romantic person and I would like to be able to be with a girl and not have to hide the fact that I am from everyone.|`|iwNYcerfaa	It's your decision on whether or not you want to "come out of the closet." Coming out of the closet doesn't mean you tell the entire world what you do with your significant other. It just means that you are open and accepting of other's opinions on your sexuality, But no, you do not have to "come out" if you don't want to. As for why it's referred to as a "closet." I have no idea. Beats me. I'd perfer to be in the shower, or the bedroom. I'm closterphobic, I can't stay in a closet.|`|2DahzSWvaa	You don't have to come out the closet if you don't want to. Yet, you take the risk of being outed which can be even more painful. It's up to you.|`|w6tQEuKCaa	i really dnt knw..and u dnt have to come out if u dnt want to....no they dnt need to knw your business..wat u do is wat u do..its not any of there business|`|br9l9yiqaa	Well, in my house a closet is for hiding things.<br>  If you're not ready to expose everything then the closet <br>  will hide whatever you want it to.<br>  <br>  You don't have to confess or show anything you don't want to.<br>  But, most of the time you want to. I know I did. I wanted everyone<br>  to know that I was with my girlfriend. She is amazing and I love her<br>  and I didn't want to hide her. <br>  <br>  I don't tell them however that we have wild animal sex... lol ... but we do! <br>  <br>  Oh and btw, whoever said you need to go and confess to a priest behind closed doors... You honestly need to stop with the religious crap. I understand that you don't agree. But if you don't then don't read in a Gay and Lesbian category! Plain and simple! ... and last time I checked that wasn't the best way to witness! But hey, ignorance is bliss right?|`|d0WaYTeGaa	Not at all! If you are comfortable with yourself, that's all that matters. If you don't want others to know that's fine. As long as you're true to yourself and you're not hurting anyone, then do as you will. Be happy!|`|uHUyAzGnaa	Hahahahah this is such a funny question, because its so true!!!<br>  <br>  Who came up with this closet thing..and what if you dont consider yourself to have ever been hiding in the closet...<br>  <br>  sorry this isnt much of an answer.. but i love the Q lol..<br>  <br>  Astyn A - your answer is my fav!|`|QXcbS8C1aa	the cookie monster created the closet!<br>  no, stay it, it doesn't matter.|`|UdsG8v0naa	mins she isn't in the closet she admits to being a lesbian that has cheated all the time|`|WWxgSz7taa	Probably heterosexual men.

Some Americans may hate us, but not all of them do. I know what you mean about movies and tv shows hating on us, it's starting to get annoying.|`|C53stbyFaa	I think that Liberal Canadians actually have more hate for Americans|`|z15RhXfjaa	No they are just jealous, as just like us in England you have a free health system etc|`|FROVo8WWaa	i'm 39 yrs old and an american, and i've never met an american that hates canadians! i've always considered canadians our friends up north|`|bc1cdc0543b28607a5324cf5017d42daaa	I don't know any Canadians but from what I heard Canadians are nice people and their society is more acceptable with race.

But when a woman is promiscuous...|`|ErN3pbTeaa	To be a woman is so much more freeing than it is to be a guy in our society. <br>  Men have stricter guidelines to what they can and can't do.... <br>  This goes back to the fact that masculine traits are preferred over feminine, and there shouldn't be any deviance in boys toward non masculine traits.. We are socialized to think this way.<br>  <br>  Ok: Tom Boy Girls.           Bad: Sissy Boys<br>  Ok: Makeup on girls .       Bad/weird: Makeup on boys<br>  Ok: Girls in sports.

But if a guy is a virgin, there is something wrong with him. And evidently girls who are bisexual, are supposedly hot in the male mind, but guy who are, it is just horrible and etc.|`|mHl8OTlWaa	I suggest you take your misogyny elsewhere.|`|iwNYcerfaa	Because women ROCK!!!|`|kHLwlNA5aa	Yea, very good points you made!|`|BVjXzfG3aa	God I hate questions like these.<br>  <br>  <br>  It's definitely STILL a man's world.....<br>  <br>  But if 1 thing goes against them they all go crying about how unfair it is.<br>  <br>  GET REAL!<br>  <br>  <br>  Crusty is right, this is MISOGYNY.

I mean if we're really that privileged and a genie could instantly change you permanently into a woman, you'd do it right?<br>  <br>  No?

NAL9SZuXaa	nope...i think that if everyone was taught to have pride in themselves and accept others for their differences, things would be fine....<br>  <br>  because if everyone is mixed, people will STILL look different eventually...like, the mixed black/japanese could be discriminative towards mixed hispanic/caucasian...or even two "mulatto" people like halle or obama could treat eachother differently based on hair or skin differences (or feature differences)<br>  <br>  therefore, we need to be happy with what we have and accept others for what they have to bring to the table (which is a very optimistic view)|`|a0ea30926acdfeb82a6d6f9ca13bcc69aa	There have been many countries where the peoples were mostly one race.  There was still prejudice.  There are other reasons like religion, political beliefs, and individual family heritage.<br>  <br>  I like the diversity and think that the world would be much less interesting if everyone was homogenized.|`|OLL9Cdbtaa	No, the world will still have other problems racism just wouldn't be one of them.

l2qtG4yfaa	Back from slave times--the crack of the whip...So they called the people who cracked them with whips crackers (and the ones who cracked the whips were white).<br>  That is how it developed.<br>  And Pinky is just a troll, you should not pay attention to her lol.|`|4Vmlf902aa	Oh, Pinky. I thought she was from Africa. Well I think that word was first used for the snacks saltine crackers, or something like that. Then someone thought it was funny to start calling white people that (Pinky), I guess.<br>  <br>  Reminds me of the Quakers, and Quaker oatmeal.|`|2tn8EALqaa	If you are English, why are you worried about it. "RUDE" as the N word. The N word has a long history behind it. "Cracker" does not.<br>  <br>  That's like comparing the B word with poopy head.<br>  <br>  Also, pinky is not a black person. She is one of the typical white people who pretend to be black on Yahoo ANswers and have gullible idiots riled up.|`|AA10232076	lmao!! yeah I love pinky she cracks me up because the things she says just shouldn't be taken seriously!

EayLdDkWaa	Wish I had an answer for you... but thought I'd leave a note to say good luck. I'll be rooting for you. Couldn't the baby's father or another relative help you with the child?     My bf's mum always wanted to be a nurse but couldn't do study and raise him at the same time (his parents divorced), so she's doing it now, at age 45! don't worry... you have many happy years ahead of you. Focus on saving money for your beautiful child's education so that this doesn't happen to him/her.|`|f21c4568248ded0eeab01a76d3a81476aa	Well you have a child to mother now, so that should be your main focus.  You need to get any job you can to feed your baby, all that dream job stuff has to take a back seat.  This is what happens when you have a baby.|`|hrFGKAeraa	you can always take online college classes, apply for Fin. Aid, get your AS in nursing, that way you're in the hospital and you'll have a job. because you'll be in the hospital with some experiance you'll be able to reapply for the program. but this is all IF you don't get in. don't be so negative, think positive thoughts.|`|9b25119676cb60c00708b15f0c12ac6eaa	I know how you feel about life passing by. The first advice I can give you is set goals, and take each day one day at a time. I also would recommend the military, because they provide training in the radiology field. You'll get the training, experience and housing, so at least you know you and your baby will be taken cared of. Good Luck.

It is panties for me, panties that do not show!|`|uuQrhnJ4aa	The crazy thing was I was in the hospital when I first got mine & they brought out the whole contraption. That blew my mind because this was a technologically advanced hospital & they had these things when the self-adhesive ones were already on the market & widely used (this was the 70s). I was thinking, Dang, I've got regular peel & stick pads at home... It still makes no sense why the hospital had the 'other version'. My mom went to a local store & bought some regular ones for me, lol. The older contraption was a real hassle.<br>  <br>  As for the thongs, the ones w/decorative things showing above the back of the jeans don't bother me too much. I don't care for the strings on either side of the hips pulled up, tho. I'm just not a thong person. I try to get underwear out of there...don't know why they made it to specifically fit in there...they're too uncomfortable for me.<br>  <br>  Back in the 70s I like hip-huggers, but the extremely low rise jeans...I'm not a big fan.

I worked in a college dorm for a few years, it embarrassed me to see that when they bent down to pick up something, and yes I guess it reminded me of napkin belts.|`|X3Lp0ewMaa	OMG I had forgotten about those hideous things. My grandmother bought me the first one I ever owned and she said "She's is a Young  Lady now" and needs these things. NOT!! I hated them. The young ladies of today have it easy compared to us. Lord knows I pinned them, and wore the sanitary panties to and nothing worked. Maybe that's why I never wore thong under wear. Thanks for that memory LOL.|`|FYvCR8mvaa	Ha ha ha.  Those were the days....NOT.  I remember when they came out with a big "breakthrough" and sold underpants with just the clip things attached front and back.

I was too shy to do it when I was young and COULD!<br>  <br>  If I tried to strut now, I'm afraid I'd break something.|`|W8bs2VQSaa	Oh yes, what horrible memories that brings back !

I don't think I could wear a thong. I'd feel like my panties had been torn in half.  Thank goodness I can wear my "granny panties" as my grands call them.  The best thing is we survived those old contraptions. Thanks for the smile|`|nwnILcEAaa	Yes, I remember being so horrified that with technology as far along as it was, that women were still using something so primitive.

Hr2tnZtqaa	When  you  are in  a relationship  as you  describe very often you close yourself off to others. You are secretive. You stay away from others and disconnect yourself from family and friends. In order to get over something like this you are going to need some support of others and open up to what has been going on in order to heal. I think what she is saying  is that you will not be alone anymore. You need to  make connections. My best to  you and congraulations for  getting out of it.|`|VxozKUcCaa	communication first, physical attraction later.  Establish a base of communication before allowing any relationship to get physical in any way.  I know you want to make sure he likes the way your look physically but be patient and allow for a natural progression.  Your anxiety is what is making you move yourself (and him) too fast.  They are getting abusive only after they are getting defensive, if they cannot become comfortable around you they will react with fear.  The fear that you are feeling now, well you made them feel that way to.

VUK77SrXaa	The least thing that you have control of in your body is your autonomic reactions.  Sexual arousal is one of those autonomic reactions.  If you are aroused by gay porn, then at the very lowest level you are gay.  If you can't emotionally respond to men, that is probably your fears or your denial... but without a doubt you are gay.    BTW, leave your brother alone, he has his own issues / problems, and your problems won't help him work those out.|`|576e76ca46b6c4293f45926a8e75773caa	I've seen this question before.

If you try to interfere, his defenses will go up, and it will make it that much harder for him.|`|cpQU51teaa	better leave him alone.|`|e0lfV7skaa	Leave him alone; you'll just embarrass him.    And while you may not think you're gay/bi because you don't WANT an emotional attachment, you still are.  Your upbringing keeps you from being who you really are.      Too bad, too.  You'll go through lots of turmoil pretending to be straight.  Let's hope your little brother gets it right.|`|52VDjbNTaa	Leave it.  If he wants to come out of the closet, he will in his own time.  If he's not gay, then he won't.  But I'm sure he'll be hurt that you were looking through his history.  Don't let him know, he'll be ok.
cNFcb5Ekaa	i guess it is because of the manner the word is used in. most of the time, when someone calls another person a c*ck sucker, its soul purpose is to offend said person.

Because "c0*k" is a derogatory word putting it with sucker makes the whole phrase derogatory. In the wrong tone, it's pretty much a synonym for "fag*ot" (not sure if that's bad on here...lol) and we don't appreciate it.

When I enrolled in a British uni, I was asked what "ethnic group" I considered myself to belong to (we don't get asked this kind of stuff in our school and uni applications!) - and at age 23, for the first time, I found myself thinking about the topic. I decided to go for "caucasian", basing on my phisical traits and all. Maybe the girl you know is from south of Italy, is one of those people with olive skin and dark hair, and prefers to be considered latino (which sounds very exotic and sexy, much more than "white")? Just a guess.  However, all in all I agree with you. Italians are indeed white, and most of the people I know would define themselves as such. Not that we think about it a lot, though.|`|NsFaPI9waa	Yes Italy is is in the southern region of Europe.

And each of those types have specific looks.  However most Europeans are a mix of at least two of those.  But they are all classed as white and are all European.    Also white does not mean pale, there is a range of skin colours which goes from pale to olive.      I'm from Europe and I consider all southern Europeans to be white.    If being white just meant the pale Europeans then my English friend apparently isn't white because he is naturally tanned? lol    Maybe some Italians think like that but I doubt many of them do.

You consider "white" people as caucasians, explain to her what's that. I tend to see more differences between races here (I'm from Romania) and I couldn't call all Europeans "white". But generally and genetically speaking, you're right, we're all white comparing to other races.

That's why the world's going to end in 1984 - oops, I mean 1999 - oops, I mean 2000 - oops, I mean 2012.|`|AA11282654	Because it's always been so and times are bad right now so there is a lot of fuel for the fire.

One needs to consider that it is written that these prophesies will occur within a relatively short common era of time thus compounding their validity.  Additionally, things are prophesied that ancient peoples wouldn't even have thought of or would have any way of knowing.  Below is short list of the end times prophesies;    * That mankind would greatly increase in knowledge in the last days.    * That mankind would travel to and fro far more in the last days.    * That the Jews would re-establish their homeland in the last days(Israel reformed in 1948).    * That man kinds 'chariots' would rush to and fro along the broad ways and be self illuminated and travel like lightning.    * That there would be increased natural disasters in diverse places.    * That there would be famines.    * That the Jews would again speak a common language (the Jews now speak the long dead Hebrew language).    * That Christianity would be spread to the ends of the earth.    * That there will be great distress at the end, unequaled from the beginning of the world until nowand never to be equaled again.    * The existence of a 200 million man army(China attained this capability in the 1960s).    * The Jews rebuilding of the Temple of God.  The specific piece of ground needed is called "The Dome of the Rock" and is currently held by the Muslims.    * A red Heifer (cow) must be used in the purification in the end times.  The first red Heifer born in 2,000 years was born on 1997 and another in 2004 in Israel.    * The return of the Ethiopian Jews to Israel was prophesied in Zephaniah 3:10.   Between 1984 and 1999 some 38,000 and the last of the Ethiopian Jews were airlifted to Israel.    *  That all nations of the world would have instant and live communication as they will see certain events in real time the world over.    * That the nature of people will change for the worse.  They will be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents,      unthankful,  unholy,  without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God.     Again, the important thing to note is that these things will all happen in a common era.   It is very easy to recognize the above events and their relatively recent connection to one another.  There are things prophesied that simply weren't knowable at the time that they were written.|`|4LYasBGXaa	because people are idiots.    they are taking blurbs of what they hear about the year 2012 and out of base ignorance (and seeing what they want to see) not understanding where the number comes from- the historical context it appears in.    the 2012 number is the END OF THE MAYAN LONG CALANDAR-    NOTHING MORE, NOTHING LESS.    it is what the MAYANS believed- not christians who destroyed thier culuture and holy books- not muslims, not jews, not wiccans, not deists, not buddists but MAYANS.    the long calandar- and this long calandar was not the first to end.      what TO THEM it does represent is change- a change of an era (which happened before with prior long calandars), this can be good or bad- however we do not know if the mayans believed this particular event at this time would have been a "cataclysm" or "doomsday" or simply a change of some kind or even a mere solar phenomenon.    we don't know this becasue the mayan historical books an interpretations were destroyed- and thus incomplete.    people see the 2012 year as a "doomsday" because that is what they want to see- not because there is any actual basis for it or speculation- if one was well versed in mayan history, mayan culture and mayan beliefs- one could make an argument that they believed it was a doomsday event- but there is just as much basis to argue that it was not and merely a change, or a solar phenomenon that they expected to happen.  again- we don't have thier writings complete enough to be sure.    conspiracies and conspiracy theories sell so thats also another factor.    EDIT:    as for your child- i strongly urge you to educate yourself about the subject and watch some documentaries with him about mayan culture and beliefs (that you pre-viewed since some might be more complex than he can understand) to calm him down and educate him.  if he is the type to read it in books that would be better, but odds are a 90 min film will captivate him more than a 400page detailed description.|`|i48kxrbaaa	Just something to occupy the minds of those who have nothing else to worry about.|`|v7G1dmgXaa	It's a misunderstanding of natural events that happen at regular intervals, when all of our planets in this solar system align in a Straight line.

Hint: We are still here!|`|87ipHi8baa	2012 is when the Aztec calender ends, I think.

The word of God does give us a hint. We have tried to pinpoint a date but to no avail and Jesus himself did not know. Only the Father in heaven knows. The important thing is to be ready when that time comes.The word of God is this; in the last days the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be brought to ruin. And the kingdom itself will not be passed on to any other people. It will crush and put an end to all these kingdoms, and it itself will stand to times indefinite.|`|k5zvA1X9aa	It's the global hippie conspiracy.

Now as far as the kind of women YOU'RE looking for...my guess is that it all starts with A JOB! Most women will ask you first thing about what you do for a living. If you're answer is that you're unemployed, my guess is that the conversation will pretty much be over. Good looks, good body, great personality, really good in bed...that will get you a ways. But not that far if you have to say that you're "growing your career" or "you're in between jobs."|`|nuCXcLUIaa	The women here?  A woman.

Great movie btw. That's what it sounds like to me though. Sorry, if you find this rude.|`|aW5uShwtaa	Go for it.|`|d0WaYTeGaa	Dreams can mean a lot of things. Sometimes they show you what you want to see, sometimes they show you the opposite of what will happen, and sometimes they simply show you a mixture of images produced by your conscience and sub-conscience. Based on the events in your dream, and your meeting with this guy in real life, I say go for it, but remember: Nobody likes a push-over. Start small, work your way up, and most importantly don't get yourself in trouble. Who knows, if all the predictions about the end of the world are false, you may be the first gay president.<br>  <br>  ~~Just a note. If the relationship goes south in real life, then perhaps you should abandon the path you took in the dream.

d0WaYTeGaa	Though it is important to be up front with your girlfriend, and it is even more important to be true to yourself, what would be the point in telling her? If you only want to be with her, then being bisexual doesn't change that. It's not like being bi gives you the right to have a girlfriend and boyfriend at the same time. That being said, I do honestly believe a relationship built on a lie is a relationship doomed.|`|qOZashBYaa	Its not easy to tell someone that. I had to tell my best friend who was super super religious, and she accepted it as soon as I told her.

AA11440601	Praying can never make things worse.   At worst, nothing will happen.   At best, things get better.    Prayer is the elevation of the mind and heart to God:  + In praise of his glory  + In petition for some desired good  + In thanksgiving for a good received  + In intercession for others before God    Through prayer the Christian experiences a communion with God through Christ in the Church.    "For me, prayer is a surge of the heart; it is a simple look turned toward heaven, it is a cry of recognition and of love, embracing both trial and joy." (St. Thrse of Lisieux)    "Prayer is the raising of one's mind and heart to God or the requesting of good things from God." (St. John Damascene)     But when we pray, do we speak from the height of our pride and will, or "out of the depths" of a humble and contrite heart? (Psalm 130:1)     He who humbles himself will be exalted; humility is the foundation of prayer. Only when we humbly acknowledge that "we do not know how to pray as we ought," are we ready to receive freely the gift of prayer.     For more information, see the Catechism of the Catholic Church, part four: http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt4s...    Some basic Catholic prayers can be found at:  http://www.ewtn.com/Devotionals/prayers/...  http://www.churchyear.net/basicprayers.h...    Daily prayer site: http://www.sacredspace.ie/    With love in Christ.|`|89MKzLl3aa	What are you praying to if you don't believe in God? If you're a nonbeliever, write in a journal. Express your thoughts that way. If you're a nonbeliever, I would think that you'd feel silly praying.|`|N8Im0nQLaa	That sounds more like a self meditation if you don't believe in god.|`|bxYWJAYNaa	I think thats just called talking to yourself . . . um, a sign of madness?|`|pd5LkFWoaa	Hebrews 11:6   And without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him.|`|NYGDQ3ezaa	Faith in God is a gift from God. God can hear all, He know all, and is all-wise. This is the God of the Bible, the Creator of the universe.  He is eternal, holy, perfect, love. If you are seeking God, you can pray for the faith to believe in God, preferably by praying with a Christian. If you are sincere and seeking, you will be blessed.|`|MpcZb1Jhaa	the essence of praying is meditating, and the essence of meditation is prayer.    prayer is not asking for something you lack, although that may come into it.    praying is a time you give to yourself to just think and be a t peace with yourself, the world and G-d. this holds true for meditating as well.    so whatever you do praying meditating - its good and its healthy!

It isn't just Atheism they have a bug up their butt about, it is anybody different than them. If us Atheists aren't around, they'll hate on Muslims.

eb4e977a0cb9ce50b08bf74f0f3a0c61aa	Here is truth - read and understand. <br>  1. Vampires, defined as a humanoid being that MUST consume blood or energy to survive do not exist. Cut and paste time, as it is too much work to type this out over and over and I "recycle" my own answers instead of retyping them so here goes. A brief discussion of the human digestive system and then the probable vampire population given an exponential growth rate should explain why vampires are not possible. <br>  <br>  2. The human body is not designed to process large amounts of blood for nutrition. There is not enough protein, carbohydrates, and fats present in blood to maintain a complex creature such as Homo Sapiens or any theorized offshoot mutations. When a human ingests food it is first broken up into a bolus by chewing, then churned up in the stomach with digestive juices to form a mass called chyme. It then passes through the pylorus into the duodenum, part of the small intestine where it mixes with bile salts and secretions from the pancreas and liver which continue breaking it down on a molecular basis, mostly affecting fats at this point. The broken down nutrients pass through the wall of the intestines and into the bloodstream where they are carried to each cell or stored for later use. Indigestible bulk continues through the intestines, turning a dark brown from the bile. Water is absorbed from this mass in the large intestine depending on the needs of the body - a well-hydrated person will usually have a softer stool than a dehydrated person will. Water also enters the bloodstream, and this is what helps to maintain blood pressure. The pressure tends to balance itself in a healthy person because the bloodstream goes through a formation in the kidney called the Loop of Henle, where the narrowing blood vessel forces excess water and cellular waste such as urea out through the cellular wall into the kidneys, where it is excreted through the ureters into the bladder, and then out of the body via the urethral passageway.<br>  <br>  3. IMPORTANT - A person physically unable to process his own food for nutrition therefore also could not process blood - it's the same process. Ingested blood does not transmit directly to the veins anyway - it would be chemically broken down by the digestive system.<br>  <br>  4. Theoretical ingestion of blood to supply these nutrients would therefore have to occur at least once a day, and would require the ingestion of the entire blood supply which could not happen as the stomach is far too small to hold that much liquid volume. Hold up your clenched fist - under normal conditions your stomach is about that size. Furthermore, such a mass would be difficult to pass thru the intestines as it has no fibrous bulk, would create an intestinal impaction, causing massive vomiting from the large concentration of iron present, and any "real" vampire would have to eventually expel the waste, which would come out as a black, tarry, smelly goo, just as stool does when blood is present from a upper GI bleed. <br>  <br>  5. These humans that affect the whole "vampiric lifestyle" are NOT vampires. They are simply humans playing their own little game, in their own little fantasy world, usually pandering to their own little sexual fetish, which may or may not actually be sexual. I too, play my own little game, in the SCA, but mine is a game where the deeds that I do are determined by the strength of my arm and sword - I am a warrior, with just as much skill and ability as any warrior of ancient times. The difference is that I am claiming to be something physically possible: a warrior, and I prove it everytime I strap on my armor and walk onto a SCA battlefield. The so-called "vampires" are claiming to be something physically impossible: a walking corpse, and all they prove is that black Victorian clothing, a pair of false fangs, and a little makeup make for a good Halloween costume - it does not make you a vampire.<br>  <br>  6. Even if a vampire feeds once a week, and his victim also becomes a vampire, that is exponential growth, with four iterations a month. First iteration: One makes one, total two. Second iteration: Two make two, total four. Third iteration: Four make four, total eight. Fourth iteration: Eight make eight, total sixteen. 16 vampires at the end of one month, 256 at the end of the second month, 4096 by the end of the third month, 65,536 by the end of the fourth month, 1,048,476 at the end of the fifth, and 33,572,832 vampires at the end of half a year! By way of comparison, there are currently approximately 33 million people who have HIV/AIDS in the U.S. alone, and the disease is a world-wide epidemic. I see people every day in the hospital with AIDS, but never has there been one documented case of a vampire attack. Do the math - vampires are a mathematical impossibility. As for the idea that vampires existed "a long time ago" consider the estimated global population 5,000 years ago - using the above mathematical rationale, a single vampire converted every human on the globe in less than two years. This falls therefore, under the logic of Occam's Razor - which states that when you have removed every impossible answer, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth. Since there is no "vampiric plague" swarming the earth, the logical deduction is that they don't exist.<br>  <br>  7. Point of clarification about "vampire" bats: vampire is simply the name we have given them because they do drink blood, same as a flea, mosquito, leech, or spider. Are these creatures vampires? No. They are living creatures, not legendary monsters. They can subsist on blood because of their smaller size and proportionately larger stomach volume. Drinking blood does not make you a vampire anymore than eating raw meat makes you a werewolf, although it might make you a mosquito.<br>  <br>  8.The humans who profess to be vampires are victims of an all-encompassing self induced delusion. They are as human as you or I, regardless of their claims, and if they ingest HIV tainted blood they can most certainly contract the disease, esp. if they have any cuts, sores, or lesions in and or around their mouth. It is a very dangerous delusion to be laboring under. Note that there is absolutely no scientific or medical proof that these people derive any benefit at all from the ingestion of blood, and even worse are the so-called "psychic" vampires, because their delusion is one that they cannot substantiate with any concrete evidence at all.<br>  <br>  9. There is no "vampire" gene. People are not "born" as vampires. When a woman goes to the hospital for prenatal care there are many tests done on mother and child, even while still in the womb, to check for many things, including genetic anomalies that result in deformities and birth defects. If such a gene existed, in today's world with today's technology it would have been found - we have already completely sequenced the human genome. It would also have to follow Mendel's law of dominant/recessive gene theory. Again, the odds on that many "vampires" all escaping the notice of the medical/scientific community are so low as to be almost nonexistent. The idea that there is a global "vampire community" engaging in controlled breeding to keep the "bloodline pure" is delusional in the extreme.<br>  <br>  10. There is no "vampire virus" - as I have already pointed out, HIV is a virus, and look at how fast it has spread - virtually everyone knows someone with the affliction. According to the "vampire websites" there are "thousands" of vampires running around. If that was so then at least one of them has ended up in a hospital for bloodwork when they became pregnant, had a bloodborne infection, was injured in a car wreck, etc, etc, ad nauseum. The anomaly would have been detected and medical science would have isolated it, studied it, applied for research grants on it, published papers on it, and turned it into the talk of the medical and scientific community, as well as making its "discoverers" celebrities and rich beyond their dreams. A virus cannot alter your DNA in such a radical fashion without killing you.|`|T7SBu63Aaa	too much twilight???|`|Cdp02p0Xaa	Find Edward. if you find him call me. lol|`|vUFICF6oaa	Sorry but you have to be born one but If you have these characteristics like I do then you are,<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  <br>  The sole purpose of this page is to help you figure out if you are a real vampire or not. This is to be used with the spotting a real vampire page on this site, after all if you don't spot yourself as a real vampire then you aren't a real vampire. All of the traits below are accurate for at least 95% of the real vampire population most are 100%. and assuming that you are a real vampire, the fact that they are accurate for you may shock you (those are the ones that I am saying are 95% to eliminate the chance of ruling a real vampire out that they may not be accurate for.) If you are convinced that you are a real vampire, yet have few to none of these traits you really need to read up on a term that is known as enabling and stop claiming to be one. or you could even seem to have all of them and still there is no guarantee that you are a real vampire.<br>  <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  "I didn't draw blood at first, but I did get an overwhelming feeling"<br>  <br>  If you can relate to that quote don't waste your time reading any farther, because you are definitely not a real vampire. <br>  <br>  1. Do you have unusually white skin? If yes then cook up one or two (depending on size) medium rare steaks (the best way to do this) if by the time your done enjoying the second one you have a new pinkish color through out your body that you havent had in awhile read no farther you are a real vampire. (humans cant digest blood let alone get color from it, real vampires do. However the extra work involved in trying to eat medium rare or rare meat can cause a temporary pink color to the skin which is otherwise known as being flushed. Temporarily being flushed is not the color that is being referred to when a vampire gets color from the blood in the steak. takes a lot less human blood then animal blood to get the same effect but animal blood is way easier to get.) if you were white before and still are see a doctor. Odds are you aren't a real vampire, your just malnourished, they can help.<br>  <br>  2.Have you been told by professionals that your lucky that you survived a few things that you survived with pretty much just a scratch or a cut? <br>  <br>  <br>  3. Are you a naturally strong magic/energy user self taught, self realized? <br>  <br>  4. As a kid were you the strongest, smartest, or quickest kid in the class. and around 16 years of age maybe all 3? <br>  <br>  5. Did your dad disappear from your life while you were at a young age? (note 52% of vampires out of a large range of vampires have said yes to this, that includes people who believe they are real vampires however may not really be one.) Click for one theory on how this is vampire related, truth about the ''Vampire Community'' or Click here to give a response.<br>  <br>  6. Do people often tell you that you look very young for your age, or that they would have never guessed how old you are? <br>  <br>  7. Are you extremely energetic at night time but seemingly around the time the sun comes up you get really tired? <br>  <br>  8. Are you a slightly quicker healer than most, if not a much quicker healer? <br>  <br>  9. Do you have an unusually high tolerance to alcohol and other poisons/toxins? <br>  <br>  10. Do you tend to switch between very social and antisocial frequently? <br>  <br>  11. Do you rarely get sick, or when you get sick does your body recover quicker than most people? <br>  <br>  12. Are your six senses more enhanced than most other peoples, i.e. vision, hearing, touch, smell, taste, and intuition? <br>  <br>  13. Do you have extremely good vision in the dark, how many times has some one said its to dark they cant see while you were doing something like reading? <br>  <br>  14. Do you tend to not be surprised or scared by the typical sudden loud noise in a movie or things like that because you sensed it coming. <br>  <br>  15. Do you tend to react to things like catching a falling object or other normally unexpected things at an almost psychic speed? (as if you were expecting it to happen). <br>  <br>  16. Do you tend to get a high from human blood, when drinking someones blood do you tend to find yourself being able to do something that they could do (that you couldn't do) about 2 weeks after drinking it? <br>  <br>  <br>  17. Are you sensitive to light or the heat from it (ranging from getting a bad glare to burning very easily)?<br>  <br>  18. If while your skin is white from lack of enough blood in you, do you bleed quite noticeably less than a person normally should, or more likely not bleed at all?<br>  <br>  19. Are your nails clear like glass, yet very strong?<br>  <br>  20. Is you'r bedroom the coldest and darkest room in the house? <br>  <br>  21.

Because IQ has been found to have no valid bearing on the successful outcome of anything.  Also, it's a common myth (you would be one example) that IQ determines how "smart" someone is.

This is not conducive to following a set of mandates because an ancient doctrine orders it. When closely examined scripture is considered in historical and cultural context. Studying church history and the Bible are what made me question a lot of things about my faith.<br>  <br>  Conversely, those who don't like to think a lot are drawn to organizations w/ a straightforward set of rules to follow.

So they have been found to be.  I Q tests are very weighted.  It has been my experience that those who wish to be exalted for their great intelligence could very easily be insulted to actually discover that a God who knows all made their brain.  This information offends the very thought that they desperately cling to for their value that they have mental superiority in the universe.  And if their IQ's are indeed remarkable, meaning they have a remarkable capacity to learn, why can they not understand the basic fact that they were created?  If the very simple can accept and understand that there is a God, then where have the mensa people gone wrong?  Have you heard of a mental block where some people just can not seem to understand something? This is a sad, sad state. Maybe they need more B12 to cause the blood brain interaction to again flow freely.

Follow a dogma. So they apply this philosophy to every aspect of thier lives when they grow older. They don't ask question, they are not too interested to learn or even consider "non-God" stuff (if theyre REALLY religious), and/or they don't use critical thinking or analysis. (this is just a generalization, doesnt mean every religious person is like this)<br>  <br>  Although it is true that correlation isnt always causation. But you have to keep in mind that is only the case when the events happen independently from each other. So for instance the link that was posted in one of the answers showed average temp of earth vs the amount of pirates in the world. This is a correlation that is not a causation because the events occurred independently. However, the events from the IQ poll thingy did not occur independently. Both religious ppl and atheists took the same test and its too much coincidence for all those religious ppl to be having a bad day and all the atheists to be having a good one (IQ wise)|`|NvrVjOhBaa	Anyone on here who proposes that their IQ is above 130 is likely lying. 95% of the population has an IQ less than 130, and the chance that we are speaking to the 5% of those people here on Yahoo Answers is even less probable.<br>  <br>  So, unless you took the IQ test through an official IQ proctor (which are even harder to find now) your IQ score is incorrect and inflated. Again, less than 5% folks. And 145+ is less than .1%.<br>  <br>  Also, Mensa does not take a stance on IQ and religious belief, political belief, race, etc. So I'm not sure what study you're referring to.|`|sw08ARSZaa	The higher ones IQ the more likely they are to be more educated.

But the ones with high IQs, would be more likely to not trust in God simply because they are more self-sufficient and have the idea that they can get along fine without God's guidance and help, so they don't even look into it and find out whether this is true or not.  <br>  <br>  It's pride that keeps us from God, and this has nothing to do with smartness except that smart people are more likely to have pride.

I highly doubt it was a random selection.  That would be extremely expensive.  A random selection and testing of 100,000 people to receive a genuine intelligence test would cost millions of dollars.   Most likely,  the participants were "self-selected".  That means they were all people who wanted to join Mensa.<br>  <br>  People who want to be recognized for their personal innate greatness - which is what Mensa provides to people,  is not the normal population of people who are religious.

In fact,  I would suggest that the data suggest people who are religious but still cling to notions of their personal greatness might be of relatively low intelligence.  <br>  <br>  Data analysis and the application of the results of such analyses are highly complicated and require specific education - regardless of intellect.<br>  <br>  Peace be with You - and with everyone, regardless of IQ.|`|5ydqCVE2aa	Just remember that correlation doesn't always equal causality.

YES IF YOU'RE NOT READY FOR KIDS YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE SEX.  PERIOD.  But not all people think that way and many people that do have sex at a young age and get pregnant face the situation of...I'm suffering from poverty, I'm depending on food stamps to eat, I'm working a minimum wage job, I can't afford college...and financial aid will only pay a fraction of the cost, me and the fathers baby are at disagreements and constantly fighting since the pregnancy, who knows how long we will last......when it comes down to a situation like that I can understand why a women would have an abortion.<br>    Yes she's going be criticized by society for having an abortion but she'd also be criticized if she had the baby by people making comments such as....I'm supporting her baby with my tax dollars and other ignorant things like that.  Not to mention the percent of imprisoned teens that came from young mothers with no fathers.  It occasional that a child grows up with no father and makes it through hs and college with no criminal record.  It is rare that a child from a young struggling mother makes it through HS alone with no criminal record.  Governmental assistance doesn't do any justice, it aids but it doesn't solve problems.

DIj072Sqaa	The Rainbow flag or Pride flag of the LGBT community (also known as the gay pride flag) is a symbol of LGBT pride and LGBT social movements in use since the 1970s. The colors reflect the diversity of the LGBT community, and the flag is often used as a symbol of gay pride in LGBT rights marches. It originated in the United States, but is now used worldwide. Designed by San Francisco artist Gilbert Baker in 1978, the design has undergone several revisions. As of 2008, the most common variant consists of six stripes, with the colors red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet. The flag is commonly flown horizontally, with the red stripe on top, as the colors would appear in a natural rainbow.<br>  <br>  Historically the colours mean:<br>  <br>  hot pink: sexuality<br>  red: life<br>  orange: healing<br>  yellow: sunlight<br>  green: nature<br>  turquoise: magic/art<br>  indigo: serenity/harmony<br>  violet: spirit|`|Vu726Q18aa	rainbow=happy<br>  which means gay so rainbow stand for it|`|R4EYPeLGaa	lmao.

In response to the request of the committee organizing the San Francisco Gay and Lesbian Freedom Day Parade for a symbol that could be used year after year, Baker created a rainbow flag with horizontal stripes of different colors. After two huge rainbow flags were flown at the parade that year, the symbol gained immediate popularity in the San Francisco gay community. In 1986 the rainbow flag was recognized as an official flag by the International Flag Association.|`|MBH7xIwUaa	Rainbows mean it just rained and the sun's light is reflecting off the water.

They want to have a baby so they can have someone who "loves them unconditionally" who is there "for them alone, and to love them alone" that is wrong, wrong wrong. For one, your having a Child, for a selfish reason. Children should Never be brought into the world for a selfish reasons. Second, your using the child. Your using that human being. Third, if You aren't complete, no one, no one can make you complete, if you don't love yourself, no amount of love will make you love yourself. And children pick up on that, children who have parents who hate themselves learn to hate themselves, an they learn to hate their parents. If you think you're a piece of crap, what's to stop your kid from seeing you as one? And lastly, you can't love someone else if you don't love yourself. She can't give the kids the love they deserve. In fact, she expects Them to love her, she wants Babies to take the place of absent parents in her childhood, she's trying to revert back to a childlike state, an have the babies be the unconditional, loving parents.

Any failure on her part to provide for them will result in the same consequences as it would for any other parent.|`|s8LBzzqZaa	I think she is blown way out of porportion.

That woman who's had 17 [SEVENTEEN] kids and her older children are basically doing all the work and they all pretty much take care of everything while the mom just lays back and squeezes out more kids for profit from TLC. That's what I think is BULL. At least the "Octomom" was REALLY having the 8 kids because she wanted kids, not because a tv network was providing everything for her.<br>  She had money for the invetro, she has money to take care of herself and kids. It's a shame, everyone cares when a single mom has more than half a child, when a 2 parents have 17 kids who do all the ******' work, not a word is uttered. There is something wrong with that.

CSWNU2REaa	The girl you told betrayed your trust.  Let her know that.  Seventh grade is earlyy to be coming out.  Most other students won't yet have reached a level of maturity that would enable them to deal with it as an adult would.  <br>  <br>  These days being out is much different.  People, even younger people, are more accepting than when I was your age.  Know a few things - the school has an obligation to provide a safe environment.  Talking with your guidance councellor might be a good place to start.  I'm quite sure you won't be the first person to ask for some advice related to a student being gay.  You are not alone.  <br>  <br>  Your guidance counselor has a few advantages in helping you with your situation.  First he/she is an adult.  Second they are professionals.  They have the education and skill sets required to help you to get through whatever may come up.  Third they know the students.  If they need to take another student in their office to talk and talk with them they have that authority.  They can require it.  They can also help to preempt situations that may be less than great for you.  I really think your guidance counselor is the best person talk to.  He/She is not automatically allowed to talk to your parents - there is a confidential requirement here.  It may help that an adult on faculty knows.  Perhaps you aren't confortable with your guidance counsellor and another teacher is someone you'd be more comfortable talking to.  That's OK too.  They'll probably talk to the guidance counselor.  You just may not know it.  The important thing is that you aren't alone in dealing with coming out at school.<br>  <br>  You'll be fine - talk to your guidance counselor.  I promise that your school staff has more experience than you think.<br>  <br>  He/she has experience you may do well to avail yourself of.  They are there to help students with issues students face.  Best wishes and also - its easy to be gay in college - people have matured by then.  Its the kid crap you may face that I think your guidance counsellor can help you with.|`|pYn2L2DHaa	If your gay, and you know it, then you're gay.<br>  <br>  You can't control what other people choose to say.<br>  <br>  If everyone in school knows you're gay, then everyone in school knows you're gay and you'll figure out a way to deal with it.<br>  <br>  One thing to note:  middle schoolers can be *devastatingly* cruel and you will almost certainly get flack from some of the hormonal adolescent male homophobes.  Develop and keep a group of good, supportive friends to help you and support you when the male homophobes decide to come calling and musking all over everything -- and remember, karma works in funny ways.  A lot of really homophobic guys I knew in middle and high school ended up having gay kids -- or even better, married women who later realized they were lesbian!|`|3ee9a82552425841f1df0a2f7477f624aa	Just come out, if they hate you then you finally know who your true friends are.

Or, you could stand up for yourself, be proud of who you are, and not give a care in the world what negative things anyone thinks about you.

But once, when I went to a different school then I do know, I made the mistake of telling my friend I was gay and he told a lot of people and soon it was all over the school. It seemed like everyone was either calling me a f*****, a rooster sucker, a homo, a man whore, ****, freak, bull rider( I never really understood that one), or just saying I was gross, I was a sin, and sh*t like that. I was thinking about killing myself but I didn't. I stuck it out, got in a lot of fights, got call things, made a few people bleed, got beat up, and one day before I moved away I stood up to everyone. At lunch people where throwing things and saying things under their breath, then this guy came over to my table and started **** with me. I got up and cursed his a** out and I cursed everyone that ever said anything to me out that day. I stood up for myself and took it like a man.

There were a few haters/homophobes, but I didn't back down when people asked me questions or wanted to fight me. I was honest, and I didn't let their sarcasm, criticism, or anything else bother me. Quite a few people tried to start fights with me, but I stayed calm and didn't back down, and didn't get in a single fight. Just let them know you are who you are and you won't back down either.

There was no Adam, and no Eve. There was just a very long, gradual change into what we are today.<br>  <br>  If it is important who created them, Mother Nature did it, and I suppose you could consider her to be a higher force, beyond our reach, and our creator. But this does not make her a deity or a "super" natural force.<br>  <br>  Even the "Mitochondrial Eve", the maternal lineage of all human DNA, (given the name Eve obviously because of Eve in the bible), the "Eve" concept refers not to one single woman, but to a gene pool of several thousand women in pre-history down the human evolutionary chain, from where today's female line originated.|`|EMYImof1aa	according to atheists there were no first two humans, humans would come about from evolution, hairless monkeys, they just kept reproducing and evolving little by little until there was a new species apart from monkeys|`|d529cebfe13576f3ddee3e55b4cd08ffaa	Uh, first two humans that could reproduce?<br>  <br>  Before directing a question to us, at least be informed in what we believe.

OUbNSXjJaa	Such questions should be deliberated at length in order to open up the real essence of teachings.<br>  <br>  It is a brain-storming exercise. To me, with my limited knowledge, ego is limited and ego is for selfish reasons. When I am selfish, I take care of my own thing without bothering even about my relatives or friends. But when I try and start to accommodate their interests and welfare also, my ego becomes big to accommodate their interests. I then feel I am living not only for me but also for my relatives and friends.<br>  <br>  When we further carry forward such exercise and try to accommodate the interests, welfare and prosperity of my neighbors and society irrespective of their sex, caste, creed or other backgrounds, then my ego becomes further enlarged. I start feeling that I am living not only for me and my relatives and friends, but also for my neighbors and society. <br>  <br>  This exercise can be further stretched. We can thus try to accommodate the interests of our nation and then ultimately the total universe. Once we reach this stage, we come to know that each and every one of our small actions will have a bearing on the universal interests. Whatever good or bad actions I do, I know for certain, that it will have its repercussion not only on me, but also on the prestige or image of my family, my village, etc.<br>  <br>  If we try to start small mischief or confusion in the society, it will later on become a chaos thus leading to anarchy.<br>  <br>  "Nirvana". Coming to the point. When the individual ego gets converted to Universal Ego, man reaches nirvana, complete freedom. Whereas in actual practice, a man, who wants to take care of the universal interests and wants to look after the whole universal welfare and prosperity, can never remain 'free'.|`|d7c8ecd624fbbc0797b1502ba6682e8baa	Trying to let go of the ego is like trying to still water by pushing on the waves.

For many of us it takes a lifetime to learn let alone practice this.|`|Xcri5qeTaa	What worked for me is paying attention to what other people "want." That is thinking in terms of what people say and do as having an underlying "want," and trying to figure out what that is, and maybe why they have that want, not so much thinking in depressing terms like "everyone is selfish."<br>  <br>  As you do this, in even the smallest seeming events, you'l begin to understand your wants, and, therefor, your ego.

In the general context that you're talking about, though, it's often used to indicate a model of ourselves we have in our mind that we then typically forget is only a model. We tend, for instance, to presume that our thoughts are what make up "us" -- but this effectively ignores the fact that a part of us which is before thinking creates our thoughts. Our thoughts, in other words, come from somewhere that's more originally "us" than our conscious thinking is.*<br>  <br>  It can be hard to describe, so here's an analogy. The ego -- our thinking, conscious "self" -- could be compared to a character on a movie screen. That character has ideas, felt motivations, and a sense of enacting its decisions and behaviors. But in point of fact it is, literally, a projection. Something creates it; it comes from somewhere. In this analogy, the movie character "comes from" the light of the movie projector. And a movie character would "lose their ego" when they realized that are a projection (and realizing, too, perhaps that much of their thoughts and actions are "scripted"). <br>  <br>  It might be pointed out, though, that that realization is not the same as "tossing out" or destroying the ego. It's more like, to use a fancy word for it, "deconstructing" the ego -- deeply appreciating its context and origin. A movie character who realizes that they are a projection can still go on being their character, and, no doubt, do that with a greater freedom and sense of awe and appreciation.<br>  <br>  As for how to effect such an appreciative understanding and "letting go" of the ego, meditation is a great classic method. There are many forms of meditation, but a lot of them have precisely the effect of quieting our thoughts so that we are afforded an opportunity eventually to see that we are matter-of-factly much more than our thinking minds. Meditative practices help us effect a RELATIONSHIP with our thinking minds. Having that sort of relationship with the occurrence of thoughts is a huge and simple part of what it means to transcend or "let go of" the ego.<br>  .|`|VPlKbDplaa	I don't think you can get rid of your ego because your ego is part and parcel of what you are in this human condition that is this thinking and feeling body with desires. But we have been blessed with the divine essence when God (Glorious and Exalted is He....Allah subhana wa ta'ala in the Arabic) breathed his spirit into man [Qur'an].........and thus God (Glorious and Exalted is He) is the goal. <br>  <br>  I think Abu-Hamid Al-Ghazali (may Allah subhana wa ta'ala be please with him) got this right when he said that the human condition is as if four things in one: wise man, devil, pig and dog, with pig representing sensuality, and dog representing hunger. He said that the Philosophers will say: 'go kill your pig and dog'. But Al-Ghazali's take on this as a Sufi and Muslim Theologian and Philosopher in his own right was this:<br>  <br>  "If you kill your pig, how can you feel love. If you kill your dog, how can you gain your strength. You have to purify, transform your pig into your pure love, and your hunger into pure aspiration, power and strength.

d9157449b4296a78a2d93140eae05e2baa	Prometheus is a (rather rare) name.  I can understand getting a bunch of Michaels or Johns or Jennifers in a room together, but it is unlikely that you'll ever get a group of people named Prometheus together in a room.<br>  <br>  But, Prometheus is a Latin name, so perhaps you would follow regular Latin declension rules...  In this case, the plural would be Promethei.<br>  <a href="http://www.archives.nd.edu/cgi-bin/lookup.pl?stem=Prometheus" rel="nofollow">http://www.archives.nd.edu/cgi-bin/looku...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Toyota officials have said that Prius is used singular or plural, similar to the like of sheep or fish or deer.<br>  <a href="http://autos.groups.yahoo.com/group/toyotaprius/message/3576">http://autos.groups.yahoo.com/group/toyo...</a><br>  <a href="http://autos.groups.yahoo.com/group/toyotaprius/message/753">http://autos.groups.yahoo.com/group/toyo...</a><br>  <br>  The Latin root of "prius" is "prior," which is a 3rd declension comparitive adjective.  "Prius" is the 3rd declension neuter nomitive/accusitive form, so the plural of "prius" is either "priora" (neuter) or "priores" (m/f).  Latin 3rd declension adjectives in the nominative/accusitive form (such as "prius") can also be a comparitive adverb, which have no plural.<br>  <a href="http://www.archives.nd.edu/cgi-bin/lookup.pl?stem=prior&ending=" rel="nofollow">http://www.archives.nd.edu/cgi-bin/looku...</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_declension" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_decle...</a><br>  <br>  However, many people are much more used to the usual pluralization of 2nd declension nouns, where -us is changed to -i.  See:  cactus -> cacti, fungus -> fungi.  Hence, the common usage of the plural of Prius to be "Prii."  But, not every word follows in that fashion...  For example, the correct plural of octopus is octopuses, although some still like to use octopi.  (Same goes for hippopotamus -> hippopotamuses (and not hippopotami).)<br>  <a href="http://www.askoxford.com/asktheexperts/faq/aboutgrammar/plurals?view=uk" rel="nofollow">http://www.askoxford.com/asktheexperts/f...</a><br>  (BTW: for Latin 4th declension nouns ending in -us, their plual is also -us (long u)...)<br>  <br>  Do note that "prius" is not a verb, as Toyota claims ("to go before"), and actually translates to before, formerly...<br>  <a href="http://www.toyota.com/help/faqs/vehicle-what_do_the_different_toyota_model_names_mean.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.toyota.com/help/faqs/vehicle-...</a><br>  <br>  Following regular English pluralization rules, the plural of "Prius" would be "Priuses."<br>  <br>  Some also believe that "Prius" is a proper name/trademark, and so should be used as an adjective.  One Prius car, two Prius cars, one Prius tire, four Prius tires.

2nRjy734aa	You appear mixed race. You do not look totally African (black). Put you next to Whoopi Goldberg and a two-year-old could spot the difference.<br>  <br>  African-Americans are the biggest advocates for the classification of anyone with black blood or "black looks" as black ( <a href="http://bbsnews.net/article.php/20061222014017231" rel="nofollow">http://bbsnews.net/article.php/200612220...</a> ). Best example is the President. Others include first best "black" actress - Halle Berry, a biracial woman. Most blacks insist on perpetuating the one-drop rule which labels any one with black bood as black. Sadly, most of society goes along with this and there are laws on the books brought about by black family "advocates" that say a biracial child (white + black) *must* be placed in a black family, no matter what their mommy or daddy is (or was). Thankfully, this attitude is changing as evidenced by the more-than-one-box-checking now allowed on census forms. <br>  <br>  The claim by the black community that they "come in all colors" is a contradiction. The "they" means African. Africans are black-skinned people, not "high yellow", etc. The "many colors" comes from racial mixing, not "them". But, that doesn't mean all blacks are biracial, just as all races, decendants of Africans, are not black. Having a little bit of white blood is totally different than being the direct offspring of a white person. <br>  <br>  The one drop rule is racist, scientifically flawed, and was ruled unconstitutional in 1967. A person of mixed race, like you, is just that -a mix. No matter what race they "look" like or "identify" with, a multiracial person carries 50% of genetic traits of all the races of each parent, both those that appear outwardly and those that don't. Black does NOT dominate.<br>  <br>  Labeling a person a race on looks alone would mean Eastern Indians, Arabs and people of other races are also black. That's ludicrous. Labeling a person based on "treatment" or "experience" means anyone discriminated against or from the "hood" is black. That's ridiculous. <br>  <br>  The continued insistance by the black community to apply a ONE race to a biracial/multiracial person of black ancestry enrages me. I'm reminded of an 8-year-old, precious biracial boy featured on the Montell Williams show who hanged himself because of racial teasing by his white brother. If this little boy, and the many more biracial people who struggle with identity issues, had been encouraged by society to embrace ALL of himself, and taught by his family the truth, that he IS all of himself and is part of ALL of his family no matter what, he may still be here with us today. <br>  <br>  No one can pick and choose which race they are. No matter what they choose to label themselves as does not change what they are. You are multiracial. No matter what anyone tries to label you, I thank you for and encourage you to continue loving ALL of you. Classifying the direct offspring of two or more races as ONE race is advocacy for internal segregation.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.projectrace.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.projectrace.com/</a>|`|2tn8EALqaa	because you are black?<br>  A black Hispanic.<br>  "Mexican" is a nationality.

I suspect there are alot of Mexicans with some black ancestry that dont even realize it. For example, you pointed out that people have a hard time accepting you're Mexican but I doubt anyone questions your daughter's mexican heritage.

ixFbNr4taa	Back in ancient times - rare items were used to make pigments such as Pearl or Lapis lazuli.  How about your chapters being named after stones or pigments?  You could make a major drawing highlighting the color and meaning of the gem or stone.  And incorporate a picture that really advances the plot at that point in the story.    <br>  <br>  Your bodyguard could be really be a prince of a rival country.  He was raised in a martial arts temple -- so he has the skills to defend the princess.  But he also was taught all the intellectual skills such as  courtly poetry, and high art that a royal prince should have.....  And as he was in the monastery - he learned all sorts of mystical things he can do with his paints and pigments.  <br>  <br>  Example -- Onyx is known to separate. It can help release negative emotions such as sorrow and grief. It is used to end unhappy or bothersome relationships.  OR  Lapis lazuli offers protection and that dreaming of lapis would foretell love that would be forever faithful. <br>  <br>  Why is he volunteering to be the princess's bodyguard?  <br>  Did her country invade his?  <br>  Is he planning revenge and then discovers he loves her?  <br>  Does she grow to love him thinking he is a "disgraced" priest and can not marry her (triple whammy of being lowborn, a priest and with a secret??)  <br>  Who is the villian?<br>  Is there a prize?  A stolen gem or crown?  A symbol of Kingship that the bodyguard/artist can recover??<br>  <br>  I've attached a website that explains the meanings and properties of various gemstones to help you out.

hmCOGoCdaa	I had this Telemarketer/Scam company calling us 4-6 times a day from the same phone number. We were very polite the first two days, just saying no thank you and not interested. But after the 2nd day I was tired of them harassing us. They even said that they would not stop calling until i allowed them to send us a $300 gas card and pay them for the shipping and handling. So I tried my hardest to keep the guy on the phone for the longest amount of time. I would ask questions but I said I didn't understand. I talked to a few different people till I got bored and hung up. So the next day when they called I put my 4 year old on the speaker phone with the lady. I told him she wanted to talk to him. He talked to her a long time about dinner and sponge-bob and all sorts of things that 4 year olds talk about. Then he got bored talking to her so I got back on the phone with her and I told her to please hold I'd be right back. I had her on the phone for close to 20 minutes. And they never called back again.|`|DNfc84qNaa	I babble the latest story that I learned in Chinese, then in the end, ask them if they understood (in Chinese).

One is when the call, I act that I'm really busy and ask them can I have their number so I can call them back.  Obviously they said "no." Then I asked them why not and they responded by telling me that they could not give out that information. Then I said to them how did they think I felt by them having my information and then slammed the phone in their ear.  Well, I didn't ever hear back from them again. Good riddance!<br>  <br>  <br>  This next trick that I did on them is one that I do often and it seems to work really well to ending pesty callers. Ok... here it goes!!!<br>  <br>  Sometimes you just don't want to hang up right in people's faces, so I have a more subtle approach to shattering their dreams of making a sale. Most of the times they are very pushy and will not take no for an answer, so what I will do is act like I'm very interested in what they have to sell and then ask for additional things that will take up more of their time. Then I will tell them that I'm interested in all of this crap that I don't want to buy and I know they're smiling as they're ringing up my grand total to themselves. After wasting 20 mins. of their time I'll tell them to hold on so that I can grab my checkbook or credit card and I'll leave the phone by itself until I hear the predisconnection loud sound on the phone.  I've had people wait as long as 30 mins. on a dead line phone eager to make a sale that will never transpire.

eb4e977a0cb9ce50b08bf74f0f3a0c61aa	Here is truth - read and understand. <br>  1. Vampires, defined as a humanoid being that MUST consume blood or energy to survive do not exist.  Cut and paste time, as it is too much work to type this out over and over and I "recycle" my own answers instead of retyping them so here goes. A brief discussion of the human digestive system and then the probable vampire population given an exponential growth rate should explain why vampires are not possible. <br>  <br>  2. The human body is not designed to process large amounts of blood for nutrition. There is not enough protein, carbohydrates, and fats present in blood to maintain a complex creature such as Homo Sapiens or any theorized offshoot mutations. When a human ingests food it is first broken up into a bolus by chewing, then churned up in the stomach with digestive juices to form a mass called chyme. It then passes through the pylorus into the duodenum, part of the small intestine where it mixes with bile salts and secretions from the pancreas and liver which continue breaking it down on a molecular basis, mostly affecting fats at this point. The broken down nutrients pass through the wall of the intestines and into the bloodstream where they are carried to each cell or stored for later use. Indigestible bulk continues through the intestines, turning a dark brown from the bile. Water is absorbed from this mass in the large intestine depending on the needs of the body - a well-hydrated person will usually have a softer stool than a dehydrated person will. Water also enters the bloodstream, and this is what helps to maintain blood pressure. The pressure tends to balance itself in a healthy person because the bloodstream goes through a formation in the kidney called the Loop of Henle, where the narrowing blood vessel forces excess water and cellular waste such as urea out through the cellular wall into the kidneys, where it is excreted through the ureters into the bladder, and then out of the body via the urethral passageway.<br>  <br>  3. IMPORTANT - A person physically unable to process his own food for nutrition therefore also could not process blood - it's the same process. Ingested blood does not transmit directly to the veins anyway - it would be chemically broken down by the digestive system.<br>  <br>  4. Theoretical ingestion of blood to supply these nutrients would therefore have to occur at least once a day, and would require the ingestion of the entire blood supply which could not happen as the stomach is far too small to hold that much liquid volume. Hold up your clenched fist - under normal conditions your stomach is about that size. Furthermore, such a mass would be difficult to pass thru the intestines as it has no fibrous bulk, would create an intestinal impaction, causing massive vomiting from the large concentration of iron present, and any "real" vampire would have to eventually expel the waste, which would come out as a black, tarry, smelly goo, just as stool does when blood is present from a upper GI bleed. <br>  <br>  5. These humans that affect the whole "vampiric lifestyle" are NOT vampires. They are simply humans playing their own little game, in their own little fantasy world, usually pandering to their own little sexual fetish, which may or may not actually be sexual. I too, play my own little game, in the SCA, but mine is a game where the deeds that I do are determined by the strength of my arm and sword - I am a warrior, with just as much skill and ability as any warrior of ancient times. The difference is that I am claiming to be something physically possible: a warrior, and I prove it everytime I strap on my armor and walk onto a SCA battlefield. The so-called "vampires" are claiming to be something physically impossible: a walking corpse, and all they prove is that black Victorian clothing, a pair of false fangs, and a little makeup make for a good Halloween costume - it does not make you a vampire.<br>  <br>  6. Even if a vampire feeds once a week, and his victim also becomes a vampire, that is exponential growth, with four iterations a month. First iteration: One makes one, total two. Second iteration: Two make two, total four. Third iteration: Four make four, total eight. Fourth iteration: Eight make eight, total sixteen. 16 vampires at the end of one month, 256 at the end of the second month, 4096 by the end of the third month, 65,536 by the end of the fourth month, 1,048,476 at the end of the fifth, and 33,572,832 vampires at the end of half a year! By way of comparison, there are currently approximately 33 million people who have HIV/AIDS in the U.S. alone, and the disease is a world-wide epidemic. I see people every day in the hospital with AIDS, but never has there been one documented case of a vampire attack. Do the math - vampires are a mathematical impossibility. As for the idea that vampires existed "a long time ago" consider the estimated global population 5,000 years ago - using the above mathematical rationale, a single vampire converted every human on the globe in less than two years. This falls therefore, under the logic of Occam's Razor - which states that when you have removed every impossible answer, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth. Since there is no "vampiric plague" swarming the earth, the logical deduction is that they don't exist.<br>  <br>  7. Point of clarification about "vampire" bats: vampire is simply the name we have given them because they do drink blood, same as a flea, mosquito, leech, or spider. Are these creatures vampires? No. They are living creatures, not legendary monsters. They can subsist on blood because of their smaller size and proportionately larger stomach volume. Drinking blood does not make you a vampire anymore than eating raw meat makes you a werewolf, although it might make you a mosquito.<br>  <br>  8.The humans who profess to be vampires are victims of an all-encompassing self induced delusion. They are as human as you or I, regardless of their claims, and if they ingest HIV tainted blood they can most certainly contract the disease, esp. if they have any cuts, sores, or lesions in and or around their mouth. It is a very dangerous delusion to be laboring under. Note that there is absolutely no scientific or medical proof that these people derive any benefit at all from the ingestion of blood, and even worse are the so-called "psychic" vampires, because their delusion is one that they cannot substantiate with any concrete evidence at all.<br>  <br>  9. There is no "vampire" gene. People are not "born" as vampires. When a woman goes to the hospital for prenatal care there are many tests done on mother and child, even while still in the womb, to check for many things, including genetic anomalies that result in deformities and birth defects. If such a gene existed, in today's world with today's technology it would have been found - we have already completely sequenced the human genome. It would also have to follow Mendel's law of dominant/recessive gene theory. Again, the odds on that many "vampires" all escaping the notice of the medical/scientific community are so low as to be almost nonexistent. The idea that there is a global "vampire community" engaging in controlled breeding to keep the "bloodline pure" is delusional in the extreme.<br>  <br>  10. There is no "vampire virus" - as I have already pointed out, HIV is a virus, and look at how fast it has spread - virtually everyone knows someone with the affliction. According to the "vampire websites" there are "thousands" of vampires running around. If that was so then at least one of them has ended up in a hospital for bloodwork when they became pregnant, had a bloodborne infection, was injured in a car wreck, etc, etc, ad nauseum. The anomaly would have been detected and medical science would have isolated it, studied it, applied for research grants on it, published papers on it, and turned it into the talk of the medical and scientific community, as well as making its "discoverers" celebrities and rich beyond their dreams. A virus cannot alter your DNA in such a radical fashion without killing you.|`|nOU8WvmDaa	yes i saw some vampires on the street around midnight yesterday.

Now, for the vampires that do exist, of which are the people who choose to drink blood only, the only way to pass that on is through influence or inspiring someone to drink blood as a supplement.|`|y3jD0DDpaa	bearclaw is correct|`|qMVOV9t4aa	No their all myths doll.|`|TyJuZnZhaa	Erm. It depends on what you mean by, "Vampires."<br>  <br>  Some people consider themselves vampires. There are even people who drink blood just for the Hell of it. We honestly cannot condemn their existence or not. If someone claims to be some sort of vampire, how can we really check? There is no tests. lol.<br>  <br>  But, the vampires I believe in existing are "Modern-day vampires." And by modern-day vampires, I mean people who're pale, dislike/react to the sun, label themselves as a vampire, and have an odd attraction to blood. (I'm not joking...) <br>  <br>  But, no, this is probably not genetic. I mean, sure. Maybe if you experience these habits then maybe you can pass them on genetically. But it's nothing to worry about, lol.|`|j1yLZ7ozaa	Actually, in Hebrew Demonology Lilitu (synonymous with Lilith) was depicted as bathing in the blood of babies and in Jewish lore as feasting on men, women, and infants. <br>  She and her daughters the Lilin (Fathered by the Angel of Death, by the way) were considered extremely dangerous (probably not something you would want to become) and functioned similarly to succubi. <br>  <br>  So if it is possible, which it's presumably not, being a 'vampire' isn't really as glamorous as is shown in certain popular media (Twilight).|`|XwLjFq3Laa	i think so. i searched sites and they all said they exist and that they were just like workers for the Dev. in disguise as humans.<br>  <br>  oh and there is a disease where you have all these things like the vampire like alergic to garlic and so so|`|IRB86ktJaa	you guys are pathetic, all of -no offence - but come on if they exist and your tring to find them, wouldn't they come out and admit it instead of waiting for you to freakin look for them. just stop looking, they DONT WANT TO BE FOUND. eesh|`|AA10351342	Vampires don't exist, sorry!|`|pzY0ARqDaa	No, vampires don't exist.

To be loved and blessed by Jesus, to believe in Jesus alone for salvation, to be in friendship and fellowship with Jesus, and to worship Jesus forever!  :) <br>  <br>  Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation. <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what! <br>  <br>  Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|c99jycZIaa	A movie not nearly as funny as the one about the Holy Grail.|`|TYPztzBlaa	To choose.

oJrPLOw4aa	When is it in February. And what are you kinda thinking    Scary-   Originals-   Pretty-   Nice-
dQcPV4Rqaa	WELL FIRST OFF I DON'T THINK THE IDEA OF GHOSTS WOULD MAKE US FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE ABOUT DEATH..IF ANY   THING IT WOULD MAKE US MORE AFRAID...IF WE CAN GET STUCK BETWEEN WORLDS AND RELIVE THE PAST OVER AND OVER..OR OUR DEATH..AND NOT BE ABLE TO CROSS OVER TO WHERE EVER WE ARE SUPPOSED TO GO..NOW THAT IS SCARY!    ARE THERE GHOSTS, HUMMM THAT IS A GOOD QUESTION..BUT I AM NOT SURE IF THERE IS A GOOD ANSWER...MY FAVORITE SHOW IS "GHOST HUNTERS" I THINK THAT EVERY TIME THEY MAKE CONTACT WITH THE SPIRIT WORLD, THAT IT IS AWESOME..BUT WHAT REALLY ARE THE COMMUNICATING WITH..WHO KNOWS...DISEMBODIED VOICES FROM WHERE...  AND I ALWAYS HAVE TO LAUGH AT THE LAME QUESTIONS THEY ASK...WHO ARE YOU? HOW DID YOU DIE? DID YOU LIVE HERE/    WHO CARES??? GET TO IT...ASK..IS THERE A GOD? DID YOU SEE GOD? WHAT WAS IT LIKE TO DIE? WHY AREN'T YOU RESTING? WHY DIDNT YOU GO TO THE LIGHT? THOSE ARE THE QUESTIONS WE ALL WANT ANSWERED..WHO GIVES A CRAP WHAT THEIR NAME IS??     I WANT ANSWERS IF WE ARE ACTUALLY COMMUNICATING WITH SPIRITS...LIKE I SAID I LOVE GHOSTHUNTERS, IT IS ENTERTAINING BUT I AM STILL WAITING FOR THEM TO CONVINCE ME THAT THERE ARE TRULY REAL ACTUAL SPIRITS...BUT HOW?    I DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION...I GUESS WHEN IT HAPPENS I WILL KNOW IT...I ALSO WATCH "PARANORMAL STATE" "PSYCHIC DETECTIVES" " MOST HAUNTED" AND MANY OTHER PARANORMAL SHOWS...I AM INTRIGUED..BUT NOT TOTALLY CONVINCED..    HOWEVER I DID LIVE IN A HOUSE FOR YEARS THAT HAD SOME REALLY STRANGE, SPOOKY THINGS GOING ON IN THE ATTIC...I TRIED TO IGNORE IT FOR THE MOST PART, BUT NOW THAT I LOOK BACK...IT WAS NOT AT ALL NATURAL...WHAT WAS IT..HUMMM IF I HAD TO GUESS I WOULD SAY IT WAS A DEMON..OR MY IMAGINATION..CRAP I AM NOT EVEN SURE ANYMORE....    I THINK WHEN WE DIE WE SHOULD JUST GO TO THE LIGHT..OR REST...NOT POSSIBLY GET STUCK IN SOME NETHER WORLD AND BE MISERABLE FOR ETERNITY..NOW THAT SUCKS !!|`|e3gZsCsgaa	Yes, they're real after my first year in college.

So are spirits, scientific research has proven to people that there is a spiritual world and we are somewhat in it...    You could simply look up the definition of ghost or spirit and it tells the truth, of what they are and how they become it.    However the ghost stories your friends might tell you may not always be real, they could be made to scare you or like u said to make u feel better about death. Either way ghosts and spirits to exist. But it is still up to u to believe...|`|5cf645531fb620cdd6bb22deb9af5f0caa	Yes, ghost or spirits are very much real. I have at least one spirit in my house that I know of. I have personally not had any contact with it but four other people that have visited me has asked me about wierd things in my house. The latest one happened just this week. My daughters boyfriend asked me if I got up at 2am and walked down the hall and sat in the chair in the office. He said it was definitely someone walking.
N3dqnNr6aa	Your dad clearly loves you, and I can actually relate very strongly to your mom's position. I've had exes go straight on me, and feeling that you have absolutely nothing to offer someone you loved is a terrible experience.    But I think you should support your father, I don't blame you for feeling awkward about your father dating a young white man, it's a delicate situation, but the fact is that he's doing what it takes to make himself happy and I think you should support that.    I know it's easy to give advice like this, it's not my life, but he must be feeling totally cut off from everyone he loves, and he really wants to be in your life.    As for your grandparents, he didn't do this TO you (sorry, no italics). I know your mother feels vulnerable but it wasn't geared at her or you, it's something he did FOR himself.    Hope I helped somehow.|`|lBLBvE0Zaa	I think your father is mature enough to live his life the way he wants to. It is true you and your mom didn't deserve to be left alone, but did your dad deserve to live an unhappy life? No one does. Would it have been different if he had left to be with another woman?    I think you should go. He is your father and needs your support. He's shown he cares about you and wants to be in your life. You'd be surprised if you knew how many parents don't care about their kids, so you should feel lucky. You love him, so you should respect his decisions.    Good luck.  ;-)|`|8ZUVToXgaa	I think you should go.    It IS your dad.    And as a gay or bi male, do you think your dad should have stayed with your mom just to make you happy? That's very, VERY selfish.    I'd cut him some slack. No one else seems to want to.    What he did, or maybe the way he did it, wasn't right, but he had to start somewhere.|`|kavhzTXgaa	First off bb, i want to tell you that you are a strong young man and you should be very proud of yourself. Based on what you have gone through the fact that you are considering going shows maturity, courage, and unconditional love.     What your Dad is going through is not easy for him either(i can only imagine). I really hope you can find it in your heart to forgive and go have a sit down with his b/f and him. Just be willing to listen and absorb what they have to say. What you do after you've heard their side is entirely up to you. Love him, love yourself , love your mom, and try to give his partner a chance.     Your father is trying to be true to himself, I'm not saying what he did was right but we all deserve to be happy. Good Luck|`|nisfxpXHaa	Oh hun, I am so sorry that your family is going through this mess. First I want to tell you that you seem very sensitive to everyone involved.    I think you should follow your heart.  It's pretty obvious that your father loves you immensely, he has continued to reach out to you. I do think your father should have enough respect for you, to ask that it just be himself and you at this first lunch/visit in 6 months. You don't need to rekindle anything with your father's boyfriend. And if you are going to be apart of your father's life again there is plenty of time for you to meet his boyfriend.    I really think you should insist on it just being your father and you. After a few more of these meetings then I could see having either your mother there or his boyfriend there.      You mother and father are forever bound to one another because they have a child together. And I am not saying that your mother owes your father a thing, she doesn't. But she owes it to you to work on being civil with your father, a man she used to love, a man that I'm sure loved her as well.    There are many things in your future that will require that your parents are able to be in the same room together. High school graduation, college graduation, perhaps a wedding if you are so blessed.    Good luck hun, I know this must be very difficult.      L|`|EK7mJWPZaa	he is your dad you should go...i wish you, your mother and your dad the best of luck :)|`|ktCFG0tMaa	I think it is an awkward situation. Seeing that your willing to go is a good thing, but the situation is pushing it. Tell you dad that your first meeting should be with only him, to discuss the situation.|`|6sAbs2iiaa	I think you should sit down and talk to your Dad about the bible. God forbits such a thing and the one's that do not obey him will burn in the lake of fire. I think your Dad is very lost and it's very discusting what he is doing and it was very wrong what he did by leaving your mom. Talk to him about God try to put the fear of God in him and if he does not listen walk away and don't ever talk to him so maybe one day he will realise he has lost all his loved one's and hopefully come to himself.|`|egN478Bbaa	It's ur dad.  If you want a relationship with him then go see him.  Just be cordial to the boyfriend and focus on ur dad. Take him aside once ur feeling more comfortable with the situation and explain how you really feel.   It's awesome that your mom won't be offended.  She's a heck of a woman.  Sometimes it takes more to tell the truth than it does to tell/live a lie.  Your mom will survive.  It's better she knows now bc in truth she was living in his lie as well.  She will find someone and be happy again.  Or maybe she just wants to be happy alone.  Ur dad just needs understanding.  I dont agree w/ what he did but s**t happens.  We just have to roll w/ the punches and say a prayer.  Good Luck in your decision. :)|`|aDXsUPYRaa	I am not saying that your dad did the right thing. i don't think he should leave your mum this way. do you still love your father, without concern about his sexuality and that 6 years older white boyfriend? think about it. i know it's gonna be a little awkward that's the way it is. he is your father after all.|`|wcOq60Hhaa	Take a deep breath and stop over thinking everything.    Point one:  it isn't about you.  I am assuming that your father is really gay and was miserable being married and living a lie.  Yes, what he did to your mother was wrong.  However, you are 18.  You are not a child and you have no business thinking like a child.  You got something like a normal childhood out of this abnormal relationship (between your mother & father).  Just imagine for a minute if your father had come out of the closet & left your mother when you were 8 or 11 or 14...?      Point 2:  You are an adult.  Do what your heart tells you is the right thing to do.  Don't over think it.  You may consider how others react to your action, but don't let it stop something as simple as a lunch...if you want to.  If it turns out to be weird or awful...don't do it again.|`|vKvNDPbDaa	i think you should do what you feel is right.  what happened between your parents is sad.  im sure ur mom is a beautiful woman inside and out.  fortunately ur father does want a relationship with you.  i think you should hear him out see what he says.  of course its gonna be awkward for everyone, but family is family and if you want to be in eachothers lives things have to be discussed. take this opportunity let ur dad know how you feel.  i hope things work out.

cgfgR1weaa	I don't condone throwing something at a disabled person. But I will say I know what you are talking about. You have been caring for him for 12 years and sounds like with little help. Social Services should have gotten involved and offered assistance in his care long before it got to this point. Caring for someone who is disabled and needs full time supervision is exhausting and I understand the sleep deprivation that can cause things to happen with no intent to do harm. I went through months that I was not able to sleep when my disabled son was young and was suicidal/ homicidal due to hallucinations. No one did anything to help until it was almost too late. There were times I wanted to just throw him through a window so I could sleep for an hour.     Expect some repercussions, but also make sure to demand some help with the care of your father. You should be able to get respite care so you have some time to unwind, even just for a day or two a month. Make sure authorities at the police station and social services know that this is not a habit but a single incident caused by frustration and lack of being able to rest and replenish your own reserves, ask for help and volunteer to take classes on anger management if they are offered.    To everyone who posted blaming you totally and being so critical, maybe if you lived it for 6 months you would understand.|`|kSyiUxYSaa	You deserve whatever you get from the police.|`|TCqrS8Vqaa	hiya, im in a wheelchair,and very disable.that was a terrible thing to do.how can it be a accident.the chances are,they will not your father in a home.and you will not get work with the old or young.im sorry but you deserve every think you get.|`|AA11434633	How do you "accidentally" throw a bottle at someone?    I honestly believe you should be questioning yourself over your motivation for doing so.    I'm not sure whether this will, in fact, appear on a CRB check.  What I do suggest, however, is that you mention to the police officer that you have to see tonight, that you work in a school and ask his/her advice on this.  It may well be that if you are not charged with an offence that it will not appear.    To be quite honest with you, and speaking as an ex-social worker myself, you may have more of a job convincing the social worker that there was no ill intent when you threw the bottle.  I'm pretty sure that if the social worker pursues the case using the Protection of Vulnerable Adults act that this will definitely go against you.    All I can say is that I hope you've learned something from this sorry business and that you do come to terms with whatever was going through your mind at the time.    Blessings to you ... and your father.    Edit:    I agree with Fifi L'amour that if you are feeling sleep deprived that you should sensibly be seeking help.  Speak with both your doctor and your social worker about this.  (It does tend to swing things in your favour the more people you have on-side.)|`|nzgZR6onaa	I was not there and don't know what truly happened but I am disabled and have had my kid get extremely annoyed with helping me and kicked a stool which not at me but it bounced and hit my leg.But the mere fact that they have anger they cannot control is not good and it sounds like you do.You sound as though you need counseling,help with your Dad or other arangements need to be made.It is not uncommon if you are the only caregiver in the family to be caring for the disabled person for you to get warn down and frustrated but elder abuse is unacceptable. Admit and seek help..|`|P2kL3apWaa	You need to be honest with them and tell them that you need help.  Take responsibility for what you did.  Apologize and ask for help.  You are burnt out and starting to take your anger out on your dad.|`|499b2674aceaca4224f1e97ffb73d7f7aa	I just hope you don't agree to be interviewed without legal representation.|`|daJk1VePaa	hahaha how can a plastic bottle accidentally be thrown ?|`|cr2KKT6Naa	you were smart to post this. to let others know NOT to throw things at people.   very sleep  anyway 12 years should say something for your hard work. iam sure he cant remember.   now he has a battle wond. he'll be telling that story for along time.   thats too bad about the cops . lucky for your dad. its wasnt a glass bottle. or a fry'n pan.|`|wefLzXp0aa	Hi  Obviously no one can or will condone what you did and you can't undo it, you need help from some quarter, it sounds as though your local social services has failed you big time, just tell the truth no matter what, looking after anyone is stressful let alone an elderly person and for twelve years, I would challenge anyone to look after someone that's ill for twelve weeks let alone twelve years, it obvious you snapped due to stress, sometimes the carers of relatives are overlooked as also needing help, hopefully some good can come out of this for the both of you. Good Luck.  Ray. West York's. U.K.|`|HRNll2bfaa	Not enough info if you explain it like this to crb you may have an issue if you act deceptively they will surely feel that you did it on purpose and if you did that is ok it is over and happened but if you are truly sorry and want to care for this man own up to the situation and you will be able to get through this but if you blame physics acting differently than it should have letting this bottle hit your father you may have problems. I hope you and your father all the best remember if you did it deal with it if it was an accident truly explain and it will be fine also. Good luck to you both!|`|bDPU6qWiaa	Now slow down,tell me did the bottle fling itself out of your hand,hit the wall and bounce toward your sleeping father,i f this is the case you have to plead not guilty and the wall will have to give a statement. i am disabled myself and i am at the moment sueing my wheelchair for going too fast and getting g force on my face thus giving me neuralgia(faceache)|`|BevylvVSaa	I can understand that there are ways you could throw a bottle accidently. I can also understand how you could be at the end of your rope and throw it intentionally thinking it would not hurt him.    I think you need to tell them that you love your father, but that you are overwhelmed and need help. I think you need to very clear about what you need. I also think you need to express a sincere apology.     Since this is the first time you have been caught doing this, my guess is they will be pretty easy on you if you are honest with them.|`|xKuWE9gfaa	I really feel for you and I can imagine what you were going through. When my mum had a stroke I could only visit her once a week, and then when my dad would go away for a break I would stay with her and after only 6 nights I was near to breaking point. When my mum died, my dad developed vascular dementia and I used to stay with him as he had no one else until he was so bad that he had to go into hospital and then a nursing home. I couldn't leave him out of my sight. So I know what you are going through. You really should talk to social services and get them to put you dad in a home so that you can get some respite. I know it sounds harsh, but did you know that many infirmed people outlive their carers.|`|8abc5b9cab61ed51f5b3b0ffd3f6ca5aaa	Call a lawyer NOW.    You do need help with your father, no doubt about it.  But with your career at stake don't say anything to them without legal advice.    I hope you will get some help.  It sounds like you have too great a burden and it's time to either get assistance or move him somewhere where he can get more regular care.  I'm sorry.|`|800607246df3ce3c65b01624978cb3dcaa	I'm sure that if it was a genuine accident you will be able to explain what happened to the satisfaction of the police.   Accidents do happen and even social services will be aware of this.   Surely your father doesn't want you to get into trouble with this? Could he not also explain what happened to them?   At the end of the day, whatever has happened has happened and you need to move on in whatever way you can. A caution will probably show up on a CRB check but only for a certain amount of time. Check with the police tonight to make sure.   If you are in such a bad state from your care duties, maybe you should consider some form of respite care to ease the pressure on you. Being sleep deprived is not fair on you or on the people you care for. There are lots of charities that offer information on this.|`|cF1naeOyaa	You should be ashamed of yourself. Firstly, your father is disabled! What on earth made you do such a thing to him? As someone else pointed out, how can you accidentally throw something? If you can do this to your own father, the person who brought you into this world and who raised you, then god forbid what you can do to someone who isn't related to you!     Maybe you should hand your father to better care if you can't hack it.|`|MRw1uEuLaa	why the hell would you throw a bottle at your disabled father  you deserve whatever you get|`|fxp8qIsIaa	well first of all i would try to get some help from the government. you will be stress out and as you say sleep deprived.You need time out.

No i don't condone throwing plastic bottles but i can understand the frustration of the problems. and how you can be pushed past the limits

The "carnys" just have a reputation of being wanted fugitives on the run and all that crazy stuff your parents tell you. I'm not saying it hasn't happened, though.   The fair just passed through my town and I went and found that alot of younger people are working it. I talked to one for a while and he was really nice, probably just wanted someone to talk to. You'd probably get bored sitting in a booth all day. I think the only good part of being a carnival worker is the traveling. Other than that, who would want to watch all the people have all the fun day-in and day-out? It seems like a lonely job to me.
3afb483212e7214e5fd3fcb0bda1cbd1aa	Sweetie what you are seeing is not the aura, it is your eyes creating a "copy" of what you are seeing. You can do the same by starring at your cat, or your computer... that doesn't mean that your computer has an aura.  Sorry... I see it too, and first I also thought it was the aura, until I started to see it on my car and bottles... LOL!!!|`|e3gZsCsgaa	Yes, you saw an aura. I know a lot of people who see them and I ask what color mine is anytime I remember.|`|YYbVDcw8aa	It's not that odd, sounds like you saw part of the aura, Tibetan Monks have written a good bit about looking at auras, try to find some of those books. they are very informative and not full of nonsense.|`|yQRAbHLgaa	It might have been an aura you seen but then again it could have been a trick of the light or something. If it is a aura it probably will get better with practice. Why don't you look at members of your family or something and see if you can see their auras cause not everyones aura is white. If you don't see it again it probably was a trick of the light or something.|`|fc49c21691e39a0333658afdb706dba3aa	If you can see an halo (circle) around the head, and a line going from the head up some three feet, and perhaps some other lines where chakrams are, yes, you are clairvoyant. Not many people are, but it is real. Halos vary in size, auras too. A good halo has a diameter of 30 inches, and an evolved aura is some 15-20 feet wide. You should be able to appreciate colors and understand them in four months, believe in yourself and have an open mind.|`|9UfJHW8Saa	Well that might be an aura  But auras are very rarely just white  they normally have a mix of colors, tones, tints  etc.  But it might just be the unfocusing of your eyes.|`|AA10943690	that is certinaltly weird!  but u might have so if i were u i would check out this website: (i hope this helps!)

G2yUpoqfaa	Whatever their public sin, they are already guilty of giving scandal, a mortal sin for them, in addition to the sin you indicate is gravely an offense against God.  They require a perfect Act of Contrition, and then much repentance and penance.      But this sin(s) bears not on your soul.  Nor do you have any permission from God to cause continuous scandal (to the public) or calumny, for then calumny becomes your mortal sin for which you would also be deserving of eternal damnation, and must make an Act of Perfect Contrition, seek absolution and do penance.     This is a case in which the innocent are to be protected, but not by calumnny on the part of anyone else.  Protect the innocent by quiet means, take the young away and talk not about anyone's sin in front of them.      Thank God you mentioned no names and made inquiry first, for it keeps your soul out of the matter.    Should anyone commit such a mortal sin, the Perfect Act of Contrition is found in the (hated) Catholic St. Andrew's Missal of 1937, in the Morning and Evening Prayers.

4tiyMjhEaa	What the other poster said. And...    I read that uruse is a dialect thing - so maybe it would be like "shaddup". "urusai" is the word you're looking for. There's also "shizuka ni shite kudasai", "damare", and "yakamashi". "joudan wa yamete" (don't joke/stop joking) might do the trick.    People here suggested various ways to say shut up depending on how polite you want to be:  http://forum.japantoday.com/viewtopic.ph...     "omae" is rude. Try anata-tachi instead of "omae-tachi":  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_pr...    in some context it would be wa, in others ga - but I don't think that it's affected by the number of people you're addressing:  http://japanese.about.com/library/weekly...

yAvTxh47aa	Christianity and Wicca as a syncretic, hyphenate religion cannot exist. While there are those who very sincerely believe that they are following both, they are not...<br>  The fault rests on how one defines Christian.<br>  <br>  If you define Christian as one who believes Christ existed, regardless of whether or not one believes in his teaching, it is possible that one could define oneself as a Wiccan Christian, but most Christians would say, quite rightly, that merely believing Christ EXISTED is NOT what makes a Christian.<br>  <br>  Merriam Webster (m-w.com) defines a Christian as " one who professes belief in the teachings of Jesus Christ*"<br>  <br>  It is possible to PROFESS belief in the teachings of Jesus Christ and be a Wiccan.<br>  <br>  ..You'd also be a liar.<br>  <br>  Because it is impossible to BELIEVE IN or AGREE WITH those teachings as a Wiccan.<br>  <br>  One common teaching in Christianity that is used to define Christianity is the Nicene Creed. If we examine it, we can see it is ABSOLUTELY NOT COMPATIBLE WITH WICCA. Observe.<br>  <br>  (My comments follow in brackets:)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The Nicene Creed:**<br>  We believe in one God, [Wiccans are polytheists]<br>  the Father, the Almighty,[Wicca does not teach omnipotence]<br>  maker of heaven and earth,<br>  of all that is, seen and unseen.<br>  [Wicca does not support Creationism but instead teaches "as above, so below, which includes the idea that the Universe may be interpreted by observation of its parts]<br>  <br>  We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,<br>  the only Son of God,<br>  eternally begotten of the Father,<br>  God from God, Light from Light,<br>  true God from true God,<br>  begotten, not made,<br>  of one Being with the Father.<br>  [Wicca teaches that there are multiple gods, and that all people are children of gods. Wicca does not mention Jesus at all.]<br>  <br>  Through him all things were made.<br>  [Wicca teaches that humankind makes many things.]<br>  For us and for our salvation<br>  [Wicca has no concept of salvation]<br>  he came down from heaven:<br>  by the power of the Holy Spirit<br>  [Wicca has no heaven, nor a Holy Spirit]<br>  he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,<br>  and was made man.<br>  [Wicca teaches that humans are born human and gods are born gods. Transformation in one life from one species to another is not a part of Wicca.]<br>  For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;<br>  he suffered death and was buried.<br>  [HUGE POINT! Wicca teaches that RESPONSIBILITY for all of a Wiccan's actions are upon that Wiccan, and must be taken care of by that Wiccan. Thus, in Wicca, it is impossible to die or suffer for someone ELSE except in very specific, personal situations (like taking a bullet for someone.) Wicca teaches there are no SINS, so there was literally no reason for Christ to die!]<br>  <br>  On the third day he rose again<br>  in accordance with the Scriptures;<br>  [This is in no WICCAN Scripture]<br>  he ascended into heaven<br>  and is seated at the right hand of the Father.<br>  [Wicca has no concept of who sits to what side of any father deity.]<br>  He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,<br>  and his kingdom will have no end. [Wicca has no teaching about a half-god judging living or dead, and, in fact, has teachings about who judges the dead...There is also no teaching of a Kingdom to Come in Wicca.]<br>  <br>  We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,<br>  who proceeds from the Father and the Son.<br>  [And Wiccans don't]<br>  With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.<br>  [Which Wiccans don't do.]<br>  He has spoken through the Prophets.<br>  [Who are not Wiccan.]<br>  We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.<br>  [Which Wiccans do not.]<br>  We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.<br>  [Wiccans neither baptize nor sin.]<br>  We look for the resurrection of the dead,<br>  [Wiccans do not.]<br>  and the life of the world to come. <br>  [Wicca does not teach of a coming future world, but of NOW worlds.]<br>  <br>  I am sure there are some who think they are Wiccan and Christian, but they aren't. Either you think Jesus died for your sins (Christianity) or you acknowledge the doctrine of Self-responsibility as a proper person or adult human (Wicca). They are mutually self-exclusive. <br>  <br>  I actually feel sorry for those that do think they are one and the same because every one of them I have met confuses Wicca (Worship of the gods and living by their standards) with magic, and Christianity has a long and perfectly valid tradition of magic that existed BEFORE WICCA ever existed. Here are some books discussing it:<br>  The Magical Writings of Thomas Vaughan:<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Magical-Writings-Thomas-Vaughan/dp/0615149014" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Magical-Writings-T...</a><br>  <br>  Greater Key of Solomon:<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Greater-Key-Solomon-MacGregor-Mathers/dp/142092818X" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Greater-Key-Solomo...</a><br>  <br>  Ancient Christian Magic:<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ancient-Christian-Magic-Marvin-Meyer/dp/0691004587" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Ancient-Christian-...</a><br>  <br>  The Divine Synthesis and Realization of Magic by the Christian Revelation<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Divine-Synthesis-Realization-Christian-Revelation/dp/1425305385/" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Divine-Synthesis-R...</a><br>  <br>  "Christian Wiccans" either have Christianity all wrong or have Wicca all wrong, and that's sad. Many have also been unfairly persecuted, and judge all who oppose their claims as discriminating or being mean when, in fact, they are trying to help.<br>  <br>  <br>  *There are other definitions, but they are specific to sects of Christianity<br>  **<a href="http://www.creeds.net/ancient/nicene.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.creeds.net/ancient/nicene.htm</a>|`|lDEGaK7Laa	It's called Christian Wicca, and there are people who practice it, but both Christians and Wiccans don't particularly like it much.

Christianity and Wicca are unfortunately opposites. I do not promote hatred of Wiccans. When it comes to following a belief system you are going to have to choose between the two. You are trying to put a foot on each side of the fence. This will lead to unhappiness. A person should be fully committed to their beliefs, trying to hedge your bets as it were will lead to unhappiness. I pray that you stay with Christian beliefs and respect you for whatever choice you make.|`|AEAxZEveaa	There are many churches that would say no, but I don't think you need to limit your religious views to what a specific denomination of a church says you're supposed to.

If we ever meet aliens they too will have the golden rule, or else have all the personality and individuality of a fire ant and a similar social structure. Meeting something that thinks like a fire ant but uses tools could be very, very bad.<br>  <br>  Back on topic, just because the math behind game theory exists whether you know about it or not does not mean you automatically know about it. What we do have is mirror neurons; we all can feel empathy and we don't have to know why we want to do something to do something.<br>  <br>  It seems to be possible to be only partly aware. Most believers who say morality is impossible without their god definitely feel empathy even if they rationalize with the fear of hellfire.<br>  <br>  It's also possible to turn it off. We are capable of evil. It has occasional evolutionary advantages after all. A little bit of coaxing from an authority figure, a large enough reward...and suddenly those mirror neurons don't seem so important.<br>  <br>  We are what we are. We can always strive to be better, to pass on the reward or ignore the authority figure.|`|jHWpNL9Iaa	Both I think.  The basics like don't kill people, don't steal, etc, I always think of it like, I wouldn't like it if someone did that to me so why would I ever do that to someone else?<br>  <br>  However, like you say, I think the finer points are more nurture.|`|GEfUTyi8aa	instincts are nature.... its our instinct to pro-create... thus we treat one another with some sort of respect as well as not eating our young.... but I also think alot of things are learned... like not stealing... in an uncivilized world we would probably steal from one another.. for survival..... this really has nothing to do with being an atheist..... its about reality..... we are mammals.... we have instinct but we also have a learning capability of what works and what doesnt... somehow the bible got involved... because someone realized they could control the masses out of fear... which is why orginally god was a feared god.. then they realized they had to change that tune a bit... hence the story of jesus...etc.<br>  <br>  interesting subject|`|KhJwOurLaa	Nature is nurture.

Most children raised in a christian family end up being christian, and vice versa. The only way for this cycle to be broken is for an individual to question his religion, and see what other alternatives there are to it. Their is also the fact that natural selection has let those who are brought together by religion to survive easily, thus the chain continues.|`|IgHUhZs8aa	Some morals are, in fact, scientifically proven to be nature - such as the instinctive caring for a child upon hearing its cry. (Babylike faces even render a buried instinct to protect, which is why Chihuahuas evolved like they did.) But I think most of it is nurture; if you bring a child up a certain way, with all of the right influences, of course they'd think killing is alright.|`|MTi7r9l6aa	Having been educated on the concept of natural selection, I can say with utmost confidence that the answer is "nature." <br>  <br>  Obviously, mammals are lucky enough to have loving parents which will help after they're born, but an orphan without anyone close to them would probably have similar morals to the average person.|`|m5Q8hJUHaa	I'm not an atheist but I think if you're talking about conscience, guilt, feeling bad when you do something it's nature, because I believe certain social and psychological/neurological traits are passed down in all mammals and other animals to further better the species. I believe though it's nurture if you mean morals as in going to church or being celibate.|`|mlI1YvCnaa	not an atheist but, if I may, I think most Christians would say the opposite, that humans are inherently evil until God saves them, I don't entirely agree with that anymore but that is basically what I was taught although, some would say both because there is some residual good left over from creation.|`|tsLoOCqBaa	I would say almost 100% nurture.<br>  We do inherit certain personality traits from our parents, compassion and emotional traits, through nature. This would help with the development of morality, but not the basic concept of it. <br>  We do not know that some things are right and some are wrong. We must observe and learn from the world around us.<br>  That is why many people are capable of immoral things.|`|91XGHfSaaa	Both. <br>  <br>  Humans are social animals, so we're "hard-wired" for a lot of our social behaviour.<br>  <br>  However, societal influences have an effect on what behaviours are acceptable, and these change over time (social evolution).<br>  <br>  So human behaviour is a combination of nature and nurture.|`|qJkRPhIKaa	not quite sure...<br>  <br>  My mom was my bestfriend growing up yet i turned out very mature. more than 90% of my highschool. I dont drink, dance around looking for wanna bes, dont pose, nothing like that..<br>  <br>  Yet kids who have strict parents turn out to be horrible. <br>  <br>  It can be vice versa as well but i dont really know. Maybe a combination of both?|`|3mDvjCa8aa	Both of course. Although I think morality leans more toward nurture than nature. If you are raised by racists, you have a much higher chance of ending up racist, etc. More is learned than I think anyone wants to admit.|`|MSWgVj4Maa	Nurture for this atheist. You only have to take a quick trip around the globe to see the variation in morality .

It is estimated the gates weighed 6 tons. The man's name was Samson. Oh, he also killed 1,000 trained soldiers with a dried up jaw bone of a donkey. Samson could have ruled of any roman, but God did not deem it wise to rule over men by brute strength.<br>  <br>       Jesus once gave a man great wealth, so much so that silver was counted as nothing. he gave him wisdom also, so much that a queen left her nation and traveled for several years to be in his presence. His name was Solomon, and God saw that men rebelled from the rich and great wisdom lead the flesh away.<br>  <br>       As God watched men he saw that the best way to be a king was to be a servant and respect man's free will. So he chose to become as nothing so we could become everything.<br>  <br>       Please notice it is said "Jesus the carpenter's SON" not Jesus the carpenter. He left his earthy training when his heavenly father called him. Also note that a carpenter takes a log that should be cast into the fire and recreates a use full life for the dead wood.|`|ADvTw5Jsaa	Well interesting Question . But what was the need for so great, powerful romans to sue a undernourished carpenter. What made them fear him!!!|`|1eR2DadOaa	Jesus could have escaped, but He obeyed God..<br>  <br>  It would have been easier to nail up hercules than Jesus if Jesus had tried.|`|EMo8shXHaa	No one can answer that because that would be a whole different story, hercules wasn't chosen and hercules isnt real ok? ok!|`|jNQ0BhODaa	if hercules and chris did exist they'd end up killing each because they claim that their the real god|`|JZtY6Ymmaa	I dont knw but the sure would nail im on a bed<br>  <br>  <br>  Next question please!|`|AA10657034	WOW......|`|jWheN9ySaa	It wouldn't have been a problem for me.

I think the Pope himself should get down on all fours and tearfully admit that the Romans killed Jesus (and no you can't blame the Chinese).<br>  Moreover, the Romans have for many years attempted to implicate the Jews.<br>  They even had the Baptists believing them for a time.  This is despicable.<br>  .|`|udUzdU7Raa	I think it is irrelavent who the nails were bought from. You obviously don't understand that Jesus' death was necessary for the salvation of all people.<br>  <br>  Besides, just before he died, Jesus said: "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do". He was asking God to forgive everyone, because they didn't fully understand what they were doing. So that question is irrelavent!!|`|AA10657034	Possible...|`|MSWgVj4Maa	Trade with each other yes, buying the nails I highly doubt it.|`|skm6LCq4aa	no
zhMTY2Pbaa	The bad things in the world are not actions of God but of man, of us. The terrible things that happen in this world mainly are caused by other people. You may ask, why does God not stop all these bad things from happening, but where would the freewill be? God created us free beings, free to make our own choices in a world he created and sometimes this means that the choices that other people make will affect us. God is a loving God, God does intervene in the world but he does not control what we do. Even though sometimes it seems he is not there, he is, but then again, its funny how many people want nothing to do with God until they are in some situation or tragedy in which they have no control. He doesn't seem there to you because your not wanting to look for him, your rejecting him before even knowing him, and because of that you mistake the tragedies caused by man as God's punishment against us. Actually God loved the world so much that he sent his own Son into the world, and what did most people do, they rejected him, they spat in his face and they crucified him, yet He let them and because of him dying we can receive Salvation through Him. He sent his only son, to try to save everyone, not just the good people, the criminals, the murderers:<br>  <br>  For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.<br>  <br>   For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved<br>  <br>  John 3:16-17<br>  <br>  and the terrible things in the old testament were because God's people (the Jews) were disobeying him when he was leading them out of Egypt.  They were some of the only people with the true message of God, He had to show his wrath and power because they would have strayed away if not.|`|jwKOANhpaa	Why?

Is God to be blamed for that?<br>  <br>  <br>  If you look at the "horrible things He did in the Old Testament" (some examples of what you're referring to would be nice) it was to punish people for their sins and to make known God's wrath concerning those sins. What good is a law or what power does it have unless their is punishment or consequences for breaking it? Do we not have punishments and consequences for people who break our laws? Try speeding, you'll quickly see what I mean.<br>  <br>  God cannot be blamed for punishing sinful behavior. In the Old Testament He sometimes pleaded with people for hundreds of years before He finally had to act and administer punishment.<br>  <br>  You need to remember that Satan will try to corrupt or destroy anything God does. He will tempt people to sin, and then will have people blame God when He punishes them for those sins. Few blame Satan for the problems he creates, they always blame God.<br>  <br>  Think about what you said from this perspective and see if you still feel the same way.<br>  <br>  If you wish, please write me and we can chat more about this.|`|SRFfK0BPaa	and who are we to Judge Gods actions, he is God<br>  he gave us life, he could also take it away<br>  <br>  what ever God does is for a better purpose, sometimes we can't understand certain things|`|pVrNJmgpaa	god is a capitalist, it says it in genesis.|`|EMo8shXHaa	OK GET YOUR FACTS STRAIGHT!

He is not someone that just goes around making life perfect, nor is he evil either. God is perfect. He knows the past, present and future. And, he knows what is best for the individual. People do not just die of hunger. People die of cancer, they are murdered, etc. God knows when is time for someone to leave the Earth. Honestly, in a third-world country, what good is it for those people to live? Their lives would be painful - most of them actually die of AIDS and HIV. Which more cruel? God taking away their lives so they can go to heaven and live with him, or for him to let them live in those third-world countries, struggling to survive, having to work all day, everyday, with very little or no food, barely any shelter, no education, and a government that is ruining their country. You are not seeing the biger picture. God is doing them a favour. Now, as for those who die of things like cancer, it too is their time to go. God has work for us to do in heaven - not manual labour, but more errands. His work was to create the world for us so that we can have experience and be perfected. When we die, we go on to help him do that. Angels, who visit people, bringing messages, etc, are those who have gone before us and are running the Lord's errand. There is life after death. If you believe in God, you believe in that, too.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry, but your argument is totally flawed!!|`|duU7UhATaa	So we can have chance to give and share ours.<br>  Because what we have now, is a gift from god, and He wants us to share this gift to other.|`|IARfxiHeaa	wat r u talkin about GOD does exists if u read your word u will see that he does and if u go to church to|`|dFfQxy92aa	Death is not a bad thing.

But the results are not statistically significant because of the small numbers of patients involved and the amount of difference in outcomes between prayer recipients and controls.  In other words, you couldn't clearly tell it made a difference.<br>  <br>  But in larger studies, even a small effect can be demonstrated.  Unfortunately in studies large enough to have any statistical power, no effect has ever been demonstrated.  Controls do as well as those prayed for.<br>  <br>  So it seems prayer does not help the sick.  In one study, patients who knew they were being prayed for fared worse than controls and patients who did not know they were being prayed for.  The latter two groups had similar outcomes.

Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what! <br>  <br>  Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|QHUycGFvaa	It's a free gift from God to you!

SDDgbtQ4aa	In these rough economical times, most everyone is going through some rough spots with finances and work (which can put a huge strain on relationships.)  Heck, I'm struggling while my newlywed best friends just bought a great house - so I did a little living vicariously through them - helping them paint a couple rooms and clean and decorate and stuff in celebration of their happiness - it was fun and it did a world of good for me in helping me get through a tough time.  And it made me feel special in that they wanted me to help with their new place, they wanted me there to share in something important to them.  <br>  <br>  Sharing the good news of your promotion may actually help some of your peers feel a little better - like not everything everywhere is going down the tubes and there is a little spark of hope right there, knowing someone who is getting through this and doing okay - that they can get through it too.  Of course - presentation is everything - if you're going "na na na na na, I got a promotion and you lost your job!", well, that wouldn't be very nice.  ;)<br>  <br>  Try to just be there for moral support to those close to you who are going through the rough patches - but don't feel guilty because you aren't in the same situation.  I'm sure you can still empathize with them knowing things aren't always easy.  But you deserve what you've worked for.|`|PEs9OXCmaa	Try prayer, then patience, add to patience faith, add to faith thanks!<br>  I say that to say this GOD never put more on His children anymore then they can bear, He did not say this to the apostle for his sake only<br>  but unto all who will be justified by Christ through faith or by faith<br>  <br>  2Cr 12:9 And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.  <br>  <br>  Let us enter into His rest!
mwdwDOaWaa	Hello bhai,<br>  <br>  War is not always a devastating tool, sometimes it is also the tool for revolution and changes, a necessary evil that had have shaped the human history.When diplomacy fails, force takes its place. That is the way of the things. <br>  <br>  What Mr. Gandhi accomplished was really extraordinary and unique. However, the reason for his success was not non-violence only. As you said, the Colonial powers won the WWII, at a great Price. When Mr. Gandhi launched the movement, the British were facing war on 2 fronts Germany (Europe/Africa) and Japan (Asia). If the Indian population rebelled at that time like that of 1857, the British couldn't have stopped the juggernaut. India would have won its independence.<br>  <br>  There was one vital weakness in Mr. Gandhi attitude, he tried to please at the sects (Hindus, Moslems, and others). By this he alienated some important people. His liberal attitude, required that people should always be honest,simple,  truthful and tolerant. But in reality humans are always required to be controlled by a strong government. Liberalism brings chaos to society. I think some greedy, powerful people took advantage of this liberal ideals and corrupted it.<br>  <br>  Violence is never a complete solution to conflicts, we have seen Yassir Arafat. He started his career by terrorism and violence, but in the later part he used negotiation and diplomacy to solve his nation's problems.<br>  <br>  'Sab chalta hai attitude all are the product of the non-violence baggage we have on our shoulders.'<br>  <br>  I trend to disagree. Indian were learning to live under the rule of Indian leaders for the first time in 150 years. I think the leaders were being liberal to the general public and some corrupt people or people with weak morals took advantage of it. There is always a larger ' predator', hence the governments should be the uncorrupted 'bigger predator', so it can keep small ones in check. <br>  <br>  Given that within 50 years of its Independence, after 400 years of being plundered, is on the road of being a super power. I think India made good progress. Everyone learns from his/her mistakes.<br>  <br>  India was called Golden sparrow' in the 15-16th century and when the British left in 20th century it was a third world country. 1 must wonder what Truly happened in those 400 yrs. It all began with India and her spices, and it must end there.<br>  -----------<br>   Edith 1: What is written there is nothing but a sad sad truth.|`|yZgZJ7s7aa	Son, I think it's time for you to throw away your Ghandi posters and open up a can of f*cking whoop *** on some corrupt officials.|`|A9EydXySaa	if you want peace prepare for war|`|syMxQEF3aa	Sometimes, war is the answer.|`|OANl5PPoaa	dear ,according to my experience,non-violence is the only answer in any kind of  situation wth open and clear mind that is keeping you aware of all points. when finally one  recognize the real enemy then the action of non-violence can turn towards the operation of the real sick person.please conciderd all the friends of that enemy  are all enemies because without finishing them you can not complete the action of non-violence.like a doctor is always believe in peacefull and non-violence places in the hospitals for the operation. that,s what lord krishana did or in ramayana same thing happend.recognize the real enemy of the peace and punish them until they must understand ,what was their faults. so related operations that completes non-violence position is all comes under one action that is non-violence. thanks.
b660102b2fc9513dd1125d9410450d92aa	I am anti-abortion. Women abort babies everyday because the law says they can. With the advancement of the medical technologies they will be able to piece together their babies like picking out items for their new car, or like furniture for their new house. It is not about the rights of the human body. Abortions prove that point. It is all about creating their own GOD POWER over life. They want the power to declare themselves God and rule the world through genetic selections. A super race as it were. When Hitler died, horrifically enough his ideals did not. I wish they had.|`|47l1Sumeaa	It's not right and I find that quite unacceptable. However, I strongly believe abortion should be a woman's choice and a woman's choice ONLY.|`|wkmdKFxJaa	Idk, I wouldn't want to raise a gay baby in a country full of baptists that treat gays like their great-grandparents treated slaves|`|f6vLKIFZaa	I don't see how you could tell an abotable fetus was going to be gay.|`|py57svUyaa	I think that if we get as far as being able to recognize sexual orientation in fetuses we probably will be able to genetically change it.  So it is more likely people may choose to have their child 'changed' to heterosexual. Or not. <br>  <br>  No, I do not think sexual orientation is acceptable reason at all.|`|OsQkpljLaa	Fisrt off, I dont believe anybody is born gay. Its a choice. And no, I dont believe that they should have the right to kill an unborn child simply because of its sexuality. If your child came to you and said "I'm gay" you wouldn't kill them. Its the same thing. It's still taking a human life|`|1Z13L9h2aa	To tell you, I was born straight.<br>  I always had crushes on boys. <br>  But then 3 years ago, I met a girl who..turned me gay. <br>  So you really cant determine if a baby is homo or bi or straight.<br>  May that be possible, views on abortion would still be the same.|`|9KBqN0KAaa	No, that's a different topic - homophobia.<br>  <br>  pro-choice people wouldn't care about sexuality anyways.|`|6aIuZZi7aa	I believe women have the right to abort any fetus, regardless of its sexual orientation. And I think you meant to ask those who are pro-life, not pro-choice.|`|3mDvjCa8aa	I don't think abortion should be used as a contraception in general, especially selective contraception. No one does. That doesn't mean you can take away everyone's choice.|`|QrBReRQbaa	Now, itz your turn,<br>  <br>  A woman should always have the right to choose what is best for her<br>  circumstances.|`|LsJqpTWsaa	If it bothers them that much... ya.|`|WsnJnqpdaa	I don't know why you think pro-lifers would be for that.  Do you see pro-lifers also campaigning to shoot gays in the head?  No.<br>  <br>  And it's not just religious, or the homophobic, who are pro-life.  This isn't merely a religious cause, it's a moral issue that effects everyone depedant on their personal sense of right and wrong.|`|rGEZup0Zaa	I feel that reason would be despicable.<br>  <br>  That said, it's still the woman's body, still her choice.<br>  <br>  Since I don't think there is anything wrong with being gay or lesbian, that facet of your question is a moot one to me.|`|AEAxZEveaa	It would seem to me that most of the people who would be against having a gay child would be in the pro-life camp. although I shouldn't say that, I'm pro-life and don't think there's anything wrong with being gay.

DqmMW2tcaa	I agree. Does someones bad behaviour become less of a sin because they have repented?|`|8P64hgL3aa	Yes you're right. people say we can do this but we will be forgiven. There's a verse exactly that say these people are evil and and they won't be forgiven. For example the israeli genecide of the palestinians. extremist jews in that country use religion to justify killing innocent people. Or bush and Chaney that used religion to justify the wars and war crimes. Or Ben Laden who uses religion as an excuse to kill innocent people all over the world. All extremists are evil.|`|8BBvzs9Jaa	Jesus said, the mere thought of a sin is already considered committed a sin. Why does someone wants to commit a sin when you knew it is wrong to do it? The only answer to this is they do not understand the love of God for them. Apostle Paul said how can you continue to be in sin when you are already dead to sin? For example, a grave criminal who is repentant in their heart will rejoice at a second chance. Naturally they will turn over a new leaf, away from the crimes. For someone to ask the question (can you repent for a sin before you commit it?) caused me to think how repentant are they in their heart. <br>  <br>  I agree with you that only God knows what is forgiven and what isn't. You don't use religion to justify or rationalise your bad behaviour. God will know a repentant heart and judge accordingly.
WCBSGuplaa	Within three months after meeting my wonderful lady and I both realized that we were meant to be together, even though there is a large difference in our ages. Although we've not really discussed it we both know that it would be very difficult to love anyone else should one of us should die prematurely. I, personally, do not think I could ever love again if I should lose her. In fact I think I would die from grief soon after.|`|SiPGcBnYaa	i think there's like a handful|`|U7sBZKUuaa	Yep, and I hope I got her right this time.

You don't want to be stuck going to a laundry mat for years.|`|KwNpyp3saa	I agree with philo. If you can live without these or have w/d hookup then go for it. What are the comps?

QGBYOLIxaa	I'm a firm believer of Metaphysics and Astrology, and in all that they always mention somewhere that nothing is predestined. All the things that happen are influences of the planets or the path that we pave for ourselves. You don't have to do anything that the alignment of your planets say you will do, but you have to fight against it REAL HARD! it's like a smoker that wants to quit. Honestly, who really liked smoking when they first started? No one. One who starts smoking is due to peer pressure from friends when we are young because we want to "fit in" or be "cool". But once you have been influenced for so long and have made it a habbit, it's hard to break. If you really worked at it and you really wanted to you could though. I hope this helped. ^_^|`|IgHUhZs8aa	I don't believe in fate. I hate the idea of predestination because I want to be able to control my own life. Knowing the future has one of two effects: it either changes immediately upon knowledge, rendering the knowledge useless, or it sets in stone so that the one glimpse you do have is definitely going to happen, no matter what. The only problem about not believing in predestination is the depressing possibility of never finding a 'soulmate'.
oY4vwdjVaa	Only if your back is really bothering you. But you can always go to a chiropractor or a gym and help keep your shoulders strong.|`|HH90Eghaaa	No, I only recommend breast reduction surgery to people that are suffering from back problems because of it! I think you are gorgeous; but that's not for me to decide!|`|AA12006309	It's up to you if you want to get reduction surgery - it's your body, our opinions don't mean anything.  You're the one who has to live with you, your body, and your scars.<br>  <br>  I am a 38DD, and I'm 5'7".  When I get the money and insurance, I'll be getting a reduction, because that's what I want for my body.<br>  <br>  I can say the younger you are, the more elastic your tissues tend to be, you heal faster, and scar less.  Good luck.|`|OsY0lmTCaa	I'd have to see you to know for sure, but it doesn't sound like it. Like everyone else is saying, if there's no medical need for a reduction, I wouldn't suggest it.|`|decWPAHkaa	Well what's the size of your waist and hips? Why would you want a reduction If you're not having back aches or shoulder pains due to your breast size.|`|xUCXXb73aa	don't have surgery be yourself|`|86pzq89Xaa	girl that's a personal choice...but given your petite stature, I would look into it for health reasons (like back problems later in life)
csUUr11gaa	Don't listen to Alucard.  You should feel free to get involved with whomever you want.  Also, it's perfectly normal to be attracted to other guys and still be straight.  I have some very straight male friends that can appreciate a hot a guy when they see one (it's often comes hand in hand with jealousy, lol).  Although from the sound of it, It seems like you are sexually/romantically attracted to other men.  This doesn't necessarily mean that you're gay, because there's a possibility that you might be bisexual.  You said that you like guys a little more than girls, but I'm assuming that you may still be somewhat attracted to girls.<br>   <br>  I think that you should do some thinking and consider  what it would actually be like being with other guys.  Does it sound appealing or interesting?  Does it sound like something you would like to try?  If so I would recommend some experimentation (either now or later).  College is a great place to experiment and re-invent yourself to establish a unique identity, whatever it may be.<br>  <br>  This realization about possibly being homosexual can be scary.  All the sudden, you may have discovered a part of yourself that you didn't even know existed.  It's a little unsettling at first.  Just give it time to settle and allow your mind relax so you can really think about this.  Also know that you don't have to figure this all out right now.  Feel free to just question, humor the idea, or experiment.<br>  <br>  Regarding your girlfriend, (if I were you) I wouldn't break up with her right now.  First of all, you sound like you're breaking up with her soon when you leave for college. You also seem to care about her enough to consider her feelings and not want to hurt her ( meaning you might like girls too).  Most importantly, you're not lying to her.  You don't identify as a gay male at this point in your life.  You might even discover that you're bisexual later on, in which you are still not being dishonest.  In this moment, you are just opening up your mind to the possibility that you might be attracted to men.<br>  <br>  Basically, take your time considering your feelings.  Don't rush your thought process, give your brain time to relax, and honestly address the situation. You probably don't want to break up with your girlfriend unless you've actually discovered that you're only attracted/ want to be with other men.  Good luck!|`|qXqi67ZBaa	your not necessarily gay they say you dont know what your missing ntil you try try and do something with another guy if nothing work and it feels gross or wrong your staight if it does you might be bi if you still like firls and as for that first guy he is just a stupid mother f u ck ing catholic son of a b   it c  h  who needs to shut there fuc  king trap and go shove a bible up there a   ss ... but im not going to get into religion....... if you turn out gay your not necessarily going to hell but thats not the point the point is try it out you cant really know you are or like something unless you try it out|`|PzkGIlPRaa	Actually I think that your attraction to men is a reaction to you unsuccess with women. Monkey's will often times go to the other sex in order to serve there sexual needs when a female is not present. No your not gay your just frustrated with the other sex once you have steady sex from a woman all those gay thoughts should go away.|`|36a547afe26601e8d97563dd0babb0aeaa	honey i don't think your gay i think you are bisexual because you are attracted to men and women and there's nothing wrong with that|`|d0WaYTeGaa	If you like guys and girls you are bisexual. Why you're wasting your time dating her when you both know you're going to break up, I will never know. Break it off now and try meeting someone who is already at the college you're going to be attending, be it a guy or girl.|`|MRvwEnB0aa	If you keep pumping your head with gay porn, etc you'll just keep thinking gay gay gay and it'll never stop.Just take control of your life.  Put things in their place. Then you'll have the mind to decide what you really want. You're not anything that you don't want to be.|`|GGf3XRBCaa	Stop rushing to figure it all out. Meet and date different kinds of people - male and/or female. You'll know soon enough where you fall on the  Kinsey Scale.|`|ELZfN4hzaa	Try experimenting, you never know until you try! =]]

I4JyxwSZaa	Plain and simple.<br>  <br>  You dont!  <br>  <br>  I dont mean to sound like a major biiiiatch however..<br>  <br>  Unless you are of the same sex and interested in finding out if they want to date you, knowing is really none of your business. If that person feels like telling you are they are gay, that is there option. I feel asking personal questions without any need to know is truly rude.|`|NQ3eETlYaa	Flirt with him and see how he reacts: Does he flirt back?

Let "the other person" tell him about you and that that guy (you) would like to hook up with him.  Make sure that he can get hold of you.  If he is interested he will make the next move.  If not and he says something just make it out as if someone else is trying to create **** in your life.|`|qOZashBYaa	It usually is awkward to ask someone if they are gay. But usually you can tell by their mannerisms. but if you have to ask, you could even act sexy around him or something like that, and see if you get his attention.|`|NFUJAOtTaa	are you gay? there was that so hard|`|Vzog61V5aa	have one of ur girl friends ask him trust me u will find out make sure shed hot|`|pyQLjKanaa	It's always extremely awkward to ask a guy if he's gay.  Sometimes it's obvious, sometimes it's very subtle, and do keep in mind if you ask the wrong guy, it could result in a very serious confrontation (if he's straight and offended, or if he's a closeted gay guy and not ready to come out).  In my experience, it's often better to be the person who comes out first.  If he already knows you're gay, that's not an issue (and it suggests he's at least tolerant of gay people).<br>  <br>  Be very careful how you word it if you ask him directly.  I wish I could give more specific advice, but your situation is a bit vague.  These situations do need to be dealt with very delicately and often in a manner specific to the particular situation.<br>  <br>  What makes you think he's gay?  There are a lot of straight guys with some gay mannerisms.  It's not always easy to tell.  I'd say the best evidence is if you go somewhere with him with some hot shirtless guys.  If his eyes seem to be drifting towards the guys (which is a bit of an irresistible response) he's probably gay, or at least bisexual.  I've been "figured out" through that by chance.|`|uhvKLEgGaa	Just go up to him and tell him you want to ask him something but you're afraid it might offend him. He'll prob ask u what it is and then you can ask him, don't beat around the bush. Just go for it. I already did that to a couple of friends who hadn't come out yet and it turned out they were gay which was disappointing cus I had a crush on them, but we have a good friendship and I still love each of them and I wont change the way things are for anything.|`|ELZfN4hzaa	I just want to say I LOVE how blunt you were about this.

If you are not ready for a relationship, then there is no reason to rush!|`|dkoGI9nfaa	What makes you think you have to have a boyfriend to be gay?  If you have had any relationship with a guy, even a one night stand, you are gay.  If you fantasize about being sexually involved with guys yu are gay.  It is not a crime to be gay at least not any more.|`|uhvKLEgGaa	So you're open-minded thats cool, I know a couple of ppl who are. For u ppl who said he's gay, you ppl seriously don't know what open-minded is. Anyways you don't have to date a girl to prove you're not gay many ppl haven't dated in years it doesn't mean they're interested in the same sex. I'm 20 I haven't dated since highschool I hang round more gay and les ppl than straight ones, but that doesn't mean i'm going to date a girl to prove i'm not a les.....i'm also kind of open-minded but haven't told any of my les friends yet cus they reaction would freak me out since some of them have already ask me out and I said no. BY THE WAY in case some ppl don't know open-minded means to be straight but open to try things with the same sex cus you're curious or whatever|`|d0WaYTeGaa	If you're not gay then perhaps you should sit your mom down and explain to her that you know that if you were gay she would be ok with it and you love her for that, but you're not.

6g97hxCCaa	Whoever is Prince of Wales is also titled the Duke of Cornwall.  As such any wife of the Prince of Wales gets the titles of Princess of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall (among many others).  Therefore anyone who has been married to a Prince of Wales will have also had the title of Duchess of Cornwall.  Of course Princess of Wales is a more senior title and so tends to be the title most wives of Princes of Wales have used.  Strictly speaking Camilla is the current Princess of Wales, but she has chosen to use the less senior title of Duchess of Cornwall as the title of Princess of Wales is still heavily associated with Diana.|`|ro5vFj9Aaa	princess diana|`|Iqp3ZUAlaa	The last Princess of Wales was,Diana,preceded by Queen Mary,wife of George V.And before that,it was Queen Alexandra,wife of Edward VI.All Princess of Waleses are also Duchess of Corwall,Duchess of Rothesay,Countess of Chester,Countess of Carrick,Baroness of Renfrew,Lady of the Isles and Princess and Great Steward of Scotland.|`|dswiHNVRaa	The first Duchess of Cornwall was Joan "The Fair Maid of Kent", who, in October 1361, married Edward, the Black Prince.<br>  <br>  Before the present Duchess, the most recent Duchess of Cornwall had been Diana, Princess of Wales, from her marriage in 1981 to Charles, Prince of Wales until their divorce in 1996. During this period, she was more usually styled The Princess of Wales, as have been most Duchesses of Cornwall.<br>  <br>  Before Camilla the only Duchesses of Cornwall actually to be styled as such were Caroline, wife of the future King George II, who was styled “Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Cornwall and Cambridge” from August 1st to September 27th 1714; and Mary, wife of the future King George V, who was styled “Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Cornwall and York” from January 22nd to November 9th 1901. In both cases they were known by the title for only a few months between their respective father-in-law's accession to the throne and their husband's creation as Prince of Wales.|`|BI5H7shlaa	most probably all members of the royal whorehouse society,for charles to take his pick

It sounds like you still have feelings for this person at some level so I would recommed you contact them and perhaps you can begin talking again which might give you the opportunity to decide if you still want to pursue the person. Put yourself in his shoes, he was talking to someone and then all of a sudden no contact from you. You might want to take a step and apologize to him right up front and tell him why you miss him- you might be surprised in a good way on his response.

I've heard of people being mollested as children and they turned out straight, but it affects/effects (I get the two confused and don't feel like looking it up) people differently. I was mollested as a child and am gay but I don't think that's why I'm gay. I'm sorry he did that to you, it was wrong of him, as it was wrong of me to date the girls I did even though I knew I was gay. Hope your future is bright.
