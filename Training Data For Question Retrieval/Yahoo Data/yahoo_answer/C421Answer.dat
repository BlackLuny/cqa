Since you have severe allergies, I think it would be a good idea to purchase a plastic mattress cover and pillow case covers.  The are also ecological friendly sprays to help control these pests.

5Ey2siHNaa	Hey, I live in Leander too!!!  We recently went to Home Depot (on 1431 & Parmer) and they told us to plant Plum or Lemon trees- both do well on our bedrock of limestone (what- 2 feet under our dirt!?!?!).  They have both.

Check out the website I listed.  Their candles are 100% soy wax which burns up to 50% longer and hold up to 8% scent oils (as opposed to 5% for "regular" candles).  Also, they burn clean...you end up with a clean jar...you could rinse it in warm soapy water and use it again...no black soot!!!  I will tell you this...there is no such thing as a triple scented candle so if someone tries to sell you one it is bogus.  Wax only holds so much scent and that is it.  Check them out they are extremely affordable too which makes them AWESOME!!!  They also are very accomodating.  If you don't see something on their website, just email them.

I buy candles right after holiday seasons when they mark down "holiday scents".  I recently found big Christmas jar candles one week after Christmas marked down 90%!  I got ten of them for 90 cents each!  I do this all the time.  Also with jar candles I keep the lid on them when I am not burning them.  I also snuff them out by putting the lid on them to avoid that horrible "blown out candle smell"
AA12092525	My first experience with a silverfish, not to be confused with a silver fish, was in the shower where they're commonly found. There I was, under the warmth of the spray, soaking in the mist and humidity while I gently soaped my soiled body. Oblivious to everything, I felt a sudden wriggling under the arch of my foot. So naturally, being an overweight hairy dude, I jumped, dropped my rag and screamed like a little girl. Luckily I was alone in the house so no damage was done to my street cred. Unfortunately for the silverfish, however, he became silversquish and sailed away down the drain. These nasty little insects, known to entomologists as Lepisma saccharina are even more primitive than the cockroach. Silverfish infestations are usually small and take quite awhile to grow. Once established though, they can make for stubborn houseguests. This article will give you some hints on silverfish prevention, silverfish control and silverfish extermination. <br>  <br>  This web site gives some great tips!!!!!|`|AA10429934	Mary, I'll assume that you mean Silverfish.  If that's the case, and you're not going to like my answer, the only solution is to clean everything like your've never cleaned before, then go back and do again.  Silverfish thrive in an environment where the is dirt, mold, "dust bunnies",any residue fron feces, plant or animal residue, practically anything that might be construed as dirt.  If the surface is washable, use a double dose of detergent.  Wash all your clothing and hang it outside in the sunshine and fresh air.  Keep this up. for at least six weeks, the gestation period for two generations of silverfish.|`|OiXGvivcaa	Sprinkle baking soda in all your dark, damp places. It won't get rid of them entirely, since there are always going to be areas you don't think of or can't get to. But I bet it would cut them down a little. If I were a silverfish, I know I wouldn't want to be mucking around in baking soda.

Son tronc est lisse, ses feuilles palmÃ©es, alternes et pÃ©tiolÃ©es, aux bords dentelÃ©s. Les fleurs sont groupÃ©es en Ã©pis rameux terminaux ou latÃ©raux, rÃ©unissant parfois les fleurs males et femelles.

Le ricin prÃ©fÃ¨re lesclimats tempÃ©rÃ©s mais s'accomode aussi des lieux un peu frais.

Cela les for?ait Ã  garder le lit au chaud, mais servait surtout Ã  Ã©vacuer toutes les impuretÃ©s intestinales. Et ce n'Ã©tait pas fini car aprÃ¨s la purge d'huile, suivait celle complÃ©mentaire et obligatoire du sulfate de soude, dit "sel Ã  purger", trÃ¨s amer, pendant 3 jours Ã©galement.  <br>  ATTENTION : <br>  Les graines de ricin sont vÃ©nÃ©neuses.

omegLbOAaa	play around with the Sherwin Williams color visualizer to help you imagine how the colors will look together. It is the best paint visualizer on the web, imho.

You can literally spend hours:<br>  <a href="http://www.sherwin.com/visualizer/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sherwin.com/visualizer/</a><br>  <br>  I think "anew gray" (# 7030) might be a good choice.<br>  <br>  You can take a photo of your house & upload it to the makeover gallery on this website:<br>  <a href="http://www.roomvues.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.roomvues.com/</a><br>  You can get color suggestions & for $5 they'll photoshop them onto your room so that you can get an idea of what it will look like.|`|mP0LLMVjaa	Be adventurous!

You can't go wrong with choosing safe colours like that.|`|pbZywicUaa	The tan color is very neutral and can be used as a beautiful back drop to add splashes of color with your accessories. The only concern I see about the brown wall is, how is your lighting in that room? if it's dark already, the brown wall will make it even darker, and seem a bit depressing. If there is a lot of light that comes in,or you have a lot of lighting in the room, then the wall would be BEAUTIFUL and rich! Make sure you add colorful accessories to the wall to bring out the depth of it, such as wall art or a large mirror hanging over the fireplace with a silver frame. This would reflect the remainder of the room.<br>  Also add a splash of color with your pillows and a rug under your coffee table. Colorful art on the walls, large colored candles in groupings of 3 with polished nickel candle holders and polished nickel lamps and picture frames with friends and family to add dimension and a bit of bling to the room. Have fun with this, you can do it. Hope this helps...|`|KIKUBbT6aa	Painting one wall in the living room makes the room look bigger.

aYLdSTNPaa	Moonflowers are nocturnal bloomers, perfect for night owls and late night strollers. After sunset, these huge white flowers bloom and glow all night in the moonlight. Then, as the sun rises, they close their fragrant blooms. <br>  <br>  Moonflowers are a vining plant, and can grow as much as 12-18 feet in a single year. They are perennial in their native tropical homes, and used as annuals in more northerly areas. <br>  <br>  Moonflower plants are prolific climbers with attractive leaves. Make sure to plant them where they can climb quickly towards the moon. Plant them along patios and sidewalks where people are likely to be in early evening hours. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  Propagation: <br>  <br>  Moonflowers are grown from seeds. Sow Moonflower seeds directly into your flower garden. <br>  <br>  Sow seeds early in the season after all danger of frost. Cover seeds with 1/4" soil. They can also be started indoors 3-4 weeks before the last frost to get a jump start on the season. Water thoroughly once. They germinate easily and will grow quickly. <br>  <br>  Thin or space your plants to at least 6" apart. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  How to Grow Moonflower Plants: <br>  <br>  Moonflower plants like full to partial sun during the daylight hours. You will like the fact that Moonflower thrive in poor, dry soils. That makes them useful in areas where many other popular plants just won't grow. It also makes them easy to grow with little care or attention. Just plant them, and away they grow! <br>  <br>  Add mulch around the plants for appearance and to keep weeds down. Fertilizer can be applied, but is usually not needed. <br>  <br>  Moonflower are susceptible to frost. They may survive the first light frost with only a little damage. Moonflowers are most often planted near a house or building. So, a light frost may kill the plants away from the house, yet spare your Moonflowers for another day. They will not survive a hard frost or freeze. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  Insect and Disease: <br>  <br>  Insects and disease problems are not a major problem. If problems occur, treat early with organic or chemical insect repellents and fungicide|`|9545a4ddb6073ec8eff382149371b038aa	Just at night!

sI8vLjjZaa	For a concrete slab, ceiling insulated double brick and tile house with shaded windows you need 120Watts per square meter of floor space. <br>  <br>  Thus an 8kW (8,000Watt) split system A/C can do 8,000W/120W = a room of 67 square meters of floor space maximum. If the room is bigger than this then you can use two split systems to do it.<br>  <br>  Generally for domestic applications an 8kW split system is about as big as they get. You can get much larger units that this but they are generally for commercial use due to them being considered too noisy for domestic applications.<br>  <br>  Here is a guide that can help you pick an efficient A/C.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.energyrating.gov.au/appsearch/air_srch.asp?sort=[New+SRI+Cool]+DESC%2C[New+SRI+Heat]+DESC&list=basic&Elec=&CUses=&HUses=&Years=&type=Reverse+Cycle&Inst2=all&Inst=all&Out=all&brand=All&B1=SEARCH" rel="nofollow">http://www.energyrating.gov.au/appsearch...</a>|`|2uZXCyeBaa	Great answer Loony, but Belarus:  don't forget that split systems are only meant for one room applications since closed doors will stop air from circulating.  The system will help, but you'd need to have the correct amount of cooling power AND leave all of your doors open to effectively use this type of air conditioner.  I have a through-the-wall air conditioner in my apartment and it works great in the living room, dining room, and kitchen... i could hang a side of beef from a hook next to my couch.  But if I haven't propped my door open for about an hour beforehand, my bedroom is like a sauna when I go to bed.  Just something to consider.

Am Ende jeden Waschprogramms gibt es den Schleudergang. Und wenn eben dieser so richtig sch?n in Fahrt ist, ?ffnet sich ein Portal in die Sockendimension.

Wir sind mal davon ausgegangen, dass die Erde das Strafgefangenenlager der Sockendimension ist. Ergo sind die Socken hier um ihre Strafe abzusitzen (oder laufen). So richtige Verbrechersocken mÃ¼ssen dann zu Stinkfu?sportlern und bei feinen DamenstrÃ¼mpfen mÃ¼sste es sich dann um eine Geldstrafenabhockersocke handeln. Wenn diese Stinker od. Fu?schmeichler dann ihre Strafe verbÃ¼?t haben oder Bew?hrung bekommen, kehren sie durch das Dimensionsportal deiner Waschmaschine wieder in ihre eigene Welt zurÃ¼ck. Und wenn eine der o.g.

Then you hook the thread from above through the needle around the bobbin so that it<br>  comes toward you and step on your pedal.

You will feel some "drag"-- this is what keeps the tension on the thread when winding the bobbin.  <br>  Now, if you have a empty bobbin, start the thread as usual on the bobbin-- put it on the bobbin filler and snap it in place-- make sure the thread is around the bump and that the spool is turning the right direction-- and fill the bobbin.  <br>  no problem<br>  good luck

v3xEtuLLaa	What kind of engine do you have?  I have a Tecumseh Snow King engine, and the oil drains out of a metal tube on the right side of the engine.  There is a hex cap that comes off with a wrench.  Run the engine for a couple of minutes prior to changing the oil to make it flow better.  Hope this helps.|`|6YL3s4yVaa	Check your manual for the correct type and viscosity of oil.  There should be a pipe plug near the lowest point of the engine.  place a catch pan below this and remove the plug.  Running the engine for a couple of minutes before hand can make the oil drain easier.  Replace the plug and refill with the correct oil using the dipstick to verify the level.  Too much oil can cause aeration in the oli reservoir and be worse than low oil level.  Dispose of the old oil responsible - don't dump it on the ground or down a storm drain.

If you have a chain link fence around you house, or you could even buy something for them to latch onto.

v3xEtuLLaa	The only type of texture that I would roll on would be a sand finish.  You can buy the sand to mix into your paint, then just roll it on as usual.  If you are using more than one gallon, pour all of the paint into a 5 gallon bucket, pour the sand in, and mix it well, preferably with a mixer on a drill.  This will give you consistent results throughout the room.  Otherwise, spraying is the only way to go.  Use the hopper as Don suggested, but use Topping Compound drywall mud and thin it down.  Hope this helps.|`|944iJNAdaa	I've never seen any rolled-on texture I liked much, as roll-on texture isn't very thick, so it never hides the flaws very well.  Pro's always spray the texture on.  This can be done with an inexpensive hopper gun and an air compressor, and you could rent those at the rental yard.  Everybody has their own way of using and applying texture, but I generally use drywall mud that has been diluted down to pancake batter consistency, spray it on, let it dry a bit, and then a helper follows behind with a trowel and knocks the finish down.  As long as you do the whole wall the same way, it always seems to come out looking good.|`|Lg4cmiL5aa	There are textured paints out there that hide flaws well. I prefer to use med thickness with no grit, but your preference. You can tint to what you want and can do what you want. I have used these paints in my faux finishing and they turn out well. You can hide a lot.Have fun with texturing. With joint compound you can put a much thicker coat if you really need to cover thick mistakes.  The texture on your parents walls should not come off unless it has very thick areas that stick out and has been put down wrong.|`|sqUVjpElaa	I just did this to my bathroom tub surround, and it was very easy.

My cousin and I slept in the backyard in a tent or sometimes just w/ a sleeping bag many night when we were as young as 6 or 7.

Skunks are ones to not annoy as they have a real nasty spray, thats hard to get rid of. You need a bath in tomato juice to do it<br>  Also depending on what area you live in, Arizona has rattle snakes you do not want to tangle with, other places have bears and wolves, they are not people friendly for the most part.

It's just sleeping in a tent.  If you were actually going to camp, you'd be at a camp site with other people camping around you and it's less likely that you'd see wild animals because they tend to avoid people. Animals will also avoid your campsite because they tend to stay away from the smell of fire. They will however come after the smell of food.<br>  If you do venture beyond your back yard, make sure you keep your food in your car.  <br>  <br>  I've camped alone in areas known to have grizzly bears and I never had a problem. Of course I didn't take any food out of my car at that site and I even went to a different picnic area to cook.<br>  <br>  Anytime you are moving around on your roof you are compromising the integrity of your roof and making it more likely to leak.

gwK4jolhaa	As a builder and re-modeler I use both Bher and Sherwin-Williams.<br>  I like both equally as well.They both go on velvety smooth and second coats "burn into " first coats nicely. Both manufactures claim one coat coverage but I almost always recommend two coats because you just get a deeper looking finish.Using high quality brushes and roller covers also makes a big difference in coverage.<br>  Someone mentioned Glidden.

944iJNAdaa	NO, this isn't usual.  I suspect the transformer has shorted out, so be prepared to replace either that or the complete fixture.
n560blqraa	The reason why this is happening is because you did not primer with a thick quality primer like KILZ first to get rid of pre-existing finish first. This gives your paint adhesion when applied. If you don't wish to go back and primer over it and start again. Try this...<br>  <br>  Apply another coat of the semi-gloss paint you used. (apply more coats in areas prone to scratching) With semi-gloss paint, as long as it has been applied with a thick enough coat, you do not need to seal it. The semi-gloss already has protective qualities to it. You cannot apply poly over semi-gloss paint, it will bubble up on you and peel. Consider having a piece of glass or plexi cut for the top of furniture if it's a table or dresser top to prevent from scratches and further damage. Glass can be cut cheaply to your measurements at any home improvement store like Lowes or Home Depot.|`|SVFaXTwQaa	There is no way to seal it the way you would like to.<br>  <br>  The Only way to paint it properly is to start over, sand the piece, prime it with a good primer, then paint it.<br>  <br>  What you have now will only chip and scratch regardless of whatever you top coat it with.
8apA3Rffaa	I used to have carpet that installed ( 7/16 ths rebond ,6# density, to hold up to warranties) and labor for 3 $ a s/f..  Was decent carpet , medium grade,  so I don t know where    and how some people charge..  Carpet , over all is one of the cheaper floorings.  Laminate , going from 1$ a  s/f to 5$ a  s/f   and then labor a top that and the average I ve seen there is 2/3$ a  s/f.. So with a decent laminate and by that I mean one that will carry some manufacturers warranties,  your looking at 5/6$ a  s/f installed..Under layment for laminate , fairly cheap for a basic foam at about 25$ per 100 s/f  roll.. Same with real hard wood , start at 3$ a  s/f and just go up. It all depends on the type of wood and finish.. The labor is about the same for hardwood..  Labor prices can and do vary from area to area , buy I ve found this is an average..    Your general savings is in your labor.  Aside from carpet , most people can do their own laminate/ wood  GL|`|n560blqraa	I own a Home Remodeling Company and can tell you that the average cost of carpeting is about $2.25 a square foot plus, not including your padding or installation costs. The cost of padding alone adds another $2.70 a yard and upwards to $5.40 a yard based upon grade of padding. (thinner or thicker). In addition, add on an average of an additional $139-$300 plus for install depending on carpet size, and how many rooms being carpeted.<br>  <br>  If you are considering hardwood, manufactured hardwood, or laminate...this gives you more options cheaper.<br>  <br>  You can purchase Mohawk flooring laminate(looks like wood, wears beautifully for a fraction of the cost buying it at BIG LOTS, ODD LOTS, Ocean State Job Lots stores for an average of $1.00 a square ft. to $1.59 a square ft. The underlayment can also be purchased here for a massive roll for about $20.00 if you can find a handy man...jack of all trades type or are handy yourself...This can be installed easily and inexpensively. Saving tons of money. Hardwood flooring is much more expensive than carpeting on average costing between $3.00-$9.00 plus a square ft. You can however, opt for manufactured hardwood which costs an average of $3.00-$6.00 per sq. ft. Personally speaking laminate is the way to go for cost effectiveness, ease of install, and ability to hold up long term in high-traffic areas for the money.
bxlYleZkaa	Yes RCDs can be tripped by heavy vibrations. If your neighbour has stopped now and the switch has stopped tripping too then that is probably the answer. If not you will have to get an electrician to check each stage of the circuitry between sockets for faults. You might also find a faulty lamp (bulb) is the cause, again from vibration which might cause the filament to move about too much.|`|dj5LMEvhaa	rcd's work by monitoring any imbalances within the circuitry, if its a rcd main switch then it may not be the sockets, other circuits may be on it, and when that circuit is used it will trip, also insulatin resistance will effect it earth loop etc not just in fixed wiring but with in the protable appliances  with out seeing the issue in more detail i cant give a 100% diagnosis, if it keeps happening will have to be an electrician|`|6adAoU5Naa	A couple of questions may solve this.  Have you bought any new equipment since this happened ?, when does it happen and what is on at the time ?  I have seen it twice in my days that the RCD is faulty, very uncommon but hey

nbWO3IANaa	Go ahead and get what you like, You will not live in that apartment forever, and you want to be happy with your furniture wherever you live.<br>  My in-laws built a pine log cabin with natural wood finish inside, and NONE of their wood furniture was pine. Looked great!<br>  Be sure fabric and wall colors complement both.|`|bhs05edAaa	Yes. Try to match the colors by shades- like really dark gray/brown wood with a light gray/brown finish or a very yellowish pine stain with a yellower dark wood. That way they will go together even if different woods. Take a copy of the cabinet color with you when you pick out your new furniture to compare. You will find something that does not clash. Have fun furniture shopping !
oD3DBOBfaa	Do those bugs look like the picture on the site below? If so, they are bed bugs.<br>  <br>  We used BedBugPowder to get rid of bed bugs when we had a bad infestation years ago. When we bought the powder, the people from the site told us not to use a mattress encasement. Because bed bugs are good at hiding, using a mattress encasement only creates more spots for bed bugs to hide during a day. And they were right.<br>  <br>  Wash your sheets and all the bedding items with hot water and use a steam cleaner on the mattress. Then use the powder on the mattress lightly. <br>  <br>  We got rid of bed bugs with the powder. It is 100% organic and is safe to humans.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|zmpQbBxFaa	heres a picture of a bed bug...maybe it will help you identify what you found...<a href="http://www.the-piedpiper.co.uk/th5f.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.the-piedpiper.co.uk/th5f.htm</a>  if you have bed bugs to be honest, I think professional help if required!! A new mattress IS required!!<br>  <br>  Get hold of a good Lice and Bug spray. the bug killer can be bought anywhere. Spray EVERYWHERE!! Taking special attention to the wooden areas of the room (flooring, skirting and any wooden bed parts).<br>  <br>  Wash EVERYTHING!! If your clothes will allow it, wash them in the hottest water available. But...don't forget that bed bugs can be easily transported via luggage, washing, furniture etc., in other words do not move anything out of the infested area without it first being treated.  Mattress encasings claim to offer protection from bed bugs but to be honest if you think you have found a bug I would treat the whole room with an insectaside and buy a new mattress!!!!|`|7IQ5HZPnaa	One tiny bug? <br>  If you have bed bugs believe me you will have more than one, and have mosquito like looking bites all over your body.<br>  They will trail on the wall like ants to and from the bed in bad cases. <br>  If on the other hand you are itching and and scratching without obvious bites you probably have lice. Head or pubic and your little bug  does sound like lice. <br>  Lice can be treated over time but you have to be diligent about the spray and treating your self to make sure you do not have any nits(eggs) left in your hair or in linens.<br>  If you have bed bugs throw out the mattress you will never get rid of them they thrive on the dead skin cells in your mattress not on the surface.If you have a rug under your mattress throw it out too. Steam clean any carpeting extreme heat of steam could get rid of them. <br>  Good luck!

Some of the better brands are Henredon, Thomasville, Drexel, Lexington, American Drew, Sherrill, Hickory Chair, Harden, even Stanley and Lane. Any stores that carry these will carry the ones I haven't remembered. You will find a lot of lower end furniture in FL because the beach theme is big and lots of bamboo and light wood. Much of this is not bad and will generally hold up. More modern looks are also available but those lines are not such big names in my area up north. Arhaus, West Elm, and Crate and Barrel have some good items at fair prices.  Most of these mentioned have websites where you can browse by room or theme. So they can do some dreaming before they move. Also there is a lot of resale/auction furniture in FL because people move there and downsize or need money in the current economic market. So if they are eclectic in taste, FL is a goldmine for the unusual.|`|a7IiiNDkaa	IKEA?

bf5084d1ec35330c95ff7b7bd883bbffaa	If your existing one is working fine, personally I wouldn't replace it, however there are a couple of things you can do to keep your existing water heater going strong...<br>  <br>  (*****NOTE:  If you're not comfortable doing these, then get help from an outside technician.)<br>  <br>  CLEAN THE TANK OUT<br>  1)  Shut off the water heater (turn off gas or electricity)  (If gas, you may need the assistance of your gas company)<br>  2)  Connect a garden hose at the bottom of the tank and send the other end to a drain or out into the street.<br>  3)  Allow the tank to cool down for about 30 minutes<br>  4)  Open the stopcock to the garden hose and allow about 15 minutes of water to drain through the tank.  (This removes sludge and hard water crystals from the bottom of the tank that have built up over years)<br>  5)  Close the stopcock and remove the garden hose.<br>  6)  Restore the electricity of gas to the water heater.<br>  <br>  <br>  REPLACE THE DIELECTRIC NIPPLE (this collects hard water crystals and can plug up quickly if you have hard water)<br>  1)  Turn off the water coming INTO the tank.<br>  2)  Open a hot water tap in your house somewhere.  Open the pressure relief valve above the tank.<br>  3)  Use a pipe wrench to remove the dielectric nipple and replace it with a new one.<br>  4)  Reclose the pressure relief valve above the tank.<br>  5)  Turn the water back on (coming into the tank).<br>  6)  Close the hot water faucet you turned on previously.<br>  <br>  Again, I stress...If you don't feel comfortable with these tasks, ask a professional because you can get seriously burned.<br>  <br>  In the meantime, if you really have your heart set on replacing the tank, there are more efficient tankless, on-demand, water heater models on the market now.  They come in a box through which water is heated (on demand) when you need it.  Because it only heats the water when you ask for it, you are not paying for the tank to be heated continuously.  This cuts down greatly on electricity or gas.  They are about 3-4 times the cost of an average water heater, (about $800 to $1,300 for the tankless models, versus $250 to $400 for a regular heater) but you'll save that much over it's life span in fuel reduction.|`|88SGoW1Iaa	1 method that is free is 1" black plastic tubing coiled into a 6' diameter circle which sits on your roof which uses the sunlight to heat the tubing and subsequently the water inside. This involves utilizing your existing incoming water pressure to elevate the water to your roof (conventional plumbing) and into the tubes.  After a short period of time, once the water is heated, it can be directed to your current hot water line with a valve. By increasing the length of tubing you can increase the amount of water that is heated. I have seen configurations including 4 coils like the one mentioned above. The only down-side is this is not feasible in certain locations, and bad weather can affect it's efficiency. Therefore this method is only good to supplement your primary source. In regards to products on the market, the gas style instant water heaters are among the most efficient.
VSWl45cKaa	You have two problems:<br>  <br>  a.  the flap at the bottom of the tank was not seated properly and the water kept filling the bowl; and <br>  b.  a blocked drain that could not handle the continuous flow of water from the tank into the bowl.  <br>  <br>  The drain pipe is blocked but not completely. You correctly shut off the water and the remaining water slowly drained away overnight. <br>  <br>  You have to ensure the flap is working properly and is correctly seated so the automatic shutoff stops the water when the tank is full.<br>  <br>  You also need to use a plunger in the bottom of the bowl to free the blockage. Do this first (and vigorously), then check that the flap in the tank is seated properly, turn the water supply back on and flush the toilet. It should work properly.<br>  <br>  Further info (with diagrams) is available here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.hometips.com/how-it-works/toilet-plumbing-diagram.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.hometips.com/how-it-works/toi...</a>|`|cyFqjkolaa	It sounds as if the sut of valve in the tank got stuck so the water coming in did not stop.  usually this flows back out of the relief valve but maybe the incoming water was too much.  The toilet itself probably never clogged at all.<br>  <br>  Take the tank lid off and wiggle the arm with the float on it to see if anything is lodged in there.  Unless there is some damage it should be alright.  To replace it is not that hard a job and a kit can be bought at hardware store.|`|5b5e3b4f114d52c05fdb151a2f5b2317aa	Did you try plunging it? And yes, with my experience, everything will "flush" or get stuck out of sight, and just the water will overflow.<br>  Now that you've let it sit, I'd recommend plunging it as you flush it again. That has always worked for me. Have lots of old towels or whatever else you're going to use to clean up excess water if the plunging doesn't work.<br>  Good luck! Overflowing toilets are no fun.|`|5b69b0aee2e0929afbcd2166a8e14474aa	it sounds like you got drainage problem from your toilet bowl to the sewers...it would explain it if you lived in a low laying are and it rained a lot...those sewer pipes are about15 inch wide in some areas
n560blqraa	I own a home remodeling company and invest in real estate, so bare in mind that by removing the sliding doors all together, you would affect your real estate value. If the doors are in bad shape consider replacing them with more modern looking bypass doors like the Nuporte 1210 series 3-lite or Nuporte 1240 3 panel doors. These are absolutely beautiful and affordable at www.homedepot.com (sold in 5ft, 6ft,7ft openings) Look at home depot's website and search under Nuporte doors so you can see the enormous variety offered. These look great and are of furniture quality.<br>  <br>  In addition, please don't consider taking out to put curtain panels there. Again, this will destroy your resale value. Also, with bypass sliders....they are put in to save space in a bedroom, so removing them to put in double doors that open up into your room will take up an emormous amount of space when opened fully.|`|KaR3nR9vaa	what about a wall|`|bO2rzfISaa	Beads, curtains.|`|78BZKEuraa	you might try bi-fold doors, i had the same problem with my sliding doors, and these work great<br>  <br>  here's a pic<br>  <br>  <a href="http://i.ehow.com/images/GlobalPhoto/Articles/4431818/bifolddoor-main_Full.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i.ehow.com/images/GlobalPhoto/Art...</a>
t8kykME3aa	It seems a positive ion generator works best. It affects the reading positively because it helps attach radon daughters to walls or dust in the air. I read somewhere that combined with a fan to move the air around it might help reduce the free radon in the air up to 95%. This sounds pretty good but keep in mind positive ions might not be that good for you. Negative ions which are good for you work too.

If youâre like me, youâre rushing around to get the last minute things ready. You realize that you donât have time to clean up your bedroom so you close the door. Right? Sure some people close their bedroom doors because they want them to remain private, but when I see a closed bedroom door I think, âOh, they ran out of time to clean it up.â And I always wonder just how bad it is. Closed doors bring out the snoop in me. <br>  <br>  When I have company I always clean up my bedroom because invariably somebody says, âOh this is such a cute house. Do you mind if I see the rest?â or âI need to put my feet up for a little while. This pregnancy is wreaking havoc on my feet and ankles, but my kids will shoot me if we have to leave early,â or âYour toilet appears to be stopped up. Do you have another bathroom?â<br>  <br>  When company comes, itâs best to expect the unexpected. No matter what kind of shape your bedroom is in, you can be ready for company in 30 minutes if you periodically follow the four simple steps described here. I like to do this once a season.<br>  How Much Magic Do You Need In Order to Get Your Bedroom in Shape?<br>  <br>      Is your bedroom bulging at the seams with shoes piled up in the closet, clothes on the floor or on chairs because there's no more room in the closet? Do you have to shove a pile of stuff off your bed before there's room for you and yours? Is it scary under your bed?<br>  <br>      Are you somebody who LIVES in your bedroom? Is it a place where you eat, exercise, watch TV, and work on your computer? The more you do in your bedroom, the more difficult it may be to declutter because each activity has its own "toys." You may need a 12-Step program if you have more than 5 dirty dishes under your bed. <br>  <br>      Or do you just have an ordinary messy bedroom because you're usually in a hurry dashing in and out, dropping clothes on the floor and bed as you rush off to work, to a party, or to get dinner ready.<br>  <br>      Regardless of whether your bedroom is a total disaster or if it just needs tweaking, you'll follow these same four steps.<br>  <br>  Step 1: Start by taking EVERYTHING out of the bedroom that doesn't belong there. For many of you, that step alone will get you half way to a clean and tidy room. <br>  <br>  If you have a lot of things that belong in other places, you might get sidetracked if you take them there now. Solution: Have a box or laundry basket (dump truck?) to put everything in that is out of place. Fill it up and set it aside to empty as soon as you've finished the other steps.<br>  <br>  Step 2: Open the closets and drawers and scan your room to see if you have too much stuff and need to get rid of some it. Here are some things we usually have too much of- shoes, nick knacks, clothes, jewelry, socks and underwear with holes in them.<br>  Tips to Help You Let Go of Excess Stuff<br>  <br>  Create a visual of clothes you donât wear. Here's a handy tip to let you know what clothes you are actually wearing and which ones you aren't. Turn all of the hangers around so that the point of the hook faces you, instead of facing away. <br>  <br>  When you wear something, hang the hanger up as usual with the hook facing away from you. At the end of the season, consider letting go of anything you haven't worn - which will be obvious by the clothes on hangers with the hooks facing you. This is a cool visual reminder. You may be surprised how many things you haven't worn.<br>  <br>  Team up with a friend. If you have difficulty getting rid of things, have a friend join you. Just their presence may help you see that the worn down heels on your shoes are not appealing, and you'll put them in the give-away or trash pile. When you hold up an old piece of clothing that you never wear, it will LOOK unattractive when your friend is sitting there with you. Iâve done this with my friend, Brenda. A couple of times she said, âdatedâ or ânot your colorâ and that was all it took to school me in the art of letting go. Now she just sits and folds as I rifle through my clothes and shoes. Itâs fun and itâs quick. <br>  <br>  If you get bogged down now and then, ask yourself if you would wear it on a date, to a special event, or out to dinner. If the answer is no, hand it to your friend to put in the give-away pile. <br>  <br>  Set a percentage goal. If your closets are packed and itâs unpleasant to hang things up, set a percentage goal of how much you'd like to clean out. Twenty-five to fifty percent is not unreasonable if you haven't purged in a while. With a little breathing space in your closet, you'll be more inclined to hang things up and to wear things that you didn't remember you had because they were smashed and hidden between things you never wear. This step may reduce the amount of ironing you need to do too. Use this strategy with your drawers as well.<br>  <br>  Get Real. Realistically assess the shape your stuff is in. Getting rid of excess shoes can be a challenge for some of us. They become like old,

v3xEtuLLaa	As long as the wire to the lift is #6, you can tap off of the receptacle.  If not, you will make the wire the weak link in the circuit, rather than the breaker.  There are 2 options to fix this.  You can run a new circuit (30A, 2 pole) wired with 10-2.  At the panel, and at the motor, tape the white wire with black tape or color it with a black marker to indicate that it's hot.  Connect each of the wires to one pole of the breaker, and you are set.  Otherwise, you can change the breaker to a 30A, but you will lose the capacity at the receptacle.  Hope this helps.|`|qaAW9VN4aa	First of all make sure you have 220 at rec., if youve checked that then you should know that the black wire is hot and the red wire as well, you're unsheilded wire is commonly used for ground, the white wire is common.Some 220v appliances only require two hot wires equalling 220v and one ground wire and that is it.At the motor black and white will HOT and green should be ground.This info is contingent on the fact that the motor is positively 220v.So hook hot to hot, hot to hot,and you can use either wire for ground (on your 4 wire config.)that is the bare wire or white.And once again this all goes back to the breaker panel itself.Be sure your red and black are from hot and be sure either the white or bare(i would ground both white and bare)go to the bus bar.As far as breaker size tme motor should say the recommended amperage.|`|fNuMoHt7aa	Sounds like you know what you are doing <br>  You should put a smaller breaker in. <br>  Good luck|`|2uZXCyeBaa	Like woodtick said, replace the breaker.  The lift motor should specify the maximum ampacity of the overcurrent protection device to be used, so just go by that and gauge the SJOW cord that you're using as a cord accordingly.  As far as the outlet goes, I'd replace it with a 3 prong dryer receptacle just to make things simpler.  Turn the power off, take the outlet out, disconnect the white wire from the back of it, cap it with a wire nut and push it back into the box.  Now disconnect the rest of the wires, connect the green or bare copper wire to the earth ground on the new receptacle and connect the black and red ones to the other two terminals.  Now when you connect the SJOW cord, connect the matching colors together on the motor connection side and buy a 3 prong dryer plug to connect to the other side of the cord.  Connect the green wire in the cord to the ground terminal in the plug and connect the black and white wires in the cord to the other two terminals.  Check all of your connections carefully before proceeding, making sure that they all make sense and that you can't see any damage to the wire incurred during the installation.  Now plug in the lift motor and turn the power back on.<br>  <br>  You should be able to use the SJOW cord that you've already bought from Home Depot, just snip the extra wire off so that it can't touch anything inside of the motor or plug.  Make sure that this cord is a minimum of #10AWG in size.  Any smaller and it'll overheat and cause a fire hazard.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

v3xEtuLLaa	If you are working with sanding fiberglass frequently, I would definitely use a respirator rather than a dust mask.  N95 filters are fine, unless you will be painting as well which would take P100 canisters.  Remember, though, unless you are clean shaven, a respirator is not totally effective.  I don't believe that fiberglass works its way out though.  The owner of a body shop in my town died from lung failure at the age of 45 due to fiberglass.  Be safe.  Hope this helps.

v3xEtuLLaa	Adding 3 prong outlets does not add a ground.  If you want to convert, you will need to have ground wires pulled.  It's not a bad idea, since everything is opened up downstairs.  It won't cost a ton of money, but it will bring it up to code.  If the wiring you have is the fabric covered type, you will want that replaced anyway, so this is the time to do it.  Hope this helps.|`|bxlYleZkaa	Yes I would get your house rewired up to present day standards fairly soon!!|`|X43htXqEaa	I think you should re-wire your house.  Chances are you are still on fuses as well rather than a circuit breaker box.  You may be long overdue for the updated wiring depending on the quality of the original work.  The house that I grew up in was built in 1948 and my parents re-wired it in 1975.<br>  <br>  You'll need a professional electrician to help you.  We replaced the circuit breaker box in our home (built in 1960) about 2 1/2 years ago, and had all the two-pronged outlets replaced at the same time along with some new light installations for the exterior of the home.  The whole thing cost around $2K.<br>  <br>  Get a couple of estimates and see where you're at.  I think that its dangerous to be running appliances off of extension cords.|`|jcauTPLZaa	Have the whole house done. Upgrade to a 200 amp panel.|`|2uZXCyeBaa	Short answer, yes.  <br>  <br>  If you have access from below, now is the time to rewire your house if it hasn't been done since the 1940s.  Doing it later will cost twice as much.  However, if you don't have much money I don't know what to tell you.  It's not something that an electrician will do for free.  If you can hire a competent electrician who's done good work for someone that you know and do it off the books and in cash, you can save a few bucks.  Make sure that you trust this person though, because if something's done wrong there's no way to force them to come back and fix it.  If you're dealing with a 1500sf 3-bedroom 1-bath Craftsman from the 40s and you have easy access to the entire house from a crawlspace or basement that has plenty of room to work comfortably in, you're looking at about 50-60 hours of labor to replace the service panel and run in new convenience outlet circuits and dedicated circuits to all of the appliances that weren't around in 1940.  Materials... maybe $1,200.  If you can find a good journeyman who will work for $35/hour after he finishes his regular job (nights and weekends), you've got a deal!  $50 is probably closer to what you'll have to pay for someone who knows their stuff and can wire up a house with no plans.  That puts you in the $4,200 range.  This estimate only includes wiring the stuff in the walls and not rewiring lighting loads that are on the ceiling in your existing house.  Doing that would mean crawling into the attic and making lots of holes that need to be patched.  You can count on having to patch up around some boxes and repaint the walls in most of your house after this job is done, but I'd suggest that you figure out a way to pay to have this done before you start hanging drywall and blocking off your access to the ceiling in your new room.  <br>  <br>  Oh, one glimmer of hope in all of this:  Depending on what part of the country you're in, some houses built in the 30s and 40s were built with rigid conduit connecting all of the electrical boxes.  Though it presents some thorny code issues, this pipe can be reused if it's not damaged.  That means little or no wall patching, less materials, and about half as much time.  You can plan on spending about $1,000 on time and materials to have your house rewired this way and then another $1,500 on a new service panel.  If you have conduit, it'll be pretty evident.  In your basement and attic, do you see metal pipe coming from the electric boxes or black wire covered in a braided fabric that looks kind of like an old black rope?  <br>  <br>  One other thing that you might consider doing before you cover up your access to the floor above is installing cable TV and telephone wiring to any place that you might need it in the house.  This you can do yourself with a little help from one of the old timers in the electric department at home depot.  Use RG-6Q for  cable tv and category 6 UTP for voice and data.  That way you'll be set for whatever technology the next 20 years brings.|`|GoWoGKyQaa	I would say yes - bite the bullet and get it done. I've done a couple now myself.<br>  <br>  If you only do half, then you cannot say it's been rewired, and will continue to have problems. It will be worth it, as you should recoup the expense if you were to sell it.<br>  <br>  Most of the cost of a rewire is the time it takes to run cables - usually lots of cutting and drilling - and the making good afterwards.<br>   You can save most of the money by running the cables yourself.<br>   They are pretty standard for most uses. Buy a decent DIY book that covers house electrics to see the sizes and ratings, and gives the local regulations. For instance - there is a minimum hight of sockets from the ground, and new regulations concerning bathrooms.<br>  <br>  Plus you can add extra sockets where you want them - eg kitchen.<br>  While your at it, you may as well add data cables and phone sockets too.<br>   After installing them all - and leaving all the wires long at the fuseboard, you could then just employ a electrician to comission the new system, - test - then connect up. This would take 2 hours tops - compared to 2+ days for a full rewire.|`|fNuMoHt7aa	Defiantly. Yoo bad none of your friends doesn't know how.  because the wiring and outlets are really cheap in materials. $30 for 250 feet of 14 gauge wire and 50cents an outlet. You didnt meantion if you had an upgraded panel with breakers or not. the panel is where this gets tricky and a little pricey and you should have a licensed electrician. <br>  In some areas if a licensed electrician comes out your house they will have to make sure the whole house it up to code.  this can be expensive.<br>  <br>  What ever you do, make sure you replace the wiring in the house. before you replace the drywall. even if it means leaving the old wiring and just running new wires so it can be all hooked up by an electrician in the future. Just research how and where to clip wires to the wall and placement of new outlets especially in the kitchen. the kitchen should have min of 3 circuits going to it. Seperate for fridge, microwave, and rest of outlets<br>  <br>  Good luck

They should know what happened, in my opinion, unless they are going through a really bad time or something.  But to remove the gum, if I were you I would call and ask a professional for some tips, and only use gentle cleaners to work at it (like ice) until you find out something that definitely will not damage the carpet.

Just take a spoonful of peanut butter and massage it into the gum. Wait a few minutes and scrape away. Of course, now youâll have to contend with peanut butter removal, but in the general scheme of things, itâs preferable and easier to remove peanut butter from the carpet than gum. If you let the peanut butter dry for a little while, it should be easy to vacuum, or you can sponge it off with a cloth or rag. If staining does occur, blot it with a little mild dish washing detergent or a little vinegar. Dab with a damp cloth or sponge to rinse..or you could try putting lots of ice in a bag and sitting it on top of the gum for a while...The coldness of the ice cube will cause the gum to harden.

If you are a regular Kroger shopper, they will even send you a $1 off coupon for it in the mail...<br>  <br>  This is how I know that they do pay attention to what I buy with my kroger shopping card.  I regularly get an envelope in the mail filled with their coupons.  There are only coupons in there for things that I actually buy.  There was a citrus magic coupon in the last bunch.<br>  <br>  It's a bit more expensive, but you only use a very small tap of the button as it is VERY concentrated.  One can lasts for months!<br>  <br>  It's like PeeWee Herman said after he last used my bathroom, "Hmmm ... orangey!"|`|HOpTm1I1aa	<a href="http://www.iherb.com/ProductsList.aspx?cid=8195670900250727235&gclid=CLO00YafjJkCFRo-awoddCMnnw" rel="nofollow">http://www.iherb.com/ProductsList.aspx?c...</a>
