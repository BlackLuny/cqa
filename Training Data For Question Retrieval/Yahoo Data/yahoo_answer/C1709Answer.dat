wRsSodTAaa	It seems that Casey was involved.  Not sure if she acted alone or not?  But, IMO it was from chloroform poisoning.  If there were broke bones, that would have shown in the autopsy report.  I think it was premeditated murder and not accidental due to the internet searches found on Casey's computer.  Very sad.|`|TPTnzRI3aa	Something inside of Casey Anthony clicked. She no longer wanted a child. She figured, hey, she's only 2/3/4(?), who will know/care/realize?<br>  She probably soaked some kind of cloth in a chemical and put it over Caylee's mouth and nose to knock her out. Next, I'm sure she broke her neck and after that a beat her around a little more to get her frustrations out. Caylee was not a planned child and Casey is one ****** up, fed up, in-need-of-psychiatric-help, no-hearted sinner.|`|AA11031985	I'm not sure, I don't know how anyone could do something like that.

hs9Mibf5aa	I'd listen to Stephen.  J.K. Rowling wrote about a series that could defy age limits and imaginations, as do most of King's books,<br>  <br>  - whereas "Twilight" is limited to a certain fan base.  Once that's gone, it's gone.  She'll have to broaden her writing horizons a bit.<br>  <br>  I believe it's actually constructive criticism on his part.  She should listen to him if she wants to keep writing as a career.|`|PFPvvHEgaa	Twilight is PATHETIC.<br>  And he's right.<br>  J.K. Rowling is.. I think one of the most organized and creative authors that can actually make the world feel real and make sense.<br>  Twilight.<br>  Uhm.<br>  Not so much.<br>  He may be a little over-reacting, but it's true.<br>  So.<br>  I agree.|`|63b948f89ebc2e053374a20fd8f4b0b6aa	I'm going to be very blunt because I dont have a lot of time.<br>  <br>  Twilight... SUCKS. I picked up a book I found on my friend's desk, read about 5 lines, and was horrified that something that terrible could actually get published. Stephenie Meyer writes like a 5 year old!! BTW, that wasnt what King said. He said her books were horribly written and lacked a solid plot or focus, and that the characters were flat. What romance had to do with it, I dont know, it wasnt in the article. I'm with King on this one. Meyer is a HORRIBLE writer.|`|zzkmdusEaa	Stephanie Meyer's books have millions of fans....Does that seem like bad writing to you? Even if the fans are misled...Then shes a genius for tapping into their keen interests and thus not a bad writer.<br>  <br>  Harry Potter is great writing I will agree. However, society today is all about their facebook, cell phones, and underage drinking but not reading. God forbid a book come a long to get the youth reading again and thats exactly what twilight did. I saw girls in my senior class who I thought didn't even know how to read (exaggeration of course) finally pick up a book (Obviously Twilight series).<br>  <br>  Sure, maybe Twighlight sounds cheesy to you. But just because you don't like it, the answerers don't like it, or Stephen King doesn't like it, does NOT mean it is bad writing because if it were truly bad writing then she wouldn't have fans all around the globe then would she?|`|ktj5qv4faa	i agree with stephen king, i read lots of his books and they're really good. but i hate twilight, it has no skill and is a really unoriginal story. it's pretty much underworld crossed with romeo and juliet. but j.k rowling's books were original, and had skill in them...and yer...

f6qmRicQaa	When I first saw the cartoon, this was before the hoopla, I chuckled and thought nothing about it till later when the stuff hit the fan.  I took it to be an insult against the fools writing the thing.  I mean we all must know that Obama is not the one writing and re-writing the bill.  I get the historical implications, and it would only be valid had the cartoonist made Obama the chimp.  As far as Bush being made a chimp, we all know why they portrayed him as a monkey and it had nothing to do with race, it had to do with his bumbling incompetence.  And I don't think it's the whole black community that finds it offensive, my brother in-law thinks the whole thing is bs, just another chance for Sharpton and his cronies to make a mountain out of a mole hill and get the public spotlight for another 15 min.|`|S8RL9lieaa	Very funny and captured a topical subject of the day.|`|a6fUSU2Paa	Consequences for what?

If an apology can't be offered, then there should be punishment - a boycott - until the inflammatory, insensitive and arrogant nature of this cartoon is recognized.<br>  <br>  AND, you are right......Bush being made out to look like a monkey is not the same.  Bush is white!|`|9twZdl6laa	Why should there be consequences?  Basically what you're saying is that it's okay for minorities to be racist, but not whites.  As far as I'm concerned, this whole "politically correct" crap has gotten ridiculously out of hand.  Call me a racist, but it needs to go both ways.  Minorities are just as racist as whites and it's time they get called on the carpet for it too.|`|OWfU0OdLaa	nothing should happen to them. It wasn't racist, one bit. They were putting 2 news events into one. Cops shooting the chimp that went crazy and making fun of the bill that Obama did NOT write. They are calling the people who wrote it a bunch of monkeys cuz they ( new york post ) believe it is crap. Nothing to do with Obama. But Sharpton and all his "followers" saw this as a golden opportunity to play the race card like they always do. Blacks will always do this, and white will always be the racist ones.|`|d12a585a9f486535d07b0683ef24b00eaa	i'm more offended at MTV AND VH1  for their constant display of Amos & Andy reality  shows..  good lord I hate listening to Jive all day|`|FvMtam2Aaa	The correct interpretation of the cartoon is that his socialist spending program is tearing the face and arms off the working American public.  It has nothing to do in regards to Bama being black,  How many times was Bush made out to be a monkey?  It is NOT raciest and the liberal media is making it racist to keep our minds on race and not the fact that we are broke and printing money for every GD thing!<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|NAHDcvcFaa	funny story and a true one at that.. i go to MSU, a couple weeks ago there was a cartoon in their newspaper which had Bush as a chimp. not that i would ever defend Bush but why is it ok to have a white person be a chimp but not a half black person (even though the cartoon wasnt about obama, and if people took a political science 101 class they would know )|`|AA10153636	Nothing, they portrayed Bush as a monkey in cartoons many times over and we did and said nothing.   Nothing was meant (racially) by this cartoon..<br>  Besides the whole bunch of them are acting like monkeys.   <br>  This is getting worse than the Muslims and their protests against cartoons.|`|n2eOdOm8aa	No consequence people making a big deal out of nothing.<br>  <br>  It is congress that writes the rules.

Obama is a Socialist and I kept telling people to not vote for him because look at what he is doing. He is full of LIES and has deceived many who voted for him. I really think Pelosi and who ever has their own jet to sell their jet on Ebay. And no wonder California is broke.

So, the plan, while not perfect, is going to help 9 million americans out of bad situation (which wasn't on the radar), stabilize house prices, and preserve the equity of all homeowners, not just those who need to use it.<br>  <br>  It's kinda like whining about the cost of the fire department when one in every 10 houses in your neighbourhood are burning down to the ground.|`|LLnNjH94aa	Actually no.  It seemed that most of the traders on the floor of the stock exchange agreed with him, and they don't make a million dollars a year.<br>  <br>  Nor does Santelli feel that anyone should die, he just understands how the economy works, that's all.<br>  <br>  They damn well are not.  They make no more than $100 thousand a year working the floor down there in Chicago.  <br>  <br>  You just make crap us as you go.|`|VMSLIy6maa	Do you know Santelli is also against Bush's $700B wall street bailout from the begining? While our dear president voted for that bailout as a senator.<br>  I think he is not just mad at Obama's housing bailout. He is mad at all those bailouts and finally that anger erupted.|`|diAqosiIaa	.....im sorry i am not up to date
A6PS0jRfaa	maybe they are all sold out since everyone is just so nuts over them.I would call the company and ask them when the order will be shipped.I hope you get them before it gets too warm..make sure you wear them to every single public event you can! :)|`|CEMUpgFPaa	couldn't afford it, taxed on that too 5x over|`|ybwZLxMjaa	you need to get ahold of the company and tell them you will be getting a lawyer if you do not receive them or get a refund|`|WGsC4c61aa	that's the thing they are using at football stadiums to say warm.  How weird it would look.?|`|1239271c3de85dde812326b9aaafb7d8aa	they are on a  s l o w  boat from China.|`|6Z6qXhPXaa	I saw some on the shelf at Jungle Jims in Hamilton OH
AA10138269	Possibly.|`|AA11707728	Yes|`|hdnI8ARiaa	no she had plastic surgery|`|R49w1Dr7aa	That's what I have read. Who knows?
1c0f793db881cd47badc0d00bd5bd1caaa	Probably the recognition effect, most people over a certain age will recognise songs from that ere and a good chance their children will have too, whereas modern music for the best part is genre driven, so fewer people will know who or what it is.|`|ivsKcwwvaa	I'm guessing because except advertising aimed at age specific younger people, it's usually aimed at those 40 and over who tend to have more to spend. And that music is used to attract them to the ad.|`|Re9Pdfxbaa	Probably the most popular artist/music for TV ADS is Nina Simone. The reason is the era 50s/60s even 70s was packed with creativity. The Beatles were creative geniuses who have sold over two and a half billion albums. Nowadays most pop stars churn out rubbish and reach number one in the charts for selling a few thousand albums. Even the highest award (Platinum Disc) you get for selling 300,000 albums. The Beatles had PRE-RELEASE orders of 4 million albums for most of their songs.<br>  That means 4 million people ordered their next release before it was in the shops.  There are some good singers and groups around today so i do not have a closed mind on this. I think The Killers, Coldplay, are very good. The old songs have melody and simple words with real meaning. As much as I like her, any one could write the annoying Kylie Minogue songs.  There is no creativity. X Factor / American Idol ?? can you really distinguish one from the other because I cant.  Millions of young kids bidding for the big time yet Leona Lewis and Will Young are the only ones I can name. Nina Simone is real class you cant fake it.|`|gLp7pvPnaa	Copyright?<br>  Attracting a certain age to the advert?<br>  More tunful?<br>  Better known?<br>  One thing I do believe, unlike the so called serious music, popular music continues evolve in a way that is pleasant on the ear.
RxZqP0cdaa	Because music from those days had a story to tell, they were made by groups who lasted the test of time. <br>  They were listened to in  the days when you could go out on a Saturday night, have 6 pints and a curry and still get change out of twenty quid.<br>  The days when you could have a night out and not end up in hospital, not see drunken half naked women spewing over garden fences and not have drugs offered to you as you walk into a bar.<br>  <br>  Today's so called music is made by one hit wonders who steal half the lyrics and music from someone else, then carry out outlandish acts when their street cred starts to dissolve.<br>  Who on earth would want to remember or be reminded of today's music.|`|pDGVTLoFaa	I think you have answered your own question as music from the sixties and older numbers as you say are indeed timeless music. I think it has more to do with the fact they have no "ideas" for the adverts as the music hardly advertises the product in question,they are taking the easy option. When one was in the advertising market in days gone by they would have to think up a suitable "ditty" and punchline for the product.|`|YrxLbfiIaa	Because kids, wanna be rappers and inner city types have no money... So they don't use there music.... On the other hand older folks have more cash and spending power.... So they play music that caters to them....  A few months ago Toyota was having a zero interest sale --- The music jingle was ripped off from Saved By Zero by the Fixx..... Of course the Fixx was popular in the 80's and folks that grew up in the 80's are in there 30's now and have money to spend (crappy economy not withstanding).......|`|f702cfc86c32f9c4c16e495b7e47297aaa	Because it was WAY better and it reminds people of happier times too.|`|hs9Mibf5aa	Because yes, the average age of the people with 'Disposable Income' is older than the people who are "mostly" enjoying today's music.<br>  Not saying there's anything wrong with music today, but the 30-55 yr. olds react more to something from their era, something nostalgic.<br>  <br>  This is their target audience, and it works, believe me.. They know what they're doing.<br>  Also having said that, if a catchy 'pop or light' tune of today is popular with all ages, they'll go ahead and use it, but the oldie's are the norm.<br>  Believe me, they have focus groups and many suits spending hours in advertising studying their audience(s).  It works.<br>  <br>  Joyride and others:  Yes, but fees still MUST be paid to the 'estates' of these artists, don't kid yourself.  There are a lot more of them alive than dead, also.|`|ea1ed505e3c0a89111a6fcd5e18dd1a8aa	Joy ride actually has a valid point. If the music is over a certain age it's often out of copyright. Companies choose older or unknown music as it's cheap. If you go for the latest Fall out Boy song you will find it is very expensive. The companies go for what is cheap and works for the image. They won't throw away money for the sake of it.|`|xdUjRxKzaa	This is a generational thing. My father used to say the same thing to me, the beatles, stones etc were rubbish, they'll never last! Crosby, Sinatra etc were his music hero's, they were his age group. But he was wrong and right, A lot from that era have survived as have a lot from the 60's and 70's and so too hopefully will some from today. It's great to hear Dylan singing Blowing in the wind on the COOP advert.|`|eXbgLXgCaa	English is my forth language so I only started to buy English songs/cds in last few years. I love music,big time! my friends started to ask me what do you think of this song and that... 99% of the songs I picked were somehow had roots in the 60s or 70s. now I've bought hundreds of cds a lots of songs on my ipod. I think the 50s songs are the best by far but its only my opinion, sorry..|`|KzXv8ZKEaa	why are u wearing clothes that are styled from the 60's,most pop groups are wearing styles from that era because they can't be original,most are copying,reverting back to the 60's music because they are talentless and can't think for themselves.|`|yUuS0uCWaa	cause those artists mostly died on drugs and they do not pay as much on royalties|`|gYThMID8aa	Because today's music isn't so good!|`|xVgYZpQkaa	Because Those are not copyright protected songs anymore.<br>  That means they can use the songs for free.|`|P5RXApdNaa	Because advertisers know what real music suppose to be, and it had made money and still does! The junk they try to pass off for music now days is not music, who don't even have to know how to read notes or put them on paper, just bang away on something and you got rap-crap.|`|GHefTsUyaa	From the late 70's onwards music has deteriorated to the extent that it is now moribund.<br>  We now don't have music but electronic noises combined with loud mumbling in between.<br>  The music has died.|`|JhC6BvPpaa	Not only was most of the music better than now, but the generations that lived through those times now own 3/4 of the wealth in the country and has massive buying power over younger generations. Many of those adds are aimed at people over 45 because the advertisers know where the money's at.
85gl71H7aa	5:50 = FIRE  8:50 = MODICUM  OT = RETURN|`|fY1mz6a7aa	MODICUM|`|AofBgiihaa	the sleuth word is frozen.    i missed the ot and the 550 so hopefully someone else has those.|`|iw47zApGaa	The word of the day for 8:50 was modicum.  I didn't get the 5:50 word or the overtime.  I am searching for the sleuth trivia word too.
yuBuNoPDaa	Arrogance - act haughty and act like you are God's Gift - I have no idea what people are thinking - I don't have mind reading ability. But apparently some people do and that amuses me.     Highly opinionated - have a lot of opinions, stick with them no matter what     I don't like arrogant or highly opinionated people really because they are closed. It's hard to get to know who they really are unless you can reach them on their level. I can't do it.    There is a difference between the two. You are more likely to be hurt by an arrogant person than a highly opinionated one.|`|yyfZMWE1aa	Arrogance is stuck up and think your better than everyone else.,  that no one is as good as you.    Highly opinionated is where you have high standards.
4c2b4b3698607bc95dd331438404d7e8aa	Martina is right, it looks very likely that the girlfriend's mother told the boy to claim he is the baby's father, purely to get money out of the tabloids and TV shows. The kid doesn't look like he's physically capable of fathering a child.<br>  <br>  Do I agree in theory with a 13-year-old father keeping the child? No, but then again, fathers in these circumstances rarely have anything to do with the baby anyway. Even if Alfie does turn out to be the father, it'll be the mother, or more likely HER mother, who get left to do all the work while the boy goes back to his skateboarding and/or X-Box. That's life.|`|nxrEuJsRaa	No.Its wicked and shameful|`|KwWwB22Zaa	to an extent...if their parents help out. if they are in it alone, no|`|M8jEeYoCaa	It probably isn't even his - there are about 5 potential "rival" dads!<br>  <br>  There is a legal ban on any further information in England, so you won't hear much for a while.|`|YGPKbyUdaa	I don't approve|`|xl4kG6H7aa	i approve, but its his choice to make|`|7vCMigRnaa	To a certain extent yes, to a certain extent no. If it's proven he even is the father there is no way him or the mother will really be able to take care of that baby properly unless there is adequate help from the grandparents.<br>  <br>  However, that being said it is THEIR baby and it is THEIR choice. I believe the UK governement, whoever is in charge of childcare over there, check in on this baby once every 2 or 3 months until they are sure that the baby can be taken care of.
R49w1Dr7aa	For many it is fear and they will try to appease these monsters in the hope that they won't be their next target. That is the purpose of terrorism, to cause fear.<br>  <br>  For me it is an intense anger and hatred for their maniacal behavior and I would never give into fear.|`|7Qpdm6rFaa	panic anger hatred|`|I1Hu4jmyaa	There are plenty, none work. Any one group of people who strap on bombs and then explode themselves time and time again while others acknowledge their deaths and celebrate there is no help for.
AJB1QcHzaa	How about..."Dumb Barbados *****!!!"|`|m0ysLZVraa	Hmmm.... You can put someof their song titles as the title<br>  <br>  S.O.S Chris<br>  Not ''Forever''<br>  Don't Wanna Kiss Kiss<br>  Rhianna is ''Disturbia''<br>  Shut Up and STOP DRIVING!!!<br>  Feeling Unfaithful<br>  Take A Bow, Chris....|`|T6oFx097aa	"Is it really over?"|`|izXIAxXGaa	How about <br>  "What's Love Got to Do with it?"
