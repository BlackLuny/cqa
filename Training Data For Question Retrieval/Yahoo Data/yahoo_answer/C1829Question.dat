20090220164008AAxP3zl	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Desktops	Having trouble with new high speed internet?	For a long time high speed wasn't available in our area. We recently found out that it had became available, so we ordered it. The company is Windstream and they require a professional installation. We decided to get a two wire because I use a laptop, while everyone else in the house uses a deskstop.    OK, after the installation was complete, my laptop was able to connect wirelessly to the internet, but the installer couldn't get the desktop (which the modem is hooked directly to) to connect. He thought it might be the out-of-date browser and recommended firefox. I used my flashdrive to put firefox on the desktop, however it won't connect to that either. Then I figured out that it just wasn't connecting, therefor it was the browser's fault.    I tried calling a helpline and it recommended unplugging the modem and shutting down the computer for two minutes. That didn't work either.

I have Verizon DSL with a Westel Versalink Model 327W REV:E. Apparently that's a terribad router.      My connection is really finicky, It will connect, as it is right now, and say "Network Access: Local and Internet." Which is grand! Yay router!      But randomly it will switch to "Identifying" and my connection will drop, and then it settles on "Unidentified Network" and I have no connection.      Oddly enough this does not usually effect my other connections, such as my XBL connection.      Help? I just need a new router or what? Considering getting Cable or a new router, anything to fix it.

(i tried to twitch the code for a long time but i couldn't do it)            import java.applet.*;    import java.awt.*;    import java.awt.event.*;       public class FlowLayoutApp extends Applet implements ActionListener, WindowListener    {        //static variables        public static final int FRAME_WIDTH = 600;        public static final int FRAME_HEIGHT = 300;                                                          //private variables        private Button m_left;        private Button m_right;        private Button m_center;        private TextField m_textField;        private FlowFrame m_frame;           public void init()        {            //setting the applet Layout            setLayout(new FlowLayout(FlowLayout.CENTER));                                 m_left = new Button("Left Aligned Demo");            m_left.addActionListener(this);            m_center = new Button("Center Aligned Demo");            m_center.addActionListener(this);                             m_right = new Button("Right Aligned Demo");            m_right.addActionListener(this);                        add(m_left);            add(m_center);            add(m_right);                                 m_frame = null;        }           public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent ae)        {            if(ae.getSource().equals(m_left))            {               if(m_frame == null)               {                    m_frame = new FlowFrame("FlowLayout : JavaReference.com ", FlowLayout.LEFT);                    m_frame.addWindowListener(this);                    m_frame.setSize(FRAME_WIDTH, FRAME_HEIGHT);                    m_frame.setVisible(true);               }               else               {                   //get the current layout object which is FlowLayout and                   //set the alignment to Left                   ((FlowLayout)(m_frame.getLayout())).setA...                   m_frame.setText();                   m_frame.validate();               }            }            else if(ae.getSource().equals(m_right))            {               if(m_frame == null)               {                    m_frame = new FlowFrame("FlowLayout : JavaReference.com ", FlowLayout.RIGHT);                    m_frame.addWindowListener(this);                    m_frame.setSize(FRAME_WIDTH, FRAME_HEIGHT);                    m_frame.setVisible(true);               }               else               {                   //get the current layout object which is FlowLayout and                   //set the alignment to Right                   ((FlowLayout)(m_frame.getLayout())).setA...                   m_frame.setText();                   m_frame.validate();               }            }            else if(ae.getSource().equals(m_center))            {               if(m_frame == null)               {                    m_frame = new FlowFrame("FlowLayout : JavaReference.com ", FlowLayout.CENTER);                    m_frame.addWindowListener(this);                    m_frame.setSize(FRAME_WIDTH, FRAME_HEIGHT);                    m_frame.setVisible(true);               }               else               {                   //get the current layout object which is FlowLayout and                   //set the alignment to Center                   ((FlowLayout)(m_frame.getLayout())).setA...                   m_frame.setText();                   m_frame.validate();               }            }        }                     public void windowActivated(WindowEvent we){}                        public void windowClosed(WindowEvent we){}                           public void windowClosing(WindowEvent we)        {            m_frame.setVisible(false);            m_frame.dispose();            m_frame = null;        }                         public void windowDeactivated(WindowEvent we){}                        public void windowDeiconified(WindowEvent we){}                        public void windowIconified(WindowEvent we){}                        public void windowOpened(WindowEvent we){}                        public class FlowFrame extends Frame        {               public FlowFrame(String title, int align)            {                super(title);                                        //setting FlowLayout with vgap and hgap as 10                setLayout(new FlowLayout(align, 5, 5));                                            m_textField =

20090220190244AApES7X	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	My laptop screen is black?	It's been getting black for about a month. It doesn't get completely black, but it gets very very dark and you can barely see the background. The screen turns dark whenever the paltop gets moved suddenly. When it gets dark, everything else is working fine and the laptop stays on. Sometimes, when it goes dark, I just turn it off then back on and it gets back to normal. But recently, I had to turn it on and off at least 4 times for the screen to get back to normal. Today, it doesn't want to go back to normal, no matter how many times I turn it on or off.  And it's my sister's laptop so I'm scared that it's broken.       It's a Compaq laptop. Yes, I've checked if the battery is not charged or if the brightness level is too low.       So what do you think is wrong? How can I fix it?

20090220192413AAHVva2	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Desktops	Is Having 4 Gb RAM in Vista 32bit Hurting It?	My PC used to have specs that would seem to be worse than the ones I have now. I had and still have Vista 32 bit as my OS and my old specs were an 8800 GTX, Intel Core 2 Quad Q6600, 2 Gb RAM, and my mobo was by Gigabyte with the model number P35DS3R. For the record it was overclocked but I didn't OC the RAM much so I don't think that's really relevant to this. My Experience Index was 5.7, with everything being a 5.9 except my HDD which was 5.7 because it was running out of space. Now instead of the 2 Gb of RAM I have 4 Gb (it's 2x2 Gb now, when before it was 2x1 Gb) and my mobo is now the EVGA 750i. I also got a new hard drive. All my stuff now (including the HDD) is a 5.9 but now my RAM is 5.1! How is this possible? Did having more RAM than Vista 32bit can utilize make my PC worse? The only thing I can think of is the latency on the 2Gb sticks might be 5 instead of  the latency of 4 on the 1 Gb sticks I used to have. Would that make so much of a difference that it would go down so much in rating? Can someone help me? Thanks, I really appreciate it!

20090220184822AAIze7Z	Computers & Internet;Software	What Excel function can be used to count the # of cells that match in two different rows with varying req.?	I am trying to find a formula in Excel. I have two rows of numbers. Row one is a list of required hours. Row two is a list of attendance hours. I would like to count the number of cells if the attendance matches or exceed the requirements.   Ex:   Event:...............1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8   Requirements:...2  2  4  3  2  1  1  2     Attendance:.......2  2  3  2  2  1  0  1        The attendance requirement is met for event 1,2,5,and 6. So this would come out to a count of 4. I have tried sumif and countif. I can't figure out how to compare values within the two rows that are in the same column. The problem is the varying requirement. I would like to do this with one formula in a cell off somewhere else. I have been able to do this with a work around but that includes creating a bunch of formulas and creates a mess. Thanks in advance.

20090203102841AAcyQZ5	Computers & Internet;Other - Computers	How do I fix a bent DVD? (with information on the DVD I need to recover?)?	I am a graduate photographer and have been away traveling for the past year. To back up my images I burnt them to DVD's so I could free up my memory card and work on the images at a later date. Upon returning to the UK I have found two DVD's that were stored in a back-pack have been bent or warped slightly. As a photographer the remaining information on the DVD's are duplicate files of images taken directly from my Camera and the only copies I have.    At first the DVD player would not even display the DVD on the computer but I put them under some weights for a week which helped, as I have been able to recover part of them but there is still 3GB (900 images) left which I cannot recover and it is very important to me that I find a way how to do so.    Does anyone deal with this sort of problem? If you do I would very much like your help in resolving the matter, if not, would you be able to recommend someone who does?!    Kind regards.
