5f5e536951c9ab9a35b76b038514f369aa	Please go see a doctor asap. It can be anything. <br>  <br>  Anyways, why should you bother with all these guys at all? They seems to be constantly sleeping around. The way you describe it, its almost like those grays anatomy kinda drama. Get a better group of friends who appreciate each other better.
7wqkRZK1aa	You have all the right to be too.<br>  If you want to fix things:<br>  1.Try calling him again if he doesn't answer leave a message asking why he didn't even call you to tell you that he wasnt coming...that you value the friendship but that you don't know what to do.<br>  If you want to wait for his response:<br>  dont call him wait for him to call you back and when he does question <br>  him but dont be too aggressive.<br>  If you dont want to fix things:<br>  just dont call him.<br>  <br>  if you value the friendship call him.<br>  im sure if hes been your bestfriend for so long there was a very good reason as to why he didnt go to visit you.<br>  <br>  atleast you have a bestfriend  dont have one even though im just 15.<br>  and i have a friend who says shes my bestfriend because ive known her since 1st grade she treats me horribly and takes advantage of me.|`|AOwZNtQuaa	Wow I am surprised that your best friend would do that. I guess the only thing you could reallydo is leave him a message or somethcing telling him about how him ignoring you bothers you. And I guess all you can dois wait and see|`|ZoPln7vaaa	Yeah! I know exactly how you feel, as I'm right now facing the same situations... we can't even concentrate on anything as it will be bothering us a lot.<br>  <br>  I may not give you a perfect suggestion or advise because, first off, I'm not very good at giving advises and I'm unable to handle the similar instance myself.<br>  <br>  However, if I would be your friend, I could only console you saying... Not to worry and waste your precious time for the one who don't deserve your friendship... I know its quite difficult to do but that's all I can say.<br>  <br>  Hope! you'll get Helpful answers as you go along.

UF9MVdSXaa	Sorry that's happening to you. Well what I would do is confront the person who spreaded it around that you want it to stop. The the next thing I would do is tell everyone it's not true. Then after that I would just ignore it. For example: my crush always claimed I was stalker (which I'm not! Lol) And told everyone to stay away from me and what not. After I told everyone it wasn't true, everybody stopped believing it. (Truth is my crush is the one who is stalking me! Lol)<br>  <br>  Anyways sorry it's sooo long!<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope I helped!<br>  <br>  And best of luck!

xzMUxGpgaa	Hi there, well it sounds like the one good thing he has got going for him in his life is having a friend like you that cares. Right there should be a big help to him.<br>  <br>  Honey, depression is such a horrible illness. I feel for your friend, I really do. Then to add violence and drugs to the picture can only make it so much worse. And to think he is only 16 years old. It is all very sad. I can understand why his doctor wants him to receive treatment.<br>  I just hope that he gets the help he needs. Depression is a hard illness to overcome. Getting off of drugs would be a big help. That is only adding to his problems. It is only covering up what is wrong, but only for a short time. Plus, he is putting himself in dangers way. <br>  <br>  I would not think that you would be allow to visit him, but each place is different. He would have to check with them to see what their rules are on visits.<br>  <br>  Yes, I can bet he is scared. Those people are use to dealing with this though, so please tell him that. The very best thing he can do though to help himself in there and in life period, is to open up and be honest. That is a must!! He has got to tell the truth, as it is the only way the doctors will know for sure what is happening in his mind. If he does not talk about his problems, please try to tell him how important it is that he does. The only thing you can do my friend, is to tell him that you are there for him. You won't be able to "save" him though, he is the only one that can do that. He has got to want to though. Getting his head clear by getting drug free would be a great start. Then medicines can help with his depression and he can talk about his violence and take classes for angry management to help him deal with that. <br>  <br>  Sounds like he has got a good friend in you. But the bottom line is, he has got to take the steps to help himself. I wish him the best of luck and it is wonderful of you to care so much. He is lucky, but just remember though you can not do this for him. Good Luck, Aunt DeeDee.
KTqdwG3Xaa	He is so into you.|`|85V6cHe4aa	He is falling in love with you|`|2fYdY1fiaa	did you know that means hes in love with you? good job!|`|C0aMI33Naa	it means he's falling in love with you.<br>  :)|`|CKnHMYHnaa	He's in love with you but couldn't say the L-word|`|FUNhlpiqaa	LOVE|`|75236c05a96cd73f0ee35ff96e7eb7a4aa	Personal question?  Have you slept with him?  I'm going to be the negative one in the group here and say that there's always the outside chance that when a guy says he loves you, or he's "falling for you", or he feels close to you that what he really means is he wants in your pants and he thinks that saying those words will get it for him.<br>  <br>  Hey, I hope I'm way off base and your guy's not that shallow - but there are a lot of shallow men out there (women too for that matter).<br>  <br>  It's nice to think the best, but make sure your thinking with your heart AND your head.  Just because you like a guy doesn't mean you have to check your brain at the bedroom door.|`|AacmVYD9aa	well its good when your in a relationship to fall for someone several times. he may mean he is falling in love with you. you want to never get tired of the person your with so your obviously doing something right for him. i am happy for you guys... good luck|`|6tcXKcBgaa	He could possibly mean he is "falling in love" with you, and considering a long term future with you .|`|vimfbSxfaa	dating for a while because he finds you intresting and now he's falling for you cause he's falling in love with you? mabey?|`|2nc9k9BSaa	It's a vague way of saying he has stronger feelings. Not necessarily love, but he just likes you more.<br>  <br>  That's it.|`|eo0DKI0qaa	It means that he is starting to trust you more deeply|`|W9wRSEOQaa	hes falling in love with you honey|`|ePFZ5tHqaa	I think he's devoted to you now.|`|84ZyxsEwaa	He means that he has gone from a level to liking you a lot, to actually loving you :)|`|pnCYdBUuaa	If he hasn't dropped the "L" word, he's easing his way in :)
AA11324847	Duh, he's trying to forget you, obviously you did something that hurt him. Don't play stupid you know why he deleted you.|`|vgWtWmXxaa	Are you sure that his facebook is still active? Sometimes I think that my friends deleted me from their lists.. but then I just find out that they unactivated it for a while. Sooner or later they return.... But if he did actually delete you, it's no big deal right? You guys broke up and have different partners now.. it's not the end of the world. Just don't look into it too much.|`|KTqdwG3Xaa	Maybe he just wanted a peek.|`|XYBCQz8Naa	maybe...he deleted his profile?? and why do you care even if he did delete you, you guys have been broken up for 3.5 years.|`|6Xoz12FNaa	well hes kinda now hates you for putting up ur new pics with ur boyfriend..even though he has his own girl too...for some reason i would feel the same way...but who cares..hes ur past...u think about ur persent and future..good luck|`|WQ4hXvzmaa	Maybe he still has feelings  for you but doesnt want to acknowledge it|`|g6Vci5SUaa	Could be a couple of reasons.  One, his fiancee asked him two.  Two, he's done it as a surprise for her.  Three, did he take down his facebook page entirely?  Four, maybe the fiancee did it.<br>  <br>  If it bothers you enough, email him and ask.|`|1Lo34oEDaa	I dont know what to tell you your giving mixed words try to refrase the inside look of the question.
D8OzQwXKaa	na dont, just ask him straight up because if you guys are cool, why mess that up?
JhvqUvlsaa	You sound like a great guy; she'd be lucky to have you as boyfriend or a friend. Keep in touch with her and start dropping hints like telling her that she is your sunshine and whatever you feel comfortable with. If she receives it, then tell her that you feel this way and you'll give her some time to think about it. Basically tell her what you told us; and I wish you luck.
5b5e3b4f114d52c05fdb151a2f5b2317aa	It sounds like she definitely was hanging out with the wrong crowd the last year. As well as she likes to cause drama. I would just tell her the truth. I mean, she wasn't nice to you a year ago, and it really hurt your feelings, so whether or not she's having relationship problems, doesn't concern you. You broke ties with her and would like it to remain that way.<br>  Granted, she will probably spread more rumors about you and how "terrible" you are for telling her all these things, but I think you're better off without her drama.<br>  People change a lot through middle school and high school, so, hopefully her life will turn around.<br>  Oh yeah, and some words of advice. High school boys who date middle schoolers are dating down because they can't get anyone their own age. It may be cool to date guys that old, but trust me, they have a lot of issues (like this guy cheating on this girl). Stay within your grade for now, or at least only 1 year ahead/below.|`|AA11275104	I would just tell her why you aren't friends with her anymore and would appreciate if she stopped acting like it and coming over. Yes,She seems like a bad influence on anybody. I would talk to your councilor or look it up on the internet.|`|0e4wLPhgaa	(a) The next time she comes over be like, " *HER NAME* can we do this another day, i have a bunch of homework, or stuff to do... ill call you some other day "<br>  <br>  (b) DEF!<br>  <br>  (c) Why dont you ask her about her other friends, to see if she actully has any... if not... try to find her some or tell her " why dont you get into a club or do something you like"<br>  <br>  hope it helped!|`|gYuJUyvvaa	She's the beeyotch, you do whatever comes to mind to get rid of that girl|`|Likst1Mxaa	Obviously this girl still values your friendship. You can say to her that you support her but you can't support the choices she is making (eg wanting to sleep with a guy in high school).<br>  <br>  I don't think she's a "bad influence". are you being influenced? NO! You think she's making stupid choices. If anything, YOU are a good influence on her.<br>  <br>  I would recommend she talks to a school counsellor or someone else she can trust. Or suggest she talks to another on of your friend (if you feel uncomfortable about what she's telling you.<br>  <br>  Good luck. It's so nice to be kind to someone who has treated you badly.
jnYtxhKzaa	Uh no. I'd think she's a spoiled, superficial brat.
fqVxw8HMaa	first txt him and ask him how he is?<br>  if it goes well you both can call each other.|`|9dACSXOmaa	emm well..from what i gathered from ur story....ur ex bf came in with his new girl, who looked like a retard....and she gave u a dirty look. ur ex came over and said u look lovely, n u replied "u look like ur going to cry"? and his new retard girl came in with a friend and they both gave u a dirty look.<br>  <br>  emm...ok well first of all, it's not reli about getting over someone, but yes when u see how they're looking after u've dumped them or vice versa, u kinda think "F*CK! that's what i'm missing out on!" but yeah in a way it's harder to let go of everything you've been through when they're reli gorgeous....it's also to do with how u know people'd see u if they saw u with a hunnie like that! hehe<br>  <br>  from the story, i'm assuming he dumped u....and ur thinking he may regret doing this, and that you think that part of this may be because ur far prettier than his new, retarded-retarded looking girlfriend?...<br>  <br>  assuming that, then yeah, that may well be part the reason. he knows when he's not doing as well in the game as he used to. and if u still have feelings for the dude...sort it out, tell him...try n make it work, i'm sure there's still something left in him for u, maybe all u guys needed was time.<br>  <br>  As for the calls at 3 am on a withheld number...i bet both my nuts it's his frickin immature new retarded-looking gf..she sounds bitter...n she probably came to stare u out coz she knows ur still a threat, she can sense it, she knows ur still better looking than her n always will be,n he'll always have feeling for u etc. so she's being a bitter cow...next time u get a call just pick up and scream down the line " F*CK YOU! U MESSED UP HOE ____" and put her name somewhere there ;)<br>  <br>  anyway..hope this helped ;) xx good luck with that
synqEKEaaa	oh trust me it's not life or death im in 10th grade and plenty of my friends have never had a boyfriend before. But if you do really like him I suggest talking to him. Maybe even try and get his # but make sure it's casually. Get some friends to see a movie or something and invite him so it's not 2 awkward with just you to. If you like him you need to talk to him and spend time with him. It won't go anywhere if you sit on the sidelines just watching your days go bye.|`|feb0df556be60b6ae1592e3a13327aedaa	Before you get your hopes up, Do you think he likes you? The best way to show a girl you like him, is to take the lead, make effort to talk to him, and try to spend time with him... see how he reacts|`|kWyatjbRaa	Send him a message. Be like "do you like me?"<br>  <br>  I'm 14, and I'm having the same prob. Except the guy is 16 and is NOT a good guy. I just can't help but like him. He's everything I want...ughh, teen love sucks -_-
5b5e3b4f114d52c05fdb151a2f5b2317aa	Maybe you could invite her over and tell her you guys are all giving each other make-overs. And then have each of you take a shower, and what not... that way she would have to fit in and take one too, then you can style her hair, and what not, and teach her some tricks?<br>  I mean, you may have to be a little frank with her and just be like "hey, we know you get made fun of, we'd like to help you. How about you come over and we'll give you some pointers?"<br>  If she says no, then she doesn't want help.<br>  There also may be some family issues too. I know there was a girl like that in our class back in the day, and her mom had died when she was young, and her dad knew nothing about taking care of yourself... so, she was sort of in the same boat.<br>  Good luck! And it's really great you guys are genuinely trying to help her. I hope it works!|`|o23MmGOOaa	yes you should help her. I am sure she would appreciate your friendship, think how she must be feeling. maybe after you have become her friend you can have her over for a girls night.|`|kFOxlebDaa	Have you ever seen the movie clueless?|`|g59exVBdaa	Write her a note or just pull her aside before class starts
sGwMKlswaa	no, i put the bible on the radio when we have sex!
W6pT1Wp3aa	get yourself a girl to give ya oral sex aparently guys really like that and it's fun for girls to see how they react to it|`|gYuJUyvvaa	Ok, why would having sex make you feel guilty?

Don't let anyone sway you. I promise, it will be worth the wait. With sex comes responsibility, no way around it. This could be the responsibility of parenthood, disease,  or worse death. Don' t make this decision lightly. Sex is serious business. If you can't wait,... masturbate. No sin there.|`|Juio2N24aa	wait, dont do it because everyone else is or the idea sounds intriguing, take your time and dont rush it, its just sex, when your really ready its great but until then dont rush it. and if u do it always use protection.

etV271ARaa	Report them. The first answerer is right. Nobody on earth has the right to mess with you like this. And death threats are jailable offences. If a person threathens your life, he will be sent straight to jail. Dont be afraid. Just report this to your parents and get them to go straight to the police. Only then do you go to the school. The police will give you protection and warn the jerks off and that will be that. <br>  <br>  This is not something thats going to go away. Take action today|`|xzMUxGpgaa	Hi there, if kids are telling you they are going to kill you, then you need to report them. Even if you believe they are just talking and won't really do this, it does not matter. A lot of nutty people in this world. See if you can get someone to listen and over hear them saying that about killing you. Take this to your parents and to the school. This is nothing to mess with. The police should be informed and by rights the school should do it, once it is brought to their attention.<br>  <br>  I urge you not to wait. Your parents should be told right away. These kids will get checked out. If they are just bullying you, it needs to stop too. Do not be afraid of making someone mad, or getting someone in trouble. You will be doing nothing wrong. They are the wrong ones. Please take actions right away. I will be thinking and worrying about you. God Bless you, my friend.   Aunt DeeDee.

U need to have some mystery to you rather than offering urself whenever he wants (by this i mean time not sex).  if he wants to go hang out with other ppl then let him be, go hang out with ur friends then.  just cuz he doesn't act the same doesn't litterally mean he doesn't like you, he's just tired of the same ole same ole.  if he ends up moving on then so what? u can seriously think that this is the guy u're gonna marry.
71VRvldJaa	Abstinence rings are also called purity rings and they are.symbolic of a person's vow to refrain from SEXUAL EXPRESSIONS of love ......I don't know about you, but I don't know how pure I would consider myself to be if a guy has had face, mouth and tongue in and around my vagina!<br>  These rings are a cash grab and hold no magical power!.....A purity ring isn't worth 2 cents if you don't have any self control or respect for your body!  Yes, you've broken your promise to God.  There is nowhere in the bible that says you can't have intercourse but oral sex is ok!<br>  <br>  Edit:  I don't think any of the answers you've been given have implied you're a bad person or a hypocrite!  You asked if you'd broken your promise to God and yourself and you have.  As a christian, you should know that unlike we humans, God does not differentiate little sins from big sins....sin is sin! The bible doesn't tell us that if we've only done it once with someone you've been with for a long time that that makes it ok.  .<br>  We're human, we all make mistakes.....Lord knows I've certainly made some bad ones over the years.  Our God is a loving and forgiving God.  He knows us better than we know ourselves and that's why He laid out guidelines for our lives....to help make the journey easier for us.   In my opinion, a purity ring has absolutely no bearing on the situation and whether you choose to wear it or not is irrelevant.<br>  My comment about oral sex was a bit graphic I admit.  But too many kids these days fluff off oral sex like it's no more than a peck on the cheek.  All you have to do is read the questions and answers in this category.  Nearly everyone who doesn't feel ready for intercourse is advised to just do oral instead!  I was graphic because I was trying to make the point that that kind of intimacy is not ok  with every guy you date just because it's not intercourse.<br>  I personally, wasn't try be be judgemental with you.  I just call them as I see them and if you're a christian, you know in your heart it wasn't right otherwise you wouldn't have asked this.  There's an easy solution to this.....ask God for forgiveness and don't do it again.  When He forgives us, the slate is wiped clean!|`|0FXVTZf7aa	Alice, give up the abstinence ring.  Churches do not help you "count the cost" of abstinence before they sell you on that ring.  Did they bring out a real-life 40 year old virgin who told you what a blessing abstinence is?  I used to go to conservative churches that teach that abstinence crap, and I learned that the leaders of these churches actually crack jokes about 30 and 40 year-old virgins behind their backs. Now I just send my Christian friends to the site below which debunks the whole thing against premarital sex in the Bible. I hope it helps you.|`|jceUAJtyaa	Yes, oral sex is sex.<br>  I wouldn't go so far as to call you a hypocrite.<br>  However, abstinence is out of the running for you.|`|CajKowXcaa	oral sex isnt sex but ok ew|`|kWjy7uzAaa	Not only are you a hypocrite but you are greedy  you owe your boyfriend a bl0wjob.
GegQJNzSaa	I am guessing that you are a teenager.Most teenage girls do this because you are becoming an adult and you need to know a whole lot more information before you can set off on your own. Your friends are giving you yes and no answers because they don't want to make a conversation in that subject. You are thinking more then they are right now. They see you making life more complicated then they care for. I don't think trust is the issue here,maybe confusion because they don't seem to care.I don't think you ever get OVER over thinking. Because there is always something to think about! You get one thing answered and there are a million more. So you need to watch your friends reactions and learn what NOT to bring up,and your upset feelings will subside.|`|NJMGZ6TRaa	i guess only you can help yourself cause its personal. you need to have more faith in yourself and people around you.trust your instinct. (: take care|`|uRbeSOMwaa	talk to her about it face to face.|`|AA11266289	im kinda the same way but its only when im talking to girls that i like...idc if im talking to my friends cuz im use to it...idk tho|`|XYBCQz8Naa	this happens to me a lot too (except the 2nd paragraph). i honestly just stopped caring. its very simple, you just go into an attitude called "i dont give a f***) and you'll be good. and start hanging out more with friends or just go outside and play. that way you'll keep your mind off whatever your thinking about. cuz when your alone, all you can do is think and then you get paranoid and it makes things worse.
hTieELhTaa	put a picnic together and take her to the lake for a romantic evening. Make a whole day out of it and just be the sweetest guy ever make her the center of your attention an go do lees expensive things she enjoys. I think anything that shows that you care that you put thought into would be great. Give her a message or something only you know what she likes
hE4CXKX2aa	It is hard to say.  It seems that see does not mind interacting with you.  But if it goes on to anything personal, it is like the walls just go up and it is a stop where you are at type thing.  So maybe you should back down on everything with her.  See if she initiates anything like contact and such.  If she was a true friend she would talk to you on her own.  But if not, she just might be tolerating your actions.|`|YIvIVvWFaa	Obviously, it's not because she doesn't like you, so I think it's probably because she wants to avoid any situation in which she might end up having sex with you. You are behaving properly under the circumstances, but it is easy to start doing things that get out of hand when you are alone with someone. By not being alone together, she can be sure neither she nor you will do anything that leads to having sex. Smart, IMHO, but not an insult to you or anything. Try not to feel bad.|`|6Xoz12FNaa	dude...u dumb or something..obviously she is scared of u...leave her alone...she doesnt TRUST U..so that is why she doest want to be alone with u...she thingks u might raper her or something...but yh...get another good girl|`|bmu6uhQ3aa	You should talk to her about this.
1HLPznZhaa	So whats your question ? What kind of help are you asking for ? Why is he mad at you , etc.|`|heiEUCTTaa	give him some time. he/she will call you back or you can him/her. idk how big the argument was.. if it's bothering you, do stuff to keep your mind from thinking about him/her.. time heals all.
mbfMYmzWaa	Get one of your mates to dress as a sea monster, and another to pretend to get attacked... Then take her to the beach and ask her to hold on a moment while you rescue your friend from the giant squid. <br>  <br>  Seriously though, It depends on the girl of course- but the general rule is to get the ballance between being a good, responsive, sensitive friend- and still being masculine and attractive. <br>  <br>  Have you ever seen 'Hitch'? It's abit cliche, but I think alot of the things he says are pretty spot on (although I hate to admit it. lol.) <br>  <br>  There's always the issue of trying to let them know you're 'chasing' them without appearing desperate or easy... I think the most underrated, foolproof and utterly guaranteed (in my opinion) way is to forget about IMPRESSING her, and pretend (to yourself) that you only like her as a mate. Not only will this bring her guard down, if she's the kind of girl who's always being chased by guys- it will absolutely make her notice you & want to be around you. It will also mean that once she DOES like you, she won't be dissapointed as soon as you stop your 'impressing her act' because you'll have been acting naturally all along. <br>  <br>  The only thing is, it's harder said than done. <br>  <br>  That's IMO anyway, It's a total turn off when guys "try" to impress... because no matter how well they do it, we can tell their trying- and it's just all the same. <br>  <br>  Just be nice, be genuine, and be there for her.|`|ESSBrf2Xaa	be funny|`|XH2o1MM6aa	.If you want to impress a girl,treat her with respect and an equal.Take her out and about.Be proud to show her as a companion.
CUB3wUdiaa	well they say that the best way to a mans heart is through his stomach. well since your young i assume youre not gonna be cooking him too many meals.  from what you said he seems like the sports type.  try to learn sports and spark up a conversation that way.  if you already know sports then youre in there.  a girl that knows sports is hotter that just about anything in the world.  im not saying if you dont know sports you dont have a chance, but what im saying is it couldnt hurt.  other than that just be yourself and have fun.  if he likes you then hell be open to you know matter what you say really.  just make your move.  let me know if this helps.<br>  <br>  ray
bmu6uhQ3aa	Well, do you like him a lot that you would risk it even for humiliation? Have confidence and just ask him, or text, or write him a note. good luck :)|`|R0wnIQA7aa	You can always play 21 questions and ask him if he will ever go out with you.<br>  Or have a friend ask him.
8JcuKJ6Zaa	maybe or she just truts u like a bf u know....two options<br>  1.i mean she might think u want something else with her because the way u treat her...maybe she sees something else...like u giving her popcorn in her mouth...ok... sounds flirty<br>  or<br>  2. she sees u as a very good friend maybe thet best...someone she can trust and tell everything and she doesn't care showing the affection she has for u|`|Likst1Mxaa	yeah probably.<br>  <br>  either nake a move (if you like her) or give her some space (if she doesn't like you).
XH2o1MM6aa	.Firstly Sue may not feel the same way about Joe and quite happy to have Zack as her bf..Joe could end up losing both Sue & Zack as friends if he persists in this idea.Best to get a girl who isn't involved.|`|JBECY23daa	well "joe"messed up because its not right to date your friends ex.he should of told "sue"he liked her before"zack"Made the move.also the best way to forget about someone is time cause the stronger the feelings the harder it is.Good Luck=)|`|uegmmnOpaa	I would say that this is really up to Sue.  If she sees Joe as friend, it could make it weird.  Also if she is dating Zack that must be what she wants.  If Joe values his friendship with Zack then getting with his girlfriend or his ex girlfriend isn't the way to go.  The only way it wouldn't break guy code is if Sue was the one who went after Joe.  I would say let is go, there will be others.  The best way to get over someone is just to keep on moving.  Time heals all woulds.|`|oiCZTuVaaa	the same thing has happened to me alot "joe" shouldhave started flirting or at least something to show "sue" he was interested. then after a week or so of being himself he should have asked her out. but the best way i found to meet someone is get active go to bars and stuff and try to meet new people.|`|wr2CQnMOaa	im really confused here haha srry :D|`|yThJq8Dyaa	ask him if he cares more about his friend or the girl? tell him there are a million girls out there and he should keep his options open.
EPTaL9Ajaa	She's ok.<br>  Seems nice.|`|VmSKQ40Caa	Why do you people waste your points like this? Or this actually may be a serious question where you should tell the truth and phrase it: "Do you think I am pretty?". Let us pray for the former. If this really is your friend, she would ask it herself with her computer. If you reply "she doesn't have one", then that person in the picture is automatically you, and you are ugly. I didn't need to type all this, but I am bored.|`|peDJSnQPaa	ewwww|`|Ddfff5psaa	hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha|`|KTqdwG3Xaa	Sorry.<br>  <br>  <br>  BTW:<br>  <br>  I seriously laughed out loud to the answer above me! haha|`|IkAtIQumaa	No|`|LajVgGeAaa	I think she is pretty. And honestly, I can't believe some of the people in this world reading some of the answers. That is sad. Don't listen to them. <br>  <br>  I bet she has a good heart. Which makes her prettier than all the rude people who answered.|`|XzicOcyeaa	Well i'm a girl, so no i wouldn't go out with her but i do think she has good skin and nice hair...although you can't really see it in the pic. she should grow it long.|`|RaeLHLHnaa	nope. not ever<br>  oh and a7x ftw.... avenged sevenfold is awesome and i loved your response|`|8P64hgL3aa	sure why not.. If you really like someone, they become really pretty in your eyes..|`|dIxOyTcLaa	Hahaha fuc* no u won't be telling her sh*t hahahahahahaha I laughed out loud when I opened the pic|`|W9wRSEOQaa	WHOA!!!! keep it to yourself next time! not everybody wants to be blind ya know?|`|P1L8Rdhnaa	dude is that a joke?|`|ItYSaSt1aa	i guess you wont be telling her anything...<br>  <br>  <br>  edit:  i <3 u all<br>  SEVENFOLDs THE ****|`|aPlijTBDaa	I DONT WANT TO SOUND RUDE BUT SHE HAS TO WORK ON IT, LOOSE WEIGHT AND TRY TO IMPROVE THE WAY SHE LOOKS|`|D8CDf0vVaa	hello well shes ok <br>  common the people who are making fun of her are probly have no confidence and <br>  without those glasses and some eyeliner shed be bangin <br>  well hope i helped bye
uT9avos5aa	Well because our society tells guys that they should be tough and confident, so when guys do have a cry occasionally they don't want to do it in front of others, especially females.  Guys are less comfortable at expressing their feelings and our language skills are not as good as women generally, so when a girl cries in front of you, sometimes your not sure what to say or do, and feel uncomfortable.  <br>  <br>  I am an older brother, and we like our little sisters to look up to us and respect us, so when you feel down the last thing you want is to see your little sister seeing you crying and weak.|`|Likst1Mxaa	Coz they want to be by themselves.<br>  <br>  They don't need your hugs, they don't need to talk, they just want space. Don't annoy them, just let them be.|`|lhrMI9f5aa	because they are embarrassed about crying and just want to be alone.
3wKGTZvAaa	Danny, probably your friend. It's normal for a friend to tell you something you don't wanna hear once in a while.<br>  <br>  Na-na and Denny? No. Why would friends hide stuff from you like that (especially inside jokes) and comment on you about everything?

lhrMI9f5aa	First try talking to them. Then if that doesn't work try telling someone, using internet for that kinda stuff is cyber bullying.
KTqdwG3Xaa	Well I think you have nothing to worry about, but you should always plan for the worst.|`|28d1daabadd63d26e86fd71474b9230daa	First things first...you don't KNOW that he didn't precum. Best bet is to use Plan B, because you COULD get pregnant.<br>  <br>  Second, are you sure you're allergic to Plan B? What do you mean by allergic? What was your reaction? Did you break out in hives, or something else that would indicate allergy? Did you just have bad cramps and bleeding, or other period like symptoms? If you had the latter [period like symptoms and bleeding], this is normal and doesn't mean that you are allergic to it.<br>  <br>  IF you fear you are allergic, you might try making an appointment with your Dr, or describing your symptoms to the pharmacist and see what they say. I haven't really heard of any cases of allergies to Plan B, so that's why I'm saying this. Either way, just make sure you take care of it within the next 48 hours, you only have a 72 hour window to take the pill, and it seems 24 of those hours are already gone.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!<br>  <br>  UPDATE: Considering the allergic reaction you had last time, you may want to speak to a Dr. If you feel like you can deal with the reaction, go ahead and do Plan B, but if you had a reaction that bad, I would definitely get a Dr. Opinion.|`|85V6cHe4aa	Best talk to a doctor or nurse about it if you have a bad reaction,i got pregnant in very similar circumstances to yours but i was married and about to start trying so it wasnt really a problem.<br>  <br>  There is a risk of pregnany but you need medical advice about the plan B.|`|cvyFrKhZaa	If you're really worried about it, I would go get it anyways. Personally, I haven't had good experiences with Plan B either (or the Pill for that matter), so my ex and I would occasionally just use the withdrawal method when I was ovulating. A year of that, and I'm still not pregnant, and I know chances of you getting pregnant from that are low. So basically, if you wanna be REALLY sure, I would say go for it but I honestly don't think it's that necessary.|`|KcooLtkCaa	I would.  Just as a precaution.  <br>  I was in the same situation once with my ex.  I did not have an allergic reaction to it, but, unless the reaction was really severem i would still take the safe road and take it again.|`|JNAWH590aa	Take it just in case, it can't hurt|`|92cf42537f82d78858b0e03c9c1d8f9daa	you probably dont have anything to worry about<br>  <br>  But do you want to take that chance?<br>  <br>  Get it <br>  <br>  I think you would rather have that allergic reaction.. than being pregnant|`|ePFZ5tHqaa	Yes because you can never be too sure, it's better to be safe then sorry.|`|3c4d91ac4d898aab829f8733fd40b3d1aa	GET IT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
kUPoguCCaa	People who act like that do so because they have low self esteem.  They may even act like they're confident, but the reality is that they are scared people will see through them.  She needs help to believe in herself without adding to her neediness.  Be firm, and up front with her.  Let her know you're her best friend often, but that she's less than fun to be with when she's so clingy.  As for her leaving you hanging, and head for drugs, it's probably to get you to chase after her.  Let her know you care, but will not stand for that kind of life.  She may yell at you, and threaten to stop being your friend, but what you say will weigh on her.  Eventually... hopefully, she'll change.<br>  Good luck!|`|rin6JBSmaa	well she sounds like a *****!<br>  haha im so sorry for you <3<br>  tell her to stop being so rude, and treat you better or she might loose her BEST friend!<br>  cuz thats crazy|`|MQD9Ul8paa	dont get caught up in drugs. youre better than that. if shes invovled in drugs, then stop being her friend if she wont stop|`|o23MmGOOaa	maybe if your bff does not respect your feelings and decisions she is not your bff after all.|`|SOqxJkobaa	there's no question here. you simply posted a story.....|`|bX9PzIVlaa	yeaa...<br>  your point?|`|AA11275104	Well whats your question? if you think you should stop being freinds then yes or tell it to her straight and tell her is she doesn't <br>   change you don't want to be friends. Try to tell her and talk it out. My friend stoped being friends with me because she told me I was annoying but the reality was that she only wanted friends that were here standards so try not to do that.

I'm just down the road, and if you ever need ANYTHING, please feel free to call or come over and ask.|`|q84KT11saa	It might seem a bit intimidating, however just walk up and say "Hi, I'm so and so, just moved in down the street/next door . . ." or "Hi, I'm so and so, I'm new to the area I just wanted to stop by and introduce myself".  Most people will be very welcoming.  I recently moved at the end of October.  I live in a townhouse complex, so the houses here are a little closer together.  I pretty much know everyone on my street.  I talk/visit some more then others.  All I did was when I seen them outside, I walked over and introduced myself.  Find something you have in common and go from there.  It's easier when they have kids cause its an obvious topic of conversation, but the weather is always a great way to get started or something that is going on that effects everyone in the area.

5MFBoWSAaa	You definitely have the right to not want your room and personal belongings on video for just anyone to see. You are right, and your friends are wrong. By telling you that you can never help with movies ever again unless you let them use the footage of your room, they are blackmailing you. They don't sound like real friends to me. I think you should sternly tell them that you do not want that footage on the video, and to take it out, and if they don't let you help with their next videos, then so be it. They're obviously not worth being around.|`|D20JGTwXaa	I think if you let them shoot in your room you should be able to see te footage. If they dnt want to let you ..then their unfair and you don need them anyway.|`|0e4wLPhgaa	you are!!!!! tell them you dont care if you cant help them again but they can not put anything you own on that movie!

LOL|`|bkgBLjuvaa	i'd be a little upset...|`|1hcupwT4aa	If they tried to come back to me I'd be like, "Nah, I'm done for now."<br>  <br>  That's just rude, even if you're just in a regular conversation with someone lol. But sometimes it's necessary, like when a parent calls. I don't care about that. But that's cause I'm young, so applying it to adults only, I think unless it was very important it's just rude. Especially if they try to act like it was nothing...|`|W6pT1Wp3aa	omg that would be a total turn off I would be like okay make out session or sex (whichever the case) over lol and I would be thinking wtf because that's messed up!|`|0ktcvglRaa	Answering the phone during sex can be entertaining.|`|gYuJUyvvaa	That's funny LOL<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Could you please answer mine?<br>  <a href="http://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090307190603AAvQ6mU">http://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|3KAiV9zTaa	i'd be mad. well kinda. don't let me get in my zone while kissing or having sex. ain't no stopping with me when the getting is good. my moods are serious and when you get me in the mood to have sex, i get really serious. if i'm getting to the point where i'm ready, and then he stops, i'd be mad as hell!|`|1jltjtjSaa	I WOULD BE PISSED.<br>  they should be focused on our makeout/sex session they should not just stop to answer a call. if they did that and tried to re-start again id just be like hell no. and i wouldnt start again|`|kg3wV0Czaa	I can understand if it's while you're kissing but if he answered his phone during sex, i'd get really really angry.|`|21TogLbJaa	not very much tell u the truth he is abit cheeky ,how did it make u feel. If they had their mind on something else at the Crucial moments and i realised i would get rid and FOCUS on some one else good luck kid|`|hTieELhTaa	I would tottaly filp the F out big time|`|G3vuJ52Yaa	It's time to take out the trash.|`|JSFCkne8aa	somebody got their little feelings hurt?|`|TT5EvqCgaa	It happens all he time. How would you feel if the phone didnt get answered and something tragic happened that your or your partner needed to know. I would answer or have them answer and if not important make a call back later. I have 3 children and a lot of family that is important to me and if I focused on sex or kissing while my phone was ringing, sex wouldnt probably be that good anyway because then  I would be too worried on what may have been on the phone. So I would be okay with it.|`|QY4uvctMaa	Now that is a funny situation in my eyes. <br>  <br>  If I were you I would make it quite clear to the person he is talking to that he is having sex as he speaks. <br>  <br>  Boy would that guy you are having sex with be embarrassed!|`|S7L8tzpdaa	if he told me slowly like ..heyy, hold up i need to answer this call, i will understand and patiently wait. but if he just snaps off, i will be so damn angry! infact my body would have been drained out all that sexual excitement and all.|`|Gnsw0l9baa	id get pissed
AfnQ95Z5aa	Yes, you are being shallow.  Very much so.|`|06f1b8496562ceae60b7c13272bc0615aa	Yes it is shallow but thats your choice. Do not lead him on if you don't intend to go out with him. What Ive noticed about people I dont think are "beautiful", is that the better I get to know them, the better looking they become. No matter who you end up with in life they will eventually be wrinkly, gray and old. So looks are not the most important thing. You will be old too.|`|1Lo34oEDaa	What? If this is because you are afraid of what yuor friends think then that is just wrong. If your friends judge you that way then they aren't your friends.<br>  <br>  But.... If this is just you then you are being too judgemental if you like him then go for it dont be imbarrased even if there is something wrong with him. <br>  <br>  Its the inside that counts|`|ea411a2c44df3b7648b1c84f352a4902aa	How sad for you.<br>  <br>  You find someone that you click with, but he isn't what you believe your type to be.<br>  <br>  So if he were beautiful but a tool, that would be ok?<br>  <br>  Looks fade.  Solid relationships last.<br>  <br>  Yes you are being shallow.|`|R3AN5WO0aa	i know how you feel, i had the same problem.<br>  but if you don't have any intentions of going out with him then dont lead him on.<br>  if you like him, jut keep him close.|`|0ktcvglRaa	Maybe just be his friend. Can you date someone who is hard to look at?|`|DymaNaBhaa	Depends on how great his personality is...if it is the perfect personality then I would go farther than friendship. Also, if he looked good he could get in a car accident tomorrow and look ugly. Yes, initial attraction is important, but other than that, personality is extremely important. I don't think you are being more shallow than an average human, but it is to a point shallow. If he is perfect, but his face than I would recommend getting over it. A good guy is hard to find.|`|5PWmGqzTaa	The man you will eventually be with probably will not fit your "type." If you think about it, the man you marry will be old and disgusting at some point. So, if you like his personality, go for it. Do not push him aside because he does not fit your "style." The poor boy does not deserve that hun.|`|Asrxi2ZQaa	Thats a bit shallow. Looks arent everything. If your not going to be happy with him spare him and leave him alone. not trying to be mean|`|xZFzDnfzaa	yeah if u like him be like a best friend with him. if he aint right he aint right. theres nothen wrong with that|`|HnkmYdYnaa	that's shallow|`|wrzp7pTHaa	Umm ya thats pretty much shallow..it dont have to go off of looks..|`|U2w775zZaa	Ive been told im shallow for doing exactly what your doing lol|`|kD0zNJLqaa	aww be nice go out with him<br>  im sure hes a great guy

He isn't worth it, and doesn't deserve you.|`|dGBbFwFWaa	if she ever cheated on my that will be the last day she hears from me.. i dont give second chances..not because i dont love her ..but because  i love myself more and i deserve better..|`|PNA7f0q3aa	You need answers from him first. Then i'd dump him [:|`|hNFtO9vXaa	i would leave him..|`|csoqkiDKaa	Leave. People don't change. They can WANT to change and they can TRY to change, but their personality will always be the same. He has an unfaithful personality. You should find someone who knows what they have and doesn't have to seek it from somewhere else to feel sexually validated.|`|5H64mGX1aa	then it is time to MOVE ON|`|eTm9uLqyaa	Been there.<br>  Don't date him again.<br>  Very, very rarely does a guy change..|`|m5tvuGA2aa	i would break up with him

He'll be intrigued and have no choice but to ask "why are you smiling at me" he'll have to make conversation first and then go from there :)|`|0k85cJv2aa	Talk to him!
y9N3DsKBaa	Your acting like a buddy. Start by not calling him Dude. Hey here is an idea why don't you just tell him what you want and see if he is interested.

AA11829392	First of all... RELAX.  Be yourself.  She must like you for who you are. Try to plan things out to make a nice time out... ask her if there is something she might like to do.<br>  <br>  Go with things if they seem right... don't push anything.<br>  <br>  Don't know how old you are, but if you have a good relationship with your parents - don't hide anything.. be honest (less pressure)<br>  <br>  Take it from me, I was young once (a while ago) but you have your whole life ahead of you...  Have a great time!|`|GSf09ALBaa	Be yourself, try and not be so nervous and don't think about it so much.  The more you think 'ok, what should I do now and is this the right time to hold her hand' is just going to make both of you uncomfortable.  <br>  <br>  Chill out.  Let things take it's course.  Whatever you do, DON'T crack stupid jokes.  Tell her she looks nice and open the doors for her.  And do it like you've been doing it all your life.  This is a world where men and women work side by side for the same pay and job but a woman still likes a man to open her door.  I do, and I am a very liberated woman.<br>  <br>  Tell your parents after your first date.  Or before.  How do you feel about it?  <br>  <br>  Have a good time and relax.|`|0ktcvglRaa	Put it in her butt.|`|MgMsMExPaa	Do your parents Really need to know? At the moment you have enough anxiety over the first date with her. Enjoy the movie and maybe have some dessert or ice cream afterward and visit with her and get to know her some. You will not get to talk during the movie so this will be an opportunity to learn about each other. When you part company after the date a good night kiss on the cheek is customary.  If both of you are new to this she may be somewhat surprised by this. But on the other hand if you do not do this she may feel left out. So just do it and make it brief and then leave . Also try to do this somewhere you can have some privacy to minimize ethe surprise some. When you kiss her tell her that you had a good time and tell her you want to see her again.Take  her out for some pizza or other shared food and get to know each other for a couple hours. Tell her what you like and what you want to do with your future . Then let her tell you the same things. If this goes well you will have a better time than going to a movie, because you will be sharing things with each other that are important to both of you. Good luck and try to have fun. Both of you will be nervous but it gets easier fast.|`|XUN1hHCoaa	dont listen just tell ur girl what is so pretty about her and why you like like her.
JavoRs6Raa	Dude, your walking her home.  She likes you man, ask her if she wants to do something sometime.  Go out, have some fun and ya as you said get to know her better.  I you like her keep going out, if not just drop it then.  Keep it real.|`|8445498a066182908045258b3eca3b35aa	ask her during a magnificent convo...
47656d33be33ab59b93a1031373f0c0eaa	Just try your best, do what feels good and what feels natural. If he really loves you he won't care how well you make out, he will just be so happy to be making out with the girl he cares oh so much about... These arn't things you should worry about. He is there to care about you and cherish you, not judge you. If I had a girlfriend who was inexperienced, I'd just be happy that she is making the effort to improve her make out skills, and I'd just be blissful just being with her, spending time with her and above all making out with her. So go for it, life's an adventure, enjoy it!|`|qrfefTcTaa	Well, it will be weird at first, but you figure out how to kiss pretty quickly.<br>  <br>  All i can say is let it naturally come when your ready. If your not ready at that moment, the best thing you can do is be polite (and quiet) about it if you don't. If he gets sort of crazy that you don't, then he valued you as much as he would a toy.<br>  <br>  Guys would kill me for saying this... but please make sure you make the decision yourself, and don't let him make that choice for you.|`|AA10928214	its really easy, everyone does it so it cant be that hard, and it will come naturally.|`|0cHAQgZQaa	If he pressures you, don't let him, but if he convinces you (which is totally different) then make out with him, if he really likes u, he'll be thrilled that you're entrusting him with your tongue and won't care if its bad lol|`|Fue5b9wmaa	just go with the flow. it's a natural thing. You will get it after a bit and giggle if you are nervous, he will think it's really cute.|`|ePFZ5tHqaa	Just be cool about hit and tell him it's your first time and hopefully he will take it slow and you will pick up from there.|`|AA12123717	Listen I am a girl and all and I know you asked for guys but hey if you want to make out or just kiss then go for it he should know that you never have kissed before!! so I say go for it!|`|aPlijTBDaa	if ur ready go 4 it but if ur not dont feel obligated to do so. ok
RbYEif0Waa	what? ask him why, talk him out of it people are gona tell you to have him call so and so but having some one you care about telling you they care about you is better than a stranger doing it!<br>  but yeah maybe she should call hotline and stuff :/
mbfMYmzWaa	I know you don't think so, but honestly your first priority here is making sure HE knows that YOU know, so you can OPENLY try and fix this with his support. If you're having trouble telling him, just look out for an opening to make a subtle comment about it one day. <br>  If for example he's like "I'm thinking of hitting up the beach with the boys on Tuesday" just say something casual like "lol, fair enough... I guess you deserve a break from my stress-head-ness lately" <br>  Or next time you're REALLY having a hard time and he's comforting you, just tell him what it means to you. Be like "aww thanks so much, I'm sorry I've been such a nut lately, lol I SWEAR i'm not usually like this. hahah" <br>  Otherwise, just cook him a massive 'cheers for the patience' feast and when he's like "wow, what's all this" just tell him it's a thankyou present for him putting up with you being such a psycho/clingy/whatever-word-you'd-think-... girlfriend lately.<br>  If you really CAN'T bring yourself to tell him... just wait till the next time alone with his best mate (or at LEAST a mutual friend) and tell him (preferably not a her) instead. This way you know that if your boyfriend ever gets annoyed enough to complain about it, the best mate will bring it up on your behalf...assuming that the best mate likes you. If not, then I'd say there's a bigger problem hun. lol.<br>  If your uncomfortable bringing it up you could wait till you're drunk and have a big D&M with him. lol. Just start it by asking if your boyfriend ever complains about how annoying you are, and then explain why you'd think he might.<br>  <br>  AFTER YOU'VE TOLD HIM, The best way to fix it is to remember what you'd have done before the two of you ever started. I know it's hard, and you often hear people saying "I have KNOW idea how I'd survive without him"... but the fact is, you would've, and you still can. Start by shifting the pressure onto your girl mates, or making some new ones if that's where the problems are in the first place. If that's not an option- a faster fix would be to just FORCE yourself to be comfortable as an individual again. Just get out there! join groups, go shopping, read a book, visit your family, FORCE yourself to remember how to embrace time alone, and you'll eventually find it can be pretty therapudic anyway. Instead of picking up the phone and bitching to him about something, conciously replace that with a mind-occupying activity. Download tetris on your phone and get a tan. Go for a jog with your dog or your ipod, go and buy a new dress or some lingere to surprise him with, bake a cake, there are endless possiblities.... the point is to just give them a go. Don't make an effort to avoid or think about him, just stop making an effort to initiate the contact.|`|XH2o1MM6aa	.Bree we all sometimes need a shoulder to cry on.A guy we can rely on,depend on and listen to our "problems". However if you cry "wolf" to often,you can switch a guy off.So relax and try to put your troubles behind you when in his company.Of course if he asks that's fine but still keep things to a minimum
U37rt445aa	Unfortunately yes-- but not because you're a bibliophile, nor because you're from Saturn. Some girls can be pretty immature, and get an ego-boost from scorning some one's interest in them. These girls are better to stay away from-- eventually they'll have their turn in the heartbreak game as well.<br>  <br>  Hang in there-- there are plenty of beautiful girls who like bibliophillic Saturnites!|`|seMpUL8Kaa	I really don't see why anyone would hate you...|`|y9N3DsKBaa	Of course.

Small things can really help :) <br>  <br>    Very Best Wishes|`|OEATSehSaa	look him in the eyes and smile a bit.he will get the hint and do the next step.you can ask me anything else|`|k4bAhRXKaa	well my friend is almost like u except she doesnt have any classes with the guy she likes but...anyways...the way she became friends with her crush was by getting his phone number and calling him....they dont talk as much as i talk with him...but at least they talk and anyways boys are just a big mystery and its up to the girls to find out what there boy language means..well anyway hope this helped <br>  -<3-denis
fAbig2ZDaa	Well,<br>  Sounds like to be that he likes annoying you!<br>  <br>  OR<br>  He just saying this because he wants you.<br>  <br>  Either way, it sounds to me that he is messed up if he cant stop talking about his dick and stuff around you.|`|dIxOyTcLaa	He likes you|`|kD0zNJLqaa	tring to turn you on<br>  try saying yes|`|AA10626566	making you curious - sounds like it's working
nZPGdcKJaa	it makes me feel better if nothing else<br>  I just saw a question where the wife wasn't getting enough sex.  I've been posting the same question about once a year for the past 3 years.  I'm glad I'm not alone and I think I gave her good info/advice on her question.<br>  <br>  actually right before I deployed last year we were having issues and someone here suggested counseling. We did it and it helped.  I had never thought about actually doing it, but just having people here give advice helps|`|a8f5edcc140b36ea895725f1c1fa0ff7aa	i always hope i help someone out there..even if it just makes them feel better. but actually some advice that was given to others i used to help inspire my own life.....so yeah!|`|IvMPh09baa	yes... some... alot was suggestions of counseling and such, but i think the good honest answers helped me... the ones coming from people telling me common sense things.  i think the biggest thing for me is knowing that i am not the only married woman in the world going through all these struggles, it feels better knowing there are other women out here going through the same.

1Ayb4UK7aa	For the past 6 years I have seen my husband an average of 5 days a month.  His job keeps him away from home.  There are many things we don't get to do together and there are quite a few family get togethers he misses out on but we make the most of what time we do spend together.  If he is happy doing what he does and the bills are paid, don't push him.  He may resent you for it later and who knows what that could lead to.|`|y9CgveCGaa	The time to figure out whether his career plans matched with what you wanted for a future were before you got married.  Maybe he can move to a more upscale restaurant and earn more money.  I don't know.  How about your own career?  Can you make up the difference?|`|YNd65b3kaa	I don't know how you're making it financially.  My son was in the industry but he caught a break and joined an institute as a restaurant mgmt teacher. <br>  <br>  The problem is that your hub may be stuck in the only industry in which he feels comfortable.  If that's the case, he should try to make himself more valuable by either stepping up in the grade restaurant he works in or attending school (which might make it tougher on you for a while.)  But good luck.  You seem very intelligent and you'll help him, I'm sure.<br>  <br>  But you also must consider that right now is a dangerous time to lose a job (but perhaps not in this industrry. I don't know.)  But trying to change industries now might be quite difficult.  My neighbor, an independent master carpenter, has no work coming in and can't land a job.<br>  <br>  I understand your pickle but right now, and maybe for a year, it may be well to not push the envelope too hard.|`|aROi7KG5aa	No it is not bad of you to want better for your family, your future children.<br>  <br>  Reminds me of my husband of 30 years !<br>  We have 7 wonderful children and I would not change my life for anything !<br>   He didn't make a lot of money ( and still doesn't)but we made it.<br>  I was a stay at home mom too which I never regret doing!<br>  <br>  My husband always "kinda" talked about going to college and get an education but time got away from us. Before we knew it the years passed and he still did not have that education or a better job.<br>  <br>  Personally I had and have no desire for wealth and material things.<br>  From the way you talk I think you probably feel the same way. <br>  Just enough to pay the bills and have a little left over.<br>  <br>  I would encourage you to talk with him and tell him your concerns and how important it is to you.<br>  Do not let the years get away from you like we did.<br>  Education is extremely important to avoid living pay check to pay check.<br>  <br>  I wish you and your husband the very best !|`|wXaGIPSPaa	When I married my husband he had just gotten out of the military and had been working construction. I remember how head over heels in love I was. I thought, I want to be with him forever even if we live in a box Ill be happy! lol   A couple years later I was thinking, he is so smart he should go to law school.  I hinted then later 'encouraged' but he showed no interest. He said he hated school and didnt want to go back. I was disappointed.  I started concentrating on that and I started thinking ....what about our future...I dont want to live pay to pay all my life.  All of a sudden that cardboard box didnt look so great! <br>  Then one day it hit me. I could focus on all the things I was crazy about him or I could make myself unhappy and ruin my marriage. After all wasnt I saying that my way was the smart right way for us?  I knew what he was when I said I do, was it right to rewrite the story?<br>  I decided I would get my masters degree and I would do all I could do to secure my part of the future with him.  If he wanted to take a class wth me for fun or if he wanted to look into other careers I would support him and help in any way I could. I found out that he was right there for me. He didnt try to tell me what career to do or that I should stay home barefoot and preg. He was just like 'do what makes you happy' and Ill help.  Amazing man for me. <br>  So I understand what you are saying.  But this is somehting that has to come from his heart. Maybe he is low self esteem? maybe he is happy where he is at and isnt as ambtious as you are.  Maybe you were like me and didnt really discuss it or care when you first found him.  I dont know but all you can do is make him aware of how you feel then accept him as he is. If you dont the message he gets is 'Im not acceptable to my wife,she thinks im a weak failure of a man' and well...I probably dont have to tell you this but there are women out there who will tell him if you dont. <br>  I hope you find your answers and peace.  Good marriages dont just happen and arent easy. They take sacrifice and work.  Good luck sweetie.|`|sGlCZgbDaa	sheesh woman all ya do is complain. why dont YOU do somethign to fix da problemmmmmmm|`|VIKXnXuTaa	Well you knew he did this before you married him right?<br>  <br>  Our job as women is to support and respect our husband, not change him.  I think he will have to decide for himself.  In the meantime, don't live beyond your means.<br>  <br>  What other talent do you see in him?  Maybe he would one day work for corporate head office of the restaurant.  Encourage the talents you see.<br>  <br>  If you were to stay home to raise your children he would have great peak day hours to do stuff with you and the children. <br>  <br>  Putting kids to bed is the hardest part of parenting (imo).  Yes that might be hard to do alone.  It would also be very hard if you do return to work. Really you need to make over $30,000 a year yourself if you would return to work after children, because basically that's how much child care costs.<br>  <br>  Once the kids are in school, seeing dad at night, especially around the dinner table is important.<br>  <br>  Other men in his position must do it, maybe research how they make it work.|`|a8f5edcc140b36ea895725f1c1fa0ff7aa	i work at night, my wife works at day and we have one child, and one on the way. and i dont get to see my family much until the weekends. its a balancing act but with a lot of prayers and love God helps us through it. this does save us tons of money on daycare though./ maybe your husbands not ready to make a career change yet. some people are just happy doing what they do. who knows he might own a restaurant some day!<br>  <br>  hey i know its tough, find a way to inspire him though, in a positive way of course.|`|m3ThrbDMaa	Simply (without being preachy preachy) tell him what you think about what you just said, let him know how you feel, and let him know this is one of those "marriage things" that's important to you...(over a glass of wine or whatever when he's relaxed enough to talk about something serious...and build up to the conversation gently, without springing it on him like a guillotine...<br>  <br>  Start using the internet to help him find a better career while he's working, write his resume and cover letter for him, line up some possibilities, go over those possibilities with him, and just be a "partner" with him in this career-changing endeavor, and be patient...<br>  <br>  These kind of things take some time...

For a single person either could be just as bad or one could be worse.  I was molested as a young child and remember everything fully.  I took it rather well, as well as someone could take it.  I use it as a lesson.  As a mother I will not let anyone in the house to watch my children or be alone with my children.  If anything happens to my husband I will not bring another male into my children life until they are old enough to defend themselves.  <br>  For males research shows that if the are physically/sexually abused they are more likely to abuse their children.  This is far from always being the case but it is more likely.  <br>  Females that are sexually abused are prone to being more promiscuous but are far less likely to sexually abuse children (the stats are so low that they are rarely published).  <br>  Of course both types of physical abuse promote drug and alcohol abuse.<br>  Again I think both a horrific but for me I think I would have taken physical abuse as worse for me.  In general I believe sexual abuse is more detrimental in females but that is an opinion.

KOjVWXOCaa	I know what you mean, he was your first love, but he will not be your last love. I know that you do not want to hear this , but life goes on. Sometimes God put people in and out of your life for a reason, maybe he is moving out the way for a new love in your life. When he said "Don't cry for me, I'm not worth it", he was right he's not worth it. As soon as you move on, trust me he will try to get you back, then you could tell him "Don't cry for me, go on with your life". Most men are so selfish they don't want to see you happy, they want to see you cry over them. Even though, they are moving on with their lives, they don't want you to move on. As soon as they see you moving on, they want to move on to you again. It happens too often men are so selfish, move on sweetheart. There is someone better for you, it takes time to get over your first love. Get out the house, call a freind , go to a movie and enjoy life.|`|b0sYGE05aa	try and find someone knew thats what im gonna do or maybe talk to him. dont get into addicting drugs it sucks dont do it.|`|HSADGmMMaa	Time helps. So does finding other things to do...with friends, hobbies, school, work, etc.|`|QhXL4Lilaa	To be honest with you, I'm going through the same situation, however, I know how to get over this person, but something in side doesn't want to... <br>   #1. Tell yourself you are done with him and mean it, you can't wait for him to call you back or change, tell yourself "I can do better" and mean it honestly.<br>  #2. Remind yourself how bad of a jerk he is, and how he made you cry, and he didn't give a damn; when you needed him and he was nowhere to be found. Don't forget about the hard times, remind yourself you can do better and there is someone that will treat you like a queen.<br>  #3. What he says to you is how he feels, don't think he means something else, so when he tell you "Don't cry for me, I'm not worth it." Thats exactly what he means, and he's actually giving good advice to you. <br>  #4. Listen to music that helps you get over someone... I don't know what type of music you like so I can't go into detail with that one....<br>  #5. Realize this sweetie, If he wanted to talk to you, he could. He's not crying, he's not worrying about you, so why waste your tears on him? Why stress yourself so much and he's not doing the same? <br>  #6. Crying is actually the best way... Balling up makes you stronger and it helps you to realize that you shouldn't feel that way... the more you cry the more you will realize... <br>  <br>  Good luck
wurUbtLUaa	Sweetheart you dont have a psychological problem, its called confusion.<br>  If your man has been stressed then thats going to fall back onto you also, because when men are stressed and focused on a work, family, or personal problem they focus on that one problem at a time....which is why you feel neglected. The thing i see happening here is that the stress from both of your lives is causing strain on the relationship, and because your both trying to focus on fixing the problems the stress is making you think that the relationship wont work.  <br>  There are times in my relationship where i know for a fact that my man could go for 1 to 2 wks without talking to me because hes under so much stress. I know it would be nothing against me though because men withdraw when they are stressed and understanding they are like this helps. I have felt neglected heaps of times and thought he was so selfish, hes not though. I have learnt that i need to give him his space, and when i want something then to directly ask for it. I know not all men are like this, though theres something about your situtation thats telling me he is. Until you find out if your pregnant i wouldnt stress. <br>  Maybe take some time to yourself and go and have some fun. If it does happen that you are pregnant then just tell him. There are so many woman that have babies and lose their man, or their job. Its not a bad thing sweety, its life. Good Luck and stay positive.|`|13d4bd226d0dce7fe19e7693dc8cfed9aa	as soon as u get preg, hes leaving you. he dosnt have a job and has u doin all the work,,,,   where can i find a girl like that?|`|9NXtWzUOaa	if you can get yourself pregnant....you have more problems than you realize.|`|CEhBVZLfaa	25 years old !!!you'r still young ,it is a good time to think about having a degree than having a baby do not rach your self,take it easy on your self .about your man do not drive him crizzzy,you need him if not as a boyfrined take  him as a good friend .good luck.|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	One slip up in 6 years doesn't translate into 'a serious psychological problem'. Stress can certainly make your hormones go all out of whack, and with that comes a disruption of your stability, but it does not mean you are crazy. In fact, crazy people don't know they're crazy.<br>  <br>  Relax, you've got a lot on your plate as does your guy.<br>  <br>  Take care of the little things, then the big things will fall into place.|`|nZPGdcKJaa	you can always abort or adopt<br>  it sounds like you just need a really good friend and you're irritated with him because he isn't there, but that's not fair because his dad is in the hospital.<br>  just put things into perspective and try to take a step back and look at everything separately.  Don't let all of your problems be one HUGE massive falling out.  You'll drive yourself crazy and accomplish nothing or even make things worse.
lD1B9pL7aa	i'm getting married on May 23, 2009 and i just started planning it two months ago. it wasn't hard to find a place to hold my wedding/reception but my fiance and I wasn't able to go with the one we wanted because we didn't want to change our wedding date and the ones on our top list were already booked some even a year in advance. <br>  <br>  if there is really nothing you can do to change your parent's mind and you and your fiance do not have the money to reserve the venue then stop stressing out about it. it will only make things worse. Just realize that you WILL be able to find a place for your reception, it might not be the one you want but like my fiance told me "where or how we get married isn't what's important, what's important is that you will become my wife and I will become you husband. As long as that is the ending result nothing else matters." <br>  <br>  What's the point in getting yourself all worked up over something you can't change except for sleepless nights and stupid fights. Remember that getting married is a way of showing eachother how much you mean to one another, just let all the stress and frustration go.|`|AA11371251	you might find a place with a great deal but you might have to be willing to switch the date around or end up at a place you don't want to get married at. Just because the economy sucks doesn;t mean people aren't going to get married. I booked 6 months in advance and went in with I want a saturday in June the place I went with luckily had one left and I booked it that day. My date I had picked out was taken everywhere I went. Also you could do this...go look at places and ask them how filled they are already and how booked they normally get that time of the year. The place I went with said we could wait until a week before the wedding to put a deposit down unless someone else asked for that date and then if we wanted it we would have to rush to put the deposit down to keep the others from taking it. Fact is if you find THE place DO NOT wait and if that is THE DATE you WON'T change then DON"T WAIT! Good luck, Congrats|`|vyL7yEleaa	2-3 months you are really really pushing it. specially since September is the end of the bridal season but some places specially in the major area's are already booking up. <br>  <br>  you need to take your parents out with you and let them hear from the vendor themselves how busy they will be. and ask if they can pencil you in.. you have the money but you won't be able to get it till a certain time. most places will pencil you in and if someone wants your date they will call you and let you know so you can say okay.. i got the money i will come put money down..<br>  <br>  and didn't you already post this question a few minutes ago?
uJpmd7G5aa	thats the problem<br>  it might make your friendship a little awkward if you go out but I think you should. Because overtime yalls friendship will be how it was before. But this is your opion, I would do what people on YahooAnswers say. We are just here to give you opions. Do whatever you want and I hope everything ends up good.<br>  <br>  -Michael|`|47TSqkEGaa	I cared about my best friend and he and I ended up dating. He didn't feel the same for a while. But we dated my senior year, even though things didn't work out between us. I don't think you should have posted that question if you explained that you are not in love with him in the description of the question. I think that you may be lusting for him. Love and lust are two different things. Lust is when you care about him, but you deep down know that you and him wouldn't work out. Love is when you feel as if you and the person are meant to be. I wouldn't suggest dating him until you know how HE feels. That may mean asking him yourself. I would just be like, "Do you feel for me as more than a friend?" and I would not suggest asking if he'd ever consider dating you, because it may scare him or he might take that out of context. But do not play games with him, don't play with his heart.
779f397084aa4666983d22c2e4d1a290aa	i would confront him if i were you.|`|6d08d4117b506d7d5e374a3b065bb49caa	Actually you CAN do alot its if you are WILLING to do anything.

You should begin by telling them that since they have given you so much responsibility you are going to take it and this meeting is to make life better for everyone involved.  Then you should explain that in the long haul it is better for everyone if there is an equitable division of labor.  The reasons include giving your dad and brother the experience they need to take care of themselves when you're no longer around as well as allowing you the time you need for school and your ongoing development.  Tell them that you don't mind doing your share, but no more.  Then go on and remind them that this is the 21st century and the days of women's work are over.  Be sure to emphasis that this is what is best for the entire family, everyone pitching in for the good of the whole.|`|UPk2HLtiaa	ahahh well first off im good and second oh i completely know how you feel but i have a mom 2 brothers and a sister and i clean the whole house mop the floor and everything and do laundry and trust me its not fun my brother is the owner of our 2 cats and im the one stuck cleaning the litter box whats up with that?|`|dNj1RjWHaa	do the guys just sit around and not even try to help? if so, say something, or just do a bad job and say its "that" time of the month can you help me? then of course do it more and more often till they would prefer to do it themselves! LOL. i'll bet it works|`|Eysw4NUJaa	that sucks about the chores, and i get what you mean because i have two brothers.... im good....tired, but good......     you could always beat them....
VqWBGWAoaa	First of all, you have to lose the mentality of "This girl is different. I don't want to **** things up with this one." Instead of thinking that way you need to be thinking "Next!" if things don't turn out.<br>  Furthermore, once you achieve that mentality you'll be able to go out and do things with her without having that anxiety--you cannot be humored and anxious at the same time. Having anxiety means you have low confidence as well and shows through physical nervousness, or you start acting like a victim.... It goes on. You also want to be a fun guy to be around while being with her. Happiness is infectious and she'll like being around you.<br>  <br>  Anyway, that's in response to "I really do not want to **** this up"<br>  <br>  Now about your date. I think taking a girl out to a movie isn't a good idea. A date is about getting to know each other and you aren't exactly doing that while watching a movie at the theatres. <br>  Dinner dates are meh because you're wasting financial resources. A coffee date is nice and inexpensive and you won't have to pay for her.<br>  <br>  But things look good based on how she responded to you holding her and hugging her; she was laughing at your jokes; you kissed her. You seem to be escalating things at an okay pace.<br>  <br>  Why did she not respond to your kiss? Well, what if she wanted a kiss on the lips? This is really where you need to know as a guy WHEN.<br>  <br>  I have one last thing to say: When in doubt just do nothing. Just do nothing. That doesn't mean sit at home. It means don't text, don't call, don't email, don't IM her, don't Facebook poke her. Distract yourself. Don't contact her just because you're bored and thinking of her. All that does is signal neediness, like crazy. It's one of those red flags. Wait a few days to see if she contacts you.|`|rUPVDszEaa	i think she didn't respond because she was surprised. I also think that the kiss her on the forehead was cute. I think your date went well. very romantic. :)|`|fMWmXD2faa	dude she is SHY....what do u expect? slap u in the face?|`|ZpmLzxpyaa	She probly froze dood U stunned her.<br>  LOL it went good though cause she wants a second date SO GOOD JOB LUVMACHINE  :]]]|`|4AHGY6jnaa	LMAO you kissed her on the forehead.<br>  <br>  Well you say she's the kind you'd bring home to your parents so she's probably a little more proper of a girl. Therefore she might not want to kiss you on the first date. Snuggling yes, kissing no.
b0Q6ecqzaa	i wish girls would be that direct!  i hate going back and forth trying to interpret signs that may or may not be real.  when in doubt, i typically don't pursue.  so if a girl were that forward, it would make my life a lot easier. lol|`|EQDyE8Rpaa	well im a girl but id say to go for it cuz guys usually like a girl whos very straight forward and not playing all these mind games say wat u feel|`|gYuJUyvvaa	I would be like...<br>  <br>  ...?<br>  ...?<br>  ...?<br>  ...?<br>  ...?<br>  ...Now :)|`|KSJhYH2yaa	Make him wait, so he realizes what he is "chasing" once he gets it, and how important it is. I'm a guy, and this, I think, is the most effective way to make it last.|`|vwoqIUR6aa	may sound like flirting or some may take it seriously. you should watch for the reaction. if he stops talking and gets quiet, he''s thinking about it or you put him in an awkward position.|`|dNrrT1gkaa	If you have to ask him, then he aint gonna know what do do with you|`|x62wDqmRaa	It would be better to be more subtle and illusive.|`|yThJq8Dyaa	I mean I would like it because I wouldn't have this constant guessing game if the girl likes me or not. Playing hard to get can be a brain zapper. If he likes you than he most likely won't care how you both start going out. But to be on the safe side, say it in a less direct way. Make it obvious but discrete at the same time. good luck|`|C5bhtFXpaa	i think a lot of us guys like girls who can take control and be assertive like that. i know my friends and i always talk about how we hate having to be the ones to make the first move all the time|`|Xkl1Ukpraa	You're waaaaay overthinking this.<br>  Guys are simple-minded creatures.

Try not to sound sluttyish when you say it.|`|axylPYftaa	it would definitely take her out|`|Ly37Dhvxaa	direct is good. Coz it's easier.|`|2oH2En8maa	It depends on the guy. I know that if you were the girl I liked it would break the ice with me and I would feel a lot more confident it asking you because I wouldn't be afraid of the rejection. I can't say it would turn me off because if I liked you, it wouldn't matter.|`|Qhw1UZOiaa	No you should ask her out because alot of girls ask me that and I thought the same thing but I lost out on good looking girls she just sound easy.
otAH6brTaa	I learned this from watching a great new show that's on TV called Lie To Me...<br>  <br>  When a person smiles their eyes tighten and wrinkle.  See if you notice *not* doing this the next time you smile at someone you pass by.  Those types of smiles are usually quick ways of saying "hey, I acknowledge you". lol<br>  <br>  PS  You want to scrunch the outer sides of your eyes, not the center (or it looks like the "are you lying?" expression!)|`|03wW9tnqaa	Maybe think of something that makes you smile and hope you smile?
jGKGlxAuaa	Don't reply. Play hard to get, and see how much he will do to get your attention.<br>  <br>  Make him work for that next date with you!! He is taking you for granted.|`|XiOIBwbPaa	reply to him, and when you are with him, talk to him about how you feel about all of this, don't let him ignore it..if you don't like some things he does then talk to him.|`|D1AFV4ZXaa	replyyy for sure.|`|vgWtWmXxaa	Reply and say that you're busy and that maybe you guys can get together another time.

If you really feel that he is taking you for grante, open up too him and see how he responds. If he wants to pursue a relationship, that is your choice.

So you should see him.|`|x7NtYD8Aaa	yeah you should hang out with him. My girl always does that and it annoys me when she says no i feel takin for granted so yeah.|`|mWqBMGknaa	YOU SHOULD MAKE HIM TELL YOU HOW HE REALLY FEELS ABOUT YOU...DON'T ALWAYS BE AVAILABLE|`|yiR5W3hlaa	i think he is trying to hook u up with that male guy....i don' t think he is interested<br>  don't reply|`|ygOWsECXaa	suck on his weiner
QYXFai9Kaa	Because you may be a little more sincere and passionate unable to control your emotions; <br>  <br>  Advice : apply some brakes on your heart and start using your head in decision making.|`|9tcTtw6Vaa	It's called love, girl, and it's something that you can't control. Just take some time for yourself before making anymore commitments. You need to step back and clear your vision...it's all just too much to take in right now. Find what you want to do for YOU instead of for someone else, and then see how you feel. Just remember to take care of yourself, while not shutting yourself away from other people. Good luck:)
STJdWQdNaa	You should make a move and ask her out. In my opinion she wants to get your attention and see if u r interested in her or not. She is testing you. She likes you and even though she hangs out with other guys maybe she's trying to make u jealous. Go ask her out!!!|`|s4vZ2zRSaa	personally i think shes trying to make you jelous. especially if her best friend is saying hi and noticing you too. if she didnt like u her bff woudnt be doing that. thats my opinion. but u never know girls can be hard to read about that stuff and she may just be very flirty but to me it does sound like she might be interested. if you are that curious about it then just ask her and see what she says, what have you got to lose?|`|rh3RNM5faa	Lol? You still keep asking this? This info might even be made up and that girl might not even exist.... And how would you see her chatting on facebook? She would be at her house.. What a fake story.

rAvZ9yGcaa	High school guys are usually immature.  I only know two mature high school guys.  They want you to know they like you so that they can keep you in their grasp.  They want to be with you for things besides just being with you.<br>  <br>  I would never date a guy if all he could tell me was I looked hot.  And of course, I would never date a guy who rated me on a scale, because that's just a bunch of BS.  <br>  <br>  Does that help you understand why they're morons when they're actually with you?  They're just players.  Try to find a guy who actually says things to you like "You're so smart, I love talking to you" instead of "you're a 10!"|`|1QSsOAAFaa	I think the second statement about the immaturity of young guys is very true. The vast majority of them are going to be looking for quick hookups until they grow up or are forced to settle down.<br>  This is why most women date older guys (at least a couple years older.) and I don't blame them. (Hope I don't sound too shrill of a feminist, lol.)|`|ikEc3yK2aa	chances are, you aren't going to stay with the boys you meet in high school for the rest of your life..so dont stress. maybe you just need to make more guy friends, than boyfriends. boyfriends just make life difficult, and look at other girls in the process. good luck, and enjoy being so young!|`|eLjbdmkWaa	guys in teens tend to be really immature in relatioships. and the girl is always determined in a relatioship. mayb it helped you a lil bit|`|0ECz0WwCaa	yes, guys often want random hook-ups which means there's really nothing at stake once in the relationship<br>  <br>  maybe they don't care that much because you're as shallow as you sound|`|rInv89Xnaa	I think guys at that age are just looking for hook-ups. not a real relationship!! <br>  Answer mine? <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090307181504AAZnFgR&r=w">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|0aaa10bf1334628de7df8d1527e7a5a7aa	You teach people how to treat you. If your men don't step up to the plate, it's because you haven't required them to. Some of them probably need to be told where the plate is (or that there IS a plate). Why treat a guy like a king if he's acting like a schnook?!?!?! As for no.2, see the first sentence. Where are your standards young lady? There are better men out there, just tell them what you require. You seem to spend a lot of time in unsatisfactory relationships, and you DON'T seem to care what anyone thinks of you including you. Start valuing yourself more: many of those around you seem to!|`|dfd9ac07fab82472b63734b8b0351d75aa	Your treat them too good. It's a give take thing, the better you treat them the worse they treat you. Your personality attracts those dudes. And yes most guys that age are all about hook ups, it's genetic, spread the seed type of thing.|`|2731f491811c730a7a9f4dcfa6ef44d7aa	i wish i had an answer, im in the EXACT same predicament|`|l0oDymHYaa	Hi Dear<br>  <br>  Stop treating you date like a King.

You probably won't find one that will treat you right for a couple more years. Guys at that age are more about sex and their friends than treating their girlfriend, who is determined to have a good relationship, the way she deserves to be treated. They just like you're looks, they don't really care about who you are as a person right now, but in a few years, they'll regret that.|`|SNr7R0Z0aa	There's a big difference between noticing how much success some one has and loving who they are.|`|555d2a2f986c297f9fed6611701e0309aa	With respect to maturity - girls are typically 2 years ahead of their male counterparts.  Because of this, you can anticipate a guy your same age not at all being on the same level, emotionally, as you are.  Additionally, many guys will be intimidated by a really good 'catch'.  They will feel that you are either too pretty and/or too smart for them anyway so they will give up before they begin trying.  In order to avoid this you would need to build them up a little.  You already think very highly of yourself so now you need to compliment them, let them know that you think they, too, are great!  Once they get more secure in believing that you think they are also a great catch, they may hang around a bit longer and invest more time in a relationship with you instead of jumping ship before it even gets out in the water!  <br>  <br>  Best of luck :)|`|fvN18yvGaa	You hit it on the head..the majority of guys at that age seem not to want to commit..Now there are a few exceptions..but are u ready for a serious relationship...I dont agree but the majority of ppl tend to say at ur age date as u like and experience friendships it will mature u emotionally...Me I was ready to get married in Highschool...I knew that I could be with one person and I was tired of all the relationship B.S..

AA10250756	Sounds like she's changed her mind and wants to get together again. She's made it pretty clear. The next time she asks you if you're dating anyone, say, "What about dating you?"|`|uuJszgCsaa	Just walk up to her or text her, etc. and be like "hey do you wanna go out?" if she says yeah, be like cool. if she says no be like okay .
AA11263103	1. Examine his body language. If he likes you, you may see that he rarely turns his back to you, often leans towards you, and also looks at you a lot. Both his feet will point towards you if he's comfortable with you, but if he's uncomfortable with you, one foot will be pointing at you and the other will be pointing at another girl.<br>  2. Notice his eye contact. If he likes you, he may either look away quickly if he is shy, or he'll try to catch your eye and hold it or make faces. This can be uncomfortable if you don't like him. If you feel like you have held eye contact just a fraction of a second longer than you would with anyone else, or if he looks away quickly, then there is something there. When he's around you and he says/does something funny and everyone around laughs, his eyes will flicker towards you for a second to see if you laughed, too.<br>  * His pupils may dilate if he likes you, but this is quite hard to pick up on, and you might come across as acting strangely by looking that closely into his eyes. If you're around him for a long time, it could be easier to pick up on gradually.<br>  * Hint: If you like him, your pupils may be dilated. Check a mirror, then see if his eyes are similar.<br>  3. When a guy likes you he will try and make himself seem impressive to you.<br>  * Listen to what he's saying. If he likes you, and he's nervous, he'll probably start talking about himself. Many times, guys feel the need to prove themselves- especially if you talk about another guy in his company.<br>  4. Be aware of touching. He might put his hand on your arm when he laughs, and won't move his leg if it happens to touch yours, or he may hug you for small things - all are good signs of a guy liking you. But be careful because this may be a result of him just being nice to you and not fancying you.<br>  5. Watch for him showing interest in things you like and do. For example, if you like a certain genre of music that he likes as well, he may suggest bands or artists for you to listen to. Another example, if you play sports he may ask to play against you just to show off that he's good at something you both like and then also have a reason to give you compliments as well.<br>  6. Notice the way he treats you - does he playfully tease you, or call you names, just to try and get your attention? It's natural for a guy to tease when he likes a girl, but remember, someone can still tease someone, even if they aren't attracted to them. Also, keep in mind that some guys simply will not tease you.<br>  7. Check for signs of nervousness Nervous laughter, sweaty palms, deep breaths, fidgeting, looking away quickly when you notice if he is watching you are all good signs of an attraction towards you and that he is nervous about making an impression on someone he fancies. Also notice if you call his name, does his head snap around right away or does it turn gradually?<br>  8. Smile at him- a big smile in return is a good sign. Also, see if he always ends up in the same part of the room as you; perhaps he keeps going out of his way to bump into you and to flash his smile in your direction. If so, then smile back!<br>  9. Pay attention to his friends. If they know he's interested in you, they might tease him subtly when you're around, hint to you that he likes you, or even try to find out if you like him. Study their reactions to your presence - do they smile? Do they turn to him? Do they smirk in a way that suggests they know something that you don't? Maybe when they dare him in games of truth and dare, they always dare him to do something to you. If so, then there's a good chance that they know that he really does like you.<br>  10. Be open! Give him room to approach you and talk to you - it can ruin the situation if he hasn't got any opportunity to do so, for example if your friends are giggling in the background, or you are never on your own.<br>  11. Pay attention to how many times he uses your name. If you talk to him often, watch how many times he uses your first name. People tend to use your name to get your attention, and it shows that they think about you! For example, if you say something, and he replies with "ha ha, nice, [ name here ]" it means he thinks about what he is saying more than if he replies with "ha ha, nice." The second doesn't mean he doesn't like you, but using your name is usually a tell-tale sign.<br>  12. Notice his behavior in conversation. Sometimes when guys ask you questions and other people distract the conversation or cut him off, he'll just forget about it. If you notice that he keeps asking or changing the subject back to the question until you answer, then he may like you - but if the topic is something serious, he may just want to know out of curiosity.<br>  13. He'll flirt with other girls to get your attention- If a guy is really into you he will want to make you jealous. So, he will most likely flirt with other girls in front of you. It gives them a chance to see your real self.

vgWtWmXxaa	She might like you. Or maybe she just likes smiling and staring at people. Sometimes when I'm in class.. I just find myself looking at people, and then they look up.. and I just smile and look away. So weird, I know. The eye-contact/smile thing doesn't mean too much. If other things happen.. maybe you'll get the hint that she has a crush on you. But for now, don't look into it too much.
seMpUL8Kaa	You have a bad view of women...<br>  <br>  **so give her the benefit of the doubt, or at least ask her straight out if she likes you or someone else, that way, you know where you stand.

I guess you just got to ask her and find out straight.**|`|iJzlRCkOaa	I actually do everything possible to have guys NOT like me.

I try SO HARD to make them not like me, but that just makes them like me even more!  What the hell?!  I finally like a guy for the first time in 6 months (after a relationship with an especially pathetic guy), and I probably can't even get him because other depressed guys like, touch me and flirt with me and stuff.  ARGH!|`|uaHzhUeoaa	I, personally, wouldn't go very far if he didn't show any interest.

L1ip6ohVaa	I probably won't touch his arm while eating or patting his knee- those can be really forced if you don't have a reason to touch him. You want to have a legitimate reason to touch him- such as if your trying to direct him somewhere.<br>  <br>  My favorties:<br>  <br>  The greeting hug- When you see him, walk up and give a hug. It's bolder, but does the most damage to the touch barrier.<br>  <br>  Touching his shoulder to move him in a specific direction. Say you want to point something out to him or steer him in a specific direction. Instead of saying, "look over there," gently turn him in that direction. This also works if you want to walk in a specific direction.<br>  <br>  If your sitting next to each other in a loud situation (crowded, movie, etc), put your hand on his shoulder as you lean to talk to him.<br>  <br>  Good luck!
aITWZoQzaa	I'm 39 and I don't think I could.  Nothing against the guy's, I just wouldn't want to be labeled with the cougar stigma.
XJi0l3JUaa	Okay sorry, but buying expensive things won't get your true friends.  I ahve tons of groups of friends and I can hang out with different people at different times.  It braodens and opens you up to better new people which is a good thing.  And don't let the popular girls get to you, because if you haven't noticed, so many of them participate in activities that are not for the faint of heart and that may be illegal.  Be yourself and don't try to be someone you are not to get friends.  in life you will keep some lifelong friends and lose others along the way.  that is just life.  And having a best friend is fine, I don't have one and it really doesn't bother me.|`|ufTjv25Jaa	Get over yourself.|`|AA10545938	idc what the hell you have to think about your life. just go kill yourself|`|bBSYxQlAaa	Let It Go<br>  the people tht u like the MOST hang out with them!
xv4Xfuspaa	i would say no.<br>  i dont see any connection whatsoever between cheating and physical violence.<br>  but thats just me.<br>  it seems the two acts (while both pretty bad) are in completely different leagues.<br>  although perhaps,, an inclination to cheating may mean they are bending what they see as right in a realtionship so they MAY be abusive.<br>  but definitely not all cheaters.
jGKGlxAuaa	Give him Dr. Ruth's phone number. Maybe your not emotionally connected, and just going through the motions.|`|cHBcR0Chaa	there are some help dvds out there. u could try numbing lube for him, if his penis is numb he will last longer. try getting drunk or atleast drinking a little bit, that way his walls will drop and he should be more into new things. if he likes u as much as u like him he should be willing to listen to you and what your needs are in bed. he should want to try to please you. if not, sorry to say but yea sex is very important and you might need to someone else who can please you.
TEhhtS3Raa	I understand completely.... I have no parents and I went through foster care my parents were hooked on drugs and could not function well enough to raise me I grew up with my grandmother and I never got a chance to understand the joys of family meaning... affection. I now am 26 with a 2 year old daughter and cry from time to time because I feel she will be my only family to me, My brother also does not talk to me, and from the lack of  affection I can not feel the lost in that. My advice to you love the family you have in front of you they will not be there forever, I feel the urge to cry from time to time when I see mothers and daughters together because I never had that feeling and never will.<br>  It just seems like maybe when they were growing up they had a feud between the family and just do not wish to share your life with them, your parents may just need to find the heart to forgive and forget, it's okay worry about it after they are long gone just learn to forgive and forget do not hold a grudge against your family no matter the situation.. I still would speak to my brother to this day because even though I see him in the wrong I forgive him.|`|4a55ee096cdf2c2fd10e78a12a479d92aa	well that sucks! <br>  well remember to be thankful that you have any sort of family, some young girls have no one. but here is what you should do...<br>  <br>  try and contact a relative. maybe find an old address book, x-mas card, letter, or anything!? If you can, find out what city they're in and their names you can look them up via internet. It just takes some effort in tracking people down, but if you REALLY need to do it, than you can.|`|AfnQ95Z5aa	Uh, 48 - 40 is 18, not 15.|`|0muvYszmaa	so why do your parents not talk to you? please explain, maybe your relatives are dead or something and they are afraid of you knowing this.|`|6e3e13dad52401635f135a72ce217f23aa	There must be family problem..probably it will just be you to find the way to know what you want to know. Beside yourself don't even a good relation with them even to your brother so how could you ask them all this.<br>  <br>  Why don't you arrange / make a good relationship to your family as for you to get what you realy want to know..if you will able to do that,it's not far that you will know what your looking for.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|DT4PHmukaa	I am sorry to hear your sad story. You can do a geneology study at your local library or on the net. Maybe some of this community can help you find free sites for geneology searches. Hopefully communication gets better with you and your family. Sometimes being a teenager is just an awkward age. I have friends that are like family to me so remember that it is okay to have friends that are like family.|`|Rj08Nzv9aa	When you need to talk to someone go up to your mother and tell her how you feel you can even talk to your father. If you do not feel comtortable with this, talk to friends|`|Dzmi2XXPaa	Uh, 48 - 40 is 18, not 15. We all know ur lying, also u said u r a girl but we all know your a guy!!!
28hc0D0laa	i know exactly what you are talking about..and im not going to lie it takes a while but eventually you be able to just go to sleep..i mean only on occasions do I cry myself to sleep...but just try listening to music or do productive things to get him off your mind like clean haha..but it actually works for me at least|`|XprbKE08aa	i have the same problem as you, me and my ex broke up a month ago but getting over her is the hardest thing ever, somedays its fine but all today i just felt depressed because i wasnt with her anymore........thoughts of her are always going through my head, you should just try to find closer and surround yourself with friends, mabey if your up to it you can become friends its hard to do and it takes time but at least they are still in your life|`|Gl20z152aa	If you don't want to date this guy (I assume that's your problem), try thinking about all his flaws and your mind will do the rest.|`|Msd9PiRGaa	Tylenol PMs.
C8DOT8Y7aa	I think you should.
O6TC4CgRaa	Same thing happened to me after i broke up with my guy<br>  I couldn't stop staring at his SN when he's online<br>  It's very tempting<br>  I think you should talk to him..<br>  Talk about random things<br>  Don't mention about the hard feelings yet<br>  If he sounds boring when talking to you, stop right away<br>  good luck|`|DTGZJ8T6aa	yes|`|fAbig2ZDaa	Yes, and ask him why he's been ignoring you. There might be something on his mind that you could fix.|`|tu1m1dkoaa	I agree with the first answer. (:
L49hkJzAaa	Im sorry to say it but your boyfriend is a classic alcoholic. Recessive drinking is not a good thing, and he will always deny it in some way. My advice is to let him know how you feel, tell him that you know he is better than that. when you see him next, let him know that you are more comfortable when he is not drinking. Tell him that you love him, and lead up to the topic somehow, if he starts to get agressive, back down a little, but dont give up. <br>  <br>  "NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE!!!!"|`|kGh0Cf5Raa	Sounds like he might be, my parents are and it is very hard to deal with. He needs to get help but it will only work if he wants it to. You need to sit down and talk to him and tell him how you feel about this in depth, make him understand. Also, sometimes the only way to make someone realize your serious is to take something away like an ultimatum. Good luck!
FWQt7eCEaa	depends on how he said no.   When he said no, was he saying it with a joke? like was he goofing around and being sarcastic?  Sometimes people act serious, but truely are kidding.   Is he known to have a sense of humor? like would he kid around like that?<br>  <br>  Or was he just plain out serious about it. <br>  <br>  Because if he was kidding about it, he was probably trying to make you laugh,|`|zQIwDFdPaa	I'm confused too.<br>  Try making your topic a little more understandable.|`|nRcSFAxlaa	neither of them like you.|`|gRXy66dOaa	no he doesnt like you
kD0zNJLqaa	well you could just makeout and take your clothes off|`|FnnyT1mlaa	"Man im horny."|`|KOjVWXOCaa	Just start complimenting him and rubbing on his inner thigh at the same time, then give him that look. For example, baby you look sexy today, you have beautiful eyes, I love your smile......while doing this you have to be looking at him with a sexy naught look and rubbing on his inner thigh. Trust me it will work and he will be ready to do something, lol.|`|VxySsVbwaa	grab his thigh.
FZKFLTyLaa	Make eye contact a lot and touch his arm gently with your hand while you are talking to him.<br>  He'll get the message.<br>  He will either accept or reject you from that point. Note his body language and other reactions.|`|GtEfBBwAaa	No, it's good that you don't take him for what others say he is, that you like him even though others don't. I think it's good that you see his personality in a good way, just don't hurt your friend when you talk to him.|`|K8JGxwGXaa	Get to know him better, maybe hes not so obnoxious after all.|`|1wDkKyLCaa	go for it,you don't have anything to lose
L1ip6ohVaa	I'd be impressed by everything but the working out or the marathons (I'm just not that athletic). <br>  <br>  However, there's a much easier way to impress girls.<br>  <br>  When I meet a guy, the first thing I look for is whether he asks me questions (and pays attention). If he does so, then chances are he's interested in me (and if he listens, he's probably interested in me as a person, too) (even if he's just interested in me as a friend). If he doesn't, then he's either narcissistic or too shy to carry on a conversation. I like a guy who's kind of shy, but he better be able to pull his weight in a conversation.<br>  <br>  So, instead of trying to run a marathon, I suggest you try asking her about herself.|`|Yz1pzloSaa	Volunteer at a charity!|`|SBPd5W5oaa	um none of those really matter to me.<br>  but um cooking i guess|`|e9431e7aacbf06accd4aa1aae5cc622baa	Learning 2 cook would impress me the most. I suck at cooking so if I have a guy that can cook then that's great! 2nd is working out. U don't have 2 necessarily have a 6pack and all that but it's healthy 2 keep fit.|`|h0g4txW5aa	Volunteering at a charity would really impress me cause I think that shows a lot about your character and what kind of person you are.<br>  But the learning an instrument and working out is good too.|`|WitqRbfaaa	probbaly volunteer at charity and well me personally i love guys who are romantic, NOT self obsorbed, and of course they have to be a little cute :)|`|JgKosPJpaa	the following would impress me:<br>  -work out/ develop some muscle or a six pack or something<br>  -be well read<br>  -learn an instrument<br>  -learn to cook|`|elwsjkFyaa	Hmm I would say learn to cook, or learn an instrument. I'm a sucker for guitar players. But keep in mind that being yourself is the best(:

They grow up a lot that year. Why not at your expense. By the way, you shouldn't be trying to impress them anyway. be yourself, else you will never live up to your first impression.|`|UUrqECXIaa	21 sounds like a good age for you.|`|nBjQQ3yraa	over 20|`|68a61b5dac67c3eb2655a1e0f6fdfc3baa	I say 20. <br>  thanks for asking. <br>  :)|`|DvwJmahvaa	i was 18 and my bf was 25, no biggie|`|oPqJZvmKaa	21 because then you can go out drinking together, and get frisky|`|3efxFdFWaa	wow lol, you do know an 18 y/o may be more mature than a 25 y/o? the mentality of adolescence is still the same well into your 20s...so plenty 24-26 y/os may as well be easier to impress!|`|yvugbHpRaa	I would say 20, also. I'm 18, and I would feel a little wierd with a 24 year old, I think.|`|JKQmEFcmaa	i'd say around 20 or 21 but not any younger. coz if you do go younger then her firends are gonna think that you are a creep.|`|ejvCttS6aa	The "GROSS METER". divide your age by 2 and add 7 to it and that's your age limit. 24/2 equals 12 plus 7 equals 19!

7Icg8uKraa	Jokes get old after a while... try making some good conversations instead.<br>  Also, gain some self-confidence and girls wont think that you are boring, shy or quiet. Just be forward, but don't force your luck. ;)<br>  ~~Good luck.|`|1Qha5gwVaa	You kiddin'? I laugh at every joke. I laugh even when nobody else laughs.|`|7YQQK1e7aa	most gurls don't like to much jokey stuff anyway u just need to go up to her and ask her out boi stop being so shy u never know unless u try u can't let this gurl pass u by life is too short for that hun. give it all u got with no jokes
GbzxnGcIaa	First of all,you don't really screw up at the first place since you never cheated on her so it would be easier to make clear of things since all you need to do is to provide her an honest answer.However,the problem you're having now is she still probably thinks you've cheated on her so you need a more gentle yet careful approach to talk to her.<br>  <br>  Well,I would advise you to text her for the first two days saying you want to talk to her and meet up with her.Then,try to call her on the phone and do the talk regarding this.However,if she doesn't want to pick up the phone,then you might as well try to meet her up straight away.Buy her something that she likes or you could just buy her flowers and approach her at her house when she's at home and then you'll do the talk.Let see where things flow from there then.Good luck!!<br>  <br>  P/s:Who knows,maybe she moved on about this so just try to ask whether she's still bothered about this.Try to hang out with her if you can.Hope I helped(:|`|8waXhvPuaa	Dude. you screwed up pretty bad. haha I don't even know how to answer that one.|`|ssiqDLKsaa	boyy yu dug a deep hole there isnt o muchh yu can do to fix it its gonna be hard|`|OLZYHo17aa	first of all, you're an idiot. second of all, find some way of proving you're not cheating, back off more, and be very ashamed. especially around her, if you happen to even see her again.|`|e9431e7aacbf06accd4aa1aae5cc622baa	Well you should feel guilty! That is terrible what u said 2 her. Good luck with this because it won't be easy.
NSx8YmP6aa	I'm sort of in your position too. My mom's mom had 2 brain surgeries and a stoke so she is paralyzed. She can't do anything such as talk or walk so it's hard to understand what she feels. She lives at home with my family and my mom doesn't want her to be in a nursing home. My dad somewhat wants it for my mom's health(lack of sleep/ overworked/ overstressed). I promised her that me and my brother would help out to make things easier for her, but I'm worried that things won't change. I really care about my grandma so I don't want to send her to a nursing home and it would hurt me to see her die in a place that doesn't even know or care about her. <br>  <br>  <br>  *also your life shouldn't be over if she does pass away, she wouldn't want to cause you pain.|`|MlCWsBcwaa	Have you looked into homecare, respite care, and other options that would enable your mom to stay at home while giving you some time to have a life of your own too.  Your mom would probably want you to have that.  If your brother and sister won't physically pitch in, maybe they can help financially with this.  The odds are that your mom will die before you do, and you should be able to have a life, not just chuck it in.  Even if your sister and brother are too selfish and financially struggling to help, then maybe there are charity or government services available to help you even a bit.  Even if someone can stay with your mom for half a day a week, that would give you some time for yourself.  What about her friends, maybe some of them could help you too.  If you start doing this now, maybe you can be less dependent on your mom depending on you and it won't be so scary when you actually have time on your hands.  You deserve some happiness too, you have been a fantastic child to your mom too by the sounds of it, and maybe she would not have raised you to only live for her.  Good luck.|`|zrFzbDHUaa	God Bless You for what you are doing.  I had a similar situation and use to get angry that I didn't get help from my siblings. You are the one who will carry those fond memories of your mom.  You are the one who will feel proud that you didn't let her down and was there to take care of her. It is very hard to see a loved one go through the aging process.  Just be strong for her, pray throughout the day, it will give you comfort and will help you to get through each day.  Don't feel like you don't want to live when she is gone.  That will be your time to have a life of your own.  Your mom would feel bad if she knew you felt that way. Look up some web sites on, "how to cope" with this situation.  Hang in there, you are doing exactly what you are suppose to do, you should be proud of ypirself.|`|Rj08Nzv9aa	awwww reading your story makes me sad but happy idk what to tell you im very sorry
oi6eHkPzaa	Personally, i don't think calling a girl sexy is necessarily a sign of disrespect. I can see why people may interpret it this way though, it depends on how sincerely, or, conversely, lasciviously it is said. I mean, i'd tell my Mum she was pretty or tell her she looks beautiful, but never sexy! Ha! That would be wrong in so many ways...!!! Sorry, i digress. So it really depends on a) the person saying it, b) their reason for saying it and c) how you personally feel about these words. It's all perception. I can call some of my girfriends beautiful, but they know i'm just trying to make them feel nice and smile, and nothing more. I must admit though, you need to develop a good radar for when someone tells you something like this for selfish reasons. If i may say so, i think that it's admirable that you care. Lots of girls just want their ego boosted and don't really bother about the why and how of it. There is nothing nicer than a proper compliment. Like i hinted at before, it's in the delivery of the speaker and your perception of their intentions. Nobody can read minds though, so it's a ongoing process for us all.|`|cHBcR0Chaa	who knows. could mean that he respects the pretty/beautiful girl more or just likes them then the sexy as hell. b/c he knows he could never get with the sexy girl. he could just be trying to find another way to describe the sexy girl. not to say that the pretty/beautiful girl isn't sexy herself. don't read to much into this is what im trying to say.|`|00a4b3d2b7618df165d7bdb18408dbf0aa	being a guy i would say one is a long term commitment compliment and the other is strictly sexual.
SlR0Cp5saa	I was 14. I'm 15 now. Me and my friend were hanging out and when he was leaving, he lifted my chin and kissed me. It was amazing!
AA10199093	To answer your last question, you're kind of neurotic. Here goes for the rest:<br>  1. I was scared away from many crazy girls after I "got them" because they weren't what I expected or they were a little strange in bed<br>  2. I became more attached to some girls after I "got them" because they were more than I hoped for<br>  3. I married one girl I "got" because she was all I ever hoped for.|`|ad6ba0be886f1fadf328bb308984c296aa	If your not sure - then you shouldn't sleep with him.  Wait until you know he's genuin and knows he likes you for you and not after just one thing.  A lot of guys get it and then dump them after the night, or dump them after getting some freebies for a few weeks or months.  It's sad, women really need to respect themselves and make sure men don't treat them like pieces of meat.|`|4712f79c3b66a688114af1fc7e707671aa	From what I've seen, most guys are immature enough to lose interest after a few weeks of dating a girl. Until they get in their mid-twenties, they seem to be that way (girls do it to though, I know I do. XD) But honestly, if he's being honest at all, then he'll stick with you for a good while.|`|axylPYftaa	depends on the guy and the girl|`|X5W3leICaa	will a girl lose interest after getting you?|`|kyTBaYFlaa	there is only one way to find out, sometimes you have to take a chance, he may also lose interest if you keep putting him off. if he thinks you aren't interested in him it could be a big turn off.
6Tj70Xv5aa	My personal opinion:<br>  <br>  Girly girl, I prefer hair slightly longer than shoulder length, as for how she dresses, I look to see if she dresses like her friends or like other girls. I prefer girls with unique taste. It lets me know that they don't follow foolish 'fads'.|`|AA11455807	What do I like in a girl?  Umm, I don't think yahoo would allow me to answer that . . . .<br>  <br>  Do I like girly girl or athletic girl?  I'd pick girly girl in a dress with longer hair.
hSOEgpPNaa	Honest, caring, athletic, faithful|`|EsnFmcMFaa	athletic is good but not too athletic<br>  stylish is also good but i wouldnt want a girl that is all about gucci and always buying clothes every week<br>  <br>  she also has to be<br>  funny<br>  smart<br>  mature<br>  independent|`|AA12393776	pretty, mature, healthy, clean, easy going, not high strung. avoid "high maintenance" women, also are they self-supporting? also warning signs go up if they make far more than the guy (most women have issues with that .. unfortunately)<br>  <br>  do they seem to like me. do I seem to like them.<br>  <br>  are they open minded, can carry on a conversation, not bigoted, not pretentious, avoid religious fundamentalism of all kinds.|`|XU9kfVmKaa	nice fun to hang out with some one that i could be my self and they wouldn't care smart and honest cant have had sex and i don't want her to drink or smoke i don't care what she looks like either|`|uRbeSOMwaa	cute, funny, sweet, caring|`|2xur6JMVaa	I like girls with a good taste of fashion, fun, sweet, and loyal|`|XprbKE08aa	personaly for me its all about the personality and how well i would actually get along with the person, looks help too but personality is a bigger factor|`|98620c4bb519e0b41dbf34ffa4fca389aa	too much booty in the pants. i like big butts and i can not lie.|`|EZcfQTDKaa	yea wat u sed and good in bed and funny
weqUqkZUaa	He's interested :) - If u like him don't blank his signals.
PEhWtWcmaa	just go as fast as you can if she says it hurts she is lying|`|PeJnA85Raa	Just go very slowly, and make sure she tells you if she feels any pain or discomfort. Pay attention to her reactions to what you are doing, and make sure she communicates with you.|`|VAUK7KYKaa	you can put a pinky in a bit, but other than that, it may bother her.. you can rub her instead itll probably feel better to her since she's a virgin.
AA10358331	Unless he wasn't masturbating on a regular basis then yes he would ejaculate fast. If he is on a regular basis then sex should be fine.|`|B462BQYzaa	he ejaculate a lot faster than before, if u never had sex with him before then he would ejaculate really fast and there should be a lot.  I can always tell whether my guy has whacked off recently or not heh.|`|kdGdSIFnaa	In my personal experience, (the second one) it depends on how horny i am. Of if im in the mood. Also, (and sorry to be so honest), how hot the girl is.<br>  <br>  And the first one. If you have experience yourself, then you could tell if he is good or "a little rusty"|`|FnnyT1mlaa	I think the only way you would know is if he's just got out of jail and even then you cant be too sure.|`|9d7d1d55abda1640800cba0ad27d86a4aa	The amount of his ejaculation.|`|qca43wgkaa	It would most probably be more enjoyable since he hasn't done it in a while
C8DOT8Y7aa	Send him love notes: tell him how important he is to you. This might involve subtle hints, compliments, or mentions of how glad you are that he's involved in your life. Ie; "Talking to you is always fun/I love it when we can just hang out and talk." <br>  Give him homemade cookies; or just anything homemade in general. It'll show that you were thoughtful enough to go out of your way for him. <br>  Hug him and provide support when he needs it. If he doesn't want to speak about the issue, don't push it-- just let him know that you care enough, and if he's willing to talk, you're willing to listen. <br>  Find a private place for you to talk with him. Propose the idea beforehand, see his reaction. <br>  Tell him you love him. <br>  You can tell him that he means a lot to you. It takes a lot to say "I love you" and that's a step closer and it can be shared in a good friendship. <br>  He wants you to talk to him when he needs you. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] TipsBe sure that you actually do love the guy before you tell him. Never say it unless you are absolutely sure. <br>  You'll really know if you love him if you care about how his day is going, even when he's really frustrated about something and you're there for him. There are different ways to tell or show a guy you love him without it seeming superficial, letting him know that he can be himself around you and you won't become freaked out if he's grumpy (it's not you...). A guy who cares will try to earn your respect and trust, he wouldn't expect you to say "I love you" right away but after getting to know him better. <br>  Never beg for his love. Love isn't like lending a pencil!

Eventually he will get the drift.<br>  KD|`|dyV5gDx3aa	it doesnt look like hes fat, but its hard to tell from that pic o_O.<br>  <br>  btw, just be more flirty with him and if he's shy, why not just ask him out yourself!?

n8b48Nvvaa	u need to b cute not like in looks but in personality, also flirt up a little bit. tell guys theyre strong or hot or somthing and if you blush is a lot of times a good quality. idk y though but most guys think shy girls are cute. lol
fIqwuGWTaa	i say you should just go talk to the kid you like.
CVVl4U4caa	Pretty much the second option. For instance: If you came to school after not doing ANYTHING(makeup, hair, etc) but you put a VERY low-top shirt on, without a bra. Not one guy(straight) would think you looked like a mess.(Wouldn't notice hair, makeup, etc)|`|48nfnYnoaa	I'm a guy, and I pay attention to a lot of details, even the small ones. A lot of my friends are girls, and I always notice stuff about them.|`|jlXPsVfdaa	I notice that kind of stuff.  I think how a woman takes care of her appearance says a lot about her personality.  If she is put together well, it usually means she is a perfectionist and cares a lot about her appearance.  Seeing I am a perfectionist, I care a lot about my appearance and the appearance of any woman I date.

JNAWH590aa	Technically a 18+ year old can date anyone under 18. Beware though, if the minors parents don't like the 18+ year old they COULD sue... and would probably win. Forget about anyone under 18, if your over 18. There is just too much risk involved (legal risk; even if the adult didn't do anything sexual the minors parents might lie...) Laws vary state to state (assuming you live in the US). Some states have a "leeway" meaning someone over 18 can have sex with someone under 18 if they're no more then *blank* years apart (it ranges from 0 to 10 years depending on the state). If the "leeway" is 3 years that means that someone thats 18 could have sex with a 16 year old. As said... Dont rely on this law.... Because it is all to easy to lie, find loopholes, and sue in court.|`|VAUK7KYKaa	that is correct.
AA11491265	She could have just been shy. I find it hard to make eye contact with people because I am.

AA12393776	This sort of thing is always hard.  I know, I've been there.<br>  <br>  See what happens if you still are talking by this summer.<br>  <br>  In my case, we met in Christmas, emailed and talked, saw each other in June. And we started making plans for her to move to where I lived.<br>  <br>  however . This proved two much, too difficult.  <br>  <br>  She was concerned about moving away from friends and family and then by September  an "ex" she loved stumbled back in her life (saw him at a gas station accidentally) did not want to be ex anymore , so I was dumped. much crying and teeth nashing by both, and soon afterwords she married him instead.|`|5687JygEaa	To some people it works, for me however it never worked. If you like him then just keep talking to him, but don't commit to anything because then you will feel limited.

I was in a relationship for 10mos. I also met him last summer and we live about 1000miles away from eachother. He broke it off because it was too hard not being able to see me. It absolutely shattered me because he was supposed 2 move here in 2months! <br>  I say don't give up! It's almost been a year and that's a long time to wait for someone. I'm saddened that my bf gave up on us but I never gave up and atleast i can be proud of that. Good Luck!|`|fO5wQiYzaa	Yes they are. They really suck. I moved to ATL and my kinda girl lives in California. We decided to just cool it since we dont see each other we talk everyday but our conversations get shorter. She also gets upset when I talk about when I'll see her or anything about the future. It's gonna suck. I suggest just trying to be normal and whatever happens, happens.|`|wdNl0BB6aa	they can be hard but if you both really want it then you can do it.
XruykwlXaa	This is a dilemma, but let me say you are lucky that this person told you about the herpes before putting you at risk for getting it yourself.  As for what to do?  Well, this is a new relationship and unless you feel you are going to marry this person (which I don't think you do at this point), then I would let it go.  If you are crazy about him, you and he could go to a doctor together and learn about herpes and how you could be protected if you decided to sleep together.|`|8SRjELNBaa	I dont want herpes... I'd leave.|`|wI3AAkIoaa	That would all depend on my feelings.  I thank god I was never in that position.  If I thought he was the one I could spend the rest of my life with I would give it a chance, but never have unprotected sex.  I fall in love fast and hard, I would have a hard time walking away.  I am on my fourth marriage so I know not to judge on mistakes... sometimes even with the best of caution unexpected things can happen.  Good luck.|`|otYGbapNaa	this truely depends on how old you are imean if its a serious relationship then id say get out of it cuz you dont want that! but if its just a little fling kinda thing and your not guna do anything with him that would give you herpes then stay with him.but that seriously sucks for him..<br>  lovelovelove<br>  Audrey!|`|qL3dGTXDaa	I would leave. The relationship is most likely short term anyway and is not the risk.|`|JgKosPJpaa	leave. there are plenty of other fish in the sea. healthy ones.|`|nYzcP5V9aa	If you really like them you should stay with them and just not do anything sexual with them unless you're willing to risk getting herpes.<br>  But if you don't really like him that much you should save the both of you the grief and just leave. But don't leave him JUST because he has herpes because him telling you is a big thing and it's probably hard for him to say.|`|9EAIMt0Baa	Well herpes is of no concern to you if you are planning on spending the rest of your life with this person. <br>  <br>  Now if you are thinking you may still want to date, that is a different story. This guy sounds like a great guy for telling you before you two had sex (or at least I'm assuming). But herpes is with you for life and sex will never be normal. It will always be a fear factor - not knowing when you'll contract the disease<br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|9dACSXOmaa	omg SIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!! what sort of dirty sluts was he involved with???? yuck, leave him...lol  i take it u've slept with him already..otherwise u wouldn't be so concerned. so ahh,  well if ur thinking of leaving him already, then maybe u should, herpe's reli sucks....but if u both have it already..then there's no point leaving him for it, as u got it now too<br>  <br>  n at least he told u about it....i suppose he's got some brownie points for that...but idk...coulda been a decent boy n stayed out the red light district hahahha...i'm on the fence on this one, but i'm gonna go with leave him, ur too young to mess with this stuff...u dont love the dude, have ur fun n move on ;)..he'll handle it fine|`|RFuWnx00aa	dont leave :(<br>  i mean yeah, it sucks, but its not his fault.. he didnt know.. i hope.<br>  just dont do anything that will transfer the disease onto you..<br>  use protection and get him to go get medicated or whatever..<br>  not sure cause never paid much attention in health class.. lol<br>  so i dont remember if its curable.. but i dont think you should leave him though.. if you really love him, no...<br>  good luck :(<br>  hope everything turns out okay|`|3HnVK3eeaa	depended on how you truely feel about them. If you feel that it is too risky to contract it and are afraid of getting it than I would leave. But if you can deal with it and use protection than stay.|`|e9431e7aacbf06accd4aa1aae5cc622baa	omg that would be TERRIBLE! That would be such a hard decision. The fact that they told u tho was a big step for them (if it's true).|`|nBjQQ3yraa	leave!  I seriously doubt it was recent.  At least they did tell you so that was a good thing|`|rmziCueQaa	I leave them. woman is to please man|`|QifCQ41gaa	Definitely stay.  Just because someone has a social disease does not mean that it should be the end of the relationship between two people.  A lot of people have health sexual relations with people who have diseases and just because it is a sexually transmitted disease does not mean the end of the relationship, it just means that you need to be a bit more protected and a bit more aware of your responsibilities if you decide to continue being sexually active with this person.  How would you react if you were in this person's place, would you want to be dumped just because you have a STD?  Think of this person's feelings before deciding what is best for you, and if you can not face the fact that this person has a disease and want out of the relationship, be mature enough to stand up and tell them the truth instead of dodging them or ditching them without the truth.  Some people walk away from relationships because they can not handle the fact someone has a disease and make up excuses, hopefully you are not this person.  Infact, it would be nice if you faced this person with your true feelings if it is eating at you so much.  I am glad to know that you have a partner who has actually stepped up and said they have a STD instead of continuing on without knowing.  This is the reason why that it has been continuously promoted to have safe sex.  It is not only to prevent unplanned pregnancies but to protect people from contacting STDs.  I hope this has opened your eyes to the issue of social diseases.|`|Ap4aUgiZaa	wow, that  i am very sorry that he has herpes. but they good thing is that he told you, which means he is an honest person.<br>  well if you truly like him a lot you should stay with him, BUT if you want to be sexual with him and dont mind getting herpes your self, then you should stay with him. im very sorry that he has that but if you truly dont mind getting herpes, and really love him you guys should stay together.|`|YGPTg5hqaa	whoa<br>  <br>  hes pretty honest<br>  <br>  i would stay beacuse he told u beacuse he wanted to make u trust him<br>  <br>  i wouldnt do anything that would get me herpes<br>  <br>  i know its painfull but deal with it<br>  <br>  if he was a bad guy..he wouldve had sex with u and get u the fuking herpes and leave u for the dead<br>  <br>  but he didnt ..rightt?<br>  <br>  so ya<br>  i wouldnt hurt his heart...<br>  u see..thats what girls do..when a guy tells u the truth ..just accept it and deal with it not leave him and stabb him in his heart <---which is what most girls do<br>  <br>  <br>  so ya<br>  i hope u keep this in mind or something<br>  <br>  its not my life ...its urs....im 14|`|081168f28573ebfa7f89cf91f00a1e36aa	That depends on you sweetie.

lBw50ySpaa	No offense intended, but what a stupid thing to do!  She is your supervisor?  And 13 years older than you?  Let's see, what part of your body were you thinking with?  When you think with that part of your body, you don't just get screwed that night.  You are REALLY screwed.  <br>  Sorry to be offensive, but I bet I'm not saying anything that you haven't already thought.  So now what?<br>  No one can answer that, but you.  You are going to have to put your real brain in gear now.  What kind of girl is your gf?  Will she understand?  Will she find out if you don't tell her?  If she does, then she for sure won't forgive it.  <br>  And what about coworker.  Cougar just had some tender cut of meat.  Do you think she is quietly going back to the aged beef?  You better hope you disappointed her!<br>  You can go back to being a good guy, no doubt about that.  But you might have to go there without your current gf.  Price you have to pay and all.  I would definitely not sleep with gf without telling her.  That isn't fair, because of the possibility of infecting her with HPV or Clamydia, 2 diseases that women can go years without knowing they have.  And remember, a 35 year old woman who seduced you has likely had many more partners.  She is way more likely to be infected than your young gf.  If you sleep with gf, and then she finds out about supervisor, you're on the hook for a double betrayal.  Because then you've been so self-centered that you put her health at risk to save your butt.<br>  OK.  I've thought it through, and you have to tell her.  Two wrongs don't make a right.  You can't risk her health.  You have to let her make an informed choice.  It is a matter of respect.  What you did was a "crime of passion".  Not telling her will be premeditated.<br>  Sorry to be so harsh.  Just talking to you like I would my own son.  Please take the high road.  Maybe you'll get lucky (no pun intended), and gf will respect you for your honesty.  <br>  I do wish you luck.|`|AA10907244	You should tell her. It will end up expliding in your face sooner or later if you don't. Moreover, I can't imagine how anyone would be able to keep that inside.<br>  <br>  Get rid of that lil' secret now. It will be tough though, mate. You shouldn't have been in that situation in the first place; you screwed up :(|`|TEE4sJscaa	Yes, you should tell you girlfriend about what happened with your supervisor.|`|angW1Lkfaa	You should have thought of that before.|`|lpuu8DIIaa	ur a dog|`|Asrxi2ZQaa	Doesn't sound so great when you go off and cheat.

Congrats!|`|w2kmLGWKaa	Just my opinion,but if you told your gf you had sex with your coworker,then she'll break up with you,but if you don't tell her and somewhere far in the future she finds out,she'll be mad,but i don't think she'll leave you.|`|7YQQK1e7aa	i think that u knew where it was going when she pulled out the wine i think that u should tell ue Girl u do owe her that it sounds like ya'll haven't been together that long so hey it is what is just be Honest good luck|`|vWMNXNLraa	YES U SHUD! dont wait ANY longer, and dont expect her to not be mad, if shes not then shes an angel<br>  but pls u need to tell her<br>  she deserves to know<br>  and if u two are meant to be<br>  then she'll everntually forgive u<br>  but if u wait any longer<br>  itll only hurt her more<br>  seriously|`|k0B8err5aa	You should tell her.

PyjqMVqqaa	You need to tell her how u feel, both of yall have to break the shyness sooner or later, why not now. If u can't speak with words on how u feel about her then write a letter, signed by u. Give it to her personally along with a single rose. Tell her how u feel before it gets to the point that it's too late.|`|Yz1pzloSaa	Maybe she just hates the awkward silence between you and her when you're right next to eachother all that time. Either she doesn't like you anymore, as a friend or as more than a friend, or maybe she really likes you and needs to loosen up and do some more talking than she usually does. You're probably tired of starting the conversations by now, but yeah, you could say things like "Do you have any homework tonight?" or anything you wanted really. Just saying something is probably better than saying nothing. To make her feel comfortable, you could say thing like "I just got off the phone with my brother. He says he accidentally broke my lamp, ugh!.... Do you have any siblings?"<br>  Asking questions is often a good way to get a conversation going.|`|ov8wo75maa	shes just shy. you need to get really comfortable with each other. be her best guy friend then take it from there|`|vyHrvt0Zaa	Do you notice that she's shy/quiet around other people and guys? If she is, she just might be really very shy and needs you to make more of an effort than her to start a conversation. Maybe she walked away because she feels awkward and unsure of herself so instead of being nervous with you she decided to walk away. It's really hard to tell when a shy girl likes a guy because they're not open about it. I say keep trying to talk to her and if things go well and you two have those friendly conversations, maybe ask for her number or something. But take it slow, most shy girls don't like to feel rushed. Good luck!
ikEc3yK2aa	dont ask her out just yet. girls need time. and when they know that you like them, they run. you need to take your time. and dont go after her. dont pay too much attention to her. it'll make her crazy, and most likely, it'll get her to like you more than she already mite..good luck...and remember to be confident.|`|Pvmsagqvaa	she probably likes u but is not sure of it. dont as her yet. just be friendly to her, keep being nice and ask her 2 "hang out with u" later. hope this helped =)|`|oUGiIhegaa	simple answer no<br>  <br>  <br>  long answer, i dont want to talk about it :(|`|zNR9Ik3Daa	dont ask her out yet.<br>  dont ask her to hang out yet.<br>  you will scare her.<br>  she needs some time to proccess things.<br>  and she walked ahead of you because girls dont like awkward confrontation. just be patient and wait for an answer.

You don't want to lead someone on like a puppy taken out for a walk. You could end up in a very awkward or uncomfortable situation--see the Warnings below. <br>  Be yourself. Everyone probably says this, but it's true! No guy wants a girl to pretend she is something she's not. As a general rule, guys don't expect girls to change. Resist the temptation to put on a show or to do anything that just isn't you just to get his attention. <br>  Get a new look. Don't change who you are (you never want to do that because you'll actually end up changing yourself) just try something different; if he doesn't like you for who you are let him be. Try a new hairstyle, new clothes, etc. It's a good idea to change things up once in a while, just because variety's the spice of life, and it might help you catch his eye. Try being that girl who is different from all the other okay looking girls giving him the eyes, because beauty is common, but a good outlook and a great energy are very rare. <br>  Smile and make eye contact. Whether closed-mouth or open-mouth, do it. Unless it really makes you feel artificial, learn how to shoot people a reassuring smile, letting them know that you're a happy and confident person who wants to enjoy life. The idea is to communicate that you're inviting their company. <br>  Flirt. Do it as little or as much as you want, but remember that too much flirting (especially with other guys) will likely get him to take notice, but perhaps not in a good way. If he reacts and you don't think its real (he's just doing it because you're there and you're a girl and he thinks he can do better, let him know he can't). If he is faking it, call his bluff and say something that makes him know you don't think he is 'all that'. For example, if he comes close, pull a face and offer him gum. This will unbalance his ego. <br>  Start up conversations that have to do with if it's where you are or if he's talking to you. Make sure you don't go on about nothing. Definitely make sense when you talk to him. Don't twirl your hair, flick your eyelashes or GIGGLE nonstop. He can get kind of scared and make fun of you, no matter how old you are, guys will always be the same. Be yourself! Just be who you are, thats the # 1 quality guys look for in a girl. <br>  Hang out with him often; you don't always want to be hanging around because you might look like an annoying bug that's always around and never goes away. Try to start a conversation about an interesting topic, for example if your at a football game ask confidently, but cutely "did i miss any action?". This will tell him that you want to know about the game, but also you want to get his opinion so he will automatically talk to you about the game (or other topics) the whole game. Start slowly like a movie or party try not to make it so noticeable cause he might not be interested. <br>   <br>  *Whisper Whisper*Talk to him. Try to get to know him a little by discussing things you have in common. A good way to start a conversation is to ask him a question. Listen to him and don't interrupt him when he is talking. You could even compliment him or ask for help. A good opener is spray two different perfumes on each wrist, then go up to him and ask him his favorite. This should get him to talk to you. Also be friendly to his friends to help him feel more comfortable around you. Some guys don't notice girls unless they talk to the guy. <br>  Be assertive. You are the girl. You have the power. A lot of guys are shy and awkward around girls they like, so don't hold back. Do what you want to do. Boys like a powerful girl. Be decisive. Tell him what you want him to do, etc.--just don't get too bossy! <br>  Make him feel special. There's got to be a reason that you want him to notice you, and that's because you noticed him first. Let him know--subtly--that you're interested in who he is, and that you sincerely want to get to know him better. <br>  Be brave. Stand up for who you are, and what you believe in. Ultimately, this will catch the attention and respect of someone who is going to work well for you, even if it turns out not to be this guy. <br>  Don't be a slob! It's a real turn-off for a guy when he notices a girl hasn't brushed her hair or wears the same outfit every other day. Even if you don't fall within the typical expectations, just looking presentable is always desirable--irrespective of who is the guy or girl. <br>  Just Talk To Him. When it comes down to it, talking to a guy, and flirting with him will get his attention, and if it doesn't then nothing will. <br>  Walk in front of him. It may be very simple, but it works. When coming out of the class, or playing in gym class, just walk in front of him, and he should be able to notice you. If he walks in front of you a lot, he probably likes you.
SdlEr5zqaa	I think you need to watch that new movie He's Just Not That Into You.

Tell her how your feeling and see where it goes, at least then she will no how your feeling and you have nothing to lose by asking her about it, but if your not upfront about it you might not get beyond flirting.|`|NIYYN6tpaa	If you go past two days without getting intimate then ya it's a rap as we say here in Hollywood|`|NJMGZ6TRaa	i think she likes you too but she's just afraid to get to imitate with you again.|`|zZPEoSngaa	Diva: Eww U had it with her? Not cool Bro! lol|`|B6EpHU1Waa	I had a similar situation. Around September I started hanging out wit a girl I had been friends with since we were little kids. I thought we were "just friends" for life, but one day we kissed and ended up going out. <br>  We waited a couple months before having sex and things are going great! we've been going out for almost 8 months without any problems at all. <br>  <br>  My point is, tell her you want a romantic relationship. But hold off on the sex for a while.|`|Gl20z152aa	If she calls you 2-3 times a day, that means there's still something there.  If you really want to be more than just friends, why not just tell it flat out to her face and see what happens?|`|4Xzoq1QTaa	dude. i kno tht u were intimate with her... but some times d fear of a girl nd lack of trust tht "will he b with me" bothers her... tht's y she needs time 2 thnk abt thngs.... so give her time coz the more u try 2 push it d more she goes far 4rm u....|`|7ff93384150a84022f12b48eda390e79aa	You get pass the pants and into the underwear!

If you tell him and he keeps doing it then there might be other issues but I would give him the chance.|`|ZyfilGjFaa	yes u should because my bf did that to me... so i know what ur going through.... but u need to tell him or he will keep doing it
La1tFv8Vaa	He might.<br>  I wouldnt say he is though, from the information you've given, it sounds like he does, but i may be wrong.<br>  ha, you spelt does wrong, but anyway back on topic, you might want to go around to his friends asking if he likes you.<br>  or you can do what i do which is if you like them, and you think they like you back, tell them straight up that you like them, which may lead to a good or bad answer, but its better then spending days trying to find out.|`|EAlIwQxCaa	Well I think that he has interests in you since he has changed torwards you. I think you should progress into it patiently give it alil time don't rush into it. When the time is right you will know if he likes you, but i can garuntee that he is interested because you dont walk every girl home there has to be something special or something that attracts him to you so buddy take it slowly and just go with the flow and be yourself ok and youll find out for sure.|`|AA10261253	obviously he likes you, but you are wondering if he likes you more than just a friend, huh?   Well, just be patient and you will find out.  If he calls you, or hangs around near you, or looks at you a lot, then chances are he is interested in you (as a boyfriend/girlfriend).  Sometimes we just get in too big of a hurry to rush these things, when actually the most fun part is the wondering and getting the courage up to express our feelings, and of course, THE CHASE.   Wait it out to see if he will approach you with his feelings.  If he doesn't, then maybe you should tell him that you would like to hang out with him some time (or ask your parents if you can invite him over for dinner).   Take it slow, though.|`|vHhap9yoaa	just keep being on FRIENDS LEVEL for now. dont get discouraged, try to see how he really is. its all going to be worth it in the end...good luck<br>  -prec|`|lxrKf7bRaa	i think your friend was just being nice. has he done anything else out of the ordinary?|`|bsoba9Vfaa	YEAH HE LIKES YOU AND HE PROBABLY WANTS TO HAVE SEX WITH YOU???|`|yFvdXRPBaa	Its a strong possibility, since most guys rarely go out of there way to do something really nice like that.

JhvqUvlsaa	Get rid of your myspace. It's really not all that important. But since you don't know who it is who is saying this about you it's probably just better to just get rid of it. <br>  <br>  Facebook is much better and this kind of garbage doesn't happen that I've seen on Facebook. =)
QVj2JwWKaa	lol...it is normalish. Especially if he came sooner than expected and he shoots it on your tummy or something like that.<br>  <br>  I think its perfectly fine, as long as you don't feel disrespected and he knows that he better not get it on your face or hair, then its cool.<br>  <br>  I told my boyfriend he could do this on certain parts of me and he wasn't so sure at first about it, he said he never did it before, but then while in the throes of passion and it happened, I think he got turned on by it.|`|abTZX46faa	your boyfriend is a twat if that's a fantasy of his.|`|DvwJmahvaa	its pretty normal|`|BS2WwF7Raa	thats discusting. <br>  i would never do that.|`|vPjbSBhJaa	It can be a fun treat for special rowdy occasions.

I would take the nice nerd over the hot mess anyday.|`|XT8eNPhVaa	Like the other guy said<br>  <br>  Looks reel you in and the personality keeps you around...<br>  <br>  I rather be with an okay looking girl who has a cool personality then a totally hot girl whose shallow|`|JNAWH590aa	Guy: Personality; but i will talk (hit up so to speak) on a girl because of her looks|`|prW1i0vzaa	Uhm, both!|`|BWM7NIA0aa	I've known many ladies in my time and have come to the conclusion that looks are secondary to a good personality.  The outer appearance is nice to behold yet the inside can be like a rotten apple.  We all age and our appearances change over time.  The constant is moreover what is on the inside of a person.  Looks don't last but real beauty lies within the soul of someone who is kind and caring.  Trophies go on shelves not pretty ladies.  Time marches on and halts for no one.  Choose carefully!|`|HSADGmMMaa	If its just casual dating or oogling at people: looks.<br>  <br>  If for a long lasting serious relationship: personality. Eventually everyone will look bad, when they are older.|`|jhardGeAaa	both but mostly personality..because a person isn't gonna look the same their entire life, but personality is not changeable|`|9zNo0Ka0aa	well personality, but you can't just let your appearence go.|`|AA12345296	everyone's going to say personality. because they don't want to sound shallow|`|uUjQBKQaaa	Personality all the way as long as theyre clean!|`|df7WXRl5aa	First, I would crush on the looks. But after that I look for the personality.|`|WtElgJDtaa	BOTH!  xD|`|dZGL4NU8aa	Lol... both would be nice. But if not, personality is the real deal. Look is only a first impression thing. Personality is what that last for a long time. Beside, I don't like a guy right off the first time I meet him (it takes a while for the feelings to grow for me) so really the look thing is only a plus. <br>  <br>  Also, hopefully his looks is at least presentable - doesn't have to be good-looking and I don't mind ugly... Just not dirty, raggy, messy, with ketchup all over his body, and tooth paste on his hair, and his teeth still have some left-over chicken meat, and his shirt is ripped so that his belly is showing and his shoes is torn and socks ripped so you can see the dirty rotten broken toenails of his, and he didn't wipe after using the restroom so he has the smell of pee and poop...  If his appearance isn't like that then I'll survive. :)  <br>  <br>  And I pick guys... I don't have any interest in girls...well, at least not in that way...|`|2tdokuWvaa	Well, I would say you need both. The person needs to have a good personality so that they wont be a complete mess and they need to be atleast attractive because you wouldn't date someone you find unappealing right? Although personality is far more important than looks, most people prefer both qualities.|`|081168f28573ebfa7f89cf91f00a1e36aa	I would say personality! But, then again a person does have to be lookable also....but definitely personality because looks can leave a person.|`|a1iam8Zvaa	im gonna be 100% honest<br>  <br>  looks
C8DOT8Y7aa	Be in the right place. It's best to ask someone out in person, so you've got to make sure to be where the guy you have a crush on is. This could be at the mall, the movies, or maybe at the baseball field if he's an athlete. You don't want to look like a stalker, but you do want to be able to talk to him. <br>  Take the initiative. Unfortunately, many guys are too afraid to walk up to someone they're interested in and ask them out. Take matters into your own hands. Walk up to him slowly but don't creep him out, and introduce yourself. Try not to do this if he's extremely busy, but at the same time, don't let the opportunity to talk to him pass you by just because you're nervous. If he seems receptive when you introduce yourself, keep on talking to him. <br>  Make small talk with him. Break the ice by commenting on something he's wearing or saying something about the place or event you're at. Just try to get him to feel comfortable around you. <br>  Make eye contact with him. While the two of you are talking, make eye contact and try to hold it for just a little longer than you normally would--just a second or two, not too long. If he makes eye contact back, he's probably interested in you. <br>  Commence flirting. This can mean touching him lightly on the arm, for example, or laughing at his jokes. Just be playful and communicate that you're interested. Sometimes you can flirt from afar and entice him to come over to you. Compliment him! For example you could say something like, "I love your cologne." <br>  Ask him non-intrusive questions about himself, such as what kinds of things he likes to do, what his favorite kind of food is, or if he likes to play sports. By asking harmless little questions you can find out more about him to determine if you really want to ask him out, and you might find out whether or not he's single. You can also set the conversation up to ask him out. <br>  Ask him out. Once you find something you both have in common, ask if he'd like to do it together sometime. Do NOT just rush up to him and say the words or ask a friend to ask him out for you! Guys hate that. It is embarrassing. If you don't succeed in finding something you have in common, you might not really find him that interesting, but if you want to take a chance, just let him know that you'd like to hang out with him again.<br>  <br>  <br>  If he says no, at least he knows you are interested and may get to want to know you more, or if he seems like he needs more time, don't get too upset; work on your friendship, getting closer and building up trust. Chances are he'll change his mind. Just be patient and wait to see what happens. Just say, "Oh, that's okay, maybe another time." Don't be rude and don't hold a grudge. There is no faster way to turn off a guy than to hold a grudge against him for not being as "into" you as you are into them. <br>  If he says yes, plan where and when you will go out, and don't forget to have fun. Since you asked, you should pay for the date, unless he insists. If he wants to pay for the date, then hey - no arguments there, right? Let him pay for the date if he insists--it makes him look like a gentleman and may also indicate that he is serious about pursuing you, which is what you were hoping for in the first place! On a first date, it is recommended that you go to the movies or somewhere with a lot of people, that way, there won't be any awkward silences.
IyEJfHGSaa	Gal...<br>  i use to have a bf who is jobless..and evertime he gets a job..there's always something wrong with the job...We will always end up quarreling.. With his low education..he have to learn to accept the job..<br>  As days pass by.. Im getting sick of advicing him to get a job and everytime we go out.. i have to pay for it..even for his bus fares..<br>  Finally i gave up n left him..<br>  Financial problems will always lead to break ups or divorce..<br>  Even if u love him soo much.. <br>  With his attitude ur relationship can be a ruin..|`|5687JygEaa	You should back off, what I mean with that is that if he's going to treat you like that, then you should show him with your actions that you don't appreciate it. I'm not saying you should start an argument or get into a huge fight. Just simply back off, go do what you need to do, and if he takes anything out on you, then walk away. You really don't have to go through that at all. If he then asks why you walked away, then explain to him that you don't like his attitude and if he's not going to appreciate your help, then your just going to walk away till he learns how to control his anger. I know you love him, but sometimes its not bad to give some tough love (just make sure to do it in a nice polite way).<br>  <br>  <br>  answer mine plz: <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AhJM6cPUQOFN6FI0BiyBBa_sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090307085443AAg8qJv">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>
IvMPh09baa	signs of an abuse... controlling, blaming, threatening...<br>  <br>  my dear, you are in an abusive relationship.  this man is trying to cut you off from the world, he is trying to control everything that you do and he's playing mind games to think that you are the cause of it all.  this is scary that you don't see it already... for godsake and your sons sake, get out of the house and into a stable home... do you have family you can go to?  i am sure, even if no room, someone will take you in... you cannot have your child seeing this behavior, its unhealthy and its scary!|`|B359bLqsaa	this sounds like a mess.  you need to take your child and go to the nearest abused woman shelter and allow someone to help you get control of your life.  they will help you with medical care and even help you with job skills and living on your own.  there is no need to stay trapped in a home where your son will learn how to abuse women too.  your husband is not good.  im sorry but he is not.|`|D3hYbsVJaa	He needs to get in some serious counseling, or at least around some men who can mentor him into snapping out of this.|`|13d4bd226d0dce7fe19e7693dc8cfed9aa	why did u marry him?|`|PD1fZV7Aaa	Your husband is suffering from FEAR from his past. Yeap he has baggage. But didn't your VOWS say for better or worse till death do ye part???? Or were you not listening to that VOWS?<br>   <br>  You are considering cheating on your husband you've said it more than once in this write up. So apparently his fear of you doing this is RIGHT. He already had a wife do this to him, he's worried and can see the signs he saw with her Im sure. <br>  <br>  He needs counseling and you both need couples counseling. He needs to work through his past. He LOST his brother in a car accident and so he doesn't want you going anywhere in the car. He's a afraid. (He must really love you) He's old wife cheated on him and your thinking of repeating that act He is Afraid (HE LOVES YOU) He had many friends come and go - Your thinking of leaving him, He is Afraid (He LOVES YOU).  Yes it may be hard to live with him but under his pain this man REALLY LOVES YOU. Maybe you should try to get some help and work through his pain and fear. He will see you are serious about your marriage. Show him the LOVE you've had for him. Flirt with him Reasure him that YOU LOVE HIM, SPOIL HIM and treat him like when you where dating. I BEAT HIS ATTITUDE WILL CHANGE. Also get counseling YOU BOTH NEED IT.  <br>  <br>  PS Your SON deserves a mom and a dad that has at least tried.  FOR BETTER OR WORSE TILL DEATH DO WE PART. At least TRY TO GET HELP AND WORK THIS OUT quite trying to FIND a WAY OUT and put forth that effort in trying to get help for your husband and you.|`|wBffQgPiaa	Call 1 800 799 SAFE<br>  <br>  Visit this site:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.lydiashouse.org/abuseshelter/emergency2.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.lydiashouse.org/abuseshelter/...</a><br>  <br>  Do NOT tell your husband that you are thinking about leaving or he will likely get more violent with you.  You have already tried to talk to him and given him a chance, and you can see what his response is.  A controlling man can and will hurt or even kill you and your kids.<br>  <br>  Whatever your husbands problems are are HIS problems.  You need to take responsibility for yourself and your son.

I don't know whether 800 shows up on your phone bill.  <br>  <br>  Make plans to get out now, while you and your son still can.|`|GtcBKnhHaa	He prob likes you alot so he doesnt want to loose you !! <br>  Maybe he i9s closed minded ! <br>  You have to win his heart !!+|`|VIKXnXuTaa	As to why, I think you answered it in your last paragraph.  He knows there are "issues" and probably undealt with.  Why are people so shy about using therapists?  Does his employer pay for one?  How about a church pastor for help.  He needs to resolve the anger issues.<br>   <br>  When you said, he "yells at me, throws a fit and grabs me really hard. No punching slapping, or kicking. just grabs me really hard or somethings throws me on the bed and yells.", that is abuse.<br>  <br>  When you say no matter what you do or say he always forgives you that is called "co-dependence". <br>  <br>  Running away from him and the baby is one thing, but wouldn't you rather he get helped?  I think you also need help and support.  You need to protect yourself and the baby.<br>  <br>  Put the facts before him that something needs to change for all of you.  Then set a boundary to find him some anger management, counselling, etc. so that he can be happy too.  If he won't go, the you'd better start putting some money aside to plan your get-away.|`|zAfKvhW4aa	Seems like he does not want to lose you. Despite of all what you said about his behavior, YOU have given him a reason to mistrust you, as you mentioned you almost cheated a couple of times in the past. YOU brought that on to yourself.<br>  <br>  Try to take his past troubles into consideration, be more understanding about where he is coming from.<br>  <br>  Be patient, try talking to him about your family visiting you or you visiting your family.<br>  <br>  Sit down with him when he is in a good mood and tell him how he is making you feel. Explain how he can change to make you love and feel comfortable with him more. Thank him when he trys to and when he succeeds.<br>  <br>  If that does not work seek marriage counseling or try to get help from your local spiritual leader.
4SbAx9PHaa	i think he was avoiding awkwardness by asking how you were doing <br>  also he probably was trying to be nice to make sure you would give it back.|`|sxnt92moaa	Lmao, he probally jus wants his shiiiiit back. lol that's why he was probally talkinq to you. So he probally thought "If i talk to her she's for sure qivinq my stuff back."|`|Kdr9CRbqaa	um maybe b/c u were friends at a time.|`|Vv7a31pmaa	he just wants his object back.<br>  <br>  give it back to him and let him go away.
kQbjCKNHaa	Wow, seriously.<br>  Just talk to him.<br>  <br>  Here's a good way to start, "Hi, whatsup?"<br>  <br>  Or you could try the QCC;<br>  Which is great if you havn't talked to him much before.<br>  <br>  QUESTION<br>  COMMENT<br>  COMPLIMENT<br>  <br>  ex.<br>  "Did we have homework last night?"<br>  "When is that spanish test, again?"<br>  "Can I borrow a pencil?"<br>  <br>  "Thanks, you rock"<br>  "She gives way to much homework"<br>  "Wow, i'm definitley failing"<br>  <br>  Then follow it up with a compliment.<br>  "Nice haircut, by the way"<br>  "I love your shirt"|`|BWM7NIA0aa	Find some common ground that you two can connect on.  If he's into sports, ask him if he saw the game last night.  If he's into video games, tell him you need some pointers on playing better. The more you can find in common with him, the better. Start slow and say "Hi Joe" when you see him in school.  He may not answer if his name isn't Joe but, you get the idea.  Baby steps to let him know you are there. Good Luck.|`|cHBcR0Chaa	don't worry, its easy. first off make sure you have confidence in what your doing. if you don't, guys see that and your screwed. so yea, if you ask him ANYTHING, it will break the ice. find out what he's doing after school, over the weekend, whatever it doesnt matter. if he responds well keep the conversation going. you want him to respond to the questions you ask and make him ask you some in return. once you have that going, your locked in. should be a lot easier to talk to him after the initial conversation.
WYWx9j8Maa	its his way of flirting.<br>  <br>  he thinks your cute.<br>  and since he knows you like him, he's using his charm to his advantage in hopes of it making him 'irresistable'<br>  <br>  which really, it annoys you.<br>  so next time he pats you...squeeze his cheeks and sarcastically be like "yeah, you're a little cutie too!'|`|Kwywmcs8aa	I don't know he might be in to bestiality.  that does sound weird
1oKardRKaa	its always the thought that counts get her something that she really needs something that she can use and that is necessary. get her the ipod is good but just dont write happy birthday i think its too tacky write her name on it or both of you guys together. getting a person such n expensive gift is something to think about especially if its just your GIRLFRIEND.  get her something that she would like, like a gift card from her favorite store, her fave perfume, something her her car if she drives, money for her to get all pretty at the beauty salon for later on you to take her out on dinner or something. or you can get her like a cute pair of earrings or so. or a picture of you two together in a nice frame or so. something that she really needs or that she feels is worth you trying to get her. well hope this helps!!!|`|PEhWtWcmaa	Condoms!! Flavored ones!!!|`|wdNl0BB6aa	get her the ipod touch! she will love it.<br>  i have one and its my favorite thing.<br>  <br>  laptop maybe<br>  clothes<br>  money <br>  <br>  something special..you dont always have to buy things.
QcUkrLWraa	With the information you've provided, I would say she likes you. Just ask her if she's made up her mind about your date. Bring it back up, but be subtle. And don't seem too desperate. Just be like, "oh yeah, about that dinner/lunch/movie/whatever, have you made up your mind?" or "have you figured things out with your 'someone'?"|`|Ynqnuqz1aa	Well, from what I read, she is not ready yet, but you should give her some time. I think that she is just trying to be friendly and is trying to avoid an awkward conversation.|`|lgMZJQtwaa	heey<br>  i think at first she was trying to take the friendship one step at a time and like moving up towards the top and now it seems like she likes you so start making your move boy she wants you:)|`|FPHutwNtaa	Probably since she's giving you family details. She trusts you.|`|d1tyTq6Saa	i think she is<br>  try flirting and see|`|Y6thGwqJaa	Well it kind of sounds like she is a bit confused, probably just about life in general.  But it could of been the same thing with her, maybe she was into someone that was giving her mixed signal like she's doing with you. So maybe that person she was into, isn't for her and she is now realizing it.  Even if that's not it.  I think you should just stick it out.  Just continue to talk to her, especially if you enjoy her company why not, even if it doesn't result into romance.|`|zB7Gz8R5aa	Actually I have had this exact same situation. For me it was a kind of crazy ex. The worst of it was she was still some what interested in him. She ended up not worrying about him freaking out and we went out for a while, she once almost dumped me for him.<br>  <br>  In the end things we couldn't stop got in the way, but we sometimes talk about the possibility of things working out in the long run.<br>  <br>  What I would say is she is very "into you" but this other guy she either cares about and is hoping to become free (which if that were the case you probably want no part in it) or she is worried what this other guy would do, in which case it is probably best to just wait it out any way.

3gUetu9Aaa	If you were a nice guy, and I though you were I would go for it. I mean it's not that serious like you said, and what is life if you don't take a chance. And then from the lunch on out you can get to know her better.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped.<br>  :]|`|pxVCuDoyaa	what i would do is talk to her a little first. Its good that you are making the first step. By talking to her and getting to know her first that could really prevent disaster later. First of all you prob dont know if she has a bf. Plus you dont want her to think ur some creep who shes never talked to who all of a sudden wants to go to lunch. You dont want to weird her out|`|OawunGmgaa	I would get to know her first.<br>  <br>      Girls can get really annoyed if you go to fast. try to just be her friend and maby invite her to like the movies or a public place with a group of friends. <br>  <br>         Just have fun and enjoy it. <br>        Ha and dont think about it to much just do it. ?|`|1oKardRKaa	depending on the type of attitdue a female has towards guy you would immediately tell whether a guy looks as if he is trying to hard. me personally i would notice that because if a guy came up to me ramdomly n i havnt sed a word to him before its like " oookaaayyy...where did you come out from?", this is the reaction that you will most like look at, and mention that i sed look at because girls wont really tell you.  try to hang around with her in class because thats usually where you will end up realting to her the most and when you fell that there is a connecting among both of you then you will eventually ask her out.  and like you mention, yes you really need to know her ust a little better especially her friends as well.  it all matters to the type of reaction your gona get.  asking her like that is jsut random and after her she will get thought on how wierd your are. you know things like that. my advice: think before you decide to run a move on her like asking her out like a normal outing becuz she culd take it as a joke that your messing around with her. even if it means to take her books to the next class. just let things move smoothly around you and her. feel a connection. well, hope this helps!!!!!|`|mXZ4825aaa	Don't be afraid and ask her. Have confidence in yourself and act like yourself. Make yourself more noticeable and make her know that you like her by looking at her in the eyes and having a connection with her. <br>  <br>  If she regrets you which i doubt forget her there are a lot of fishes in the sea.|`|0435c3993c3b05aec46c72cda7b5faa0aa	yeah. sounds great.
59166794a4eea9b1481a31a467c05f30aa	I think thats good... but its kinda random.. i still think u should take to her at least once.. get to class a little early or hang around a little later while shes getting ready to leave and talk with her while leaving the class... cuz at least if u have some sort of conversation first u dont have to be like "i know u dont know me" cuz that just sounds a little weird... it might work though so u shud try if u dont get to talk to her before.<br>  <br>  good luck!

Are you nuts?  No, that most definitely is NOT good!  You are being sexually harassed and apparently are too stupid to realize that.|`|hyRGNZh8aa	like 56" around damn thats kinda gross but i dont know how to help you its gona happen no matter what when your that big|`|oB1TH9Auaa	Unfortunately you are basically stuck with your physical build.  Believe me I know everyone stares BTDT.  I wore a D cup in the 8th grade.<br>  <br>  BUT  no one should be touching your breasts!!!  Except you and your doctor.  What those boys did is sexual harassment and assault!!  <br>  <br>  If it happens again, go directly to the office and tell someone - it is your body and that should not happen again!!!!|`|aMEmb992aa	Of course its good.  Truth is that most girls would secretly love 3 guys paying that much attention to their boobs.  I'm sure it would have gone even better probably at a more private place than school though, so that is something.|`|5x0VKnQEaa	HUH they squeezed your boobs?<br>  <br>  Or they made fun of you with it<br>  Cuz ur boobs are big? Or are u standing too straight,and ur boobs stand out|`|CYSUuFmVaa	you need a lipo suction, and sue the boys for squeezing your ****|`|5ZozqETbaa	dats terrible!|`|swVq0AQXaa	i would have kicked those three boys in the balls. that is very direspectful. u need to stand up for yourself|`|Yz1pzloSaa	Uhh<br>  No it's not good
oOU6XJOqaa	hopefully, i am not crushing your hopes here, but i highly doubt he likes you. I think he is lonely and thinks about his girlfriend all the time and needs someone he can open up too (that's your role). Then once he is around his gf, he is embarrassed that he talked to you, and he does not need you anymore. So he basically is using you as someone to talk to. <br>  If you really wanted to get at him, when he is around his girlfriend, ask him why is he so mean too you when he is around her and nice to you when she is not around (make sure you sound serious). She might think he is cheating on her and that would cause him to leave you alone and have no one to talk to. But that might be a little mean<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|hJLrcDCWaa	Yeah he definitely only thinks of you as more of a friend! If you want him to like you thought, I can tell you how! Always ask him how he's dong. ALWAYS! If he says Ok or bad, always ask him why. He wants someone to understand what he's going through. And act kind of mysterious. Guys like that.|`|0FWtWxMGaa	sounds like he hates you actually|`|dDa2BPaOaa	no your in the friend zone|`|lHWJljNPaa	From the things you've listed, no, he does not like you.|`|ztxkW7WKaa	No he hates u lol<br>  sounds like my bfs little sisters best friend. They used to date back in elementary which is ages ago since we r 18 and 17. so yea leave it alone
vq4DYBGgaa	toned legs...cleavage..basically skin considering most men are visual creatures|`|HhECyibGaa	At first a smile and eye contact.  After that. . . .I'm not telling.|`|XprbKE08aa	thats easy most guys have dirty minds, so one way my ex got me goin was txtin back and forth while jerkin it. or just talk dirty|`|jl66LEdEaa	good question!!!!I'm curious too ^-^|`|abTZX46faa	pmpkins|`|XeLmi1JSaa	I'm a 15 year old guy so a better question would be what turns me off
yTB2Zdx6aa	she decided to go out with YOU write? not him, that means she likes you more|`|wTyAJa5Iaa	I am being 100% serious you will have to step up and defend your honor. You HAVE TO fight this douche bag. Just **** him up and tell him to leave ya'll the **** alone.
D6htQcDbaa	Just tell him all of this instead of us on YahooAnswers...<br>  Explain that you went through a bad breakup and that it was hard for you. Tell him you need time to think things over and that you really think he's a great guy, but you don't feel that way about him.
8yGLf3Byaa	honestly man, you say your with a girl now right? why not keep things going you say shes amazing so KEEP HER! loose your EX tell her to stop talking to you and flirting with you, that's why you don't stay friends after a relationship =D|`|TEE4sJscaa	Please remember that you are hurting right now and that this is a serious issue that you are facing right now. You need to allow yourself to go through the seven stages of the grieving process (with or without the help of a mental health professional). This will allow you to leave the past behind without regrets.|`|AA10545938	Well what the problem is, is that you think you want your current GF, but really you want your ex. You are trying to force yourself into a relationship that really you don't want to be in. Especially if you are cheating on your current girl friend. There was a very similar type of relationship with my friend/ex. She was always going out with a different guy. But she was always cheating on them with me. We eventually decided that we were going to get together because she knew she was forcing herself relationships that she finally realized she didndidn'tt to be in. Me and this girl have now been in a long-term relationship throughout high-school. We started going out as freshmen and we are seniors and we are still together. So i suggest the ex.|`|mpgpImZyaa	Well who do you have stronger feelings for?<br>  If it's for you ex, you probably shouldn't be with your girlfriend.<br>  But if it's your gf then you really need to stop cheating.<br>  I was with my ex for a year or so and i cheated on him and surprisingly I didn't feel bad at all, that's when I knew for sure my feelings changed. So if you don't feel bad then you probably don't like your gf as much as you think you do.<br>  But if you really think you should stay with her and you really want to stop cheating create space between you and your ex. <br>  Tell her that you dont want to fool around anymore, and that you want to make things work with your gf.<br>  You need to make your intentions really clear to your ex, and try to keep communication at a minimum at least for a little while.
etV271ARaa	I guess he's not over you yet. If you have a healthy friendship with him and can talk about most things openly, why dont you ask him if he wants to get back together? if he does, give him another chance. You like him dont you. <br>  <br>  And dont worry about anyone else. If he likes you, and you him, you belong together|`|TDG32O3aaa	COOL|`|CeX9Rnjhaa	if you think you like him give him another shot...the other girl only likes him based on looks and that's shallow...you actually know him so go for it...dont let this slip by and regret it later
rEFHlhmdaa	aww sweetie it's cool i am 17 (a girl) and that happens to me too lol its doesn't help that i can be super shy when i don't know anyone, but what i find that helps me is when you kinda pretend you talking to a friend it helps the flow of the conversation feel more natural. then hopefully you won't feel so nervous e.<br>  <br>  please answer my question<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=ArdFQ4rahgIczJ2RmfRzcxTsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090302204818AAigK2F">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|6hZFR3phaa	you are just nervous it takes time and practice to get used to talking to girls you find attractive.... just take your time if you rush into talking you may say something stupid.
r7RE2yMdaa	We were dating for about 2 months when we fell crazy and madly in love with each other.  I was so happy, I couldn't stop smiling.  We spent every weekend together.  He called me every day at work to tell me he loved me.  Then after we were together for 6 months, he told me that he wanted to break up because even though he loved me, he also loved someone else.  I was very devastated.<br>  <br>  After 2 months, I finally started to feel better.  Then he called me and said he wanted me back.  I went to talk to him and found that he was very sick with cancer.  He died 6 weeks later.  It was a horrific nightmare.|`|5DvsxolRaa	i really really liked my best guy friend. and we were so close and talked about everything with each other. everyone told me he liked me and how OBVIOUS it was. then i kinda let it slip to one of his friends that i liked him, and then they obviously told him that. the guy i like comes back to me AND ON VALENTINES DAY tells me how much he likes my best girl friend and if i could hook them up. I liked him for 4 years. FML.<br>  <br>  feel better :D|`|Ti1xO4GDaa	Its not that bad but my worst was having a crush on a guy for about a year, then walking up when he had flowers thinking he was asking me to a dance but he asked another girl, so i walked away awkwardly. Yeahh it was bad :P good luck w/ your guy problems though!!|`|bc5LZrsAaa	My fiance dumped me on my birthday last year after 13 years together, we have 2 kids, and he left me for a woman he'd only known a week. Is that painful enough for you?
aG7hYafXaa	neither.<br>  definitely not the girl your best friend likes because that might mess up the friendship<br>  <br>  and if the other girl likes somebody else, MOVE ON<br>  things probably wont change|`|0435c3993c3b05aec46c72cda7b5faa0aa	tell the guys you like her. go for the homeschooled girl because the other girl is just using you as a rebound.|`|9dACSXOmaa	dude...bad call on the school girl!..hahahah owwww man, u shoulda been the one to give her the experience lol...bad times little man!<br>  and ahh....tbh, u just met this "girl next door" no?..well, chances are she's hot but not reli much compared to the sparks u got with ur ex..<br>  so y dont u get with the girl next door, get ur head around her...<br>  then go after ur ex again....n not this flirt flirt rubbish, take it to the next level...show her some fricken passion! i reckon she's the one u gotta choose...but if u want a taste of the other one...since u have no obligation to either one....then get with the girl next door...n leave her for ur mates if they want her that badly hahaha...then go after ur ex ;) she sounds like fair game<br>  <br>  cheers, hope that helped|`|271e6581641939afd4192f67ff3b66d8aa	Sounds like you need to keep looking.  If your best friend really likes girl #2, you better talk to him before you end up being a jerk.  Girl #1 sounds like she is more into herself and seeing how many guys she can get which might explain why she is more popular now.  Hmmm...|`|3gUetu9Aaa	You should go for the girl that you loved before. I mean you had something with her before and you know her already. You did love her you know? There must be something there, for the both of you, because if she didn't have strong feelings for you then she would just tell you to get lost instead of keeping you around.. Just follow your heart, and do what you think is right. If you think you might still love her then go for it. <br>  <br>  Hope I could help.<br>  :]
qOYI7Dgcaa	You are so smart it feels good to find someone like me even tho I'm a girl. I think a lot of people choose to loose their virginity before marriage or finding the right person because they can't harness the power of their hormones. Whatever you do, don't change your mind about this for any reason, no matter how hard it is. There is still some decency out there you just have to look a little harder!|`|GegQJNzSaa	why don't you look in places were you might find such girls,church functions?|`|SdlEr5zqaa	Perhaps you should start mingling with women your age in church groups. Religion is usually a strong reason why people wait, and even if that's not your belief, you may find someone who shares your morals. But I have a feeling that is the case.
XTSiJBv4aa	if you are living together, stop! if it is your house, kick him out, if it is his house then leave and take your bird with you. that is very wrong, and you need to leave asap!!! anyway.. why are you still dating after 45 years? that is odd in itself. you should call the cops on him, bestealisty is a crime!
1kJgH91Jaa	You're just thinking of someone that makes you content with yourself.<br>  <br>  That's a good thing - she makes you happy.<br>  it's all good son, just keep thinking about her.|`|uuJszgCsaa	U obviously like her.

Oz0h1TXwaa	I read this book where this girl<br>  fell in love with a nerd. It was<br>  a nice read. You should go out<br>  with her. Nerdy is cute.|`|GegQJNzSaa	My first husband was a nerd in high school,and a virgin. It started out pretty bad,but he ended up being the best lover I ever had. If I could have my second husband everything else and first hubbys talent Id still me married. To bad you can't marry 2 men!  lol
vPjbSBhJaa	If you have a boyfriend and intend to remain faithful, then you don't need to tell him because there won't be anything to tell. If you are going to fool around then be honest and let him know that you are just going to be FWB's from now on and he'll have to get used to the idea of you committing an infidelity now and then. Or . . . . if you really want to have fun, you can share with him, any female you become interested in.|`|a6p6zaYFaa	Are you kidding me? guys LOVE bisexual girls, didnt you know that? I'm sure that if you told him you were bisexual then he would completely understand. I know some girls that pretend to be bisexual just for the guys. You wont have any problems.|`|dNrrT1gkaa	Are you kidding me? He will be estatic! Tell him quick!|`|zfghD2dZaa	you should just say it, if he loves you he should understand|`|Kwywmcs8aa	Invite him to a threesome.|`|xoXkHOVsaa	Do you really need to tell him?  If you are both in a committed relationship, then it doesn't matter.  Unless you feel that you would rather be with a woman, there is no reason to bring it up.
450d7108dcc557d8dc4bb1c606d1bee1aa	The perfect relationship really doesn't exist.<br>  Everybody gets sick of each other & has to fight every now and then.|`|6b4RykC2aa	well it depends on how long you were dating for|`|DDTI0tiAaa	My perfect relationship is something where I can be me.  I want a guy who can be casual with me, as well as romantic. One who doesn't need me to constantly tell him how deeply I care for him.<br>  I want him to be my best friend too.|`|rGJznUUxaa	The perfect thing is just being together.
AA10250756	You are both too young for a permanent relationship. You both need to grow and date other people You may have feelings for him in a few years and go out when you are both in high school. Meanwhile, date other guys and stay friends.|`|WeWiUpPoaa	Um Well I'm Not Going To Read That, Can You Type It Again Different From This?!<br>  <br>  edit: well ok fine, i read it, but next time, don't capitalize every single word! well anyways, if you want to get over him, just try to keep you're mind off him, go hang out with friends, go to the movies, just try not to think about him or see him for a while. If you feel yourself thinking about him, push it away with a different thought. If you have his name written anywhere, cross it out. Wikihow I think has some tips, so you could go there and see.|`|0U25Ymqtaa	man u type werid y is ever letter caped? lol<br>  well u cant fight u feelings for sumone just give it time an they will go away by themselves

AA10250756	You are good looking, but apparently you freeze up when you approach attractive women. I suggest you get involved in activities either at school or with feeding the homeless and other activities girls get involved in. When you are working on something together, you can get to know them in a nonthreatening way and share jokes and experiences together and then go out for coffee after an event, and move on from there.|`|QAGaQUDRaa	You are very attractive as far as looks go. You just need to go into the situation acting confident.|`|rEFHlhmdaa	you are cute and i know it's hard to fake confidence but that is what you have to do some days especially when approaching cute girls ( i know that is what i have to do when approaching guys or just on a day to day basis) just don't over do it. it's funny i've gotten so good at faking that alot of people think i'm cocky or egocentric but i'm really just insecure lol.....soo yay<br>  <br>  please answer my question<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=ArdFQ4rahgIczJ2RmfRzcxTsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090302204818AAigK2F">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|OU8n1EPSaa	Aww, you're cute. =)<br>  But that's my opinion, and some will agree with me and some won't.<br>  <br>  No matter how ugly a dude is, I think any girl is lying if she says she isn't flattered when approached.<br>  <br>  Go out! Have fun! Flirt! Party!<br>  Don't worry about it!<br>  For every girl that shoots you down there's one who'd love your attention.|`|cLKkbPPoaa	No your not that bad looking.! Don't be afraid to approach girls because the most they can say is no!|`|kD0zNJLqaa	actually your pretty cute<br>  i'd date you<br>  i'll be 18 in a few weeks ;) ;)|`|F6znYVAwaa	i personally think ur an attractive guy<br>  and im sure if u asked a girl out that u liked<br>  she would say yes<br>  so dont worry <br>  ur good!<br>  lol
oCJJwM5uaa	Yes definitely! I lived in the Caribbean for over 17 years and the drinking age there is 18. Well actually on my island of Curacao they don't even ID you, people here start drinking when they're like 15. Of course i don't recommend that but I'm just saying. They never ID you at clubs, restaurants etc etc. when you order drinks. It was so weird for me when I moved to Florida because i was so used to not walking around with any ID. Why should the age be 21? why 21? 18 is a fine age, and we're pretty grown up at 18. 18 should be the legal age for everything and we barely have drunk driving accidents on our island at all and anyone can drink. so I don't know why all the fuss about being legal to drink until you're 21.|`|Kwywmcs8aa	No a lot of dumb people can't handle alcohol.|`|abTZX46faa	nah, american children can't handle their liquer.
PVCkpsLNaa	Why?<br>  did he say or do something to make you think this way,<br>  i really think that nothin went wrong u were only kissin,<br>  and not other stuff *cough*, lol<br>  but yeah i think ur in the clear, u guys like each other so i think you r gf material.|`|CajKowXcaa	erm its just your feeling unless he said something. just relax. you're paranoid|`|wybTIqXVaa	Wait... so what exactly is your question here? Are you girlfriend material or how do you become girlfriend material?
cd278de058e2b11ab5fc55c193be823faa	Just make her feel special, give her what she wants(within reason), keep her smiling, take her places every now and then, ask her opinion, hold her hand, etc. You know?|`|ZpR57jbBaa	give her some pepto bismol
HnEcgVGiaa	She screens his calls? I wouldn't be surprised if she ran a background check on him and required him to submit a resume and an application when they got together. She's being paranoid and is being over-protective. Is she that scared that she might lose him?<br>  <br>  You mention that he is different because of her. I am assuming that to you, this is a bad thing. But does he still love his girlfriend? Make sure that your feelings for this guy and jealousy is not a factor in your opinion on his girlfriend being a "psycho" and a control freak. From your words, it sounds like she is, but it's safe to be certain.<br>  <br>  If a phone call sounds challenging, try email or IMing in the meantime. Or, you can call from a payphone if you have to, so that she won't know where the number is coming from. If that girl is controlling that much of his life, he needs to snap out of it and realize what's going on. If she truly loves him, then she should trust him and have the decency to allow him to communicate with the other gender.<br>  <br>  But because he's not calling you like he did 2 years ago, it seems like he's changed. You might be able to salvage whatever friendship you had by contacting him before it gets too late. However, don't have too much hope in this. I know you said "I want him in my life", but realize that even the best people change over time. If it doesn't work out, be prepared to move forward with your life. There's a lot to look forward to.<br>  <br>  Best,<br>  <br>  Brian|`|qj2KzBDFaa	when u have him , you dont value him<br>  now you lost him, you kind of sad... is that right?<br>  if u want , just give him a call be and tell him, silence doesnt help|`|XH2o1MM6aa	.I think you should really move on and forget this guy.Your putting him on a pedestal only it's you who's looking down your nose at his friends.
RFeYz59maa	You know what....you sound exactly like me when I was in grade school. Even now that I'm in college, I'm still single. But I think your friend is right...you're choosing the wrong guys. The best thing that I can tell you is just to be patient and that guy will come along.|`|STJdWQdNaa	Just wait, he'll come soon when u r not even thinking 'bout it. Be patient but if u r not then just go look for one that is right for you. There r plenty of guys out there.|`|WrWcMPMcaa	lol nope. cuz that is exactly what is going on here. and actually im the ONLY single girl in my class. yes sad i know. but i finally got over it and just hung out with my friends! yes i want a bf but dont dwell on it hun. trust me its not worth it AT ALL.  but good luck! xoxo|`|WitqRbfaaa	i say ask the guy you like out i always do .. well not always but ya you should totally try it|`|eo0DKI0qaa	where do you live- I'll go out with you

Oh and More feminine as a bisexual male|`|3XLnDyupaa	I'm bi myself.<br>  But, wtf would I be doing with a guy?? Much rather be with a girl...<br>  Anywho,<br>  No, I wouldn't look at him any differently. That's just his sexual orientation, it doesn't make him any less of a man.|`|rUPVDszEaa	you shouldn't single bi-guys out, they still like woman. if you love your bf you wouldn't let that get in the way. letting something like that get in the way is so shallow.|`|SnWZusBIaa	Personally, I wouldn't date him.|`|5y5h5VYIaa	Bi guys are just the same as normal guys with a tendencey to go toward men to.

I'd date him|`|N4X8VSUvaa	I would say Bye.|`|cDqz71QKaa	no there just like everyone else and if a guy trusts u enough to tell a girl tell him  it doesnt bother you and be there for him because sometimes guys think girls don't like them and say there bi just to get a reaction or something from there child hood has alterted there safe house in a relationship with a girl.<br>  <br>  its nothing to be ashamed of but its also not something someone usually goes around shouting<br>  <br>  if he trusts you keep it a secret and defend him.  in the end he'll turn out to be a better friend and there for you more since he feels emotions of everything as long as you show you care.|`|gEd1jlOEaa	No I wouldn't not a good idea! STD's have you thought about that! I just think it's not safe! But there are so many men on the DL you can't tell who's bi or Straight|`|PeJnA85Raa	If I cared about him, it wouldn't make a difference to me.. he's still the same person whether he's bi or not.|`|7ohHC4DUaa	i find nothing wrong with bi guys but i wouldn't date them|`|hWUXnEpMaa	i would chop his head off
o1wIz3VVaa	Hi,<br>  he thinks you are jealous and it gets on his nerves... maybe you were not kind to the girl...<br>  personally, I do not blame you...

I'm having relationship problems too, because I was a jerk. You should try to ignore him back, then it will make him wonder, and then forget why he is mad at you, and he will be dieing to have you back. Trust me, I've had it happen to me, she did exactly that, and in 2 days I forgot my miss-judgment, and I was dieing to have her back.

Hopefully, he's one of the better ones.<br>  <br>  Get with the program and go back to class and forget about your silly dream.|`|YDNTOE9Gaa	First ask yourself WHY you had that particular dream about that particular person. Importantly, answer the question HONESTLY. You are obviously attracted to him so you really need to front up to your feelings and put them in perspective. Then you need to front up to class, apologise for cutting, and FACE YOUR FEAR!!!<br>  <br>  Does he really treat you differently? or is it that you see him in a new light?<br>  <br>  Hope this helps....<br>  Kia Kaha (Be Strong)|`|GdgHSFY4aa	hahahah... thats intsting... one time i had a dream that my french teacher (girl) and my dance teacher (also a girl) were making out in the halway at my school... and it seemed awkward in those classes for like a week.. but i still went to those classes... thats weird... why would you skip class because of that.. AAAAHHH.. what if it wasnt a dream!!!!???? aaaahhh.. thats nasty!... just go to class and ignore him!....wait... & what kind of differently do u mean?|`|DtGFWUP5aa	He treats you differently? That doesn't make sense. He doesn't even know about the dream! <br>  <br>  Just go to class. Everyone's had a crush on a teacher before. It's not a big deal.|`|9Vs22JmGaa	well, dreams always mean something [well most of the time]<br>  so just dont skip class, see if he acts really really different and dont stay after class if he asks you to alone..|`|9zNo0Ka0aa	......hahahahahahahahahaha!!!!|`|VSASkXQ7aa	Dream on , you'll never get me. - Your Teacher.|`|2PDhpyuGaa	ur retared/....a dream is a dream come on now ???u 5????|`|8tRCj45daa	Oh... having 'it' with your teacher is fine, as long as you arent having something inappropriate like sex or something.  It is a fun pastime!<br>   I love doing it with apples... this is very fun and you ought to try, it iwll make you feel better and give you awesome dreams!
kbGOMwi7aa	whats your age|`|TFizPrvuaa	just act like yourself. and let her know how you feel|`|257c793aa3e94e50b48a47f0d7bf2c8caa	umm! are you in love with one person or a bunch of people??? according to my experience if you can not impress someone after some time, it is not possible that he/she falls fully in love with you. you are trying your best, if it's not working time to move on!
xuDGrCSVaa	He's not going to change.  You have to get away from him someway.  You need to check to see if there are any kind of "safe houses" for battered women in you area.  Also check the phone book for a domestic abuse hot line you can call.  They can help you out alot. <br>  Or you could let your family know, and see if you can move back home with them.  If you can't do either of those things- try to get a job and save up money and get your own place so you can leave him before he really hurts you or your baby.  I hope this helps...|`|wvDh3PdFaa	i believe your boyfriend is emotionaly disturbed. you need to a  pproach a marital counselor  or a pschologist they could help you.but after these efforts that you made still he will behave the same then its the time for you to  go out from the scene and find another life that will make you happy and move on your still young.|`|GrCj35muaa	the baby complicates thing but you need to remember, it isn't "his" daughter, she is yours together but "you" take care of her and need to think of her. do you want her to be with a man that hurts her the way your bf hurts you? what dies his family see or think of it? would you family take in you and your daughter? you need to decided what is best for her because now she is the only one that matters. Think of your daughter's future and what things will be like 5 and 10 years down the road, what you want for her and how you can make that happen. he isn't going to stop. once you can accept that, you can make the right decision for the baby.|`|S0MOQGJJaa	ya i suggest to as well call a hotline of some type... i guess if you don't take that option though, are you close to any one of his family members to talk to them and tell them your boyfriend is doing that to you. I'm very sorry you have to go through something like that... do protect yourself and report him or something... if this cheers you up any you could always disable his baby makin machine next time he hits you xD
awUzUxo5aa	and yet YOUR answer to another Question....<br>  <br>  Was a tad homophobic!<br>  <br>  Enjoy!|`|KJbmhReQaa	Yup, that's a pretty big sign that he's interested in you. I mean, he asked you for your number and is trying to get you to go out with him and his friends--I think you can about make it a definite that he likes you. If you feel the same way, go for it!
ZoeS825Kaa	You're an idiot|`|Oz0h1TXwaa	Yay! You got confidence!<br>  1 down, 3401928341837409183740138 to go!|`|vYXnUKK8aa	Sounds like you got some self confidence.
aYL3hzgvaa	Of course it's right to break up with him. I mean it sucks you lost your virginity to someone you weren't in love with, but things change, and it's not right to stick around if you're going nowhere. <br>  <br>  Sure, he'll be upset, even more so when he sees you with another boy, but you could always wait awhile before getting with the other boy. Make sure he's who you really want.|`|yuwjQjKqaa	Yes your virginity and breaking up have nothing to do with each other.|`|pUr5F3vAaa	If you don't like your boyfriend anymore, it's not fair to stay with him just because you feel bad breaking up with him. He'll probably be upset if you break up with him and then go after someone shortly after, but you shouldn't stay with him if you don't want to. That's not fair to either to you, even if he was the one you lost your virginity to.
qcGepiOJaa	yes based from what you saying...i think you are in love..the feeling of break up never....was a good feeling....well when u truelly care for someone....that feeling is always there..and u kind of regret why this and that happen...and ...yesh it hard to let someone go especially u care so much for them..i been there and thru that..and it hurts like hell...but...yeah ...somehow....improved or learned from ur mistake..whatever that may cause the break up|`|74MRvhO9aa	I think you might be falling in love, you should tell her how you feel,<br>  she might even feel the same way.|`|AmFLzUxvaa	aww :( i think you are saddd. maybee loove though! good luck cutie :)|`|lK3TXGBOaa	yeah you still are in love with her... were in the same situation except i dont talk to my ex aat all.... i always think about my x and i miss him so much!! everything i do everywhere i go reminds me of him and i asked a question a couple of days ago its about him ( im trying to make a decision..) <br>  <br>  <br>  can you please answer my question?<br>  <br>  go to my profile under my questions the first one that says " HELP!!! need advice........."<br>  <br>   i would gladly appreciate it <br>  <br>  thanx :)
LybMYXsLaa	Just accidentally bump into him or drop your things right in front of him. If he shows interest go from there, ask his name, if you wanted to go out for coffee sometime(only if it seems like you are hitting it off), etc. Just act chill about it and if things work out they do and if they don't they don't
SCff9vNBaa	im not sure. i mean he might not would have wanted to see your body.<br>  not to offend u or anything but he might have been a bit uncomfortable<br>  when u sent him the picture. maybe you should send him a picture<br>  of you and him at somewhere nice.
Xq25R0Bwaa	if he really respects you things like that would be awkward for him.<br>  Maybe hes the type of guy who loves you for you and doesnt need stuff like that. Save that stuff for when you know its right. dont put it all out there.|`|4sJsnuCsaa	well for one i dont know why he wouldt like it its obvious your pretty, are you sure hes "faithfull"?|`|13d4bd226d0dce7fe19e7693dc8cfed9aa	send me your pic, maybe i can help out|`|fOK3tPRVaa	call him can u help me out<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090307211451AAgaIyE">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>
XTSiJBv4aa	conrad- you rock!!! being a virgin is great!!! i know because i am 27 and still one. there are other things to do in life that will give you pleasure. like  joining a bowling team, or a softball team, or taking a art class at a local community college. anyway- i heard sex is over rated, and keeping it in your pants, prevents pregnancies and diseases. good for you!!! virgins rock!!!|`|FFKbVKWDaa	no<br>  she just lost interest<br>  i say find somebody else=]|`|Yz1pzloSaa	No.|`|Wy0lUjP9aa	Well, she should of told you. But what does going out with someone has to do with your senior year. There are plenty of teens who enjoy their senior year and then date as well. Unless, you were making her skip school. I think she may have gotten bored with you, I don't think it has to do with not doing anything past kissing, but then it may have, I don't know. She is not trying to tell you, so I say slowly forget her and move on.|`|AA10092586	no it wasnt it was not a mistake your right your still young like myself and iam still a virgin and about to bea junior that is her mistake but dont wait on her it wil never happen trust me and you should just let god direct  you in the right way i promise he will help you just beileve in him as your savior and he will hwlp you.|`|l0F7lSaraa	Of course no..:)<br>  She was with you to have fun together...not for sex...:)|`|m3Vf6nbeaa	nope. keeping it clean is always better|`|rALoVUVoaa	No mistake at all, be true to yourself<br>  <br>  I'm proud of you kid
eGpOIV12aa	send him revealing pics, web cams, and if you have the money, a weekend visit|`|AA10327793	Well, I don't know how you two are talking with each other, but flirting and teasing are always hot. If you think that flirting is only for the pre-relationship couples, than you missed the whole point of romance. Phone sex is good but not always. Flirt and tease him. There is no other things to do on phone. Oh wait, there is one more thing to do: role playing. When he calls you, or you calls him, think about some role, and play it. For example, if he calls you, you can play the role of the secretary of some big company who wants to seduce the caller. If he gets your play, he will play too, and it will be fun. Although, it all depends on what kind of guy he is.
lNlL0Ag2aa	Trust me, that's the exact opposite of weird, what would be completely abnormal would be dating guys who are 10 years younger than you. That's something that is from what I see in society, as socially unaccepting.|`|uRbeSOMwaa	Yes, there is.|`|WQ4hXvzmaa	nah its normal dont worry
xrr8QTcNaa	1) she doesn't like you.... why? because if she did she wouldn't make that kind of excuses one day and after wards go out with a guy and then again make the same excuses <br>  <br>  2)  I think she wants to be just friends with you <br>  <br>  So you should do one of 2. <br>  <br>  Either just forget about her... go out meet some other girls there's always that one right for you.<br>  <br>  Or convince her that you're the best choice for her.... like buy her stuff, be a gentlemen all the time, sometimes make her jealous, etc<br>  <br>  hope it helps
8gDRQ7v2aa	NO!!!!!!|`|SBPd5W5oaa	no.....

People know and weather you have pictures to prove it or not the word will be spread. My advice is to take this one as a hit don't spread it around more and try not to do it again. No matter how hot they are ;). Stuff will fade over time dont let it be seen that it bothers you and over time it will pass.|`|dPgc8p9saa	ummm sweetie there is no way to solve your problem....but to let it pass over...you shouldnt have done it in the first place...guys lose respect for u and think of you as loose!! if you want that cool but if u dont want that then i suggest you stay under the radar!! high school is rough i know im still a teenager sort of!!|`|5vbrHrzvaa	uhhh hot <br>  but take them down if all else fails go to the principle i dont want you to but seems like you want to<br>  <br>  p.s. send me one lol|`|DFaMY7Aaaa	Tell the ones who have the pics on their phones that they can be charged with child pornography.(if you're under 18)|`|2ij4wwjgaa	naw<br>  u gonna have 2 deal with this 1<br>  every action has a consequence|`|akvrwpywaa	Too late.

Hopefully, they'll understand that you made a simple mistake and won't make a big deal about it.  If you're still in high school, and you're topless in the pics, then those pics are technically child porn.  Believe me, the administration will act quickly to get rid of them.<br>  <br>  Besides that, just laugh it off.  Who cares, right?  We all do crazy stunts once in a while.  In the future, try not to let people push you around like that.  You deserve to be treated better.

If I were you I would send signals like ask him about what he likes in women and all that stuff.

78KkLagGaa	They would fall over backwards to be with you .....|`|qdsVS1dDaa	Sammy, older guys like me still have a lot to offer a woman. Older guys are more settled, successful, have our toys and stuff, and know how to appreciate a woman. We get our pleasure from pleasing our woman, rather than it being all for us, like younger guys. <br>  <br>  Lots of older men have dated and married younger women.

Kyokb1AIaa	Ask yourself this question... Is this a person that you would lose it all for? Give up everything for? Die for? If not it is more or less a physical attraction. You can't fully love someone that doesn't know that you love them. It just don't make sense. Love is a word that is thrown around very loosely in our culture today. I LOVE the movies! I LOVE this ice cream! I LOVE blah blah blah..the list goes on. So think beyond your mind and what you see...is this a person how wants to be with you just as much as you want to be with him? <br>  <br>  I'm assuming that your young too!
seMpUL8Kaa	A million times better.|`|CVVl4U4caa	Good?|`|9OOEDh6daa	different...<br>  its an unexplainable feeling, its like its meant to be and the pleasure it 10 times better and you feel like at the moment NOTHING bad can happen VS. regular sex with someone you dont love at all/think your in love, its plain yet feels good just not AS good|`|I0CSy0y4aa	love is indescribable.<br>  if you can explain it perfectly,<br>  it's called "like".|`|DOySzeyAaa	Just the same.
Dx9h0qkFaa	From what you say they all probably like you a little bit. If you like one of them tell them you like them. Girls usually don't make the first move, but they will show you they are interested by flirting, which is what they are doing to you.|`|MHfT0EiRaa	Ask her out.<br>  <br>  Just say "I heard that ___________ was a good movie and I was thinking about going to see it. Want to come?"|`|lUuxrGAtaa	If they are really interested then they will ask you who ur datin, flirt with u  (DUH) if you wanna hang out, ask to be ur partner, but you also need to remember that girls are very shy and they dont like to ask a guy if they dont know if the guy like them
450d7108dcc557d8dc4bb1c606d1bee1aa	Personality is definitely more important than looks.<br>  Everybody gets rejected.<br>  There's somebody out there for you.<br>  Don't worry, you'll find them. Don't give up. :)

iTk7aaYdaa	i dont think its a coincidence.dat kinda stuff cant rly hapn.<br>  <br>  <br>  is it possible dat she has feelingz for u & shez scared dat u mite know how much she likes u...& she only said dat to throw u off & make u think dat she duznt actually like u, even tho she duz.....?|`|DsXyMuAiaa	It means he's on her mind...|`|SV6imBp3aa	you remind her of him.<br>  which is a good thing cos then that means she likes two people nearly the same!|`|2tn8EALqaa	she was thinking about him
7ot3Rqgpaa	Seriously the age difference shouldn't be what bothers you, it should be the fact that you guys are RELATED! And what kind of parents would say " Oh sure honey have sex with your cousin, thanks for asking"?|`|Kwywmcs8aa	Do it you might end up with a mutated super baby.|`|fBXRNKyuaa	OMG, you did not just say that, PLEASE say you are joking. <br>  <br>  PLEEEEEAAAASE.|`|vifwGatdaa	Wow. I can't answer whether you should have sex with your cousin, that's very much a personal decision but I don't get why people are so judgmental when it comes to this topic. It's not always your choice who you like or end up falling in love with. I'm 33 and have been involved sexually with my cousin (actually first cousin once removed, he's my moms cousin so his grandmother was my great grandmother and his dad is my grandmothers brother) since I was 15 (he's 2 years older). We didn't grow up together but when we'd see each other as children, there was always a mutual attraction. My family moved to his city when I was 14 and shortly after we started messing around. In our case, our family and friends (we hang out with a lot of the same people and old classmates) would never accept our relationship even though we're very much in love so other than 2 of my friends who live out of town, noone knows. I do find it very odd, actually disturbing that parents would encourage their children to have sex. That's just weird.But since you've been dating her for a while, I say If it happens and feels right go for it.|`|15a395b81e70741dfdfed45167d39207aa	Do you both live in a trailer. You know if you both guys I would say go for it there would be no baby to pay for but your both sick. WTF in your next question your asking how to beat off.|`|MHfT0EiRaa	That is messed up. <br>  <br>  If this is a joke, it isn't funny.<br>  <br>  Imagine what your mother would think!!!|`|K80lNAnmaa	are her parents high? that's just not right...|`|kzIVGEfgaa	No... Well, it's your issue, but it's actually MAJORLY looked down upon. Plus, the odds of you having a NORMAL baby, are very low. <br>  <br>  About the age difference, odds are it's illegal in your state because it's 4 years and you're over 18...|`|G6Xcv1uhaa	WOOOAHHH TMI.<br>  <br>  That would be a little bit incest-ual, and is banned in some cultures. Also, it could be considered rape considering she is a MINOR. So yeah. That's like double time not very good....yeahhh...<br>  <br>  But I guess if the parents okayed it (WTF) well, actually...no....|`|m3Vf6nbeaa	WTF!!! thats ****** up|`|Yw0Kp3k0aa	Yerrr kidding rightt?<br>  <br>  Thatis so disgusting.<br>  <br>  I sayy NO..!<br>  <br>  EWWWWW!|`|rALoVUVoaa	You know, I knew a pair of first cousins that were in love and happily married|`|hyRGNZh8aa	ur like the third person to ask this!!!!!!111 no its frowned upon and gross!!  your gona have like 3 headed children its called interbreeding|`|9OOEDh6daa	her parents said to have sex with her??????<br>  WHAT! MORE DETAILES<br>  <br>  <br>  ummm are u blood & is she ur 1st,2nd,3rd,4th ect cousin?|`|04EZZKFBaa	A little odd about the encouragement part but...<br>  <br>  If she won't be a minor that soon, why the hell not?<br>  Oh, so long as it's legal in the state you're in (since you are cousins).<br>  <br>  Although, the only way you'd ever get caught is if someone actually reported you guys.<br>  <br>  Anyway, the age difference doesn't really matter much after you turn about 20.<br>  And it's only, roughly, 3 years between you two right?<br>  If she won't be a minor soon, then 3 years is no big deal.|`|MyOTiSYoaa	If it is what you want, whatever floats your boat. And hey at least you'll be able to have some fun at family reunions. And to all the people bagging your for it, they have no right to, if people didn't do that the human race woulda died out eons ago. Personally tho, i would even consider it cause nowadays there's plenty of fish in the sea.|`|4sfgS1bBaa	LMAO.<br>  <br>  That'S FuNnY....PeOpLe ArE TeLLiNg YoU tHaT's wRoNg.<br>  <br>  I MeAn It iS BuT....I MeAn WhaTeVeR...JuSt DoN't TaKe It SerIoUs And UsE a CoNdOm!!

yrEQq2vsaa	yea she will either get over it of become a stalker either way stay away
FZKFLTyLaa	He's not ready for a committed relationship. At least not with you.<br>  Do what you think best based on that sure knowledge.|`|etV271ARaa	Im afraid you need to accept that he wants to move on. You've had 6 years together and he had had adeuate time to consider if you are his all time permanent life partner. Over a long time, a BF/GF relationship can evolve into a kind of deep affection without romantic attachment. Thats what has happened.<br>  <br>  Why dont you give him his space and if he comes back, well and good.
6sJhoXAAaa	He sounds like the type "If I can't have you nobody else can either"<br>  I think he's trying to say that nobody but him can make her happy, and claiming that nobody but her can make him happy.|`|d01EV6npaa	well he's saying u cant take back time...|`|UjuDBY6Faa	it means they are going to break up soon.....|`|hzxplycYaa	he's basically trying to say that he's already tried making up for those 5 wasteful years. And he's stating that you won't be able to get over it because he couldn't. He sounds like an as$ by the way.|`|ZA9B34dLaa	that they maybe need to go back together <br>  by the way add me: <br>  www.myspace.com/crazyanacarolina|`|QhXL4Lilaa	That's actually funny. He's not going to let her make up for that......I'm not really sure, but he seems like an asshole and she just made her self look stupid...|`|4SXa9lJWaa	Just keep your eye out.|`|e9431e7aacbf06accd4aa1aae5cc622baa	I think he means that they can't make up for the time they wasted on eachother. Neither of em can so he's making that clear.|`|JuGH3Rowaa	he means that he couldnt make up so hes asuming that she cant becasue he thinks hes better|`|jOLtcXufaa	im not sure the situation, but it kinda sounds like he regrets something, or maybe hes not able to move on?|`|hWUXnEpMaa	wassup sugar|`|c3vFddfBaa	likee iim not over you, and im sure youre not over mee!|`|K8wDgNwbaa	if she does then hes going to chris brown her ***|`|l1jQohGqaa	idk ask him|`|fu23SUbkaa	What he means by that is : <br>  " What the hell.. you won't be able to make up for those 5 years. If I couldn't have made up for those years, I don't think you'll be able to too. "<br>  <br>  Which I thnik he means is that he still remembers/still has feelings for you. And he can't move on from it.<br>  <br>  Well, that's what I think. It's just my assumption|`|xxQwv1nSaa	He's just trying to say "you'll never have another man like me". Let him be cocky and talk all his ****, cause you have her and not him. He's probably just angry cause he screwed up what you and her have now.|`|VSbFuYMNaa	He's probably saying that<br>  they wasted 5 years for nothing<br>  and she thinks she can make up for it<br>  while the ex-boyfriend doesnt want her happy<br>  at all :]|`|LsbzHLu1aa	that she cant make up for the 5 years because obviously he cant either and he doesn't wont her to forget about him that easily|`|7VmIgqviaa	he doesn't want the girl to be happy. he's just A S S . the girl shouldn't pay attention to it if she thinks she can get over him.|`|JyT9gKl4aa	I think he means "if i cant get over you and move on,you cant"|`|sxnt92moaa	Lmao he doest want her to be happy. He's not happy so she cant be happy.?|`|iokl7H8naa	he can't be back with her no more.but he still loves her|`|se6oL4saaa	y don't u ask him..?
JgKosPJpaa	no i dont think so but your boyfriend might not be too happy about it.|`|3y0w1qIBaa	Yes, it is cheating.|`|vq4DYBGgaa	I'm almost positive that if your BF showed his dick to random girls via webcam..you would be pissed|`|cvBkyVRyaa	First, it is stupid.<br>  <br>  Second it is probably cheating.<br>  <br>  If you have to ask the question, then it is cheating.|`|wI3AAkIoaa	No, but that is providing you do not show your face.|`|yuwjQjKqaa	Yes that is cheating.|`|8lrozLcVaa	well to my knowledge if you are in a relationship and you do any kind of sexual gesture at another person is cheating in some way...<br>  Some ways are worse then others but its all cheating....|`|RrUFIMAPaa	It seems that would just be having fun, and being a little horny.. haha. But ehh it could be classified as cheating.. its whatever.|`|e9431e7aacbf06accd4aa1aae5cc622baa	Definitely cheating. Why would u wanna do that anyway??|`|sxnt92moaa	No.... What're you cheating on?<br>  <br>  Photoshopping yer bewbs?? lmao.<br>  <br>  Be more clear?<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Maybe being a whoree lmao but no cheatin there?|`|ySIM3znvaa	if its as a dare then know. If your tell your boyfriend then no. If you just do it then yes.|`|sq3fDsiJaa	yes i think it is cheating...and just plain slutty|`|sL5CY6Q7aa	yeah i would not tolerate that with my gf. you obviously dont like it, so you decide|`|eo0DKI0qaa	any one guy- yes. a whole bunch- maybe|`|6aQi4sHeaa	Yes that counts as cheating. And it puts one in the catagory of a stripper or **** or whatever. And if that guy happens to be a rapist/homicidal maniac I hope you lock up your doors and windows cause he might come and get ya. If your just stating a point and not actually doing anything of the sort, then good for you! But if its anything otherwise, you are now in a not very good catagory and will be scarred for life.|`|bxJalSP2aa	Cheating comes from in the heart. If you feel guilty about something you've done, like showing your boobs to a guy on a web cam, then it is cheating. If you feel bad about something like that, then yes in my opinion it would be cheating.|`|4R1lry3Yaa	Yea, and it's slutty and whorish too.|`|ke1SgRxTaa	YES YES YES and its EXTREMELY STUPID ...idiot ...no offense =)|`|CYSUuFmVaa	i think its hot
Xe6U6taXaa	Why dont you try calling him, my boyfriend who is Indian also, we dated for 9 months before I went to a Bhangra party(Indian party) with him. But I do think its kind of strange, if he usually call you daily and now he's not I would call him to see why.
vCuPShf8aa	I would probably email him and say how you found out that your grandmother had sent the pic of you to him and how your sorry about it and how it was not your idea.  You think he is cool and all but you wouldnt have your grandmother try to fix you up with a guy.<br>  Give him the idea that you have possitive thoughts about him but your not chasing him.  Guys run from girls chasing them.
V7976L4Daa	i am a father of 2 twin girls who are 17 years old. they are always concerned about their looks. i tell them that it is about your personality. if you find a guy who likes you without makeup and when you are smelling and dirty from camping, then they are the true match for you. if they like you when you are at your worst, they will love you at your best as well.|`|SWBsLshtaa	to tell the truth, i dont really like anorexic girls. Most boyfriends dont want their girlfriends and to change.
5b69b0aee2e0929afbcd2166a8e14474aa	hun you are going to have to learn to deal with disappointment and not USE sex as a medicine....you will earn yourself a reputation that is going to matter to somene in a big way...one day.<br>  Take up jogging, a hobby, anything, but stop bed hopping
kERP7zAhaa	yeah, a couple freshmen were dating seniors at my school and everyone talked about how weird it was|`|t4ebT9araa	yeah it might seem a little weird to people...<br>  but if you really like htis guy,<br>  don't worry about it.<br>  its only a big age difference when you're in school.<br>  think about it, 14 and 18 is a little weird seeming right?<br>  but 22 and 26 isnt.|`|SEyRe6Eaaa	I don't think it would be terribly weird if you both want to put in the effort of a relationship As long as you realize that it may be bumpy, why not go for it?|`|GrWCIQvJaa	freshman and a jr. lol it will work for a few months and he is gone.but it does seem a bit weird|`|RPT0wF9Uaa	I don't think it would ppl would be jealous of u
L1ip6ohVaa	Have you had a conversation with her? If you haven't had a real conversation with her yet, you're going to have to before you ask her out (otherwise, it's kind of creepy).<br>  <br>  When you walk past her, try saying hi and stopping to talk to her. If she has any degree of social know-how, she'll stop, too. That's a way to start a conversation.<br>  <br>  You could see if she's on facebook. That might help (and you could message her as a way to ask her out).<br>  <br>  Also: I'd probably stick to coffee or lunch. Since you don't see her a lot, keep it casual.|`|vP9BuEOvaa	well why dont you ask her in a note?<br>  or catch up to her && just ask her out<br>  and theres always your friendz in case you<br>  are too shy =]
iTk7aaYdaa	obviously, she is uninterested.ur freaking her out.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ignore her, see if she will come to u. das da only thing i can suggest at dis point|`|ZOXP3HKlaa	She is probly really freakin nervous. tell her you want to take her out just keep tryin thats all i can say, ask her why she always says no|`|DcrI9zmkaa	Sounds to me like you need to take the hint and move on.|`|Akt4uZsAaa	it seems like your just her texting buddy someone to talk to when she's bored....%|`|c4C5hNEyaa	maybe she is nervous and not ready to start a relation ship|`|fca256c18e2ddc70911db7e7e706e07aaa	i think you should leave her be...and see how she reacts....|`|VAUK7KYKaa	is she living with her parents? she might be afraid to ask them to go out with you because her parents may be strict. ask her.|`|VqWBGWAoaa	Move on, man. Pass her, leave her behind, she's going too slow. <br>  <br>  "Next!"
3FkMjHqlaa	i dont think you should have broke up with him you should have told him how you felt and told him you wanted to meet her in order to feel more comfortable.  I dont think you should have broken up with him because your jealous or suspicious.  Only break up with him if he actually did something now because you think he might be doing something, you could be wrong and be making a mistake.|`|XGgPhaDbaa	yup
FbtEvsIGaa	i don't know why people are shy ,walk up to her and tell her what you would like to do with her . a movie [if so let her have input as far as where to go] take a walk and just talk .set on the porch and look at stars . the biggest thing is to talk, than you will find out what she is all about . you know the most she can say is no ,contrary to what you may feel ya wont die|`|C8DOT8Y7aa	Establish a more-than-just-friends relationship. Start by asking her for something to play on, like if you are in her class, ask her for a pencil or eraser. If she's slightly interested, she might play about, teasing you for it. Don't worry, it's not that she doesn't like you. She expects you to play along, so maybe walk off in mock sulk, don't do it too heavily though. She might start to think you are weird if you do. If she comes by you and asks you who you like, you know you are on the right track. They are probably just as nervous as you, so they want to get that type of approach as well. This probably means that they like you, and your job just got much easier. <br>  Compliment her, but be careful. Unless they are desperate, they might think you are desperate or making something too obvious. So maybe tell her you like her new hairstyle but then go behind her and mess around with it, spice it up. She'll like your courage to go play about with her hair but make sure she doesn't have dandruff or lice because although you might not be too bothered, she will get embarrassed and scared to go near you. Also, don't lay it on like you've seen in the movies: "I like your handbag.". No guy, in school, will honestly care about a handbag. Something you might truly like you can compliment on. <br>  Start a ball game (not literally). Be a little far away and look at her, admire her. She'll catch your gaze and look at you. Look away suddenly but keep an eye out for her looking back at you. If she is, get up and walk past her, possibly giving her a little smile as you go. <br>  Have chats with her. Ask her if she has any pets and find out some interesting things. Make sure she knows you inside out as well. <br>  Move in closer, be alone and look down. Look up at her eyes, look lost in her world for a second, and then say "I,(pause),like you. So...(cough)..Will you go out with me" While you say this look down. Look up when you say me and smile questioningly. If that isn't your style, there is another way to ask a girl out. All you have to do is walk up (make sure she's alone), and ask her to go out with you in a confident (but relaxed!) manner. <br>  Don't try too hard, girls aren't stupid, they can tell when you get desperate. Be relaxed and confident in yourself. <br>  Don't just become friends with her, become friends with all of her friends, as relationships are made and broken on her friends' opinions. <br>  If she says no, she means NO. Just back off for awhile, leave her to cool down, but don't give up complete hope. <br>  Be confident, not cocky. The difference is there, and very noticeable for girls. Make jokes and be self-confident; women love it when men make them laugh. <br>  When the time comes to ask her out, wait for the opportune moment. Trust your instincts; they will tell you when the time is right. As mentioned earlier, it's probably best not to do it in front of her friends or in front of your friends. It's easier for both of you if you are alone. <br>  If she says "I'll think about it" it's not a good sign, although she could just be nervous, or caught up in the moment, and she's being careful not to make a stupid mistake. Don't bug her about it, let it go a few days - if she doesn't bring it up again, it's a no. <br>  Don't ask her out as a dare, or as a joke - this can really hurt a girl's feelings. Be sure that you are doing it because you want to, if you don't you could really become known as a jerk. <br>  If you see any facial expressions, like an eye raise, make sure you say, "it's okay if you say no."
7LS5HmFjaa	There are some things that must be considered. Were there any court papers clearly stating the arrangement for this child? If so, you could be in violation in which you would have to surrender the child. I am concerned with this sudden disruption for the child...how has he adapted to being with you and in a new school? Unless you have to surrender child, father now needs to obtain any visitation through the court system. No one can say you are wrong or right for only you know the circumstances. However, all parties must consider what is best for the child and make arrangements accordingly. It must be made legal to ensure this doesn't happen again. Irregardless of the situation, It seems that his father does care for him and supports him...work this out so your son can have the best of both parents. That is something many of todays children do not have.|`|Lfc9Zav2aa	I dunno what was the REASON you didn't return him to his dad. Then I can make a decision based on facts.|`|8zgFyfibaa	Selfish b1+tch is all I have to say, he pays for your sons food school etc....... god will punsih you|`|MlCWsBcwaa	Well, if you doing this is messing with your son's schooling, his security, his relationship with his dad and is against the law, then it sounds like you have made the wrong choice.  You have given his dad good reason to mistrust you.  He should be paying maintenance for your son, as well as being a part of his life.  You should be a part of his life too, but not stop him going to school and having a normal life.  Good luck, I hope it works out for you all.  Maybe the best thing to do is to put him back in school and talk to his dad about working out what is best for your and his son.|`|2PDhpyuGaa	umm one there is prob a reason y he dnt let u see ur son... n let him see his dad it took to to mak him not one. he has every right to see him as u do. and to put him back in school that prob is the best school and u just up n took him out what kind of mom are you.. take him back to his dad n work stuff out..like u get him every other weekend..but if i was the dad  i wouldnt let u see him takin my baby aways.. and another thing u need to be thinkin bout ur son not ur self. whats best for him not u|`|GAbGgdQ4aa	Are you even legally allowed to do that?  Wasn't there a custody agreement thing?|`|kQA7SbY9aa	I think that what you did was wrong. If your son's father wouldn't let you see him, you should have taken him to court. Maybe your custody agreement could have been changed? Sorry, I understand that you missed him and only you know why he was sent to live with your ex, but it doesn't sound like what you did was in your son's best interest and now you could find yourself in trouble for kidnapping...Your son is missing school to keep you company. Is that really fair to him? I hope he doesn't suffer too much from this mess and that you and your ex can find a way to resolve your issues. One very sad situation.
2gike2NNaa	move in with him<br>   you need something new and exiting in your relationship.<br>  the wilder the betta|`|gcsnMAlCaa	He doesn't sound too committed to having a relationship.  It sounds like he's too cowardly to come right out and say that he's not into you.  I say that you should walk out.
B4YESGmwaa	Has he started treatment, or meetings or is this "will power" which is not likely to work. More manipulation with the statement- he can do it better with you there. If that was true why was he using for the last 2 yrs of you being with him. Alcoholics are very manipulative and I feel free to say that with being in recovery. It is a statement not a judgement. You asked for feed back and that is what I offer, please do not be offended. You need to attend Alanon or CoDa meetings or you will be caught in his hell for a long time and believe me (as you probably are aware of) it will only get worse. If you would like to chat please email me as usual. God Bless Reggie|`|B359bLqsaa	I understand what you are saying because I had to deal with a drug addiction from my husband.  its been 2 years and I can tell you that its still hard.  My poor husband still struggles with his addictions, even though he is not using drugs anymore.  He is so sorry for what he did, but he has a problem.  I love him so much but some days its hard to live in the same house with him.  Maybe it wont be so hard for you.  I think I would rather my husband cheated on me then have him with an addiction.  I know how to handle another woman, but how can you fight a drug or a drink???|`|D3hYbsVJaa	If he can do it for a month- start to slowly re-involve, He will always live with this addiction, but he has to be the one to beat it. Having someone who knows him will help. Just make it directly clear that he needs to continue getting better to continue you coming back.|`|A3Rq88Qmaa	My dad was an alcoholic, and it took probably four months for him to give it up. It was just back and forth, the worst time of my life. Finally, he joined AA, and it helped a lot. I know that one symptom of alcoholism is convincing oneself that they can quit, but they're really unable too. I'd try convincing him to join some sort of group, depending how bad he is.|`|AA11391968	Al Anon is where you need to go.  It's a support group for family and friends of alcoholics.

ilV7PClvaa	I have parents like that. They don't let me watch anything rated M, which is for 15+. I'm 17.<br>  <br>  Basically, you can't do anything. They'll always find a way to control or punish you, and they actually can take away your right to leave the house.<br>  <br>  You'll have to find a way to break their rules without them knowing while pretending to respect them.|`|ZYUeEbI0aa	You can try to reason nicely, but I am in a similar position. Sometimes you just cant do much, but just listen to them somewhat. You are under there care.<br>  <br>  I know it sucks like hell, but same as people say wait till you can move out.<br>  <br>  btw its good to learn how to deal with people that are unfair/against you.

Atleast you have parents that hug you and talk to you and say I love you. I have parents. I don't have parents that i can communicate with.

I do not remember the last time my parents hugged me or when they said I love you to me.<br>  <br>  On top of this, I do not have ANY relatives. I've just never known them.

If my child acted like that - I would be taking the ps3 away and then that would be the end of that discussion. <br>  <br>  I bet that the reason they are saying "NO!" is because you are giving them attitude and demanding to use the ps3 on "their"  tv. Parents do not respond well to this type of behavior.<br>  <br>  Have you even thought about doing chores or mowing neighbors lawns to earn money to purchase your own flat screen tv or even earn the opportunity to borrow theirs? You can get them very reasonably these days and wouldn't take you all that long to earn the money.<br>  <br>  Let me add this: I am no way a mean Mom. My 6 yr old son's Wii is hooked up to a 52" flat screen. Your attitude is what is making them say NO! Try a better attitude and offer to earn the use of their tv.<br>  <br>  Edited because you added more info: When you reason with them, how are you presenting it to them? It may be the way you are presenting this or even the tone you use to reason with them that it putting them off.<br>  <br>  I am saying this because my husband has this tone that he uses when he is trying to prove his point (not a raised voice or anything remotely like that) it's sounds belittling. He is a very nice man "doesn't" mean to, but it does unfortunately come across that way. He knows this, and has to work extra hard to overcome it. <br>  <br>  Try a different tone and different way. Just try to use the earning the privilege route and see how that goes. Don't ask for it to be always hooked up to the flat screen. Say something like, I do this and this and that earns me 1 hour etc. and then unhook it. See if that works. Even ask them to play something with you. Obviously the route you are taking isn't working. You must think outside the box.

BkyXvYvIaa	Yes, it's rude. She's basically trying to use you for your discount card. And even further, she wants to *take* it from you when you already have plans doing something else. Multiple phone calls? Knowing that you're already out from the house, then expecting you to rush home so that she can pick it up?<br>  <br>  You're definitely not overreacting at all. This girl is being outright rude and not "friend"-like at all. I don't really think that the determination is about the "10% off an already cheap meal" but more so her wanting to get her way. (Basically, getting what she wanted from you since you denied it from her in the first place.)|`|ba27c3109d83ee0c5a54111cb5de0fbaaa	oh wow, your friend sucks. She sounds like she is just using you for whenever she needs something (e.g the card) Use the card yourself and start to only talk to your friend when you need something, so she can feel what you feel like when she is trying to use you.

kd3ufKBDaa	ok i wil be the first person to admit that i have major shyness issues so by going from my personal experience i would suggest trying to start a conversation until he starts warming up to u try to keep them brief but very friendly, when he gets to the point that he can talk openly or trys to continue the convo. then try making them long ones but dont try to pressure him and make sure he knows he can trust you because atleast for me that is where i get my shyness issues but hey if u have any questions about wat i have said then feel free to ask me but dont get paranoid if i take a long time to respond cause i dont check my email alot.... o and in case u are wondering the reason i can talk openly now is cause it is less personal over the computer so i have no issues about it|`|I5qUHjclaa	HI, I'm actually going through this right now. <br>  I suggest:<br>  1) evaluate how he acts with his frineds and how they interact<br>  2) ur right taking things slow with a shy person is smart act like how his friends act but still be urself soon he'll start treating u liek one of his friend if he respects ur presence <br>  3) wait don't get anxious <br>  4)give him hints u liek him bbut DONT be obvious cuz that can ruin everythign<br>  5)friendship is the key even to out going guys be his friend first let him know he can trust u then take the steps in ur heart that u think u can handle to try and be with him <br>  <br>  "if it is meant to be it will happen"|`|eOcc6EOeaa	Ok, a guy is a guy. I would know I am one...<br>  shy guys are no different in getting than a hyper active one.<br>  <br>  1) Find out what he likes; video games, music, movies, anime, books, etc.<br>  <br>  2a) If you like similar things then start up a chat with that.<br>  2b) If not, try to like something he likes, try to be supportive, or just pretend (lol), so you have something to talk about.<br>  <br>  3) After alot of small talk, start asking him to group friend events, such as movies, mall, hang outs, etc.<br>  <br>  4) Just keep doing this until you get a chance to be alone as in same events, but just you two.<br>  <br>  5) Sooner or later if feels the same about you, then he will ask you to be his girl friend or on a actual date.<br>  <br>  Just takes time...<br>  Hope this helps.|`|U4CDNWoUaa	I used to be pretty shy so i might be able to help. <br>  <br>  Just take it really slow and try to talk to him a little bit more everyday.

Personally, I prefer that someone else comes up to me instead of me going up to them. Usually a joke of some sort can ease things. Back in 7th grade, there was this guy that I thought was kinda cute. We never got around to talking, but one day he accidentally cut in front of me in the hall. So I was like "Oookay, don't cut me off" and we had a good laugh about it. We ended up eventually dating and being great friends even after we broke up :)<br>  Or you could even ask him for help/advice on homework/work and then just start a conversation. Hope this helps a little|`|LRYKlzkpaa	This reminds me of my friend brisa and her current boyfriend Chris.<br>  He was the new kid at our school and was really shy.

All you have to do is be friendly with him and make him feel special. Brisa's boyfriend was really shy because he didn't habe much confidence so you just got to raise his confidence|`|KmKtu1qGaa	always give a graceful smile every time you see him, flirt a bit but not too much. try to talk with him when he is alone, with no friends around. it would be much easier for him. if he likes you, he will respond by talking more to you.|`|37M3dkkRaa	do you have anything in common with him? if you don't just fake it. find out what he's into and talk to him about it. that should open him up a bit. just start a casual conversation, don't be all like I LOVE YOU and ****...that'll scare him.|`|0fcwsv7Vaa	Get to be freinds first.

Let him get comfortable with you, he should open up a little bit, find out what he likes to do, see if  you have anything in common, try to hang out alone with him, i mean see if he would like to do something with you sometime, just the two of you, but if he's shy he's more than likely not going to make the first move. hope this helps|`|RMmh0aimaa	That's tough. Probably if you approach him while he is alone is the best solution as he won't feel pressured by other people. But take it slow. Casually run into him and ask his something simple like what time is it so that he can become a little by little more confident in speaking to you.<br>  <br>  I think with a shy guy it is always best to approach him when alone so he can build up his confidence in his ability to speak with you.|`|s5y9EliJaa	If u really wanna talk to this type of guy,, Let him show to you what''s his type... so that, you can be able to catch up with the things.... and also he can reveal himself the true him to you,,, i know ,,, most of girls... are  in awkwardness.... but you should overcome that in order to build your self confidence.... yes! first you must be very confident about yourself.... coz every guy wants to have or see a confident girl.... hope it helps!|`|TSYr4xKbaa	just start saying hi to him when you see him, than after a couple days of that say ask him whats up when you see him, or other questions about what he's doing and stuff, after that just try to keep talking to him and make normal conversation about school and stuff...|`|0jK4aGlQaa	everyones telling u to just say hi! and they are right :) trust me im a really shy guy, if a girl would come up to me and start chating it would probubly make my day :D (wow i sound like such a loser lol) its true though say hi -.-|`|KyShUk8kaa	By starting a conversation.|`|97sKOWQ0aa	Say hi.<br>  <br>  Whatsyoudoin.|`|nUDdh5Iqaa	say hi,i like u ;)

wseP86qSaa	The answer obviously is that alcohol strips away inhibitions. But you can't be doing this if you are both committed to other people. You both need to make up your minds one way or another. <br>  <br>  Do you even want him when you are sober? Maybe you are just shy, there's nothing wrong with that.

You are apparently not being very honest or fair with anyone, yourself included.

Just f*ck him already, since that's what you apparently want to do.  Or not.  Just stop using alcohol as your excuse.|`|AjPbtm7oaa	Alcohol causes us to loose our inhibitions.

xuDGrCSVaa	Casey is absolutely right.  Don't give up! Nice guys really do have better relationships than guys that are jerks.  You just need a girl that will appreciate your niceness.   Girls will get tired of the jerks eventually and come to find you.  <br>  I know this because I am married to a nice guy. He thought that he was never gonna get married.  But we have been happily married for 5 years now.  <br>  And for your question of when to talk to girls- have you tried going to a church? You can usually find some single girls there.  <br>  Hope this helps. Good luck!|`|kwYbe4n6aa	work out like crazy and focus on ur interests|`|oWJU0ky4aa	Just try to focus on your education right now.When your expecting it to happen(woman)they will find you.|`|RaB4hYp1aa	You're too young to give up so easily! and you're too young to be trying to get too serious too fast. "Nice guys" might get less girls, but the ones they do get are higher quality. Never lose the "nice guy" bit - all women could use a teddy bear. Just relax. You'll find someone in time. If not, give me a call. **wink, wink** :-)|`|FNi40XSaaa	I was in the same boat. I want to give you the best piece of advice you'll ever hear. It's going to sound cliche, but I promise you it's 100% true:<br>  <br>  Love yourself. <br>  <br>  Yes I know, easier said than done. However, if you stop worrying about the outside world for a while and truly focus on yourself, figuring out what makes you happy, indulging in hobbies, staying healthy and active, spoiling yourself a bit, making yourself the person you've always wanted to be... girls will take serious notice. Trust me on this one. Before you even realize it, you'll have the love of your life fall right into your lap, and what's more is that you'll be in a much better position to have a happy and healthy relationship if you are already happy with your life.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

eee94b83b66b6f03ce86b1d774b4766eaa	maybe is hard to say only if she can keep that way (hard)|`|AA11309767	how can you be sure it's no strings attached? what if she changes her mind or is trying to get you to date her? I don't believe that two people who are friends can honestly want to sleep with each other without any hang-ups. Not to mention, you don't know if she has an STD or is using contraception.|`|eb5c812ebaa5a79b93ab394da7af925caa	Your question does not give enough information.   Is he or she involved with someone, living w/someone, engaged, or married?  Even if none of these conditions exist, nothing good can come of it.  As much as either of you want to believe you can separate your feelings; you can't.  Unless you are a selfish self absorbed person that has no respect for yourself or anyone else.  In addition to being the kind of person that only does things unless you are going to benefit or to manipulate someone or something.  Which makes you no diffrent from a murderer who has no respect for human life.  Meaning you are also the kind of person that does not care who you hurt to obtain what you want. (even if it is a piece of gum)<br>  <br>  If you don't know if they are involved, you had better find out.  If one or both of you are involved with someone they you had better at the least have the deciency to break it off first. I am so sick of people saying "she is too jealous" or "I did not want to hurt him/her".  From personal experience the hurt, humiliation, anger, and feeling of being unwanted are 10 fold by flaunting the lying in your face.  Most likely it would not appear as if they are jealous, if they were not being lied too.  Hiding things, lying, and excluding the significant other means the actor does not trust thier partner, thus causing the appearance of jealousy.  If they did not exclude them, lie, keep secredts, and have others help cover it up then jealousy would not exist.  They would feel the need to behave that way if deep down inside they know what they are doing is wrong.     <br>  <br>  So, no it can not bee done.  One time turns into over and over which is when emotions begin to get involved.<br>  <br>  Your bf or gf is your best friend.|`|c85ec030efea1af8ff8b360f8e6e9d81aa	It is probably a mistake as sex is a kind of "glue" and it tends to bring all manner of unconsciously held expectations.<br>  <br>  But then again, sometimes it isn′t that easy to find a partner, and you just have to take what comes!|`|7609c1459f07cf8a619288aaf9e89773aa	Jammin,  you and Jason should sleep together and hold each other tight - coz you both scare easy!

fejv23shaa	There’s only one person who’s able to say what’s right or wrong - and that’s your friend. What I can say, though, is that his girlfriend isn’t very secure. Whether she has need for attention or dramatic flare, what she’s doing isn’t fair to your friend. He should tell her about it! Should they be considering a long-term, intimate relationship - honesty, problem solving and communication are paramount to success! If he’s not able to discuss this question with her - there’s a more serious problem than her insecurity. You’re a good friend to ask this question, well-done.|`|bgtNYOp5aa	She is very spoiled and has two kids? He shouldn't be living beyond his means.

E' difficile aiutare qualcuno attraverso delle righe anonime, ma tant'è, non ho altro mezzo per provarci. La sofferenza è l'altra parte di quella meravigliosa medaglia che è la sensibilità. Questa ci permette di godere per cose che per altri potrebbero non avere significato, ma ci fa soffrire laddove altri opporebbero freddezza e indifferenza. Forse vale la pena di soffrire se poi si può sorridere un po' di più. Nella vita ho provato tristezza, sofferenza, solitudine, il desiderio di gridare al mondo che non era giusto ciò che allora mi faceva del male e più provavo tutto questo, più mi sentivo triste e solo. Purtroppo il momento attuale lo devi vivere; è una sorta di condanna, ma ti dico questo: sii forte e vedrai che passerà. Non è un'affermazione banale, è esperienza la mia, vissuta sulla mia pelle. La vita è piena di cose tristi e crudeli, di una tristezza e crudeltà inenarrabili a parole; ci si rende conto delle loro dimensioni solo vivendole, ma lo stesso vale per le cose belle: Il sorriso di un bambino, una madre che allatta, lo sguardo della donna (nel tuo caso ovviamente, dell'uomo) che ami, un bel tramonto, un mare in tempesta, un cielo stellato. Persino quando piove, il profumo della terra bagnata. Le gioie della vita sono più numerose delle tristezze (e valgono molto di più), hanno un solo problema: fanno meno rumore. Coraggio, sforzati di sorridere pensando magari ad un bel momento vidssuto; vedrai che piano piano le cose cominceranno a cambiare. Vorrei poterti dire e anche fare di più, e magari ti ho solo rimbambito. Spero altri facciano meglio... perché vedrai che ti risponderanno in tanti.<br>  Ti mando un caro abbraccio e... un sorriso|`|256e9070970bed145bda1c69dd4a9684aa	pur topo nella vita ci sono anche dei momenti cosi brutti.ma li devi affrontare con tutte le tue forze.pensa a tutto ciò che è bello.coraggio!!!!|`|29e71b020083c8c982279887d941b29daa	Se ci dici perché sei depressa magari ti aiuteremo adeguatamente <br>  : )       Beh pensa comunque che essere tristi va bene, ma che se riesci ad accettare le situazioni che ti fanno star male senza più piangerti addosso, capirai anche cosa è giusto fare per uscirne.

AA11525727	If it has been 11 months I think you should decide if this is it or not. If it is then move there! The phone is not enough after a while. Ask if she wants more. If you love her then offer to do whatever will make things work.<br>  <br>  I know I have to keep myself busy to not miss my b/f, and I see him every weekend. Sometimes it is best to put him out of my mind to not go crazy.|`|7cfb00ccd9d93f94c4cf87d78eb53b9caa	okay first of all. long distance relationshiops suck. i know this from personal experience. there is alot of paranoia/insecurity/distrust/dishonesty/ involved. but this doesnt mean that it cant work. i had a long distance relationship with my current boyfriend for about 10 months. we ended up going out for about two years as of right now and counting. all i can say is try and not be so insecure about what she does and where she goes. just suggest to her that you care about her and you dont want to loose her so you would like to know how she is and what shes doing. insecurity in a guy is very unnatractive. who wants a guy that is worried about what you are doing every few seconds? just put a little trust in there and itll all work out for the best.|`|700652466e8b3dff1257183791d96f31aa	I would agree with you given the information that she values her time with her close friends more than she values her time on the phone with you.<br>  <br>  At this point it seems less like a G/F and more like a friend. You may want to go ahead and change the status. You have drifted apart. I don;t know the details of how the long term relationship came to be, but, I do know that they are very difficult to maintain, and BOTH party's have to work, or it will not happen. I was in a long-term relationship for 2 years, and we are now married, and have been for 2 years. Our relationship already had a great foundation, several years as friends, and a couple dating. Then she was out of state for a couple years. That was very tough, even as close as we were, we had many discussions. We made it, and she moved back close to me, and it's been strong ever since.<br>  <br>  My suggestion is if there is no light at the end of the tunnel (if she is not moving closer to you soon) then this relationship is already over, you just don't know it yet.

xfpJGBfwaa	If she's your friend, then she has to understand that she is hurting you.  And that she shouldn't be doing that.  It's not her fault or yours, but you two need time apart, as friends.  It has to be several months, during which time you can try to find yourself someone else who feels love for you too.  <br>  <br>  If you're truly friends, then you can survive this and be just friends again later.  But give it lots of time, and make sure you introduce your new gf to her and let them get to know each other.  Or there could be jealousies.<br>  <br>  UPDATE:  Sounds like you're talking yourself into being her friend.  You didn't make her mom die.  You didn't make her reject you.  And it's not all about you.  Believe me, she will hardly notice you're gone.  When my mom died, I was totally insensitive to everything for about a year and a half.  It's not about you.  It's about her.   Feeling pity for someone is no reason to hurt yourself.   If you don't respect yourself enough to get away from pain, then expect people to walk all over you.|`|xHI2QwOtaa	Tell her that you are going nuts being friends with someone who rejected you, and see what she says. If it is still killing you, explain to her that you two can't be friends. Or try to convince her to date you.... just to see if you'd make a good couple.|`|wck4MHREaa	Here we go again.<br>  <br>  Stop being friends with her, because it's only going to hurt you in the long run. You need time away so that you can clear your mind, and see that there are so many other girls out there that are a far better match for you than this girl ever was. <br>  <br>  There is a way to try to get her to come around...but it's not reliable, and it involves changing your whole attitude, style and persona. You can ask me over email if you like, but I ultimately suggest just forgetting about this girl and saving yourself from further harm.
wd7okk2daa	god, yes.|`|BjpeHOD2aa	yes|`|901eafc186c995cb8a7e6e8ce846775faa	No- but I have known many highly intelligent people who do - and they consistently alienate themselves from others.<br>  <br>  Example - I have a friend who used to be, well, pretty much a rocket scientist.  He loved to learn and communicate, but the problem was that he had no patience for anyone who was not as bright as he was....which was everyone!  He got so much momentum out of calling people out on their intellectual short-comings, that he couldn't see how diverse everyone was in the gifts that they are born with.  He couldn't see that he was especially blessed and, rather than being grateful for it, he used it to pass judgement on everyone else.<br>  <br>  Take care not to do this.  It's a lonely life.  Be patient with people.  I firmly believe that those who have been given much have the responsibility to give back with some grace, not reluctantly with contempt.

Sending her to spend a day or two cooling off sounds fine, but sending her off more long-term just delays having to deal with the real problems, and won't solve anything. I really do recommend counseling for both of you, if you feel like the problems you've been having are more than typical "teen angst."|`|MlCWsBcwaa	Sorry I haven't been there, but I think you did the right thing today sending her to grandmother's (as long as she actually did go there).  The bad behaviour sounds like a rebellious teenager.  Have you asked your doctor or someone that would know about the self-cutting?  You don't mention much about that, I wouldn't ignore it either way.  Maybe she is being bullied at school?  That might explain a bit about why she is so moody.  It doesn't sound like she is not getting enough attention from you or that you don't relate at all.  Maybe grandma can get her to open up a bit too, you never know.  Good luck.

Stick with just the sex sessions as your only contact or things tend to get messy.|`|176bc5a88a74677c32270fcac61549faaa	Friends with benefits is always tricky because one person always seems to have more feelings than the other. If this isn't the case the tricky part becomes what to do when you come across someone you may be interested in as a relationship. <br>  <br>  For all extensive purposes friends with benefits is really the same as a boyfriend girlfriend relationship except that you are not supposed to be upset if the other breaks a norm or rule you would usually have in such a relationship. The best thing to do is if the friends with benefits relationship is causing stress is to just end it as the idea behind this type of relationship is to not have the stress and worries of a regular romantic relationship. <br>  <br>  My advice would be to end it if you're stressing about it. Otherwise, talk to the guy about the ground rules, such as if it's ok to see other people at the same time and such, as these rules are important to have an understanding of.|`|JpG4zaA9aa	"Friends" with benefits means NO ATTACHMENTS<br>  If you find yourself becoming too emotional about this kind of situation with your friend then you should date others and keep him on the side until you figure it out.<br>  <br>  There are many rules when it comes to "understandings" and "friends with benefits" and "booty-calls".  Make sure you are clear with your partner and don't get caught up and be hurt because you and him are not on the same page.<br>  <br>  Rules:<br>  <br>  1.  YOU make the rules - very important.  IF HE DOESN'T WANT TO PLAY BY YOUR RULES- CUT HIM OFF RIGHT AWAY.<br>  2.  use your power<br>  3.  don't get hurt - THINK LIKE A MAN<br>  4.  DON'T HAVE SEX EVERYTIME YOU SEE HIM. Only have sex when you want to. Make him hold out.<br>  5.  ALWAYS use condoms<br>  6.  have more than one "friend" to call on. That way you don't get attached and you get variety.  Pay attention to the different personalities you are dealing with.<br>  7.  This is as important as #1 - DON'T SPEND YOUR MONEY ON HIM.  Unless it's a birthday or christmas present, keep your money in your pocket.  <br>  8. don't ask/answer alot of questions- "friends don't ask - they do"<br>  9.  Lastly, if you break any of your rules - game over, you lose!<br>  <br>  Not everyone can handle these type of situations and don't feel that you should settle for less than what you want.  <br>  <br>  If you run into difficulty - let me know.|`|TdmPULNJaa	ok. stop. read your question again...and all your detial to it. now i am asking you a question.

I have somewhat of the same problem. If he's a really close friend, then I think it's ok to do other things instead of just sex. It all depends on what you want. If you just want sex, and your friendship isn't that important than just do that. If your friendship is more important to you, then make sure that you separate your time, and spend "just friends" time together as well. I don't think you should call him, he should call you.It makes you look desperate.Of course, occasionally is ok. You did have a relationship with him, so that is a problem. If you had a relationship that means that you both probably had more intimate feelings for each other at some point than just sex. Being friends with benefits would be hard if you hadn't been doing this all along. Good luck with everything.

My opinion is that couples get married far too young and far too fast for all the wrong reasons, without knowing the responsibility that goes into being married.  Young couples have babies way too fast, thinking this will keep them together, but it often drives them apart.  Many married people are self-centered and want their spouses to provide something to them without giving back.  Spouses give themselves permission to cheat on a whim (just read some of the questions in this category!!!) and try to justify why it's not their fault.  The immaturity of so many married couples never ceases to amaze me.|`|FXZLNc1aaa	No, it's "so high" because MOST people(not all) jump into a marriage w/o really thinking it through. In other words, they jump into it too fast, and after so many years, they start to see what that person is REALLY like, and they dont like it. Then, they wonder why they got married to them in the first place. Or, a spouse cheats, or they just dont get along anymore.<br>  <br>  I hear some people make the claim that they"fall out of love " w/their spouse, but how can you? You loved them when you got married, why the change now? I also like "I dont know what I want", thats usually a good one too.<br>  <br>  Marriages(especially 1st marriages) usually end in divorce these days at an alarming rate.|`|wXaGIPSPaa	I think we go to school for 12 long years and when we graduate we have no idea what to do with our lives carreer wise, how to parent, or how to budget money,and most of all how to choose a mate and keep him/her.  Then on the other hand the media portrays marriage as being constantly passionate and perfect.  This romantic illusion makes our expectations high and so people feel alienated and let down thinking they are missing out. We dont find out the answers to all these questions until years later!|`|MpewkyElaa	First they are fake then they hook then they cry victim then they leave. So lame. I agree. . .|`|fswPWFswaa	i think it's that and the fact that marriage isn't seen as sacred anymore. marriage should important to those involved, instead things like careers and petty arguments stand in the way. people are too selfish these days and aren't willing to take commitments seriously, and part of it is because all they have to do to get out of the mess is get a divorce, instead of stepping up and taking responsibility for their commitment. i don't believe people fall out of love, they just choose to not make it work when things get too hard. I have known couples who decide to not get a divorce and work through their problems and come out more in love then ever. so i don't buy that falling out of love bull. people are selfish and quitters and marriage isn't seen as sacred as it should be looked at. that's my thoughts :)|`|dNj1RjWHaa	no, they are liers. then they run!

AA10065812	???????<br>  Because if it's inconvenient, or infringes on their private lives, they ignore it.  <br>  <br>  Ye, Christ was perfect, but the was his human form, not his mental bearing.  He had free will and could have sinned, but he CHOSE not to, like when Satan offered him the power over all the nations.  He had free will to make a conscious choice.  To be other mean he made no sacrifice for us, because he had no choice.<br>  <br>  Adam and Eve were also perfect human beings, yet they chose to bring sin into the world.<br>  <br>  Today's Christians CHOSE to commit WILLFUL SIN because they believe that because of the Sacrifice of the Lamb of God, they will be forgiven of their sins, but this only shows how truly lacking their knowledge is of the Bible.<br>  <br>  Do you know why Christ was called the Lamb of God?  Because his sacrifice was the fulfillment of the Covenant of the Sacrificial Lamb.<br>  <br>  For nearly 2000 years prior to his sacrifice, the sins of Israel was forgiven through the annual sacrifice of a Lamb in the Temple.  A lamb's throat was slit, allowing for its soul to pour out into a bowl, later to be taken outside the Temple and poured out upon the ground.  This is why today in Israel, if a person dies, regardless of the cause, and their blood is spilled, they don't just clean it up, Rabbis remove the blood for burial.  They chip up walls, floors, streets, and whatever it takes to remove any blood that absorbed into anything.  They are collecting the person's soul.<br>  <br>  After the lamb is dead, the flesh is destroyed by fire, than the ashes had to be present to God, in this case, by taking the ashes intro the Most Holy. This is a place where only the High Priest could even touch, let alone enter.  Anyone else died even touching the curtain.  Upon the death of the Lamb of God, the ashes were present to him by the angels.<br>  <br>  When Israel was wandering, the Temple was mobile, carried on only the backs of the High Priests. Like Christians today, they sought the Promise.  In their case, it was the Promised Land, but when they finally arrived, Moses was not allowed to enter, because of just one sin.  A sin that apparently couldn't be forgiven by the Sacrifice of the Lamb.<br>  <br>  What was the Sin?  He did not give thanks and Praise to Jehovah when he called forth the water from the stone.  They got their water, but he had grown short tempered with them and forgot to say the right words.<br>  <br>  So, why was this one simple act so bad?  Perhaps because he thought that with the Sacrifice of the Lamb for the forgiveness of sins, AND because of all the good he had done, that one little thing wouldn't count.  He may have made an assumption of knowing what was in the heart and mind of God.<br>  <br>  Today's Christians should take note of Moses.  <br>  <br>  Can any of them say they are more deserving of the Promise than he was?  <br>  <br>  Are they assuming to know the heart and mind of God as to whether a willful sin will count against them?  <br>  <br>  Is immorality a less sin than Moses forgetting to say the wrong words?|`|pzLDXL6gaa	Because waiting for marriage is a pretty silly idea and despite most Christians having problems with imaginary friends, a lot of them aren't as silly as they pretend.<br>  <br>  Harriet|`|NBDLUOkiaa	We are still human and sinners and are prone to making mistakes.

These would be the ones with church membership that attend church on Sunday and live like the devil the rest of the week. It's called having "churchianity" and not Christianity. These groups of churches never really follow the true word of God from the Bible and usually have many un-biblical "extras" in their churches. These church groups would be catholics, mormons, scientology, and churches like that. Yes, these groups will have sex before marriage because they are not born again as it is written.<br>  <br>  Now you have your born again Christians. These people are true followers of Christ and will save sex for marriage. These people are not worldly and tend to act and even dress different as to be modest and obedient to the Lord.

They are not Christians. It took me my whole life to finally figure it out. I am glad I got witnessed to by real Christians and left the catholic religion. It is a sure ticket to hell. Please read that website I gave you with an open mind. I am trying to tell you the truth just as it was told to me. <br>  <br>  Also as it is written in the Bible that to lust upon a man, you have already committed adultery in your heart. This means just kissing too. Please don't take my word for it, read it in your Bible!|`|3264b09af40e6311a70d315c1f4ed8e3aa	Why not?|`|wRHhpanmaa	okay congrats on being catholic, do you think that stops most catholic people from sleeping around before marriage? I think not.<br>  <br>  Also why does it matter? if someone wants to sleep around before they get married or not? it should be no one's business but their own. <br>  <br>  and last but not least, not all christians are like that. The bible does say to save yourself until marriage, but it also says god forgives as well. Some people do make mistakes.|`|zAfKvhW4aa	But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart. (Matthew 5:28) <br>  <br>  Apparently you are not pious yourself since you mentioned you kissed. <br>  <br>  It is difficult to have self control once ANY kind of intimacy has started that's why it is IMPIOUS for any of it to occur in the first place.|`|9UQlhzitaa	Jess<br>  <br>  no piousness here I screw it up everyday,and only by grace do I get another chance to try not this day.<br>  <br>  Lust is not easy to overcome.In my early years it got a hold of me and would not let go for about 11 years out of my life it was a constant fight but I never stop trying and even now I have found it still can get the better of me if I let my guard down for a minute.Look at all the things around us that promote sex,from what people wear to adds on anything sex sells so it is pushed at us all day long.<br>  <br>  so I don't know if that answer your question but this is me so good luck to you|`|FZLiRKIjaa	Modern Christianity is a self-serve type religion.

MALlDmaPaa	Why dont you just go over there. There are ways. Get a ride? Maybe the bus? Anything. IF you really want this guy you need to fight for it =] Do what you can for him and he will return the favor. And it will be fantastic =]|`|5ZK9VGPCaa	Even though some people might say that there is something in the fact that he "keeps going back to her", I do think that she means nothing to him. He is being a guy - and just wanting a girl there so he has someone to hook up with when there's no one else. Sadly, I've been this girl (the rebound one) - although I only found out afterwards and when I did I cut off all contact and have never and will never speak to him again. The best advice I can give you is to find out how the girl feels about him, because if she really likes him and he is using her as his "insurance" this is a good indicator of the type of person he is (i.e. not a good one!) and how he will treat you (similarly!). <br>  <br>  About you and him, just wait a bit, try and meet up with him, give it a chance for something to develop again between you guys.. and then ask what's going on and maybe ask about her. It depends whether you feel like you want to slowly get to know him, in which case you can just let it go for a while and then when it starts getting serious make certain he isn't with her. Or if you feel like you are being cheated/don't even want to start dating a guy when there's another girl on the same (most people are like this!) then bring up the subject already. <br>  <br>  I definately think he likes you based on how you have said he acts..|`|PRjvY6Vgaa	Eh, you should probably just let him go. If he's going to keep rebounding to this other girl, he must like her in some way and might even still keep seeing her even if you and him have a relationship. I hope this helps.|`|xHI2QwOtaa	Just ask him straight up if he likes you or her. It is pretty simple. Just say: Hey, I was wondering, do you like me or ______ ?<br>  That is all I can think of. If he doesn't like you, then just kinda forget about him, he wasn't for you, someone else is. If he says you, then tell him you want him to be your boyfriend. I hope I helped you!|`|pOEH4HLuaa	he likes you, hes just unsure.<br>  and since this is school...realationships never alast at different schoools|`|GTZFpbfPaa	i am not entirely sure what your question is. i think you should just find a bf somewhere closer to home. and plan B break them up and date him yourself!|`|kwYbe4n6aa	if u know he like u... wth r u posting question here for... call him now and ask him to come over ur place|`|0Ee8r5KRaa	i think he liked you so  much that he needed something to help him forget about the pain of you leaving, so that's why he's dating this chick again. he oviously still likes you if he's being flirty on text and get all silly when he hears you name... tell him you wanna try to make it work out|`|L49hkJzAaa	He does still like you, but he just wants to be able to see you more often then you will be able to sse him. He is dating that other girl because he is afraid of feeling alone. I can't help you get together with him, but i can explain why he is dating the other girl.|`|ayM5TlcXaa	find your rebound lets see how he likes it. but really find sumone else. u'll find out that in the world there are a lot of people that luk alike and have a few differences, so find his better double!|`|AwXl1TZDaa	dont be jealous. take care of your love. if he very very love you he stay on his love and choice you only. he have two face may be or he dont know what does he want really. help to him.|`|RStOQvSWaa	just talk to him alot and get to know him. but since he has a GF already try not to flirt to much with him. just ask him quesitons that you would like to know and go from there|`|AA11294940	Are you serious, as you get older and actually hit maturity your be like wow i wasted all this time and energy wondering what other people are doing and thinking|`|xxQwv1nSaa	Go get yours.|`|eTm9uLqyaa	Tell him what you just said to me..|`|6cCIZbuJaa	Keep doing what you're doing. Talk to him like a friend. If he gets to be smart enough, he'll go to you. Or if they break up, you can be there for him and blah blah blah, and he'll realize you're better.|`|VdcoHfN1aa	maybe he doesnt wanna hurt the rebound girl..tell him straight up u really really like him and ask him if he wants to go out. that's all u really can do.|`|5zw5I6xTaa	well ask him why is he going back out with her because if he really like you then he wouldn't be going out with her so stop wasting time an tell him you like him|`|87dGB3mEaa	I hate to be the pessimist, but I have a feeling this rebound ex of his would be a problem if you ever tried to have a serious relationship with him.  If all it took for him to run back to her was to hear that you moved 40 minutes away, imagine what would happen after your first big argument (and the arguments WILL happen, it's just life).  I'm sure you can find somebody who you'd like as well without the baggage...but then again, if this is "love at first sight", all logic and reasoning is out the window.<br>  <br>  Good luck.
t7S4vU7Qaa	they are your "2nd cousins by marriage." <br>  i know that that term sounds long and silly, but that really is the correct term.<br>  when you start counting connections by marriage, you don't count the marriage as another degree therefore:<br>  you - cousins = 1st degree<br>  cousins - marriage = does not count<br>  marriage - cousins(your uncle) = 2nd degree<br>  <br>  but you still need to add "by marriage" to make it clear that it is not by blood. jsut in case you may want to amrry any of them. :D<br>  <br>  Hope it helps

AA12210920	When he stares uncontrollably in her eyes, strokes her hair, say small little nothings in her ear, tells her how beautiful she is, how much he likes/loves her, buys her little gifts, that kind of thing. You will be able to tell if he is genuine by his body-language and how he acts around you when he introduces you to his family and friends.|`|912bb3664fcc7a940a9f27c4760ca8baaa	lol...well firstoff..you could kind of tell if your guy is just flirting w/ you or a guy who really wants to be in a relationship with you. when a guy is flirting, he would talk w/ other girls the way he talks to you. sometimes though, its hard to see for some people because they're so engrossed in the situation, and it could be that they're falling for that one guy instead of vice versa.<br>  <br>  ok. so, the way to tell if a guy really likes you, is the way he talks to you. if a guy tells all of his guy friends to shut up just so he could hear you speak, that's definately a yes. also, there's a way guys look at girls if they are in love. it is way different than from when a guy flirts because he has that special gleam in his eyes. and when a guy flirts, he just looks the same way he would when talking to other people..<br>  <br>  if your guy truly loves you, then he'll ask you aside from everyone else just to see what's wrong...when it just so happens that its only "that time of the month." he would speak to you seriously when it comes to little things that tick people off.<br>   so far..that's all i've got..sorry!

The reason I ask is because if you think about it, people get along the best with friends & have the most fun with friends, so if the physical attraction was there between two friends, it would be easy to get passed all the bull since they know each other & already love & care about each other. (and then say), i think i should be a dating doctor & give people logical advice to find their perfect mates. (and then you laugh) and then ask him, what do you think?<br>  <br>  It's a good way to get his answer out of him without embarrassing your self with rejection. Anyway if he's your best friend, he shouldn't change the way he is towards you and if he does, u don't deserve friends like that, so don't be intimidated.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  ~Biker*Jerry~|`|GwzwAC38aa	ok so ya ive been in the same situation as you but i was the guy liking the girl. Umm same thing i got rejected a couple of times but i still was not able to get over her. She kept leading me on without realizing it which may be happening to you. to give you the raw hard truth try to find someone else to crush because it will help you move on from him easier. if he did want to start a relationship with you he would have said yes the first couple times. He probably treasures his friendship with you too much and doesnt wanna give it up. No matter how perfect you think he is now you will find plenty of things you dont like after you get over him. hope that helps :)|`|oDsFSXhhaa	Realistically if he liked you, he could be <br>  A) Playing hard to get<br>  B) Afraid<br>  <br>  But if he is sending you mixed signals then that leads me to think he doesn't know what he wants. This is common for most men young and old. What you need to do is tell him: " you are sending mixed signals. I don't know what to think." If he still says he doesn't want to be with you, then move on and DO NOT GO LIVE WITH HIM!|`|MkrQvR7saa	I am in almost the same position here,<br>  But look.. im so sorry to have to tell you what you need to hear,<br>  But if he has turned you down.. he obviously doesn't like you.<br>  But, just be thankful you have that friendship.<br>  Remember- There are other fish in the sea!|`|Ih6Bgggsaa	please tell me that you have watched "he is just not that into you!"<br>  <br>  i dont want to be rude but he has turned you down 3 times... it sounds like he just wants to be friends. so accepted it and move on!|`|YNOySbxFaa	Let him go. bestfriends are there until you loose their phone number :P boyfriends come and go..<br>  i know from expirience.  lets just say, i dated my bff and i broke up with him 2 days later.<br>  Do not date friends [:|`|VdcoHfN1aa	well, did u make sure that he knew what ur friend told him wasnt true? it is true that he probably doesnt want ur friendship to be lost or lose the natural friend feeling between you guys that u have. i'd give him time, just to get his head straight..and if u get too impatient ask him straight up what he's thinking if he doesnt say anything about ur relationship. then if he says he likes you, tell him that no matter what happens, u want to stay friends if it doesnt work out. but if he doesnt, try as hard as you can to move on and find someone else new and try to act like normal friends when you hear your answer from him if he declines again. that way he wont feel like he hurt u bad and like he wrecked ur friendship. he will probably follow ur lead of acting like friends and will act normal. & the california thing..well it could mean he likes u and is trying to give u a signal, or he just really likes u as a friend and wants to stay in close quarters with u..but living together? be kinda weird for a boy and girl Friend to me..
GrCj35muaa	well be honest. your mom should be glad that you've waited to get this far. most kids your age are having sex on the first date. Tell her you haven't done it and you were curious. This type of thing will best be talked about honestly. You can tell her it's just as awkward for you and your gf as it is for her if not worse. I think your gf has the sh*t end of the stick though. I'd also ask your mom not to think less of her. You can't just be like "opps, my face fell on her vag," or tell her you were looking for something. she knows what you were doing so just be honest.|`|9VOdvhvqaa	nothing your a** is screwed. theres only one thing you can LIE UR A.S.S OFF!!!
db4310b357e8b8155cfe1bd956cf7660aa	Society no longer looks at divorce as a failure anymore.<br>  Marriage is longer seen as a union between two people. <br>  It is just another way to live more cost effective.<br>  My grand parents were married when my grand-dad was 16 and granny was 12. He lived to be 96 years old. Granny died 6 months after he did. They were still married to each other when they died. Had 7 kids. A LOT of arguments over the years, they lived in a time when the phrase "till death till you part" meant something. Like working through the adversities of every day living. <br>  I. myself, found it was easier to fly than fight. A decision that sometimes I regret.<br>  On the other hand, I would not have found the WONDERFUL wife that I am married to now if I hadn't have flown the coop.<br>  I was WAY to immature to get married the first time.<br>  The second time, I wasn't. <br>  The divorce forced me to grow up and grow up PDQ<br>  Those vows are VERY important to my wife and I.<br>  This world has and is going thru changes.<br>  And it is those very changes that shape the way we live.<br>  I'm not saying that change is bad, however, not all changes are good either.|`|iPFUJXvpaa	a marriage is 50/50,both have to help each other and understand each other threw the good time's and bad time's,it seems that most of the time ,one is giving more than the other ,without caring what it is doing to him/her.....they forget their partners in LIFE ,"one makes the other'.|`|13d4bd226d0dce7fe19e7693dc8cfed9aa	stupidty thats why|`|PD1fZV7Aaa	I AGREE, I guess VOWS mean nothing anymore.|`|FXZLNc1aaa	Because, often times "fighting", usually ends up meaning "Prolonging the inevitable". You go t a marriage counselor, and they try to work with you, or you get advice from other married couples. Usually, all this does is prolong a divorce, as you end up arguing/divorcing later on about the same stuff you did before.<br>  <br>  Also, it's a they jumped into the marriage thing too fast. They dont realize what's at stake when they marry. They have to be willing to spend the rest of their lives w/this person, and the mere thought of that alone, scares alot of people. For some, it's too much. Eventually, you get tired of that person, and you want to make a change. No one is happy all the time, especially in a marriage, and most certainly, YES< people change. Both spouses tend to get lazy, and happy in their situations, and then, they dont want to leave, and they're unhappy too.|`|VIKXnXuTaa	Because they were brought up with no morals, no sense of commitment, are selfish and have no skills at communicating fairly.<br>  <br>  Divorce is the ultimate wound as the one you entrusted yourself to discarded you.  The one you invested in gave you the highest insult by rejecting you.<br>  <br>  What they should realize is the truly selfish thing to do is to find out how to make a marriage work, because that is where true contentment is found, ask any lost and lonely single person who thought the grass was greener on the other side.|`|dNj1RjWHaa	society allows it, its easier, not sure but you are right. we all make mistakes at some point in our lives, some make them when getting married, and when there is something fundamentally left out at the beginning of the marriage or an opinion changes during the marriage, people feel threatened and tend to run away. its easier than fixing the problem.|`|sC1laTphaa	sometimes divorce is the only answer. my dad cheated on my mom, and now they're divorced, they've been separated for years, and both my 16 year old brother and i (i'm 14 my dad left when i was very small then came back then left again he's been doing that since probably before my brother was born) are both fine with it some times it's better to be divorced than to stay married. <br>    although i do agree that getting divorced for tiny reasons is really stupid. i don't know what's up with that. if it's a small reason i think that they should go to marriage counseling.|`|xUsUNGYyaa	blasse is right but let me add this to it.They think the looks and everythings going to last when obviously its not unless you got good insurance.|`|zhDVzdrGaa	humans were not meant to be monogamous.|`|pzLDXL6gaa	Personally I'd rather they got a divorce due to fatness or whatever than not get a divorce and the relationship just keeps falling apart and they are unhappy for years until one of them finally cheats. That's usually what happens.<br>  <br>  I agree it would be lovely if everybody could work on their relationship and have commitment and try counselling but in the absence of that, I think it is good they have the option of divorce.<br>  <br>  Harriet|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	Things are never as simple as they seem. But I hear what you're saying, we have a 'throw away' society. <br>  <br>  Things have value because they are useful, when they are no longer useful, we throw them away. Like a beat up car, or broken TV. The problem is that we have started using that line of reasoning in our relationships. If he or she is no good, throw them away and go buy a new one.
2eztcCO0aa	LOL.  I want to answer that assistants should be discouraged from committing suicide.<br>  <br>  People who are suffering and want to end their suffering through suicide should be allowed to do it and even get help when necessary.<br>  <br>  The problem comes in knowing when a person has a real need to end their suffering or just depressed and wanting to die.  Knowing how much pain it causes the family and friends for someone to kill themselves makes it hard to say it's okay to help someone die.  How do you know for sure that something won't come along that will help them or that they might not have found a reason to go on living?  Who are we to say that their reasons aren't good enough?  Should a man who lost his whole family in a car accident be allowed to kill himself because life without them is just too hard?  How do you allow this and still tell a teenager who just broke up with his girlfriend that he can't kill himself?<br>  <br>  It's a tricky thing.  You can't just put a checklist together and develop some sort of criteria for when suicide is justified.  You either have to ban it for everyone, knowing that some people will suffer needlessly or allow it for everyone, knowing that some people will kill themselves when they could have been helped.<br>  <br>  Unplugging a machine when it's been determined that the person's brain is too damaged for them ever to wake up so that they're essentially dead or simply living in a vegetative state they can never wake from is not the same thing.  There comes a time when you can no longer say that the person still exists, just the body is being kept alive.  It's neither assisted suicide nor murder in that case.<br>  <br>  Dr. Kevorkian did something illegal.  That's not to say that he necessarily did something wrong.  But sometimes you have to do the right thing and suffer the consequences of breaking the law to do it.  Still, he may have been wrong.  There's not way to say for certain because we haven't figured out yet how to determine if a suicide is justified.<br>  <br>  Maybe there should be a hearing for people who want to kill themselves for any reason.  They could call witnesses to say they are just suffering needlessly, and anyone who wants to prevent their suicide could also call witnesses and make a case for denying them.  If no one comes forward or if they can't make their case, then the person can be allowed to die if they want, even if they're just depressed.  Without a hearing and ruling by a court, suicide would always be illegal, but assisted suicide would be legal.|`|NXLjk0uvaa	no one deserves to suffer. if they are in pain, and have no chance, cut the cord. my grandfather recently died. he had no chance of ever being the way he use to be. if he lived he would have been a vegetable. with no use of his body, mouth, brain, all that. i think we made the right choice. no one deserves to live in pain?|`|igvu3ifUaa	assisted suicide is when an action is taken to stop life by medical personal. unplugging the machine is simply not treating. the person is still dying of natural causes.

Just talk to them nicely and have a conversation. Usually that builds up confidence. Just say ANYTHING, but don't make it seem like you're trying hard to sound cool.

V9VJIw1Uaa	its a tough situation. go to your wife and talk to her, tell her all those things what you have said here, if she refuses to understand, send her letter. cut down the blaming part here.<br>  show that you love her and you are willing to work on your marriage, go to her and say sorry to hurt her feelings. try to convince her about the happy days of your marriage. <br>  love her more. show her your love more. try to bridge the communication gap. there is always different choice for two people but we try to go for others choices whom we love. <br>  make her feel comfortable with you. she will surely understand you.<br>  she loves you. even she is not happy either in this situation.<br>  go to her and show you care.|`|4cc625c81315e3cc57858f7de7250b2aaa	While I don't understand everything about your culture or your marriage traditions, some things might transcend culture.  It sounds like your wife might be blaming everyone else so she doesn't have to take any responsibility for the marital problems.  That's sad, because it sounds like your parents were wonderful to her and her family.  If your marriage ends, your wife will lose the love of your entire family.  Very sad she is doing that to herself.  Best wishes to you.|`|z5hrgF45aa	Ravi as u can accept the problem was from the two that is a good  sign. i think plan to meet ur wife, express ur love to her. by the way shopping is women's right, u can' take that away from her lol. infact set a budget for ur wife expenses that u give her monthly. her money she can spend as she wishes. u enjoy reading share ur experience with her. make sure u set time for each other everyday it might be an hour of just talking about ur relationship without involving any other family members. this will work only if u two work towards it. goodluck|`|wXaGIPSPaa	You did not say how long you have been married or what your ages are.  <br>  Does it really matter if it is right or wrong that she scolded your family?

Did you provide for her? were you employed? <br>  Will your wife go to marriage counseling with you?|`|13d4bd226d0dce7fe19e7693dc8cfed9aa	yeah what ever you say|`|AA11359690	I think it is wrong.  She should not scold you.  My in laws made mistakes and they never regret them and they tried to ruin my marriage and even after 2 years I scold them.  I never said anything in front of them but in front of my husband.  He never listens and does not accept that they were unjust.  Till this day he does not accept.  I think he does not love me and therefore he acts like this.  He wants to hide problems.  In your case u accepted and all that.  I think you should gather her parents and yours and put this matter in front of them in precence of your wife.  But first talk to her because these problems do not go away.  Grudges are bad.  I have them upto this day.|`|uF59Rwtgaa	I do not think it is right of her to scold your family. If they are not interfering with anything and are not causing problems then she has no right to do that. Even if they were causing problems she should not scold them but bring it up to you in a calm manner and you two should discuss what would be the best course of action.|`|i4ADduVKaa	Highly sick,the only remedy ,not to give weight on this issue,dont argue whenever this topic comes in both of you.It is better to allow to settle on itself because repenting on past will not take you any where.My advice enjoy every moment of life by not indulging on this or any topic of taking u&ur spouse any where.Do some concrete work on ur relationship,by giving ur partner romantic moments,pleasurable moments,give her company ,try she may not feel lonely.go for shopping /gift/movie etc.time is a very big factor with time it gets resolved,DONT ARGUE ON ANY ISSUE,today is womans day so keep her warm by ur better understanding her,instead cusing

GrCj35muaa	I think you should leave well enough alone. You have nothing to be jealous of as you are the one he is marrying and he doesn't contact her. It doesn't seem worth the fight to me. I suggest wait until after the wedding. Once you say your "I do's" she may get the hint and leave him alone. If she doesn't and it still really bothers you, talk to him calmly about it. However, he can't really help who is sending him messages without changing his contact information which is deffinately over the top just to stop a few messages a year. You have nothing to worry about so don't worry about it.|`|c9sXhnKpaa	The best thing to do is every time he gets a message from her, ask him if you can have a look, if he lets you see then you know he has nothing to hide, but if he doesn't then he`s hiding something and either way you will know where his loyalty lies, ok?  Let me know what happens, I know how it feels to be pestered by a partners ex.|`|U6UUX6aWaa	i think that you should tell him what your feeling and i think that you are correct in asking her to stop contacting him. if you didnt, that would most likely create problems later, unless they are just friends, which is highly unlikely and she just probably wants to be in his life.

AA11286455	Time.  Time.  Time.  <br>  <br>  Usually, it's guys who absolutely cannot, and are not capable of being "just friends".  It's refreshing to hear this from a guy.  <br>  <br>  Don't push it, don't force it, don't rush it--her, yourself, the friendship.  Send her an e-mail or a card from time to time to check in with her, say you hope she's doing well, and just generally let her know you're thinking of her.  <br>  <br>  If you're willing to keep the lines of communication open, things will probably work out.  But you, still, have to give it time.  <br>  <br>  It's no guarantee that you two will return to a friendship or even the closeness as friends you once had.  You still have to be patient and give it all time.  <br>  <br>  If the friendship is fully restored, it will be one of the best and most meaningful friendship you will ever have had.

Just because you are the future mother of his son does not mean you are required to keep in contact with him personally, there are mediators for that sort of thing. He dragged your name through the mud and lied about your son because he is terrified of being a father. He doesn't want to be a failure so he'd rather make you look like one instead. He is also regretting the break-up most likely, subconsciously realizing that this is going to negatively impact the rest of his life. If he is truly willing to work on your problems, I'd get him to go to family counseling, there are free services in most metropolitan areas. However, you'll have to ask yourself, do you want to give him a second chance after how badly he's disrespected you and your child?|`|37M3dkkRaa	maybe he's just not comfortable with having a child on the way. it's really hard on guys, too. my bf didn't really straighten up until the end of my pregnancy and now that my daughter is here, he's been so great. i couldn't ask for him to be a better father, i just don't think its possible. maybe you should invite him over to talk about things or something? point out everything he does that you don't think is right and tell him it's hard enough to take care of yourself, much less someone else and that it would be really nice if he'd be there to help you. if he wants a DNA test, let him pay for it. no point in you wasting your money if you're sure the baby is his.|`|b26Dp8LKaa	Why does he still call?  Because he can. And because you listen. I don't want to sound harsh but it's just that simple. I know because I lived it for 2 years with my ex husband.  (& longer)<br>  <br>  While we were married he had an affair with another (also married) woman, but kept going back & forth between us. He couldn't decide.  Even after I broke it off with him & they married (a few years later), he continued to give me gifts, call to say "Happy Birthday" or "Happy old Anniversary", "I still love you"....blah blah blah. I still loved him & it tore me up for a long time.<br>  <br>  Back to you:when he "needs" understanding, he comes to you because you allow him to.  You're real question should be why do you allow this to continue?  You cannot change him regardless of whether or not you figure out his motivations. Nor can you change him hard as you may want to or try to.  It's a waste of your time, energy and soul. What he wants from you is exactly what he's getting from you. He may not know what he wants, but neither do you. <br>  <br>  What do YOU want?  Why do YOU allow this to go on?   Rather than "finding someone else", right now, find YOURSELF.  Find your answers about what you want. Then you can begin to make choices to get there.  It's not easy, I know. It's painful when you still love someone to walk away. But what's going on between you two is not "loving" behavior. <br>  <br>  Children learn what they live. Do you want to teach your son that this is what a loving relationship is? <br>  <br>  Wish I could put it in just the right words.  And I'm wishing you all the best. Take care of yourself!
wRHhpanmaa	lol I had (in my opinion) the perfect wedding....<br>  <br>  I walked down the aisle to the star wars song...(darth vader march) I had darth vader walk me down the aisle (star wars fan club) and two storm troopers as groomsmen.<br>  <br>  since my theme was black and white, I had black and white cupcakes,(little star wars figurines on them) and I wore white dress, white veil, black hair with white streaks, black combat boots, and had a black and white rose bouquet.<br>  <br>  My cake was the corpse bride, and my husbands cake was a a bride pulling the groom away from a little toy computer on a barbie desk<br>  <br>  the priest said I now pronounce you man and wife, you may now kiss the bride....  (at which time my maid of honor pulled breath spray from between her boobs in her dress and sprayed some in my mouth) May the force always be with you both<br>  <br>  we had little dancing R2D2's and star wars dvd's and tim burton movies as wedding take home gifts. we watched the star wars movies too. <br>  <br>  it was just romantic.. considering my husband was a star wars nerd, and it was different..... I loved it.<br>  <br>  just take into consideration what you want and what he wants, because it is his day too. and do something unique....<br>  <br>  it is supposed to be one of the best days of your life. so make it that way.|`|vyL7yEleaa	bagpipes and a horse drawn carriage pulled by a beautiful black friesen stallion and i would beg and plead with queen Elizabeth to let me use Buckingham palace XD. long shot i know..

It is possible that it could help because sex builds intamacy, but if you have that bad feeling in your gut(we all do sometimes) your best bet is to listen to it.

AA11958375	That's lovely.  Get her a scarf in her favourite colour or one that will go with her favourite outfits.<br>  <br>  No. 5 is quite a mature scent mostly aimed at ladies in their early 30's and upwards (Think Nicole Kidman in the adverts!), maybe get a 'younger' one like Coco Mademoiselle (the one Kiera Knightly advertises) as it is a fresher and lighter scent but still classic.|`|37M3dkkRaa	why does she need a scarf? in one or two months it will be getting warm. why don't you get her jewelry or shoes or something...even a purse would be cool. perfume could be nice, but it may also make her feel like you think she stinks or something, you never know. everyone thinks about things different.|`|ZYyzCeoeaa	Chanel no 5. - Excellent!<br>  Scarf should be changed for a pair of ear rings. That does seem a bit grannyish.|`|NXLjk0uvaa	be with her, love her. i would get her roses, chocolates, pamper her, take her out to a nice restaurant?|`|sLDqymHzaa	Well what were you planning to do that sounds "over the top"?<br>  People tend to think I'm a little over the top with my girlfriend, but if that's what people tell you, then trust me: she'll probably love it. I think you should stick with your original plan. It's what YOU came up with, so I'm sure it'll be great.<br>  If you really are THAT worried about it being over the top, I certainly wouldn't get that for a one year anniversary. I'd go for something shiny (jewelry). I got my girlfriend a sterling silver claddagh ring with her birth stone in it (which just so happened to be cubic zirconia, so that worked well). It's also nice if you try to get her something that you know she can wear with something else she really likes. For example, the ring I got her matched the necklace I had gotten her for Christmas so she could wear them both together. You can try matching with clothes or a favorite bag, as well. If she's an avid shopper, take her out for an all day, expenses paid shopping spree. Let her get a few nice things for herself. She'll appreciate it, and you won't need to worry about what you get her because she'll pick it out. Get involved in the shopping and give her your opinion on outfits and the like. She'll have a great day and really appreciate it. If she's considerate, she won't run you to the poor house, either. I'm not at all made of cash, but I managed to make this one work.|`|qjaWgov8aa	That's really nice, but Hermes and Chanel are older women's brands. If you want to give her a scarf and perfume try:<br>  <br>  Scarf:<br>  Pucci<br>  Juicy Couture<br>  Burberry<br>  pretty much anything with a pretty print, bright color, or fun shapes. Hermes is okay, but some colors and prints are old-ladyish<br>  <br>  Perfume:<br>  Britney Spears (Curious smells amazing)<br>  Juicy<br>  Prada<br>  Burberry<br>  Calvin Klein<br>  Daisy by Marc Jacobs*most teen girls love this<br>  <br>  Heads up: You might want to ask one of her friends what perfume she already has just in case she already has it. Also ask them if she wants it.<br>  Also, it would be cute if when wrapping the gift, only get one box, then wrap the perfume in the scarf really nicely.<br>  <br>  Plus, it sounds like you haven't really thought about how to give it to her. You should take her out to dinner or to a place that has special meaning to both of you. As a teenage girl, I think it would be cool if you wrapped them in a really small box, then put it in a bigger one, then put those two boxes in a bigger box, and so on. So when she's trying to open it she'll be very curious as to what the surprise is.|`|bItFniLxaa	I think that those are actually very good ideas. Personally, I wold prefer a burberry scarf, but i think the Chanel is a classic. Don't worry about other people, and no matter what it truly is the thought that counts. In addition, these are expensvie items that your gf will definitely be very appreciative of. Good luck & happy anniversary!|`|SNTLxVyVaa	get her some nice jewellery like a pendant or something or maybe a pair of pendants for the both of you with each others name in|`|0Sro08acaa	Great Odin's raven, get her Sex Panther by Odeon it's made from bits of real Panther it has a formidable scent, stings the nostrils.

She does like this man a lot but does not want to give him false hopes because she herselff does not know yet what she wants in life and fines this man to be a darling loving man ... with lots in common with her but she also warned him he will not be happy in her life style .. she would never hurt him and only wishes him happines in what ever he does in his life ...|`|PfXpTwBwaa	YOU totally have to read the book THE CHOICE By Nicholas Sparks <br>  your story is the same as that one! but i thing you guys can be friends and maybe if she likes you back she will leave her uncommitted boyfriend <br>  Good Luck|`|Tl2wap1Naa	Yeah what the guy above me said...|`|XGgPhaDbaa	She's telling you that she already has a boyfriend and doesn't want another one - mainly you.<br>  I have a lot of friends that I can talk to about everything but I don't love them.|`|ge5x9NHxaa	Don't do something if another person do to you will not be pleasing.

Sometimes we are tempted by others because its something new and exciting, but those are urges that must be controlled.  You need to respect her as a person, her feelings for this other man, her relationship, and even the other man.  You can't help who you love, but you've made your impression and I suggest you back down at this point.  Let her make up her own mind on her own.  Because remember this, if she is the type to leave someone she loves because of a couple good convos with you, then she'll likely one day leave you too over something similar.  I wish you luck and in the end, love will prevail..whether it be with her or not.
CMjSkDOMaa	It sounds fine to me. If it makes you and he happy, who am I to tell you differently? Actually, I'm not sure how else you would experiment with a new sexual relationship/experience other than what you have done- experiment. It sounds like you have doubts. There is nothing wrong with it, but if you do maybe you should just talk to him. I wish you the best of luck.|`|Jh0yyYizaa	OMG I THINK I'M GONNA BE SICK.|`|901eafc186c995cb8a7e6e8ce846775faa	I think it seems kind of innocent - no one manipulating the other, acting out of genuine curiosity - yes? <br>  <br>  If it is feeling wrong, you should discuss it with your partner, make sure you are both on the same page.  Is this just about sex?  Does he feel guilt?  etc.<br>  <br>  We have a lot of social pressures telling us to live just one way, and I don't think that is necessarily true.  Live by your conscience.  Beware not to sexualize people too much in your mind, as it is disrepectful and can lead to an unhealthy relatiosnship with sex.<br>  <br>  Take Care|`|nZUvBisfaa	Hey guess what? You are gay...and there's nothing wrong with that. Its not exploring if you go all the way, exploring is maybe going to a club, secretly checking guys out, watching gay porn, etc. You are past that point.

pQw80POJaa	You either need to stop talking to "Max" or you need to lay down some ground rules. As in, "I'm taken. Please respect that." I'm sure you guys have flirted back and forth via text because he felt comfortable enough to hint his crush on you so just stop flirting with him. Look at it this way, "If you keep flirting with him or talking with him then you'll piss off two important people in your life that you love, your boyfriend and your best friend. However, if you let him know that you two are just friends and that your conversations need to be strictly platonic from now on, he might get tiffed but chances are he'll remain your friend. If he doesn't remain your friend then he obviously doesn't respect your situation.<br>  <br>  As far as letting your best friend and boyfriend know about Max's crush and flirtation, I would just let Max know it has to end and then just keep it to yourself. Why upset them both and start drama? Cease and desist the flirty texts though!<br>  <br>  Good luck, hun! Take solace in the fact that everything happens for a reason. You two weren't meant to date. Sure you are curious about it and are frustrated because when you were single and willing, he was oblivious. But it sounds like you and your current boyfriend are happy and that your friendship with Jess is important to you. Make that priority number one. :)|`|y7H6ngtCaa	then  say  i  cant  do  this  because my  bestfriend  like  u|`|59cnZfTeaa	Just don't give Max any hints that you like him. keep it as friends and if he tries to make a move tell him you're taken.
kEy3W5ydaa	don't blame that on being drunk...go get yourself tested today for stds and aids....you can transmit those to her unknowingly so GO GET TESTED ASAP...and it doesn't mean your gay just an idiot with closet gay friends|`|MgMsMExPaa	It is really not a big deal. So you had some kind of sex with a guy while you were drunk. At some point in their lives most men do some experimenting. It is not like you are having a relationship (gay) with them. The girlfriend is too closed minded if she thinks you are doing this with guys on a regular basis. She dose not really need to know. If you and you friends want to do this together and date women at the same time it dose not make you gay it makes you bi. Gay is if you are exclusively dating men.|`|tpioRQHkaa	i'm staying straight. i like the warmth of the almighty vagina.if theres another dick in my face its gonna be my boss. hes so mean. <br>  and dont tell her. and i tink you hired hookers cause thats what i was doing last night and thats were i woke up but i remember hookers.<br>  and a monkey. and a big bong|`|PbFL8jh2aa	Tell her. If she's mature enough, she'll realise that you had the guts to tell her what you did. If she finds out from someone else, then she'll be really mad at you. Apologise to her and say that it'll never happen again, and that you didn't mean what you did. ^^|`|EZ2qTVp7aa	did your *** hurt when you woke up.|`|xACBQs52aa	dump her & go gay.|`|AA10899789	yea, that makes you gays. Whether its an accident or not.<br>  ur gf should know. its her right.<br>  <br>  If u don't tell her, it means u don't love her. if she gets angry fine, at least u didn't stayed together with guilt. and if you don't tell her about that, that would be lying. <br>  Its better if you're the one to tell her rather than her knowing it from other people.<br>  <br>  Explain to her what happened, detailed.<br>  <br>  But for me, that's really a gay thing. and if I were your gf I'd pretend I never became your gf.|`|ULkqriEhaa	Well, of course you have to tell  her. <br>  <br>  It doesn't make you gay - it means you were drunk and were possibly curious at the time. If you may be gay or bisexual, there's nothing wrong with that, but you must tell your girlfriend, regardless of how she reacts you owe her that much. <br>  <br>  Living with that guilt will eventually end the relationship, it's better you tell her than some others telling her a glorified version of events.<br>  <br>  Just because you had sex with males (or sexual activity) doesn't automatically make you gay, if you want, further explore your feelings about men (when you're not drunk) <br>  <br>  But yes, tell her. It's the mature thing to do.|`|xtV34EbCaa	You have to tell her.<br>  If you don't she'll probably find out from someone else and be even madder. Not that she won't be mad at you now, but it's better coming from you. That way she can get the full (well as much as you can remember) story, and not just crazy rumors.<br>  <br>  And it doesn't make you gay, it makes you drunk. Really really really drunk from the sound of it, haha. If you were gay you probably would have noticed when you were sober...|`|9FlUlbYXaa	Tell her.  None of you remember what happened.  Guys do dumb things when they're drunk.  Next time, keep your clothes on and don't get so drunk.  She should be understanding about it since you can't prove anything gay happened.  Are any of those naked guys gay?  Did anyone check their cellphones for pictures?  Maybe you guys were comparing sizes...|`|5zw5I6xTaa	wow that just like plane ewwwwwwww but you have to tell her if you love her and she loves you then she will understand that you was drunk|`|mRevfznjaa	it doesnt make you gay..forget every thing... dont tell ur  gf anything....otherwise u knw wht going to be happen... just forgot every thing like a bad dream...and frm next time dont drink tht much... tc|`|HevT3fg8aa	lol u juss tell her yall wer mad drunk so it mite not be that serious <br>  if iwas ur gurl i wud die laughin!|`|FLeHvtcAaa	If you all agree to keep it secret, then keep it secret.  People do dumb things when they're drunk.  I don't think it would make you gay, just too drunk to make good decisions.  <br>  <br>  Of course, there's the whole trust and honesty factor.  You have to weigh that against a question like "Hmm, is this really an aspect of my personality that I feel the need to express again in the future?"  <br>  <br>  Sounds like it's not something you would normally do.  Kind of like tripping over a rock.  I don't think it is worth mentioning.  <br>  <br>  You can't just walk away without learning a lesson first, though.  You need to be more responsible when drinking because of what happened last time, apparently.  I don't think it's worth telling or worth writing off as if it never happened.  Understand what I mean?  <br>  <br>  I hope it all tuns out well.  Good luck.|`|sLDqymHzaa	No, you aren't gay, you were just very, very stupid and drunk.<br>  <br>  And yes, you should tell her. If she's really someone you want to be with, she will be mad, but she will be there for you, nonetheless. I, personally, would be absolutely infuriated if something like that happened, but I wouldn't leave (even if I said I would). Tell her that you're afraid to upset her because you don't want her to be hurt, but you want more to be honest with her. Tell her what happened. Definitely expect a maelstrom of anger fueled, distress fed sob fests, but you need to be there for her when she's mad. No matter what, tell her she's right and promise not to let it happen again.... repeatedly. Honestly, you should promise not to get drunk ever again, too. She'll feel a lot better about it (not to mention, you'd save yourself a lot of trouble and a couple of mornings with your head in the toilet). And, personally, I don't think this is funny at all... so... don't try heading it from that approach. try it like this:<br>  <br>  1. Tell her that something happened, and you're going to tell her because you want to be honest with her, and you trust that she'll understand. <br>  2. Tell her you'll be there for her when she's hurt, and you know that you were wrong.<br>  3. Tell her what you think happened, but stress that it's possible you're wrong, but you thought she should know anyway.<br>  4. Make all the promises you need and apologize.<br>  <br>  KEEP ALL OF YOUR PROMISES! AND NO MATTER WHAT DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES TELL HER THAT YOU WISH YOU NEVER TOLD HER WHAT HAPPENED!<br>  <br>  and tell her soon! it's worse if you wait. I'd want to know right away, if I were her. And you should all get tested... valid point there by some other people.|`|AA10894901	How do you know that you weren't set up?|`|Xz0KHqFWaa	you should tell her. because she'll know it soon. just be open and maybe she'll understand...maybe|`|h99Mcg6taa	Were you all on drugs?

No, don't tell her.  You won't burst if you keep it inside.  <br>  <br>  At least, don't tell her yet.  Once you have had some time to think about it and decide whether you're bi-curious or not, and when you've talked with the other guys about it, then maybe.  But we're talking about the span of a year or so.  <br>  <br>  Whatever you do, don't out one of your gay friends to your intolerant gf.  That's just cruel.

I think you should try to be more understanding. to be honest will you knowing all the grisly details really put your heart more at ease. Let him come when he is ready, just cause you feel its time doesn't mean he might.

Eventually your cultural differences will show, but thats neither good nor bad. I know a white Canadian guy who married an East Indian woman, and they have a really good marriage.<br>  <br>  I think it depends on how open minded you both are, and you have a lot of talking to do! Such as family planning, finances, household chores and responsibilities, the list goes on. Don't settle for an explanation like: It's going to be wonderful or peachy keen and bright. For who?<br>  <br>  It might be unromantic, but if you are considering marriage, you have right to know what you are getting in to, in detail.|`|W1VqOP83aa	His muslim/pakistani heritage is irrelevant here. If you don't already know this man inside and out and love everything about it, don't even think about marrying him. I've known Pakistani muslims who were religious fanatics and I've known Pakistani muslims who throw house parties all the time with booze, drugs and smoking hot girls (and lots pakistani regular joes in between).

I would also make sure he gives you a dowery.

And if he does marry you, he'll probably try to make you into a Muslim too, unless if he doesn't really care for his religion. You'll never be able to wear shorts or a skirt or dress that doesn't touch the floor again. And no offense or anything, but I've noticed that Muslims don't exactly treat women right. They think that men must be the leader, the one in charge. And they don't always allow women to do certain things, like pray while they're having their period because it's considered unholy.|`|wJ0iLG0raa	he's just messing with ur head.<br>  this has nothing to do w his religion its just him!, if ur christian yeah a muslim man can marry u<br>  <br>  and no he wont be able to do anything he's just having a lil temporary fun talking to u.<br>  <br>  4get him and move on.<br>  <br>  it wont happen.the only way it could wld be for him to foresake his family if u 2were dedicated to each other.<br>  <br>  other then that, dont believe something that he wouldnt follow through unless yourve known him long enough to know otherwise|`|odc8LHbBaa	As a Japanese religionist, i feel that i have an answer to ur question.<br>  <br>  don't marry him. he will persuade u to wear ninja uniform.

HJFLMhBdaa	Betrayed girl please email me privatley I would like to be able to help you.  I too have gone through your very situation.  I caught my husband with his 'peice on the side' he poored out his love for me and how sorry he was and how he did not want to lose me and then found a sneakier way of seeing her again 1 month later.  I of course caught him again and we seperated.  He has since done everything he can to win me back and for the sake of the children I gave him one last chance (Yes I know many of you are laughing).  Now for the first year I was just like you.  Every day every thought every moment my mind was not occupied I thought of the betrayal.  I thought of how I would get her.  Of how I would get him.  I talked and talked and talked to my friends, which must have driven them mad.  I thought I was goind mad myself.  I woke in the night in panick. I could not eat.  I found the only way to fight off the depertion was with exercise so I would swim or run and run and run  and with every step and stroke I would plan what I was going to do to her. etc etc.  Well it will be 19 months since I found out the 2nd time and 2 years since the first.  I still think of it every day but it does not torture me now.  We are happy toghether and our children are happy (which is why I stayed).  You CAN be happy again but he has to let you talk.  My husband would avoid talking after the first discovery and just wanted us to get back to normal HA! I found out why 5 month later.   After the 2nd time and him finally realising what pain he had caused and pulling his head out of his @%% he had to admit even too himself what a selfish scum he had been.  After we decided to go forward again I spoke to my husband about his affair every single night for a year.  Trully every night, sometimes for a minute, sometimes for an hour.   Sometimes I hated him sometimes I felt sorry for him.  Every time he let me ask questions he answered and he comforted an apolagised.  I still don't trust him and I do check on him regularly but I know we are finaly moving past it.  We are more intemate and he is more caring and involved in our lives than he has ever been.  I trully believe he is sorry for the pain he caused and I think (and hope ) he regrets every action he undertook with that other person.  It takes a very long time to heal 2 years is about the time friam.  If you are at five months then try and think about how you were 4 months ago and see if you are a little better now.  In 5 more months see if you are a bit better than now.  YOU are NOT going mad.  You will survive this and you will be a stronger (all be it perhaps a bit harder) woman in the end.  Hopefully for both of us in 20 years time this will be but a little ugly pimple on the face of a long lasting beautiful marriage.  <br>  P.S. Please Please go to survivinginfidelity.com it is the best site you will find. Read the healing library.  Get him to read some of it too so he can see your reactions are just so normal... and they are!  xxx to you|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	Under the anger and confusion, there is a lot of hurt. That's what you really need to let out. If they want it on paper, do it. Write him a letter and tell him how hurt you feel and how you may never be able to trust him again.<br>  <br>  When you think about them 'together' sexually, you really are trying to come to terms with your hurt, but that also keeps you stuck in a psychological loop. Thinking what they did, how it hurts you, how angry that makes you feel (betrayal) and then you start to go around again.<br>  <br>  Anger turned in on yourself becomes depression, and depression turned outward becomes anger, and around it goes, over and over again.<br>  <br>  When you can express your hurt feelings, that will be helpful for you. Yes, it is time to think about you, and how you want your life to be, with or without your spouse. Until you figure that out, you will be stuck in a loop.<br>  <br>  When you let yourself care, about your kids for example, you can start the healing, but you need to stop thinking in that nasty loop. You are hurting yourself if you don't. So? Write that letter! What do you have to lose?|`|B1sT1t44aa	If I were you I would think about getting a different therapist if you really want to stay in this marriage?<br>  What you are going through is very real and I can only imagine how horrible all of this is for you.<br>  A four year affair is not like getting over a one night stand and what happened between this woman and him that he now expects you to learn how to deal with it and feels he has the right for you to salvage this relationship?<br>  I am sorry but loving him or not I just could not deal with it not when things went on for as long as it did.<br>  I could see you trying if this were a short term situation and even that would be hard enough for me to ever feel that safe and comfortable with him fully again.<br>  When a spouse creates so much damage like this It's hard to know what to believe in and where you begin to start over?<br>  I don't know that I could have the energy to continue on because like yourself I would be going over the past 4 years until it drove me half crazy to.<br>  The only way that I could shut off this nightmare on a day to day basis is by trying to start my life over without having to look at him everyday like this didn't happen.<br>  He has changed everything here from the world you once knew with him and for me nothing would be the same.<br>  You have a lot of things to think about here so sweetie change counselors and find someone that can give you some better direction in helping you make the right decission here for yourself.|`|AA11993763	Honestly sweetie I've been there and for me it didn't get better and I filed for divorce. He swore he wanted to salvage the relationship too and I couldn't trust him. Once that trust is broken it's really hard to get it back. I wish you luck and if you want to save it too you will, but if it becomes too much walk honey that's all I can tell you. You deserve better than that and if he's truly remorseful his actions will say that. If they don't get rid of him cause he will likely do it again.|`|CxhH2xSQaa	1. Not fair that your husband gets to move on and "forget the whole thing"...THAT my dear, is BULLSH*T. <br>  2. You will most likely never get over this entirely. In time the thoughts will decrease, but every once in a while they will re-surface, maybe in about 2 to 3 years the pain will truly be gone, but the memory won't <br>  3. You have to ask yourself, can you really, honestly, trust this man again? <br>  <br>  Without trust, there is no love. <br>  <br>  No excuses, no way around it, love is only facilitated by respect and trust...without that (which he obviously did/does not respect you since he did that) love cannot exist. Feelings might, the pressure of wanting to not be alone, the history, the past, the memories....but real love, is all but lost.<br>  <br>  Everyone has given you great advice...and simply here is mine:<br>  <br>  leave.<br>  <br>  Just leave.<br>  <br>  Don't spend the rest of your life numbing your self and convincing yourself that you deserve this. You don't....nobody who has loved another does. You need to talk about it to others, you need to get it out, and you need, to get out. Don't let yourself become that sad woman who has to stand by in fear that her husband will leave, will love another, will do it again, life is not meant to be lived in that kind of fear and mistrust.<br>  <br>  A few years of pain is worth a lifetime of freedom.|`|N7gOE1btaa	I will save you the extremly long preamble to what I am going to just conclude with.  Sometimes, some people just do not get over this stuff.  I hate to say it and I truly respect your attempts to correct your marriage.  That is wonderful.  But if you feel therapy isn't getting you anywhere, then it probably never will.  Your therapist is a business--the longer you go the more money they make.  I believe they have good intentions, but after a while with no progress, who knows.  You need to decide if you can live with having been cheated on and never trusting your husband fully again.  Can you?  Forget writing it down and all that junk, answer yourself one question:  can you?|`|uzeKqH0Taa	you have a bad counselor. its bad to no repress Ur feelings. i mean its totally natural to feel what u feel and u have every right. the human body has natural healing abilities that help u heal and they make take months and years for all this to take place but trust me it will happened. <br>  i had a hard time getting over a breakup and i had it in my mind all the time. i felt betrayed,angry,disappointed and i would tell myself that i was stupid for feelings this because some of my friends would let i was not that he did me dirty so why should i care and i would tell myself that but i was just doing harm to myself because my body was feeling one thing and i was not letting it feel what it needs to feel to heal. if u are sad tell Ur self I'm sad because_______. also the feeling that u are feeling can only last so long. it just like moments that u have.  it sounds like u are going through serious depression more than i did. i think u need to take a vacation from everything. i understand that u have kids. ask one of your close friends or your husband to care for them. and i go with your mom somewhere if funds are low then go out to the beach relax enjoy the sun. my mom always makes me feel loved and happy so spending time with her makes me happy. so find someone  that makes u feel like that i hope everything work out for you. if ever need someone to express how u feel just email me. i understand what u are going threw xxokiexxdokie@yahoo.com. good luck =]

Step 1 before ever beginning a new relationship, is ending an old one.  You both are married with children.  Unfortunately it can not be all about you.  So before you make the jump, be certain it's love, and not lust.  Divorce is a HUGE decision, but likewise, cheating will haunt you for the rest of your life.  You'll always look at your husband and think, "I cheated on you".  It will always be there.  ... <br>  Now, as for love in the workplace, I've dated a great many men I have worked with, and fell madly in love with one of them.  However, I never once dated a man I work for.  If the relationship goes awry, can you still work together?

200416208f6ad103a9e8e22b4202c849aa	I know in 4-H, we kicked quite a few girls and guys out for disorderly and rude behavior. It is against girl scout rules to act the way she is acting.<br>  <br>  I was never in girl scouts but my step brother was in boy scouts. The rules was the same. You either behave and respected or you are out. My friend in middle/high school was kicked out after he got into a knife fight with another kid in school. So, doesn't always just have to happen in the scout's meetings to get in trouble. <br>  <br>  You also have to remind the leader that if this is hitting, she is actually causing abuse to other children. That abuse can actually be turned into authorities as assault. Then that can back lash on the troop that the troop is an unsafe environment.|`|TyqGdBw1aa	as a leader there really is nothing you can do. kids don't care what there peers think anymore trust me. there is 1 of three things you can do. slap her mom for raising a brat and not giving her the beating she deserves, on the next camping trip leave her behind for a day or 2 and see how snotty she is after that, or you can just kick her out of the scouts.|`|3EM66IWFaa	yes, the leader must take action against that girl for misbehaviour.

Her mother allows this behaviour so in her mind, she is doing nothing wrong.<br>  <br>  I would make apple sauce out of her! Just kidding ;-)<br>  <br>  She needs a behaviour modification program, but this far along, she will end up in trouble with that law before that happens. The leaders should have a meeting with themselves and her parents, and strongly move towards suspension.<br>  <br>  She needs tough love at this point, and her mother is inadequate to be a mother. This girl probably abuses her mother and if she doesn't, she soon will. If I was her father, I would try to get her into 'Boot Camp'. But she will do that herself when she breaks the law.|`|xfpJGBfwaa	Start removing privileges.  If she shows you disrespect, then remove her food from her, and don't give her any for one hour.  Tell her to leave the dining hall during that time.  She can go someplace quiet and read, or she can help out in the kitchen...<br>  <br>  Instead of activities, her punishment should be to help out in the kitchen or on some cleanup crew for the rest of any day when she is disrespectful.  Just don't provide her with any materials to join in any activities and tell her to leave until she does.  Take them away from her immediately when she begins her rudeness. <br>  <br>  Don't let her bargain with you like this:  "Oh, I'll just sit here quietly.  Would that be OK?"  She won't be quiet.  She has a choice of leaving the room or leaving the room.  <br>  <br>  The next day, she can't return to regular activities until she has listened quietly to her victim explaining how it felt to be victimized, and then apologized.

Xww9vGWPaa	No, that's not too early. If you're worried that you're jinxing things or hurrying things along too fast, think of it this way. Its ok to say you love this person because you do. You can love someone a lot without being in love with them. So if it doesn't work out in the end, you can look back and say, "Well I cared a lot about him/her but I guess I wasn't in love." That's how I try to look at the whole "I love you" committment.|`|9nOQlbwEaa	Ya I think it is a bit too early, just only 2 months , you can hardly get to know her better, saying I love you is very easy, but to have it last for a long time is a bit too hard for young people nowadays, what they have is only puppy love.

We were in love for, oh, say, about six months before we actually got together.|`|Bfwg0eBJaa	no, I said I love you to her after about a week (though I had been stalking her for about a month already.<br>  <br>  but... saying I love you I consider to be a verbal contract, promissing that you will never break up with him/her, and will eventual marry him/her.|`|y7H6ngtCaa	can  i  tell  u  something  u  can  cause  maybe   he  feel  the  same  way  about  u  to i told  my  boyfriend  i  love  him  2weeks  later  cause  u cant help  feelling  cause  they  come and  go|`|I1kfSC1Daa	yes I think it's too early..wait till about 6 months|`|jeHTjvbaaa	It would really freak me out... but that's just me personally because I have had bad experiences with the "L" word in relationships.  I usually wait a pretty long time until I say it and if the girl tells me it first I won't say it back unless I mean it.|`|6a1cc93dd55dba4164421281fe1a70aeaa	i think love happens when it happens.... if youve spent enough time together to know for sure, then id say why not? love happens when you least expect it... I dont remember when i told my bf or when he told me... but i started feeling something amazing (maybe love?) after a month..... maybe the next month or so, we said the i love you's... we've been dating for a yr now..|`|wDisAke1aa	No. If you really feel that you love this person, say it. I told my current girlfriend that i loved her nearly a week before we started dating. She told me first and i'm glad, i wasn't sure until she told me and when she told me i realized that i did love her. But the other people here are right too, if it is too early for him he might just say it to avoid an awkward situation. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|db4310b357e8b8155cfe1bd956cf7660aa	I told my girlfriend that I loved her when I realized that I did.|`|XGgPhaDbaa	After about 6 months|`|Z4B93N31aa	i dont think thats too early<br>  we started saying i love you<br>  at that time too<br>  <br>  he started though

Find your own!|`|Z4B93N31aa	hahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahhahaaha<br>  hahh<br>  ahahahahahhahahahhaha'aha<br>  ahahhahahahahhahaaaaaaa|`|6a1cc93dd55dba4164421281fe1a70aeaa	he didnt call you ugly, he just said that you are way too young for him.....|`|DNouvr9maa	hes not saying your ugly he just saing you are too young|`|EKlBQub6aa	You are sadly mistaken little girl. lol|`|1QSsOAAFaa	at worst, yes, he said you're ugly.<br>  at best, he said you're not beautiful enough, that you'll be beautiful enough later on, or that he prefers older women than you.<br>  at any rate, you should really leave your sister's bf alone. that's sibling rivalry at its worst.|`|rbXCALUhaa	um... dude its your sisters boyfriend!<br>  what kind of sister are you? Your personality makes you ugly if you want to have a relationship with your sisters boyfriend!<br>  and you're ugly. Shes hot... I would even date her.|`|RXe4guclaa	shes definitely prettier. i wish I looked lk her :\<br>  <br>  go deflate your head and stop trying to steal your sisters bf. that's the ultimate betrayal. i would NEVER do that to my sister and shed never do that to me.|`|XwMn6aY5aa	wow first of all your little <br>  2nd he's your sisters boyfriend you should find your own bf and let your sisters relationship be i think you should just not get in between that isn't sister love shame on you!!|`|OB8KPPIQaa	your kidding right? i mean no offense but your not even close to pretty... also there is something called personality.. and geez.. i cant believe you think your better looking|`|x1FzJLwZaa	how could you do that to your sister?<br>  <br>  not to be rude but <br>  your sister is pretty... no comparison|`|lFzFtiCBaa	No, You're not prettier than anyone. At all.|`|RaB4hYp1aa	what are you doing telling your sister's boyfriend that you love him?|`|K8bx57I2aa	I think that it's seriously WRONG to hit on your sisters' boyfriend. The one that called it the "ultimate betrayal" was right.<br>  <br>  You aren't exactly ugly. And even if you were, I know plenty of not exactly gorgeous women with boyfriends. It's a matter of personality. From the way you sound, you don't really have much.<br>  <br>  Yeah, he called you ugly. It's pretty obvious that he did. In any case, you aren't exactly hopeless I guess. Work on your attitude, and select the men you decide to go for. :| Hitting on men that are in relationships is wrong!|`|sLDqymHzaa	...wow... uhmm. no. you aren't prettier. at all. I hope you meant that sarcastically when you asked... if not, sorry to be so blunt. But honestly, your sister's boyfriend? Come on. Not only is he older than you... he's not single... and he's dating your sister. Really, that's just wrong if you were serious. Hell, it's wrong if you didn't mean it, all the same. Not that any of that answers your question... except that you aren't prettier. Well he probably likes her for her redeeming, non-backstabbing qualities that don't involve attempting to rob your sister of your boyfriend. Plus there's always the fact that he actually KNOWS her... and is therefore not investing himself in a pointless relationship based on nothing. On another note, even if you DID take him, what would come of it? It sure as hell wouldn't last, your sister would pretty much hate you, and I know your mother wouldn't be proud. My advice? Let it go and invest in something realistic... as in NOT something that belongs in a teenage soap opera equivocal to Days of Our Lives.|`|iOv9tbULaa	Well, you are a little bigger than her, but maybe you look kind of immature. She looks more mature. Maybe everyone has their types. He may think she looks better b/c that's what HE likes, but other people might disagree. I mean, I can't really say who looks better b/c you both look kind of different. Better pictures would have help your case though. And if he doesn't like you, try talking to guys who may be into you and are around your age. I'm sure you can get a bf, you're not bad looking. Hope that helped.|`|lMYP9XAdaa	How could you do that to your own sister? <br>  No offense, but he's right. Beauty does increase with age and you do seem young. Step on that treadmill, girl and run!<br>  <br>  Did you expect anything special to happen? Like him magically dating you?|`|EAlIwQxCaa	ya he didnt call you ugly but seriously do you guys have mirrors in the house or what try again next time, and it aint all bout looks i would rather have a girl who treats me with respect that a hot girl who has nothing to offer besides looks.|`|vugm5rxoaa	Well first of all she is prettier. Secondly its not that he is calling you ugly its just a fancy way of saying i am not interested in you.|`|lKutsYcWaa	Honestly, why are you trying to break up your sister's relationship with her boyfriend?! That's just shallow, you don't have any reason to do that to her. And YES he called you ugly.|`|ptA3CdqOaa	1. Why did you say you loved your sister's boyfriend?<br>  2. You do look much younger then your sister<br>  3. Yes, she is prettier but beauty does increase with age<br>  6.

AA11363680	It is not easy for men to move on from a serious relationship. If it seems that way it was either not actually serious on his part, or he's just hiding it well. <br>  <br>  And if he moved on to another woman very quickly he is either throwing himself into the new relationship to avoid dealing with the last one, or he already had a relationship started with the new girl in some way.|`|FSruw622aa	I don't think that's the same for me.  There was a relationship I was in for 2 years with a girl that was mean to me in every way, she was also depressed and I felt that I should go the extra mile for her to feel better, she also liked to hang out with me by sleeping in the area by me, we wouldn't do anything as she never wanted to do anything.... man life sucked... Well I got away from her and it was hard, I think I was in love with her because I took care of her... I'm still healing from that relationship and it ended Mar. 2006.
8b96e0549932f6f7dc7802568aa00011aa	Ending the friendship was definitely the right thing to do mainly because it's what YOU wanted. If I were you, I would let her know - genuinely - that I am concerned about her well-being and would like to see her get some professional help.  I agree with "Gorgeous" who suggests telling an adult about this young lady's carving.<br>  <br>  While it would have been better to end the friendship WITHOUT calling her "awful things", you took charge of your own life and let her know her behavior would not be tolerated by you.  For that, I applaud you.  Other people will always weigh in with their opinions and attitudes, but remember your life is not their responsibility, so they have nothing to lose by telling you anything to get what they want.  That can include saying that this young lady is carving "art" into her skin when she's actually engaging in troubling behavior.  It can also include telling you you're not accepting her for who she is as though you owe her when, really, you don't.  Here's the part she's not telling you:  you don't have to accept who she's become.  You get to have standards for your own life, and you don't have to let other people tell you with whom you should be friends.  <br>  <br>  It's natural to feel badly about ending the friendship.  You ending the friendship doesn't have to mean you don't care about this person.  It sounds like you're finding out all the reasons why ending friendships is not easy, and why it's so important to stand strong.  You are not responsible for saving someone else from themselves, especially at your young age.  Ending the friendship shows you have good, healthy boundaries and that you know what you want out of life.  These are good habits you're practicing now, and you will need them throughout your adult life.<br>  <br>  You've already exercised the direct approach and that's good.  Now you can exercise the indirect approach which can include not returning her calls, IMs, or texts, focusing on making new friends and spending most of your time with them, and joining new activities that your friend does not do.  <br>  <br>  Here's an important thing to remember:  you are the only decisionmaker when it comes to who gets to be friends with you and who doesn't.  You are the only one who sets the standards for the people you include in your life.  <br>  <br>  Good luck with this, and I wish you the best!|`|tU5NJVL3aa	I personally feel you did the right thing.  Be strong and realize you don't have to be friends with someone and "accept her for who she is" if who she is is someone who isn't the type of friend you want.  Apparently, she could not accept you for who you were either.|`|xufESx85aa	It is obvious that she is headed down a bad path. You need to tell an adult about her "carving art" on herself. She could end up cutting too deep and really getting hurt.
VWvI5RyBaa	You're the one who expect too much from others.  What with your attitude, why are you so racist?  The time you think you're better than everybody else, you will never have real friends.  I know that if I were young, I wouldn't want you as a friend.  You have a lot of work to do before you can even imagine having a good friend.  You don't deserve them and I mean, you're not worthy of their friendship.  Start working real hard on your character, there are many flaws with it.  I'm saying this to help you before it's too late.<br>  <br>  I've been harsh because if you would have written about not being racist and the story of that one guy in particular, it would have made all the difference in the world.  The way you said it really felt racist but what I believe you're saying is that no matter if he would have been like you, the same colour, you would feel the same way about him.  You should explain what is wrong with the kid instead of saying the word "stupid" because where I live, the word is not permitted in class so we never say it in the house because the children always repeat what the parents say and it would get them in real trouble at school.  Their policy is really, really strict.  For example, it's a public school & the principal took two days to go in each classroom to explain the new dress code which is now jeans at the waist for everybody(close to impossible to find for young people) and they cannot wear tops that would show more skin than 7 cm(2.8 inches) under the neck, etc.  Also the way you said that you had tons of friends but nobody you can hang out with sounded like you didn't like anybody.  There was also the comment of being the smartest girl in your class that seemed to indicate that you didn't have friends because the tons of friends you have are not smart enough for you.  You can reread the description, it's kind of confusing.  However, I usually come back to some answers I gave in case there's more information which is why I'm here now.  With the word appreciation even though some of us were harsh and the words "God Bless", I realized that it was just out of frustration that you wrote all those words without noticing they could be seen the way I saw it.  Yes, I do undestand your problem, I have 2 sisters who are 11&9 years older than me and they were 1st in their class&I was expected to do as well&did.  However, I never thought about it in a way that it was a barrier between my friends and I.  They were so much smarter in so many other ways, whether it was sewing, music, etc.  I also had other problems, my sisters got sck young and the first day I was born my parents looked at me and said, "That one is the one who will take care of us in our old days."  I have been told that almost everyday of my life, talk about pressure.  I'm just trying to say that life is not easy for anyone.  You're intelligent so you'll be able to do great things and it will come to you when the time is right.  You don't need to have all the answers, just take it one day at a time.  Even when you go to the university, you can still change your mind, do something else than what you've started and most of the credits, if not all, will go toward your new course.  As for the guy friend, I agree with you.  I always felt at ease with boys more than with girls.  Just don't let anything get to you, you just need to relax.  Be honest and with respect, tell your parents that you feel too pressured and ask them to be more understanding of your feelings.  I'm sure if you tell them that pushing you has a negative effect on you, they will understand.  If not, try to not pay attention to what they say and just be you.  Because if you always try to please everybody, you will always be sad and overwhelmed.  By the way, I'm sorry for being so harsh earlier.|`|kwYbe4n6aa	may be u should learn from that stupid foreign student first before u judge them...maybe thats why ur life is crappy...they don't speak English that well doesn't mean they r stupid....

q15damBIaa	Telling young children about the "birds and the bees" is easy. Just say you two are at the age now where you need to know about this and go fom there, ask them if the have questions no doubt they will, i'm 13 myself and well you have had the talk, yeah at first we get weirded out by it but you know it's stuff we actually want our parents to talk to us about. Don't worry and Good Luck!<br>  Xxx|`|Lr75hENEaa	start them about relationships|`|NQwljNOoaa	You really don't need to sit down and have a formal conversation if you have trusted your kids all along.  All you need to do is just answer any questions they may have at the time they ask as honestly as possible.  If they are old enough to ask the question, they are old enough for the honest answers.  That doesn't mean that you have to volunteer extra information (and you shouldn't), just answer the questions as each child asks them.  You will find that you may not be telling the twins the same information at the same time.  When they are ready to hear it, they will ask the questions.  Until that time, just enjoy your children and always answer question of any kind honestly, but as short and to the point as you can.  If the answer is not satisfactory to them and they want more, they will continue with more questions.  Just answer all questions as openly and honestly as you can.|`|MvzrzDSNaa	Start by learning to spell...|`|4a2VzINCaa	tell them seperately. together = awkward<br>  <br>  sexsexsexsexsexsex<br>  <br>  <br>  beef cow|`|VGt37iqwaa	TRUST ME THEY DONT WANNA KNOW !!!!|`|RvYqObe7aa	Im 17,i had a gf and me and her were dating about 6 months and my dad just told me to wrap my willy if we get busy haha,not the way to do it,(later on he accutaly had a covo with me about babies and stds)just sit each one down seperatly and tell them that sex is a big thing,and that it not some thing you just forget about,just tell to wait till they find someone they love,plz dont tell to wait until marriage it rarely works and if it does your really lucky.Oh and maybe tell to use protection and maybe get your son a condom and your daughter on the pill but that you might wanna wait for|`|pawJiFnHaa	I think you should sit them down and just flat out tell them. Let them ask any questions they might have. Be honest with them and don't hold back. You want them to get the right information the first time without having to hear stories from friends that may or may not be true. A lot of young people today don't even believe oral sex is real sex, but its something a lot of parents leave out of the sex talk. I think the key is just to be very honest, very graphic and informative. That way they get the right information the right way, without getting the school yard version of things. And since you have been honest maybe they will feel more free to talk to you about other things. And thats a priceless gift in this day and age.|`|saxeD7fYaa	How old are they?<br>  Because i knew most of what my mom told me already so it was so pointless believe me..u learn alot on school from peers,teacher,books <br>  i am a freshman at the moment but when i was in 3rd and 4th grade i knew sooooooooo much that a talk was pretty much uneeded lol<br>  My mom gave me a book and i didn't even need it lol<br>  <br>  An that would b mega awkard with ur brother or sister|`|7xCfyZDpaa	dont tell them together! reserve time for each of them individually as they are very diffrent start with how the body starts to change and take it from there|`|ea8Nygxvaa	have ur wife tell ur daughter n u tell ur son n dont leave anything out u dont want ur kids to have to find out on their own|`|mjC4hX1waa	depends on the age..my parents never told me..i just kinda already knew. plus in 7th or 8th grade they learn about it. but yeahhh.|`|zsgX4gDEaa	honestly theyll figure it out themselves, theyll feel very akward if a parent tells them

I don't know the laws over there, but you need a solicitor (attorney) of your own. But, for right now, you need to talk to someone. Is there a crisis line or mental health department near you? I feel so bad for you, I know how hard it is to be alone and feel so doomed. Please try and call someone, now. Do you have any other relatives or good friends that you could stay with, even for a day or two. You are overwhelmed with all that is happening to you. Your mother's death, your husband's cheating and bad attitude, even, perhaps, some post-partum depression. You really need so support right now, someone to hold you, someone to help you, some one to care for you. Please try to call someone or some agency. It makes me very sad that you are alone right now. I wish I was your neighbor, I would come over and talk to you. I know this isn't much help, but please know that there are people in the world that care for you and your situation, even if we do not know you. Try a help line now, and try to engage a solicitor on Monday morning. Good luck to you and God bless.

Tell him that you aren't making him choose you over his family but he still needs to decide if he wants to be with you or not. You shouldn't be strung along like this. Make him make a choice so you can get on with your life.

I'm going through the exact same thing. I don't have any friends left because of life changes, moves and my busy schedule. It made me realize that the friends I thought I had (even my bestfriend since preschool) were superficial friends, always relying on me for support but never really caring enough to support me when I needed it. I guess you just gotta look at your previous friendships really closely and ask yourself: did they really ever care in the first place? It takes time, but if you make the effort, you can develop other friendships.<br>  <br>  If it means anything, I'll be your friend. :)|`|Dd34j24laa	good luck
0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	It certainly seems inappropriate to me. Speak with your lawyer about it so you know what the legal side of it is. Is there a court order to this effect? If so, see if you can have it changed.|`|4cc625c81315e3cc57858f7de7250b2aaa	Honey, my guess is that your kids are fine with the living arrangements at their dad's place.  If they get along with the other kids, I would imagine it's like a sleep-over to them.  Your husband will find a way to provide a place for your daughter to sleep; little ones can sleep almost anywhere.  Take a look inside yourself and seriously ask yourself if this is about the sleeping arrangements, really?  Or is it possibly about your kids being around his girlfriend and maybe even liking her?  Is there some insecurity going on inside you about this?  If he is a good dad, don't do something to try to keep his kids away from him.  They need him as much as they need you.  Give this some thought.
XnIwEzlDaa	I explain to you why if that was true. But it is not. I know a lot of pretty girls who are nice and the not-so-pretty ones who are mean. It's just who they are.|`|jeHTjvbaaa	The "prettier" girls have never really developed a personality while the "ugly" girls did.  Fill in the quotations with whatever definition you find fit...|`|denyKCABaa	Because it's easier to be mean. And for pretty girls, they can afford to be mean because guys will never stop hanging out with them. There will always be more and more guys who will talk to them non stop. But the ugly girls have to put in the effort of being nice so guys will like them and stay. It's sad I know, I'm a guy and I hate how mean the pretty girls are.<br>  <br>  edit: Lol I knew girls were gonna get all defensive like "that's not always true!" but guys would agree with you that it's true. It's called bias you stupid bitches.<br>  <br>  Oh shut the **** up vance you're just trying to get any girl who reads your bullshit to say awww so just cut the **** you wannabe politically correct mother ****** you make me wanna throw up.|`|TEE4sJscaa	They(pretty girls) have not came to the conclusion yet that beauty is only skin deep. They think that they are better than everyone else and usually are the ones that always end up alone. But trust me they will learn all about this conclusion. It is a life lesson that one way or another will be learned. <br>  <br>  "Ugly" girls don't need physical beauty to treat others appropriately or to know their personal value. They are the ones that are truly beautiful. They have dealt with the fact that beauty is only skin deep and live with it everyday of their lives. They are perfectly fine with being how they are and have moved passed the superficial. Because they know that there is more to life then how someone looks.|`|eNMRIKL6aa	Because pretty girls don't need to act nice to be accepted, and ugly girls can barely be accepted even if they are nice. People don't choose their friends because of how nice they are. They choose based on how much popularity they get by being that person's friend.<br>  <br>  This is called politics.|`|AA11324847	It's very simple, the girls who had to work for what they have appreciate it more and treat it right. The girl who has everything handed to her considers many things expendable. Guess who wins out in the end....you got it. I'm aiming for that second girl, f*** the hot ones....|`|Z4B93N31aa	yeah i can be a b!+ch its true im sorry<br>  but thats reality!|`|wck4MHREaa	It's not always like this, but if we're going off of stereotypes, yeah, the pretty ones are also nasty and mean. It's usually because they know that they are pretty, and that  they are entitled to anything and everything they want because they are pretty, and because they can get away with it.<br>  <br>  Ugly girls have to work to get attention and don't get things handed over to them as easily, so they are far more humble and nice.<br>  <br>  Again, this is not always the case. The girl I'm crushing badly on is girl-next-door type gorgeous, beautiful, graceful- all these things, but she's also the most polite, most friendly, sweetest, nicest person you'll ever meet. She's such a good person that she makes me want to be a better person myself.|`|f5CsZYcDaa	The prettier girls KNOW they are pretty. and when they hit the age to realize that they are and the the hotter guys go for them more they become greedy and think they deserve better then the ugly people well ugly people to them at least. They have developed the mind that they are 'number 1' and no one is higher then them. They only are mean to those who aren't just like them. They want people to kind of be like a clone of them. EX. Preps. In my case are total B*tches. well not all but most. Anyone that doesn't wear hollister EVERY f*cking day your not one of them so they make fun of you for what you are wearing and yeah. Obviously their parents are pushovers but that is only my theory. The nicer people they were brought up the way people should polite and nice to people. parents that can't control their own kids shouldn't even have kids.<br>  <br>  Don't get me wrong their are few preps and pretty girls that are super nice and brought up the right way. but don't go by just looks more for personality|`|lwXGNizGaa	It's a simple question really.  "Ugly" girls can't afford to be mean because they believe the only reason anyone would be friends with them or like them is if they are super nice people.  Pretty girls don't have this burden because no matter what people are going to want to keep them around.  It's sad but true.|`|S9sZawG2aa	now i would never choose to be ugly rather than pretty, but being pretty does have its downsides.<br>  <br>  im usually a pretty nice person, but ugly people don't even give me a chance. they hate me from the beginning, and it's awkward because we both kinda know that the other is thinking lol.|`|rbXCALUhaa	Yea because pretty girls usually think they're all that while ugly girls are usually mistreated and take what they get. But that is a harsh generalization, I mean, not every pretty girl is mean and not every ugly girl is nice.|`|5SiBOTGXaa	pretty girls have a natural 'mean' image that is displayed to keep little weakling men away from her....<br>  <br>  learn to ignore the 'i am better than everybody else' image, and take them off the pedestal|`|xufESx85aa	That's not always the case. Some pretty girls can be nice, and some ugly girls can be mean. Quit judging people based on their looks.|`|7WRMpSVXaa	pretty girls are mean cause they can get it any where any time.ugly girls are nice because they dont know where the next one is coming from.|`|D5zxTZOKaa	pretty chicks can be asses because they're usually treated like solid gold, they think the world revolves around them. however not ALL of them are like this.<br>  now, they're not necessarily ugly chicks, but they do tend to be more down to earth because they are NORMAL. but same as before its not all of them.<br>  i myself am one of those nice chicks, sure im not perfect but i wouldnt call myself ugly and never have been in the past. so sure, you could settle for an assy chick, or you can stop being shallow and go for someone whose going to treat you right.<br>  in the long run, its the inner beauty that counts.|`|z6rCAG2Taa	okay that is sooo not true. I'm one of those "ugly" people. and i can be a real bi*ch. And yes most likely the not so pretty get hurt more and that's why there nicer. But pretty people also have problems. Its not just a ugly=nice pretty=mean. Its all around man. So what you asked i answered.|`|KR9mFAZgaa	pretty girls are mean because they usually always get comments on how nice they look. so they think that they are better than others. the ugly girls are nice because they don't always care about what they look like. they just be themeselves. <br>  Hope that helpes <33333|`|jxshK9mnaa	Uhh not all true. I have pretty friends and they're nice. It dpends what type of pretty they are? Hot (slutty) pretty might be more mean than cinderella pretty if you know what I mean.|`|ewHmUtT6aa	If ugly girls are mean no one will like them. Pretty girls can get away with being mean because of their attractiveness. <br>  but some pretty girls are nice and some ugly girls are mean.|`|qca43wgkaa	because ugly girls are generally nice people & pretty girls feel that they don't need a nice personality to be liked|`|9Vs22JmGaa	pretty girls: cuz they always get the attention [but not all pretty girls are like that]<br>  <br>  ugly girls: they arent slutls or anything so they know the good in life i guess and know treat people how you want to be treated..

I dated my ex for 3 years, it's been 5 months since we broke up. He seems to have moved on and I am just as depressed as I was at first. I cry at least weekly and it's often hard to even get through the day. I have no idea how he can just brush aside all our memories and move on, but I guess that's just how guys are. It's the worst when it's not only your bf but also someone you considered to be your best friend :(<br>  Of course, there's the break-up formula (it takes 1/2 the total time you were with someone to get over them), according to which, you're 25% of the way there! Not terrible. <br>  I've heard that finding a rebounder is a quick fix; I've been avoiding that but I think I'm just going to give in because I need something to take the pain away, even temporarily. <br>  But really try to resist the temptation of hooking up with your ex if he decides to call you, unless you can be sure that he's not just using you. I did that and it turned out he was just using me and that only set back my healing time more. <br>  Other than that, all I can suggest is the usual: reconnect with old friends, keep a journal, make memories of your ex less visible (hide gifts, cards, photos, etc.), work on goals that will improve yourself, and just hope that all this pain will make you much stronger eventually. Make a list of all the things that annoyed you about him or reasons why the relationship might not have worked down the road. I also made a list of things that I did wrong and right so the next time I'm in a happy relationship, I can at least learn from my mistakes. <br>  It always makes me feel better to know that other people are going through exactly what I'm going through, which is why I had to respond to your question. Good luck!|`|pZGVI9dPaa	I am so sorry that you are hurting so much. I know how it feels though, and so does everyone else, so you are not alone sweetie.  We have all gone through this and it always feels like the pain will never end. I can't tell you how long this will last but if you start getting busy it will help you not to focus on it. Maybe you could take up a new hobby or perhaps do some volunteer work to keep your mind off the break-up. Maybe you should think about dating again but try to remember you're not out to replace him with the first guy that comes around. You need time to get over him completely before you get serious with someone else. I hope you feel better soon. Remember it is not the end of the world it only feels like it right now. This too shall pass.|`|E0xuQFFnaa	It depends on the person grab a good girlfriend and talk to her that helped me.

5yfSIsXNaa	Vibrators aren't just for women anymore and if anything letting him know about it, and even using it with him can be a major plus to your sex life.  <br>  <br>  To begin with, many guys really enjoy watching their partner pleasure themselves, it's their own personalized porn that they can manipulate and it's lots of fun.  Also, there are a lot of guys who enjoy using a vibrator on their partner, it can give you a stronger orgasm than they normally can and it can often bring a little "spice" into the bedroom by using a gadget or toy. (lets face it, while there are plenty of times when a male body part may feel better than it's plastic counterparts, but I know my fingers can't vibrate that fast and that's just life, if your partner really has a problem with that, he's got his own issues.) <br>  <br>  Finally, there are a lot of ways that a vibrator can bring physical pleasure to a man.  First of all, the easiest way is to actually use it externally during sex, this isn't saying that he isn't good enough, but it will feel extra good for both of you because you'll have the added external stimulation while he'll get the feeling that it's you that's vibrating.  The other option is that depending on the shape of the vibrator, it can be used on him externally.  While this can be done with almost any vibrator, toys such as the hitachi magic wand, or the fukuoku 9000 massager are not meant for insertion so they're perfect for a guy or girl.  The Fukuoku is great for a little extra stimulation when you're using your hand on him (place it on your thumb and run it against the underside of the head).  The hitachi is great for everything particularly the balls and just past them at the perineum, while using your mouth, hand, or while he's inside you.<br>  <br>  Yes there's a slight chance that he may get a bit upset at first, just tell him that you're not getting it because he's lacking and you think it'll improve your sex life as a couple and it won't just be for your own pleasure.  Besides, if you get it and didn't tell him imagine the conversation you're eventually going to have when he finds you bought it and didn't tell him.<br>  <br>  Additional Note regarding "nice wives":  <br>  Whether or not he likes it, these days sexual compatibility and communication are very important to the average relationship.  This means that he can't just get off and be happy with it if you're not, a good relationship is about communication, openness, and compromise.  This is something you're going to have to discuss eventually and the truth is that the vibrator has been around for decades, it's not a new and diabolic thing, hell it was used by doctors to ease female patients.  <br>  <br>  As for his opinion of "nice wives" the link below is to a website of very religious very monogamous people who strongly believe that there is nothing wrong with being erotic and sexy and exploratory and kinky, as long as it's with your spouse.  I think that the website, or possibly some of the people on there may be able to help you further.|`|vffZ3is4aa	tell him you have a suprise for him. pull out the vibrator and masturbate while he watches. ask him to play with your boobs and kiss you while you masturbate. then ask him to enter you. hold the vibrator on your clit, and hold it against him. he should like both. there is a finger vibrator that i saw on tv. google it. you can also purchase a co*ck ring vibrator in the drug store. in the condom section. you can put it on him or put it on your fingers. <br>  where are you going to purchase this item? online is the most discreet. you can also find lingerie parties locally. you can have a close friend "give" it to you for a birthday or ?.|`|XzsmYWOqaa	Buy it behind his back.

Sometimes I am too tired to keep it going after I have come so it is easier to turn it over to the toy--which never gets tired, and she can come and come and come.  Now married again, one of the first things purchased for my wife was a vibrator for her, something she never had.  It is magic.  Have it.  Even with a stud of a man, you will find great pleasures.  Good question.  Hope you get more specific help from women on how to convince him.  But not telling is probably a mistake.

bItFniLxaa	It may seem ideal, but in reality, he may just be scared to lose you as a friend because you have become such good friends. That is the danger of dating your best friend. Maybe you could tell him that no matter what happens you have to both promise to be best friends. If you break up and it's awkward, promise that you'll forget the past and just remember when you were best friends. Ask him why he feels this way and maybe he'll be convinced to try it.

He is being a jerk|`|GpWM0xmCaa	you should invite him somewhere for a weekend just you and him -- but don't make any moves just wait for him to realise you are perfect for him :) good luck|`|AA12117694	invite him over|`|mihWeL6Aaa	No, he doesn't see that it means something that you still want him after all of that. He's a guy. He knows that you still want him, but he doesn't 'get it'. <br>  <br>  I'm assuming that you guys have a 'friends with benefits' sort of relationship, since you were hooking up. He just got out of a relationship and doesn't want to get back into another one when he can get all of the benefits of a relationship with you as a friend, without the commitment. <br>  <br>  So basically, there's nothing you can do to make him see that having a relationshp with a best friend is ideal. You could throw yourself at him by acting desperate, but then he would think that he controls you, so that would be know good.<br>  <br>  Guys just aren't into the 'relationship' thing like girls are.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!|`|fvjLWUmiaa	i am in the exact same situation!<br>  im trying to show him that i will always be here for him as a friend....<br>  :/ good luck though|`|Njgof6hNaa	Having a best friend is great, but that doesn't automatically make them bf material. Sometimes that just makes them a really good friend. You need to respect yourself and create higher standards. You shouldn't have to settle for second place in someone's heart. It might be prudent to remember that just because he's no longer with this other girl, it doesn't mean he wont find someone else. He doesn't love you as more than a friend, which is what he's trying to help you understand. Accept that and hold out for someone who wants to be both a friend and a lover. You'll be happier for it.
N7gOE1btaa	The first night you have sex with your new husband, act as though it is your first time.  Pretend it hurts just like the first time and so forth.  If your husband is weird and notices that you don't bleed and what-not, then you can explain how girls can break their hymen through a number of activities--such as sports or particularly horseback riding.  If you wish to hide this from your husband, then stick to that plan.|`|AA11363680	This isn't something you want to hide from a future husband. That's a pretty big secret to keep. Trust me, he'll be much more upset that you lied about it than about you not being a virgin.|`|zFx7NT2Baa	I doubt very much he could know, but hiding it might be a weight for you. Maybe -- philosophically -- for his benefit -- you can fake it all the way.  Close decision.  If it might help, I once thought the woman I was with and had great sex with might have been a prostitute at one time.  It mattered not, as -- at that time -- I loved her.  Good wishes.|`|28d07970c3adc9d81a00eeb71a258aa1aa	If there was a penetration, there was a blood. And if you did bleed, your hymen was torn. That could indicate you really lost it. And probably, your future spouse would know it. But hymen is just a thin vascular membrane.<br>   Women who bleed due to strenuous exercises like biking or horse backriding do not necessarily mean they are not virgins anymore. Our hymen is a delicate part.|`|W1VqOP83aa	Honestly if i were your husband I'd prefer it this way. The last thing I want on my wedding night is blood all over me just when things get going. Even if you are looking for all that purity stuff (losing your virginity with your virgin husband under some moonlit sky or whatever) then lying about it defeats the purpose. Who wants to start their marriage on a lie? Theres nothing wholesome about that.|`|kEy3W5ydaa	unless you actually had intercourse you are still a virgin...fingering is just foreplay....relax and get yourself educated ...read up on sex and learn what is what...ignorance is not bliss....really educate yourself about everything...get to the library|`|OeGcRJ6Xaa	you are a virgin. you did not have sex ..? <br>  your future husband might suspect your not one though if there is no blood- but not all girls bleed their first time- because from various reasons their hymens broke prior to.|`|mnFTWfCZaa	There are many reasons for a hymen to break; the most common is the use of tampons. Also, hymens vary from woman to woman, they come in different shapes. They're very elastic. You could probably lie and pretend like it's your first time with your future husband, but I think if it's important to you, I would just stop sexual activity you're involved in and be honest with your future husband about your past. Dishonesty ruins relationships. I think it shows more character to just be honest and change what you're involved in than live a lie. Good luck!!! you are a person of value, regardless of your virginity status, don't EVER forget that.|`|9LXXs93haa	Maybe the best question would be,"is it alright to start a new relationship with the man i'm going to marry with all the lies and secret ?"Anyway,it's up to you.If, you're future husband has had a lot of sexual experiences from the past I think he would be able to know.But,there is a theory that even if you lost your virginity and your hymen is not intact anymore,if you hadn't had sex for a long long time your vagina would somehow tighten by itself.From my point of view,this could be possible because the muscle around your pelvic area are not being "pushed and probed" constantly.|`|mjy4oRvDaa	Why lie?  As long as you're STD-free, most guys don't care.  And the guilt will probably eat you up later and you'll end up telling him anyway and he'll be pissed off that you lied and tried to deceive him.  What a bad way to start your marriage.|`|RXmWudcsaa	Thats good you want to keep yourself a virgin till marriage. But you should not lie to your future husband. If you were just with one man than your husband should not be upset about that. Tell him the truth.|`|m40tntLKaa	if he ask's, tell him it was a tampon.<br>  k's right, though, you shouldn't like to him.|`|q6NSzY2faa	just say it tell him youll rock his world|`|ZXxIjIP9aa	yes when u have sex with him
fuia2Z6Maa	be there with him as much as possible that is the greatest present u can give
GrPAEfjpaa	Yeah, I think they are. All you can do is tell them how you feel and if you don't get their respect for your feelings tell them you have no choice but to move on.|`|ucF2xy6Aaa	You should talk to them first. Do some research. Find out what people in your position,with  your amount of responsibilities reasonably makes in your area. Tell them that you can find a job elsewhere or they can pay you comparable to market value. <br>  <br>  It seems like you like your job, but dont feel appreciated. You should also tell them that. List your accomplishments within the company and how you have made it a better business.|`|AA11363680	It's not that they're taking advantage of you deliberately. It's just that it can be hard for some people to really look past the family connection and see you as an independent person. I worked for an uncle and it was like that too, he just couldn't understand that I wasn't just his kid nephew and needed a real, steady job.<br>  <br>  Do some research and find out what kind of salary a person in your position makes at other companies in the industry. Then once you have that information talk to your parents. Be polite, let them know that you don't want to cause problems, but you need to be properly compensated for the effort you put in.<br>  <br>  If you get serious resistance to a proper raise, then it's time to do two things. First, stop working over time, especially if this is unpaid over time you're talking about. Then they'll have to actually be there and will hopefully appreciate your input more. At the same time, it wouldn't hurt to make them consider how much they'd have to pay a replacement if you decided to quit. Secondly, if you get more hassles or guilt trips about that, then it's time to look for other work. But remember, working for your parents will not be as well received as real experience, and you're not likely to get a good reference from your parents if it goes that far. So be prepared for the consequences if you decide to do this, if it's not worth a major family dust up, then don't bother starting anything.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you.|`|mXyqcAy5aa	You need to call a family meeting  asap ,  and let them know how you feel ,   who gets out of bed for $13 an hour ,  come on you must know your worth more than this  .
sLDqymHzaa	I think there is a very strong possibility that he likes you. Very, very strong. And I hang out with mostly girls too, it means nothing. Come to think of it, I hang out exclusively with girls, but, like I said, it means nothing. I've been with the same group of girls for years, and never dated or had interest in any of them, really. Then I met my current girlfriend (which is only the third, so I'm no relationship guru, but that's because I tend to actually consider who I date, I won't go after someone just because they're pretty. Well, I won't go after anyone now, since I'm not single, and I don't at all want to, but that's not the point). Ughh... just talk to him. Engage him, don't make him come to you all the time. Just talk to him a little until you have a better feel. Chances are, he does like you.|`|PDuaJlngaa	HELL TO THE YES|`|CaDrjGoVaa	pshh  im not readin all that!|`|VdcoHfN1aa	i'd say he either likes u and wants to have a relationship, or just wants to be friends. coming up to u and talking to you most likely means he noticed you and wanted to get to know you better. if it seems like to me that he likes you, so try to make him realize ur into him. that way if he's too shy to ask u out himself, you'll reassure him that u like him in the same way.|`|MqoOPi9Xaa	Well I am kind of a loser when it comes to girl but my freshman year there was this girl i really liked. I would get so nervous around her that I couldn't say a word to her. I mean I thought she was really good looking and stuff but when she tried to initiate conversation with me, I would give 1 word answers and it was really embarrassing. I eventually started avoiding her because I didnt want her to think i was a loser. Eventually i grew some balls and started talking with her and i even asked her out after a while. Some things just take time i guess. If you really want to know if he likes you, if you're really good friends with one of his friends ask him if he thinks your hot or if he likes you.|`|AA12117694	he prob does like you some way

j0mI8l07aa	Well, first off stop treating her like she's at a job interview. At a job interview they ask you a short question and then expect you to talk about yourself for awhile, just like you are doing. Don't just bombard her with questions. Talk to her like you already know her, and she will eventually tell you about herself. For example:<br>  If you go to dinner, talk about the food, talk about the restaurant decor, tell her a funny story about something that happened to you at a similar restaurant or somethin'. You know...pretty much the same things you would do if you were dining out with a buddy, except be polite.<br>  It's common knowledge most girls like to talk about themselves. After you stop acting like a nervous weirdo that's deciding to hire her or not, she'll loosen up and tell you ALL about herself.<br>  Not trying to be harsh, just trying to help. A LOT of guys have this same problem. I had this exact same discussion with a buddy of mine like a week ago.|`|AA12117694	Gee..now I know why my dates fail lol:)..you have to let the woman know that you have balls to curse in front of them and such, dont be P whipped just because you got her on a date, be yourself.|`|93JgYS4Vaa	first of all - PLEASE learn to spell.

A) don't use ANY pick-up line.they all suck. B) talk at school or wherever u are when ur not dating. This gives you a chance to learn about each other in an environment ur both comfortable in. And C) spend more time listening than talking. Unless she has been given the same advice, the conversation should go quite nicely because everyone's favorite topic is themself. Good luck!|`|TyqGdBw1aa	you can't just let them do all the talking. don't be afraid to relate yourself to some of their interest but don't be fake. and learn how to make people laugh. that way you don't have to worry about awkward silences, you'll both be laughing too hard to talk. but don't over do it or they'll think your a spazz. bring them on more casual dates... a walk, a movie, to get ice cream, to go to the mall, or even just on an "adve|`|DAdtxwPiaa	ok..<br>  well one thing i notice that i like about guys is when they do things that most guys think make them look like sissys.make sure u give compliments. but not too much then youll look a little weird. but throughout the date give a compliment here, a compliment there.<br>  <br>  uhm.. just dont give up and keep trying!

Only god had told I will bless those who believe in me even though they have not seen me.Loving a person without seeing him or knowing him and his background and education is like falling into a pit full of cow-dung.  Man chosen should be wise thoughtful lovable and admirable and educated and knowledgeable because he is the one who is going to drive the home for you and you are the home maker for him.  Trust is based on his background and family background. There are so many cases of men even though married to one would have sex and other relationship with others.  And if a women does it he would consider her as a prostitute.  So get to know his background and his family and know him more then take the proposal for him don't jump for your emotional pleasure  Never make any mistake because life once lost will not come back.  It is not ur examination where you can pass once more.|`|K6TeDfEZaa	This is REALLY not enough info to go on, but here goes.<br>  Technically, anybody who is working toward your happiness or general well-being is 'loving' you.<br>  That being said, you are relying on 'his' idea of love and his understanding of his own feelings. This is where caution comes in. You can't be sure you share the same understanding without putting yourself at risk.<br>  What's worse is that usually in chat sessions, people give all the info that is required to see vulnerability and to take advantage of it.<br>  Hope for the best, plan for the worst..

Honey, you need to get a grip here.  What happened to your friends and family?  And how did getting a divorce help your financial situation here?  My suggestion is that you make an effort to get your friendships back on track, get yourself a job while your kids are in preschool and work toward finding a way to get out on your own away from your ex.  You are not stuck with each other, although it might feel like it right now.  He is your ex-husband, he does not owe you empathy, so there is nothing to retaliate about.  Your time and energies would be better served getting yourself omn track instead of trying to find a way to get back at him.  Do some growing up.

mCQZrp1zaa	Well, getting to know her name/number might be a good start.<br>  <br>  There's always the direct approach, go up and intro yourself to her. If you're not comfortable with that, try and find a mutual acquaintance to break the ice between you.<br>  <br>  Good luck:)|`|Xz0KHqFWaa	first, try to befriend with her friend and classmates. and try to help her with her homeworks to be close to her. and afterwards, ask her out.|`|55CpRJDvaa	It would be a little awkward if someone just asked "Hi, I don't know your name but do you want to go out with me?"<br>  It doesn't make much sense, you know?<br>  <br>  <br>  Start by getting her name.<br>  And then get to know her.|`|TgIDludAaa	Get to know her first. That's probably always the first step before a relationship. Unless she likes guys that are younger than her, you shouldn't have any problems. My first boyfriend was in a grade higher than me, and it didn't really matter.
70n6WkrMaa	I really think uou should confront her, I have been in this situation before and i confronted the problem and the person who was my friend who was being a bi*ch to me realised what she was doing and fixed the problem and she also respected me more.<br>  <br>  hope i could help.|`|wseP86qSaa	She is not your friend. That's not what friends do and most friendships have a natural end, it seems this one has already met it's demise. There are many nice people out there who will be kind to you and you can have a really fulfilling relationship. But you have to meet a lot of people to find a few that are really compatible with you. Go out, a lot of people won't end up being your best friend, but eventually you will find someone who was always meant to be your BFF...

But after reading your story I could totally relate.  My ex was the same way.. Sadly I found out it was because he had been cheating.  I had no idea he treated me so good.  I didnt find out until after he died that he had been cheating.  Anyway I could be wrong but most guys thrive on sex... Ask him, see what he says, see how he reacts to your question.|`|pawJiFnHaa	When I was married the first time I had this problem toward the end of the marriage, and it wasn't that he didn't want sex, he just had moved on emotionally and didn't want it from me.  When your not in the moment try talking..... talking being the operative word... and see if you can find out the problem. Make him feel as if he is leading the conversation and maybe he will spill the beans. Maybe its not you at all, maybe he just doesn't feel like it or has other issues he hasn't shared with you yet. If it continues and you find your self-esteem getting worse I would end it, is having sex worth you happiness.  If all else fails, buy a vibrator.|`|srAP6Vzvaa	ok *IF* your attractive and u can turn heads at the market, shopping center etc etc then the problem is not you. Some people, to my suprise even Males, have LOW SEX drives. that's just the way they are. it's not a his fault or her fault situation. it's just his hormones. his bio-chemistry/testosterone is just an output of a low-sex drive and this is clearly seen after the relationship settles down a bit.  Myself i was with gf for 3 yrs and we were having sex 5 days a week for all those 3 yrs. i have a high sex-drive and so did she. in this area we were very similar and it was contributing factor to our long term relationship.  lack of compatibility of sex-drive between partners can be a stumbling block in the relationship.
viCPQmuTaa	sweetheart i understand you are very upset with your dad with good reason.but addressing your dad with that frustration is not going to help him hear you and thats what he needs to do. when your dad is calmed down you need to tell him how you felt about needing him there for you do it calmly and be honest. talking with one another is the best tool. i hope he listens to you. remember timing is key when addressing your dad. good luck.  your friend dee.|`|kF17iSn3aa	if there is a family member &/or a neighbor or maybe someone you trust near by, go to them. if not see if you can contact a friend or family member to come get you.<br>  <br>  get something just incase you need to defend yourself & sit somewhere safe (maybe a locked room) until someone can get you.<br>  <br>  if you're really scared call the cops.|`|pmbDmKlAaa	call the cops or some family now. and try to get the police or courts to let you live with someone else.|`|shcsSIRwaa	call the cops!! or your grandma someone your close to|`|Jll0o2L6aa	call kids help line or you could ring one of your family members and tell them|`|c2d4ea1419665dbcd55eece87c19c360aa	call cop|`|iUsd7cCSaa	go to a neighbor you trust, or call a relative that lives close by.<br>  if you truly think he will hit you, call the police. just get yourself safe.|`|yxhnFE9gaa	WTH why did he make you walk home? <br>  Call kids help phone
M26erHBOaa	Dear, you're finding out the difficulties imposed by social norms on same-sex relationships.  I would suggest that you first find out if a girl is either bisexual or lesbian, and then approach her.  Most heterosexual girls will not consider going out with another girl.  This is especially true in small communities where same-sex relationships are rare or non-existent, at least openly. <br>  I know it is frustrating.  <br>  Try to become really good friends before you even suggest the possibility of a relationship, and find out if the girl is open minded when it comes to same-sex relations.  If she isn't, respect their opinion and find someone else.  Remember, respect and tolerance is a two way street.<br>  <br>  Elite<br>  <a href="http://elitesblog.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://elitesblog.blogspot.com</a>|`|mzP474FTaa	I have to admit that I was confused a bit as to whether you are a girl or just a man cursed to go through life minus one appendage. <br>  <br>  I suggest getting involved with a LGBT group where you can meet people who ARE interested in the same sex and know it. That way you can skip the melodrama involved with trying to open up someone else's sexuality.|`|6Sdq4KJeaa	-Hi five- Welcome to reality.<br>  Y'see, there's these people who can't accept the same sex because they believe it's utterly wrong when it's completely your own choice. Hey, I'm bisexual. Whether you have a dick or not doesn't matter! Find someone who is bisexual.|`|fV2SYj60aa	Um, they are straight.  Sorry.  It just works like that.  I know it sucks but you just gotta keep an eye out for other lesbians and bi girls.|`|O39Y1RZ4aa	I don't get it. You a transsexual or what?|`|FUoKu13Daa	Before you thumbs down me,  I think most people believe and naturally follow the pattern of male and female relationships.<br>  <br>  I could have another guy basically wipe my butt with kindness but in no way I would go out with him in a romantic way because I do not feel that way or get excited having sex with another man.<br>  <br>  So in saying this you feel that all people or especially girl feels the same way you do about relationships and from what I hear that is just no true.<br>  <br>  I know girls who experiment with same sex  and I would not call them bi because it is usually an experiment and almost all of them eventually settle down with a male partner so I think deep down I think you are approaching women who deep down do not want a relationship with a women like that but perhaps like the kindness of a woman.<br>  <br>  I think you need to approach women who are bi or gay and perhaps leave the women alone who seem to want or believe in a male and female relationship.|`|cg25f4vmaa	Soooooo... are you a girl?<br>  <br>  I'm confused.

And no your not ugly, of course your brothers are going to say those things, they're boys.

My brother is 24 now and still tells me hes going to spy on me when im out with my boyfriend.

Good luck hun.|`|9jYzeo5xaa	It sounds like your brothers are just young and immature and trying to be tough guys as part of a coping mechanism for their insecurities as teenagers. Right now it's going to be all about themselves and they don't really care how it effects anyone else because they are not thinking of anyone else. My brother went through that phase. However they do seem to be taking it to a larger degree of meanness. The only thing you can really do is tell your parents what they have been saying to you and how they treat you and how it makes you feel. If anything maybe you will have to have some time away from them and stay at a relatives house.|`|Fb5bUmMnaa	I have four sisters and did the same thing as a child. I love my sisters to death and would do anything for them and he would for you as well if needed. If you ignore your older brother and never respond and act like you could care less what he thinks you will find he will most likely back off. Now as far as your younger brother goes he is most likely scared of his brother and does it to keep him from harassing him. I would try to get your younger brother switch sides by doing things for him, bribes, helping him and if he is being tormented by his brother stand up for him. But remember in a couple years your older brother will be at your mercy when he wants to meet your friends.|`|k4eJr0aKaa	Your not fat. <br>  Listen i have a brother and i guess we used to fight all the time, although your situation seems worst, im 15 and my brothers 16 so we are kinda close. But we used to fight! haha<br>  Have you spoken to your parents about it? If not you really should and if so then why can't they see that they are winding you up? <br>  Trust when your older brother gets older and is more interested in girls and other things he will start ignoring you and concentrating on other things. And just become really close with your younger brother. Like help him out with homework, play with him, watch tv and movies and hopefully he will see how much nicer you are rather then your other brother. <br>  hope that helps. sorry if it doesn't<br>  Good Luck!|`|dat8eoYyaa	then what color eyes do u have u r super pretty and 95 is so not fat !  like 130 is fat|`|fdoOKetgaa	i know you're not fat.<br>  just pump some iron , work out, become stronger in a few more months, and beat the hell out of them.

AA10181796	I hate to tell you this, but it doesn't change. My boyfriend and I are in our 40s. He talks dirty to me a lot and his voice ... well... yummy! He's crazier than me (way way) and he doesn't think I talk enough. <br>  <br>  As for what to say to her, try telling her a little story. Put the two of you in it. Maybe use one of your fantasies. (you don't have to tell her it's a fantasy if you don't feel comfortable doing that) At first you will feel awkward, and it will seem silly. But close your eyes and concentrate on your words. Once you get into it, and she reacts positively, I think you'll be OK.<br>  <br>  Good luck! Have fun!<br>  <br>  If it turns out you're way to uncomfortable with the whole thing, it's OK to tell her that, too. Pleasure should be a 2 way street, with both partners enjoying WHATEVER it is that's going on.

If you are young enough that you still have to listen to your parents, then this relationship will be difficult to say the least. Not impossible, just difficult. <br>  <br>  Now, if he really feels the same for you, since he is a grown boy, he will find his way to see his sweetheart.

Now you can learn English for free from the comfort of your home using the internet. The BBC and the British Council offer a number of online courses which teach written and spoken English. You can also improve your English by watching television programs and reading English newspapers.

AA10774810	Ok I'm sure I'll sound like a real snob but believe me this works....<br>  <br>  Remember that these are things to just simply make you phyiscally look happier, not so that you'll fit in or look like everyone else.  I'm a big believer in doing what you want for you and no one else.  <br>  <br>  Get a good tan-- how many tan people do you know that look unhappy?  I don't know any.  They usually look like fun.<br>  <br>  Wear white and pastel tops at least if not pants and skirts too-- this brings out the tan and inadvertently and subconsciously makes you feel happier.  Colors have a huge impact on emotions.<br>  <br>  Drink more water to whiten the whites of your eyes-- this brightens up your face and eyes which of course makes you look happier in general.<br>  <br>  Whiten your teeth-- not only does this brighten the smile, but its attractive (I don't know about you but I don't really find yellow teeth attractive).  This also boosts your confidence and will motivate you to smile more frequently, especially to show off your newly whitened teeth!<br>  <br>  Get a good bronzer or blush and apply to cheek bones; not under and not over, but right on the cheek bones and apply it in an upward motion toward the tops of your ears-- This creates a smiley look on your face without having to even smile.  Make sure the blush is not a "line"; it should blend in with the rest of your face and it should be applied heavier on the balls of the cheeks. <br>  <br>  Always wear lip gloss-- brightens smile and compliments newly whitened teeth.<br>  <br>  Always wear mascara--- opens the eyes.  Recommend eye liner as well but only if you know how to apply it.  If you do, try extending the liner a tad bit past the lid in a upward curling way.<br>  <br>  Wear body spray; I don't recommend perfume because often its too strong for you and those surrounding you-- perfume boosts confidence; its nice knowing that you don't smell funny, also try Love Spell by Victoria Secret.  Its about $8 and smells wonderful, people will compliment your fragrance.|`|592c83d36eab87ebc9e61f1ca9c671c6aa	i suppose if it bothers you, just be more friendly. smile when you see people, and start conversation with them|`|8d53736e43629521defe14d9e5da2188aa	forget it|`|AA12276585	Nobody want to make friend with a girl who have an angry face or always moody.

Youre unhappy not because of the people around you, give some space for yourself. Relax your mind, don't complicate things too much. Unwind and have a deserving relaxation by means of having body spa, drink mocha frappucino in starbucks, entertained yourself. You can invite your real friends to watch DVD's at home and spend the day with them just talking..See the difference..|`|AA11796789	try smiling a little bit no one wants to hang out with a sour puss|`|d99832e130a64a06093d4aaedf7fe11eaa	Try smiling. Invite some people you like to the Mall to see a movie. Have a sleep-over pizza party and stay up all night talking about boys. Don't talk bad about others cuz they think you'll do the same thing to them. There are so many things you can try. First thing is to be true to yourself. If you're really sad or depressed about something, get help. There's lots of people to talk to [professionals] who are trained to handle just about any teen problem, I hope you find something that works for you. Take care,<br>  Raylene?

You have to learn that life sucks sometimes but not always and the only thing that keeps me moving and avoiding suffering because of my family is that I can feel free, happy and fullfilled when I am not home.  I am very responsible and study hard.  If you do so as well, I am sure you will get a lot of good things in the future.  We all have to suffer to get the best out of every achievement.  Many suffer with autism as your brother and you also have your own cross to carry on your back.<br>  <br>  Good luck and I hope it helps at least a little to know that you are not alone and many others have lots of problems too.

That is the general term. When you talk to a guy, it is when you joke a lot, and tease, and laugh. Also, flirting can be eye contact, if you touch him, and if you compliment him. Flirting is messing around with him, like hitting him, laughing at him or making fun of him. So yeah, basically, flirting is whenever you talk to a guy in a friendly way. i have a really bad problem with flirting myself. I naturally do it, and i don't know when I'm doing it. Be careful because it can sometimes give people the wrong idea. Just stay true to yourself, and know what you do and don't want and you'll be fine. ~|`|dd8581141dd5efde0a5ed78ce5ad591eaa	hi there, what i consider to be flirting is anything that my partner does that doesnt agree with me if u have a partner and u are asking because of this, i would say flirting is touching other than on a need to basis, whispering jokes or saying things in front of people if opposites, trying to impress the opposite sex, or the same if the case...telling the person alot about urself and the same on the other end, comenting on how the other one looks, sometimes even making small chit chat about things can get me jealous of my fiance depending on the situation. if u are the one flirting u would know in ur heart and if its ur partner, the same, u know urself what is comfortable and what isnt...
76c8fb9ed91236f3eb913df9056f4cf3aa	Dont worry about it hun cuz the more u worry about somethin the more its gonna go wrong so just forget about them for a min and they are bound to turn up and if yo mama ask where they at then just tell her what happened cuz moms is usually pretty understanding and if she aint yell at u about a CELL PHONE then a pair of glasses that u only use when yo contacts aint in shouldnt arouse too much anger or w/e in her either.

A friend who you can trust and live out these scenes with you. Living out these thoughts will make your mind grow stronger.I have a female friend who i have known for about 7 years now and she reminds me of you. Over the years she told of her love to behave and do anything that a persons 'pet' would do.  Then 1 day she found in a drawer at my house a nice red dog collar from when my dog was younger. She asked if she could have it and wear it when we were together. On that day I became the proud owner of my new ,and very loyal pet.  A pet who only wants to make her owner both happy and proud. I would love to talk more with you.

Il m'arrive de me faire piéger, mais la plupart du temps, je vérifie, c'est assez simple: un vrai troll répond rarement, et surtout toutes ces questions sont du même moule, provocatrices et simplistes.<br>  <br>  Dans la rubrique religions -ou politique- les trolls sont moins visibles, parce que certains intervenants réguliers ont des comportements de troll: questions basiques et provocantes, poussant à des réponses précipitées. Donc on baisse parfois un peu la garde, on ne pense pas à vérifier. Mais je réponds de moins en moins à ce genre de questions, troll ou pas. <br>  <br>  Ceci dit, je n'accorde pas à la question une importance essentielle. Ai-je tort?<br>  <br>  PS: dans les trolls, faut-il compter ceux qui se font une guerre à coup de suppression de compte?

For every real female friend I have i have like 10 male friends and I grew up in a household of all male cousins/siblings.  I am most diffenately NOT a lesbian.<br>  <br>  I think the thing for you is that you have a unique look into the other side of things.  I am odd as a woman.  My beliefs and attitudes on things are a little off, but I dont find that a problem I enjoy it.  I love being different.  Examples: I think porn is a good thing, dont think I need a billion shoes and have a hard time waiting for a guy to open the door for me.  The plus side is that I understand the need for guys night out, know that when my man checks out another woman its nothing to be upset about and I ended up being much more even tempered.<br>  <br>  For you the metrosexual thing has many elements.  I am sure if you look at it you will be able to pin point the things that you are happy to have instead of the standard male tendencies.  You really do have much more of an advantage then a disadvantage and you should reveal in that.  It may not help you much while your brain is still programmed into the "highschool" idea of things, but when you start to branch out you are going to see that woman all over are WAITING FOR YOU!<br>  <br>  You have the knowledge to pamper them and know what the standard woman would go crazy over it.  Love it, use it and be proud.  I am sure you're female friends have already compared their boyfriends to you and you have be rated on top.<br>  <br>  *HUGS*|`|18ab5ca15239b9bc916473063c05bd51aa	I had a guy friend in high school who also didn't think he was gay, until he had sex with a girl and realized he was definetly gay... He had a ton of girl friends and not very many guy friends.. very very metro sexual...

It's just quite possible that you haven't met the right girl yet ,,,, Stop letting your glands worry you or do your thinking for you ,,,, continue on the way your are ,,,,  Meet as broad a range of girls as you can ,,,,, So that later on you can make a better decision as to who you want a serious relationship with ,,,, I don't know where you got this word metrosexual but I'd forget about that too ,,,, don't be so ready to commit to a life style that you'll regret later ,,,, It just may haunt you in the future ,,,, You are only 19 ,,,, give it some time ,,, don't be so anxious ,,,, Just let nature take it's course ,,,,|`|acae635d8ab8da13bdc8be10422ed813aa	i agree with the first one.|`|f24ad8b6c9908f3c47d4b1c53bd16788aa	I don't think there is anything wrong with you, I think you are a pretty damn lucky guy. That doesn't make you gay. However, if you do have a serious girlfriend, most likely she would wonder why you have so many other female friends and wonder if she could trust you (just a generalization although some really cool confident girls out there aren't that way). You're just probably just more comfortable with women.|`|c6b10f38e2bc195bb8930570f4b614ddaa	its good to have girl friends and besides, most good relationships come from being friends first right?
f24ad8b6c9908f3c47d4b1c53bd16788aa	I think you base your value and all of your love just one on this one young woman and you are sacrificing your well-being for her-because even though she had been hurt by all those useless boyfriends, in a way she was hurting you because she WASN'T with you and was choosing other men! You focused so much on her instead of focusing more on yourself and that is why you feel so emotionally drained... it's a very painful experience, right now I am going through something similar to what you are going through but I understand- you don't feel appreciate because you gave so much to that one person and you seem to also be very obsessed with her instead of her seeing what she is really missing out on. Just remember that people (even herself) can't choose who they love, but they can choose what to DO about it.|`|0009f2b31d719c0129500e1b378b59d9aa	Dont worry, life will get better. I know it must suck that she didnt agree to love you the same as you love her. Its a beautiful thing that you love her, love is special and doesnt come very often, but she must be going through a rough patch and picking the wrong guys. She will learn soon. She obviously loves you as her best friend, and maybe thats how she wants to keep you both. Respect her for that be her best friend but find someone who is the same as you.

I know it isn't the best feeling to be asked out that way, but I think you should go with it.  That is, unless you're already in a relationship.  Good luck!|`|e50e6ca9411acd39c8aec91e4abe2b89aa	It is really hard to tell his motives here. He may be very shy and was just to nervous, or he was trying to see what kind of girl you were. Not all guys are cock hounds. Or he could be a real jerk and just playing games with you. Only you can answer this question you know basically what kind of guy he is.

Entweder aus Liebe oder gar nicht. Mein Meinung dazu.|`|e5f83e53a41074be94200e883442c23caa	Du zahlst weniger Steuern? und wenn du Kinder hast auch weniger, aber da nciht so viele, Ich glaube 7 Prozent weniger wenn du ledigt  bist, und mit Kindern auch 1 oder 2 Prozent, allerdings solltest du erst heiraten wenn du das Geld für die Scheidung zusammen hast ;-)|`|1d45f7bd684e0fdd09e1ab24073386bbaa	Ich erinnere mich an den Spruch eines Afrikaners, der sich furchtbar wunderte, wie schwer deutsche Frauen zu einer Heirat zu überreden waren. In den USA war die Situation anscheinend ganz umgekehrt. <br>  <br>  Durch die Tatsache, dass Frauen in Deutschland durch eigene Arbeit ganz gut ihr Auskommen finden k?nnen, ist der Heirat der wirtschaftliche Anreiz genommen worden. Und diejenigen, die dann trotzdem noch heiraten, haben meistens den Wunsch, einfach mehr Alltag mit ihrem Liebsten zu verbringen. <br>  <br>  Ich kenne eine Familie, in der die Eltern erst geheiratet haben, als sie sich nach 19 Jahren Partnerschaft zu Kindern entschlossen. Es ist vermutlich in erster Linie wegen der Rechte der Kinder, dass in Deutschland Paare heiraten. <br>  <br>  Gelegentlich mag es auch die gegenseitige Absicherung sein, denn immerhin ist der Partner nur dann zu einer Hinterbliebenen-Rente berechtigt, wenn er verheiratet war. Ich wei? von einem Fall, bei dem die Eheleute zur Hochzeit bereits die 70 überschritten hatten. Die beiden wollten sicherstellen, dass der Partner versorgt ist, falls einer von ihnen sterben sollte.<br>  <br>  Ich pers?nlich habe inzwischen eine gewisse Panik entwickelt bei dem Gedanken an Heirat. Meine Ehepartner hatten die Angewohnheit, meine Zeit vollkommen zu verplanen. Ich war wohl auch ein wenig zu hilfsbereit. Aber noch traue ich mir nicht zu, dass ich meine Grenzen dort setzen k?nnte, wo ich sie nun einmal brauche. Aber das k?nnte mir ohne Trauschein genauso passieren. Mit oder ohne Formular kann man sich beim Zusammenleben ganz sch?n ?rger einhandeln.<br>  <br>  Ohne Partner habe ich den Vorteil, dass ich beispielsweise am Computer sitzen kann, w?hrend meine Kleine schl?ft, ohne mich deswegen rechtfertigen zu müssen. Aber ich will damit die Vorteile einer Beziehung nicht madig machen. Die Kunst besteht darin, sich auf die jeweiligen Vorzüge der eigenen Situation zu konzentrieren und diese zu genie?en.<br>  <br>  Da Frauen und M?nner vor dem Gesetz gleichgestellt sind, kann es durchaus passieren, dass eine Frau an den schlechter verdienenden Mann Unterhalt zahlen muss, wenn es zu einer Scheidung kommt. Es ist also wirklich eine Vertrauenssache, ob man diesen Schritt wagt. <br>  <br>  Leider hat der Staat ein finanzielles Interesse daran, dass die Leute heiraten. Und weil immer weniger Paare diesen Schritt wagen, weil sie wirtschaftliche Einbu?en befürchten, versucht der Staat die existierenden Lebensgemeinschaften so zu legalisieren, dass sie beinahe einer Ehe gleichgestellt werden. <br>  <br>  Ich würde also an deiner Stelle gut überlegen, ob du mit jemandem zusammenziehst, weil das beinahe schon die rechtlichen Konsequenzen einer Heirat hat. Wenn du also vor einer Heirat Angst hast, solltest du das Zusammenziehen genauso fürchten...<br>  <br>  Ich würde zwei Dinge genau unterscheiden:<br>  <br>  a) Heirat ist ein offizieller Akt, der im Grunde nicht viel mit der Beziehung zwischen den beiden Menschen zu tun hat. Es geht mehr um die Frage, wie sich das Paar zur Gesellschaft stellt.<br>  <br>  b) Die Verbindlichkeit einer Beziehung bedeutet, dass beide Partner einander treu sind. Es gibt Paare, die das locker sehen und zumindest vorgeben, dass es ihnen nichts ausmacht, wenn der andere mal woanders "reinschmeckt". Meiner Meinung nach aber betrügen diese Menschen sich selbst um die Erfahrung einer wirklich intensiven, lebendigen und entwicklungsf?higen Beziehung, die nur auf der Basis der Ausschlie?lichkeit wachsen kann. Denn sie ben?tigt das absolute Vertrauen, also die Umgebung, in der man sich vollkommen fallen lassen kann...<br>  <br>  Wenn dich das Thema einer wirklich lebendigen Beziehung interessiert, empfehle ich dir das Buch "Was Frauen glücklich macht - und was M?nner wissen müssen". Es beschreibt die Entwicklung zum "Wilden Mann", dem Gegenstück zur "Wolfsfrau". Ist hochinteressant und nützt auch dem, der lieber unverheiratet bleiben will...|`|393deea993caf0eded06c11d5a6db3eeaa	frage einmal deine Lohnsteuerkarte,aber anscheinend verdient du genug.|`|cd7e62767f7d238052a944f361933b71aa	statistisch gesehen leben verheiratete m?nner l?nger und sind zufriedener als unverheiratete ....<br>  <br>  bei frauen ist das leider umgekehrt, also streng dich an ;-)|`|dff411e0e2e9352ea3d16995c9b31e98aa	..Sorry, aber wie ich finde eine bl?de Frage..<br>  <br>  Heirate, wenn du die Frau deines Lebens getroffen hast und du dir nicht mehr vorstellen kannst ohne diese morgens aufzuwachen!!!<br>  <br>  Ansonsten lass es lieber; gibt schon genug Scheidungen!!

So its natural to be shy about it, dont worry about pursuing guys if u dont feel comfortable doing it. This guy that seems like hes into you, will ask you out eventually if he truly is interested. However if he doesnt (if hes shy like you maybe) i suggest that u rack up the courage to ask him if he wanted to go out sometime, if u reallyyy reallyy like him :) By the way by not asking out guys doesnt hurt ur chances with them. Good girls are hard to find so good guys find girls ie. U, that dont have guys left right and centre, attractive lol|`|bdd76cdec349f616dd1b6647c6d10818aa	I disagree.  If a guy is interested in you enough, he will ask you out.  If you wanna go out with a guy, you should let him know you want to go out with him by saying things like, "I'd love to go see the movie!" or something like that.  Let him come up with the next line "Do you want to go see it with me sometime?"  (You know what I mean.)

Come to a compromise.
b698b005334e51f7a33c884bde100c2caa	Honestly, to be a girl wandering in the mall with friends is one of those couldn't get any better moments, so when a boy does that to me or one of my friends, the boy has to be lookin pretty good - good enough that I would be willing to split away from my friends just to go and talk to him. Do you know what I mean? I'm not trying to be cross, or angry with your question, I'm just speaking pure truth: First impressions last only for the looks. <br>        And for the future thing afterwards. Well, if you've gotten that far with a girl (ie:got her attention) you should definately take special care into looking at her personality. Because if you don't and you do something she doesn't like, she's out! I personally love guys who start with something small. Like walk over to her, or have her walk over to you, either way, and start with some flirty small talk - compliment her but NOT about her body. Say something nice about her smile or her shoes. THAT always gets me and my girls. The more you talk, the easier it is for her. She gains confidence. Then she'll start to talk and eventually she'll lead the next move. Oh, and what I said about personality - that's the best advice I could give.|`|68be9523a93b37cc41e28bb15f9ab833aa	no. if you want her, be a man and step up. she wont turn you down. you're brave for steping up. girls like the confidence, just dont be cockey.

Whatever. I don't plan on getting back with him though. We're both in our twenties by the way but even then there are still some immature things that don't change!

It'll be easier for him to get over it if you tell him exactly what it is.<br>  <br>  I think you should get to know him, not datewise yet i guess.<br>  <br>  Just be friends and maybe feelings will build on that.<br>  <br>  Hope i helped. :)|`|jHskGhIwaa	First of all, you shouldn't be posting this question, you should be barring up your windows.<br>  <br>  Second, go to the cops and file for a restraining order.<br>  <br>  Third, purchase a 9mm fire arm and some ammo.<br>  <br>  Fourth, send him a return letter saying thanks, but no thanks. After this, expect him showing up at your door, thats why I posted step 3. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|DFSHoO4uaa	u obviously   want to break it down nicely so just say i'm not ready for a relationship yet it's a sweet thought though but don't give him false hope just let him no in a calm way, hope it goes well!|`|aMGfRum0aa	If you are not comfortable to date yet, then just tell him no thanks. It's perfectly acceptable that you don't want to date or get in a relationship, so don't fret about it.|`|j4PwaY5Jaa	well if ur not into him then just say im not really ready for a relationship right now sorry but... it seems like he is really formal and sincere|`|jGKGlxAuaa	Send him a return letter, thanking him for the invite but no thanks.|`|Fmwd8ykiaa	Um well tell him you dun want a relationship and you don't know him

I have seen nice guys become complete jerks when they're with their friends or there's another guy around they can compete with.  They hit on girls, they do stupid things, they make stupid bets all to look good to the boys.  They have a side that is for their buddies and a side that is for a girl they like and care about.  And those two sides have always been complete opposites in my experience.|`|0a4bc503549a2426c4835a4913653e4caa	i have no idea why we do that,<br>  the mood and chemistry just changes when you hang out with different people.<br>  so if your hanging out with your girlfriend and some friends come over to you, your attitude is going to change. and you might act weirder or quieter or louder. etc.<br>  i think. idk im stoned|`|tiT0plNGaa	thats a good question.
ozngXg9waa	It seems to me that you value your relationship with this guy more than the relationship you have with your friend. <br>  <br>  I would suggest that you give it a little time to make a decision like terminating your friendship. You said yourself, "he's only a guy." But now you are flirting with the idea of ending a relationship with a friend over this guy. Perhaps your feelings for this "guy" are more that you expected. Perhaps the relationship with the friend and you have some underlying issues in your relationship that you need to sit down at talk about, or figure out on your own. <br>  <br>  Whatever the case, I'd advise you to allow a little time to heal over the situation. Is a guy that might not be that interested in you (seeing that he stopped talking to you) in the long run worth dropping a previously existing friendship. Only you can really answer that one. <br>  <br>  I say it's not wrong to be hurt over the current events. If this friend was willing to sabotage your relationship with the guy and ultimately with her, then you might consider finding friends that you will be able to trust. Lastly, talk to her about the situation. If you are going to change your friendship relationship with her, it is best to be clear with your closure process. It's better for you because you don't have to walk around letting a bitter root grow and grow inside of you. You will all be able to, either make up, or clearly move on.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.<br>  ~La|`|yMD13bMTaa	You shouldn't let a guy come between you and your friend but if she was really your friend she would have told you the truth and not talked alot of ****.

Not trash you to your crush. It was wrong of her to do that. But I also don't think you should go out with this boy either because he ruined you girl's friendship. a friendship that probably won't ever be the same. <br>  <br>  It's not wrong of you to be mad at your friend though.|`|JWNzoksmaa	no that's not wrong of you at all. i wouldn't be the beotch's friend either.  That's not a friend anyway.  My advice is to talk to the boy and let him know you're not mad at him and you that you're not gonna be friends with this girl anymore b/c you feel that she's not a very good friend.<br>  <br>  Seriously, find a new friend and/or friends.  she's not worth your time.|`|IKpwMXTlaa	no id be pissed to. but dont just drop her as a friend. tell her why you are mad at her and if she doesn't say sorry or acts like she doesn't care well then maybe you are right and shes not a real friend.|`|GoABmevnaa	um... that was 1 huge sentence, and there was no question mark anywhere in there.

pFeXjeIcaa	That's sweet. Maybe you should start with the little things like holding hands. Then when you're in public you can hold hands  or hold her waist. Then when you get comfortable you can kiss her gentlly on her hand and face. I know she will enjoy this and you shouldn't feel as shy.

Get to know her better and you'll realise she's just like one of your friends.|`|Upxov914aa	shyness is natural. It's a part of you. Don't try to pretend to be someone you're not, you'll just cause problems for yourself and the people you care about and care about you. Just be yourself. If you're shy, so what? Your girlfriend understands and loves you anyway, so forget about it. <br>  <br>  Good luck with your relationship!|`|a02156a68a05c7f34f2536089163d008aa	Then dont try to if you're not comfortable with it or try it and see if you can

v09X6trAaa	Gender doesn't make a difference in any aspect of life. Gender is simply the traits associated with being a woman or a man by society. Where did society get the right to tell us how to be men/women?  It doesn't have that right until people start feeding into it.

They will both probably hate you honestly.<br>  <br>  My suggestion, just go out with you and your bf (not with his best friend).  Hopefully, this will help you forget his best friend.

I just couldn't picture it. We're just so much alike that of course we get along well and have similar senses of humor, tastes, and the like that it could easily have been mistaken for romantic love.<br>  <br>  If you don't think you like him any more than a friend, you probably don't.

It might be the infatuation will grow or be terminated when you see how he acts in different situations.

Si bien tu inseguridad se debe más que todo a esta se?ora y no tanto a tu novio, creo que te importa mucho lo que piensan los demás. Yo creo que actuaría muy inteligentemente, es decir, haría comentarios sobre la edad de la se?ora y la tuya en comparación. Le haría preguntas como... qué tal está su salud? a su edad debe cuidarse mucho... eso ya sé que es un golpe medio bajo pero es para que ella se de cuenta de lo que está haciendo. También le diría cosas como... oiga yo veo que mi novio le cae muy bien... a lo mejor podría usted buscarse un novio de su edad y salir los cuatro. A nosotros nos encanta compartir momentos con personas mayores. <br>  Por otro lado, si estás segura de tu novio, pidele a él también que le de un poco de esta medicina, que le hable de ti y trate de hacer comentarios sobre lo mucho que te quiere.<br>  Si nada de esto funciona, pues entonces busca el momento de hablar a solas con ella y dile muy franca y educadamente que por favor se aleje de tu novio, que no te gusta su actitud con él, que sabes que tuvieron algo pero que entienda que ahora él está contigo y que respete su relación. Explícale que a ella no le gustaría que alguien anduviese coqueteando con su pareja y explícale con ejemplos claros lo que no te gusta y pídele que se aleje de él. <br>  Por otro lado, debes tener más seguridad en ti misma., no te conozco pero estoy segura de que cualquier chica de 24 tiene que ser más atractiva que una se?ora de 48 (viste? el doble de tu edad). Si bien hay excepciones, tu tienes una juventud que ella ya vio pasar hace mucho rato, usa eso para mostrar tu dinamismo, tu energía de jóven que ella ya no volverá a tener más. Valórate como mereces y siéntete DIVINA, ya verás que eso se nota.|`|56720eaa9f823d16dc356528637a169aaa	che q feo lo q te pasa pero fijate q en la biblia dice q tenemos q perdonar pero no dice q tenemos q ser boludas a si q aclarale todo a tu novio y si te quiere el va a ser algo suerte ah y si tenes ganas de hablar cuenta conmigo valu_laboca10@hotmail.com|`|351aa87d1003fbf22d4819578db79284aa	Pues si el tuvo algo con ella, como se atreve a decirte que lo olvides y que no tiene nada con ella, eso es sinismo, tu valora, pidele que hable con su mamà para buscarle otro lugar donde vivir a esa mujer, y si estas dispuesta a seguir y confiar en el pues adelante...........el tiene que hacer mucho para ganar tu confianza..........Si realmente te ama, el sabra..........|`|5b98c699011462caf3b65ad3a8a96b5faa	es mejor que abras el latin chat|`|772c5526ea12c73911d6bdee58159f10aa	Es un asunto complicado, te digo como es posible que le estén dando alojamiento en la casa de tu novio?

En mi opinión tu deberías hablar con tu novio y aconsejarle que hable con su familia y le cuente toda esta situación, que me imagino ha de ser muy incómoda para él, que sepan lo que hace, como lo acosa y así que boten de su casa de una vez por todas.  La carne es débil y no vaya a ser que tu novio caiga en las garras del lobo, lucha por lo que quieres, si eres cristiana tienes la mejor arma en tus manos, la oración a Dios, pídele incansablemente que te ayuda a solucionar este problema y que aparte de una vez por todas a esta do?a que en lugar de andar quitándole los novios a las chicas descendetes como tú, se arrepienta y desista de esta maldad que está haciendo.

5P6KWCLJaa	That's when ( the next time you're feeling romantic, ) you grab his face and you take "the lead." If you initiate it then you can start "training" him on the way you like to kiss.

30sL0vjWaa	sometimes, when i guy is ignoring you it means that he just doesnt know what to say and is afraid of making a fool of himself. but in this case, maybe try to get to know him better? or maybe go out(if you're not comfortable suggest a group outing) do not try to hard(cause it'll show) or play hard to get. don't confuse the poor guy for goodness sake! instead act natural and maybe he'll come to realise how great you are!|`|RIeCEEzXaa	try n ask him more about his major or shott just ask him out for a cup of coffee!!|`|6a6eea5cfaa9ce186ee65da5b97bc313aa	dress to impress or just impress him being you it works. <br>   you can try to hang out more with him!

O3x3uecIaa	Well, I've been in this sort of stuff before. And we're together now, believe it or not. We talked online from like 12pm to 6am. It took us like 2 months to come clean to eachother though. What I suggest you do, is ask her if you've done something wrong, or said something wrong. You haven't necessarily blown it, so ignore those stupid answers saying that you have. <br>  It's great that you like her for her as one person and not for her looks. I know the feeling! <br>  The only guy she thinks of when she does that? Oh damn. Aha she must be REALLY into you if she said that. You can't give up! Just be straight, ask her if you said or did something wrong.. Ask her if she likes you! It's better to be straight, because then she'll have more respect for you. Trust me. I've been there. <br>  <br>  So yeah. My advice to you is be straight, talk to her and make sure you don't give up! I think she's just a little bit shocked if anything. Promise. :)<br>  Wish you luck!|`|kmV5MnvPaa	She might have liked you and maybe she is just to the point of "I need to focus on school" now.|`|dGBbFwFWaa	seems like she must have lost interest or either too busy to communicate with u like she used too.. but honestly u dont tell a girl or boy u like them unless your sure and positively sure they like u back the same way.. goodluck|`|vBcqzMz4aa	you blew it mate|`|ez75Yqvvaa	It sounds like she might just like the fact that you like her but doesn't feel the same so she tries to keep you around just in case. *** f*cked up as that sounds.|`|ch8DC4z7aa	Sorry love sometimes us girls are a bit fickle.She's probably interested in someone else now.<br>  <br>  Maybe she was only interested in your personality as you had great phone conversations but the idea of actually being with you is not what she wants and it was just to pass the time.<br>  I know its easier said then done but try and move on and just leave her alone, there's plenty of more fish in the sea.  Who knows, her interest may peak again when she sees that you've backed off.|`|ONAgORxhaa	i dont think you blew it,maybe shes not looking for a relationship or maybe shes worried that she could jeopardise her friendship with your sister by dating you.why dont you call her and ask if shes ok?is something going on in her life thats upset her?|`|2wsv8vz4aa	you creeped her out maybe.

We had a great relationship for a lot of the time.  When we would have our little break ups things would go like you describe.  He had what I called the "I don't want her...you can't have her" syndrome.  When things got too close, he would run, but he totally didn't want anyone else with me either.  If I even talked to male friends, he would go out of his way to be flirty with a girl in my eyesight.  We continuously ran a cycle of make up and break up.  In the end, we are not together.  Why?  Because he didn't want me enough.  I think your ex is kind of the same way.  He still has feelings, but he just doesn't want you enough...yet.|`|1e900b67a138ee09cb70e4097e22cf44aa	Do you have an ex that you're still interested in, but you're unsure if he's still interested? Well, you can find out here. <br>  Steps <br>  1.Talk to him, and if he listens to you without interrupting, and makes little comments about it, he may be interested. <br>  2.Wear new clothes around him and see if he makes any comments like 'Nice shirt, is it new?'. Actually any compliments are good. <br>  3.Steer the discussion to the stubject of your breakup. Does he ever say things like, 'What was I thinking?', (referring to the time you guys broke up), or, 'Yea...', and sounds distracted by remembering the fact you aren't together anymore? If so, then that's a sign he probably still likes you. <br>  4.See if he calls you a lot just to say "hi". This is a sure sign of interest. If he told you he'd call you at a certain time, but he doesn't, he might call you at a different time, and start explaining why he didn't call you at the time he said he would. <br>  5.Talk about other guys and see how much interest he takes. If he asks you a lot who you like, or if he gets really quiet, he might be jealous. If he asks your friend questions about who you are interested in now, if you talk about him, or other questions like that, he most likely want you back. <br>  6.Ask him who he likes, and if he doesn't respond, doesn't want to tell you, or immediately changes the subject, it's probably you. <br>  7.Look at him in his eyes, and if he looks back (for more than 2 seconds), that's another way to tell. <br>  8.Flirt with him, but not too much, and see if he flirts back. Start a 'Fight', by pushing him or bumping into him, and if he hits back, or tries to get a quick feel on you, he probably likes you.|`|AA11172022	tell him to quit trying to make you jealous cause you want a relationship with him and he doesnt with you so tell him to back off<br>  <br>  give him an ultimatum basically<br>  <br>  tell him you aint gunne be waiting around for him|`|e48ea324d2868c896fdd7ddd73002bf1aa	baby, he still wants you..I jus broke up with my gurl recently and i do d same thing too.

Therefore she will say and act in ways that are akward for some situation, such as the one you have stated.<br>  <br>  If not...then yeah...something is up.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|PgbPCUtnaa	She is amazingly clingy.  She thinks the feeling is mutual, that you believe there is some sort of connection between you two.  She also seems to be afraid of commitment, which kinda contradicts her clinginess in a way.  I don't know what to say about this girl.  Maybe she's playing it safe to avoid getting rejected and is hanging onto you because she feels a connection with only you.|`|BsAQE1Hyaa	Just to clarify, do you like this girl? <br>  <br>  If not and your wondering why she feels so strongly about you, when you never really spent much time together, my answer is: You can mean a awful lot to someone, and be a huge part of their life without even knowing about it. Someone can want and love you with all your heart, without even having to know you or you know them all that well. Strong loving feelings can grow even from a distance. <br>  <br>  If you do like this girl and you're wondering why she keeps blowing so hot and cold, then I think maybe she could have been hurt in a past relationship, especially as you say she is not a warm or kind person - this could be the reason, she may have hardened herself because she doesn't want to get close to someone for fear of being let down. She could been scarred from heartbreak or rejection before and now she's afraid of opening up to you. I think you need to have a good talk to her, and try and get all your feelings out on the table. If you feel the same way as her, she needs to learn to trust you and know you won't turn out like maybe a previous lover in her life. Let her know you won't let her down, and you care for her. I could be completely wrong she may just be a girl that likes to play games, but either way I think you need to have a talk with her.<br>  <br>   I take the fact that she said this to you, as a good sign, sounds like shes putting her heart out on the line. I think the balls in court as to how you're going to respond.|`|nb8X0u4Haa	Yes it does sound like you're getting mixed signals from her. You need to weigh the possibility of her being emotionally shy. Usually if a girl takes a step back from you when you're getting too close, it could mean she has trust issues, or commitment issues. She might also be afraid of ruining the relationship (or lack there of) between you two, and she might also be afraid of getting hurt by you. The fact that you say she isn't a warm or kind person tells me that she probably puts on a front so that she won't get hurt by others. But if she said "You have a piece of my heart that will always belong to you", it means that she really, really values you and I think she cares for you deeply. It's complicated and confusing, but if I were you, I'd have a talk with her and I'd tell her how you feel. Then maybe you can clarify some things.|`|tluT02tvaa	Well obviously she has a problem creating solid relationships.<br>  And her heart is in "pieces" not in whole.It seems she knows all she can ever give a person is a piece not a whole heart.So take that with a grain of salt and think nothing more of it.She sees you as a good person,perhaps kind,charming,reliable etc..but not enough promise perhaps in her mind to build a solid relationship upon,hence the two years or more of no definite status between the two of you.She probably does this with other guys too,everyone gets a piece.I wouldn't think much of it.Until her ways change,if ever.Stay friends with her if you wish,since that is all there seems to be between you.|`|7b882f43c0724ab2516a55698652a19daa	Do you mean if she has you in her heart, she has to sleep with you? cant u admire one person from far, and respect or love them?

If you're avoiding telling someone something because you feel guilty about hurting them, that's being selfish on your part.  Just get it out there in the open.  It may hurt but it's better than knowing someone lied to you.

221c18139bc5e0fd18716f967bc198b1aa	Shucks, I dont know how your family structure is, but I would hope you are respected enough in your house to be able to sit down and talk as a family in family meeting style.   I would talk to my dad and tell him what his absensce is doing to you and your moms relationship and pray that God touches his heart to do the right thing for all of your sakes.   <br>  <br>  You can try talking to grandparents to if they are close in your mom and dad's business.  Your mom's about how she is taking it out on you.  Your dad's about how he is always out.    However, it can complicate the situation if you bring uninformed people in the mix, so make some wise decisions about finding some allies to help you in this mess because in the end you are the child and need to respect your parents.<br>  <br>  And also, knowing that your mom is stressed, just try to be as respectful and obedient as possible.  It sounds ridiculously impossible sometimes, but in the end it will pay off in priceless ways.<br>  <br>  Blessings,love|`|144aadfc199bffc4d9dd3b9847b0b76eaa	if mine was not home i would.........<br>  PAR TAY !!!!!!!|`|VzYGXtDgaa	call your dad and tell him you really miss him, maybe on that you can convince him to come home!|`|fHCR7oBXaa	IF HE IS NEVER AVAILABLE, TRY ALL MEANS POSSIBLE TO COORDINATE WITH YOUR MUM SO SHE CAN NOT FEEL THE MUCH LONELINESS|`|uZrjMYPeaa	Just try to go a little easier on your mom.

Your first duty is to yourself and your mother and siblings. Your mother is or is not paranoid that is a judgment left to a shrink.  But she is suffering and if the story you are telling is correct go to a closest relative that you trust or a friend of the family you trust.  Also is would be in the best interest to Pray a simple prayer that God will be with BOTH your parents that they will do the right Thing.  You will have to grow up a lot faster and this incident will  be a very big learning experience to you on not what to do to your family if your ever start one yourself.

I don't know if that really means that he has intimacy issues, but maybe sensitivity issues. I think he needs to remember that you are a woman, comfortable with your body (as well as his), and that you won't tolerate being spoken to that way, especially after being together. Really...??? Like women don't have enough s*** to deal with. <br>  <br>  Put him in check!|`|ba808642a0667193fc002c2bbda18db5aa	He likes 'to get it and go' and probably always has.

I'm rooting for you.|`|52f8c3785edcb1355da4ebfc95945af1aa	If he loved you, you would know it in your heart. Sometimes things that feel like love aren't really. Why would you lie to someone you love?

b5d576eee16eda2431afb7e5b4fc3f89aa	If you do not want drama I say stay away. Getting involved is the drama of the triangle. Also think about this if you were with him would u.want some other female trying to get close.<br>  <br>  Being his friend is not a good idea either, Why? because you are already in the first stage of emotional attachment which is you are attracted. Being his friend is just going to show you more traits that are going to make you more attracted. Now the quick sand of attraction has got you and will be pulling you in. B. 4. u. know it your in toooooooo deeeeeep.<br>  <br>  Go with you first intuition stay away there is someone for you out there. Don't look then they will find you.|`|6c535d30053c8ac2d9d3e2cacf7ec11eaa	stop being a hypocrite<br>  if you really really want him<br>  you have to break them up!<br>  be a bi*ch and make his girlfriend look a bi*ch<br>  so he will leave her and fall for you<br>  <br>  if you cant do this...just give up on him|`|930b4bd54235ffeff427a9133af17c25aa	forget about him.... dont dance with him... just dont talk to him unless necessary...<br>  <br>   avoid him at all times... until you get over him...|`|f24ad8b6c9908f3c47d4b1c53bd16788aa	Just say "no". And if he wants to be with you, wait until they break up. Don't get involved in a lot of drama! And it's also hard to be friends if you have feelings for each other. Just think it over- do you really wanna hook up with someone who is taken?|`|AA11586654	don't flirt with him, and make sure everyone knows that you don't want anything more than friendship from him right now LOL that's for starters! If you want, you can dance with him, but it's not very good on his part that he wants to dance with someone he knows had feelings for him when he's in a relationship|`|ba8470ec0411ddfb1ab033c762f0d647aa	ignore what his friends say and do you can be paired with the guy and still be friends yes his feelings will grow for you after hes spent a good amount of time with you so he may grow to like you as you like him so leave that up to him but if you do hook up make sure hes single okay
f24ad8b6c9908f3c47d4b1c53bd16788aa	Some men (and women too!) do this because they are mentally screwed up. Sometimes it's not even worth analyzing him. It was not your fault that he abused and manipulated you. Just be glad that you got out of it. What I hate about people like that is that they make it look like it was your fault and that you deserved such bad treatment when really what they did was a reflection of yourselves. Take care of yourself.|`|6c4acae1af4f9fbc02be7ea19029dc7caa	guys that abuse women probably were abused by someone in their family at one time, and that is all they know.  <br>  <br>  get away from them as fast as possible, there is a nice guy just around the corner looking for you|`|1f1270461e3e84cf060097c2b9a82409aa	Small penis syndrome.<br>  Insecurity.<br>  Poor sexual performance.<br>  Because their fathers were abusive losers and it is all they know.<br>  Because they secretly want a sexual relationship with their mother but can't and it causes rage.<br>  Because they have always been bullied and the only ones they feel secure enough to bully are women.<br>  <br>  But mostly because they are losers.

Playing you songs at the bar has no meaning other than he plays songs.  His girlfriend is not in anyone's way, if she was she wouldn't be his girlfriend.   You are just fantasizing something that isn't there.  You need to move or on seek therapy.|`|ee990e37c19d643fe6667035763897d1aa	HE MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE FEELING FOR YOU, BUT HE<br>  WITH SOMEONE ELSE.

I just hope that he is not leading you on by doing all those gestures because if he truly is, he's not worth it.|`|4075481677756f049b52c2aac8dc026eaa	there is no such thing as "she is in the way of us getting back together." if your ex wanted to be with you, he would tell his gf to he doesn't want her, he wants you. then he would call you and you guys would get back together. until he does that, it's noone's fault but his own.|`|4f5360f3b1d93365bc903b858aafaaacaa	I kinda have the same problem with my ex. He doesn't have a girlfriend or anything but he still stares at me and tells me he still cares about me. I have come to the conclusion that if he really cared about me he would not have dumped me. I analysed my relationship with him and decided it was not worth losing sleep over him. He hurt me before and he will just do the same thing if i don't move on. I have moved on and so should you. If it is meant to be though it will happen but that is not very likely.|`|749a69195c558381f18e25aa9e3d4f2baa	if you still love him and you think he still love you back..why is he with another girl? try to get some answers on that, either hes trying to replace pain. but never get in the middle of a relationship until the guy does it himself.|`|d22ab39f56747c325b84ff0aff42f8a5aa	and your question was...?<br>  <br>  how can you kill his gf?<br>  <br>  how can you frame his gf?<br>  <br>  how can you move on with your life and forget about him? <br>  <br>  how can you post a question without it actually being a question?...|`|e1d24701c3601f54945d2f7b9e9199d8aa	I think he is a asshole for not only hurting you, but playing with your feelings in such a cruel manner. I bet you anything, that if you cooled it off with him, he would start hanging around you. give him what he deserves...DISTANCE, he is unworthy!!

Wow But i guess if she doesn't mind go for it
f24ad8b6c9908f3c47d4b1c53bd16788aa	That person sounds very selfish (confused, perhaps, but especially selfish). To me that would be the same as having a "friend" want me to be in love with him and always wants me to love him no matter what and be there for him, waiting for him even though he is ignoring me. It has happened to me many times. At least that is how I interpret your question- you're dealing with someone who is selfish. He/she may have feelings for you, but at this point, are those feelings even relevant? Take a look at the bigger picture.|`|b7a8e195d888e3440782523fd35a439caa	games.....walk away quickly|`|AA11028164	Because that person really doesn't love you. He loves the feeling of being with someone, but yet doesn't want to be in a committed relationship either. He wants his cake and eat it to.

With this relationship, when it's good, it's great; when it's bad, it's really a nightmare. I love him anyway.|`|AA10591117	I dated an aries for a while (and I am also a cancer).

Plus people can't help when they were born and what their zodiac is. There are many factors contributing to the success and failure to a relationship and that has nothing to do with astrology.
fa2609bee33130d08fd56e5aab6d7c6baa	LOL first off, you shouldn't whether about whether she can tell the size of your um... penis.  I think that you just have to be confident with what you've got.  Just go out their and grind<br>  <br>  Now if it gets "stiff" its because you either get overexcited or she wants you too, hopefully its the latter.  If she grinds her *** really hard on you penis there is absolutley nothing you can do.  If its your gf i wouldn't worry about it and let her know you've got one.  If its just a friend I would try to be more subtle and hide it.  If its a girl you don't even know or barely know then let her know you've got it.  Who care's if she walks away.  <br>  <br>  PS- with a friend who you may want to take the next step with let her know you've got it and give it back to her|`|0d85eea770a49b42955d341dc1463437aa	wow.

I think they kind off expect it or even like it.|`|f24ad8b6c9908f3c47d4b1c53bd16788aa	When I grind, I could care less about what the guys' size is, as long as we're having a good time and losing ourselves to the music. That is all that matters to me at that point.<br>  <br>  If a guy gets stiff, well, as another poster said, just keep on going! I don't mind if he does. I don't know if it anything between him and I would go beyond dancing but I definitely would keep grinding.

El caso es que él es medio rudo y una noche ella lo reta y le dice: dime algo bonito y él solo responde que es mejor persona con ella. Esto es lo que más se me ha semejado al amor, es camarería, solidaridad conocer los defectos del otro y seguir amándolo y ser más que uno solo. Te hace ser mejor ser humano. Respecto a lo que andas buscando, nadie puede escribirte esa carta, porque solo tú sabes lo que significa para tí.

Just get to know him and see how things progress. Love takes time to develop. It doesn't come overnight. What you are probably experiencing is infatuation.  That's normal. Love is a bond that grows over time spend with your partner. Two weeks isn't long enough to be in love. Neither is two months. <br>  <br>  Just ask him out to the movies or something. It's not rocket science. If he says no, he says no. Then you'll know, and you can move on.|`|AA11372613	y b scared jus let it all out

You sound like a normal person to me.|`|a1dd820fb4f7a967392d966f07fe8893aa	It might be because you never really knew what love is and isn't.  I suggest that you read in the Bible, I Corinthians 13 "The Love Chapter" where it says love is patient and kind and seeks not its own way at the expense of others.  This love isn't boastful or proud and always believes in the positive.  This love is such that it will gladly give its own life to save the life of another.  It says that of faith, hope and love, love is the greatest.  If you have this kind of love operating in your life, the b---- will always be controlled since Jesus said that we are to love our neighbor as our self and to love our enemies.  Try this and see if it doesn't improve your b---- so that she eventually disappears, never more to be seen.|`|78d016f7f371fb4b23c5303c5521d833aa	we all got a little b*tch tucked away in all of us but yes im willing to help anyone who wants it.|`|AA10873294	My kind of girl #########|`|b3c054cf8a809cd78b23404a2feecb7daa	You sound perfectly normal to me!

31a08719d1b54547a260705fec77bb69aa	You need to understand that you met her for a short period of time and did not meet her for quite some time.  You  did not even interact with her once you left the place.  There could have been the possibility of not remembering your face but she definitely recognized you when you told your name.  Probably she knew by face but had forgotten your name and felt afraid of talking to you without knowing your name.  Once you gave your name she immediately recognized you.  She does like you but the likeness needs to be developed by being in touch.  You should get her email address or her phone number and on occasionally talk to her ensuring that you do not pester her much. You need to develop relationship they do not come in a platter.  if you really like her be in touch with her.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.

f64f2f5a0ded3a078f8740af72ec5b47aa	it's natural to be attracted to other people, that doesn't ever go away. But if you love someone you will never act on those other feelings. Love just isn't a feeling, it's an action as well. Love is what gets you through the tough times in a relationship. You can be infatuated with a person and not love them, you find that out real quick when you start going through some tough fights. True love will keep you faithfull to that person no matter what! I think what you feel right now isn't necessarily love, could be but not for sure. It takes time to know if you really love someone in that sense. That's why there is dating. Dating will lead you into your answer!|`|bfd715bd505d45a8f80b5d9c20471882aa	at your age it is very normal.|`|dded72e69e9973e441099c681fb6fa8eaa	yes|`|4b6c525cc4b0099eb287e9263df0cf4eaa	Yea its possible,mainly becuase yall are only friends,if yall were more than friends,you probably wouldnt have feelings for other guys.|`|AA11584965	When it comes to love there is no thinking. You just know. If you have to question it you're not in love. You're showing all the typical sighns of a crush. You're close to love but not quite.  Being in love is not noticing anyone else, the only thing in the world that matters is the two of you. You dont see another guy across the room and wonder what it would be like to be with him. Of course you're going to notice if someone is attractive, that's human nature, but you wont think about actually being with another person because you're so happy. You may not be in love, but you're close. You'll know when it happens.|`|rSEBXX5faa	It is extremely normal to love someone and also like others at the same time. If you decide to date your friend it is still fine to like other guys, but depending on your possible relationship its not always appropriate to act on those feelings. It's also possible to love your best friend even if you don't want to take it any further than that too.

In fact you should be glad. Some guys don't even ask and they start 'doing stuff' right after the first date. If you don't want him to do it anymore because it's annoying, or you just think he shouldn't be asking; tell him that you're comfortable with him and you wouldn't mind if he doesn't ask you as long as it doesn't get too far. Tell him that you would tell him to stop if you're not sure about what he's doing, so he doesn't have to ask.<br>  <br>  You've only been going out for two months. If he's shy by nature, he's probably just being cautious because he doesn't want to overstep his boundaries, make you uncomfortable, or loose you. just reassure him that you trust him and that he doesn't have to ask you anymore.|`|E6UuilRSaa	I have a similiar question like that.

I think the best way to stop this behavior would be by showing him that he doesn't have to ask. Show him all the things you want him to do (of course do this with out making it into what it is), for instance: if you like him to kiss your forehead then tell him "I love it when you kiss my forehead", or if you like him to hold your hand say to him "Hey Hun, I would love you to hold my hand". He'll eventually catch on and not need the need to ask anymore because he'll already know you like it.|`|wGsLmCnIaa	Atleast he asked first.

93yBLYoraa	The basic (no proof required answer ) is that 95% of the time if you think your spouse, girlfriend,boyfriend (or whatever you want to call them) is cheating they are. People don't feel this way for no reason usually.... The signs can be different in every occasion and you are the best person to see the signs. Most the time the tells are lack of wanting to be intimate, when they are on the phone only talking in yes and no type of words, changes in hygiene, changes in things they like to do and on and on.... The possibilities are endless. Iam sorry to say that once that trust is gone weather they are cheating or not it can end a relationship, because if you believe she is it doesn't matter if she is or not.|`|88f45f8f5e57406a1a787ce3508f9c12aa	well, they aften go out and say there with there friends, they are no.|`|AA11618215	well remember you find what you look for.  trust her and ask her for sure|`|17e9dd5261b81da256fe99427e074568aa	She gets colder.<br>  She talks differently.<br>  She goes out "with the girls" more then ever before, making herself prettier then you've seen her in years.<br>  When you try to talk to her about it in an open honest way she is not leveling with you, she is not looking in your eyes, comforting you, instead she tries to rise above you, diminishing it, and diminishing you.<br>  She gets annoyed at you when you want to cuddle with her.<br>  She doesn't want to get intimate with you.|`|EsxYozQ2aa	she is still whit you... so she is cheating... only if she is single she does'not..sorry but life reality|`|RIeCEEzXaa	less affectionate, close to less or no sex, always on the phone or always out....or just plain out distant. or just ask her!|`|MgpPKb5Paa	well first check if their is still intrested n you and if  they are sexually likin you. if they ant hire a private investigater to follow them,and whatever you dont con front them
56ddddd857b32cf38a1c5e127931ab9daa	yes it is jealousy.a friend is meant to support and not to discourage ,who knows if u could make it from there,if u think she is making u<br>  uncomfortable or trying to  discourage u, just call off ur friendship.|`|394c3b26d9d39e932c4dcff1e9d85edeaa	kinda.....umMmM i go threw that cuz i have my bestest friend that i have known for my WHOLE LIFE!!

I know it is jelousy because...Me and my friends were on 3 way(on the phone) and the one friend said to me do you want to come over tomorrow and I said I can't because I am going over the other's friend's house and then she tried to put stuff in my head to make me go over her house tomorrow.But don't worry your friend will see that you need to hang out with someone different for a while. It had happened to me many of times!|`|u14mDTHGaa	I think she is so jealous. I think she should respect you and what you want to do. If she is acting that way then why is she being your friend anyway?|`|18b9d2996ca522b009053674a3e81901aa	Yes. Tell her how you feel.

If he brings up going out you need to tell him to stop asking you that because you had settled that with him already and you guys aren't going to be going out.  You are just friends.<br>  <br>  It would probably be better if you don't talk to him every single day---try to space it out and it might be easier for him to back off if you put a little space in there.|`|4a9d18b3f58496ce47c98ecb26e3b1e1aa	Find him a girlfriend

He is in crisis mode and that is why he is having the affair.  It is a way to go backwards?  He needs to talk to someone who is an intermediate a doctor or something. Then he needs to talk himself through his problems so he can solve them himself.   Slow down all is not lost not even close.|`|AA11796784	I suppose you shouldseek the minister. He is married after all. I think you should ask your son if he has any serious plans to bring his wife and child over. If he does you should ask him to stop the affair. (well he should anyway) The minister needs to talk to your son about his actions, and the other woman really needs to be talked to also. If you can't feel comfortable doing it ask if the minister will talk to her too!! Godd luck on everything. GOD bless you.|`|e967b85c02fe75d4b019a2a6bd1aa539aa	I'm not sure if I understand the question, did you say he or his wife had an affair? If so then it may be depressing him and depression can do numbers on us if we don't have the proper help and people around us, it would be best if you and your husband arranged for him to talk to a "good" minister who has some experience in that field he needs a mentor and a friend. God can be all of that and more if he'll accept Him into his life, that's what he really needs if he hasn't all ready if he has, then he should have a good minister to counsel him and teach him how to search the word of God and how to obtain an "intamate" relationship with God, good luck with your son and God Bless you|`|f12a2d4544203edf222669c3abfbc16aaa	i think you should make him get his own place as a first step.<br>  Then what he does in his life is his own problem, he's 42 and you're still watching his back, you've made him who he is now...let him fall on his face a couple of times, he'll learn the hard way but it will be better for him.

I'd be more worried if you found evidence of her actually cheating on you. This was just fun and games.

When I care about a girl, my interest in other girls drops way down.|`|AA12214515	4 or 5 months and no kiss...lol are u sure hes not gay.lol...oh i dont trust him!|`|AA11372613	i dont feel u should trust him cuz i feel wen im with my bf i dont wanna talk to or about another guy

4fbcf60c24dde6ceebe6529181de483daa	probably wants to get down your pants. he kissed you on your second date? you told him you had a boyfriend. you send a signal that you are down for getting down your and his pants by going out with him even if you had a bf. i say he has no real intentions and you are caught up in the infatuation of it all.|`|cLHdhPeTaa	You tell us !|`|fFnfFROQaa	if you know that he is a player that does the same routine to all of the females, then you need to realize the fact that you are not unique and he treats you the same as any female he sees.<br>  you are not singled out as special among the rest of them, you are only a convenience at that time.<br>  <br>  personally, i dont dip my pen in the company ink...so i dont go past the flirting part.|`|43beac8a342b8a3bc49f2f3239032148aa	Bad idea.|`|b5d8f268a6ec27c940e2aea6c3078399aa	You might be able to discreetly ask around or even ask him straight out.|`|e1bf7a8ffa4b2d1b7f73cfc9baeadf56aa	Probably just wants a piece...he is a player. If he was serious about you he would be a little more pursuitful (is that even a word???) in his "hunt". If YOU like him that much that it matters, then let him take you out and little by little you can "win" him over.|`|f8bd6e7a3ec47ee657b8b48dbaa14a35aa	I bet you are the only woman he ever came onto|`|4022bc51dfdf75119f689723a9684224aa	The only way to get that answer is to ask him out again yourself.  Put the control in your hands and let him know that you're interested.  If he wants to go out with you he will.  Ask him in person so you can see his reaction.  As for his real intentions and how serious he is - that's tricky.  It's really hard to know that. <br>  Date him - if it lasts, he's serious.  You can't be afraid to jump in there.  If you like him put it out there - if you wait until you know everything it may be too late.|`|46372a3f90ff71dca23071a4a88adba1aa	He wants to get in your pants.......duh. I love how girls know exactly what a guy's intentions are, but still don't acknowedge it.|`|bedQ2uiKaa	If he kissed you when he knew you had a boyfriend the stay clear...all he wants is a piece.  Unless that's what you're interested in too...then I'd say go for it.
f24ad8b6c9908f3c47d4b1c53bd16788aa	I don't know if having a child with him is "icing on the cake", I think you should give an ultimatum to leave his wife for you and yours (and his) child! As long as you are with him and don't put your foot on the ground, he is going to think that you condone his behavior and his infidelity even more- and he's going to think that it's alright to keep both his wife AND you. So tell him to make a decision!|`|AA11388175	he's a CHEATER, and its likely you aren the ONLY gal he has on the side... be careful not to catch diseases...<br>  oh, he wont leave his wife for you... why would you WANT him??|`|BoBMqRrPaa	ouch thats a tough one... your most likely always going to have some sort of feelings for him considering your having his child. but the best thing to do would be to move on and look for a guy who will respect you this guy cant be prince charming if he got you pregnant and now has a new girlfriend. its not right for him to cheat on his girlfriend with you if thats what you mean by he wont leave you alone so i would tell him to choose between you or her and if he doesnt choose you then you know what kind of a man or actually .. little boy he is and dont settle for that find a a real man! good luck|`|5d483546af6ac9e28a838dc9fee5be6caa	sounds like you have already been cheating with him. Obviously! Loving someone is not a feeling,or emotion, or how good the sex is. its about a decision. do you really want to be with someone that you constantly have to look over your shoulder to see if theres someone else. if he really loved whoever he belongs to he wouldnt have been looking for other weman. Is this man capable of a love bigger than lust and are you willing to chance it?

You go girl.|`|RMSv5AwJaa	He wants you to keep coming back for more.  He actually cares about you and its obvious.  You dont always have to please him because his satisfaction comes from making you happy.  Maybe you could switch it up on him and suprise him with something hot.  Im sure he would appreciate it.|`|fPkkcsQbaa	I wouldn't be complaining about this.  It sounds like you and your husband have a very good sex life, and he knows what gets you hot and bothered to the point where it makes for some really hot sex.  Lay back, and enjoy it.

If one or both died tomorrow, how would you feel? Are you doing things that you might regret if they suddenly died?<br>  <br>  Why are they now living with you? Have you any control over where they live? If not, why get upset about it? Seems to me you are getting depressed over things about which you can do nothing. That is a total waste of time and energy. Apparently you have never had a pet for a long time. The cat is obviously your grandparents' "baby". Perhaps a trip to the veterinarian might open your eyes to some facts about the animal. The cat may be terminally ill and not expected to live too much longer. Speaking from personal experience, losing a cat or dog that has been part of the family for ten years or more is a very traumatic experience.<br>  <br>  You're ranting about things which are unchangeable by you. Quit fighting it and see what you can do to help your grandparents.

Even if you don't feel it is right. I know, in experience, that you may be afraid of rejection. When I try to hint to a guy that I like him, I am afraid that he might not like me back, or that I might get rejected. Just think, <br>  "what you don't know can't hurt you".... OOPS, wrong saying. LOL. What I mean to say is... "you can only know if you try." That's a better saying. =]  I think that you should try again.<br>  <br>  Ask a girl, I feel that I am  Quick to change my might on who i'm interested in, and sometimes when you ask me something- I might want you to ask it again later if I change my mind.<br>  <br>  Okay, to sum it up, you can never know if she likes you if you won't ask her. lol. <br>  <br>  Good Luck & Get Your Girl! -Kay|`|AA10503621	Sure, why not?<br>             ~*Best of luck!*~|`|DUGY92vZaa	oh she definately likes you. start flirting with her,stir up the fire  and try again.<br>  good luck|`|cfd69405c2f6ab7c0cc51f45d3c7f8d6aa	well, sometimes girls start liking a guy after finding out that he likes her - because then she starts thinking about him & imagining how he'll be as a boyfriend<br>  <br>  it's possible she likes you but doesn't wanna get involved b/c she's moving<br>  <br>  i think you should talk to her more. then tell her that you like her, just wanted her to know that, and aren't expecting anything -  and ask her for at least one date. then on that date, show her how charming you are so that you convince her to go out with you. <br>  <br>  she'll be most flattered that you simply like her & aren't expecting anything & that will draw her towards you<br>  <br>  good luck with her =)

Je suis hypersensible de ne pas comprendre pourquoi on ne fait pas tout simplement les choses avec le coeur et l'amour et non avec les poings, la haine, la violence. Je suis hypersensible quand je regarde le clochard en bas de ma rue le soir de No?l tout seul sous ses cartons et qui saigne parceque des gens ne supportent pas qu'il sorten du lot. Je suis hypersensible quand je pense à l'avenir de mes enfants. Quand j'ai peur pour eux comme j'ai peur pour nous tous. Je suis hypersensible quand je me dit que les choses pourraient être toutes simple et que nous faisons tout pour les rendr si compliqués.

Sex is the activity done with same gender or other to acheive pleasure (sexually)<br>  <br>        then sex in general is male trying on female or vice versa wearing or not wearing clother inserting or not inserting touching or not touching genitals...|`|eceb19400893ec3d8e0da007d820dcc2aa	Sex refers to the male and female duality of biology and reproduction. Unlike organisms that only have the ability to reproduce asexually, sexed male and female pairs have the ability to produce offspring through meiosis and fertilization. The two sexes attract one another and communicate their readiness to procreate through differences in their biology.<br>  <br>  An organism's sex category reflects its biological reproductive function rather than its sexuality or other behavior. The female sex is defined as the one which produces the larger gamete and which typically bears the offspring. In contrast, the male sex has a smaller gamete and rarely bears offspring. In some animals, sex may be assigned to specific structures rather than the entire organism. Earthworms, for example, are normally hermaphrodites.<br>  <br>  In humans, "sex" is often perceived as a dichotomous state or identity for most biological and social purposes - such that a person can only be female or male. But many factors, including one's biology, environment, psychology and social context, have a role in determining how a particular person, and those around them, view their sex. Although the table below shows common differences between males and females, many people do not correspond to "male" or "female" with regard to every criteria.<br>  <br>  "Primary" sexual characteristics are typically present at birth and directly involved in reproduction. "Secondary" sexual characteristics typically develop later in life (usually during puberty) and are not directly involved in reproduction. Differences between the sexes are known as sexual dimorphism. At the biological level these differences are usually:<br>  Level  Characteristics  Female  Male<br>  Primary<br>  Sex chromosomes  XX  XY<br>  Gametes  Ova  Spermatozoon<br>  Sex organs  Ovaries  Testes<br>  Predominant Sex hormones  Estrogen and Progesterone  Testosterone<br>  Anatomy of internal genitalia  clitoral crura, vagina, uterus, fallopian tubes  corpora cavernosa, urethra, prostate, seminal vesicles<br>  Anatomy of external genitalia  glans clitoris, labia, vulva, clitoral hood, perineal urethra  penis, scrotum, foreskin fused perineum<br>  Secondary<br>  Height  Relatively shorter  Relatively taller<br>  Body fat  Relatively more<br>  in certain areas  Relatively less<br>  Body form development  "Hourglass" shape: 8  "Triangular" shape: ▼<br>  Other  Breasts and menstrual cycle  Adam's apple, beard and body hair<br>  <br>  The relationship between the various levels of biological sexual differentiation is fairly well understood. Many of the biological levels are said to cause, or at least shape, the next level. For example, in most people, the presence of a Y chromosome causes the gonads to become testes, which produce hormones that cause the internal and external genitalia to become male, which in turn lead parents to assign 'male' as the sex of their child (assigned sex), and raise the child as a boy (gender of rearing). However, the degree to which biological and environmental factors contribute to the psychosocial aspects of sexual differentiation, and even the interrelationships between the various psychosocial aspects of differentiation, is less well understood as illustrated by the ongoing nature versus nurture debate.|`|1NkxNYbVaa	send enter xotic sex is nothing else but penetration of a vagina by a penis the ultimate act holding hands is not sex as some feel we hold so many hands don't we?|`|Fm7nz4GCaa	sex is one of the an act / expression to show love....

My first love and I broke up five years ago. I don't think I "love" him anymore and I have no idea what is going on with his life, but I have never forgotten about him and I hope that he is doing well. My relationship occurred when I was in a teenager- now I am not a teenager anymore and am experiencing more mature love in my life and more to come!|`|A3k89OM8aa	when i was young, like teen agers i do believed with that saying, but as i become matured i don't believed already.

95c7561c329d3226611764fcedc7cd1aaa	You're afraid of this woman's influence over your ex.  Because he still sees her at work, you're worried about her stealing him away from you.  If you're going to be happy with this man, you'll have to get over your fear.  Trust him when he says he doesn't date her anymore.  Understand that he didn't have to tell you about this at all.  He did so to clear the air, so stop asking for her name.  It's irrelevant.  He has come back to you, which means it's you he loves.  If you love him as well, don't allow the past to destroy your future.  Be wise and let this issue go.|`|491dd01ba20cd4bb4db27f8cad59949caa	Well why is he an ex? I don't think its a big deal did you see other people?  I'm gonna go with no, since you didn't mention it in you question.  You thought because you didn't see other people he didn't and now that you know he has you are jealous.  But back to the ex thing, men are ex's for a reason.|`|AA11071281	no good will come of you knowing this other woman's name,the reason you probably want to know her name so badly is probably one of two things.<br>  #1-you have a hunch that you may know her,which would be devastating because you will feel doubly betrayed.<br>  #2-on a subconscious level you may want to know her name to be able to throw it in his face as often as you can.<br>  as someone who has been in this situation i can tell you it is a lose-lose situation,let me ask you this if you were able to take him back why are you stuck in the past,i can answer that myself you are most definitely not over it if you want to avoid divorce court might i suggest a good marital councillor might be you're best option to sift through your anger over the cheating|`|AA12035201	Your intuition was right the first time you divorced him...duh. Sorry about the duh, but comon...that's why you can't let it go.|`|AA12306645	You're insecure.   Let it go.

But keep your eyes open.|`|49d715a24c3dc9315a57c54b64487af2aa	You're insecure.  If he has never cheated, then you should fight these negative feelings.  Being a female, I understand totally.

After all your a couple again now.....why wont he tell you??  Perhaps you know her??<br>  Couples should not have secrets from eachother!!!|`|AA10515436	He probably doesnt want to tell you her name because it is irrelevent.  You were not married at the time.  Any additional information you get about her could cause you to have images in your head about him and her and if you found out who she is if you are jealous you could do something stupid like try to find out who she is and what she looks like, etc.  The truth is you were not married at the time.  If you love and trust him to be true to you then you need to let it go.  The more you let it eat at you the more YOU hurt your new start.<br>  <br>  Kathy|`|AA11479512	It sounds like an insecurity issue.  I have a lot of experience with this... I am very insecure when it comes to things like this.  Not knowing, or knowing what you "know" may be a lie you were told is a very uneasy feeling to live with.<br>  <br>  I wish I had a "quick fiz" for you but to be honest, you are the one who can fix this.  If you are the type to have acurate "gut feelings" you may not be letting go for a good reason.<br>  <br>  Do you trust him? Has he given you reason NOT to trust him.<br>  <br>  I sometimes have trouble trusting my boyfriend, but he never gave me a reason not to... like you, it's just something I am having trouble letting go of.<br>  <br>  Remember, although it may only be a feeling, if you don't have a "real" reason, do not let it hurt what you have with him.|`|cab287a9fae170442f6c01e4971bd180aa	BECAUSE YOU ARE CREATING AN ISSUE IN YOUR HEAD FOR WHATEVER REASON.

ea0a03add18be32cd72afa65c51b3710aa	yes its true, as long as you are not in dim light to start with because your pupils increase in size with dim light <br>  <br>   She gazes in your eyes with deep interest and her pupils are larger than normal. <br>  <br>  Studies at the University of Chicago have shown that when someone looks at something or someone they like or are intrigued by, the pupils of his or her eyes grow larger. If they find something or someone unpleasant, the pupils contract. U.C.’s Dr. Eckhard Hess says this strange phenomenon has nothing to do with the amount of light entering the eye, and that it can occur in either the best-lit or the darkest places; in fact this curious occurrence is not even controlled by the same part of the nervous system. <br>  <br>  If this is true, it means that when you walk into a room and someone glances at you, you are capable of telling if they are interested by the size of their pupils. If there is enough light to see those peepers, you can tell; the eyes become sort of flashy. If you are aware, you will soon catch on.|`|48d0e6a3a87ee17690c7c9b629793c7eaa	yes|`|AA10860297	NO!<br>  Your pupils change because the change in light! It has nothin to do with likein someone!<br>  Randi?|`|wOCTadLuaa	I don't know I have never heard of this but I do know that my boyfriend always says when he looks into my eyes that they dilate and I know that I like him.|`|3e6a7b1f3e03a56ef0cc271441e2531daa	No.  Your pupils appear to grow because you're blocking the light.|`|23ad50d0b3b4b9efe50f39c7dabefdddaa	yes it is<br>  <br>  Blinking. If someone likes what they see, their pupil size increases and so does their blink rate. If you want to up the odds in your favour, try increasing the blink rate of the person you're talking to, by blinking more yourself. If the person likes you, they'll unconsciously try to match your blink rate to keep in sync with you, which in turn, makes you both feel more attracted to each other!
1a004c8ea8d3078ebb7691e0e5206690aa	Grow up! He is a loser and it will always be like that.You were children when you startred going out and neither one of you knows what life is like.If you don't end it now and get in the real world ,you'll be married with 5 kids and coming on here acting all shocked that your husband is cheating and wondering what you should do. Give yourself a break and try to grow up a little.<br>  <br>  Are you kidding? Move on !

He can't sleep with a young girl, get her pregnant & still go after you. It is hard to trust him & he doesn't sound like the responsible type either. A paternity test should clear up whether he's the father or not. <br>  <br>  You did not say how you feel about him now. It sounds like you do want a clean break.|`|MNFpCPljaa	any chance you were on the Jerry Springer show recently?|`|Wc6ULS1vaa	at a certain point you have to draw the line. and thats your job, not his. dont let him pressure you to do what he wants bc YOU are living your life. not him. if YOU love him enough to overcome his cheating on you twice and getting another girl pregnant, i say keep him. if not, this other guy sounds really nice and i think you should give him a shot. go with your gut feeling.|`|iOqNJGFuaa	That's a mess I would wash my hands of. Just be blunt and tell him, "This is the path you chose. . . . . this is the path you'll have to follow." Especially since you said yourself you don't want to be with him. He is the one who screwed things up, not you. You don't owe him anything. He just wants to be with you because he screwed up and now things are getting a little too heavy for him. He probably feels like you'll clean up the mess for him. Stay grounded you deserve better.|`|2279eaa8937c58921a1b95d71e70232daa	whoa,,, i feel for you, if i waas in a situation like dis i would leave him alone especially b/c he messed  with her more than oncce and now shes pregnant so shes always gonna be in his life once your pregnant  from someone everythang changes,|`|2u3Ipg6Oaa	Firstly, you need to ditch the cheater because he  told you the first time that he didn't want her but yet he went and got her pregnant. He will cheat again.<br>  <br>  Secondly, does the new guy know that you are still with Mr Cheatz? Because, honestly, although you are trying to protect yourself from getting hurt, don't you think that you are hurting this sweet, honest new guy by not being faithful to him?<br>  <br>  Just dump your boyfriend. He'll get over it eventually.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|CJVHk54eaa	get outta there while you still can. before youre pregnant too.  he ditched you when you were going through a really tough time in your life.  he cheated on you, lied to you, and cheated on you again.  now hes the daddy of someone elses baby.  hes no good for you and you need to either find some one better or just hang out and be single for a while.  its pretty fun.|`|Wex7Saycaa	The funny thing is I have been in the same situation, but the pregnant girl was a little older. The only thing I can tell you is what I did and how that went...I chose to give him a second chance, people change I thought, and all the stuff he said was SO sweet. But I found out the hard way that it was all crap. He cheated on me AGAIN and we eventually had a HUGE break-up. I would never wish that upon anyone. And maybe your guy is different, but if I was you I would give him time to mature, then you'll find out if he's ready to be serious and only with you. Good Luck and hopefully it will work.|`|xfZCwipQaa	Follow your common sense, he wanted to be with this "child" until she got pregnant, don't you think it might happen again???  Don't set yourself up, once a cheater always a cheater.|`|WRdCITZCaa	Baby mama drama is no good

As long as you are custodian of these kids, even temporary, you have the legal power to say who they can and cant go with, including mom. There is a reason for you having custoy and not mom so she just cant do as se pleases with these kids. Also if she takes them and wont return them notify the police. as long as you have legal papers authorizing you as custodian, then thse kids are under your protection and use whatever authority you deem necessary to protect them including using the police and the courts|`|SK7MxFTnaa	a restraining order based on what?<br>  <br>  It also works the opposite direction.  You can't come into contact with her, but she cannot deliberately come in contact with you to create a violation of the order.<br>  <br>  If you have a temp order with custody and she doesn't return them...you take the order to the police and they'll get the children.<br>  <br>  THEN turn around and file a restraining order on her...|`|F0LgeWs5aa	If she files a restraining order, say 500 feet and then comes within 500 feet of you to pick up the kids she is in violation. I think. Custody temp or full is still custody, law is on your side and she can be charged if she does not comply.|`|AA10500537	get a lawyer and get full custody if the mom is unfit, <br>   where do the kids want to be ??<br>  you should go to coirt and get this all explained to you and her , soon|`|WaYC7W9Haa	You did say temporary custody right? That means a social worker is involved so I was talk with them about it and ask "What if?"  You should always try to make a peaceful relationship with the daughter even if you have to grit your teeth and be nice/nasty but it's all in good for the children.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!

jlUczlQZaa	It sounds as if your mother is very depressed or ill-equipped to be loving and supportive of you for some reason.   It's disappointing when the person who is supposed to build you up, listen to you, support you and always be there for you is letting you down.<br>  <br>  You feel neglected and you need to make her or another family member aware of this.   Can you arrange a quiet one on one excursion where you both can talk to each other about your feelings and what you need from her?  If not, consult a therapist to help you deal with what his happening and always turn to extended family and friends for help.  Even a teacher or someone at your church may be able to help you.<br>  <br>  Although it's very difficult, try not take her lack of support personally, it's not your fault.  She's emotionally shut down and there could be many reasons you are not aware of to why this is happening.  I am not condoning or excusing her behaviour, it's unacceptable for a mother to act this way, however, confronting why she is acting this way is the first step to finding a resolution (health reasons, mental health issues, personal issues, etc.)<br>  <br>  Continue your involvement in your interests (health, fitness), focus on your school, friends and always know that when people let you down you have to find the inner strength to soldier on and make life what you want it to be.   I hope for your sake she finds her way out this and she starts to be the mom you want and need her to be.<br>  <br>  I wish you the best of luck.|`|MtbaNz5Yaa	family counseling is probably the best choice.
6d0iJ4RQaa	That is the reason.  What you have to do to fix this situation is to look at yourself, and be proud of what you are, and what you are able to do.  Be confident with yourself, and be proud of who you are.  If you let people describe you, and you accept this description with no rebuttal, then you will stay single.  Stand up for yourself and be confident and proud of who you are, and what you do.|`|71JJ9GRVaa	I'm sorry about your illness.<br>  Hope to make u feel better, cause when I was younger, I'm 28 now, I was always very shy. Waited for people to come to me and talk to me. Then one day to the other I just changed, and now I will talk to anyone, anywhere. Confidence is a big issue, when it comes to making friends. Even if you are not that confident, just showing that u are makes a difference. People see you the way u carry yourself. Show that u confident in yourself, and that u don't care about what others think.<br>  I am very self conscious about myself, don't know why, my boyfriend tells me I shouldn't be, I just can't help it.<br>  But when I am in public, I show people what I want to be:) Be positive, and want to show people what they would be missing out on if they didn't want to get to know you. Best place to make easy friends is at school, if you're still in school. Don't be afraid to smile at people in the hallway, make a small conversation when you are waiting for the bus. <br>  I always say to everyone, if u don't take care of yourself, no one else will. You have to stand up for yourself and enjoy your life while you can. You're still young, that should definitely help. <br>  I hope this helped a little bit. And you know what, you already made the first move, by asking for help here;) Just continue this, and don't be scared to approach people face to face.|`|MXih8N3Xaa	Okay you need to improve your confidence.<br>  And if you think there are things in your life you need to fix or do for you to have a well balanced life, you should aim and try to fulfill those first. <br>  It seems that you are not completely happy with yourself, so you can't expect to make someone else happy if you aren't yourself.|`|Nsm8zGfsaa	AWWW:( ill date u|`|f7GPOxooaa	confidence is key|`|fsHgUrcAaa	Yes.

6d0iJ4RQaa	The building management is responsible if any damage is done to your car, unless the contract you had signed for the lease indicated otherwise.  What you have to do if you want to escalate the situation is to read over your contract that you had signed for your lease, to make sure there is nothing there that indicates that they're not responsible, you have to get copies of the letters you had written with the dates for your personal records, and move on from there.  Regardless if you gave a 60 day notice you still are a tenant till the last day.  If you do escalate, they will try and fight it, so keep your information handy and don't back down.

In my opinion, you should talk to your boyfriend and tell him how you feel and if you can't work it out, then you should agree to see other people.<br>  But I have a question for you too. Why do men cheat on their girlfriend?.....be her good or bad?<br>  It's something that happens and it's something that both genders do and they do it because they don't want to be with the other person, but they are too scared to break up with them. Or they get in a fight and they go off and cheat out of anger and then beg for forgiveness later on. Whatever the case is though, I don't think that it is EVER right to do, no matter what the cause.|`|bMLdEkncaa	Well people may cheat on a guy for many reasons: <br>  1) doesnt like him anymore and cant get the nerve to dump him<br>  2) he's an *** and he did it first<br>  3) u were really drunk<br>  4) U like attention from other guys an dcouldnt resist a hot guy <br>  5) doesnt want commitment<br>  6) u rely on him for financial support but u dont want to be with him<br>  7) u didnt take the relationship serious<br>  8) u like dating more than one person at a time but the other doesnt <br>  10) u have an open relationship<br>  11) he lived out of town and dont think he'll ever find out<br>  12) he's too possessive <br>  13) u want to make him jealous or realize what a good think he has bc he never appreciated u<br>  14) bored<br>  15) liked someone else b4 and got into a relationship with u just to make the other one jealous<br>  ...................<br>  Many reasons but personally i never had.

If you can<br>  keep her laughing, you will go far.<br>  · Intelligent and Creative. Intelligence is sexy IF it's used in a<br>  way that's interesting to her. Use your creativity and intelligence<br>  to surprise her with ideas, fantasies and unexpected things that<br>  charm her.<br>  · Educated. Education is attractive to women as long as it's used<br>  in an interesting way. Some women are actually intimidated by<br>  education, as they're not educated (This usually works in your<br>  favor).<br>  · Classy and Cultured. If you have class, women pick up on this.<br>  Do your shoes and belt match? Do you understand interior<br>  design and color contrast? Do you know about different types of<br>  wine? Do you like foreign movies? Do you understand fashion?<br>  Do you like Frank Sinatra? Do you enjoy exotic foods? Do you<br>  serve her Hors d'oeuvres and a glass of wine when she visits? Do<br>  you open all doors for her? Women notice this stuff BIG TIME.<br>  · Dominant. Women have an unconscious attraction to dominant<br>  men. The dominant males in some primate groups account for<br>  up to 75% of all the matings, while the less dominant males go<br>  without. Same goes for humans.<br>  · Thoughtful. Women don't just like gifts, they like knowing that<br>  you were THINKING of them. The gift is a SYMBOL. Women feel<br>  the same amount of good inside whether it's a card or a<br>  diamond (of course the diamond lasts longer, so there are more<br>  'times of feeling good!'). But the fact is that women like to know<br>  that you're thinking about them. Even if you're telling a woman<br>  that you don't like it that she was out with another guy, she'll<br>  like it, because it means you were thinking about her!<br>  · Notices Significant Details. Women don't just notice details,<br>  they USE them to try to be attractive and attentive. If she is<br>  wearing a sexy outfit, she didn't put it on by accident. If her hair<br>  is done nicely, it wasn't a fluke. Women are very impressed and<br>  attracted to men that notice these details.<br>  · Unpredictable/Predictable. Here's a paradox. Women are<br>  drawn to men that they can't control or predict. They obsess<br>  over guys who flirt and give them attention, then don't call the<br>  next day. Predictability is only attractive when it comes to<br>  choosing a HUSBAND. Then a woman usually wants a man who's<br>  VERY predictable.<br>  · Enthusiastic, Fun, Happy. Nothing is a bigger turn off than a<br>  killjoy. Some men get upset and pout when a woman is happy,<br>  and try to put down the things that she enjoys to sound<br>  superior. This is usually a HUGE mistake. Enthusiasm is<br>  infectious and attractive.<br>  · Adventurous. Women are instantly attracted to men who like to<br>  do extreme, adventurous, unusual, even dangerous things. It's<br>  exciting. Adventurism is sexy.<br>  · Aggressive. Women love men that know what they want and go<br>  after it. Passion is a sign of life. I'm not talking about the kind of<br>  aggressive that turns into date rape. I'm talking about the kind<br>  of aggressive that turns into setting a goal and then going after<br>  it with passion and getting it no matter what.<br>  · Confident/Cocky. Women are magnetically attracted to men<br>  who are just a little bit too cocky. Just a little bit. This is a tough<br>  one to explain. Many men take this to mean 'overly arrogant'<br>  which is not what I mean. If you watch Pierce Brosnan in 'The<br>  Thomas Crown Affair' or Clarke Gable in 'Gone With The Wind' or<br>  Tom Cruise in 'Top Gun' you'll get an idea of what I'm talking<br>  about. The confident/cocky trait is mild overconfidence combined<br>  with humor. Drives women wild.<br>  · Expertise. If you're an expert in an area that is interesting to<br>  your kind of woman, this can be attractive. It needs to be<br>  presented from a "I know a lot about this, let me show you"<br>  perspective, not a "I'm cool and you're not" angle.<br>  · Attention. Women like attention. And interestingly enough, it's<br>  better to hint at the attention that you're giving them than to be<br>  too overt about it. If you say "I was thinking about you earlier<br>  today. And I just wanted to mention that I really like the sound<br>  of your voice..." it's much more powerful than listening to them<br>  complain about something so they think you're paying attention.<br>  Get it?<br>  · Disinterest, Indifference, a Challenge. Most women are used<br>  to being pursued by men in one way or another. If you are<br>  indifferent to a woman, make her think that you're only calling<br>  because you're bored, and act almost disinterested sexually,<br>  they'll often do their very best to get your attention. Different is<br>  good in this case. Again, this drives most women crazy, and<br>  even though they'd hate to admit it, it's ultra interesting to<br>  them.<br>  · Charm (attention with a polished, smooth approach). This is<br>  hard to describe. Watch a James Bond movie to get an idea. And<br>  watch 'Dirty Rotten Scoundrels.' Pay attention to Michael Cain's<br>  character. Charm is powerful because it has a certain 'prince on<br>  a white horse' aspect to it.<br>  · Romantic Imagination and Perspecti|`|WaYC7W9Haa	All women desire a certain something in a man but when we connect with the ONE our desire takes over and it's hard to fight the urge!

vFLnPasAaa	Hi there, i am in the exact same boat as you. myself and my x split up 5 weeks ago. i didnt want to us to split up as i love him dearly. but what i am doing is giving him some space to see if that helps by not calling him or texting. we have went out on a date, and we will gradually over time have more but not right now. my advice to you is take it very very slowly, like dont call all the time or text and when you do go out dont discuss what happened just try and let it be like the 1st time you guys met. my x even said to me that the space was helping and he even said he had been looking forward to seeing me when we went on our date. i hope it all works out, if you need any help you can mail me xx|`|4W7WeXNSaa	Don't try to get back in her life again it will spook her.

piLvjALSaa	You need to keep your life, there is one thing guys can't stand is a chick that waits around.  Make sure you keep your life!! Do what you normally do, don't waste so much time sitting in front of the computer waiting for him.  He'll think you don't have a life and that is not an attractive quality.  Good Luck|`|8oDGnVhcaa	Ok 1st thing do the things that you supposed to do instead sitting in the computer. You should say hello to him & chat with him. It sound that you do like him. Next time, when you see him I think you should tell him how do you feel about him. If you don't tell him, you will never get over of yourself & it is going to affect you. Don't be afraid being rejected buy him. If you do get reject, then he is not the one for you. It is not the end of the world. There are a lots of guys around & the only thing that you have to do is,talk to them. :)|`|0cd14558b59bca02f88377d3fee26645aa	Jam out. Music can take some of the pain away.

What you need to do if you really like him and think that you might have more than a friendship with him? You need to tell him how you feel, straight up. Women dont want a guy that wont tell you how he feels and vice versa. It's not bad that you tell him how you feel before he does. A lot of the times he feels the same way. Be careful later on. If you really like someone, make sure that that person feels the same way about you, Dont do things for that person if that person isnt willing to sacrifice the same for you.

tfDYRlY3aa	Keep in mind that the wedding gift isn't just about YOU, it's also about the gift GIVER.  Your registries should give them options that will make them feel great, connected to you, and that what they give you will be MEMORABLE.<br>  <br>  The problem with a $50 gift card is, it's all about how much you gave.  Ew.  Very cold and impersonal.<br>  <br>  Whether you're registering for "stuff" or part of your honeymoon (I'll admit to a lot of bias here, I founded TheBigDay, a honeymoon registry :-), what's listed on your registry should be things that you'd be excited and proud to give someone else....NOT just practical.<br>  <br>  I wrote an advice article on our site with lots more details and examples...see the source below.<br>  <br>  Michael.|`|LZfjxIrxaa	Start your life together in an environmentally friendly way.|`|v03OHqtqaa	Bed Bath & Beyond will give you cash for your gifts that you return that are on your registry.  And they will give you cash for your gift certificates!|`|yjB1dfn0aa	I talked my wife into registering at Sears so I could get tools. We lived together for a year and a half before we got married and we had all of the household things like towels, plates, etc. But I didn't really have any tools. We moved into our house from our apartment about 2 months before we got married. I never really needed to many tools while we lived at the apartment but now that we own a house I needed tools to fix things around the house. Also I needed a lawnmower to cut the grass. Honeymoon registries are also great... you can find great registry ideas at www.theknot.com or www.weddingchannel.com I hope this helps you out. Good Luck!!!|`|Sby9iGKKaa	It's really not OK to ask for cash.  Although I've seen it, it's just a bit tacky.  You may want to consider a "general" place for at least one registry.  A lot of the older guest expect this and consider it an inconvenience if they cant' go to the usual Target or JCPenney.   Some people just don't like to give cash and not know where it was spent.  All registries have the option for gift cards, and when would a $50 gift card to Target not come in handy?  I've heard of people asking for restaurant gift cards, "send us a gift card to your favorite restaurant".   The couple gets to go on dates and not be strapped for cash their first year of marriage.   The honeymoon registry is a great place for people to give and it keeps your money in your bank account and still allows for people to give something other than cash.

La vida vista de esta manera no termina nunca. Esta sería una concepción individual. Si en cambio lo ves como la vida "global", como que todos formamos parte de una "masa de vida", como las hojas forman parte de un árbol llegarías a la conclusión que la vida tampoco termina, a menos que el mundo se destruya, y es por eso que debemos adoptar un criterio ecologista.|`|47ede859cfd688c61d8d3fbcfc1e06f5aa	SI, creo k la vida es coclica...tal vez por eso siento k tengo un alma vieja...k ha penado por aki ya tiempo|`|Mqd1u3Q4aa	la biblia dice que después de la muerte vendrá el juicio final y después de ser jusgados según sus obras vendrá la muerte segunda ( que es condenarte en el infierno por la eternidad) o la vida eterna al lado de nuestro Se?or Jesucristo|`|c3fc6bd2bf2523806cba968bc768e2a3aa	Si si creo y eso me da miedo por que no se a donde voy a hir.ni que me va a pasar uyy que miedo|`|laTpQqEIaa	pos yo creo que esto todavia no es vida si no una prueba y la vida biene cuando segun morimos para los que tenemos feen dios|`|xuw34X2Eaa	claro que si la verdadera vida empieza despues de esta que tenemos por eso no importa lo material, solo lo espiritual es lo que queda en el alma y es lo que se va con nosotros a la otra vida|`|zlDonD7zaa	pienso que despues de la muerte hay otra forma de vida diferente a la de aqui con los vivientes!!!|`|6413cb18183c46bcbd9d5ed4b51e969faa	hola <br>  pues ... bueno <br>  eso solo seria tener fe <br>  ya que yo no estoy muerta y no se que me pase luego de morirme <br>  ( sin nombrar que cuando me muera no voy a poder regresar para contar lo que me pase....) <br>  bueno espero que mi opinion sea de tu agrado besos|`|CLyV5qemaa	SI CREO ,PERO ME DA UN POCO DE MIEDO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|KXg8atMpaa	yo creo en la   vida  y   en  la   muerte    es  verdad   cuando  uno esta    viejito  le  pasa    eso|`|QsWR5Nwpaa	Creo que la muerte puede implicar un nuevo nacimiento.

a7d7d1bf9a9f6f521d3f7286e738f8bbaa	OK, your situation sounds difficult. Here's what I would do. Ask some co-workers what they think about your boss liking you. If they agree, then just go talk to him about it. Their human resource regulations forbidding that kind of stuff, but you only live once. The only thing I'm concerned with is if it works out to be awkward being with him at work. Good Luck!

Suerte|`|082d750cec162e549eeb1b6a79755af1aa	estaba jugando con un clavo de oyo y no me di cuenta y atraveso mi corazon pero no dolio <br>  nota : el corazon era mi almuada|`|c18d2f848cc56e0aedd5cb76e1d543faaa	claro que si!!!! algunas veces, pero pues he salido adelante. he sufrido enga?os y desiluciones pero la mas grande e?ha sido el abandono y desentendimiento total del padre de mi hijo al cual le entregue todo lo mejor de mi y obvio para el no fue suficiente, en el embarazo se desentendio por completo, cuandoncio el ni?o nisiquiera fue al hospital, no me ha brindado ningun tipo de ayuda nisiquiera moral, no va a reconocer al ni?o, ya anda con alguien mas de hecho desde que estaba embarazada y pues lo ultimo es que ya lleva 4 meses de desaparecido y nada de nada ni una llamada para saber si el ni?o esta bien o necesita algo. Lo que mas me duele es que no tenga consideracion de un ni?o que no merece ese trato. Pero pues aveces las cosas no son como queremos y hay que aceptarlas como vienen sin lamentarnos porque si lo hacemos muchas veces no logramos salir del hoyo en el que se siente caer. Creo que todos hemos sufrido y como dicen el amor siempre duele. Saludos.|`|f1d0beb84c279902f4eb7751d6f1dbd6aa	que me hicieron?

uGMcjf87aa	You need to gain her trust. Tell her to tell you everything simply everything at first she wont tell you, but when she starts opening up she will trust you also her nervousness will fade away and she will actually stop being so nervous around you.

6b7afd2bf548cbd4656c0680b7586641aa	Depends on who he is consulting around him about what to do.  Many guys do wait the industry standard 3-days, although I think that is a little overrated.  In your case, I think at least two days was good because you just met him for the first time.<br>  <br>  Let's say you guys had known each other for a little while, but never really talked before, then it would be fine to call even the next day.<br>  <br>  I think if it has been three days since the text, I would call him.  He really might be shy, and maybe he has some idiot dude friends telling him to wait X-amount of days.  Most of the time when guys wait too long to call, it's because they have friends giving them bad advice so they get phsyched out and wait for one too many days.<br>  <br>  It would be best if he manned up and called you, but hey, it's 2007 and a day when girls can actually make the first move, so don't fear it and give him a call.  If he is pretty non-receptive over the phone and the conversation doesn't flow very well, then I would say forget it and move on.<br>  <br>  What you can do is just call him, see what's been going on, talk for 5-10 minutes and ask him to call you sometime over the next couple of days.  Hopefully that will give him the confidence to mill it over, call you in a day or two and ask you out.<br>  <br>  He probably just needs a little reassurance from you and a call would likely do that.|`|5Un9BQMgaa	Call him. Very good chance that he doesnt even have text on his phone. If he doesnt have the feature or if he has an old phone then he never got the message.|`|lckv4hs3aa	Depends, all guys are different. My boyfriend is really shy and he text me the first time the same night i gave my number to him. BUT i gave my number to an ex and it took him 8 days to text me back. geez guys eh! I would give him a week though before moving on.

Kids and parents get into fights, sometimes big ones.  However, it is the parents responsibility to keep things straight.  For a parent to tell a child they hate them, needs to re-evaluate their position on parenting and possibly consider someone else to assume their role as a guardian.|`|8e22a11a13ad8c1aa6fbe2fdec773bcaaa	Sounds like you have some issues to deal with.  Being a parent is a tuff job and trying to guide your children in the right direction when they are doing everything in there power to do the opposite is very frustrating.  You should respect your parents, don't yell, don't talk back, and NEVER try to bring a weapon in the mix.  Are you crazy?  If your dad is abusive then you need to talk to someone like a school counselor.|`|bKwQyCEHaa	you really should call 911 your dad should not be threatening and hitting you|`|XJlD2kPsaa	well, i doubt he hates you, its probably just temporary, but since he didn't get to do what he wanted having higher authority than you he probably got really sad, he's probably hurtin on the inside as well. He probably loves you as much as you love him. Unless you really hate him and swear at him and run away from home and everything are a druggie and such im sure he loves you and would never give up on you. It's probably just a short phase and you should make-up soon and it was right for you to defend yourself. But usually when my parents yell at me i don't defend myself with words and they don't try to well hit me. But if this happens frequently i suggest that you call the authorities, if it really does get to that point. But remember that he loves you and you love him|`|x1VLBHOJaa	Sounds like you have way too much drama in your family, and I KNOW what drama is like. Try to make some peace, be patient and calm, don't start shouting and arguing. When you get mad count to ten and picture a deserted beach with palm trees and a setting sun. You should never turn a knife on anyone, especially not a member of your family, nor should your father be raising his hand to you. Have you ever tried talking to your dad and seeing how he feels? I bet you told him you hated him plenty of times. What I have learnt in my life is that life is too short to be hating and argung with your family because they won't be around forever. You should be nice to your parents while you still have them.|`|Qd8aqvVuaa	no, theres no point calling the cops, he didnt hit you, and he wasnt the one that put a knife to you.<br>  <br>  I think both fo you need some help rebuilding your relationship.<br>  <br>  You both need to see a family counsellor to work through this, otherwise you will drift apart and never have a decent relationship. This is easier than putting effort in and healing the relationship, but will not be as fulfilling in the long run.<br>  <br>  where is your mother while all of this is happening> How does she feel about it all?<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|ABMvstsaaa	I no exactly what your feeling, this situation sounds all to familiar. When he said it was definatly out of anger, chances are though he probably doesnt feel that way deep down so even though its hard try forgetting about it and moving on and i gave mine the silent treatment for a long time just to teach him and i think you were totally right for defending yourself, if you didnt it might have ended with you being hurt. Good luck and i hope things get better for you=)|`|7tNv9T3oaa	I know you don't want to hear it, but you seem to need to talk to someone. It sounds alot like child abuse.

There are ways to resolve differences without having a shouting match. I've learned this from years of going thru similar experiences with my dad. Sometimes we say things we don't mean but we don't see the person in front of us as who they really are because at that moment we're not seeing much of anything at all but the hurt inside of us and its easy to paint them on someone else. Do a little searching within yourself and maybe your dad won't follow along but it's important that you both not have something like this go down again. Tell your dad what you don't like and why and it'd be good if you could try and look beyond his words and focus moreso on where it might be coming from in his life. Not to say either one of you should be mindreaders because you can't but the only way you will get to some sort of balance in your relationship with each other will be to find a way to express your needs in words instead of acting them out in anger for a lack of not having them met in which case, like I said, no one sees anything in anger. And to look for some commonalities. Pick your battles wisely. Take a moment next time he does something or says something that doesn't sit so well with you and ask yourself is it really worth a fight? Peace.|`|CONpX6rhaa	My Dad has said that many times to me. I think for your Dad, it might just be out of anger. It makes him feel like he's trying to over power you with words. And don't think he really does hate you, because I bet if you died tomorrow, he would see how much he hurt you(and i'm almost 100% sure he feels horrible anyway).|`|Uagg9UsFaa	1) well if he hits you, then you can turn him in for abuse.<br>  2) do you have another parent around to help?<br>  3) you shouldn't have raised the knife<br>  4) he was probably really mad and it just got our of hand<br>  5) maybe you should both get some counseling classes?|`|xMo6uTtiaa	It would be good for you two to get some family therapy.

Your dad is calling you names and saying mean stuff to you b/c that's how he feels about himself.  Misery loves company.|`|TmG11cB7aa	i have the same problem but i hate my family so much if i were you i would apologize t my dad and ask him to forgive me for what i did. and then i would ask my mother if we could have a family game night and hang out try to see if you ca get closer to your dad. i do not have a father practically because my dad keeps getting sent to war but he hates me so much. well used to this really worked for me. y the way if that does not work i would just quit bothering to try to get closer to my father and just wait to see what he does. if it does work i would try again with different ideas to get family(father son)time.

fkW67kzdaa	Yo pienso que para el amor no hay tiempo, si esa atracción fue tan real y tú y él lo sintieron debe ser que sí, no creo que la naturaleza se equivoque y nunca te arrepientas de dejar una relación si lasí lo hiciste fue por tu bien, no? Como puedes dudar de hacerte un bien? Es como decir ay....me estoy quemando con este cerillo, quitaré la mano o no? pues claro que la quitas, nunca te arrepientas de hacerte un bien y suerte con el nuevo chavo, conozcanse, entre más diferentes sean mejor se llevarán, te lo aseguro. eso de que "Somos iguales en todo, es padrísimo!" no es verdad a la larga eso afecta mucho en su forma de llevar la realción. Suerte. Ciao.|`|0d6c5a7879fce619326cdc0b26785b82aa	Amor no lo sé, pero enamoramiento sí. Y hay un mundo de distancia entre una cosa y otra... el enamoramiento es esa fascinación inicial que la gente suele confundir co el amor, pero el amor es algo muy distinto. El amor es un movimiento de la voluntad que te lleva a algo que la gente no está acostumbrada a hacer, y es el sacrificio. El amor se mide por el sacrificio que se está dispuesto a hacer por el bien de la otra persona, y eso incluye aprender a amar los defectos del otro. Eso es lo más importante, amar a esa persona tal cual es, y no por un mero deslumbramiento. Cuando ese deslumbramiento se acaba y afloran los naturales defectos que todos tenemos, y se aprende a mirar al otro como es, sin idealizarlo, se está comenzando a amar.<br>  Suerte!<br>  Besitos,<br>  Syl.|`|76fDVUiFaa	No lo creo, mas bien debe de ser algo asi lo que algunos llaman "QUIMICA", pero en fin, se feliz! disfruta lo que estas empezando a vivir... y quien quita y sea tu "verdadero amor"|`|8d01ffa5f0eb6cba8c7cde29cf4c27adaa	Tené en cuenta que estás intentando un gran cambio en tu vida...<br>  Lo que siempre sucede primero entre dos personas con los primeros cruces es una especie de "encantamiento", com si se te moviera la estantería.<br>  Viví el día a día y solo el tiempo te dirá si es tu nuevo amor!!!!<br>  Disfrutá el momento y adelante.<br>  Besos y cuidate.<br>  :::|`|HPfTsg61aa	Creo que por el momento debes disfrutar esta relacion, que parece muy bonita.

Date tiempo, piensas las cosas y sigue conociendo al chico pero sin compromisos solo hasta que sientas que estas realmente preparada y segura de lo que vas a hacer.|`|OUJG1ZZoaa	Mirar a los ojos y sentir que le conoces de toda la vida no es algo que ocurra todos los dias, es algo que creo muy especial, por supuesto que quiza con una mirada no es amor, pero creo que es algo tan bonito ese sentimiento...No tienes que pensar si valio la pena dejar la otra relación, es algo que solo te va a hacer no disfrutar de ciertos momentos, vive hoy que ma?ana dios dira. Disfruta de esas miradas y de el, es algo que la gente que no lo ha pasado no se puede imaginar como puedes tener tanta complicidad con alguien en tan poco tiempo, pero yo creo que merece la pena aprovecharlo.|`|nGiV2BmZaa	Si.

XVVKoMgcaa	Forse 40 sono un po' troppi per te! Credo che dovresti semplicemente cercare una ragazza giovane ma molto matura. Perché è difficile che duri un rapporto con una donna più grande.

aHAakeuUaa	Hi hon,<br>  <br>  Yes, you will have to drop it, and try and be happy for her.<br>  <br>  Don't know how happy her parents were about this, but even they consented, and surely they have more of a 'say' in her life.<br>  <br>  As her friend just be there for her.  This marriage may last 50 years just because she is young doesn't mean it will fail.  <br>  <br>  If it all does go wrong for her, just be there and listen and offer support and don't judge her.  You might find yourself in a situation one day and you will want support too.|`|db3d79a48f9a4df140f82783d25309ecaa	yes.  support her and be there for her.  SHe has her heart set on marrying, and no one will change her mind.  what you CAN do, though, is smile, and support her decision, and if/when things get rough, dont say I told you so. Just be there for her.|`|tBkOAqNdaa	Since you have already talked to her...the only advice to give is to be happy for her, and wish her only the best.  And if things don't work out just be there for her.  Just remember that everything happens for a reason, and if its not meant to be then it won't happen.
ADP9swbMaa	Call the restaurant and tell them you were offered another job, but ask them if they are willing to hold on to your resume in case things don't work out. <br>  They might go for it or they might not, but they'll probably appreciate your honesty.

0j6dO8FEaa	I have been with my husband for almost three years and he love his video games. Its a guy thing, just like girls love there shopping and make up.  At first it would bug me but now while hes playing i lay beside and watch him play, it may not be totally quality time but hey at least hes at home with me playing video games then out with his boys checking out girls know what i mean.  Get interested in his games watch him play and maybe even pick out a game that both of you will enjoy.  If you really love him you will stick it through it just a video game.  And when you think about the little things that made u break up with him also think about all the little things he does to make you smile or the big things he does to make you smile think about all the good times and you will soon forget the bad ones.. Trust me in the end its all worth it.|`|TanepNjdaa	If you love him then maybe you should give it another try, but honestly do you think that things are really going to change? See what he say's about what he can do different, and talk about the changes you both can make. I broke up with my boyfriend a year ago and knew that I still loved him. My friends hate him but no matter what anyone said I still did what I wanted to do. So after a year we just got back together and honestly things were great in the beginning but now they are just back to normal which sucks. But at least maybe give the opportunity to do it again. You never know what could happen. Best of luck to you.|`|0XnUgyiraa	know it????????<br>  i mean to say that know your bf feeling and your feeling. if your bf is just hooking up then what it means to be with him and also important part is that what you feel about him. in relationships one way traffic is not really good it must need the two way.<br>  ""keep feeling in top priority""|`|0N0Zmo0taa	ask yourself, is he the love of my life? my true love? if he's not, move on. you'll get over it. he sounds like a kid to me.|`|716a8aa7512b2c7a9c6c48484ce56701aa	Think of all the little reazons why  you broke up with him on the first place, and move on <br>  ~^_^|`|EFMvJIJ7aa	tell him how you feel if he says he will change get back together if he doesnt change dump him again|`|LLeQyWGcaa	think about what you really want in a relationship and what is really important. think about some things that you truly need and things that you truly can't live with. If you want more attention from a man and you are not getting it from your ex move on. there are plenty of fish in the sea. you are young and the fishing season is about to open. go get your license and cast out that bobber.|`|otZA4H78aa	aww, maybe you should give him one more chance, ur truely in love with him.. :) everyone isn't you... you are yourselft, if you really like him then be with him... and try playing some video games with him.. and if you beat him then you can do what you wnat :)|`|ezzSeBnLaa	Give it time. Every time a relationship ends, it feels like they're "the one" because you miss the routine that you had with em. Once you move on and start doing other stuff, you'll see it was probably better off not being with him. After a couple of months, if you still feel the same way when you first broke up, try things out again.|`|JUYTrzHyaa	Move on.  The guy is a loser.  And you, obviously, are a winner.  And I know that just based on your deep and heartfelt question.|`|871511324833ee801090472686782f12aa	Accept suggestions but listen to your heart.|`|3Ks21ASDaa	Don't listen to other people. Follow your heart.|`|VG4r3miJaa	The Grass is always going to be greener on the other side.  If you love him, then you should talk to him about your concerns,  if he's a jerk about it then maybe you should break up, but make sure when you confront him about it you are nice and complete.  In a nice way let him know the seriousness of the situation.  He doesn't have to be all over you all of the time, but if he is ignoring you all the time, that's a problem.|`|Uagg9UsFaa	In the end it's both of your decisions (if he wants to get back with you too), but it's might just be shock. you said that you have been with him for over 2 years, so are used to having him around so it just feels like something is missing, but it's something you will get used to over time and you will find many more people out there.<br>  <br>  Also: if he was too busy playing games to spend time with you, then he isn't worth it.|`|kEcFWz6Xaa	Listen to your heart, things could be a lot worse with him lol. No offense but this is why most marriages don't last now and days.You have to work,work,work to make things good. Make him get off his butt to spend a romantic day with you by planning something you both like. Talk to him about how you feel and that you would like to have some more attention from him.|`|771a46b3a001f059eb7ca678c7061fbdaa	Listen to your gut.  If you think you can do better then you probably can.  You can't stick around with someone and hope they will change.  You need to find someone that you are happy with now otherwise in 10 years you will be miserable and still trying to change your dude into somehting he isn't.|`|hV4RrPtoaa	Why dont you try to sit down and talk to him about what he wants, and about what you want? that way you can clear the air and if your supposed to still be together, you can be.|`|pRxzPiSbaa	WoW ruins another relationship!! man, those games are addictive. of course you can do better!!|`|0iI8lIv6aa	First avail SHUT UP u r a grown women and u it is ur fault 4 breaking up with him sooooooooooo what ever DONT TALK TO HIM UGLY|`|OhYE3GhKaa	According to your comment you rushed into something...breaking up...without thinking it through. So you regret it now, miss him, love him. " I just felt like at times I didn't get all of his attention" Guess what?<br>  <br>  If you reunite, you still won't get all his attention. I mean, would you want to? Do you want to sit in a room and have him look into your eyes day and night? Do you want him to demand all your attention constantly? I think World of War craft is bad. My boys play for days and nights. <br>  <br>  But I think if I were young, having my guy at least sitting in front of the screen in my home is better than being in a bar with another woman<br>  <br>  anyway, you need to negotiate. talk together about what you each want, what you need, what you have to offer. Ignore others advice. Except mine!

AA11229410	Most of the time when a couple with this much age difference gets together there is one of the two that is less immature.  The younger of the two needing a parent figure or the older one not able to find anyone their age.  As long as you know of this going into the relationship you will know what you have to look forward to.  There will be problems but what relationship doesn't have them.  I would not get too into deep to start off with.  Take your time with this guy.  It may be you that is not seeing the big picture or he may grow old of taking care of someone too young.  If the two of you are not into talking about things like this it will be the first sign that the age difference is too far apart.|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	7 years is not such a big difference. My dad is 9 years older than my mom - big whoop. If your parents have a problem, they will most likely have a problem with you "marrying too young" (if you do decide to get married). But simply dating a guy who's only 7 years older? It's hardly a big deal. Guys mature a little later in life anyway.|`|AA10743159	It will be more about who and what your boyfriend is, rather than the age difference. The average age difference between married couples is five years, so you aren't too far away from that average.<br>  If your parents like your choice of a husband, the age difference, will matter little.<br>  So you can rest easy on that being a big factor. In fact, it could be a big plus, especially if he is well settled, with a good job and the ability to take good care of you.|`|SHARt1k3aa	Now, that isn't a bad difference at all.  I mean it all depends how mature you are.  I would be okay with my daughter dating a guy that old at 21, if the guy was a really good guy.  At 27 he should have a great job, out of college and supporting himself.  If that's all in line... your parents probably will approve.|`|PY160XO7aa	Who cares as long as he is not a dead beat, and can PROVIDE emotional, and financially for you (or my daughter). AGE doesn't matter as long as there not under age.|`|tbJraueLaa	my husband is 12 years older than me.  who cares..|`|875b9562d8defd3804154e34c3bf5ea4aa	If your parents respect you, they will also respect the choices you make. It's hard for parents to sit back and not say anything sometimes. They love you, they want to protect you from getting hurt, they don't want you to make the same mistakes they did. So if they do give you a little crap, just sit them down and talk to them about why you feel the way you feel. Maybe it'll help them understand better.<br>  If it was my daughter, I'd let her make her own choices as long as I knew she wasn't in danger. Everyone needs to experience life for them self.|`|kYU0LAZTaa	well im 24. <br>  an older brother of mine dated a younger girl then him. which was a 8 year difference. Our parents didnt really care but her parents did. <br>  <br>  It all depends on how your parents would think about it. If you were curious ask them if they ever dated anyone older then them or how they think about dating someone a little older then you. <br>  <br>  If they respond positivly introduce your boyfriend. (If you havent).<br>  If they respond negativly, ask them reasons why they find it wrong or why they dont approve.<br>  <br>  Well you are older then 18, so you are an adult. I really think they wouldnt mind.|`|Pw5gZd4Jaa	7yrs is nothing i'm 10 years younger then my husband<br>  the age should not matter, bring your boyfriend to your parents for dinner so they can get to know who he is and not focus on his age difference . it should be about the person not the age|`|FqOewVGcaa	no does not matter as long as you and him are happy and know how to be mature and do the right thing.|`|0VsX3vGzaa	You know, I asked a similar question like this about a girl 8 years younger than me and got a lot of rude remarks.  How come everyone is giving nice ones here?|`|nfhrpTxyaa	my husband is 10 years older than I but if it was my 21 year old daughter I would hit the ceiling just speaking with my mother voice ... <br>  Good Luck|`|yFTev2Pyaa	as long as you fit together age will fade|`|x0pmygthaa	no, i don't think that's a big difference because you are of age. My husband is 8 years older than me and we're still married. we have been married 28 years. but there is no guarantee in life and marriage. if you both get married hope it's a long one. like you said, your parents are just very strict. your an adult now, are are you not? In time, and if they see that he makes you happy they might come around. I have a friend that was dating my neighbors son just years apart from each other and her parents did not like him (they didn't even know him or met him) but because their religion was different he was catholic and her Buddhist that when they decided to move in together, her parents did not want her back. she had to pay for her own schooling, and she was pretty much on her own. but now they like him and all is good. it took them about 6 months to adjust. they are not married yet. I guess that's what hurt her parents the most and felt shame, that their daughter left the house unmarried, nor  engaged. but her love for her boyfriend was more important and her happiness, they are good to each other. they have been together 1 and a half  years. you don't want to hurt your parents feelings, it's just their feelings. they'll get over it. you got to do what u got to do. good luck
ozngXg9waa	Sure, you have the right to be angry. He betrayed conversations that were private. He is avoiding some real issues that he has going on inside of him, I assume. He seems to me that he has some insecurities if he is bringing an old relationship up in a new relationship. He also seems to me like he has a real communication problem. He might be 'doing this to you' to make him feel better about himself. He is doing a dirty version of the blame-game. It hurts more because you probably trusted him during your relationship.<br>  <br>  It takes a lot of time to build up trust. To have that broken is a very intimate hurt. Even if you two are JUST FRIENDS, those feelings that were once cultivated between you take a while to change completely, if they ever do. <br>  <br>  If he is not the kind who is going to apologize and talk through the situation, you need to find a way to make peace within yourself. Basically, you grieving over it is probably not grieving him. <br>  <br>  Maybe take a little time to heal alone, and then when you are ready, you can just tell him that you forgive him. There is so much power in that. It may seem like it's for him; but it's really for you.<br>  <br>  Carrying around hurt is hard, hard work. Know that you didn't make him this way. He has issues of his own. Don't keep taking responsibility for his immaturity.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|yMD13bMTaa	You have every right to be mad! If that's hoe he is acting i mean drop it move on find someone to treat you better. I know it's so easy to say but yet so hard to do but try.|`|L5tWiYOFaa	Move on, find somebody else - plenty more carp in the pond.|`|bXPU7eGwaa	Yeah... Move on, find somebody else he is not ur type...|`|XYECtMg8aa	The way I see it you had a lucky escape! this loser aint worth shedding a single tear over,sorry if I sound a bit harsh but there are plenty more fish in the sea,and one day you will look back and realise you are better off without him,I would be angry too but hes just an immature idiot who doesn,t deserve a nice girl like you,take care x|`|cn04Dmzeaa	This guy sounds like a scum-bag.<br>  <br>  If he left you for your best friend and then didn't own up to his folly with the email, THEN blamed it on you then just think of what is in store in the future. He refuses to take responsibility for his actions and places the blame on everyone but himself, I bet he blames you and your best friend for him leaving you for her.<br>  <br>  You don't deserve that at all and the fact that you're almost just taking this lying down upsets me, I hope you end this poisonous friendship and shed no more tears over the issue, good luck to you.|`|eOU2tlT0aa	Of course you have a right to be angry! Those emails where private and not for this girl to see. it doesn't matter if it was twenty years ago!!!!<br>  Look he doesn't sound like he's the best person for you to be around, if he is thinking you are petty enough to "get back at him" hes not worth it and you know the truth that he is lying!<br>  I know if extremely hard now but let him be an *** and rise above it your worth so much more! <br>  Sounds lie this girl is like just as bad as him and is probably jealous of your friendship! <br>  Your better than these stupid and petty games! <br>  Be angry, stick to your gut feeling!!!|`|psWxRqSfaa	ive had this experience , he liked denied it i hate it so much you just wanna scream and say LOOK YOU F****NG sent them. but keep cool, and be like yeah well you know what you did it say what you like, cuz I KNOW what you did. and just be like yeee ok. to all the lies he says and then he'll get angry.|`|w16Ab2mMaa	He's your ex right? So no more tears. Yep you have a right to be upset about the emails being read by others who they werent meant for, but just let it go as hard as it may seem at this time. The more you fuss about it, the farther you push him away. (is he really worth it?) I think not.<br>  Just a  rule of thumb- never write, email or text anything to anyone, that you wouldnt want everyone to see. That goes for pictures too!|`|9fDkrrFyaa	he has moved on, you should try doing the same........eventhough it pissed you off that he showed her, do not let it get to you<br>  <br>  move on|`|qXpxILnRaa	To me, i've kind of being in the same situation as you. I know that he did love you very much and for some plain reason feels the need to terrorize you and make you feel bad about yourself. It seems like he's trying to hide from his feelings by actually showing this new girl of his about the relationship ya'll had. Also, it sounds like he doesn't have a lot of feelings for the new girl if he is still talking about ya'll relationship. I would definitely just be his friend for now on and not tell him anything secretive at all. The friendship level should probably stay really low. Don't even frequent text him. If he doesn't text or call you, it is not worth it at all. Nothing to gain in the relationship (as friends of course). I really hope my advice works for you! :)|`|5a9xejLBaa	Don't cry sweatheart.|`|Bt81ClpXaa	I didn't even finish reading that, I didn't need to!<br>  <br>  WHAT A NOB!<br>  <br>  Get over him. I know its easier said than done but seriously, he's not worth it. You have every right to be angry! Hell, I'm angry! <br>  <br>  <br>  Just ignore him... The more you show that you care for him and whatever, the more he'll think he can treat you like this! And you definitely don't deserve to be treated like this! <br>  <br>  :)|`|Lwc8BK2Zaa	You have all the right to be angry .. ive had stuff like that done to me .. and seriously if they were in distance of walking i would of done serious damage to them .. i was that angry .. <br>  <br>  iits not right at all to go behind someones back like that .. ive had people go behind my back all too muchh !! <br>  hes probaly scared that you have found out that he sent them .. he might have hoped your best friend wouldnt of said anything to you about them .. hoping she would just laugh at them .. and maybe tryed to stop yuu to being friends .. <br>  <br>  please dont cry over it .. <br>  hes an idiot for letting you go .. and even more so to go behind your back as well .. <br>  lads can be total pr*cks !! and well not all lads are like that but a good 75% aree !! <br>  <br>  sorry to say lads that are reading this .. im not being sexist .. just my point of view ..|`|YbwDFvEaaa	You have every right to be angry in this case. The e-mails you sent him were meant for his eyes only, not for him to use as a conversation topic with another girl, who he consequently left you for. <br>  <br>  He sounds rather immature and self-righteous. I wouldn't even want to attempt friendship with someone of that nature. If I were you, I would distance myself from him and get him out of my life. Anyone who would abuse your confidence like that is not a person who you want to associate with by any means.
CRk1goz4aa	He's still little...try to be patient (although I don't blame you). <br>  Rewards work really really well. Whenever he does something good...give him a (MINI) chocolate candy or something...and say, "thank you for...." Whenever he does something bad, or is missbehaving...tell him, that doesn't deserve a chocolate (or whatever it is he likes). And....try to take him places where he's running and playing and exerts energy, that will tire him out. As for the yelling...I know it's hard, but ignore it....walk away and just pay him no mind.|`|PTshTOSUaa	well this isnt your problem. your parents need to teach him whats right and wrong and shouldnt count on you to teach him. when hes being a jerk just go outside or into another room and ignore him. someday they will all realize how bad he is.|`|jhiLR6YHaa	picture books and M&Ms usually work|`|paCHaDWVaa	You can't do anything. I have a 3 year old son. Boys will be boys. My son has his sweet moments and his rotten moments. I also have a 5 year old daughter and she is kind of the same way. He will change when he gets older. Be patient with him. And I don't think that he is being a horrible kid, he is just testing everyone to see what he can get away with. When my son misbehaves we let him know that its wrong. In your spare time you could probably sit down and play games with him if you wanted. If he isn't getting enough attention from your parents he might be trying to get it from you.|`|L2UEI99Baa	the best thing for you to do<br>  is when he acts badly jus' ignore him<br>  when he is good give him attention<br>  <br>  he will eventually learn [week or 2]<br>  that the only way to get attention<br>  is to behave in a nice manor|`|nhvVhsixaa	punch him in the face|`|JWNzoksmaa	without your parents guidance..i'm sorry but there's no hope for that brat.  i feel sorry more for him, b/c i can guarantee you...he'll be 30 years old still living at home with mom and dad, probably playing video games in the basement with no girlfriend b/c he can't handle real world rejection.  B/C your parents never taught him consequences for his actions.  So when it's time for him to go out into the world he'll fail miserably and come running back home and never leave again b/c the real world will not treat with such nonchalant attitude. <br>  <br>  Your parents sound irresponsible.|`|MXih8N3Xaa	I guess it's just him growing up and not understanding what is right from wrong. But you need to talk to your parents, they're the ones who are supposed to be the main example and main ones to deal with his bad behavior. You are 14 after all and only his sister. And if his behavior isn't improving you need to be away from him so you keep calm and not stress out.<br>  However you can try and control those moments before he gets out of hand. And not let him get involved in those situations as best you can. He needs control and structure in his life and proper discipline.|`|MvC6n3DWaa	He is 3 and acting his age. You cannot expect to sit him down and understand what you want. It takes time. <br>  <br>  Talk to your parents and tell them you are confused (even if you are not). On one hand you are not supposed to say anything, but when he gets out of control, you get in trouble for not correcting him. You need guidelines as to what they specifically expect. They should be able to tell exactly how they want you to handle the situation. <br>  <br>  Three year olds are active and do not have a firm understanding of boundaries. Plus, he has a lot of energy! That makes a long day. You were not different, maybe not as active, but still a 3 year old. He does not undrestand how other people feel and will not even entertain the idea that others have feelings until age 5. It is what it is.<br>  <br>  Be patient and it will get better.|`|hV5eWXpsaa	oh gosh. I know exactly how you feel. My little sister is such a brat. I'll tell you right out. But whenever I talk about how no one does anything to punish her or whatever, my parents just get really mad at me. So I decided I would just keep my distance whenever she gets annoying and let them deal with it.

ec03b2a20421f3fae6a418ec585000e3aa	pienso q debes tener y dejar muy claro a kien le corresponde la educacion de los hijos... y es precisamente a los padres. tienes q platicar con tu esposo y llegar al acuerdo de hablar con su familia para dejarles en claro que la educacion religiosa de tus hijos es solamente responsabilidad de ustedes que son sus padres y no de los abuelos. Tus suegros ya hicieron lo propio con tu esposo, lo educaron y al final él decidio q camino seguir... allá termina la responsabilidad de ellos. Es algo delicado tratar de esos asuntos, pues se puede volver un poco tenso el trato a partir de ahora. Lo q no me quedo claro es qué opina tu esposo, de qué religión es él.

zVLXJcsgaa	ok. well thing is, i was in the same situation a few months ago. =)<br>  i was really tense and nervous...but when i was chilling with my girlfriend, it just came really naturally. umm...there's not really any  advice i can give...but i think it's better to be standing up while kissing the first time. haha, sitting down can be a bit awkward. but...umm, just do it spontaneously. its how i did.<br>  <br>  but i mean, if it's any help for you, i can give u this link...and it can teach you a bit about how to do it. lol. btw, i advise not to use tongue the first time you kiss, and to take it kind of slowly. haha.<br>  <br>  here, check this out:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej0p72KvA6I" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej0p72KvA...</a><br>  <br>  i hope i was able to help...and have fun! stay safe!|`|pUulqtLGaa	look into each other eyes let him or her get into it and tthen u guys will feel lip to lip nd next thing u know u guys r kissing... muah|`|0qHCqkLgaa	i kiss with my lips... what do you use?|`|PmOLjUXcaa	people always say it comes naturally but it does...kinda but for me it was really scary cuz i was so scared i was going to mess up when i did i didn't mess up cuz you just have to let your self calm down you will get that feeling when its going to happen. the way you kiss a guy im guessing. is You just kiss them lightly don't push too hard cuz that's very unattractive.. and also when you are don't let your arms hang at your sides but them on his lap or hold his hands. and also don't just have a dull kiss make it special no one kisses the same just don't try hard and just think while your kissing him how much you like it don't think about if your going to mess up and stuff this helped me on my first kiss i hope it helps you :)<br>  <br>  P.s. always make sure your lips arent dry or too wet.|`|gqHy3821aa	<a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Category:Kissing" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Category:Kissing</a><br>  <br>  This site has articles on everything haha.|`|pRNi1jdZaa	This is a very good tip. <br>  <br>  You look at his eyes<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  and then lean in.<br>  <br>  and put your lips on his.<br>  <br>  <br>  Duh.|`|PY160XO7aa	It comes natural|`|c8xptNSGaa	um well to tell you the truth, you dont just plan on kissing, me and my boyfriend for instance...it just comes to us naturally. when we have a feeling were we want to smooch, then he scoots closer to me, i get closer to his face...and we just do it. dont worry about it..idk if your boy or girl but usually the boy is suppose to start it=) but if you really desperat let me tell you this: to kiss you usually start out with laugh at something stupid or just something he did, and you guys start having a sexy fealing... tell him/her to meet you somwhere privet where theres nobody but you too. then you just start from getting closer...closer...closer you put your lips to him/her and while your doing it stick your tongue in his/her mouth get a sexxi taste of him/her ! ;) yeah well then if you want to,  you could go to the next stage after that... if you need some tips on that..then just ask and ill answer=) <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>   well hope i helped you out...GOOOOOOOD LUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|wJoVCgI3aa	just lean forward and hope he does the rest lol|`|J79ecFcPaa	haha o dam....well u culd google it haha
de64cc5c3f0206a642183ad28321f7d6aa	I don't think that he sees you as more than a friend. From the details, it seems as if he sees you as his new best friend-which is not so bad. I mean, he feels close enough to you to play with your hair. But even if he doesn't see you as more than a friend, you should take a chance and go for it. MAKE him see you as more than a friend OR you could wait it out. Sometimes, people tend to realize things later in life. The question to ask yourself is, "Is he worth the wait?" , "Is it worth putting your heart out on the line?"|`|aea3823f686ae88a62c5170226ebbd75aa	hes probably shy to say he likes you, and he sounds like a great guy. if you two are that close and you have a good "Feeling" about him, tell him! he might not be ready to start a committed relationship yet so tell him at a time you both think is right for you. good luck!
4UvHtnAhaa	He probably likes you. Find out if those girls came after him, or he went after them. Some guys prefer if the girl makes the first move, others like to make the first move. The guys that don't make first moves don't make them because of fear of rejection AND they like to know that a girl finds him attractive. A thought like "If she digs me, she'll come to me. Otherwise, I'm not moving, I don't wanna mess up this bond I already have with her." Tell him you think he's cute, invite him to a movie, just you and him. Do something that show's your interested. Be bold. If he rejects you, don't feel awkward around him. The idea that you like him will be in the back of his mind for days and days, maybe even months, maybe forever. He might end up coming around if he has time to think about it.|`|AA11399432	I hate to dissappoint but it sounds like you are just a friend.|`|Q8OYzvz6aa	Girl, he is just confused and has no idea what he wants.

No matter what she says, if they were dating before, theres a chance that shey might still like him.

That's how insecurity drives partners away. Your partner would want to have a life of his/her own without anybody trying to sneak up on them all the time and trying to know if they ain't cheating.<br>  Remember that if you keep on pushing your partner's button he/she will definitely get loose.If you are always suspicious of your partner,he/she will give you a cause to confirm your suspicion.Sometimes,he/she might not be thinking of cheating on you but  since you suspect him ,he does it.Nobody would want to be in a "mum-son or dad-daughter" affair.They don't want you to be treating them like their mum or dad would do.Everybody looks for partner but not second parents.<br>  if you are scare,you'll definitely be at the center of unfaithfulness. being scared makes you weak and unable to stand up for yourself. if a relationship is going bad,don't look desperate to hold onto it because sometimes you end up making huge unnecessary loses.<br>  Don't accept just anything because you're desperate. Guys want to do the chase,so if you look desperate to keep them,then there's no chase and the game is over.<br>  Being good,calm or whatever you describe yourself doesn't mean you should accept "no" when it should be "yes."<br>  Guys adore strong women and so your weakness isn't helping you either. Don't do things you might regret. if doing good hurts,don't do it. Even the Bible wants people to do good from their hearts,so if you are worried about some good thing you're doing,it's wiser to stop it because you gain no blessings from it.<br>  Just say "no" if you have to and "yes" if you to.don't compromise on your principles.They make you who you are.<br>  stand up for yourself and it will yield results.|`|db41c158c6116c2c2332bf79ec3303fcaa	you are SCARED to say NO to people. <br>  i used to be like that, and you won't learn until you get SICK of people taking advantage of you.|`|1ea0dc060b4d1a76a570ffe631edaca9aa	its all Fear   and when you get over your  fear you will do great things|`|6wFiJmwfaa	because you don't know how to say NO !  if you don't want to do it don't do it be your own person don't let people push you around.|`|99cfffca1ec95668456dd5359550556baa	Girls always aks me to go to bed with them because i am so easy.

Why don't you email each other, or IM?|`|ETnVsasFaa	Run away to Mexico together|`|3X5ed7sEaa	well... you should let her know how much you luv her and tell her that if it waz under your control 2 move in the city she lives in you would do it. even if it ment giving up your dream or all u have worked 4, bcuz you would rather be with her than anyone one else.<br>  <br>  if you tell your lover that she will love u 4 the rest of her life.<br>  <br>  p.s. don't make promises that you can't keep. and tell her you luv her and you miss her EVERYTIME you talk 2 her.|`|5NUed7hraa	You need to call her and ask her to meet you some place.|`|7dc4bc26f79027da226a7e8903708789aa	seems like you were getting along fine...but like you said love is about compromising....but love ISNT compromising on the whole.....if you can make soooo much effort to talk to her....she has to learn to make her share of risks too right??....Think about it....don't let her play with your heart like that...
HPfTsg61aa	Yo pienso que eso no tiene nada que ver! Pues los ingleses son muchos y solo vas a conocer uno! que m imagino tiene su propia personalidad..y tu también tienes la tuya..por eso le gustas y quiere conocerte!<br>  <br>  Me imagino que estas emocionadisima.....esta bien la idea de irte a la playa....pues en Inglaterra como que no toman mucho sol y te vas a ver bien bonita y bronceadita jajajaja...pero mi mejor consejo es que trates de ser tu misma..pues el debe gustar de ti como eres! saludos y mucha suerte!! espero que todo sea  muy emocionate!!|`|750IImWZaa	Yo creo que les gustan morenas,no crees que ya estan bastante aburridos de las rubias inglesas......|`|LKiwJInMaa	Solo se tu misma, arreglate lo mejor que puedas, nada extravagante, no mucho maquillaje, y un buen perfume, sonrie y mucha suerte.|`|a34547c599bf94d30b46c11bcd9717c9aa	A los ingleses les fascinan las morenas...

HWqQtZxtaa	El mate es infaltable.. Por la ma?ana antes de salir para el trabajo, siempre tomo algunos. Es lo mejor para compartir una charla con gente querida, para mí no hay nada más lindo que llegar con mi familia o a lo de un amigo y que me digan "querés unos mates?". Cuando es alguien que no conocés mucho, invitarle un mate rompe el hielo e invita a la confianza, ayuda porque da una sensación de familiaridad. Es una gran compa?ía para las interminables jornadas de estudio, para los momentos en que se necesita estar solo y pensar.. En fin, como dije al principio, es infaltable :)|`|e8FyrV0Maa	Una vez lo probe  pero la verdad no es mi predileccion, yo no puedo vivir sin la Coca-cola, sin la carne, sin el cafe y sin la sal... pero igual me imagino que si hubiera nacido en un pais con tradicion de tomar mate no podria vivir sin ella..!!!!!!!|`|fcff9609728c42a446569d60ca431e19aa	Ninguno, no tomo mate|`|jN7XGohWaa	jaja no hace falta aclarar que respondan aquellos que lo toman, aquellos que ponen es INFLATABLE o cosas por le estilo.. ya ta! SOMOS ARGENTINOS que otro rol mas que parte fundamental de la vida puede cumplir el mate???<br>  te podria enumerar mil cosas pero la verdad es al reves: PARA MI TODO SE SOLUCIONA CON UNOS BUENOS MATES! y no puedo estar sin el mate mas de algunas horas de hecho hoy en dia estoy luchando en mi trabajo por lograr que me dejen tenerlo.. pero el mate es compartir, disfrutar, sola tambien es incomparable, tomarte unos amargos a la ma?ana te da pila, t da vida.. aguante el mate!|`|521a2090e2f2727d65858cceb885054aaa	mmmm no tengo idea que es eso....pero me gustaria saberlo....|`|2d4c91973d661a131c6c93ced9fd13a7aa	yo no puedo estar sin tomar mate.-<br>  e muy importante para mi desayuno si no lo tengo me pongo de muy mal humor-<br>  también soy Argentina.-<br>  <br>  besos

UQJ4ZnVdaa	No existe una edad definitiva para sentir el amor al que te refieres con un chico. <br>  El amor lo tienes tú al alcance de tus manos, o de tu mente, pues el ser humano tiene la capacidad de producir toda clase de sentimientos, amor, tristeza, odio, miedo, etc.<br>  Estos pensamientos se generan en el cerebro, positivos o negativos, los cuales transmite a tu mente, ésta los procesa haciéndote sentir un estado de ánimo feliz o infeliz, alegre o triste, entusiasta o apático, según tus deseos, según los pensamientos que hayas seleccionado en tu cerebro.<br>  Todo lo que se siembra se cosecha, hay que dar para recibir.<br>  Siembra amor y cosecharás amor. Da cari?o, comprensión, atenciones, compa?ía, cosecharás lo mismo, pero con creces, en abundancia.<br>  Si das una bofetada, aguas, porque te van a dar una madriza, jajaja.<br>  Así que cuidado con los pensamientos que generas en tu cerebro.|`|664dc6089d20aea152bf16cc4ac1c796aa	cuando te ames,y estés lista para ofrecer el mismo amor que tu te tengas,en ese momento no te importara si es feo o guapo,tu amor sera incondicional,dios te bendice.|`|kUOmNroRaa	Tranquiiiiiiiiila.

ZGGKvhuxaa	Horrified...not about the mole. But that she got a tattoo ofyour FACE on her back. Thats creepy. Maybe if you're married she can get like a symbol thats important to you two but your face? I'm seeing red flags...|`|VkyjGWZ8aa	I have two questions of young women who have tattoos. I know the answer to the first one, it's Yes.<br>  <br>  Is it true that people who get tattoos are more likely to become risk takers?<br>  <br>  And the second one is "Do you have any plans about how you will explain that to your granddaughters?"|`|e5f577f8716d7e8519ee91b004db903eaa	umm.... if i were you i would be flattered by the fact that she would want my face on her back... but i wouldn't think it looks attractive at all...|`|t676b3abaa	let it go or if she has a good since of humor u guys cab joke about it and thats love|`|9137e5121a8e24b4f443526bb8b0d288aa	Eh, that's a little strange, especially if you are not married. Kind of stalkerish if you ask me. If you break up she will have a constant reminder of you......freaky stuff!!! I would be a little alarmed.|`|5dxeUFloaa	Hopefully you REALLY want to be with her... but I would think that's weird too. And as for the mole, that's kind of iffy. You would want to tell her cause you don't want to keep anything from her. But if you tell her, she's probably gonna get really upset, and there's nothing she can do about it... She's stuck with the tat now.<br>  <br>  Good luck though...
nXj7Mw8paa	well you cant just get girlfriends, you will just stumble upon them. ya know, u think she's cute, she'll think ur cute, u get together, have fun for like 3months, and then u'll break up. it happens in every relationship. its better if u dont think about it, cause thanks when unexpected things happen.|`|AA12369504	Talk, meet and socialise|`|vEwVKKDjaa	musterbating|`|Rtn8kXsAaa	It depends on your age.|`|d095b2c7f08e637581f226c22ff9fbf7aa	keep trying dhoondhne se to bhagwan bhi milta hai

It sounds like, from what I can decipher, this guy is acting more like a domineering husband or boyfriend than a friend.  This sounds like the type of guy who becomes a wife beater or something.  I would recommend distancing yourself from him for your own safety if this behavior continues, & simply tell him flat out that you'll be friends with whoever you wish, & he ahs no right to tell you who you can & can't have as friends.  If I had a friend, girlfriend, or even a wife try to tell me I couldn't be friends with someone, I would tell her quite bluntly she was crossing a line she shouldn't cross, & stepping outside her rights where I'm concerned.<br>  <br>  It would help to know what country you're from because customs there may be different.  I can tell you aren't from a country where English is your native language by the manner in which you type, no offense intended.  Perhaps men from the country where you live would have a better insight into his behavior, if your customs are very different from mine.  I live in America, & there aren't many women who would tolerate such behavior from a man, unless they need psychiatric help.|`|m1T9r0ooaa	yeah i think he likes u but he may be obsessed!

b17f84abcebf99241bf560670e03fa98aa	Hola Raul:<br>               Hay algunos planteos simples que tendrias y tendrian que hacerse. Primero que nada, ?Ella te dijo que tiene miedo de que la dejes, te lo confeso y al parecer te dio se?ales de que se siente poca cosa o esto es lo que vos pensas? Te lo pregunto porque no es lo mismo en un caso o en el otro. <br>  <br>               Si te lo confeso, eso es un muy buen paso, ya que esta admitiendo su debilidad y que no puede controlar su inseguridad, que se le esta 'escapando de las manos' el asunto y eso la desborda. En ese caso ella estaria admitiendo su debilidad o flaqueza, lo cual, de entrada, esto es parte del comienzo para el cambio o de la solucion. Se entiende?<br>  <br>  S en cambio es algo que vos ves, pero nunca te lo dijo abiertamente o no dio indicios claros de su dificultad, eso significaria que ella no lo admitiera y solo veria que el problema lo tenes vos o vos se lo provocas como si fuera que la estas insultando, hay seria mucho mas dificil ayudarla a considerar que su planteo es erroneo. <br>  <br>  Y no complejizemos el asunto con que los celos son cosa de mujeres o es un problema de genero, porque asi nos vamos por las ramas, nos dispersamos! Todos sabemos de casos de tipos terriblemente celosos que son capaces de hacer lo que la sociedad y la pasividad de las mujeres no las anima a hacer: actuar y tomar represalias, amenazar, desquiciarse, es decir, salirse "de las casillas" pero de mal modo!<br>  <br>  Y decir que esto es:<br>                    -incurable, que es para todoa la vida, es pasar por alto que este tipo de problematicas mentales se basan en traumas formados en el pasado y que pueden ser abordados psicologicamente con cualquier psicologo "normal" (no hablo de psiquiatras!). La experiencia en terapias tradicionales demuestra que si es tratable. Pero ver el tema como si ella estuviera "estigmatizada" o "endemoniada" (por exagerar los terminos) solo hace que nos estanquemos en el problema y no percibamos los puntos de luz que ayudarian a resolverlo.<br>  <br>                  - que va a ser la ruina de la pareja, etc, etc. tambien es otra forma de demonizar algo que es sumamente comun en las parejas y mas considerando que venimos de una sociedad que nos ha educado para percibir que somos no individuos completos, sino "medias naranjas" o sea seres deficientes, incompletos en si mismos y esto es una idiotez!<br>  <br>  Las 2 preguntas importantes que tendrias que hacerle es: ?Ella te ama realmente? Y ?Vos, la amas realmente? Si es asi: ?Y? ?...? ?Entonces? ?Donde esta el problema? Si vos te sentis lo suficientemente seguro para no dejarla, para no ir detras de otras, donde esta el problema? <br>  <br>  Estaria bueno que ella vea todo lo que opina la gente, que lea todas estas lineas (o se lo imprimas) y lo medite. Y si, buscar asistencia, que al fin y al cabo no tiene nada de malo. La gente confunde que si le recomiendan que debe ir al psicologo es porque esta "de lo peor" y se pone a la defensiva... sin embarogo todos tenemos traumas formados como producto de vivir en una sociedad altamente competitiva! Lo han notado? Te deseo suerte Paul! Cristian.|`|1VMaLJJbaa	Es difícil, porque acá el `problema no sos vos, sino ella y su inseguridad. Por más que le prometas el oro y el moro, va a dudar de hasta las cosas más insignificantes.<br>  Ella es la que tiene que cambiar, por ahí con un psicólogo soluciona es problema de autoestima baja que tiene.<br>  suerte.|`|IqEw0RBnaa	mira amiga es facil lo que te hace infeliz aprieta a tu corazon y no lo deja vivir al cien por ciento <br>  lo que lo hace feliz y pleno quieres mas amas mas y das mas|`|e5G9ZcIpaa	eso es inmadurez e inseguridad... dejala por un tiempo pa que se le quite la estupides!!! alguna chica puede creer en los hombre????? no todos queremos solo sexo...|`|467bf7d600739d3cbbb198b5f8aa4ff3aa	Tu novia debe estar buenisima, porque si no, no me lo explico.<br>  ?Seguro que quieres pasar el resto de tu vida a su lado?<br>  Háztelo mirar, anda.<br>  Suerte.|`|4W1UD3Dmaa	hola<br>  si hasi es de novios imaginate casados no te va adejar tranquilo los celos nunca se quitan con el tiempo es mucho peor yo de ti pensara si me gustaria vivir una vida haci tener una persona celosa a nuestro lado es lo horrible.|`|5TGKobMOaa	Por algún motivo las mujeres siempre tenemos miedo a que nos dejen aunque no haya razón alguna, somos celosas de lo que consideramos como nuestro, y no queremos que nos lo quiten habla con ella.|`|7b66025336309eda580a482d7642daadaa	ella no confía en si misma y ese es un problema de ella en el que no puedes ayudar si no lo acepta, es muy romántico querer a alguien a pesar de todo, pero se convierte en tragedia cuando se llega a la vida en común, los celos son una enfermedad que crece, son adictivos y destructivos, la mejor manera de ayudarla es convencerla de buscar un especialista y por tu bien, aléjate ya, suena mal, pero si la dejas ella tendra que enfrentar su problema, mientras sigas ahí ni cuenta se dará porque tu lo camuflajeas, ok?, suerte!!!|`|8GaUXpcraa	me la presentas y vas a ver como empezas a desconfiar de ella, asi emparejamos el asunto por lo menos.<br>  <br>  y sino te pasas por esta pagina, asi te reis un rato.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.palimpalem.com/5/elguason/" rel="nofollow">http://www.palimpalem.com/5/elguason/</a><br>  <br>  elguason|`|94e78c6112c28ba5c77ba28cc8c82e5eaa	No para nada, de tí no desconfía.<br>  Ella desconfía de si misma, ya que tiene un problema un tanto fuerte con su inseguridad. Ella en lugar de socializar con tu circulo social, lo ve como una amenaza y piensa que sólamente teniendote para ella sola, casi casi encerrado, podrá sentir que realmente le quieres, pero está mal.<br>  <br>  No dudo que le hagas sentirse amada y como la única, por lo que tú le estás dando, no tienes porque preocuparte, más bien, de la percepción de si misma, ya que con lo celosa que es, muestra claramente que tiene un problema de inseguridad.<br>  Habla con ella de sugerirle ir a ver a un profesional para que le ayude a valorarse y quererse, esto con el fin de que ella entienda que no tiene nada de malo que tengas un círculo social y de que puede pertenecer a él y evidentemente, poder continuar con la relación por muchos a?os más, porque su problema, a la larga ocasionará broncas en tí y te alejará de la gente que más quieres porque ella, es insegura. Mientras más pronto puedas echarle un cable, será mejor para ambos y su vida futura.<br>  ánimo|`|aOMQwgdKaa	El problema no es precisamente que ella desconfié de ti, si no que desconfía de ella misma, los celos solo son falta de seguridad y confianza en si mismo, pensar que no somos lo suficiente para la personas que amamos, y que en cualquier esquina hay otras mucho mejores que nosotras en todos los aspectos... así como también esta el hecho de que amamos tanto a nuestro novio, y sabemos lo maravilloso que es, que creemos que cuanta vieja pasa por su lado se le va a lanzar como lobo a un cordero y este va a caer redondito en las garras de la arpía...<br>  <br>  Habla con ella y explica le las cosas así como te estas expresando aquí, dile que ella es la única, que la amas que es la persona mas maravillosa y única que hay para ti, que la coincidieras la princesa de tu cuento, que no crees jamas encontrar a alguien mas hermosa que ella, y lo que mas deseas es pasar el resto de tu vida a su lado... pero eso si, dice lo de corazón, con el alma, no solo de dientes para afuera, que nosotras aunque celosas y todo, sabemos cuando nos están diciendo la verdad... de este modo también hazla sentir especial con llamadas, mensajes, detalles, sorpresas, etc... no es necesario que se ven todos los días, si cuando no se ven tu le demuestras que la tienes presente en cada minuto que transcurre... un día mandale varios mensajes, al otro llamala, el otro enviale un arreglo de flores, el otro si tienes tiempo libre ponte de acuerdo con alguien para que vaya a recogerla sin decirle muy bien a donde van y que la lleve adonde previamente le preparaste alguna cena, etc etc etc...|`|ccfwYELcaa	Yo creo que no es que desconfíe de tí, sino que te quiere mucho y no quiere perderte, ella solo está cuidando lo que tiene, no crees??, tal vez, tú no seas lo suficientemente celoso y no le demuestras que la quieres y ella piensa que la vas a dejar, eso pasa a veces, es normal en las parejas, eso pasa, hasta en las mejores familias.<br>  Besos. Mua........................................<br>  Suerte con tu novia, ok??|`|5754b83e577305e6fddbfbe51c785196aa	Cuando el río suena....agua lleva.<br>  ?Le das motivos?, de lo contrario es que tiene mucha inseguridad|`|dbc8bcf0b212bbddf86f01d8671a1aa8aa	esa desconfiaza los va a llevar a la separacion lo peor en el mundo es no tener confianza enla pareja asi aque deberias hablar claro con ella y aclararle las cosas porque ahora casi no la vas a ver de verdad no se que hara ella sin ti tanto tiempo lo unico que te dijo hablen y aclara las cosas con ellas para que puedan seguir adelante hasta el dia que se casen. suerte|`|xWPHZrjIaa	las mujeres solemos ser bastante desconfiandas... eso tiene mucho que ver con nuestra estima, quizá también de que se siente insegura de lo que significa para ti... trata de hacerla sentir bien y que a pesar de la distancia y el tiempo seguirán siendo los mismos... mímala pero tampoco te cierres a la amistad con otras personas...|`|yK0wff4baa	Es algo que tu novia siempre va ser..."celosa" eso no se quita con el tiempo y si ella no te tiene confianza nunca cambiara, piensalo muy bien ante de que sea muy tarde.|`|VpSWq73Baa	Hazla sentir segura, dile más veces que la quieres, llámala más, ves a verla más, sorprendela, hazla sentir especial! <br>  Algo que le ayudaria es dejar de obsesionarte por tu fidelidad y preocuparse más por su felicidad y la vuestra.|`|a5f6b8d59ad66028c633246d21b351e7aa	hola como estas? bueno en principio te digo que los celos no se le van a ir, si ya es celosa vas a tener que acarrear con eso siempre, y después te digo lo que pienso a mi entender el problema no sos vos, no es que no confié en vos, es en ella misma en quien no confía, vos estas seguro de y con quien queres estar, ella esta segura solo de con quien quiere estar pero no de ella, esa es mi humilde opinión, espero que tengas suerte, saludos, Dany
c2g5tpSwaa	A lot of guys are like you. And maybe even the girls that you think are a 10 other guys might think are an 8. I think you will know when you have met the right one. When you meet the right girl, her looks wont matter.|`|vZhVSYDMaa	Yeah, if you want a girlfriend to last a while you need to be a little less shallow
oOD3dYaNaa	That sounds great! That way if anything negative does happen, she'll at least know that you had the time and decency to think of her and her well-being. And it's romantic, which girls love! =]|`|8PvqsOt8aa	If you can write better than you did here then I would say yes, there is nothing wrong with expressing yourself in a letter, the up side is that you get to say everything you wanted and think about it before you say it, the down side is that it is not Truly from the heart as it is rehearsed and would mean more to her if you just went up and said it. If you want send a letter, but even a blubbering stumbling talking to her would be better.|`|hXCBJTAOaa	I think a letter would be a nice way to break the ice. And while she is gone you all can stay in touch by phone.|`|AA11108018	If you talk with her on a regular bases than you should if she has a b/f.

I think if I got a letter like that from a grown *** man I would totally RUN the opposite direction|`|9lGnGBL0aa	Join the community<br>  <br>  You can start with double your dating by david deangelo<br>  <br>  you should be able to find a torrent for that.<br>  <br>  this is dominic,<br>  <br>  i'll see you in the field|`|IgcLdwItaa	bad idea! i say that if you want to ask her out then you should do it because take it from another girl|`|vu6R7pPEaa	alright i'm not trying to be mean here, but like please i beg you DON'T do it. I'm a girl who has a gotten a couple letters from guys and it kinda just freaks me out. e-mail, text, and IMs are good but letters are dont. if your not close enough to her to even have her number than try walking up to her and being a man and telling her your going to miss her. or you can even jokingly be like "dude, i'm going to miss you soo much. whose going to (insert task) and take the blame when i mess up?" you'll get the message across and she won't think your a complete tool. hope this hellped. good luck : )|`|xJBJn6dOaa	yeah, try asking her out before she leaves. Is she going somewhere far? If not, you can always ask her if you can visit or something (just say something like... I've always wanted to go there, if I do plan a trip, could I come see you or something?)|`|EdidZdtlaa	i think a letter would be fine but dont make it sound like your desperate you kno even if you are dont make it seem that way. good luck
ZmdIlkpQaa	If you are confining yourself to Islam, then I cannot answer intelligently, I'm afraid.  <br>  <br>  However, if you broaden the scope of the question to include all polyamorous relationships, then I can speak from experience about one format.  <br>  <br>  My wife of twenty years invited another woman to join our household 15 years ago.  We three love each other very much, and we sleep in the same bed most every night.  I have children by both women.  We each share each other with the other.  Admittedly, this relationship is largely based on the fact that both my wife and our Companion are bisexual.  I honestly do not know for sure how things would work in a situation where the women didn't love each other as much as their husband.  <br>  <br>  Additionally, I would note that many women do not feel as territorial and jealous as Western Culture teaches women should.  I knew women in their 60's and 70's who would arrange for their husband's visits to a "working woman" now and again, because they had lower sex drives than their husbands and were grateful for the break the visits gave them.  Some women appear to appreciate the help of a sister wife in doing their chores, but again, as a man, I don't really have much insight into the psychology of those sorts of relationships that you ask about.|`|fRIEHBJOaa	it's what they're use to. it's the normal. and, of course, they don't have say. i think they can marry someone that wants only one wife, but who's to say that husband doesnt change his mind later on. i dont know if that wife would leave or get a divorce or even if she's allowed to. i dont know much about islam culture. maybe you should look it up.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  men beat their wives and kill there here, in the United States, or havent you read the news?|`|x0pmygthaa	well i know that in the old testament the man were in titled to more then one wife, but the way I see it it's because the wife could not give her husband babies, so the wives would use there maidens or sisters to give them babies, but that is not how God intended it to be. did God give adam one woman or more?|`|1epjqrflaa	That County is disgusting and primitive as hell, what do you expect? They also can beat their wives, and kill them if they want. Pieces of shi*, I feel horrible for the women that were born there and have no choices or thoughts of their own.|`|CQsD09D6aa	The women don't have much choice. They are taught to obey their husbands and that's what they do.|`|Pj81dRTAaa	Hi there, I'm a Muslim guy, maybe I can help. Before I start, I shall first say that no matter how well I explain this to you, I doubt that you would understand. Anyways...<br>  <br>  I'm from the Caribbean, and there are some Muslim men here who have more than one wives. Contrary to what most people think, Muslim women DO have a choice. In Islaam there is a marriage contract (totally separate from the legal system) where the parties can agree to a certain code of conduct. So if I don't want my wife to work for example (Yes Muslim women are allowed to work), I can put this in our contract. Or if she wants me to give her a portion of my monthly salary, this can be put in the contract. SO if a woman does not want her husband to get another wife, they can agree to this and put it in the contract. If any party breaks the contract, then they can divorce, and sin would be upon the person who broke his word.<br>  <br>    Now, concerning women who actually agree to this. In my country, many of these women are converts to Islaam who have had kids before, outside of marriage. Others are ones whose husbands have died, in prison, or abandoned the family. In these cases, the women need a father figure for the kids, but which single guy would get married to a such a woman with kids? I'm sure you'd agree that not many would.<br>  <br>    Other women are those who have matured and their husbands have passed away, or divorced and they cannot find a single husband, so they settle for one who already has a wife.<br>  <br>    Finally, there are those with no such baggage. They are single and a Muslim guy proposes who already has a wife, and the woman accepts.  All parties involved agree to the arrangements and the co-wives live quite happily (not in the same house though and FYI a man cannot have both his wives at the same time if you know what I mean). I know of co-wives who are good friends in my country, they even go shopping together. Once all are treated equally, there is usually no problem.|`|yFTev2Pyaa	a man can't take care of himself let alone a wife and family and thats reaching for the brass ring.two or more wives is just showing women that men are pigs and greedy.men need to learn to properly take care of one woman only.cuz so far i havent seenany impovements on mens behavier.

UwwScmlzaa	This really depends on the personalities of you, your spouse-to-be, and your guests.  For some people, the food or snacks themselves are plenty of entertainment (I've seen plenty of adults get so entertained by a chocolate fountain that they end up with a large amount of chocolate on their faces and do not realize it for some time).<br>  <br>  You may also want to consider ideas that will help you remember your wedding reception.  Cameras on the tables are a common way of doing this.  Some couples also choose to let guest help put together a scrap book. (More information about this one can be found at the referenced site below.)<br>  <br>  I have also seen games played at receptions.  Usually, these are games that involve all of the guests and also can also serve as ice breakers.  Sometimes, a DJ will begin the dancing with a dance that everyone participates in but with the focus on the new couple.<br>  <br>  As others have said, people will often find ways to entertain themselves.  Use your judgment as to what is most fitting to you as a couple and to the guests who will be celebrating with you.|`|QbnjH1ssaa	Congrats! Me and my fiance are planning our weddng right now and had a similar worry.  We came to the conclusion that as long as the booze is flowing and some upbeat songs are on, the dancing will pretty much come naturally.  A DJ (or band) who does a lot of weddings, should be able to read the crowd and play songs that will get em dancing.|`|ODYrypwaaa	We made questions to ask others at the table.  They were printed in our colors to match the wedding and add to decor.  One side were question to ask like how do you know the bride and/or groom?  Who at the table traveled the farthest?  and on the other side we asked question like Where did the bride and Groom meet?  Where was their first kiss? and then we printed the answer upside down on the same side.  Also Oriental trading company online has coloring pages for the kids with a wedding theme.|`|mvKDbb2uaa	Don't dwell on this too much.  People entertain themselves.  If it's within your budget to hire a dance instructor, then would be cute; but so long as there's food and drink and music and conversation, they will be fine.|`|ge3meKYEaa	Adults can entertain themselves, only children need set activities.<br>  <br>  Food, drink and music is plenty- people can talk if they don't want to dance but you would be surprised how many people dance at wedding- you just might need more slow songs then fast.

iDYuSAynaa	it is very possible that she might like you. otherwise, she might just want some company. but girls really want to get to know guys if they find them physically attractive, so if they're brave enough, they'll initiate the convo|`|sxwIYJ0paa	she might be interested. . .or maybe you just look like the safari type.|`|ch8DC4z7aa	Sometimes we are just being nice and trying to be friendly.

It's called making friends I guess. xD<br>  Hmm.. That's all I can really think of x3
yZuwjNtfaa	You don't have to say sorry for writing a lot, we want to know what yu are really thinking so we can help you. writing things out really helps people. i think you should tell your dad you know about the other women and if he look at you like he's stupid or don't have anything to say, then its true. Then you should get all mad and tough with him and be like, if you don't stop this then im tell every body what you are doing. He's not going to want all of his family and freinds to know about it. There always comes a time when a son has to get to his father's levels and talk to him like a grown man and i thinks this is you time. what ever you do, i hope everything works out and i will pray for you because this is really heartbreaking for a child.....GOOD LUCK! ?|`|jhiLR6YHaa	It's not your problem, but if it gets to the point your family is getting torn apart, leave a note, write a letter, do what you feel is best for your family.|`|Cgrd1CWoaa	i the whole thing sound a little funny i would talk to your dad first and get to the bottom of things and if your dads not willing to be a man and tell you mom i think you have to step to the plate he really shouldn't have put you in a situation lie that- i hope things get better|`|hV5eWXpsaa	I think you should ask him who's hat it was. If he gets really defensive, just tell him you love him but you want to know what's going on. Don't go to your mom before you talk to your dad. You need to be a little more sure of things.|`|XJlD2kPsaa	the only thing that i see doing is telling your mom or telling your dad to stop doing what he's doing. If he sees that you realize what's going on that would shock him and he would probably think, something like "oh ****, my son knows", and since your probably one of the best things thats ever happend to him he probably would stop, i doubt this woman that he's seeing he would love more than you or your mom. So, i suggest either confronting your dad or your mom, if you just sit back and wait its not going to do anything. And good luck
AA10065812	???<br>  I’ve been a Father’s Rights Advocate for 20 years.   <br>  <br>  You need to file a motion to modify your child support.  If you are current in you support, you can do this by making a request for a modification at the child support enforcement office.  If you are in arrears, and an enforcement action has been file, contact the Clerk of the Court and request forms for filing for a modification, Pro Se.<br>  <br>  You will need to get a copy of the child support guidelines and worksheet to determine if you have cause.  There needs to be at least a 20% difference in his payment.<br>  <br>  Never pay your child support directly to the mother as it can be considered a gift and not support.  Always pay threw the court.<br>  <br>  If you want to learn how to do all this go to Dads House in Yahoo Groups.  There's an educational manual in the file section that can teach you what you need to know.  Take the time to learn what you can and should do.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/DadsHouse/">http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/Dad...</a>|`|BJERgbM5aa	You cannot modify the support payments on your own.  You need the family court to set and approve a modification.  Tell the ex that you can't pay full amount because you lost your job.  She will rant and rave and curse.  But you just pay what you can.  And make it the same each time.  If she takes you to court, explain all to the adjudicator.  Your support payments will be reduced.  Hint:  When appearing in family court this time, don't shave for two days, don't wear a neatly pressed suit, and don't wear after shave lotion, etc.  You want to give the impression that things are not going so well.  Believe me, it works.  BUT, you must show some kind of ligimate proof that you are out of work.|`|IpWTMetHaa	Your financial status has changed, as such, the court will modify the existing child support, for which you are responsible.|`|v2a220YWaa	try contacting the family court in your area, a lot of times they will let you do the  paper work through them without hiring an attorney.<br>  but if she contests it you may have to hire an attorney.|`|BMEMH7JLaa	Yes <br>  <br>  Just go to the court and inform them of the facts.|`|PY160XO7aa	You would need to file papers at court house to modify payments<br>  <br>  Still cost money|`|ZsgCxVo5aa	If you have a court deduction order, contact CSE and they will be able to send you the papers to modify your support.  It may take a while, but the sooner the better. <br>  <br>  CSE is not only for the person that receives the money for support, you have rights, too!<br>  <br>  My son's father lost his job, and pays me support... I called and got the paperwork for him!  We may not be together, but he is still my son's father and needs SOMETHING for himself!
8XKmMBU7aa	OMG<br>  Please kill her, or say her she may kill you. It's only a drama not reality. These kind of Dramas always take success and I know very well she will be your friend again and her all problems will solve after praying to God. <br>  <br>  have a nice day and nice dream.|`|QMAqzpKEaa	I think that you are worried about her. Obviously you care about her a lot and still love her. Yes, forgive her.<br>  You simply being there will help her. She has been mixing with the wrong people like you said. You are genuine. She knows that or she would not have apologised in her own way.<br>  People will stop talking about her once they find something else to talk about. That's just the nature of people. They love gossip. That's why so many watch soap operas.Lol.<br>  However, play it safe. Stay away from the people she hangs around with. You do not want to be beaten up yourself. Be there for her ( as in give her someone to confide in) but stay safe yourself.|`|E2OKRhwYaa	Sounds like you still care about her and if you still want her friendship I see no reason for you not to befriend her again and help her get out of the trouble that she's in.|`|0pGHEctIaa	Everyone makes mistakes and I really think you should forgive her and help her. She knows that she was a jerk and needs your help. If you were in her position wouldn't you want her to help you?|`|4c53bf469dfe96ac19d353f625f2d1daaa	Forgive her we all make mistakes she is human. Just don't let her repeat the behavior. If she's not sincere walk away. If she is stand by her it will go away.|`|kMyERo6uaa	yes, you should.<br>  You need to help her, and build her reputation back up.<br>  Can imagine how much help she needs?<br>  Help her, she'll thank you.|`|BRPowUidaa	Okay. ONE: forgive her so long as she is serious about dropping the bad people, the bad habits, and the drama. Its unfair to her if you don't forgive her. We all make mistakes, it's human. and if you'd done what she did, and the whole situation was turned back on you, and you knew you'd messed up and you were crying and wanted her to forgive you...it would be a different story. How would you feel if she refused to give you a second chance, when the two of you use to be like sisters??? i think in the long run that should make sense, to put yourself in someone else's shoes.<br>  Like I said we all mess up. She wanted to see what it was like on the otherside of the grass, and all she found was weeds.<br>  Now she knows that the grass really isn't greener on the otherside.<br>  So give her a second chance. but remember.<br>  Fool me once shame on you. Fool me twice shame on me.<br>  <br>  and ps. it's spelt "said" im sure you know this. but it's annoying when you're trying to read and they spell it sed...looks like you're misspelling seed.
TyD2W3Jmaa	You can do a lot better than him. He sounds like a jerk, and if you have to worry about whether or not he's being loyal to you, you shouldn't be dating him. It's a lot of stress on your part for a guy who's not worth it. Don't get back together with him. You'll find someone who respects you and treats you really good, and that's the person that's worth your time and energy. This guy sounds like he's just trying to "get some." My advice, get rid of him completely. He's not good for your health, your nerves, or your heart. Hope this helps!|`|f33f8a001557d93f646acf7b8ce3061eaa	No. He's mean. He isn't worth it. He's lyin. If he knew you weren't really like that he wouldn't keep doin that kinda sh*t. He doesn't care about you like he's sayin. He's lyin to you. If somebody can't accept "no" for an answer the don't love you. And they probably don't care about you that much either.|`|kLmL1Fqeaa	In my opinion, u shouldn't get back with ur ex bf. Why? because he doesn't respect you. He will hurt u someday, if u guys together again. He said he love you, if he really love you, he will respect you. However, u said u can't go on without a boyfriend. Then go find the better one. Don't u want to find someone who love u with his true heart? u guys broke once, it can be second time too. I believe u don't want to get hurt again too right? Anyway good luck
06365417bacaf40acde3b233d10037a6aa	first of all it's never a good idea to sneak out at night (gets u in a lot of trouble). Tell him u met someone special.  If he doesn't care than he doesn't like u.  (meaning he wants to still kiss u).  If he cares than he will get mad.  That's when u know.|`|NSmGarMNaa	just wait for him to come to u! u dont wanna get hurt if he is just using u for fun so just wait for him to come to u good luck! ;)

70439f4f789775f1e09ca28cf190cc31aa	At one time, I could never imagine a teacher being anything other than committed to their students. But I sadly learned that a lot of them are all too human. In my experience, the counselors and teachers are more interested in shuffling your problems off to the side and getting home in time than dealing with controversial issues. The one time I had a teacher get involved in my home life, it turned into a nightmare and I wish she had just kept her mouth quiet. Personally, I'll never share anything with a teacher again. But I'm sorry you're going through this hard time.|`|J7mSnQPpaa	What did you tell them?You were homocidal/ you liked playing with dead animals?

Teachers don't hate their students or they wouldn't be teachers.<br>  If you want more attention from them, offer to help them in some capacity. That will also improve your grades.<br>  Lastlly talk to your parents about these feelings you have. <br>  Good Luck|`|yfVtTgt0aa	Well it all depends on what you told him.  If this was just general information then he shouldn't be treating you this way.  Now if you discussed something along the lines of feelings toward him then that may be the reason for the sudden change.  Not really sure though.  Would it be suitable to reveal the topic on which you talked to him about?  It could help out others who would like to give advice.
GcsZxffNaa	The best place to find out what to talk about is from the person you want to talk to.. Him.<br>  <br>  Ask him what other things he is into? Where does he do them? What equipment does he use? Best / worst experience? What other things does he want to try? <br>  <br>  There are a million questions.. but the most important one is, why isn't he asking you these questions?<br>  <br>  You are chasing this guy, and maybe if you didn't come across as so eager he may actually try to chase you a bit. It is also possible that he just isn't as interested in you as you are in him and that may be the heart of the matter..<br>  <br>  Good Luck!

Isnt it interesting that the earth is claimed to have been created in ages with some of it so many million years old-some so many more or less-thus instead of a creator that created the earth with age it had a creator that created out of nothing (because its got age and didnt exist a day before it was created-some say from gas lol-how much gas would it take to make 100 miles of earth all at one exact time? <br>  yet why did they find these dinasaurs on the earths surface. why didnt they have to dig down 100 thousand or a million when it is claimed they roamed the earth and up to a billion years into the earths crust to find these bones? they are preserved in tar pits of recent age-yet covered with great pressure to preserve them (the universal flood)<br>  this helped me as raised a Jew to see the deaper truths too=Christian means a follower of the Messiah-who came as a Jew- the believer in Jesus-has power over the mind to control their thoughts, thus when Jesus says to forgive and let Me handle it, or about lust is adultry against God, or hate is murder in the heart, we have the calling to cast down all imaginations that exault themselves against God which brings true peace and joy to our heart in all situations (Philippians 4:4-20). <br>  My Jewish people believe in the comming of a Messiah, and his fulfillment is in Jesus. The laws of Judaism were given specifically to the Jewish people to be kept and to guide them to the promised Messiah.<br>  Isaiah 9:6 the child to be the Son given, the mighty God and the prince of peace..<br>  Isaiah 52:13-53:12 To be the exalted one. To first be marred more than any man, and to lay down his life to make atonement for our sins.<br>  <br>  The way I came to know him is by believing what he spoke to us from heaven (Revelation1:1 chapter 1 verse 1 & 3:19&20 "I love you and ask you to repent of your sins (even one lie) quickly. Behold I stand at your heart door and knock If you hear my word and open the door, I will come in and be your friend."<br>  so I prayed "Jesus I am sorry for my sins, come into my heart and help me, be my friend, amen."<br>  Its all good and now as a Jew who has come to know Jesus is my Messiah, savior, and best friend giving me joy beyond words and power to live right.<br>  <br>  praying for you and this decision and the results too, David|`|NgJKNe7naa	You should just let him go he ios not worth your time you desvre better then him

Comunque tu prova ad invitarla a mangiare una pizza insieme, o un gelato, poi vedi la sua reazione. Se lei accetta l' invito non devi subito a dirle che ti piace, prova a proporre un altra uscita, così ti sentirai più sicuro di te stesso. Se lei ti dice di no, allora non le piaci più, ma potrebbe anche succedere il contrario, nella vita non bisogna mai perdere la speranza.

lt4NKGEzaa	When I was living at my apartment a few years back I came out of the bathroom that faces the living room and my roomates had invited friends over to party so i was already embarassed because i just had a towel on and someone offered me a drink then my towel got snatched so i was there butt naked but I decided to stay and mingle since no one was really making a deal out of it. i was red in the face for a while though and eventually put some pants on|`|K1l3GJyIaa	My most embarrassing moment was at my schools 7th grade field day. One of my friends volunteered me to participate in the dizzy bat race, which is when you put your head on one end of the bat put the bat on the ground and spin around ten times without stopping then you have to run back across the football field and tag your teammates hand then they go (you also have the hole 7th grade which is about 350 kids watching you while you run so keep that in mind). I was the 3rd person to go on my team and nobody had fallen yet. After I spun around the bat I ran back and I started going sideways (and I could tell). So when I tried to stop so I could see straight again I just fell over flat on my back. I started laughing and tried to start running again. Oh, buy the way the teacher in charge of my team was also my school soccer coach. Everyone on my team was laughing at me but that is OK because I knew all of them pretty well too.|`|QDGNjWPRaa	Back in middle school I would play basketball during every single recess break and I also use to be in our cross country team. My friends called me "air jenny" lol..i know weird, but anyways I would run all over that court, until one day someone threw the ball wayyyyy off it... And of course "track jenny" goes sprinting over there, but little did I know it was in a HUGEEE mud crap and I slipped in it! =[ <br>  I was in a private school and had a skirt and blouse as a uniform. My legs had so much mud on it!! My friends laughed hysterically. After their laugh attack they decided to help me clean up myself in the bathroom.<br>  <br>  lol...|`|zWDVGzHIaa	When I told this girl I didn't have aids, when infact I did have aids, and now she has aids.|`|26f2774461e7e185c52a4a91ebddb22faa	being dump by a girl in front of many people!!!..
31ac7af70f781384d9825a87cc62d0f2aa	LOL..it does really depend on what the situation is. if its a one night stand, her place u can just walk out kicking a women out might be more difficult-LOL<br>  <br>  if its a women u in a relationship with or dating, ur place it lets her know u not conservative u don't mind and u have home point advantage. . .<br>  <br>  but ask her believe me most women has their answer for u|`|0juC5QzOaa	if you guys are going to do it....go to hers....make her feel more comfortable.|`|UW1l49rKaa	doesnt matter, as long as you both feel comfortable.
0SGF1d59aa	Just be yourself when it comes to dressing!  <br>  <br>  It sounds from your limited information that he definately is interested in you -- you gotta ask him if he wants to be friends or if he wants to date.  If you guys weren't friends before but just acquantainces it sounds like you have a good chance with him!<br>  <br>  GL!|`|1861ae3e7f28bd57daec850c02b70562aa	Well you can go through the millions of Q: or you could just talk to him about your likes and dislikes are, and what are his or just ask him out. Above all be yourself. Guys like that best.|`|298581f887be66cea008ac10dc1c84acaa	He likes you and every guy has their own tastes of what they like in a woman.|`|FzlVkPYkaa	Sounds to me like he is quite interested in you as a girlfriend. You have a crush on him...sounds like a perfect setup.<br>  <br>  As for clothes, dress properly for the occasion, but whatever you do be well groomed, and clean. Clothes should always be clean and fresh as well. Good luck, go for it!!|`|S2mwCnHLaa	he definitely likes you to be his friend, anyways in terms of dressing you shouldnt be over dressed or too conservative just be natural you dont have to impress someone to make them fall for you..|`|ad3c419b222f6dc94d74261064692404aa	He likes you most likely.<br>  <br>  There are various ways to tell if someone likes you<br>  <br>  1. In a 1 to 1 conversation they will try and avoid eye contact<br>  2. They stare at you but when you look at them they pretend they werent<br>  3. They are either abnormally nice to you or abnormally mean to you (Not physically)<br>  4. They idle while speaking to you<br>  5. they often repeat themselves while speaking to you<br>  6. their pupils dilate while speaking to you<br>  <br>  Using those notes you should be able to work out if he likes you or not|`|3b81a1a3140f87bd9533bd6629fbd23baa	There is only one way to find out, ask him. The worst thing he can say to you is no. I think that he might like you doing all those flirtatious things. For your second question, it is different for each guy. Just be yourself. Becasue if you pretend to be someone that you aren't, you will get hurt. Good Luck! :)|`|4BS22pzyaa	He likes you. Be confident not cocky. Confidence is key. Dont put him on a pedestal. You are the woman we are supposed to look up to you. Dont dress slutty thats only eye candy. Create mystery. If you give away the ending why would he bother reading?|`|7JGOIti9aa	Lets see it to me is odvious that he is crushing on you.  I know it will probably be hard but the only way to really truly find out is tell him that you like him.  Then you can go from there.  Guys like that kind of stuff.  A girl who is straight forward and says what she wants and like.|`|AA12296203	I can always tell when a guy likes me or one of my friends. He will ALWAYS act differently around you, and he will flirt with you any chance that he can get. He will also try to get close to you, as much as he can, for example, sitting next to you, touching your arm, etc., etc. <br>  He likes you, big time.|`|EahpLroGaa	Be yourself and kiss him, those are my answers.  You'll know if he likes you or not then.  Don't try to change your appearance for anyone - that's a hard habit to stop later in life.|`|HjbBAEtqaa	i think he likes you a lot  but don't you dare think about changing the way you look or nothing because if he like you he should like you for you|`|htA46FXraa	Wow, what a subject you've gotten into.  speaking strictly as a guy, i would say there is some interest especially if he is doing small things for you.  he may be shy enough to not be making a major move, but anytime i've ever been interested in someone, i always start with small gestures and chit chat.  <br>  <br>  as to what we like in women and how you dress???  ha!  good luck with that one.  that varies.  most guys appreciate staring at a girl wearing low-riding jeans, and showing off their navel, but after we've got you we almost turn the opposite cause we know what all the other guys are staring at.  that's one you'll just have to probe him about and find out.  <br>  <br>  if he's shy and you want to take this a step further, suggest you meet somewhere, or go to a movie.  something simple and easy and non-threatening, and just see what happens.<br>  <br>  best of luck.|`|o5yNWaMPaa	sounds like he likes you or maybe he justs has friends that are girls, i would go for it and ask him out some time|`|qglwCxjSaa	u will not need to ask anyone else if the guy really likes u...coz all this feeling is divine...u will come to know yourself|`|qh7J8g1Haa	most guys just like the you know what but maybe he likes you for who you are and your personality?
HhiAeEJxaa	he's puttin in time to come around you. thats a good sign. and he brings you things which means he's thinking of you and what you like. <br>  <br>  I think he may have a thing for you but he's testing the waters.|`|QYtQhUtFaa	you could just tell
083Yp8Slaa	Unless the guy is really shy he probably would have asked you out if he was interested in you.  Either way asking him is really the only way to figure this out.  You seem to be wasting a lot of your life over interpreting things.|`|xO2oXQzpaa	yes!|`|AA10649406	he really likes you, so ask him out...|`|7mHhsBxraa	It sounds to me that he really does like you a lot. You should go up to him and ask him out.|`|e64c9cb63e6a1641ea4d5e13e877a888aa	He dosn't like you... HE LOVES YOU!!!! j/k its either that or he LIKEs you a lot!!!! So Ya!
6u7RLAuVaa	You sometimes the best person to ask is the person you are questioning.People can only speculate on what is going on or what is more likely ,they do not know whats going on in his head .If you really want to know something ask the source.even though it might be hard or you are shy.Better to hear it from the horses mouth then through here say or what other think.<br>     Only he knows what he's thinking.|`|AA12296157	I was going to read all that stuff but I don't think it's necessary.  If a guy is being nice to you that means he likes you.  If he's not, he doesn't.  Now, what more do you need to know about THIS guy?|`|y5WzW54Naa	I would have to say he is really really into you.
TO6KRN9zaa	I would ask him if he wants to see a movie, just the two of you. Then see what he says!|`|1HetqUKHaa	wow what a long story i think you just need to call him ask him if he wants to catch a movie or go for something to eat make it casual and then suggest a walk afterwards just the two of you after walking for a bit just grab his hand and see what he does if he pulls you closer then he really likes you and if he pulls away then just brush it off as a joke good luck
LBcHM3K1aa	Notice and compare you said, Boyfriend - SWEET then Other guy NICE.  Remember men are all nice, putting their best foot forward WHEN.... they still don't have you.  Sweet is so much deeper than nice.  You're just infatuated with somebody new, it will die off in time, don't worry.  It's perfectly natural to get infatuated with another guy while you have a boyfriend, you're only human.  Now it's your call if you'd want to gamble and want to try out the other guy to see if he'll turn out better.  Pray for guidance... God bless you...|`|82644bccb70a7c26bc7e26b7794db8f2aa	Stick with your boyfriend and forget the other one.
EQGYb0QZaa	That guy is wasting your time.Most of the guys take it as fun or a good time pass.Don't take him seriously and cutoff your way from him before he ditch you seriously.May be he might be using wrong name or address.Be careful in future before indulging in such matters.Good luck|`|Nc3gYThHaa	He is a piece of **** <br>  Common u know ure better then that, u don't need to wait and/or crave for this useless guy's attention !!!<br>  <br>  <br>  ?*? Beware 0f The Gypsy Curse ?*?|`|PDLZivS4aa	he is surely ignoring you........|`|CMCClkptaa	may be he just wanted to have some privacy. But one thing 4 sure, he is trying to neglect u. arent u the girl who asked "u love some1 when they hate u and u hate them when they love u?"|`|E8XH5TrZaa	he is cheating you.....|`|uLAGtNziaa	yes probably he is not taking u seriously, there r some guys who just like to have as many girlfriends, ....may be he is just flirting with u..... u better delete him frm yr memory..|`|tVpDOQpPaa	See u need to understand one thing, he may like you r not ,tat s a different issue but i guess every time he is online u cant expect him to chat only with u right, he has his own friends and u need to respect his privacy and u r telling u r still in school,so u still have loads of time to find ur prince, just concentrate on ur studies now.Good Luck
HArqQa8Maa	Are you kidding? <br>  <br>  Are you in your senses?<br>  <br>  He wont give you a penny.....He is just trying to come to USA and get set.....If he had 15000 USD he would have a great life in USA.....<br>  <br>  He looks like a cheap freak and you are acting so silly being a mother of 3 kids......<br>  <br>  you say that your kids will benefit from this.....no way....money will end one day....and its a sin moreover......you are not at all religious then...no religion allows this.......<br>  <br>  If he wanna come then let him come on his own by writing exams like GRE and GMAT....I came the same way why can't he come......<br>  <br>  The world is not so simple dear.....lot of crooks roaming....when you go there and feel helpless you will curse yourself coz if bad happens to you who will look after your kids.......work hard yourself for their better upbringing........|`|NeTNnvSZaa	You don't get something for nothing.  Are you prepared to pay the ultimate price for that money?|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	If he has $15000, tell him to come to you instead of you going to India.<br>  <br>  You cannot think for a second that marrying someone you've never met is a good idea. C'mon - you have a brain.  Use it.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	Anyone that wants you to get married in their country and is paying you money to be married, is not one I would want to marry.  If you are not familiar with the customs, then you really don't want to say yes.<br>  <br>  Marriage is serious - and you know next to nothing about this man.|`|bfc067ab537555ada57edd464a8dfb97aa	Turn him in to the FBI he has probably done this to a number of women, they have slavery in that country you and your children could all be in harm's way.|`|d8jH5lU1aa	does he know you have 3 kids?????<br>  <br>  If  I were you I would just take the money and then leave him=]|`|aDIPIu7xaa	$15,000 is not enough money to make me go ANYWHERE....thats NOTHING!|`|AA10743159	He wants to buy you, and Indian Culture is very different from ours.<br>  I'm not saying he will be like that, but many in India, consider, killing their wives, as a matter of honor, if they think she has done him wrong.<br>  A bit severe, if you ask me. <br>  If I were you, I would give this guy a wide berth.Look around, much closer to home, you will be much happier in the long run. And many fewer problems. Especially if you are just getting married, so he may get a Green Card. That is a Federal Offense. <br>  So be smart, and tell him, No thanks!|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	Don't do it. Indian marriages are more like slavery. Stay where you are, and forget him. He may even have a wife already, I believe they are allowed more than one.<br>  <br>  EDIT- what he wants to do is illegal. If you don't want to get thrown in jail, forget this stupid scheme. What good will it be for your kids when you are in prison for fraud?|`|etMuDCQVaa	you met him over myspace you know nothing about him (could be fake accounts). he probably wont give u 15k there have been so many cases where they say it just to lure u there. i wouldnt go its unsafe and if something were to happen to you what about ure children?|`|oojO4WAraa	No.  You should not.  Money isn't everything.  India is an awful country.|`|YFTZM86maa	ummm..no!|`|m4T0IT0yaa	What should you do?  Get your head examined.  Are you insane?|`|eS9nPWqBaa	I take it that your profile was deleted for Trolling and this is your comeback?|`|d8014a4c8a0d00a6352feb566ba41503aa	HELL NO! stay in the states....PLEASE!|`|oYf3jSq6aa	So many uneducated people making so many immature ignorant comments<br>  <br>  India is not Muslim or Arab or Somalia<br>  Their wives are not slaves <br>  I have known any many Indian families and the wives have always been treated with much more respect than we treat our wives<br>  <br>  He can't just come here because immigration law requires a face to face meeting in their country<br>  There is nothing illegal about the arrangement, just uncustomary<br>  <br>  The 15,000 could easily be considered a dowry still expected in many cultures<br>  <br>  After a year of writing I met my wife face to face for the first time (pre chat room era for me) about a minute before we got married<br>  We have been married now for 14 years<br>  <br>  I know many Indian women living in America who were married the same way in an arranged marriage to an Indian man<br>  <br>  The bigoted immature attitudes displayed here explain why more and more people are looking outside our self righteous willfully ignorant society for mates|`|d3eab5726a0f9f49c756fdcdee1a6bc5aa	No, otherwise you will regret later. India is a hot, dirtiest , most crowded country & having no law & order at all. Foreigners are often looted, robbed, raped & killed & nothing happens. Murder is a common thing. People are culturally most backward. Drinking clean water is difficult to get. Cheating in matrimonial matters are maximum. Indian courts are junks of criminal mafias.|`|jYSPZzXFaa	Well im Indian, and i definitely think you should NOT marry him, without meeting him and getting to know him.<br>  Do you even know the guy?<br>  Have you ever seen him?<br>  Have you ever been to India?<br>  Do you really think he has the money, it could all just be a lie?<br>  Do you really want to be without your children?<br>  <br>  You dont know what you're doing!<br>  :D (Hope you make the right choice though)|`|GHlYbDfJaa	NO! My cousin married a man who was here going to college but planned to stay after he graduated. After graduation he went home to "visit" his family...that was 4 years ago and she still hasn't heard from him. She went through HELL for that divorce!!!|`|Xg3iry5qaa	if your serious....defiently not.  If he wants to come over here then great...we will talk about it then.  <br>  <br>  I know times are tough but the Good Lord will pull you threw.  Keep faith and dont make any rash decisions|`|Wy3wddFlaa	do you love him??|`|y2nC8BUGaa	If you really thing marrying for money will make you happy then go ahead but usually money doesn't make a happy marriage.|`|vPD4s1pMaa	pray!!<br>  i personally think you shouldn't tho|`|fA42bQHraa	No, do not go to India and marry a man you've never met in exchange for 15,000 dollars.<br>  <br>  On the bad idea scale of 1-10, 10 being a REALLY bad idea, it is a 10.<br>  <br>  Response to your additional details:<br>  <br>  HE SAYS: He is a student in Industrial graphics <br>  <br>  HE SAYS: he wants to come to the usa so he can go to a better college.<br>  <br>  HE SEEMS LIKE: Hes a real nice guy <br>  <br>  You don't have a clue about him, you only know what he's telling you.|`|scnW0Wzeaa	He will make you his slave. If you piss him off He will cut your head off.|`|syWxjxu8aa	are u freaking insane????????????????????? <br>  get married to somebody that u never met?????<br>  u are crazy|`|d2FJBJ8baa	yea are you crazy? why the hell would you marry some dude from india that you have never met|`|PY160XO7aa	NO!!!|`|iqku0QOQaa	are you actually kidding me?|`|wz3S190haa	i think you should marry a therapist!|`|AA11695632	He is just one interest and that is he wants to come to US.. Marriages have legal implications. You have to think about that..<br>  <br>  If its just a business deal kind of marriage do everything to protect as you have not seen the real man..If you come to India visit US consulate keep a letter with copy of photo ID, contact details of your man with phone numbers, Passport no and every possible Identity of the man. You can not come blindly. You must act to know about his all truthfulness and everything he says and does.|`|pYomxgYfaa	Well first of all, think about your children.<br>  <br>  They would have to learn a new language, which would delay their school years. They would have to re-adjust not only to a new language, but a new society with new social rules and standards. It will be a very big transition for them. The health care is different, the schooling systems are different, the environment itself is different. I'm not saying it's worse, just very different and it will be very hard to adjust.<br>  <br>  Don't do it just for the money. After all, you never know who this guy really is. Maybe he is buying you into marriage? Maybe he's doing it to make your kids work to raise his family wealth? <br>  <br>  If you are really inlove with this guy, get him to come to you first. See how he is with the kids and how he is with you.|`|IybV1Enwaa	With the information(even with additional details)  you have provided the answer is No. However I want to clarify few things to you and everyone. <br>  <br>  1. <br>  India is a great country.Every country has good and bad people and India is no exception. <br>  <br>  $15000 is a very small amount for a lady who is mom of three children and lives in United States if it is coming after a travel to India. <br>  <br>  No matter how serious is the person on the other hand , he may not be eligible to come to US. There are immigration formalities to be full filled so chances are there he is serious but just can not come. US Embassy does not provide Visa so easily.<br>  I was framing the response and in the meantime you have provided additional detail that he is a student. So what I have guessed it right.  <br>  <br>  <br>  If a person truly loves you,why bother taking money for kids. He should be willing to take complete responsibility of your children. <br>  <br>  At last, unfortunately I know some cases on Indian men marrying American (Parents-Indian only) girls for citizenship and green card etc. So I have to admit that it is very scary.|`|9ZnldF5Caa	I can understand your situation but because being a mother kids are our real world of happiness and we are ready to die for them. I am also like that so please don't trust anyone let him come to you and stay with you. Please enquire about this man before any final decision. As i have been cheated like you byr the sweet words but after marriage things are totally different from what he said. Now i am away from kids and living a life where i have no peace and happiness and more over, no care, love or support and want to die and this my second marriage. I am also not having money, but i was happy with myt kids before now , my people , language ,my native place, my friend and family i have left for this man and he is not thankful after all for this man who is having 2 kids and i am giving love and care as a mother but away from my kid. so think before doing any decision. Investigate and see his situation coming here in india , whether he is really an unmarried man or not . Rest is ur choice as i have a do or die situation you should not have. May god bless you and your kids, have  a beautiful life.|`|DL3DSG42aa	Are you joking? Why in the world would you do that. No you should not. No, no, no. You obviously know nothing about his home country, and unless you're really willing to immerse yourself in their culture and learn their language, you're going to feel completely isolated and you'll probably experience a real culture shock. There are millions upon millions of men you've never met that can offer you the same if not more in THIS country. You should think of your children, they are much more benefitted in this country than they would be over in India or whatever. I can't believe you would consider such a crazy idea! If anything HE should come to YOU- you're the one with three kids!!!!!!!|`|kv5lGrSdaa	Get out while you can. That guy sounds super shady. He'll probably take you to his country and then and I don't even want to go on. Have you ever seen the movie taken? OMG I know its different from your situation but when you go to another country you never know what could happen. I guess only you know if you truly love him. If he really loves you he'd marry you here in the states. With the money he said he'd give you he could use it to fly his relatives out here for the wedding if that's the issue. Be careful and good luck!|`|tnfJ5kMkaa	.. one could have a very luxurious life with that amount of money in India... and not forgetting he will have 3 'instant' kids to content with..no offense meant,..why don't you propose that with the money he had,..fly over and spend a couple of weeks as your guest...in this way,..both of you,..including your children could get to know, ..bond,.. and understand each other...this could be a good start to manage 'expectations'..|`|c9a90527808df5335d19bb2bb26c039eaa	hi, i m an Indian and i tell u, any guy who has that much time to be on myspace and lives in India and can offer u 15k us dollars is a fake, coz in India, ppl who earn that much dont bother to go on these social networking sites, majority are the younger generation, or precisely just the younger generation. And nobody is like that who offers u money i lieu of marriage<br>  so i advice u to just stay away... please take care of urself and ur kids, there can be numerous other ways to get money, just dont look at the short term benefits, look at the future u and ur kids will have if u take this step.... get into a job or something.... that would be better, or just find a man there, where u live....<br>  Good Luck for ur life.... :)|`|rDb9ZLyfaa	OMG NO way!!  Don't you take your kids to India.  You tell him to come here but don't do it!  Have you ever been there?  Culture shock is a understatement especially for Americans.

Do you know how high the statistics for  the Aids/HIV virus is there?  really high!!!!You would need him to be tested before you did anything~!|`|psWxRqSfaa	im guessing you could be divorced.<br>  BUT I WILL SAY<br>  NO <br>  i think you might be in it for the money.<br>  your kids are your life right?<br>  but dont do it <br>  dont be so stupid.<br>  ive read books on peoples experiences and some of them dont let you back to your country your kids would be in indangerd<br>  and so would you.<br>  DELETE HIM. the money you could make.|`|OUaWGz1Uaa	Don't listen to that chick dear!<br>  you are such a great mother that is thinking for her children<br>  but make sure that the guy is not just taking advantage of you!<br>  because many cases have been occured in the past like this!<br>  do not visit alone<br>  be with your friend or some one who you trust!|`|IhZeoXqvaa	Well, don't marry him for money.

I mean you didnt really specify if you guys are in love or not and kind of left out details but sounds kinda fishy.|`|7LWDRI2Uaa	Well I suggest meeting him first if you haven't already, Maybe see if you two are compatible living together, how about finding out how your kids will take to living in India because it will be a culture shock that's for sure.|`|3o7ULYoLaa	Have you ever met this guy?<br>  <br>  Think about the risk you are putting your children in.<br>  Marriage is more than just money.<br>  What if you get there and he has zero money to give you?!<br>  Then you are stuck.|`|oiMeqGQFaa	you shouldnt. no matter how much money it is. and you know a man through myspace but do you really know how he is in person??|`|zndg56eVaa	?????

But are you asking us about the wedding ceremony. You'll need to know India is a vast land and its people are so different in every sense. Please mention the region the guy belongs to, his caste, something. Well in most of the religions with an Indian origin marriage is no less than a festival. So felicitations and welcome to India.|`|69kaz1luaa	NOOOOOOO!   <br>  Do not go to India and marry this man.  This has nothing to do with him being Indian or India its self.  OK?<br>  In fact India is a wonderfull country.  Since I am married to an Indian man, whom I met In the USA and he is not illegal, I go to India a lot.  It is always with someone, never alone. <br>  <br>  This man Wants a free ticket to the USA in the most awfull way possible.  I have no dout that this is what he is doing.   My husband says.... do not, under any circumstances, go to India and meet this man.   Going for a trip or a Vacation is a different stroy..  <br>  <br>  Who knows what is on his mind or who this person is in reality...<br>  <br>  Please.. do be carefull.   And do not look at the value of  $$$ he says he will give you...  Forget it..    If you know what he does in India  think... how can he make such $  in India to be giving it away to a American Lady?     Indian men most of the time don't even value women from the US....    They treat women in India  a lot different ... a whole lot different.     Just do Not Go!|`|OItRuV7Gaa	wow too many answrs for one question.well let me tell u this, u dont have a clue about India or Indian merriages nither these morons who answerd ur question and call India a awefull country!! hight of stupidity..<br>  <br>  Now to your question- I dont really think that this a good idea to believe some one like this, be it a indian or american, u cant merry some1 like this or would u? if he has money then ask him to use it in better way cus if u take it and ur not use to such type of money then u'll feel guilty abut it for rest of ur life....<br>  <br>  <br>  Here is what i have for PJ (she posted her comments here) - i just heard once that Half of the Americans are dumb and other half are deaf, why do you want to prove this right?|`|5OsHrulJaa	i guess the second question is do you like Milk? they will force you to drink milk and cheeses also are you ok with  the mom being on top of you all the time and tell you how to do things ?

t7jiSmjVaa	By all means get her help. Tell her you are taking her shopping then take her to the doctor. Have the doc talk to her. Have him refer her to a shrink if needed. Then make sure she goes. Worst case scenario. Someone in town sees your son and freaks out thinking you "stole" your son from her after she "assumed" he was dead. Get what I'm saying. She is sick. Get her help.|`|S6BYJ4Jfaa	There is something really wrong here and she may need to talk to a doctor.
RMgyEgJsaa	As a therapist of 14 years this issue does appear from time to time. Unfortunately yes, you can have feelings of resentment or jealousy towards a person's family if you are feeling angry or left out when they are having fun. Even having to ask this question, the wording in your question shows that you do indeed have a problem with this. My advice would be to do some reading on coming to terms with a death in the family, and if you arent a reader, try talking with a close friend or even your boyfriend about your feelings. If he loves you, then he will understand. Dont hold back, be honest - But this is where Therapists or friends can help, because with a boyfriend we dont always feel like we can share everything, or say everything safely the way we want to.<br>  A death is never easy to handle, but this could ruin your very future if you let it bubble up inside you..

54ro47TIaa	I don't know if jealousy is the right word here...It sounds like you might be feeling inadequate - as if you aren't enough for her to vent to, now she needs strangers to talk to.<br>  I don't think you should take it personally, because everyone on Yahoo A has a best friend or lover they supposidly tell EVERYTHING to - but sometimes, you also want the opinion of someone who is completely objective and knows nothing about you. <br>  Maybe your friend already knows what advice you're going to give her, so she is seeking an outlet for information which is out of the ordinary. <br>  It's not always about jealousy, it's about feeling important and needed in a friendship.|`|UU1YR1Kaaa	It could be jealousy, but in any case I would let it go, and not worry about it.

If you feel that you have to ask the question that's already a good sign but you know the answer yourself. What I can tell you though is that both of your friends love you equally and you should over-analyze things. Enjoy every moment of your friendship and if it doesn't work out, oh well... c'est la vie; I'm sure you'll be okay. Sometimes people come and sometimes they leave. And the fact that we just deal with it and move on makes us even stronger and eager for new experiences in life. Good luck!|`|b4dKGDzPaa	maybe your friend just thinks its easier to get opinions from people who are not bias? but any ways i do think you are a jealous person, not like crazy jealous or anything but everyone gets thoughts and feelings like that sometimes, i wouldn't worry about it unless it starts really messing with your life.|`|yMD13bMTaa	No your not! she just would rather ask strangers on yahoo because they don't know her at all and she just needs other advice different from yours.|`|f0173000dda40d230a0442e8832073d1aa	You're friends...not siamese twins.<br>  <br>  Even bestest friends have some level of privacy.<br>  <br>  Respect her right to have a life beyond you and do the same.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|QNZM0ONdaa	nope not at all :)

Get your point across to her and she might think about it, and remember if it ever gets out of hand and you cant do anything call the police|`|15jfF0tKaa	Well honey, you have entered the zone of understanding mom and dad are not perfect. That is a right of passage and along with that is the knowledge that yea they do try most of the time to see that I have my needs met, (own room, good food, supplies, stuff) so that means that as you mature you want to be fair about who they are. Have you ever sat down and said how is your day? Or just engaged them in a conversation about their relationship with their parents or what it was like for them to have been a teen? You might get a grip on where they are comming from. I myself was raised by an alcoholic dad and there was abuse and yelling. I feel that somehow I have anger issues from that and my kids picked up on residual stuff from that.  So on your way to adulthood just remember to have compassion for people who love you but have their own foibles. I had a very achieving daughter also and it was easy to forget her because the other two kids were such a wild hand full. I secretly delighted in her achievements and am oh so proud. Remember to give mom a hug she may need. And I am personally very proud of you, you sound very smart and sensitive to your family!

Any mother who would insult her daughter's weight, ridicule her and in turn, cause undue stress and insecurities for her is an unfit mother.  Don't doubt for a moment that she loves you, however, it sounds like she is ill-equipped to show you in a loving and supportive manner right now.<br>  <br>  Don't start questioning your weight, her emotional abuse could lead to your having a eating disorder if you actually thought her words have validity.  They don't.  Your doctor knows what is a healthy, ideal weight for "you".  Your mother's reaction sounds misguided, almost envious, which is abnormal for a mother towards a daughter.  <br>  <br>  It sounds like she is abusive and then has regret, so she does have remorse, however, she needs to realize the pain she is causing you.  Maybe one day when she is in a positive mood, you could ask her to go on a mother/daughter outing and talk to her about your feelings.  Maybe it will open your eyes to her perspective and maybe she will see what she is doing to you.<br>  <br>  You need to talk to extended family or a close family friend that you trust about her hitting you.  That is unacceptable and depicts a person who is loosing control of her emotions.<br>  <br>  Make sure you find the inner strength to soldier on in your life regardless of others disappointing you and always look for support and love from family, friends and the community.|`|PxcEAoBMaa	i think that your mom is jealous of you. you are less overweight than she is, and she doesn't want you to become like her.<br>  <br>  She prob. has high hopes for you and so is pushing you harder.

IxzJ6SN5aa	Your feelings are natural. The timing is suspicious. Dont' feell guilty about venting to your best friend. <br>  <br>  Telling other people? Maybe... But its not gossip if that's what you honestly thought. <br>  <br>  As far as ruining his rep? You can just say this is what you honestly thought. <br>  <br>  I would forgive yourself and not waste more energy on it.|`|8PvqsOt8aa	You have nothing to feel bad about, he did the act, then dumped you, so why should he be upset that people know, no lies were told, so you did nothing wrong. On the second note, I think that you deserve better, so move on and find a guy that wants to be in your embrace every night, and the only thing he can think of is how you feel next to him while he stares into your eyes... ok enough of that.|`|sgRDJUXqaa	Stop talking about it.  Spreading rumors is always bad.  What happens in your personal life is YOUR business and no one else's.  If your ex chooses to spread rumors, by keeping your mouth shut you can always dispute it, but by admitting it you've told everyone your business.|`|qsZPkbF2aa	I wouldn't be feeling guilty at all. Your ex-boyfriend started all of this, and you were just getting even. Nothing wrong with wanting to get even with somebody for mistreating you.|`|VXiMtwIsaa	UHH...NO. He slept w/ you and then walks out the picture something aint right.|`|KlRsBt5waa	Actually, what your ex did to you was wrong. Simply put, he used you. Whether he went back to his ex or not, doesn't matter because he violated a trust that you had given him and built over time. Is it wrong to gossip? yes it is because you can't take your words back. I understand that you were doing it because you felt extremely hurt so forgive yourself and move on. Try to curb whatever anger you have towards him and express your feelings (using "I" statements) to close friends and family that you can trust. Right now, you need to feel safe and give yourself time to heal. <br>  <br>  Also, beware of the next time you get into a relationship. Having sex is very serious for a woman. You can't seperate emotions from the physical act. When you give your body to someone, you're essentially giving your heart as well. Be careful of the person you give either one to...especially your heart. That takes the longest to heal!|`|UU1YR1Kaaa	You cannot change the past,you can only learn from it. Sex is messy and I mean emotionally messy, once you give in all those emotions get stirred up, and you cannot take it back, you can only move on.  Think before you get involved again.

I hated dating in high school.<br>  <br>  So yeah, it sucks, and I'd feel bad, but it's not your fault.<br>  <br>  It sounds like you weren't doing it out of malice or anything.  You were simply confiding in others the situation as you see it.  If you have the chance to talk with him (that is if you're still on speaking terms with him.. or write him a note), tell him that that's all you were doing, and you weren't trying to spread anything.  If you don't get the chance, the guy sounds like an *** anyway so I'd suggest just staying clear.  Just clear your name to like his friends that might give a ****.  If that's what you want, anyway.<br>  <br>  Don't let yourself become pressured into anything you don't want to do.  For the sake of your own mental and physical health.|`|spHjE3Cmaa	Well what's done is done and the important thing is that you learn from your mistakes. It's understandable that you would want to talk to someone about what happened, but If you told your friend in complete confidence that she wouldn't pass it on, and she did, then you know know not to tell her anything again. But If he really cared for though he would've pressured you. In my opinion, yes you both were wrong for what each of you did but if you can let it go, accept what happened and move on that's what seems best for each of you.|`|s8d7gg5Haa	NO don't feel guilty he ain't worth it seriously hun your find someone so much better at the moment im heart broken as i was in love with my ex.. i acted like a ***** and now he hates me he ended it and got with someone a week later which hurt so much but i realized i just got to deal with it yeah i acted badly and bitchy when he first hurt me as i thought  that would help me get over him but it just made it worse.. <br>  what you have to do is not talk to him at all for a while then maybe ask how he is doing <br>  <br>  don't feel like ur the one in the wrong <br>  when he is <br>  keep your friends close and have fun.|`|ks2oieV0aa	I would feel worse about having sex with someone who dumped me a week later.  You should be feeling used, because you were!  But I don't think you can blame him for it, unless he raped you!  Neither of you are to blame, he got what he wanted and I think you did also.  He just isn't interested in a relationship with you at this time.  Let it go.  xox|`|AA11108018	What you di do was give it up.  Than you made matters worse by telling your g/ff that you did.

Did he tempt you to have sex, and you kept rejecting but finally gave in, or was he just going too fast?  WHich was it?    I think you just 'felt' pressured. I don't see anything wrong with dumping somebody if you feel it's not working out.  ANd the dates were definately a coincidence.  Let him live his life.  ANd you should apologize to him.  Nobody wants to be talked about like that.  Keep your sex life to yourself.  That's private and that deinitely can ruin a guy's reputation.  GROW UP
YzaBbEpXaa	You should indeed learn how to not be jealous. however, this may be a somewhat hard feat. Afterall, Jealousy is a powerful demon. The best way to get past it is to tell yourself all the things your girlfriend likes about you. Better yet, sit down with her and ask her how she truly feels about you. Talk about the two of you and apologise for being jealous. Tell her that it's hard to get past, but you're working on it. The hardest step to take is realizing that you are a jealous person. Now that you have done that, the rest should be a lot easier.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and I hope all goes well ^_^|`|t7ZUrUeLaa	It might have something to do with your parents, but this isn't about them. It's about you. Just be honest with your girlfriend about how you feel, and try to find a middle ground that keeps you both happy. If you can't do that, perhaps you should find someone else who won't make make you jealous all the time.<br>  <br>  Or maybe, just work on not being jealous. It takes a lot of work, but you can do it if you really try.|`|AxWWiyZaaa	im jealous about all things my friends and my boyfriend do too<br>  i admitted i may be jealous. <br>  <br>  im thinking to myself about jealously..<br>  Maybe when you start 2 feel jealous.. maybe, try and push it away concerntrate on something else, think of a valid reason for it ..<br>  its what im going to try to do..<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|sGP6s7uraa	You need to not be jealous.  When you're jealous you don't REALLY trust that person.  You're on the right track in finding the barrier that you need to overcome to find the underlying issues as to WHY you can't trust someone.  Search deeper.  In the meantime, you need to chill with her.  Just let it be.  I doubt she'll do anything to hurt you and if she does, it's water off a ducks back.  Let it burn.|`|4c53bf469dfe96ac19d353f625f2d1daaa	Jealousy is a very damaging trait for relationships. Change! it is so annoying to explain to a jealous person over and over again. If you Love some one set them free. If they love you they will return.|`|yBTTPsbNaa	Your jealousy of the men she is talking to you is a very natural feeling. You care for her and you feel the need to protect her and that she is yours. And you don't like that anothe rguy may be stepping your territory.<br>  However, if she is not doing anything with her friends that hurts you such as flirting i would give some room to breathe. She seems to let you be with your friends so you must let her be with her own. <br>  If you two are together at the time, join the conversation. It is possible that you both can share friends.|`|ezzSeBnLaa	No you shouldn't be jealous. If you keep questioning her about her friends and who she talks to, she's either gonna dump you or do the things your accusing her of. Obviously she's with you and not the other guys for a reason. I think you def need to stop or she will leave you.|`|NpzNHmCGaa	Both you and your girlfriend should be able to talk to whoever you want. You should only really be concerned if you know or are fairly certain theres something going on which shouldn't be. I think a little jealousy is normal. Just keep it in perspective.|`|9KklDAjDaa	i have been with my bf for 20months now, and as a girl, i still sometimes get jealous. its just part of the relationship sometimes. but if i think that i cant handle it, i talk to him for reassurance. u do the same. tell her how u r feeling. at the end of the day, if u trust her and love her, u shouldnt in any way get jealous of it TOO much! <br>  also, u have only been together for 3months. thats not alot. so in order to save the relationship and prevent it from falling the best thing to do is 'commuicate' about it with her.<br>  hope this helps =)
F5OOb5Cjaa	I'm kind of like your hubby in the sense that I can be reluctant to try new things because sometimes I feel embarassed about the situation.  Luckily I have a partner who is the opposite - more like you.  He is very explorative and adventerous.  I am proud to say I have the big O almost everytime we are together!  Why?  He kind of pushes me to be adventerous, not physically or violently, but because he is so comfortable and open.  If I were you, I would try to be open.  Talk about it.  Take charge and kind of guide him to do what you want him to do in the bedroom.  It sounds like he needs to relax a little bit.  May be start out with some romance and turn it into something fun and adventerous.  Try games, movies, or toys.  Surprise him with some new lingerie.  It sounds like you are going to have to make the first move, so get going :0)<br>  <br>  If these things don't work, sit him down and have a nonconfrontational discussion about how this will eventually ruin your relationship and marriage if you guys can't reach a middle ground.  If he loves you, he will at least try.  When, and if, you talk with him try to be constructive.  Don't blame him.  State how you view the situation and how it makes you feel.  Don't make this conversation only about what he needs to do.  At the end of your discussion, you should talk about what each of you needs to do.<br>  <br>  Best of Luck!  I hope you get some satisfaction!|`|4cd2c7649e1949de04b5f7bdd1c51814aa	Have you considered seeing a sex therapist?  It's a start, if you two truly want to make your marriage last.|`|43beac8a342b8a3bc49f2f3239032148aa	Be straight forward with him about what you like and don't like<br>  <br>  Don't get mad at him once he figures out the benefits of making sure you are happy he will gladly follow suit|`|IhvKZSyaaa	It is clear that both of you have different needs.In any happy=successfully relationships there are compromises to be made.If you really want to understand your spouse, a change of perspective from your side is necessary.Look at it this way:maybe he was brought up in a house where his parents showed their love through romantic gestures.You on the other hand might have been brought up in a home where physical lovemaking was very important.<br>  Talking ABOUT YOUR CHALLENGES  AND TRULY LISTENING TO EACH OTHER ARE THE FIRST STEPS YOU CAN TAKE TO REVIVE YOUR RELATIONSHIP.THE OPERATIVE WORDS ARE LISTENING AND COMPROMISE.GOOD LUCK.|`|dbe57cafb5222b125ae9a7e20a19ebf9aa	You like visual? Wow ! Men like it too!<br>  Sounds like you both have some inhibition issues. Sounds like you both need to compromise. <br>  Have you openly and honestly communicated w/ him in an environment where there is no blame? That may sound funny - but when coulpes have issues like yours and claim to be communicating, their idea of communication usually contains statements like " He/She Doesn't do xxx" and " I don't like to xyz". <br>  You can't really form a great foundation for communication starting with negative terms. <br>  Try agreeing to "do" one thing if he will do one thing for you. <br>  Be innovative and think outside of the box. Watch some porn. I know - sounds funny, but the big draw men have to porn is that they like to watch - sounds like you do as well. <br>  Try to mimic the scenes you're watching, role play like they do in the movies - it can't hurt - unless you don't bend that way!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|m52JPjPvaa	I would be put off by the 4 times a year thing.

85BbBAQXaa	I think you should ask yourself why you broke up with your boyfriend in the first place. Then, see if the problem still bothers you. Also, if you get back together with your boyfriend, you should make sure that he'll be a gentleman and not use you. <br>  <br>  I definitely think that you should get to know the other guy more. Flirt with him, chat with him, and test the waters to see if he likes you back. If so, go for it!<br>  <br>  Hope everything turns out great! Good luck :)
iKsQ1RCgaa	maybe not being with him is a good thing. It's obvious that he is not close to being a man cause a man would have told you face to face how he felt. You can't help how you feel about him but try not to let it show so keep your head up and if you cross paths with him as hard as it may be just say what's up and keep walking like it ain't no big thang ya feel me. You'll get over him in due time and when you are ready to move on make sure that whoever you choose to kick with is at the same place as you are spiritually and emotionally aight. So you stay positive and stay beautiful. Peace Out.|`|12c3d79a65d0cbdbcd1922a50d89d9f4aa	No worry. That's a man who didnt care you. He couldnt give what you wanted even you kept staying with him. Forget him I know it's not easy but try to focus yourself on having fun with your friends or those things you like very much, you will be fine soon. Trust me as you move on, you will find it was not worth loving him at all. You will be OK.|`|AA11372613	girl i feel u and what u goin thru,i had bf problems,and i was really hurt,but sometimes even if u dont want to u have to think about how he was going to have his friend tell u he didnt want to be wit u instead of him tellin u himself,but at least he was being honest and not leading u on acuz u would b more hurt than u r now..i hope u feel better...u can IM or email me n e time......<br>  <br>  your girl,ni ni...
vAhVEJKCaa	If she is not ready for that commitment, then she may pull back. However if I was you I would try to assure her that you are willing to wait until she is sure, but that you do not want her to drift away from you. Assure her that you want her for good, but that you are willing to work for it.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!!!|`|p7f5SEIwaa	Give her some space, don't rush into a relationship now but be her shoulder to cry on, make her feel happy around you then let the chips fall where they may.|`|Z4f3dbpxaa	Dude she needs a friend than a lover right now give her space I'm sure that she has your # to call you. Women are sensitive and the next time that you talk to her tell her that you will wait ever how long it takes. but assure her that you will be her friend in the end. Good luck.|`|CsTxG66Naa	Be a since of humor to her, but also sombody for her to cry on. You wanna show that you are compassionate towards her, but you wanna also show that you can be funny. Chicks love a guy witha since of humor, but don't push it. If their pissed back off a bit, and let them kool down. If you think that its appropriate at some times cry with her and relate to her, only if it really happened though, don't make some story up.|`|LI9tOlsuaa	give her time dont smother her,.,buy her a card with meaning,., a rose or even a teddy bear,.,how about a pic of use to together,.,srry hun but things r really hard to deal with sometimes and make sure it aint no lackin in da love compartment,.,she  might just need a friend and doesnt want to fool around kk hope ive helped good luck nd peace|`|eWkqhBqOaa	Take it slow, give her time to trust.

85BbBAQXaa	Well it depends on it if your gf is shy or not. If she's shy, I would recommend kissing her maybe outside where there's not that many ppl, in the corner of the room, or maybe when you take her home. <br>  <br>  If she's not a shy girl, you could also kiss when you are slow-dancing on the dance floor. You'd probably want to be in the middle or "inside the crowd" on the dance floor, because you probably don't want the teachers to be oogling at you. <br>  <br>  Just kiss when you're feeling comfortable. She'll definitely be giving you signs too! Another great time to kiss (especially at a dance since it's usually loud in there) is when you two are chatting or something, you can whisper in her ear. This brings your faces close to each other, then you can look her in the eye and kiss her.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps and good luck!

2ccfe02e101b7725ab0cf2149bb124e7aa	Laugh lightly and call them @ssholes, then move on to something else. When you have stopped giving them the horrified reaction that they are looking for, they will stop doing it. <br>  <br>  They want to be able to get a thrill out of your reaction, and like any other bully, if you stop giving them what they want, they move on to other things.<br>  <br>  But when they pick a new victim to embarrass, I thoroughly expect you to remember what it felt like to be the victim yourself, and tell them that it is not cool to be doing that!|`|3178983db581d87d44194b6e07b07381aa	I just swallow it to myself.|`|PVJQPL1maa	it really depends what they do to embarass you. <br>  <br>  if it is really making you uncomfortable tell them to stop it and explain their behaviour is really getting to you. if its not something really serious though just laugh it off. then speak to them about it later and ask why they did it. <br>  <br>  are they really you're "friends" if they keep embarassing you? maybe you should leave them|`|0d344ef47aebe57c68d9aabce92d8ab2aa	...maybe be open with them and have a serious talk to let them know that they are doing it a bit too often than you'd like.....|`|7f8acd7f03fd3c2eed3aa5d0975e5088aa	I'm sorry, but these people aren't your friends.

If your not confident in this plan ahead what you can say.|`|pugNBfjjaa	The best way end it all is to be frank with your friend that he/she embarrasses you with what he/she says about you (or whatever it is he/she did).

UQJ4ZnVdaa	Yo, hombre de 60 a?os, con tres intentos matrimoniales fracasados, te sugiero que:<br>  1. Conserves tu matrimonio a toda costa. O sea dale preferencia, pues son 18 a?os ya de estar luchando contra viento y marea, para conformar el hogar, para que venga una "tormentita hermosa" y acabe con todo.<br>  2. Dialogues con tu esposa. Analicen su propia vida, el resultado de esos 18 a?os de vivir juntos. Si es plausible el divorcio. Sincérate con ella. Si ella te comprende, qué bueno, si te pone obstáculos, pues también abre los ojos a la realidad. Piensa que tienes 50 a?os, en 10 a?os más, entrarás a la Tercera Edad. <br>  3. Que hagas un sincero examen de conciencia, te confieses con un sacerdote, o platiques con un psicólogo, con el fin de dilucidar dudas al respecto.<br>  Si sientes ese sentimiento de culpa, es porque aún amas a tu esposa, porque sientes agradecimiento y remordimiento a la vez, por todo el tiempo que te ha soportado, atendido, cuidado, etc.<br>  No mencionas la edad que tiene esa mujer estupenda, pero me imagino que le has de llevar unos 10 a?os mínimo; de cualquier manera, primero debes de conocerla más a fondo, saber cuáles son sus inclinaciones hacia ti, qué proyectos tiene en su vida, sus ambiciones, etc. Tal vez te esté utilizando como trampolín para llegar a otra meta. Tal vez lo que sienta por ti sea pasajero. Lo que quiero sugerirte es que no te tomes tan en serio a ti mismo, toma muy en cuenta tu edad. Deja que pase un tiempo para conocerse, primero como novios, tal vez, como amantes; y por supuesto, cálale a vivir como esposo de esta nueva conquista. Pero no te cierres las puertas con tu esposa, por si no funciona, puede ser que necesites volver a ella, arrepentido, dulcemente convencido que tu lugar está con ella.<br>  Pero claro, no es una decisión que se toma a la ligera, estúdiala, ojalá que puedas tomar la decisión correcta, la más acertada.|`|5031734ebd25d8936d51487a0e756573aa	que difícil, yo te digo que la vida esa una sola, y vos tenes la opción de elegir si vivir feliz o no.|`|ab9bcfd52f98735308b6b88c0646de3daa	Oye en verdad que me da cosita con tu esposa, pues sabes yo he vivido en carne propia eso de las infidelidades y en verdad que es fuerte... pero yo creo que lo mejor es que seas sincero con ella, ya basta de estar viviendo con ella y sentirte culpable por haber conocido a otra mujer, que bueno, lamentandolo mucho por tu esposa es la que aparentemente te hace feliz. Yo te recomiendo que a tu edad, lo mejor es que seas sincero y vivas tu experiencia, habla con tu esposa lo mas calmado que puedas, trata de que no sea en tu casa, para que tu hijo no escuche en caso de alguna reacción fuerte de parte de tu esposa, y pórtense como dos personas maduras. No sé tal ves podrías llevarla a cenar, lejos de tu casa, o llevarla al sitio donde ustedes acostumbren a conversar en forma apropiada, y confesarle lo que sientes, que tus sentimientos han cambiado hacia ella por xxxx razones y que se ha presentado en tu vida una mujer que te ha llamado la atención y haz sentido que estás enamorado de esa otra mujer, trata de que te comprenda, no te alteres, no la culpes de lo que te sucede, simplemente demuéstrale que es parte de la vida, y que tú no puedes evitar sentir lo que sientes en este momento, pídele que te comprenda, que todos somos seres humanos, y trata de siempre ofrecerle tu amistad sincera, y que por tu hijo, deben estar unidos...quien sabe... alomejor de parte de ella también existe aburrimiento en la relación.... mucha suerte en tu desición....y felicidad....espero que se sinceren ambos y tu esposa lo tome con tranquilidad...adelante....|`|e57af0619b3cc168a6a27e634a3c8782aa	hola favlio,no se puede mandar a los sentimientos y estos te an traicionado,no te sientas mal,solo es que la vida es a si y ahora te ofrece aquello q jamas pensaste q te ofreciera,es verdad q tu mujer saldrá da?ada,pero si no la quieres también lo pasara mal y tu y tu hijo,sereis los tres,explicase lo a ella,espero q te entienda ,te deseo suerte y felicidad,no la dejes escapar(la felicidad y el amor)|`|CHXtkdeFaa	Y yo que me hago problemas!es terrible lo que te pasa amigo,primero te felicito por tu miedo superado realmente debes haber sufrido mucho.<br>  Mi consejo sabes cual es No sigas sufriendo!

adiós matrimonio, hijo y venga nueva vida llena d pasión y aventura, estas viejo, pero no maduro, me parece un acto irresponsable de tu parte, cuando te casaste sin amor debiste pensar en todo eso, debiste saber q estabas asumiendo tremenda responsabilidad, tus errores comenzaron al casarte sin amor, enga?ando y jugando con los sentimientos de una persona por tu bien personal, ahora q ya no la necesitas la dejas votada, wow tun si q eres tremendo hombre!<br>  Soy psicóloga y se q esto no es lo q debería decirte, pero lo q tu deberías hacer es quedarte con tu esposa, pagale con ese sacrificio el tiempo q la has mantenido enga?ada y viviendo un matrimonio sin amor, ahora es tu turno de sacrificarte, y de corazón te deseo suerte, aunque no la mereces, es que me asquea ver tantas personas falsas como tu.<br>  Bye|`|YefDlGLyaa	Solamente una pregunta aún amas a tu mujer?Si la respuesta es no y si no sientes nada por ella.....tu tienes la respuesta.<br>  Si la respuesta es que aun sientes cosas por ella daros una oportunidad,iros de viaje aunque sea un fin de semana solos y hablad...Suerte!|`|bf84948641a68454b309bf91a99c4bc0aa	perdon pero la verdad no tengo la menoir idea que decirte ya q es muy complicado!!!!|`|da8a31979ecf0bf333f96f68006ee624aa	CREO QUE ESTAS DESLUMBRADO, PORQUE CREES QUE TU ESTIMA SE ELEVO,,,PERO NO ME PARECE JUSTO QUE SI TU ESPOSA TE AMA, Y TE "AGUANTO",,AHORA LA DEJAS POR ALGUIEN QUE SUPUESTAMENTE ESTA ENAMORADA,,SABES QUE LOS HOMBRES CASADO, SON UNA TENTACIóN ,(DE COMPETENCIA) PARA UNA MUJER,,,,ANDA A TERAPIA, SI ES NECESARIO DE PAREJA,,HABLALO CON TU ESPOSA,,,,LO HECHO ,HECHO ESTA,,,APARTE PENSA EN TU HIJO,,,EL SIEMPRE TE HABRá VISTO COMO UN HéROE,,,LA VIDA TIENE ESOS FLASHES,,PERO DESPUéS PASA,,,,,SUERTE,|`|f1fd0448e294ec5560eab316e4acfb3faa	i′m have problem houston!!!<br>  -que dificil esa situación !!!, la he vivido y he tomado decisiones que no estoy seguro hayan sido  las correctas.<br>  Por un lado sientes que tienes un deber y debes lealtad y por otro la "tentación" y la probabilidad de los perfecto (en apariencia hoy) de un futuro con ma?anas más luminosas y menos monótonas. Ahora te sientes un vegetal casi seguro. <br>  Siempre digo "se debe hacer lo que se debe hacer" pero en tu caso es la pregunta del millon ?que hacer?.<br>  <br>  Primero deberías estar seguro que la otra persona te bancará y ver si está dispuesta a soportar los cambios que se vienen y que no todos serán agradables.<br>  <br>  No tengo idea de las relaciones sexuales con tu mujer actual, pero si no son satisfactorias (por la continuidad más que nada) te diría que "tomes al toro por las astas" y resuelvas el problema (estimo alguien saldrá "con la ropa rota").<br>  Evidentemente has vivido al menos 45 a?os con la estima baja y tu mujer ha sido como "el salvavidas". Es muy dificil lo que te pasa y más decirte o darte un consejo sin conocer los hechos y las personas.<br>  Si acá alguien te dice que si o que no; te quedes o te vayas es un inconsciente porque tu vida puede dar un vuelco de nuevo y lo  peor, tienes altas probabilidades de volver a repetir la historia anterior o peor .... porque no se si te enterasteís? siempre se puede estar peor .....<br>  <br>  De cualquier manera no debe ser por lo que pueda pasar en el futuro lo que hagas que decidas sino por lo que quieras hacer de tu vida.<br>  Personalmente, tendría que vencer mi sentimiento de lealtad,  responsabilidad, y gratitud por alguien que me ha dado "vida". Si fuera ella (tu mujer) me sentiría traicionada y conste que seguramente ella no tenía baja autoestima, Claro vosotros diréis que "el amor es el amor" si......  pienso que  se han cometido tantos asesinatos en nombre del amor, tantas injusticias .... que realmente no estoy seguro que el amor esté por encima de los valores morales, en todo caso lo pondría a la misma altura pero no justificaria realizar una traición por amor.<br>  en todo caso deberías conversarlo con tu mujer y no este lugar donde la mayoría no pasan los 25 a?os y esto es poca experiencia para aconsejar a una persona de 50 por más bien intencionado que uno esté.|`|zdWFV866aa	No puedo decirte cómo  deberías actuar tú, sólo puedo decirte qué hice yo en un cso similar.<br>  Primero debí ser sincera conmigo misma, cosa que tú estas haciendo ahora.<br>  Segundo hablé con mi pareja, me parecía lo más leal. Muchos me criticaron, diciéndome que estaba loca por haber hablado.....pero si uno no puede ser sincero con la persona que elegió para convivir, ?entonces con quién va a serlo?<br>  Luego de hablar con mi pareja, decidimos permanecer juntos y darnos otra oportunidad, no te digo que hagas lo mismo, simplemente que es mejor (para mi), primero ser fui el a uno y a la persona que tiene al lado.<br>  Me parece justo que así como cambiaste tú, le des también la oportunidad a tu pareja de hacer lo mismo.  Recuerda que es más fácil destruir que construir.<br>  No tengas miedo a cambiar y a crecer, pero siempre hazlo desde el amor y el respeto.|`|a2c0b5fd431324d02046dd54438edf63aa	Debes hablar con tu mujer... no es facil... ya lo se... pero tené que buscar tu felicidad...

Mi viejo se enamoro de otra mina, esta barbaro y estupendo con nosotras, mi vieja conocio a un tipo, viaja, esta sonrriente, se lebanta con ganas... estan felices... cuesta y uno cree que es el fin del mundo... pero HAY QUE BUSCAR LA FELICIDAD DE UNO MISMO...  nadie la busca por vos. Asique si vos sos feliz con esta chica...trata de poder llegar a esa posta.

Por desgracia la vida, aunque no lo parezca, es muy corta.<br>  Intenta no hacer da?o a tu pareja actual y vive esa relación nueva a tope. ya veras como dentro de un tiempo te alegras de haberlo hecho.<br>  Suerte en la elección y no dudes.<br>  Javier|`|9e4e760246bbae7f3ff20e0d87a59484aa	Lo que debes hacer es disfrutar tus cambios mentales junto a tu mujer y comentale lo que piensas, tus formas positivas no deben servirte para intentar cambiar tu vida para construirte otra, sino para disfrutar mas de la que tienes, y hacerselo ver a los que te rodean.

Me parece horrorosa la práctica del aborto, porque, como vos decís, ese bebé en gestación es una parte de una misma, pero... cada mujer, o pareja, debe tener el derecho de decidir que es lo que desea hacer ante un embarazo no deseado. Porque, de todos modos los abortos seguirán realizándose en la clandestinidad, aun con muchísimos riesgos para la salud de la persona que se lo practica.

Yo personalmente estoy a favor pero por el simple hecho de que creo que es un derecho de la mujer decidir sobre su cuerpo y su mente.<br>  No creo que sea solo una buena solucion, por el contrario asi como estoy a favor del aborto estoy a favor de la vida y no es justo que un bebe, aun siendo lo mas maravilloso y magico que pueda imaginarse, deba pagar luego por la inconciencia de sus padres. <br>  Vos citaste casos extremos, como una violacion, esos son temas delicados, no es todo asi de liso y llano como tomar un embarazo como el regalo de Dios. Hay que evaluar muchas mas cosas.<br>  De todas maneras lo importante es tener en cuenta que debemos empezar con una buena educacion sexual para que el aborto no se use. Al fin de cuentas la hipocrecia mayor radica en que muchos defenestran el aborto por defender la vida y decir que es asesinar una parte tuya pero luego no son capaces de defender a sus hijos dandoles herramientas para su sexualidad....<br>  en fin esa es mi opinion!<br>  besos|`|u09VwLlnaa	por que la gente no entiende  q si una mujer no quiere un bb para q lo va a traer al mundo para maltratarlo? botarlo en cuanto nazca? o hacer de el un malviviente y un peligro para la sociedad? y que hay de esas mujeres que son violadas porque deben ser forzadaas a tener ese hijo que no desean que es producto de una aberrracion o q se rompa el condon si esta mujer sabe que no lo quiere tener q no lo desea yo creo que es lo mejor q puede hacer, o q me dices de las q saben q su hijo viene enfermo y sab4e que no va a tener ni el coraje ni dinero para poder seguir adelante o simplemente porque no quiere que ese ni?o sufra de burlas y desprecios y una vida llena de complicaciones NO CREEN  YO CREO Q LA MUJER TIENE TODO EL DERECHO DE HACER CON SU CUERPO LO Q ELLA DECIDA ES MEJOR ABORTARLO QUE DEJARLO POR AHI BOTADO MALTRATARLO TIRARLO RECIEN NACIDO ESE SI ES UN CRIMEN O DARLO EN ADOPCION QUE AL FIN Y CABO SABRA Q PADRES LE TOCARA O SIACABA SOLO Y SELLENE DE MALAS COMPA?IAS<br>  (aclaro yo no me he practicado uno pero no me aparto del derecho q debe tener la mujer con su cuerpo)|`|32BwaUHZaa	Si seguimos sin considerar las repercusiones en el plano legal  creo que el discurso ya esta muy gastado y no se llega a ninguna parte. Al parecer no se enfocan -o no se quieren enfocar- en las repercusiones jurídicas que lleva la despenalización del aborto. Una observación de despenalizarse el aborto, el varón tendría a su vez el derecho de deslindarse de la manutención de un bebé si “antes de la doceava semana” manifiesta su inconformidad ante notario sobre el desarrollo de dicho bebé -”petición de aborto”- ya que al igual que a la mujer puede contraponer su proyecto de vida”. Bueno este es un punto de tantos que se pueden mencionar. Lamentablemente las comisiones de género solo dan un punto de vista, “Feminista” y se les olvida por completo el derecho la igualdad y equidad de género. O cuando somos iguales y cuando diferentes hombres y mujeres ante la ley??? Reflexionemos antes de abrir la puerta y veamos si somos capaces de legislar lo que entre por ella.<br>  YA ESTAMOS HARTOS DE LAS COMISIONES DE GENERO, MUJER NO TE DAS CUENTA QUE SOLO TE MANIPULAN Y TE DAN ATOLE CON EL DEDO. INFORMATE Y HAZTE TU CRITERIO PERO NO BASADO EN DISCURSOS QUE SOLO PRETENDEN OBTENER TU VOTO O SEGUIR SIENDO MANTENIDOS POR TUS IMPUESTOS. SOLO PODEMOS CRECER COMO GENERO HUMANO, NO POR SEPARADO HOMBRES Y MUJERES. A la sociedad se le inculca el que el ser mujer lleva intrinsicamente la bondad, buena voluntad y sabes? igual que los hombres los hay buenas y malas. Eso lo saben perfectamente los politicos pero no lo dicen por miedo a perder tu voto.<br>  YA BASTA DE DISCRIMINACION POSITIVA<br>  Atentamente<br>  LOS HOMBRES|`|Gl4iIFDOaa	yo creo que esas mujeres si selespude llamar así que no creo no mere sen vivir deberían ahorcarlas.|`|X0DzE3XPaa	te entiendo, pienso lo mismo. Pero me pongo en el lugar de una chica discapacitada, o aquellas que arriesgan su vida ya siendo madres... y la verdad que me cuesta pensar en sacrificar la vida de la madre por el bebe...<br>  <br>  Es muy dificil. Lo que si no acepto de ninguna manera es que aborte quien es sano, y que solo le falta la plata....|`|jZn1GkhFaa	Mira, yo soy catolica, adoro a Dios, y estoy a favor del aborto.<br>  Soy cubana y aqui el aborto es legal, entiendo perfectamente porque estas en contra, y quiero que sepas que yo tampoco apoyo a las personas irresponsables que matan a esas criaturitas.<br>  Pero de veras no puedes criticar a una persona que no puede tener a ese bebe, en este mundo a miles de mujeres que no se pueden mantener a ellas mismas, como crees que se van a cuidar a un bebe??<br>  De veras critico la irreponsabilidad y la falta de conciencia y la incultura de muchas personas, pero realmente quieres que vengan al mundo bebes que van a sufrir, que su vida no va a ser una sonrisa, y que muchos no van a querer que llegue el dia de la mamá. Hay tantas muchachas de 12, 13, 14 a?os que ya estan pariendo. Y todavia te atreves a criticar el aborto. <br>  Creo que deberias informarte mas sobre esto, la vida no es balnca y negra, deberias conocer mas sobre las diferentes tonalidades.<br>  Bye

What's a matter afraid to make decision on your own.  Come on Dude, reach down there give them a squeeze and man up.|`|DwRMnOeAaa	Um...well that's sort of a bad way to put it. You should just ask her one day to go out with you sometime, like to a coffee place or to a nice little eatery. Being that way will shock her and most likely turn her off. But if you ask her out, with this method, if she accepts, then you know there might be a chance of something. But you doing it the way you were planning on doing it is just all wrong.<br>  <br>  good luck though,<br>  you may have found the one for you.|`|17d27945bfa8b1234e981944ce0d702aaa	Well honestly if you said it like that...she would probably think you are weird.

Things from there will just "click" if it is right. <br>  Hope this helps!!|`|GdIy4AM7aa	Just ask her, be really friendly about it though be like I heard you had the HOT'S for me is this true or what, if she says something in the nature of liking you then, Say well I like you too, do you want to grab a bite after work, could turn into a really good friendship or great relationship. <br>  <br>  Goodluck|`|NpciiP0Xaa	Yeah!

It is definitely possible to love to people at the same time.|`|9fT3SbxWaa	If your current boyfriend hasn't done anything to you and your ex has, then there's a reason that your still with your boyfriend and not your ex. Your ex is probably going to hurt you again if you go back to him. Have you talked to your current boyfriend yet (about what's wrong with him)? Does he know that you've been hanging around with your ex? If not, then he may have found out and he might be thinking that your cheating on him. If he does, then maybe there's something that happened in his family. That's really all I have....good luck :)!|`|TVAdQwjyaa	It sounds like you are looking towards your ex for the closeness that's missing lately from your boyfriend.  Your boyfriend is going through a tough time right now and he needs you to be there for him, not getting close to someone else.  Also, your ex has hurt you in the past.  He has already shown what he's capable of doing so how can you trust him?  He would have to earn that over time.  Your boyfriend has a clean record, he deserves your full attention and love right now.  Don't open that can of worms with your ex because you risk losing a good man (your boyfriend).

Los sentimientos los maneja el cerebro, y una de las reacciones es causar una ligera opresión en el pecho cuando hay alguna causa de disgusto. Al ligarse una decepción con la opresión da la sensación de que es el corazón el que duele. Desde luego que cuando el cerebro recibe por cualquier medio una noticia buena o mala, genera excitación y trastorno que obliga al corazón a bombear sangre mas rápidamente para oxigenar al cerebro.|`|4ad2e7d9b741c711a62c827e6360b895aa	NO SE, NO SOY CIENTIFICO.|`|Q9PGNvtyaa	No creó que te duela el corazón, pero pienso que cuando la persona a la que quieres te rechaza te sientes triste por que es algo que tu querías y al que estabas muy apegado y te desilusiona el saber que no lo conseguirás.<br>  Salu2!!|`|gDa4JYapaa	Yo creo que te estas infartando...|`|fbL9We8Naa	porque algo querido se te fue poro piensa que no hay mal que por bien no venga talve te hizo un favor

Hollywood is the worst thing that happened to America and there should be more men that like bbws. maybe this will cause more girls to think it's alright to be a comfortable weight and eat 3 meals a day

Start moving the skin gently up and down. Talk to him, ask what feels good. Go faster as he gets more aroused. <br>  <br>  IMPORTANT TIP: Don't point that thing at you when itis about to go off! it will make a mess or your hair! Also, don't stop just because it firsts spits up. Keep going until it's done flowing.<br>  <br>  Finally, wipe your hands. Be ready to have to do it often because once is never enough.|`|4W7WeXNSaa	Thumbs up to Morgan J's answer!!!!!|`|5542933952dcefcead6952789aac5159aa	are you referring to tossing someones salad??<br>  <br>  that is the act of licking another persons booty hole|`|b5PfuXF8aa	huh? i never heard of this before, i would like to see the answers to this. licking someones booty hole? or are you using a different saying for giving a hand job? i'm confused...i'm gonna look at your answers lol<br>  <br>  P.S. if you ARE talking about a hand job, then yea, go with morgan j's answer...thats how you do it

Prostitution is very legal though and flies under the guise of Dating, Courtships, and the GrandMammy of them all....... Marriage.<br>  <br>  It is good to see that you are beginning to draw the parrallel between having (spending) money, and women.  You don't mention your age but I assume you are under 25 since you are in college (just an assumption though).  If so, Good For You man.  Learning this concept at any young age will only benefit you throughout life.<br>  <br>  A friends father once said, "There's not enough money in the world to fill that hole"<br>  <br>  ;)|`|309211a9d2e75f06a78c8685cb1c131eaa	There are a number of great women out there who are intelligent enough to realize that you are broke because you're educating yourself in order to have a future.  Not all women are vain.  Don't rush it.  You end up finding the best ones when you're just not looking.  Good luck!|`|UZC8B56maa	You might try moving out of your mom's house or maybe you can barrow her car, lol.

If you keep quiet, you may as well be one of her girlfriends - meaning someone who is never going to be in a romantic relationship with her.   Tell her how you feel, if she can't handle it and stops talking to you, it'll probably be for the best.  You can finally stop dieing a little inside every time you think about dating her, and her ignoring the situation.|`|AnbogWW2aa	Sorry, but she's DATING  ANOTHER GUY. Find someone who won't use you. And don't sleep with them. It will mess with your emotions even more.|`|KQGQQEHvaa	well personally I would talk to her in person about it.

" or " some people should keep there bf on one side and there bff on the other....just kidding" she will get the message that you are trying to make a point.|`|7o3d9P9Paa	u say it. tell her u wanna hang, and tell her her bf is driving u 2 apart.|`|a433ce9cf03d5b4e4c87d3feef31fab0aa	Let her know that you feel neglected, and you wish you could spend time with her as much as you used to. She may think you are jealous of her and her boyfriend's relationship, so don't mention that you hate him. Say that you are happy for her and her boyfriend, but you miss her and the time you used to spend together.
ZwTxdFxIaa	if he starts following u spin around and give him a big slap across the face!|`|4zX5BO1baa	tell him that you would never like him|`|ZJMQTqsmaa	just tell him gently "you suck, buzz off."|`|gKKfObh5aa	tell him how you feel. make sure he knows ur not jp. or act completely different like at like a complete jerk/retard when ever ur around him. and pick ur nose. and gross stuff like that haha|`|0ysQUSMHaa	the saying "keep your friends close and your enimies closer" should do they trick. find out somthing embarrasing about him then see if her bothers you..<br>  (i know that kinda mean but hey if it helps then go for it..).......|`|14c2d9089f926798d424d45b85996660aa	Just tell him you hate him and you dont wanna be near him, but then ur going to feel bad and end up dating. win win situation for him|`|AA10877931	start flirting with tougher guys...

Glh8om9uaa	Fact is that she IS coming to you for help, which points out that she wants your advice/opinion. Now the real question why she doesn't take your advice. You can either offer your advice and train yourself not to care what people do after it (i.e.: take your advice or not) or you can make it clear to your friend in a very serious tone that if she wants guys (or anything else for that matter) to keep doing that to her, then to take your advice or quit asking for it. Sometimes people need to be spoken to in a direct and serious manner, because truth is, you may know what to do because you aren't in the situation and therefore have a birds eye view of everything and she can't decide what to do because she IS the one that is involved in the situation, and she quite simply can't see what to do.|`|HQFiqm2Haa	every girl has that problem. i used to ask my sister for advice (older sisters seem to know everything) but i would never listen. i got hurt because i didn't listen. she's going to do it regardless of what you say to her, so just keep doing what you're doing and maybe the really important things will get through.|`|f5PGMXf0aa	say okay if im gonna give you advice you need to taKE IT CAUSE YOUR MY FRIEND AND IF U GET HURT IM GONNA LIKE DIE BECAUSE YOUR NOT BY MY SIDE IM YOUR FRIEND AND YOU NEED TO GO TO A PEROSN THAT CAN HELP OR JUST STOP DATING GUYS UNTIL YOUR SURE ITS THE ONE|`|nFU1r3uCaa	i would calm her down with popcorn and a movie then bring up what ever you wish to talk to her about and if she gets upset after that then there is nothing you can do besides let her work out the problem

71dda235bbabfb4e0ffa5fd75cdd45c0aa	I was sanding some plastic in the back room with the door open to the garden at 11.30pm, a 6ft5+ man in a black & white brand new suit was walking in a military fashion very quickly towards me as if focused on me like he was coming to attack me, I waited until the very last second to turn around & then he disappeared, then immediately I heard noises in the kitchen & my cats' munchies were opened & all over he floor, not by claws, but opened in the usual way. My mum said that she had also seen the exact same man in the same place before, & that was without telling her who I had seen. It's very unusual to see a man of that height in a suit walking quickly towards you at that time appearing out of nowhere in your back garden, when he is clearly visible & everything else is pitch black.|`|ODZbUn3yaa	when i was about thirteen me and my mate had a sleepover,  I woke up in the middle of the night to see my brother sat by the fireplace i went to say what you doing thinking he was sleepwalking he turned and looked at me and it wasnt my brother...he looked at me opened his mouth as in shock and vanished ....freaked me out<br>  <br>  true story|`|OOTbiW26aa	Okay, I live on a burial ground in Indiana. The gravestones aren't here anymore, they haven't been for over 70 years.<br>  The first person said to be buried here was in 1821.<br>  <br>  Sometime in the 1830's, a family was passing through the area. They needed a place to stay because their children were sick. A three-year-old girl named Nancy died. People from around the neighborhood quickly made a coffin out of a black walnut tree and laid her to rest.<br>  <br>  Years later, a headstone was discovered. It was used as a stepping stone for who knows how long. It read Nancy A. Stewart.<br>  She was 3 years, 6 months, and nine days old.<br>  <br>  Every once in a while, if you're lucky, you can get a glimpse of Nancy running around the old shed that's on the property. 3 people have seen her, to my knowledge. I have heard her two times saying my time in the same area that she was spotted.<br>  <br>  This story is in history books in this town. You might want to look up "Ross Kenworthy Farm Cemetery," "Kenworthy Farm Cemetery," or "Alden Farm Cemetery."<br>  <br>  There is even a book that's published called "Lucinda" that has the grave of Nancy mentioned, but in another name.<br>  <br>  There have been other experiences here (A train running right through the house, yet when it got to the other wall, vanished, large, normal sized one, shaking everything. Shadow people. Drums (is also said that this is an Indian burial ground), and other things.)<br>  <br>  Good luck with your story!|`|0Dfqtsgiaa	I don't know if this is what you need but I'll tell you any way! I saw my grandma in a dream one night and she said everything will be okay, you'll get through it. But right now you need to wake up. Well I woke up and everything was okay...until I got to school and one of my friends comes running up to me telling me my cousin called her telling her my uncle commited suicide. Well a couple of years later my grandma came to me in another dream and told me that something bad was going to happen but something good would come out of it. Well (i was homeschooled at the time) around 12:00 the next day my mom gets a call from my dad saying my nephew ( 1 month old) stopped breathing and was in the hospital and he was on his way home to come get us to take us to the hospital. When we pulled up in the hospital parking lot my older brother called and told us my nephew had died. Now I know my grandma is my gaurding angel because everytime something is going to happen shes there ( even though she died in 2004).|`|Qi2A8LYDaa	my sister's friend's tolled me one story....<br>  When she was 12 her father died. One night she get up because she needed too go to the bathroom. her room was on the and of her apartment so then it was kitchen and then there was bathroom. In the kitchen she was have  a chair which her father liked... So when she almost go through the kitchen she saw of her father seating on that chair. he was saying come here Sveta(it my sister's friend name) he said it like 3 or 4 times but she was staying in shock so when he finish saying 5 time come here Sveta she ran back to her room and cover her self with the blanked and she fell a sleep.|`|vOMbpi7faa	Duhhh<br>  why?

You have to BUILD the relationship first before you can have one, You don't start a book at the end of it and expect to know what it was about. Relationships aren't any different,they take time and work before you can expect the rewards from it. I hope that has helped  you out...|`|IagL7kKUaa	don't propose then|`|Rnn5yzsvaa	you don't
AA11561911	Maybe ask him if he wants to hang out first.  A relatonship is a type of friendship, and you can normally tell if a relationship past anything more than friendship would work, if the friendship is there first.  You need to talk to him, to know somthing about him.  He needs to know somthing about you.  I would try and spend time with him as friends first.  Maybe hang out with him in a group of people the first time and work from there.|`|ZwTxdFxIaa	how hard can it b? i've done it plenty of times!|`|dbf396a58f74a9df1b59df3c620d6650aa	don't!!!! work on your self-estem first, if you think you are ugly, what wil he think?|`|f8305c1a3d339ebfda6c53f2c23174ddaa	I have one word for you<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  NOTE<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  try it ;)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <33333<br>  Frankie :D|`|uW4Bup4Naa	give him a note that says "Will you please go out with me, to the movies ? and if your already taken, can we still just be friends<br>  _insert_name_here_ ?|`|GIHVyWKvaa	"hey wona go out with me?"

xOMxYNzAaa	For me it wasn't so much the rapid fluttering of the heart. (Even though the heart did skip a beat or two!) It was more of a calm feeling that swept over my body.  It was sheer comfort. Like happy relief.  I had been looking for him my whole life and finally the puzzle piece fell into place.   I saw him, fell in love instantly, and we have been together ever since.  Tomorrow is our 13th wedding anniversary and we have been together 15 years.  We got together and never broke up. You just know.  I told myself, "That is the father of my children."

mVD8rdfEaa	I would say that you guys are pretty good. So yes it is a good thing.<br>  Its normal for couples to have fights. But it's all on how you deal with it.<br>  You can either dwell on the reason for the argument & make things really ugly, or you can find a solution to the problem and then move on with life.<br>  To me you guys seem to be getting along pretty well. Keep it up & wish you all the best!|`|GzSgLqq2aa	thats normal. but it'll get worse i bet. its always more calm in the first few months.|`|7QHQBvojaa	Yeah as long as you can work out your differences then it sounds pretty stable to me|`|mDGXPpQYaa	There's nothing wrong with not fighting unless the two of you are just passive aggressive and/or avoiding confrontation.  If you have actually managed to argue reasonably about any problems then I would say that you can consider yourself on a good track.

Why are you asking on here is your relationship is going to last?  If you have doubt then it probably will not last. Because when people have doubt about their relationship then more then likely there not being true themselves in the relationship.  So if you have your doubts within your heart then you need to talk it over with your lady and ask questions and get things out in the open.  Just a little advice. So good luck with whatever happens. :)|`|c8a016af9075c2a29c115f25cd86a6d8aa	It would have probably lasted more than it did so far.  Don't beat yourself, and learn that sometimes the woman can not be blamed for cheating, sometimes the man's personality and attitude are unattractive that cause women to be with the nearest man they can find.
f3c0cdc1cb419a11a77421cb625a5a57aa	OCD can be mild to totally crippling. It may be as simple as checking your door twice before you leave to make sure it's locked because it makes you feel secure,  to checking your door 20-30 times, locking and relocking it to make sure its going to be ok.<br>  <br>  Manic depression (bi-polar disorder is what i think you mean) is when someone is depressed but has happy periods of time too. When someone is manic it seems like everything is great their life, they may spend a lot of money, enjoy being more social, etc. But their moods can change suddenly and even the smallest thing can knock them off the tip of the happy iceberg. <br>  <br>  Definatly look online for more resources. I hope you are ok.

dLjDkhzdaa	Tout dépend des gens, beaucoup ne supporteront pas cela mais d'autres le tolèreront parfaitement, voire le considèreront comme partie intégrante de leur relation. Voir le livre "La douce joie d'être trompée" de Catherine Laborde (oui, la même qui présente la météo), qui explique qu'elle a toujours été avec des hommes qui l'ont trompée ; aujourd'hui, elle raconte vivre dans un appartement juste au-dessus de celui de son homme, car elle ne voulait pas vivre avec lui et supporter l'humiliation de le découvrir avec une autre. Malgré tout, elle entend lorsqu'il est avec une autre femme et cela la stimule à nouveau pour le reconquérir, cela fait partie de leur couple. Cela n'exclue pas l'amour. <br>  <br>  Je connais aussi l'exemple d'un couple homosexuel dont l'un est très souvent à l'étranger. L'autre prend donc la liberté d'avoir des aventures lorsque son conjoint n'est pas là, et son conjoint le sait parfaitement, il sait aussi que s'il ne désire pas être trompé, il faut qu'il trouve un moyen d'être présent. <br>  <br>  Pour conclure, cela va dépendre des couples et de la fa?on de voir les choses de chacun. Certains ne tolèreront pas, d'autres pourront pardonner, d'autres accepteront.|`|CkFec64Xaa	Oui je pense sincèrement que l'on peut aimer son conjoint et en même temps aimer une autre personne .Seul ceux qui ont peur peuvent dire le contraire .C'est mon cas en tout cas .<br>  Qui à dit qu'un être humain avait le coeur aussi étroit que de ne pouvoir aimer qu'une seule personne ?Moi je suis sur de pouvoir aimer réellement et sincèrement un grand nombre de femmes sans aucune restriction . et je dis aimer dans le sens réel .|`|DEwZDSdPaa	Je vois mal comment l'amour, un sentiment profond d'attachement destiné à UNE SEULE ET UNIQUE personne peut s'accorder avec la notion d'infidélité qui met en jeu au moins une seconde personne.<br>  <br>  Infidélité = trahison ...

WoQDwYK8aa	You're not alone, my ex-boyfriend is now seeing someone new and it has only been a month since we broke up. I did feel hurt but at the same time, I realize that we are broken up so he can date whoever he wants.  You should not feel bad about not finding someone new yet. This is a great time for you to recover from you last relationship, reflect on yourself and find things that make you happy.  Im trying to learn to be happy with or without a man in my life. Im trying to stay active, meet up with friends, doing things I enjoy. Everytime you have negative thought stop yourself and think of something positive. I know it is easier said than done but with time it gets easier. You will find someone special when your time comes. There are a lot of people and opportunities out there.

fa03383ce7b68be9f1365218dea643f1aa	You are going to have to make a choice between the two, and fast. Either drop the friend and keep dating the guy, or dump the guy and start dating his friend (which by the way sounds like an extreme betrayal to the original guy and might break their friendship) Plus you don't know for sure if the friend actually likes you back. I would stick with the first guy if I were in your position, just because the alternative seems like a bit of a jerk move.|`|4YvfELYlaa	ok, well i have been that boyfriend, and i can tell you it completly sucks.  even if you decide never to tell him or anyone else, he will be able to just tell from the way that you look at his friend. i know it was way to easy for me to spot. you may think he cant, but sooner or later he will.<br>  <br>  my advice, tell him.  He doesn't deserve that kind of humiliation brought upon him.  i would then give it at least a week or two before you try anything with this friend, if you even plan on doing that. <br>  <br>  hope this helps.|`|aa94680894c40cde7c92c72f06776a18aa	easy one  ,  cus i have or had the same exact problem. If the other one wanted you he would be with you so forget about him he is just something to look at  the one your with is what ur focus shuld be on  you must have saw somthing in him to chose him over the other.  But if you feel a greater attraction to his friend break up with him but dont go with his friend right after that would break his heart and friendship try stayin with who you are with though it is probably a reason for this relationship

As far as them hanging together they kind of have to do that, because they have that child to raise together. As far as him not inviting you to his Dad's birthday party, that was kind of a low blow. Sit him down and let him know how much he hurts you. It seems as if they were hanging out as a family and you were the oddball out.  <br>  <br>  Be easy and let him breathe because if he feels you are stressing, he will cut you off. NOTHING IS MORE IMPORTANT TO HIM THAN THAT CHILD.<br>  But ALSO stress that you are his girl and if he wants to keep it that way, your feeling have to be considered. STRESS the fact it is not the child that is bothering you...... IT IS THE EX :)

neuronas.<br>  tengo algunas preguntas para tu hermana me harias el favor?<br>  1. como te imaginas que van a ser tus fines de semana despues de casada.<br>  2. es el tipo de padre que quieres para tus hijos?<br>  3.como te visualizas en 10 a?os?<br>  4. en caso de que el matrimonio no funcione, qué preparacion tienes para sacar adelante a tus hijos?<br>  <br>  por ultimo: al novio que tienes visualizalo tal como es, no le quites ni le pongas porque estes enamorada, miralo tal como es, ahora a sus cualidades, restale el 50% a sus defectos sumale el 50% y ese es el marido que vas a tener.<br>  <br>  para ponerte un ejemplo mas claro:<br>  si llega a su casa a las 11 de la noche, va a llegar a la una sin bien te va.<br>  si no respeta a tu familia, vas a tener problemas cada vez que la visites.<br>  si le gusta salir con sus amigos, siempre van a estar ellos primero que tu.<br>  <br>  yo pienso que las personas nunca cambiamos, solo fingimos temporalmente para conseguir lo que queremos pero al final, siempre volvemos a ser los mismos.<br>  <br>  yo se que nada de esto va a hacer cambiar de opinion a tu hermana pero por lo menos hazle saber que no la dejas ir sin un consejo y que vas a estar ahi cuando te necesite, (que va a ser mas pronto de lo que ella cree)<br>  <br>  en mi humilde opinion.|`|a02224dc0bb127e68e66fd44bd379c30aa	Rosa de Castilla,la mancha<br>

54c9b245885dedf607befab699ecd325aa	Well if your best friend won't let you hang out with you you want to, then this person isn't really a good friend. But just try to talk to him. That's what i would do. GOOD LUCK!|`|8db3c22350c51cd424d33a7f3be05b0faa	Just because your friend doesn't like that person doesn't mean you can't like him. I know how you feel. My best friend's mad at my friend, and it doesn't seem like they'll ever be friends again, and he has no problem with it, as long as I never mention his name. My girlfriend's mad at my best female friend because we were wrestling in the pool, and it seemed like she was on top of me (we weren't together at that time). Your friend can't and shouldn't try to control who your friends are. If my best friend became friends with some person I have no respect for, I can't stop him, but I won't be too happy about it.<br>  <br>  My point- Just hang out with both of them. If your friend's not too happy about it, that's okay, but if he was really your friend, he shouldn't try to control who your friends are.|`|LjyfQZdwaa	Doesn't sound like you have to do anything.  Its his decision, how he handles friendships, so his loss.  He may be trying to control you, or be looking out for your interest.  Either way, his behavior is one that is controlling.  That's no way to be in any friendship.  Open friendships should be a welcoming circle, not a hindering one.  Hope that helps.  Thanks for asking.|`|QDDpITshaa	okkk i think that if your best friend is threatening that he/shell stop being your friend if you hang out w/ this person than it seems like you 2 arent really that close. but i mean youd kno that better than i would obviously.  i guess you just have to decide in the end which is more important to you. good luck! sorry i cant help you that much. :[|`|edd927bb605182ea5e5ea0152768e746aa	friends are supportive, and truthful. Why would you want a best friend like that? He should allow you to have other friends regardless if he approves of the person or not.  The choice is yours.  Sometimes we think we can't live without someone....a partner, friend, or a lover. What we need to realize is that sometimes we out grow those people.  Consider you situation carefully.  Will you lose out on potential good friend because your so-called friend does not approve. what will happen in the future? If he does not approve of the person you fall in love with....will you let them go because your friend doesn't approve or trust them.<br>  <br>  Good luck....I think you need to find yourself a new best friend.|`|ylZTCrSYaa	talk to your best friend and tell him that maybe he has friends you dont like so much either. but work something out bc a best friend is an awful thing to lose.

AA10860004	1. congratulations on making a good decision and making the first step. it is refreshing to know there are girls such as yourself... i'm kind of tired of lazy chicks who thinks it comes served to them... relationship are to be interactive and engaging, you can't afford of being lazy if you want to get what you know you deserve.<br>  <br>  <br>  2. net meeting is a bit complicated and tricky if you are new at it, the game differs a little.  you don't get the same human interaction and words and the way your profile is and your pictures have a much greater impact on the perception of the other person. <br>  <br>  however, you can get into quite interesting conversations from time to time, you just have to sort the loosers from the winners (yes, a lot of girls on the net as well are complete morons or are just there to get attention nothing more so I don't get the response I'm hopping for all the time, I guess it's the same for a girl that prefers to get what she wants). <br>  <br>  what I do: keep saying hi / hello from time to time, people get so bombarded with spam and loosers all the time that is really refreshing to get a nice and sincere hello from time to time... if it's meant to happen, it will... <br>  <br>  but you can't really push it, people are different in real life then on the net, you got to know this. what you think of them when you read about them it's your perspective of them reflected through your mind and soul, while they are real persons with different thinking, values and dreams. no matter how you think you are connected, until you meet them in real life, you can't really make that a strong affirmation.<br>  <br>  don't get me wrong, it's good to be that passionate and have a strong belief, but you have to wait and get to know the other person and not portrait him before, you'll get in unnecessary trouble.<br>  <br>  Sorry, i've diverted a little bit, but went through the same issues a couple of times, so thought you might want to hear that. <br>  <br>  back to your problem: upgrade your profile :), get more interesting photos (you don't have to look too sexy, just make them fun), improve a little bit your messages, be different and challenging for a change. i though that just casual conversation might not just do it... just for that i've told you this.<br>  <br>  however, you have to learn to be patient, it's not like real time conversation, where people give immediate answers just becuase they're in front of you, they might be gone, not logging in on the site, not be in the mood to answer, not having the time to answer. things move a little slower (that's why i like/try getting the girls digits fast and get her talking, the real connection is stronger than just text and they feel closer and more confortable after they hear my voice really fast - but it doesn't allways works this smooth as i would wish, it's difficult to get them confortable with the idea of giving their number to a complete stranger because it could be another looser/maniac from the web).<br>  <br>  remember, have fun first and think of connections and other crazy stuff later... it's always interesting to have a very passionate relationship and they usually start off with unusual first meetings, with strong emotions: attraction, hate, lust, common passion/s for something/s, crazy stuff in general :D... it allways lead to more deep stronger feelings later (hopefully positives ones).<br>  <br>  <here is an idea of a good come back message, but i can't guaranty for it as I was never a lady picking up men :D: subject: "smile!! you've got a new message." message: "hey you! what are you doing? i've written you some 'cute' lines and you just ignore me like that!! that's just plain silly, are you scared of girls or something? :)<br>  <br>   thought we might start talking, as i like <<that>> and <<that>> from your profile, but if you are too shy, I don't want to scare you away... bye. take care!"> <br>  <br>  the message might need some fine tunning, ask for girl opinnions from your friends with more experience. <br>  <br>  let me know how it worked out and what you used to get him, because I don't see you loosing at this :D! have fun and take care!|`|0b978cc3057df578c02d93a6e13c26e8aa	And the question is?|`|d3b046b366ec5b5d248037165e21dc5eaa	Don't meet them.|`|vFGUNvFFaa	how old are you ? if you are young maybe its not the time but if ur ok then maybe you should  just forget him.

pTcI1Eq3aa	secondo me nn è giusto che un figlio debba rinunciare alle proprie speranze x i genitori anche perchè credo che nn sia molto corretto nei confronti dei propri figli... questo si può vedere soprattutto con i genitori meridionali che sono molto possessivi nei confronti dei figli perchè nn vogliono che sposino ragazze che a loro nn vanno a genio e pretendono che i propri figli sposino le ragazze del posto in modo che loro abbiamo sempre i figli vicini e cosi alla fine chi ci rimette sono sempre i figli e una volta che sono grandi si pentono di non  aver fatto quello che veramente desideravano. E se magari si sposano le loro sofferenze che hanno vissuto durante la loro adolescenza le riversano su i propri figli nn tt ovviamente ognuno reagisce in modo diverso.|`|0e09798d0cb8f1ef63a5e17e540ea303aa	NO, LA VITA E' TUA!!!<br>  LA LORO, I TUOI GENITORI L' HANNO GIA' VISSUTA!!!|`|43c74cf27f89a4cc03b7cf5cde313349aa	No loro la vita se la sono fatta non hanno rinunciato.|`|4l6nYi54aa	concettine,i genitori ci amano e ci ameranno sempre<br>  ma arriva ilmomento in cui hanno il dovere di lasciarci andare<br>  se non lo fanno, siamo noi a doverlo fare per noi stessi<br>  è questo il momento per te?  chieditelo|`|DAfhvoD0aa	No, non è giusto...

gavjd5XDaa	you need to dump the loser and find a real man who can be 50/50 in the relationship. this is just the start sweetie.....if he can't show enough initiative and make the sacrifices to find a way to be with you now, who do you think is going to be paying the bills and supporting you both later? think about it. he's a manipulator, and is pulling your strings already. tell the loser to get a job and a car or sit his *** on the bus, or find someone you can be a PARTNER with, intstead of someone you're going to have to be a mother to.|`|AA11627720	u r right..<br>  keep in mind guys dont think as clearly / reasonably as girls do<br>  i, as a guy, know this to be true.. i cant help but think like a retard.. it has been bothering me a lot lately..|`|AA10675202	whats wrong with, you take the bus here and i drive you home? or i pick you up, and you take the bus home? <br>  if you drove 75 miles to see me, i would at least keep your tank full.|`|JAqMxJVBaa	Your are mostly right but slightly wrong.

VDrdpEMfaa	I'd guess it's one of two things:<br>  1) You were young enough that you didn't have to deal with much confrontation.  It was mostly kiddie games and making out and going to movies.  Once you're older you deal with more practical things (money, college, job) and it's harder to have a care-free relationship like the one you experienced when you were younger.<br>  <br>  2) The other thought is of my co-worker who dated his wife in high school and broke up when they went away to different colleges.  Every person he dated the next 5 years was never better than his high school love.  They met up a little after 5 years of graduating high school and got married.<br>  <br>  Only you know your feelings and only he knows his.  My best recommendation is to keep up with him and be his friend.  After 2 years there shouldn't be anything holding either of you back from keeping in touch and occasionally having dinner or something.  If it's meant to be it'll be.  Besides, if it doesn't you'll have a friend! :)|`|1953ee38fb61aca81efdd17bbaf7e427aa	The first love holds a special place in your heart, and it takes some time to forget it, and replace it, because there is something about the first that makes you remember.  <br>  <br>  But believe me, that person will be replaced, and you'll find true happiness with the new person  :)|`|AA11370170	I have been in your situation too. i was with this guy for 2 years and it was my first real realtiosnhip adn he cheated on me i thought i would never find someone else but i did and we are going to get married.

Everyone does this. You'll find the right person if you keep on looking. In your heart, you'll know whether its "the real thing" or if you just are looking for "real love".

(He isn't worth the the gun powder it takes to make a bullet to load a gun.) <br>  Leave that guy alone.|`|2TCleXQVaa	It sounds like he is communicating with you, you just aren't hearing him. You want him to be mature, honest and thoughtful. He is telling you in a passive aggressive way that he does not want to be with you.

Hopefully to someone who will give you the respect that anyone deserves.|`|cbOzOUQ2aa	The fact that you're considering continuing a relationship with a man that's emotionally unstable and already seeing another woman, not to mention a married woman, is nuts! Honey, don't wait around until he tells you he doesn't love you. He's telling you in all his actions. As painful as it may be, just walk away and consider yourself the lucky one. If he's willing to be with a woman that's cheating on her husband, I guarantee he will cheat on you too. Cut your losses and move on.

NPSfJoDGaa	I think in most cases men do feel a little bit threatened.  That's just the way men have been raised.  They grow up thinking they need to be the providers of their family.  However, the viewpoints are beginning to change, because more women are taking on careers.  Overall, I think most men would rather see their partners just be happy with whatever decision the wife makes.|`|rSlC9k6xaa	Yep there are some guys out there that be offended if the woman can afford a better pair of shoes or something than he can. And to those guys it does matter simply because they feel that they if they can't provide for their girl, then she will eventually wake up and realize why she is with him in the first place. And with out much of an answer the guy is on the outs and the girlfriend or wife will be looking for someone better. So in all rationality it does make alot of sense for guys to feel threatened in that way. Because we all want to be wanted at some point or other in our lives. And when we aren't we do feel sort of meaningless and unimportant. So saying all that it puts a huge damper on the relationship. Because the boyfriend or hubby will be most unsure of himself because he is not sure when the girlfriend or wife will tell him to hit the curb. I suggest to not talk about work so much with your guy. Just say you make enough to have a alright living if you are dating someone. And if you are married just show that your job allows for enough time to take great vacations or anything other perk with out really bringing the hubby down. Hopefully that helps.

2f6657ccd776ba785212f8ec8607a63eaa	Hola, respondiendo a tu pregunta dejame decirte que no a todas las mujeres solo nos interesa el dinero, efectivamente hay mujeres que creen que el dinero lo es todo en la vida, pero no podemos generalizar.  Habemos mujeres que nos interesa mas la seguridad emocional que la economica.  Con esto no te quiero decir que la estabilidad economica no sea importante, sino que es como cuando dicen que a los hombres solo le importa una cara bonita un cuerpo escultural y la chava calladita.  No a todos les interesa eso y no por uno vamos a juzgar a los demas por lo mismo o medirlos con la misma vara.<br>  <br>  En definitiva, No todas las mujeres interponen el dinero antes que el amor.  Lo que algunas buscamos es estabilidad emocional, un hombre que las haga sentirse seguras que nos trae bien, caballeroso, un hombre que tenga metas que tenga animos y ganas de superacion, y obviamente esto ultimo trae de la mano el dinero, pero no es lo mas importante. el dinero al igual que la belleza y firmeza en el cuerpo, algun día se acaba. Bien dicen que el dinero va y viene no? pero el amor, cuando es verdadero no se puede acabar, si se acaba es que no era real.   <br>  <br>  siento que el verdadero amor nunca es pasajero.<br>  <br>  Espero haber contestado a tu pregunta.  se que opiniones de estas hay muchas y de acuerdo a la persona es lo que piense y lo que opinara, pero lo importante para tí debe ser, que piensas tu y la mujer que quieres. <br>  <br>  Saludos ;)<br>  Linda|`|63RvqTfgaa	Depende con que clase de mujer trates, anos a tras yo trabaje demaciado y mi esposo no trabajaba|`|Ci9Q9lejaa	El $$$ mueve al mundo, esa es la realidad.|`|UofOE74Laa	mmmh en nuestras sociedades se ha dado el caso de mujeres que buscaran a un esposo con mucho dinero, y ellas sin trabajar... en lo personal no creo que sea así, una mujer debe de trabajar también....|`|c3fc6bd2bf2523806cba968bc768e2a3aa	Que tienes razón a las mujeres solo nos interesa el dinero, pero de vez en cuando el amor.|`|isEUViu8aa	yo estoy de acuerdo contigo existe todo tipo de mujeres las que buscan amor, atencion, respeto, etc. y las que buscan solo dinero. yo soy un hombre muy afortunado por que tengo una mujer que realmente me ama y estoy seguro que no esta conmigo por dinero imaginate le regale un automovil del a?o y lo rechazo diciendome que no  me equivocara que ella preferia mi amor, respeto y fidelidad que lo material que yo le pueda dar.|`|uDcQXmneaa	No es lo único que nos interesa pero ayuda mucho...|`|RHux2Fmnaa	Sería como decir que todos los hombres son unos puercos y que solo les interesa ir tras las faldas de todo lo que tenga pulso... No, no es que solo nos interese el dinero, sencillamente es más cómoda la vida si se tiene.  Sabes que una mujer realmente te ama si te conoció en la abundancia y aun cuando pasas por una mala racha, ella se queda contigo a echarte porras, alentarte, te apoya y espera hasta que vuelves a estar en una buena situación económica.  Aparte del amor verdadero, es la fé que ella tiene en tí lo que le obliga a permanecer contigo.  Ahora que si se trata de un holgazán sin objetivo ni ambición alguna en la vida y que no tiene dinero por que no le gusta trabajar, ya esto es completamente diferente; ni voltear a verlo!!|`|33b477c370c4156463ea2d1088db8aa0aa	Con el dinero consigues CASI todo|`|25e784704db1b7b638ddc3ac6cfa7e55aa	Claro que solo buscan el dinero!<br>  <br>  no has oido un dicho que dice:<br>  <br>  Las preocupaciones de un hombre empiezan cuando se casa<br>  <br>  Las preocupaciones de una mujer terminan cuando se casa|`|FgdZ3Skuaa	a algunas mujeres no les interesa el dinero solo las joyas muy caras..............en estos casos billetera mata galán..............|`|Y6PitZDCaa	tu mismo lo has dicho, el dinero ayuda pero no compra el amor. no te negarte que hay de todo en esta vida y hay mujeres y hombres que su motivacion que los mueve a formar pareja o cualquier otro tipo de relacion es el dinero. pero tambien hay personas que eso queda relegado a un segundo plano. para evitar sorpresas desagradables es mejor conocer bien a la persona y tener mucho ojo. chauuuu =)|`|iDwr9or4aa	Sabes en la naturaleza las hembras se sienten atraidas por el macho mas dominante, es decir el mas fuerte, se sabe que los machos para cortejar a la hembra les llevan presas que cazaron para ellas, asi la hembra determina cual de todos los machos merece aparearse con ella, Bueno asi es en la naturaleza, nosotros como seres humanos racionales, ya no utilizamos esa clase de instintos de fuerza, sin embargo la mayoria de las mujeres se sienten atraidas por un hombre con futuro con estabilidad economica que pueda satisfacer sus necesidades, esto es claro no pensando en eso desde el principio es simplemente el instinto de supervivencia, como mujer supondriamos que un hombre economicamente estable seria un buen partido como para ser el padre de tus hijos, y por lo menos supondriamos que no pasarian hambre nuestros bebes, no creo que las mujeres sean interesadas, es simplemente un instinto de estabilidad el cual encontramos en un chico economicamente estable, sin embargo ahora ya no es asi, ahora ya no se fijan tanto en la estabilidad masculina por que buscan su autosuficiente persona, a un que yo por mi parte yo si quiero un hombre a quien darle toda mi admiracion por el hombre importante que sera en mi vida. y sera el mejor de el mundo por el simple hecho de ser el que yo ame y considere como el padre de mis futuros hijos.|`|AcCxuaBbaa	No creo que a todas, en lo personal pienso que el dinero a da?ado a la sociedad uno disfruta muchas cosas en las cuales no necesita dinero.

zDJWpH6Raa	Congrats on your new job! I remember reading about your search, it's nice to have an update.<br>  <br>  I really think it will just take time.  Some people naturally click and other times it just takes time to fit into the team at work.  I wouldn't worry yet as I think that will only make the situation worse.  Give it some time, and best of luck to you!|`|AA12199588	I don't think you should be worried.  Everyone struggles in the beginning no matter what their job is.  The job I have now is complex and you have to be in the job for a year to even feel remotely competent.  We tell new people this but they are usually hard on themselves and think they should catch on and not need help sooner than that.  By you even wondering about how you're doing it shows you want to do a good job and will find your way just fine.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!!

UO62SuR8aa	La infidelidad es una acción provocada por inmadurez, falta de respeto a la pareja, falta de conocimiento de uno mismo. Ciertamente hay ceguera, pero no de la forma en que Manuela lo dice, sino de ambas partes, de quien lo hace por no saber que quiere en la vida y de quien la sufre, por no aceptar que quien es infiel una vez, seguramente lo será siempre. No es parte de la naturaleza humana, es una decisión de cada quien para ejercerla sin pensar en las consecuencias de este acto. Sii quieres probar, hazlo, pero no da?ando a terceros, y si se considera que hay que practicarla para mejorar las relaciones de pareja, eso para mi es e.stupidez. Si no se puede ser fiel a una persona, ?para que comprometerse? mejor brincar de cama en cama sin las ataduras y el compromiso que una relación debe tener.

En general se asocia con la mentira, con el ocultamiento y con el doble discurso, con lo cual conlleva a una conducta de hipocresía. Evidencia también, como se expresó anteriormente por otros foristas, un grado de inmadurez afectiva, o como lo afirma el Dr. Gregorio Mara?ón, un estado en el cual el instinto aún pemanece indiferenciado, no ha completado aún su desarrollo. Quedó en esa primera etapa  de la adolescencia, donde lo que cuenta es el número. Mara?ón desarrolla este pensamiento en el capítulo:<br>  "LA POLIGAMIA COMO MANIFESTACION DEL INSTINTO INDIFERENCIADO" - 3 ensayos sobre vida sexual" -<br>  Hay que reconocer que no son pocas las situaciones en las cuales, el hombre sucumbe a las exigencias del instinto, a la necesidad de variar, y se hace poligamo. Este varon ama entonces en la mujer, al genero y no al individuo. <br>  Cada mujer es aún para él, tan solo una ventana por donde se asoma al   ambito del sexo, y, una vez agotada la vision, correrá a otra ventana hasta que la curiosidad se acaba, lo cual sucedera casi indefectiblemente. <br>  La apetencia del instinto si bien se dirige al sexo contrario, es una apetencia todavía borrosa y dispersa. A medida que esta apetencia se afina y se ennoblece, el sexo, como tal, interesara menos y se busca, en cambio, al individuo, a una mujer que precisamente encaje en las peculiaridades del instinto ya muy especificado del varon. <br>  El progreso sexual  o sea el proceso de desarrollo de nuestra sexualidad, estribaria  en una exaltacion de las cualidades en el hombre, y de las femeninas en la mujer, que entonces se buscarian para complementarse. Podriamos decir que la masculinidad exaltada, como las cumbres muy altas, escapa a las afinidades genericas del sexo femenino, y solo sintoniza, con instintos femeninos tambien proceres de su misma elevación especifica.<br>  Es sorprendente como siendo esto tan claro, ha venido considerandose como arquetipo de virilidad, no el hombre sexualmente diferenciado, que encuentra a la mujer equivalente y cierra con ella el circuito del instinto, sino el tipo de tendencia poligamica, que corre de mujer en mujer, frotando su epidermis con la suya, pero sin penetrar en su arcano espiritual y sexual"<br>  La infidelidad refleja también la la rotura de un vínculo de confianza que debe existir en todo relacionamiento humano. La amistad por ejemplo debe afirmarse en 3 pilares, la empatía, el respeto mutuo y la confianza. Si uno de los 3 pilares no existe, se debilita o se apaga, el vínculo de amistad no prosperará.<br>  Lo mismo sucederá también con el matrimonio o con cualquier otra relación humana, deberá basarse en esos 3 pilares, el afecto, el respeto mutuo y la confianza mutua. La infidelidad atenta contra el respeto y rompe la confianza. <br>  Afecta por tanto valores esenciales del ser humano, y afecta también objetivos preciados, como ser la búsqueda de la felicidad, la búsqueda de la armonía interior, la búsqueda del equilibrio en la vida, y atenta especialmente contra el amor, ese amor que representa el verdadero y más profundo vínculo de afecto, de transferencia de emociones, de complementación, de objetivos comunes, de caminar juntos 2 seres humanos, para  ir transitando juntos por los caminos de la vida, y caminando juntos, hacernos más liviano el camino y más agradable la vida. <br>  Hay un diálogo extraordinario  en La edad de la Inocencia, donde se expone la complejidad y las mortificaciones que en el campo de la conciencia humana plantea la infidelidad: es una escena dentro de una diligencia en la cual  Daniel Day Lewis (casado con la prima de Pfeiffer), le plantea a Michelle Pfeiffer el inicio de un romance y canalizar por vía de una triangulación amorosa el deseo acumulado y contenido de meses: "Quiero irme contigo a algún lugar lejos, donde podamos ser felices... y Pfeiffer le reponde: "como podremos ser felices, si traicionamos a quienes más confían en nosotros... Todo un mensaje, cargado de sabiduría... "como podremos ser felices, si traicionamos a quienes más confían en nosotros". Parece imposible de conseguir la tan ansiada felicidad si transitamos por estos tortuosos caminos de inconsistencia, de contradiciones, de falsedades. <br>  Esto no es un problema nuevo en la humanidad, la infidelidad trasciende los tiempos, desde que el ser humano común se somete a los dictámenes de  sus instintos, que entran en franca lucha contra los dictámenes de la conciencia. Ya lo decía el grandísimo médico y sabio Gregorio Mara?ón en su visita a Montevideo en el a?o 1937 cuando brindó una brillante conferencia llamada: Soledad y Libertad:  El fin de este instinto, es en efecto, la perpetuación de la especie en nuestros hijos, y en el hombre superior, la perduración de su individualidad en la propia obra; pero son muy pocos los hombres capaces de tener el dominio inteligente de sus instintos, es decir de utilizarlo como instrumento de un fin consciente y elevado. Eso que en el lenguaje estúpido de los refranes, se llama, hacer de la necesidad virtud, es justamente los que caracteriza al ser de alta calidad humana.<br>  El instinto es una fuerza ciega, pero el ser superior pone al impulso una meta luminosa y sobre el instinto cabalga hacia esa meta. El ser humano medio, es por el contrario, servidor y a veces, esclavo de los instintos. <br>  También Mara?ón analiza en su libro "3 ensayos sobre vida sexual" en el capítulo de FIDELIDAD Y MONOGAMIA:  “No hay duda que el ideal sexual del hombre normal, deberia ser el amor monogamico. La unica solucion venturosa de la inquietud de los instintos es la pareja unida por el amor. Un hombre puede encontrar su expresión sexual en la solucion poligamica, y el mundo esta lleno de ejemplos de ese genero. Pero ello sera siempre a costa del dolor y de la ignominia de muchas mujeres. Es pues una solucion que solo puede aceptarse con un criterio de egoismo sexual. <br>  La solución monogamica es peculiar al hombre. Y es , por tanto la expresión del grado supremo de la evolucion amorosa. Solo el hombre puede llegar a la monogamia  voluntaria y razonada. Como que para ello se precise una muy delicada operación, que requiere ademas de  condiciones excepcionales en el varon y en la mujer, la conjuncion del instinto con el afecto, que es un sentimiento de complejidad y delicadeza infinita. <br>  Por último, el pensador argentino Carlos B.Gonzalez Pecotche sostiene en su novela psicodinámica "El Se?or de Sándara" , pág.212: Encarar con éxito la gran experiencia del matrimonio supone un cabal conocimiento de la magna arquitectura espiritual que estructura sus bases morales con fórmulas estupendas y reglas sublimes de conducta; fórmulas que ennoblecen el alma de los seres, embellecen el panorama de la vida conyugal, dignifican la especie y abren para los corazones humanos las puertas de la confianza en los designios del sentimiento, tantas veces menospreciado y ultrajado por la incomprensión.<br>  Dos cosas son indispensables para que perdure ese amor fresco y puro que se siente por la amada, sin que se debilite jamás. La primera es el afecto, que, menos impulsivo que la pasión, asegura su arraigo, ya que si bien la pasión infunde vida al amor, el afecto es llamado a preservarlo y conservarlo. La otra, la segunda, tanindispensable como la primera, es nuestra dignificación a los ojos del ser querido. ésta únicamente se logra por medio de los esfuerzos y las preocupaciones por el bienestar de la familia, y alcanza su máxima expresión cuando nos elevamos en superación constante por encima de la vulgaridad.|`|a70c50e63315320c27783f304fe41841aa	La infidelidad es una falta de respeto hacia la otra persona (a la que le pusieron los cuernos), ademas es algo que se puede evitar, con un poco de consciencia, la infidelidad es pues un golpe muy fuerte que se puede prevenirr y cuando se da surgen heridas inborrables.|`|bb9e6ac18f7d569cd56b635be9c66a3aaa	tu preguntas es que hacer,y a la vez que opino sobre la infidelidad,es algo muy difícil de explicar ,pero ser infiel no es normal,que no lo acepte no significa que estoy ciega,y tampoco creo que sea cuestión de ser "mente abierta" traición es traición,y eso no se perdona por que para querer a alguien mas primero te tienes que querer tu mismo y por lo mismo respetarte y cuando ya estas con alguien y por cosas de la vida te enamoraste de otra persona yo pienso que lo mejor es hablar y terminar esa relación ya existente  antes de cualquier cosa,por que yo soy de las que piensa nunca hagas lo que no quieres que te hagan a ti,bueno esa es mi opinión ,saludos y besos para ti Guillermo|`|c3fc6bd2bf2523806cba968bc768e2a3aa	Pues es normal entre hombres y mujeres, no se puede ser fiel a quien no lo es, solo se esta pagando con la misma moneda.|`|tiOnmNgjaa	Mal que aqueja a muchos.

c8a70c26e27453869cec3cd200977d57aa	The answer to your question is simple, by befriending the girls you have casted yourself in the "friendship zone", and most girls don't pick suitors from the "friendship zone", they pick them from the "guys I want to have sex with" zone. If you notice sometimes guys who are, in a nice guy's eyes, bad guys who always get the girls, it's because they never get put into the "friendship zone".<br>  <br>  So what are you doing wrong? You're too much of a nice guy, focus on attraction, not affection.<br>  <br>  --|`|gTR0i9weaa	Well...<br>  <br>  have you actually asked them out?<br>  <br>  Silence holds no mystery... silence just means "..........."<br>  <br>  Or in other words. If you like them, but don't tell them... how are they supposed to know? And if you did tell them, and they don't like you back in that way... well, simple: they don't like you back in that way.<br>  <br>  Not to say that ALL girls won't like you. I mean, there are literally billions of people on this entire planet. That means that there are billions of personal preferences, billions of personalities, and billions of yes's and no's, and rights and wrongs...<br>  <br>  But the beautiful thing about life is that we end up finding a person that we really like/love and are attracted to.<br>  <br>  So just keep on looking... and maybe if you start to develop feelings for a girl, let her know! She's not a mind-reader... and girls are inherently waiting for the guy to make a move.<br>  <br>  And honestly... it's not the end of the world if the feelings aren't reciprocated. Some people like pears, and some don't. <-- I know, stupid way of putting it, but really...<br>  <br>  Just keeping being yourself... and keep your options open... don't worry too much about it... and before you know it, you'll find her.

UPdTjfgxaa	It's guys' fault for not holding out. The guys are just doing whatever the girls want instead of making the same demands. So, you can only blame the men.<br>  <br>  e.g. If men as a group decided not to pay for meals,etc. Things would change. But, we are lazy. :)<br>  <br>  Men can change things if they decide to. They just don't care enough to.<br>  <br>  It's also supply and demand. Luckily, in America and the European countries, there are now more females to males. So things might slowly start changing.|`|twbdRF9Caa	See though, women don't need to compete over men as much and men need to compete over women. Biologically, one man may satisfy many many women, but one woman can only satisfy at the most a few men.

Sometimes even worse. They dont have time to ook after kids during big hunting evening in pubs.|`|QdnH6oyMaa	not really... u cant really stereo type the other.. each one has his/her strengths.. i believe its more of team work... {}|`|nzqEsUoNaa	no not necessarily in most cases women are consider better in parenting because they are more understanding and more compassionate but parenting takes both a males and a female touch, the female in most cases to give sympathy when needed and the male to give them a good kick in the @ss when needed. This is why it takes both a male and a female to make a child. When you say parenting that is too general because there are pros and cons on both sides like the mother may be babying them to much and the father might be to hard on the child but then you have to factor in that it can some times be the opposite because no two people are alike and every parent has their own style of doing it

It is pretty much that way. He emails his friends and might talk to them but he doens't hang out with them alone. When we first started dating I texted him once and he said he had been out with an old friend who was a girl. I didn't say anything at first but it bothered me. A few days later I mentioned it to him and he hasn't hung out with another girl, friend or not, since. I would expect that if I am going to do the same he should, too.|`|baDGTRVbaa	Dancing would not be considered cheating.  I have been to parties with my boyfriend when i would dance with other people.  However, I didn't dance in an inappropriate way that would make my boyfriend uncomfortable.

Would you be able to handle the way she was dancing the same way.|`|c8b48086a110d9bc1d61bb4bca054865aa	It's not cheating but out of respect for your girl I would see if she's cool with it. if not then tell her to come with you and if she won't, who says you have to tell her you were dancing with someone =) It's not like you're kissing the person. I don't like my girl to be grinding up on guys but if she's just dancing that's nothing.|`|rSlC9k6xaa	Yea I say everyone has different tolerance levels where cheating is concerned. Some men and women can't even stand for their partner to look at someone else. Let alone breath the same air. As for dancing with someone else I wouldn't consider it cheating exactly. But trying to rub up and grind on the other person would be a big no, no to me. No deliberate attempts to make me jealous. That would only get you into more trouble.

You want to do the dance of love with me?"<br>  <br>  Never fails.|`|8YhldJteaa	Ask her to dance and if she denies you, say no I think you misunderstood, I said you look ugly in those pants. Or you could say, I just want to thank you, and she'll say for what? For coming out and giving me something to look at. I'm just buggin, be yourself, talk about your night, keep it light, ask her who she's out with and if she's having a good time. If she's interested you'll know b/c she'll continue the conversation. Good luck!!<br>  <br>  <br>  edit, wait till she goes to the bar and talk to her there ask her if it is ok if you by her drink for her. Or if she's with her friends in a group ask her to dance, brings her out of the 'friend zone' letting both of you be yourselves. Before you go over though glance over at her a few times (not creepy like lol), make eye contact before approaching her, if she smiles, you know she's approachable. wait about 5-10 minutes (or until a good song) to go over and ask her to shake her money maker, I mean dance.|`|F5mqM7TIaa	Grow a few inches taller and work out a lot.  Even though girls don't always admit it, these things are the most importat to them.  The other important thing is money, so if you are looking for a shallow loser then show that you have a lot of money.  I would advise against the latter, because these girls are worthless.|`|LRUrasBbaa	I always like for a guy to be open with me and not feed me a line,woman know that most men are looking to find someone to pick up.So just go up and pay her a complement,if you are having eye contact then you must see something that look good.<br>  Try it and you will see|`|sQv15uDeaa	OK first, I actually got a great idea from a really hot Australian on this site, he suggested just approaching a girl and saying " you are stunning" use your own words, what makes you feel comfortable and then he just walks off.  That is mysterious and very sexy and 99% of the time, the girl will try and find you.<br>  <br>  You can always approach the lady in question and speak to her like you would to someone you're familiar with, whats the worst thing that can happen, she might not be interested, you just move on to the next.  You could go up to her and ask if she's enjoyinh herself, she will answer it would be rude not to, and then say look I saw from over the room and couldn't look away so I thought I'd offer to buy you a drink?<br>  <br>  If a girl is giving eye contact back then you're nearly there already, if we wern't interested she would have looked away instantly.  Good luck and have safe sex ;D|`|oelI7Isiaa	ok being a girl this will hopefully help:<br>   The eye contact thing is really good, and as far as that next step goes is all in you.<br>     If you're in a club for instance, eye contact is good, but confidence is better. Just go up and dance with the chick. if she walks away, then you can do SO much better because she is probably really stuck up anyway.<br>      Anywhere else you just have to be smooth. ask about a purchase she's making, or if she is at that place alot, or if she has an interest that pertains to where you are.<br>      Quite simple. No need to be the master pick up artist, just be yourself. that's the most attractive thing you can be.

If she just asked him if he'd mind i dont think that's a reason to break up.  She was giving her condolences.  I dont think it's a reason to break up at all.

o7W1mZfyaa	UNA  HISTORIA  PARECIDA<br>  <br>  Hola, Luisa.<br>  <br>  Es normal que le cueste asimilarlo. Me estoy viendo ahora en la misma situación, hace un a?o... pero no en tu lugar, sino en el de él. Quien se declaró fue él; a mi me había gustado hace tiempo, pero pasé del tema porque pensé que no tenía ninguna posibilidad, y ni lo intenté. Entonces, el a?o pasado, cuando me dijo que yo le gustaba mucho y se moría por salir conmigo, yo me quedé bloqueadísima. Claro... ?no me lo esperaba! Me pilló en un mal momento de mi vida, y le vi tan convencido, tan sincero, y tan calado por mí, que temí hacerle da?o. Le confesé que hace a?os a mí me gustaba bastante, pero que en ese momento me quedaba grande todo lo que me estaba diciendo...  Durante el siguiente mes y medio, él seguía pendiente de mí, me preguntaba qué tal me iban mis exámenes, me escribía algún sms... Después de exámenes, nos volvimos a ver, con más amigos... Y en el fin de semana, no paré de pensar en él. Me di cuenta, ya más relaja y tras un poco de tiempo, de que la llama que un día ardió, aún no se había apagado... <br>  <br>  Llevamos casi un a?o juntos. Tengo 24 a?os, y es mi primera relación formal. Y espero que sea la última...<br>  <br>  Te deseo que las cosas os salgan tan bien como a nosotros. Ten paciencia, dale tiempo. Deja que lo asimile y que busque en su interior... Un saludo.<br>  <br>  ..|`|NiXeXkUyaa	creo que en ningun sentido debes sentir que has hecho algo mal. No tiene nada de malo sentir lo que sientes ni que el lo sepa. Creo que està impactado y creo que es natural, sobre todo cuando crees que conoces del todo a alguien y resulta que habìa una parte que no sabias. Creo que lo mejor es darle algo de espacio para que ponga en claro su cabeza y sentimientos, de lo contrario se alejara de ti|`|R0QD81JUaa	?Hummmmmmmmmmmmm! Me parece que metiste la pata hasta el cuello! Cuando uno se declara, siempre pierde...|`|RmAcL91Oaa	El tiempo, cuando el amor es verdadero, no es una barrera. Después de los 2 días de la conversación ?Has tocado el tema nuevamente? No, ?por qué? Deja tus temores a un lado y hasle frente nuevamente. Nada se pierde. Como dice una canción de Silvio: "La cobardía es asunto de los hombres no de los amantes..."|`|V88Nckwgaa	Si se esta haciendo el loco es porque talvez no quiera perder la amistad, puede sentir algo hacia ti, pero como existe la proabilidad de fracaso prefiere no arriesgar la amistad. Puede ser algo excelente tener una relacion con alguien con la que has sido amigo por mucho tiempo, porque una buena relacion se basa mas que todo en la amistad y la comprension que existe en la pareja, pero como te dije, es terreno peligroso y hay mucho que arriesgar.|`|bqEszP9Baa	Yo tengo el mismo problema con el tiempo y las cosas.<br>  Si esperaste 5 a?os para decir algo tan importante, crees poder esperar un par de días para la respuesta. Yo creo que sí. <br>  Fuerzas con eso. Y pienso que quien ama, espera.<br>  Saludos y Suerte|`|c3fc6bd2bf2523806cba968bc768e2a3aa	Yo pienso que lo espantaste, tal vez el solo te aprecia como amigo y ahora que le declaraste tu amor se espanto.|`|lSMQlY2caa	Da por hecho que sí te quiere, pero no te ama. Así que no presiones, nada pero no me refiero con que le saques el tema a menudo solamente. Es decir, no te pongas triste y melancólica a su lado, pues notará que es por eso y se querrá alejar.

Lo que yo pienso es que no fueron claros al hablar sobre el estilo de vida que querían llevar juntos créeme muchos no lo hacen y piensan que no es sino vivir el día a dia, por lo que le apuestan a la vida (sobretodo las mujeres son las que más pecan en ello) a que lo van a poder con todo!. <br>  <br>  Habla bien las cosas con él depronto es que no le gusta mucho el olor de lo ali?os que te queda impregnado en el cabello y cuerpo en general ponte gorro de cocinero no de chef en fin, o tal véz es que no le dedicas mucho tiempo como pareja porque estás muy cansada u ocupada en los oficios y eso tiene que ver mucho tambien, aunque él no lo hable con vos. La cocina por ejemplo quita muchísimo tiempo, haga un curso de alimentos para congelar se aprovechan mejor los nutrientes y quita la mitad del tiempo en preparación d elo contario para comércelos frescos tendrías que tener una huerta.<br>  <br>  En cuanto al ni?o si tiene 2 en adelante debes ense?arle que haga tareas de la casa de manera divertida con canciones por ejemplo(sin abusar por favor, así sea limpiar una baldosa pero compartes con él, además de que le ense?as una lección de vida sana llena de valores para que no se encajone dentro de modelos machista y feministas simplemente sea una persona activa y colaboradora).<br>  Así se te hace mas agradable los días con menos estrés y puedas disfrutar el tiempo que le dedicas a tu bebé, por más mamá y esposa que seas seguís siendo un persona que tiene derecho a vivir digamente y a divertirse, <br>  <br>  Si depronto es eso y quieres seguir como has venido haciendo hasta ahora solo tenés que aprender a solucionar con conocimiento como no especificas  lo que él te dice entonces no te puedo decir más.|`|kq9QzP2Iaa	mas bien cuando ya no tenga chacha y lo tenga que hacer él entonces verá lo que ha perdido|`|5POhDeuQaa	Pues igual y le ayuda el castigo pero no es una regla, asi que la desicion la tomas tu.<br>  Saludos!!!!!!|`|8GaUXpcraa	no se, pero si lo dejas te doy una mano o dos pa que te desestreses y pienses bien lo que vas a hacer, jeje. 91....<br>  <br>  y mientras esperas mas respuestas, ?por qué no te pasas por esta pagina? mas que nada por reirte un rato. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.palimpalem.com/5/elguason/" rel="nofollow">http://www.palimpalem.com/5/elguason/</a><br>  <br>  elguason|`|AA10528727	SI!|`|EKgBeJiSaa	hola<br>  El problema es que sois muy jóvenes los dos, y sobretodo él porque se ve demasiado comprometido, a su edad, y lo que le gustaría hacer es volar.<br>  Si tu criterio te dice que lo dejes por un tiempo hazlo, para que medite cuál es su lugar para con vosotros, pues a veces hace falta un lapsus, porque todo el mundo necesita su espacio.<br>  <br>  un beso <br>  reikimass|`|VhPH5mvPaa	No, mejor platica con el expresale lo que sientes no llegues a extremos,dile que no eres su mama ni su sirvienta, que recuerde que es a la persona que ama.|`|s3215hqMaa	Hola...la mejor forma de solucionar el problema de ustedes es comunicándose, porque si te alejas de él, tal vez no te guste el resultado, a lo mejor sería féliz si se aleja de ti, o puede resultar que él te empiece a extra?ar, pues esta acostumbrado a ver a su esposa y a su hijito, y creeme que asi no se valora a nadie;  la idea es que hablen de lo que les gusta o no de la relación de ambos, y empiecen a trabajar en eso para corregirlo, las personas no cambian pero si se corriguen en gran medida de sus deseos. Suerte!!|`|t7DlZ9XEaa	estan muy chavitos los dos y mucha responsabilidad, mira  alas mujeres no nos cuesta trabajo por que somos muy maduras pero los hombres no, la vdd lo que creo es que si deberias darte un tiempo tu pero mas que para dare una leccion a el, hazlo por ti, no eres chacha de nadie, eso ya no va, los dos deben cooperar en la casa y con el ni?o. Mejor trabaja y busca superarte no te ates a alguien inmaduro ni te conviertas en la sirvienta, pk al rat te va a dejar por cualquier chamaquita y ya vas a ser mas grande, mejor desde ahora toma tu las riendas de tu vida y la de tu hijo y si el te ma reaccionara si no a volar paloma que sanganos inmaduros en cualquier esquina|`|1332149b4946a917e7101e484fd7f519aa	mira el separarte no soluciona el problema loq ue tienes que hacer es que èl hjaga las cosas de la casa si se casaron no fue pra que tu esposo tenga empleada porque si es asi para eso se paga tu eres su compa?era y te aconsejo que te ayude èl si te sientes mal de salud obviamente tu esposo tiene que ver a tu hijo y hacer las cosas yo estuve mal de salud con una infecciòn bien fuerte y mi esposo tuvo que hacer todo por 4 dias suficiente para que se de cuente de lo que valgo ahora anda a verlo como me trata y me valora me ayuda y hasta me ayuda con mi hijal. suerte|`|Asv5P7dNaa	Eres su esposa, no su sirvienta ni su madre. Si él te ve así, estás mal. <br>  Piensa más cómo amante, con lo que describes suenas a tercera edad.<br>  <br>  Con 19 a?os deberías ser una mujer linda y divertida; elegiste renunciar a un montón de cosas por construir un hogar, pero no renuncies a tu juventud, a tu dignidad y a tu amor propio. <br>  <br>  Las mujeres maduramos antes, pero hay seres que tardan muuuuuuuuuuucho y algunos pocos no lo hacen.<br>  <br>  Nótalo y actúa en consecuencia: Por tener vida, tienes el deber contigo misma de SER FELIZ por tus medios. El amor real te protege y te promueve, nunca lo olvides tanto para dar como para recibir amor, no recibas desperdicios, no recibas "no amor".<br>   <br>  Y recuerda que nadie debe ni puede quererte y respetarte más que tú (Si eso ocurre corre a terapia, que CONTIGO vas a vivir toda tu vida). Tu actitud incita o corta las inmadureces de tu pareja.<br>  <br>  Suerte!|`|TLIiEQVeaa	hola amiga,si es cierto que cuando ves lo que tienes fuera de tu alcance lo empiezas a valorar,no es mala idea hacerlo, pero primero tienes que hablar con él y decirle lo que sientes y necesitas hacer para que él reaccione ,están muy jóvenes y tiene un hijo debe valorarlos y batallar un poco has por plancharse y lavarse, para que vea que es horrible estar solo y que nadie se preocupe por él ,dile que lo quieres mucho y que es por el bien de su familia.mucha suerte.|`|W0Tdz0x2aa	Puede que sea cierta la frase, pero de verdad quieres que se de cuenta de lo que ha perdido cuando tenga que hacerse la comida él solo, plancharse su propia ropa, limpiarse la casa, ... ?de verdad quieres que sea eso lo que eche de menos de ti? ?Tener una criada? Creo que no te valoras lo suficiente si verdaderamente crees que eso es lo único que puedes ofrecerle a un hombre. Además, si no lo haces tu, lo más probable es que se lo haga su madre, u otra persona, así que no te echará de menos.<br>  Piensa en las cosas que le aportas a él como persona, dejando de lado que le hagas las tareas del hogar, y deja de dárselas, a ver como reacciona. Si ni así reacciona, olvídate de él, no te ama, quiere una asistenta, y estoy segura que tu puedes aspirar a mucho más, eres joven y tienes toda la vida por delante, puedes compartirla con alguien que te valore mucho más.|`|ZAexFFQPaa	aslo pensar pero no se dejen sin probar de arreglar todo,|`|c3fc6bd2bf2523806cba968bc768e2a3aa	Intentalo y a ver que pasa, ojala funcione el truco.|`|e235a831ab0349d1374e4635037879e4aa	Mejor habla con el creo que eso seria mejor antes de que tomes una decisión tan drástica.|`|gF7zUf44aa	me pare una buenicima idea mucha suerte ya veras q el te va a volarar despues de esto suerteeeeeeee...|`|l0bVbbe6aa	Lo que deberias es quitarse ese pensamiento tan equivocado y negativo  de creer que tu valor como mujer esta en que "planchas" "lavas" "cocinas" etc... osea que si no supieras eso? que?<br>  Valdrias menos que una cucaracha?<br>  Todo ser humano tiene un valor innato, por el hecho de existir simplemente, y vales como persona por quien eres tu, con tus virtudes y defectos y quien te ame lo hara ,tal como eres sin cambiarte nada .<br>  <br>  Mira lo que estas haciendo es tomando el papel de Madre de tu joven marido , a los 19, no se es muy maduro, y si alguno de los dos si, en este caso eres tu, ya tienes la mentalidad de afrontar lo que estas viviendo, pero por lo visto él no, asi que habla con el, se muy honesta y dejale muy claro que tu no te casaste para ser muchacha del servicio, con gusto haces las cosas, pero ves que el , tomo el papel mas facil, el de recostarse, sin aportar nada, y tu no estas para criar a dos ni?os, si el no madura y asume de verdad lo que ambos tienen ahora, es mejor que cada uno haga su vida, por aparte, tu necesitas saber que estas con un hombre de verdad, no con un adolescente que no sabe a donde va, tu tambien tienes 19  y tuviste que renunciar a muchas cosas , que a tu edad son normales, porque tu vida cambio, el debe asumir la misma responsabilidad, sino puede , entonces su lugar esta lejos de ti.<br>  Suerte|`|mJFWEqBXaa	Hi amiguita mira yo no tengo ningun compromiso pero en realidad los hombres son torpes en verad esta muy bien dicgo eso de que no saben lo que tienen hasta que lo pierden yo creo que alguien le esta calentando el cerebro y es por eso que no te valora y si creo que deberían darce un tiempo para que tanto el como tu recapaciten y piensen que es lo que realmente quieren de esa relacion un hijo no ata a nadie a estar a su lado y si lo amas lo mejor en una relacion es la comunicacion habla con el y exponle cual es tu criterio que es lo que piensas y lo que te molesta de el si se enoja por decirle la verdad no te sientas mal ya se le pasara y veras que despues el recapacitara y solito se dara cuenta de lo mal que se esta comportando contigo......eso es todo en cuanto te puedo aconsejar mucha suerte.|`|tm8R2bmXaa	si no te valora para que lo quieres a tu lado, estan muy chamacos, yo creo que es por la edad hay que darse tiempo y no desesperar|`|wAkOzztnaa	Tal vez si amiga es cierto... pero la verdad es que la mayoría de los hombres no no valoran y eso ya es hasta amargarnos nosotras el estar esperando que agradezcan algo de lo tanto que hacemos pero bueno... debieras tratar de hablar con el hacerle saber lo mucho que haces con amor y ddicación para que esten bien como pareja y familia, o tal vez debieras de dejar de hacer algunas de las cosas que le gasta encontrar listas pues para que que vea que si tu no mueves un dedo nadie mas lo hara y pues que tambien mereces que te lo aprecie... nop?
