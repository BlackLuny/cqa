It's particularly nasty and I have heard, can develop very rapidly.<br>  <br>  Very sorry about your daughter-in-law.<br>  <br>  As a breast cancer survivor, I do my own self-exams about 8 times a day. Ok, not quite that much, but a lot.|`|d456069f8e03a8bf7a79de76c7e45228aa	Sorry about your daughter in law . . that is a rare type of breast cancer and I agree with doing the self breast exams .. but I think it needs to go further than that. All young adults and parents of teens and children need to learn what to look for in cancer of the young. There are certain types of cancers that affect this age group and parents should learn about them. <br>  <br>  Everyone needs to learn to examine their entire body for any unexplained, painless lump or bump located anywhere on the body that seems to be growing. Any lump over 2cm that seems to increase in size should be checked out.  And not just visible lumps or bumps, but if you press around your body and find something you can't explain . . you should become aware. I still have nightmares from when my son asked me what this hard lump was inside his abdomen . . and I said I didn't know .. who would have known it was cancer. If I had only reacted and had the doctor look at it right than . . maybe he would still be here today.<br>  <br>  Anyway, I think everyone should learn how to do self exams of the entire body.
8gnp5Kkjaa	I have always had trouble falling asleep.  My wife can go to bed and be asleep in ten minutes tops.  Sometimes it takes me over an hour.  It sounds like you are getting plenty of sleep every night so I don't think going to bed earlier would really be a solution.<br>  <br>  Recently (during the past three weeks) something that has helped me fall asleep faster is exercise.  I started doing 20 minutes every day on an elliptical machine.  Now I seem to fall asleep a bit faster, although it still takes about 20 or 30 minutes, and it is easier for me to wake up in the morning as well, which is something else I've had problems doing in the past.  Which to me indicates that I am sleeping more soundly and am not tired when I wake up as a result.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure if you exercise currently but if you cannot figure something out it might be worth considering.  Personally, I would rather do that than take a pill.|`|gUMHWrjMaa	welll.. <br>  1. make sure you have an active time throughout the day.<br>  2. you need to relax for perhaps more than 10minutes before going to bed if possible, stop doing anything that might be mentally exciting up to an hour/30mins before you go to bed so you can relax fully before you try and get to sleep.<br>  3. In conunction with number 2, write down anything you need to do the next day on a bit of paper so you are not worrying about it while you try and sleep.<br>  4. make sure, if possible, your room is "comfortable" i.e you minimise noise from the outside if possible/this helps and that your room is warm/cool, whichever helps you sleep.|`|KSIkMTknaa	I have struggled with falling asleep for decades/<br>  there are a few things I noticed that help.<br>  <br>  Don't drink caffeinated  beverages after 12:00<br>  <br>  I spray my bedsheets with Lavender  scents From Bath and Body.

l42UDjFGaa	I was just talking about this (re: the varying range of normal body temperatures) with my supervisor at my practicum and one of the doctors walked over during our conversation. He said that when you're in the range below 100 degrees, your body temperature can vary up and down (resting rate, morning, evening, following exercise, when menstruating, etc.) when absolutely nothing is wrong with you. Even though 98.6 is the standard, it was derived from a range of "within normal limits" body temperatures gathered from 100's of people. I often run low, like 97.9 in the morning and heat up at night, when there's nothing wrong with me. We can also heat up a bit when we eat bigger meals. The only time I would worry is if you don't feel well or there's any other 'symptom' that concerns you and you haven't had a CBC run in a while. If you're progressively creeping up in temp at night, swing by a Patient First - they're very affordable (more affordable than my PCP anyway) and I've had good luck there. I personally think that women's hormones often wreak a bit of havoc on temps. I blame a lot on hormones though. LOL. <br>  <br>  There are so many different reactions our body's have to stress...I don't see why temp would be any different. Before you get too paranoid ( I only say that because I tend to get paranoid :), remember it's only .4 above the "average"!|`|PNlEkz6gaa	i dont know what kind of work you do but if its physically heavy i think its just your skin heat that warmed up your core heat of your body will still be the same but youl probably cool down a few minutes later so no worries . :)|`|p2pE0Fpwaa	You may have a low grade infection. See your DR for a blood work up.|`|IMPvzBk1aa	I'm posting a link on FUO (fever of unknown origin) for you to look at.  However, in my experience, a body temperature of 99 F is not considered to be abnormal unless the normal resting temperature in a given individual is very low.  As the day progresses, metabolic processes that generate energy also generate body heat, so that your body temperature is higher in the afternoon than it is in the morning.  i think you are just normal.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.healthline.com/galecontent/fever-of-unknown-origin" rel="nofollow">http://www.healthline.com/galecontent/fe...</a>|`|jtjISk6qaa	your temp fluctuates throughout the day

rMk4jKNBaa	You can do all of these things<br>  Mix 1/2 teaspoon of cream of tarter (spice) with a cup of water and drink it. Drink lots of water. Drink cranberry juice. Take garlic. Take D-Mannose (a powder stuff that you get from the health food store. This is my favorite) <br>  Take something for your constipation. (My mother said nearly every patient she has treated for UTI is contipated!) <br>  Drink LOTS of water and juice. (no juice with sugar or carbination.)<br>  Another thing.

From my experience, I know how ridiculously painful they are. The only thing you can do is take the prescription pills and painkillers, while drinking as much cranberry juice as humanly possible.<br>  <br>  REAL cranberry juice - no cocktail crap. It won't cure it, but it will definitely aide and improve the process, while circulating the prescription pills faster and allowing you to urinate. Also, heads up, once you get a UTI once or twice, they can reoccur a couple times a year (which is why I know anything about them). hope this helps ya.|`|yJ31VS79aa	Cranberries. Real juice. But you've already heard that.<br>  It comes in cranberry pills too you can get them at your local drug store.|`|pa7hVLAHaa	Symptoms of UTI  typically resolve after short course of antibiotic treatment (3 days); if symptoms persist, this suggests improper antibiotic selection, and therefore a more thorough history and physical examination should be performed to find the cause.  If it is an upper tract infection it may require a longer course of antibiotic therapy.  If the cause is more serious, then the proper treatment should be administered.  <br>  <br>  Since you posted in alternative medicine I'll give you some suggestions of herbs that may help with UTIs.<br>  <br>  Bearberry, Uva ursi:<br>  It is a diuretic (makes you pee more), antimicrobial and astringent.  It is indicated for acute UTIs due to E. coli and other gram negative bacteria.  I recommend an alcohol extraction tincture.  Use only short-term.<br>  <br>  Dandelion: (leaf)<br>  It is a strong diuretic, nutriative, and slightly astringent.  It is indicated for UTIs and urinary tract toxicities.  You can buy these at the grocery store in the produce section though they are very bitter.<br>  <br>  Cranberry juice:<br>  Sugar free 100% cranberry juice has been known to help with UTIs.  Simply put, one of the constituents in cranberry juice inhibits the bacteria from sticking to the inside walls of the urinary tract which helps to flush them out.
AA11522944	It's true.... most guys like porn and look at it whether they are in a relationship or not.<br>  <br>  Try not to be hurt because he is not having a 'relationship' with the girls in the porn.

9yPEjN4Xaa	If you have herpes you could have gotten it years ago. Symptoms can be dormant for a very long time, sometimes may never even show but you would still be a carrier and able to pass it on. <br>  <br>  Were you sexually active with someone else before you were married? Was you husband? He may have had it before you two got together and passed it on without knowing. <br>  <br>  I know it can feel like you are "damaged goods". All you can do is try and relax and wait for the results of the test. You're husband believing you that you didn't do anything outside the relationship is all on him.<br>  <br>  I don't think you can get it from someone urinating on you since it's like passing on a cold sore. Someone has to have a sore and have contact with your skin in order to give it to you.<br>  <br>  If it is herpes there are medications to shorten the length of a break out. It is also possible for the virus to leave your body though for the most part it does tend to stay in the body indefinitely but outbreaks also tend to lessen and are much less severe the longer you have it.<br>  <br>  You can also get herpes if there was contact to your genitals from someone who had a sore on their mouth. <br>  <br>  It could be other things too. What you call a blister could be something else. Folliculitus, polyps, warts, skin tags. <br>  <br>  Whatever it is, try and take a deep breath and think of what you would need to do next. If it means your life changes, then your life changes. You can still live a long and happy life. <br>  <br>  Don't feel like you are "dirty" or damaged. If your relationship changes because of it seek find someone close to you who you can confide in. Someone who will make you feel good about yourself no matter what. Even seek therapy. <br>  <br>  As for discussing the results with you husband, just keep telling him you were never unfaithful, understand his confusion and that you would most likely have the same reaction. He swears he wasn't with anyone else, believe him. If you have no proof otherwise you can't accuse him. If there is a different truth it will come out eventually. If you trust him, it will be easier for him to trust you. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|eRrKz3WHaa	i wouldnt have sex w/ you husband<br>  just because if you have something that you can spread to him<br>  if its spreadable to him then he gets it and he wasnt doing anything w/ anyone else..he would figure out you gave it to him and you havent had it before|`|Qvql4KGLaa	ok, my concern is that you said A FRIEND tried to RAPE you.

What a horrible situation!|`|1oNi2v38aa	He pissed on you?|`|72c3b924e93e85f5493bc3f07051afb4aa	Even as a doctor I cannot fully diagnose this without actually examining the blisters in person.<br>  <br>  Folliculitis doesn't usually appear in blisters, but rather appears in white-headed pimples near hair follicles, so I personally would have ruled that out.<br>  <br>  Without the blood work I can only speculate.  It could be a number of possibilities, but my top two would be herpes or shingles (herpes zoster).<br>  <br>  Even with no previous symptoms a person could have herpes and never know it, but it's quite unlikely as many factors usually lead to outbreaks such as stress.  Women usually feel flu-like symptoms during their outbreaks as well, such as fever and headaches.<br>  <br>  The blood test will be your answer.  Best of luck to you.<br>  <br>  PS.  Many people are saying hemorrhoids, and I find that pretty easy to diagnose. Hemorrhoids are merely swelling of the veins near the anal canal usually caused by pressure or straining.  They really never result in blistering, but external hemorrhoids usually bleed and are painful to the touch.|`|GoABmevnaa	It COULD be an STD, but it sounds more like hemorrhoids.

Use a hydrocortisone cream on it and if it is not improving in a day then that is not it. Herpes can be caught if he had an outbreak and just touched you with his penis.

Thats not good for your teeth or you.<br>  I used to be like that except, i used laxatives. but you just have to get over it.  and i used to think exersice sucked but it has a good after feeling.  and it gives you tone.  just don't eat a pizza and three tacos in the first place.  Before you take the first bites think ahead 10 minutes.  also, eating healthy makes you feel better.  If your parents don't know, your gona have to tell them because when you get really sick they're gonna know.|`|XgbIJkcmaa	I have experienced the same thing. and yes you are becoming ballemic.<br>  I wasn't able to go to the bathroom for 2 month's so everytime I ate I would throw it up all of it. and even when I was able to go again, for some reason I couldn't control myself and threw up several time's after that the process lasted a while and it destroyed my throat so I told myself that this isn't good and everytime I felt like I wanted to throw up I waited a couple hours purposly so the food was so digested that it turned more acid like so if I did it would burn my throat. and it worked I don't do it anymore.<br>  <br>  But see here's what's happening to you, your body will start eating more because it know's your going to throw up again so it's trying to store more food, and after you do eat you feel self-consciouse about it and yourself, so start eating less and you will feel less self-consciouse about it then you might be able to control it with time.<br>  <br>  I hoped I helped and I hope you overcome it. :D|`|enNFDXqSaa	That is bulimia. You need help. Bulimia is very serious and binging and purging can cause heart attacks, issues with fertility later in life, and can really ruin your esophagus. Even if you stopped making yourself throw up, fasting and excessive exercise are forms of eating disorders as well. I don't want to tell you that you can't change this on your own, but you should confide in a friend or a school counselor so you can get this under control while there is still hope. You do not want to continue with this, it will ruin your life if you don't stop it now.|`|jgFd1df7aa	Your already bulimic darling,<br>  <br>  I'm sorry, you know it's wrong so please please please ask for hellp, tell a therapist, go 2 a doctor , please <br>  <br>  It's for yur own benefit & yu will regret it if yu don't get help while yo u still have control of the situation <br>  <br>  Fx|`|xFgXny0paa	yeah sory u r bulimic, i know how difficult it is<br>  go see a doctor and try to get some help|`|7fdeTRhPaa	Umm..Becoming bulimic? Are you serious?<br>  <br>  You ARE bulimic.|`|bBRsQaRWaa	When you started forcing yourself to throw up you became bulimic. You need to see a doctor before you hurt yourself, or even end up killing yourself.
H2bFiDNAaa	Acne cleansers don't really help, especcially if u have fair skin. i do and my skin  gets red and irritated every time. try using more natural substances like olive oil. and if you're going to use soap, beware that some soaps have substances that will make your skin very dry.|`|AA11513843	I'm 19 to and have notice that, i stopped using it along time ago and started washing my face with dove soap and i hardly ever have pimples.|`|sDfBDXpXaa	Acne medications are full of harmful substances.

JERUmEFzaa	I have been using tampons for a year and I`ll never go back to pads. The precautions you need to be careful of is TSS ( Toxic Shock Syndrome) That happens when you leave it inside too long when your flow is heavy. If it`s light you can wear it up to 7 hours but take it out when you need to. When a tampon is full when you start to feel a little bit of wetness down their or it starts sliding out a bit. I suggest you get Playtex gentle glide for beginners. Or Tampax pearl. Because plastic is easier to put in and the cardboard hurts a lot. If your flow is heavy always wear a maxi-pad just in case it leaks. And when you go on your trip bring both tampons, pads and wipes. <br>  <br>  When you put put the tampon in wrong you will feel a discomfort. If you have to pull it out just pull gently and keep doing that. If it hurts too much get a water bottle and pour some on your lady part ( LOL!) so it will come out easier. It is not dangerous to put it in when you don`t have alot of blood because it`s easier to go through the day. <br>  <br>  <br>  Like I said before you can wear a tampon up to 7 hours when it`s light.     When you wear tampons it will be more comfortable when you go to the roller coasters and such.<br>  <br>  Good Luck Megan!|`|hTF678c0aa	wel from wat i learned if its like the begging part u should its safe<br>  mine last's for 3 days so here wat i do:<br>  day1&2: tampon<br>  day 3: i would normally wear one and the day after it ends just in case i wear a lining<br>  but ya when you wear one you can do so much more without worryin just chang them every 3-5 hours if there the really small ones<br>  have in florida and right now its bright and sunny here so should be a good time!!|`|sqW4uRqdaa	Just remember to change it every two hours.<br>  That's all you really need to know.<br>  Hope this helps.<br>  <3 Laura|`|KCKcoEyqaa	i'm 14 too and i can tell you it is really useful expecilly for sports and rollar costers( lucky)  heres what i can tell you. dont put it in if you dont have too much blood because it will just be more difficult to get out, definitely take it out before 8 hours and it is ok if you use your friend's and you shouldnt even feel it, and there is no way it can get lost inside of you! NO WAY impossible. because you have a thing called a cervix that only a pencil if that can get in. <br>  <br>  have fun in orlando, lucky duck|`|3bysSXBZaa	You can wear tampons yeah, but you have to be careful when you first use them. As you say yours is rather light it is fine as you don't have a heavy flow so you won't need to change that often. But check every so often, about every two hours (as it says before ^). Remember though do not wear them at night as it will be too long and can cause infections. It will be fine to wear them though.:) x|`|BRFkc8pBaa	There completely safe. Yeah there's a lot of hoopla concerning TSS but it'll be fine unless you wait like two days to take it out or something. Change them like every 4 to 6 hours. It doesn't matter how heavy/light your period is. I've always used tampons, I hate pads. Eww. You'll enjoy them 50x more. There much more hassle free. Personally I like the ones with plastic applicators, like pearl and such. There a lot easier to put in.|`|GGjjtHmHaa	well, if your not very moist down there talk to your mother about using some form of lubrication. it sounds kind of weird and it may be hard to talk about but it's better to think about in the long run...change it every 2 hours if you can. and read the box!|`|6NA2MXNPaa	Check out the website I'm attaching. It's an awesome site that can answer every reproduction, menstruation, sex question you could ever have. If you're trying tampons for the first time, I wouldn't do it while you're away from home and on some trip. You should get comfortable with them first so you know what to expect. The most important thing to remember is to change them frequently. Don't leave a tampon in for any longer than 4 hours. There's a risk of getting TSS (Toxic Shock Syndrome) if you leave it in too long. There's a pamphlet about TSS in every box of tampons that you buy, read it. Personally, I use tampons during the day and overnight maxi pads at night. Tampons are easy to use and quite comfortable, you generally can't tell they're even there. The first time you use them you may want to use a panty liner with them. Use the smallest tampon you can. If your flow is kind of light, use a regular tampon. If it's slightly heavier or moderate, use a super tampon. You should avoid super plus tampons unless your period is really heavy. And no matter what, always change it at least every 4 hours. If you have a regular tampon in, and after 2 hours you start getting leaking on your underpants, then you know that your period is a little heavier and that you could go up to a super tampon. You'll figure it out after using them a few times which ones work best for you. I'd like to suggest using the plastic applicator tampons though. There are 3 different applicator type tampons. There's the cardboard applicator, which is very uncomfortable to insert if you ask me. There's the plastic applicator, which is smooth and just slides in. Then there's the tampon that doesn't have an applicator (OB tampons), you use your finger to insert them. Just try different ones and see what works best for you! Good luck! Have fun in Orlando!|`|1yGDFTieaa	Never leave a tampon in for more than 6 hours, 8 at the absolute maximum.<br>  <br>  Personally I like to 'double up', use a tampon and then wear a thin pad as well. A tampon has never leaked, I just feel more 'secure' that way, it's something you could do if you wish to.<br>  <br>  There's not really any other precautions except changing it after 8 hours.<br>  <br>  If the tampon still has white patches when you take it out, you need to switch to a lower absorbency tampon.<br>  <br>  Enjoy your trip!
GXnfJfU8aa	I went through the same exact thing. It honestly and truly is the best option to tell her.<br>  Just go up to her and say "Mom, I think I got my period."  My mom was surprisingly relaxed and even had stuff that she had prepared just for the occasion.<br>  And it was the night before my first sleep away camp so that sucked even more :)<br>  <br>  She's going to figure out anyway, either from the dirty undies or pads/tampons in the garbage. It'll be even more awkward then|`|UzmfIaYiaa	i kno how ya feel. i havent told my mom and i have gotten mine for a year. its just a little hard during the summer. if you dont feel comfortable telling her (like me ) then just go into the bathroom and take a few pads. <br>  <br>  good luck!!|`|dywC7NTKaa	Awww, just tell her.<br>  Dont worry, it's your period.<br>  Tell your mom, is nothing to be nervous, embarrassed about.|`|M20ikmBUaa	tell her, so she can tell you all the steps.|`|4nD0833laa	YOU HAVE TO TELL HER!!|`|ozATw7s0aa	Omg, same with me.

ZaLrtSd7aa	It doesn't rule out bipolar, it sounds like it rules in bipolar. Probably bipolar, more manic type. Unable to figure out if you also have ADD until you get the main problem under control, but it sounds more like mania. Other phobias may also improve with control of anxiety/mania. See your doc - counseling may not available but you'd likely benefit from medication seeing as it's affecting day to day activities

IMPvzBk1aa	A bursa is a little sac containing fluid that reduces friction where structures like muscles, tendons or ligaments attach to or move over joints.  Bursitis is a condition that can develop when the tissue overlying a joint is overstressed, and the sac of fluid becomes inflamed and painful. Sometimes it becomes enlarged with excessive fluid that inflammation can cause to be secreted, so you have a swollen and painful area over the joint.|`|WPzaF2osaa	Normally, the olecranon bursa prevents tissue tears by providing a mechanism with which the skin can glide freely over the olecranon process. Bursal inflammation may be caused by a variety of mechanisms. Owing to its superficial location, this bursa is susceptible to inflammation from either acute or repetitive (cumulative) trauma. Less commonly, inflammation may result from infection (septic bursitis). The main treatment is NSAIDS like aleve or ibuprofen. If there is no improvement after 1-2 weeks, local steroid injection may the next treatment. If it cause by infection it will require antibiotics. Also physical therapy may improve pain and inflammation. Modification of the cause like avoid repetitive injury may also help on the treatment. Always consult a physician if any doubt.|`|r6rcCTKHaa	theres a pouch of liquid in your elbow and he probably popped it, causing it to swell.<br>  <br>  it happened to me when i fell off my skateboard|`|a64c1f9c9bc5c99c1e7d38bc6795866baa	lolll my friend has that too he fell on it A LOT and now theres like a squsihy part in his elbow and u can feel this water stuff in it and its really fun to squish it :D

0nyWiro9aa	In your case I take it to mean within the context of hyperglycorrhachia below.<br>  <br>  "2. Hypoglycorrhachia: The CSF is normally a clear, colorless, and virtually acellular fluid that is actively produced by the choroid plexus and ependymal cells lining the central nervous system (CNS) ventricles and subarachnoidal space through a process of ultrafiltration of plasma. Glucose levels in the CSF are 60% to 70% those of the serum; therefore, comparison between both values is paramount in interpreting abnormal results. Increased CSF glucose (hyperglycorrhachia) may be seen in the context of hyperglycemia or be due to a traumatic tap. Conversely, decreased CSF glucose (hypoglycorrhachia) is commonly found in untreated bacterial, fungal, tuberculous, or amoebic meningitis, and rarely in some viral CNS infections (particulary those caused by mumps and lymphocytic choriomeningitis viruses). Other causes of hypoglycorrhachia include CNS sarcoidosis and neoplasms (primary or metastatic)."|`|BNAzjSO1aa	I think you must have misunderstood the explanation because if there is any blood in your CF it is not likely to be good news as it may indicate a sub-arachnoid hemorrhage.

wMx9Z2gTaa	It sounds like you may have injured some of the soft or connective tissue in your wrist. Carpal tunnel involves the median nerve in your hand. Pain normally runs up the center of your wrist to your thumb, index finger, middle finger and one side of your ring finger.<br>  <br>  With carpal tunnel, you'll experience numbness and burning pain along the nerve because there is pressure on the nerve due to swelling in the carpal tunnel (a ring of tendons through which the median nerve runs).<br>  <br>  It would be best to see a doctor about the pain. In the meantime, apply cold packs when it is painful and take an anti-inflammatory pain killer (aspirin, ibuprofen, or naproxen sodium).<br>  <br>  Good luck!
3sriJtSkaa	in order to see if you have an infection that is causing meningitis they need to take a sample of your cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) and see if has either virus or bacteria in it. In order to do this they have to do an LP, (Lumbar Puncture commonly known as a "spinal tap") and collect a small amount of CSF. <br>  Either way, in all honesty that sounds realy, really wierd. <br>   Meningitis is very, very serious. Bacterial meningitis can kill you in 24 hours, and even viral meningitis is quite serious. No good doctor would say "I think you show many symptoms of meningitis, here's a muscle relaxer". That just doesn't make sense. <br>  I can't tell you for sure without looking at your chart but here's what I would say explains things<br>  1. they didn't really think you had meningitis for whatever reason and treated the pain instead of teh cause of the pain<br>  2. they are somehow sure it's not serious and wanted to avoid doing an extremly unplesant LP if it's not needed<br>  3. you don't have insurance and they did the absolute minimum and  want to be absolutely sure you're going to die unless they treat you before they do 1000's of dollars worth of tests on you.<br>  4. you've gotten the details confused and you really have some sort of muscular strain but it feels like meningitis <br>  <br>  regardless of what actually happened, it's obviously not fixed and the fact that it's getting worse could be an indication of something truly serious. Go back to the ER, tell them exactly what your symptoms are and don't try to emphasize or play down any symptoms. Just tell tell tehm the exact truth and if you still feel you haven't been treated properly- and expecially if it gets ANY worse- go directly to the next closest ER and get a second opinion. <br>  All meningitis can kill you and bacterial meningitis WILL kill you so make sure you've gotten the right diagnosis.
kLN5hx6paa	Well,<br>  <br>  If your not use to using your legs alot of walking around it can cause them to be sore for a few days, Its no different then working out for the first time or playing sport after not playing for a long time.<br>  <br>  My advice to you is to take a warm bath with epson salt and see if that helps, ask your doctor if you havent already if you can take pain meds like IB, advil etc.<br>  <br>  If its growing pains you just got to ride it out. If the pain gets worse or your legs start giving out I would advise you to go to the doctor but if its just sore, follow my advice you should be fine.
kbewbKPQaa	I don't have any experience but what I know is as with any surgery there are risks involved during and after surgery but  the doctor should have went over the specifics. Also breast implants do have to be replaced every 10 years or so but other than that this is done countless times a day so I'm sure everything will turn out great. You will be in pain but there is medicine for that

I think your fine.

It is perfectly normal|`|IG06mUMIaa	my girlfriend started hers when she was 14.  Youre fine though. Everyone starts at different times
BRFkc8pBaa	Disregard her. What are you like 14? Don't worry about it. If you don't care and just go on with you life and disregard her, she'll feel stupid and you'll look better to everyone else. As far as the boy, don't get yourself tangled up in little boys. Especially ones with a bunch of girl "friends". I'll tell you this because I know from experience. Girls and guys cannot just be friends. Its human nature. It won't happen. Eventually all you little high school kids will figure this out. Hell, I'm a sophomore in college and I still know a bunch of girls who haven't. <br>  <br>  Here's the situation with relationships:<br>  <br>  He should solely be your best friend. <br>  Other girls annoy the **** out of him with their bullshit. Mostly because all girls are insecure and they love to prove that guys like them by trying to sleep with them. (that may be a bit much for your age, but I'm working with it)<br>  You have to be uninterested in him for him to like you. Its this stupid game of tag but like I said, I know from experience. <br>  <br>  Never trust hoes.<br>  <br>  Don't be interested in guys that associate with hoes. <br>  <br>  Don't be friends with hoes.<br>  <br>  When a guy likes you, no matter who they are, you feel sort of special don't you? Well get over it. That's exactly how a hoe feels. Look at it like this: You feel good that you got the attention, don't you think that's how every girl feels?<br>  <br>  Yes. It is and that's why women tend to throw themselves at men. And that's why men leave women. <br>  <br>  So be a big girl, look the other way and don't play around with the bullshit. I don't and I'm very happy. If my boyfriend was going around talking, flirting, and being "friends" with some other girls, I'd kick him to the curb and I'm pretty sure he'd do the same to me. <br>  <br>  You have to have that mutual understanding. Keeps you in line and him. Removes temptation.<br>  <br>  So be happy by yourself. Everything else falls into place for you. Also the best circle of people to date are guys, you wouldn't consider. Your best friend that you ***** to about everything else. If you've got some guy listening to you whine about other guys and girls trust me, he likes you. So if he's alright looking go for it. Guys are a dime a dozen and they're a lot easier to make better than a girl is.<br>  <br>  I.e., an ugly girl, can't do much about it. Ugly girl with cute clothes, cute hair, and a figure. Still ugly.<br>  <br>  ugly boy. probably ugly because he doesn't know how to dress, or cut his hair. <br>  <br>  Guys are a lot luckier in that they can always look better. Best example of that is a man in his late 40s and a woman in hers. He got better, she got worse.|`|OZRiZQg4aa	Im 100% serious when i say this,..

wUdweNSmaa	I think you should talk to your mom. If you are a virgin and have plans to remain one, you should tell her and the doctor this.<br>  <br>  If there is a chance that you might not remain a virgin, then discuss that with your mom. There are lots of great alternatives. If you are not committed to taking the birth control that will not work anyway.|`|UT5HS39Daa	It depends on your gynecologist, some will only do pap smears if you are sexually active, or if you are over a certain age.  Even if you are not sexually active, you may request to have one anyway.  It is not going to be more uncomfortable to have one done, they are going to have to examine you to prescribe birth control anyway.  I will tell you it does not hurt though, and if the doctor is hurting you, they are doing something wrong and you need to tell them immediately.  Best of Luck!!

5veU5nSwaa	It is good that it is draining the pain will go away and it will start to heal , keep it clean, use antibacterial soap. The next time you get one go to the doctor once it has popped and drained there isn't anything they can do. This is what you have and what you see draining is probaly blood and a thick puss right? These can also appear on the insides of the thighs so watch out for that. You can also try putting ointment of icthamol on it covering with a large gauze bandage, icthamol is an ointment that draws things out of the skin from slivers to liquids, my husband uses it on his before they pop while it is still hard and very painful and it helps to speed up the process.|`|bb912ce61f49cc45dfbfa372f8622380aa	You seem to have done a good job investigating it. The cyst can drain on it's own, and usually does not need antibiotics if it does. You can soak in the bathtub to keep the skin clean and soft, open to drain. If, after the infection/inflammation decreases, you want to have it excised (cut out) see a surgeon. They can cut out the bad area and sew the  good skin edges together.

DFJ9m4WKaa	From what my female friends have told me, cervical penetration is the female equivalent of getting kicked in the nuts.<br>  <br>  If this has only happened once and has not continued or you have not had any history of such pains before, I would say its just a one time deal probably a result of your husband going too deep.<br>  <br>  Psychologically, it could be a physiological reaction to subconsciously feeling under attack. Trauma survives of sexual abuse, especially at an early age in life, can experience any number of disorders later on in life. Of course, if you have no such experiences, that rules this theory out.<br>  <br>  Physiologically the vulva of the vagina is lined with literally millions of nerve endings. If you husband just hit the right one, he may have triggered a reaction that could have affected a muscle group outside of your vulva and around your waist. This is because many of the same nerve endings are also connected to nerves that control other muscle groups in that region.<br>  <br>  If this problem continues, I would suggest you see a gynecologist, not your regular doctor. Your regular doctor will most likely send you to a specialist anyway, if they cannot find anything obviously wrong with you. In the mean time - avoid deep penetration!|`|JERUmEFzaa	I suggest you see a doctor and put a heating pack where it hurts so the pain can be soothed.|`|zTP4j4nGaa	Just as a suggestion the fact that he "took you deep" may mean that he was hitting your cervix.

yPLS0FeWaa	There is no concrete evidence that says vaccines cause autism. If there was then the federal courts would not have made a ruling.  Many associate the MMR vaccine with autism, but little do people realize that the MMR vaccine is given around the same time the typical characteristics of autism become noticeable, many had characteristics at an earlier age but were not recognized, many think there child was just slow and would grow out of it. Many also associate thimerosal (mercury additive) in other vaccines as to causing autism, but yet you never heard about if the mother ate fish such as tuna that is known to have high mercury content while pregnant, or perhaps the mother had mercury fillings in her teeth that could of been absorbed into the system while pregnant. If people look at thimerosal as a possible cause then why hasn't everything with mercury been considered, how many cases of research have you heard in regards to those. Thimerosal hasn't been in vaccines since 1991 except the flu vaccine which you can get with or without thimerosal. Granted some vaccines with thimerosal were still given after they began the removal of it until the supply was gone, wouldn't the cases of autism being diagnosed go down because of no longer using thimerosal. If you do some research, there was a Dr.  who started the whole theory about the MMR vaccine issue who was later found to be discredited. (**edit: **Dr. Andrew  Wakefield is the doctor who associated the MMR vaccine as to causing autism in a report released in 1998 and published in The Lancelot, it was later found that he fixed the results and most of those children in the research  had signs of autism documented in their medical records before they recieved the MMR shot. <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/article5683671.ece" rel="nofollow">http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_an...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/article5683643.ece" rel="nofollow">http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_an...</a>    end edit **)<br>  My son was diagnosed with autism before receiving his MMR shots, he has had both doses since and his autism did not get any worse, my 2 older sons had their doses and neither of them have autism or any other condition. Bottom line is no one can say 100% for sure what the cause is regardless of what they believe. You'll find just as many parents who strongly believe vaccines did not cause autism in their child as you would those parents who do believe it did.  You know you never heard to much about the vaccine issue until Jenny McCarthy opened her mouth, I feel many parents just jumped on the bandwagon. She use to also say that autism can be cured but changed it to that they can recover, it cannot be cured, it is a life long disability but with proper treatments and the earlier they receive them, the better chance they have to overcome many of their characteristics. For example, I know these are not the same but am using it to demostrate a point...someone is found to be diabetic, they change their diet  to control their blood sugar level, they take insuline to prevent diabetic seizures and also to help control their blood sugar level, just because they may never have a diabetic seizure and their blood sugar level remains under control does not mean their diabetes is cured. In many cases you would not even realize they had diabetes unless they stated that they did. Same goes with autism, even though they receive treatments and characteristics improve and some even disappear does not mean the autism is no longer there. Another example would be asperger's which is a form of autism sometimes known as high functioning autism, to those not familiar with the characteristics of asperger's they appear to be normal and to some above normal because they usually are very intelligent and  have very high iq's, just because they appear to be normal or above normal doesn't mean they don't have asperger's.|`|BNAzjSO1aa	Some studies have seemed to show a link between the MMR vaccine given to babies and an increase risk of autism, but other studies show no such link. Unfortunately this gives rise to people not vaccinating their children often in the mistaken belief that these illnesses are only childhood infections and nothing to worry about, which is not true.<br>  MEASLES complications can include diarrhea, corneal scarring and encephalitis(Inflammation of the brain) and it can kill about 3 in 1000 children more in poorer countries and in adults it may be worse.<br>  MUMPS the most common complication is inflammation of the testicles (can lead to infertility)/ inflammation of breasts and genitals in girls who have reached puberty encephalitis and meningitis In pregnant women can cause miscarriage especially in the first three months<br>  RUBELLA complications include miscarriage and rubella congenital syndrome<br>  Unfortunately as fewer people are having their babies vaccinated these diseases are becoming nearly epidemic again in certain areas|`|GiYVrmI3aa	No. The reason that it seems like vaccines  give children autism is because as the rate of vaccines being given has increased so has the rate of children being diagnosed with autism. HOWEVER, the only reason more children are being diagnosed with autism now is because before, children who had autism were just diagnosed with mental retardation. New medical advances have allowed for doctors to make more accurate diagnoses, therefore increasing the rate of children with autism. It is just a coincidence that the two have increased at the same rate.|`|8ryoShBpaa	All this stuff about studies and personal theories or repeating what you heard in the news is junk.  My children no longer have autism.  While all the denials and deceit are flying around due to greed, thousands are being recovered from autism and gobs of other diagnoses supposedly untreatable and unreversible.  You can't just repeat what sounds good in your head.  Just like the show CSI, you need to gather evidence to make a proper explanation.  In the case of autism, let's look at what we know:  thousands have been recovered; there are doctors all over the U.S. who are doing this by treating for pathogens and toxins (go to the autism forums to find them); much of the way they reverse autism is by treating for the same pathogens and toxins found in vaccines; these same pathogens and toxins can be obtained via sex, transferred in pregancy and from the environment (pets, foods, etc.).  What is not konwn is how much vaccines play a role.  But, if these doctors are reversing autism by treating children for measles from the vaccines, and mercury from either vaccines, fish, corn syrup or other food, air, dental fillings, and who knows what/where else, than it looks strongly like vaccines do play a role.  <br>  <br>  Bottom line is, these doctors know the most since they are reversing autism.  You can find them on autism forums or google DAN doctors.  Some are not DAN doctors, but homeopaths, naturopaths, chiropractors and others who decided to concentrate on autism treatment.  You can also go to www.generationrescue.org to find doctors in your area who know that autism is caused by pathogens and toxins.  I think that the general consensus among them is that vaccines stress the immune system in such a way that it no longer shows a sick response, and so one does not show signs of illness, but rather dysfunction.  This dysfunction is varying symptoms in walking, talking, concentrating, or acting oddly.  The senses are also involved.  <br>  <br>  Ok, this may be more than what a 15 year old wants to know.  But let me give you a tip on learning.  Get you knowledge from the right source.  In the case of autism, you will hear a bunch of conflicting reports.  Do not believe anyone because they have a degree.  Believe those who have actually rid autism.  They are the ones who know.  My children no longer have autism and part of the way it is done is by ridding the effects of the vaccines, and the ingredients in them from their bodies.  This, alone, is not all that is done.  Just know that vaccines could be great.  They just currently need an overhaul.  The reasons vaccines are failing us, is because the vaccine manufacturers are protected by the government from getting into trouble.  Whenever one does not have to be held accountale, they are liable to do things very differently than if they could be held accountable.  What would you be like if no matter what you did, you could not go to jail?  Thus, I feel vaccines could be done better and safer, but it's just plain unrealistic to expect people to do the right thing if they can not be held accountable.  I mean really, how many people would pay taxes if there was no IRS.|`|278113a07b7b6648ec6e32639de20bf9aa	I've done a lot of research on this.  My cousin has 4 children.  3 of them have various stages of autism.  ALL of her children get ALL of the "recommended" and "required" shots.  There are also genetic things, but in my opinion, given the research that I have done, the vaccines either cause the autism or they trigger what is already genetically there.  <br>  <br>  1.

They don't even know which strain is going to be infecting people, so it's just a guessing game anyway.  It's got to be one of the most useless shots they've made.  Also, I've heard of several people coming down w/ the flu after etting the shot.  <br>  <br>  Be very thankful that you are "perfectly fine" and that the vaccines haven't affected you.  That is a blessing, but not an argument that the vaccines do not cause averse affects.  If it affected everyone that way, it would be obvious what the cause is and they would have no choice but to quit using the vaccines as they are currently manufactured.  <br>  <br>  Another thing to note is that many of the "studies" drug companies do on vaccines are ONLY on the vaccine being studies.  Children/babies who receive vaccines receive MANY at one time.  To my knowledge, they do not do a study on the vaccine given ALONG WITH all the other shots the child/baby would be receiving at that time to see what the combined effect would be.  How do they know that it isn't the COMBINATION of so many vaccines causing the problem?  They do not know.  They just test one vaccine by itself and they give it, along with several others.|`|sDfBDXpXaa	Vaccines are linked to almost all diseases and serious health problems.<br>  The modern medical community has no clue what real health is or how to prevent it so they stab with needles and slice with knives at everything.<br>  Check out this site www.shirleys-wellness-cafe.com|`|S74ZRbtWaa	It all depends on who you ask about vaccines and autism.  Just recently a federal court ruled that there is no scientific proof that autism is linked to vaccines.  Still there are many parents out there who believe it is.<br>  <br>  Personally, I think the risks of not vaccinating are something not to be taken lightly.

There is nothing you can really do about it, well that is healthy any ways. Just embrace your height :D Plus many girls go for boys that are taller then them! So that's a plus|`|8y24H37Maa	that is really short for a guy!!! if i saw u i would laugh!!|`|LeaeoiSQaa	Embrace your height I have so many guy friends that wish they were taller!

Don't worry I would love to be that tall!|`|S8Fhbvu7aa	I'm a 15 year old girl and I'm 5'8, most of my friends are my height or taller. If you stop growing at 5'8 you're going to end up being short because at your age you still have a few growth spurts to go through. But what's the problem with being tall anyway? There's nothing wrong with it, you can possibly see over crowds, reach things on the top shelf and girls love guys who are taller than them!

Sh7r0kNuaa	I've never heard of someone using the term "tripping on pot" seriously. Pot doesn't really send you on a trip like hallucinogens (and dont give me that "pot is a hallucinogen" crap, if you've tried a a real hallucinogen you know what a real trip is).."tripping" in the way you use the word isn't the way that people use it in the sense of tripping on a drug. you meant that you were getting paranoid from the weed. next time you shouldn't smoke as much.|`|aVxUT1cYaa	I haven't had a particularly bad one, but as for one that COULD have been bad, I once ate a firecracker (basically weed + peanut butter between crackers cooked) on the bus before school. Well, for the first two periods all I felt was a slight buzz. But then all of a sudden during third period, it hit me like a ****ing train. Our band teacher was talking to us about something, but all I could do was sit there and look dazed. Then we started watching Robin Hood for some reason. The whole period, I was just messed up, practically melting into the floor. The feeling started to fade as I got into lunch (which was AMAZING lol) but still kinda remained for hours afterward. It was nuts. I was really lucky that it didn't kick in during second period, when I had a math test. And I'm lucky that I didn't actually have to play my instrument in band. I would be playing some ****ed up music.|`|fCLRLpJXaa	I'm sorry for you. For an extremely unfortunate so then fortunately a seemingly small group of individuals THC seems to affect their minds in a different, not so calming or enjoyable sort of way that it does the majority of us, the fortunate ones!

Stealing from his life's journey; the freeness of  floating with the clouds, the excitement of riding a shooting star and the peaceful pleasure of rocking on the tip of a waning moon.  Instead, indulging in the palatable pleasantness of perfumed purple perfection produced perpetual paranoia prozac peacefully pacified!!! <br>  Being a 32 year veteran I consider myself a connoisseur, a professional, an expert, a lover of the fine art of marijuana consumption. I have integrated it into virtually every aspect of my otherwise dreary existance and we are married for life. I have no crazy "pot" stories to tell which is one of my many, many reasons for loving it so.... Oh man, I've got many wild, crazy, outrageously fun stories of my eventful life to tell and pot is at the root of, at the center and yeah probably the end of each and every tale from astounding to zany but my beautiful bud is the calming force. She makes me happy when I'm sad, glad when I'm mad, calm when I'm stressed and peaceful always. It washes away the dirt of my day and turns my frown upside down.

She has never made me cry and cares only for my happiness. <br>  You my friend are a baby, a newcomer, a novice. You put yourself in uncomfortable surroundings and allowed paranoi to take over.

BNAzjSO1aa	That could be a normal level if she had eaten or had something sweet to drink recently. Diabetes can not be diagnosed by one blood glucose reading it would have to be several readings taken at different times of the day to be sure of a correct diagnosis. If she is showing any of the symptoms of diabetes get her doctor to check her levels. If she had handled something like an apple or orange it may have been a false reading.

The easiest test is an HbA1c, which doesn't require fasting, and will give her average blood sugar over the last 3 months. <br>  <br>  The doctor may do a fasting blood glucose, but it may or may not pick up high blood sugar levels, because some people only go high after meals. That's why I recommend that you ask for the HbA1c in addition to anything the doctor may order. <br>  <br>  Another test is the Glucose Tolerance Test, which requires a fasting test, and then drinking a sugar solution, and retesting after a couple fo hours.

Sausages and bacon - get them from a butcher rather than a supermarket - independent butchets sausages tend to be full of meat rather than fat and rusk. Independent butchers bacon is often not stuffed full of nitrate preservatives.<br>  <br>  2. Grill, underneath a salamander (overhead heat-source) rather than fry in lard or oil.<br>  <br>  3. Fried bread - spray it with water before you fry it, this will reduce the uptake of fat into the bread, Use bread from an independent baker if you can get it. Same applies for the bread you use for toast.<br>  <br>  4.

That is NOT a way of cutting the lens.<br>  <br>  An aspheric lens is aspheric because of the way the curvatures were ground in to the lens, which offers a thinner profile than a lens of the same Rx , but non-aspheric.<br>  <br>  Don't ask for your lenses to be cut aspheric, you will get laughed out of the store.<br>  <br>  Because of the axis of your cylindrical power, any thickness will be at top and bottom, with hardly any at the outer edge.<br>  <br>  So, again there, a round frame is not the right suggestion, a round frame adds more depth to the lens, which you need to eliminate.<br>  <br>  A rectangular shape, and quite shallow , would be the best choice to be sure most of the thickness is cut away at the top and bottom. The deeper the frame, the more thickness will remain.<br>  <br>  Getting an aspheric lens in your prescription wouldn't really have any benefit. Your Rx really isn't strong enough for it to make any difference.<br>  <br>  A 1.56 or 1.61 would be plenty for your prescription. Going higher than 1.61 will most likely cause aberations in the lenses.<br>  <br>  Just be sure to get a quality anti reflection coating on them, and they will look great.<br>  <br>  Also, btw...your - 3.7 is actually - 3.75|`|XS5CfmAMaa	Wow, that is an impressive amount of astigmatism you have.  If you made your lenses out of regular plastic, they would be thin on the edges near your ears (sides) but VERY thick on the edges near your eyebrows (tops).<br>  <br>  Yes, you would benefit greatly from aspheric lenses, but there are other things you can do to make your lenses not seem so "coke-bottle"-ish.  In order of how much they will help your lenses look thinner...<br>  <br>  1) Get a very small round frame.  Your lenses are very thin in the centers, but get progressively thicker the farther out you go.  Pick a small round frame, and your lenses will not need to be cut so thick.<br>  <br>  2) Have the lens made out of a "hi-index" material. Regular plastic (called CR-39 in opticals) is the cheapest material, but yield the thickest lenses.  Polycarbonate is a fairly inexpensive hi-index material that gives you about 20% thinner lenses, is much lighter in weight, is very impact resistant, but scratches easier. Other materials are even thinner than polycarbonate and have special trade names.  Ignore the names and ask them "what is its index".  They will give you a number like 1.5 or 1.6.  The higher the number, the more expensive it is, but the thinner your lenses.<br>  <br>  3) Use "aspheric" lenses.  This is a way of cutting the lenses (regardless of the material) that thins the edges down.  It sacrifices the clarity of the prescription to shave some of the material away.  It will distort the edges of your vision, but most people can adapt to this.  It is a marketing myth that aspherically cut lenses reduce the distortion in thick lenses. This is only true in very specific types of prescriptions.  In most (including yours) it actually adds a small amount of distortion.  But again, 90% of people adapt to in a few days.<br>  <br>  So there it is.  Pick a small round frame (or closest you can get to that shape), get hi-index material, and get aspheric cut lenses.  Those three things will help GREATLY.

8WbfmK5daa	I have never been on or taken Celexa and do not have any personal experience with it. However, I am studying psychology at University and happen to know quite a bit about this drug :).<br>  <br>  I do find it interesting that the doctor choose to put you on Celexa as this is an anti-depressant as there are other things that he or she could have prescribed you for an anxiety disorder. But anyway that is not important.<br>  <br>  As I mentioned, Celexa (citalopram HBr) is indicated for the treatment of depression.<br>  <br>  The efficacy of Celexa in the treatment of depression was established in 4-6 week, controlled trials of outpatients whose diagnosis corresponded most closely to the DSM-III and DSM-III-R category of major depressive disorder.<br>  <br>  A major depressive episode (DSM-IV) implies a prominent and relatively persistent (nearly every day for at least 2 weeks) depressed or dysphoric mood that usually interferes with daily functioning, and includes at least five of the following nine symptoms: depressed mood, loss of interest in usual activities, significant change in weight and/or appetite, insomnia or hypersomnia, psychomotor agitation or retardation, increased fatigue, feelings of guilt or worthlessness, slowed thinking or impaired concentration, a suicide attempt or suicidal ideation. The antidepressant action of Celexa in hospitalized depressed patients has not been adequately studied.<br>  <br>  The efficacy of Celexa in maintaining an antidepressant response for up to 24 weeks following 6 to 8 weeks of acute treatment was demonstrated in two placebo-controlled trials. Nevertheless, the physician who elects to use Celexa for extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.<br>  <br>  Celexa (citalopram HBr) should be administered at an initial dose of 20 mg once daily, generally with an increase to a dose of 40 mg/day. Dose increases should usually occur in increments of 20 mg at intervals of no less than one week. Although certain patients may require a dose of 60 mg/day, the only study pertinent to dose response for effectiveness did not demonstrate an advantage for the 60 mg/day dose over the 40 mg/day dose; doses above 40 mg are therefore not ordinarily recommended.<br>  <br>  Celexa should be administered once daily, in the morning or evening, with or without food.<br>  <br>  Side effects include:<br>  <br>  Cardiovascular - Frequent: tachycardia, postural hypotension, hypotension.

The only thing I remember is that it didn't help me at all. I was a depressed person when I started taking it and I was a depressed person when I stopped taking it. I cannot remember any specific side effects from this drug. Actually side effect wise it was probably one of the more gentle drugs I've been on. I think I was on lithium at the same time which had bad side effects, but I cannot paint a clear picture regarding the side effects for celexa.

BRFkc8pBaa	In all seriousness, they probably won't work anyways. Your breast size is determined by your DNA. There's only two real things to change that: children and weight. Breasts are mostly adipose tissue(fat) and when you gain weight, you gain breast. Pregnancy's also make them bigger. i.e., my mom was an a until after the fourth child. Then she was a B. The fifth child pushed her over the edge and now she's a C but she kept some weight too, so that could be why.|`|DozD8lTGaa	just do what the instructions say, to make sure you get the best result.

9EVcTnUWaa	As a person with LD's and as the mother of three girls with various LD's I have to tell you that it's very rare to find someone with LD's who only  has one.  So I would say that 95 percent of people with LD's as at least two if not more.  I have 15 people in my immediate and extended family who have LD's and there isn't one of us who only has one.  In fact talking to my cousin and brother who are special education teachers they don't' have any students with only one disability. Even my middle daughter who has the mildest case of dyslexia also deals with fine motor skill issues which made it hard to learn to write.  My youngest daughter who has the severest form of dyslexia has three other LD's.  So most of the people who have LD's have at least two.

But I went on Lexapro and Alprazolam and am also getting some counseling.  It has worked wonders!!!|`|ParFJxnSaa	View the techniques for control of anxiety/panic attacks, in section 8, at ezy build, below. Begin, on this first occasion, only, by holding your breath for 5, or 10 seconds: this will give you the confidence to realise that YOU CAN CONTROL YOUR BREATHING, but not pass out, or die (your autonomic nervous system resumes breathing, if you become unconscious). Advice from a published psychiatrist on controlled breathing: (1.) Get a clock, or watch with a second timer. (2.) Practise for 5 minutes, 4 times daily, until proficient. (3.) Take a small breath in, and hold it, for 6 seconds. (4.) Think to yourself: "RELAX", just before breathing out. (5.) Try to feel a sense of releasing tension, as you breathe out. (6.) Breathe in for 3 seconds, then out, for 3 seconds. Try to make your breathing very smooth, and light, as you breathe in through your nose, and out through your mouth, or nose. (7.) For the next minute, continue to breathe in, and out, every 3 seconds. (8.) Go back to step 3, at the end of the minute, and proceed through to step 7, doing this for 5 minutes. Use this at the very first sign of a panic attack starting, or any time you feel anxious, or tense. Similar, but simpler advice, from a clinical psychologist is to breathe in to the count of 3: (one thousand one; one thousand two; one thousand three) each takes around a second to say to yourself, in your mind. Then breathe out to the count of 3. Repeat, until it begins to take effect. Understand panic attacks, and what triggers them, in your life (if it is unresolved anxiety, or stress, see sections 6, [page N first] or 42, [page i first] respectively). <br>  <br>  The paper bag method also works for most people, but is not suited to all circumstances, such as driving, or playing sport. Another alternative is psychotherapy, to address its fundamental cause, which is usually anxiety; read section 1, and examine the <a href="http://1-800-therapist.com/" rel="nofollow">http://1-800-therapist.com/</a> & <a href="http://www.metanoia.org/choose/" rel="nofollow">http://www.metanoia.org/choose/</a> websites, and use the locators to find a therapist, (and phone book, but only if necessary). I used to suffer from panic attacks, until I questioned what had changed in my life, at, or just before that time, to trigger them, which is enough for some people. Visualise as vividly as possible, a large, red, flashing, "STOP!" sign, and/or possibly a stern faced person wagging an index finger at you in a negative manner, then say to yourself as forcefully as you can, even aloud in a big voice, if alone: "I know this tactic: GO AWAY FOR A WHILE !!!" You may want to us either: "ruse", "ploy", "game", or "trick", instead of "tactic". It usually takes 30 - 40 repetitions, for most people, to establish a new habit. I also suggest that you learn, then practise the controlled breathing technique, until competent, then employ it, at the very first sign of a panic attack.<br>  <br>  Practice one of the relaxation methods in sections 11, 2, 2c, or 2i, daily, and when needed. Also, give the EFT a good tryout, to see if it helps you. There is also a version for use in public places, (if you like, you can claim to have a headache, as you massage/lightly tap your temples, but you would then be restricted to subvocalising - saying it to yourself in your mind). Sections 53, and 2, 2.q and 2.o at <a href="http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris" rel="nofollow">http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris</a> also refer: "Even though I sometimes suffer from panic attacks, I deeply and completely accept myself." Note: the controlled breathing only helps with the symptoms (as do medications/herbal remedies): you need to address the underlying cause, which requires some form of therapy, and Cognitive Behavio(u)ral Therapy has been shown to be effective. Imagine that the cause of your panic; your anxieties, fears, your self doubts, self recriminations, all the agonizing "I'm-so-Stupids"; every painful "I-can't-do-it" are huge raging, hurtful bulls snorting and charging at you. You see them coming at you and you hold out your red matador's cape at arms length and simply let them charge right by.|`|VkVyuq5baa	I attend a social anxiety class and last week our group was encouraged to have a panic attack. We are told to do so because it will help us learn that the anxiety itself is harmless, but it is our reactions to it which is problematic. You have a "fear of fear" now in that you are afraid of having an anxiety attack but if you were not scared of it you would be okay. I think you should go to your GP. I have had an anxiety disorder for many years now, which means it will take longer to go away.

The key ingredient is not medication, lifestyle changes, or relaxation exercises. It is when the individual no longer fears the thought of having a panic attack. <br>  <br>  This may seem like a simplified and obvious observation but give it careful consideration. The one thing that has you searching for a solution to anxiety and panic attacks this very moment is the fear of having another one.<br>  <br>  The first time a person experiences a panic attack it can feel like their world is falling down around them. Nowhere feels safe as the anxiety becomes like a stalker lurking in the background. <br>  <br>  When this happens people begin to either avoid situations that make them anxious or they medicate themselves to the point where they are numb to the fear.

Once you find the right medicine and dosage, it would be very life changing.  <br>  I don't have this problem, but I have several people in my family with this issue.  <br>  My child has had seizures since she was a toddler.  She has been on medication to stop the seizures.  The brain wants to naturally fall into patterns that it already knows.  The medicine forces the brain to find a different way to deal.  After many years, my child has been able to stop using seizure medication.  <br>  Even if you don't have seizures, the simple fact is that once your brain has a deeply embedded pattern, it sometimes needs help to prod it into a new one until the old pathway disappears.  <br>  Whether you take medication or find alternative ways to deal with this, it's important that you search because most of the time, it will only compound.  <br>  See a doctor for help.|`|wvKJLce8aa	did you see a doctor? please see a professional.|`|wTy2p2wPaa	Go to the your Gp, i know it might be hard but you need to be more open with it and talk to your doctor.<br>  He/She is more of help to you then any old strangers from here, I mean what do i know im 13 and i hope nothing ever happens to me or even worse anyone around me.<br>  I feel your pain and i hope everything and i mean it, everything gets better and you start to see the light of day again.<br>  <br>  + If you keep going over that traumatic event its going to bring you down even more and i really mean that trust me being open about it will help you more then you think.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  good luck|`|bgKitk9paa	I understand.

We went for our chemotherapy treatment this week and in the hospital we go for treatment they have booths separated by a curtain.<br>  <br>  Nobody was next to our booth until a lady and her husband came in.

I am sure there is the possibility to stop the cell division from mutation.  I am not a doctor or a scientist.  But I have faith and everyday often several times a day I pray for the cure for cancer.<br>  <br>  I pray for everyone in the world that has cancer, that is going to experience cancer treatments of chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery.  I pray for their families, for the little children that is fighting cancer, for teenagers, and for adults.  I pray for those that have it so bad they are in hospices that may die from it.<br>  <br>  And I pray for a cure.  I pray for a cure and someday I believe God will answer my prayers and the prayers of millions of people like me.<br>  <br>  That is my hope.|`|FicyC2TXaa	The problem with finding a 'cure for cancer' is that cancer is hundreds of diseases, not just one. The difficulty is that different cancers are caused by different things, so no one strategy can prevent them, and different cancers respond to different treatments so no one treatment can cure them all. There will never be a magic bullet that cures all cancer. <br>  <br>  And some cancers CAN be cured these days: 7 out of 10 children are cured of cancer. Testicular cancer, Hodgkin's disease, and many cases of leukaemia can all be cured in adults with chemotherapy, most skin cancers are cured with surgery, and many cases of thyroid cancer and cancer of the larynx are cured with radiotherapy.<br>  <br>  Many other types of cancer are also cured if they are found early enough. There is still a long way to go, especially with some of the commonest types of cancer such as lung, breast, bowel and prostate cancer.<br>  <br>  There will never be a Eureka! moment when a single substance or procedure is discovered that will reverse all types of cancer. Rather there will be steady, sometimes slow, progress - an improved treatment , a way to reverse one type of cancer, a way to prolong more lives.<br>  <br>  The suggestion by some that there is no effort being made to find cures, or that a secret cure is being hidden for reasons of profit are nonsense. These conspiracy theories are urban myths, a sort of game played by those who have not had cancer or close experience of it.<br>  <br>  If there were such a conspiracy drug companies would either be keeping quiet about the cure or making no effort to find one even though it would bring them fame and fortune. Any drug company discovering a cure would make far more money than they can have dreamed of making up till now.<br>  <br>  And doctors, scientists, researchers etc would be watching their relatives die and dying themselves (they and their families develop cancer at the same rate as the rest of the population) rather than co-operate to find a cure or revealing the existing secret cure<br>  <br>  And in order to prove that any secret, hidden cure worked, thousands of people would have to have been cured by it (otherwise how would they know it worked?). They’d all be keeping quiet too – not a word to the media from any of them either.<br>  <br>  Most unlikely of all, every medical professional in the whole world would have agreed to keep existence of a cure secret. Every single one. One blabbermouth, one disgruntled researcher or sacked nurse and the whole conspiracy’s blown. Newspapers and other media wouldn't have got a sniff of it.<br>  <br>  I live in the UK; we don't pay for our medical treatment, including cancer treatment. Cancer treatment costs our government untold billiions - no fortunes being made there. Yet we have the same treatments as the rest of the world - no miracle cure has been revealed in order to save money.<br>  <br>  Existing treatments aren't perfect - very far from it. One day people will look back on them with horror. But they are all we have at the moment, and we know, because they have been tested and proven in double-blind clinical trials, that they save many lives and prolong many, many more.<br>  <br>  As for those telling you about 'alternative' cancer cures - first, notice that none of them are claiming to have had their own cancer cured in this way - they are people who haven't had or studied cancer who've fallen for a scam on the internet.<br>  <br>  Alternative is another word for unproven.<br>  <br>  So called B17 is ine of the few 'alternative' cancer treatments that has been tested - and has been shown to be completely ineffective in preventing or treating cancer. It is also dangerous as it contains cyanide.|`|6d10196c158f49dbb02649f8773591d0aa	Since I started nursing in the 70's the advancement for detecting cancer and treating it has come on so much.

For a short time, I wore boxers over my briefs so I wouldn't get teased by other guys. My buddies didn't wear boxers and so I stopped wearing boxers over my briefs. Boxers would not have served any purpose for me or any of the other guys who played sports. Plus, girls seemed to like guys who were confident wearing briefs despite what the other guys wear doing.

PRzmwFfgaa	Are you stressed out?  Last year I went through a period when I was really really stressed.  My doctor put me on anti-depressants for 2 months.  Being on them made me realize exactly how stressed out I was.  I was working full time, in school full time, my son had been diagnosed with autism, and my neice and nephew came to live with me.  When I was put on the anti-depressants I got the most peaceful sleep I had gotten in months.  I mean, I hadn't had any problems sleeping before.  But no matter how much I slept, I was still sleepy.  But with this anti-depressant it was a truly peaceful sleep.  And I was happy again.  I spent the 2 months balancing my life to get rid of all the stress, and the grumpiness was gone.|`|lFrJ6hqNaa	might be lack of iron|`|wLFM00iiaa	i will explain this in the same way i found it out. <br>  <br>  your body likes and doesn't like some foods so reacts differently. it may be that your body does not like what you are eating and could be making you lethargic and tired. especially if you are eating stodgy food like lots of bread before you sleep or lots of bread generally, chips etc. try getting more vitamin C and fruit and vegetables into your body. i am a vegetarian but i recommend you lay off the meat - you could still eat fish. also try a 'detox day'. not quite as harsh as a normal one but lay off caffeine and have green tea, eat soups and lots of fruit. try not to have any stodgy food like pizza. cleanse your body and then try different foods and see how you feel. you will soon realize what makes you feel energetic and stick with that

What you should be doing is to have everything that is natural to eat so that you can get all the nutrients you need for proper development.  I am not sure what weight loss program you went on, however your diet should consist of all kinds of fruits, all kinds of vegetables, all kinds of unprocessed starchy foods (yams, potatoes, cassava etc.), all kinds of meats, all kinds of nuts, all kinds of seeds, all kinds of fish, all kinds of milk - in other words all kinds of everything that is natural and edible.<br>  <br>  What you might need to do now until your appetite is restored, is to drink all kinds of home made fresh raw fruit juices and home made fresh raw vegetable juices.

At your age people can be really unkind about things that are different in people.  I would suggest you have your parents take you to your family doctor first of all for a checkup including blood work that will look at your hormone levels.  It is really rare in younger guys but if you happened to need a estrogen blocking medication that would be the only way to determine it.   It could be also that you shot up height wise really fast and the rest of you needs to catch up. To deal with the issue at school I would look at which clothes I have that hide the problem area.  Make sure you wear an undershirt all the time to prevent your nipples from showing.  If the guys don't see them they are not going to comment on it.   If they do it is best to ignore them unless they attempt to cause you harm and in that case you have every right to protect yourself just don't swing at them first.|`|791369017fd575cf3f0e23a2ea22a6a3aa	OMG, them people are so stupid for making fun of you.

o1yy6KABaa	It sounds to me as though people are nice to jordan becuase they are simply scared by her. <br>  School isnt easy, and kids can be cruel. Just be true to yourself and believe in who you are and DONT change for anybody, they are simply jealous that you are pretty and nice etc. As you all get older they will look back and wonder why they treated people the way they have. <br>  <br>  When I was at school I was overweight and the unpopular kid, I went through hard things at a young age (my mother died of cancer when I started high school and I was out of school alot as she got sicker) and I became withdrawn which gave the kids even more of a reason to pick on me. As iv gotten older (im 31 now) I know that all of that just made me stronger than them, and I know that alot of them probably wouldnt be able to deal with half of what I did and still come out havign a good stable job, plenty of life long friends and my own home...and I did this all on my own. most of the girls I went to sccool with are now single mothers, on the benefit, and on drugs or whatver with nothing to show for their lives. The most popular girl in school has recently had her children taken from her for drug abuse etc. Which is so sad for the children and not fair on them to have to live with her mistakes.<br>  <br>  Always be true to yourself, and hold you head up high, and you will come a long way in life and look back on these times and laugh at those who once made you cry or angry.|`|0NcRUSCoaa	You can't be liked by everybody.|`|70sjdbzyaa	just be who you are and be confident no one can put you down and dont be afraid they treat u like crap give them the same medicine and so on life goes on.|`|OwJDjANKaa	Because life is a bad joke.|`|5u1G3Qb8aa	i'm sorry<br>  <br>  I don't care<br>  <br>  And to be honest<br>  <br>  No one does|`|3AlFMrA5aa	how old are u|`|vv44CfWtaa	do you think your friend is pretty?<br>  and i wouldn't change who you are.<br>  if people don't like you then f*** them.<br>  you are who you are and no matter how much you try u get over the  fact of not being popular. trust me. its not worth it.<br>  Jordan's not worth it.<br>  and i wouldn't be  jealous of your friend.<br>  it could tear you apart.<br>  trust me.<br>  i know.<br>  hope this helps.<br>  kay bye;|`|LDB8Rv8Baa	Don't try to be famous or popular in school.<br>  <br>  Stick to the people that enjoy your company and you enjoy theres.<br>  <br>  Stick to things you enjoy doing at school.<br>  <br>  Don't try to fit in with the wrong people.<br>  <br>  You may end up not liking them anyway.|`|SHbasL5Eaa	OMIGOD MY LIEF SUCKS IM NOT POPULAR<br>  WAHHHHHHH WHY WHY WHY ppl hate me. its cus im pretty. c:|`|cuF0pL2taa	Okay Andrea that wasnt nice.

I don't think that was the reason for the trouble you're having now, though.|`|BRFkc8pBaa	You should probably lay off the pills for like a month. Then get on nuvaring. You'll still get a period but its every three weeks and it should be a lot more controlled. You can't get rid of your period. Its your special little friend and it doesn't take no for an answer. <br>  <br>  Or discuss implanon with your gyno.<br>  <br>  By the way not having one at all, and taking your pills continuously with no off time is no bueno.|`|zyJN1hneaa	All i can say is DONT go on Nuvaring. !<br>  Your doctor hast told you to so  dont<br>  the best thing you could possibly do is go back and talk to your gyno
vmAIXuhBaa	-You could take vitamins<br>  -Make sure your eating a healthy good breakfast, because you get most of the energy throughout the day from breakfast.<br>  -try parking your car in the farthest parking spot when going to work or school, making you have to get some walking in. =P<br>  -If possible, avoid eating past 8pm, or right before bed.<br>  -Maybe try buying one of those special seat cushions you put on your seat when working that adjust your posture to a way that is more healthy and won't accumulate fat in certain areas.<br>  <br>  I know you were mainly looking for the energy part of it, but I hope this helps.|`|S8Fhbvu7aa	Simply put, lack of exercise. When your body goes without regular exercise it starts to conserve fat and muscle and your body literally starts shutting down. Oversleeping may be a problem for you too, oversleeping can be just as destructive as under sleeping so aim for 7-9 hours a night. To try to fix the energy problem try taking a vitimin B pill in the morning with your breakfast and going for a walk before breakfast to kickstart your metabolism. Exercising before breakfast gets it out of the way and you don't have to worry about it for the rest of the day because it's already done!|`|GLx35x33aa	I had the same problem. And it was solved through a combination of eating healthier and exercising 3x per week and also my thyroid was low. Even though when I went to the doctor the tests didn't show it.

Usually teenagers have low iron levels and develop anemia. It is very common and is easy to treat. You may also want to look into Maca root supplements. Maca root has done miracles to me, it helps your mood,energy, Thyroid, reproduction system, and overall health. I take a spoonful of it with my oatmeal every morning.|`|1uVZkMuxaa	me too! tell me when you find out!
4B1zfJqdaa	What a great idea for your friend Anna. He is lucky to have you as a bff.<br>  I am sure your school will do well with this. A few suggestions for an even bigger response would be to call on local establishments, hobby stores, coffee shops, etc. and ask if they would help sell them. Also, go to your local newspaper and get a press release done with pictures. Most newspapers will do this for free. They are always looking for heart felt stories. This is truly one of those stories. Good Luck Anna. You are really a great BFF.|`|sMgwk0jlaa	So long as it's not more than $10.

The only diet that definitely showed results for me was wu-yi tea, it can be checked out in the resource box underneath, they have a limited number of free trials remaining, it was highlighted in Fox News and CNN. I lost 20 pounds, it definitely does produce results!

I've been in and out of hospitals since the day that I was born. I had my first surgery at the age of 4 months old. I was born with a very very rare blood disorder and was in and out of hospitals all my life lived in one 30 of the first 36 months of my life.  I had my second surgery at the age of 10 was first diagnosed with depression at the age of 9 after making my first suicide attempt several weeks earlier before my 9th birthday.  So I was 8 the first time I tried to kill my self.  By the time I was 10 I'd been molested by my sister's girlfriends father. By the time I was 14 I'd had yet another surgery and two of my brother's had died.  By the age of 17 I'd been raped twice and had been in the hospital yet again.  Your life suck?? So did mine and a lot of other people.  You can decide that's the way that things will stay or you can do something about it. You aren't a child any more you can or not take charge of your life. I'm not saying that it will be easy, but if you don't take charge than who will?? You're life will suck as long as you let it. I'm not going to say that it will be easy or quick, but I know from personal experience that with help and determination you can change things.  I did and while I still deal with depression, I also have three great children, I have a family that loves me and supports me,because in part I took charge of my own life and I made it what it is today.I have three girls with learning disabilities, one who's developmentally delayed with the congivtive age of about 12 yet she lives in her own apartment, and works to help support herself.  She lives in supportive housing development but she does have her own place that she takes care of, where she cooks, cleans and does her own laundry,  My middle daughter has minor learning disabilities but she's had some psychological problems stemming from being molested and the death of her father when she was nine. Yet she finished college and is working on her master's in education so that she can teach art.  The youngest is the next one with severe learning disabilities and goes to a school for kids with LD's. She takes the same classes as any other high school student in NY she has to take the same state tests so that she can get  a regents diploma just like the other tens of thousands of high school students.  She has to deal with being abandoned by her father when she was 8 years old.  But she's working hard and getting 90+ averages and wants to be a neuro-psychologist to help kids with learning disabilities.  There shouldn't be any reason that she can't if she's willing to work hard and to do what ever it takes.  So it's your life what do you want to do with it?? You can sit and complain or you can act and make it better, no one else but you can do that. You aren't'  child so it's in your hands now.|`|92n42vksaa	You do have a lot of problems but you also seem to have a victim mentality where you are focusing on any limiting factor/ disadvantage you face (instead of looking for opportunities) and also believe your life to be controlled by your circumstances. <br>  You can set yourself challenges and take control of some parts of your life instead of carrying on in this defeatist way where you think you're stuck there for good and have no control over your future. You could start by, for example, thinking of things you can do at home to help your parents out, take all your medication properly, look into counseling or other ways to help reduce anxiety and stop being so ridiculous as to envy a drug addict mother or whatever else you spend your time dwelling on.|`|OwJDjANKaa	Sure sounds like it.|`|3AlFMrA5aa	let go and let God. u can do ALL things thru Christ that strenghthens u..... adding u as a contact... love u|`|FUcYuZ8saa	No your life is not over.  Yes you do have a future.  It's hard to see that at 20.  I am over 20 so trust me on this one.<br>  <br>  You have been dealt quite a hand in this life.  You should know that famous and historic people have acheived with less than you have now.  You can do it, if you want to.  <br>  <br>  You are lumping together a whole lot of issues, and that can feel ovewhelming.  Work on one thing at a time. Rome wasn't built in a day.  Don't worry about what your sister gets or what your mom thinks.  They are more supportive than you realize.  It all begins with you. What do YOU want to do.  How can YOU get there?  You get out of life what you put into it.  If you go in with a defeatest attitude, you will only recognize defeat because it's what you expect.<br>  <br>  Think about success as if it has already happened.  Put in the time to get your grades up.  Spend time doing what you love, whether it brings you money or not.  Where you live now, what you are doing now...it's all temporary.  If you want things to change for the better, then you have to make that change happen.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|0ET70Xytaa	join a dance class. it sounds stupid but really, it will get you out meeting people, and dancing can help you become more fit. and working out releases endorphins, endorphins make you happy. plus some studies suggest that the healthier you are the clearer you mind can be. so you could better focus, and raise that gpa.<br>  <br>  so you'll have more confidence <br>  <br>  be more social<br>  <br>  be fitter<br>  <br>  healthier<br>  <br>  smarter<br>  <br>  happier<br>  <br>  all from taking a dance class:)|`|6RjBfUqtaa	I like the dance class idea. SOunds practical. CHeer up tho. Ya make me sad. I gotta go to a state funded drug rehab center on Monday from anywhere to 30 to 120 days. Im like your SH*tty neighbor mom. But its no life to be envious of. She prolly miserable. YOu seem really smart. Maybe you just have problems letting people see that in social situations. Your mentality is not that of a 12yr old. You seem painfully honest about your situation and a little hopeless and down on your self. I think thats the main thing. You gotta get out of yourself. Dont do drugs like me and the crap neighbor. NO no, that will put you back in the hospital with more problems to add to that novel you wrote up there. Hobbies with a social surrounding but something peaceful. SO wait. No dance class. HOw are ya gonna dance when ya can't even speak in front of people. Try something like philosophy, or poetry where people can see how smart you are on your time. through your writing. which has revealed you to me in the midst of my own drug crazed madness. <br>  I am facing a life of mental disease as well. I am inspired by famous old skool people in history who had mental disease. I think Einstein was born without the front of his brain. Today, I saw a movie on a German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche who wrote his best work in the last 10 yrs of his life, which were also the most maddened years from incurable syphilis. They say his dad was mad to?  IDK?   Vincent Van Gogh was mad as SH*t. He'd put his paint brush in his mouth and drunk on some crazy liquor which gave him led poisoning and drunken hallucinations. Which are never good. I think he cut his ear off after a fight with a friend. Absurd.  I am real scared bout Monday but trying to stay positive about it. I dont wanna go kicking and screaming I feel demeaned enough. SO get a hobby and cheer up. Get out of that house. And quit kickin crap up in your brain as best ya can, Being mad is not so bad. Real genius is linked to it.Ignorance is bliss.Good luck|`|hpveJXu7aa	I was just like you when I was 20 years old!  Exactly like you. I hated everything about my life and I thought that it would stay that way forever. But guess what?  It didn't! In fact, I even made up my own saying: "Discontent is the precursor to achievement."  <br>  <br>  There is nothing wrong with taking Zoloft or Risperdal as long as you need them. If they helped you, you might want to reconsider your decision to stop taking them, but that's between you and your doctor. Years ago, people who had these issues that we share had no choice but to feel lousy. Science has given us medicine which can greatly help us see the light of day. Consider taking advantage of it.<br>  <br>  There's another thing that you need to know. Everybody has problems, and not just little problems, either. Some people are better at hiding them than others, but we're all in the same boat. The good thing about you is that you have a vision! Yes, a vision of a better future! You have already taken steps towards achieving it by thinking that you want better. <br>  <br>  So, what is your plan? What can you do to get yourself started on your better life? Stop thinking about "escaping" your situation; you have to earn your way out of it. Most all of us start on the bottom rung of the ladder...what will you do to get to the next rung? <br>  <br>  You are a great writer and are obviously intelligent; this causes you frustration because you aren't living in a place that enables you to exercise your brilliant mind, but don't ever think, even for a minute, that you don't have the power to make a great life for yourself, because I can see that you do. Good luck, and enjoy the journey.|`|vv44CfWtaa	it sounds like your parents arent very supportive.<br>  you do have a life.<br>  you will make something of yourself.<br>  dont let your disability get you down.<br>  se a therapest.<br>  go  to places where you can socalize.<br>  you can do it!<br>  i believe in you<br>  xoxo mon
RXI8ImdIaa	It's possible that you are misdiagnosed or that your prescription is too strong. Those are always going to be side effects, but if you are losing weight due to metabolism and not eating, that's not good.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure about the craving of cigarettes. Adderall is a stimulant, and so is nicotine, so I suppose it could trigger that. Also if it makes you manic, you might be likely to do self-destructive things like smoking and other things.|`|LKIhUMCgaa	i'm sry to say, but u don't have ADHD lol if u did, those pills wouldn't make u feel that way. for people who don't have ADHD, the prescription that's given for it makes u feel like u're on 'speed' (drug) it makes u super hyper and u loose appetite, it makes ur body feel like u're having an anxiety attack which is why u want a cigarette. i used to take those pills from a friend who had ADHD and that's exactly how they made me feel.

QxIhMHwAaa	I've never had any broken blood vessels after having an ultrasound done. Are you sure they are broken blood vessels and maybe not a rash due to the gel they used? If you are concerned about what is happening, the best thing to do, of course, is call the place where you had the procedure done and ask them about it.
8OqdoIHtaa	Probably not on its own. If you can keep it elevated it might help it go down, but as soon as you quit it will probably swell up again. <br>  <br>  Charcot foot doesn't get better on its own. Sometimes surgery is needed, but not for swelling. <br>  <br>  Try to keep your feet up as much as you can. <br>  <br>  Keep your blood sugar under better control. High blood sugar damaged the nerves and blood vessels in the feet and all through the body. This is what leads to Charcot Foot in the first place. <br>  <br>  You can't reverse the damage, but you might be able to slow it down if you get your blood sugar under better control. <br>  <br>  Read about treatment here... <br>  <a href="http://www.footphysicians.com/footankleinfo/charcot-foot.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.footphysicians.com/footanklei...</a><br>  <br>  According to this website, you might need a cast to help reduce the swelling and allow the bones to heal.

zpovg4U7aa	You should target muscles on different days; for example, work on your upper body muscles monday, wednesday, friday, then work on your lower body muscles tuesday, thursday, and saturday. Of course, not exactly like that but it's good to target different muscles, and it'll give you more benefits if you aren't working on the same muscles every day (it'll actually hurt you in the long run).<br>  <br>  Building muscles will eventually lead to burning more calories at a resting status (also known as RMR - resting metabolic rate, which is how many calories you burn if you were just lying around the entire day doing absolutely nothing), so it'll definitely help on the losing weight part, BUT...<br>  <br>  a lot of guys (including a lot of my guy friends who i annoy the crap out of every once in awhile to get them to do cardio) just lift and rarely do cardio because "they hate it." it's bad to build muscles without working on your cardio. To carry all that extra weight and to have all those muscles to distribute energy to without a good healthy heart to support it? doesn't sound very good. I would say at LEAST run fifteen or twenty minutes. start out by walking and jogging if you hate running.<br>  <br>  if you do like cardio, then that's wonderful! do cardio every other day. also, if you are eating a healthy diet with enough protein (don't overload on protein!) - of course along with all the other nutrients, you'll be losing weight in no time. but remember that muscle weighs slightly more than fat and although the scale may tell you a slow weight-losing process, you're probably really losing a lot of fat and gaining a lot of muscles. muscle weighs more but takes up less space on your body so you'll be looking great in no time. 165 for a 6'0'' sounds very good. to me 175 - 180 doesn't sound too bad either actually but it depends on what you're made of (muscles or fat)<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|n7KCez59aa	Hi !<br>  <br>  I ran into this great site that is full of info on how to build muscle, loose weight and how much protein and water you need everyday based on your weight.|`|8SRjELNBaa	Don't be so concerned about what the scale says.  The way you build muscle & lose fat is by doing cardio, weights & eating nutritious (lots of protein) and creating a calorie deficit.<br>  <br>  Listen to this, i've been doing exactly what your question says, "building muscle & losing weight", i was 210, lost 20 lbs, i'm 187 now, 19 y/o, 5"6'.  I've been 187 for the last 5 weeks, but my upper body has become immensely developed and my waist has lost a significant amount of inches.  You don't want to be concerned about what the scale says because it doesn't accurately depict how your body is changing. Muscle weights more than fat.|`|VJsOvAecaa	you run or exercise, you gain muscle.........and as muscle burns more calories, you can easily lose weight by counting calories.

Vjyzfnpraa	First allow me to state that I am no psychiatrist, nor am I a counselor, but I have dealt with this kind of a thing before with friends of mine. I stumbled upon this question while doing a search and thought I'd give some insight to help you out. Because it sounds like you need someone who can listen.<br>  <br>  As far as your scholarship, that is great that you have gotten that. Not everyone is lucky enough to get a free college ride. I would venture a guess that at least 95% of all college students end up with student loan debts after college, sometimes even loooong after graduating. Which would be more stressfull, being in debt or trying to maintain a free ride? Something to think about.<br>  <br>  I can't really judge your family based on what little you stated about them, but they seem to be the type that wants to get out of you what they could not receive themselves. It is selfish for anyone to think that way and you need to constantly remind them of that.<br>  <br>  As far as airsoft goes, I am heavily into airsoft as well, but my parents don't care that I'm into it. I think it's all in how you use a hobby such as airsoft. For example, I got into airsoft with a couple of my friends, and instead of just shooting stuff at home I go to an airsoft arena with my friends so as not to bother my parents with it. They know I do it just for fun, and unless you present yourself as someone who might go postal on the turn of a dime, you know, it's a whole different story and yes, then your parents might feel the need to take that hobby away. Just remind them that airsoft guns are a great way to relieve stress in a safe way (safer than real guns anyway).<br>  <br>  Cutting is NOT a healthy way to release stress and anger. I wish it would be easy to tell you to stop, but I know in my own mind that a choice like that is something that cannot be undone over night. I have no idea what it is like to go through something like that, but I just don't see how leaving scars will help in the future when you REALLY wont want any reminders of the past. Do you really want reminders of what you went through?<br>  <br>  Reading your last paragraph, I guess I may have been confused, are you in college or high school? Either way, my advice would be the same no matter what age you are. Wanting to be a kid again is something that is human nature to want while going into adulthood. What I like to do is collect old tv shows that I used to watch and it really calms me down if I'm ever upset. Find things to preoccupy your mind (in a safe way), and yes it will be a long road before you become independent, but once you're there you will be glad you made it through.<br>  <br>  Well, take my advice with the utmost care and don't EVER hurt yourself or anyone else to overcome stress and anger, there are plenty of outlets that are safe and effective, you just have to find what that is for you. I think you had the right idea with the airsoft, but you might just have a sit down with your parents and discuss the positives about it. Working out is probably THE best thing you could do other than airsoft. You will keep in shape and it is a great way to vent.<br>  <br>  I really hope this helps, I mean well and hope you do well in school.
ZaadvJAXaa	No, Bio Oil does not work.  You are not the only female on the planet to have stretch marks, nor will you be the last to get them.  The truth is, nothing will get rid of them, but most times, they will fade.|`|U3jS5k9eaa	Bio oil is probably the best thing you can use for stretch marks but you ll find that almost every girl has them and its just your body turning into a women, you will learn to love them, all of them...lol :)|`|OWdcFeDmaa	i had this when i started growing. <br>  <br>  its because you've grown so quickly your skin hasnt had time to grow with them quick enough however it will disappear eventually. you can help it by using things such as cocoa butter and massaging your breasts. this will soften up the skin and make it less uncomfortable and relieve some of the stretching helping the marks disappear quicker.|`|2d816c77eede591fdea222c195ddd638aa	theres nothing you can do for stretch marks the mark will fade and become silvery grey use vit e cream and bio oil to improve appearnce even fake tan can make them less noticible|`|snXlNgldaa	I have them on my boobs too!<br>  to be honest it doesnt bother me they are<br>  not that noticable!!

lNsr26oIaa	I'd let him watch it. If that makes him happy, so be it. Nobody on the screen touches the sex he has with you- you are the one who shares his bed. So I don't see a reason to be jealous or feel inadequate. <br>  <br>  But, if watching makes you uncomfortable, don't. He has no right to make you do anything that makes you feel uncomfortable. Next time he says that porn is education, counter with "experience is education." <br>  <br>  I think the two of you can compromise on this one. He watches. You don't .|`|U49FhI05aa	U r over reacting.Just let him see after few days he will get bored and disgusting with that things.If he is good man then dont break ur relation ship with this type of silly things.|`|BRFkc8pBaa	Hell no. If you're not cool with it then tell him. Quite honestly I would be upset if my boyfriend was looking at porn on his own time not to mention if he asked me to do it with him. Tell him how you feel.<br>  <br>  And let him know if he wants to jack off to some other chick that he can go be with some other chick. Also the whole I'm a guy excuse is bullshit too. Let him know over 50% of women cheat on their boyfriends/husbands so if he wants to play that one...<br>  <br>  You don't need that bullshit. Porn is gross. Why would you want to fantasize if you've got the real thing. Because you're unsatisfied or your a sicko loser. Guys do tend to have a weirder side like that then girls do, after all I'm sure the percentage of girls that masturbate to the percentage of men is ridiculous. <br>  <br>  Tell him you want 5 good *** reasons he wants to watch it:<br>  <br>  And being a guy doesn't count as one. That's bullshit because there are plenty of guys that think its just as disgusting as I do.<br>  <br>  Or if you really want to **** with him watch one with him and the ask him why he doesn't do you like that? Or why isn't he that big?|`|l7GjBVvhaa	It is normal for men and women to watch porn. Some of it is fun and educational. Ha. Maybe try finding one that turns you on to watch; like one with a fetish of yours in it or type of men you like. Watching porn with your bf turns him on, in this particular case. He is not thinking of the others bodies or anything, he is getting turned on by YOU watching it with him. If it is such a great concern for you to watch with him let him know how it makes you feel unsexy and such. He may not fully understand you feel this way. Also do remember he chose you to have sex with. He chose you to look for a place with and pick rings out with. He chose you! Be glad he is open with his like of porn and that he watches with you. A lot of men sneak it around their lady's back and watch alone. If you just don't get through to him about how unsexy it makes you feel to see this girls, pick out a porn on your own with guys who are very unlike him and watch it with him. Let him realize how you feel. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  be seeing you....|`|hyhAKawlaa	Let him watch if it's his thing but make it clear it's not for you.

4jqNWRAuaa	Without examining you it is difficult to tell the exact cause, but generally speaking pain in and around the hip joint can be referred from the lower back, or related to the hip itself.it is possible that your hip pain is related to 'wear & tear' in the lower spine.This can irritate nerves as they come out from the spinal cord on their journey down into the lower limbs, the pain being felt at hip level. the pain is due to the hip, it is most likely related to osteoarthritis of the joint. Another cause of pain in this region is inflammation of the soft tissues surrounding the joint, which can lead to the swelling of a small bag of fluid or 'bursa'. This condition is known as trochanteric bursiti'|`|AA11484395	Stop wearing high heeled shoes. If you wear wedge shoes or shoes with high soles or heels, stop. They may make your calves look pretty, but they are tearing your back and spine to pieces. Something Prada doesn't put in the brochures. High heels make your lower spine arch inward, and then you pound away walking around like that. Not good. You need good fitting, much lower heeled shoes with great arch support and padding for the ball of the foot, and heel. This is the most common reason why our hips and lower backs start to hurt. <br>  Poor abdominal tone can make the problem worse. If you have a muffin top tummy, it would be best to work it off. The tougher the abs, the tougher your lower spine. Good luck, sorry you hurt.
I0rOL46aaa	It's probably a dislocated shoulder.  You can talk to your doctor, and he'll either set up an x-ray to see if there's anything wrong with the bones, or set up an appointment with someone involved in sports massage, they're trained to help 'massage' joints back into place.  In the mean time, follow RICE:<br>  Rest the limb<br>  Ice the place that hurts, then alternate with heat<br>  Compression using a tensor bandage (difficult as it's shoulder)<br>  Elevation *again, hard because it's a shoulder but if you can make sure there's a pillow under it a lot it should help*|`|unBDeZ8Caa	You should go to your doctor or the hospital for an x-ray.you may just have a bad strain or worse.For now you can take something for pain and put ice on on your shoulder/neck to ease the pain.Hope your pain is gone soon.|`|YVdFlvIoaa	It sounds like a dislocated shoulder or a broken collarbone to me. Please go to the ER immediately.|`|lFrJ6hqNaa	you need to see a Doctor to be sure|`|1GzmHZcfaa	Sometimes if you have a minor tear, the pain takes a day or two to hit. I was in a minor fender bender once and I wasn't aware of getting any injury the day of, but a day later my jaw was excruciating. For my injury, my doctor recommended 10 days of Advil (it's an anti-inflammatory as well as a painkiller, so it actually aids in the healing process) and ice on the muscle for 20 minutes a day. That cleared it up nicely.<br>  <br>  Whatever you do, rest the muscle as much as possible! You don't want to be irritating it further, regardless of what the nature of the injury is. If it's not better in a week or two, you might have to go see a doc.

Like tea, water, instant oatmeal, and Saltine crackers.<br>  <br>  If you can drive or walk to a store, buy some popsicles and watch T.V. or pick out a movie. These things can be soothing, and generally take your mind off of being sick.<br>  <br>  It's really important that you drink liquids, since you are fighting a virus and is losing lots of body fluid going to the bathroom and everything.

XS5CfmAMaa	There are many types of infections that affect only the inside eyelid, not the eye itself.  Your symptoms sound like GPC, which is an inflammation of the inside surface of your eyelid.  It could also simply be a stye that is just forming or is too deep for you to see the pustule. <br>  <br>  Long story short, your eye problem will probably not go away by itself, and will likely stay the same or get worse.

I have wanted to die many times, but something kept me going. <br>  <br>  The thought of leaving my family to wonder what they did to me to make me hurt myself kept me from doing it.  I couldn't hurt them in that way.  I later learned how painful it would have been to them, because I had a friend who committed suicide.  She reached out to me when I was away one weekend.

AA11388527	Masturbation has never been an infectious disease, it doesn't make one sick but chronic or rough masturbation can cause minor trauma to the penis with small amounts of blood in the urine.  This heals quickly.|`|AA11004428	i'm pretty sure you cant get sick but i think it causes you to go blind!!|`|ZAjlZEXAaa	You can't get sick, except if your place is cold, masturbating gets you warmer and then you get out too soon you can catch a cold.<br>  It's not very healthy for the heart if you friend does it all the time, that's all.|`|S3lvnRwfaa	No, masturbation won't make you sick - whether you are male or female.  Make sure that you don't cause yourself any physical injury, of course - be as gentle with yourself as you would with somebody else!|`|OWwAwcFWaa	hahahahaha<br>  the things we hear these days<br>  masturbation never and will never make you sick<br>  we all would have died if masturbation does make one sick|`|CwXYQHqmaa	Naw you won't get sick, if anything your arm might get a little stronger.
w6QXlMP1aa	its almost impossible to bulk and cut at the same time.  <br>  <br>  if you feel like you've added enough bulk, get on a cuting diet (keep your lifting the same) but add in 2 days of HIIT per week.  <br>  <br>  i've found BCAA's help minimise muscle loss when i get in to a calorie deficit.  <br>  <br>  if you're not ready to cut...carry on bulking until you are!|`|kv8KkOM8aa	is it even possible to get bulk while being defined?|`|S8Fhbvu7aa	When weightlifting there's a rule for bulking up and toning up. High repetition, low weight for toning up and high weight, low repetition for bulking up. Try doing a weight or two below what you usually do and try doing 15-20 reps on that weight, it won't feel like much but you're trying to define not bulk so your muscles wont be straining too much.
v2J0ooWKaa	i think you should go to ymca and ask them
rpnFxnCQaa	I can relate to anxiety. It seems this is what you have had but to get an accurate diagnosis, I think you should see a doctor.<br>  <br>  I had anxiety attacks when I had to speak in public. Or when there would be more than a few people around me in the same room. It was something that started when I was a teenager and that lasted over years and subsequently affected my career until not so long ago. <br>  <br>  At some point, I was prescribed medicine but I wanted to avoid that (because of side effects). That's when I discovered a program that literally pulled me out of that "hole". It is a 100% natural method. You should tackle the problem as soon as possible so you may want to give it a try before the problem repeats itself. But again, that should not prevent you from seeing a doctor anyway.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|jcL7gDMKaa	Yes this sounds very much like an anxiety attack, you did handle it very well though! Well done. I used to suffer from severe anxiety and was signed off work for almost 2 years with it. the worst thing you can do is worry about it getting worse. I would suggest just keep everything the same as much as you can and handle it the way you did. Taking deep breaths and then exhaling slowly will help calm you down when you feel it starting. I use this technique allot. There are medications you can take such as beta blockers which help deal with the physical symptoms like palpatations, fast heart rate etc. But if you can manage without them then this is better. Anxiety is basically caused from a build up of excessive stress. try to do things to relax yourself as often as you can. Also avoid caffeine, high sugar food and drinks, and alcohol as these are all stimulants which will make it worse.|`|6f859308d85888cab3c6223b3e599d1baa	It could be. Those are some of the symptoms that come with an anxiety attack.  BUT, with all you've been through and the meds you are on, it's time to go see a doc.  The irregular heartbeat is a red flag.|`|4xBBrPitaa	It sounds like you were in shock and had an attack of some sort.<br>  Go see a physician about those heart beats.|`|OgaJqkSQaa	Have a check up at the dr, but it sounds like anxiety. If you've suffered a miscarriage recently it would cause a lot of stress, as that's a tough thing to go through.<br>  It's really important to eat well during periods of anxiety, as the adrenaline burns off energy more quickly, so you need good food to make up for this. If I skip a meal it also actually causes me to have anxiety, so there is a strong link between anxiety and nutrition.
jo9p0jBwaa	well basically there has been a change in pressure, similar to when your ears pop on a plane. you could wait it out, or just head on over to the doctor and they can probably do something for you. it may even be that you have a wax build up deep inside your ear causing this, and they can remove that for you.|`|1oNi2v38aa	I don't know how to fix it, but I would suggest you let it go. It will probably correct itself overnight as it has for me.|`|DhcQC9DBaa	give it time, <br>  or it could be a perferated ear drum but i doubt it cause it takes alot to do that.  nah i would say give it time.|`|82SQnfJlaa	keep trying to yawn, and try making thaat ear pop<br>  if nothing helps have a doc check it out & theyll fix it :]<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AtPj0kSPaSBxqIqf_2Fie0Lsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090220140845AAx6plv">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|G2lO32xpaa	I had the same, but I waited and then it passed... <br>  <br>  Well there is nothing you can do, just wait..|`|DKDkXgfOaa	There's water in your ears or ear.<br>  Or its from a higher climate..|`|3CgtetyGaa	your ear is stopped up|`|lzRQJCeeaa	try to unpop your ear<br>  once when i was little i was cleaning my ears, then i think i went to deep and hit my ear drum than i couldn't hear anything,<br>  maybe try to unpop it by eating um or dipping your ear in the water by dipping your head side ways so the water doesn't go in your ear,<br>  or just get use to it than a couple days later it will stop|`|ckMA5RhOaa	drip warm olive oil into your ear and let set 10-20 min. then flush out wit warm water and an ear bulb (like the little thing to such out a baby's nose) the ear bulb is also great if you get water in your ear...just blow in a little air...it's fixed!!|`|PERkl0Kvaa	You should go to the doctor or go to the store and by some medicine what you do is you tilt your head and put the Liquid in you ear it unplugs it and you will notice a different's.

DsLx6Sixaa	It depends alot on the airplane. Remember that often pets and other livestock are carried in the same compartment as luggage, so the temperature can not be too different than in the passenger compartment.<br>  <br>  But if it is a tiny plane the luggage compartment might not have temperature control.<br>  <br>  My suggestion is to call your airline and ask them the temperature of the baggage compartment. My guess is that your birth control pills are fine. But just to be 100% sure you might want to back it up with an additional female contraceptive (Sponge, female condom, etc) for a month or so....|`|bmWKETgWaa	I always thought that the luggage compartment got pretty cold, rather than hot, especially at this time of year.<br>  <br>  It's a reasonable question.  Call up Ortho and ask them.  Better allow plenty of time to work through their automatic telephone tree until you reach a real live expert.|`|fcfbd387aa	You sound like a pretty sophisticated women from the hours of travel by plane and your firm grasp of science.  I would recommend using some sort of backup method (such as condoms), but such a classy woman probably has an ultra virile super-hunk too potent to be stopped by barrier methods of birth control.<br>  <br>  You should be absolutely certain that your pills are doing the job.
ZLrxqGT5aa	nope it can't go anywhere because the cervix (opening to the uterus) will stop it and the string is supposed to hang out that much. just remember not to use a tampon for more than 8 hours in a day. <br>  : )|`|BcwIl0UAaa	no tampons cannot float up your body. The tubes are much to small for the tampon to squeeze through, and if you think you saw less string hanging out, you are either just imagining it, or maybe it scooted up a little bit when you sat down or something. Hope I helped <br>  :D The girl Next Door :D|`|oUROoFC3aa	it cannot float all the way up into your body because there is a certain extent it can only go.<br>  and do not leave a tampon in for  A FEW DAYS!!<br>  you must chage it every 3 hours or else you will get toxic shock syndrome
48SKEteeaa	No, I don't think so. It's unusual for sure but whatever spins your wheel I guess. It will become a problem if she starts having little chats with her imaginary friends at work, school, or in other public places. Sometimes these "friends" tell people to commit illegal or immoral acts. If this happens then she's got a really serious problem. Either way your friend is not quite right in the head but as long as she can function in the real world and she does not hurt others or herself then it's ok. She's just a bit mental is all.|`|XlGjBPBTaa	Not to me.  if you isolate a lot or hae few friends it is often easy to start talking to yourself or others who may or may not truly exist.<br>  The difference is knowing reality from fantasy.<br>  If you know you are OK.  If you do not know; then you are probably mentally ill.|`|iIFTPRZzaa	This is one sign of many disorders like Schizophrenia. Not saying she has it lol but keep an eye on her. Disorders like these usually start around ages 15-22, and I don't know what age she is, so you be the judge.|`|1oNi2v38aa	As long as they don't tell her to kill people.|`|ZXvApLQcaa	The answer to this depends on a few things. Is your friend a young child with a still-developing mind, or is your friend already an adolescent or adult?<br>  <br>  It's normal for little children to have imaginary friends, but older people who engage in conversations with individuals who do not exist may be suffering from psychological issues, such as is schizophrenia.|`|hyr3xylLaa	No, I do all the time. <br>  WAIT, WAIT, what I mean was I acknowledge they are not real and no, they don't talk back. <br>  Your friend is normal, it's like the way you talk to a dog. You know they can't understand you but you do it anyway.|`|YvadCZMTaa	its not weird if its in your head i have fantasy's every now and then but if it looks like shes talking to her self there,s a good chance shes a skitso rinik|`|VjyCjdHjaa	No, but it would be much weirder if she actually indtroduces you to them.|`|2nsNvIanaa	can i av some of the drugs she is on pls.|`|SltEwVX7aa	in a way, it's no different than talking to a cat or a dog.  and people do that.|`|IFd94XDkaa	As long as she doesn't think they're talking back to her and she understand that they aren't real I don't see as that much different than me talking to my dog, which I do a lot when I'm home alone.
N3xdqu7laa	I don't know but I really think this is a question for Google to answer, not Y!A.<br>  People on here tend to give crappy answers in relation to medical issues, but on Google you can find information from real doctors on medical websites.<br>  <br>  The only advice I can give is bluish colour in toes, fingers, lips etc. usually means bad circulation, which leads to lack of oxygen in blood. Oxygen is carried by RED blood cells, so naturally when there isn't enough in a certain area that area will turn purple or blue.<br>  <br>  If bad circulation is what is causing the discolouration, I still think you should hop on Google and find out what may be causing the bad circulation.<br>  <br>  Do you have any other symptoms?|`|TwVd0etQaa	Lack of iron in the blood causes a condition, Anemia. To know if you have it, pull your bottom eyelid and look at the colour, if its pale then call your doctors or alternatively start taking iron supplements. You would also be very tierd all the time. I dont think that your fingers would turn a bluish colour because of it, that sounds more of an circulation problem

7eb3fd3226605d4f11ad285a2b5a5ab4aa	Some forms of breast cancer are reactive to hormones.<br>  <br>  If you are diagnosed with one of these forms, than you are usually given medication (in the form of tablets) to reduce the levels of these hormones in your system and thus reduce the risk of the cancer getting hold again.<br>  <br>  Usually this is continued for 5 years as the medical evidence at this time shows this can reduce risk of recurrence.  Some early studies are now starting to show some benefit of increasing this period to 10 years but until this is proved, these drugs will not be funded for the longer period.|`|HumMEMu5aa	You are referring to hormone therapy, which has been proven to prolong life in clinical trials.<br>  <br>  However, side effects from these drugs are sometimes nasty - so if anyone is taking them, look on the website HAVING FUN AFTER CANCER www.after-cancer.com, which gives medically-approved products and therapies (all nice) that help patients.<br>  <br>  Verite R|`|plQDCJYCaa	If you find out you have it in the very early stages you can get rid of it.|`|AA12066269	Not everyone who has been diagnosed with breast cancer needs to take the pills (Tamoxifen/Herceptin).

However, my friend has been taking Tamoxifen for several years.|`|AA11020187	This is hormone therapy.

Y4ogWjHOaa	Hi random person,<br>  <br>  Bruising is caused by bleeding under the skin. You have hit the bone which will hurt but you didn't cause any bleeding under the skin which is why there is no bruise.<br>  <br>  When we bruise, it isn't actually the bruise that is hurting but the underlying injury to the bone. Because a bruise forms it is generally thought that it is that which causes the pain but it isn't.<br>  <br>  You have got the pain which was caused by hitting it but have no bruise because there is no bleeding, or if there is it is slow to do so. You may well have a bruise in a few days.<br>  <br>  Love Mel.X|`|lHJlwuqBaa	You probably have an interior, or deep tissue bruise, close to the bone.  Just put ice on it for 15-20 minutes, a few times a day, for a couple of days.  After 48 hours, switch to heat, probably a heating pad.  Meanwhile, take some asprin, Tylenol or Advil, but don't exceed recommended dosage or frequency.  In time it should be back to normal. If it doesn't get better soon, you should see a doctor.  Good luck and God bless!!

If you want to lose weight, you should also eat right, not just exercise or else it will have very little effect. You can run all you want, but if you eat nothing but butter then you won't lose weight at all. Diet is a major contributor to weight loss, so if you don't eat right, then it is for nothing.|`|7gjQvhYbaa	It will help you lose calories,<br>  for example, if you ate an apple (about 100 calories) you would burn it off after using your treadmill. Calories turn to fat if you don't burn them off, <br>  so................<br>  <br>  Yes you are losing weight|`|lcfnIDF2aa	Yes, any type of exercise will help but try walking a little faster or if you’re working out on a treadmill put if on an incline. That will help you with your weight loss goals quicker.

wGTisY1aaa	You cannot just do sit-ups to help get rid of love handles or make your stomach flat, and you cannot get thinner thighs by just doing workouts for your thighs. If you were to look at a muscle anatomy picture, you will find that what we call love handles are simply our gluteus medius which goes up and connects to the external obliques and goes down to and forms the gluteus maximus which is connected to your lats. Doing the following will help with the entire area to tighten and tone up your muscles and help burn the fat around them.

B4nujMnlaa	It's not bad for him, just a bad habit. My theory is this: Put a band-aid on  the finger he picks his nose with. Make sure the band-aid is extra large like this kind:<br>  <a href="http://comps.fotosearch.com/comp/BDX/BDX128/band-aids_~bxp28226.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://comps.fotosearch.com/comp/BDX/BDX...</a><br>  (The very largest one) And wrap it around his finger. Make sure it's kind of bulky.<br>  When he goes to pick his nose, he can't fit his finger inside!<br>  I did this with my little sister, she doesn't pick her nose anymore.<br>  If that doesn't work, tell him there's a big slug with a thousand sharp teeth up in his nose and if he keeps picking his nose, it will bite his finger off.|`|ELSKfMpxaa	It's not going to hurt him. I'm 20 and I still pick sometimes (like if I'm alone and have no tissue but have a boogie stabbing me) just tell him its disgusting and embarrass him with it and he'll stop doing it in front of you<br>  <br>  Edit: The only time it's bad is if he has nails or has low iron levels in his blood he can cause a nose bleed. My older sister had that issue when we were little. She'd pick in her sleep then wake up with blood all over the place|`|3NDR9nvFaa	1.) no, it's not a bad a habbit<br>  <br>  2.) force him into wearing mittens, that way he cant pick his nose. do this long enough and maybe he'll stop..? haha|`|d573b9bde3a327e77424db30de81f60aaa	Put some red chilly paste on his fingers..|`|Z9kCzIkyaa	its not bad at all. very natural. just telll him him its gross. lol|`|1oNi2v38aa	It's not bad for him, it's a bad habit though.

df6e5b1a8d31db24d73d45f4db076d71aa	Ovarian follicles are where little dormant 'oocytes' (underdeveloped eggs) develop into mature eggs.  When we are born, our left and right ovaries are filled with thousands and thousands of oocytes, which are found within the 'primary follicles' of the ovary.  Once we hit puberty, USUALLY once a month ONE of the ovaries will start to produce a secondary follicle - and the oocyte within that follicle starts to develop into the mature egg.  The mature egg erupts from the ovary during ovulation and gets directed into the fallopian tube where it'll be fertilized if conditions are right.  In some cases, women start to produce more than one secondary follicle - often in each of the ovaries (rather than just one ovary).  This produces TWO mature eggs each month, which increases the chance of fraternal twins.   This is what I think you have!  Should you try to conceive, you may have a higher chance of a multiple birth.<br>  <br>  Cheers!

BNAzjSO1aa	I suggest that you need to seek medical help from your doctor as you do not say if you had any treatment for your UTI and it sounds like it possibly was not completely cured and has now spread up the urinary tract and started spreading to your kidneys hence the back pain. Get medical advice as soon as possible.|`|GfG6wupTaa	The back pain is probably your kidney. Your uti is probably now a kidney infection, and you better get it treated. I did the same thing as you, and wound up in the hospital.|`|rcPdEOHKaa	Hey,<br>  Have you tried cranberry?  Not cranberry juice cocktail but the real thing?  Either in pill form or in the juice, you need at least 8 oz. per day.  There are also natural antibiotics at the health food store but go personally and ask them they generally do not answer questions over the phone.  These remedies take a while too just like the ones from your dr so don't be discouraged!
AA11432707	CALL YOUR SURGEON.  If there's an anesthesia related problem he/she will refer you to the anesthesia department for followup.<br>  <br>  Looks like it may be a drug reaction.

If you don't have one, go back to the hospital where this was performed. <br>  <br>  If you're not getting help from them, try a different doctor. I don't like to recommend frivolous lawsuits, but it sounds like maybe this place did not take good care of you and might have faked some paperwork concerning discharging you. You might want to consult with a medical lawyer.That's a big guess, but, I'm suspicious.

p6XPhIxnaa	well I have some good news go buy some kind of lotion for reduce stretchmarks and as long as the stretch marks are still red or purple ish you can diminish and even almost erase them, that torn tissue is scar and it can live up to 5 years!

Insecurity is the number 1 thing on a man's turn off list.|`|zpovg4U7aa	There are very good stretch mark medications lately that will get rid of it. First try this cream called "Mederma" it is specialized for stretch marks, scars, and post-acne scars. It is less expensive than the ones you can get at professional cosmetic centers. You can get Mederma at a drugstore.<br>  <br>  That'll most likely take away the darker scarrings and fade the stretch marks a bit. Since you say you have so many that a deep and long, if after Mederma, you feel it wasn't strong enough I would recommend Klein Becker's StriVectin-SD. It's about $135; they are available at Sephora or some department stores like Macy's. You probably hate me for recommending such an expensive product but my cousin has used it and claims that it really did work for her.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps. :) I think mostly it's about how you feel about them. You seem very conscious about it, so try these products (or if you find out about any better products that maybe aren't so expensive, try those!) and I'm sure they will help because there are SO many good products for stretch marks out there. As long as you feel comfortable it's fine. But it sounds like you're self-conscious so I recommend these products to you. :) It's okay to be self-conscious. We all have something, and this happens to be yours - that's okay, and hey - at least it's something you can treat :)|`|5fuFXlyIaa	Most men are capable of understanding about body flaws, at some point most of them have been around someone with them. There are plenty of people in this world who will love and accept you just as you are. I have stretch marks (from 3 kids) all over and I got divorced and remarried to a wonderful guy who accepts my marks and weight and kids. So don't worry about this okay? Accept them as part of who you are and find some things you like about yourself and focus on showing that off. You are Beautiful!

But that's because most people blow. My boyfriend grew really quickly however and he has stretch marks on his sides and arms. Not real bad, but they're still there. I don't mind them. I probably would have noticed them earlier on but we were always friends so I guess I just saw past them.<br>  <br>  Which is exactly the type of guy every girl needs. One that looks past things. If he doesn't care about stupid little vain things like that, he's a keeper.<br>  <br>  And I know that you're thinking yeah well any guy like that is going to be butt-***-ugly but I disagree. I see unattractive women with good-looking me and vice-versa all the time. I'm not saying your unattractive however, I'm just pointing out that if they can pull it off and they're completely flawed, your one flaw will be okay.<br>  <br>  Most guys act like they want some dumb, "hot" bimbo, but in reality they want a woman they trust and get a long with. And most of them go long-term with a down-to-earth girl than some blonde hoe they're looking to score with.<br>  <br>  In fact, if you see some girl that you think is "wow, i bet every guy wants to do her!" chances are every guy sees that too and that's not really what they want.|`|p93GnJzbaa	it's okay, and it's not that gross. i have stretch marks too but mine are on my chest. it's prevented me from wearing ceratin tops and bathing suits. needless to say, i haven't let a guy get close enough to inspect them because i'm embarassed.<br>  <br>  i honestly don't know what guys would think of your stretch marks but i think that if he really likes you then it shouldn't matter. <br>  <br>  I feel you pain though. it's stupid things like this that make us so uncomfortable with our bodies that we end up hating ourselves when we should appreciate the fact that we don't have brain cancer or something.<br>  <br>  don't stress about it too much. that's my only advice.
GLx35x33aa	you should be using all natural soap, preferably organic with Absolutely no chemicals in it, no fragrances etc... and salt water. just mix a little bit of luke warm water and salt. clean your piercing at least 3 x per day for the next 3 weeks or so, then you can just clean it once a day. Nose piercings take a long time to heal so please don't take it out either! (trust me I'vee made this mistake before, you have to re pierce it even if it's only out for 12 hrs.) Don't use anything else except this and some neosporin. also, while this bump is there, don't use any face makeup, or acne creams etc... this should clear it up in a week or two. By the way, it's probably not a blister. I have gotten a few (because I wasn't cleaning right) and of course I tried to pop them and there is just skin under there. It will go down on it's own if you use the organic soap and such.|`|thkNNDHsaa	ITS A BLISTER. TAKE A STERILIZED NEEDLE AND POP IT.

0nyWiro9aa	People don't usually come down with the classic tapeworms from animals. The only way to come down with an actual tapeworm is to ingest the larval stage usually embedded in animal flesh that is eaten raw. So unless you eat your dog raw you won't come down with tapeworms that are very large and the ones you hear about all the time. Those are from beef and pigs. The other is kissing the animal and coming down with a tiny tapeworm of a different kind (Dipylidium canium) that usually comes from fleas. <br>  The other is ecchinococcus which uses man as an intermediate host and the dog is the final host that develops the adult worm. Those are dangerous because of the cyst humans get.|`|zeTGmB3faa	Unless a flea jumped into your mouth that was carrying the tapeworm larvae, you won't get it. Stop worrying. Just about every puppy who has had fleas gets tapeworm. If it was that easy to get from a pet the entire population would have tapeworm. You and the kids don't have it.

Fsq9qvkqaa	Yes, birth control can make your periods lighter, but it doesn't work for everyone.<br>  Just sit down with your mom and be honest. Tell her what your intentions are, and why you plan on taking the birth control.

It really depends on how old you are and how developed your bones are.<br>  <br>  I actually was worried about this for a little..

Check to make sure your form is correct.  Video take yourself if you can, make sure your back isn't rounding on either exercise.

48I58Awsaa	You would need to give some more information.<br>  What's your height and weight?|`|5gG2OfHIaa	My estimate is 600 calories burned on a 7 day per week workout.  I get that number this way:  3,500 calories = 1 pound.  So, as a younger, fit female you get 1,200 calories burned because you should burn 2,400, at least, if you did no exercise. 7 x 1,200= 8,400 calories per week deducted.  Then you burn 600 calories via workout= 4,200 per week.  Add 8,400 and 4,200  to get a 12,600 weekly burn.  Your goal of 5 pounds needs a total burn of 5 x 3,500 or 17,500.  If you add the rise in metabolic rate you should be fine with a 600 calorie workout burn considering age, and existing physical fitness.|`|5nfqY9T7aa	Three.  :/|`|XTfr3uKQaa	Umm..there is no way you can lose 5 pounds a week, unless it's all water weight.<br>  If you are only eating 1200 calories a day and going to the gym 3 times a week you are going to lose weight no matter what. Make a goal like losing 1 pound a week. One pound of actual fat is alot if you think about it. One someone like  you who isnt that big, one pound will actually make a difference. If you try to do something too extreme, your body will freak out and you will likely give up from frustration and food deprivation. <br>  Just keep eating your 1200 a day, and make sure its lots of fruits, veggies, water, protein, and fiber. <br>  About the calories.. try to burn maybe like 600 calories.|`|gjMJzfoeaa	Whatever you eat in excess of the 1200 calories. i.e. you splurge one day on a brownie, but otherwise stuck to your diet.

8OqdoIHtaa	Too much blood, or not enough, also she probably has something on her hands. She needs to wash and dry her hands before each test. <br>  <br>  Even hand lotion or soap can throw it off because they sometimes contain sugar or alcohol.<br>  <br>  Also, if she uses an alcohol swab before testing, she must wait for all the alcohol to dry first. <br>  <br>  She should NOT drag her finger over the strip. She's supposed to let the test strip touch the drop of blood at an angle and suck the blood up. It has to be the right part of the strip too. <br>  <br>  It sounds like her technique needs work and she's probably forcing too much blood into the strip. Tell her the strip needs to be given time to suck up as much blood as it needs and no more. She shouldn't drag it across, she shouldn't be moving it at all. Read the manual and study the pictures and you'll see the difference. <br>  <br>  Ask the company for some testing solution to check the accuracy or your test strips too. Its usually free from the manufacturer. Test it yourself and follow the directions exactly. <br>  <br>  See if you can get a diabetes nurse educator to watch her do a few tests too. <br>  <br>  Some meters depend on light to take the reading and moving them while the meter is working can throw them off. <br>  <br>  If better technique doesn't work, maybe you should try a different brand. I use the Freestyle and its been very reliable.|`|BhFeii5Xaa	failure to rinse hands well and dry them or using alcohol prep pad or having hand lotion on hands will skew the results really badly.<br>  <br>  Suggest you oversee the testing proceedure closely for several times to maybe correct what is happening that is wrong.<br>  <br>  Too much blood doesn't happen! The test strip will hold only so much. But it also "sips" the blood in to the slot.<br>  <br>  Check it out on your own finger. see what it does there.<br>  <br>  I would go freaky if mine said "HI" or anywhere over 200.for that matter.<br>  <br>  What is your little angel eating?|`|B93mt3Dzaa	Just make sure your daughter's hands are clean and dry before she tests her sugar, and that she lets the strip take up the blood. Also note that the higher your blood sugars the more variant the reading is (blood sugar meters are normally good for about a 10% range). Children's blood sugars also tend to vary more than adults simply because their body is smaller and a little bit goes a long way, so to say. I have seen children who eat a small meal and their blood sugar shoots up to a HI reading. <br>  <br>  Also your meter should come with a control solution or there should be one available for your meter. These come in handy to test whether your meter is working properly if you're getting varied blood sugar results.|`|c8ebe8705eaf13a28547213ca1de8013aa	The likelihood of getting two glucometers which produce erroneous results would be essentially zero.  In addition - present day glucometers use an 'electric signal'.  Thus the glucometer will alert you if too little or too much blood is applied.  These glucometers as are accurate as if the blood was drawn from a vein for a glucose reading.  The only realistic explanation for wide variations in glucose readings would be that the diabetes is not properly controlled.  If we are talking about a 6 year old then insulin would be used.  This would require both a basal and a rapid acting insulin - the latter taken before each meal.  If this approach is not successful the child should be referred to determine whether or not they would benefit from an insulin pump.  Insulin pumps have come a long way and they are typically the norm rather than the exception in young type 1 diabetics.  I wish you the very best of health.

First check w/ your DR. for your ideal weight range because you don't want to go too low for your height - whatever that is. Next, and most importantly, join Weight Watchers'. I say this because when you work that program it really works. It did for me! I lost 70 lbs in 11 months.You can lose 30 in 4.5 months at ~ 2lbs/wk. That's very reasonable and safe. If you do it that way it'll be easier to keep it off. If you try crash diets you're likely to gain it ALL back & then some more! I've kept my weight off for over 5 yrs now.  Foods best for wt loss: lean protein, whole grains, high fiber (fruit & veg), water (or other healthy low cal/low sugar drinks - NOT diet soda). WW's provided me w/ the structure, a great support system, great recipe ideas - cause you need variety so you don't feel deprived. Have fun - you can do it!  Don't forget the exercise - dancing is one of my favs too.|`|gjMJzfoeaa	The question really becomes how much are you eating and what. While Oatmeal is good start for the day, I'm leery to provide an answer since "Lunch" could be anything from McDonald's to Sandwichs. <br>  <br>  First thing to realize is your height. If you're 5'11 and 120, you will just look like your sick. However if you're 5'5 and 120, you'll look fine. Weight doesn't necessarily matter. <br>  <br>  To slim down eat low-fat, low carbs. Check your daily nutrition rate. It's not 2000 cal diet for everyone. I'm a 1700 calorie a day person based on my height and body type. <br>  <br>  Secondly, incorporate more snacks in the day to cut back on the amount you eat at meals. You eat more often, yes, but you still eat less through out the day (i.e. a handful of pototo chips rather than the bag). <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|RpxKmUBUaa	I've been having the same problem too, but I've got some pointers to maybe help you lose weight as well, so far I've lost 17 lbs.<br>  <br>  1. Before sitting down to dinner, enjoy some fruit or applesauce so you can help yourself get full on fewer calories, and healthier snacks.<br>  2. Try eliminating pop from your diet, all the sugar really builds up in your body.<br>  3. Eat slowly. This will allow you enjoy your meal, and have less food intake.<br>  4. Try creating a small regimen, even if its just a few push-ups a day, or walking a little further than usual.<br>  5. Try eating every four hours. I do this, and I do not starve, nor do I gorge myself on garbage and other snacks.<br>  <br>  HOPE THESE HELP!!!!

Say if you know you are going to take a nap after a meal then don’t eat so many carbs because you will not be burning them off.

XkuR8ZJPaa	I was born with a disorder called Ventricular Septal Defect which means I have a hole inbetween the ventricals in my heart.  Fortunatly I did not need surgrey to fix it and it got smaller as I got older but never closed.  So I still have it today im 27.  Because of this I have always had a little fasination with the heart.  I have seen specials on TV where they send this device up a vein/artery into the heart and when they get to the hole it opens up and it blocks the hole on both sides.  Sorry I know that is far from technical but I cannot find what it is called online.  I also just read an article that says sometimes if the hole is small they can just sew it shut or patch it.  Hopefully your problem wont be hard to fix and you have a speedy recovery and return to normal soon!  Good Luck.|`|0aBlpLvsaa	A "hole in the heart" is a very unusual condition.<br>  As someone else wrote it can  be Ventricular Septal Defect or more probably an Atrial Septum Defect.<br>  Both of them are usually diagnosed in newborns.

Buj7DUq9aa	all i can say is squats and lunges the best for that.|`|WyiOhCsjaa	Genetic therapy in the womb, but then it also has to be about 100 years into the future. You can also eat a lot and don't do any workouts or anything, that will get you a bigger ***, but the side effects are that the rest of you gets huge.<br>  <br>  Now, realistically, there is only so much you can do to your butt because it all depends on genetics. You can tone and build the muscles in that area, but even that only has limited effects. If you try lunges or squats, it will help tone and build the muscles in your butt, thighs and lower back.|`|jD5uoBpMaa	same as what they say

vjrWSrdcaa	I went through this for several years, up until the point I was willingly losing friends and family.<br>  <br>  On the advice of a friend I stopped eating wheat and gluton, ie bread pasta cakes biscuits etc, as my belly used to bloat ( I mean I looked 6 months preggers) at the same time my mood worsened.<br>  <br>  Within 3 weeks I had lost some weight, my skin cleared right up and I started having plenty of energy again. I soon realised I was being nicer to people and had more patience, simply as I must have been feeling rotten without really knowing why.<br>  <br>  This is just one suggestion of many things that could help you sweetie, keep trying!|`|70sjdbzyaa	something is just bothering you inside don't know what it is you just need to let it out.|`|0aBlpLvsaa	First thing to point out is the stress you have ( you say you have tough units). If your studies are out of your control that may be enough to make you angry inside. It may be some love or family matters.<br>  <br>  Maybe you can talk to person you trust to get some advice.<br>  It seems to me you have to do this quickly : if this has been bothering you a couple of months it won't get better in a couple of weeks.
XO79EtDbaa	Caloriecount.about.com will give you a calorie intake depending on your bmr and your activity level.  Maybe you should check it out.  It has a great weight loss community, and so far, I've lost 10 pounds in 6 weeks using their site!|`|TODzjTczaa	The calories-make-you-fat myth is one of the most pervasive in American culture.  It's worthy of note that the World Health Organization and the United Nations both agree that a 2100-calorie diet is "starvation level".  Only Americans consider a 2000-calorie diet capable of sustaining life in any meaningful fashion.<br>  <br>  If you want to lose weight, don't count calories -- count where they come from.  The optimal caloric balance for weight loss in a moderately active adult is 40% calories from meat (doesn't matter whether they're from the fat or the protein!), 30% from vegetables, 20% from fruit, and 10% from dairy.<br>  <br>  Notice that there are no flour- or sugar-based products in that setup at all.  That's a critical part of weight loss.  Flour and sugar tell your body to store fat while they burn the carbs that those "foods" produce.  By not eating them, you keep your body in fat-burning mode rather than carb-burning mode, which has the dual effects of keeping your body from storing fat, and burning the fat you already have.<br>  <br>  From that point on, it's all just a matter of exercise.|`|H9fYGosUaa	about 1200 calories a day toooo much will make u fat

Ear infection that spread into face and mastoid bone.    Asprin cream kapsasin (topical skin "relief") that I was allergic to.  It got all hot and  it felt like burning flesh all over my body.  It was so intense I ran outside and was rolling in snow in my underwear trying to get it to stop. Which made it burn more.

onKfEYL0aa	I had the same problem this winter with the skin under my beard. I was reading on beards.org that guys should wash their beards with shampoo and conditioner like they do their heads.   I gave it a try and it worked. I use American Crew Citrus Mint shampoo and conditioner. I got it at the barber shop.   I hope this will help you. I know it's annoying to have flaky skin under the beard. Good Luck!|`|Ld0ZgPmjaa	Loose the beard Matty!|`|zFsTSrOcaa	If it looks like dandruff, it might be dandruff.  Your beard collects the dead skin flakes that form normally, just like scalp dandruff.  Try a dandruff shampoo on your beard for a couple of weeks and see if it helps.    UPDATE:  Some dandruff shampoos can cause dry skin.  A moisturizing cream might help.  If nothing works, it's time to decide whether the beard is worth it.
IyOVYQ0paa	you loose weight by excersicing and eating right. OF COURSE YOU CAN. But it's also about building some muscle.|`|5nfqY9T7aa	Omg absolutely.<br>  Jumping rope, running, and even dancing is cardio.<br>  Once you start trimming down, your face and neck will look thinner also.  There's not really a work out for them, but your body loses weight pretty proportionally.|`|EzEUdI1caa	Your face and your neck will loose as the rest of your body does...cardio WILL ALWAYS burn fat...and all the other things you mentioned are great!!!!!!!!  Boxing, dance, SPINNING,,,all are great cardio|`|hecLfcedaa	Yes you can burn fat doing cardiovascular exercises. About three weeks ago I started this training program. It's interval training and that is cardiovascular exercises and one of the best ways to burn fat. It's also a very effective way to improve your fitness. The first week I was running for 1min then walking for 2min 6x. I am at the end of the second week and I can do 1min running 1min walking 10x with ease. If you want muscle tone try circuit training with that. What your doing now would be perfect for it.|`|BcxdFV0maa	if you jump around ; do jumping jacks ; spin in circles ; &squat over &over in that same cycle ; it will count as cardio ; because you're doinq repeated exercises. you WILL burn fat. diet overall will get rid of a fat face. also there are facial exercises you can do like opening &closinq your mouth really wide repeatedly ormoving your mouth side to side. goodluck!|`|Rsr8nngWaa	Fat in your face or neck will only go slowly over time with all other fat on your body, so just keep with general cardio and basic strength exercises like you mentioned.<br>  <br>  For cardio, elliptical machines are low-impact, but running is always the best full-body workout.|`|T8IFOfHCaa	running will burn fat everywhere|`|DM2M5LK4aa	Yes, cardio exercise is mainly what you do for burning fat.  I'll explain a little about those different exercises you mentioned.  Cardio exercises usually consist of running, swimming, and any other endurance exercises.  <br>  <br>  By definition, a "cardio" exercise, cardio meaning "heart",  will elevate a person's heart rate.  This causes your muscles to collectively work harder than normal which will burn fat.  Fat is basically unused energy in the body.  Weight lifting exercises focus more on building muscle than burning fat.<br>  <br>  Anyways, a few great cardio exercises that you can do are running and swimming.  Surgery aside, there is no real way to actually target fat loss on the neck and face.  The fat in these places and in your body in general will go away as you do more cardio exercises and lose more overall body fat.  Get that heart racing and good luck.|`|xvpqOgIfaa	Sit ups, push ups, etc are strength training exercises, not cardio. Cardio is running, walking fast, jogging etc. <br>  if you want to lose fat from your face and neck, you have to do cardio and reduce the fat over all of your body. You can't just pick a spot on your body and say you will only lose fat from that spot. If you could do that, my butt would be small and my boobs would be bigger, lol.|`|F3KkB4GWaa	Yea cardio will use up all your calories you've gotten through food so your body will burn the fat you've accumulated to make up for the differences. Also building muscle (muscle burns fat). But running is good cardio. Nothing does it like step aerobics though (a little dorky i know) Oh or dancing is great too|`|klOP21xTaa	running is best in steady state conditions i.e. run at a pace you can manage for a reasonably long period of time say start out at 20 mins and work up to 60 mins, circuit raining is also good i.e. setting up stations running in between them and doing the exercises you mentioned, if you want to get fit military fitness is the best in my opinion.|`|LXMbUx2Jaa	yes you can. try using the elyptical at the gym! that thing is amazzzzzing!|`|mcETHtjfaa	as you lose weight on your body, it comes off ur face too|`|HsiDiRB5aa	idk

The smell is always stronger to the woman herself. The brown is just spotting which happens before and after your period. A STD is a sexually transmitted disease. Which is a disease that you can get when you have sex. A few examples; HIV, Herpes, ect.You will learn about them in SEX ED during school.|`|1keH3R6paa	Get that checked out doctor, pronto. It could mean that you have a vaginal infection, and it may be serious. Don't worry, you'll be fine though. Hope I helped. And a STD is a sexually transmitted disease.|`|2YHpV9koaa	If ur 13, you probably aren't sexually active, but a STD is when you have sex with someone with that disease, like HIV AIDS.

bYh5PgTQaa	For a yeast infection: <br>  <br>  Take acidophilus (you can find it over the counter at any pharmacy; and make sure you keep it refrigerated) or yogurt (which contains acidophilus and other good bacteria), douche with a solution of 1 to 3 tbsp. vinegar in a quart of water (repeat once a day while having symptoms, but no longer than a week), decrease sugar intake, and if you're sexually active, use a condom until clear and have your partner treated (because he may carry the bacteria and give the infection back).  In addition to this, use any OTC yeast infection remedy at your pharmacy.<br>  <br>  For a bacterial Infection:<br>  <br>  You can try the above, but chances are you'll end-up needing antibiotics to clear up the infection.|`|e5VUwaRsaa	I know it sounds nice to be able to treat it with home remedies, but my experience is that they don't work very well, or if they do it takes a long time to work. Best to go to the pharmacy and get the recommended treatment.|`|AA10988719	well of course take preventive measures not to get a  yeast infection: i.e. cotton underwear, loose fitting clothes, a daily serving of yogurt and a proper diet, and try putting some cornstarch in your panties.  Already having it .. well, drink plenty of water and cranberry juice.  I tried something I found on the internet once which was putting plain white yogurt in the vagina, didn't have much luck with the whole thing.  <br>  <br>  I included 2 articles for you to check out.  Otherwise do a random google search thousands of sources out there.  good luck|`|UqfVsYWRaa	They do sell at the drug store, but DO NOT GET the one's that promise that you will be cured with one treatment!!!!   Trust me, it will be back again as bad in days (Monistat).<br>  <br>  You have to get the one for at least the three day treatment, you'll just be buying again, also look for the product that has the topical treament for the itching included with the internal product for your comfort.  <br>  <br>  If you take antibotics or birth control, this is usually what causes these yeast infections.
Jswomud7aa	I grind a lot too. So much that I get headaches after a full night of grinding. My husband wakes me up in the middle of the night because he says it sounds like i'm pulverizing my teeth into dust!! haha<br>  <br>  Anyways, they don't know why some people grind while other don't. But it's important that you protect your teeth. Your dentist can take an impression and fit you for a night-guard.

Toqu9lTqaa	an infection usually caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). EBV is very common, and many people have been exposed to the virus at some time in childhood.<br>  <br>  Not everyone who is exposed to EBV develops the symptoms of mono, though. As with many viruses, it is possible to be exposed to and infected with EBV without becoming sick.<br>  <br>  People who have been infected with EBV will carry the virus for the rest of their lives — even if they never have any signs or symptoms of mono. People who do show symptoms of having mono probably will not get sick or have symptoms again.<br>  <br>  One common way to "catch" mono is by kissing someone who has been infected, which is how the illness got its "kissing disease" nickname. If you have never been infected with EBV, kissing someone who is infected can put you at risk for getting the disease.<br>  <br>  Symptoms:<br>  <br>  constant fatigue <br>  fever <br>  sore throat <br>  loss of appetite <br>  swollen lymph nodes (commonly called glands, located in your neck, underarms, and groin) <br>  headaches <br>  sore muscles <br>  larger-than-normal liver or spleen <br>  skin rash <br>  abdominal pain<br>  <br>  Basically- you have to have a cut in your mouth while kissing someone with the disease.|`|264cbcb58c2a9871fb67a37251391020aa	Mono is the shortened name for Mononucleosis.<br>  <br>  Mono isn't actually classed as an STD, but is caused by the Epstein-Barr virus which is a herpes virus.  This virus is spread by person-to-person contact via saliva.  Activities such as kissing, sneezing and sharing food or drink can transmit the virus.<br>  <br>  Many people think that Mononucleosis is just a teenage disease, but it isn't.  But some say that the symptoms are more noticeable in younger people.  Incubation period is short for younger people (about a week) but can be a lot longer for adults.<br>  <br>  The symptoms are fatigue, fever, sore throat, nausea, jaundice, headache, stiffness, muscle weakness, loss of appetite, sore muscles, chest pain, difficulty breathing.  In fact many people just think they have the flu when they actually have mono instead.<br>  <br>  Mono is usually diagnosed after a blood test.<br>  <br>  There body can fight Mono by itself, and you'll make a recovery eventually but it may take anything from a week to a couple of months to make a full recovery.  Plenty of rest, water and sleep is the best way to recover.  After recovery, you should take it easy for a while afterwards.|`|HHbyE1dkaa	with mono you get a sore throat and can see white blisters in the back of your mouth/throat, like on your tonsils.  yes, supposedly, like chicken pox, once you've had it, you keep the dormant virus in your system so supposedly you can't get it again.  but no, you're not contagious afterwards.|`|RaNgnteAaa	it can be caused from being overly tired or from sharing things (food, drink ect.)|`|pYpXj7gOaa	its from sharing drinks with sick people, or being uncleanly|`|quSZLSn1aa	With any medical question, you should ask your doctor.<br>  <br>  In the meantime, check the link below, it's pretty reliable.<br>  <br>  Mono is short for mononucleosis. The symptoms are "...a high fever, a severe sore throat, swollen glands and tonsils, and weakness and fatigue. Symptoms usually start 4 to 6 weeks after you are exposed to the virus."<br>  <br>  To answer your last two questions, yes and yes. You'll get better, but you'll always be a carrier for mono, though never a danger to yourself.|`|LXMbUx2Jaa	Mononucleosis, also called "mono," is a common viral illness that can leave you feeling tired and weak for weeks or months. Mono goes away on its own, but lots of rest and good self-care can help you feel better.<br>  <br>  As soon as you get over mono, your symptoms will go away for good, but you will always carry the virus that caused it. The virus may become active from time to time without causing any symptoms. When the virus is active, it can be spread to others.|`|918295a4b1b66e21f58dd5fa478603dbaa	Please click this link... it will tell you everything you want to know about this disease otherwise known as "The Kissing Disease".<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_mononucleosis" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_...</a>|`|1cec78892e2912eecfe0874cf01092afaa	I agree with the second answerer.

mMLci6LSaa	Depending on how old you are, the weight might go away on its own as you age.  It's called "baby fat".  If you look at timeline photos of actresses, you will notice that as they get into their mid twenties and early thirties, their faces get thinner.|`|J7ZZL1bCaa	The word is 'lose'....'loose' is the opposite of 'tight'.|`|1f93fa3c5a4f157aadd42c2fd3953d4caa	Check with a doctor, for a healthy eating plan.<br>  <br>  But drinking more water, getting more sleep, eating fewer starchy foods--like breads, cakes, and potatoes (fewer, do not go carb free),<br>  will take it off in a few weeks. Celery, and cucumbers eaten 4 times a week, with reduced starch diets, are natural de-puffers.|`|sy5CgfjDaa	I completely understand =[ but sadly I don't think there is, fat just gathers in different places on different people, it's impossible to pinpoint a place to lose weight but exercising regularly and eating healthily should help eventually|`|5X6NpEHTaa	just do cardio exercise like running, swimming, jump rope, etc. to lose overall body fat.|`|y9N3DsKBaa	There is no such thing as spot reducing. You have to lose weight all over; or not at all

Mush a strawberry and brush your teeth (after brushing with toothpaste) for a week, you'll see a big difference.<br>  Or you can use Crest White Strips or Arm and Hammer Whitening Booster.|`|jewgQZGUaa	Add drops water to a table spoon of bicarbonate of soda to make a thick paste. Use this to brush your teeth. However, only do this at most twice a week as it can make your gum sensitive. I think it's a great way to brighten up your smile instantly!!!|`|GLeRaf1eaa	my mom used to use baking soda but, I don't know if that so healthy anymore.|`|wb8WwWMNaa	Whitening tooth paste every time you brush and/or Crest Whitestrips work too.  :D|`|uAzToWC7aa	yeah its called...

ArFFUPTBaa	nope, your fine :)|`|0eEVGUT8aa	It is possible. I once felt light headed and dizzy after masturbating six times in one day. Needless to say, I didn't have any sperm to shoot out  by the fifth time.<br>  Be careful - you could go blind.|`|Y1lHRaVaaa	No, only if you feel like it is taking to much of your time or your penis is starting to hurt. If you masturbate a lot in a short time period you can temporarily run out of semen, but this will fix itself quickly.|`|5yBAMbIZaa	anything you do under 5 times per day is ok, exceptions are breathing, having sex, and other necessary things you have to do. yes having sex is necessary for the survival of some people like sexaholics|`|Eo9ZdKqvaa	no but still, if you've got a bf/gf it would be best to not masturbate, unless they want you to, and there watching/ helping.|`|IzwoSZGYaa	Once per life cycle is the limit.|`|X61wWZAsaa	u can if you do it too many times a day cause u cant produce sperm fast enought.|`|deebXXoHaa	not enough, i punch the clown at least eight times a day.|`|4cVU7CoZaa	nope it all good. <br>  <br>  my guy  friend says he does it 3-4 times a day. just sometimes he says it starts to hurt|`|PXRu3Ovmaa	2 or 3 times is fine maybe 5 would be ok but those guys who masturbate like 7 - 10 times a day need a frickin job|`|i9421OOYaa	only if you want a huge penis|`|irIk1saFaa	Once or twice a day isn't too much, but you can do it too much.|`|AA10475412	Once or twice a day is a perfect masturbation schedule.|`|CC6dSdJmaa	No, you can never masturbate too much, if you do try to do it too much your body won't let you!<br>  Twice a day is not exceptional, I am a mature guy and still masturbate twice a day normally. I also always eat my own cu*m.<br>  It is the best possible activity for your health, relaxes you and keeps you reasonably sexually fit!|`|q0ce9dEnaa	You cannot masturbate too much in the sense that you would run out of sperm; however, masturbating too much could lead to irritations of the skin on your penis, and therefore discomfort that would last for days, meaning you could not masturbate for days.

g2kP1aOaaa	Yes it's very possible but being less than 100 pounds is unhealthy for a 14 year old to be.<br>  Aim for toning your body rather than worrying about exact weight.<br>  Do a cardio workout for about 30 minutes atleast 5 times a week and lift weights, stay hydrated, and eat healthy.<br>  Good luck girl.|`|fBFNCS1Naa	That is very possible. The formula is simple:<br>  <br>  Diet + Exercise (Lift weights).<br>  <br>  And being less than 100lbs at only 5' tall is not unhealthy.|`|XtnF5PJkaa	Hey i was like you except im a boy and now im 14.

I lost 3 stone ( not sure how many pounds it is, check on weight converter on google to give you a target and to see how much you could loose in a short amount of time ) gained muscle and now have a 4 / six pack and arm muscle. I did 2 hours of HARD exercise everyday. ( i used gym at school, so i could go at lunch times ) and i cut down what i ate, ALOT.<br>  <br>  I was eating breakfast:<br>  bowl of cereal or porridge<br>  <br>  lunch: a protein shake<br>  <br>  dinner: anything that was cooked. preferably fish / tuna or pasta. thats good food.

Although i reccommend not to do it as hard as i did, start slow, but you have to be COMMITED. Good luck :D hope this helps|`|gjMJzfoeaa	avoid fast foods...including their "healthy" options.

fWP8aBpsaa	Under the NHS the most you will have to pay is ￡7.10 per item in England (around ￡5 in Scotland).  <br>  <br>  However prescriptions are free if:<br>  1. You live in Wales.<br>  3. You are in full time education from 16 to 18.<br>  4. You are in receipt of certain state benefits such as Income Support or JSA.<br>  5. None of the above points apply but you have a limited amount of money.  (If I understand correctly, less than ￡16,000 when all your personal earnings and savings are combined).  You will need a HC2 certificate for this which you get by filling in form HC1 (see below ref).|`|8AA2fTDcaa	If you are still at school they should be free but if you pay for your prescriptions then yes you have to pay for them. I was on them for about a year and had to pay.

ai33g11Maa	I tried my first cigarette when I was 13, am now 25 and have never really stopped smoking since.  <br>  <br>  Don't try it - you'll never stop.<br>  <br>  Yuck :-(|`|xLj4nilXaa	I think it's disgusting and pretty sad|`|dItZAwI2aa	i'm 47, and have been to many funerals for family members who smoked and developed lung cancer and died. in the way earlier days of American history it was "normal" to have a cigarette. many actors, politicians, etc all were paid advertisements for smoking. watch ANY old black and white movie, and there were millions and millions of them made with the best of the best actors we had then; all were smoking cigarettes throughout the show. james dean was the epitomy of cool in every picture as he stood there with a cigarette in his hand. so was rock hudson, barbara stanwick, cary grant, humphry bogart...u name them and they all had a cigarette.<br>  <br>  almost every tv program was sponsored by a cigarette company, commercials played them up...anyone remember the cowboy on the horse, and the announcer said "come to where the flavor is, come to Marlboro country"...or the ones for benson and hedges with the guy or gal with a black eye and the announcer said "i'd rather fight than switch"...there were hundreds of them for Kool, lucky strike, pal mal, camel; etc...the sponsorships were abundant. even the NASCAR cup and NHRA drag racing were called what.... the winston cup and the winston drag racing series at one time...and for a long time. you see, sports were no exception to the cigarette advertising and tobacco companies placed tens of millions of dollars in sponsorship money to them to rake in billions and billions in repeat sales from the fans who supported the sports and bought the products they advertised.<br>  <br>  i can remember as a youngster going to centennial lanes in east detroit with my dad on friday nights when he team bowled and the cigarette machine was selling cigarettes at 35 cents a pack. now its what, the price of a gallon of gas? or more?<br>  no one knew then what all that tar and nicotine would cause in the human body. i've gotta say, a 21yr old with yellow teeth and health problems is just absolutely what every model/actress, etc wants to strive to be...not.<br>  <br>  as a young teen, do u know some of the ingrediants in crystal meth, the most addictive drug on the planet? tar. nicotine. whats in cigarettes besides tobacco? tar. nicotine.<br>  smoking is an addiction just as drugs including prescription drugs, gambling and drinking.<br>  <br>  have i ever smoked...sure, small flavored cigars...maybe 1 a year. my parents both smoked. my dad developed throat cancer from both cigarettes and smoking a pipe. after nasty treatments in the early 70's he went to cigars because its said one doesn't inhale the smoke. in his later years many of his health problems were researched back to his smoking.<br>  <br>  if you're still smoking, i'd suggest stopping for your own health and wellbeing. <br>  <br>  i expect to get many thumbs downs and i don't care. the research is in and the number of deaths from cigarette smoking is dramatic. just a few years ago almost all cigarette manufacturers stated that they indeed did put products in their cigarettes to keep people addicted. we place drug dealers in prison for selling products on the street that can harm and even kill us, products that are so addictive that just trying crystal meth once makes one hooked, but big tobacco still sells...legally. think about it.<br>  <br>  good luck and GOD bless.|`|M1PYqC3qaa	Well, I'm against anyone smoking! Even more so when its kids - its not even legal in the UK for them to smoke!

At the end of the day, its that person's decision and I would never go up and say something to them about it - its their lives they're ruining. When its a mum with kids and she's smoking around the house - that's what really makes me angry!<br>  No-one I know smokes. And I'm glad - I would hate to be around people smoking, them getting the smell on your clothes and hair.

qnD5RfbPaa	This might be as a result of gas accumulated and trapped in your system.  If you are not eating balanced (ie. a diet that would maintain a pH balance of 7.63 to 7.45) then you will produce excess gas that tend to cause pain at different parts of the body including your back. A balanced diet would involved you consuming 60% vegetables of which at least 50% is eaten raw, 20% fruits, 10% complex starchy carbohydrate, and 10% protein (this would include fats). To resolve pain as a result of gas, you'd need to adjust your diet.<br>  <br>  However it might be a good idea to see your medical doctor about it. In any case you may want to try, for some relief of your back pain, rubbing the area with Voltaren Emulgel Geigy.|`|O3t4Rccsaa	Here is a link that will help you.

qnD5RfbPaa	I've been on it twice.  I'm also afraid of needles and had no problem with it.  Probably sting a little when inserting, but that's it. What you need to do is to ensure that you do not use the arm more than it's absolutely necessary or there is where you will develop a hard achy muscle.  (During my second time, I could not wait to be discharged so I started working in the hospital while mine was in.  I paid the painful price then.) Other than that it is not painful.  If you're hairy then the drag on the hair when removing the tape will cause another sting.  I'm not.

Honey...labor is going to be a trip to the zoo and back for you if needles bug you. Toughen up young Mom, you are going to have to put up with some pain, but it's temporary, it's vital that you have an IV in place in case anything goes wrong, and to replenish any fluids or blood you may lose in childbirth if necessary.

IMPvzBk1aa	Chemicals are released by the damaged tissue which bring platelets to the area to become sticky and plug the leaky vessels.  An inflammatory response occurs which brings immune cells to fight infection, and other clotting factors come to begin forming a foundation for collagen and other healing cells to form new tissue. a scab usually is formed to close over the wound as the new tissue develops beneath the scab (barring infection, which inhibits healing).|`|KOYC3XkJaa	Part of your blood is made up of platelets, which are what cause clots. As your blood circulates, the platelets build up where the cut is and clot to stop the bleeding. White blood cells are rushed to the area to fight off any bacteria and potential infections. General circulation is increased to the wounded area as well. As time passes, new skin cells are formed through mitosis (the process by which cells multiply) and the cut heals over. <br>  Obviously this is a bit simplified, but that's the general idea. Platelets clot and stop the bleeding; white blood cells protect the body; skin cells regenerate through mitosis.|`|q0ce9dEnaa	Platelets in your bloodstream rush to the cut site. Being sticky, they clump together in the place of the wound which stops the blood from leaving the bosy, and eventually forms a scab. The skin heals over the scab, and the scab either falls off or is digested back into teh body by the blood.|`|bNllesmMaa	Your blood clots together, to cause a scab.  Then it heels eventually.

4b63df522adcbbe3effabc36048eabe4aa	The dude above me is wrong. As many people usually are. THC does in fact store in your fatty-glands, which surprisingly he got right. Although it does not stay in your system for 2-4 months, that is way off! It stays int he system for 1-month and no longer than that. Many people thinks it's up to 3 or 6 months, but that is incorrect. If you are being tested by hair follicle then you can be flagged anywhere up to 9 months. This is not because the THC is still within your blood-stream, this is because the THC attracts itself to your outter-limits and this is the test only used by major corporations to see if you have touched Marijuana within the past 9-months.<br>  <br>  Don't try to detox yourself, by drinking gallons of water or vinegar, or 420 drinks from the smoke-shop. This may clean you up for the piss-test, although you will also be flagged for being to clean. Which has happened int he past to a cousin of mine. Your only chance is to go to the smoke-shop and buy the box-kit which includes the leg-strap, pee, heating pad, and tube. You place the heating pad on the baggy of piss they provide which is clean an can be used for males and females before entering the test room, this is to get it to piss temp. then you drain it into the cup. That is the safest solution, but also costs $40.00. If your taking the test for a job, I recommend you cough up it he money, you'll make it back on your first paycheck, whether your full or part-time.<br>  <br>  Nobody in the history of pot-use has failed a piss-test after being smoke-free 30-days. Do the research.|`|W2z5dCrmaa	THC shows up in testing from 2 to 4 months after smoking weed, depending if you use it once in a while,or if you use it semi regularly.<br>  <br>  It stores in the body fatty tissues and gradually gets released as the body is renewing body cells.<br>  <br>  If you are heavy, and a regular user, you can get a high by skipping eating for a day or two as the body fat being consumed back into the body can carry enough THC to give you a high.<br>  <br>  It would take you a couple weeks at least to show THC free.<br>  <br>  Not the best news, but I hope it helps<br>  <br>  Me! :- )|`|GiYVrmI3aa	You are screwed. It takes about a month for weed to totally be gone from you system. If it is a home test you might be able to get by if you drink lots of water and some vinger.|`|atTJPGfwaa	My brother drinks pickle juice haha , i know its weird but he says it works.

afJz77pjaa	Itchiness is related to HODGKIN'S lymphoma. Generally, the other non-Hodgkin's lymphomas don't get the itchiness.No one really knows why it happens. But when the itching and the night sweats occur, these are called "B" symptoms.<br>  <br>  When I was sick, it was an all over itchiness. It started in my legs and feet and worked it way up all the way to my scalp. But usually at night, it would get worse on my legs, feet and arms. It feels like little bugs crawling all over.<br>  <br>  It was the kind of itching that wasn't cured with any kind of lotion or allergy medicine. And I wasn't even satisfied after I'd scratched the skin off.|`|pjYn6PbCaa	Lymphoma occurs inoccuously, often so harmlessly that it takes some time before you may realize that there is anything seriously wrong. Here is a list of the common symptoms of lymphoma. But you must remember that most of these symptoms are common with many harmless conditions. You should not panic if you have any of these symptoms. Consult your doctor, and he will be able to address most of your fears and doubts. <br>  <br>  1. Painless lumps in your neck, armpits or groin<br>  This is the most common symptom and often the only one. These are enlarged lymph nodes. Most people first notice these lumps while bathing or changing, or they may be first felt by your partner. All of the other symptoms that are given below should be present along with these enlarged nodes to be specific as a warning for lymphoma. Only an enlargement of nodes may not be specific for lymphoma. See the article Are enlarged nodes always a sign of lymphoma? <br>  2. Weight loss <br>  Weight loss usually occurs rapidly over a period of a few months for no known reason. Often an individual can lose ten to fifteen pounds over a couple of months. <br>  3. Fever<br>  Fever that is continuous or occurs intermittently over a period of time and doesn't seem related to a chest or urinary infection should be a cause for you to consult a doctor. Fever that is related to node swellings occurs commonly with infections and many lymphomas are often mistaken as infections at the early stage. Occasionally, in those affected by Hodgkin lymphoma, a characteristic fever called Pel-Ebstein fever occurs. <br>  4. Excessive sweating at night <br>  This unique situation may be quite bothersome. You may wake up at night drenched in sweat without any apparent reason. <br>  5. Itchiness all over your body<br>  Another unique situation that is related to the secretion of some special chemicals from the lymphoma cells. <br>  6. Loss of appetite<br>  As lymphomas spread within your body and grow in size, many individuals feel a considerable loss in their appetite. Weight loss of more than 10% can be a matter of concern as it is a poor prognostic factor for lymphomas. See the article on B-symptoms of lymphoma. <br>  7. A feeling of weakness<br>  As cancer cells are always growing, they use up more of the body's nutrients, leaving the body with less. This makes you feel weaker. <br>  8. Breathlessness along with swelling of the face and neck<br>  Rarely, when a lymphoma in the neck or chest grows very large, it may block the flow of some vessels and lead to a swelling of the face and neck along with a feeling of breathlessness. <br>  <br>  As lymphomas can occur in any organ, may give rise to some unusual symptoms as well. A lymphoma in the stomach can cause pain in the abdomen, and a lymphoma in the brain can cause a headache or leg weakness.|`|4B1zfJqdaa	My son was diagnosed with Hodgkin's Lymphoma in '96 when he was 12.  At first there was no symptoms. Then he had a large marshmallow size soft lump in the front of his neck. Took him to the doctor and he found another lump in his armpit. The doc. thought it was Cat Scratch Fever, put him on antibiotic for four months. Lump did not go down and then he discovered multiple pea size lumps at his collar bone. A biopsy was performed and found out it was cancer. He went through chemo and radiation and I'm happy to say he has been cancer free 13 years. No itchiness. Be safe. Go to your doctor. That will relieve the stress of not knowing.<br>  Good Luck.

2sycPf8Daa	Congestive heart failure (CHF) is a serious condition in which the heart is not pumping well enough to meet the body's demand for oxygen. This condition has its name due to the heart failing to pump efficiently, which often results in congestion of the lungs. As a result, the heart tries to overcompensate for the problem, which only makes the problem worse causing Pneumonia.Pneumonia is infection of the lungs. The infection is in the lung tissue and the tiny air sacs in the lungs where the blood receives oxygen from air that is breathed in. It is extremely common and can range from a mild illness to a fatal one, especially if the patient is already sick or in hospital.<br>  <br>  Your brother heart was not pumping well enough to meet his body's demand for oxygen due to Congestive heart failure (CHF), which resulted in congestion of his lungs. His heart tried to overcompensate for the problem, which only made the problem worse, causing an infection of his lungs and to fill up with fluid, so all his body became "congested" with fluid, the kidneys also couldn't work properly in removing the excess fluid from his body and the fluid accumulated in all parts of his body, particularly the lungs, heart, feet and lower legs. All this could have  happened in a matter of hours,it was  progressive and eventually fatal. Sorry for the loss of your brother.<br>  <br>  Take care as always!|`|M5GOuWXOaa	It is possible for his lungs to fill up. Especially if his heart wasnt pumping correctly. When the heart fails to pump adequately blood backs up into the lungs. This could occur in as little as a few hours. If it was pneumonia I wouldnt think they would fill as quickly. Sorry for your loss.
4b63df522adcbbe3effabc36048eabe4aa	[1] This is the reason my gf quit smoking. She started to get anxiety attacks, although she also has a background getting them without smoking. But her scenarios were much like yours, it may be time for you to hang the old Ganja Gloves up. Even if your young, she smoked avidly for a longtime then had to stop when she was like 20ish. Some people are built to smoke a lifetime, so far I was!<br>  <br>  [2] I doubt it was laced. If it were laced you could taste it within the bud. If you didn't taste anything different, it was clean. Most people won't lace bud anyways, its a waste of time, money.<br>  <br>  [3] You took bong hits, this increases the high by a large amount of percentage.<br>  <br>  [4] It doesn't matter if you are of age to drink, smoking bud is illegal anyways, you could be 10 or 100... you did it, you did it. As for drinking alcohol to increase attacks, I do not know, I don't drink. I strictly smoke. =)|`|exMPHWKHaa	A very common reaction by people smoking is anxiety I used to have a lot but I kinda smoked through it I guess I don't have panic attacks very much anymore while smoking especially if im alone. If its anxiety I recommend maybe getting some benzos like valium, xanax, or klonopin these can help out a great deal with anxiety maybe you can ask your primary care physician for them for panic attacks. This weed was not laced what you have said clearly points to a panic attack you were simply very high and freaked out. Try to make yourself comfortable or get your hands ahold of some benzos. No alcohol does not cause anxiety attacks there is no way that could happen it actually helps relieve anxiety.|`|hmsMpECkaa	btw, weed is illegal at any age.<br>  They can grow weed now that is so potent that half a hit will give you what you need.<br>  And it is not what it is laced with, it is what food they give it.  <br>  But, you know, to get more money from the masses, they'll spray it with water to weigh it down.  I  don't know, they might have figured out some way to put chemicals in there like methamphetamines and spray it on there and let it dry and crystallize and you smoke it and get the same high. . . SMOKE UP BUDDY! You did it 3 times before you said anything.<br>  You see, you are supporting their habit by creating your own habit and giving them money so they can have more.<br>  It's a mean terrible situation.|`|Sh7r0kNuaa	it was an anxiety attack. for 1, if it was laced, then they would have both been feeling the same effects. 2. its really not cost-effective to lace something from a dealing perspective, so a dealer wouldn't do it unless they want to really f*ck with someone. <br>  <br>  i can say with 99% certainty that it was an anxiety attack. just don't smoke as much next time, or maybe marijuana just isn't for you.|`|ziRA9CIOaa	ok so its not abnormal to pass out once while smoking weed. ive passed out before after 2 hits and have felt sick a few times, but it was because i was either dehydrated or hungry. just make sure you're feeling healthy and nourished enough so that your body can withstand the thc.|`|S5ZYHiFaaa	some people just can't handle smoking weed, its part of who they are, you can't fix it.|`|mi3Udvroaa	The fact that you used a bong makes everything different.

76cAAPfBaa	Go back to the dentist right away! An abscess in your mouth can be very dangerous, especially if it's near your sinus cavities. I had an abscessed wisdom tooth once, and got pneumonia. I had to take antibiotics to knock out the infection, and then the tooth had to be removed.<br>  <br>  I don't want to scare you, but if the infection gets into your sinus cavity, it can actually kill you, so don't screw around with this one, get it checked out!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.webmd.com/oral-health/guide/abscessed-tooth" rel="nofollow">http://www.webmd.com/oral-health/guide/a...</a>|`|ueeBGJnvaa	Go to your dentist immediatly to get anibiotics then you go see the endodontist, if it is an abscess, to get a root canal. The tooth can be saved if you act fast.
zDWQy9wtaa	this is either the common cold or the flu with a bit of fever mixed into it. you should try getting some pain killers for the pain or try some benelyin 4 flu or the night/day nurse they all work great but some cause drowniess and the night nurse is the strongest and puts you to sleep. or try some pain killers. take in lots of fluids water is the best. try some strepsils or throaght lozenges for your throught and cough and then for your smoking try quitting with the help of gum and patches. hope io helped
3vZl65F8aa	Some things that you have to consider is where you live and what types of weather you are in. For example, I live in Colorado where it is super dry even when it is snowing, so when I wash my face more than once my face becomes just covered in dry skin. I wash my face once in the morning and once at night, and that does the trick.<br>  But some things you can do are:<br>  <br>  #1. Decide upon the wash you will use and keep it going. (No switching back and forth between products and/or skipping some days)<br>  <br>  #2. When you wash your face, don't scrub it off! I like to basically give my face a nice soothing massage.<br>  <br>  #3. Apply some type of toner and lotion after the wash. Occasionally (about once a week), try a mask.<br>  <br>  #4. Try not to touch your face! Make it a rule and every time you find yourself touching your face, remove your hands and eventually that will just come second nature.<br>  <br>  #5. One of the most cliche ones, but big ones, is to try to at least eliminate greasy foods and/or add good foods such as berries and fruit. This will help A LOT!<br>  <br>  #6. When it comes to make up, use the good brands that are non comedogenic and such so they do not clog your pours. <br>  <br>  #7. Last, maintain stress levels if possible. Go for that nightly walk, read a book, take a moment out for yourself. Sometimes acne can be triggered by stress.<br>  <br>  <br>  I hope I helped:D|`|AA11280073	It's time to see a dermatologist.|`|iTtMQud1aa	Hello Ariel,You are not a lone and not hopeless don't stress out my son had bad acne all over his body and my daughter had mild acne we tried every silly home remade and over the counter medicine,with no success and they felt like you.Then we were refer ed to this acne product that are friend used on their daughter for acne.

aRbhA3fyaa	Chances are, you're due for a teeth cleaning anyways. Make a dentist appointment and while you're there and s/he is already looking in your mouth with a mirror or light, ask about it. Chances are it is a wart (I've known at least two people in my life with warts on their tongues), and your dentist will tell you to make an appointment with a dermatologist. The dermatologist will then probably freeze it off with liquid nitrogen.|`|BvE0qcgmaa	It could be a wart or it could be just and irritation.

You can't go from being sedentary to active overnight and hope to succeed. Start out by exercising 1-2 times per week and eventually moving up to 3-5 times per week. Only increase the amount of exercise you do per week when you feel ready.<br>  <br>  Exercise routines also have to be well rounded to be successful. You need elements of flexibility, cardiovascular and strength training. You don't need to go to the gym to get a good workout, but having access to that type of equipment is a definite plus. Flexibility isn't very intensive and can be done on most if not all days of the week. It won't directly help you with your goals but it will lead to better performance - it will make exercising a lot easier.<br>  <br>  Cardio should be done 3-5 times per week while strength training should be done 2-3 times per week. The more weight you want to lose, the more you need to exercise. If this seems confusing, you can get a free personalized workout routine at <a href="http://shtrainer.com" rel="nofollow">http://shtrainer.com</a>|`|eFvNJOJ8aa	one thing i would definitely recommend is when you've started the Jim then the best exercise would be swimming as its very enjoyable, relaxing and looses weight quite fast as well.

ZaadvJAXaa	It sounds like symptoms of PMS.  You can take Midol or Pamprin to alleviate the symptoms.  It can also be a symptom of pregnancy though.|`|v5CxaFkyaa	Dear backache and period like symptoms? not due for a week! <br>  <br>  This is a very normal thing to get a week or so before your period... Your hormones are letting your know it is comming... Depending on your age also this can change how your cycle symptoms feel before and during your period and or if you are stressed that can change your symptoms.  However either way you have nothing to worry about!  To alleviate some of the pain you can take Ibuprofen and use a heating pad both will help with craps and backpain. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps....

muHctmaGaa	Every woman's body is different, you'll hear this over and over again in the forum. Try wearing pantyliners for now if you're worried about your discharge. As for your breasts, there are a lot of arteries and very thin skin there, a regular bruise takes longer to heal naturally. Ask your pediatrician about it next time, if it might also be general discoloration or a sign of elevated platelet count.|`|XnNT4l0Xaa	Well, it's nature's course, really. If you are almost thirteen, I wouldn't stress it, especially if you are relatively short or thin. I got my period when I was ten and I hated it, so I wouldn't be hoping for it or anything. I'm pretty sure periods are genetic, so you should get it in the next few years. <br>  <br>  As for the boob era, I can't really help you. I have C36 sized boobs, though I know nothing about them really. As long as the bruise doesn't hurt too much, I wouldn't worry about it a lot. But if it does hurt, then maybe you should talk to your mom or another female about it. <br>  <br>  Hope I helped, good luck.|`|QAN5OxWIaa	about your period..everyone is different... and dont be too worried about the discharge. if you really think something is wrong than talk to ur sister,mom or your doctor.....your ? about your boobs...they hurt because they were/are growing and when you hit ur boob and got a "bruise" then yea it will go awayy<br>  <br>  <br>  hope i helped:)|`|FGG81JMtaa	dont worry discharge is perfectly normal for you age, your body will start developing discharge to say your body could be ready for you to be coming on your period, so dont worry about it, you might find a few droplets of blood if your about to start , but your find :)!,<br>  and same with your boobs its normal they will hurt because there still growing your nippels may become hard aswell, its all part of growing up, i hope i helped.|`|1gyVBCzSaa	girls usually get their period 1-3yrs after their breast begin to grow so look out the discharge is normal for girls going through puberty it will minimize to where it just happens right before your monthly period and that is usually 14 maybe and your boobs are just growing so there a little tender it will go away when they grow out a little more|`|DozD8lTGaa	hmm, talk to your Mum about it and see what she thinks.<br>  <br>  and the bruise should go soon. it might take a while because, from what i read they are really sensitive. this is probably them growing.<br>  <br>  don't worry too much. good luck and i hope i have helped. x|`|6SN2LnmYaa	You will have that discharge forever. Every woman has normal discharge, it's what keeps our system cleaned out. So there is nothing you can do about that. Every girl is different when it comes to starting their periods. My mom started at 12 and i didnt start until i was 14.<br>  And about your boobs, i have a friend who has the same problem with just having nipples and no breasts, she went to the doctor and she told her everything was fine, she just wasnt going to have very big breasts. And usually your boobs start hurting when they are growing or if you are getting ready to start your period. Your bruise should eventually go away...if you still have it within about 6 months or so i would ask your doctor. Hope this helps and good luck!!|`|VdEru1G5aa	okay...<br>  first question.....<br>  u will know when u start if that makes sense.... u can feel it.... u just kno....if u start getting cramps down there, then where a pad and see if u start......and if the discharge dnt stop, and u havent started yet and it looks like cottage cheese,.... go to the doctor cuz that is prob yeast infection, but for he period.... wait it out.... it WILL come....<br>  second question.....<br>  when u r becoming a woman =, and while u r a woman....<br>  ur boobs always hurt.....<br>  they always do hurt and there is nothing u can do about it cuz it happenes to everybody.....<br>  and the bruise should go away soon....

fGlZkvJgaa	Toothpaste doesn't kill bacteria except for Listerine toothpaste, Colgate Total toothpaste or Crest ProHealth toothpaste. Gum may help remove some food particles and stimulate the saliva in your mouth to help clean the mouth, but that's about it. To kill bacteria, you need mouthwash. Listerine works the best followed by CrestPro Health Rinse. Hydrogen peroxide can kill too may of the "good" bacteria and let fungus etc grow freely. Warm salt water is a good rinse if you don't want to use mouthwash but its not for long term daily. use. Floss your teeth too to really get all of the food and bacteria off!|`|46eedfcc0d431f5086b7b4cfa950eb57aa	Mouth wash or hydrogen peroxide ( but don't swallow either )

4b63df522adcbbe3effabc36048eabe4aa	Don't listen to these amateurs. THC is stored in the fatty-glands and takes a minimum of 1-month to pass through the system. Most commonly made mistakes people think:<br>  <br>  "If you smoke only once a year you'll be fine!" Wrong! You can smoke once in your entire life, an it'll still be in your system within 30 days. It can clear quicker then 30 days depending on your weight and how much liquids you consume.<br>  <br>  "If you drink a lot of water or juice you can pass..." Wrong. In some cases and most cases these days, since the tests have gotten stronger, doing this will in fact cleanse you for the test but, you will come out to clean and be flagged for it. This happened to my cousin, being to dirty is one thing being to clean is another. You have to maintain a normal reading.<br>  <br>  Your best bet is to spend the $40.00 at any local smoke-shop and buy the box-kit which contains the clean piss, which males and females can use, the heating pad, instructions, and the leg-strap. It's worth the buy, it's the only guarantee pass and you may lose some money as apposed to drinking a gallon of water before the test or just praying you'll make it. But, in reality, if this is for a job, you'll make that $40.00 back on your first paycheck full or part-time.|`|ubo0HWtVaa	take niacin, you can get it a a health food store- or gnc. it will flush you out. but i would stay home- it can make you go to the bathroom a lot, make you all hot. <br>  it should clean it out.|`|LKIhUMCgaa	yes it will be there, it usually takes out a month for it to leave ur body. but drink lots of water, cranberry juice, and eat watermelon. this will flush ur kidneys out to get pot out of ur system. good luck<br>  <br>  EDIT: i meant if u drink all that it will speed up the process of cleaning ur system, it should take only bout 1-2 weeks instead of a month.|`|On9zqYl0aa	You should be fine! Don't smoke anymore and drink lots and lots of water. do cardio, hit the gym up, helps you sweat out toxins, anong with fiber pills will cleanse your body. Retest yourself before your actual test tpo be sure but I wouldn't worry! Gd. luck :)|`|y4MZs3Wyaa	Go to a GNC store ask for the full body clenser(pills) around 40$. Use it as directed but a few hours before you go test|`|d74d0d57bf80db1a3f4d675531117d21aa	The thc is stored in body fat, the more body fat the longer it takes to leave your system. Your best bet is to use the artificial urine, they even have them with an artificial penis, this way if they will watch you its OK.  The artificial urine without the penis comes with a belt that you hide around your waist, the urine is warmed with a mini heating pad that it comes with and the urine comes out of a small tube to make it look like you are peeing.

I've been trying for a very long time and i don't get anywhere following this advice because my metabolism must be OUTRAGEOUSLY high; but it could work with you :]<br>  <br>  -Work out the amount of calories you consume on a normal day<br>  -Then add 500 more to that everyday<br>  -You can do this by eating/drinking caloric dense foods such as: avocadoes, cheese, milk(full fat), nuts(particularly walnuts & salted peanuts), eggs, rice, pasta etc.<br>  -You can also drink weight gainer shakes with lots of nutritious minerals and vitamins in them such as: complan, ensure, or boost, nutrament, nurishment - depending on which country you live in.<br>  <br>  You might want to consult a doctor first and see what they have to say; they may refer you to a dietician to make sure your diet plan is safe.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AORcLwTNaa	COOKIES!

AsDMUcciaa	Eh, sort of. You won't ever get huge hands, although they can get a little bigger and start to really show the veins, because the big muscles that are mostly responsible for grip strength and such are actually in your forearm. Notice how when you grip really hard your forearm really tightens up? The tendons attached to some of those muscles run all the way up to your fingers. <br>  <br>  So, those muscles can get quite large, but your actual hand won't. You can certainly tell the difference between someone with strong or weak hands, but they just can't increase in size like the biceps.|`|yFjaNB3Jaa	yea from either steroids or just working out|`|bjcjQ4zfaa	Yes.<br>  <br>  You go look at a computer programmers hands, then go look at a craftsman, or a miner, or best a rock climbers hands...<br>  <br>  Your hands can get buff.|`|FpwRrOwxaa	Yes.

LKIhUMCgaa	yes, having a cold can make ur teeth ache a lot of times, but this pain will feel like ur roots r being pulled, when ur wisdom teeth r coming out, this usually causes ur gum to hurt, not the actual teeth bc all it does is rip the gum and makes other teeth move (wisdom teeth don't have any roots, therefore they don't hurt), so u have to figure out which kind of pain it is.
9pLdhuBnaa	This pink discharge could be another symptom that your body is getting closer to your period (an example only).<br>  <br>  It could also be an indication that something like an infection such as with the cervix (another example only) could be going on.<br>  <br>  The only way to know for sure is to see your doctor for further evaluation of the situation to see what they say.

If you're middle-older aged, then it's a sign of menopause.

9NSfJChaaa	You should always use a condom, and yes you can have sex the day your period stops.  If you and your partner both want to you can have sex during your period.  It doesn't matter to my husband and I if my aunt flo is visiting or not.  He wraps up and we just go for it.  Make sure you put a dark towel, old t-shirt or something under you, though.|`|AGlpdpAKaa	I always have sex on my period.  my fiance has no problem with it.  sometimes it's nice, because it's well lubricated because of the blood.  if you're on your period, blood will probably get on your partner's penis.  but it's not a big deal (not for us anyways!)  you should always use a condom to be safe.|`|JBcpBn5Gaa	You can have sex anytime you want to.<br>  <br>  EDIT: being on your period does not mean you wont get pregnant!
XTfr3uKQaa	okay most people who are looking for summer bodies are trying to lose weight. you should be happy that you lost alot of weight, although being bulemic is not a good way to do it...<br>  I would just start eating three healthy meals a day, lots of water, make sure to eat lots of fruit and vegetables which will not only help maintain weight but will make your skin nicer. <br>  If you want a summer body but don't care about losing weight I would just do lots of strength training! Forget about doing cardio, but do lots of free weights, the gym, mat exercises, pilates, yoga, things that will tone and strenghten muscles. <br>  Just do like a bunch of squats every night to help round up your bum. <br>  If you really wanna gain weight back just start eating more calories. It's alot easier to gain weight than to lose it so you're lucky.|`|Xl82sK4haa	This is from a guy who was really skinny but the same principle applies...<br>  <br>  -----<br>  <br>  "If there was ever one thing that I wanted to change about myself, it was my body. At a mere 125 pounds I felt insecure, weak, and would do just about anything to pack some muscle onto my skinny frame. I would look at other guys and think, “why can’t I just feel average?” <br>  Forget being strong and muscular, I just wanted to feel like I wasn’t a toothpick compared to everyone else.<br>  I probably took things too far, and maybe I wasn’t as thin as I imagined, but it didn’t matter. In my eyes I was nothing. Afraid to show my arms, or take my shirt off, my confidence was down in the dumps.<br>  <br>  …But then it happened. One day when I was looking in the mirror, I realized just how unhappy I was with the way I looked. I realized that I could never be truly happy on the inside until I was happy with myself on the outside.

AA11916244	Yes ive had one once before and OMG was it painfull. The only thing i can suggest is take it easy, hot water bottle can help, finish ALL of your antibiotics and take your pain pills before the pain gets really bad or every 4 hours. Oh and these infections both pelvic and urinary can be caused due to sex. So be sure to stay clean down there and pee immediately after you do the deed. Hope you start to feel better soon.

I am sorry I am probably not much of help but just know that you'll make it through.<br>  Only three more years and you can go on with your own life.<br>  <br>  I actually moved out (to boarding school) when I was 12 years.<br>  However, now all grown up, I have a good relationship to my parents. Still not te best with my mom but we are all better.<br>  <br>  I would like to think it was because I moved out and they realized how bad of parents they were... the guilt trip worked.<br>  <br>  <br>  Best of luck, hon.|`|EUCfasVsaa	well im sorry. :( maybe u should do more activities after school or go to a friends house?! im sorry!!|`|ZnfZiZyzaa	awh, my best friend has the same problem only when she wished she could leave then her dad died. he had a heart attack. just know that in 3 years you can leave and go away. im sorry that its like this. you probably dotn diserve it.|`|sVdCGwIUaa	You are not a terrible person and your mom is the one that should get a punishment for keeping you there!

Don't run away, your mom needs you.  But I'd get on the phone immediately to the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-SAFE (7233).  It's anonymous and they can best advise you on how to handle this.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|WHN5cuGZaa	relax you should get up get out get something|`|Knfu6AzRaa	No you should ask God for help.  Tell your mom you need to talk to her.  Show no emotion in your voice either sympathetic or mean.  Try and sound monotone and just flat out tell her if she doesn't get this problem worked out with her husband you are leaving for good.  Tell her you've made up your mind and that this constant stress is not good for you.  Then just listen to her,  don't interrupt and when she's finished regardless of what she says tell her your leaving if things don't start to change.|`|EZH9K05maa	Life really is worth it. You have every right to be mad at your mom for not wanting to leave with you. I would talk to a counselor at school or at church or where ever you can go to get someone to help you. You can't think about dying though. If you are only 15 then you still have so much life ahead of you, so don't think anything rash.|`|Vcg2QuDWaa	First of all, there are support groups for teens that are going through similiar things, so that you have an outlet.  Is there alcohol or drugs involved?  Just know that sooner or later this will pass and live will be worth it.  Hang in there until it gets better.  And it really will.  Good Luck!!|`|Plu6OVoGaa	My mom has issues too. Just stay, you only have 3 years to go. Then college will come and you'll be free. Besides, do you want to leave her all alone with your father?|`|F3KkB4GWaa	Ask a relative or friend if you can stay with them cause that really is torture to watch your mom be mistreated. Tell her YOUR leaving with or without her. Dont subject yourself to that.|`|ZkR8Qyezaa	Pray to God he help you with all your problems. He will do whats right whether your mom leaves your dad or not that is not your decision it's Gods|`|1Yo94KIuaa	My aunt had the same problem she wanted to stay, and even tho she probably hated him and hated him she still stayed because she didnt want to face the fact that this shouldnt be her life, her husband was a great person like an angel when around everyone else but when she moved with him to Florida things jusst got worse. He had became more violent and it got to the point that she got badly hurt and he is going to jail for 20 years. Everyone blames my aunt for this, but in reality, Why on EARTH would you back up such a jerk like him? <br>  <br>  He needs to leave, and be gone, not you, just think of you life ahead, would you really want to just throw that all away? Your mom probably needs you now more than ever, and she may not show it, but she may be thinking it.

UjVDUJe3aa	If I am still alive you will be fine. Be glad you will be sedated. I got 18 teeth pulled 4 days ago with only novacaine and a valium. It was so I could get dentures. 2 of my bottom teeth were sevrly infected and the novacaine had hardly any effect whatsoever. I'm still here and fine. I can't eat much but I need to lose 10 pounds anyway. I can't smoke but I needed to quit. I was really swollen for 2 days but now it is not too bad. You will be knocked out so you will be fine. Do it now. I put it off for way too long and now have to have dentures at the age of 31! So take care of it now. You will be happier when it is over and being sedated you will miss the worst part of the whole thing.

gSo4dR7oaa	Some of your symptoms may be due to the stress you are feeling at this point, which is understandable.  Try to relax.  If you do not feel better in a day or 2, see your doctor.<br>  <br>  Most people have no symptoms of HIV for several years, but some people experience flu like symptoms within a few months after getting infected. It is impossible to tell the difference between flu symptoms caused by HIV and flu symptoms caused by actual flu. The only way to find out if you have HIV is to have an HIV test.  It can not be diagnosed any other way. <br>  <br>  It can take some time for someone who is infected to test positive.  More than 98% of people would test positive within 3 months, but in rare cases, it could take up to 6 months for someone to test positive.|`|CwXYQHqmaa	There really isn't any sure fire way of knowing if you have hiv with out getting tested.

Some people have HIV for many years  and never show a symptom and some people show symptoms soon after infection. There is just no way to know without being tested, and since you did get tested, you unfortunately just have to wait and see.|`|vjrWSrdcaa	Usually one would expect these signs, or similar nearer the day of exposure, which would have been 7 weeks ago..

1f93fa3c5a4f157aadd42c2fd3953d4caa	Check with a physician for a good weight loss plan.<br>  <br>  This is what a friend of mine did, who was wayyyyyyyyy bigger than you. She was 4ft6 and weighed 300 lbs. She was bedridden and could scarcely go anywhere. She either had to lose weight, or risk not walking again because she had shattered her leg bones with the excess.<br>  This is what she did.<br>  She cut her calories down to 2,000 calories for the first month. She did not exercise (could not exercise). And in one month, she lost around 28 lbs. Then she lost another 10 lbs the month after that. <br>  Soon she started eating smaller portions, 1/3 of the plate had to be lean meats and 2/3  grilled or steamed vegetables for every meal. Her meals were like 400 calories each. <br>  6 months later, she was down another 60 lbs. No joke. <br>  She kept up her good eating habits, and once she was close to 200 lbs, she started swimming at a local pool. She did not want to wear a bathing suit at first, but she wanted to lose weight more than anything so she did it. In the next 12 months, she lost ALOT of weight, so much that she got down to a 23 inch waist, and weighs 86 lbs, standing at 4ft6. <br>  And she did her weight loss the right way, because she does not have any saggy skin or stretch marks left over.<br>  <br>  *Best of luck*|`|fBFNCS1Naa	Diet + Exercise (Weight lifting mostly)|`|4F8N9Xqyaa	Check w/ your Doc on what your healthy wt range is first. Or find a BMI (body mass index) chart on the web. Check what your BMI is by finding your height & current wt. See what it says is a healthy BMI for your height & see what the weight range is for that. There is your goal wt. Start making healthy food choices - lean proteins, whole grains, heart healthy fats, high fiber (fruit & veg) and water - at least 6 + (8 oz.) glasses daily. Get moving - dance is my fav exercise. Speed walk. When you have more stamina get involved w/ sports. I have to be honest w/ you though. You'll probable need to lose ~100lbs. That is not possible to do in a healthy way by end of May. But you'll start feeling much better if you start now anyway. Don't put this off. I did it w/ Weight Watchers  more than 5 yrs ago and have kept off almost 70 lbs. You can do it. It'll just take a bit more time than you may like. Don't give up though.|`|8fu2UYnGaa	The pattern for losing weight is simple - eat less and move more - the problems appear when we in reality try to put that into practice! There are lots of stumbling blocks in the big wide world don't you think?!

XSu3dedGaa	Certain governments in Africa, refuse to accept that there is a link between sex and HIV and consequently refuse to accept the link between HIV and AIDs even though both are scientifically proved links. Certain leaders have HIV / AIDs but are ashamed to admit it and refuse to take tests in front of their people to prove otherwise.<br>  <br>  Condoms aren't as readily available in Africa as they are in England and education isn't as high, not just sexual education but all education, you will find that the children and adults that have been to school in Africa though generally know about HIV / AIDs and know how to protect themselves better than the ones that have never been to school.<br>  <br>  Testing is also low, so many people don't know they are infected and carry on infecting others, accidentally.<br>  <br>  There are others who infect other members of the public through rape on purpose, although I see no reason for this personally, it happens.<br>  <br>  In England, we have the education, we have the condoms readily available, we have a government, who as stupid as they are, admit that HIV leads to AIDs and that HIV is a sexually transmitted disease, and we have control of it rather than it having control of us.|`|xzQEDN6paa	better education|`|CT3t80suaa	In Africa they don't use condoms very much at all, and so the disease spreads to a lot of people very fast.

vSKmRuOeaa	When you first begin taking birth control it changes your cycle alot. Its quite normal to skip a period during the first pack. Sometimes you will even get it during the middle of the pack. If your cycle isn't regular by the end of your second pack you should probably ask your doctor. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps! Good luck!|`|9pLdhuBnaa	Yes, it is normal to skip a period when first starting out on the pill such as Yaz.<br>  <br>  The reason that the period is skipping is because the body is trying to adjust to being on the medication.  Just continue with taking your new pack of pills.|`|ArFFUPTBaa	Yes.|`|IFGgQ99iaa	wait, if u dont get it, start a new pack, if u still dont get it, go to a doctor   Best luck!  xoxo|`|MtVxBOZXaa	yes

56974ae7ea3f00a1ea02ba985f923139aa	Hello first off I want to say you have every right to feel the way you do about what you witnessed as a child. I am sure there were a string of unpleasant events that occurred while you grew up at home. Now I also would like you to understand that when we grow up and are no longer physically living in that environment. We will tend to continue to mentally cage ourselves by habitually reliving the past in present day form. This happens because we have not dealt with suppressed emotions. This is a self defense mechanism triggered by our ego mind with the intent of self preservation. Now some relief. You can get through this if you want too. You need to start within yourself to seek the answers you need. You will not find resolution by looking on the outside. Let me explain you can find great help through self help books as well as professional psychological services. None of this will serve you well until you look within and see plus recognize your mental and emotional patterns. We as humans have the best monitoring system in nature. We can not monitor our thoughts and speak at the same time. Yet we can monitor our emotions every moment of every day. How this works focus on what feels good. Keep in mind our emotions control our thoughts, our thoughts control our thinking pattern. So how you feel and what you are thinking goes hand in hand.  Your most predominant thought patterns are an exact match a mirror of what you experience in your life. Negative emotions/thoughts/thinking begets negative experiences in life every time. Positive emotions/thoughts/thinking begets positive experiences in life every time. Learn to and apply your ability to monitor your emotions. Replace the negative emotions with positive emotions accentually reprogram your brain to be more positive. Keep in mind the ego/mind is like a three year old child. The first time you introduce something new it rejects it. The second time reluctant but a little more accepting. The third time willing and accepting to try something new. Have patience and don't give up. Do not be afraid to face yourself remember it is only you. Most importantly you are much loved in this life never forget that.|`|eDKSKqcSaa	That is really tough for a kid. And now you can remember it its just not going away. I do think it would help to talk it over with someone. You might find just one session with a counsellor helps. You might find a course of therapy helps you learn different ways of dealing with thoughts. This can be helpful for people who HAVENT had a trauma in childhood but struggle with their personality/mood. For you I think give yourself the best chance you can. No kid deserves an abusive parent. Be kind to the kid that you were and seek some kind of support. You deserve it.<br>  Best of luck, Debs|`|4k7AHnvAaa	Seek help if you have somewhere to go. Sometimes talking to someone is the best thing you can do.<br>  <br>  If there are any psychiatrists out there reading this, please don't take offense.. but from my experience, they can do more harm than good. But then it really depends who you go too.<br>  <br>  Really crappy answer I know, and the last thing anyone wants to hear, but time can be the best of healers, especially if you have someone to talk about it with.<br>  <br>  Hope things improve.|`|uJGMmSEraa	Seek help. It never goes away. It will sit in your psyche and just fester and grow until you can't handle it anymore. Something as traumatic as that should be acknowledged. Write about it. Talk to a friend. Find a therapist. Do whatever you feel you need to do , but never stuff it.|`|05ro4YOtaa	See a counselor if you think it will help. More importantly, don't let a horrible experience define who you are.  You are making the choices in your life so succeed in spite of the past and put it behind you instead of giving it so much control over you.  I wish you well.|`|WOqyVFO3aa	this is a big problem and could seriously affect you later on in life so i would go see someone while your still growing so that you can adapt...i also suggest you spend some time with your mother to try and see the good memories when you think of her...x|`|qVZoOUtraa	go talk to a councler? im the same way with death....mom died almost 5 tears ago and anything death scares the shhit out of me...p cant let my hands touch a certian way, i cant think about anyones death...im a severe hypocderac...its got me so screwed up...talk to someone, talking makes people feel better|`|rwrDD14Jaa	you should go see a professional about your problems and maybe confront both your parents about that night. Also you should confide in a close friend or family member about your problems and they'll offer support so it'll be easier to get through it.|`|pRDuEqEpaa	Its hard to get over any traumatic event.

Dont be afraid to ask for help.|`|oDLdqrJfaa	Uh....your kidding right? what is this some joke to you guys.|`|dh0av988aa	watch the video Two Girs One Cup.it will make u forget about everything else|`|ParFJxnSaa	See Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, at <a href="http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris" rel="nofollow">http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris</a> in sections 33 - 34, and examine the <a href="http://1-800-therapist.com/" rel="nofollow">http://1-800-therapist.com/</a> & <a href="http://www.metanoia.org/choose/" rel="nofollow">http://www.metanoia.org/choose/</a> websites, and use the locators in sections 33 - 34, and section 1, and phone book, and/or various associations for psychiatrists and psychologists, to find the nearest one using EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing therapy).<br>  <br>  In EMDR, a therapist will ask you to revisit a traumatic event and remember the feelings, negative thoughts, or memories associated with it. While you are doing this, the therapist may hold up two fingers about eighteen inches from your face and move them from side to side. You will be told to track the movement of the therapist’s fingers with your eyes. <br>  <br>  As you concentrate on the traumatic event during therapy, you are trying to bring its memory to life. The mental imagery you are able to conjure up during the therapy session is then processed, aided by your eye movements, facilitating the processing of painful memories, enabling some of the powerful emotional states involved to be discharged to some degree, and helping to achieve resolution and a state involving less painful emotions.<br>  <br>  EMDR has 8 stages. Professional EMDR is always much preferable, and Opester, (who gives it a glowing recommendation) a therapist with more than 20 years experience, and a former contributor, here, stated that it was one of only two disorders which can be completely cured.|`|OUbNSXjJaa	Always it is better to forget the bad past. It is the rule of life. Let us think of bright future for all of us.|`|0NcRUSCoaa	God, what a dreadful experience for you.  It is not too late for you to get some help with this, understandably, it has effected you deeply.  Try and get some counselling to help you deal with this-it will always be part of you, but you can and deserve to get some peace with it.  Don't let it effect the rest of your life-you deserve better than that.|`|OvXqFJzMaa	i'm so sorry<br>  u should really get help<br>  michael tait - all you got<br>  that song helps me aloot<br>  when im sad<br>  hope i helped!<br>  but u know what u can really<br>  go ofor help in a church <br>  i recomend christian <br>  don't be scared to ask 4 help <br>  honestly i really hope i helped !<br>  keep holding on!|`|JPAYaFgsaa	aww. im sorry.<br>  <br>  i advise you get help just in case.<br>  my uncles says you need some help for your own good.. only if you want it though. once you do get help you will be able to accept your life better and you will cope better :D<br>  good luck|`|KGOxYkh7aa	seek help. thats what people who have had experiences like that do.<br>  its ok to do that, trust me you need closure.|`|F5bT2wAraa	Hi,<br>  Thanks for sharing.  Yes, every body has problems but not every body acknowledges that he is unable to solve his problems by himself.  Some ignore it meaning they are fine with a "not so happy life".  And some try to find a balance like you and therefore move forward.  That means "God" is moving you up.  This acknowledgment is a spiritual achievement and shows a higher taste.  They say sometimes the most beautiful flowers are born amongst the worst thorns.  Have you heard that?  To solve my own problems I chose meditation.  By meditation I found that there is a mode in material nature which is called ignorance and sometimes people act under that mode and show abusive behavior.   Thus I was able to forgive them.  As I found that I too was at times under the same mode of ignorance.  So I said please forgive me as I forgive them.  I can tell you more if you were interested in meditation.  Feel free to email.|`|9UQlhzitaa	yea dude you need help<br>  <br>  but start first with a pastor then if you need to seek more professional help<br>  <br>  best of luck to you and it is good that you realized you need something to deal with this|`|IHDVQs3kaa	Sure, everyone has problems, but your memory is of an extremely traumatic event for one so young.  I would seek professional help.  Good Luck|`|IARYnu6zaa	Everyone does have problems, but something like that can drastically affect you.<br>  Get some help, there is no harm in trying.|`|3y9AlP6Raa	Talk to your folks together, and prepare to be wrong.|`|uzZuwtgXaa	You need to see a shrink /counsellor.|`|2SzLx5Knaa	i would be traumatized too,<br>  i would seek help.<br>  i am so sorry.<br>  ):|`|QpO1a3b8aa	First of all, you have to be really strong to get over such violence, and for that I commend you. Facing similar childhood experiences that I would never have the guts to reveal on Yahoo, and I don't think anyone can get over these acts. Don't blow it off. There are people who face difficulties, but this isn't just one of those things. These are extremely traumatic events! I think I even remember a few times going places to 'talk about it', but even more I remember the attacks. I highly doubt it would have happened just one time, and I hate to say these events shape you into the person you are today. Be better than this and grow. You can't forget it, but you can move on. <br>  <br>  Other than talking to a professional about it, personally I would confront my parents about it, if I still had ties to them. It is important that they know what they did to you and can then evolve from the 'Elephant in the Room' subject. Learn the details.<br>  <br>  Most importantly, don't think of this as your fault. Don't take it on yourself to bear the burden, and reflect it among yourself. <br>  <br>  You are also a college student, and I think talking to a professional would lift these unneeded stressors from your life.<br>  <br>  I hope your not lying, and this helps!
XHvaws8baa	yeah the same exact thing happened to me. it was sooo annoying!<br>  it should go away the next morning because when i woke up it was gone|`|quiFJfEtaa	I would try eye drops, then rinsing eye in water. Also, try pulling the eyelid away from your face and down over your eye, bling and r elease.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped!!!|`|NExcJrQ4aa	yeah i ahd that once, it went eventually, like next day or whatever. but if tis still there the next day or next day after that. make an optitions appointment :)
937d8516b6bac65675aebed05fbfdfc9aa	you are perfect so be proud of your size you are perfect|`|q0ce9dEnaa	That means if you lost weight, your penis would appear to look longer, even though it is really six inches. Try going on a diet to make it look longer ;)|`|1fkLC96Vaa	most men rubb oil like (hair) on it at niight and wait till somethingg happens..or take extends hhaaa lol
QxIhMHwAaa	My left eyelid usually does it in response to great stress. Usually once I've solved the stressful situation or bypassed it, the twitching goes away.|`|uD7giDNjaa	I get these to, so do a lot of people. For most people eye twitching is not a serious condition and typically results from excessive fatigue or stress. However, it can also be caused by:<br>  Prolonged staring or eye strain<br>  Neurological disorders<br>  Possibly Hereditary<br>  Corneal irritation or injury<br>  Lack of sleep.<br>  <br>  <br>  So just get more sleep and it should be fine.|`|N3xdqu7laa	It means you sometimes get a twitch on your eyelid.<br>  It's nothing to worry about, the muscles in your eyelids are small so can be sent twitching fairly easily.<br>  <br>  Unless it's causing you pain, or the eyelid swells up, there is no need to worry.|`|jxTOmGnHaa	Aha, its normal.<br>  It either means that you are stressed, and you need to relax.  Or youve had to much caffine, you either you squint.  Go down below and it has al the reasons why.|`|IFRfSetCaa	More than likely it's from stress.  Try to keep your mind off of it...the more you think about it, the more it's going to twitch.|`|KcdzO9Bqaa	This means you have nerves in your eyelids...and they are reacting to something....maybe they just want some exercise?
n7KvCEMaaa	Best Case Scenario is a urinary tract infection.  Worst Case Scenario it is a sexually transmitted disease.  I highly doubt what you had to eat today has anything to do with what color your urine is.  If you drink Pepsi all day your urine is not going to come out looking like Pepsi.  Best thing to do is go to your nearest ER.|`|98p5v51zaa	This is a sign of kidney stones. As the stones move around in the kidney they can cause scratches which allows blood to enter into the bladder. Since the blood is heavier than the urine when you urinate the urine may flow first and appear clear, as the bladder empties the blood that has settled will come out last and can appear as an orange or red discharge. When the stones move into the urinary track {and trust me you will know when this happens} the amount of blood may increase along with extreme pain. So get to the doctor and get checked or you'll soon be on your way to an emergency room.|`|7aiF5DX5aa	I'm no expert on this subject, but try this link for more info. Hope it helps and good luck.|`|deebXXoHaa	probably nothing, but get it checked out anyways.|`|yTAXDL5Jaa	UTI, drink more water, if it does nto clear up, you have a UTI, and you need antibotics.|`|q0ce9dEnaa	You probably have a slight infection which can be cured with simple medicine that can be given to you by a doctor.

And of course your diet intake of calcium and as always, proper exercise.  Those two factors have more to do with your final height and weight.

Honestly, the best thing for me was Proactive.  Give it a shot.|`|QePbhS8Caa	I have a couple of cousins who swear by Proactive, so I second that. You could also try seeing a dermatologist. My aunt went to one when she was a teen and had really bad acne. It helped her quite a bit.<br>  <br>  Do not pop the zits. You're making it worse by picking at them because it spreads the bacteria deeper into the skin, on top of the skin and onto your fingers. Not to mention the scarring. You could have permanent pock marks from zits you pop. <br>  <br>  I've heard that putting a dab of toothpaste on the bumps overnight helps to dry them up. I get blackheads on my nose sometimes and I use face wash that's anti-blackhead and those Bioré strips.
XTfr3uKQaa	Okay....no breakfast? pizza rolls for lunch? Uh...yeah that's not going to help.<br>  You need to have some sort of breakfast, i bet that if you ate something you would notice that you're hungry, or at least bring something to eat on the way or once you get to school. Not eating breakfast slows down your metabolism so your body will absorb fat and calories way more and you will be hungrier throughout the day.<br>  To lose weight and eat health you need to up your fruit, vegetable and water intake by alot. Try just having an apple or banana for breakfast. Find a fruit that you really like and try eating that for breakfast. It will help wake you up, boost your metabolism and the glucose will go to your brain to help you think. <br>  For lunch, pack a lunch if you cant find healthy things at school. Try making a sandwich or some sort with whole grain bread, lay off on the cheese, and bring something like snow peas, cucumber slices, or apple slices to eat along with it. Or you can make a salad with dark greens, avacado, and whatever other veggies you like.<br>  You shouldn't be eating the same thing every night for dinner. Switch it up and keep alot of veggies in your dinner. Try not to eat too late at night.<br>  The reason your legs probably hurt in PE is cause you probably dont stretch enough. Do little stretches before and after class and this will probably help alot.<br>  Walking is great for losing weight! Take a half hour brisk walk after dinner every night. Every 15 minutes of brisk walking burns approx.100 calories! If you walked for an hour thats 400 calories! Thats an entire meal.<br>  Write down everything you eat and notice where you are eating things that are high in fat, sugar or calories. <br>  If you are a person who needs dessert, try things like  plain yogurt with honey, apple slices in sugar and cinnamon, 100 calorie packs and other low calorie desserts. <br>  To get rid of flab like you said, do strengh training. Things like going to the gym, yoga, pilates, at home mat exercises will help with this. Try picking one or more activities like this and do them 3 times a week for an hour. <br>  stop eating pizza rolls at lunch.|`|w2pttJfeaa	Start by having breakfast! A bowl of cereal, or some fruit, something to get your metabolism going.  Cut out the pizza rolls and switch to something that's not fried!  You need to burn 3500 calories in order to lose one pound, the best way to do it is to cut your intake by 500 calories and by burning 500.  Whatever you choose to do, do it slowly!  You're more likely to keep weight off when it's lost slowly.|`|S3AU0KDiaa	Basically, stop eating(or at least greatly reduce) all the fatty junk food that we both know you love. Eat more fruit instead of the crap.<br>   Start walking every afternoon after school, or riding your bike if you like that. 10-15 mins at first, then after a week or so, try to go for a bit longer, like 30 mins. Increase the pace as you can.|`|FX2H4aSOaa	do crunches and side cruches to get rid of the side fat,<br>  lift weights if you don't have any then life some heavy stuff around your house,<br>  go jogging or walking for a half an hour a day,<br>  eat healthier BY THAT i mean<br>  more water, less junk food, limit soda,<br>  and don't eat 2 hours before bed it's bad for you<br>  good luck :D|`|0QURsUu8aa	well ive read this in an article, but one person switched their meals and ate dinner first, in the morning, such as steak or pizza. the calories burned off fast because everyone is usually more active in the mornings and since you move around, unlike at night, it burns off your calories. <br>  <br>  they ate a normal-portioned lunch, and worked out by just taking her dog out and walking it, and ate a small portion of food at dinner such as a bowl of cereal or a piece of wheat toast.<br>  <br>  you shouldnt try to eat diet pills because they have side affects and only last for a short time. Start out by changing your meal plans and look for easy but effective exercises online<br>  <br>  :)|`|BIno6DOiaa	Targetted weight reduction is quite difficult, some peeple would state impossible, however the one diet which definitely worked for me is wu-yi tea, it can be seen in the resource box below, they have a limited number of free trials remaining, it has been reported in Reader's Digest and USA Today. I shed 25 pounds, it definitely does produce results!|`|cKSbZBt8aa	Start doing push-ups at home: 3 sets of 25 reps, break between.  Walking is a good exercise, walk around the block from home a few times.  Build on it, do more as time progreses and you get used to it.   Eat more protein foods (fish, chicken, nuts, beans) for metabolism and muscle.  Eat more vegetables for fibre to fight fat tisue.  Eat healthy snacks between meals.  Pizza rolls are questionable!  Stay away from sugar foods and sugar drinks.  Snack at breakfast if you have little time (tin tuna, cheese, can beans).  Walk with a back pack with books for added weight.

Qby4QaV9aa	Blood is diverted to the sexual parts during height of sexual arousal and may acoount for some of the feeling of pins and needles. - If you think about it - pins and needles is caused by restricted blood flow (most often) and the nerves reacting to this. When the blood is diverted from 'less important' areas and your excitation is high - then you maybe just feel this effect more profoundly than many others might.    It is not unnatural as long as it is transient - and when the blood flow returns to normal your feelings go away.    It is possible that these feeling could precede climax - as you raech the peak of stimulation - maybe as yet you haven't quite gone that far.    There would normally be a distinct muscular and physical feeling when the orgasm occurs.|`|OF98s0Xfaa	hey usually tingling effect occurs in people who are diabetic ....go for a blood test.....but i agree with puma u k|`|pWqYGLOLaa	I get this right before the big O.. : ) My fingers especially.. so i think thats why..

And I'm sure they don't make keys out of lead anymore, if they ever did.|`|PMR7RovEaa	it is bad for your teeth. it takes the enamel of and makes them week and prone to getting cavities etc.|`|DKuly5cBaa	obviously|`|F8Yj3U9caa	no  but clean it first|`|OItPJZjBaa	I would have to say yes. Of course besides the germs, everywhere you put that key whether you put in the key slot, set on table, dropped them on the floor or ground, etc. Think about it, if you dropped you keys on the ground, think about the fact who walked there, did someone spit there, did an animal do there business there, etc. ( Sorry if I seem a bit graphic).

Keys are passed hand to hand from people who are not only sick but my have something deadly on them like a disease or illness that is very contagious.  Also, everyone drops their keys to the ground, correct?  You could be picking up anything from the ground such as bacteria or anything else that could make you seriously ill it's being put in your mouth.

05d37286bed96dc28e6b203a5182c768aa	Me too, glad to meet you! I've been on a C-Pap machine for about a month. I have the full face mask, & I'm dreaming now where before I did not dream. My dreams are crazy too, but normally you can make since of how your subconscious works. I dream pt that the topping I was putting on my desert was oreo cream pudding? It was suppose to be whipped topping, so I tasted it & it was so good I ate it all. The next morning while remembering my dream I remembered I had made a sugar free oreo cookie pudding for my mother, she's diabetic, so I rushed to the fridge & the pudding was still there, then I remembered as I was making it I wondered what it taste like?<br>  <br>  I'm just happy that I'm getting to dream again, for over 30 years I never dreamed, if I did I could never remember what I was dreaming about. Now I remember what it was like to get out of bed as a kid, remember how hard it was to wake up? Now when I wake up it's almost like I'm drunk, I've been told that's rem sleep, welcome to a good night sleep!<br>  <br>  When you think of it your in a race, on a journey, you are on the road to the mountain of Jehovah, where righteous is to dwell, of course your subconscious is going to go in all directions, it's been pinned up a long time. The reason your so tired is, you are finally sleeping in rem.<br>  It takes a little longer to wake up now, because your in deep sleep where before you were waking up most of the night.<br>  <br>  I woke up 47 times every hour, the longest I stopped breathing was 27 seconds, I have severe sleep-apnea.

m1TSG9Cvaa	I would suggest a cleansing diet. I lost 12 pounds in 9 days and then 28 pounds in less than a month. I also lost a lot of inches too!   I learned that cleansing will help the body get rid of toxins.  Toxins come from a lot of things like fast food, pollution, food additives and preservatives and lots of other things.  The toxins get stored in the fat in our body.  To get rid of the fat, we have to get rid of the toxins by cleansing the body.  This made sense to me and I decided to try a cleanse program and it worked.  The weight came off fast and this kept me motivated to keep going, not like other diets where the weight loss it too slow. I did Jenny Craig, Weight Watcher and Medifast.  If you want to learn more call the toll free number 1-877-587-4647 or check out the website.  This was the first time I ever did a cleanse, it was easy and I feel better.

At most maybe 3 lbs a week if you really worked at it. Eat a minimum of 1200 calories a day and exercise. Don't do lower than 1200 calories a day or your body will go into starvation mode. That will slow down your metabolism and defeat all your hard work. You didn't put on 40 lbs in a month, give it time to come off properly so you don't gain it back.|`|t81MEJ82aa	The human species would not survive if we could drop weight that fast. Even pushing it out to 5 months would be too hard for most people. You don't want to drop weight that fast because it's too hard on the body, particularly the kidneys and you'll have to worry more about having excessive loose skin after you lose the weight. Plus you'll be likely to just gain it all back and then some.<br>  <br>  If it were that easy then nobody'd be fat. There is no way around it, a healthy balanced diet + exercise.|`|cB247Azuaa	That's not healthy.|`|WoAAdxHEaa	Not possible without completely starving your body...or lipo. three orfour months, sure. not 1.|`|5iDp1uVMaa	not possible.<br>  maybe with liposuction|`|0YmH0Zfkaa	I am sorry but that is ABSOLUTELY impossible.

0aBlpLvsaa	Hi;<br>  I am a medical student in Europe. How I got here ? I was looking for another Yahoo home page instead of the U.S. Yahoo.<br>  This kind of rosacea can be quite problematic. It usually needs several months of drug treatment - but it is the only way to get rid of it.<br>  <br>  In the web search I made I also found following advice : the patient should avoid known exacerbating factors, such as hot drinks, alcohol, and extremes of temperature. . and should be encouraged to use a noncomedogenic high-factor sunscreen when exposed to sunlight and wind.<br>  But you need the drugs if we are talking Rosacea granulomatosa<br>  All the best !

F8tQkDPcaa	Here's some good information for you to know (extracted from this site): www.panic-away.tk<br>  <br>  <br>  "This Is The Key To Being Panic Attack Free...<br>  <br>  You Must Learn To Break The Fear Of Having Another Panic Attack Or You Will Never Experience Complete Freedom From Anxiety <br>  <br>  <br>  -The anticipation of a panic attack starts the wave cycle of anxiety in motion. <br>  <br>  -The foundation of a future panic attack is laid hours before you actually experience one.<br>  <br>  -The slightest stress trigger will then launch the full blown panic attack into motion. <br>  <br>  -Panic manifests itself in approximately 20 minute wave like formations. <br>  <br>  <br>  This Is Where Your Problem Lies <br>  <br>  There is one key factor that makes the difference between those who fully eliminate panic attacks from their lives and those who do not. The key ingredient is not medication, lifestyle changes, or relaxation exercises. It is when the individual no longer fears the thought of having a panic attack. <br>  <br>  This may seem like a simplified and obvious observation but give it careful consideration. The one thing that has you searching for a solution to anxiety and panic attacks this very moment is the fear of having another one.<br>  <br>  The first time a person experiences a panic attack it can feel like their world is falling down around them. Nowhere feels safe as the anxiety becomes like a stalker lurking in the background. <br>  <br>  When this happens people begin to either avoid situations that make them anxious or they medicate themselves to the point where they are numb to the fear. I am sure you will agree neither of the above is a satisfactory solution."<br>  <br>  Extracted from: www.panic-away.tk

1dcfd1cbe002b5b4354aea9bd5db367eaa	Unfortunately, there is no cure as of yet, to include stem cell therapy.  Although some stem cell therapy is effective, so far the trials have only yielded minor successes.  They are using a treatment normally reserved for leukemia patients, and it is being trialed on MS patients due to anecdotal reports of people who got this leukemia treatment having their MS cured.  It is essentially a "reset" of the immune system.<br>  <br>  The treatment is autologous blood or bone marrow stem cell transplant.  This is a fairly invasive procedure, first involving stimulating stem cell production, harvesting those stem cells, and then using chemotherapy to destroy all white blood cells in the body, which then have to regenerate following the transplant.  Out of 85 patients being tracked, 18 patients (21%) showed EDSS improvement of greater than one point.  78% of SPMS sufferers showed zero disease progression at three years following the treatment.  There is a risk in this treatment; out of the 106 known patients, seven have died.  The potential risk will have to be tested completely.<br>  <br>  Now, the question you posed was "can your child's cord blood cure MS" and the answer,  today, is no.  In any stem cell treatment that has actually worked, the patients own stem cells are encouraged to grow and then harvested.  These are called "adult stem cells" and they have been shown today to effectively treat more than 70 diseases and conditions.  Some of those are cord blood stem cells.<br>  <br>  Note the difference is between adult stem cells (or non-embryonic stem cells) and embryonic stem cells, which are derived from embryos which are destroyed as part of the stem cell harvesting process.<br>  <br>  Cord blood stem cells have so far effectively treated Cerebal Palsy, hepatitis, Hurler's Syndrome, paralysis, and have been able to regenerate the liver.<br>  <br>  hth
jdZfzZUjaa	The testicles are very sensitive organs, and even a minor injury can cause testicle pain or discomfort. Testicle pain may arise from the testicle itself or from the structure behind the testicle (epididymis). Testicle pain may also be caused by problems that start in the groin or lower abdomen. <br>  <br>  Severe testicle pain that comes on quickly can be a sign of testicular torsion — a twisted testicle that can quickly lose its blood supply.

89bda364b87960be6b997f44b208722eaa	You may have Plantar Fasciitis which is a common type of heal pain.  I recently had the same problem and my doctor recommended orthodics, anti-inflamatory medication and stretching exercises.  You can get a pretty good set of over-the-counter orthodics for around $40 to $50.  Custom orthodics cost much more but may be covered by insurance.  My doctor initially recommended the over-the-counter orthodics.  When my condition did not substantially improve, he suggested the custom fit orthodics.  He said that insurance companies are more likely to cover custom orthodics if other treatments were tried and only had limited results.  Thus, your doctor may not prescribe the custom orthodics right away.  <br>  <br>  The previous answer mentioned cortizone shots which are effective for some people.  I did get a shot but only on my third or fourth appointment.  The shot did not work well for me but I have a friend that got great results from a shot.<br>  <br>  My heal pain is now just about gone but it did take about a year.|`|585b7dfd77e867b2877fe507e55eb149aa	My husband had heel pain also.

Teeth move all the time, so when there's available room, they all go for it.<br>  <br>  Sucks, I know.|`|NG6eeCfuaa	Evening: I had my very rear molar pulled as a teen. My wisdom tooth, which really came in around when I was about 19, has slowly and steadily over the years bridged the gap. There still is a gap of course, but yes, the wisdom tooth has moved forward in my mouth and occupies much of the space once occupied by my extracted molar.

bjcjQ4zfaa	In genes, you have dominant and recessive traits.<br>  <br>  Brown eyes are dominant so 3 times out of 4 if a mom has brown eyes and a dad has blue eyes their kid will have brown eyes. But there is still that 1 out of 4 the kid will have blue eyes.<br>  <br>  Your dad got a recessive gene. So in his genetic patterns he has the genes to be tall and to be short, and it was most likely he'd be tall, but by chance the height gene that was activated for him at conception happened to be a short one.<br>  <br>  So he passed on both heights to you. By chance he is short but the genetics inside him are those of a tall person. So you have tall genes.<br>  <br>  Growth is not the same for everyone either. I stopped growing at 14 when most males stop growing at 16-19.|`|5n13XFuhaa	Do you not like beeing that height?<br>  I am 5'7 and LOVE it.

xmmX3JTRaa	Do not run in the beginning - try walking instead, run a little, wald, run, walk etc. Increase running time over time.<br>  <br>  As for diet:<br>  often but little<br>  lots of fruits and vegetables and a lot of water.<br>  no soda.<br>  <br>  do not eat late - at least 3 hours before going to bed.|`|7PqwM6QXaa	-Drink lots of water<br>  -eat your veggies and fruit! :D<br>  -Try not to eat a lot of junk food<br>  -Work on building up your core. Do exercises like pushups, situps, crunches, stretching, look up ''core workouts'' on google, on my cross country team, we name our exercises, but differently so I dont wanna confuse you.|`|S3AU0KDiaa	Exactly what Soccer L said, but I would focus more on cardio exercise if you are wanting to lose some fat. Include what s/he said if you want an all over well being.<br>   Invite one or two of your girlfriends over and go for a walk with them. They probably want to get fit for prom too. You can chat with them as you go : )<br>   Try to do this as often as you can, like every day if possible, for as long as you can, up to about an hour, but starting at about 20 mins is ok. To make it harder as you get fitter, increase your walking pace, and you can try to run or jog for a bit as well. i.e. run from one power pole to the next, then walk for four. Don't have to use power poles, can use housing blocks or just pick a parked car or tree or whatever to run to.<br>   Hope this helps|`|sm2EurMIaa	set a schedule. Maybe  . run 3 times a week for 45 minutes . I know it sounds like a lot right now , but when you run, keep a steady pace , and keep going for as long as you can . When you DO need to stop, don't just stop, walk. When you catch your breath again try running again . After doing this a few times a week, it'll be no time before you're in good shape. <br>  <br>  As for dieting , count calories and eat healthy. aim for around 1500 calories a day . <br>  <br>  If you follow this , you'll have weight gone in no time!<br>  <br>  hope this helps!|`|fdZpw6Lsaa	Hi thanks for the NVQ answer 100% your a star! -hey!

Cut out fastfood/junkfood/candy/sweets/fried foods. Drink more water. If you eat white breads or pastas, switch to whole wheat/grain. Don't go over 2000 calories a day. Go jogging, swimming, running or anything that will get your heart rate up and make you sweat. I lost 10 pounds in 3 months by jogging and watching what I eat. Its hard and challenging, but if you really want to do it, it shouldn't be a problem.

13k2WKx8aa	No. Although some hospitals may be filled with assholes who will butt you out.<br>  <br>  Hospitals are required to take in things like gunshot wounds, heart attacks, and all of those other immediate life threatening injuries and conditions. They have to take you in and stabilize you.<br>  <br>  At least that's what they do at Mass General Hospital and BU medical in Boston.<br>  <br>  It's those, what I like to call, "dumb" things that ERs can get filled with. You know. People with a cough and sore throat thinking they have TB. Those things that could be solved by a 5 minute doctor's visit (which in turn is actually and most literally tens to hundreds of times cheaper than going to an ER).
AsDMUcciaa	Easy mistake. 1 Calorie = 1000 calories = 1 kilocalorie. So, 95602.3 calories is = ~95 Calories.<br>  <br>  Generally, when talking about food people mean Calorie (with a capital C), but use Calorie and calorie interchangeably. Google's converter requires the specific term. I'm still not exactly sure which group of morons came up with that terminology.|`|aXnVFFUkaa	it would be 95 cal

s5i9atFpaa	It's a quick swab of the throat, kind of like with a cotton swab. It's small, you probably won't gag. Relax while they do it and you'll be fine. Depending on your symptoms, they may not even do the test. <br>  Best Wishes to You.|`|I8MUpN04aa	they just take a swab on a qtip and send it to the lab to be tested. you might even just have tonsillitis.|`|qdw3ZOYFaa	There may be reasons/s why your breath smells weird and any or all of the following could be the cause:<br>  1) Decayed teeth or gum problems (have a look in the mirror..see if you have trouble with your teeth or gums)<br>  2) Sinus infection (do you feel dizzy sometimes? do you sneeze a lot? have you got lumps behind your ears?)<br>  3) Stomach trouble...do you have an acidic stomach?<br>  4) Spicy food...garlick gives you weird breath???|`|0aBlpLvsaa	No, they don't. What they do, is they stick in your mouth, not further<br>  than you can see yourself. They sometimes can use a spray which<br>  will make you won't fell anything ( it last for 10-15 min).<br>  If you are worried about streptococci you should make the test. It is a curable disease WHICH can  only get much worse without  treatment|`|QgiBC5dIaa	They swab the back of your throat with a q-tip like utensil, it doesn't hurt, it can make you gag a little, but it's generally quick and quite painless...|`|WD6uLJxvaa	they take one of those long q-tip things and swab the back of your throat, its no big deal
wYrS24e2aa	well dude there are many places that dont like gays if you really have a problem with that move to san francisco everybodys gay there. Its the gay capital of the world. But since this is who you really are if you really are gay and its not just a phase or something , then you should tell anybody who calls you homo to go **** themselves. Come on dude you gotta stand up for yourself. Now if you havent come out of the closet yet, thats a different issue. But from what I've seen and heard once you do come out of the closet it will feel like a big pressure has been lifted off of your soldiers and you will feel better. Become friends with some girls. Girls love having gay friends. And build from that.|`|GKINbVhsaa	I see T-shirts with pictures of two guys kissing or two girls kissing and in big letters it says "NO SHAME"....<br>  <br>  you know, its funny, because you would never see the word "shame" when it comes to a guy and a girl kissing... its just considered a symbol of love... but when it comes to gay people, its always a symbol of "no shame"<br>  <br>  if there was absolutely NOTHING to be ashamed of, why do gay people have to always convince everyone around them that they are not ashamed... <br>  <br>  If being gay was such a natural thing, why don't we see animals in nature doing it?|`|29e999153715416dcc6bab042f16f0c4aa	@ Hillary<br>  <br>  There are reports of gay penguins and others in the animal kingdom.

Society places a social stigma on atypical sexuality.<br>  <br>  Disinterest in women sexually doesn't mean you aren't a man. As long as you're interest in men isn't because you feel that you should have been a girl, you are a man. Either way, it's cool.<br>  <br>  You need to become comfortable with your sexuality, maybe try coming out to a few close, open minded friends (another gay man, perhaps). But you don't have to come out if you don't want to.<br>  <br>  Just don't marry some poor girl and have a family with her to hide your sexuality. That's not right.|`|bbdOikOqaa	Omg i cannot believe what i am reading from these other members. Do not worry about being gay. A lot of people are. It is more socially acceptable these days but there is a lot of stigma and issues with peoples sexuality these days still around regardless of the issue being more accepted. I understand that this i an issue for you and i am very sorry you have to here this abuse. Dont listen to any one telling you you need to be more of a man. you are a man. justbecausee you like other men in a sexual way does not make you less of one! You dont have to tell anyone at all if you dont want to it is your personal business. A lot of people in the homosexual community find it hard to come oYou'llou'l know when is right for you. Please dont feel pressured to change who you are xxx|`|FATyhyZ2aa	WHOA!  You're right.  Even though there is a high population of gays in the incorporated areas of Mexico, it's still so taboo by custom.  I think your anxiety is not from gay, but the societal repercussions.  I picked up a Mexican paper in USA w/ story of the attacks on gays.  Be very careful.  I know that our USA universities have support groups on campus.  Have you seen any fliers about gay meetings?  -- I'm not gay & won't mislead you that I accept the life b/c of my faith.  -- But I do worry for people that are in potential harm, just b/c others have not learned to have love for their fellow human. -- Cuidado por favor :(|`|Pef0ZbLZaa	I'm sorry but i find the other answers very rude.<br>  if your gay your gay.<br>  if people have a probblem, its THERE probblem. not yours.<br>  sweetie, i felt like that at first, i told my friends i was bi and they were cool with it, i felt better.|`|AA11626362	Just because you feel different and you dont want others to know that you're gay, the anxiety creeps up then....just be yourself, no one is no one to judge you|`|we2Csi51aa	aww i actually feel bad. i bet youre a sweetie. i know alot of gay guys and they are just fine. be yourself, people will appreciate it!|`|k5QKmP1caa	because your not gay|`|TukfIjEIaa	i agree with kbo-|`|a2fgPVEyaa	There is no reason to feel anxiety.  I personally don't believe in homosexuality, but that doesn't mean anything.  I have gay, bi, and lesbian friends and that means nothing to me.  I don't laugh at them, I don't make fun of them, and I don't put them in situations that make them feel uncomfortable.  <br>  <br>  Maybe this will help.  I am a Christian and the Bible is a constant source of help for me.  Despite warnings against homosexuality, it does also contain this verse that I love.  Read it and maybe it will help.<br>  <br>  Matthew 5:39<br>  "But I say to you, do not resist an evil person; but whoever slaps you on your right cheek, turn the other to him also. <br>  <br>  This verse is just saying that if someone laughs or makes fun of you just turn the other cheek.  Somewhere else in the Bible it says that the best remedy for an evil word is love.  So love these people, and that should make things better.  Good luck, I hope this helped!<br>  <br>  God bless...|`|pGHyYHmMaa	just chill man. most straight guys are cool with gay people, even if they don't show it. in my case i am fine with gays as long as they dont try anything with me and you can still be manly and be gay. unless you are feminine then just hang out with girls.

QKtsjg6jaa	when you starve yourself, your body goes into a starvation mode and begins to eat your stored carbs and eats at your muscle.  your body thinks that ur starved and dont have anything to it, so in order to survive and keep u alive its does that.  so i suggest u dont starve yourself and make a proper workout regimen and maybe see a nutritionist about the right things to eat.  just right down EVERYTHING you eat for a week on a paper, and then look at everything and see what bad foods and snacks u can do without

a3537b118faec65a7494248f77dba9fcaa	Obviously, fruits and veggies are perfect snacks and don't cost too much (depending on what kind of packaging you buy them in or if you buy them individually, by the dozen, etc.), but if you want a little bit of taste with your carrot sticks and broccoli flowerets I would get fat free Italian dressing to dip them in!  Soooo much better for you than Ranch dressing.<br>  <br>  As far as having a sweet tooth goes, I would look into the following foods: Snackwell's cookies (sugar free), Jello sugar free pudding and regular jello, Special K bars and snack bites, 100 calorie packs of anything (Chips Ahoy, Ritz Crackers, PopSecret popcorn, etc,), and crackers like Goldfish because they are baked and not fried.  The hardest part to remember is that you cannot eat foods straight out of the bag!!!  Portion control is key.<br>  <br>  Don't forget to be drinking a lot of water!  Sometimes you may think that your body is craving food when in all actuality you are slightly dehydrated.<br>  <br>  Good luck with the diet!|`|7d534dad7f6d6a84193688b945267a1eaa	It is good to eat small, low calorie snacks in between meals... every 3 hours you should eat something small. It keeps your metabolism going and helps burn more fat. Fruit of course is great... apples, bananas, etc. Also, yogurts are a good, cheap, portable snack... make sure to get the light/lowfat ones. Snackwell and other companies now have boxes of 100 calorie snacks you can buy... this can be kind of pricey, so I suggest buying lite crackers, reading the box for the portion size and counting out that many and putting into a baggie... you can make up your own bags and take them on the go. It's all about the amount you eat... portion control. Baby carrots are great too... Also, peanuts are a good snack and are an appetite suppressent, so you will stay fuller longer... Try raisins, dry fruits, etc... Drink lots of water, it will keep you full and you won't want to eat as much. Green tea is good as well... if you can't afford the bottled stuff, buy the bags and make your own... Good luck!|`|JhKjVgwbaa	YOGOS ARE A AFFORDABLE THINGS ALSO THEY CONTAIN LOW FAT AND  LOW CALORIES|`|c8361b57798b8f345f88c85e27c43d89aa	eat apples they are negative calorie fruit and are very cheap at walmart<br>   abox of special K bars depends where u go can vary anywhere from 1.50 to 3.00 a box got to the dollar store<br>  buy cucmbers or carrots extremely cheap and another negative calorie food there are alot more negative calorie fruits and veggies that are cheap and negative calories<br>  yu can buy low fat yogurt really cheap if u get the right brand and the cheap kind can taste good too,there are even 30 calorie 0 fat yogurts i forgot wat they are called but they are amazing|`|24ead66cc4dae89a54a7d0f0dc2bd765aa	lots of various fruits and veggies you can cut up and nosh throughout the day...jello, yogurt, low fat snack bars...be creative!!!

upvLAyyzaa	I have a public speaking phobia.  I take Klonopin for my panic attacks....works great...isn't that strong either since I take the smallest dose you can get which is .125mg.  Since I've began taking it, my panic attacks are pretty much non-existent anymore.  But when I have to take my public speaking course in college soon, which is going to be one big nightmare, I'll probably need them more than ever!  <br>  <br>  But Klonopin is used for panic attacks, not a public speaking phobia, even though I'm sure it would help with that too.<br>  <br>  But hey, your doc will give you all your options.

If so, that's ridiculous.  99% of people who speak to large groups have anxiety about it...it's the part they love about and it's what makes them want to keep on doing it and getting better at it.  If you don't like it then don't do it but if you have to or feel that you want to but are too nervous then ask someone for help with it...it's not "crappy advice" that they're giving you it just seems as though you want drugs, although at 16 I'm not sure why you wuld want to get into mental disorder meds..unless you actually have one. (fear of public speaking doesn't count) they are addictive and they do have side effects - they can also be dangerous.  You have your whole life to experiment with medication...don't waste your youth.   <br>  <br>  FYI - If you have a doctor that's even half decent he will laugh at you if you ask for medication so you can do public speaking!  pfffft<br>  <br>  I'm sorry if I sound rude but I've seen too many teens get hooked on meds that they should have never been prescribed to them to begin with.

However, it really depends on what type of food you are attaining your protein from and your activity level. <br>  <br>  For example, body builders have a high protein diet but work out intensely, and burn off any extra calories.<br>  <br>  So...the answer you might be looking for is YES.

The main thing is to stick in there. You can't be an addict to food and never exercise if you want to live a healthy life and keep the weight off. I've worked out, done every diet, and all types of classes.<br>  <br>  Nothing works, besides dedication and intelligence towards the subject of losing weight.<br>  <br>  First, depending on how much weight you need to lose, your diet is the first concern. You can't eat 10,000 calories a day and expect the weight to come off, even if you are exercising a lot. Which brings us to the next thing. Duh, Exercising...<br>  <br>  This is a must especially if you need to a lot of weight. Get at least 30 mins of some good hardcore exercising. Do some cardio, in the long run, it's good for the heart.<br>  <br>  However, I find the most hardest part of losing weight/keeping it off, in my diet. It's so hard to keep your fingers out of the cookie jar or those chocolate goodies. I've found a great addition to help any one out, it's a natural weight loss supplement called Proactol. Now don't get all crazy on me and say diet pills don't work. That is true, but not in this case. This one isn't meant to burn pounds while you sit on the couch. It's an appetite suppressant, along with being a fat binder. I saved money on the pills at <a href="http://theweightlossplace.com" rel="nofollow">http://theweightlossplace.com</a> along with getting some good info. It basically makes those fingers not go towards the cookie jar. For me it's the best pill I've tried and I've tried cupboards full. Now this doesn't mean you have to follow my foot steps but I've successfully lost roughly 70 pounds and keeping it off til this day.<br>  <br>  Well good luck and remember what I said, Dedicate.|`|UowJAKCWaa	There are a lot of different types of "diet pills" and some work better than others so you need to understand how and why they work to choose the right one for you.

b34bca47be644e0ef6a339cf479e2cd8aa	You are likely ovulating.  Every healthy women gets a stringy, egg white type consistency discharge when her ovary is getting ready to release an egg.  I am betting htat is what it is.  Keep track of it and you will probably notice you get it at the same time every month.  This is the time you will become pregnant so use protection if you are going to have sex.     I found this to describe the discharge:  There will be changes in your cervical mucus.  The amount of cervical mucus increases as well as the texture.    The quantity and texture change indicates the rising levels of estrogen. When the cervical mucus resembles raw egg whites, woman is generally considered to be at her most fertile.    It is this mucus, resembling raw egg whites, which coats the path that the sperm will take on its journey through the uterus, into the fallopian tubes and to your eggs.|`|DtG4zpM2aa	Clear discharge can be normal - most girls and woman get this to a variable degree, particularly at certain times of the month.  But a change from what you normally have could be a sign of infection.      If you have had unprotected sex you need to get tested for infections as you don't always get any symptoms such as burning when you urinate with infections such as chlamydia but scarring for untreated infection can lead to infertility and obviously you'd be putting future partners at risk as well.   Probably best to go to your local GUM clinic rather than your GP - they are more experienced with problems in this area and keep everything confidential - they don't even pass information on to your GP in most circumstances.  A lot of GUM clinics run on a drop-in basis as well - you may not even need to make an appointment.

XsNqpRWwaa	wow, first of all what a curious boy, but its fine because everyone has questions.<br>  <br>  ok firstly . most women do NOT experience orgasm through vaginal penetration, so clitoral stimulation is usually the best method of masturbation for many females. this is usually achieved with using your fingers to rub the clitoral area or other objects such as a vibrator or using lubrication's with heating and cooling sensations to make it feel better.<br>  there is also another method of masturbation through the g spot which is about two inches facing the ceiling from the inside of the vaginal wall. the upper wall facing the belly button. in order to stimulate this you must  use a motion with your finger as to say "come here" like a point and like your bringing your finger in. its a little tricky to find the g spot  but it feels a little spongy from the rest of the vaginal wall. <br>  <br>  as mentioned before vaginal penetration isn't really for pleasure, mostly psychological. <br>  <br>  hope this answered your question|`|tI0rMvx0aa	just because a girl masturbates it doesn't only mean that she puts her fingers inside the vagina...when a girl masturbates she can simply rub her clitoris with her fingers or rub herself against something...|`|upoH8NP4aa	yup, or they rub their clits. they either use their fingers, or something else like vegetables, toothbrushes, ect.

Always look for low sodium foods|`|W2YtVUqKaa	I pretty much eat what I want I just don't put salt on my food at all. like eggs and stuff. but easier way to get that batwing you want would be just to work your lats. those shapes actually can only be achieved like that. if you don't work out then you ll pretty much look parallel

W2YtVUqKaa	all food go there first for a normal person. your butt and thighs and stomach is just your body's place to store excess calories and fat. although some food will have a higher impact because of the high caloric content. sugar, fat, you get the idea|`|AjBpAPpdaa	It actually depends on your body shape; If you're a pear shape, like me, most of the weight would be around your thighs and butt. Here's a link explaining different body shapes by Trinny & Susannah... <a href="http://images.google.co.uk/imgres?imgurl=http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2007/10_03/pear1710_468x953.jpg&imgrefurl=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-488236/Trinny-Susannah-reveal-12-womens-body-types--you.html&usg=__BzJV47kg76PxmfdaKF-GAZbCHJA=&h=953&w=468&sz=139&hl=en&start=5&tbnid=Gt5-UoRM-lgbmM:&tbnh=148&tbnw=73&prev=/images%3Fq%3Dpear%2Bshape%2B%2Btrinny%2Band%2Bsusannah%26gbv%3D2%26hl%3Den" rel="nofollow">http://images.google.co.uk/imgres?imgurl...</a>|`|nxZQKmjMaa	there are no specific locations on your body to which food settles, although your body shape does play a role. fat content, carbs and calories define whether or not the food is healthy enough to consume on daily basis.  being aware of what you put into your body will give you the advantage of knowing what is healthy and what is not. look on the foods nutrition label to know what you're eating. a healthy diet and exercise will prevent weight gain in the wrong areas.

Obvious vision problems, things are blurry, etc.<br>  -Blood or other fluid coming out of the ears or nose<br>  -Dizziness, unable to walk straight or concentrate, or slurred speech, etc.  Kind of like a drunk test (given that you're not drunk :P )<br>  -Lightheadedness, feeling faint, etc.  You might feel this a little bit, but I mean if you feel really seriously like you're gonna blackout or something.  <br>  -Swelling that spreads a lot past the point of injury, especially around the eyes and under the ears.  I mean if that's the injured area then fine, but I mean if it swells up in places not right nearby that's bad<br>  -Other bad things like problems with breathing, heartbeats, etc. but this usually occurs with back of the head injuries, unless there's too much swelling in the cranium.  <br>  -Nausea or vomiting like you mentioned might also occur.  Although sometimes people get too anxious and it feels like nausea when it's really just psychosomatic, you know?  I'd say it's bad if you throw up, or feel like you're right about to.<br>  <br>  Headache should be expected, but it shouldn't be like severe pain or last more than a few days (generally, it should decrease in intensity along with the swelling).  Just keep icing it and pay attention to what your body's telling you.  You should be just fine a few days I think (swelling might take up to a week depending on how hard it was hit).  Don't stress yourself over it too much, you should be fine|`|OyAyb6bYaa	hahaha, nah dude you'll be fine just keep an eye on it..i fell on concrete at 25 miles per hour skateboarding straight on my head and i had a headache and stuff but it went away..just HURT!!|`|4P7N6XULaa	If there has been no nausea and you have a bruise i think you will live, i often think having an egg is a good thing it shows the bruise has come out and is not eternal.

cKSbZBt8aa	Height is usually governed by your DNA and genetics, in this case Mexican.  If you exercise and maintain a healthy body you will stand tall and straight.  Height does not matter.  I know plenty of 'short' girls who are a lot taller in personality (and looks) than the so called model types.  I think 'short' girls are generally cuter.  Be yourself, live healthy, be proud.|`|S3AU0KDiaa	Yes race CAN be a factor in your height. You don't see many pygmies in the NBA.<br>  <br>   At 18 for a female I think you are pretty well finished growing. 5'1-5'2 isn't too short.<br>   To get the most out of any possible growth you may have left, make sure you eat a balanced diet.|`|ixOE0onnaa	yes to be fact it is have to be thTat/

2qbLrHBKaa	You are most likely having irrational fears because it is too hard to deal with the real, bigger issues facing you now. The flu is no big deal, you get sick, it sucks, and you're better and back to normal in less than a week. It's nothing to worry about if you really think about it. Deep down you know this and subconsciously you choose to focus on that because it is safer than touching upon the real issues in your life that are harder/ more serious/ more permanent. If you can recognize this and try to face the more important issues the hypochondria will go away on its own. BUT (and it's a big but) that means you have to face the bigger problems in your life.|`|qdw3ZOYFaa	Forget it! You are worrying over nothing. I have a daughter like that. She is 29 years old in a couple of months..and she carries with her Dettol hand lotion in her handbag. When she touches hand rails on trains and buses or anywhere outside.. she smears this Dettol hand lotion on her hands in order to kill germs which she may have picked up. This is what is called compulsive obsessive behaviour. This is unnecessary. All you have to do when you get home is to wash your hands..that is all. In order to get sick from anything which may be contagious..you will have to have an extremely weak immune system. If you are fairly healthy you will be alright....as your body takes care of itself.|`|y7cZL9bzaa	I'm the same way! If I hear about any disease I automatically start hyperventilating because I think I have it. Recently I started just really thinking about how many people have it worse then me or are very sick right now. I know this might not work for you but it really helps me alot. hope this helps! =].|`|QzfHwGOQaa	I am the same way. It controls my life. <br>  Now I see a "talking doctor." <br>  It has helped me, I have many phobias, emotophobic, germaphobic. ect.<br>  I recommend seeing one. It really helps.|`|4BBjhHAnaa	Any time you have these thoughts just remind yourself of the reality--  it is actually worse for you to be constantly applying antibacterial lotion to your hands.  Your body needs exposure to the everyday pathogens around you in order to maintain a strong immune system.<br>  <br>  Let me give you an example--  This past summer I worked in a cash room at a zoo.  My primary job was to count money.  While counting I would eat, touch my face, etc. with out washing my hands.  We didn't wear gloves or anything like that.  I haven't even gotten a cold since (and I normally get at least one ugly cold every winter).<br>  <br>  As for new diseases or hearing about diseases and thinking you have one-- realize that usually these are only contracted by people under particular circumstances.  If some town half way around the world is having trouble with some disease that they contracted from the uncooked monkey they eat, you probably don't have it.<br>  <br>  Why worry that you will be sick today?<br>  Do you feel ill??<br>  Life is hard enough without living in fear of getting sick.<br>  Besides, what is to worry about?  If you get sick, you get sick.  You'll get over it.  Most diseases, with today's medicine, aren't deadly.|`|I8MUpN04aa	if this is a condition that you cant seem to control, maybe it would be helpful to talk to a therapist about it. they have medications to deal with the compulsive behaviours, and maybe they can help you with the hypochondria as well.
1pxKM9Buaa	1st - You said you were scared of dying, and theres a little voice that tells you not to etc... I think thats great. That shows that you deep down inside, dont really want to die, not right now atleast. Let that voice win!!<br>  2nd - If you want to talk I'll be more than happy to listen to ANYthing you have to or want to say.<br>  <br>  Since you dont want to get help in person (although I really do think it would be helpful if you did, it would help you feel much better- think about it, in time??), it might be hard to get treated with meds, just in case you need to take an antidepressent. Like i said before, you can talk to me [really (: ] in place of a therapist, but medicine might be something to look into. I think that's all I have..<br>  <br>  I really  hope this helps.|`|AA11626362	You have to go get help hun. Meds and therapy will help.|`|sy4HR96eaa	email me if you want to talk or whatever..<br>  <br>  thisclockiswrongtoday@yahoo.com|`|VtJ5kRgIaa	email me if you wanna talk, i'm a good listener|`|o5piRiBsaa	Have you ever received counseling after your abuse?  Depression can distort the way you perceive reality and make things look so much worse than they are... I was friends with a clinically depressed person, and he was forever terribly unhappy, no matter the situation.  Medication didn't work for him, but it could for you.  I know you think that you can't get help, that it's too hard, but isn't it worth it if it means saving your life?  I'm sure if you told someone that you are considering killing yourself and that you need help, they would listen up and take notice, and you would realize that you ARE loved and you ARE needed.  So please, do seek help.  You don't have to feel this way.<br>  Edited to add: I know it would be incredibly hard to tell your parents, but TRUST ME, they would so much rather know the truth than to hear a comfortable lie.  They love you so much more than you could ever know -- I'm a parent, so I know it's true.  They would be crushed if you were to take your own life.  It takes a lot of courage to be honest with them about your depression... write a letter if you have to, an email, do it over the phone.  Any way to get the truth out.  Your life will be so much better.|`|vxJ8Jw2jaa	well just think it through carefully. no one should die because of being depressed. life isnt about friends and popularity its about having fun and enjoying it!!! move to a new school and then try to make friends. I was scared like that too. when u go to school try talking to someone ask them for help on hw or something and then actually start talking to them. there are a lot of people at my school that i worry about cause i don't think they have friends. but they don't talk much so they don't have that opportunity. its ok if you don't want to tell anyone just keep it to yourself and when you go to school walk around with a smile on your face and think about all the good things in life. Don't worry just think for a while and try to figure everything out. live life to the fullest!!!<br>  Hope this helps! (:|`|Uukf6Xhhaa	go to a counselor and a doctor, they will help you. you are seriously depressed. depression is an illness, it CAN be treated. you WILL be ok. ill definitley keep you in my prayers. feel better. :)

It is when the individual no longer fears the thought of having a panic attack. <br>  <br>  This may seem like a simplified and obvious observation but give it careful consideration. The one thing that has you searching for a solution to anxiety and panic attacks this very moment is the fear of having another one.<br>  <br>  The first time a person experiences a panic attack it can feel like their world is falling down around them.

ghXH7JZRaa	There aren't any pills or anything that can make you last longer during sex. Most of that is mental. There is something you can do physically, and that is exercise what is known as you PC muscle. These are simple exercises that you can do several times throughout the day in order to help you last longer, control your orgasms and ejaculation and overall enhance your sex life.

This is a myth. At 16, you shouldn't need pills. At 18, a man can get it up again and again. The best thing you can do is to take longer with yourself. Or in other words, train yourself to last longer. So often, its like a chore and you get it done fast. This carries over with the real thing. <br>  <br>  Also, I agree with the other poster: You're 16. You're going to end up being a teenage father. One slip and your life is ruined. Be careful!|`|Rsr8nngWaa	Calm down, don't think about it that much, and slow down.

If it keeps coming back see your doc or nurse|`|pR2gXzYeaa	It's most likely a boil. Although these are painful, they aren't usually dangerous and they are not caused by a sexually transmitted disease. It may be caused by an ingrown hair or a sweat gland that has become infected. Heat application is probably the best treatment. So take a hot bath or use a hot pack. This will increase blood flow to the area and help your body fight the infection. You may need to see a doctor if the problem gets to be too troublesome. To prevent boils in the future use antibacterial soap to clean the area and try to keep the area free from sweat. Doctors can also prescribe other treatments that might help.
yMqoXvdoaa	When a girl has been raped and has become pregnant through that- especially if they are under age.

f89f116400d4ff9b53b246c33e1753cdaa	Have you been to your GP for your depression?    If you have then he will have (probably) prescribed something for you to take...Dosolupine or Ametryptiline (or similar) - both of these are relaxants and should help you sleep.    BUT, the one thing with depression is the fact that it is not predictable - the effects you are suffering are all part of it - you may need to go back to the Doc's and change your medication to a slightly different dose.    All of what you have said are symptoms of depression - the jogging only helps on one point - it gets you out in the fresh air but will not always make you tired enough to sleep better.    A lot of the things you suffer from are sub concious and the things you think about keep going around and around in your head - thus not being able to sleep...your brain is to active, even when you don't want it to be.    Go back to your doctor and talk to him about it - he can then decide the best course to take    If you need to talk you can IM me - am online now - been there and done that with depression - can point you in the right direction|`|gCdP3NJGaa	Have you tried  relaxation or meditation cd when you are in bed? Some of them are 'guided' that is someone speaks on it, helping you to control your breathing, which muscle groups to relax, that kind of thing to shut the thinking side of the brain down so you can sleep. A white noise box could do the same|`|2ccc737caef357c3260c36ef333caaa5aa	Okay... first of all, do NOT jog or work out for at least 4 hours before going to bed.  What happens is it "revs" up your system and this is not conducive to sleep.  Let me commend you for not doing as millions of people do and that is buying an over the counter sleep aid.  Now here is what I recommend to anyone who has sleep difficulties.  It isn't easy at first, but in time, I assure you it does work.    First of all, you need to get into a routine so start by picking a time to go to bed each night and stick to it. Get as comfortable as possible and make sure the room is as dark as possible and free from noise. If you don't fall asleep within say, 20 minutes, get up, leave the room and go read or watch TV for awhile until you feel sleepy again. Then go back to bed and keep repeating this routine until you finally go to sleep. If you don't sleep at all that night or only for a few hours, maintain your routine anyway and do NOT take a nap the next day. Sooner or later your body will crave the sleep it needs and you will fall asleep. ROUTINE is the important thing here, and training your body to become accustomed to the bed as being where it goes to sleep at.  Once your body gets used to this routine you won't have a problem falling asleep. It's tough at first, but it is well worth it once you establish it.    Make sure to "wind down" a good few hours before your bed time and try to stop eating at least two (preferably four) hours before bed time. Make sure your bed is comfortable, and the bedroom is as quiet and dark as possible.  Stick with this, and your problem will be solved!|`|0eu05OOxaa	Well i have this exact problem. It is horrible it starts to take over your life. But the fact that it maybe on your mind all the time, IE thinking how will i sleep tonight and doing things continuously thro out the day to help you sleep at night is a sign you are thinking about it way too much. Which will deffo make it worse. Try not to think about it (hard i know) Ive had it for 2 years now. "Read up on insomnia" I have drugs from the doctor (tamazepam) But they make me tired day after. I also took to drinking a bottle of wine a night. I still woke every few hours. Lol. I then started taking nytol. Which is actually really good but a short term solution. Stop thinking about it. Get up early. (earlier then normal) Go to bed later, Get a relaxation tape? Have some lavender on your pillow. But don't let it consume your thoughts. I am a compulsive thinker therefore my mind races while i'm in bed. So.. I recently bought a book from amazon. Called the power of now. Its about enlightenment i'm not into this. But there's some good ways to relax in here all to do with breathing. But insomnia is caused by lot's of things. So read up on it. And if it continues see your doctor. Hope you sleep soon-x|`|UNFxjNHkaa	I heard cleaning helps people fall asleep..  Next time you cant sleep, get up and start cleaning your room...see if it works!|`|q0nhx3veaa	It could be depression.

lbbKiTxfaa	Oh gosh I used to be like that but my periods lasted 7 - 9 days.<br>  <br>  I live with just my Dad and started my periods when only he looked after me too, was abit embaressing.<br>  <br>  I used feminax, and that really helped (its paracetemol based stuff for period pains) Eating bannanas can help (No idea why) rubbing your tummy helps, hot water bottles help, hot baths.<br>  <br>  I started the pill, Which has almost stopped the pain, and really lightened my periods (im currently lying on a hot water bottle, but theyre alot easier going) They also help with PMS<br>  <br>  My parents were okay with me going on the contreceptive pill, but ofc some parents wont allow it, so there are pills that control your period wihtout giving you contraceptives. You take one everyday and follow the packet, then theres a week of different ones, and they cause a period =]<br>  <br>  You can ask your Dad to go to the doctors about it, and shoo him out when you have your appointment, and the doctor will decide whats best, they can also prescribe better painkillers.<br>  <br>  When I need tampons i write a note on the board or leave one on the fridge before he goes shopping. No embaressing conversations... it may be a good idea to write what ones you use so he cant ask questions...<br>  <br>  Indie|`|AA11916244	Just ask him for the money and tell him you have feminine problems. Trust me, you mention anything like that to a guy they'll just fork over the money no questions asked. As far a what type of product to use...for pads i would get Always they always seemed to hold up the best. If your periods are heavy i would get the ones with wings and possibly get the overnites. If you use tampons i found that Kotex is the best with heavy periods.<br>  And if your periods and pms are that bad, i would look into getting birth control to even things out. Im not promoting sex here but its the only way to get you to have a lighter period, less cramps and less PMS. Is your mom around? If she is express  your concerns and ask for advice. Or find another adult female you trust. Hope you feel better soon.|`|9WciH0GXaa	sweetie im totally the same as u im shy lol but u just need to take a deep breath and ask ur dad if not what i do is ask my dad for $20 and cycle up to the corner store and buy sum<br>  if he asks why just say feminine issues ;)<br>  sorry dont no about the cramps i dont get them bad
yDJiiqcsaa	No, it doesn't mean you deserved it or desired it or encouraged it.  It means that a person's experiences contribute to how they feel about things/activities.  The first time a kid sees sex (parents or a video) it affects his/her thinking.  It matters at what stage of development the kid is in when it is seen.  The first time you are touched affects your thinking. And HERE is a difficult concept to understand, accept and incorporate into your understanding of your sexuality.  Physical actions during sex feel GOOD - whether you are voluntarily involved or being raped/molested.   There is there false idea that if a person is TRULY being raped/molested that he/she would HATE every moment of it - but your body doesn't know "right/wrong" it just knows pleasure or pain . Your brain knows "right/wrong". And so some memories conflict (hating/liking it).  So some of the physical things that happened may have felt good.  Also if he was an older, experienced man - he would better know how to make you feel good.  Also, there is this phenomenon that if you are being raped - then the domination/control he exercised over you can in some way free you from guilt.  It may have been 98% terrible but that 2% of "feel good" can have him stuck in the back of your mind as that "forbidden/terrible/scary/exciting? thing".   There are many motivations why you may consider being with him again. You would be an adult now and could dominate or exact revenge/power over him. If you have wounded feelings for your mother you would be taking revenge on her or "showing her up". There are all kinds of sick/pathological reasons to consider "doing him" but there are no healthy/reasonable reasons for it. His violation of you didn't end with violating your body - his actions put sort of a "kink" in your sexuality/mind and now you have to learn to work around it.  If you slept with him now - it would be like absolving him and affirming in his mind that "see, she did want me".   Unless you are setting up to do an "Elena Bobbit style" amputation - and he isn't worth you spending time in prison over.|`|91f956efb63a51bcca06586fcc2fe99aaa	i would get counseling and no you did not deserve it!|`|64oOqELCaa	that sucks tell you mom now!!!!!!!!!

MTF0Rz90aa	Sounds like you may have had a panic related metal episode.<br>  Sometimes when a person is under a lot of stress there brains cannot process the stresses and you can get either depression or panic attacks. Both are caused by an imbalance in the brains chemicals, the good news is that some times when the stress levels return to normal the imbalance sorts its self out.<br>  It sounds like what ever caused your problems has passed and you ar back to normal, so medication will not work a you don't need it.<br>  Just for future reference the type of medication commonly given to people with depression or panic attacks is not "Strong Medication" and in most cases in not clinically required is peed out.<br>  If you start to have the same feelings again get down to you local GP sooner than later. <br>  Ja.|`|BliviQvVaa	It sounds like you had the beginning of OCD (obsessive Compulsive Disorder) and Hypochondria (the over anylising of mild medical afflictions and making them into something more serious). Mentally strong? Just a phase that was dealt with because you probably realised this behaviour was not normal. So not strong, just sounds like you have got at least half a brain. Well done for sorting it out you self however!!!|`|SDvWtJRRaa	I think when your growing up several unusual things happen in your mind, thoughts that pop in and out and make no sense, been their done that, but as you grow older your body and mind settle down and all becomes clearer, I think the mind grows faster than the body so you'll get these weird feelings and thoughts but pay no mind to them, they go away with age and wisdom, we grow too soon old and too late smart. That's life, go with it and have a happy one.|`|cSxTtqr6aa	you probably have osd (obsessive compulsive disorder) its kinda a mental illness but its nothing serious everyone has part of it you just have more its nothing to be afraid or scared of :)|`|VtJ5kRgIaa	sounds like ocd. but apparently youve overcome it. if it starts happening again though i would see a doctor because it can get pretty bad (for example counting your footsteps which im sure you dont want to be doing)|`|AA11626362	No you're not "strong mentally"  there is no such thing. It doesn't sound like anything big or important its just a game you played in your head, by your own willingness.|`|5On7k8cHaa	It sounds like the reason you thought you were going to die and had all the diseases going was because you were suffering from health anxiety, otherwise known as hypochondria. By trying to get to bed before the adverts finished you were trying to calm the anxiety. So thinking you were going to die was the obsessive part of perhaps obsessive compulsive disorder, and playing the game of getting to bed by a certain point was was the compulsion in order to try and elevate the obsession. <br>  <br>  Both OCD and health anxiety are classed as mental illness, you probably recovered by finding something else in your life to focus on, either consciously or sub-consciously.|`|EJQRIffaaa	no not mentally ill<br>  <br>  sounds to me like you have a strong imagination which is a good thing, when you where playing these games where you doing it out of boredom,<br>  <br>  if your feelin fine at the minute stay with it try and not dwell on the past to much<br>  <br>  i dont know if your strong menatlly or not, but id say you have the ability 2 be very creative|`|wXU6bMNHaa	It just means that you were going through a period of being hyper-focused on that particular thing.  Years ago I used to do this sort of thing but it had to do with being in bed by 11:11 pm and seeing that time before I could go to sleep.  It lasted for a few years and then stopped.  And I am completely a normal fully functioning person.  It was when I was a teen but when I hit my 20's - all that hyper-focusing went away.|`|F8KZIBEUaa	i think u had obsessive compulsive disorder which means you kind of get upsessed with things. everyone had it, you just probably got a dose of it. nothing to be scared of, everyone gets it:-) hope this helps you
9pLdhuBnaa	It can be possible to have hotflashes at the age of 21 if someone is having issues with their ovaries like with premature ovarian failure (an example only).<br>  <br>  Hotflashes are when the body feels warm all the time.  Sometimes it can cause a person to feel pretty hot (learned this from friends who have had it happen to them).<br>  <br>  The only way to know for sure what is going on is to see your doctor for further evaluation of the situation to see what they say.

qkblT2hgaa	You can lose this extra fat but it sounds like you are pretty slim as it is. Crunches and leg lifts are great but your body will get use to doing them. Try doing crunches while moving your legs like you are riding a bike. Try raising your right elbow to touch your left knee while doing crunches and then change to the other elbow and knee.<br>  <br>  This is hard but yields great results in a flatter stomach:<br>  Do this on a hardwood floor.<br>  Get two blankets. Fold both in half or more for comfort. Kneel on one.<br>  Take the other blanket in your hands and lean forward on your knees until the other blanket touches the floor (like you are scrubbing the floor). Slowly slide your hands forward on the floor until most of your weight is on your hands. Go forward slowly until you start to feel your stomach tighten up. Slowly use your stomach muscles to pull ypu back to the start position. Repeat this same exercise until you can almost lay flat on your stomach and still be able to pull yourself back up to the start position.<br>  <br>  Check out www.menshealth.com for great ab exercises. Good luck|`|HSUfe3m7aa	Steriod inhalers can cause weight gain.<br>  <br>  Crunches won't help you lose fat, only cardio can do that by using your body's stored energy. Also building muscle burns more calories.<br>  <br>  You do need a bit of fat and you are on the small side, keep your calories up enough, do some cardio and your crunches but the only way to lose fat is to burn it. At your weight I can't imagine you have much fat :)<br>  <br>  Good luck
eeGn51Oiaa	Did you gain weight during the four months? Did you do any sort of training during the four months? <br>  <br>  You ran a lot and you are still young. It is hard for me to believe that 15-20 minutes would hurt you like this. But, it has to be over training. How fast were you running? If you ran 3.5 miles during the 20 minutes than maybe you need to jog to rebuild your base. Either you are going to fast--you think you are still in prime condition--and your not. Or, you need to start with 10 minutes/a mile-1.5 miles for a few weeks. I really guessing that you need to slow down. Maybe slow down and jog like 2 miles at talking pace for like month--do it 6 days a week. Then start to add to it. You can't really get into shape to run a pr in a month. Your time next month should seem turtle like compared to your glory days or running. You were running thousands of miles a year back then, and now you haven't run for almost a half of a year. This is a big difference. Once you mentally accept this fact, your legs will be fine.
1VIwo0rNaa	Quite a few prescription medicines you are on but your doctor would have made sure they are at the right levels and can be taken together.

4HQxLXQCaa	First, ignore anyone telling you to do leg exercises.  Your problem is fat, not muscle.  That said, read this:<br>  <a href="http://www.exrx.net/WeightTraining/Myths.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.exrx.net/WeightTraining/Myths...</a><br>  <br>  You can only get rid of fat as a whole, you can't choose a nice place to lose it.<br>  <br>  To lose fat:<br>  1. DON’T BELIEVE THOSE FAD DIETS!  DIET PILLS ARE GIMMICKS! Yes, Acai berries/pills/juice is a fad diet.<br>  2. DO NOT STARVE YOURSELF!  Unless you are tiny as it is, a 1,200 calorie a day diet is DANGEROUS and won't work in the long run.<br>  3. Find the ammount of calories you need to eat per day to maintain your weight.  Tyr this link: <a href="http://www.exrx.net/Calculators/CalRequire.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.exrx.net/Calculators/CalRequi...</a><br>  4. Eat healthy and eat about 500 calories below that number.  Eating too little will result in loss of water weight and muscle mass, not fat (what you actually want to lose).<br>  5. Eat 5-6 small meals a day.  This keeps your metabolism up.  Each meal should include fruits, veggies, water, and protein.  Oatmeal is great for breakfast.<br>  5. Drink at least 64oz (8 8oz glasses) of water a day.  No soda (that includes diet soda).<br>  6. Do light/moderate cardio 3 to 5 times a week for 30 to 45 minutes each time.  Running, bicycling, and swimming are great for this.  If you are obese, do low impact stuff like walking or swimming.<br>  7. Do some strength training to make sure you lose fat and not muscle.  Don't worry; you won't look like the hulk if you lift weights.<br>  8. You should lose about 1-2lbs (.45-.9kg) per week.  If you lose more than that, chances are the rest is stool, water weight, or even muscle mass.<br>  Be patient and be smart.  If you follow this guideline you will be very happy with your results.  Good luck!|`|BvE0qcgmaa	Less dairy products.. drink alot of water.. but not obsessivley .. the min. ammount of water you should drink a day is 7-8 glasses. I kno it seems like alot for me too.

But I've had my period since fourth grade, always very regular, then two years ago I started skipping months at a time and suddenly had a period for three weeks. Now I'm completely regular again. Sometimes your body gets its own ideas.<br>  <br>  If your cycles are drastically irregular each time, you may have polycystic ovarian syndrome or some other hormonal disorder. It's worth talking to you gynecologist about, in case you need to be put on oral contraceptives for regulation.|`|t2W9GGjdaa	not really.. pls go to a obgyn|`|9WciH0GXaa	no....ur periods meant to be roughly every 28 days|`|3hETupPOaa	yeah your period is irregular during the first couple of years

I don't know why. But I do have a suggestion- gloves. Not the big ones, they're bulky and it's hard to do anything. But there are thinner ones that let me type at the computer while keeping my fingers toasty. :)|`|we2Csi51aa	do you smoke?<br>  if so than that is why. <br>  smoking reduces bloodflow in veins and arteries causing your blood temperature to go down and not recover from coldness for long amounts of time.<br>  if you dont smoke than idk|`|F3KkB4GWaa	I think it means you have poor circulation. Or you're anemic.|`|SogS1WzYaa	poor circulation in your hands probably- plus the less flesh the more likely theyll be colder b/c they cant insulate as well as somewhere like your abdomen.|`|20cb28b8c99babf9aaeb1419e15164f4aa	I don't know man...

802adca38e5251bbfdbb0289ba94d432aa	The other answers are correct. Life span of a person with untreated, active tuberculosis is quite variable. It would depend on age of the patient, overall health status, underlying diseases, nutritional status, etc.. Every person is different. Some strains of tuberculosis, such as drug-resistant, can be much more aggressive. Extra-pulmonary infection is a major negative factor. The initial level of infection definitely helps determine lifespan. A rapid onset of severe symptoms would suggest greatly limited lifespan. Minimal to mild initial infection would suggest a longer time. But, the infection can accelerate and intensify at any time|`|4BBjhHAnaa	It really depends on the strain of TB.<br>  But, whatever it is, it is highly irresponsible and even illegal to go untreated once you have been diagnosed with TB.  Remember the case with that guy with a highly drug-resistant strain who got on a plane last year?  Yeah, that's how it gets spread and kills people.<br>  <br>  Are you just curious or do you or someone you know have TB?<br>  Anyone who isn't treated is just as bad as someone who knows they have HIV and has unprotected sex.|`|I8MUpN04aa	they need to be treated, and in some cases, they are isolated so they don't infect others. tuberculosis is a very contagious disease, and has caused many deaths- they need to be taken care of.|`|0aBlpLvsaa	The answer is: this person should be under treatment. Tuberculosis is a infectious disease so this person is responsible if other people get<br>  infected.

3908da29f0769fb75937d8093758a4f4aa	You can't.  You could fake it but that would be a real mistake.  You're trying on different identities, which, based on how you're describing it here, is probably a way to avoid something about being yourself.<br>  The challenge will be to face yourself and deal with whatever it is that is unsatisfying within you. You could benefit from counseling, as well as from self-exploration through journaling, writing, meditation, and yoga.<br>  Just so you know, multiple personality disorder is now called dissociative identity disorder and is almost always caused by severe abuse in early childhood.  It's not fun and takes years to heal. Don't wish that kind of anguish on yourself.|`|b8f51eff5dbe2bc310be76585193bb07aa	People who have multiple personality disorder generally don't know they have it. The other personalities are created as they tend to deal with what issues the owner of the disorder can't deal with. <br>  To be honest I think you are just creating the idea of two personalities just to try and Individualize yourself and make yourself separate of the crowd.|`|AA11626362	lol because you want to develop it you wont get it, this is a serious disease with people that have it so dont make fun of them by trying to create it....but because you're thinking that you probably have histronic personality...needs attention on them constantly!! SEE A THERAPIST|`|ETcBRko3aa	Please.  People that have this disorder have had horrible childhoods and experienced severe abuse and neglect.  It is extremely painful when they actually begin to recognize they have it.<br>  <br>  The "personalities" in REAL DID patients are dissociated off ~ which means the mind splits off a part, so that the person could deal with the abuse they were suffering when they were young, most likely younger than 6 years old.  <br>  <br>  Get a life and do something to help people with your spare energy and "creativity" ~ like work at a soup kitchen.

I started at about 14 and it worked and i had perfect skin for about 7 yrs. It has many difficult and dangerous side effects. You will be required to get monthly blood tests, psychological exams and most likely take birth control. My friend got diabetes from it and ppl have killed themselves frm acutane induced depression. BUT it works wonders. Your doctor will be able to tell you if you qualify to take and if he thinks you should. <br>  <br>  Also try Aveeno clear complexion face wash and clearasil pore cleansing pads. Both really help.

You may be washing your face too much or too much over the counter stuff,hence the redness go see a dermatogist they are the experts.|`|GFYkV8a0aa	I suffered from bad acne when I was a teen as well. It's really hard to get rid of, when you're that age.

At your age it's completely normal and sometimes there's nothing you can do about just because not everythiing out there works and not everyone is the same but for me I use Proactive. It works extremely well. Gets rid of redness and in the morning there's a significant difference! Again, everyone's different..good luck with it.|`|JN58HuZYaa	popping your pimples can cause a lot of redness if you do that. Also depending on the wash and medication you put on your face could cause irritation
cilYUWgtaa	No, cloning would only copy your genes but not your being. You could clone yourself a thousand times, and eventually all of those clones would die of old age (or being hit by a bus, etc)..|`|13k2WKx8aa	It wouldn't. You cant replicate thoughts and experience.<br>  <br>  At least you'd have extra parts lying around?|`|xZBwnrGzaa	Human cloning would not affect the age process unless some sort of mind transfer would be invented. If that did happen, then you could switch your mind to a youthful body. However, that would require the "clone" to be born when you are still youthful so it can age properly. And then we would have to go through the ethics of the whole thing.
7MD91XXDaa	I wanted to share that using the herb Butcher’s Broom is an absolutely wonderful cure for varicose veins!  I have been taking a supplement for 3 weeks and my legs are 100% pain free!  The ugly varicose/spider veins are also starting to disappear!  I was in tremendous pain with these veins in my right leg during my 6th pregnancy and having a very difficult time walking or standing.  With 3 months left to go (& 5 small kids to chase) I figured I better find some way to get through a little more comfortably.  I ran across this herb and with my doctor’s approval have been taking it with GREAT success!  I noticed improvement in my pain on the first day!|`|9OsjUed2aa	There is a product called OPCs which are grape seed extract and pine bark extract that were isolated in France by Dr. Jack Masquelier.  In the book "Miracle Cures" by renowned health researcher and author Jean Carter, the research by Dr. Masquelier in the successful treatment of varicose veins is discussed.<br>  <br>  OPCs are powerful antioxidants that strengthen blood vessel walls.

cKSbZBt8aa	You are doing it!  Eat more vegetables for fibre to fight fat tissue. You could add more protein (another egg, fish, chicken) to your diet for metabolism and muscle health.    All in all its a good routine.  Stick at it.  If you are up for it, add an extra mile once or twice a week, but only if you can, don't over train.|`|rno44kAUaa	well you should get there soon with all that exersize. id recomend replacing the beef with chicken (lunch) because chicken has around 20 gram of fat less (200 calories) and more protein|`|itl0jwvIaa	Yes.

Do somwthing different each day
cKSbZBt8aa	Protein foods are mainly meat, fish, chicken, nuts, beans, eggs.  You need to decrease the protein intake.  So less of the above.  More vegetables would be appropriate and half the protein source, i.e. if you have a piece of meat, cut it in half and only have half. Unless the doctor has given you a specific amount of protein to consume.|`|Hrky2Tigaa	i think this is what you are looking for|`|C7CueNxbaa	I don't really know what prostate really means but i do know that if you eat less protein, your body will give out this type of cell to increase muscle tissue which means you will have bigger muscles.
ebcfaff0504724aa2ad756522576c3b2aa	I tore one (rather it popped loose from the bone under my patella) when I was 11and got hit by a car when I was crossing the street. Incidentally, when you are young, your connective tissue is stronger than when you are older, which makes it is less likely to tear, but a serious blow made it actually pull out a fragment of bone and "come undone". I was in a full leg cast, couldn't bend my knee and it took about six months and physical therapy daily to be able to regain full use of my leg. I didn't even attempt to walk--I just laid on the street until the paramedics came (lucky for me it happened right in front  of a hospital emergency room.) Pretty serious injury--you wouldn't be able to walk. Very painful. Also an injury serious enough to make you tear a ligament would probably render you in so much pain you wouldn't even attempt to walk. Remember that your ligaments are really the ends of your muscles, attached to bone, so snapping one seriously compromises your physiology and ability to walk and balance. I don't know that you'd be paralyzed; you could still contract your muscles but they wouldn't lift the body part that you wanted them to. <br>  <br>  Good luck!

xmmX3JTRaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  It all depends on our body built. Men have bigger bones therefore they should weight more. Also, men have more muscles which are heavier than fat, so they also are "allowed" to weight more.|`|t81MEJ82aa	Percentage wise, women's bodies have more fat. But men are bigger than women on average and have more muscle mass. Muscle is much heavier than that.|`|WS9TooJKaa	BMI is the same for men and women.

TdIbrGYYaa	Hey Danny- What's wrong with just being you?  None of us are perfect.  You could try using fresh cucumber slices with vitamin E oil.  Both are safe to use.  But if there is one thing I have learned in my 34 years is - you will never be exactly what you want it to be you will find imperfections so it's best just to accept yourself and who you are and not worry so much about what other people will think.  I fell in love with my husband of 14 years because of the person inside.  My first glance of him was quite the contrary to what I would have normally "gone for" he's a bit short and husky and it was his speech and the way he looked at me that made me complete.

I think that it is perfectly okay if you decide not to do something about it, but it is also perfectly okay to let the administration know about this guys problem.  Who knows? You might be saving his life in the long run?  You don't have to reveal your identity and can leave an anonymous tip. Maybe the best thing to do is leave an anonymous tip and not reveal this guys identity either.  The administration could have drug sniffing dogs visit the school and figure out who this guy is on their own.|`|TrHXtOdYaa	Turn him in. Tell the office (or wherever you turn him in) you would like to remain anonymous. It is very dangerous to have someone smoking in a school. Just think one day you may have kids, Would you want them to be in a school where people smoke in the bathroom. It is dangerous for you, the guy, and the other people in school. Do not be worried in the least bit.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|33E71Ka3aa	Well you should use your own discernment to take action. I certainly would not want you to endanger yourself by telling. But someone should know what is going on. Tell your parents so they can inform the school. This may be a better step.
wwP3ONCFaa	Suck on Lozenges. If your sore throat is caused by a viral infection, antibiotics wont help it. But medicated lozenges containing phenol may do some good. The phenol can kill surface germs, thereby keeping the invaders in check until your body has a chance to build up its resistance. And its mild anesthetic action numbs raw nerve endings so your throat doesnt feel as scratchy. These lozenges come in various strengths, so follow package directions.<br>  <br>  Load up on Garlic. Garlic is one of the best natural antibiotics and antiseptics. I recommend you taking garlic oil capsules (15 grains) six times a day. But if it causes you any adverse reaction, try another remedy.<br>  <br>  Reach for Vitamin C. Vit. C may help build up your tissues to fight the germs that are making your throat sore.<br>  <br>  GARGLE. If it hurts when you swallow, the sore area may be high enough in your throat for gargling to bathe and soothe it. So gargle frequently with one of the solutions below. But be aware that if your hoarse or have a cough, the sore spot is further down, and gargling wont help|`|6lmFyr2maa	i suffer from persistent tonsilitis but cannot have them remove for medical reasons.<br>  <br>  what helps me is to gargle one dispersable aspirin in a mouthful of water three times a day. don't swallow the aspirin though because it can irritate the stomach so its best not to swallow if its not necassary. this helps kill the bacteria in the throat thats making it sore.<br>  <br>  also drink organe juice to help boost your immune system so it can fight the illness.(any foods high in antioxidants like lemons or blackberries are good for you too).<br>  <br>  and remember to drink at least 8 glasses of WATER a day to flush out toxins from your body.<br>  <br>  and finally get good amounts of sleep ideally 7-8 hours a day as rest really helps your body fight illness.<br>  <br>  xxx|`|0YmH0Zfkaa	SLEEP, sleep is one of the most important things when you are sick. It enables your body to ready its defenses and fight back. I would also take a vitamin C supplement or drink lots of orange juice|`|xbzCxo8yaa	There is this new product by the name of Sucrets ICE, i't an oral anesthetic.

dUjKT7LFaa	I'll take you to the docter and take care of you.<br>  don't worry.<br>  i love you
BvE0qcgmaa	Your lymph nodes seem to be swollen so there will be pain. But that is because of an infection of some sort. (strep throat ect.) I would drink alot of orange juice it may sting your throat but it will help.. lot of vitamin c tablets would be recommended. and vitamin B. hope this helps. Chamomile tea never hurt either.|`|I8MUpN04aa	are you sure its not tonsillitis?  did you take all the pills that the doctor gave you?  i think you need to see the doctor again and find out what is going on. there isn't a chance that you had unprotected oral sex, is there? if that is the case, tell the doctor about that too. if everything is fine, then you just have a virus and there is nothing that can be done to cure that, it just has to run its course. gargling with warm salt water will help to ease the pain. and maybe suck on a lozenge or a candy to keep the throat area moist.
D19F6m92aa	You could give the cat a bath just before you leave.  But the cat would be much happier staying home alone for a week, than take a bath.  You can leave the cat with plenty of food and water.  Have some one drop by every few days, so the cat does not get too lonely.  Other than a very nasty litter box, we have left our cats alone for up to a week.<br>  Your sister in law can go to her doctor and get some medicine too, over the counter does not cut it.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	no problem -hire a pet nanny and leave the cats in their own home.|`|K5IOSGXAaa	No, I am allergice to cats too and nothing helps.

OUbNSXjJaa	Take him to a good psychiatrist. Consult. Render all possible human help. Modern age children are getting such things from bad company of friends. Best is also to pray simultaneously. On practical side, you have to take him to the doctor.|`|gkqmrIAGaa	Your son has to have outside help professional help specifically for Autistic children. He has reached an age where it is extremely hard to take care of him without skills that you can get from a professional. He may be cutting himself when he is upset or angry. This is extremely dangerous as he can easily cut himself in the wrong place and you may not be there to help him. You can't handle this situation by yourself. Please get help for him and for yourself. I am so sorry that you are going through this and can imagine how upsetting and scary it is for you and him.|`|1pxKM9Buaa	Maybe you could take him to a therapist and you could all talk and see whats bothering him.<br>  <br>  If he is cutting, try and get him to talk with you FIRST instead of just bringing in therapy, that probably wont make him very happy, or allow him to open up as much.<br>   (oooo i just saw how you said he didnt reply back but im thinking to still talk with him tell him you care and want to help him and just assure him of your love and maybe he will start to talk.) dont yell at him, because that will just scare him. be gentle, and im sure you dont yell at him but im just saying... <br>  <br>  calm him down by maybe offering to do his favorite activities with him, a movie night, bowling, skating, games etc...<br>  <br>  hopefully, this is helpful...|`|lOXqBBOwaa	Ok, I'm sorry for your son, but take everything out of his room that you may think he will use to cut on himself. Let him know that everything is ok and he doesn't need to cut; I use to cut and it became an addiction. He needs professional help in his case because he's autistic.|`|LsHkgexvaa	I don't know what prompts people like showin m but they should be locked up..  <br>  Your child has impulse control as a  result of his autism. Speak with ahis doctor asap and develop a treatment plan. Best of luck...|`|cDqLCZyzaa	you should put him up for adoption. he seems like trouble,|`|E9s5zJ2xaa	explain to him that what he is doing is bad. if you think he doesn't know that this is bad, then ask him what he is doing. you might not get a clear answer, but any answer could help.|`|7e93af17f42d666c2908eb9cb997f573aa	Talk to your mental health professional, fast!

4bZou8qQaa	I have never tried it, but I have heard that putting Visine eye drops on your acne will reduce the redness. Also, I know Clearasil makes a tinted acne cream (I'm sure there are others too.). The tinted acne cream wouldn't technically be makeup - - it's medicine.|`|nQZEJz5yaa	Accutane works REALLY well! my friend used it. its like these pills that u have to take everyday for like 30 days or something and now it looks like she never had acne!!! of course u will get some but not a lot|`|fv2GAAdPaa	Try useing Acne treatments to make sure you get a good one for your face you should see a dermatologist to get one [rescribed and it should help you...<br>  <br>  =]|`|AA10358331	Well if you don't want to wear make up, then there's no other way to "hide" it. You can see your doctor or a dermatologist to give you a prescription for acne medicine.  <br>  <br>  If you change your mind about makeup..<br>  You can pick up a green stick. Its like cover up, but its green. The green covers up the red of the pimples. Then cover the green with cover up that matches your skin tone.|`|I8MUpN04aa	see your doctor and ask for a prescription for the acne- there are many out there, and the prescription stuff works better than anything you can buy over the counter. Accutaine is one of them- works well.
W0hNoMSsaa	Yes, it can. A psychiatrist told me that Prozac was first used as a weight loss drug. Then they discovered it also relieves the symptoms of depression.<br>  <br>  Don't believe anyone who says "You shouldn't take Prozac." It is a very effective drug at the right dosage. Most of the problems you've heard about happened because the original recommended dosage was too high.|`|zOU5fNHWaa	wieght loss is only achived one way.

There are lots of temptations in the real world don't you think?! The one diet which definitely showed results for me is wu-yi tea, it can be viewed in the resource box below, they have a small number of free trials in stock, it has been featured in Reader's Digest and CNN. I melted away twenty five pounds, it definitely does produce results!|`|WPnMXP8paa	It doesn't matter, you shouldn't take prozac anyway.|`|ixOE0onnaa	yes.|`|X605sT7oaa	Yeah, it has some side effects though - google it, there is loads of info.<br>  <br>  :)

Some medical research has indicated that it may be useful in certain conditions, but the substance used has been processed so that it does not work in the same way as "street" cannabis. However, many HIV and cancer sufferers use it to enhance their appetite and people with MS have said that it has greatly relieved their symptoms. But in the UK, it is still illegal to possess cannabis, regardless of any medical condition.|`|9cba094486c6e7ab49a59ac5ea44682faa	None at all.

ETcBRko3aa	The guy above is WRONG.<br>  <br>  Seroquel DOES cause weight gain.   In fact, the makers of Seroquel were involved in a class action lawsuit because so many people gained weight and got Type 2 diabetes.  Look it up.<br>  <br>  Two antipsychotics are considered "weight-neutral":  Abilify and Geodon.  You could try those.  Many people are using Abilify with successful results.|`|LsHkgexvaa	Serequil does not cause weight gain. I've been taking it for 5 years. It's the most effective anxiety medication I've ever been on, and it helps me sleep. Don't be paranoid.|`|6TVAut8naa	Any medication is a heavy duty for your body.<br>  <br>  Our body`s function best clean and healthy.<br>  <br>  Antidepsychotics are to use best in urgency cases.<br>  But not so well on long term use.<br>  <br>  You seem to be also worried of your psychosis.

9WciH0GXaa	u dont need to make a fixed timing to eat acne on back can be cause by ur hair always on it.

JtPu0KBXaa	Well, you can catch viral gastroenteritis and experience puking and diarrhea for twelve hours. It helped me lose 10-15 pounds in just a couple of days...|`|I54KyS8Laa	Most overweight people are addicted and at the same time allergic to diet soda. In fact diet soda and diet foods actually cause you to gain weight--the opposite of what they lead you to believe. Water is the best drink. If you want flavor use lime, lemon or squeeze an orange. Next liquefy real fruit with or without ice. And for goodness sake, stay away from any kind of carbonated beverages including club soda or seltzer--the carbonation destroys your calcium balance which will reek havoc on your metabolism.

Cardio is really good too...google it!  the informatin is boundless.|`|m1TSG9Cvaa	I would suggest a cleansing diet. I lost 12 pounds in 9 days and then 28 pounds in less than a month. I also lost a lot of inches too!   I learned that cleansing will help the body get rid of toxins.  Toxins come from a lot of things like fast food, pollution, food additives and preservatives and lots of other things.  The toxins get stored in the fat in our body.  To get rid of the fat, we have to get rid of the toxins by cleansing the body.  This made sense to me and I decided to try a cleanse program and it worked.  The weight came off fast and this kept me motivated to keep going, not like other diets where the weight loss it too slow. I did Jenny Craig, Weight Watcher and Medifast.  If you want to learn more call the toll free number 1-877-587-4647 or check out the website.  This was the first time I ever did a cleanse, it was easy and I feel better.

wGTisY1aaa	Muscle soreness <br>  <br>            A certain degree of muscle soreness or pain may be experienced after a workout. Muscle soreness that occurs directly after a workout is known as acute muscle soreness. Acute muscle soreness may last up to hour following exercise and may dissipate soon after. The cause of acute muscle soreness or inflammation may be due to a reduction in blood flow to the muscle and an accumulation of metabolic byproducts like hydrogen ions or lactic acid. Recovery follows when enough oxygen gets to the muscle. Post-exercise muscle soreness (PEMS) or delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) happens when the muscles are sore 12-48 hours after exercise. Some soreness is alright, but excruciating pain is not. If you experience slight discomfort from soreness, you can help alleviate the pain by placing ice on the sore area and stretching while you have the ice pack on. Stretching with the ice pack is on will help relive some of the tightening of the sore muscle the next morning. This is nothing to get freaked out about. Our bodies undergo the processes of inflammation, repair and remodeling in response to the stress imposed by training. This will occur even when you use right form and technique. If you do feel excruciating pain you may need to; call your doctor right away.<br>  <br>  Recuperation tips<br>  <br>  Pre-training<br>   Before we discuss aspirin, I have to stress to allows follow your doctors orders before taking any medications. Aspirin is not something to take all of the time. If you know that you are not supposed to take anything like aspirin then this tip is not for you. Don’t feel like you have to do this, this is only a tip for those who can take aspirin. <br>        Aspirin operates on a variety of levels. It helps to improve blood flow by reducing the body’s output of thromboxane, a natural which causes blood platelets to become stickier. Research has proven that smaller doses of aspirin are as effective as larger doses with less possibility of stomach irritation. To protect your stomach lining even better crush of the aspirin between two spoons and add them to a glass of milk. Aspirin also reduces edema (swelling) after hard training. You should try to only take aspirin on the heavier training days if you can take aspirin. Once again< I cannot stress the importance of following your doctors orders first. I cannot be responsible for you not doing so.<br>        Leg elevation is another way to help the blood flow to our legs. Many people today spend eight or more hours sitting at their desks and their legs become swollen. Spend 20-30 minutes a day, both during the work day and prior to your leg and/or your lower body workout with your back on the floor and your legs up against the wall or up against the side of a couch or chair. The gravity helps to return the blood back up to the heart, restoring optimum circulation. Doing so will help promote an important physical and psychological transition between work and training.<br>  <br>  Recovery during training<br>  <br>           Time between sets is important. You must always take no less than a minute break between sets. You can also follow your heart rate. Everyone is different in this area. Usually when you “feel ready” it is alright to start the nest set.<br>         Movement between sets is important. It is not a good idea to sit down or do as little as possible. The movement could be considered the cool-down from the previous set and the warm-up for the next set. This practice aids circulation and helps reduce swelling of muscular tissues.<br>  <br>  Post-training recovery  <br>  <br>          Contrast showers are done immediately after training. Expose your lower lumbar area to alternating hot and cold water- as hot as you can stand it for two minutes followed by progressively colder water, almost to the point of discomfort.<br>            Cryokentics is another way to help ease any discomfort. Immediately after leaving the shower, construct an ice bag by placing crushed ice in a Zip-lock bag. Lie down on the floor with your feet propped up on the couch and place the bag under your lumbar spine. To improve the effect of this procedure threefold, try stretching your spine while on the ice. Gently perform side to side flexions alternated with pulling your knees to your chest. Mobilizing your spine this way will help counteract the stiffness that you may have experienced icing your back in the past.|`|klcqgST9aa	Actually, it's the best for you. <br>  <br>  If you're sore, stretching before bed makes you significantly less sore the next day.|`|2RzEaod9aa	Great way to help them along!|`|om4uztzxaa	ya it wil soon help when you start to do it more often.

The best way to rid the pain is to de-stress (cool down which involves stretches and other techniques, some sort of relaxing state, such as sauna, massage or other; then rest. Sleep is the best rest.<br>  <br>  Of course, some muscular pain can be caused through means other than workout. If your muscular pain is not resulting after a workout or similar, and rather an ongoing symptom, you should seek professional medical advice, as it can be a sign of diabetes etc..

tIldpr7vaa	what?<br>  <br>  what?<br>  <br>  just wear normal underwear<br>  <br>  why would u need a jock strap to go to the gym????<br>  <br>  and u shouldnt even own a thong, ur a guy.....|`|8SRjELNBaa	try special running briefs?|`|BwUSAXxqaa	The sensation of soreness is quite normal in the gym. When you are doing cardiovascular workouts, every part of your body is sweating, resulting in fibres in your clothing latching to your hair/skin. This causes the sensation you described.<br>  <br>  If you bear with it, it should reside after 5-10 minutes of workout.<br>  <br>  I use open leg boxers when I workout, this lets sweat drip down my legs so it doesn't clog in my groin. This may be a problem with jocks. They are not designed for workout.<br>  <br>  Best advice I can give is that underwear is not needed at the gym, just wear shorts / tracksuit bottoms and you should be fine.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!

While you can just do stairs I recommend you do a full rounded workout routine specifically for you butt!

Those with arthritic or orthopedic pain are often referred to swimming pools to reduce the impact of exercise on joints. <br>  <br>  The problem is your gluteous needs heavy resistance training to tone itself, but that means stress on the knees in most cases. <br>  <br>  There is also a move done in ballet that is good for the gluteous. I forget its name, but you would stand behind a tall chair for support, place your feet about a foot apart with a slight turn out, then while holding the chair gently swing one leg directly behind you about 2 feet. This should be done with care and limited by any pain you might feel, NEVER, force yourself into painful exercise. Do 15 - 20 on each leg, switch to other leg, rest and repeat. <br>  <br>  Perhaps you can find it here in the link. The ballet regime is very good at defining the back side. enjoy.|`|5WgdJnymaa	Lube up and take it, lol|`|603315c13a3cf656a5cfd03d3e86c83daa	If you can take pressure on your knees...get on all fours (hands and knees - back straight - parallel to the floor), straighten one leg and the other knee is on the ground to support.  Raise the straightened leg up a little past the level of your hips.  Hold for the count of five (or longer).  Release and let the leg go back down, but don't touch the floor with it...then raise it again...do the same count...release.  You can do lifts too, in this position...the straightened leg is straight out behind you, and you move it only a few inches up and down in that position (do 10 x) and then release, rest the muscle by placing on the floor again, and then lift it again to do it several times.  Then do the other leg...you will feel this in your BUTT - trust me!!!  And it will give results!!!|`|713c406736ac22ae3f3a95a98dedc9c7aa	keep ur pumper tight|`|AA10569992	Go up and down the stairs.

Those drinks can have upwards of 400 calories a pop! That's almost a meal right there if you're trying to lose weight. Your best bet is to stick to plain or flavored fresh brewed coffee with light creamer or milk. If you can't forgo the sugar and maybe you don't like artificial sweeteners, (I know I can't!) try substituting half splenda and half regular sugar. It works for me. Good luck!
fwjbcHZxaa	trying to "bulk" up is ok. If the reason u are doing it is for yourself and not trying to impress anyone. The quickest way i found personally. Was a high protien diet to help repair the muscles u tear everyday working out. I don't mean <br>  fastfood protien either. Try haveing yogurt and and fresh fruit for breakfast, Fruit and a meat for lucnh. Depending on when u workout is how ur supper is decided. if u workout before supper eat some carbs right before working out and a reasonable supper veggies included. If u work out after supper try to eat a light snak like yougurt before bed for protien .|`|87eb743c448db479f51f7e03d9ef185baa	I dunno.....Big Macs with razor blades added?

I am following the south beach eating plan because I eat real food 5-6 times a day.  No shakes or bars as my meal.  The hardest part for me is not eating sweets everyday.  I eat sweets every now and then and I eat sugar free things(pudding, jello, ice pops, etc)  Sweets were always my downfall so that has been difficult.  Get the book and read about the plan first.  You need to understand how it works, what you can and can't eat and how food affects your body.  I also chose this plan because I will never have to change how I eat.  I will eat this way for the rest of my life.  With other plans like Jenny, Nutrasystem, Weight Watchers, you are eating their food so what happens when you reach your goal?  Do you continue to eat their expensive food or will you know how to eat correctly to keep the weight off.  South Beach teaches you how to eat correctly for the rest of your life.  I love this plan so try it.  Good Luck.
OlArsADUaa	I lost almost 40 pounds by eating nothing but tuna and only drinking water.  I also did cardio at the gym every day.  It was hard at first cuz I hate tuna, but it got easier as time went by.  It was really worth it.  I only took me 2 months.   Since then I have found that you can eat a very small amount of carbs and still have good results.  You can have vegetables and salads and substitute fresh fish for tuna.  Try it, it takes willpower but the results are worth it.

People tend to lose weight from the top down I've found, so chances are the first thing that anyone will notice is hollows in your cheeks and a slimmer jawline.<br>  <br>  Your eating plan sounds good, as does the walking.  There have been studies that found that over the course of a year, people who walked daily lost an average of 7 pounds in the year, without making other big dietary changes.  So, you should do well with it.<br>  <br>  When you have your junk food, have it immediately after you walk.   When you walk for more than 30 minutes, it revs up your metabolism for an equal amount of time...so a 30 minute = 30 minutes of increased fat and food burning once you stop walking.  So, it's the best time to get the junk food in, out and gone.<br>  <br>  Good luck and don't give up!|`|0pSOTMCVaa	First and foremost your 13 yrs old, and you dont want to set unhealthy goals where you might be limiting the nutrients you might actually need, you are still growing up, so youll need more than what us adults need, Just stay away from the junk food, limit your sodas, and stay active and you wont need to worry about dieting as much|`|1yzID6feaa	well i heard weight watchers is pretty good my aunt whent there for a while and she lost a good bit of weight!<br>  i think your plan could work also! i love fruit and veggies real good as a shake!|`|26ca8551615859e51b6652eadf023db5aa	actually that sounds like a pretty good plan.  you will lose weight all over and yes likely see some loss in the face. and no the skin won't just be hanging especially if you lose at a good, slow, healthy pace, it will shrink with the underlying tissue.|`|6a8e20c863ca841049aed0504d7c3610aa	You are very young, so you probably will not have problems with your hanging skin, because you mentioned you will exercise, i think it is a good idea to continue eating well and healthy, you are going to reach your goal, but if you can go to a nutritionist, that can pay attention to your health, regarding to your face, yes it is going to lose weight too.|`|ThY9DHpbaa	Why hello there!<br>  Well, I just want to first say GOOD LUCK!!

The hardest part about the weight loss is to continue with your good habits.<br>  <br>  The habits you have listed are GREAT: Remember though, the only way to maintain your weightloss goal is to keep up with it. If you start to fall back into old habits, try and refocus and take a different approach that you can stick with.<br>  <br>  For me personally, everyone commented about how my face looked so much thinner. Before it was really round, and after it began to seem less rounded. The bad part is that I had a lot of loose skin in my neck region.

qTDCLQopaa	I just started on Papayamine. It is NOT a diet but a whole food! It helps by giving your body all the nutrition it need and is also a fiber so it digests slower. This keeps you full longer nad removes cravings. I take one shake in the morning mixed with orange juice. Then two capsule a couple hours later. Then another shake for lunch. Then two capsules 20 min. before dinner. I have lost a bunch of weight with this.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.papayamine.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.papayamine.com</a><br>

0EL8ojumaa	the only problem with those marks are maybe either your glasses are too tight at the nose, or just small in general but that normally isn't the case, if your really into buying contact lenses, ive known many people who switch to those and once they get used to it apparently they are great! Contact lenses can vary in price ranging from about $20.00 to $75.00 depending on the brand or even if your buying a daily, weekly or monthly pack of contact lenses.|`|MiKrWuM6aa	Your eyes are not shrinking.

Sometimes, the frames make those red spots on your nose, usually means the frames don't fit right or maybe because the lenses are very thick and heavy. If you decide to get contacts, just make sure you follow the instructions for how long you can leave them in, proper cleaning, etc, so you don't trash your eyes like so many others have done.
niZBsn9Qaa	under 2000. Shoot for about 1800 calories a day. I count my calories at<br>  <br>  www.my-calorie-counter.com LOL this isnt spam, i promise. I'm not selling anything, just telling you what I do. Its free, you can make an account and keep a journal that helps you track how many calories you eat in a day. watch your portion sizes or you'll be eating a lot more than you think.<br>  <br>  men need more calories than women so decreasing your caloric intake by 500 calories every day will help you lose weight. You need to do some cardio exercise too. Go walking, jogging or something that gets your heart rate up for at least 30 minutes.<br>  <br>  that will help you. :)|`|nAvTMXmgaa	Maybe she said that you needed to eat more because you are overweight and to make your body work you need more calories than 2000 -2500 , But you still need to exercise.<br>  It seems that you just listen to your nutritionist but you really didn't understand what she said. And you really didn't ask anything back. <br>  You should exercise 3 to 5 days a week, even with 3 days a week you will see results. You still nedd to eat more healthy. Remember that healthy doesnt mean food without flavor. <br>  I LOVEEE general tso chicken but when I make it I dont fry it, I bake it. Little changes.<br>  Exercise more and eat less junk food, Dont take it all from your normal eating but eat it more consciously.<br>  Good Luck.<br>  <br>  And talk wiht your nutricionist.
6vdSFw5Jaa	1...never use Visine with your contacts. Make sure you use something made especially for contacts or you will regret it (it burns horribly)<br>  #2 Dont skimp on your solution. The best is Clear Care, and it is expensive but your eyes will thank you and your contacts will last longer. Just go to Wal Mart and you should be able to get it for about $7. <br>  #3. Get a can(not bottle) of Saline solution. You can put it in your eyes if you need to, it is inexpensive (I use the WalMart brand) and you can use the more expensive stuff every other day if you are concerned about price.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|y9MnE0zQaa	If you have contact solution you could pour a couple of drops of that into your eye. And if your contacts are getting dry really wuicky tell your eye doctor. You might have astigmatism. you can get contacts for astigmatism so its nothing bad.|`|J2G6ebThaa	that happened all the time to me! with mine i just close my eyes for a minute and then they get better you should try it or are you keeping your eyes open and never blink that might be the problem!|`|XS5CfmAMaa	*****DO NOT USE VISINE*****<br>  <br>  Visine, or any eyedrops, unless they SPECIFICALLY say for "For Contacts" will turn your contacts a sickly shade of yellow.  Not a cool shade a yellow, a "I have jaundice or hepatitis C" shade of yellow.<br>  <br>  If this is your first day and your contacts are bothering you, take them out.  The 4 hour thing is just a suggestion to get you used to them.  You personally might only be able to tolerate them for 2-3 hours.  The contact lens technician should have told you that or given you written instructions saying that, if not, shame on them.  If you can't make it 4 hours, don't worry.  Just make a note of how long you were able to keep them in today, and tomorrow try to add 30 minutes to that. Keep on adding 30 minutes each day until you can wear them most of the day.<br>  <br>  If your eyes become too irritated, cut back 30 minutes.  Your doctor should have scheduled a free follow-up visit for you in a 1 or more weeks.  Do not miss that visit.  If you can't wear them for more than an a couple hours without irritation, let him know. He may need to adjust some aspect of the prescription.<br>  <br>  There is no hurry in getting used to them.  Use only the cleaning solution designed for contacts.  Look online for deals, there are lots of sources for contact lens solution.  You are not married to a particular brand either.  Some people are sensitive to the preservatives in certain brands, try a few different ones until you find one you like.

SLiGpyoqaa	Hey there.<br>  When I was 11, I started getting pimples, and it was hell.<br>  The pimples weren't that bad, now that I think about it. It was the fact that I had pimples so young, and that I 'developed' so young, that I was overly conscious of myself and it did terrible things to my self esteem.<br>  <br>  Wanting my pimples banished immediately, I began to see my local doctor, who reccommended me to an excellent dermotologist. As I grew older, my skin got worse and worse, so I tried several different medications and now it wasn't just in my head, my skin had the potentional to scar.<br>  <br>  Eventually, when I was 14, I couldn't take it anymore. I had tried products like 'Differin' that worked well, but I wanted an even better result from my efforts. So, I decided to try Roaccutane.<br>  <br>  I took it for about 8 months. I started on 1 tablet every 2 days, then increased the dose to 1 tablet every day, then eventually 2 tablets each day. <br>  <br>  There were side effects, such as the peeling (which dries out your skin, which is exactly the idea of Roaccutane!) - that not only peeled on my face, but also on my lips, arms and legs. So, as a result, that made my skin quite itchy. I dealt with that quite well, I'd like to think. Roaccutane also makes you more prone to skin damage, so you really, really have to be careful to apply lots of sunscreen, as you're more prone to burning, peeling, etc. I had to wear a lot of lip balm and apply a moisturizer to my legs and arms. Also, you are not allowed to get pregnant on Roaccutane, and 2 months after completion or extermination of the course. Why? Baby deformities! Think of the poor life you could destroy!<br>  <br>  Don't ever underestimate the power of Roaccutane. It's incredibly powerful, that's why the side effects are so powerful, but if you put up with them, you should be good. I thought there was no way my skin could ever get perfectly clear again, but I surprised myself. I've never felt happier with it.<br>  <br>  My friends are incredibly jealous of my skin, and it's so easy now that I think about it, to get great skin. Diet is so important, so is having a cleansing routine, drinking plently of water, staying out of the sun, but at the same time still getting enough vitamins, the whole 'less is more' rule applying to makeup and products. If only I could have told my 10 year old self 'If you don't start looking after your skin, you're going to regret it." But I'm glad I can pass on this advice that I was handed down from my excellent dermotologist.<br>  <br>  So, basically, what am I trying to tell you? Go with Roaccutane (or whatever it's called now, I believe it recently changed names, just after I finished my course), it has an incredibly high success rate (like, once you go through the course, you'll never get pimples like you previously had ever again), the side effects are worth it and it's is really the only product that I will ever try and talk you into using, because it works so bloody well!!!|`|eiMQLW7raa	I took them starting august. Since then it has only gotten better. I had horrible acne and my face was inflamed . Little by little, the acne just dissappeared! I had really no side effects, other then the fact that my doc told me to get out of the sun while on it and I did, and got really white. so now I blush reallly easily  but I can fix that over a weekend or two. I really think it is a good idea if you have bad acne cause it works real good.|`|nQZEJz5yaa	i dont know about ROaccutane but my friend used accutane and its like yellow pills and she had to take it everyday for like 30 days or something like that.. and now she looks like she never had acne! :D|`|0ixo6bkdaa	Accutane (also known as Isotretinoin), or Roaccutane as is also known in parts of the world, was discovered in 1979 when it was first given to patients with severe acne, most of whom reacted with dramatic and permanent clearing of their acne symptoms. It is a vitamin A derivative (13-cis-retinoic acid) which is administered orally in pill form, normally for 15-20 weeks (3.5-4.5 months). It was originally prescribed for people with severe acne that did not respond to other treatments, but has gained in popularity in the past 25 years and is prescribed more and more frequently for less severe acne. Accutane is a serious medication which must be taken under close doctor's supervision. Blood tests are required and side effects can be as devastating as they are widespread.

But, yes, 96bpm is fast if you're resting, although it can go fast if you're worried when your heart rate is measured - measure it yourself - count the beats and look at your watch when you're calm and sitting down. About 1 beat per second is good.<br>  If you're really worried, go back to the doc and say so, if they don't convince you (doctors have bad days, too)  then ask for another opinion.<br>  Finally, skipped beats are usually normal. They happen every day without you noticing but I'd hope that if you're seeing a cardiologist, they'd check to make sure.|`|q1puEiJdaa	You are perfectly normal. My heart rate is usually around the same as yours. I know that 'experts' say it should be around 70-80 but in fact everyone is different. I am very fit and healthy, yet I go on the machines at the gym and find myself next to overweight people who have been referred by their doctors for high blood pressure etc. and their heart rates are really low. Well I know who is the 'normal' one.<br>  <br>  As for the skipping a beat, this is known as an ectopic beat, and again is perfectly normal. I get those too. By the way getting stressed will increase their likelihood. So chill.|`|63b8892e0c06e0254bc789045597e018aa	I had the same problem. Saw a cardiologist, who also said everything is fine.<br>  I agree with you that it feels weird.<br>  After receiving the reassurance, it became less noticeable over a period of time.|`|TiX5Z4Zbaa	Eat low fat food.|`|fg9TUTg6aa	If your cardiologist and your doctor who are both trained in this special field say it is nothing to worry about than I am sure it is nothing to worry about
k3ZVZmBJaa	First, these are not stupid questions.  I can only answer to a limited extent because I do not live in the UK, but a psychologist is a doctor (of philosophy or psychology) whereas a psychiatrist is a medical doctor.  What that really means is that psychiatrists can prescribe meds while psychologists cannot.<br>  <br>  Typically, psychologists are more involved in psychotherapy.  They are more likely to perform it and rely on it in treating mental illness or emotional issues.  Some of the more common approaches are cognitive behavioral therapy (or dialetic behavioral therapy), psychoanalysis, gestalt, etc. Psychiatrists are less likely to administer talk therapy; they prefer medication treatment.  Of course, that is just a generalization of how it is in America.  I would think it would be the same or similar in UK.<br>  <br>  General physicians do not always refer someone to a psychologist or psychiatrists.  Social workers and licensed mental health counselors can also perform therapy, so many physicians will refer someone to them, especially if it is not a severe mental illness (e.g. schizophrenia). <br>  <br>  I can't tell you how long the referral time is, but it can be pretty long in the US depending on the popularity of the mental health professional.  It's probably not as long as the UK simply because of the universal healthcare you guys have.|`|c696f477a4d1a069e6273b7aae58b19daa	Mainly the psychiatrist prescribes medicine and talks little to you or not so often as a psychologist who also analyzes you and you have more often appointments with and talk about you more.   Both usually lately prescribe antidepressants and send you home!|`|kafQ6AJBaa	Basically one can perscribe medicine.The psychiatrist is the one who can give the medicine|`|WxoZrTPlaa	A psychiatrist can actually prescribe medication, whereas a psychologist primarily provides talk therapy or other behavior modification techniques.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry, but I'm in the U.S. so can't answer specifically about the U.K.

0QURsUu8aa	since you couldnt get the dull razor to shave, you would proably push down harder so you could get the places you missed and eventually, press down too hard and cut yourself.<br>  <br>  sharp razors are easier to work with because it just glides down without you needing to press down.<br>  <br>  make sure not to shave everyday because that causes your hair to become thicker and blacker, unless you have blonde hair but you wouldnt need to shave if you did have blonde hair XD|`|xbedCzcraa	I don't know. <br>  use hair remover.. much easier than shaving, getting cut, and razor burn. :) <br>  <br>  put hair remover on, wait 6 mins, wash it off, DONE.. simple! :)|`|3hETupPOaa	good question, maybe because you push down harder and the uneven blade cuts some places but only shaves others.|`|pBRN4xxTaa	use veet|`|BNAzjSO1aa	Because a sharp razor glides smoothly over the skin and a dull one scrapes against the skin
E0fv8ywoaa	well, the ibm (in  french, or bmi in english) isn't all, u must get her the blood test, to know if everything is ok, plus, the ibm isn't very exact, because the ibm gives values to a normal body, but not all bodies are alike, some of them have the bones really thick and others have them really thin, some have fat weight and others have muscles that give them weight. and your girl isn't fully grown, she'll have many changes in her body, like her breast will grow, her hips will get larger, she'll get taller, and the ibm is usually more exact with adults, more then kids. but if you feel your kid is growing underweight and that this is affecting her activities, then u must consult a doctor, or else, let her grow and u'll see, everything will turn out to be great.|`|qVma2xawaa	The formula for losing those excess pounds is simple - eat less and move more - the difficulties surface when we actually try to put that into operation!

We need to learn 3 definitions: the number of calories in our food, the number of calories a certain activity expends every 60 minutes, and finally our own personal daily allowance of calories. The one thing that clearly delivered for me was wu-yi tea, it can be viewed in the resource box underneath, they have a handful of free trials in stock, it was highlighted in Fox News and USA Today. I lost twenty five pounds, it clearly does produce success!|`|Y7SbSK30aa	u should be eating between 1500 to 2000 calories.<br>  but to maintain your weight, the amount of calories<br>  you work off should equal the amount you eat.<br>  <br>  example: i ate 1600 calories today. enough to maintain it, i should work out today till i burn off at least 1000 calories
9MSeSH5yaa	It sounds like you have or are developing Obsessive Compulsive Disorder and perhaps some sort of Anxiety Disorder. The only thing you can do is to see a doctor. Most urban areas have mental health clinics that are very affordable and offer therapy as well as medicine evaluations. It is also totally anonymous, so no worries there. Good luck!|`|MRWDXeXsaa	What you have is called OCD (Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder).  A way that you can stop it from getting worse is to force yourself to not do any of your "rituals."  Even though it will feel like something bad is going to happen, it most likely won't.  Unfortunatly, if you don't stop now, it will probably get worse.

zXHNSohTaa	Is the weather very dry where you are now? Have you been indoors with central heat or air that might be drying out your nasal passages?<br>  <br>  I just had this happen. I went to my doctor and was told it was nothing to be worried about, just the mucus membranes being dried out due to environmental dryness.<br>  <br>  They recommended a humidifier or nasal saline wash (available at a drugstore). There's now more moisture in the air and I'm fine again.<br>  <br>  Good luck, feel better!|`|sw2R5A9iaa	drink more water, use a nasal rinse, run a vaporizer when you sleep, and see your doctor.|`|MGTnkGnWaa	Sometimes certain things in the air can really irritate my nose. For instance, when we burn a fire at the house the fume from the logs make my nose bleed easily. Also, it could be from the cold, dry air. Or maybe you could be developing allergies or a sinus infection. I wouldn't get concerened unless it did it again, or you get headaches or other signs of allergies.
Q3ZGsQZKaa	And if you don't do these things (especially the bedroom part), do you feel like something really bad will happen to you sooner or later?<br>  <br>  Ya, thats happened to me b4, but it stopped almost a year ago.  All I can say is that maybe its stress, and you have to lighten up.  You have to tell yourself that you are crazy, and your fears are foolish.  I know it sounds hard, but after you get into the practice of ignoring your compulsive thoughts, you'll soon quit it.<br>  I don't think its OCD, just a childish behavior.  But that doesn't make it a good thing either.|`|FIG58FVpaa	It sounds like it to me... The whole brushing your teeth over if you "mess up" was a give away for me. <br>  <br>  It doesn't sound like you do anything harmful, at least. If you're concerned, though, you might want to talk to your doctor about it next time you have a checkup.|`|qXCgeye3aa	i like things done a certain way too...like everything has to be straight.<br>  and like the writing thing too...ill have to start over if i mess up.<br>  and everything in my kitchen always has to be in the exact place.<br>  i think thats mild ocd, its not bad...you just like thing a certain way.

A lot of people love salty foods, that is probably why you crave it.<br>  <br>  The only possible bad thing would be the acidity could wear away then enamel on your teeth, so rinse your mouth out afterwords or brush. :)|`|6nO14vOkaa	It is not bad for you just make sure you brush your teeth real good after you are sone eating..

In fact, the steam helped me feel much better.|`|YqHL52H5aa	It is actually a good idea to take a nice, long warm shower when ill.  It helps clear out your sinuses.  However, you must be careful not to become chilled.  Blow dry your hair immediately after leaving shower even if you feel warm, and get dressed right away.<br>  <br>  Otherwise you may feel worse instead of better.|`|BxXI9AHcaa	Yes.  Blowdry after.|`|qO3w1Iq7aa	yea im sick and i still take a shower

Good luck to your mum!|`|9pLdhuBnaa	It could be symptomatic of something like asthma (an example only).<br>  <br>  The only way to know for sure what is going on is for her to see her doctor for further evaluation of the situation to see what they say.
WjESRTiKaa	Acne is a menace. However, it’s not something that cannot be tackled. There are loads of acne skin care products around. We can classify acne skin care products into 3 broad categories – <br>  * Preventive or general acne skin care products<br>  * Over-the-counter, specialised acne skin care products <br>  * On-prescription acne skin care products. <br>  <br>  The general acne skin care products are the ones that are used as acne-prevention measure. These include cleansers, make-up removers and similar products that help prevent acne. In the real sense, these acne skin care products are just those that should anyway be part of your daily routine. However, some of these are more oriented to act like an acne skin care product. These acne skin care products act against the causes of acne e.g. limiting the production of sebum/oil and preventing clogging of skin pores. Basically, these acne skin care products prevent the oil from getting trapped in pores and hence hamper the growth of bacteria that lead to acne. The general acne skin care products also include exfoliation products like skin peels. These work towards removing dead skin cells, hence reducing the possibility of pore-clogging and bacteria development.<br>  <br>  Then there are specialised acne skin care products that are available over-the-counter i.e. without the need of a prescription. These include products like vanishing creams which extract the extra oil from the skin. Most of these acne skin care products are based on benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid, both of which are the enemies of bacteria (and hence acne). You should start with a product that has lower concentration of benzoyl peroxide (e.g. 5%) and see how your skin responds to it.  Alpha-hydroxy-acid based moisturizers are also popular as acne skin care products. You might have to try a few, before you zero-in on the acne skin care product that is effective for you. If nothing seems to work, you should contact a dermatologist. <br>  <br>  On-prescription acne skin care products are the ones that are prescribed by a dermatologist. This can include ointments that can be applied on the affected area or oral antibiotics or just any topical treatment. Dermatologist could also suggest a minor surgical procedure to remove the contents of pustules.  However, never try to squeeze or do this by yourself, it can lead to permanent damage of your skin.  Your doctor could also prescribe a hormone-based treatment (since hormonal changes are also known to cause acne). Such acne skin care products are known to be very effective in some cases.<br>  So, with all those acne skin care products, tackling acne is not that difficult.|`|Rp3QC8WDaa	Get proactiv, it works 100%
AA11523772	Yep. I started when I was eleven. my mom did too. It's genetics the way puberty goes. Some girls don't start their periods until college. Crazy right? But true. You're an active girl, and all the dancing probably stresses your body out, and the hinders your period from happening. So when you finally slowed down that gave your body a reason to operate normally for a change. I can tell you love dancing. I do too only I'm not dancer (no discipline) but you need to slow down a little sometimes so that your body doesn't conk out on you. Take care.|`|oAH71drxaa	Your period shoudl continue but may be quite irregular after the first one you may not have another for 6months or so.

Eliminate almost all fat, butter, cream, milk products, sugar, refined carbs (like white bread), meat, fish, nuts, egg yokes, and other fats (animal and vegetable). Sadly, the US food pyramid is dictated by industry special interest groups. Milk is very bad food. Do your own research. The Canadian food pyramid is a little less biased.<br>  <br>  You do need one tablespoon of oil, but no more than that each day. All of your essential amino acids required for protein are available through eating beans and brown rice. This is a lifestyle change (permanent). In addition, make sure to eat whole grains, vegetables, and fruits. After a week you can start to workout. Look up "aerobic exercise" for information about how to monitor your heart rate. A healthy and fit person needs about one hour of aerobic exercise five days per week. You need to work up to this level.<br>  <br>  Next, you should learn how to use free weights to build muscle mass. You'd be surprised how little time is required to build bulky muscles.<br>  <br>  Avoid corporate products. They all are intended to deplete your wallet of cash. They usually contain over-processed and expensive items that are a health risk. <br>  <br>  The media and government are in cahoots to enrich themselves. Their intent is not benign.|`|4cWtH7X2aa	First of all 135lbs is not fat, so don't listen to that moron.

ba57fb92aa421eaa3a4ae7f0f80f397caa	A bruise is caused by bleeding under the skin.  There's no mechanism that would cause sustained bleeding in a single location for several years except repeated trauma, which would be painful.   People with blood clotting problems can develop spontaneous bruises that do not hurt, but the bruises tend to show up randomly throughout the body, but most frequently are found in locations where there is something putting direct pressure on the skin (like the bottom of the forearms from leaning your arms on a table).  <br>  <br>  Since you didn't mention pain or odd bruises in other locations, the coloration is probably something other than a bruise.|`|vpRERM9jaa	maybe it's a birthmark...|`|bb912ce61f49cc45dfbfa372f8622380aa	You may be confusing a bruise for a brown skin lesion called a Cafe' au lait  pigmentation.

They are always there, but they are made more noticeable by not sleeping enough or looking at screens!<br>  <br>  You should go to an opticians if you are worried!|`|ehvUYsgLaa	i think you should get your eyes checked hun|`|XBYiHaWIaa	Invest in some specs!|`|AA11307873	You most likely didn't do this by "overusing" your eyes.<br>  <br>  Sometimes the jelly-like fluid that fills the eye contracts and pulls on the retina.  It can actually pull a few cells off the retina when it contracts and your brain "sees" these cells as something colored in your vision.<br>  <br>  You should contact an ophthalmologist for an appointment to check for any possible damage to the retina.  Usually, these floaters, as they're called, are not anything to worry about if you have no other problems.  If you have decreased vision, a curtain or veil appearing over your vision or you suddenly see a multitude of the floaters, this becomes an urgent problem namely, a possible retinal detachment.<br>  <br>  What you are describing is something that sounds like it should be checked in the next few weeks as long as there is no change in your symptoms.<br>  <br>  Tell your mom/dad about this.|`|1LdgTQodaa	hi someone i now had a problem like you a few weeks ago.she kept getting this little patch about half way up her eye which kept going fuzzy.she said it was like looking through a kaleidescope and it was just in that one place.she did go to the optician who said it was nothing serious ,and it was like having a headache in your eye.they did tell her to stay off the comp for a while,so if i were you i would try and rest it for a while ,i know itll be hard not coming on answers lol,but im sure youll get through it .hope this helps.|`|AEmgc6IRaa	What your probably seeing is your eyelash, maybe or something on that.|`|AlZflmgdaa	DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND GO TO AN EYE DOCTOR!

sQu3LLqtaa	Most prescription medication is regarded as poison by our bodies and that is why unpleasant side effects are so common as our bodies reject such poisons.<br>  <br>  Natural medication in most cases has no side effects but there are, of course, isolated exceptions.|`|QE77Oxtqaa	When used as directed for constipation, no.<br>  When used as a way to purge your body daily, yes. They make it so your body depends on it for all elimination.|`|4yFDVPhQaa	Yes. Using laxatives over a long period of time as a way of purging is very damaging to your body and internal organs. It becomes a part of an eating disorder.|`|R0Zx8Q8Baa	YES!!!BE VERY CAREFUL WITH THEM!!!befroe u use any,u should ask a doctor.be careful,and goodluck :) a natural one that would be good is green tea,make sure to hydrate tho.|`|RdLU5nVOaa	yes the make u poo water...i took an od by mistat...when i snezzes my butt turned brown....
eZDoQPg8aa	I'd look at allergies, especially to something in her bedroom.  It could be a simple as she's allergic to the scent in your fabric softener that you put in your wash.  It could be dust or dirt (not that I am saying your house is dirty!) but if you don't have a good vacuum, they spew dirt/dust around rather than gather it up.  It could even be a food allergy!<br>  <br>  Try keeping a diary of sorts.  Make note of what she eats, when you run the sweeper, when you change her bedding, where she's been for the day and maybe you can get a pattern to emerge and that will help you figure out what is causing the issue.  <br>  <br>  Getting a new vacuum with HEPA filtration will help, so will an air purifier and or a humidifier in her room.  It's tough because it could be so many different things!|`|UmSDoQXZaa	At 4 years I was diagnosed with croup. That was horrible. But if it saved my life, it might save your daughter's life, too. You might want to check her with that. I woke up in the middle of the night, gasping for air. They rushed to the hospital. After three days, I was allowed to go home. They treated me with a breathing machine and a mask. The air-like medicine was breathed into my lungs, and I eventually became better. It's my opinion, throwing up and losing your breath are symptoms. Hope she gets better!
ghXH7JZRaa	Stop telling him about your weight loss plan|`|g6Vci5SUaa	Tone up instead of dieting.  You'll look thinner, sleeker, and yet might even gain a little weight, which would make your doctor happy, and your body look better without the fat.  Plus, the added muscles will increase your metabolism, allowing your body to burn calories faster and more efficiently.  Instead of talking to your doctor about dieting, ask him about what exercises he would recommend for you to "firm up".<br>  <br>  Good luck! :)|`|cKSbZBt8aa	Eat more vegetables for fibre.  Eat more protein to boost metabolism (fish, chicken)  Exercise like walking 30 minutes a day or more.  That way you eat more, but with less fat content, lose fat tissue from the fibre, and will look good to.|`|PPd6T0BCaa	You clearly have weight issues and worries, but with a BMI of 19 (when 17-18 is classed as underweight) you are already very thin. Being worried about a tiny amount of fat on your stomach is normal for young women and doesnt mean that you have an eating disorder. But you may be more prone to developing an eating disorder. This is why the doctor is concerned, he/she is really just looking out for you. My advice would be to throw away any magazines you have with skinny celebs and concentrate on eating as much fruit and veg as you can possibly eat. Let your doctor monitor you if need be, it is important to keep a healthy weight.|`|4HQxLXQCaa	"I can see that I have some fat on my stomach and legs!"<br>  OH MY GOD THE SKY IS FALLING!<br>  Don't worry about it, everyone has at least a little bit of fat on their legs and stomach.  Even models (you just don't see it because of photoshop and deceptive camera and lighting angles).<br>  <br>  "He said he would monitor my weight if I went any lower than where I am now- isn't this overreacting a bit?"<br>  No, you are overreacting a bit about something normal.<br>  <br>  Admit it.  You have been swept up by Hollywood and Fashon magazines into believing that the perfect woman has no fat on her body.  This is far from the truth.|`|9679eed4decfc91fdcea2e17ae362313aa	If you see "fat" you don't need to lose weight just build the muscle under the fat to make everything appear tighter. :)|`|40f9996319d13867c4bbea47b436ef3aaa	I don't think you need to loose weight, but maybe tone up?  Try working out.|`|qGiFTnC2aa	Under 19 is verging on below weight.  That's OK, but when you obsess to him about having to lose weight because of a miniscule amount of fat on your stomach and legs (which is normal, and you need to have) then he would of course be thinking about anorexia. A normal, healthy teen with a BMI of under 19 shouldn't be focusing on weight like that. It would seem you have a distorted image of your body.<br>  <br>  A woman needs some fat - you can't live without it, and if you lose all of it not only will you be unhealthy you'll look like a 12 year old boy. I've been there, not a good look.  My BMI is 21 now, I've got a lot of muscle, I'm fit and toned but I have a little fat and I feel and look better for it.|`|Av2dBJ3Uaa	tell him what u think you probaby just dont look fat but usually the pounds you do way are made up by your muscle and maybee your just made out of fat (muscle does way more then fat) anyways best of luck|`|vYeS5mYnaa	maybe your doctor has reason for concern.<br>  why are you so worried about your weight?
PRzmwFfgaa	Yes.  They are terrible for your back.  And depending on how high the heel (Yes, like the heel you are suggesting) and the shape of the tip of the shoes, they can be bad for your toes.
R4WX5twzaa	Listen to your body. Your blood sugar may have been low, which is why you ate so much sugar. It's ok to spoil yourself once in a while, even when you're on a diet, as long as you don't do it too often, you shouldn't gain much of anything. I'm sure breaking your diet and being sick are two completely unrelated matters, and breaking your diet won't affect how quickly or slowly you recover.|`|dUj7rP2haa	You won't gain much if anything.  I wouldn't worry about it and concentrate of feeling better.|`|MLFaEBmEaa	My son suffered acute tonsillitis since Dec. 2007. He suffered with high fever every month & even twice a month. Searching for an answer with prayers is the best we can do as parents. Drinking antibiotics every month makes me worry and most especially when my 5yr old son screaming for the paint for having a high fever and his eyes is burning. It will definitely breaks your heart. Until God answered my prayer. The disease came back this 02.13.09. Our Charismatic leader endorsed me this BARLEY ESSENTIAL a food supplement. I increased the dosage since his first medication as 1/2 sachet for 3xday last 02.02.09. I let my son drink the Barley 1 sachet for 3xday starting the night he suffered the disease. On 02.14.09, morning came the exudative white patches starting to disappear. Prayer, Faith and Medication is the answer. Praise Be The Lord JESUS Christ. See www.spemhealtcare.com

ZH91TAHPaa	Loads of people have had those feeling before, including me, and it is natural. Just make sure that you don't actually do it! You are probably stressed, which can cause these feelings. If you get these feelings again, talk to your parents or your doctor, and tell them you have these feelings. I'm sure they will get you any help you need!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, and don't do anything stupid!|`|NLxcfGplaa	Don't do anything like that.

9EVcTnUWaa	Start with your doctor who ever takes care of your medical care for your physical health.  They will be able to help  your parents understand what's going on and that it's a real problem and not something that you can control.  Tell your doctor what you've told us and let them know that you truly want to go back into therapy.  Also after you start therapy don't stop unless it's something that the therapist says you're ready for it. Stopping therapy just because you start to feel better is like stopping antibiotics because you feel better. Just because you start to feel better does not mean that you are better. You probably stopped going to therapy just when you got to the difficult part.  You will get better results if you have your doctor on your side.  If you can't get to your doctor than have a school counselor  do the same thing either would be able to get your parents to understand what's going on.  I say start with your doctor because you probably didn't choose them, which means that your parents have trusted your life with this person and are there more likely to listen to them,  Especially since it's a person that they picked to help them take care of you.|`|UIpobEThaa	They seem to not want to face the fact you need some help-again.<br>  Try this:<br>  Ask your mom or dad :<br>  "when can we call to make an appointement?"<br>  <br>  If things like that don't work,go to your school counselor, please, and let him or her call your mom.|`|1oBilGHuaa	Talk to the counselor at your school.  The counselor may be able to set up an appointment with your parents to stress the importance of getting you help.  Maybe hearing from a professional will help your parents understand what is going on.  I hope you will get the help you want.  Best Wishes.

For the first few weeks i was fine then  got scared about going to school and stayed up every night because if i went to sleep then  school would come faster. I dont know why it was but i was terrified of going to school and for two weeks i would burst into tears when my dad parked up. In the end we went to the docters and he gave me some white minty medicine and said it would settle my stomach acid stopping me feel sick and upset. If you go to the docters they might give yopu the same thing. I also had the wierd warm feeling but not the pain.
rpnFxnCQaa	Auriella, you should see a doctor to get an accurate diagnosis.<br>  <br>  I can relate to how you feel. I had anxiety attacks too. I was thinking too much. For me, that was when I had to speak in public. Or when there would be more than a few people around me in the same room. It was something that started when I was a teenager and that lasted over years and subsequently affected my career until not so long ago. <br>  <br>  At some point, I was prescribed medicine but I wanted to avoid that because of side effects. That's when I discovered a program that literally pulled me out of that "hole". It is a 100% natural method. <br>  <a href="http://www.stop-your-anxiety-now.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.stop-your-anxiety-now.com</a><br>  <br>  The KEY is that you should no longer fear the thought of anxiety. You have to get out of/break that loop.<br>  <br>  There is always a solution! Cheers|`|PRzmwFfgaa	I had the same issue before.  You may want to see your doctor.  My doctor put me on anti-depressants for a little while.  They help a lot with anxiety.  And when I was taking them they really helped me to get a good peaceful sleep and deal with all of the underlying stress that was causing me to feel this way.
pjYQhPPBaa	Most nutritionists don't have to have a high degree of education in nutrition. Nutritionists tend to work with the public such as hospitals, schools, nursing homes, etc...<br>  <br>  Registered dietitians require more education in the nutrition field, and can work in the mentioned areas. However, unlike nutritionists, they can work privately with clients, rather than a business or with the public.

jfzSmuAcaa	I think you should stop acting like you mom is lazy.  Im sure she isnt if she has a car to drive YOU to see YOUR boyfriend. Im sure you eat and are taken care of.  Its hard being a parent, give your mom a break! One day when you have kids of your own you will see, it's not easy.  You know she is probably depressed right now, it's hard to get a job these days, help your mom out and maybe things will get better. She is a single parent  it's hard. Love, her and appreciate her, the same way I'm sure she does for you.|`|A8fdgVzQaa	I have a few things to share with you....<br>  I had a hysterectomy the day after Thanksgiving 2 years ago. I remember I didn't really totally feel like myself again until almost summer. <br>  Also, were her ovaries removed? If so she prob. needs hormone replacement. Hormones being out of wack can cause alot of problems. <br>  Next, I do understand how you feel. Like you i didn't have a dad in the picture. It was me, mom and brother. When I was younger I always thought my mom was lazy and complained way too much about being tired and going on about all the aches and pains. Now that I've been there and done that (divorce,single mom,2nd marraige,step-kids) I can completely understand why she was the way she was. Life can really wear you down at times. I look back wishing I had been kinder to her. <br>  So the truth may be a combination of things. I'm sure you care about your mom and your mom cares for you so try to do what you can to help things and not add to her problems. (real or not) <br>  Good Luck!
CNW6eAjoaa	The first suggestion is to ignore those who are telling you to get circumcised.  That is the last thing you need.<br>  Some of the guys have offered links to sites where you can read about stretches for a tight foreskin.  I am not at my home now so I cannot include the links I usually do.<br>  Essentially, all you need to do is take a bath or shower and let the warm water loosen and relax your skin.  Then, gently try the stretches that Korydon suggests as they seem to be in line with the links I have.<br>  Remember, this takes time.  Do not stretch to where you feel pain.  Pain tells you that too much pressure is being applied.  You can cause micro tears in the opening of the foreskin which will heal over with non elastic scar tissue.  You do not want this to happen.<br>  Keep retracting it, a little at a time,....holding it for a minute in the warm water flow, relax the stretch, and try again with a little more force. Pain will tell you to stop.<br>  If you repeat this procedure every time you shower, you should see results in two weeks and full and painless retraction in 3-4 months.<br>  Once it will retract painlessly, you are set for life.<br>  All this can be achieved without medical or parental intervention.  As an alternative, you can go to a doctor and ask for steroid creams that are made just for this purpose.  This cream helps to relax the foreskin muscle combination and permit easier retraction.<br>  If he doctor even hints at circumcision, be very firm and tell them it is not an option.  You do not need it.  Find another doctor if need be.<br>  Good luck with this.|`|31718204759da1a7cdd40b824d43650aaa	You must be a bit new to this.  The one thing that a foreskin will do is stretch.  Everyone has a tight one when they first get it.   Mine was tight as a young kid too.  <br>  <br>  Today you can park a car in there.  No cutting no surgery no doctor visit.  Jut a few months of stretching.  Start slow in a bath tub. Soak it and use baby oil.  The insert fingers and pull apart in tension.  Not only is this easy, but what could possibly be more fun.  Everything about having one is fun.<br>  <br>  Its the toy on the toy.  Like a girls lips caressing you 24 hours a day every day of the year.  I mean what boy would turn that down right ?  You are a head of the game now.  At one point I used marbles because they are inert, and hard to chip.  They come in variable sizes.  Increase the size each time.  You can gauge your progress. <br>  <br>  Your best answer.  From a guy that was a tight kid only to discover its up to you how tight you wan to leave it.  At first I could barely get two pinkies in there.  Later I could get four fingers.  Slowly now.  This takes weeks if not months.  Depends on how many baths you take per day to get the time in stretching done.  My mom not only knew what I was doing, she recommended it because she knew all about them. Being British its just known.  <br>  <br>  America seems to be in the dark about all this.  Your correct answer.   Be happy cause its fun.   Be slow too.  Little at a time. Stoping when there is pain.  As your head grown later in life you might need to do more of it.  Don't wait till the head grown bigger.  Start now.|`|i6RlYFo7aa	NO, do NOT get circumcised, don't listen to those telling you to do that, circumcision is the worst<br>  <br>  all you need to do is stretch the skin (look up foreskin stretching excercises) and get a steroid cream so the skin loosens up|`|q0ce9dEnaa	The skin may be dry; try taking more baths/showers and using less soap when you clean down there; also try to use moisturizing soaps. Otherwise, you may just need a circumcision.|`|5kBM0z1maa	Consider yourself fairly lucky, as enlarging the opening of your foreskin to facilitate normal retraction should come fairly quick and easy.  Some boys can't retract at all, and the process of "stretching" takes them much longer.<br>  <br>  Here's what you need to do.<br>  <br>  Pull outwards on your foreskin with your fingers.  If you can get a finger or two inside the opening, stretch it outward, also, as though you were holding open a sack.

ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.<br>  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which<br>  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow<br>  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without<br>  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For<br>  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food<br>  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on<br>  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If<br>  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey<br>  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your<br>  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to<br>  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,<br>  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the<br>  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a<br>  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,<br>  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target<br>  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a<br>  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you<br>  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).|`|tfgAayNgaa	try a vegan diet or vegetarian.

1vaqtRI2aa	I'd make her a little shorter, legs shorter, and a little less anorexic looking. The average size of a woman (especially since Barbie is supposed to be 6'0"") is a size 12, and Barbie is supposed to be a size 4-6.<br>  She looks a little too porn-star for me, even though she really does seem like she's supposed to be a strong woman.<br>  <br>  I'd make a larger range in Barbies. Different hair textures, colors, different skin colors, different features. It seems like there isn't a variety in different Barbies. If they just catered to girls of other nationalities, they'd make SO much more money. And yes, they have Kira and Theresa, but it looks exactly like Barbie but with dark skin. They should have the features of ethnic women, not like a white woman with dark skin.<br>  <br>  Man, I really wish I could make a new Barbie. I'm 18 and still love them!|`|eBKJRmEgaa	Maybe they should find the average hip, waist and bust measurements for the female population and model her on that.|`|POJNnWhDaa	You would push a button, and her clothes would fly off, she'd fall on her back, and her legs would fly open. And it would be fully anatomically correct.|`|MJyM1XWJaa	the truth about barbie is that if she was a real person her organs would not fit, she'd literally have to carry her intestines, stomach, liver and a few other organs in a bag outside her body.<br>  <br>  That being said, I'd make a new barbie that looked like a real woman. Any woman. with proper proportions.|`|8ce26ab177e31095808dde4f087d556baa	I think that if i was to design Barbie now I would make her around 5'6" (a little over my height, I'm 15) because it seems to be average.  <br>  <br>  I would probably make her measurements 36"-24"-26".  I know that's an unrealistic goal for women and girls to meet, but the point of Barbie is that she is aesthetically pleasing, not realistic.  Though it is not extremely unrealistic because I am not that skinny and my measurements are 34"-26"-35".<br>  <br>  I have ADHD...I can't finish this...<br>  <br>  Oh, P.S. 12 is not an average or attractive size.  I'm a 3, it's possible, and I would simply not want a size 12 doll, that would be a waste.|`|bmWKETgWaa	Barbie's neck is long and thin so that when she wears clothes made of ordinary fabrics, they will fit her.  The same for her tiny waist, her narrow hips, and her long thin legs. <br>  <br>  If you tried to make clothes for a normal woman out of heavy blankets and rugs, they would make her look like the Pillsbury Doughboy.  Same principle. <br>  <br>  Personally I would make Barbie's legs a little more shapely, and would make her feet a bit larger too.  They're designed for tiny high-heeled shoes, but they do look much too small.<br>  <br>  Some people would like to see hip joints that also moved sideways rather than just back and forth, but I think the doll is more modest-looking the way she is.
xfpJGBfwaa	Yes, when my mom had cancer, we drank essiac tea every morning.  We made a decoction of it and put a small amount into hot water every morning.  It seemed to help her with the pain.  I was so frazzled helping her that I don't remember any effects on me.  It didn't seem to affect any of the other drugs she was taking.  <br>  <br>  We got it mailorder from some guy who grew them but doesn't sell it anymore.  The formula is very specific and simple, there are only four herbs that we used:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essiac" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essiac</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/natural/patient-essiac.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/drugi...</a> <br>  <br>  My advice is, take the four herbs list to a health food store, and have them order the herbs for you, fresh if possible, dried if necessary - and dry and decoct them yourself.  Since there isn't any study to prove anything about it, experiment until you find the right proportions for you.<br>  <br>  UPDATE:  oh hey, I just noticed that Medline mentions using Black Walnut in some recipes.  DON'T!  It's otherwise known as wormwood, and can be toxic if not used in tiny amounts.  Just use the four herbs, they work fine.|`|3jFm0rWdaa	I used some for cancer, combined with calendula flower and european misteltoe combined in a tea - a tumor I had disappeared (lymphoma diagnosed in a hospital) and the tumors of a patient I gave them to disappeared too.

sp4CifVSaa	Im not 100% sure, but I wouldnt use expired vitamins or expired oral sprays.. other medications like tynenol and advil and alka seltzer are okay to use..<br>  <br>  <br>  heres an excerpt of the article that answers ur question :<br>  "First, the expiration date, required by law in the United States, beginning in 1979, specifies only the date the manufacturer guarantees the full potency and safety of the drug -- it does not mean how long the drug is actually "good" or safe to use. Second, medical authorities uniformly say it is safe to take drugs past their expiration date -- no matter how "expired" the drugs purportedly are. Except for possibly the rarest of exceptions, you won't get hurt and you certainly won't get killed. A contested example of a rare exception is a case of renal tubular damage purportedly caused by expired tetracycline (reported by G. W. Frimpter and colleagues in JAMA, 1963;184:111). This outcome (disputed by other scientists) was supposedly caused by a chemical transformation of the active ingredient. Third, studies show that expired drugs may lose some of their potency over time, from as little as 5% or less to 50% or more (though usually much less than the latter). Even 10 years after the "expiration date," most drugs have a good deal of their original potency. So wisdom dictates that if your life does depend on an expired drug, and you must have 100% or so of its original strength, you should probably toss it and get a refill, in accordance with the cliché, "better safe than sorry." If your life does not depend on an expired drug -- such as that for headache, hay fever, or menstrual cramps -- take it and see what happens." <br>  <br>  Thomas A. M. Kramer, MD, Associate Professor of Psychiatry, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois <br>  <br>  <br>  hope that helps =D|`|IZCOuZ7uaa	When a medicine expires, it usually just becomes less effective. In pharmacy terms, when a medication has degraded 10%, it has exceeded its shelf-life and is considered expired. So technically, if you take a med the day it expires, it's only 90% as effective as it was the day it rolled off the line.  Different medications have different expirations, so check the packaging for the expiration date.<br>  There's only one med that I can think of that becomes toxic when it expires and that's tetracycline.|`|cjcjRvKdaa	I agree with PJ--most pills are good for a year.  If you do take a pill that is expired, it will probably not be as effective.  It does depend on the type of drug, though. <br>  <br>  If you're talking about an old partial batch of antibiotics, don't use them.  You need a full fresh supply to rid you of your malady.  A partial (and expired!) dose could make the bacteria come back stronger and be very hard to get rid of.|`|e9JRcA35aa	I don't think that's true. When you take prescription drugs (depending on the type) that are expired it usually has the same as effect as it would if it wasn't, just not near as strong. Pills will not go outdated after a month. You can look on the bottle and find the expiration date.|`|LM4NAZmHaa	I have some pills that I got after surgery 2 years ago and they still work when I need them. I would say that you are more than fine if the pill is only a month old. You will not get sick unless you take more than you should so stick to the amount on the bottle. So yes it is a myth that pills go bad after a month.|`|4l5XhmQvaa	I graduated as a Medical Assistant. However, we went over Medications ... but not in great detail...

Visualize your stress and anxiety flowing like a liquid out of your toes and finger tips and disappearing into the sand. Starting with your feet mentally tell each part of your body to relax, then tell yourself mentally that it has actually relaxed. Having finally got to your face and head go on to instruct your mind to relax. Eventually you will begin to experience the sensation of losing contact with your seat and feel that you are floating. This will come of its own accord and not always. This exercise I would suggest once a day for about 20 minutes.<br>  Every success and enjoy your newly arrived son.
wHdPzovBaa	same with me i havent had my period im 11 and i get discharge to but i dont want to talk to my mom about it either!!! in health class they said 8-16|`|oAH71drxaa	Normal starting age ranges from 9 all the way to 18 but if you've got discharge, pubic hair and boobs then it will probably start in the next couple of years.|`|kmY4uD2Oaa	I had mine at 11. But you can start anywhere Between 11 and 18|`|J0G4lRrNaa	Average age is about 13.<br>  <br>  I got mine when I was 14 though. XD|`|e5VUwaRsaa	The average age in the U.S. is about 12.|`|Fsq9qvkqaa	I think that the average age is around 12. But some girls get it later, some earlier.<br>  Hope this helps :]

You can't imagine how many guys out there have high sex drives and would like to have a girl that craves or urges for sex everyday.|`|JCVs8W6raa	Can I be your sex partner I  am still virgin but will learn this is my E-mail if you want almandalawiahmed@yahoo.com|`|a402885910549caddf0eb474b891f438aa	Its not Abnormal. Everyone is different and some dont have high sex drives.|`|2wMMAKpOaa	Everyone's sex drive is different. No two women are the same. It does seem like yours is higher than a lot though. But that doesn't make you a bad person or anything. And with your bf, just talk to him some more. If you really care about him, then maybe skip sex one day and make him feel like he's more important than that.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps ;)<br>  -MVP|`|Yi9CusAsaa	Honestly it sounds like you have some overactive hormones and if thats the case you should prob get on some birthcontrol... it might level you out. I'm 21 as well and don't get me wrong... I love having sex too haha... esp now.. my bf is amazing=P But we never do it more than 2 to 3 times in a day and its usually not an every day thing... maybe every other... sometimes theres a 2 or 3 days spell where its consistant and then we don't have sex for a week! Its how we are... but seriously... have you ever been on birthcontrol or seen an obgyn and talked about this? You prob should!=]|`|BVokdzL0aa	hello<br>  <br>  i think you in normal , also i think you have a rise in the hormone, also you need move away from some things. For example, sex picture,sex movies,sex story. all these make you feeling you want so much sex every time. my opinion must you talk with him about any thing you feel.
kA7GEKf7aa	Believe it or not, hula hooping is great exercise and good for the abs. I think that maybe 30-60 minutes would be a good amount of time. Also take 2 minute breaks when you're tired.|`|e4ZxaNxKaa	Nope you have to do crunches and sit ups

13k2WKx8aa	When you sneeze, certain muscles in your face tensen up. Apparently in your case this includes the tear ducts. When those muscles tensen up, they tend to do what they were designed to do. Pump some water out.<br>  <br>  There's actually a path that air can take from the nasal cavity up to and through the tear ducts in the eyes. Though perhaps that's a different story for a different day.<br>  <br>  Don't worry. This is in no way unusual. Just bothersome. Perhaps your cold is exacerbating this.<br>  <br>  It's not allergies if your eyes don't feel irritated.|`|0gWxnY0Gaa	You can't make it stop, the same thing happens to me and I've tried everything to stop it.|`|oMj8WAHFaa	you have allergyes i recommend benadryl.|`|eWObKmBSaa	The sinuses are all connected.  Your eyes, nose and mouth and ears.  Be glad that the liquid is coming out and your sinuses are not stopped up.  So, a cold is seen in the eyes, liquid always.  Take some aspirin, drink plenty of water and get plenty of sleep.  It willl be gone before you know it.  take care of self.|`|vm5TgsQwaa	I do this too.I think it's because your squeezing your eyes shut so hard. You can't help it.|`|HgaZ3wMiaa	that's actually ok, it happen to me once. it will go away with Your cold. well that's what happen to me.|`|jSZIgBYGaa	Your eyes water from allergies. They also water to restore the wetness in your eyes that you lose from the how you say "snot" when you sneeze.|`|JvOYhuIbaa	yeah, that happens too me too. this prob dosnt help, but just wanna let u know u r not the only one out there with this problem.|`|62NmYVHMaa	i dont know but i got it once when i was sitting an exam the teachers thought that i was crying over the exam questions lol
ijmcG1ziaa	nope :)<br>  just leave him.|`|ziAuDIcBaa	I knew this one guy who had a similar problem. for privacy's sake we'll call him "Mark". Mark had been running around and playing with one of his friends, o i dunno lets call him "Andy". Andy and Mark were playing when a third person, lets say "Franco" came to tell them about this awesome new game he had learned about. the game was called the silence game, each person couldnt talk but the had to write everything they wanted to say down on paper.<br>  <br>  Franco had piqued Mark and Andy's interest, so the decided to play.<br>  Andy wrote down, "this is some fun game huh?"<br>  Franco wrote, "Yeah we should play this all the time."<br>  Mark wrote, "GUuys I tHinke soMEthineges Rong withe miye"<br>  Franco wrote,"Man you sure are a bad speller mark"<br>  Mark wrote,"GuuYES im NoT a Badd SplelleR i ThInk iM hAavineg sOme soRte of sTrokke"<br>  Andy wrote,"You're funny Mark, come on Franco lets go get something to eat."<br>  <br>  I think you can learn a lesson or two from this story, Mark was never the same again, mainly because he died that day. The moral of the story is, pay attention to signs of health problems...unless your hungry.<br>  <br>  <br>  you should probly check on Will now because you've wasted a lot of valuable time reading my answer|`|AA10850927	No you are not obligated to check on him .. but you say he is a friend so I would. The coughing up blood worrries me and the blood from his ear .. He may have gotten a head injury  or something on that line. If you are a friend please check him and call for help if he is not better.|`|3jFm0rWdaa	I hope "Will" is a hamster.<br>  You need to check on him and call the ambulance braniac.|`|d456069f8e03a8bf7a79de76c7e45228aa	Yes. You will be held accountable if anything has happened to him and you neglected to get him medical help. It just happened recently around here when a young man was at a party, fell down a flight of stairs and everyone thought he was drunk so they picked him up and put him on a couch . . he wasn't drunk he had a concussion and he died. Because the owner of the home failed to get him medical treatment they were held liable for the death . . you are obligated to check on him.|`|5u1G3Qb8aa	haha! Classic!|`|Vk7kkrcLaa	Somehow after reading your other questions I dont believe you!!|`|sjNffqIRaa	Go check up on him!! now|`|7Os9oipBaa	You're joking right?
muHctmaGaa	Haha, what a question. You shouldn't be wearing bras at night, it's not comfortable and not good for your back unless you're really big. Any exercise will only increase the size of your pectoral muscles, giving your breasts a lift but no increase in size. The only artificial means to get permanently larger breasts are implants or hormone treatments.|`|BNAzjSO1aa	No neither will affect the size  of your breasts|`|S1jddreQaa	No and No. Wearing a bra at night won't stop them from growing, and dangling them won't make them bigger. Ha I really wouldn't do that if I were you.|`|l7GjBVvhaa	No. Who ever told you this is making a joke out of you, and it is not funny. <br>  <br>  That is just awful|`|DbVGKvcTaa	No but you can always get implants later.|`|2YHpV9koaa	Nope. Why would you want bigger boobs? I can barely stand my smaller ones!
TAiQxo5paa	Latex condoms have a higher rate of protecting you, while if you used lamb skin condoms you will probably have a bigger chance of contracting it due to the pores of the skin passing it through to your partner. Polyurethane condoms are still being tested for the rate, but it should be close to or about the same as latex ones.<br>  <br>  But yes, condoms are not 100% fool proof. They are close to it, but condoms have a slight chance of breaking and that is when you could catch a disease.|`|HHbyE1dkaa	yes, there's no 100% safe way to avoid them.  but definitely don't have sex if one of you is broken out.|`|OoTScJLPaa	you can get std's in areas not covered by a condom- warts and herpes come to mind immediatley- and it can spread even with a condom- condoms were developed more for birth control than disease transmission.
QjZrg2h4aa	ok first i need yout o calm down im asking the same question on here pretty much lol.i wen to tthe hospital for it and they found nothing wrong with me but DO NOT IGNORE IT.if u can find a watch or a wall clock (not a digital one) count your heart rate for 15 seconds...after that mulitply your heart rate by 4 and if over 140 please take yourself to the hospital.its not normal for your heart rate to go up that high for no reason.take care.|`|TiX5Z4Zbaa	eat low fat food.|`|sDfBDXpXaa	You probably need magnesium.  This will help to regulate the adrenal glands and heart rhythm. <br>  www.shirleys-wellness-cafe.com
EJSdI25Naa	The best and most simple way of handling your situation is just tow wrap the used item in a couple of tissues and put it into the bin. Now, if mother is going to search through used tissues to find out, perhaps you could just inform her. "We are making love."<br>  <br>  You need to consider mother's stand point, too. She has raised her son and she is probably wanting him to get through college. Having sex can be wonderful but that is not what she is concerned about. Having sex also brings along with it enormous responsibilities which must be<br>  considered. It is just not the matter of an unplanned pregnancy but the emotional trauma that can go along with it which would entirely disrupt <br>  his educational programme. Try and study when the world around you is collapsing.-- impossible.<br>  <br>  Of course, you could put the wrapped item in your own bin. I complement you both for not taking the easy way out and flushing it away. That is responsible, so you are off to a good beginning.|`|TAiQxo5paa	You could put it inside an empty bag and throw that bag in the trash, like a finished bag of potato chips, pharmacy bag, shopping bags, etc.<br>  <br>  Either do that or go outside and look for a public trash bin, and throw it outside in a tissue.|`|tB5OuV5Waa	a condom isnt big. tell him to wrap it in a kleenex and throw it away somewhere else.|`|166372a5d474ce786ecc08a423df8b11aa	when you finish with condom don't take off. go to the bathroom with it on and flush it|`|FIALhwlKaa	Put it into a bag and get the stuff to the bin. If your bf doesn′t want it this way he can take it to a bin in the park :D
kulDK5jsaa	lol doubt it.  That's a psychedelic, and typical treatments for schizophrenia would be antipsychotics, which is functionally opposite.  although who knows, i haven't heard of any mahor studies done on the subject|`|OUbNSXjJaa	Any such medicine should be taken only with the prescription of a qualified Doctor. It is harmful to do self medication unless we are qualified.
WPzaF2osaa	You should be evaluated for a possible ankle fracture or torn ankle ligament. Sometimes is better to spend a little be of time and have the right answer from an expert, your friendly MD.
tkDfqjQdaa	Yes you can.  As long as you are not having sexual contact of any kind with clients, you should not run a risk of transmitting the disease to them.|`|DhZ67kgoaa	Why wouldn't you be able to?  It isn't happy ending massages or anything like that.|`|62cf745b22f4e8647a1ae0245414635caa	I don't think that you can, but you can check the state your in.|`|90Pb6eooaa	Of course.  You won't be having sexual contact with you clients.  Atleast not legally, or you won't be an LMT for long, you'll be breaking the law.
AA10958365	Why don't you tell her what you know from experience (unless you don't have your period yet?). Every girl is different, so there's no way for you to predict when she will get it.|`|AA11916244	All girls are different. The fact that she has hair and discharge is a good sign. I myself got my period when i was 9 and then my sister didnt get hers til she was 16. So just tell your sister to be patient and thankfull she doesnt have to put up with it yet.|`|t2W9GGjdaa	If a girl's over weight, it could be even when she's 8.. sometimes it's 14..<br>  <br>  Depends on you, your mom and other ladies in your family.
obHa7Stuaa	Yes. You do need to lock out to "squeeze" the long head. Try decline french press (skull crushers), bring the bar down slowly ( 5-7 count), press up and squeeze your triceps. This should do the trick.

XWb92lglaa	YOU have to work on yourself.No one else will be able to help you (except for maybe a doctor). You need to try to socialize with people BUT it won't work around people who make fun of you. Those are not the type of people you want to hang around. Can you move to some place else? It's horrible to be around people who are mean to you, i know that. I had a very tough time at school. It took me some time to realize that it's not me- it's them who are doing something wrong. I am a little different than the rest, but there's no reason for anyone to be mean to me. Listen, meet new people, I'm sure you're a great person and you'll make lots of friends. If you notice someone laughing at you, don't talk to these people anymore. I don't like people either, i don't understand them and they don't understand me, but we have to coexist :/ Plus i want to find love, and there's no other way of doing it than to meet people. They're not so bad as they seem..good luck|`|ParFJxnSaa	See www.verbalabuse.com Say: "Oooh; someone fell out of bed on the wrong side this morning; looks like they landed flat on their face, too!" Check out: <a href="http://www.geocities.com/freecooljokes/insults1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/freecooljokes/i...</a>  & Google: "humorous insults; list" Memorise a few for each day; never repeat them, once used.). View the information and weblinks for social anxiety/shyness, and self confidence, in sections 9, and 38, at <a href="http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris" rel="nofollow">http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris</a> Here is an exercise that can help you. It is called "Act as If." When you are in a social situation, act as if you are outgoing. Talk more, smile at everyone, ask questions, speak in a normal or excited tone, not a meek tone. Watch some of your outgoing peers, and imitate the style of their social behavior. Research shows that when you "act as if" continually, your image of yourself begins to conform to your new behavior. In this case, you will gain self-esteem and self-confidence, and begin to see yourself as socially normal, not shy. You will become more socially successful, and this will motivate you to continue your new social behavior until it becomes a habit. Try this for a month, in every situation you can. I am confident that you will become much more comfortable and outgoing.<br>  <br>  One form of therapy is to go somewhere that nobody knows you, and deliberately make an utter fool of yourself: put on a paper hat, and yell out: "I'm queen/king of America!", or something else ridiculous, (make up your own - have some fun, safely) then get back in the taxi, (warn the driver of your intentions, first) or car, and leave. People will point, and say: "Look at that idiot". But, you may not be up to the stage where you can do that, yet (I can, and I used to be shy). Or, preferably in the company of a friend, or family member, on a different train, or bus route to your regular one, call out the names, or numbers of all the stops. It will teach you that, although it isn't actually pleasant, (EXPECT MODERATE DISCOMFORT) you will survive; be stronger for the experience, and the next time (should you need to repeat this type of therapy) will be considerably easier. Remember: "A fear avoided is a fear strengthened; a fear faced is a fear reduced." Regard it as your final test: once you have accomplished it, the barrier will be broken; just don't go too far, the other way! Learn to laugh at yourself, and give a big, cheesy grin when others see you do something foolish, as we all do, occasionally.<br>  <br>  It is endearing, if you don't do it too often. Use positive affirmations: for example: "I am very likable and other people feel comfortable around me". Write down all of your self limiting beliefs; then write down the positive counter of them, (exact opposite) and repeat them and imprint them into your mind. Most importantly: Force yourself to approach somebody and initiate some sort of communication. Start out small by asking the time and directions and gradually go bigger. Although there are anti-anxiety medications (anxiolytics) available, these come with risks, and the possibility of side effects, habituation, even addiction, and withdrawal problems, and are unsuitable for young people. <br>  <br>  Try having a cup of "Tension Tamer", herbal tea, by Celestial Seasonings, (from supermarket tea, or health food aisles) or make some at home, and cool, then bottle, and drink as needed (I find it so strong tasting, that I need to drink it quickly, followed by something like fruit juice, to take away the taste, but others may find it more tolerable). C(h)amomile tea is a more palatable option. As with all herbal/green teas, use lemon/lime, and/or a little sweetener (NOT ARTIFICIAL!!!) but no cream, or milk. Xylitol, or Stevia is preferable, (health food stores) or fruit sugar (fructose, such as "Fruisana", from supermarket sugar aisles).|`|ae0e9c023d5f99fb81b9436f0becc392aa	You need to ask yourself- why am I so afraid? What are the specific reasons that are stopping me from going into the kitchen right now? If it is because people are laughing or making fun of you, then that is straight up bullying. It's not right and is not your fault- find some nicer people to be friendly with. If you aren't sure why, then why not just give it a try? See what happens and then think about how it made you feel. Social anxiety such as this is quite common. Believe it or not, no-one is as outwardly confident as they seem- we all have our insecurities. Good luck with getting through this, and if you find you are not making any progress then go and speak to your GP and they will understand. xx|`|9lmTVu20aa	I suffer from exactly the same thing. <br>  I am 24 and have only just begun meeting people and socialising.<br>  Did someone in your past used to tease you/make fun of you?<br>  To be honest, the best thing to do would be to go and see your doctor, and go from there.<br>  <br>  Good luck with everything, one day you will look back on these days and feel so happy that you aren't here anymore.|`|NB42ZXSKaa	Social anxiety, i suffered with this for years. But one day decided that I shouldnt have to feel anxious all the time around people.|`|wTy2p2wPaa	Your like me, But I'm not as bad of a situation as you. I can't talk around my friends if I'm sleeping at their houses because I'm too scared because i think they only invited me to make a fool out of me, i can't even talk to my best friend outside of school - only on msn myspace or in school.<br>  But now i can I've made vast improvment.<br>  If I'm meeting a new person I'll get so chickened out I'll make excuses that i can't go because I'm going my dads etc.etc.<br>  If my mums best mate comes over i feel closed in so i feel like i can't say anything or if i say something they'll all be like :/ uh shut up.<br>  We're always making a fool of ourselves so I've learnt to speak up more and get my feelings across.<br>  Don't worry alot of people actually suffer from social anxiety. As long as you have a family member or a friend that you can talk to and share your feelings with you'll get over this and if not you can see a doctor and see what he/she has to say ok.<br>  <br>  <br>  Be strong and don't worry.|`|TyqudPsgaa	basically life is a momentary thing whatever it is, death will come and then all is over, so tangling yourself up with all this is a waste of your time. obviously your mind is plagued so its hard to escape from and i know what a bastard the mind can be.

I tried lots of different ways to get over this but the thing that actualy worked for me was I chose a role model and when I felt realy anxious I emulated them.  Many people will disagree with this and say you should be yourself, but if you don't know how to be yourself then you can think how your rolemodel would handle the situation.  It's not pretending it can actualy make you feel good about yourself.  It is an actual technique used by life coaches.  Go on to videojug.com and look up "be your own hero".  Good luck.

3sriJtSkaa	you absolutely, definitely 100% MUST go to the doctor for that and here is why.<br>  <br>  1. the hole is there because you had some sort of infection that your body was trying to fight off ad a byproduct of that "battle" is the pus that filled the abscess that is now draining. <br>  2. the infection may not be serious and they may just clean and pack the wound and make sure it heals ok. <br>  3. the infection COULD BE SERIOUS. <br>  4. consider the fact that your "tailbone" is a oft fogotten part of your spine. the health of your but crack may not seem all that important but consider the fact that it's actually your spine. infection very near bone is definitely not good especially if there's ANY chance that you damaged that bone during your snowboard fall. <br>  5. no matter what they do, it probably won't be super awesome to go to the doctor and show them your butt, but I gaurantee you that it will be waaaaaaaaay worse if it's in any way serious and you neglect it and let it worsen. <br>  <br>  go to the doctor buddy. seriously. it's not that bad and you'll be fine in a few days. The possible risks associated with letting it fester are quite a lot worse than just sucking it up and having it treated.
XS5CfmAMaa	Ok, if you've got them already, you got them. I'll tell you in a moment what you need for them, but first:<br>  <br>  ***You are putting your eyes in extreme danger by wearing contacts not prescribed to you by a doctor.*****<br>  <br>  Why?  Because contacts come in many many different curves.   Even if they don't have a prescription, you still need a doctor to prescribe the right curve.    Imagine your eye is round like a basketball.   Your doctor has a machine that matches that curve to a contact that has the same curve.  Now imagine your eye was oval, like an American football.  Would that round contact sit on the tip of the football well? No, it would touch in the middle, but not on the edges.  It would rub that pointy part of your eye every time you blinked, damaging your eye.  The opposite is also true.  If you got a contact for a football shaped eye and put it on very round eye, the edges would rub but not the center.  You would be putting all the pressure on the edges of your eye.<br>  <br>  What does it feel like when you have the wrong curve on your eye? Like sand that never leaves, even when you take the contact out.  That is because you've worn off the cells on your cornea that the contact was pressing against.  Do you really want to do that to yourself and end up in the emergency room with a red infected eye just to change your eye color?<br>  <br>  Ok, lecture over.  If you are going to get them anyways, at least do this.  Get a contact lens case and contact lens cleaning solution from a drugstore.  Many brands include the storage cases with the solution.  Never sleep in them, ever, for any reason. See the reason above.  Clean them everytime you use them. Never forget.  And do not post a question here asking "why is my eye burning so badly and seem infected?" a week from now.  :)|`|bmhnXEsVaa	1) Storage case. Usually has individual left/right eye space for each contact.<br>  2) Cleaning/storage/disinfecting solution.<br>  Always remember to wash your hands before handling them, & lean over a counter or something to catch them if they fall!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.allaboutvision.com/contacts/contact_lenses.htm#wearandcare" rel="nofollow">http://www.allaboutvision.com/contacts/c...</a>

The biggest culprit in our society is most of our foods are full of sugar and/or white flour. I have some info on a Fitness blog and hope it will help direct you to this end. I have just posted 10 ways to increase your metabolism w/o diet. But in a brief overview for proper eating:<br>  <br>  1: Eat foods rich in protein, basically my suggestion is to have 30 to 40% of your calories from protein.<br>  <br>  2: 40 to 45% complex and fiberous carbs. Eat your complex carbs prior to 2:00 in the afternoon, then only fiberous carbs therafter.<br>  <br>  3: Balance of calories from non-saturated fats<br>  <br>  4: Start an exercise program, you don't have to train for a marathon and be sure to check with your Doctor before any routine is started, but there are many programs from walking to training @ Home to Training @ the gym which are available from many sources, including us.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps get you started on the road to Fitness, Warren Honeycutt|`|b0vq1CDLaa	Try eating 30 % good Fats ( not fried crap and stuff , but nuts and olive oil and fish), 30% Protein ( leanish meats, fish and beans), and 40% good Carbs ( less sugar, and white flour , more whole grains).<br>  <br>  Use a free site like Fitday.com and to keep track of how much you eat a day, of what you eat, and how many calories you burn (its easy to use). just eat a total number of calories A Little less than the Amount you use a day and you'll lose. <br>  <br>  Good luck and dont you dare try to lose weight fast. If you do i promise youll gain it all back, and set your self up with bad eating habits for the rest of your life.<br>  <br>  Good luck .

BD0L3JcHaa	I tried Proactive. It didn't work for me to be honest. Other people have said that it worked, but I guess it just depends what kind of skin and acne you have. My skin sounds a lot like yours oily on the forehead and dry around the cheeks and chin. Based on that I doubt it will work for you. I think you should go to the dermatologist and see what they think. And also Proactive's only side effect that I noticed was very dry skin. When I went to the dermatologist they prescribed me with Differin. They told me it would take about a month to see any improvement and I did, but it made my skin soooo dry.  And once my face started to clear up a little bit, it just came back.  And it's not like I stopped taking Differin I was still using it regularly it just doesn't seem to keep acne away.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|IsOF3A62aa	Could work for you. But one negative effect is that it makes your skin worse when you start using it which sucks. What I would do is go see your doctor, that way they will know exactly what will help your skin the most.

qGiFTnC2aa	Hey Erin :) Well, for a start, you're not that heavy so you don't have pounds and pounds to lose which is great. If you make a few changes you'll get fitter, look better and you won't have the hard work of someone who weighs 180.<br>  <br>  At your age you shouldn't restrict your eating too much.  Switch to mainly drinking water - not juice, soda, milk etc (but make sure you're getting enough calcium). Eat lots of fresh stuff, not too much junk but you can have a bit.<br>  <br>  The thing that makes the biggest difference to your body shape is exercise.  Find something you might enjoy, or at least tolerate. Running will give you the fastest and most dramatic changes to your body. If you can't run then put on your ipod with some fast songs, go for a quick walk and every now and then jog or run for a little bit, then go back to walking.  Cycling, swimming, dance, aerobics classes etc are all good.  You can even step up and down on a step or book or whatever in front of the TV.<br>  <br>  Squats, lunges, crunches, push ups etc are all great and you can do them while watching TV.

VtJ5kRgIaa	nothing to worry about.. i just had mine out wednesday (feb. 18) they knock you out and you basically just sleep the rest of the day. all four of my teeth were impacted (hadn't come through my gums yet so they had to dig for them) but its really not that bad. i was wicked nervous but its fine i just have chipmunk cheeks right now lol|`|vgWtWmXxaa	I got my wisdom teeth out this morning. It was insane. They made me put my hair into one of those medical blue caps. They put some needle into my arm. They hooked up all these buttons to my body. And they they put an oxygen piece into my nose. But.. after a while before the surgery, they give you the anesthesia.. and slowly things start to get blurry and the next thing you know.. you make up towards the end of the surgery. When you get up, you're disoriented and need help walking. Your face is all numb and and feel like death! When I got home today.. I took some medication after drinking and eating soup.. and a minute later.. I puked it all out! I replaced the gauze they put in my mouth because they were too bloody.. and the I started noticing the pain! They drilled my jaw bone because something was wrong.. and now I have like some piece of friggin' bone fragment popping out of gums nowhere near the extraction areas. I've been taking pain killers.. so the pain isn't so bad right now.. But you're not even allowed to SPIT! You have to swallow all your blood and saliva. I've got a sore throat and I'm miserable.|`|032fe62efcbf6d35167e89c01d4426f2aa	I actually had mine out in two stages, left-side wisdom teeth first, then the right-side ones about a month later.<br>  The actual removal was no big deal, since he numbed my mouth beforehand.  But after the first set, I was in miserable pain for about 2-3 days, then discomfort for a week more.<br>  The second time (yes, I went back) he gave me heavy-duty painkillers, but I didn't even need them.  I just felt a little sore for a few days.<br>  So I guess it all depends on how easily the particular tooth comes out, and whether the oral surgeon has to really "dig" to get them out.  <br>  Hopefully yours will come out more easily than mine!
SFba2RUPaa	Lots of things can masquerade as the stomach virus.If this really is the bug like everyone else you are doing the right things by resting and by taking in mostly fluids,Gatorade is fine.Don't drink a great deal at one time but rather sip on a glassful and make it last.An old fashioned but good remedy is regular Coke(not Diet) sipped slowly as above.The syrup used in Coke is like an old medicine for nausea called Emetrol and it really works.Remember if you barf this up it will be dark and some have mistaken this for blood.Try to wait about eating til you feel hungry and then eat starchy food like crackers,baked potato,etc. but only a little bit at a time.I bet you will be better by tomorrow-a bit shaky perhaps but better.Good luck  and I hope you are well enough to play and do well tomorrow!|`|o1yy6KABaa	Drink plenty of water to flush it out of your system, the sodas wont work to get rid of it they simply make you feel better and mask the problem.

Exercise is always good and it's important to stay active but if when you get done you still binge eat or eat excessively then of course it will be more difficult to lose the weight you want to. The best way to lose weight is to control your appetite and the best way to do that that I know of is with hoodia. When I was dieting (and believe me I still watch my weight even though I have achieved my weight loss goals for the most part) I realized right off that the most important thing is to control your appetite. If your stomach's not always growling and your not always craving food it is sooo much easier to stick to your guns and stay on your diet. With hoodia I would literally go a whole day sometimes and simply forget to eat and I didn't get tired and run down like diets can sometimes make you feel. Once my appetite was under control and I wasn't always thinking about eating then and only then could the weight start coming off consistently and steadily because the hoodia kept my mind off of food and I would go longer on my diet and as I did that naturally I lost weight. You have to remember that consistency is very important when losing weight. If you cut back a little on your food consumption everyday your body will change (stomach will shrink and you won't be eating as much) and with that consistency over a few days, weeks and months you will lose weight just like I did. Desert Burn Hoodia was my saving grace for all of these factors. Here's a site that inspired me and taught me a lot of dieting and nutritional tips that I still use today. All my best to you and keep your chin up.  GOOGLE: online health desert burn hoodia : for more help and info.
q1YDp1y3aa	No, DID is never caused by a chemical imbalance. Even in diseases that may be organic in nature- such as schizophrenia, there is ZERO evidence for a chemical imbalance in the brain. In those cases, the drug companys noticed that certain chemicals changed a persons behavior for the better, and then theorized that it must be because the brain was chemically unbalanced, and the the drugs "fixed" it. Noone has ever actually tested mentally ill people to see if such a brain chemical imbalance exists, its all theories. For the record, most toddlers behave better if you dose them with benadryl, but i don't think they have chemical imbalance that benadryl corrects. For more on medicatins, read robert Whittaker's "Mad in America" and anything by Peter Breggin. <br>  <br>  Back to DID, it is well established that DID is caused by childhood trauma- not always abuse, but very traumatic events. for more info on DID try these resources-<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.isst-d.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.isst-d.org/</a><br>  <a href="http://sidran.org/" rel="nofollow">http://sidran.org/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.sho.com/site/video/brightcove..." rel="nofollow">http://www.sho.com/site/video/brightcove...</a> (this is part of a promo for a TV show about DID, but the doctor in this documentary is an expert on DID and gives excellent info)<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociativ..." rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociativ...</a> (not an acceptable source for papers, but follow the footnotes to journal articles that are GREAT, and acceptable for use)|`|3rq39Pgmaa	Ok first if you are writing a book over this, I suggest not relying on "answers" for you information, because people will say anything about anything. But yes it is caused by a chemical inbalance and thus why medication is essential.

But the strongest correlation suggest that the main cause is repetitive traumatic childhood events over a long period of time. (continued chilhood physical or sexual abuse).

MhpccWpmaa	It could definitely be a yeast infection.  You will have to go to the doctors to be sure since you've never had one before.  They will probably prescribe you a pill called Diflucan which is a pill you only take once.  It can take up to a week to fully knock the infection out of your body but it works really well.  If you don't want to go to the doctors yet you can try buying some over the counter medicine such as monistat and see if that clears it up for you.  But I would advise going to the doctors just so you can be properly diagnosed

a454ee46524abf792eec0686abd82584aa	There are a bunch of sick perverts out there who get thrills out of circumcision, either their own or on someone else, particularly someone young and attractive. They have a sites like Circlist which has a public pseudo-scientific face promoting circumcision and a private forum, where they swap sick stories about circumcisions. Some of them are known to be doctors. <br>  The only possible reason a person would offer you this sort of money to get circumcised is if they and the audience are circum-fetish perverts. You are being offered money to be surgically raped. <br>  Part of their sick fantasy is sometimes the pain. The pain from a circumcision is greater than a similar length incision in the abdomen. Some Australian aboriginals still do this without anesthetic and I will never forget the screams of a young boy being circumcised, I saw as a teen in a Leyland Brothers film in the 70s. I don't think you would ever recover mentally from the trauma of that sort of pain. I am also sure the perverted surgeon will not be doing it as quickly as possible. The mental and physical damage you will incur is not worth that money.<br>  Also those perverts are very into "high and tight" circumcisions leaving the penis with no movable skin at all. They often have "revision' circumcisions to get it tighter again if the skin stretches. So you are likely to have much less skin left than with a normal surgeon.<br>  Adult males lose 15 square inches (40 square centimetres) of skin in circumcision, over half the skin of your penis. You lose the gliding action as it slides on itself during masturbation and sex. You will suffer bruising, perhaps some bleeding, and the swelling from the disruption to the lymph system goes on for up to six months. Removing the foreskin turns the surface of the glans from an inner mucosal membrane to outside skin. Newly circumcised adults usually go through some weeks of intense discomfort as the glans is constantly exposed to rubbing on clothing, until it develops a thicker keratin layer and becomes less sensitive. You must abstain from ALL sexual activity for an average of six weeks. Some men like the final result but others complain of loss of sensation and miss being able to slide their foreskin over the glans. Circumcised guys often have little or no movable skin left and are forced to masturbate using lube or rubbing dry, without the loose skin. There is no going back if you don’t like the result.<br>  A recent study has shown real differences in fine touch sensitivity between circumcised and intact penises and that the most sensitive parts of the intact penis are those that would be removed by circumcision.<br>  I am circumcised myself and have resented it deeply ever since I saw a friend masturbate with his skin when I was about 12. Many older circumcised men notice a loss of sensation because they have less to start off with. Many women who get to interact sexually with an intact penis prefer the natural state.<br>  Stay away from these sickos. I am sure if you go through with this you will regret it the rest of your life.<br>  Geoff|`|TsjqzanQaa	There are indeed circumfetishists, who get some sort of sick pleasure out of watching mutilation of the male penis.<br>  <br>  I was a victim of male genital mutilation as a helpless infant, and suffered more than the usual loss (50-75%) of sexual sensitivity.      This made it impossible for me to achieve orgasm in normal sex.<br>  <br>  I finally found out about foreskin restoration, and this has vastly improved my sensitivity and function, and also has increased the intensity of orgasm, as well.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't give up my new foreskin for ten million dollars, and the penis butchers will never get another chance to mutilate me!<br>  <br>  It's so incredibly much better with a foreskin, the way that nature intended.      The inner foreskin has an exquisite sensitivity, actually more than the glans, and adds a new dimension to shaft sensitivity.<br>  <br>  Do whatever you want, you sound old enough to make up your mind, but be aware of what you may have done to yourself.<br>  <br>  Circumcised males are more susceptible to HIV and other infections.     Recent discoveries show that the foreskin has Langerhans cells, which have antiviral and antibacterial properties.       The HIV rate in the USA is much higher than in other countries in Asia, South America, Europe and Scandinavia where males are rarely mutilated.<br>  <br>  Look at the site CIRCUMSTITIONS, and you will see some of the adverse effects and complications that result from male genital mutilation.      The doctors do not disclose these, and in fact suppress them so as not to discourage anyone from perpetrating this mutilation on themselves or their sons.<br>  <br>  Circumcision is the worst hoax ever perpetrated on the male sex.<br>  <br>  A foreskin is not a birth defect; it is a birthright.<br>  <br>  ERIC|`|K4zsztkRaa	Get off the computer.<br>  <br>  -Connor|`|i6RlYFo7aa	how about, no<br>  <br>  it will be very painful, 10,000 is very tempting but I have a feeling you may regret it, circumcision now would not make your penis smaller|`|CNW6eAjoaa	My response would be to get out of there real quick.  This sounds like a bunch of guys who have put up some money to watch a male be mutilated.  This is the wrong thing to do.  They sound like circumsexuals who will get off on your pain and what the 'doctor' is doing to you.  How do you know this guy is a real doctor?<br>  The idea of doing it without anesthetic is horrendous.  I was circumcised as a child, for no good reason, by a doctor who pushed my mother into consenting.  He believed the pain would be character building, and so did not use pain reduction of any sort.  The searing agony of having the knife slice through the living foreskin will remain with me forever.  I cannot imagine anyone volunteering to do this for any amount of money.  I can tell you the pain will be off the scale, and the guys watching will be enjoying it.  <br>  This 'doctor' who is 'waiving his fee' sets off alarm bells in my head.  Of course he is waiving his fee because what he is doing is an act of perversion.  He will not be quick.  You have to know that if he is cutting without anesthetic for a 'male audience', he will drag this thing out, and make the pain last as long as possible.  That is what the 'male audience' has paid to see.  What kind of 'arena' is the setting for this atrocity?  You can bet it will not be a hospital operating room, but more a room in someone's basement, where no one can hear you scream.  What kind of follow up care will you get?  None,...because you will be out on the street and your 'doctor' will vanish.  He may have 'told' you he has performed lots of circumcisions before, but this is not an accredited way of operating a medical practice. If he is a doctor, he could lose his license for this. Think of the mutilated penis you will be left with.  Read about the reason and function of the foreskin, and see what a benefit it is.  I am restoring mine now.  I cannot believe what a change for the better it is to have the level of coverage I have to date.  I still have two years to go.<br>  Do not submit to this procedure.  It will not be worth it, no matter what the money is.  Report this to the police!!!|`|SltEwVX7aa	Dude, that's gonna hurt  SO much.  I can't believe they're gonna do it without anesthetic!  Is this some kind of ritual thing someone's doing?  It's not the cut that's gonna hurt so bad as putting in stitches, if they're gonna do that. <br>  <br>  You won't loose any penis size.  <br>  <br>  And yes, jerking it is a way different game.  You'll get the hang of it, but it's like beginning all over again.<br>  <br>  But, 10K IS tough to pass up.

You may need to, to shake yourself free from this!<br>  <br>  Me! :- l|`|zEy0uuAFaa	In addition to all the negatives of losing about 14 square inches of your penis forever, the people making this offer to you seem major scary.  They're paying you to mutilate yourself with a maximum of suffering and pain for their amusement.  I suggest you run, not walk, away from this proposition.  God only knows what they would do to you when you're in their power, away from the protection of the public eye.|`|b4e9fa4dc7294d8b1a86d0fcb130e389aa	If this is a serious question: Don't do it!!! Firstly, circumcision is just, well, stupid unless medically necessary. You obviously know the benefits of being intact so why would you even consider it? You could bleed to death. There are many complications that could occur. Doing it without anesthetic is just purely idiotic in itself.|`|irIk1saFaa	I wouldn't do it, but It's your decision.  The thought of them cutting skin off my dick makes my blood curdle.   I think I have already been circumcised, but I'm not sure (only 16, haven't asked parents b/c would be awkward).  Jerking still feels good cut.  Again, your choice, but I wouldn't.|`|AA11522944	Why on earth would someone want to do that and why on earth would you consider it???<br>  <br>  If you have a natural, intact penis... keep it that way.<br>  <br>  All you will prove is how inhumane and cruel infant circumcision is and I'm not sure that you need to get cut to prove that.|`|0eed9c0d5321fb5386d80251ae138fb0aa	I would and could pay a lot more than $10,000 to get my foreskin back!

You could restore it later on down the road, but you'll never get back what you had to begin with, too much is lost as it's an irreversible procedure. Of course you wouldn't lose length in your penis. but girth/thickness most definitely as the foreskin makes up 4/5 of penile skin. The fact that someone is paying or willing to pay you to do is is just sickening, and highly questionable, it sounds as if they may even get off from cutting guys and making them feel pain. Leave your foreskin alone, you only get one. I don't like using this tone, but at least you have a foreskin, some of us had no choice and we will never fully know the wonderful and natural gift that it is. <br>  <br>  As for sources, the first link shows you what wonderful things the foreskin has in store. The second link is what you will lose in this process that will never come back. It's not worth it man, tell whoever it is to shove it, and how can you make sure that you'll even get the money? Besides there's too many complications and death is possible.<br>  <br>  -KH|`|vsaaaSsAaa	Do NOT do it.  This doctor sounds like a quack.  <br>  <br>  You can actually lose A LOT of blood during a circumcision.  In addition, you have to have really good post-op care, as this can easily become infected... then you will have quite a mess on your hands!  <br>  <br>  Plus, have you ever seen a baby get a circumcision--- it is very painful!|`|49e85318c9941fa15c6f9d7c5ebe910daa	Under no circumstances should you go through with this. What's wrong with people? Is this for the satisfaction of someone's sick fetish? You couldn't pay me enough to ever part with a healthy part of my body, especially my genitals. Stay away from these sick people, especially this doctor. He is one sick puppy.|`|5iSBOcg3aa	You'd be crazy to even THINK about it. It WILL be painful and it WILL bleed a lot and you'll FOREVER be without foreskin!  Just who would even make an offer like that? It's CRAZY!  I SAY NO!|`|u15hauUCaa	Do /NOT/ do it under /ANY/ circumstances.<br>  <br>  Altering yourself may affect sexual pleasure, and the pain you experience will be like nothing you can comprehend.|`|Kj5BeF7Aaa	its gonna hurt like hell and the surgeon should use anesthetic because ur gonna cry like a little girl|`|5kBM0z1maa	Please assure me that the fellow offering you ten grand to watch you squirm in pain, as your foreskin is sliced from your penis, isn't from Phoenix, AZ.     Phoenix does have a crazy fellow (who is intact, by the way) who has spent the balance of his life trying to get back at the kids who teased him in elementary school for being intact.   Somehow that childhood trauma was transformed into seeing genital mutilation as a highly erotic procedure.  Today he advertises semi-public masturbatory circumcisions, almost as a game.  He masturbates while you get cut.  Either way, you lose.  <br>  <br>  He is, however, not an urologist, but an ordinary nurse.  I wouldn't put it past him to offer money to some poor slob.   Are you that person?<br>  <br>  Where did you meet this guy? At one of the circumcision fetishistic sites, such as Circumsexual, or Circlist?     <br>  <br>  I hate to be so blunt, but you don't need 10,000 bucks, you need just enough money to see a shrink.
ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.<br>  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which<br>  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow<br>  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without<br>  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For<br>  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food<br>  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on<br>  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If<br>  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey<br>  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your<br>  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to<br>  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,<br>  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the<br>  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a<br>  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,<br>  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target<br>  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a<br>  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you<br>  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).<br>  Fruit is good, it will stop your cravings for sweets, too.|`|gwUMipsUaa	You won't.

DtG4zpM2aa	Sometimes there can be individual variations in an ECG that can look like the changes associated with various conditions including heart attacks.  ECG machines sometimes offer their own interpretation of the result, such as 'anteroseptal infarct', but the machines aren't always right, and a good doctor should always consider the complete picture - ie the patient's condition and other test results also - rather than just looking at one type of result.   <br>  <br>  Blood tests would show if you'd had a recent heart attack.  There is a marker called troponin which is often checked in a patient who has had chest pain or where there is something else that would suggest the possibility of a heart attack, and the levels of this are always raised after there is damage to the heart muscle (such as occurs in an infarct) - the level reaches a peak after 12 hours after the heart attack and remains raised for several weeks.   <br>  <br>  Also the echo would show clearly if you'd had a heart attack as the appearance and functioning of the heart is looked at in detail.<br>  <br>  Without being involved in your care, I couldn't say for certain, but it sounds very much like the changes in your ECG are just an individual variation rather than anything to worry about, and your doctors have obviously investigated things thoroughly, so I'd try not to worry about it, since you've been given the all-clear from the further tests you've had.|`|0oOx1p5daa	so you are asking for a differential diagnosis when you have already been discharged. are you experiencing any of the original symptoms?? if you are then go to your gp.

c490676d02a8b133e7a6143969ba0116aa	I first have to say that I am so sorry for your loss. I miscarried last month, after my first successful IVF cycle and know the hurt. It was a fresh IVF cycle and from that cycle I was able to freeze embryos. I will be doing a FET and worried about the same thing. I asked my RE about the odds of my frozen embryos having a chromosomal abnormality (The cause of my miscarriage) and he said the chance was extremely slim. You got a healthy child out of those embryos and you will get another!<br>  <br>  I've been in this game for a long time and have known a lot of women who miscarried after a transfer and then used that same group of embryos that were frozen for a FET who went on to have healthy pregnancies. I have also know women who transferred poor grade embryos go on to have a healthy pregnancy. I have a good friend who had a bad cycle, transferred the 3 poor quality embryos she got, and is now pregnant with healthy twins. This process is amazing isn't it? I feel so blessed that we have doctors who have helped many women!<br>  <br>  You can talk about this whole process about FET's and even join and meet a group at great women at fertilethoughts.com <a href="http://www3.fertilethoughts.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=25" rel="nofollow">http://www3.fertilethoughts.com/forums/f...</a> It is a great place to rant and rave and meet some who have been in your shoes!<br>  <br>  I wish you much luck!
5s3uFazlaa	if you are thin, it explains both.  Breasts are mostly fat, since you are skinny, you don't have much fat, thus the small breasts.  Also, you are probably young still.  You can get your period all the way up until you are around 17.  Don't force your period to come or your body to grow quickly, you have to let it occur naturally.  Besides, eating more is not going to induce you getting your period and it will only make you gain fat around you stomach before your breasts.  Thus, small breasts are a good thing!! and with your period, just think of it as time that you don't have to deal with cramps and other things associated with your period.|`|tP4Bx4OWaa	Consult a Dr if you are aged 17 or more, otherwise nature will take its course.|`|0kXlNWcMaa	from the way yo spelled brest (it's breast) I'm guessing you're really young.<br>  so my advice for you is to be patient and wait for them.<br>  they'll come when they are ready.<br>  there's no way to make them come faster.

0nyWiro9aa	That means the average size of the red cell is larger than normal (mean corpuscular volume) and thus the larger the cell the more hemoglobin they would contain on average (Mean corpuscular hemoglobin).<br>  <br>  Nutritional deficiencies such as folate and B12 from a variety of causes, thyroid condition, liver disease can all yield such type of red cells. The next step would look for other clues in the blood smear such as large oval shaped red cells which points more towards nutritional deficiencies versus the large round cells of liver disease. The other clue one would look for are hypersegmented white cells which are white cells with many lobes of the nucleus and these are seen in nutritional deficiencies. One might search for target shaped red cells seen in liver disease.<br>  <br>  These are just general basic clues on what it might mean. Any specifics need to come from your doctor.

This could exacerbate the wound and make it take longer to heal.  Now applying pressure is the best bet.  As much pressure as possible and the bleeding WILL stop.

Xl82sK4haa	You need to have a break once in a while like this article says...<br>  <br>  "Think of you on a diet like a pressure cooker on a burner. The longer you keep that pot on the heat, the more the steam pressure builds up inside. If there’s no outlet or release valve on that thing, eventually the pressure builds up so much that even if it’s made of steel and the lid is bolted down, she’s gonna blow, sooner or later.<br>  <br>  Well, in the beginning, you might think your willpower is made of steel and that you’re bolted tighter than a submarine hatch, but the longer you’re on a diet with no relief, the greater the pressure builds up until YOU blow your top… and that means massive binge eating.<br>  <br>  But if you let off a little steam in the form of a “free meal” (or two) and enjoy that slice of pizza (or whatever is your favorite ‘poison’) on occasion, that relieves the pressure. Alas, you never even feel the urge to binge… because you HAD your pizza and the urge was satisfied. Since the meal was planned and you kept the calories under control, it had little or no effect on your fat loss results."

MJR4Om7taa	For endurance I would say possibly kickboxing and for discipline: Aikido or Karate (Wado Ryu?). For the strongest balance of the two? I'm not sure; maybe something like Wing Chun is what you are after?<br>  <br>  Personally I'm a big fan of capoeira but I'm not sure that’s what you are after<br>  <br>  Maybe look into Wing Chun?<br>  <br>  EDIT: On second thoughts Wing Chuns approach doesn't lean too much on endurance (as you should have won before you get a stitch) so maybe look instead at Mok-Gar?<br>  <br>  It really is one of those things though where you should look into them all yourself and decide which you think best suits you. How well they lean to each strength in comparison to another is a subjective opinion. Have a look at them all and decide where you think you'd like to go :-)<br>  <br>  <br>  ADITIONAL EDIT:<br>  Figured I'd explain why I thought of Karate as a good one for discipline (I'm bored)<br>  Karate’s motto is never strike the first blow, and this also holds true in its sporting competitions, often the fighters at first will not attack but entice their opponent to attack them, they will come close but not attack. The reason for this is not just moral etiquette but because you can do a more devastating counter-attack then you can an initial attack by turning your opponents strength and energy on themselves. That in my opinion takes a lot more discipline then to simply attack (and karate also has many other aspects of strong discipline, that is but one example) BUT Karate is not so much endurance based as many, more technique, speed and strength (in that order) and that is what I mean by having to find your own balance, would you be willing to give up more endurance for discipline like that? If so look at Wado Ryu. Aikido is also good for discipline as I mentioned<br>  <br>  On the other end of the scale is kickboxing of course. (No dis-respect to kick boxing I might add as it did look like that, I myself am a former kick boxer)<br>  <br>  I still hold true my preference for capoeira but I also still don't think that’s what you are after. It really is something you should discover for yourself, it's a bit like a life-style choice in a way. The different arts have different philosophies and founding attitudes, so maybee you should look at that side to see which suits you, afterall, all the arts will give you endurance and discipline at some level anyway<br>  <br>  <br>  After all that waffle....<br>  <br>  Mok-Gar?|`|FeEAD468aa	Taekwondo is good (:

GvQHw4Ntaa	Some women notice right away, before they even miss their period, and in some women the symptoms aren't as apparent. The very first symptom, I'd say, is just feeling different than usual before your period comes. For example, if you usually have PMS symptoms and sore breasts, but they aren't sore, that could be a very early symptom of pregnancy. Likewise, if you usually don't experience premenstrual breast tenderness but have sore breasts this month, that could be an early symptom. Feeling tired for no explainable reason is also one of the first symptoms.. you produce a lot of extra blood just the first couple of weeks you're pregnant and that can cause fatigue. <br>  <br>  Implantation bleeding, if you experience it or notice it, can perhaps be the earliest sign of pregnancy. <br>  <br>  The best known pregnancy symptoms, such as morning sickness and frequent urination aren't apparent until later in the pregnancy, usually at least 7 to 8 weeks.

pa7hVLAHaa	Often people who self-diagnose ADD/ADHD are really suffering from some sort of focus or concentration problem.  95% of the time this could be do to poor diet and/or lack of specific nutrients.  <br>  <br>  If I were you I'd take a good look at what I am eating on a daily basis.  How often do you eat fast food?  How much sugar do you consume?  Next I'd make changes in my diet.  I'd begin to eat only what nature intended: whole vegetables, nuts, tubers, grains, meat, legumes, fruit.  I'd become more aware of additives put in food to give them a longer shelf life and what effects these preservatives have on my body and mental capacity. <br>  <br>  I'd wonder if maybe I had a food sensitivity/allergy which put my immune system in a chronic heightened state.  I'd keep a food diary and note the foods I ate every day and try to correlate that with the subsequent symptoms I experience.  I'd then eliminate the suspected food from my diet and see if it helped.  <br>  <br>  Next I'd supplement my diet with nutrients that have been shown to help with ADD/concentration symptoms: Essential fatty acids (omega 3s/omega 6s), B vitamins, Vitamin C, chromium, digestive enzymes.<br>  <br>  I can honestly say that this works, because I experienced this and I solved my problem.

Take out the jewelry you have in and downsize. if you don't have 000 jewelry, go back down to the 00s you had in.<br>  <br>  the next step is: GO TO A PIERCER. have them look at your ears to make sure that you haven't done any severe tissue damage. tissue damage can affect your ability to stretch in the future and also affect your ears' ability to shrink back down if/when you decide to let them shrink again.<br>  <br>  Let your ears heal. it would be a good idea for you to wait at least four months before trying to stretch again, longer if you blew your ears out.<br>  <br>  <br>  Ice and ibuprofen for pain and swelling.<br>  <br>  sea salt soaks for healing (1/4 teaspoon sea salt per 8 oz of water)|`|orMWTxYOaa	well you just stretched it alot so its probly going to hurt and get irritated at least a  little. give it time and keep it clean maybe put some ice on it
fBFNCS1Naa	Sometimes when you are stressed, sick, or really busy your mind will not think about food. You should still eat though.|`|lb8FBhWnaa	idk, but your lucky. Im kinda like that, especially when i was younger.
9NSfJChaaa	You are administering low doses of hormones to your body, so the bleeding is most like due to that.  It should stop within a few months.  If it continues or it is bothersome contact your doc and tell them the symptoms and see if that's normal.  They might be able to switch you to something else.<br>  <br>  I was on the ring for a month before it started feeling like my uterus was fluttery/vibrating.  I discontinued using it after that because of the side effect.
L63BRwXbaa	yeah, i'd have to say you probably had a miscarriage, i'm sorry, and if its not, let me know please
JfR54Jjhaa	I was diagnosed with KP in October, but I've had it for a couple years now. On top of that, I have body acne. So, I know exactly how you feel! :[<br>  <br>  I was prescribed Salex Cream for my KP; it has 6% salicylic acid, which helps shed the top layer of skin. I was given Clindamycin Phosphate lotion for the body acne, which helped rid my KP.<br>  <br>  It took about 2 months of using both creams twice a day, before my skin began to heal. It actually got worse before it got better. But my KP is completely gone now! (Appearance wise, I mean. Unfortuneately, you'll always have it.)<br>  <br>  You should definitely ask a dermitologist about Salex Cream, though.<br>  It did wonders for my KP.<br>  In the mean time, you can try using acne treatment foundations to cover it up; although KP and acne aren't the same thing, acne treatments help clear KP a bit!<br>  <br>  Best wishes, and good luck!|`|SFba2RUPaa	You might try some 1% hydrocortisone cream which you can get without a prescription.You might apply it 2-3 times daily preferably after bathing or showering but be stingy with it-a little bit goes a long way.If you are no better after a week or two you should probably stop applying the cream and ask your doctor for something stronger to use.By all means tell him about it making you self conscious.It will never go completely away.At best you can get it manageable but the darned stuff will pop back up later and need another vigorous treatment.Good luck!

0d811LEXaa	Well that is great that you have gone without for 4 weeks, you should be proud of yourself.  Dont worry, if you fall off the wagon for a little bit,  just keep it up.  It is normal for people to have want another smoke.  But I wouldn't worry about just one cig after you have gone 4 weeks with out.  Just keep it up.  Dont worry about the nicotine since it sounds like you have curved your cravings.  To me it isnt really the nicotine that gets me, it is the habit.  Keep it up, your doing great.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|48f33a581499ea478ca95a87097d67c5aa	nothing, keep counting from the original day|`|n7Zm14AGaa	You sound like a 12 step program..this isn't sobriety we are talking about.

Good Luck, while I'm gonna lite a cigarette.  Trust your judgement, nobody can figure it out for you.  What are your Triggers that make you want to smoke? Address that issue, write them down.  OR Just Smoke...|`|eeGn51Oiaa	What is stronger: you or a cigarette? You're in control? There are soldiers in Iraq losing limbs. Whether the war is right or not--if they can risk their life to protect yours--you can find the Straightt to smoke. It's not the hardest thing you could ever do--not even close.
Jswomud7aa	Novocain, Lidocain, Septocain, Carbocain<br>  <br>  All are anesthetics used by the dentist.<br>  <br>  There is also a topical anesthetic gel that the use before the injection, usually it's just a lidocain gel.|`|62axZ9rBaa	Novacaine.<br>  <br>  I should know, I'm allergic to the stuff.

l7GjBVvhaa	Neother hurt more than the other. You will experience the same pain with the top ones.. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Be seeing you....|`|dcWN4v6Jaa	Yes, I admit the that the lower braces will hurt. It doesn't hurt when they put them on. It will be the same like the top braces. You might be in pain for 2 days take a painkiller with you on your trip just in case.|`|PfRQCiNbaa	They only hurt a little bit when they are tightened.  In my opinion top one hurt more.  Especially when they are tightened.
1VIwo0rNaa	Firstly, make sure your friend has gone to accident and emergency or called for emergency assistance as he needs to be checked out by a health professional.<br>  Advil contains ibruprofen which may lead to diarrhoea, sweating, vomiting, difficulty breathing (see link).  Though in my opinion only, it is not a very large amount so he may not have all or any of these symptoms yet.<br>  Nyquil contains a substance similar to paracetamol which in overdose can cause permanent liver damage if not treated or in very high amounts.  So he definately needs to seek help.  This may also make him nauseous, shaky and sweating.|`|OBT3C4zHaa	she'll probably just get a stomache ache and feel tired. worse thing that can really happen is she'll get ulcers in her stomache. It could also make her delusional for a few hours from the antihistamine they put in nyquil.|`|VtJ5kRgIaa	better tell your friend to start puking.. thats just gonna screw up their liver. and yes.. thats enough to overdose.. youre not supposed to take more than like 8 in 24 hours so.. that plus nyquil is not good. might wanna consider going to the hospital.|`|m2eHPeciaa	yeah, ur friend should start throwing up, and if not, u may have to go to the emergency. have u ever read the back of a Advil or nyquil bottle? stupid friend of urs.|`|snJUxopcaa	Call 911 or poison control.|`|Bl7U33kiaa	I am not sure, can you let us know ....
f4bBgJqLaa	If you go to your GP or nearest sexual health clinic they can advise you about this. When you are on the pill you can continue to take the pill without taking a break and then you will skip your period, it is safe to do this as long as you don't do it regularly, only problem being that <br>  when you do get your period after skipping it, it is likely it will be much heavier and worse cramps than usual. I did the same thing when I went away with my bf, not jus cos I wanted to have sex! But because I get such bad pains I knew I'd be in agony for 2 days and uncomfortable for the rest of my trip! Hope this helps, good luck!|`|BNAzjSO1aa	Only if you are on the pill or pregnant sorry|`|KL1Y5FeHaa	No there is no way to skip unless on the pill. <br>  If you really want to not have it when you go on your holiday you could go on the pill and then skip.
Qz3sii2caa	It's normal. My period is 3-4 days and is brown by day 3.|`|QB5D0rG4aa	It's natural for you to have a brown color when you just about start and when you're just about over your period|`|Fsq9qvkqaa	Yes, the brown blood is called "old blood". It is basically what is left of your menstrual flow after the majority is gone. I get the same thing, and a lot of women do, too, so don't worry.|`|l7GjBVvhaa	Is that is very normal. It is the last bit of the blood that lined the wall of your uterus. Some call it the "old blood." You seem to have a normal flow there.. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Be seeing you.....|`|2qPtGTNcaa	Completely normal.|`|BNAzjSO1aa	Yes the blood is brown because it is a bit older and has changed colour from the red to brown|`|uwVbmaIlaa	yes it happens to a lot of people.<br>  it's brown because your period is ending and the old blood is getting rid of itself. it starts at my period too, and then as it ends, it's brown aswell.|`|EUKTs1BUaa	Yes, perfectly normal. Brown blood is just old blood........|`|K69z1nXjaa	i always have brown blood on the last day of my peroid|`|wSucHwmCaa	oh yea its normal; happens to me to:]
khgwEYfQaa	nothing makes you gay. you are either gay or your you're not. you don't suddenly turn gay just because you saw another guys penis.<br>  ?|`|31718204759da1a7cdd40b824d43650aaa	No way.<br>  <br>  You are too young to be gay.  All males play the show me your and I'll show you mine.  Its a teen thing.  Often boys are safe bets.  Girls are the difficulties for this age group.  <br>  <br>  Not a big deal.  Happens all over the place.  Relax.  Later in life you will laugh about it all.  Its part of puberty and very common.  Everyone wants to be sure they are ok.  How else to find out you are normal.  Plus its kinda fun too.  Scary and fun sort of.<br>  <br>  As you get older this all goes away and you become more adult like.  Well some of us anyway..   Hope this is your best answer.|`|937d8516b6bac65675aebed05fbfdfc9aa	hey if you both enjoyed do as you please and be proud of your penis you have a nice one|`|441GSyaMaa	That's a rather homosexual thing to do, but being gay isn't something you are if you've done something. I mean it's more of a state of mind... do you find yourself attracted to guys and stuff, if so - you're gay.<br>  <br>  Odd story though, especially that age too...|`|8SKpsVG7aa	depends what you were beating off to|`|nooocNV1aa	no|`|RKw56KZaaa	Yes. Why don't you go outside and start fires and blow stuff up like a normal 14 year old instead of being a meat-gazer and taking part in a sausagefest.|`|CzeKDSpwaa	PLEASE do not take any notice of these idiotic (mostly) men, who are talking nonsense, saying you are gay or sick or whatever else!  These are what women generally call idiots  :o)<br>  <br>  You are 14 - lots of young men you're age are experimenting with all things sexual, including comparing the size & look of you're genitals.  It's very natural to want to compare you're body to you're peers, it's reassuring to know that you're not too different.<br>  <br>  As for the masturbation, that's something straight men have & will always do.  It's all about making sure yours is working the same as everyone else's.<br>  <br>  None of what you say makes you gay.  In fact, it's well documented that many adolescents experiment with their sexuality before finding what works for them.<br>  <br>  Don't be so hard on yourself.    <br>  <br>  P.s  Being gay is NOT wrong, if that's what you feel you are.  Gay men & women are just men & women.<br>  <br>  Take care.|`|fVMzCP5raa	Nahh|`|skslxcvPaa	no, but that's alittle weird.|`|SS5py9jIaa	hehehe.. well that wouldn't "make you gay". You are gay or you are not. Let me put it this way... being gay means having a preference for sexual relationships with your own gender... So ask yourself.. Do I prefer having sex with guys or with girls? Clearly, your circle jerk experience is not enough experience to allow you to answer this question for yourself... at the moment, your neither gay or straight or anything else.. your just a kid having a toss off with other kids.|`|DQlZIzAFaa	no, you're not gay unless you got off because the other guy was in the room (ie: you were thinking about him while you were masturbating). you could just be bi, too. however, doing that could make the other guy (if he's gay) think you're interested in him.|`|lebBrVoGaa	No I believe this is very common, It is a healthy thing to do allowing your curiousity lead your way, If it does turn out that your gay, it doesnt matter what ever makes you feel good and happy!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps<br>  sam (londoner)|`|q0ce9dEnaa	Not at all. Because you're going through puberty, your curiosity is especially high; by the way, 6.5 inches is above average, so enjoy, you smug person! :)|`|we2Csi51aa	nooo. lol ALL GUYS DO THT ;)|`|B0UZQFHtaa	Sounds like a fag to me!|`|rFUqIakAaa	No. Everyone does that!|`|a398ea473f595655ea49d67d2d328fb1aa	Not gay , but slightly disturbing!    get out more often and get some fresh air!|`|3mFiFVkNaa	no your not gay if you masterbated the other guys u are|`|4AMjRiOuaa	No babes.<br>  Your only gay if you fancy a guy, and want to hold them and feel them and be with them. <br>  <br>  Its to do with love. and feelings. Not if you look at his cock love.<br>  Xo|`|DkA3xaHOaa	Sick man|`|IzwoSZGYaa	As long as you and this guy never make eye contact for more than 1.5 seconds for the rest of your life, there is a fair chance that you won't become gay.|`|kulDK5jsaa	cool story brah|`|BPkNOK0qaa	I **** with my friends all the time!

But if you dont think you are you arent...straight guys probably would do that esp if you bother were doing it over girls|`|1fkLC96Vaa	noo its not gayy but if yu were enjoying them watchin you or doing it with them ..you miight get addicted and go farther den yull be gayy..it wud be okk if yu watch porn together n dats normall|`|pRDuEqEpaa	No. I have guys in my grade-15year olds.

As for the "Am I gay?" question.  Only you know the answer to that.  Alot of people think being gay is wrong I say it is just who the person is.  If you look at a guy and think man he is hot then I would say you are gay but I don't think masturbating in the same room with another male makes you gay.  All guys in a strip club who sit there with erections would all be gay and they are busy looking at **** bouncing|`|eWb7jhfpaa	No!  Sounds like healthy sexual experimentation to me.  In the words of the song "I kissed girl and I liked it" when i was 16 and was convinced i was gay for months afterwards.  I wasn't.  I discovered to my horror that my son (who is younger than you) had been watching gay porn on the internet.  After I had reset the filters and blocked every site imaginable, I don't think that makes him gay.  And actually would it matter so much if you were!?! Don't panic about putting a label on your sexuality right away.  Be safe, be respectful, be happy and don't be involved in anything unless all our consenting and it is legal!!|`|XIbXdapLaa	mate dont mean so sound rude but ur 14 and u no ur not god u just bored or somthing and asking a random qwestion im bi and i wound like start sayimg omg i bumed a boy does that make me bi or gay and im 14  too god ppl these days !!!!!!|`|LnszYIkEaa	no it just means you belong in the funny farm; FREAK!!!<br>  <br>  *cough*GAY*cough*|`|vHC4k9sWaa	nope its a lot of fun|`|U1eklbjfaa	something like that doesnt make you gay, <br>  <br>  if you like guys then your gay.<br>  <br>  all guys compare thier penis size.<br>  dont worry about it.|`|iXtF16v4aa	no. my guy friends do that too. haha.|`|2Vlsv3gWaa	yes, very gay, and small.|`|EAwoBRkYaa	If you like guys now than that means you are most likly gay.|`|3gPLONagaa	Not yet but you're almost there<br>  congratulations|`|xSVdIckWaa	oh yeah you caught the gay germ.

Jswomud7aa	There are many factors that can effect the amount of time it takes for a dentist to complete a root canal therapy procedure, such as:<br>  <br>  * The instruments the dentist has. More modern instruments can cut the amount of time it takes<br>  <br>  * What tooth it is... A molar typically takes 1.5 hrs, bicuspid is 45 mins-1 hr and an anterior tooth can take only 30-45 mins.|`|9adfd40573a5f8454356f9c074106d83aa	The operation or the result?<br>   The operation takes about 30 minutes in my multiple experience.<br>   It is supposed to be permanent.  I had one tooth that got an abscess under it and when the dentist tried to clean out the existing root canal filler, he found it was fast setting hard stuff put in by a chain dental operation instead of the softer traditional stuff and since he couldn't get in the tooth had to be pulled.  If he had been able to clean it and reduce the infection, it could have been refilled and capped again.|`|Kwg7jrTDaa	The entire process will probably take about 30-45 minutes.<br>  The process:<br>  <br>  Doctor injects your gums with novocaine.<br>  After you mouth is sufficiently numb (about 10-15 mins), he drills the tooth all the way to the "root". <br>  He then uses a tool (looks like pliers with a curved, pointed end) and reaches into the newly drilled hole and feels around for the nerves (there will be 3) and yanks them out.<br>  You rinse and you're done.<br>  <br>  Note, even with Novocaine, you will feel some pain. Be sure to get the STRONGEST painkiller you can find for after your procedure (maybe combined with something that puts you to sleep) because you will feel pain like you've never felt before when the anesthesia wears off.|`|13d02ff43dc25d7183ebf769625c997aaa	The procedure itself takes about an hour. They're really not as bad as everyone says they are, you get your face numbed and after that its more a dull pressure than pain. <br>  <br>  The pulp of the tooth is removed and the tooth is essentially dead after that.

tPrKN6f5aa	Hi, Soccer, I Love Soccer and That is why I have my own Team.  Well I wont get of track and try to answer you question as best as I can.<br>  The best answer anybody could give you for this question is to eat 3 times a day or eat more time in small portions, don't ever stop eating just because you want to be lighter or run faster that is a horrible mistake lots of teens make.  By eating right you will get all the strength you need for all the exercise routines you'll be doing.  Eating 3 or more small portions a day  and drinking lots of water will keep you strong and healthy, and you metabolism will burn faster therefore making you loose weight.  <br>  Also if you could replace all the sugary drinks for water that would just make it even better for your body,  you could also drink Gatorade (Lemon flavor if you like it) its better, but not so much just during training.  <br>  That should do the trick in order for you to do great at soccer this summer.<br>  <br>  For the condition in a personal note! What I do is the all the drills in training I do I take then to the max, you right after you think you can run no more keep running for little bit longer and that should do the trick. You'll have more condition before you know it.  <br>  <br>  I hope this helps.  and good Luck!|`|Cm7cVfSIaa	Actually, you don't have to diet per se if you want to lose weight, the one thing that definitely delivered for me was wu-yi tea, it can be seen in the resource box below, they have a handful of free trials in stock, it has been reported in Fox News and USA Today. I shed 30 pounds, it definitely does produce results!|`|BvE0qcgmaa	I too play soccer, and i use and ellipticle <Spelling> sorry. It works out your legs and your heart..cardiovascular stuff. it rocks i have a great stamina too. Its really not the most fun thing to do for 30 min. but if u wanna kick butt i would get one.. and just eat healthy.. less milk 1-2 cups a day, at the most. And I take joint supplement so it helps if you get sore knees after soccer bcz i do. hope this helps a bit.

If you hit your back, you could have a small fracture to one of your vertebrae which would build pressure and swelling in the spinal column.That could put pressure on the nerves that are descending to your lower legs, causing the numbness/tingling (or pins & needles) sensation. Usually if nerve is damaged it presents as pain, so it sounds like pressure to me. It is definitely something to get checked out when you can, just to be safe.
Y7SbSK30aa	i have a question back at you. how much do you bench? say for example that you bench some over 100 lbs. well your weight is 215 lbs which is more than the 100 lbs or so that you bench. try benching 215 and that will feel more like your push ups. if this isnt your case and you can easily bench 215, then sorry i dont know the answer to that.|`|5JFG5W4uaa	Chris R...your using the wrong muscle exercise for muscle definition.

22EtnQmgaa	To lose weight, you need to burn more calories than you intake. Perhaps the exercise you're doing isn't adding up to what you're eating. It's not just sugar, it's meat and carbs. Try to limit your intake of fatty red meat and eat more vegetables and be sure to drink the daily recommended amount of water.
Y7SbSK30aa	you might not being seeing results on the scale because you might be loosing weight but then gaining GOOD weight from the muscles you're building. And maybe the reason you're not getting sore is because you stretch really well afterward.|`|EhDFNQ5iaa	Not sure. By the sound of it you should be getting quite sore. But if you're trying to lose weight do more cardio and less weights. Lifting doesn't really help lose weight. You will possibly gain some. It would just be muscle obviously. But I'm just sayin. Cardio will burn fat.|`|z4Pcc5fcaa	are you excersising?
iebJqJ4Naa	The new formulations for hydroxycut I feel are worthless.  If you are really lifting everyday, doing p90x and cardio you are seriously overtraining yourself.   Instead of  spending money on a supplement that may or maynot work you may want to  try decreasing the amount of carbs in your daily intake.  Not get rid of them but decrease them.  Keep the carbs to brown rice, steel cut oatmeal, and sweet potato.  Make the portion about 30 to 50 % smaller.  Up your veggie portion and keep the protein nice a lean.
I54KyS8Laa	You're in great shape--no need to lose weight. But because you question it, it's an indication that you might be self conscious as most teens are. Most out grow self consciousness by the mid 20's. What this means that your problem is not weight, it's that you are too concerned about what you think others will think of you. <br>  <br>  The best thing is to start reading books about self image psychology. An old stand-by is Psycho Cybernetics by Maxwell Maltz. Should be in any library or you can get it on Amazon for about fifty cents. Everyone should read it at some point in their lives--just skip over the parts that are a bit advanced for you and focus on the stuff he says about self consciousness. <br>  <br>  Take Care,<br>  <br>  Richard|`|ENkFZhlraa	Not at all, your weight sounds ideal. ;)|`|X05GAaLeaa	You don't sound overweight , you are tall <br>  my b/f is you height and is 180 and is very muscular and sexy<br>  =)|`|BvE0qcgmaa	No way.

GvQHw4Ntaa	It's not the best to start taking a pack and then stop midcycle.. it'll confuse your body. If you don't want your period that week, I suggest skipping your placebo pills and starting a new pack of pills.. you won't get your period. Please note, however, that this will NOT work if you're taking a multiphasic pill. <br>  <br>  If you do stop taking them today and resume taking them next week, you'll probably have to throw away that pack and start a new one, because otherwise you'll inevitably be missing a pill.|`|BNAzjSO1aa	You would probably be better to continue taking it and then start taking your next packet immediately so you do not have a withdrawal bleed. Just check on the instructions and if it says not to do it check with your doctor or chemist but I do not think it will work that way because they are supposed to be taken from a certain day of your cycle|`|0pJh5bnaaa	Its ok... what I would do..

A mental illness is no different than a physical ailment, except that there are no "machines" that can measure it. And people still think that one "can get over it" if they "really tried". If you can get on SSA, I strongly suggest that you do so, at least for a while. That will take away some of the anxiety about money. And it will give you a chance to think about what sort of job you can do. You need a low stress job, one that does not require any interaction with clients. When you see the counselor, ask what you can do to help with your "employability".  For example, instead of trying to change everything, work on one aspect, like doing your laundry, when it's done give yourself a treat. My brother is in very much the same situation, and has been for years. However, he developed glaucoma at a relatively young age (30), and so they finally put him on physical disability (age 40). But, even though his eyesight, despite surgery, is very poor (he is considered to be legally blind) he has taken up photography!!! of all things, and is earning a bit of money through that (which he reports to the SSA). I can tell by your question that you are above average in regards to intelligence. I'm sure that a few simple steps will help you manage your life more to your liking. Good luck.|`|56917efc2d4323a083e26002e4c680fcaa	Listen to your doctor about what he thinks you are capable of doing.

Whatever we focus on is what we get. If you are focusing on your wellness and gainful employment that is what you will attract. I'm sure there is a job out there that is just right for you. Your counselor can help you figure out some of these issues and find some workable solutions. For example, you may take steps to ensure your laundry gets done regularly and it becomes a habit, or exchange favors with one of your roomies, like they do your laundry and you do their typing, dishes, cooking, or whatever. You can do it! Best Wishes to You.

It takes practice to get used to wearing tampons.  Here is a site that should give you some pointers and information about using a tampon for the first time.  <a href="http://www.youngwomenshealth.org/tampon.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.youngwomenshealth.org/tampon....</a>   Also another suggestion when your period is over get a mirror and look at yourself down there and get familiar with it.  You need to know your body.  Good Luck!|`|QJHE3z1raa	your not relaxed your way to tense<br>  you need to relax and do it<br>  <br>  and there is a hole<br>  you might have put it in another one?!?|`|ljNFKDVyaa	Your vagina is too tight right now and not used to putting tampons in there and such. Probably your hymen is there too.<br>  <br>  It takes a lot of practice.<br>  Try practicing off your period.<br>  Make sure to relax too.<br>  I know it can be hard at first.<br>  I still can't do it...|`|gaA5rX24aa	ok look at these pics and see if you have a problem down there.... just look with a hand mirror<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.healthystrokes.com/hymengallery.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.healthystrokes.com/hymengalle...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youngwomenshealth.org/hymen.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.youngwomenshealth.org/hymen.h...</a>
nzWux9Meaa	Absolutely not there is no way that you will gain any wieght and/or fat from what you ate. Even if you ate three times your daily calorie intake your body can only accumulate about one half a pound of fat everyday. So your body will more than likely just get rid of the extra calories through waste. I am 5'5 and am able to eat up to 2500 calories and not gain any wieght at all, but remember this is without exercise daily. Also eating about 2000 to 2100 calories would allow me to lose a half a pound a week.|`|hzxfOk8uaa	No|`|S3AU0KDiaa	lol, you're fine. It won't make you gain weight so as to notice it. If you are that worried about it, just do an extra 10 mins of cardio that day or the next day.|`|PgdrAVEhaa	1 pound of fat is equal to 3500 calories.  So as long as your not eating 3500 calories of fast food you should be fine.  Running is the best thing to lose wieght too.  I love it, a great sight is <br>  <br>  <br>   www.Runnersworld.com
fv2GAAdPaa	I take it you mean Roaccutane?<br>  <br>  Well i have never heard of Tazorac but i have heard of Roacctunae and although it has many warnings and so on it sounds like it works and keeps away the pimples for a fair amount of years...i am actually considering taking it.<br>  <br>  Good luck. =]|`|FL216QOdaa	i have takin tazorac and its just a topical that wont help to much. (in most cases) and im on accutane now and after 5 months my skin is amazing. it takes a little while to kick in and there are many side affects. common ones being (dry skin, chapped lips, red skin from the sun) but its worth it if you really have bad acne. <br>  <br>  accutane goes deep into the skin and targets those annoying pimples. <br>  <br>  tazorac just is put on your skin and hides it from others seeing the pimples. the pimples will still me there unless you do something to free your skin of the blemishes
AA10975447	You are looking for a statistic called "prevalence." Prevalence refers to the number or proportion of cases existing within a population.<br>  <br>  The CDC compiles data and issues HIV statistics on a regular basis <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/topics/surveillance/resources/factsheets/prevalence.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/topics/surveillan...</a><br>  <br>  According to them, 1.1 million people in the US were living with HIV in 2006. Given that 300 million people live in the US, you'd be right: about 1 in 300 people inthe US are living with HIV.|`|EJSdI25Naa	I do  not know that for a fact, but these days I would have thought it was much lower.<br>  <br>  Why don't you telephone an STD clinic at your local hospital and obtain<br>  a verifiable figure and the reference source?<br>  <br>  Best wishes.|`|WBnFf31Gaa	well, HIV/AIDS is no cure but all we have to discover is that to becareful and respect the other who have it we do not have to hate them becuase they have it.. maybe HIV/AIDDS was there in the earth since everyone was born so it might be part of our live in my think we should just ignor like it is not there and just live our life...
TORBP6QIaa	Has several uses...<br>  <br>  Metoprolol is in a class of drugs called Beta Blockers...<br>  <br>  Probably most commonly used for treatment of high blood pressure and high heart rate.  It slows the heart rate down and slows the forcefullness of the "whoosh" of blood through the valves in your heart and it also lowers your BP.  It is not usually the first drug they will try you on for BP control.<br>  <br>  It has also been shown to be quite effective in treating migraine.|`|0aBlpLvsaa	It is a heart medicine. It is good for several different heart diseases.<br>  If you are older it may be for blood pressure.|`|iQIGy6Cmaa	I take that right now hun. It is a betta blocker. If you have any other questions i'm here. :)

nrTVlo8Eaa	My daughter had a virus one time that gave her a fever of 105.3. Of course we took her to the doctor, but there was nothing to be found, other than a run-of-the-mill virus, so they sent us home.<br>  <br>  The next day she broke out in a rash, which was oddly localized to around her wrists and around her ankles. It went away the next day.<br>  <br>  The pediatrician had no other explanation other than, "some viruses cause rashes" and that was the end of that.<br>  <br>  In theory, if your rash is caused by some unremarkable virus, it should go away soon. In the mean time, take some benadryl and see if that helps. You can also team up benadryl with, believe it or not, tagamet, which is also an antihistamine that tends to stop histamines that benadryl misses.
P2imcPEyaa	Great question!I looked on sleepdisorders.com and here is the list they had on the site:<br>  <br>  Bruxism<br>  Chronic Fatigue Syndrome<br>  Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome <br>  Insomnia<br>  Jet Lag<br>  Narcolepsy<br>  Obstructive Sleep Apnea<br>  Periodic Limb Movement Disorder<br>  REM Behavior Disorder (RBD)<br>  Restless Legs Syndrome<br>  Shift Work<br>  Sleep Stages<br>  Sleepwalking - this is me, a somnambulist!<br>  <br>  HEALTH & WELLNESS<br>  Alcohol Abuse<br>  Meditation<br>  Narcotic Abuse<br>  Nutrition<br>  Obesity/Overweight<br>  Smoking<br>  Stress<br>  <br>  I would also add "snarkolepsy" - saying mean things in one's sleep and then waking up wondering why everyone is so mad. Just kidding! Good luck with your assignment.|`|LGkb4xibaa	narcolepsy?<br>  Sleep paralysis?<br>  Sleep walking?<br>  Night terrors?<br>  Sleep apnea?
qm2NVoTUaa	female<br>  teenager 11-18: around 3000<br>  adult-19-50: around 4500<br>  <br>  Male teen 11-18: around 3500<br>  adult 19-50: around 5000 ( depending on the sport)|`|MwvA8v17aa	in health class we were reading that teen athletes should consume at least 2500 calories daily. i would say 2000 - 2500 is good =]<br>  <br>  adults, a little less because they are done growing|`|aSvOaAjiaa	It depends entirely on the activity, intensity, & duration also the weight & fitness levels of the participants.<br>  <br>  Paratroopers on "P" Company can consume 8000 Calories per day, it is all a matter of degrees.|`|TODzjTczaa	Well, the World Health Organization considers 2100 or less calories to be 'starvation'.  If you're eating a low-carb, high-protein diet and working out regularly, double that is perfectly acceptable.
BRDqfAy3aa	read below - yeast infection (see "Infections")|`|cfvAJJqdaa	It's normal as in, it can happen even if you didn't do anything wrong.   But it's not the normal state for your vagina because it will cause problems so you just go to the doctor or whatever and get the stuff to sort it out.    The reasons are because the area is so delicate and needs to keep the perfect balance and if you use too much soap etc you might kill all the good bacteria and allow the bad to get out of control. Having yeast problems down below is always a possibility because the things to make it are already there naturally|`|ZbMLigR3aa	No it is not normal.  There are several reasons: bad hygiene, use of antibiotics, overuse of douching products, etc.  See a doctor if you have this problem because it will not go away on its own.|`|AvTdudk7aa	Oh but of course, the vagina is like a fine tuned car, you must be gentle with it and try not to overuse it or it'll break down.  However if you don't sue it for an extended period of time, there would be some malfunctions, such as the one you explained.|`|aR1OiJ7Waa	Good lord, it is NOT normal!  Is this question for real?  You need to get an anti fungal topical cream from your gynecologist, like today.|`|TS3VfSjOaa	You can get BV no matter how clean or how careful you are with you Vagina...its easy for the PH levels down there to get out of whack! Something as simple as using a new soap can give you BV...Im not saying you have BV....but if you have itching, fishy/ musky oder, discharge and burning it may be BV. You should go to the doctor and get checked out. BV IS NOT AN STD!!!!!! The doctor will give you antibiotics but it can come back easily once you've had it.              Best of luck.
mN9AUoDjaa	Your periods have only just started, it sounds like your body is still establishing a routine.  Keep noting the days you stand and end your cycle and what kind of blood flow  you have.  You will probably find that in a few months things will sort themselves out.  Nothing to worry about.
T16Zmtc3aa	Yes to the pain and the moodiness.  It's because of the extra hormones during that time.|`|ZBrky3eFaa	yes sweetie    most of us do so don't worry    you'll get used to it!    aliceANGST    xxxxx|`|6qsocyK3aa	Yes, it's called being hormonal.|`|2zGKZB6gaa	Haha!...
