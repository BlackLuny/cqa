20070125000315AAEIRJF	Business & Finance;Personal Finance	Inherited assets: should I buy my family now or wait until I have the cash?	I inherited some houses and land worth a significant sum of money.  However, the assets must be split with a few other family members - four other people.  A rough estimate of the assets is US$2M.  I'd like to buy out the other members and I need to shell out $600K to pay them off(they've agreed to this).  My problem is that I already have an outstanding $200K loan and I make only 30K/yr.  I have 100K in savings and about 600K in raw land.      I don't know what option is the best to take.  I figure I could sell my land, but that could take a long time (with the slow real estate market) and people might change their minds.  Or I could try to take out a loan and buy everyone off, but that's risky too.  Does anyone have any suggestions about what to do or who I could talk to for some kind of financial counseling?        Many thanks...

20070130063808AAaWqNJ	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment	Re:Job info???	WE NEED YOUR HELP PLEASE!!!!!      My husband had a really good job before we were married as an electronics technician then i got pregnant and he took paternity leave(his boss said that he wasn't special and didn't need time off) when he went to go back to work they said he couldn't come back ,it ended up going to the labour board where he won a $6000 settlement.  Since that time(3yrs ago) he hasn't been able to find steady work anywhere.  He is 42yrs old and potential employers keep telling him he is too old for the position.  Is there anyone out there in the Hamilton, Dundas area that might have a job for my husband?  We are struggling to pay bills and feed our children and he is desperate to work(it's almost as if the job market is dead) and will do anything.   He is experienced as:   Bricklayer   Electrical   Carpet Layer   Electronics   Laying Tiles   Welding    and much much more. He doesn't drive because the tranny died in the car, so all jobs should accessible by bus.

Most patients have had strokes, paralyzed, alzheimers or have chronic illness.  I have no problem doing what's asked of me.  I am a caring person.

20090202123602AAxecF0	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	What is better, private or council? ?	Am currently living in a private rented house the rent is ￡360 a month for a 2 bedroomed. The bathroom is downstairs at the back of the house, even with the heating on at this time of the year is still cold in there. The walls have started to get cracks up them, the landlord said its because the walls were newly plasterd and the central heating has something to do with it. We have just noticed that there is a mold in the kitchen too. i dont want to be on at the landlord all the time about little things and i dont want to waste money that i havent got at the minute decorating the house, when it will only benefit the landlord.    What my question is, what do you think is better? private renting or renting from the council?

My gardener and my driver were going at it like rabbits in the back of my Jag when I caught them at it. The problem is I don't want to sack my driver Rachael as she is just too attractive and I rather like the flash of the white triangle when she's changing gear.   The gardener is an ugly sod (I don't know what she saw in him) and gardeners are ten a penny anyway. The problem is that if I just sack HIM and not HER then he'll no doubt bring one of these dreadful sex discrimination charge thingys.   What would be my best course of action?

I have rung the bailiffs and they have said there is nothing they can do as this is where the van is registered and this is where they will come to seize goods.    What are my rights?

20080804103323AAfMJDO	Business & Finance;Credit	Can a collection agency charge interest on a medical/dental bill?	A few years ago, my husband required oral surgery.  At the time, we had unexpectedly been unable to pay the bill.  We owe $203 for the debt that had gone into collections.  I had made payment arrangements for $50 per month and per my conversation with the collections agent, I would be paying the total due, meaning $203.       I've paid $200 so far, and am expecting to now only owe $3.  I called the agency and the service rep said that I still owe $97 because of interest charges.  This is not what I was told originally when I spoke with this company.  Is this legal?  What should I do at this point?

20081027214422AA8Bg4p	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Other - Careers & Employment	Resigning from my job?!?	I did a 3 month practicum this past summer.  I loved it.  I loved my co-workers, supervisor, and the clients.  They didn't have a position for me when I was done, so another site hired me.  It was quite a bit different than I was used to and some other things got in the way.  They treated me very badly at the beginning.  Because I initially had a lot of respect, I started the job right away.  2 WEEKS LATER, my supervisor at the new job told me my wage would be 19/hr, a few days later he said it was supposed to be 14, but then settled on 16 after 3 months.  Not only that, but I don't like 90% of my co-workers.  It's just not the same.  I've been there for 2 months.  I thought I was just missing my practicum location.  Now, I have some other opportunities.  Today is Monday, and a job that I was offered with higher pay is starting the training on Monday.  I feel bad for quitting without much notice.  Any advice on what to say?  I don't want to burn my bridges too bad because I still want to be on good terms with the people I used to work with when I did my practicum.

I filed as soon as I received my w2 from my employer. I am expecting a signifigant refund as well. I just got the mail and realized that I didn't include a W2 that I got from my insurance company that I collected short term disability from. I didn't know it was seperate as my disability checks were from the company I was working for. So I didn't know I needed to wait for another W2. I called the insruance company and they told me that I should file an amended return, after I receive my refund. Will the IRS see this error during processing and correct it and send me a revised refund? I am expecting it to be alot smaller with the new W2. I am not sure how to go about this?

20080930080436AAabETJ	Business & Finance;Credit	How long do you think this 'credit crunch' is likely to last?	Our fixed rate mortgage ended last November (2007). At that point all of the issues with the mortgages in America were just arising. So we decided to fix our mortgage for another 3 years rather than 5, 7 or 10, which were the other options, as we (naively) thought that things would be sorted and we would be stuck fixed to a higher rate than we needed to be.   Obviously, that didn't exactly turn out like we had imagined. So our mortgage is due for renewal in a little over 2 years.   I just wondered if anyone had any clue as to how likely it is that this whole economic upheaval, will have settled back down to normal in those two years?

20061217225227AAAfEju	Business & Finance;Credit	Unauthorized credit inquiries?	I recently hired a mortgage broker. The mortgage broker and I had an agreement that he would pull my credit ONCE and share them with the banks. He got me the loan, I bought the house and pulled my credit and found 50 inquiries from banks. I asked the banks and they said my credit was pulled at the request of the broker. I asked the broker and he said he never authorized anything (but of course he will not put this is writing). The cocky jerk is now telling me there's nothing I can do.  My question is: How did the banks manage to pull my credit at his request (not mine, I did not sign anything authorizing the banks to pull my credit) and is there really nothing I can do to get it off my credit report? (By the way, I authorized him to pull my credit ONCE, his mortgage company pulled it nine times)
