20090225023547AATvdJ1	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	How long should a man allow a woman to mentally abuse him?	I use to feel sorry for women who would get beat up by their husband or boyfriend. But you know what, six years ago when I was working at Ruby Tuesday, I saw a server who would verbally abuse her husband all the time. This guy was a nice guy and most of the time she would get loud to grab people attention making him out to be the bad guy. One morning while I was opening up, I heard her call him on the phone and tell him to bring his butt up to the job. He comes to the job and it's her, him and I in the dining area. I'm setting up and she is steady at the door chewing him out. When he tried getting her to calm down, all she did than was raise her voice. He wasn't being mean to her but was just trying to get her to calm down. When he left, she started crying telling the servers who came in how he was loud and was talking about taking his daughter away from her and divorcing him. This conversation may have happened at home, but he was not being loud when she demand him to come up to the job. Well this would not be the first time I would witness this. The last time she had him come up to the job, she got so loud that the manager came out and wanted to know what was going on. She told the manager that she wanted her husband barred from coming to Ruby Tuesday because he was starting trouble, but the whole time it was her causing the problem. I spoke up and told the manager what had been going on. So they didn't barred him. I told her the next morning when she came to work. If your husband was to ever clock you, I would defend him before I would defend you. You are a very miserable person and you need help. I don't know what ever happened to them since I moved back to California. So you people who are so fast to defend these woman who are yelling domestic abuse. Know the details first. Don't get me wrong, I don't believe in men hitting on women, but when a woman doesn't know when to stop abusing their men verbally and mentally then I have no problem watching a women get her jaw slapped. Cause if homeboy from Ruby Tuesday would have slapped the crap out of her, I would have just stood there and said daaaaaaaaaaaaaaam. Cause when you put all the abuse that she was kicking out verbally, all that crap eventually adds up. Ladies if you don't want a slap than don't talk the crap. And it's always easy to tell someone to walk away when you aren't the one in the situation. Like I said before, I don't approve of a man hitting women. But I don't approve of a women who is abusive verbally and than want to cry physical abuse when she get slapped.       Here is a story of a woman who wrote her story of being abuse by her boyfriend, and after reading it, I shook my head, because she was warned, if you do something, I am going to do something to you, so she does crap to see if he would do it and than she writes about her trauma. I don't feel sorry for the lady at all. If you walk out in front of a truck and get hit knowing the truck is going to hurt you, than why walk back out there just to get hit again.      http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...

20090225023534AAnnOta	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	This guy asked me out & i said no, but do you think the way i said it sounded rude?	Ok, so i met this guy about a week ago & we've only hung out once (not including i have to see him once a week in a class that i take).   So i dont really know him nor his last name. Anyway we have talked on the fone but not really about anything. Today he asked me out via txt. This is what i said . . . Um sorry but for now can we just keep it as friends? Maybe later on though!  << Do you think that was appropriate or did it sound rude. Because i dont want him to think i dont like him, i just want to get to know him a bit more!

20090225023716AAKD9Io	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Should I get two gowns?	My partner and I have began discussing what we'd like for our wedding.      We're likely to have the ceremony in a castle followed by a meal.  The party will be a Ceilidh (Scottish dancing) followed by a band and DJ.        I have seen an amazing Ian Stuart gown called 'Rock and Roll' which is very cute for the party (or something similar) but this wouldn't be what I'd want for the day, as I wanted something traditional.      Is it silly to have two gowns?  More over, will I have time to switch?      The other option is to have separates and have a bodice but two skirts to swap between.      Has anyone else done this?  I don't fancy trying to do the Ceilidh in a full gown!

I would ideally like them to be spiritual and have a respect for nature, without being preachy about any specific beliefs, but if they have no beliefs at all then that is fine.      I want to get married in a random outdoor location (not yet decided where) but what is the official title of the person who would be able to legally perform the ceremony?      Thanks
20090225031632AAeHB80	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Whats it mean when a guy.............?	obviously tries to keep away from you.   like, does anything to not be near you practically.   ive never spoken to him. we dont know each other.   we are both shy.   but when the class has to like gather around the computer   and the only seat is next to me he takes it and moves    as far over as possible away from me.   (makes meangry).   yet he used to stare a me all the time,   now he rarely does it.      whats that mean?
20090225031728AAoHdJK	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Why are these people such Liars and Selfish! -Long-?	Okay so I live in a house and I PAY RENT to the owners of the house whom I live with also.      They asked me to get rid of my pit bull because they were going to bring in a new dog who did not get along with mine, and they felt if there dog attacked mine, my dog would win...      Anyway, I sent my dog back to my mother (she bought him for me 2 years ago) And they told me I could get a puppy, in fact they told me I should get a Male Rottie to bread with there's. (I declined)       One of there dogs had some puppies, and they were half pit, and I asked if I could keep one, surely it would get along with the new dog because it was going to grow up around it. They said. 'No pits' (which is fine.) BUT then they decided THEY were going to keep one.       Okay...      So anyway, I decided to search for my owe dog. Then my boyfriend said that the owner may try to put my dog in the backyard with the other dogs when Im not home.       Thinking about this I realized this would be VERY bad. Both dogs in the backyard like to 'FIGHT' with new dogs, and the dog I had planned to get was going to be pretty small compared to the others.       So I decided it was time to sit down with the house owner and have a 'Talk' with him and his wife. I explained my point of view. They then said, the house has to many people living in it for us to get another dog. (EVEN AFTER THEY ALREADY TOLD ME I COULD GET ONE!)      So I was fine with this, then a thought accrued to me. Even if we had a 10 bedroom house, we would still be using the same amount of bedrooms! (hubby+wife in one room/There son in one room/Mother and daughter in one room/ and me and my b/f in another room)       So then i thought about the 'household rooms' rooms we would all use like the kitchen and the TV room. We have 2 WHOLE rooms that are being un-used. (completely un-used)      So I don't get it, I'm really ready for them just to just admit they are selfish and liars...      DONT TELL ME TO MOVE   DONT TELL ME I DONT OWN THE HOUSE.

20090225031023AAt67Ux	Family & Relationships;Family	What can i do about him?	This will be a bit long but stick with me!       My dad left 10 years ago and at the begining i was a bit mean to him but after a couple of years we started to get our relationship back on track cause my sister missed him.    We have been doing ok but in the last year or two he has been really distant. We hardly ever see him and now he doesnt even talk to us for weeks at a time.    My sister has given up all hope and about three weeks ago we actually saw him and said what we thought, he agreed and said that he would be a better dad but nothing has happened i havent heard from him since.    Now i have just ignored anything that has to do with him and i just dont want to have him in my life anymore if he is going to let me down and my sister down like this. It is not worth it anymore!    Is this the right thing to do or should i try with my dad. Admittedly he has had alot on his plate with his new marriage,a flat and a baby but that shouldnt stop him from talking to his daughters, a text a week is all i asked from him and i couldnt even get that!      Am i doing the right thing of cutting him out of my life?

20090225031422AAEBwZX	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why do I do this to him?	I'm a little bit more jealous than other guys. My boyfriend (I'm gay, and please no BS or gay bashing) and I have been dating for a year now (this is our second time dating). When we first moved together, I caught him looking at guys profiles on myspace. That was like 10 months ago. He likes to look, but I know he never touches (please no "ur stupid, of course he's touching" comments). If there was a guy that he recently met that I didn't like, he would immediately delete them from his phone and never talk to them again. He has removed over 100 people from his myspace profile because he knows I don't like people that add every hot guy they find (he now has a total of 45 myspace friends). However, I can't stop checking his phone for text messages and phone calls. I have found one thing alarming (he used the internet on the phone once to check out profiles) but that was a long time ago. Other than that, I have never found anything suspicious. He doesn't delete messages. He doesn't hide his phone, he keeps it in the open. I know he loves me and wouldnt cheat, but i just can't stop looking at his phone (and sometimes his email and myspace). Any advice? And yes, I'm insecure, and jealous. And the whole "snooping" thing has gotten less recently, but I'd like it to stop completely...      Thanks for any advice, and sorry for it to be so long.

This guy only will come by when I am not around. I have only met the guy twice, and I have been with my girlfriend for 4 years. Both times he did come by, I was nice to him.        Now I understand that they might want to spend time alone, I am cool with that, but this guy never comes by when I am there. In fact, when he calls, and I am at home, he asks her if I am there or not ?!?!?!?! Is this not a reason for concern? I think that it is disrespectful that my girlfriend allows this to happen.

20090225030525AACpqUh	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why are women such dramatic failures at satisfying men?	Prostitution, stripper bars and the billion dollar porn industry are more than sufficient proof that women fail miserably at least 99% of the time at satisfying the men with whom they have supposedly committed themselves to in romantic relationships. Why do women so dramatically and conclusively fail each and every man with whom they have declared devotion?

20090225050334AADKqRQ	Family & Relationships;Family	Possible Live In Family:?	I kinda wonder why some single moms that have 4 or more children find it so hard to get up early or work multiple positions. Don't they realize that their children can only depend on them, and them alone. I posted a quesiton about a friend of mine with four children who is visiting me for a few days because her sister's apartment does not have lights. Well My daughter and I have to wake up at 4am for me to get to work for 6:30am. I have not made her a key yet so that means that everyone has to be leaving at 5:30. She and her children have spend the night for 2 nights. This morning she said she does'nt think she can do the 4am thing and that she will continue to stay with her sister. Making a long story short she has been trying to be in school instead of finding work. Why would she rather go to school that get a job knowing she has four children. Why does she find it hard to work real hard for her kids. I love my daughter and would work as much as I can without neglecting her to provide. Why do some mothers seem to not care that their children don't have a home?

20090225054116AAda3jd	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Not sure where to post this...here goes....?	A couple of years ago, I mistakenly got myself into a cyber-emotional affair with a man I had known years before. We were both married. There was very, very little sexual stuff involved, though we both wanted it. We never saw one another - just shared our lives daily.      Anyway, it finally ended - some woman he was having a real affair with started cyber stalking, and he threw me under the bus, didn't care that she contacted my husband and caused a real mess for me.....he was involved with someone in his town and I was just this person on the computer. I took the whole thing more seriously than he did, and in the end told him I never wanted to speak to him again in this lifetime. A first for me and I am nearly 50.      So, ff a couple of years. I had a project I wanted to do and started tooling around on the internet to find a website with info. I found a thread that was exactly what I needed, but life got busy and the project went by the wayside. I finally started it again a couple of weeks ago, but could not find the thread, so I wrote one line notes to several people on the website who looked like they might know about the topic based on their profile pics.      I got a response from the guy who wrote the original thread! So, I went to his profile to write him a note back, and started to read the profile. You guessed it - it is the man from a couple of years ago!! I had NO idea he was into this hobby - he never once mentioned it and neither did I in all those years.      So, now what do I do? Should I write back and say I realized we know one another and let's not continue this conversation? Should I identify myself? Should I just leave the guy hanging? I sort of hate to do that since we both had this experience with cyber stalking. Should I just make something up? I would never want to take the chance that he would figure out it was me - not that he ever would. I know him well enough to know I am the farthest thing from his mind, and that's ok - in fact, it's good.      Thanks.

And I was supposed to be having two friends of mine, sleeping over.   One can't sleep over because she's not allowed, because she has Church at 8:00am, until 1:00pm in the Afternoon.   And my other friend can't sleep over - if my other friend can't.      Diana (Girl who goes to mass).   Annalyne (Girl who isn't allowed to sleep over if Diana isn't allowed to).      The plan was, that Annalyne was going to lie to her Mum so that she could sleep over my house, (saying that Diana was going to sleep over, but shes not).    And then on Saturday, we were going to pick up Diana from her house at 1:00pm, and go bowling and ice skating.      We've had that plan for about 2-3 weeks now.      Tonight, Annalynes Mum told Annalyne that she was going to ring up Dianas Mum tomorrow just to check that Diana was going to sleep over.      Should I just call the entire Birthday Party off? I mean, it's just me. Nobody really cares anyway, lol.
20090225033839AAtd4ne	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	A girl fancies me, but i fancy her friend. help!?	Yeh so, I know this girl fancies me, but I've had my eyes on her friend. Which has put me in a difficult situation here.      If I reject her, then her friends aren't going to like me are they?      And if I say yes then im in a relationship i dont want to be in, but i still get to be friends with the person i like. But i would rather not do that.      These are only my thoughts.      Any suggestions, anyone been in this situation before? etc etc.

20090225043609AABrTUD	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How to choose between two guys?	Well i am having troubles figuring out which of my feelings are real. I like 2 different guys at the moment, both are good friends, 1 is my ex and the other is the best friend of another ex (so ive sorta dated within a circle of friends :\) Well the first guy has been a close friend of mine for over a year now and we have exchange our feelings and a romantic night too but im not sure if i really like him or not. And the second guy (my ex) is someone tht i feel im still in love with since i think about him alot even tho we broke up a year ago (sometimes i even get a feeling tht i will see him and then i really do see him). But my point is tht i feel bad liking both at the same time and i feel tht its wrong. So how can i decide which one i like better, or whether i should just cut my ties with both of them?   BTW : the ex has a girlfriend atm tht he doesnt really like.

20090225053454AA87YEO	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is it too soon for the commitment talk?	I have been dating someone for about two months. The first month we spent nearly every day together and he lives almost an hour away. THat started to die down quickly and now we see each other once a week, twice if im lucky. I'm not sure if he stopped asking me to hang b/c of the distance, or he  is just over it. Its confusing because we talk on the phone all the time. So, instead of seeing him, we just talk on the phone. I'm too old for another dead end relationship, but I also feel that it is still way too soon to have this conversation. He is very hard to talk to seriously...everything is a joke to him. (which is also another thing that bothers me) Any suggestions?

20090225061849AAYUgZH	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Would a relationship work without sex?	I've been told that nowadays, sex is a crucial part of any relationship. Is this true? And do you think that I (at age 20) will ever find a guy who would be willing to have a relationship with me WITHOUT any sex?   I haven't started dating yet. But now I am ready to. I have friends who sleep with their "guy friends" within only weeks of meeting them. I'm single now, but I still wouldn't be ready for sex even if I did have a guy. However, my friends tell me that when I find that special someone, that it will be hard to "hold out" from having sex. Is this true? And also, do you think that a guy would lose interest in a relationship with me if I didn't wanna have sex? Opinions please! Thank you!
20090225043249AAjMMZD	Family & Relationships;Friends	Do you thinks it's a good idea to tell your friends how u feel?	To cut a long story short,I've been friends with a family for 13yrs,I've basically had enough of only being the one making the effort,they'd never call or text,even when i'd had problems.   So last week I told them how I felt & (they are mother & Daughter & the daughter who's 21 is the worst) the mother replied basically sticking up 4 her daughter & I heard nothing from her daughter. Then 2 days later I get her b'day card returned in the post saying "must have been snt by mistake" (that is not how a 60yr old woman should act)   Do you think I did right to tell them how I feel?

20090225063036AAIzeLF	Family & Relationships;Family	How much do you help your children out once they move out of your house?	Ok, I am a little irritated with my parents I am 24 and yes they help me some by invinting us to dinner when we have no food ect. but hear me out. My husbands cousin has to get rid of a really nice grill that is worth some money and they asked if we wanted it. We had to figure out how to get it to our house. We asked my parents if they would either let my husband borrow my dads truck or they come get it with us. they said no, my husband doesn't have a DL so it was a no. We then asked my parents freinds if they would do it and they said yes right off the bat, that he would take him to get it. It is a bit of a drive too. I just thought it was a bunh of crap that someone that isn't my parents will help me out before my parents will. And they always act like this, like it is a burden to help us when we gladly pay them for gas and we do other things to show our thanks.

I am 21 dating a grl whos 24 and has 2 kids from a previous relationship but r relationship has been really great, been 2gethr over a year now. Shes a great gf, will do ne thing for me. We have a lot of plans together and we really look forward to them, but the other day she broke up with me cuz she wants someone to take care of her so i went out last night and enjoyed the single life and was like "Yes now i can do what i want and dont worry about her 2kids" I love this grl btw. this  morning she called me and talked to me and said, she doesnt want me to take care of her she just wants to see actions not just talk cuz i may talk about all these things i want in life but i havent shown her that i can do it and she doesnt want to be 30 and 3 kids (the one we want to have and her 2) and be doing everything and me not doing ne thing, she said I love you i want to be with you but I want u to change. She wants me to work more, stay in school and show her that I can do more 4 me and stop being lazy cuz she refuses to marry a man who is lazy like her dad was. So I accepted it and told her i will change and show her i can do more for me and work toward our plans 2gether because we both want it, her 2 yr old son calls me dad and im all he knows, i think that would really hurt the kid if i were to break up with her and id feel bad and she did mention when she was trying to give me another chance last nite that shes sad cuz he really did love me, Idk i love this woman and I see her point of wanting me to change but should i stay with her? i knw its up to me but whats ur take on it. this is a girl who if i can see myself with, i know im young but oh well.Should i stay with her and show her i can change and go through with our life plans together or just be single and meet someon later on

It's not intentional on my part.      -I couldn't go to the wedding because of "certain relatives".   -There was a computer problem & I had to give them the Xmas gift (a book) also as a Wedding gift.   -I mixed up my Xmas cards and left out the new husband. (This mixup caused 2 problems. And it was literally an accident, I like the guy.)   -She keeps offering me free stuff and I keep politely refusing.   -I'm unemployed so everytime I call I have to lie and pretend I have a job.      Anyway, she never calls and I can't seem to call her either. Am I jealous that she has found someone nice and I am going to die alone? Or am I just overthinking this?

So what is holding him back? By the way, i'm friends with his younger sister.
20090225041552AAxw6k0	Family & Relationships;Friends	What would you do? Help?	Alright so. Friends. I've asked a few questions about them, and realized that I shouldn't even consider them friends, more like acquaintances. The characteristics of my close group of "friends" let's see: Ones a lying control freak who I obviously can't trust. The other two are attached to each other, can't go without the other anywhere and have their own inside jokes that no one seems to get. I have another "friend" who's not supportive, makes fun of me and is a pain in the ****. Hmmm and that's about it. But see, those aren't characteristics of friends. I honestly don't have any real friends that I can trust and would ever invite into my space (my house) I just want at least one friend who I know won't judge me, who I can trust, and won't judge me no matter what.      I know you guys are just going to say "ditch these old friends and make new ones", but that's extremely hard at my all girl high school (kill me) and you know the fact that I'm a sickeningly loyal person and don't like hurting my friends feelings even when necessary. What should I do? Should I ditch these friends? Slowly distance myself? How can I make friends outside of school? (Since I'm not really fond of any of the girls at my school.Friendly but not fond)

20090224233737AAdnOu2	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	A close friend... is this hinting 'ask me out' or just being close?	-despite living 4 hours away (I had to transfer from the college we met at) she took a 4 hour bus ride to spend 3 days with me, staying at my place all 3 nights.  She told me I have to visit her before the end of the semester and I've made arrangements to do so.      -on these trips she was VERY vocal about her disapproval of everything involving my new college.      -she mock fights me every now and then... and mocks me in general but I know she doesn't mean anything.  When she thinks she went too far she feels bad and gives me a big hug.      -on one of our walks she grabbed my hand after I mentioned it was freezing... and just kind of held it for a while before agreeing that I was freezing and letting go.  We've never held hands before this recent visit... though I did touch her (clothed) boobs once.  Long story.      -she is the only person from my old college to still text me or IM me (she's even called twice this semester) on a regular basis.      -she's seeing someone who she's told me the relationship isn't going to last, the guy is nice but she just doesn't know about it.

20090224235826AAbFRKL	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is it good if a guy asks you this?	I was "talking" to this guy for a month and got to know him well. We clicked and got along right away. A month is so short but b/c of our personalities, our "best behavior" attitudes went away within a week and got to be ourselves right away. (very honest and deep for someone u just met...he wasn't so much "on the surface" but confided in me things he didn't tell his guys) I feel like I met my "match" (not so much w. the soulmate connotation but someone on my level intellectually and seriously, he's a guy version of me).      We're friends now and I'm very happy. We still talk and keep in good communication. He still innoncently flirts and is playful at times but we keep things in check. For the vday, i bought special little gifts for my friends including him. He usually jokes how i'm "in love" w him and i always respond w. "eww gross" or "eww NO" but when he thanked me for the gift, i said, "yes i do love you and I will always be here for you...as a supercool buddy haha" and he laughed as well and asked how work, school, and how life was doing...then he asked how my love life was?      I'm sure it was just a simple question but was asking how my love life was a slight implication or curiousity that may be good?
20090225065347AA6LIBg	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do I know her well?  Do I like her?	I have been same class with her for 2 semesters and I saw her several times at library. I have spoke with her just little bit, and I know it is not enough to know about someone, but I can know about person when girls talking with their friends.  I can hear when I am at studying at library. There are people who talk many different kinds of things, talking about cruel things, BI*chy talk, perverted things, etc. The girl I am interested is speak clean and her actions are kind of person who is comfortable to be with. So do I know her well? Look at dogs, humans don't talk with them, but they can love each other so much. So Should I tell her how I feel and ask her out?
20090225044554AAFm62k	Family & Relationships;Friends	My best friend never wants to hang out anymore? been friends for years?	We used to be alot closer, this time last year too. I hardly see her anymore and we used to hang out every weekend. Every weekend I say we should catch up, and then we end up not doing anything. The other weekend she said she'd rather catch up on Sunday because she had something on saturday night, even though we'd pretty much planned to do something then. We didn't do anything on Sunday either.      She never really messages me anymore, and never comments back on facebook.    When she calls me though, she seems fine and she talks a fair bit like nothing is wrong.      What is going on?      its been like this for quite a while now.       We both have jobs now, as compared to other years, but that still shouldn't change much as we don't usually work all weekend anyway.      Do you think shes just moving on and having more fun without me?

20090224233634AA9YIl8	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	If I stop coming around him, will he come to me?	I always drive the distance to see him and his band. He acts obsessed with me in many ways, but yet holds back kind of cause of fear of rejection. I have told him "no" so many times about going to see him and he acts like he wants to crawl in a hole and die from embarrassment and then he is afraid to ask me again, and just hints about it.      But I'm tired of it, and if I stop coming to him, will he do anything to come to me?      More details - he said i was the most beautiful girl he'd ever seen, and this was after friends witnessed him staring at me every time we would be around (about 20 times!) he watched me like a hawk and stared in amazement my friends said. SO he started writing me online every day for 2 months, then when I started having to call it a day sooner than him, I think he felt rejection and just stopped writing me online, but I still see him at his bar when I drive the distance and he looks like he is in heaven when he sees me! But he is afraid to ask me to come see him or anything like that... he just hints.       ??

20090225043206AA2trok	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Will this last?  He wants to drink, I am trying to quit or cut way back!?	I have posted several questions on here over the past couple of days about my relationship.  I am trying to get back with my ex.  We both have many issues, we are in counseling.   One of our issues is drinking.  I have had problems in the past.  I was in AA for 8 years, I remained sober for 11 years.  Almost 3 years ago I started drinking again.  Right around the time he and I first got together.  We went out drinking A LOT.  We had tons of fun, but there were some Not so fun times too.     I can get REALLY out of control when I drink.  I have done some really stupid things during my drinking career.     While we were broken up for 3 months I made some big changes.  I cut way back on my drinking and got really into exercise, heck, I lost 6 pounds in 2 weeks!!  LOL!!   So anyway, of course as soon as we started seeing eachother again I see the drinking getting out of hand again.  8 drinks 2 Saturdays ago..couple of drinks during the week....8 drink again this past Saturday....wine tasting Monday night...etc.....I started to panic.   So, yesterday when we were in our counseling session I proposed we both do Not drink for 30 days.  He was against it.  I am doing it.   The counselor even told him he has a problem but he does not agree.   He drinks and drives....but he thinks as long as he isn't DRUNK he will be fine.  I am worring about DUI and harming others.   He is afraid that if we don't drink it won't be any fun and then we will break up....I would rather find out NOW if we aren't compatible with out the booze!   Sorry is is SO long, I could go on, but I think you all get the picture.   Don't you think the 30 day thing is a good test?      Thank you.
20090225063827AA5KFeY	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does he like me more than a friend or is he just being nice?	This guy and I truly have an amazing connection and it's lasted for years. I can feel that he loves me when I'm with him and he hints things but he is not totally clear. We are just friends and I do not want to be physical until I feel more security in the situation. I really want to be patient and not push anything but I also worry about getting hurt. But if we're friends, it can't hurt, right? Should I be patient? He hasn't officially asked to be more than friends, but it seems like we are on the weekends.       He always wants me to sit close to him, he is always complimenting me, he likes to talk about how cute my nose is in front of his friends, he always brushes the hair out of my face, even when we're in groups of people, his friends hint to me that he loves me, one has said that he is insecure, he is always looking at me/smiling, etc.    He plays love songs when I'm around   Sometimes it seems like after doing these things, he puts a wall back up and plays it cool in front of me for some reason.

Welll somehow I like him, more than I've ever liked anyone before. How do you make friends with a guy like this and prompt him to ask me out?   How do you find out if he is even interested in dating at all?   By the way, we are pretty close but I am 3 years younger and he is waay protective over me whic could be a problem

My stepson (15) just moved in with us and now I am faced with being a instant parent to a teenager (I have 2 little ones).  He is very frustrating.        Problems with school (doest care/wont go/sick every other day)   Moody   Disrespecful to his dad   Expects his dad to do everything for him but gives nothing in return   Swears around my young children   Does nothing around the house   Has stomping fits if he does not get his way   Irresponsible   Breaks everything from IPods, to plates/glasses   Does not care about family, but friends are the most important thing      The list goes on.  My husband treats him calmly and gives him lectures rather then getting angry, but sometimes I feel he needs to be tougher or it will get worse.      So first off, is this normal teenager behaviour?  And is my husband correct in being easy and paitient with him?

So my boyfriend is 26 just lost his job and is currently on unemployment. He still lives at home with both his working parents...his two brothers ages 21 & 23...his brothers gf who's also 21 and her toddler who's 4.  His parents have come up with charging rent for everyone who lives there to help out in these obv tough times but they are being totally wrong with it.  First of all they want to charge everyone the same price i think about 300 a month but they are gonna charge my boyfriend the same amount as they are going to charge his brother plus his gf and toddler at the same 300 but for the 3 of them which to me isn't fair.  His brother and gf both have good paying jobs and have refused to pay anything...they have been living off his parents and even have their own room which my boyfriend has to have a curtain around the corner of the one area downstairs...so far both his brothers and gf refuse to pay but his parents have expected my bf to keep paying on his own even though he doesn't have a job...i think this is totally unfair and i need some advice on what to do and how to make his show his parents this is wrong.

20090225065826AAZrUSt	Family & Relationships;Family	Opinion of Mother's Father's others concerning teenage behavior?	Why are there so many young girls (high school age etc) on here talking about pregnancy? Do these girls really want to get pregnant?    Do they have so little ambition that all they want is to be barefoot and pregnant by some teenage boy ?   Do they just not realize all that is out there for them BEFORE having children?   This concerns me, I'd hate to know that one of these girls is dating my son! There has already been a girl at my son's school (13y/o) her mother let her date a 16 y/o and she finally left school to be "home schooled" but there were constant pregnancy rumors etc... Which I can understand, this mother allowed all sorts of unacceptable behavior to go on IN HER HOME, and was not ashamed of it being public knowledge..    I have children that are 14 (boy) and 9 (girl) and I keep a pretty tight reign on them, but my Son has little girls that send him suggestive pictures (I check his phone usage/texts etc daily... some may think that is wrong, but I pay the bill and ultimately if something happens the account is in my name therefore making me liable) But where are these girls parents? do they not care that thier children are sending pictures of them self half dressed or less to other people?     We've didcussed it and he's response is " I don't ask for them, they just send them"    It is just really concerning to me that these children are so anxious to be sexually active, promiscuous even, and they are so young!    What can we as parents, teachers etc do to prevent these kids from ruining their educations etc?    Should Schools be teaching sexual education earlier?    If you have children in this age group what preventative measures are you taking?

20090224111524AAbN0yO	Family & Relationships;Family	How to convince my parents to let me go to the science school?	I am a grade 12 student in Canada who wants to do an additional year of high school-and apply for a really interesting and useful high school program. In this program, a student takes 3 grade 12 courses in a semester  from the following: biology, physics, chemistry, linear algebra(functions), and calculus. The student is not allowed to take courses for which they have previously earned credit(so for me, it's chem). But I have not taken any of the other subjects listed above. The program goes like this: for one semester, you take 3 of those subjects at the Ontario Science Centre(which is an interactive science museum where you can try out cool scientific gadgets) every single school day. I think that would be awesome, because I love the science centre. If I knew about this last year, I would have totally gone. It's hard to get in, but my parents won't even let me apply. I think science is interesting because it affects so many aspects of our lives(the physical sciences especially). But if I don't get in, I'll go to college and major in international relations & economics. The thing is, I can go to college any time, but I can never get this experience again. In 10 years, I'll be more likely to remember this. My parents say that if I go for this they won't pay for school(but they don't mean it because they were really mad). They think this program is a waste of a year. It's called the Science school. However, I'm a year younger than my classmates-I turn 18 at the end of first year, so it's not really a waste. I could totally benefit from this program. I'm planning to ask my science teacher for help in trying to convince my parents to let me apply. How should I present my case? I want this really badly. I'm constantly begging my parents, and I end up crying when they yell at me. I even begged them to work nightshifts(but the program is free--NO cost at all). My purpose of working nightshifts is to save up money for the year of earnings that I'll miss(which is nothing compared to this wonderful experience). But  my parents are still saying no. Some people take a gap year-I just want to stay in high school for another year for this program. So please tell me...how can I present my case reasonably, maturely, and convince my parents so that I can go. What should I say and how should I act?

20090225042200AAqUFBq	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Do you think I've had a rough life...?	When I was 3 years of age, my Mother fell pregnant. But my sister, passed away at birth.   I started getting bullied by peers because of my apperance.   When I turned 4 years of age, my Father, Uncle (and all of my Dads family) had a fight and I never saw my Dads family again.   If I went to see them, they'd have police come over our house.   When I was 5, my Mother fell pregnant again. But she also lost her baby boy, Bead at birth.   When I was 6 my Grandmother (On My Mothers side) passed away from a heart attack.   When I was 8, my Mother almost died. She needed complete bedrest in the hospital for 3 weeks. If she works again she will die from a blood clot.    My parents split up. We were starving for 3 months. We had no food and only our Father could support us because he worked. I remember going to school hungry and coming home starving.    When I was 9, my Father came back.    When I was 10, I started cutting myself.    When I was 11, I got bullied worse at school.   When I was 12, my Dog that I had since I was 6 passed away and it broke my heart.   I'm now 13...
20090225055457AA0V8aW	Family & Relationships;Weddings	I need colour ideas for my wedding!?	I've decided to choose a dark purple for the bridesmaids dresses. They are strapless and satin. What colours would you suggest to go with that?         I do love vibrancy and I don't shy away from colour. I just can't think of what sort of flower colour I should choose. I'll most likely be using silk flowers for the bouquets so the type of flower is limitless.      Any ideas?

20090225073507AAluezj	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is he going to force himself to get over me and fall out of love you think? if so, how long do you think it?	will take??      My bf turned 22 and i guess had a reality check. We were dating for 2 years and he was telling me how he feels old etc.   then BOOM..we broke up but it was bitter sweet.   He tells me how much he loves me and how hard it is and how amazing i am and how much he wishes he was 25 so he could marry me right now etc.   but his mind is made up aboutthe breakup and even though i tried talking about it he gets mad. so i have to leave it   should i just leave him and give himhis space and let him figure things out?   Its so tough. I saw him 2 weeks ago (we broke up on feb 1st) and he cant stop hugging me and treating me like his gf again when we see each other...open my door, kiss my hands, my nose etc.   We are also both in ourr 4th year of university as well   Honestly, the relationship was so mature and great. Even he admitted that when he was talking about it..sad ofcourse.   We hvant talked since Valentines day and its hard because we talked everyday for a year. I know he still loves me and still cares. The last 2 times i saw him he couldnt let go of me and couldnt stop telling me that yet didnt want to talk about why he wants this.   should i really just leave this up to him? Let him figure this out on his own adn give him space? But how long :(? and do you guys know of anyone that did come back to you? I asked him if there was someone    else just because i know how he feels and just couldnt figure it out   he looked at me and siad that he can't even think about something like that then I asked him how he would feel if I liked someone else later on and he said he wouldnt be able to handle it how much it would hurt   I have not called him or texted him to cry about it or beg back   im not that kind of girl at all & he knows it. I am giving him his space since he doenst even know himself. am i doing the right thing and   should i just wait til he contacts me when he is ready no matter how logn it takes?

We have a lot in common, yes music, tattoos, skateboarding. He's already told his mom about me and she's fine. I look younger for my age so we look fine together. He's afraid I'll leave for someone older and i'm afraid he'll leave for someone younger.  He says he just wants me and I know I just want him. We get along GREAT. Haven't even had sex yet. He's very responsible, has been through alot and seems much older than his age. No one would know. Kids? I have a 3 year old and i think it's great that he's so good with her. I would never hinder his life, he knows that i would only encourage him to go to school, college, and do the twenty something thing. But, he's crazy about me and I'm crazy about him. Neither of us  has ever felt this way before.

At first, on the bus, out of the corner of my eye, every now and then, I saw him glance over at me and as soon as I look at him, he looks away fast, and sometimes would duck his head down and rub it with his head. He comes across sort of shy.   Then, I found out his name. I started talking to him some. I would say hi and he would say hey and ask me how I am doing. And whenever I talk to him, he gets a big smile and laughs. I said something stupid. I said sorry and he said its cool.   I know his friend who told me that he used to run cross country and Ben is in ROTC. He wants to join the air guard. Ben is so so nice and kind and funny. he is a christian who doesn't cuss. he looks really good in his uniform. And I told him all this.   I asked him to hang out. he said he couldn't because he works. So I asked him to eat lunch at school with me. he said, "UNFORTUNATELY I can't". I am so confused. It feels so right. He is like so perfect for me. I just can't tell if he likes me or not. I think he does.   how do you tell if a sorta shy guy(that isn't shy around friends) likes you?   how do you tell if he doesn't?   I am afraid to be rejected, and i don't want to br pushy. tell me what to do! HELP!!!!!!

20090225043029AAxSLHj	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ex-girlfriend jealousy!!!?	I'm in love with a man that's, sweet, affectionate, Intelligent, responsible funny and incredibly handsome. We have a long distance relationship and when he's with me he knows exactly how to make me feel like i'm on top of the world. Seriously if you could see me now i'm positively glowing. Only thing is when i'm not with him (which is most of the week) i often find myself thinking that he is being emotionally unfaithful. He has this ex-girlfriend that he's still very close to he goes to all her parties and invites her when hes going out clubbing sometimes. I'm finding myself growing increasingly jealous. i'm not usually a very jealous person but when it comes to her i can't help it. They did not break on bad terms and she was that first love (special girl). I know he loves me but how can i stop this jealousy as without it we'd be so much happier.      Xx

20090225071539AATlmSr	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I act around this girl that's rejected me 3 years ago?	About 3 years ago I did a really silly thing: I asked out a girl out of the blue after only haven spoken to her on a few occasions, and told her I'd had a crush on her for a year. I was also nervous, twitchy (couldn't hold a conversation and sometimes offensive around her (once I told her she seemed intimidating), and I'd annoy her on msn. At a party I was quite drunk and basically followed her around, then gave her an ultimatum via email - to speak to me at school.      This is probably the stupidest most selfish thing I've ever done in my life, since then I haven't spoken to her (once she complimented me on my shirt - then I sent her a message on email saying I'm sorry about how much of a fool I was basically).      Since then I've had 2 girlfriends and I've changed - I'm different in every area of my life and I've improved alot, academically, socially and spiritually. I'm due to see this girl soon at a small dinner (as she's a friend of friend). How do I act around her - I would just be myself, but do you think there's a chance after all that she could like me as a friend or more? If not more . . then I guess I'd be happy to wipe all my memory of her before and just 'get to know her' because she's now in my social circle and she seems like a nice person (when I ignore the attraction I used to have to her).

My BF and I have just recently got a new flat together, and then he got made redundant, so until he gets another job I am the sole earner. He is really down, and when I get home from work he has been in all day and is bored and frustrated and takes it out on me, at weekends he is okay because we are both busy doing things. Also it has affected our sex life, since he has been made redundant he just isn't interested which is then affecting me because I not used to not having it and then selfishly start to panic that things are not okay between us. I am also stressed as trying to make myself indispendable at work so I don't lose my job, and I feel like I am about to crack. What can I do to make him happier aside from creating a job out of thin air? Also for us to keep enjoying each other's company through this difficult time?

20090225074248AAu5X0t	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Need help dealing with my husband.?	For a while now it seems like my husband and I are developing a parent- child relationship. He has a decent career, and we very rarely have money issues. We have four children together who are awesome kids. Our families are helpful and supportive for the most part, and we have a comfortable home life and sexual relationship. So please help me to understand why he is so lazy, huffs and puffs when I ask him to help around the house, makes excuses for his attitude toward me and the kids, and falls into times of bad hygiene? I keep putting the burden on myself because he kind of has anxiety and gets down really easily but sometimes I feel like telling him that I'm not his mother. I know that I'm enabling him by doing it all myself but I can't let my kids pick up his bad habits. I really want to make this work, but I'm at my wits end. I've tried writing him a note, sitting down and talking, threatening to leave, sleeping in another room... nothing ever works. All I want is for him to change his attitude and stop viewing everything as an obligation. Anyone have any POSITIVE suggestions?

20090225074302AA9smxi	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	If your unhappy in a relationship you just break up?	I'm a little confused about some things. I'm a guy, only had 1 relationship, and I'll tell you why. It was GREAT at times, but other times, I really wanted to date other people, and she had things about her i really didnt like. I'd be extremely annoyed, she'd have problems i didnt want to deal with, and i just wanted to get away from her by the end.       But i always tried to help her in her time of need, isnt that what good b/f's do? B/S. That only drove me insane. We finally broke up. But I'm trying to get some perspective on things. See, she always acted like she'd be so devastated if i broke up w/her. That kept me trapped not wanting to hurt her feelings. By that point, life just felt really shitty. I've talked to female friends, and they're much more mature about things, saying i should just break up.  So... you only stay in a  relationship if you're happy? wow, life would be really easy then.
20090225075142AAfusTE	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My girlfriend got kissed by another dude. what do i do?	WE were fighting on the phone and we suggested a BREAK BUT DIDNT GO ON IT. The dude has kissed her when she was waking up on the side of her mouth like half on the cheek but she was like half a sleep and rolled over mumbled "no" and went back to bed. later that day after we almost breaked, She was at the hotel for a hockey tournament balling her eyes out.She said she was heaving and shaking because she thought she was gonna lose me.the dude held her while she explained how much she loved me and how she didnt wanna lose me and how she lost her VIRGINITY to me. The dude propped her head up and kissed her for 3 seconds and tryed to slip tongue in and my girlfriend put her arms out and backed away. She said she puckered her lips out of reaction. she said she was completely innocent and didn't want this to happen. She said her head was spinning and didn't think the guy would do that. She then realized that what happened when she woke up earlier that day wasnt a dream and the dude actually did kiss her and texted the dude said that was a mistake and deleted his number and never wants to talk to him again.i mean who kisses someone half asleep or when they are crying there eyes out about their boyfriend. DOes her story sound just? CAn being that upset make you blind to the outside world..is that forgivable? I mean is it cheating. Because i can forgive a cheater..I do love her im just hurt.
20090225075422AAAdcXz	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I want my ex back. How do I get him?	ok so I dated this kid alex for about a year (on and off). It's been weeks sense we started talking again and were actually getting along. I knew about my friend justin having a thing for alex (they are both bi). Yesterday I overheard my friends talking about them and turns out they both have been getting pretty sexual with each other. I miss alex more than anything. Yesterday alex and justin got in a big fight too, about how alex did so much for him when justin didn't care he just wanted action. How do I explain to alex that justin isn't worth it and bring alex back into my arms?

20090225075551AAStJlC	Family & Relationships;Friends	What should we do now?	My best friend and me have had a massive argument with one of our other best friends, now everything has got out of hand and she can't come up to our faces to say anything its always come over here or she gets other people to say things to us. Today she told us to go to fatfighters and we took it as a joke and made fun of it for the rest of the day. We got on the bus to get home when she and her nan she has to have because she got into a fight and needs to have a "bodyguard" got onto the bus and sat behind us so we carried on laughing about fatfighters so nothing was directed at her personally when my best friend was going to get off the bus the nan held her, came right to her face and said "if you have got something to say to me say it to her" which doesn't make sense anyway because we haven't said anything to her anyway and my best friend was freaked out because it was the girls nan telling her that and not the girl herself (as usual) so we were wondering what should we do about it. (there is no point saying ignore her because we can't because she comes up to us if we do) sorry this is so long xx

20090224132423AAuO14c	Family & Relationships;Family	Important. please help.?	so on the 20th a kind of big event happened...      my mom and I got in a huge argument and in the middle of it she threw a tool belt thing at me and then a cooler, then she grabbed me by the pony tail and pulled me onto the ground and continued to hit me on the head with her hand, then she grabbed my pony tail again and held a fist up to me but i wiggled away and then ran out of my house. I said to my mom "you basically abused me" and all she said was "I know" .      I dont know what to do ! Is this serious? should I tell someone? Or is it just a way of discipline?       The only other times she "hit" me was when she slapped me and when she would hit me with a belt and what not, but I thought those were just discipline things..      Helpful info maybe- I am sixteen.

20090224232129AAQLojP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	URGENT: Should I bail or should I stick to it?	I wanted very badly to stay out of stinkin' prom drama, but here it is:      Basically, one of my friends (Jon) asked me a couple of weeks ago. (Prom is April 4th.) I knew that he had feelings for me that I didn't share, but I had always been told to accept any offer that wasn't from a creepo, and he's a nice guy. Also, I have a really special (non-sexual, non-dating) relationship with a guy from another school (Kyle), but I didn't feel comfortable asking him since (don't hate me for this!) I'm a girl, and he lives awhile away.      Today, I heard that Jon was going out with a girl named Mindy. I thought that it was really cute, and since I couldn't tell him myself, I had a friend let him know that I was perfectly fine if he went with her, even if I couldn't get a date. I mentioned to Kyle (just in light conversation) that I might be dateless, and even my family said that I should go with him. However, that same day Jon talked to me and told me that he had broken up with Mindy to just be friends, and that he had feelings for me and still wanted to go to prom with me. I didn't want to bail, so I said that was fine, but clarified that it was just as friends. But then, right after that, I was talking to my close friend Kyle (who- note- is not going to his own prom, and has been having a little bit of a rough time), and he laughed that we should've gone together!      I don't want to bail on Jon. But I want to let Kyle have a chance to have fun, and even more so, not be under so much pressure with someone who likes me much more than I like him and does not share all of my convictions regarding relationships. Also, I do feel bad for Mindy; she's alone now. I'm having second thoughts. Should I be loyal and trustworthy and go with Jon, or should I talk to Jon and go with Kyle? If the later, how should I explain this? (Ex: Should I mention Kyle and/or Mindy at all?)      Please help. I want to fix this mess ASAP. :-(

20090224233758AAgPqbT	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Which one of us Does she Like?	Info about me:   I'm a teen.   I go to a school where I need to be on a bus for about 1.5 hrs.         My girlfriend and I broke up a while back, and since then I have developed feelings for another girl. She catches my bus, but goes to a different school, I go to 1 of the 3 schools our bus takes to school everyday, and she goes to a different one to me.   It seemed like just an average day, and since we're friends, she sits with me some days. The bus picked up my school first, (like it usually does), and then hers next. She came over and sat with me, and I asked her how her day had been. She replied with: "Do you really want to know?"   "Of course" I said.   "Well, I don't really want to tell you" she says with half a smile, and the conversation slips into an awkward silence.   About a minute later, the bus picks up the 3rd and final school, and a guy gets on who I don't really know well, but seems nice enough.   She immediately goes to sit with him.   They sit together and talk for the rest of the trip, (far from me), until she gets off.    "Bye, Kate!" I yell as she gets off, but appears either not to hear me (or just ignores me) says goodbye to the other guy, and gets off.      Before this day, her friends (Which are mine, too) all tell me that she likes me, and still do, and I must admit, I thought she did for a while too. She always laughs at my jokes, (even if they're bad) and hugs me sometimes too.   But after this day, I'm not sure anymore.   Please Help!!!

20090225061341AAkgRJ4	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Open bar/cash bar question?	Ok, so I realize that generally a cash bar is not a good thing and everyone seems to say that if you can't afford an open bar, than don't even have a bar.       That said, we cannot afford an open bar, BUT our guests would still appreciate the option of buying their own alcohol (cash bars are actually the norm and acceptable in our families). Not offering them the chance to even have alcohol would be an annoyance to our guests more-so than a cash bar would be.      So, my question is this: Is it ok to buy a keg or two (when it's gone, it's gone) and offer them just beer (a lot of beer drinkers, hardly any wine drinkers) and soda/juice, AND have a cash bar for everything else?

20090202100809AAoj7tk	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My husband's ex-girlfriend tries so hard to keep in touch with his whole family?	The girl my husband dated before me-well, we had some issues with her. This was about four years ago. They broke up because she cheated on him-with another guy, and several girls. She decided she was fully gay soon after they broke up. She just wouldn't leave him alone though-continued calling and whatnot. This girl has never acknowledged me as his girlfriend or wife. Ever. Every few months since then she sends him a message on Myspace. It would be okay if it was normal "how are you" talk. Instead she says things like she misses the old days and they used to have so much fun together, oh I miss you, blah blah. She knows I don't want her contacting him-this has been going on for years. He doesn't reply to her, but the thing is-she freaking leaves comments on his entire family's pages. His mom, sister and brother. Keep in mind this is an ex from over four years ago. We are married now, for almost two years, with a little girl and another on the way. They dated for less than a year. Isn't it time for her to stop? I could understand if her messages were simply to say hi, as she was friends with his sister.. not really his mother or brother obviously.. but they are always about, or asking about, him. Why is she holding on like this? It's really irritating and disrespectful-her messages will say things like "I know your wife doesn't want us talking." She knows I hate her and still continues trying to contact him.. and then talking to his family.. this freaks me out. Does she believe she was so important in his life that she needs to update everyone in his family every few months? When he doesn't reply to her is usually when she starts contacting them... isn't it time to stop messing with your ex*boyfriend* when he is now a husband and father? I mean come on, you cheated on him, and now you're a lesbian..    Before conclusions are drawn- I know he doesn't contact her or reply, because every time she sends a message, he shows me and then gets rid of it.. her message to his mom mentioned she hadn't talked to him in almost two years. (They had run into each other.)
20090202102127AAtbpDr	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Is it normal to feel guilt when you fear losing someone you love?	Sometimes I think I only annoy people while I am alive, but then when I die they will come out the woodwork and act all sad as if they didn't want me to leave in the first place. I think that is a bunch of nonsense. All I seem to do is find new ways to get people angry or neglect them so maybe going to sleep won't be such a bad idea after all. Is it normal to want to protect everyone you love from dying, yet want to die yourself when you are plagued with guilt for all your misdeeds? I imagine everyone I love flatlining in the hospital because of my stupidity, accidents, & conflicts resulting in emotional pain for them: being late for work, breaking a dish, losing something, snapping back rudely, or other things that make me feel bad about myself and others feel angry with me. At leas when I rest in peace I won't be a threat to anyone anymore. They might cry, but then they will move on and be glad it's NOT them (that they are not permanently asleep) like I am. And sometimes I think that will be so refreshing to have no more pain.

20090225061505AAudmSe	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Have you ever gotten married for the wrong reasons or know someone that has?	My guy friend and were talking about marriage and relationships. Anywho, he said that if he just got married and had a family all his problems would be solved. That's all he talks about is getting married. Every female he meets he puts her up on a pedestal then it always blows up in his face. I told him to stop rushing and get to know the person first. He says he kinda jealous that his brother (20 yrs old) who is 6 yrs younger than him is married and has a son. I guess I'm different I like to take relationships SLOW, because want to know who I'm dealing with. If and when I do get married I only want to get married once. My biggest fear is marrying a psycho.

20090202101446AAkvtlj	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Mother in law HORROR, pls help, I promise to be brief?	Hi guys, I'll lay out my problem in line format in the hopes it would make it easier and less of a bore to read      I've been with my husband for 14 years   We have 3 young children   I was stupid at 17 and married him even though he and his mother smoked weed TOGETHER and she treated me like dirt. (12yrs ago)   When my children was born she was there for me   She has since tried to be nice but has never apologized to me   She is money hungry (I even paid for her to move out of her house 13 years ago)   My husband no longer does that, he has a great career and more importantly is an extremely devoted loving father who helps with the kids and the house   The problem is, I don't TRUST and I resent the heck out of his mother no matter how fake nice she pretends to be, she doesn't even call her grandkids but pretends she loves them so much. whatever.   Anyway, due to this and mistakes of the past, she is regrettably my mother in law and my husband (albeit a great spouse and dad) is a momma's boy.      Why can't HE see what a horrible person his mother is. WHO DOES DRUGS WITH THEIR CHILD??      He still loves her to death and was mad at me because he finally realized I don't want anything to do with her anymore and I don't want my kids going over there even if she stopped years ago. (so she says)      He says I should never try to deny her the right to see her grandchildren especially when she made a cake for him (this past weekend) but I honestly didn't even care enough about her to feel bad they didn't go. (The kids didn't know what she did)      OK, not so brief but if anyone can read through this I'd thank you with all my heart. What do you think, I could use some advice. Thanks guys
20090225061814AAftKmi	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Pleaseeee help me get my ex boyfriend back?	hi :) first of all if you're going to tell me to forget him and move on then please don't answer.      He broke up with me 2 weeks ago coz he said we were too erratic; he cant cope with the stress right now from his final year at uni. We were only together for 2 and a half months.  Right before that day we were happy together 80% of the time, but I overreacted to something he did so he came over to talk and I threw a negative, childish, sulk so he dumped me. I think he cared for me; he cried when he dumped me and has been a bit depressed lately. he said he still wanted to see me and talk as friends. So i tried it for a week but it got too much for me and every time we talked I ended up being overemotional. I asked him to review the break-up and see if it was what he really wanted coz he seemed so confused. Finally I asked if we couldn't talk for a while so he has proper space to think it over, and I needed space to clear my thoughts, he said ok.       However the next day I texted him asking him if he'd been cheating on me, 5 mins later I regretted it and sent him another text saying sorry and I really need space now, im confused forget i said it, and asked him not to text back.  Then the next day I said to him on MSN "I cant not talk to you its too hard" then said loads of soppy things, then coz he still wasn't answering i said "all i do is pour my heart out and chase you and you obv don't give a **** I'm sick of it" and blocked him.  Since then we haven't talked.       My mum said I should just carry on not talking to him (i left him the msn message on sunday) till Friday to give us both space, then on Friday I should go round to his unannounced and sort things out in person. She said if I leave it too long it might be to late to try and win him back.       What should I do? xx

20090202091830AAyL2Fw	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Which of these decor ideas do you like and any more suggestions?	Sorry this is a little long, I don't have photos so trying to describe as much as I can. Our colors are Black, Silver and Purples (my dress is lavender and will probably use a couple deeper shades in decor). The venue has navy walls, the tables and chairs are black, and there are large white round paper lanterns in groups of three over the tables for lighting as well they are dispersed over the dance floor area I do not have pictures but it works out that there are two levels  split by a couple steps, the bottom is a stage and a dance floor, with couches lined up against the walls, and the upper is where the bar is and where the tables are. It is quite ideal.     There is also a separate lounge area with couches and a pool table, the favour table will be there because it is the main entry and exit. The favours will be displayed on silver serving trays, we are thinking of making the archway that's between the lounge and seating area more decorative by adding silver balloons, there are silver frames already on the walls and we will be temporarily replacing the current photos with photos of us (black and white).    Still torn what I would like to do for centrepieces, I like these because they are unique http://offbeatbride.com/2009/01/diy-orna... I would do them in purples though not that blue.    Contemplating bunches of lavender but worried the smell would get too strong    I'm not a fan of real flowers unless they are very simple like three at most, I would use potted flowers as they could be given away afterwards and last, was thinking of alternating potted white and purple orchids on the tables    The venue has black and white linens (probably would use white to lighten up that area), and these mirrored circles that they put two tealights on it is simple but pretty, I would just like to add some personal touches for our occasion  Any suggestions/pictures would be appreciated, I feel like I am overthinking this

20090225045128AAGkC86	Family & Relationships;Family	Possible Live In Family:?	I kinda wonder why some single moms that have 4 or more children find it so hard to get up early or work multiple positions. Don't they realize that their children can only depend on them, and them alone. I posted a quesiton about a friend of mine with four children who is visiting me for a few days because her sister's apartment does not have lights. Well My daughter and I have to wake up at 4am for me to get to work for 6:30am. I have not made her a key yet so that means that everyone has to be leaving at 5:30. She and her children have spend the night for 2 nights. This morning she said she does'nt think she can do the 4am thing and that she will continue to stay with her sister. Making a long story short she has been trying to be in school instead of finding work. Why would she rather go to school that get a job knowing she has four children. Why does she find it hard to work real hard for her kids. I love my daughter and would work as much as I can without neglecting her to provide. Why do some mothers seem to not care that their children don't have a home?

Should I Tell Her I Like Her Or Ask Her Out      She like always say hi when she sees me .(SHE GAVE ME A NICKNAME ITS NOTHING BAD JUST MY NAME SHORTENED AND ALWAYS CALLS ME BY IT)..    In Class last year if the teacher calls my name she would turn around look at me and smile and even now she still doesSometimes she would tell me she loves me but i wasnt sure if shes serious because her friends say it to. We talk mostly on msn and barely at school, but her and her friends always get excited when i show up. We are both 17,& a few months ago without telling me one of my friends ask one of her friends who she likes and her friend said sum guy from another school, then he asked another friend and the friend said she likes no one and is waiting for that special guy, which now makes no sense to me and im confused.       (Earlier this year she told me to write I luv her in my msn nick cause it would be funny:S then the she did the same for hers. ppl started asking us if were dating then she said she when I asked her why she removed her nick she said because she was tired of people asking if we were dating:S, On facebook she left a message on facebook and had bro in it.      We started talking less after prom & for A week in the summer she had a Bf but I didnt really think she liked him that much because her msn name was the same while his was he loved her and less than a week after she broke up with him.This summer we didn't really talk until she left me a message on facebook telling"Wats Up Long Lost Home Dog I miss U with Smily Faces ,      Recently She started saying Hi to me less but in gym I see her looking at me alot, .and recently when she says hi she makes her best friend say it to, also if she sees me talking with sum1 she will wait till Im done and she will say she woulda said hi earlier but didnt want to interpt me,& when I walk bye her class she will call me and wave with her cute smile:).       *I was at my bustop 2day and when she saw me she yelled my name so then I went to go talk 2 her , she then asked me if I get annoyed that she says Hi everytime she sees me and I said no its np.

20090225054314AAXDtZF	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Am I asking too much of my husband?	My husband has never been one for showing his feelings much but just recently its like he's made of ice.    I've had some rough issues to deal with, my father was seriously ill for one yet the whole time, not once did my husband put his arms around me and show me any affection. He never hugs me, a kiss is a quick peck on the cheek when he gets in from work and thats about it. He never touches me in bed anymore, most nights he never even says goodnight, let alone anything else.    If I want any affection I have to go to him and I'm starting to feel like a real saddo going after him all the time. I've tried to talk to him about it but he just says "I never have shown my feelings that much" no maybe not, but I'm starting to feel like he doesn't even have any feelings. All I really want is to feel loved and at times just have him put his arms around me and tell me everything will be okay.    Is that too much to ask of him? or is it a man thing and all guys are like this?    Help?      And I'm certain he's not having an affair, I almost wish he was because it would answer a lot.

He admitted to drinking.  We should have stayed a while longer, but we didn't.  They were looking for people leaving when they stopped serving alcohol.  Lesson DEFINITELY learned )I really would like to get married in the church I went to as a child, but I'm nervous to ask as I don't want him to immediately ask to meet him.  I even use to live for 6 months with the pastor, and his daughter babysat me for 4 years.  I haven't been to his church steadily since I had my daughter at 16.  I go maybe 3-4 times a year ever since.  I think I felt like I let them down, but now I am a senior in college.  I know we will have to go through marital counseling.  That's something we both have decided.        Would you just suck it up and ask my minister now if we could have ceremony in church?  Should I just ask his best friend's father?      What would you do?      My fiance knows the minister's children, but I don't think he's ever met him.
20090225054446AAAXbid	Family & Relationships;Friends	How do I convince my friends I'm not gay?	they think I'm gay for 2 reasons because I think you get more out of a relationship with your girlfriend rather then masturbate and look at porn for hours at a time and because one of my ex girlfriends came up to me crying and in a huge mess she asked if I thought she was sexy and then asked if I would ***** her I told her that ******* her was not the right thing and that she really just needed to talk to some one so (unlucky for me this took place in the hall at school by all my friends) I skipped class for the day and just brought her over to my house and talked to her and helped her over her problems we are now really good friends but ever since I turned down  meaningless sex and because I don't really like looking at porn that makes me the gay guy I really didn't care at first but some of my friends are taking the jokes to far and either I'm going to beat the **** out of them (2 people to be more specific) or they are going to stop the jokes any way to convince them Im not gay?

My partner is Lebanese Muslim and I am not lebanese. When we got together he pretty much wanted a person who has never had sex before. Now he is aware that I had a bf before him and a one night stand. Which at the start of the relationship nearlly didnt let us get where we are. But recently I have been feeling guilty I havent been totally honest. I have in fact slept with 6 people in total and one of the guys is my partners worst enemy I have always used protection and I no I have no diseases. I am sure he has a past and he wont disclose anything to me. I am in fact older then him by a few years. Now all this happened a year before I got with my partner.

That is my past and I have the right to keep it to myself. Please help as to whether i should have told him in the first place????????

20090225061319AAmjdJi	Family & Relationships;Family	Is it a strange relationship?10 points!!!!!!!!!!?	I've got a teacher where I study with whom I've always had a very good relationship.I've known her for 6 years,and we use to talk a lot.   The thing is that after a lot of personal problems I had,I've realised that she's controlling me more than she used to do,asking other teachers if I improve or not,watching me,etc...The other day I had an exam near her house and she offered me to sleep there with her..or everytime I said something about my ex she puts a long face...   I've always thought that she could have developed a maternal instinct,since she has no children and she's not married either.But I'm not a child(I'm 24) so I don't know what her feelings are.But I'm sure that she hasn't sexual feelings towards me.   This is my last year in that centre however she told me we would still be in contact...or that she could give me particular classes so that I pass the exam I want to do next year

20090225045648AAa3nT9	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ex's are so confusing? guys or girls advice?	I have an ex who broke up with me a bit more than a year a go. It was hard and painful because I was very ignorant of relationships and i never thought he'd be the one to end it, if it ever did end. It was a shock when he broke up with me (stupid reason as well - we both acknowledged the relationship had slowed down and we were both busy in senior year, so that was his reason - he didn't even try to maintain the relationship...he may as well have just said 'i'm bored of you')       Anyway! So he's friend with my friends, so we've hung out for this entire time, but when i spoke to him the first time after the break up (casual talk) he just kinda nodded and was probably freaked out and completely ignored me and wouldn't go into a circle of conversation if i was there etc and he never spoke to me or even message me on birthdaya etc (as i did for him). It was like i didn't exist and i gave up trying, and i gave him space (not that i was in his face beforehand)      Now just suddenly he's started to join in circles when i'm there and we've spoken small words to each other, nothing major. What do you think is he's deal? I just wanted to be his friend after the break up and it was impossible, so i left it and now it seems he's trying to be friends again. But why? and why now!? Was he freaked out that maybe i liked him after the break up?      GUYS PLEASE HELP, i just need some closure and opinions.

20090225044908AAML3RS	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	This may seem like an odd question.....?	considering a relationship should all be about caring and sharing, but do you ever feel like your boyfriend/partner is begruding about any money he has to spend on you? Hes great in every other way, and we've also been together for quite a while. I love to treat him to little things, sometimes bigger things, depending on what spare money I have. However, I've always felt that any money spent on me, by him, is spent begrudgingly. For example, if he pays for movie tickets or a meal out, it always seems like such an effort to him. (i.e. if I was to whip my wallet out and pay for it, he'd gladly let me and you could almost see the change in his mood because he doesn't have to pay.) When I treat him, hes always happy, yet when its his turn to treat me, it almost seems like a chore for him as hes taking his wallet out. Its hard to explain, but sometimes it makes me feel like he doesn't care about me enough if he appears to be so begrudging about it. Can anyone help me to understand this? And what can I do to make him change and pay for things without a second thought, because thats what I do and it never bothers me. I can't help but think its selfishness on his behalf.
20090225053506AAw73h8	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Who should I listen to?	Having asked this before, I still don't know what to do, so I'll just re-post the whole thing.      So after having been chucked by my girlfriend Sarah, I moved in with a girl - we had to pretend we were a couple in order to get the flat - named Daisy. Six months later, Sarah, who had been betraying me with Duane who I thought was my friend, and me were talking in a diner, and she said she split up with Duane.      Anyway, we agreed to meet back later this week. Happy as I was, I told Daisy I thought Sarah wanted me to move back in with her, and that we were to sort out the details later this week. I thought she'd be happy, but she was a little bit angry at me, because she said that if I was too stupid to see the mistake I was going to make, someone, a friend, she, had to point it out to me.      In any case, we had a little row and we called each other names, and I told her that I was stupid enough and big enough to make my own mistakes. She said that Sarah obviously did, and that she won't wish me luck on something that could be bad for me.      I don't understand her, I thought she'd be glad for me, and now she's constantly on my back. What the hell is going on ?

20090225051121AAKDuqZ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why did she put her clothes back on during sex?	I got a lil story here that I need to get off my chest and possibly find some theories, LOL...so anyway, I was at work tonight (I'm a server in a fine dining restaurant/bar) and a couple of my buddies come in and I am introduced to one of the most gorgeous girls I've ever seen that was with them. The entire night she would lock eyes with me, and follow me...at one point she started making out with me in the back where the restrooms are, and I had to stop her since I could get in trouble. Anyway, to make a long story short, she invites me back to her hotel with a couple of other friends. Things start getting hot and she suggests we go in the bathroom for more privacy. Foreplay was great, then we started having sex on the sink which she was really into it, but 10 minutes later she starts putting her bra back on and pushes me away. Then she puts her clothes back on. I was SPEECHLESS. I didn't want to get mad so I stayed quiet and did the same, got dressed. All night it was like nothing happened. One thing that was weird is she kept texting someone, maybe a bf or ex-bf that recently broke her heart? God, I feel like such an idiot, that hurts to do that to a man! Ladies any theories?
20090225051501AA1xwYZ	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My husband and I have been together over 25 years and have been talking about spicing things up.  A threesome.?	At first this was a fantasy, but now it is sounding VERY exciting. He suggested that I play up to a coworker(Male) who has been kidding me for ever about taking me away for a weekend.  My husband thinks I should see my friend at work a couple of times first to see how far I can go before we try the threesome.  I get excited just thinking about it and really think it would spice up our lives for a while. If it works out he said it would  make him feel better if someone was around to watch after me when he travels. He said nothing could be more exciting than to hear about my adventures when he returned from a business trip.  Should we really try this?  We do have a good relationship and feel it would not hurt to do this for awhile.

I'm 26 and this girl I met is 24. We went on a first date to a casual coffee shop for an early meeting.It was good and I felt good vibes. I called her 3 days later for a second date. She said yes, and I recommended a place that was nice, fair-priced and casual. She texts me last night and now out of the blue wants to go somewhere really expensive. Is she testing me to see if I am a push over, or is this going to be my last meal? I like her and I think she likes me, its just complex to try to understand what her intentions are. I need advice from you women out there, on your impression if you did this to a guy and if you really like  him or just using him? I really like this girl, and I am sticking by my rule to build a  relationship with her and that is not to not sleep together so soon but get to know one another and build an attachment before any sexually physical things happens.

20090225061047AAvnQBp	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can I talk to my girlfriend about our different values?	My girlfriend and I have been together for just less than a year now and things are starting to get more serious. I'm in love with her, we have incredible chemistry and want to be with her for the long haul, but I have a nagging fear that our values and aspirations might be too different to make things work.      I have a public service job that pays next to nothing but fulfills a sense of social purpose, which is my primary goal in life. I have ambition, but it is not fueled my monetary gain. In accordance, my material needs are very simple. I buy my clothes at thrift stores or on sale, eat on the cheap, purchase almost no consumer goods and spend my excess income on doing things with her.      She is more the opposite. She is paid well in a corporate job but wants to earn more, spends oodles on shoes and clothes she doesn't need and fantasizes about luxury apartments. She does not seem to share my desire to make a difference in the world, at least not genuinely.      This has never been an overt problem. She is not the type to pout or ask for things I can't afford, and I avoid passing judgments on her lifestyle. But it does sometimes come up in more subtle ways, and I'm worried that if we start to plan a future together it will become a much bigger problem. How can I talk to her about it without sounding righteous or risking what we have?

20090225061759AAmfbMU	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	(New Jersey) Tough Divorce question. Please help?	hi, my best friend Jaila is married to this total jerk. She and her husband have been seperated and not living together for over a year. They have a 2 year old son together but he hasn't seen him since early january. He hardly ever comes to see his son, period! The husband also has a daughter from his previous wife. So here's the problem, he only gives Jaila about $50 a week for his son which i personally think is ridiculous!!!! She wants to get him out of her life, divorce him, and make him pay child support. He refuses to sign the papers only because he doesnt want to pay child support and take care of his son. He has a really good job now so there is no need to be so cheap. Is she stuck in this marriage? How can she go about getting a divorce? Were from NJ so i dont know if the laws are different here, but any info will really help. Thanks a lot!!!
20090225062114AAA1IkA	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is my husband a jerk or is he having a mid-life crisis?	I consider myself a decent wife. I cook everyday for him and his parents who live a block away. I work full time (about 9.5 hours a day) and we share all bills and mortgage. On top of that, I pay for all groceries, his clothes and other household stuff. I come home every day, later than he does, and cook dinner. After that, I have to clean up and pack his breakfast and lunch for the next day. Sometime, I peel oranges for him while he watches TV. Lately, he is complaining that he is too fat. Trust me, he is 5'7", 147lbs, 32waist and goes to the gym at least 3 to 4 times a week. He said his metabolic rate is down now that he is older and starts to have fat deposit around his waist. So, now every time we eat, he will complain that he is getting fat. Last night, he was very unhappy during dinner and I asked him why since I thought it's work-related. He said he is getting fat, again. I asked him if I should just stop cooking at night and he screamed at me for making such a big fuss. It was really hurtful because I have a long day at work too and is trying to do the best as a wife and a daughter-in-law. P.S. his parents love me and I do love them too.   Is he being a jerk or is it mid-life crisis or is he having an affair? But he is home all the time after work.   I have try to do stuff myself around the house, cleaning, taking care of stuff since it's hard to ask him to do anything. He easily gets annoyed if I ask him to do something. I have to find ways to make him want to do it himself. And even if he says he will do something, it will take another month or year for him to do it. So, I gave up asking.   We have married for 9 years and have gone through really rough patches and seen therapist, which helps a lot already.    I am tired and disappointed. Sometimes, I think I am his maid or slave more than his wife.   He told me just the night before that I was so good to him and he wishes he can do better. Yet, he yelled at me the next day.   Is that it? Is it what marriage is like for everyone or just us? I used to be hopefully romantic and extremely happy person. Now, I always have to remind myself not to have expectation so I won't get disappoinment.    I just need to vent a bit and hear some advice from people who can be objective about this,   Thanks

20090202102011AAn0O6X	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Pedophile or Just Loves Children?	I am a foster parent and recently a 16 year old girl was placed in my home.  She was in foster care before but was adopted by a couple. The adopted parents appear to be in their late 50's or early 60's.       Her adopted father doesn't work but substitute teaches in the public school system and is active in church.  Mom works a daytime job.      The 16 year old is leveled headed, works, saves money and makes good grades.  She became concerned because the couple behavior toward her started changing.  They began making statements such as she didn't deserve to be part of the family, she was worthless and told her to leave their home.  Because of their remarks the 16 year old had herself removed from her home via child services.        The problem is she thinks her adopted father has "strange" tendencies such as approaching young girls about 5 or 6 in age in public and telling them how pretty they are and in some instances he has touched the child.  On a recent vacation he went up to little girls and started talking to them and then had his wife to take pictures of him and the little girl.  He has the photos on his computer but has them in the same location as the vacation pictures but he looks at them often.  She says he also does this at events like basketball games where there are young children.        The adopted couple adopted a 5 year old less than a year ago and the 16 year old is concerned for his welfare since she is no longer in the home.  Also, the couple is trying to adopt two young boys ages 4 and 5.        SHOULD SHE/WE BE CONCERNED?

Hello I am a Joint Tenant of a 2 bed Council Property. My ex-partner(joint tenant) ditched me and moved to America with our son and new boyfriend whom she is now married to. She has been gone now for over 2 years. My worry is that she may one day return and try to re-access the property with her husband. She may even be pregnant or have had another child in the 2 years. Would this give her a good case to re-enter the property and if so, what would the Council want me to do? My reason for staying in the propert is that it is a place that I would like to have access tom my son if/when she returns. The Council have so far said they have no objection to me remaining in the propert and have accepted she is no longer living there. I now recently have a new partner but we are not yet living together. Please please help as i feel the clock is ticking and I am unable to decorate or feel at home as longs as this matters remains outstanding. Thank you.

I have a small white fabric rose (about the size of the tip of my finger) that is from my aunts wedding when I was small. I want to use it as my something old, but I am not sure how to add it. My flowers are Gerber daisies, so it can't go with those. My hair will be down and curly but I will be wearing a veil. Should I just glue it to the top of my veil? I don't want to just sew it into the inside of my dress... Any ideas?

20090203144606AABqYFy	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	This is the first time I've ever met someone that can't answer questions. How do you deal with that?	She is a new grad student and she is so freakin' weird. We all have to laugh because any time we ask her a question she has trouble giving anything even resembling a straight answer. Then if you try to explain it in a way we can understand, she gets frustrated and says we don't listen and turns back to her desk and refuses to talk to anyone. We are all having a fun time with this for now, but I wonder what is going to happen when it gets old. Is she going to be problem for us? We are all pretty social and like to keep our grad student group full of people we all like so I'm just wondering if you've ever encountered a person like this? I almost wonder if she has some sort of social retardation or something?

20090225063813AARZ5GP	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	OMG! My EF posted a sexy JPG of me online & my wife's BFF saw it! Now she's blackmailing me!?	I had my wife take a sexy pic of me the other night with her digital camera, then, yesterday, I sent it to my Emotional Friend to evaluate. She thought she was doing me a favor to boost my ego and put it on a hot-or-not web site for an hour (I scored a 7.1027, BTW; not bad, considering I'm an older guy), then took it down, and we had a laugh.       My wife doesn't go online, but her BFF does and saw the pic! Not only that, she did a screen print! Now she's trying to blackmail me -- if I don't sleep with her, she will show the screen print to my wife, which not only has the sexy photo but my EF's screen name above it as "submitted by."      The BFF said she will tell my wife that I slept with her even if I don't, so I'm kind of caught in a pickle. The BFF is 5-10 with DDs -- yum, but that's besides the point.      How do I get out of this?

20090203143823AAZWi7c	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How do I ask for something back that my husband loaned out?	My husband loaned out a very expensive set of Christian DVDs to a friend who he is no longer in touch with about a year and a half ago. My family all chipped in a lot of money to purchase the set for him for a gift for him, and I have been on him for over a year to please get them back. He has drug his feet way too long, although I keep asking him to please ask for them back.   I asked him again last night and he didn't call, then today he said he called and got voicemail, but didn't leave a message, and he will call back later.    Is it totally rude and out of line for me to call the guy and ask for them back, then go pick them up?    Quite frankly, I would have done that a long time ago but I didn't want to step on my husbands toes, but now I don't really care.      What's your take? What would you do?
20090202103321AAXfuYl	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Marriage problems with sex..ONLY SERIOUS PEOPLE?	My husband and I have been fighting for a while now and I mean everyday. We have been together 6 years. We are trying to get into counseling. BUT... we got into the biggest fight ever the other day. I asked him why we only have sex once every 6-7 months and he wouldn't tell me. i persisted till he finally told me. He said it was because I was the most boring lay he has ever had. He said he has not been happy for all the 6 years we have been together. I figured since he told the truth I would too. I let him know I have never had an orgasm by him EVER. I never wanted to tell him that before because I didn't want to hurt him. I guess he needed to hurt me? I let him know I became boring in bed when I got frustrated with me not getting off and with us only having sex once every 6-7 months. It only lasts 2 minutes. And as if he didn't hurt me bad enough he went on to tell me that he can name off 3 other women that never complained about him and he said that one is 4 miles away from us and he said that one is my step daughters mom. How sick is this? How can I get over this? I never in my life have compared him to any of my ex's. I would never do that!   What do I do? He told me sorry today after I let him know I could never have sex with him again that I was hurt very deep. All he could say to that is " why are you still here then?" I also reminded him of everything he said to me on Saturday and he says he never said it when he really did! Please only answer if you are serious! I don't need games

20090203145025AAHSOnG	Family & Relationships;Friends	Bully? please help!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!?	Heres what happened today:             Teacher: sarah, the other side of the room needs more people for the game, can you go sit over there?      (i pick up my stuff and walk over)      Phoebe: What do you want?      me: The teacher wanted me to sit here,      (i pick up her bag in the empty seat, but she pulls her hand.)      Phoebe: Dont touch my bag!      me: I was just moving it so i could sit down,       phoebe: Go sit somewhere else!      So i move to the other side of the table,      where the other girl does the exact same thing.      Then, i march over to phobe's side and snach her bag, plop it on the table, and look forward.      Phoebe: i dont want to sit next to that weirdo!      So she moved over to the other side, while my  friends just played along and went on with her plan.      My eyes got wattery, and i dug my nails into my arm, trying to keep them in.      But they could see that i wasnt exacly happy, so they said "Dont get sad gosh...i say everyones weird"      So i get up, slanting and looking down,   one of my friends makes me feel better, say that those girls are mean and not to listen.      so i get back into class after we go to the computer lab, and phoebe and alissa shout out, "HEY SO DO YOU STILL LIKE AUSTIN?" On purpose.      And guess what? he was walking past the room to ask a question to the teacher. I just sat there, wide eyed. Everyone was staring at me, and i put my hand over my face.      "DUde! what was that for? dont you know shes like shy?" someone defened for me.      "Sarah, your a freak"      phobe said. Her friends nodded.      now everyone was wispering, (the teacher had a phone call, and nowon was in the room for another 10 min.)      I stacked my bag to hide my face, and started silent crying.      This girl looked over to see if i was ok, of course i wasnt.      "Wha...did...i do to her?"      She shrugged.      I got up from my seat, whiping my eyes.      "Crybaby."       i heard in the distance.         so basicly, she makes fun of me humiliates me and hates me.      (to tell you the truth, she gets all c's while i get all a's and b's. i just want to scream that at her, but i wont...)

20090203145749AA5UvNJ	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Should I go talk to him?	Me & this guy, we started flirting with each other, but then we slowly backed off and kind of "failed" to get to know each other. Anyway, I've been hearing that since I stopped talking to him he made fun of me and told people that I liked him and how I was stalking him & so people thought that he hated me... So, I deleted him from my facebook friends because it never stopped. When he found out shortly, he texted me and said that he doesn't hate me because if he did he wouldn't care that I deleted him from my facebook friends. I told him to talk to me at school because texting doesn't mean anything. He said that he won't be at school for a whole week so if I want to wait I can wait... So I told him how one of his friends hates me which pulls me away from him (sadly), and i asked him that if he barely knows he why does he care so much? I guess he was sad that I thought he hated me... He didn't reply for about a week, and at school, he looked at me for a good amount of time but today he ignored me...      Should I talk to him or let him talk to me? What do I say? I really do like him and I think he likes me too...
20090203142156AAdMnFy	Family & Relationships;Friends	:( Help me please...Why do my friends leave me out?	At one time or another, I can't think of ONE of my friends who hasen't left me out. Maybe ONE I think, but that's it. Why do they do this? I mean I am pretty quiet sometimes but my friends do know how loud and crazy I am...WHEN THEY TALK TO ME! But it's just not fair. If there is at least three people two of my them talk talk talk and don't even act like I exist (unless they want to copy my homework or something). And even one time my two pretty good friends wouldn't do a project with me and forced me to do it on my own while they do it themselves. How can I get them to stop leaving me out? I mean i have told most of my friends they do it and I hate it but it doesn't seem to effect them so I gave that up. Am I just not an apealing person?

20090203145213AAFfLYQ	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	How can I keep my other girlfriend secret?	For the past 6 months I have been in a stable relationship with someone at my university. The problem is that over New Year I was back at home and met someone else at a club. We kissed at midnight and things just took off from there really. I thought that would be it, and I really regretted it straight away, but I ended up calling her the next morning, and we chatted away and arranged to meet that evening. We have been in a relationship for the past month, and have sex on a regular basis when I'm back at home.      My girlfriend at uni doesn't know anything about this though, but it's at the point where I'm hanging up on her on the phone when the other person calls, and this other girl has added me on Facebook (even though she knows I have a girlfriend).      How can I stop my girlfriend at uni from finding out?
20090225063648AAVfhH0	Family & Relationships;Friends	How to not let people bother you or upset you?	I'm a very sensitive person and for some reason I tend to let people get to me. And it's always women- I'm always in an office situation where I'm half every other woman's age and in the same job role, and I think many women are intimidated by this.       I currently am working a contract position and two of my co-workers are always closing the door and gossiping, and I'm pretty sure it's about me, because when I am around they are whispering. And the one co-worker used to do the same thing with me about the other lady- but I would never really say much. My one co-worker was in the crowd at the today show on saturday and I taped it on my dvr and when I got back on Monday I told her and she yelled at me because I erased it! She said that I hurt her feelings and I was mean for doing that!  I should have recorded it on a DVD for her- EVEN THO i have NO DVD Recorder! It's insane! And my other co-worker is afraid I will take her job so she is always trying to take work from me and is distant. I just hate people treating me unfair and talking about me behind my back. And now the one co-worker asked me to attend a career fair with her tomorrow, because the other lady doesn't want to go. So I'm a backup! And now it's like I have to go, but now I am dreading a whole day with her alone! How can I learn to not let these people affect me? I can't take this sick feeling in the pit of my stomach all the time!       Any useful suggestions?
20090203144433AAhb4VU	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I am so insecure dont know what to do.....?	Hi there guys      Sorry this is gonna be a long one and i will try to make as much sense as possible.      Right to start i am 17 weeks pregnant and my husband is away in Canada with the army for 3 months back on the 31st of March.      When i found out i was pregnant we decided to get married due to security for the baby etc etc, well we had only been married 3 weeks before he went to Canada and prior to that had been together 5 months.      I have never had trust issue's with any of my partners and i have never felt insecure but i cant shake the insecurities off right now, the other day me and my husband were on msn chatting and on web cam to each other, i noticed he went to sit next to some other guy, later to find out that the guy was on webcam to the cleaner on the site (this guys been trying to get laid by her since he went there) out there and watching her have her boobs etc etc out i could see my husband was looking at something every now and then but i didn't take any notice until the next day he had mentioned what this girl was doing i then put 2 and 2 together and asked him outright were you watching that girl flaunt herself? his response was yes! i started to get very upset and said how would he like it if i was watching men do things like that, i got no comment and he started to get really bolshy with me for saying how upset i was about him doing it least of all when he was online talking to me.      The trust was never a 100% as we had been together a short while and trust is something that builds over time, my husband has been pestering me to do sexual things over the cam for him and i told him i don't feel comfortable doing them and he has made me feel utterly guilty about not doing it, i feel awful that i cannot satisfy his needs and am so scared as i am not doing anything that his frustration and the temptations will get too much for him.      I want to trust him a 100% but i just cant everyday im thinking perhaps hes doing the same thing as the other guy on the webcam etc etc, he says that he married me and he is 110% faithful but i feel after him checking out some trashy downgrading lass over the cam has sent my trust tumbling.      I am being treated for prenatal depression at the moment and the one person i could do with no worries about is my biggest.      I am probably overreacting but i just cannot get past the insecurities of him being away from me, i love him dearly and i know he really loves me but i am not sure how strong he actually is. I am so scared that he will do something out there with another women i have never felt like this before and don't know why i am now, i have sent him a email explaining how upset i am (have not had a reply) but i think he will hate me for being truthful with him about what he did and how much it upset me, he did say that the girl was making a fool of herself but he would say that wouldn't he? and he said he only looked coz all the other lads were too but there not married and not got a baby on the way. I don't think he realises how much this has sent my trust downhill and i was building it up.      I don't know where to go from here, i don't want him upset because he knows i cannot trust him 100% but then i cant handle the pressure of this on my shoulders.      Does anyone have any advice. I could do with some kind words i feel so alone without him here and with the insecurities i am a mess.      I hope this makes sense.
20090203144852AAVygcG	Family & Relationships;Friends	What should i do about my friend that has "evolved"?	nope, she's not a pokemon. but you know, she's changed so much. she is now a HORRENDOUSLY materialistic person. all she really ever wants to do is "change her hair and go to the mall". it's so annoying. she is very concerned about her weight too and she's not even fat! she gets mad at me when i say she needs a medium shirt she says "OMG NO I DON'T NEED A MEDIUM I NEED A SMALL". and its like... not even a big deal. she's always talking about "abercrombie, hollister... blah blah". her mother is going through a tough time with her job, and i thought that she actually cared about her mother' problem. she says to me "i feel so bad for my mom, but her hair looks SO GROSS". is that what really matters?   i miss the old her the one that was just chill and didn't care about her hair, clothes, and makeup all the time. how can i tell her that she's done a complete 360. ever since she wanted to be "scene" or whatever. she thinks she's the shiz and she loves the newly found attention by guys she just acts like she doesn't. i know its just a phase, but i wanna tell her how i feel.    how do i go about this? thanks.

20090203143224AAab4x8	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do you find meaning in life?	Right now I'm a 21 year old college student. My major is International Economics/Business, and I'm not really that happy with it. Yeah, I am semi-interested in it, but it's not what I want I want to do with my life. The problem is, I don't really know what I do want to do. I just don't know that I'm not doing what I want to be doing. Honestly, I don't get enjoyment out of many activities. Part of me actually wants to drop out of college, but I only have a year left, so it's not an option. I just don't know what I want to do. I feel that even if I do get a great job...so what? I'm going to be a wage-slave my whole life and then die. We're all going to die, so what's the point. But it's sort of reassuring that we're all going to die, because it leaves us more freedom to do whatever the hell we want.   Another issue is that I've never been in a relationship, which doesn't bother me so much. I also have no desire for sex. So perhaps I'm asexual. I think society puts way too much emphasis on relationships. People think that if they don't have someone they are incomplete or a loser. Why can't people just be happy alone? Why can't people be happy with themselves? I think there's more to life than relationships and love. What's with society's obsession over love. Because when it comes down to it, if you're not happy with yourself, and don't love yourself, you're not gong to be happy in a relationship. Relationships are not a cure to make yourself happy.   Between school and relationships, I'm just at a very confused point in my life. Society's typical path of good career, marriage, white picket fence, kids is not for me..   On top of everything, I have an extremely overbearing mother who won't stop telling me what jobs to apply for and what to do with my lif
20090202103047AA6HwMJ	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Cake situation..what would you do?	I have scheduled 2 appointments for cake tasting. One of the bakers is charging approx. $8 per slice of cake..the other is charging approx. $3 per slice. Should I go ahead and cancel the appointment for the other baker since she is so freaking expensive and schedule a tasting for a baker that is about the same price as the cheaper one. We had budgeted on about $800 for a cake and then we found out what a great deal the cheaper bakery is offering. The cheaper bakery is a well known one, they do tons of cakes in the area and I have heard nice things about them. Do I at least need to give the more expensive one a chance or should I just cancel so i can save some dough?? what would you do?
20090203143647AAFRBUN	Family & Relationships;Family	Situation between the girl I like and her brother. I don't think they like each other.?	There is this girl who I really like who came last summer. Whenever I saw her she wasn't near her brother. I also saw many of her pictures in which she was with her sister, her sister and her brother were together but she wasn't ever with her brother. For some reason I have the feeling that she and her brother hate each other or at least don't like each other. I don't know but I never ever saw them in the same picture or even with each other, except in large family pictures. I also went to an amusement park with her family and my family and the guys were together. When we were together he was cursing a lot and acting very rude but funny towards me and all the guys. I think this is how he acts with his sister, which is why she doesn't to him. My mother also told me that her brother use to act very bad with his sisters, but I see her older sister happy with her brother but not with the other sister who I like. What do you think?

20090203144728AAi9IkD	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Did I really mess up? What does he think of me now?	Ok this may be a little confusing but here goes. I met my friends roomates and one of them is an exchange student. I immediately thought he was hot and vice versa. So we started making out and he wanted to do more, I didnt let him and left. I found out he was a party boy and probably didnt want a relationship, which is what I want. His other roomate told my friend he thought I was hot but he on the other hand is looking for a girlfriend. I talked to him and he was really nice but I am worried that he saw me with the other guy and will not make a move now because he might think badly of me. I go over to their place and try to talk to him and be friends, but I kinda ignore the guy I kissed. So my question is should I try to pursue him? Or would he not want a girlfriend who goes around kissing his roomates? What should I do?
20090202103741AAFBpnU	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Lies or lying by omission.   Is it a deal breaker. ?	My fiance proposed a few months after we were dating.   Things were going great.  He was going to relocate to where I live.  He was looking for work there - but just as he moved in.... The skeletons came out.  He told me he was married 3 times - not once.   He told me he never had a car, he was using his daughter's car - but has since bought one.  Then he made mention of looking towards an electrical union and I said "we talked about this over a month ago?  didn't you look then?"  He said there was no sense of looking until he moved here.  I am heart broken and disappointed.  Sad that he wouldn't be honest with me from the beginning trusting me to make my own judgement. I feel like the prior year has been false.   He kept all of these secrets while he had proposed!!   He said he didn't want me to think he was a loser - and wanted me to get to know him for who he is.   Well, doesn't lying by omission make you a liar????  I am so frustrated and confused.   He helps around the house,  he helps with cleaning etc.  But he doesn't have a job and now I know he lied to me.   Any words of advice or suggestions on how to rebuild trust - if at all possible?          Now he walks around the house acting depressed.  I don't think I should have to lift his spirits.  He lied to me...  Any ideas?
20090203141436AAvLYFd	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	AM I REALLY DOING THE RIGHT THING?	I like this girl in my chem class (she's my chem partner) and shes a year older than me. (15/16, even though i turn 16 next month) Honestly, I find it odd that I like her, since she isn't that kind of girl I thought I would ever date at all (Never had a gf.....I suck at asking girls out even when they give me signs). I have a feeling she likes me back because she tends to glance at me randomly and rubs her foot on my leg under the table occasionly, even sometimes against my crotch, but thats even more rare. Im assumming all the horny guys out there are going "GO FOR IT MAN. WTF YOU WAITING FOR?", but there is a little problem...      She goes to parties sometimes or just out with her friends almost every other weekend and gets drunk and apparently does a few drugs just to get a bit high. (The drug thing is SUPER RARE) but it doesn't help that she doesn't find any of this to be REALLY bad. SHe once said why some high schoolers dont drink. SHe said its part of the high school "experience."      Ugh, im just frustrated. Shes my total opposite,and I dunno why I want her when there is obviously huge red flashing lights telling me its bad and it'll end up screwing up everything.      I dunno. Do your best, opinions is all I want.

20090225063251AA2oCta	Family & Relationships;Friends	Am I insane and obsessed over my crush?	So, yesterday, I got into an argument with a girl through IM asking why I was so obsessed over my crush and his girlfriend. I told her I wasn't, but she kept saying how I was talking **** about her best friend (the girlfriend)  and how I was always writing statuses about them on facebook.       So, she commented my status and was like "I love Greg!" which I don't love him. And then she's like "I'm not the only one who thinks so, everyone does. They're getting tired of you liking him!" Which I don't know why, because it doesn't concern them unless I was ugly or something. Then this other girl, who was all nice to me when she added me and commented my picture saying nice things about me, got in it and said "We all know you're obsessed and that's not healthy. He's not all that anyway, get over him. He has Mia. He's just a boy, there's plenty of more where that came from." Which I was pissed because she acts like my friend when I add her, but all this time thought I was a crazy *****. Then the girlfriend sends me a message apologizing saying she didn't tell her friends to do that and how she was sorry she hurt me and wanted to be my friend at the dance, but didn't know I was there when she suddenly kissed my friend. She then comments the status and tells us to calm down and that this was getting way out of order.       Then my crush, who was suppose to be like my bff tells me "He likes me, but I creep him out." Which is so rude, because if he's suppose to be my friend, then he wouldn't call me a creeper. I don't want to be obsessed because I know it's not healthy and I don't think I am, because they don't even know obsessed. Greg was like, "You follow me wherever I go." and I'm like "I just wanted to talk, but always chicken out when I'm about to. I don't have confidence to talk to people, that's why I always hide."       I don't want him to think I'm crazy and I get really attached easily to my friends, where I would easily seem to be obsessive over them because I can't handle relationships and partnership, because I never had a boyfriend or a real friend.

20090203143617AA9Yzga	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I love him, but I don't want to be used...?	Dated a guy for 2 years, and loved him, but he couldn't commit because of depression/anger/anxiety issues, so we broke up about a month ago.        Truth is, I'm a well-educated, independent young woman.  I don't want to end up with someone that will hurt me - I can be self-sufficient if needed.  He had a drunken one-night stand while we were broken up, and he said it made him realize that I'm all he really wants.        He's been writing love e-mails, and is going to counseling.  He's promised to take better care of me than he did in the past, and thinks he is ready for commitment.  But I'm afraid he is saying what he has to just to get me back, and in the time we've spent apart, I've allowed myself to dream of possibly moving to another state and attending hair school, something I have always wanted to do.      When I told him yesterday that I wanted to move away, he essentially gave up on trying to get back together.  I don't understand - why wouldn't he try to come along, stop me, or make a compromise?  Is he really just interested in me if the circumstances are easy?  He's spent two weeks begging me to forgive him, offering money, jewelry, trips... but one roadblock, and he gives up?      I'm torn between telling him how disappointed I am that he's not even going to try and talk to me about the move, and just never speaking to him again.  I feel pretty rotten and heartbroken right now.

20090202103503AAsO4If	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	He doesn't think getting a divorce is important ?	He left his wife and two kids 19 years ago. She sent him divorce papers in 1994. He put them aside and never following through with it. His ex never remarried and if she did she would have made sure this was done.  They didnt have contact for years and years. He moved on. He gave his new wife the action for divorce papers back in 1994 and they figured it was done. She never met the ex or the kids.  He said he read if he didnt sign the papers it would be in default and final believing it is done. He thought since the ex worked for a lawyer she would finish it.       When him and his new wife married in 1995 it never shown up for the marriage license he was still married. They married in Vegas.   Now years later his ex said it was never done. He tells his 2nd wife he will be honest and not important to him. He is married to her and with the ex it is just a piece of paper.        He speaks to his ex about their kids who are in their 20's here and there just to check up on them.    His ex told the 2nd wife on the phone I want to speak to my husband when she called him just to make trouble. This woman is 56 years old & has nothing else better to do with herself.    My friend and her husband live 5 hours from this ex and been married since 1995. My friend knows what this means and contacted the lawyer for him but he told her he will do it to make her happy.

He loves to have a tall girlfriend (he's a great guy).      How about you? Are you taller than your boyfriend? Do you like it? Does he care?

My ex husband is refusing to take our son for days out unless my son stays at his house but our son (12) does not want too as he does not get on at all with my X's partner.

20090203145104AA2IEO1	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I was cheated on before-paranoid it's going to happen again in my new relationship? How to overcome this fear?	My ex & I had a horrible relationship...he lied & cheated ALL of the time(10 yrs). I couldn't trust him. We broke up 2.5 yrs ago & I've been dating my boyfriend now for 1.5 yrs & I'm trying my hardest to trust him-I have no reason not to. He's older than I (by quite a bit) & has old fashioned values--one thing that I LOVE about him. I think I have the trust issue & would with anyone cuz I was screwed over SO bad by my ex (anything my ex could lie about he did-any female he talked to he cheated on me with). I love my boyfriend & we're having a baby in May & are both excited...he calls at 3a.m. so excited for me to move with him & for baby to come & have little kids around the house again. He's never hurt me. He's never lied to me (that I know of & yes-I've checked his story a few times & he's never lied) He's done nothing to make me think he's cheating on me-his behavior hasn't changed at all... I'm paranoid cuz he hired someone to clean his house 1-2 hours/wk when he's @ work (immediately I think cheating). And the other thing that makes me uneasy is there is a phone number that keeps calling him & it belongs to another woman---I don't know who-and they never talk for long, if he even answers it(maybe 2 times out of 4 or 5 calls). Am I over-reacting cuz of how I was treated in my previous relationship or do you think he could be cheating? I confronted him last night-told him I keep thinking he's cheating-he said I don't have to worry about another woman & he's not hiding anything. And really, it's ALL cuz of the phone number I saw on his phone and the fact that he hired someone to clean his house(he told me she's married-he say's married cuz she's been with the guy for some time-and that he's kinda friends with the guy). He's pretty open, too, which makes me think he'd tell me. Thanks for your help. I'm so worried about this and being pregnant doesn't help!   We also only get to see each other 2 nights a week cuz for now we live 4 hrs apart, so that is hard, too. He is on the road a few days during the week & doesn't want to travel on wknds and doesn't like to talk on phone-so we don't much, so I always get bent out of shape over that, too.

20090225064106AAITAd5	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My hubby has shown no interest in me other than for sex for the past 10 years.?	Now that i'm not interested in showing or having any feelings for him any more, he now loves me and says he regrets every bad thing he's done to me through the years. Is there a point to this or is he pissed off that he's lost his control over me.Yesterday he told me that his first girlfriend wants to contact him by email and they found each other via facebook. I don't know what he expected me to say or do about this info, but i told him i couldn't care less what he did. If they wanted to be together again, there's nothing i can do to stop it because you can't make a person do anything. An hour later he told me that i really hurt him by my reaction.    The thing is he always ignored me through our marriage. He'd go out all night and being the naive idiot that i was at the time, i sat awake alone all those nights worried and crying about my situation and that he couldn't be bothered to at least phone and say where he was. All he's put me through has hardened my heart toward him and i don't think i'm prepared to change as i doubt i'll survive him doing all that to me again. Am i wrong to feel this way, or to have dealt with things the way i have.
20090203142555AASrdwS	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How can I loosen up...?	I have a really hard time talking to strangers. I don't know why but I've had this problem all my life. I don't mean to sound conceited but I am very attractive and am missing out on a lots of gorgeous girls. Whenever they smile or stare at me, I never do anything. I will look back (rarely) or pretend I don't notice (usually). And when they try to initiate a conversation with me I usually respond with one word answers and they probably think that I'm not interested. How can I loosen up. I'm 21 and have only been laid twice, both times because my friend did all the talking and I stood there like a statue. I am not a very interesting person either so I don't have much to talk about if that's an excuse. This is my second semester at the university and I don't have any friends either. But anyway, how can I overcome this problem.
20090203145050AAy7Y0w	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should i do about it?	look i've liked this guy for a really long time (like over a year) but at first when i liked him he was going out with my friend and so i didn't realize this then but i acted like i really really really liked this other guy to try to stop myself from liking the guy and i had myself and everyone else convinced that i did but when we came back from summer vacation and he was in like 3 of my classes and in the same lunch as me and my friend and him had broken up and by then i couldn't pretend any longer so i was still secretly crushing on him for like 2 or 3 months into the school year when i finally admited to my friends that i liked him alot and so then after about a month of subtly flirting with him i finally emailed him and told him that i liked him and asked him if he liked me, not sure if he would answer because he had thought that i was crazy about that other guy and because at lunch the day that i told my friend that i liked him the hour before lunch she asked me "so... you like that curly blond guy right?? and he was like walking by when she asked me so i kind of nervously was like "No" and so it was no shocker when he didn't respond but in one of my emails that i sent him i told him (because he's allways wearing a jacket even in most burning hot classrooms) that he should take off his jacket more and that he has great arms from what i've seen the few times that he has taken it off. and the next day he looked at me then looked at his arms then took off his jacket and looked immediatly at me afterwards but after a few weeks with no response i asked him to meet me in the morning at one of the classrooms so we could talk but i ended Having to work on something for class and couldnt but i emailed him and told him what happened and asked him to meet me the next day and after a while i saw him with 2 fo his friends and one of them called my name but i paniced and went downstairs until class and i appoligized and asked him to meet me two more days after that but he didnt and the last was monday.

I came to him the nicest way possible to try totalk to him about this. He quit his job 3 mos ago and has been out of work since. He is enrolled in school pt but he still needs to work or be in constant search of work because he has a child to support.      I have stuck by him throughout this whole situation even though I know he was very dum to quit during a recession. He says he pur out resumes online but he needs to be more proactive and go search for jobs . When I went to see him yesterday and a few other days, instead of looking for work he is home playing xbox. I'm still hurt because he doesn't see the seriousness of this matter. I thought he was highly ambitious but he is not holding his weight. He think he is too good to take any job during these hard times.      He rents out a room and I have an apartment. I do not support him financially but he needs to get a job for himself and his kid      I buss my butt 6 days a week going to work and school ft and taking care my son (not his) and it id unfair to date someone who thinks the world will fall into his lap.
20090225064104AAorWGC	Family & Relationships;Family	How do you force your spouse to stay away from a family member who is a major problem?	My husband (34) and his older brother (38) have an unusual bond that not even the Mother can explain.  The brother moved to the state where we live about 9 months ago.  I knew that he had previous issues with drugs and other illegal behavior.  He left the state where he lived at the end of his 2nd divorce.  I was promised by my husband and the family that the brother was clean and was moving to our state to 'get away from the bad influences'.        I don't want to go into all the nitty gritty details, but while he lived with us, there was so much physical violence between brothers, so much drinking, and I found drugs, so I was forced to immediatly take our 3 and 5 year old to my Mothers until we could get the fool out of our lives.  It took my husband 2 months to get his brother out and even after kicking him out, my husband insisted on driving him to and from work since his license was suspended and he doesn't have a vehicle.  About three weeks ago, the brother was arrested for possesion and my husband bailed him out.  I found out that my husband has brought our children to the brothers house while I'm at work.      I have talked myself silly to my husband to get him to see that his brother is bad news for our children and for him to be around.  I tried to get a restraining order already, but because there is not threat against me or the kids, there is nothing I can do.        How do you force your spouse into giving up this dangerous relationship?  I'm not one to force things on anyone, but clearly my husbands judgement is foggy and I'm terrified for him and my kids.  He just doesn't think his brother is bad in anyway.  He see's no danger. His step-father is an ex-policeman who has even had conversations with my husband.  My husband just doesn't get it.        At this point, I have told my husband that if I catch wind that the brother is at the house,I'll call the police and say he's trespassing, and while I'm at work, I bring the kids to my Mom's.      How would you get the message through??????

20090225063511AA7ZL1B	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How can I convince him?	My husband wants to buy this boat that costs $11,000.00.  I told him that before he buys a boat, he should think about getting a new car since he's still driving our car from 1997.  He said that his car is fine and that he wants a boat for the weekend.  I reminded him about the thousands of dollars we still owe on our credit cards but he said we are making payments so that is fine.  He plans to charge the boat on a different credit card which I totally oppose to doing so.  I feel that we need to focus on reducing our debt instead of increasing it.  However, he sees things totally different.  Now he is griping about why needs to get my approval?  How can I convince him not to get the boat and be happy with the two jetskis we already own?

20090203142745AADa5mU	Family & Relationships;Family	Some advice for the Ladies?	It is sad, but this applies to you, no matter where you live.      TAKE HEED, THIS IS EXCELLENT ADVICE FOR WOMEN IN PARTICULAR !      Because of recent abductions      in daylight hours, refresh yourself      of these things to do      in an emergency situation...      This is for you,      and for you to share      with your wife,      your children,      everyone you know.      After reading these 9 crucial tips,      forward them to someone you care about.      It never hurts to be careful      in this crazy world we live in.      1.  The elbow is the strongest point      on your body.      If you are close enough to use it, do!      2. Learned this from a tourist guide      in New Orleans      If a robber asks for your wallet and/or purse,      DO NOT HAND IT TO HIM.      Toss it away from you.....      chances are that he is more interested      in your wallet and/or purse than you,      and he will go for the wallet/purse.      RUN LIKE MAD IN THE OTHER DIRECTION!      3. If you are ever thrown into the trunk of a car,      kick out the back tail lights and stick your arm out the hole      and start waving like crazy.      The driver won't see you, but everybody else will.      This has saved lives.         4. Women have a tendency to get into their cars      after shopping, eating, working, etc., and just sit      (doing their checkbook, or making a list, etc.      DON'T DO THIS!)      The predator will be watching you, and this      is the perfect opportunity for him to get in      on the passenger side, put a gun to your head,      and tell you where to go.      AS SOON AS YOU GET INTO YOUR CAR ,      LOCK THE DOORS AND LEAVE.      If someone      is in the car      with a gun      to your head      DO NOT DRIVE OFF,      repeat:      DO NOT DRIVE OFF!      Instead gun the engine      and speed into anything, wrecking the car.      Your Air Bag will save you.      If the person is in the back seat      they will get the worst of it .      As soon as the car crashes      bail out and run.      It is better than having them find your body      in a remote location.         5. A few notes about getting      into your car in a parking lot,      or parking garage:      A.) Be aware:      look around you,      look into your car,      at the passenger side floor ,      and in the back seat      B.) If you are parked next to a big van,      enter your car from the passenger door.      Most serial killers attack their victims      by pulling them into their vans while the women      are attempting to get into their cars.      C.) Look at the car      parked on the driver's side of your vehicle,      and the passenger side.. If a male is sitting alone      in the seat nearest your car, you may want to walk back      into the mall, or work, and get a      guard/policeman to walk you back out.      IT IS ALWAYS BETTER TO BE SAFE THAN SORRY. (And better paranoid than dead.)         6. ALWAYS take the elevator      instead of the stairs.      (Stairwells are horrible places to be alone      and the perfect crime spot.      This is especially true at NIGHT!)         7. If the predator has a gun      and you are not under his control,      ALWAYS RUN!      The predator will only hit you (a running target)      4 in 100 times; And even then,      it most likely WILL NOT be a vital organ.      RUN, Preferably in a zig -zag pattern!         8. As women, we are always trying      to be sympathetic:      STOP      It may get you raped, or killed.      Ted Bundy, the serial killer, was a good-looking,      well educated man, who ALWAYS played      on the sympathies of unsuspecting women.      He walked with a cane, or a limp, and often      asked 'for help' into his vehicle or with his vehicle,      which is when he abducted   his next victim.      9. Another Safety Point:      Someone just told me that her friend heard      a crying baby on her porch the night before last,      and she called the police because it was late      and she thought it was weird. The police told her      'Whatever you do, DO NOT      open the door.'      The lady then said that it sounded like the baby      had crawled near a window, and she was worried      that it would crawl to the street and get run over.      The policeman said, 'We already have a unit on the way,      whatever you do, DO NOT open the door.'      He told her that they think a serial killer      has a baby's cry recorded and uses it to coax      women out of their homes thinking that someone      dropped off a baby He said they have not verified it,      but have had several calls by women saying that      they hear baby's cries outside their doors      when they're home alone at night.      Please pass this on and DO NOT open the door      for a crying baby ----      This e-mail should probably be taken seriously because      the Crying Baby theory was mentioned on      America 's Most Wanted this past Saturday when they profiled      the serial killer in Louisiana         I'd like you to forward this to all the women you know.      It may save a life. A candle is not dimmed by lighting another candle.      I was going to send this to the ladies only,      but guys, if you love your mothers, wives, sisters, daughters, etc.,

I have to do chores everyday after school and my mom and her or making up stupid rules like dusting every other day and ect. Well today, I come home and start doing my chores without question and its always not good enough for Lisa (mom's wife) my mom is at work during this time. she goes ballistic if i miss a couple crumbs while sweeping the floor or if i forget to take out the trash to the curb. Today she was going off because there was still "crud on the microwave and stove"  and she has never said anything about this to me before. even though i do my chores, its just not good enough. on top of that i get good grades, i don't drink or smoke and i'm still a virgin. Anybody else would think that i'm a great kid .. right? why is she going off on me for the dumbest things that don't even matter..and the worst part is that she doesn't have a job and all she does is sit on the couch all day watching tv .. then she aspects me to clean up the house spot less ( i have a job) this is causing a big rift in our relationship and right now i could not say that i like or even love her

20090225063257AAyO9TE	Family & Relationships;Friends	I helped my friend get a job at my office, and now I can't stand him!?	I have a friend that really hated his job. He and I are the kind of friends that go to concerts & movies together and chum around, etc. I helped him get through the door at my office and he got a job on my team, so we directly work together now. I thought this would be great since he and I already had a good relationship, but I was wrong. At the interview process he seemed eager to step up to the role, happy and was rearing to go. But now it seems he is not pulling his weight, and will "one up" everyone the first chance he gets. He puts on a show in front of our boss that makes it look like he's doing what he's supposed to at meetings, but when it comes to helping out the team or learning material quick enough he falls flat on his face. (If you don't learn material quickly enough at our job the responsibility of whatever is going on falls on the person who already knows what they are doing, causing more work for them and not him!) By quickly I mean we are given ample amount of time to learn, and he's been here for months and still can't perform certain functions. It really is putting a damper on our friendship where as we never even speak besides at work now. Problem is, I don't think he knows he's doing this! I'm really bad at confrontation and could never muster up the courage to tell him how I or the rest of the team feel. (They have come to me themselves and commented on what's going on.) I feel like I can't go to my boss about it either since I'm the one that recommended him. What do you suggest?

Today when I turned up to work, my boss asked me where I was yesterday, and I told him the truth, I told that yesterday when I woke up it was 1964, there was no way I could have called in considering the company didn't even exist in1964! I must have gone thru some time of time warp because when I went back to sleep last night, I woke up this morning and it was 2009 again. I dont think he believed me, I tried to explain to him time travel dynamics, but I dont think he was quite convinced, I even brought in a coin I found on the street in 1964 as evidence, but still he didnt believe me, anyway, he didnt fire me, so thats a good thing, maybe he's slightly convinced I am telling the truth. any thoughts?

20090203143828AAD5lfM	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	In DESPERATE need of advice.. I'm going to lose everything.. MENS OPINIONS WANTED TOO!?	I posted this question a few days ago, but I really want more opinions and advice, so I'm posting it again....      Very long story, alot of details will be left out, but please bare with me, and dont judge me. I dont want or need nasty comments or opinions either, thankyou.   Married for three years, despite husbands now "perfect" love and devotion, its still tainted with the past and all his dishonesty and disloyalty until he had this "revelation of love".   We seperated- and he was still very possessive and desperate to get me back.   A great friend and I developed feelings for each other(we're now dating), I told husband I wanted a divorce, so he met with me a week later to discuss it. He drugged me and raped me.. and it wasnt the first time he's done it.. he did it on occassion through our relationship. I went to the doctors to get tested for everything.. and everything came back 100% fine.. so I never brought it up.. mainly fear, and disgust within myself for it happening..   Anyway, I'd been feeling off for the past few months, I and my cardiologist had assumed it was my heart condition, which has gotten worse. My GP ordered some bloods, and the results showed that I'm 4 months pregnant. I didnt know, because I dont regularly get my period, ever, and I havent gained any weight.   Its definatley husbands baby, because the one I'm dating and I havent had sex yet..    I dont know what to do. I know I have to tell my bf.. I just know this is going to be the end of us, despite the fact he knows what husband is like and all of the things he;s done in the past.. he said the only way we'd break up is if I ever cheated on him, and even though we werent together at the time this happened and I have never cheated, it will still be the end. How can I tell him whats happened so he's not going to be as hurt? Or should I just plain break up with him and not say a word about this?    I would do anything to protect and save him from this..    I will NOT be "getting back" with husband.         And if I dont lose my boyfriend over this, I'm still worried about how he's going to feel, and what his friends are going to think.. and moreso how he's going to react. He already understandably hates "husband" for **** he's pulled in the past and things he's done.. I'm worried this will send him over the edge :(

If you cheated on your girlfriend with the girl you have known all your life (had sex) and you say what happened was a mistake, and that you love your girlfriend and want to be with her... then your girlfriend asks you to call the longtime friend in front of her and say that you won't talk to her anymore, would you? You are only given 2 choices: lose your longtime friend you cheated on her with or lose your girlfriend. Explain why you would choose this way.

20090203144830AAISO2T	Family & Relationships;Family	How do I get my dead baby's hospital photos back off the mother in law?	my little boy Jacob died at full term during labour, two weeks later my mother in law ran into me at the photo sho, she said she wanted the photos of Jacob, for some reason I gave her the cdrom photos, I thought she would have a look and then give it back. When she did, she copied the photos and showed lots of people. This women turn my sons death into a circus show, just like the funeral wich was supposed to be small, but she used it has a forum of revenge, by invited over 50 people, who I don't know and didn't have anything to do with my baby before he died. I went onto have another baby 15 months later and well those 50 people who cared so much didn't even congratulate us on the birth; none have even come and seen our child.  I was even abused in a cafe by a friend of these, and when my husband went around to see them about it, they said opps we bumpt into ros and basically believe her story, this women had a go at me in front of my 10 month old baby girl. I am at a point where I can't take much more. My in laws also believe in the power of pray, but it is the creepy type, they don't someone they pray for them to LEAVE, 2 weeks later a man killed himself and they were happy cause they didn't like him as a husband, they told us this over sunday lunch. my huband is scared of them. I am thinking about leaving him.
20090203144845AAtgRJH	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My wife has a new nudist girlfriend and they are always naked together; is she having an affair with her?	My wife of 4 years has recently become friends with a new single girl at work, who just happens to be a nudist. While my wife has always been naked at home by herself or with me, now she thinks it's OK for her girlfriend and her to be naked together all the time - at our house and her girlfriend's apartment, with or without me.      When I come home, very often my wife and her girlfriend are sitting on the couch together, completely naked, while watching TV. At other times they are lying out in the sun together nude in our private backyard. When my wife goes over to her girlfriend's apartment, she tells me they are naked together there too. And of course, she insists they are only friends and there is no lesbian sex going on.      While I don't mind getting to see my wife's girlfriend nude in our house or yard, and even feel that I am lucky to get to do so as she is a beautiful woman with a perfect body, I can't help feeling this is just their way of rewarding me so I will continue to put up with what may be a lesbian relationship. It would be a pretty smart strategy when I think about it, they are putting everything out there right in front of me so if I come home unexpectedly and catch them undressed together it doesn't necessarily mean they were having sex together.      My wife has always been a nudist in our home but it seems strange that she is now suddenly sharing that with another woman. I am not really sure how to react to their shared nudity - if it is innocent or if it is the beginning of another woman stealing my wife away. I do know that is impossible for me to regulate their behavior when I am not there with them and therefore impossible for me to get my wife and her friend to keep their clothes on.      And of course, when I ask my wife if she is in a lesbian relationship she gets really angry with me and says she isn't attracted to women in that way. And as far as I know, my wife has not been bisexual or lesbian in the past. Other than this strange twist that things have taken, my relationship with my wife has never been better.      Do you think my wife is having sex with her girlfriend or am I just being paranoid and there is nothing wrong with them being nudists together? Should I just accept them being nudists together? Should I try to put a stop to this now and and probably get into a huge argument or should I just wait and see what happens?      If there isn't a problem then I don't want to create one with paranoid and unreasonable jealousy. However, if I am risking losing my wife to another woman then I need to know what to do about this. And please, no jokers need to post, this is a serious question.

20090203145333AA9WVZw	Family & Relationships;Family	My girlfriends parents do not think I am good enough for her and I believe they do not want me with her ? ?	What do I do ? Ofcourse I will tell my story so here it is. Me and my ex I think now were together for a little over a year. We have been through alot together especially after a death in her family, I was there for everyone and they loved that I was helping. But before that in the beggining I was doing well they liked me , I seemed like a good kid and they were not sure till I moved in with them do to some family problems I had. I lived with her for a while and I was working going to school and spending time with there daughter someone I love so much. It seemed perfect. And then my family problems came back into the picture not with her family but me and her I couldnt go to school I had no ride I had got laid off and I had no job. I know I have no excuse but do to the economy I was getting screwed and I was fustrated with it. I know I may have took it out on her and them a little bit but nothing serious and the problems me and my ex had were between us and we acted as if we were fighting but sometimes really joking and I dont think they saw that. I moved out because I felt tension and I didnt want to ruin things with her and her family and now I have been out of a job since october and still trying to get my stuff together I am going back to school and I got a car I am not hanging around with the wrong croud ether. Its been a month and me and her are having big problems I feel like this is like Romeo and Juliet type stuff. But I did confront her older brother dad and wrote a letter to her mom to explain myself. I think i'm going somewhere in my life I was going through a hard time and I am picking myself back up for myself and she motivates me I dont want to loose her !      p.s. some of her friends feel the same way too ?

Then the other day the guy blushed after I said something and his best friend told my best friend that there was something going on there. Before winter break we talked a lot and it seemed like maybe there was something there, but the we stopped talking and I got over him. And now, a few weeks after break hes started to try to talk to me again and I realized I like him again. I don't think he likes me because I never think I'm good enough. What do you think?

20090203103534AAcnUC5	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Please, please, please!! some help?	I asked this question yesterday and didn't get any responses.. I'm hoping for at least a couple answers, I'm getting desperate here!   Ok, please don't judge..      I've liked this guy that I know for a long time (almost a year) but we're pretty good friends and we have a lot of mutual best friends. I have no idea if he likes me too, I didn't think he did but recently I've caught him looking at me a lot and he strikes up a lot more one-on-one conversations with me then he used to at parties and such. A couple nights ago was my best friend's 19th birthday party (I'm 18 by the way) and we all stayed the night because it was snowing really badly and the roads were too bad to risk driving home, when we all finally decided to go to bed (at like 6 in the morning :P), he waited for me to lay down then took the spot right next to me, I woke up about an hour later and his hand was on top of mine (some of you are probably thinking "wow, big deal", but it was with him), I couldn't tell if it was just by accident or if he meant to do it.. My friends keep telling me "just suck it up and tell him you like him" and I really want to but the only problem is that we're both really super shy.. my friends also say things like "what do you have to lose" and my answer to that is his friendship, if I say that I like him and he doesn't feel the same then I know it will get really awkward and I don't know if I could risk that..   My question to you is what should I do? When we're having one-on-one conversations I get really flustered sometimes and can't think of a thing to say, what are some things that I would be able to talk about?      What can I do to show him that I like him without actually saying it out loud?      Thank you so much in advance!!

But, when she has a chance, she always has to tell the others anything that is embarrassing about me, since we are spending a lot of time together.
20090203150242AAM7oib	Family & Relationships;Friends	Honest opinions please? Do you think this really close guy friend has feelings for me?	We've been best friends for over a year & we are so close. He wants to come travelling with me when I go and even said he loves coming home to me rather than having a complicated relationship. (He has been alone for a couple of years). The confusing part is that he recently confided in me that he is gay. He said I am his perfect match...he has tried with girls & guys but finds relationships difficult so now he stays alone. Actually he has moved to share a place with me and we do everything together. He is always telling me that all his friends think I am beautiful & think we are a couple. He has just told me a story of a good friend of his who had a platonic friend for a few years & now they've realised they're in love. Friends were over for dinner last night and he said in front of everyone that he needs a teddybear as his bed is too big. He also told them that I'm the best woman in the country (he's foreign). Do you think he has feelings for me?

20090203142355AAOKnUC	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Why am I so afraid of ex-girlfriends?	My husband and I are planning on moving to his home country of Malaysia.  I have this irrational fear about him bumping into his ex-girlfriend and falling for her again (she is a model btw)...     Anyways, all of his exes live in Malaysia, and they are all gorgeous.. I am not gorgeous, I would say I am cute/pretty.       Do looks really matter for men?
20090203150128AA2B5X0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I feel confused...and a little dirty?	So I've been chattin with this guy (via cupid) for the past couple months, and he seems to be the ideal guy.  But last night, we played out a few scenarios that weren't so clean.  He did a few, then coaxed me into telling some.  We didn't get too kinky, but I still feel..idk, dirty?     I mean, I haven't met this guy (though we've brought it up), and here I was typing personal thoughts to him.  If any other guy had been chatting and brought up the subject, I woulda blocked him-but I still can't figure out why I let this guy pass 9or myself fall for that matter...)   Am I over thinking this whole thing, or should I be doing something about it?  All (experienced or clean) advice appreciated.  Thanks!
20090203150727AAYJ62V	Family & Relationships;Family	Does she have a right to be pissed off at me?	my mother is a drug addict, she went through treatment and she is clean and sober now. we recently went down to flordia to visit her for christmas. a few days later she called and said that she wanted to move back to ct (to be closer to her family) and asked if i would find her an apt. I had one all lined up and the day that i was to leave to get her her (future) landlord said that she couldnt move in until she had a job. I called my mother and told her and she still wanted to move up. I told her she could stay with me until she could get the apt. well today i was finding job apps online for her (she asked me to) and then all of a sudden she flipped out on me and said that i should have just left her in flordia she was better off there. she wont talk to me now so Im like wtf?
20090203123102AAGgJ5k	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	DID HE JUST ASK ME OUT?	Ok so there is this kid, lets call him Bob, who I talk to every day in homeroom. (like 30mins long) and he's a bit, scratch that, really weird, and he's like two feet shorter then me, doesn't have many friends, and has strange greasy hair, but hes my friend, and I talk to him every single day. But sometimes during homeroom I go and walk around and talk to other people for like 10-15 minutes and come back and then talk to him. But for the past two days his been following me when I walk around, and walking with me, which I don't really want him to do because he doesn't know any of my other friends, but I never say anything and  just walk with him. But today we were talking about Juno and wether it was funny or not and then he said I should see Taken, and it was out in theaters now. I said I never heard of it and he said it was a good movie and if I wanted to see it him and his friend timmy were going on saturday. then the bell rang and we kind of got separated by the mass of people leaving their homerooms.       my friends say that he acts like he likes me, but I didn't think that he did... really... I definitely DON"T like him like that and wouldn't go out with him, but did he just ask me out??? If so how do I say no without hurting his feelings?
20090203150035AAxhZ5l	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Do you think I'm in real danger?	What's the difference between a harassment order, no contact order, and a restraining order? And at what point is it advisable to get one? I have an ex boyfriend who sends me harassing instant messages  (mostly name calling and saying absurd things to bate me so I'll talk to him) at a rate of approximately 1-5 every month. In fact I barely heard from him the whole month of January, just on the 1st and 2nd then not again until the 30th. He doesn't contact me via telephone or text message anymore (last time was Thanksgiving), and to my knowledge he has never shown up at my work or home. We broke up 4-5 months ago. Initially the harassment was constant but has dwindled down significantly since I have stopped responding all together.  My question is since the contact seems to be slowing down and isn't exactly threatening (although its intimidating and sometimes very creepy) can I assume that it will eventually stop if I keep ignoring him?  Like i said, he hasn't made an actual physical threat against me but he's not exactly mentally stable and did several months ago tell me he was going to beat up my ex husband but did eventually say that he wouldn't.  He hasn't brought it up since which was a little over 2 months ago.  I already have my instant messenger set so that I appear permanently offline to him so that he can't see when I am on, but I don't want to put him on "ignore" because then I feel like I wouldn't really know if I was in danger since I wouldn't be receiving any of his "crazy" messages should he ever make an actual threat.  Plus, I then wouldn't have any hard proof to build a case for an order of protection if I were in harms way.  Right now I save all his instant messages just in case.  As for my phone number it's been 2+ months since the last call so I'm not worried about that right now.  We're both 28 if that matters.  So, do you think I'm in real danger?  Any advice?

20090203145917AAHiA6q	Family & Relationships;Family	Teen seeking parental answers?	my parents often threaten me with severe acts of violence when i do something they don't like. Nothing short of putting my (censored) in a vice and tazering me repeatedly. Even the smallest mistakes like staying up one or two minutes past curfew are treated with a small physical act of dominance. I am not allowed any time off from school, yet they don't care enough to drive me when i miss the bus. I do all my own work short of paying mortgage. I clean their house which i cannot stress is THEIR'S whenever they ask me which results in no favors of any kind, not even a thanks. I don't get anything unless I buy it. Which is normal.I am not allowed any friends at my house which started mysteriously this year... Worst of all... the people whom they associate with seem to encourage this behavior... What should I do?
20090203150154AAV8e2g	Family & Relationships;Family	How much to spend on niece and nephew's bdays?	My husband has a HUGE family. There are about 13 nephews and nieces (that's just the younger ones). My husband is the only one that works at the moment. We are always invited to the nieces'/nephews' bdays, but how much should we spend per child? we don't really have money to be throwing around, but it's nice to give a gift, I just don't want to look cheap. We've been spending about $10 on each kid. It's his nephew's 8th bday coming up. Is 10 reasonable? What can I find for $10 that an 8 year-old boy would like?
20090203150025AAcH2C5	Family & Relationships;Friends	My best friend and I are fighting and and I need an outsider's advice and opinions. ?	Well my bff and I are fighting and usually I am good at handling things like this... but this time I'm not exactly sure on how to handle it and I was hoping to get some honest advice from people who don't know me or her before I contact her again.       Please give me your honest opinions.       I'm going to copy and paste our e-mails back and forth to each other and add in some comments to make it easier for ya'll to understand....      Just to warn you, there is a lot to be read...      Last week I stopped by my bff's house to borrow her van and ended up waking her up. Well I had to return her keys so I ended up waking her up twice and waking up her 6 year old and 1 year old. The next day I got an e-mail an angry e-mail from her and this is how it begins...      ( KATHY is my bff ) - ( BUNNY is me )      KATHY - Ok...wth happened last night?        I have been having major trouble sleeping lately, and I finally was able to go to bed before 5 am last night.       BUNNY - Tabbut was going to give us a couch and he said we had to pick it up last night or he wouldn't have it anymore so that is why we came by to get your van. You looked completely out of it and you didn't offer me to come in so I was worried that maybe you and Mike were fighting so that's why I asked if you were okay, if you even remember that. Well we didn't end up taking the couch because it was ugly haha (( I will admit that I should have apologized for waking her up in the e-mail but just to make myself clear I was going to apologize over the phone that night ))      KATHY - I was freaking tired and pissed. Kinley was in bed, she came running into my room scared to death because someone was beating down the front door, which woke up Addi. Then it happened all over again. I have been running on about 2 hours asleep or less per day for weeks.        BUNNY - Well I'm sorry I couldn't get a hold of you on either of your phones I had no choice but to stop by and I didn't think you were sleeping considering it was 8 at night and I usually talk to you around 8 or 9 and I had knock on your door to return your keys I didn't want to leave them outside or keep them on me incase you needed them in an emergency and I was in midtown or something. Are you seriously mad at me? I won't ever stop by unannounced then if that makes you happy. There has been times were I have only gotten 20 hours of sleep in a whole freakin' WEEK and I never got mad at my friends for waking me up by mistake.      Listen, I realize your exhausted but please don't think I woke you up on purpose. If you need to vent I understand but you caught me by surprise with the angry e-mail.       ----THE NEXT DAY-----      BUNNY - I'm sorry I woke you up the other day, are you all rested now? Are you still mad? Is everything okay with you?      KATHY - It was not just me that you woke up, you woke up both of the girls. If it was just me you were waking, it wouldn't have been such a problem!        And it's not just that, I think I am pissed off over a combination of things.        1) You borrowed my Twilight book and let me loan you my copy of New Moon after you got chocolate all over my Twilight book. You told me you were so hesitant to give it back because you "ruined it and wanted to get me another copy" but you had no problem borrowing more stuff from me without sharing that info with me? I went ahead and took it home the other night.      2) You came over in the middle of the night the other night to borrow boxes. That's right borrow...Borrow means I want them back! I let you borrow like 30 boxes from me and you are too busy to unload them and reuse them so you have to drive all over town borrowing other peoples boxes?       3)  I have dropped everything to help you clean up your place or put together furniture. When have you done the same for me?      I told you a billion times you can borrow my van to move. I only asked that you give me some notice when you finally want to use it, and you have not taken me up on it. You even have a key to the van.        I let tons of things go, and as soon as I tell you how I feel you take it way out of context. It's like I have no right to feel the way I do.        And I would prefer that my boobs were not used as a wallet anymore. It was cute the first time, but now it's just plain weird! (( My fiance and I put money in her cleavage as a joke. ))      BUNNY - It was 8:00 at night Kathy I didn't expect your whole entire family to be asleep, and like I said before I tried to call you but I could not get a hold of you on either phones. And we usually talk around that time on the phone anyway, how was I suppose to know? When I knocked on your door your van and Mike's car were both in the drive way and I heard the tv BLARING so what I am suppose to think? I didn't wake you up on purpose.       I didn't mean to get chocolate on your book, it was a mistake and yes I felt bad and didn't want to tell you because you loved that book. I didn't tell you about when you let me borrow the other one because
