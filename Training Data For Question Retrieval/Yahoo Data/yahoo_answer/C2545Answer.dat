AA11914369	You can put the car in your name, but it will probably complicate your life in that you won't be able to insure it until you are 18, which means you can't drive it.  It would be better to put it in your parents name, and let them insure it with you listed as primary driver.  Insurance is a financial obligation, and being under age, you can't enter a financial obligation.
gdsAhenQaa	I'm not mechanically inclined when it comes to auto repair. Last month I had some problems with my Honda Passport and I wasn't sure how to fix them. I tried to search the web for help, but the procedures were way too difficult for my skills. I ended up going to the dealship for my repairs. The dealership tends to charge more than mom and pop repair shops, but they've seen all sorts of situations ( insurance problems, repair warranty issues, etc) and they seem to always find a way to help me. Maybe you can try calling auto repair shops in New York to see if they can help you. <a href="http://www.autorepairshoplocator.com/New-York-Auto-Repair.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.autorepairshoplocator.com/New...</a>
M79W3Ct9aa	The regular Cherokee is definitely the more reliable of the two and is more fuel efficient with its inline 6.  The Grand Cherokee had that inline 6 in base versions, but good luck finding one since most pack a 4.7, 5.2 or 5.9 V8.<br> <br> My biggest beef with the Grand Cherokee is its been cursed with tranny issues.  Since you're looking for one with relatively low miles that likely means it hasn't been replaced so I wouldn't shop around for the "big brother" Jeep.  If you look at Jeeps, I would look only at the Wrangler cuz its the best vehicle in their lineup and has been for years.<br> <br> If you want to consider other midsize SUVs, i'd look at the Chevy Blazer for domestic and Toyota 4Runner or Nissan Pathfinder/Infiniti QX4 for imports.  Best SUVs in the midsize class IMO.|`|VdJRuTIRaa	The early cherokee or larardo are mainly 6 cylinders and inside they fairly basic without to many options, but a grand cherokee limited have v8 engines and are fully optioned with everything electric in there. Im unsure about the price range where your at but in australia a 2000 model grand cherokee limited will retail 2nd hand for around 9 to 12000 and the larardo are around 7 to 10000. The 4.7 jeep v8 engine does have a sludgeing problem where if its not service VERY regularly they get a carbon build up in the engine and it can block oil gallerys inside which leaves internal moving parts starving for oil and then the end result is a spun bearing or a ceased engine which is very costly. A  hyundai santa fe is basically a cheap and nasty 4wd , yes they are great until the reach around 90000km's or 56000 miles and then they start giving a lot of engine and suspension problems. Out of the 2 car i would defiantly go with a 2000 onwards grand cherokee limited they are the best value for money and they will never give you any problems  if they are well looked after.|`|zCImDEY9aa	90-100k. you should be looking to pay above 7000 dollars. Jeeps are definitely worth the money. You could run it into the ground and it would still go. 4.0 Inline 6 is jeeps most reliable engine. The cherokee is too small top heavy and narrow. This leads to rollover|`|5XYlHv6Paa	You can get a GREAT deal on a jeep now. I got a new one for $15,000 instead of $33,000. Their co. is in trouble now, so they are trying to unload them. Try autotrader.com for your area. <br>  <br>  Jeeps have a 7 year powertrain warranty. They are worth more than hyundais, and more reliable. <br>  <br>  The grand cherokee is the more luxurious model. The cherokee isn't made anymore, and is the real boxy one. Def try autotrader.

x7yKGaEDaa	Anna the 1996 chevy beretta is a good car fun to drive and easy to repair.We sold lots of the Beretta's to all types of drivers at my chevy dealership and the owners really liked there style and ride.The 3.1 liter engine in the beretta made for a better car over the underpowered 2.2 liter engine used.Fueleconomy.gov rates the 1996 beretta with there auto trans and 3.1 liter engine at 18 city and 27 hwy MPG.The 2.2 liter engine used only post 21 city and 29 hwy MPG.Overall the 1996 beretta has a good reputation of being a good car to drive and own.Best of luck.|`|AxpHgbwvaa	Real world gas mileage would be determined by how you drive. As long as you keep the rpms below 3000 during the majority of your daily driving, you'll be getting the best that you can with your newly purchased car. My guess is you'd be getting around 20-25mpg.<br>  <br>  Make sure that your tires are inflated to the correct psi (pounds per square inch), have new spark plugs in your car, get fuel injector cleaner fluid (goes into your gas tank before you fill up-but, people have different opinions on this and i, say, do it!), make sure your O2 (oxygen) sensors are good, check to see that your MAF/AFM (Mass Airflow sensor/Airflow Meter) work properly, and have your ignition timing checked (best if done by a friend who takes payment in beer or food)<br>  <br>  If you had a 87-99 or 99-present Honda/toyota type sedan like the civic, corolla, etc... would be best. A 4-cylinder is always going to burn less gas per mile than a 6-cyl working at the rame rpms...|`|Pur8Ghc8aa	Yikes.  You should have asked that question a few weeks ago.<br>  <br>  You'll probably be better off with the gas mileage in a 4 cylinder.  As for the car, I can't really comment.  It would really depend on how the previous owner took care of it.  My car is a 99 and in GREAT condition (aside from cosmetic stuff).  I still get around 30 mpg on the highway and the engine runs great.|`|d6Y7zg0caa	Buicks run for ever..... but berreta would probly get you by a couple years.... depends on what kind of condition its in.

AA11264416	well even though i don't like body lifts but since you just want the look and not going to really go off road then a body lift would be the cheapest way, it doesn't mess with the steering, suspension, driveshaft(s) or anything like that, only thing i can tink of it messes with is the joint between the steering wheel shaft to the steering box, all it does is left the cab and bed off the frame more, as for the rims and tires, you should just call or go by a tire shop, they should be able to order the rims you want to|`|En51QUfNaa	I would say sell it but someone beat me to it.

YTG3bCeDaa	First ,check for rust.  There has to be at least two small rust spots on the frame of the car for it to be a sound purchase.  Then,check the tire pressure.  Feel each tire with your own hand.  If you can press into it really far, then that means the tires have enough air.  Also when you eventually test drive the car make sure it has no gas in it.  You are only supposed to put gas in the car after the break-in period finishes, which takes usually anywhere from a week to a month. Salesmen often forget this and put gas in their new cars so it's a good idea to ask in advance if the car you are test driving has gas in it.  At the worst, he'll have to suck it out with a tube.

EJLKnPFMaa	Conozco Buenos Aires y conozco el transporte de Ciudad de México a la perfección. El de Buenos Aires requiere inversión, pero no está cerca del colapso. Si hacen inversiones en nuevas líneas de metro y unas cuantas rutas BRT (autobús confinado), algo que el tama?o de la economía de Buenos Aires permite, la libran perfecto. Si vienes a México verás que cuando menos faltan 36 a?os para el colapso en Buenos Aires, los mismos 36 a?os en los que nosotros hemos hecho todo lo que no debíamos hacer en materia de transporte.|`|KzSTT32waa	Yo creo que ya ha colapsado, como bien dices, no hay unidades, las que están se rompen con frecuencia, la gente viaja como ganado,  y  ya no se respetan horarios ni paradas. Subsidios? que es eso? Ah! la plata que debería reparar la situación de los transportes y no aparece por ningún lado por que siempre alguien se queda con el vuelto.|`|139b113e2c8e3752924919dde9827283aa	Para mí, el subsidio debe ser mucho menor a la facturación. En Buenos Aires, el boleto de colectivo cuesta $ 0.80 y el de tren $ 0.50. Esos valores se mantienen desde el a?o 2001 cuando el dólar costaba $ 1. Ahora cuesta $ 3.10 y el costo de operación del servicio se multiplicó por ese valor. El Gobierno, para mantener los boletos a precios de hace 6 a?os, entrega jugosos subsidios sin exigir nada a cambio. Las empresas cobran esos subsidios como ganancias y no invierten absolutamente nada, argumentando que no pueden prestar un servicio digno con los boletos a esos precios. Entonces: las empresas se preocupan más por cobrar los subsidios que por ganar clientes y vender más boletos.<br>  El precio de los boletos tiene que aumentar. Lo ideal sería eliminar los subsidios y liberar las tarifas, pero con esta medida se estaría casi impidiendo a la clase trabajadora más humilde trasladarse a sus puestos de trabajo. Solución: un leve subsidio para lograr una leve rebaja en los precios de los boletos perjudicando menos a la gente. Parecería una medida muy socialista, pero el transporte, así como la alimentación, salud y la educación son elementos vitales básicos para la población.<br>  Pero volvamos a la realidad: el sistema colapsa en horas pico. Pero para solucionar ese problema es necesario mucho más que un subsidio. Hace falta aumentar la velocidad de circulación en todas las vías (ya sea ferrocarril o autopista) para poder agregar más y mejores servicios y así poder aumentar la capacidad productiva (transportar más gente y mejor).|`|27eade8bd01c501f06b62d036d4a3c3faa	El sistema de subsidios ha demostrado ser ineficaz en gran parte porque lso due?os de las empresas de transporte no invierten y se quedan con esos subsidios<br>  Para que no se imposibilite al trabajador acceder a su trabajo en caso de retirarse esos subsidios a las empresas y el consiguiente aumento del boleto, el Gobierno debería poner en cabeza de los empleadores el afrontamiento de los viáticos de sus trabajadores, como es lógico|`|q5sznTVhaa	De seguir a este ritmo.........pronto.<br>  La ciudad crece día a día y las unidades disponibles (ómnibus y trenes) son los mismos.......<br>  Viajar en tren es una odisea, se viaja muy mal, pero la culpa es del estado por no supervisar las empresas privatizadas y hacer cumplir que brinden un buen servicio, de no ser así dar de baja a esa empresa y licitar el servicio.......<br>  Pero por coimas y la corrupción eso no se hace.<br>  Lo mismo pasa a nivel nacional....... desde que se "borro del mapa" al tren, para llenar de colectivos y camiones las rutas, se incrementaron los accidentes, la gente de escasos recursos practicamente no puede acceder a un boleto de colectivo........los due?os de las empresas de transporte compraron los trenes para tirarlos abajo.........Ojala algún gobierno los vuelva a reflotar, todos los grandes países del mundo crecen con el tren.....en Argentina......nada.<br>  Saludos.

k2FNS04Baa	I owned a 94 Nissan Sentra and when I sold it, it had over 230K miles on it.  It's still running because my friend bought it.  Of course I had the timing chain replaced, new crankshaft, new CV joints, new brakes, new water pump replaced before selling. Nissans were built to run and will run for 300K miles.  Heck, Mexico is currently producing 94 body Sentras.<br>  <br>  BUT...<br>  <br>  in my opinion, I think the price is a bit high. But use Kelly Blue Book (www.kbb.com) to compare the value.<br>  <br>  Have you had the car checked by an ASE certified mechanic?  Does the seller have all the maintenance records for the car?  When was the last transmission service performed?  When were the fuel injectors cleaned?  When was the last time the timing belt/chain was replaced?  These are questions you should ask and see proof.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|5xUWxcNUaa	dont go for it. thats alot of miles on a car for that amount of money they want for it. that engine has the possiblity to blow at anytime.|`|GK4awBGRaa	Nissan makes a good engine,my brother has a 86 nissan hardbody truck with that many miles on it.It has 8 spark plugs in the engine with two coils,one coil went bad a year ago and you would never know it runs like a top .I always go by what a great man (my dad )once said "NOTHING IS WORTH ANYMORE THAN SOMEONE "WANTS "TO PAY FOR IT.If you like the car,and it is well taken care of have a mechanic give it a once over.I would rather pay a few bucks for a second opinion than have a 2500.00 car that wont run but has nice interior,and tires.You can sometimes find a 500.00 car that has less miles but may not look as good,inside or out and put the rest into a paint job ,tires,wheels,interior,and may have a better car for less than the 2500.00 one.
4f88ca4d046d3aa968961ba143e460afaa	The differences are as follows:<br>  <br>  -It protects your engine better<br>     -Flows better when you first start your engine<br>     -Works better at high RPM<br>  -It has a higher boiling point and a lower freezing point<br>  -It can go longer without having to be changed (up to a year with mobil 1)<br>  -If you have an old engine that burns oil it may increase the ammount burned.<br>  -It costs more but if you only change it twice a year it justifies it.<br>  <br>  and yes you can recycle it and change back and forth between mineral and synthetic. You can even mix them.|`|77541d09453978c4f7995ce2dfd3e4ccaa	synthetic is more pure and refine and doesnt hurt the inside parts as much as conventional oil|`|5c5fca16d3163886e6fa969f66c9beb5aa	synthetic is man made and allot better way better normal oil is from the ground synthetics last longer and provide better lubrication for the motor you always should go with synthetic like MOBILE ONE is probably the best to go with or ams oil synthetic  will have more performance but the oil doesn't really make much of a differece and you can go back to normal oil there is no reason you can't it will not hurt the motor|`|862b5abf81708bd2fd28142ae25b8c67aa	The differences can be vast and if you want the best protection for your car, bike, etc use synthetic. I won't use anything else in my vehicles. Here are some of the things that make synthetic better: 1) Permit easy starting  2) Lubricate engine parts faster and prevent wear. 3) Reduce friction. 4) Protect against rust and corrosion. 5) Keep engine parts clean. 6) Minimize combustion chamber deposits. 7) Cool engine parts. 8) Aid fuel economy. I could go on but you get the idea, I believe that for the little extra money you get the best possible protection and piece of mind. I highly recommend Amsoil and use it in everything including my snowblower and lawn mower. Hope this helps you!|`|AA11521425	synthetic is used mostly in sporty ltl cars and its good,,,but,,,,after you put it in one time,,it has to go in every time after that or you will destroy your engine,,,you can go get your oil changed for 20 bucks..with old fashion oil that can be recycled compared to syn,,,usually cost around 8 bucks a quart cant be recycled
AA11520025	The great thing about newer amps is that most all of them come with their own built-in x-over. I haven't seen a stand alone x-over in some time.

They may not have it in stock but can probably order it or they can tell you if it is a dealer only item that has to be ordered through Lexus.|`|f2dc7c47627cbc54589cf654e8ba7d03aa	parts like that are dealer items..any old parts store will not have them..go to the dealer and the parts person can look at the tuunk latch an give you the part name and number..you can buy it there.which you should or look to a junkyard..
tiA2ubw0aa	You can buy a car & buy insurance in your name.  Who told you that you had to be 18??  You don't have to be 18 yrs old to do that.  I have written many policies for 16 & 17 yr olds, in SEVERAL states.   I would absolutely NOT put the car in your boyfriend's name, like someone else said, if you broke up, it is his car because it is in his name & he will deny that it is your car & good luck getting it back!|`|f3f0aa51ec7c8c53a8bf7fb9a68dc174aa	If you're going to buy a car then buy it & insure it in your name.  Forget this putting it on someone else's policy.....the policy holder has to have what's called an "insurable interest" in the vehicle...meaning, if they aren't the registered owner or lienholder, they have no insurable interest.|`|01d91f228ac8c804b6701bebab075f50aa	Why dont you think you can secure insurance coverage?  If your of legal driving age and have insurable interest (ownership) of a vehicle, you can purchase insurance.  Because of your age, you can expect to pay a higher premium.<br>  <br>  It's never smart to put any major asset in the name of a person you are not legally married to.|`|Cz0WwXwFaa	Your boyfriend absolutely cannot get car insurance without a driver's license.  Before an agent can issue insurance, they have to run your driving record to evaluate your insurability.<br>  <br>  You probably shouldn't put your car in your boyfriend's name because no matter how much you love him, if you break up, the car is legally his.  It doesn't matter if you have a verbal agreement or not...if he is the registered owner, he is the legal owner.  Since putting his name on the car won't get you insured, you simply should not do it.<br>  <br>  The obvious answer is to put the car in your parent's name, but you haven't mentioned that as an option. Do you have another relative like an aunt or uncle or grandparent willing to put the car in their name?  If so, you can put both of your names on the registration so that you are still a registered owner.|`|eeb9b56dfc133df51ece97ecaefd2bcbaa	You started this question of so level headed, then you got crazy,  No your boyfriend cant but insurance for you as  a matter of fact he cant buy insurance at all without a license.  Just wait until you are legal and of age by the way its illegal to drive without insurance  or a license.in any state don't do it

CqKqPoWOaa	Yaris oke banget kok, saya sendiri pengguna Yaris E manual 2007 yang sehari-hari pake Yaris buat kuliah di UGM.<br>  Saya bukannya promosi Yaris, tapi sebelum beli Yaris saya itu, saya memang sudah survey & testdrive semua mobil sekelas (Yaris, Jazz, Swift, Getz, Aveo -- Livina XR ga dicoba karena dulu blum keluar) dan yang menurut saya paling nyaman dan paling oke secara keseluruhan, termasuk value for money, adalah Yaris E. Mana ada mobil seharga Yaris E dengan tenaga 109dk yang dah pake ABS+EBD+BA sama dual SRS Airbags? Dengan ruang kaki belakang yang paling lega, jok blakang reclining, suspensi pas, paling oke deh.<br>  <br>  Kalo untuk kondisi lalulintas Jogja, Yaris emang cocok banget. Dimensinya kompak, bisa nyempil-nyempil, tapi kalo butuh tenaga buat ke luar kota, mesin 1500cc 1NZ-FE 109dk punya Yaris dah lebih dari cukup. Kalo untuk cewe saya sarankan pake matik aja. Pasti lebih nyaman karena skarang lalulintas Jogja dah mulai padat, apalagi jam brangkat sekolah, jam brangkat kerja, jam pulang kerja, malem minggu, pasti bakal sering antri di lampu merah. Enak pake matik. Ga perlu kuatir pake matik, kalo tiba2 mogok, bener banget, tinggal dipindah ke netral & didorong ke samping. Kalo misal aki tekor, tinggal telpon layanan siaga Nasmoco (dealer Toyota Jogja) buat ngejumper aki, kalo engga, bisa gabung Jogja Yaris Community (JYC) & minta bantuan temen-temen JYC kalo Yarisnya ada trouble. Kebetulan saya wakil ketua JYC, tar kalo keponakan ibu jadi punya Yaris, gabung aja sama JYC, Benefitnya banyak kok.<br>  <br>  Btw, Jogja jarang ada tempat yang banjir, paling kalo ujannya kelewat deres, deket AmPlaz, Jembatan Layang Janti, Pertigaan Babarsari Jl.Solo, depan UNY, rada2 tergenang, tapi surutnya cepet, kalo ga deres banget ga bakal ada genangan. Kondisi jalan oke, malah Yaris saya udah saya pendekin suspensinya & ga gitu nemuin masalah dijalan.|`|QKcFFq8uaa	yaris cocok doank. Pake yang auto donk kan buat cewek. Kalo entar dah beli manual malahan nyesal pula|`|ZqCvRFvraa	Kalau menurut saya sih Jazz aja yang manual jangan matick, karena sudah cukup disana.dan bukandaerah banir.|`|la2tTCxzaa	COCOK aja, tapi gw lebih milih Swift.<br>  <br>  Gw saranin pake yg manual aja bro, di jokao kan ga macet n banyak jalan buat ngtrack, kalo matic tu boros n ga bisa kebut2an. Trus jalanan ga naik turun, jadi ga perlu takut kalo brenti pas tanjakan.<br>  <br>  Body juga simple, enak di cutting sticker model tongrongan jokao.<br>  Masalah jalanan y sama aja seh ma jakarta, tapi user motornya lebih sopan di jokao karna mereka ga tll buru waktu, jadi....sip juga kok Yaris.<br>  <br>  Jokao juga ga banjir bro.|`|nz9P7DuRaa	cocok aja pakai yaris, coba cari yg manual aja. sebab kalau mogok bisa dipinggirkan ke tepi jalan. yg otomatik..kalau mogok ditengah jalan..tetap nungkrong ditengah..tak bisa didorong ke pinggir kecuali dikatrol

9LCwd5ehaa	There is a thing called a mass air flow sensor on the air cleaner. This sensor reads the air flow to the engine. If that is dirty it will read incorrectly thus throwing off the O2s. (Hint O2 sensors don't all go bad at the same time maybe one here, then one there) Remove the air cleaner housing. Look in the tube going to the engine Do you see the sensor in there. claen it with carb cleaner real good. But be carefull its fragil. Clear the codes and test drive it.

8Ttfi7omaa	Although it shouldn't matter what you drive, if you want something to accomplish all those tasks but have some style or "street credit", I would recommend looking into a Chevy Trailblazer SS. It will be the same size as the Liberty, if not bigger, and the SS model will have the 6.0L V8 engine with 390hp. They are available in All Wheel Drive, and the rear seats do fold down if you would like to sleep in it. Plus they look very sharp. Do a google image search of a Trailblazer SS and see if you like it. You can pick one up used, say a 2006 or 2007 model with about 20k miles for approximately $20-25,000|`|U9bQgfY9aa	Who gives a crap about street cred.

1jJPX5Cyaa	Well - in most states - when a policy cancels or lapses, the insurance company reports to the state.  The state then sends a letter, suspends the registration, license, etc.  Also, if they get stopped for a traffic violation or at a checkpoint.  It may take a while, but at one time or another, you will get caught.|`|CSzDV3gEaa	i think they just get by without insurance. they can't tell the police about every single car.|`|AA11914369	Most states now have a data base with information as to insurance, just like they do for registration and driver license.<br>  <br>  If you're stopped for any reason, what do they typically ask for?  "May I see your license, registration, and proof of insurance?"  When they run your license, if your insurance has been canceled for non payment or you don't have it, it will show up.<br>  <br>  That is how you get caught.  It doesn't have to be an accident.  And along with a ticket you stand a very good chance of having your car towed and impounded.<br>  <br>  Insurance companies may not tell the local police what they insure every day, but the information is sent to the state for the data base on a daily basis.  Besides, financial responsibility is required in all states, and insurance is the easiest and safest way to show financial responsibility.|`|AA11980483	Traffic tickets..<br>  Proof of insurance is required for registration and <br>  safety inspection and insurance company notifies<br>  state when your insurance lapses or is cancelled.|`|RVABrMeSaa	Not in NJ; well not if they own a car.

If you owe on a vehicle the lender (bank, car lot, etc) usually requires proof of insurance.

Best to replace both sides, as the other one will soon need replacing if it is the original. A bit more expensive, but less workshop time than having to do the job again

I'm an okay driver though. Since I got my license I got two tickets (one for forgetting to turn on my headlight the first five minute that i drove and the other for a broken headlight that I don't know about). Got three accidents that was 100% other driver fault (hit my parked car, hit my stopped car on a red, and some driver hit me making an illegal right turn).

wpgRMjgraa	Yes...............<br>  <br>  OCTOBER 2008<br>  <br>  Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death among 15- to 20-year olds. <br>  <br>  According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, 3,490 drivers in this age group died in motor vehicle crashes in 2006 and an additional 272,000 were injured. <br>  <br>  Drivers age 15- to 20-years old accounted for 12.9 percent of all the drivers involved in fatal crashes and 16 percent of all the drivers involved in police-reported crashes. <br>  <br>  Twenty-five percent of teen drivers killed were intoxicated. In 2006 (latest data available) crashes involving 15 to 17 year olds cost more than $34 billion nationwide, in medical costs, property damage and other costs, according to an AAA analysis.<br>  <br>  Among licensed drivers, young people between the ages of 15 and 20 have the highest rate of fatal crashes relative to other age groups, including the elderly.<br>  <br>   In fact, the risk of being involved in a fatal crash for teens is three times greater than for drivers age 65 to 69. <br>  <br>  Immaturity and lack of driving experience are the two main factors leading to the high crash rate among teens.|`|447d32e3763216a21069502e28a81b7eaa	I don't think it's a good idea.  If I were going to write a speech about this, I would end up writing something very satirical.<br>  <br>  "If teenagers were no longer able to drive, it would result in more quality time between teenagers and parents, as overworked parents would be forced to drive their teenagers back and forth to the teenager's job, to all school events, to the mall, and anywhere else the teenager is able to go, especially during poor weather."<br>  <br>  I'd keep going with things like that.|`|xPKdf1BBaa	Absolutely not!!  The real problem is that the requirements to get a driver's license are so low.  My driving instructor who has been teaching for over 25 years told me that the DMV in the State of California eliminated the requirement to take a driving test to become an instructor in 2004.<br>  <br>  Now you have instructors that haven't been tested for their knowledge to teach driving are now teaching teenagers how to drive?  That's ridiculous.<br>  <br>  Almost 125 people are killed in a car accident every day....19 of them are teenagers.  That means 106 aren't teenagers so where is the majority of traffic deaths coming from????  Non-Teenagers.<br>  <br>  Increase the training standards for Teenagers and Driving Instructors is the cure.|`|UnOJdXK2aa	Well since we let 18 yrs old vote, the most we can do is raise it to 18. Cause it'll sound silly if they can vote and fight for the country at 18 but not drive. Well, you can't drink in 21. I'm lost. haha. |`|fmQIU0zqaa	Absolutely. These days, teenagers don't know what the hell they're doing on the road, no matter where you live. Definitely man. Probably to 18 or 19 years of age.|`|ZfXGV8rtaa	No, I don't think it should be raised I got my license when i was 16 but driving since 13 and I have not had ONE little accident. I think it goes deeper than the age I think its more so the maturity so i think the parents should make the judgment. Also theres other factors such as how easy it is for teens to get alcohol, drugs, and other harmful things while driving. Also buying kids fast cars can contribute to this. I went from a ford taurus not getting any tickets or having mechanical problems to a Mercedes at 18 and got 7 tickets my first 2 months one being 90 MPH in the 55 im explaining that to say theres other factors that contribute to teen driving deaths then the age of one. |`|yDJEa8C3aa	Even though im only 17 years old and i really want my license <br>  i think the age should be higher and changed.<br>  <br>  Because many teens don't know how to drive nice.<br>  They are terrible drivers.<br>  They get into a lot of accidents.<br>  <br>  I know that there is some kids that are pretty good at driving but, there still is many that arn't really so great at it.<br>  <br>  More teens ie because they aaren'tmature enough to be behind the wheel.<br>  |`|AA11695121	You wouldn't happen to be the one that brought up this discussion point on MotorTrend.com, would you? I personally feel that age has something to do with all accidents, but I think it really boils down to training. Even though it was years ago for me, my driver's ed teacher just breezed through it in a week. Real tongue in check approach. I just feel that training a young person to drive is really the key here. |`|ed7ba7a4f8e4a7436e5a2b1872b89e67aa	No. Sure there are many bad teenage drivers out there (I know several), but there are MANY terrible drivers that are 20+. Every day I get cut off by a mom driving a minivan, an old guy in a Cadillac, or some guy in a tractor/trailer to name a few. Dont punish the good teen drivers by making them wait longer, punish the terrible drivers of all age brackets. |`|TMhjJukNaa	Hell no, it isn't fair to us, and those people who DO get into accidents should be punished for it and not everyone else because it isn't fair.|`|OsBXJ1dLaa	yes definately, then it might prevent innocent teenagers being killed by stupid driving accidents that are easily avoided|`|XLXncQu9aa	Well, I don't think it should be raised, and here is why.  The first reason is because I think that a teen being allowed to get a drivers or learner's permit at 16 gives the child a sense of responsibility.  You see, an issue I have is it doesn't matter whether the age limit is increased.  There are irresponsible drivers at all ages.  You have a lot of responsible young teens who take driving seriously and you have those that don't.  Raising the license limit does not give the teen a sense of responsibility.  Secondly, I think that there are ways to decrease the irresponsibility as it relates to teen drivers.  Intervention can help.  Allowing the teens to attend extra class in addition to driver's ed courses will show them the dangers of making hasty decisions on the road.  Also parent involvement.  By forcing the parents to teach the rules of the road and spending more time with them in the car it makes for more responsible drivers and more mature young adults.  Finally, showing the young drivers the consequences can be a help.  It will show them the reasons why it is important to drive safely.  I say all of this to say that keeping the age the way it is, is good enough for now.  As I said, increasing the driving age will do no good, if you do not properly guide the teens and show them how to drive properly.  Age doesn't matter so much because there are terrible drivers in all age brackets.  Intervention is the best way to keep teen drivers safe.

Now maybe nothing will happen to him but its likely to happen because he won't listen and continues to drive erratically.  Sometimes there is nothing more you can do but step back, pray and let them go on their way.  You can't do anything else but let him find out the hard way.

IUEZzmfyaa	One other suggestion would be that the ends of the bulb, at the base, there are one or two spots of solder, just take the bulb out and clean the ends with a pencil eraser, also do it to the inside of the connector, it should do the trick. If not, the other solutions all apply. Wiring is always suspect, check the ground wire first, then get a circuit tester to see if juice is flowing to the contacts in the receiver. That will give you an indication of weather or not the juice is there at the element.   Check the fuse again and try another one just for the heck of it, if it works and the other fuse isn't blown, try the eraser on the fuse ends. It works well.|`|IdtzdpqGaa	check the connectors where the light assembly connects, my 325e sometimes gets a little corrosion on the contacts, i just clean them and good to go|`|wffHLYieaa	My 1985 318i had wire connection problems.

So, just cross your fingers and go pay for your drivers license and see what DMV does.     Since it really may depend on the person you get and what they know or don't know and it may also depend on what location you go to.      Sometimes what the employees do that nothing to do with the rules or what is on your record.     I think your probly right and I would just go to the DMV and renew your license.   And, make sure you get insurance too.

The gas must enter the bowl through the float valve before it even reaches the jets.|`|5f0ad33d9668eff665c2e087d8f3dc2caa	Is there someone inside stopping it?|`|AKl3Twuuaa	If you go to the chat forum The MILK BARN  you will find  lots of people who will give you advice.

I find them very fiddly.|`|miyAb7cQaa	Take the carb apart and check the floats.

You can scrape the ice without any problems.  Good luck with your ice scraping ordeal.|`|GiOamMFzaa	Hi Ketchup ( sorry, I mean Tomato). Of course you can scrape the ice off, but there are several alternatives i.e.  1) Cover the screen with newspaper at night (I would recommend The Daily Star, it's useless for anything else).  2) Get yourself a centrally heated garage.  3) Move to Florida. (But then again they grow oranges there, not Tomatoes).  4) Come and move in with me.  On a more serious note, most recent heated rear windows have the heating element embedded in the glass of the screen itself, so scraping will do no harm. Earlier versions of HRW had a stick-on type of thing on the interior which you should not scrape.  PS. pick option 4|`|myNHGH28aa	Yea if they are on the inside you can scrape the ice on the outside, and it wont do any damage to them.|`|T3Wvx1cmaa	Defroster grid is on the inside, no prob.|`|yBc0HJifaa	Of course if the window defroster is working properly it should be defrosted by the time you could scrape it.

RWjvcCYoaa	Saturn will be around at least til 2011. And the odds are it will be spun off from GM and become it's own company. Once all the current models are at the end of their "life cycles" (MY 2012), new model Saturns will, in all probability, be cars made by other manufacturers with Saturn engineers adding their signature to them.<br>  <br>  When GM planned Saturn back in 1986, they wanted to create a small car to go after the Japanese brands. It would be made differently, marketed differently and sold differently from all other GM products. They also realized that they had to sell 500,000 cars a year to make the brand profitable. Since going on sale in late 91, they have never reached that goal for any model year. So they have to sell it or discontinue it.<br>  <br>  Saturn will be around for years but they'll no longer make their own cars as of MY 2012. Instead, they'll find models they want to sell made by other manufacturers, including GM. And the dealers will own most of the company.<br>  <br>  The long term is they'll be around for quite a while. So don't worry about the value of your car. The dealers will take over ownership. They'll continue to exist and so will their parts and service departments.|`|328e52056e90a15c3247940d35d04602aa	Too late..... value is already in the dumpster.|`|AA12095978	Saturn isn't going out of business.<br>  GM is considering selling them off so they won't be affiliated with them.<br>  <br>  Saturn originally was its own entity and designed and engineered their vehicles on their own.  GM got involved with them, but left them alone to do things "the Saturn way".<br>  <br>  Saturn simply partnered with GM and shared some technologies and a couple product lines.<br>  <br>  Saturn will be fine without GM.  When GM sales were down many years ago, Saturn was the only subsidiary making money.
og6BDTISaa	go to the police or call 911 this is serious he could be a dangerous stalker!|`|WO68RZdIaa	If you are being followed, by anyone- even a car full of girls & you are certain that you are being followed, call 911 or go to the nearest police station. Don't waste your time trying to get detailed information about their vehicle (unless specifically asked by the 911 operator), do give a good description to the 911 operator as to what you are driving, color of your vehicle & your license plate number. (This is the reason why I stated not to waste your time describing their car, the police will have your vehicle information & know that the car immediately behind you then is most likely the car you are calling 911 to report)<br>  <br>  If you go to a police station, do not get out of your car, honk your horn to get the attention of any officers that may be outside to come over to your car. People have been killed in the parking lot of a police station by exiting their vehicle & trying to go to the police officer. Let the officer come to you. If the person(s) in the car following you plan to harm you, the officer is the one with the gun, so let the officer get between you and the occupant(s) of the other vehicle. <br>  <br>  If there is no one outside or you cannot get an officers attention with your horn, call 911, let the operator know what is going on & where you are & they can radio an officer in station to come outside, or if by chance all of the officers on duty are on patrol, they can dispatch one to intercept you at the station. But usually the person following you will run away once they see you pulling into the police station parking lot. In this case then, try to get a description of the vehicle, registration number, etc  as the driver flees to give to the officer that you speak to if they would for some reason not see the vehicle before it flees.|`|3yvuMkzTaa	Drive to a police station.

bqLvWpcZaa	If the car doesn't recognize the key, try your spare key first.  If that one is not recognized either, you likely have a problem with the EIS ( electronic ignition switch ).  If the spare works, the problem will be the key.  However, the previous post suggested changing the batteries in the key...the batteries have nothing to do with starting the vehicle.  They are only used for the remote locks.  You can start the car even if the batteries inside the remote are dead/missing.|`|KTzBMxSeaa	head for the nearest mercedes dealer.

QcENsfCEaa	Aurora was a nice car did you look at a v-6 or v-8? I would avoid the v-8. The v-6 has had fewer problems.

Seriously, look into Toyotas or Hondas. But if you like the Olds, go for it.|`|RTBvQJHbaa	Ok first some people shouldn't answer questions on hear!  The Aurora is a Very nice car and Has a Cadillac engine in there with a good trans and so on.  They are generally good but keep them up with good oil.  They are not like a Malibu they have a Cadillac engine in them most of the time.  Some things are more expensive to fix on them just from the lack of space under the hood.  For instance the battery isn't under the hood its under the back seat, which would me in the cab.  Most cheap battery's for cars are lead acid which vent toxic gasses from time to time.  Your car would be a "special App" in that case it would be in need of an AGM battery which are very good/great batteries just a good bit of $$.  Rarely do they have major problems if kept up, and not beat on.  They are a very nice car and I would own one if I had some spare time and cash enough to buy one.|`|ksFD7EoSaa	The Oldsmobile that you are talking about is similar to the Chevrolet Malibu.

If the vehicle is insured under your girlfriends name and you only drive it about 12 times a YEAR then yes, it's insured under permissive use. But if you're a frequent driver of the vehicle you need to be listed on the insurance policy. The insurance agency will ask your girlfriend if she's listed all potential drivers, once she signs the application she's committed insurance fraud and the policy can become null and void at anytime! That's illegal in all 50 states. You need to be listed, the insurance company may exclude you and if you cause an accident there is absolutely NO coverage and your girlfriend will be sued.

For the purposes of the insurance company once they find out you are the actual principal operator, and the insurer has many tools at their disposal to find this out, then the policy will not be worth the paper it's written on. They will deny any claim, and then you AND your girlfriend will be responsible for all damages (both to your vehicle and the other party), which means, if there are injuries, you could both be in debt for the rest of your life.

Speed is of the essence. You see them running frequently back and forth to the trucks.    Opening and closing the door every time eats up seconds, and those add up to minutes - something they're trying to avoid.|`|meqrA9ZZaa	Yes, it is dangerous. Obviously an open door is a potential entry point for all sorts of stuff, not least shrapnel created during a collision. What is less obvious to most is that opening a door also severely weakens structural integrity of the car in regard to collisions.    If it's too hot I'd say opening the windows should do the trick. I'm afraid open doors is mostly about speed, they can do the job faster if they don't have to open and close the doors all the time. And they probably don't wear seat belts either, for the very same reason.
d9157449b4296a78a2d93140eae05e2baa	Depends on the type of daytime headlight installation (manufacturer).<br>  <br>  What you might want to do if you just temporarily want to turn off your DRLs (such as if required at some astronomy gatherings or military bases, or for holiday neighborhood lighting displays), is:  turn off your car, apply the parking(emergency) brake at the lightest setting (first click), then turn the car on.  Often having the parking brake set will turn off the DRLs when the car is on, and driving at the lightest setting slowly and for short distances won't cause much/any damage to the brake.<br>  <br>  You may also want to check with some online owner's groups, to see if they've posted the electrical wiring diagrams or if anyone else has posted instructions for installing a temporary DRL disable switch for such occasions.<br>  <br>  Do note that the daytime running lights are considered a safety feature (makes your car more visible to other traffic), so you do not want to completely disable them.  (They are required in some countries (such as Canada), and some insurance companies will give you a discount for having them installed...)

If you are the only one on the application, then all the info has to be about you when it comes to income. You can't add your husbands income unless you add him to the application.    Your credit report will list your monthly obligations and the lenders use that information when figuring debt-to-income ratios. They can approve a loan "Pending income verification", so don't lie about how much you make. Good luck and I hope this helps.|`|76cAAPfBaa	If you keep your expenses separate, then NO, you don't have to put down your rent. Only put down the direct things YOU pay for out of your income.    Consider this however: if your own husband won't co-sign a loan with you, you might get stuck with a used car, super-high interest rate, and have to suffer with that. But, then again, you have to start somewhere!    Also, why do you need a new car? Perhaps there's some sort of county transportation that would be cheaper? Cars require gas, license, insurance, etc. It can get expensive fast! If you MUST get a car, consider a nice USED one around 3 years old. price is much cheaper, and a better buy for the money.

When searching for internet car rental specials, you can also try to check car rental rates using a discount code.  There are hundreds of membership programs and professional associations that offer car rental discount codes to their members.  You can find a list of car rental discount codes for 8 major car rental companies, at http://www.best-car-rental-tips.com/disc...|`|LuqZXXyBaa	Enterprise|`|8eIFHbogaa	try using a coupon code - http://www.rentalcarscode.com/|`|AA10640429	Dollar rental or rent a wreck (they r good cars not wrecked) also check online like travel zoo- travelocity-or just google cheap car rentals.|`|0B0ycKw3aa	http://travel.yahoo.com/cars|`|D6kZzXQeaa	Well it really depends on what city your renting from. You could almost always use a big name company(Budget,Enterprise,Hertz,Alamo, or Avis) Just do your research before booking and try and find the cheapest rate.   Your age also depends since the bigger company's you usually have to be older then 25. (some if your younger charge an underage fee)
bqLvWpcZaa	Only you can answer if it is a good idea or not.  The pro's are:  better looks ( although that is subjective ) and better handling.  The con's are:  decreased tire life, less comfort, and the performance may suffer ( due to the increased rotational mass of larger rims ).  Also, if the roads you drive on are rough or have potholes, etc., you also run a larger chance of damaging your rims because of the smaller sidewalls.  The Benz recommended sizes for 18's are 245/40R18 ( on 8.5x18 rim ) all the way around or if you want to put wider rims on the rear,  265/35R18 ( on 9.0x18 rim while keeping the 245/40 and 8.5 width rim on the front.  The larger rim is too wide for the front ).
kgk3Yz9Naa	clutch in,select a gear then clutch out slow....thats the basics....|`|klOl7Q6Laa	use the toe shifter on the left side. If it has a clutch you need to use that too but release the gas before you shift|`|AA10582974	Search for question - How do I shift a dirt bike?|`|567GxqiGaa	you should have a clutch on the left handside on the bar, then infront of the left foot peg there should be the gear selector, its different to a cars but similar, basically you hold the clutch in, kick the selector down or up (mine has the 1st gear down, then you go up for the next 2 but its just a pit bike).  when you hold the clutch in and select the gear the bike should jerk a bit then you know your in gear, give it some throttle and let the clutch lever out very slowly. to change up then you get enough speed hold the clutch and kick the selector up with your toe (or how ever your gears are configured) and let the clutch out, make sure you let off the throttle while doing this. to find neutral you have to give the selector half a click and you should be able to find a neutral somewhere in there.|`|GWzoQ0iaaa	pull clutch push down to change into a lower gear, to shift up just lift up i dont use the clutch for upshifts doesnt do harm to the bike and as a racer it helps me stay just a little bit faster|`|miyAb7cQaa	Let off gas, pull in clutch, select gear using the peg on the left side, let off the clutch, get back on the gas.|`|LmBZqlEvaa	from standart +2 or +4, make your faster in dirt|`|cFHZKaFAaa	pull the clutch in. and shift with the toe shifter up or down depending on what gear you're in.
40I6HkFRaa	If equipped with a tempature guage and it works cold thru warm then that is not likely your problem.  Most likey the door in the vent system is not working that opens and closes to let the hot air into the cab.  It is either vacume or electrical motor controlled.  Call the dealer parts department and ask for a schematic to be faxed with the vent system parts layout.  This will tell you.|`|gz4ZwomKaa	feel the two hoses going to and from the heater core. if they are both hot and the engine is hot also it is a door that controls the warm and cold air mixture. and i believe it is run by a cable and is under the hood up by the hood hinge on passengers side. if one of your heater core hoses are cool and the engine is hot check to see if you have a valve in one of  your heater core lines try removing it and putting it a piece of straight pipe. if the engine is not running hot it will not give heat no matter  what you do. then you can try a thermostat. in some trucks there are double and tripple core radiators which are real good in the summer but cool to good in the winter.|`|N7LlOAcOaa	my friends Ford truck I think an F350, did this all the time. he just blamed it on the fact that its a ford....|`|0TVenxJyaa	Could be the thermostat, what is the temperature gauge reading?  Seems as though this setup does not use a heater valve, so it could be a blend door issue

6xyeYjkkaa	If it's a tank that was built and certified for the amount of air pressure you're loading it with then it should not be a problem. However if it's just some metal can you rigged I'd be very carful. Shrapnel can be deadly.|`|5FVyVS9vaa	I would put it in the trunk or under the car.|`|a3838c0cd2f7f63124657ac7f4657dfbaa	If it is a proper air tank it will have a pressure relief valve on it. The relief valve will open long before the tank will rupture. That is if the tank is not partially rusted out inside or out.|`|yeu17dNOaa	it should be fine as long as you have something keeping it from rolling around in the back seat. I would also make sure it is not on the seat and on the floor (so i can not roll off the seat).|`|AA12095978	it should be safe.. usually though air tanks are kept in the trunk so they're not in the way.<br>  it won't explode, you have just air in it, right?|`|8DumloZuaa	Hi, if you want to get more information about it, go to <a href="http://car-engine.synthasite.com/?q=vehicle" rel="nofollow">http://car-engine.synthasite.com/?q=vehi...</a>
