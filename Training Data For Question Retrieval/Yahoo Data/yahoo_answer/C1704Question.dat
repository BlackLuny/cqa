She wasn't willing to work with any republicans who wanted to make amendments to the bill. She said we must pass this bill because of the dire economic situation the country is in. Then after the bill was passed and signed she, her staff and 7 democrats from congress took off on a trip to Italy. They flew in a government military jet. Paid for by taxpayers. And I'm sure they will be staying in some pretty nice hotels. Was this really such an important trip? She has been site seeing and going to museums. She did speak with the pope and he told her he didn't like her stance on abortion. I just wonder how much this trip will cost the taxpayers.

He really seems like he realizes he bit a little more off than he can chew with this position. His declaration to the mayors today and his stimulus package tour all seem like acts of someone trying to revert back to the thing they are comfortable with.  The Congress has handed him a bill so far to sign, but he really seems to have trouble with conflict.  The Republicans couldn't even oppose him on the thing and he was still lashing out at them.  Heck, he can't even deal with having members of the media disagree with him.  I can't imagine his reaction if North Korea launches a missle.

20090220144500AACNJjO	News & Events;Other - News & Events	What should I do?? I really need help here!?	okay, i have a question about my school..      Im a senior on the last semester of my high school career, and I have pretty much upheld good grades, and almost a perfect A average.      Well, on Monday I was called up to the office and told that I was suspended out-of-school for ten days, and I would be given a tribunal within those ten days to try and prove my innocence.      Well, there are two rules In the category of the rule book I may have broken. One is "Computer Trespass" and the other is "Computer Misuse" and I was filed under the first one, "Computer Trespass". Computer misuse yields a punishment that is far less severe and does not include expulsion. I strongly believe what I did was Misuse, however I do understand what I did was wrong, and could very well be "Computer Trespass".       I'll explain exactly what I did, and what I used it for. I used the portable version of "Firefox", a free web browser, and went through a proxy into a server to bypass the firewall and get to "Facebook" (Yes, I know that now in retrospect it was remarkably stupid). They called me into the office and had some pictures as evidence of my school account going onto "Facebook.com" and they explained my punishment.       I have two problems with this, one being that I might have been punished for the wrong rule (Thinking maybe i broke misuse as opposed to trespassing), and two being that I received a much harder punishment than others with the same issue.       I will also explain that I hosted the "Firefox" with the proxy already set up on my web server available for anyone to download. Some of the other kids in the school began to catch wind of this, and began downloading the program. I use the program for other things outside of school as well, so I did not notice, and even if I had, what they choose to download is there issue. I am legally allowed to own and run this proxy and host this program, and I have checked with my hoster, as well as Mozilla, the creator of "Firefox". The other students who were caught with the same program were given one day of inn-school suspension and nothing else. I was given a report that stated I distributed the program to other students, which is not true, however even if it were, I cannot be held responsible for what others choose to download onto their school accounts. They found out that I was the owner of the proxy and expelled me when I technically did not commit anything more than the others, seeing as though running a proxy outside of school is 100% legal. So I believe if I am being expelled then that would mean the dozens of other students should be as well.      I have already taken the initiative to e-mail my teachers and ask for work while on suspension and I have also e-mailed my principal hoping he could override the assistant principals decision. My teachers all have e-mailed me back and told me that they would talk to the principal to inform him that I am indeed a good student. My principal has not e-mailed me back yet, and it has been almost a week. I am running out of ideas of what to do. I was thinking of maybe getting my local news involved because my school is a "school of excellence" and any media disturbances would be devastating to their reputation. I am just really upset by this and I am trying to find a way to be allowed back in to finish my senior year. I would even be willing to help them fix holes in their network in exchange, or really anything. I truly am sorry for what I did, all I want is to finish school.      Here is the actual report I got:   "School tech. specialist discovered inappropriate programs in student's folder. It was later determined that student was using program to bypass the school filters and all of the safety protocols. Student also shared the program with other individuals. OSS 10 days pending tribunal Feb. 18-March 3."      Thank you for any help!

Read on, pass it on and pray for our country. USA!!!   Obama Snubs Nation's Heroes, Becomes the First President to Skip Ball Honoring Medal of Honor Recipients in Over 50 Years... Submitted by Julie on January 21, 2009 - 10:13pm.   2008 News Politics U.S. Government U.S. Politics World Politics      Barack Obama may have stumbled over his words briefly during his inauguration, but he made an even bigger blunder later Tuesday evening.  The newly sworn-in President opted not to appear  at what should have been one of the most important Balls on his agenda that evening - "The Salute to Heroes Inaugural Ball." The Salute to Heroes Inaugural Ball was begun in 1953 for President Dwight    Eisenhower's inauguration. The event recognized recipients of the Medal of Honor, the nation's highest military award. There were 48 Medal of Honor    recipients in attendance, who were undoubtedly disappointed by the new   Commander-in-Chief's failure to show. Over the past 56 years and 14    inaugurations, no President has skipped this event - until now.      The Salute to Heroes Inaugural Ball is sponsored by the American Legion, and co-sponsored by 13 other veteran's service organizations, including those such as the Paralyzed Veterans of America and the Military Order of the Purple Heart.      Instead of attending this ball honoring our nation's heroes, Obama was busy    making stops at 10 other official balls.  Obama and his wife's first stop was at    the Neighborhood Ball. From there they went to the Home State Ball for Illinois    and Hawaii, the Commander-in-Chief Ball, the Youth Inaugural Ball, and the    Home State Ball for Delaware and Pennsylvania. They finished off the night    with brief appearances at the Mid-Atlantic, Western, Midwest, Eastern, and    Southern regional Balls.      Celebrities were a plenty at the balls, with Stevie Wonder, Shakira, Mary. J. Blige,    Faith Hill, Jay-Z, Alicia Keys, Adam Levine, will.i.am, Sting, Mariah Carey, and    Leonardo DiCaprio in attendance at the Neighborhood Ball. In addition, the other    nine balls also featured a star-studded lineup including Kanye West and Kid Rock    at the Youth Ball, Marc Anthony at the Western Ball, and Cheryl Crow at the Western Ball.      It was the party without all of the celebrities that Obama skipped. The very people who he sought to have support him during his candidacy and campaign, who have fought to protect this country, were snubbed in favor of publicity and the opportunity to rub shoulders - yet again - with the out-of-touch Hollywood elite! ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~...      SHAME ON YOU PRESIDENT OBAMA!  THESE BRAVE MEN CAME TO RESPECT YOU, YET YOUR BLATANT FAILURE TO RECOGNIZE THEM SENDS THEM AND ALL WHO HAVE FOUGHT TO DEFEND THIS NATION, THE WRONG MESSAG E.  MAKE NO EXCUSES MR. PRESIDENT - WE NOW KNOW WHERE VETERANS STAND UNDER YOUR WATCH! This message needs to be sent around the world 100 times and personally to President Obama on a regular basis.  Will you assist in getting that done?  Don't add or detract anything to or from this, and also be RESPECTFUL, no matter how you feel about it!
