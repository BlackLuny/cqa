20090202230120AAHU7ok	Food & Drink;Cooking & Recipes	Do you often leave eggs out of your recipes?	So i live alone but i like baking and cooking a lot.. except that i`m usually just cooking for myself. So i have to make smaller portions of everything... like for example if i`m following a recipe that makes 14 servings, i`ll adjust it to make like only 2 servings. And often when a recipe calls for eggs, i`ll skip the eggs entirely mainly bc it is hard to divide an egg up to make only 2 servings. The thing is that my food always turns out great anyways! I`m always expecting it to not be as good because i`ve left out the egg, but that never really happens. So it makes me wonder why the egg is even included in these recipes in the first place?? I find that very few recipes actually NEED the egg. And some actually taste better without it. For example, making hamburgers from scratch would definitely need an egg to hold the ground beef together. But pancakes, cookies, cakes don`t really need the egg(s) at all. I think it`s a great way to cut back on calories and cholesterol and to save your eggs too! I mean why use them up when you don`t even really need to? I have heard of some ppl just using only the egg whites. So what do you do? Do you only use the egg whites, do you use the whole egg, or do you often leave the eggs out altogether?

I cook rice in the microwave because:   - cooking on the stove takes too long and I can't control it while I'm taking a shower.   - cooking it with the rice cooker takes forever and I need to get rice ready in 20 minutes.      The microwave works great. However, when I cook it, I put the rice and the water in a plastic container and seal it with its cover. However, no matter what I do, the cover punctually pops up every time and the dirty hot water gets out of the container making the whole inside of the microwave dirty and nasty.      Do you know a trick that would save me from cleaning the microwave everyday?

I know people say natural is ofcourse the best but when I was shopping the other day I saw that the salted/roasted cashews were 51 g fat and the natural had 50g of fat and the carbs/proteins were the same on the two.      Why should I buy natural when there's only 1 g difference.      Salted and roasted are 100 times better tasting.

20090202195306AAha5yg	Food & Drink;Cooking & Recipes	Do you know the recipe for this?	I don't exactly know how to explain it, but I had this once when I was at a local restaurant (O'reilly's I think?). I would call them something like "mac and cheese nuggets." They look like Chick Nuggets on the outside, but instead of chicken, there's mac and cheese. Could you find the recipe for essentially the same thing, but with corn instead? They are so good. I want to make them. I guess they look something like this:    http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/cnSq9jF...    but less gross looking (store bought = yuck.) and more fresh.      Don't just say "I don't know" or some crap, because this is Yahoo ANSWERS, not Yahoo-I-don't-know. Got it?

What is it supposed to do exactly, does adding anything to it make it taste any better? I drank a shot of it and all it did was taste terrible and burn my throat? and exactly how expensive is it? I don't want to drink it all at once if it's hard to come by since im only 14 i'd imagine it would be hard to get either way...

20090202211836AAN0S8o	Food & Drink;Cooking & Recipes	Short Ribs and Noodles in a Pressure Cooker?	When I was a little girl, my mom used to make boneless shortribs and egg noodles in a pressure cooker that was out of this world.  She didn't cook with a lot of spices, but I remember this dish as being tender, flavorful, having wonderful gravey/broth and wide egg noodles.  I don't have a pressure cooker (her's has been long gone!) but I miss this dish.  Anyone have ideas how to make this?

20090202213424AAP4njQ	Food & Drink;Vegetarian & Vegan	Vegan for a week- Constipation! (ugh)?	So I made the one week mark, things are going great!  I've never felt more energetic or such a sense of well-being.  However, It's become extremely difficult for me to "go!"   I was vegetarian for about 2 years and just made the switch.  I think that the huge variety of foods I'm eating now should technically REMEDY the problem- it's not!   I'm used to going, well, 2 or 3 times a day.  Now nothing! Or...almost nothing!   My new diet consists mostly of a LOT of fruit and veggies, brown rice here and there, soy milk, a couple of nuts, and vast amounts of green tea and water.      Is my body just adjusting or am I doing something wrong?   Fun topic, right?
