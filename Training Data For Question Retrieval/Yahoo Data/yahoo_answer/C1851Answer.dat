ApqQj4H1aa	go to settings, notifications, scroll down to other applications, and click the bubble that says off for compare people. scroll further down and click save changes.|`|2LbTrlQnaa	Seems like you should delete your Facebook and start a MySpace.  MySpace rocks!  (Did a 53 year old really say that?  Damn right!).<br>  It's only teens who misuse MySpace for harassing, insulting, threatening each other - thereby getting MySpace a bad press which in turn causes parents to stop their kids having one.  Most adults use MySpace as the genuine networking tool it was intended to be.|`|43yT9vnEaa	Delete the application.

eTLG23N4aa	I would remove all Peripherals before the restore and when your done then reconnect them one at a time so nothing will conflict with the other.|`|9Y20HrKlaa	it could mess those things up i don't know how but it would. And you will lose all of your drives and such some what is the bi deal with removing them. Just have the house keyboard, power and screens plugged in.|`|im6Gyuijaa	You shouldn't have to remove anything, it may even be better to leave them in, depending on how the restore factory setting works. It wouldn't do any damage to the things attached and it might keep the drivers and other required things to run them. Your choice, though.

That was my biggets mistake.|`|UV8bN0Giaa	You can't go wrong and I personally recommend Dell! There are hidden long-run costs that one does not initially see when you purchase a Notebook PC other than Dell, HP or IBM and later encounter difficulties or attempt buying replacement parts like a battery, or say a keyboard etc.<br>  <br>  Also if you're buying for college then I do NOT recommend a Notebook PC bigger than 15.4" bec we have 3 DELLs incl a larger 17" Notebook PC and the larger ones are nice but much too heavy to lug around campus as well as too big for lecture hall desks in college... <br>  <br>  I mentioned we own 3 Dell Notebook PCs and why I recommend DELL, HP or IBM for those living in the United States is that those 3 particular PC Notebook manufacturers literally supply all the business Notebook PCs to the major corporations and Government so replacement parts are readily available esp on EBAY at even a more reasonable price than the manufacturer website. Thus in the long run, being able to get the exact replacement part extends the life on your investment.<br>  <br>  FYI my 1st Notebook PC was Gateway bec I couldn't afford Dell at the time and what a mistake is was when I needed to purchase a new Notebook battery <= costly bec not readily available like Dells... and FYI I also ran into a similar problem when attempting to upgrade the memory.<br>  <br>  Note if you are looking for DELL bargains, then visit their DELL OUTLET site...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dell.com/outlet" rel="nofollow">http://www.dell.com/outlet</a><br>  <br>  Hope Above Info Helps!|`|ApqQj4H1aa	Voodoo Pc makes great computers<br>  <br>  Check out this laptop<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.voodoopc.com/#/productsenvy" rel="nofollow">http://www.voodoopc.com/#/productsenvy</a><br>  <br>  AlienWare make good computers too<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.alienware.com/products/notebook-computers.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.alienware.com/products/notebo...</a><br>  <br>  Don't get a dell though.

HBAMQJPLaa	The restore partition (D:) will still be there but it is now useless as it will revert to VISTA basic if you ever activate it.<br>  <br>  I deleted my restore the day I got my desktop 2 years ago and reclaimed the 10 gb disk space.  Kept it on my laptop to play with.
2iLLZBjyaa	Let's assume I have a script that connects to a database.  It needs to have the credentials for the database in the script and it needs to do a bunch of stuff.<br>  <br>  1.  Everyone on my system should be able to run the script, but I don't want everyone to be able to see the password or what the script does.  Everyone has "execute" permission, but not read and certainly not write.<br>  2.  Members of a certain group of support personnel need to be able to debug my script and tell me what's wrong with it.  I don't want them changing it though because my group "owns" it (or I'm a control freak).  They get "read" access.<br>  3.  I get to do everything with my script. That's read/write.<br>  <br>  In UNIX, that permission score would be 751.
SNZ88BfKaa	Your background image has a fixed height, and at the bottom the bar appears. Adding those images has made the page too long, so the bar at the bottom of the background image shows up when it didn't used to.<br>  <br>  Edit: Just kidding. Your images are inside a <p> tag, which is adding padding to the top and bottom. If you remove the <p> tag, I believe your problem will go away.<br>  <br>  Edit2: You could also move the bar image outside of the <p> tag, which would also solve the problem.|`|SZ2uy4q0aa	Hi, I'm not sure I totally understand your question since the page looks fine in IE7 on WinXP. But if you want to control the amount of space after your images, just change this code for your page:<br>  <br>  <img src="contactpage1.png"><br>  <img src="contactpage2.png"><br>   <br><br><img src="line.png"></td><br>  <br>  If you remove one of the <br> tags, the line will move up.|`|OAp3pS90aa	OH, now i see what she means, in firefox it is different.

AA11703028	hi mate<br>                 this is a popular method of utelising the physx feature built into all nvidia 8,9 and gtx series cards however i personally dont see why you need to set aside one card for physx and the other for display<br>                 what would happen when you only have the gtx285,simple,it would run the way these cards were designed to,they would run together in unison and as long as you have the latest drivers i cant see any problems<br>                  then theres the issue of sli complatibility,you can only run 2 cards in sli/crossfire that are the same version/model so a gtx285 and 9600gt would be incompatible <br>                personally with the performance of the gtx285 i can forsee no performance problems and even with the well documented frame rate issues when physx is enabled with the raw power behind the gtx285 this should not be a problem<br>              in regards to the 9600gt i suppose you could sell it however you may only be looking at around ￡40 second hand value and in my experience its allways a good idea to have a spare power graphics card just incase something goes wrong with your new one(and it happens,trust me)<br>             any problems let me know<br>                      good luck mate !|`|OVo7j3LKaa	not really...<br>  <br>    Using the 9600 for physics will take a small load off the 285, but seeing as barely any games even use PhysX, I doubt there will be a huge difference. <br>  <br>     If you are switching from using a 9600 primarily to using a 285 primarily, you are definitely going to see a big performance difference. <br>  <br>     @Alexander, stop being a points whore.

taOOSSP0aa	I'll tell you how to eliminate any program.<br>  1.First place to look at is Start/Settings/Control Panel/Add Or Remove Programs<br>  Find your program, click it and click Remove button<br>  2.Sometimes the program is not on the list, or remove button does not work, like in your case.<br>    You can go to <br>    C:\Program Files\NexxusRadio (the exact name can be slightly different)<br>   Hunt for something called Uninstall.exe or similar and run it<br>  3.Your first goal is to free up your hard drive memory.<br>    When a program gets installed on your PC the installation program <br>  copies files to several locations:<br>       3.1. C:\Program Files\NexxusRadio (or similar)<br>       3.2.C:\Windows<br>       3.3. C:\Windows\System32<br>   Some information gets written to a so called Registry.<br>  <br>  If 1. and 2. do not work then you can go to <br>     C:\Program Files\NexxusRadio and delete the entire folder.<br>  Or you can delete 1 file at a time.<br>  Sometimes the program can tell you that you can't delete some file. Then go to Task manager (Ctrl+Alt+Del) and delete the running program from there. After that you should be able to delete a file.<br>  It will free up some memory on a hard drive, but some files (so called dlls) are left behind. Some info in the Registry is also left behind. It means that it's not a clean uninstall, it's kinda brutal force approach, but it works. When you lost a key, a sledgehammer will do the trick.<br>  Later if you still want to clean up the leftovers, there are some other programs that can help.<br>  <br>  Sometimes companies do not provide uninstall program on purpose.<br>  They don't want you to uninstall their program. When you uninstall their program you are not a customer any longer, and that's important for them.

If you want to put together a brand new computer for under $200, here are the parts I'd buy:<br>  <br>  Case/Mobo/PSU: <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16856167036" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...</a><br>  Processor: <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819103189" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...</a><br>  RAM: <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820148203" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...</a><br>  Hard Drive: <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822136195" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...</a><br>  DVD Drive: <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16827118022" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...</a><br>  <br>  Those are pretty cheap parts, but the base total is under $200 (but you'll go over that when you add in shipping costs). This also doesn't include a monitor, but you could find a cheap monitor on craigslist if necessary, and you could probably find a keyboard, mouse, and speakers from somewhere.|`|ZdZlNAa2aa	ebuyer.com is great for buying computer components if you want to build.

(MB, RAM, CPU, Video and/or Sound cards, case, etc.)<br>  <br>  At least THIS gives you the choice of WHAT goes into the system.<br>  <br>  Cost depends on WHAT you want to include, but will NEVER be under $200 total.

Apple's low end lacks expandability but it makes the Mac "look different", if Mac had a tower for low-end, more people would realize the similarities between the two.<br>  <br>  Dell: (At The Moment) Specs Below costs $809<br>  CPU: 2.4 GHZ Dell Inspiron QUAD (4 Processor) CORE<br>  SCREEN: 20inch Screen<br>  MEMORY: 3GB Ram<br>  HARD DRIVE: 500 GB hard Drive<br>  OPTICAL DRIVE: 16x DVD/CD Read/Writer<br>  GRAPHICS: (upgrade to ) ATI Radeon HD 2400 PRO 128MB<br>  <br>  The Mac Mini since it has no monitor, keyboard, mouse, very skimpy on options and setup and is not the best deal...

I like my mac and never had any problems, besides getting familiar with the differences after changing from my former pc that was infected with a virus.

eoE4gDpSaa	If you haven't done so, try to unplug the power cable (thick black or white cable in one of the corners) from the back of the computer and leave it out for a few minutes. Try to plug it back in and see if it turns back on. If it still will not turn on you will have to take it to someone to have it looked at. Hoipefully it is just your Power Supply that it bad (small box) instead of your motherboard/system board. The motherboard is more expensive|`|AA10948208	Unplug the power cord from the wall and wait ten minutes and plug it back in.Turn it on.|`|AA11811364	Identify the power supply unit from outside the case.  It's usually at the top of the rear of the case and you'll know it's a PSU because you can see the fan.<br>  <br>  Turn on the computer and if that fan's not working then it's probably a burnt psu.  Electronics stores like Altex here in San Antonio carry power supply testers that you can buy and hook up to the PSU and it tells you whether the PSU is good or not.  But that requires that you know and understand about power and safety while inside a case.<br>  <br>  If you ain't savvy, then take it to a specialist.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|771e81578218a4cec541b97c8aa8d653aa	It sounds like you fried your Power Supply Unit (PSU) When the power restores after a power outage, there is a series of surges before the power stabilizes again. I would open up the case and check the PSU. If you are unfamiliar with computer hardware then I would recommend taking it in to an expert to get it fixed. Whenever you have a power outage make sure you unplug all of your electronic devices to avoid this happening again.|`|t6K9WWCJaa	Could be that you need a new power supply. It could also be the video card. It will certainly cost you a few bucks to get fixed. If I had to guess, I'd say power supply. Find someone reasonable to take it too and get it fixed.|`|VzuPblNHaa	To me it sounds like something is totally fried. Though I'm no specialist when it comes to voltages, etc.

Just make sure you put security on your wireless and an administrator password on your router|`|38c5fd804c63fc6903086ee0de7f76ffaa	Version of windows won't effect router compatibility. Try a different port on the router or a different cord. Try restarting the router.|`|Bdf3EUzaaa	I can't say for sure because you didn't provide the model number of the router.  Most likely you shouldn't have a problem at all, as long as your new computer has a wireless adapter installed.  <br>  <br>  Your operating system won't play much of a role in whether or not you can connect to a certain brand of wireless router.  You could most likely connect to that router using Vista, XP, OSX, Linux, or any modern operating system.  The wireless 802.11 technology is an ISO standard, meaning that companies "have to" follow certain standards and rules when creating the hardware products

XrGFZ2LJaa	Hi.<br>  <br>  1. 512 MB of physical memory (RAM) is unacceptable for gaming, and it won't be able to support many titles at all - including Medieval II: Total War. You should look for 2 GB or more.<br>  <br>  2. Your graphics card is very poor. The NVIDIA GEFORCE 6150 LE is an ancient and obsolete model. It may have the power to play Medieval II: Total War, but certainly not to full capacity. Expect the lowest settings and nothing higher.<br>  <br>  3. A 120 Gig hard drive is fine, but usually it's a very unimportant component for gamers. The AMD CPU Chip calculates faster than Intel, however a 3400+ is not very good at all. You also never defined what type of processor you have.<br>  ______________________________________...<br>  <br>  Overall, I'd say you could run Medieval II: Total War, but there would be considerable lag, crashes to the desktop, software conflictions and perhaps reboots. That's what happens when your PC is not properly equipped for the task.|`|Lk7TpfMKaa	Getting rid of your games won't make a difference unless you have them both open at once. Storing games on your hard drive doesn't affect CPU performance.

1a42bf28fe11e609b0c68795bce43d6baa	You have to change the setting Under "profiles" in the control panel, called User Access Control. It has to be un-checked, and the computer restarted, for you to have complete Admin control.<br>  Of course this is for Vista, if it's another system, right-click on the program, and run as admin.<br>  <br>  Hmm, I don't even see Vista as an OS that it works with, so if you have an older version, you will have to run it as admin, like I said before.

Yp0xQukpaa	An ATA-7 type hard drive is the first generation technology of SATA (SATA 1.0), only capable of transferring data at 1.5Gbit/s meanwhile a PATA hard drive uses a ribbon cable to transfer data.  In the end a SATA is capable of being faster, but it really depends on the RPM of the HDD and the cache.  Yes, you can use them interchangeably as long as your motherboard supports both types of hard drives; they will appear as two different drives on your computer.
AA10900831	In most case, it is due new email account's provider is different from the ISP, the ISP normally would give you an email account too, but they won't let their subscriber use other SMTP server for sending email out, and it is blocked.<br>  <br>  The reason mainly is your ISP try to avoid possible spamming activities, any suspicious email can be traced back to the sender easily without the complication of differences among ISP and email providers.<br>  <br>  To get around, on new email account setup, you have to put your ISP's SMTP server address to the outgoing server box, and change the reply email address as your new email account email address.<br>  <br>  To be sure you need to contact you ISP about the issue.<br>  Hope this helps.

AA10900831	The operation required is to translate long string of equation(thing right of "=") to an excel formula so that the cell return value (F in the 1st equation, r in the 2nd) <br>  <br>  1st equation:<br>  A1 put F, A2 put r, A3 put M, A4 put a, A5 put q<br>  On the right side we have variables r M a q and we substitute cell addresses B2, B3, B4 and B5 for those variables<br>  Then we can come up with an excel formula that return value F like this<br>  = B2*B3-B4/B2-B5<br>  and we put the above formula in B1, put the values you got, B2 put 30, B3 put 10, B4 put 7 and B5 put 6, then B1 should return which is the value of F, <br>  after the above we know if r=30 (cell A2), M=10 (cell A3), a=7 (cell A4), q=6 (cell A5), A1 (which is F) will be 293.7667 <br>  <br>  2nd equation:<br>  We need to translate the left side of equation to excel formula and put it in C2, this time we don't use value in B2, cause that what we gonna find out, and the formula should like<br>  = (B1*B5-B4)/B1-B3<br>  from the formula, the got -4.02383 in C2 which is different from the amount in B2<br>  <br>  Conclusion:<br>  If the 2nd equation is the result of switching variables around off the 1st one, C2 should equals B2, because both sides of the equation must be equal. <br>  Since C2 is Different from B2, 2nd equation is not transformed from the 1st one.

DGdyHCOQaa	Well it depends what you are doing with the hard drive. If the hardrive is spinning and you pull out the plug while it is trying to write/edit a file that file be corrupt and the hardrive may damage files around it. The physical form and use of the hardrive will still be the same but if you try to open the file you corrupted it will not open. The worse thing that can probably happen is your whole disk being corrupted and you having to reformat it.<br>  If you are planning to hot swap (switch hardrives while the computer is on) then make sure there are no programs running on the specific hardd drive you are swapping. <br>  Also you should never attempt to pull out the power anyway. May I ask what you are doing that requires pulling out the power source?|`|JFOj2Gf2aa	You may not only damage your harddisk but also your motherboard too , remember computers are sensitive electrical devices so always switch off at mains before opening up never mind pulling out cables internally whilst there is still electrical current running through it.|`|vo42ZRPdaa	YES and if you are really lucky you will get a shock or short out your pc|`|NZxvybYUaa	Possibly. If the disk was in the middle of a read or write, you could corrupt the data and the FAT. If it was idle, there's probably not much chance of damage. It's a very bad idea to plug in or unplug an electronic device while there's power applied.|`|tfuPCVzOaa	Re-connect it and try powering up the system. You may be lucky!<br>  <br>  That's why computers have a solid case around them so people can't mess around with them while they are running.
sv64Uy3Saa	Virtual memory is very SLOW that is why it is not used for sharing with graphics card.<br>  <br>  Here's the best that you can do with most integrated graphics:<br>  <br>  1. Maximize shared memory if you have large RAM installed.<br>  2. Play at low game settings and low resolution.<br>  3. Use 16bit color instead of 32bit.|`|ffqsWfZtaa	Not a lot you can do for laptop graphics except maybe allocate it more RAM.<br>  <br>  Most laptop graphics cards share the sytem ram, usually how much they get is configured in the BIOS so Esc, F2, Del, or whatever during startup and try adjusting there, of course that will reduce the RAM available to the system and potentially slow the laptop.
PLNkGmk9aa	It's very simple. Burn Windows 7 and make in BIOS boot from CD. Installation will star automaticlly but remeber it could work worse than XP... it needs better computer.

AA11434633	You don't need a generic monitor driver, my friend.  What you need to do is reinstall your graphics card driver.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  <br>  If you don't have the driver(s) for your laptop, you can select which operating system you're using on the following page and download them from there.  (I know you've said you reinstalled Vista, but the following site gives the choices of:<br>  <br>  Microsoft Windows Vista Business (32-bit)<br>  Microsoft Windows Vista Home Basic (32-bit)<br>  Microsoft Windows Vista Home Premium (32-bit)|`|200745acbaf74a0a9974fd7593e0859caa	It shouldn't need a driver but the best place to find one is on the monitors website.
DGdyHCOQaa	I would go with the EVGA card if you are planning to get one of these cards because EVGA is the most popular/mainstream brand for nvidea cards. Also it is superclocked meaning it should have a higher clock so you get an overclocked card where you do not do the overclocking and break the card.<br>  2 of these cards do not compare to a Radeon HD 4870 x2. Well they do but the Hd 4870x2 is much better and cheaper. It is because that a single 4870 beats a 9800GTX+ by around 5-10 framerates in benchmarks. I would suggest the Radeon HD 4870x2 but get a Sapphire instead of a Diamond because the Sapphire is cheaper and more mainstream.
tIDNEwdMaa	Does it come with an OS CD, keyboard and mouse?  Subtract accordingly from the price.  With an OS CD, Apple keyboard and mouse, I would be willing to pay $150 for it, if I was in the market.
SJM0rzHtaa	Yes it will work.  The Dell 1201MP projector comes with a standard VGA monitor cable.  All you need is the Apple miniDVI-to-VGA adapter to connect your white Macbook with it.  (You must buy the adapter separately).<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|vePlUSPSaa	yep works fine

5586ad15a09ab2f36457c1e8042071f2aa	A CDROM disk is based on audio CD disks and as such, come in 2 sizes, 74 and 80 minutes, which equates to 654mb and 700mb respectively. Floppies come in several sizes. 360kb, 720kb and 1.2mb for 5-1/4", 720kb and 1.44mb for 3-1/2" floppies. Simply divide the size of the CD by the capacity of the floppies you choose. This is an approximation for maximum capacity of floppies which are completely full with no unused space ONLY and does NOT relate to the number of files. If the floppies are not all full to capacity, the CD will hold MORE depending on how much unused space exists on each floppy. Remember, 1kb on a floppy is actually 1024 bytes, NOT 1000 bytes and 1mb is 1024kb, not 1000kb. A kilobyte is not a thousand bytes and a megabyte is not a million bytes, unless it actually SAYS thousand or million. Think of like a bookshelf. But, instead of simply putting books on the shelf, I only put the pages from each book with writing on the shelf. If I have a book with many empty pages, the copied pages will not occupy the same space as if I put the whole book there, see? This is why I said this is an approximation and only applies if the floppies were completely full.|`|aUmqiSOlaa	500 or so|`|vAIWT1yvaa	lots.<br>  <br>  just do the math<br>  <br>  a floppy disk is 1.4 megabytes<br>  <br>  a cd0rom (the regular, not na dvd) is up to 700 megabytes|`|jZjoDlBHaa	500 floppy disks = 1 CD|`|UKDXKnTraa	simple, divide 700mb by 1.4mb. do it.

Sometimes it is possible to download an antivirus or spyware program after a PC is infected, but usually it is not. It can be fixed with special software or by a local computer repair shop. Having done this myself for a few years, I can tell you that if you have no experience removing a virus or spyware, don't try it yourself.

7982e56b45af684f2c57a5d2fa899f87aa	What has probably happened is that you are using McAfee Internet that came with your Comcast subscription,that includes McAfee' Firewall, and since this Linksys Switch has a separate ,individual Sub-IP address, when you connected this linkys unit you did not allow it as one of your trusted IP'S/NETWORKS, which you should have done.<br>  So, open up your McAfee and choose the FIREWALL and change the permission given to any IP address that you know is your own and trusted. Make sure that you choose the option to allow. <br>  The IP'S associated with your network should be similar   to each other;meaning that the numbers will look almost the same with the exception of the last 1 or 2 digits.Also, you have a brand new IP address than the one you had with QWEST,and you will have to allow this and any other trusted ones.

It has approximately 16 million members, and is really popular among the tween and teen crowd (12-17 year olds). It offers Cliff Notes that are free to registered users, quizzes you can take, the chance to challenge your friends to quizzes, it uses a currency called "lunch money" as a virtual currency throughout the system. They also have a TV feature that allows you to watch certain television programs. You get a locker that allows you to store music, videos, documents, and other things and share them with friends. The whole site is basically a "school themed" social networking site. It is no safer than myspace or facebook. Any of the social networking sites can be used and you can keep yourself safe if you remember not to give out your real name, your full birth date, the location where you live (street address), telephone number, or pictures of yourself.

h0hSIgC1aa	Yes all "Pentium D" chips are dual core, and specifically refer to the code names "Smithfield" (the original Pentium D series) and it's successor, "Presler" (which did not offer any architectural advantage).  <br>  <br>  Both series were simply two Netburst architecture (Pentium 4) dies on a single MCM (multi-chip module) CPU package.  Compared to Core architecture CPUs, Netburst had serious drawbacks.  The main problem was the heat produced at high clock frequencies, the 130W TDP had a 4Ghz ceiling that could only be negated with high end water cooling.  It was pretty clear the future belonged to more efficient dual-core CPUs on a single die.<br>  <br>  So, during the rise of the Pentium D, AMD's Athlon 64 architecture (in particular the X2 dual-core series) gained popularity among PC enthusiasts because it was a working model of efficiency with a complete redesign of the base CPU structure - more efficient decoding stages, execution units, caches, and buses all added up to more power with less clock speed.  Intel did release the "extreme edition" of the Pentium D, which AMD fans called the "emergency edition" lol...  those were good times man :)<br>  <br>  So, Intel went through a complete organizational restructure, perhaps two, and got back on track to create the Core architecture - more efficient decoding stages, execution units, caches, and buses all added up to more power with less clock speed (sound familiar? lol).  They were very successful and to appease the enthusiast crowd they made them highly overclockable, some easily to 60% beyond stock speeds.  Very reminiscent of the venerable Celeron 300A chip based on the Pentium 2.  I had one running at 450Mhz for many years, until my generic PSU decided to bite me back for purchasing it... :(<br>  <br>  Compared to the old Pentium 4 / netburst chips, they produced the same processing power at relatively half the clock speed, and a fraction of the heat generated.  You can say they did not want to be bested by AMD, they are back - and with a vengeance :)<br>  <br>  <br>  Well hope that is not too much of a rant, it's always a good story.<br>  <br>  <br>  cheers|`|CbjggV0Haa	Yes, however the "D" does not refer to the Dual Core, it refers to Desktop PC, you can get pentium M for mobile (single core tho) <br>  <br>  :)|`|Bz1n7N0Raa	I think so, but dual cores are faster, and have bigger caches if the speds are the same ( i think)|`|7aqEtfLRaa	All the pentium Ds are dual core, and they are basically a lower end model of the core 2s.

pUzJiMUcaa	The Everlast is the better choice...to understand why, look at the definition of Standard Deviation: It is a measure of dispersion, meaning that the higher it is, the more scattered the plots in the graph. Put another way, Standard Deviation is the average distance of all points from the overall mean.<br>  <br>  In this case, the lower the deviation, the more likely you are to get the average amount of months, and not less. If you go with a deviation of 6, you are more likely to get LESS than 50 (although some argue that it could also mean that you could end up getting considerably more than 50, this doesn't make much sense if you do the math).<br>  <br>  If you have a Standard Dev of 2, that means that more plots are closer to 50. The average is more representative of the population, in this case.|`|nlMgXhoEaa	you want the one with the most warranty on it because if your battery's core goes and ur past that warranty then you would be buyin a new battery... also if your up north were it gets cold you want to get the one with the most cca's (cold cranking amps)... i recommend die hard batteries.

I3Ek5kpiaa	Before you consider includes/extends, you have to do a wee bit of rework to the diagram.<br>  <br>  The purpose of a Use Case diagram is to model the interaction between a system and its actors (people who interact with the system). It is a dynamic diagram and as such all use cases should involve doing something... i.e. the name of the  use case should be made up of a verb and a noun, Things like 'Register new user' and 'Login' are fine, however 'catalogue' and 'homepage' are not use cases... these are more likely to appear on class, sequence or communication diagrams.<br>  <br>  Without knowing more about the system you are designing, I can only help so much, but you may want to consider:<br>  1. The customer should be directly associated with 'login' and 'Register new user' as they are directly involved in this interaction.<br>  2. Who will change the password - will it be the customer, if so they should be directly associated.<br>  3. What is the maintanance, and who carries it out.<br>  4. With the survey, if the customer completes the survey there should be a use case 'complete survey' and in terms of persistance to the datastore 'store survey data'<br>  <br>  In terms of your original question the general rule for includes/extends, You use an include when one use case will always involve the other and you use entend when one use case may involve another.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps...|`|BmIjLD4aaa	A use case must represent a purposeful interaction between system and the User. Some of your use cases are not actual use case or not properly named. For example, Homepage or Catalogue I'm assuming it's just a misnaming. Chnage it to Brwose Homepage, Explore catalogue and alike.<br>  <br>  <<include>> is a situation that a use case is a part of another one. For example in most web-based systems a successful registeration is automatically followed by Login so you can say Register New User includes Login. But then again your Login use case needs a direct connection with Customer otherwise it would mean that it's not accessible!<br>  <br>  <<extend>> is asepcial case, where a use case runs an exception of a regular use case. For example when Login fails the customer may select to register as a new customer. This means that the Register New User extends Login use case.<br>  <br>  Make sure your actors are real users. I don't know who could a data store be?<br>  <br>  good luck

AbRfd29Haa	The ability to change graphics cards in some laptops exists, but it is rare. There are two different modules in use: Axiom and MXM. They're really not intended for user-level upgrades, but it's technically possible if you had one of these. Most laptops don't, including the HP I'm typing this on. <br>  <br>  Your laptop doesn't even have a proper graphics chip, so no, you can't. Graphics cards are possible when the graphics chip is a separate things, as with a nVidia 8600M chip, for example (the one in my HP here). But most manufacturers have not been using modules, but rather, building those chips directly onto the system board -- so, no upgrades. <br>  <br>  One notch further down the ladder is the integrated graphics chip, like your Intel 945. That's built-in to the main system chips used to create your laptop system.. it's not a separate piece, you can't break it out. So, no card, period. <br>  <br>  You really need to shop around for graphics as you number 1 concern if you want gaming of any sort on a laptop. Due to heat, space, and market pressure, most laptops have pretty bad graphics for gaming.. it's not just the Intel chip, either. nVidia x1xx and x2xx series aren't much better.. you really want an x6xx, at the least, for decent gaming (if you're a Crysis fan, you better get an x8xx or two). Similar things are true of the AMD/ATi line of graphics chips. All of the higher level graphics chips have their own dedicated memory, too, while the cheaper ones share memory with the CPU. <br>  <br>  There's one possible solution... external graphics. There are many USB solutions, but they're not fast. There's at least one which works via your ExpressPort card slot, the Asus XG Station, which puts a nVidia 8600 card in an external box, and will drive an external monitor. It's not a portable solution, but could give you faster graphics at home, if you have a monitor. And around $300 or so. And if you can find it... it may only be available in Australia.

fCOq04lNaa	Well what's your power supply? That's usually a limiting factor in choosing a graphics card. A 6200 is pretty old these days and don't perform very well.<br>  <br>  Higher MB on a graphics card will lead to an improvement, and try getting 256MB or 512MB of memory. However, the lower end 1GB cards are usually gimmicks, as most low end cards can rarely use 1GB of memory. It's more worth it to get the next level 512MB card.<br>  <br>  As for a recommendation, try the Geforce 8400 GS PCI(it's not AGP but decent AGP cards are hard to find these days and are usually overpriced. 99% of computers have PCI slots.)<br>  <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814187042" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...</a>|`|i0WQzVDZaa	Well depending on how old your mother board is you may not be able to upgrade to the card you want. More memory on the video card is good. You also may not have enough power with you power supply to run a top of the line card. Your best bet is to check out some websites such as nvidia and see what their cards support or your local computer shop will be able to help you.

DSZGuWAeaa	the pins on the inside of the computer are like a 6 prong connector with one missing.  they should at the back of the motherboard close to the edge.<br>  are you saying that you want to  hook up the internal speaker you have to a newer PC.<br>  If so, There are several adapters for sale at Various places.  most of them come with images that you can enlarge and match to what you already have. but a lot of motherboards only come with a few audio interfaces. one of the board itself that you hook your CD/DVD drive to to get sound out of the front of it with headphones, and one on the back Panel that you can plug your speakers or headphones to.<br>  You can use the first one that I mentioned to hook up alternatives as well. On my computer I hooded it to the audio interface on top of the computer. This link will take you to your motherboard specs. you can scroll down and see a picture of your motherboard and definitions for the connectors.<br>  <a href="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?lc=en&dlc=en&cc=us&docname=bph07813" rel="nofollow">http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/docum...</a>|`|044IeGstaa	The HP Pavilion 576X uses a TriGem 2002052  motherboard.<br>  1.<a href="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?docname=bph07813&lc=en&dlc=en&cc=us&product=343002?=en" rel="nofollow">http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/docum...</a><br>  <br>  The connections for an internal audio speaker are in the Front Panel header, (Connector), shown in the bottom right, of the motherboard illustration, and the photo.<br>  <br>  Which ones are the speaker pins? Good question since this is a TriGem Imperial motherboard, and HP ain't handing any Motherboard Manuals out for it. Neither is TriGem, and I couldn't find it on Motherboards.org.<br>  <br>  Sooooo, I just opened up an HP Pavilion 563w, someone gave me to fix and have. (Two Electrolytic Capacitors on the motherboard are bad. No big deal. They're for the processor, and I'll have them replaced in a jiff)<br>  <br>  Guess what? There are no speaker pins! Just bare solder points, where the pins should have been. The mobo (Motherboard) is marked -> Speaker <- where the pins should be. (Look closely with a flashlight, move sum wires. You'll see this)<br>  <br>  There is no 'Squawk Box' either. Tells me they expect you to use the audio connectors on the back, should you wish to hear any BIOS Beep codes.<br>  <br>  This is your option also. Connect speaker/s to the rear of the computer, using the audio jack/s.<br>  <br>  Edit: The Front Panel header uses 4 pins for these type of computers. However, as said, there are NO pins! Just rounded over, tiny blobs of shiny solder.<br>  <br>  Edit 2: My Bad! There are Two different mobo's used for the HP Pavilion 500 series. TriGem, and Asus.<br>  If your serial number on the back starts with a KR or CH, it is a Trigem mobo. If it starts with an MX, it is an Asus.<br>  <a href="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?lc=en&dlc=en&cc=us&lang=en&product=242024&docname=bph07845" rel="nofollow">http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/docum...</a><br>  Where it shows -> HPANEL 1 <- is the Front Panel header.<br>  The speaker pins WERE, the last four solder points on the left. You will see Two box like shapes, for this pin area. All the way to the left of the Front Panel header. The pins are represented by dots. One on top of the other. The last two rectangular box shapes, are where the Speaker pins should have been.

I've heard a lot of bad things about Vista. Its now selling at a cheaper price than XP, in many places. This is not without a reason. <br>   But to be honest, XP too expands with the passage of time. When I bought my laptop, XP took far lesser disk space than it does today. I have not so far been able to find out why this is so. I have not installed as much software as the disk space taken.|`|AA12067976	vista constantly updates, taking up a lot of hard drive space, all i have to say is get your stuff on an external hard drive and swipe your hard drive then load xp on it <br>  <br>  this is because if you dont have enough space to actually run vista it will slow your computer down<br>  <br>  so if you want vista you need a computer with enough hard drive space to update vista and function properly

UV8bN0Giaa	HP is good but you also can't go wrong and I personally recommend Dell! There are hidden long-run costs that one does not initially see when you purchase a Notebook PC other than Dell, HP or IBM and later encounter difficulties or attempt buying replacement parts like a battery, or say a keyboard etc.<br>  <br>  Also if you're buying for college then I do NOT recommend a Notebook PC bigger than 15.4" bec we have 3 DELLs incl a larger 17" Notebook PC and the larger ones are nice but much too heavy to lug around campus as well as too big for lecture hall desks in college... <br>  <br>  I mentioned we own 3 Dell Notebook PCs and why I recommend DELL, HP or IBM for those living in the United States is that those 3 particular PC Notebook manufacturers literally supply all the business Notebook PCs to the major corporations and Government so replacement parts are readily available esp on EBAY at even a more reasonable price than the manufacturer website. Thus in the long run, being able to get the exact replacement part extends the life on your investment.<br>  <br>  FYI my 1st Notebook PC was Gateway bec I couldn't afford Dell at the time and what a mistake is was when I needed to purchase a new Notebook battery <= costly bec not readily available like Dells... and FYI I also ran into a similar problem when attempting to upgrade the memory.<br>  <br>  Note if you are looking for DELL bargains, then visit their DELL OUTLET site...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dell.com/outlet" rel="nofollow">http://www.dell.com/outlet</a><br>  <br>  Hope Above Info Helps!|`|eTLG23N4aa	Most Lappys are junk compared to a PC.

Pxkqq8r2aa	I had a similar problem with a wd sata drive awhile back. sometimes worked sometimes didnt. I removed the plate over the connector on the drive and cleaned the connector with methylated spirits. That fixed the problem. Also grab another cable from somewhere and try replacing it. Not a bad idea also to blow out any dust from the connector - you can get can of compressed air from local electronics shop to do this. Also, make sure the sata power supply is seated firmly, and clean the connectors for that. <br>  <br>  Should fix the problem.|`|c1b4b7f8e314ae3b676971e55c6665dcaa	Sounds like motherboard or hard drive.  If you get lightrs and the fans run, it's not likely the power supply.  Could also be bad cables.  They do go bad.  Reconnect everything from motherboard to your hard drive and make sure they are firmly in place.  In such cases, I just swap parts from my large parts inventory and find the problem that way.

You may need to go into bios and look at the options at the bottom of the screen and chose default settings in order to get it to find the hard drive, but I would do this as a last resort.|`|SIGvaB1jaa	I guest you have un IDE drive and this type they have pin settings that can be modify like master,slave or cable select and also some bios do not recognized biger drives that they supposed to allow, that it is the manucfactur of drives provided a disk with the drivers to install that drive and reconfigured the bios to allow and recognized your drive and if you do not have you can get it for free in their site, the drivers in that program allow you to install that drive as a slave inside windows so you can clone you old drive or created a bootable flopy disk,pendrive or CD so you can install your drive and format it in boot time.|`|c1b4b7f8e314ae3b676971e55c6665dcaa	Did you change anything?  Is this a different hard drive?  You may need to change the jumper settings on the hard drive.  If this is the same hard drive and it just quit working, then it's probably the hard drive that has failed.  Sometimes, removing the cables and reinstalling them will get it running again but not for long.  You probably need a new one.

In the black window that opens up, type ipconfig then hit Enter. You will see your IP address. It will be 192.168.X.X if your router is correctly set up. If you have an IP address of 169.254.X.X, it's not set up correctly. You should reset the router with a paper clip then run the install wizard after logging on to the router. If that doesn't get you a good IP address, you can call D-Link tech support for more help.<br>  The primary and secondary DNS IP addresses are supplied by your ISP and should be in their documentation.

dfjIBHe3aa	Magickman is essentially correct, but having installed Fedora both "correctly" and with every mistake it is possible to make, I want to caution you about three things: hope for the best but prepare for the worst, that is BACK UP YOUR HARD DRIVE.  Period.  2.  Just before running the installer, run disk defragmenter.  Windows is designed to write files wherever it wants to and to not always be honest about where it is storing them, thus the only way to BE SURE you have a large enough free space is to run disk defragmenter JUST before repartitioning the disk.  3.  Read two or three tutorials on repartitioning the hard drive and installing Linux as a dual boot before you even try it.<br>  <br>  Aside from that, at this point I have to say the live CD/DVD is awesome.  I really like it better than the installable version (which I last ran in August).  Still, there was a point in my life when Red Hat (as it was then) was one of the most important things, and maybe you will install and fall it love with it.  The Gnome Desktop is better than the KDE one.|`|DQPYoMg1aa	I am very familiar with Fedora, in fact, I am a tester for the company.

AA10332654	As your card reader is affected when this occurs you probably have a corrupted card reader driver. Card readers are connected via an internal USB port, not an external USB port. I recommend you go to your Dell Drivers and Downloads page at Dell Support. Each Dell system has it individual drivers and downloads page. As this is a new computer you should be able to connect to your page via the Dell Support Centter applet which you access through the All Programs menu, or type in Dell Support in the Start Menu Search Box if you are running Vista. You can access it via All Programs in Vista too. <br>  <br>  Once you have Dell Support Center open click on the Drivers and Downloads button. Your default browser will open to your appropriate drivers and downloads page. Please note that at the top of the Dell Support Center applet all of your system information and your systems Service Tag plus the duration of your warranty is displayed. This is the information you require when contacting Dell or using the Dell Community Forums. The Dell Community Forums are well ran, easy to use and manned with expert volunteers. Please go there is what I recommend here doesn't work out for you. <br>  <br>  Once at the Drivers and Downloads page, under CD/DVD, locate an entry with Card Reader at the end of the serial number. Click on that and a new page with download instructions will open. Print out the installation instructions. I recommend you download to your Desktop in XP or your Downloads folder in Vista. You can download to any location you choose in either OS. Click each ( + ) sign to open all information in order to ensure you print out everything needed. Pay special attention to the installation instructions.<br>  <br>  It is very important to follow installation instruction carefully. Please read through them twice before beginning installation as to familiarize yourself with the process. This driver update is a bit more complicated than most other drivers. Please note you may need to actually unplug your computer for one minute after shut down before restarting system. This clears any information stored in memory and refreshes with new information. <br>  <br>  As I said before, if for any reason this does not correct your issue please to go the Dell Community Forums. I am disappointed that Best Buy failed to preform these steps for you regardless of whether or not the error situation occurred while they had the system. They should have proceeded with a driver update for you. I suggest you file a complaint with either Best Buy because they failed to uphold your warranty. Also, if this for any reason does not get corrected you have the right, under your warranty to exchange your system. Please take note of that. Also note that the Dell Support Center has several Help options. Please take the time to familiarize yourself with these options so as to take advantage of them throughout the life of your system. <br>  <br>  Good luck and I hope this is corrected quickly.  <br>  <br>  P.S. If for some odd reason you do not have the Dell Support Center applet on your system you can locate your Drivers and Downloads page by visiting <a href="http://www.dell.com/support" rel="nofollow">http://www.dell.com/support</a>  Then, click on Drivers and Downloads, enter your Service Tag number or your model number and your individual page will appear.|`|Bg3jPwACaa	apples suck shitface dont go with anything apple|`|c5FSGxxqaa	<a href="http://www.apple.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.apple.com/</a>|`|xdlsGvldaa	Plug in a USB devise in all ports and boot up your lap top after it recognises the devises look at the task try for a icon showing safely remove devises and click on the icon then remove the devises from the USB ports and it should fix the problem.

A 21 inch monitor goes for about $250 brand new, I would take half off for used, and make it $125.

No matter what you are printing you are probably to some degree using all 4 cartridges, therefore they ALL must be present and have ink in order to your epson printer to work.|`|z46THMt8aa	Ink is a lubricant for the print head, so some of each color is used no matter what color you are trying to print. If you ran your printer with a color missing, you would eventually destroy that print head. Also, if you let a color run empty and leave it like that, the dried ink in the heads would clog it. never allow your printer to run out of a color for an extended period of time. Turn your printer on even when not using it to keep the ink circulating.<br>  <br>  The biggest complaint about all inkjets is the high cost of ink cartridges. <a href="http://ccs-digital.com" rel="nofollow">http://ccs-digital.com</a> has cartridges for about $4.50 each. They also have a unique product - a two-piece cartridge where the ink is in a separate tank inside the cartridge. When the ink runs out, you replace just the ink tank and the original chip resets itself to full.  By keeping the same chip, you save 1.50 per cartridge. Ink tanks are only $3 and hold 50% more ink than disposable cartridges.

You should check your motherbopard manual (google it if you dont have a hard copy) and investigate what its capable of accepting.

Prices start at $40 (second hand 3.0 ghz Pentium D [which wouldnt give you much additional speed] and go up the several hundred for quad cores. A decently clocked dual core should be adequate for most purposes. e8400/8500/8600's are really good cpu's, and start at $160<br>  <br>  An e5200 would give you a nice speed bump and they're only $80ish (all prices US$) <br>  <br>  See <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&N=2010340343%2050001157&name=Intel" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductLis...</a> for more prices<br>  <br>  The actual task of replacing it is pretty straightforward.

Your Celeron has only 1, and the 4 cores in the Core 2 Quad will really shine in things like multi-tasking, video encoding, and gaming. A C2Q also has a more efficient core design that allows it to perform more instructions per cycle. <br>  <br>  In total, expect the Core 2 Quad to be 2-8 times faster than the Celeron.

Perhaps the manufacturer of ur hd might have a free one.<br>  * Try installing the software driver that came with ur external hd first, then plug the hd in<br>  * Check to see if plug and play is disabled in the system BIOS<br>  * Check if ur USB port is not working or is disabled<br>  * Is ur USB port 1.0 or 2.0? And what is the ext hd? 2.0 I guess.<br>  * Plug it at the back (usually more highly powered) rather than the front or on the keyboard or monitor<br>  * Check Device Manager and see if the necessary driver is missing<br>  * Does ur external hd enclosure have enough power to run the hard drive? Sounds like a stupid ques but its not. They've been cases where the amps supplied was not enough for the drive to spin the disk.<br>  * If it is a new drive, try formatting it. Go to Disk Management & right click your new hd drive which might be named something like Hard Disk 1. Initialize and format<br>  * Go to disk manager and check what the external usb hard drive is listed as (letter) because if u had a mapped drive b4 and ur ext hd is trying to use the same drive letter, it would conflict each other. In that case disconnected the mapped drive if not using anymore or change ur ext hd letter<br>  * Check the drive's pin to see if it slave or master<br>  * Try starting the pc with the drive off... and also with it on<br>  * Go to Control Panel -> Performance and Maintenance -> Administrator Tools -> Services -> Universal Plug and Play. Switch Universal Plug and Play to automatic if it is set to manual<br>  * Go to 'Start' --> 'Run' and type: chkdsk x: /r (substituting your drive letter for 'x')<br>  * Might be a physical problem with ur external hd<br>  * Listen and feel the hd--- is it spinning... r u hearing anything... does anything sound abnormal?<br>  <br>  R u scratching ur head now?

Despite sometimes having a slightly higher initial purchase cost, Macintosh computers have substantially lower TOTAL COST OF OWNERSHIP. <br>  <br>  Myth #2<br>  "There’s no real difference between Macs and PCs." <br>  Response: There are BIG differences. For instance, compared to Windows PCs, the Mac OS is easier to learn, requires fewer keystrokes for similar tasks, and results in much higher user productivity. <br>  <br>  Is this still true for Windows Vista?<br>  Of course! Mac OS X is significantly better than Windows Vista. <br>  <br>  Myth #3<br>  "Students need a Windows/PC experience." <br>  (Variation: "Schools should be using Windows/PCs since more businesses do.") <br>  Response: Agree that Windows experience could be worthwhile! But educating students on computers involves MUCH more than exposing them to Windows. Macs can also run a Windows or Linux operating system simultaneously, for FREE, essentially providing two+ computers for the price of one. And there are at least TEN GOOD REASONS why schools should NOT use computers based on what businesses use. <br>  <br>  Myth #4<br>  "There have been problems with our existing Macs."<br>  Response: Macs are VERY reliable. Compared to Windows PCs, Macs are MUCH easier to support — and when properly maintained, they experience FAR fewer problems. Furthermore, Macs are more secure — e.g. they are MUCH less prone to virus attacks. <br>  <br>  Myth #5<br>  "Mac statistics are outdated, etc."<br>  Response: In communications with school MIS personnel, an assortment of other Mac criticisms came out. Contentions about our statistics being outdated, about the quantity of Mac software available, about Apple single-sourceness, etc. are simply NOT LEGITIMATE. <br>  <br>  Myth #6<br>  "PCs are faster than Macs"<br>  Response: First of all, in a school setting, speed is hardly paramount. Secondly, for business and school related application usage, the performance of Macs is equal to or better than high-end PCs.|`|BQsPZZfYaa	Well, Macs are less virus-prone, easier to use, faster, and ready out-of-the-box.

HBAMQJPLaa	What is software piracy?<br>  <br>  Unlike other things you purchase, the software applications and fonts you buy don't belong to you. Instead, you become a licensed user — you purchase the right to use the software on a single computer, but you can't put copies on other machines or pass that software along to colleagues. Software piracy is the illegal distribution and/or reproduction of  software applications or fonts for business or personal use. Whether software piracy is deliberate or not, it is still illegal and punishable by law.<br>  <br>  Piracy comes in many forms. Here are some common piracy methods:<br>  <br>  Licensed user duplication for unlicensed users <br>  Illegal Internet distribution <br>  Illegal use of software over a network <br>  Distributing specialized education versions to unauthorized markets <br>  Distribution of inauthentic  software or fonts|`|jWO10NN5aa	No.  You must buy it, you pirate.|`|3QxqB5xBaa	You can download keys from:<br>  www.kavkiskey.com<br>  <br>  Theres a lot of kaspersky antivirus 2009 and kaspersky internet security 2009 in there for free..when kaspersky detects as a phishing site just allow it..theres no malicious in that site for it just offer a free key.|`|7vsa6Xe9aa	Yeah, they are out there on the internet:<br>  <a href="https://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4733327/Kaspersky_Internet_Security_2009_(8.0.0.506)_Keys_By_ChattChitto" rel="nofollow">https://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4733327...</a><br>  <br>  However, it is illegal to use keys like this.

zorYTX59aa	If your YouTube is getting bombarded with "JavaScript" and <br>  "Flash Player" messages, and people are telling you to get<br>  or install something, DON'T TOUCH A THING.<br>  <br>  You will get absolutely nowhere messing around with "Java", <br>  "Flash" or different web browsers -- and definitely avoid any<br>  software that sales-pimps (disguised as answerers here on <br>  Yahoo) are trying to "sucker" you into buying.<br>  <br>  None of those things will help you, because your computer <br>  and YouTube were working perfectly fine a while ago, right? <br>  The first rule-of-thumb and best option should ALWAYS be:<br>  don't disable, erase, uninstall, switch, download, alter, add, <br>  change or install anything. That'll only make matters worse.<br>  <br>  I'm 100% positive both your "JavaScript" and "Flash Player"<br>  are fine. Nothing about watching YouTube videos has really<br>  changed in the past couple of years. If anything, the newer<br>  Flash Players have been known to give many YouTubers a <br>  lot of trouble, especially all 5 variations of version 10. (Why <br>  in the world is there a 10.0.525, 10.1.218, 10.2.26, 10.2.54<br>  and 10.12.36? The only thing that most upgrades are good <br>  for is their potential to create all kinds of software conflicts).<br>  <br>  Your problem may fix itself within a couple hours, or by the<br>  next day, because YouTube often "shuts down" a bunch of<br>  their own servers every single day without warning anybody, <br>  in order to update all kinds of stuff. During those occasions, <br>  it is actually YouTube's data transmissions of "Java" and/or <br>  "Flash" that are poor -- not yours.<br>  <br>  If the following day your YouTube is still stuck and showing <br>  you those awful "JavaScript" and "Flash Player" messages, <br>  it is possible that your subdirectories of "temporary internet <br>  files" and memory (many times called "cache") are entirely<br>  maxxed out and cannot take anymore, the end result being<br>  that YouTube videos cannot even make it onto your screen.<br>  <br>  "Temporary internet files" are tiny bits of webpages that get <br>  permanently put on your computer's hard-drive. They'll stay <br>  there forever and ever, gradually plugging up your computer <br>  much like hair slowly clogs a sink drain, until you get rid of <br>  them. The solution to that is to first exit YouTube, and then <br>  clear your "cache" of all its "TIFs" as well as your "cookies" <br>  and "history". Then reboot.<br>  <br>  Note 1: if you've got Google Web Accelerator or something<br>  similar to it...dump it, burn it, trash it, disable it, uninstall it; <br>  do all you can to get rid of it -- even though this contradicts <br>  my advice uptop. GWA conflicts with YouTube. Clicking on<br>  "Don't Accelerate This Website" won't help you whatsoever. <br>  (Some downloaders and converters also ruin YouTube too.)<br>  <br>  Note 2: longer videos only require "Flash" and "Shockwave"<br>  in order to play smooth. Other than that, avoid all the sales <br>  pitches that some Yahooers are shilling, because they are <br>  really disguised sales-people and peddlers. Their "answers" <br>  have nothing to do with your problem, and their wares may<br>  worsen your problem. Besides, what kind of selfish answer <br>  is that? [my paraphrase] "Although you cannot even watch <br>  or access videos, buy our downloader."<br>  <br>  Note 3: a very odd fix that once worked for me was altering<br>  the URL from "www.youtube.com" to simply "youtube.com"<br>  (or you could even try "ca.youtube.com").|`|owxFbRnNaa	javascript is usually turned on by default...so, it might be your flash player is outdated..<br>  <br>  you can try a different browser...<br>  <br>  these will help you...<br>  <br>  1. Use Opera browser, it will load faster and smoother,  and re-install latest flash (the correct way)<br>  <br>  get the latest flash player, and install it.. make sure all the browsers are NOT running during installation... this is the right way to install the flash player.<br>  <br>  by the way, the javascript is turned on by default.<br>  <br>  OR..<br>  <br>  2. It could be due to slow connection or high traffic.<br>  Try watching it during off peak hours, the video will be smoother.<br>  <br>  Or you could watch it offline smoothly... try using 'zillatube' .<br>  <br>  It works well - Just google search "zillatube" to get it.<br>  <br>  ==========================???|`|7xr3qWBraa	maybe its TURNED OFF go to internet options and turn it on
S9vnARx8aa	Ok, I'm using CS3 so my menus may be a bit different that what you have...You need to save the image with a clipping mask in photoshop. select just the image you want - be sure to select as close as possible to the actual image (an easy way to do this is select the white background with the wand tool and then going to select- select inverse) then go to paths(you may have to go to window - paths), make your selection a work path, right click on that path and choose make clipping path. then save as a psd and 'place' it in illustrator. That should get rid of your white background problem.
zorYTX59aa	If "your browser sent a request that this server <br>  couldn't understand" + "size of request header <br>  field exceeds server limit", then your particular<br>  "request" might be a bad or supersized cookie.<br>  (The same thing is true for "Error 400" codes.)<br>  <br>  For some very odd reason, it seems that 9 out <br>  of 10 error messages like these involve Firefox.<br>  <br>  Simply delete all your cookies, and everything<br>  should be fine. Don't worry about getting rid of<br>  them; nothing bad will happen. You won’t lose <br>  any of your internet browser's "Bookmarks" or <br>  "Favorites". The worst thing that will happen is<br>  that you'll be prompted to type your username <br>  and password again when you revisit YouTube<br>  and a few other websites -- that's all.<br>  <br>  While you're erasing your cookies, you should <br>  also delete your "temporary internet files" plus<br>  your "history", to make your computer fresh in <br>  YouTube's eyes. It's also best if you shutdown <br>  and then reboot:<br>  <br>  Internet Explorer 6:<br>  → Tools → Internet Options <br>  → Delete Cookies → OK<br>  → Delete Files → OK<br>  → Clear History → Yes <br>  → OK<br>  <br>  Internet Explorer 7:<br>  → Tools → Internet Options → Delete...<br>  → Delete files → Yes<br>  → Delete cookies → OK<br>  → Delete history → OK<br>  → Close (browsing history window)<br>  → OK<br>  <br>  Mozilla Firefox<br>  → Tools → Clear Private Data<br>  [x] Browsing History<br>  [x] Download History<br>  [x] Saved Form and Search History<br>  [x] Cache<br>  [x] Cookies<br>  → Clear Private Data Now|`|kep1iGHpaa	You need to delete your cookies.<br>  <br>  If you have FireFox go to Tools, Clear Private Data, and then check whatever boxes you want as long as the cookies box is checked and press OK.<br>  <br>  If you have Internet Explorer I'm not exactly sure how to. <br>  Should be about the same basic process.

iaUo3tvMaa	"The results of your Google searches are ranked according to Google’s trademarked PageRank technology. This technology measures how many other pages link to a particular page; the more links to a page, the higher that page ranks. In addition, PageRank assigns a higher weight to links that come from higher-ranked pages. So if a page is linked to from a number of high-ranked pages, that page will itself achieve a higher ranking. The theory is that the more popular a page is, the higher that page’s ultimate value. While this sounds a little like a popularity contest (and it is), it’s surprising how often this approach delivers high-quality results. The number of Web pages indexed by Google is among the largest of all search engines (Google and AllTheWeb are continually jockeying for “biggest” bragging rights), which means you stand a fairly good chance of actually finding what you were searching for. And the Google search engine is relatively smart; it analyzes the keywords in your query and recognizes the type of search result you’re looking for.

It may be that you don't have the software on your computer to open the type of pic you are sending?   Also, the pics may have been corrupted after you emailed them, so you should try emailing them again.  If you have a choice, email them as a JPG.<br>  <br>  If that doesn't work, here's where to can get a cheap usb bluetooth dongle.<br>  <br>  You can buy a usb bluetooth dongle (a bluetooth transceiver) for < $20.

CUqXYNHvaa	Abstract. There are several processes by which digitised radiographs may be obtained. One arrangement has a transilluminated film radiograph, viewed by a television camera, whose output is digitised by a frame grabber, stored in a microcomputer and presented as a digital image on a graphics display system. The system used in the present study generates images with 512*512 pixels, each containing up to 256 quantised grey scales. For large area radiography, these images are undersampled, but the system is adequate for examining small areas, and not only serves to illustrate the software method, which is more generally applicable, but also is quite adequate for the purpose of optimising a standard non-digital system.

For example, I spent $1200 up front on my Dell Inspiron that lasted two years. In those two years, I paid around $400 in repairs. During that entire time, Dell support was an absolute disaster. My laptop currently refuses to recognize its AC adapter, which I was very dismayed to learn is a hugely common problem with Dell laptops. Best of all, paying to have it repaired will only fix the problem temporarily.  <br>  <br>  That being said, my parents' Dell desktop has lasted them for six years with little problems, aside from the terrible customer service. Whatever their problem is, it seems to stem from the laptops specifically.<br>  <br>  I'm in the process of switching to a macbook. I've worked with them in the past, and am excited for the switch. The Apple tech support is wonderful, and if you have the need for Windows you can use Boot Camp to run both Leopard and Windows on your computer. They are all in all wonderful computers. They ARE more expensive up front (beginning at $999), but considering all the money you'll spend on repairs for a Dell computer, it's a much better deal.|`|YESUhp8gaa	Dell<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Apple likes to crash on some non-apple software.|`|JxxZpxqmaa	Go apple, I heard you receive a sweet new lifestyle that comes in the box.|`|vSTihS5uaa	Dell|`|AA11235375	I have 3 HP laptops and I love them all.

zorYTX59aa	If you are telling us your sound works fine but not YouTube,<br>  I don't think I have ever seen a more stupid and self-serving<br>  reply than the one from answerer # 3:<br>  -- might have turned the volume down<br>  -- or you might have muted it before<br>  -- a cookie might have kept it that way<br>  -- it could be due to slow connection<br>  -- or it could be due to high traffic<br>  -- try watching it during off peak hours<br>  -- solution: BUY OUR DOWNLOADER.<br>  By the way, 'cookies' are tiny files that websites plunk onto <br>  your computer about your viewing preferences, such as the<br>  features that you have enabled on your YouTube homepage. <br>  Cookies do not affect sound whatsoever.<br>  <br>  I see questions similar to yours every few days on Y!A now,<br>  so I recently did a whole lot of Googling, searching, reading<br>  and going through dozens of websites, only to discover that <br>  there's no definitive answer out there. <br>  <br>  The only semblance of a part solution which kind of worked<br>  for a few people would require you to either:<br>  1 -- mess around with your registry (which I would be totally <br>  deadset against because that could really screw things up); <br>  2 -- download some strange "utility" (which I'd be even more<br>  against, because that kind of stuff is what probably created<br>  your problem in the first place).<br>  <br>  Thus, my first piece of advice to you: shutdown then reboot.<br>  If that doesn't work, this is what I advise many other people<br>  when YouTube is slow, stuck or weird:....Clear your "cache"<br>  of all its "Temporary Internet Files". While you're doing that,<br>  you should also clear your "History" and your "Cookies", in <br>  order to make your computer "fresh". My famous triple-cure<br>  seemingly resolves many people's YouTube problems, thus<br>  why not yours. Please reboot after doing this:<br>  <br>  Internet Explorer 6:<br>  → Tools → Internet Options <br>  → Delete Cookies → OK<br>  → Delete Files → OK<br>  → Clear History → Yes <br>  → OK<br>  <br>  Internet Explorer 7:<br>  → Tools → Internet Options → Delete...<br>  → Delete files → Yes<br>  → Delete cookies → OK<br>  → Delete history → OK<br>  → Close (browsing history window)<br>  → OK<br>  <br>  Mozilla Firefox<br>  → Tools → Clear Private Data<br>  [x] Browsing History<br>  [x] Download History<br>  [x] Saved Form and Search History<br>  [x] Cache<br>  [x] Cookies<br>  → Clear Private Data Now<br>  <br>  If that doesn't do the trick, here are some other suggestions:<br>  <br>  ? If you've got "Google Web Accelerator" or anything similar,<br>  uninstall it immediately. GWA destroys YouTube.<br>  <br>  ? Long videos require both "Flash" and "Shockwave" to play<br>  properly. Shockwave includes Flash, but not vice versa.<br>  <br>  ? The most recent versions of Flash are regularly frustrating<br>  a lot of YouTubers. Most updates are typically good for only <br>  1 thing: potential software conflicts. If you are using 1 of the <br>  5 different versions of version 10 (yes -- there actually are 5), <br>  you may want to consider this other "Best Answer" of mine:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20081125075929AABZpVS">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a><br>  <br>  ? Avoid crappy add-ons, downloaders and converters. There <br>  are a lot of answerers on Yahoo! who are actually disguised <br>  salespeople. If anyone's solution is for you to buy/install/get<br>  something, please keep in mind that their answers probably<br>  have nothing to do with your question, and that the products<br>  they're peddling will no doubt worsen your problem. Besides, <br>  what kind of boffo and self-serving answer is that? "Although <br>  you cannot listen to YouTube videos or watch them properly,<br>  buy our downloader". [my paraphrase]<br>  <br>  ? Sometimes when you start a brand new YouTube session,<br>  the volume is actually set at zero. Maybe all you need to do<br>  is scroll up the volume of the video player.<br>  <br>  ? Who knows why it works, but sometimes things go better<br>  when you change the web URL from "www.youtube.com" to<br>  just "youtube.com", or you could even try "ca.youtube.com".<br>  <br>  ? A few people found success by closing their web browser, <br>  then restarting it.

If you want a freebie, 7Zip is the way to go.  Yes, it does support extracting to your desktop.  Any zip program does.  The desktop is really just a special folder, similar to any other folder on your computer, but with some special properties.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you want to pay for a program, I suggest WinRAR.  I'm not familiar with Powerzip.|`|QYPrM3GPaa	You need to have an unzipping program that allows you to extract files to the desktop.  Winzip is sort of expensive, I use another one that can even do Linux TAR files as well as all kinds of windows files, and it is called Powerzip.  It is a lot cheaper than Winzip and just as good if not better because Winzip cannot do TAR and other LInux files.<br>  <br>  There are freebies, like 7Zip you can download, but I don't know if they allow extraction to the desktop.<br>  <br>  PS - Mozilla Firefox browser has a download manager and extraction utility built in for FREE.|`|wkLTTr06aa	Hi There,<br>  You should be able to "copy" and then "paste" your files to your desktop or any folder.<br>  Try this:<br>  Open your "Documents" folder and select all the files you want by holding down the "control" key and clicking on each file.<br>  With all the files highlighted, right click any of the highlighted files and move your cursor to the "Copy" option and left click. This selects all the files to be pasted next.<br>  Finally, minimize the "Documents" folder (or move it to show the desktop). Move the cursor to any vacant place on the desktop, right click and select "Paste".<br>  That should move all selected (highlighted) files to the desktop.<br>  Hope this helps,<br>  Al|`|m1qtlsjqaa	you can download WinRar and this will extract all those files. www.rarlabs.com download the top one in the download section. <br>  this is a free trial but it last for 40 days and it works good. no need to pay for it. or you can download the Winzip self extractor.

It is really great. If you are a windows user you can use the Windows Movie Maker. I think it makes poor movies though.

Much better than using a crack. The chances of getting caught are the same as with any illegal download really. All in all, use safe reputable downloading sites and you shouldn't have any problems.|`|Mxe36NZEaa	You could always go into your firewall settings and block the program from accessing the internet.

maI66F3Faa	If the file never saved then you cannot recover it.  Un-saved data is only stored in RAM, which is volatile.<br>  <br>  If you did save it and it got deleted then you can (possibly) retrieve it.<br>  <br>  All deleted files (via IE or recycle bin) can be recovered!<br>  <br>  For the average user, there is no way to use it. But lets say you had a file recovery program. Than yes you can recover deleted files and anybody can view them. You need to get a program that "erases files" not just deletes them. Google programs that do just that.<br>  <br>  "Windows Washer" is an example of one of those programs.<br>  <br>  When you delete a file it goes to the recycle bin.<br>  When you empty the recycle bin the pointers (reference link the the file) to that file are deleted. Eventually the file will get written over, but the file is still on your computer. EVERYTHING YOU DELETE IS!<br>  Programs are made to erase the file and make them unrecoverable.<br>  <br>  To retrieve these files you will need a file recovery wizard.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=file+recovery+wizard" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=fil...</a><br>  <br>  To erase the contents (of a file, folder, or the entire HDD):<br>  You need a program that erases the hardrive.  <br>  You can search the internet for freeware.<br>  <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/downloads/file/fid,22920-order,1-page,1-c,alldownloads/description.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.pcworld.com/downloads/file/fi...</a><br>  This is an example of a program that will erase the contents off your HDD<br>  If you really need everything off the HDD you can swipe a magnet over it.

vvK6A4uyaa	The AUX Port is for a Phone thing. And in your details i saw that you tried the print server and it didn't work out. Well, there is only one thing to do. You have to buy a new printer. (A wireless printer) If you are going to get one, then there are 2 options. The 1st option is to get a printer with an ethernet port in the back. (And then you have to hook the other end into the modem) But then you have some problems like the Print Server. Or the 2nd option is a lot easier. The 2nd option is to get a network printer. If you get one of those, then when you set up using the install disc, then that is all you have to do. You set the wireless up with the disc. School and people who has HUGE Houses use the ethernet port. But if you have a 3 story house then it will work out. And what you said in the question, go to file, print, find printer, your printer will show up there. And there is this printer that has an ethernet port in the back AND is a network printer. It is an HP Deskjet. And i found one on Amazon for only $88.00!!! If you order one from HP.com then you will be paying like $300 something. It works great. I'll put the link in the Sources.<br>  Hope I helped!|`|BJxZ9DLOaa	AUX port is not ethernet.<br>  <br>  Does the 2wire from AT&T have 5 ethernet ports like mine?<br>  <br>  The only way is to buy a wireless print server device.  Plug the printer into that and then you can print wireless.

The only way you can get a virus from a site is when you actually click on a button to download or whatever.<br>  <br>  If you get a Virus/Spyware/Malware, depends on how bad they are there are some cases that they will destroy everything in their path and some are just out there to make some cash for someone.<br>  <br>  It would be best to backup your stuff, before attempting to do it though.|`|tBMWPAA6aa	A virus or worm or trojan can certainly lead to a BSOD... and a virus or worm or trojan can certainly infect a computer (that doesn't have adequate security) from a website (rogue activeX scripts) or a profile generator or a DL'd  layout. The question is: did this situation occur that way?<br>  <br>  You can roll back your machine(s) to a time when you're certain no problems existed... even 'experiment' with different times to try to isolate when the problem arose. Use 'System Restore', a system utility located in (WINXP's) Start>Programs>Accessory folder.<br>  <br>  Is it really important to know where it came from?<br>  <br>  At this point, I think it's MORE important to know that your machine(s) are clean and pest-free. Use some of the free robust security apps like AntiVir antivirus and Comodo firewall to prevent this from happening in the future. It seems that McAfee just isn't enough.<br>  <br>  Anyone that has experienced an infected machine commiserates with you. Lemme guess... you use Windows? Me, too...<br>  <br>  We need to travel the Internet in Armored vehicles....|`|U3HJldFJaa	So for the record, viruses dont cause the "blue screen of death", Windows does. <br>  Anytime a critical error or file goes missing, Windows displays that screen (which to anyone who works with computers knows that its time to break out the Windows installation disks).<br>  <br>  Like the guy who posted before me said, you probably didnt get it from myspace. Any of the profile generators out there could have done it, since theyre not as secure and not always legit.<br>  <br>  Your desktop, as with any computer, is probably slowing down because of all the files and programs you have installed on it. Try using Disk Defragmenter to optimize your hard drive. Start --> Programs --> Accessories --> System Tools --> Disk Defragmenter.<br>  <br>  Best of luck!
