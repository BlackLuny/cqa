So some of the government have started to use green electricity its made from air and water.     If you have green electricity option in your city then I strongly suggest to switch to green electricity.    Please watch some really amazing idea.. it will give you some information on saving energy.     http://livegreenideas.blogspot.com/2008/...  http://livegreenideas.blogspot.com/2008/...|`|pnCOR1UVaa	Most of mine comes from my solar panels.

How about God?    Your belief in a thing does not make it so.|`|68a986852f756433d4bb1ec748016462aa	What Jon Sol wants you to believe, to use his example, is that America is responsible for gravity and that because of America's excess gravity, we are endangering the world.  He acknowledges that we don't understand gravity (assuming he is even aware of the limitations in our scientific knowledge regarding gravity) yet fails to acknowledge our lack of understanding what causes climate.  It is important to understand what you don't know.  Alarmists always insist on greater knowledge then they possess.   Note: there is a difference between global warming and human caused warming.  When the question isn't specific, it is much more difficult to answer.     Note" I too am a scientist, a geologist, that understands the history of climate change better than most so obviously I am skeptical of people like Dana that claim to know.|`|AA11130104	The global warming "believers" certainly seem to be taking on the mantle of a religion, with the priestly hierarchy (Gore,et.al.) and with their list of rules and sins.  Mostly the fact that no matter how much data your present them, they "believe".    I believe that global warming happens, as does global cooling.  It's a natural cycle that we cannot alter.  It is not linked to CO2 emissions, but to the earths relationship with the sun.    I would say that there are two things that certainly seem to poke a very large whole in the AGW theory.    1.  Measured satellite data shows the global average temperature stopped increasing in 1998 and in 2002 started to decrease.  Throughout this period CO2 levels have continued to increase (this would seem to break the link between CO2 emissions and global warming).    2.  Mars was warming, and it now cooling, just as we are.  How is it that our SUV's are causing this?|`|2wgEsVmsaa	No, it's not 'belief'. The professor who drilled the ice pack in Antarctica has proven that. There have been a vast number of warmings in the past and we are in one now. This proof is irrefutable. Now, the cause may be somewhat in question, but we are warming and warming very quickly compared with the past.|`|75977462e20038311663eefd8f52cc2daa	i've heard it's been cooling since 1998.  is that really true?   i wonder where we could see such results?    http://igloo.atmos.uiuc.edu/cgi-bin/test...    uh oh,  seems like lots less arctic ice in 2008 than 1998.  maybe it's not cooling.  i wonder how much ice has to melt before people will think it's true?    >    ya know, 'is there irrefutable proof' that if you stand out in the middle of the freeway that you'll get hit?  if not, why don't you try it.  i mean, there really isn't any PROOF.|`|vfubWXFMaa	It is just not going to get as warm as the alarmists are claiming it will and when they finally admit that it is the sun not an insignificant plant food that causes the world to warm and cool the panic will end. The sun is a variable output star and until we learn how to throttle its output we are going to have to continue living with its natural cycle as we always have. The world has gotten about .7c warmer on the average over the last 150 years. Yes it got warmer. During the period from around 1500 to 1650 it warmed up by 3c and cooled back down again in less than 100 years so the warming we have had currently has been slow and mild in comparison. This happened between the Sporer and Maunder minimums for any who want to check it for themselves because it is extremely well documented historically and scientifically. Everything that is happening currently has happened several times before during the 3,000 years of recorded history and most of the time it happened faster than the current optimum has happened.    AGW outright lies.    This warming is unusual and happening to fast and getting to hot.     The seas are going to rise and drown millions because of melting ice.    Polar bears and other arctic and Antarctic animals are going to become extinct.    Aint going to happen because all of these species have been through more extreme warm periods in the last 2,000 years at least twice.    None of these statements has any evidential support and in fact are deliberate lies intended to alarm the less educated for financial and political gains by the persons originating the lies.    http://www.weatherquestions.com/Roy-Spen...    http://www.indiana.edu/~geol105/1425chap...    http://www.aip.org/history/climate/co2.h...    http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundame...    http://www.ac.wwu.edu/~dbunny/research/g...    http://www.bruderheim-rea.ca/warming9.ht...    http://www.warwickhughes.com/icecore/    http://www.co2science.org/subject/l/litt...    http://www.climateaudit.org/    http://tomnelson.blogspot.com/2007/10/mo...    |`|XdtEEDf2aa	THAT global warming is happening is not really in doubt.

It doesn't carry the religious connotations some of the other answers are trying to apply to it. For instance, I believe that 1+1=2. That does not mean that I have faith in it, it means simply that I take that proposition to be true.    Also of note is that science is not a method of providing absolute, irrefutable proof. All scientific findings are tentative and subject to revision if and when new evidence comes to light. Instead, it is a method for forming testable, yet tentative, explanations of the natural world by examining empirical evidence.    All that said, yes, there is a great deal of evidence suggesting that human caused global warming is currently taking place. And because of that evidence I, and a great many other people, believe that global warming is real.|`|650mJugwaa	In the realm of science, which is where we're talking about, there is no irrefutable proof for anything. Even gravity hasn't been irrefutably proved, but I expect you know it's true!    I look at it this way, Warning though, if you are a creationalist then might as well stop reading this now!    A few billion years ago, the world was alot warmer than it was now, with dinos and palms and all sorts of things that liked it warm. Now all the trees and animals soaked up all the carbon which was in the atmosphere, just as trees and you and I are made of carbon now. Now, what didn't exist because evolution hadn't got round to them, were many of the microbes and stuff which rot stuff down. So when the trees fell over and the sea creatures died they didn't rot, they just lay there and over time as silt and more stuff fell on top of them they got compacted and eventually the sea creatures tuned into oil and the trees turn into coal.    Back to the present time and Humans come along and dig up the coal and oil and burn it, releasing that carbon back into the atmospere. If it was warmer when the carbon left the atmoshere, and we put the carbon back into the atmosphere, what's going to happen?      I do understand the science now, but when I was getting to grips with it that was the theory I used. there are similar issues like tundra and deep ocean methane that work on the same principle.      That explaination I believe is basicly sound but tipping points are important and add another dimension, suss GW out first though.|`|4090lGkMaa	Why I believe in it? Mainstream science does...

It fits with my perception of what's going on around me. (I seem to get drenched more often and blown about more).   It fits with my perception that we humans are changing the environment quite noticeably and not always in our own best interests.  And it fits with my confidence in the value of science.  I have had momens of doubt, like when watching "The Great Global Warming Swindle" and I'm sill not convinced 100%.   Which I suppose is self contradictory in a way. But we have to decide one way or the other, don't we? Otherwise we cannot act decisively.  And if we do nothing or do something half-heartedly it .......    Anyway, all the people I've discussed this with who took the opposing view, seemed to me to be trying to find justification for continuing their lives without having to make uncomfortable changes.  Whereas I have made uncomfortable changes (giving up the car, drastically reducing my consumption of animal/fish derived foods, recycling feverishly etc.). And although those changes were initially a little difficult, I think they have had benefits for my sanity* and physical health.  (*Yes, I know what you're thinking.)
AA11553467	Yes!  Two years ago in Austin, Texas, we had a 50-year drought. Then last year we had record rainfall and flooding. This year, we're back to an extreme drought. We really needed rain from Hurricane Ike to refill our water supply in the Colorado River. Unfortunately, we didn't get a drop.|`|75977462e20038311663eefd8f52cc2daa	hard to say.  in the 70s, in calif, we had a drought, and water rationing.  today, we have rationing again.  it's always hard to distinguish sources of climate while they're happening.  it's only hindsight that allows people to do that.    however, up in BC canada, there's clearly a problem.    http://mpb.cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/index_e.html    http://cascadiascorecard.typepad.com/blo...    >    it's hard to see change.  our perception has no means to experience "average temperature."  there clearly has been a change, however.|`|ll3MzvXqaa	i don't know will sorry i wish i knew|`|drkbm5G5aa	no|`|0RSCZ6UAaa	I don't know about where I live, but I do know of an example.  There is a weather front caused by the El Nino event that provides rain over the Mid-western US.  Global warming can cause the El Nino and La Nina events to be thrown off, which causes much more or less rainfall over the mid-west.|`|cZscHVvvaa	It certainly seems that way. Everybody I talk to here in the UK agrees it's been another abysmal summer. Nature watchers have noted fewer insects and poor breeding success rates among insectivorous birds.      Those who have lived the longest are the best people to ask because they have long experience of how the weather was. But fewer of the older generation have computer skills so fewer of their voices are  heard in cyberspace.     People can adapt to almost anything. So if climate change gradually drags most of us back to impoverished living conditions, we'll cope. The young who grow up in such conditions will feel it less than those of us who have known better times.
cZscHVvvaa	Is the Earth really spherical? Or is that just a figment of human perception? Perhaps it is really flat and we just can't get our minds around how that could be so.  So, yes, your rhetorical statement is valid. There is no such thing as absolute proof.  And, what is even more interesting, is the way in which our knowledge keeps expanding. So, for example, we keep finding new forms of life existing under more and more extreme conditions. And the boundaries to infinity keep getting further away!  Now you bring us back to Earth with the observation that Anthropogenic Global Warming has still not been disproved.   I doubt it ever will be disproved. Or proved. It doesn't really matter. There isn't time to find out the truth before the consequences are upon us. Just as America was discovered before most of the inhabitants of the planet had accepted that the "world" was round. (I have no evidence for that, I just thought it up, but it sounds quite probable to me). If what the majority of scientists are saying is true, then it's too late to do anything significant to prevent AGW and mitigation of the worst consequences is the best we can hope for.  As for God, well, you pays your money and takes your chance.|`|wX3P9Tlcaa	 show me a scientific paper proving the existence of god, tell me what agw is and i'll see about refuting it.all "proofs" in science are open to question ,that's the scientific method. if you need proof that scientific method works look around you,all our technology,computers ,medicine,engineering all prove science,notice your laptop lots of science there,if god is so great why didn't he give you a laptop ,but science did.|`|badeb4e509edbe31e00e0cf98a9ad4f3aa	Everytime I drop something, Murphy's Law dictates that it will land in a way I don't want it to.

Physicists can say that Newtonian physics work on a large system, but can't explain it at a particle level, because with our limited knowledge it looks chaotic and the formulas don't work. Along comes quantum physics, but there's a long way to go. Mankind has invented so many mechanical systems to work with Newtonian physics, and  much of it is taken for granted.    Point is, we have a lot to learn about climate science, but we understand how the large system works. |`|wHVx9HZVaa	The one thing that has been proven beyond doubt is that nothing can be!|`|vfubWXFMaa	Well Bestonnet got 2 out of 3 correct, AGW is still a poorly documented hunch striving to become a hypotheses and not getting very far in that direction because all the evidence points the other way when you try and check it out. It will probably never achieve the high honor of becoming a theory because that requires independent conformation through scientific method.|`|nunZMnhWaa	Well there is exactly as much and just as well proven evidence for the existence of god as there is for the hypotheses that Co2 causes global warming and that our current warm period is in some way radically worse than the 3 other that have preceded it in the last 2,000 years.|`|AA11616240	sperm and egg come together to create baby!|`|AA11149728	u wanna show me scientific paper disproving existence of God???? if its scientific, it's always disproving god! evolution is scientific while creation is spiritual!!! duh!|`|AA11932246	"In the field of science, show me one thing that has ever been proved beyond doubt, that is not still open to question by science."  Nothing is ever proven completely beyond doubt but there are some things that are so well supported that in practice they may as well be beyond doubt, things like the existence of gravity, the fact of evolution or the fact that global warming is happening and caused by us.    "While you're at it, you can cite me one peer reviewed paper that conclusively contradicts AGW."  A lot of the ones cited as contradicting it actually turn out to support it, this is very similar to how creationalists will cite articles that support atheistic evolution (and contradict Christian myths) in support of their arguments.    "One last request; Show me a scientific paper disproving the existence of God."  Arguments have been made that some types of god can not exist, either due to being logically contradictory or contradictory to reality.  A deistic god that didn't interact with the universe would be impossible to disprove (but also impossible to prove, and atheism is the default if you have no data either way).    But anyway, we don't believe global warming is happening, or that evolution is the process by which life became more complex just because no one can disprove them (although lack of disproof is a necessary condition it is not sufficient), instead we believe such things because the evidence is that they are likely to be true (or at least good approximations to reality).    When it comes to the question of whether or no there is a god, the atheists automatically win the argument unless the theists can provide some actual proof of their god (which they have not managed to do despite thousands of years of trying).
b588966908833365002dc33e0aacc38aaa	If the US media does derive any power and wealth from climate change denial then I hope that it will find other ways to generate money and influence, post-Bush.  The world is waiting for the new administration to set America on course for environmental leadership, emissions reductions, energy efficiency and a low carbon economy. |`|badeb4e509edbe31e00e0cf98a9ad4f3aa	First off, I'm going to disagree with Dana about the media.  Journalism is supposed to be balanced.  What he's saying, essentially, is that they're doing their job.  Good.  The general social and political climate, however, given 9-11, the Bush Administration, and many other factors, means people have become a skeptical lot.  They want a smoking gun, they want in-your-face evidence.      In the process of deregulation and mergers, our media definitely lost something precious.  They backed off, hid under the rug, abrogated their responsibilities to some extent by being slow to react to a number of issues, AGW climate change included.  If the media 'changed their minds,' as you put it, the public would largely ignore it at this point.  If the about-to-be elected President sets a different tone -- which I believe the public wants, overall -- people might again become more interested in such issues, and more open-minded in examing the facts.  They might be able to accept a powerful theory like AGW without needed the hard evidence that simply can't be provided at this point.  At least, not to the satisfaction of many.    People nowadays rely on a generally poor array of news sources.  After the recent debate, I watched the commentary on PBS before switching over to ABC, NBC, CBS.  I made sure I watched Bill Maher last night -- Garry Shandling was a hoot -- to get their spin.  But fewer people are reading newspapers, more people are getting information from fewer sources or from sources owned by media giants.    The media is powerful, all right, but there's more in play than just that anymore.  I think Americans are in some sort of a free fall in regards to the media and news.  I'm not sure that's a good thing, but we'll have to wait and see.  In the meantime, I'm trying to stay informed, and to do what I can to inform others.|`|20f3291b9320a302e9070bf55325531daa	Well the reality about the media is that they create an anti-AGW bias.  The media wants to be 'fair and balanced' about everything, so whenever they talk about AGW, they have to talk about skeptics, or when they interview a climate scientist they have to interview a 'skeptic'.  So even though they comprise a small percentage of the climate science community, they get a significant percentage of the air time, which creates the false impression that there's significant debate among scientists.    The media is doing us a disservice by creating this false bias in attempting to be unbiased.|`|nunZMnhWaa	Unfortunately you are almost exactly 180 out from the truth.

Even with this system, you can not power air conditioning or heating system. You might be able to air condition if you install a gas/ammonia system.    In the U.S., the average cost of power is about 10 cents per KWH. Your house cannot be only using 100KWH. That would be $10. You must have something wrong. Maybe it is 1000? The average in our area is 1500KWH.    The bottom line is it will take many, many years, if ever, to recover your investment from savings in energy use. If you can afford it then go ahead and help the environment.    |`|AA11562326	100 kwH a month is a typical draw for an off-grid cabin.  A frugal cabin might be 1/3 that amount.    While this amount of energy is readily supplied by solar in off-grid situations, I notice that you already have grid power.  It's likely going to be cheaper to use grid-tied solar, and cheapest just to use the grid.  And batteries are a real hassle to maintain.    But to answer your question, if you live in an area that gets 5 hours of sun a day, you could get by with the 740-watt system in the link below:    http://www.partsonsale.com/cabins2interm...    The price is $5600, and batteries are not included.  This is probably the price, as rebates are generally given to grid-tied systems, not off-grid.  That same bottom-line money buys you about 3x the power if you go grid-tied, due to rebates.    If you wait, panel prices are expected to decline as much as 25% next year.|`|sY7g3ttPaa	Get a solar panel that runs on gas.|`|AA11932246	That would be 100 kWh per month, please get your units right.

I use them both to learn and share ideas that will better nature, among other ideas.    2. I am not currently in control as to what happens with the rain forests, trees and wildlife much beyond my county at this time.      If I were in control of everything, and I were certain that if I gave away my computer and tv, that the rain forests, trees and wildlife would be much better off, then yes I would them away.  But since there are a "few" other people on this green earth of ours, I will use them to continue to learn, grow and inform others

20f3291b9320a302e9070bf55325531daa	We all live in the same universe.  It's just that some of the people here are in a level of such extreme denial that they're willing to ignore and even try to rewrite the laws of physics and chemistry in order to maintain their ridiculous beliefs.    A few times I've said that deniers live in their own fantasyland.  That explains the confusion.    I have to say that the people here who understand the chemistry of ocean acidification (i.e. bob, beren, Dawei) are making those who don't (i.e. Roger, bravo, Jim) look really bad.  Not that this is anything new.|`|9Ivc1Wgaaa	Until you learn chemistry you will never learn just how much that ad agency propaganda has addled your brain. Co2 absorption make water more alkaline raising its pH. When water warms it releases co2 back to the air becoming less alkaline. It is one of the first things you learn in 6th grade chemistry because it is so easy using dry ice to demonstrate the solubility of gases in liquids. what ever agency hack that dreamed up the reference you warmers are quoting from really needs to go back to school and learn the basics before he makes a worse fool of himself than he already has.|`|AA11105711	No matter how much a denier does not like the term acidifying the ocean, when the pH of something goes down it is being acidified.  I have never heard anybody say that the ocean will become a superacid  (which is the actual scientific term for "molecular acid") or anything close to that nature.    Edit: I find it humorous that somebody that claims to be a scientist cannot give a better scientific argument than saying everything that he disagrees with is "propaganda".|`|db77723b96fc01eeed3d85a8a58e79ecaa	I'm floored by the responses from the denialist set. Really guys? Really??    I need to save this question so I can look at it whenever I need a reminder of why I don't take them seriously.|`|x5c7ek7paa	Interesting, roger got 6 thumbs up for a completely wrong answer.|`|bc1a10f4df223596a7823cf0ba6ac3e1aa	Don't worry, the anti-logic denier particles are in a sea of logic particles and cannot avoid annihilation.  All that will be left are two 0.089 eV photons (because even deniers can't avoid conservation of momentum).  The photons will be promptly absorbed by CO2 that will re-radiate the energy back to earth and warm it a bit.  Ironic?|`|68a986852f756433d4bb1ec748016462aa	Bravozulu's comments are obviously beyound Bob's comprehension as well as Benjamins. Bravozulu made perfect sense to me but then again basic (pun not intended) chemistry is required for a geology degree.  What Bravozulu said was that using the term "acid" was a propaganda technique.  It is better as Benjamin suggested to call it less alkaline but the terms are synonomous.  It simply sounds less threatening to call it less alkaline to the average non scientist out there.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH|`|DIBo12zjaa	It's a relative question and a inverse reaction. I got to admit the time lines for equilibrium doesn't look promising. Though sometimes I wonder if the C pools act the way the do. I'm limited on this and have to take their word for it. That is, my computer isn't able to do modeled simulations. My wife on the other hand makes anything possible with imagination.|`|75977462e20038311663eefd8f52cc2daa	Roger is a bit confused.  (to be generous)    CO2 added to the ocean makes  >|`|gcTdkwO5aa	Bravozulu,  It is interesting that you have a degree in chemistry, but do not know what acidification means. It does not necessarily mean the oceans will become acidic. It is the *process* of becoming acidic.    Edit:  Jim,  At first that is what I thought--that bravozulu was simply arguing that the use of the word acidification was a propaganda technique (which is ridiculous in and of itself, seeing as how that is the correct term), but then he left this little gem:    "It isn't even possible that CO2 from humans could 'acidify' the oceans."    Which makes it clear to me that he does not know what the word acidification means. Like I said, the end result of acidification is not necessarily an acidic ocean (which would take immense amounts of CO2). However, because we have seen a drop in ocean pH, the oceans have been acidifying, and it is being caused by manmade CO2.    As for Roger D: What is the point? He clearly has no interest in being objective (or understanding basic chemistry).|`|aWTo9K22aa	At least Jim and Bravo recognize that dissolved CO2 will decrease the pH (of course it will not actually bring it below 7, that's not what 'ocean acidification' refers to.)    Roger D, it is not propaganda, it is indeed very basic chemistry. When CO2 dissolves in water, it binds with a water molecule to create a molecule of H2CO3. Such a molecule is an acid with a pKa of around 6.3, and so it will deprotonate (once) almost 100% at ocean pH of ~8 (alpha 1 is .975, so the exact number would be 97.5%). And what is pH? The measure of how many protons (normally H3O+ molecules) are in water. Therefore, more protons due to the deprotonation of carbonic acid leads to a lower pH.     I don't care if you think ocean acidification is a real issue or not, but please don't doubt basic chemistry. You're making Jim, Bravo and the others who thoughtlessly gave you a thumbs up look bad.
08f47edd63e0224660f6c3d00e0c5830aa	I was working in Antarctica as an Ecologist 4 years ago. The scientists there told me that the main body of the continent was getting colder and the ice thicker, only the peninsular is getting warmer, which is only 7% of the land area.  This has been confirmed by Dr. Wingham, a physicist, head of department of Earth Sciences at University College London, director of polar modelling for the National Environmental Research Council, gave a paper to The Royal Society saying that from the 72% of Antarctica that has been surveyed by the cryostat Satellite , the ice sheet is growing at the rate of 5mm per year +/- 1mm  and at this rate will LOWER seal levels by 0.08mm per year.     In the case of ice bergs, as ice is less dense that liquid water (that's why it floats), when it melts it occupies less volume, so sea levels will not rise|`|5cb5feb035bd6f8ad961e6c52149cc41aa	Ice bergs suggest ice from a glacier falling into water.    Melting ice bergs do indeed raise the water level of the oceans.   Maybe the glacier the ice bergs are coming from is growing from more snow falling on its top though, so then it would be reducing the amount of water in the ocean.    When an ice berg melts, it cools the water near to it, thus making the water shrink, unless the water is around 3'C.   Between 3 and 0 water actually expands.   Otherwise, all the cold water would sink to the bottom of a pond and freeze from the bottom up killing everything.     To get more info on if we will die or not, see the movie "water world".|`|sfC6L8ybaa	Maybe some flooding by 2100?  Maybe should help your children find land in Scotland?|`|H8XpaaPDaa	you won't drown if you move far enough inland. there isn't enough water to cover all the land of the world.    but if you live in the UK, you definitely will be toast....|`|SIWh4UCyaa	The simple answer is NO  The maximum sea level rise possible is around 65m and that is if all the Antarctic and Greenland ice melt and "even worst case" that is not going to happen any time soon. Waterworld is Hollywood fiction.  To correct a couple of comments here  sea ice - is formed when sea water freezes, over winter it thickens in the Arctic this can be up to 2-3m a little more in the Antarctic.  Icebergs - Do indeed break of glaciers and are much thicker 30-40m above the water mean 300-400m below the water "tab" burgs in Antarctica can be 200miles long, you would need a very big glass to drop that in.  And as for this some times repeated test of Archimedes principle, to make it apply to icebergs (not sea ice) you need to fill the glass to the very top before putting the ice cube in, then see what happens.|`|zTj6bnIlaa	No 100% no, In case you haven't heard and that is quite likely due to media propaganda, but the Earth has been officially cooling since1998 and arctic ice is now back at pre 1980's levels which is when records first began being kept.|`|l5WDTE9daa	Basically scientists believe if both the ice caps melt the only place what wont be flooded is the equator line if were lucky. Its like if you put a small piece of snow in your hands and watch it melt you get alot more water and you did have snow/ice.|`|IZIi27HYaa	not unless someone leaves the door open over night!|`|DjHWw3h3aa	doubt it will happen in are life time but if it does ill come to france with you and munch some frogs legs n french fries lol|`|ab5eb6c79489fdbbacde1ce1372f5f98aa	If the ice caps keep melting like they are then many lower lying areas will be flooded.  The entire world will not be flooded because there is simply not enough water.|`|AOrpzha0aa	Mick T is wrong, Nafets is right. A melting ice berg won't change sea levels because when it melts it will take up the same volume (Archimedes' Principle).    What is raising sea levels are melting ice sheets on land (like Greenland and Antarctica) and glaciers. Also, as water warms up it expands. This is called 'thermal expansion'.    Sea level is rising at about 3mm per year. It's expected to speed up a bit, but not enough to drown the UK. Sea levels going up by less than a metre is probable, although 2m is quite possible.    Here's a google maps sea level rise thing for you to play with and see what that means!:  http://flood.firetree.net/        It will probably be a serious and very expensive problem - there are millions of people living in places that would be underwater at 2m sea level rise. And it increases the risks of floods by a lot.|`|gBdZPs4laa	No, Sealevel rise is a slow process, so people won't drown, worst case 2m rise coastal areas will be efffected but not the whole UK!!!|`|e3c1283384b5c60e5cb3b813a68f7168aa	If I was you don't worry to much about it we all be dead and forgot buy the time that happens but the way enjoy the frog legs thay are very nice|`|fJr2KcbSaa	yes,everything is possibble.  aliens will come 2050.The forcaster forcasted that obama would win,that it wud be -16,that the world will end in 000s,now that aliens would come.They arnt bad.|`|05TcBSZbaa	It will take a long time, but it is possible. The ocean waves will start to get larger and larger, but do not worry about it!|`|FmAse7pUaa	No, the answer is Archimedes principle. To observe this on a smaller scale take a glass of water and place an ice cube in it and let it melt. The ice cube is displacing an equal amount of water as its mass so when it melts the water will be at the same level as when it started.|`|ik2AFTAFaa	as it melts due to climate change it also evaporates so the water doesn't increase|`|ORgTnV82aa	Will and Nafets are way off. The large populations that live on plains at low altitudes -- Bangaladesh and New Orleans are great examples -- are certainly at risk from inundation. But this is loss of land, not humans drowning. Controversy over the amount of inundation range from one vertical foot to twenty, mostly at the lower end. But even one foot of water will displace many millions.|`|9dzkbt5yaa	yes|`|eAEp6sRiaa	i dont really think so.its not going to be like that film "The Day AfterTomorrow.it will happen a bit slower than that.its happen now very slowly
ZZ4Nh7yJaa	Not too sure about the fees.  Perhaps a concept based on grass roots would be a better network.  Those who can afford to maintain their currant life styles, despite the economy will.  Those who can not, will make cuts in their life styles.  It is those in between, who are wise enough to know that actual and factual, independence from electric company monopolies, fuel demands and rising costs, plus the economy in the gutter, that you would have the best luck to reach.  I would do it.  I did it for a county agency, cleaning up other people's messes.  And promoting a greener life style to children through their schools, scouts and churches.  Maybe, a straight purchase or a donation could be done instead of a finder's fee. Instead of things that will end up in a land fill, maybe something like the bags they sell at local stores for your groceries, or recycling bags...|`|WewCtMpzaa	It sounds like a pyramid scam (which are illegal) based on green guilt.|`|UZxeBrxQaa	Is the CEO's name Mr. Ponzi???|`|8LBk7vUpaa	Ahhh.  Sounds like an Al Gore multi-level marketing plan.  Can I "Go Diamond?"  Call it Goreway, and earn a six figure income pyramiding lies and ignorance.      Yeah, yeah - - - - that's the ticket.    Stop worrying about the environment and worry about losing freedom and prosperity in America.|`|PM9MQHjRaa	I have been trying for years.  Solar powered house  Water powered car.  Been trying, and still no closer.|`|wHVx9HZVaa	It sounds wonderful in theory but the one problem I have with it is the "make money" part. I am always looking for more that I can do to have less of an effect on the planet but I do not want to make money doing it. I think it is because being green is also an ethical issue. Making a profit out of being green just seems wrong to me. I don't want to be out of pocket and a lot of alternative products do save me money in the long run (long-life light bulbs, solar heating) but to actively seek to make being green a business, becoming a salesman/woman?....No can't do it.  I do think you have a good idea there though and perhaps more entrepreneurial people would be interested.|`|JsffWlnEaa	yup|`|KxlNl3Saaa	I think it would be a great idea if it were illegal. Pyramid schemes always try and take advantage of those people who can't think true the ideas that seem to good to be true. Any organization that claims to be totally free, but requires just a "small monetary purchase" can not be on the up and up. It also reeks of organized religion or a cult.
WewCtMpzaa	Pyramid Scam... These are illegal. AmWay and all kinds of organizations got busted back in the 1980's on schemes like these. The whole idea is to promote the ranks so you get a percentage of the takes, but the whole idea is to get people to buy into "Memberships" or "Brokers" or some special unique rank that has to be paid, and then when you sign people under you, you get a small percentage of what they pay. I think the last one I heard was an insurance scheme like this where you could make a million dollars in seven years after getting enough people under you. The only people who really make the money are the ones at the very top, like the ones who start it.|`|73d140d83d29234efdfa2c38e0168b47aa	Alternative fuel is a joke. With all the alternative fuels added together they will not produce 1 million barrels per day...|`|0509a790fe9f326fe979c75e17a81017aa	Not for me. I just talk to people as the subject comes up on a casual basis; to exchange ideas.|`|85e8902f1245b50510d8e2fcf9b2a7b6aa	That is like a pyramid or ponzi scheme. Illegal.|`|L4L0wSZYaa	I'd like to ask why you wasted your time doing that...|`|AA11500132	there are several networks out there - permaculture, transition towns, LETS, food co-ops etc.    however there is no money in this. those that care and are developing solutions are generally not those with power (money) in the current system.  The solution to the industrial growth society is not though buying into a consumer led greenwash variation  for more positive options for the great turning to a life sustaining culture see http://www.greatturningtimes.org and http://www.joannamacy.net    also look out for the coming film "the age of stupid" http://www.ageofstupid.net/ - they even have tee shirts
EW4zX8lnaa	Because a lot of people, many Americans, are ignorant. You are absolutely correct, but all YOU can do is your own small part, and be careful of the fish YOU eat and water YOU drink. We will just pray that contaminated food and water kill off the ignorant human beings.    wait silver--  so "give me your tired, your poor, your hungry" means nothing to you? they have every right to live and work here--it is EVERYONES earth which i think is the point that this post was trying to make. If EVERYONE does not d their share to save our earth, our race will die out. In the grand scheme, money doesn't matter, nationality and race don't matter, and whatever your neighbor is doing does not matter. It is about what you can do for our planet and race.    No worries--I am an American and I know that--but luckily we are not all ignorant.|`|UDEaesmKaa	Yes it would be nice, but people do not change their habits easily until they start feeling the pinch, usually in their pocketbooks.  So until there are going to be taxes for driving a Tahoe in NYC and gas will be $6 a gallon people will not change.It will however, be a bit too late by then to do anything.|`|NjjzRMBRaa	Based on the answers below, it is very apparent that logic and science are not taught in schools anymore.  To answer your question 1:  of course everyone should demand less pollution of the earth, however, the number one environmental problem today is too many people and is growing at an alarming rate.  With more populations, come more decisions on how to protect the planet from the pollution generated.     As for the rest, ignorant would not be the term I would subscribe to but rather gullible in that many people jumped on the global warming C02 band wagon without good imperical evidence that it even exists.  No, C02 is not a pollutant, nor is it a green house gas to any extent.  It is however a necessary element of the composition of our atmosphere and without it we would not be here.  Most people don't have the means to debate where the debate would do any good on extinguishing this hoax and putting the efforts into more environmentally sound issues, which there are many.      Going green is just a gimmick to draw you in to a mindset, to a lifestyle that the end result is meaningless.  Unless there is a practical solution, a solution does not exist.  Trading a regular vehicle, for example for a green vehicle solves nothing as energy is still needed to build another vehicle.  The use of hydrogen cars, whose emission is water vapor (the greenhouse gas) is impracticle as the energy to manufacture hydrogen far outweighs its benefits.  Electrical cars still need a power source to fuel its batteries and the batteries themselves are environmentally dangerous.  Using CFC lightbulbs is just changing one issue for another, more electricity for more mercury poisoning of the planet.     Nuclear is one answer, however some are upset about where to put the spent nuclear rods and the list goes on and on.  Our technology is not there yet to resolve these issues, however inventing a hoax like AGW is not the answer as it delegates away from the original issue.      Instead of all the waste spent on a natural climate change hoax by the left, money should be spent to fund a Manhattan project, so to speak, to resolve the technical questions of the energy needed in the 21st century.  Al Gore has misled the public in chasing his fantasy where we should be looking at the real issues.      Trading one environmental problem for another is not the answer.  Study the physical sciences and learn the process.  Incorporate Ockham's Razer to find the answer.  This philosophy states that when there are many complex answers to a question, usually the simplest answer is the right answer.  Let's find this simple answer.  It is there waiting to be found.      Stop wasting your time on a natural cycle of the earth warming and cooling.  It is part of Mother Nature and Man should not interfere and remember C02 rises always follow a warming of the earth, Man here or not.  Man's emission of .28% of the entire C02 emissions is negligible when it comes to the scope of this giant biosphere.      Use logic, not hysteria to solve the problems we face.|`|0509a790fe9f326fe979c75e17a81017aa	I believe global warming exists.  I do as much as I can to help.  I recycle everything  that I can.  Give away what I don't need anymore.  I do the light bulb thing, etc.    There are always going to be some people who carry things too far; we can't stop them.  Hopefully, one day they will come to their senses and calm down a bit.|`|ORgTnV82aa	Human creating effects on climate is no longer debatable, only the extent of the consequences and what can be done at what cost.    Having said that, one possible risk is the greenhouse gas reflecting enough solar radiation to bring on an ice age. So it's like being in a runaway car on an ice lake and not knowing whether to hit the brakes or swing around and hit the gas. Or how hard to hit the brakes. Assuming the brakes work. But even if there's only half a chance they work, we'll stomp on them if it means half a chance of avoiding calamity.    But "cleaning up our act" is all relative. It's hard to fault people today for being born into the world in the middle of a population explosion created by an intelligent species learning to feed billions. It's surely an interesting ride, and I tend to favor allowing as many plants and animals continue the journey with us, but laying some holier-than-thou guilt trip on the passengers on the ship headed for the rocks will do nothing to steer the sucker. So clean up your own act and back way off. Americans are more enlightened about environmental matters than most of the world. The Euros got stuck with fuel priced twice and three times higher than the U.S., so they're a little ahead. That doesn't make Euros better, or Chinese worse, we all are born into who we are, and few nations are younger than their populations, so there's no blame. If you're not proposing legit solutions, you're just whining.|`|9dzkbt5yaa	xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx|`|159af8323864a89fbd6da78461d571f4aa	That is giving radical socialists your wallet.  It is beyond stupid and foolish.  Your whole premise is completely backwards.  It is conservatives that clean the environment and liberals that slaughter innocent owls for not living in old growth like their propaganda insists.|`|f0c9b33b60bdc539994e570195e86071aa	I think people really should think differently it's not like if we pollute this one we can another. People are really acting idiotic, all though it doesn't seem like global warming is happening it is. I wish people had a role model like martin luther king and saw what's happening! burning fossil fuels too like that's not hurting the planet the way were buring fossil fuels will cause the next century to have run out of fossil fuels!|`|gz2JF00Saa	Going green often saves you money, but green vehicles are nothing but a piece of plastic.    As far as countries like china/mexico with poor drinking water, I would feel sorry for them, but then I come to my senses, and realise that they take most of our manufacturing jobs, and help put our economy in the whole.    If they want my help, they first have to try to help themselves, and pass more laws to try to clean it up themselves. Something that China appears to not care about, since all they want is our money.|`|4e1nRQCUaa	The difference between opposing pollution and global warming is huge.    no one wants smoggy cities or polluted rivers.  But CO2 levels in cites are not polluting.  And we have done a great job of cleaning up our act.  In the first millenium, wood was used for heat in Europe, and the layer of soot that was caused then can still be seen in glaciers.  It was replaced with far cleaner coal.  Of course, eventually, populations became more crowded and even coal seemed dirty.  But the world was never again as sooty as it was in the wood burning times.    Now we mostly use natural gas, and home heating is no longer a major source of pollution. Factories started growing, and soon they became major sources of pollution, but they slowly got cleaned up.  Ditto for cars.  If you look at Los Angeles, you will see that in the 50s and 60s, you couldn't see down the block.  Int he 70s, "smog alerts" were very common.  In the 80s, they happened maybe ten times a year.  In the 90s, they reduced that.  SO, we are cleaning up our act.  But that isn't enough for those who basically hate the human race and want us all dead.  Those are like tricks, because they didn't want the world to clean up AND folks still be happy.  Pollution controls were intended to be used as a means of punishing people for their insensitivity to everything else in the world. So, what can be done?  Then someone hit on it.  Let's call non-toxic, non-dangerous CO2 a pollutant.  Let's see those dirtbag humans get around that with their stupid pollution controls.  Hah.   And so we have the global warming movement.  Motivated primarily by a hatred of the human race, incapable of looking for solutions, because solutions are not the goal, punishment is.  And as the earth cools, the movement is in serious risk of collapse, because the people haters alone are not enough to drive it.  You need to useful idiots, and even an idiot can see that the world is getting colder.    (People haters are folks who believe stuff like "no offence, but lots of americans ARE ignorant," or "basically, in my opinion, man has been so destructive and selfish, not caring about other species...only concerned about man's own survival."  You know the type.)|`|f64a2a4ada0fcb1ea5303362c0bca8efaa	Yes, you are right.  Clean air is important.  But reducing co2 emissions is a very inefficient way to improve clean air.  Spending that money directly on measures to fight smog will get better results.    I was visiting a friend in Hamburg Germany.  They have a very good public transportation system, high taxes on gas, smaller cars, many bike lanes that people actually use, but still they have  problems with smog.  These are all solutions proposed to fight global warming, but they do not work.|`|60YMS1xkaa	I do think we should be paying more attention to the environment. We are living and using it, are we not? It's our responsibility to take care of it. Sadly, so many people don't care at all.|`|IIpEaDCcaa	noap!|`|6AjqyBTFaa	I agree. I believe in global warming and do all I can to help. But there are always going to be people in the world who don't care, but there are also a lot of people who do :) and hopefully the Earth will recover.|`|gxlEqdclaa	Yes to your initial question.

AA11569882	What Wee Willy Will said, but be careful with this, the jobs are very hard to come by.  I studied a Countryside Managment course but can't get anywhere in the field, nobody in my year has got a job yet!  And one of my friends from a few years above me has got a warden job, but he volunteered full time for four years to get it.    If you are trying to become a warden it's best if you have another qualification - maybe in Environmental Science - as a back up.  Do a lot of volunteer work too, and get to know the rangers because they can help.  You'll probably have to start as a Trainee Ranger for one year on a voluntary basis too.|`|XPbz5dOBaa	17,000 to 25000.    See here
