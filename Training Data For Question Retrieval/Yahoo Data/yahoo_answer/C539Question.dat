20070801203448AAl4roe	Health;Diet & Fitness	What's a good way to loose weight in one month?	Okay, so for about two or three weeks I've been exersizing for about 20 minutes to an hour every day, depending on how much time and how well I feel. I've also been eating better, such as more vegitables and fruits, less sweets -which use to be what I ate around twice every hour- and fats.      I can tell a difference in my stamina, but my belly-fat still hasn't gone away. I do around 60-100 sit ups a day to help with that and I jog up and down hill for about ten minutes around three or four times a week. I also lift 15 pound wights about thirty times with each arm, two different ways.      My friend has been doing the same as me as well, and she's already lost more weight that I have and is getting more muscles than I am.      I want to loose weight in time for school, which is about a month away, so I was wondering if anyone had any ideas.      And I drink a lot of juice. Should I maybe drop that?

20071013181856AAxQYqG	Health;General Health Care;Injuries	Fractured cheek bone?	On Sept 30th, 2007 I fell off of stage (about a 5 ft fall) and fractured my wrist and hit my head really hard (no padding underneath the carpet of auditorium).  I had a pretty bad bruise on my left cheek and it hurt really bad to smile and talk (my left eye wouldn't focus for about a week) and the er didn't take any xrays..  During the night, the bruising got much worse and went from my left eye down to the left side of my jaw and was blue, green, and purple.  Now 2 weeks later, there is still some yellow bruising going down the left side of my face and its still very tender to touch, smile, and talk.  My orthopaedic doc did an orbital xray done to see if anything on my face was fractured from the fall, and said from my symptoms that I would probably need a metal plate in my cheek and was going to refer me to a facial doc and give me the xrays this upcoming Monday.  If I do need a metal plate...has anyone ever had one before and what is it like, etc?

Lo vieron en una eco transvaginal que se hizo al día siguiente a que se le cortó la menstruación. Le dijeron que en ese momento del ciclo el endometrio debería estar mucho más fino (3 mm) y que no debería haber folículos en los ovarios, ya que no está ovulando.    Ella tiene miedo de que sea algo maligno. Es probable? O tal vez sea un desajuste hormonal?   Y otra cosa más:  Tiene metrorragias todos los meses y desde que le pasa esto se volvió hipertensa.

I've never had to be pushed to lose weight, because my too tight jeans have been motivation enough.  I had a baby almost 2 years ago, and I still have the extra weight + more. I work 2 jobs, and I have a toddler running around.  I'm exhausted in the mornings, and I get home too late at night to go for a run.  When I get home so late, I jump in the shower & go to bed.  The 2 nights a week I don't work my part time job, I spend with my son, since I don't get to see him as much as I'd like.  I don't eat healthy, cause I'm always on the road, + fast food is cheaper.  I realize these are all excuses.  I don't have the energy to dedicate myself to working out.   Will someone please provide me with an overall effective work out I can do in the mornings, since it's the only time I have.  I like running, & I have a bowflex; oh, & some words of encouragement will help & please be RUTHLESS-I need tough love!

20080325143307AA3bKFT	Health;Mental Health	What would you do in this situation ?	I have been housebound agoraphobic for 3 years now, and when i look back i feel really guilty for having just wasted the last 3 years of my life.  I will be 21 in about 2 weeks.       My question is, since i know this is going to be a very slow process of getting back into real life again, I've accepted that i might be housebound for at least another 7 months.       I have become incredibly bored in this house, it didn't bother me before. But I've isolated myself in here for 3 years. The boredom is making me very restless. Every time i try something new, like puzzles, something crafty, exercise, reading, tv, movies, i feel overwhelmed with boredom. Almost angry that i feel bored.      The only thing that doesn't bore me is the computer, but i want to stay off the computer, because it's discouraging me from getting out into the real world.      How can i tolerate my boredom for 7 more months, how do i learn patience again, i feel like i'm slowly losing my mind here.

Today my doc had me do the glucose test when I fasted overnight and then in the morning the nurse drew blood and I drank that horrible orange glucose. At my initial visit, I had told her I felt really bad (shaky, faint, sweaty, confused,) about 3 hours after eating so she made it a 3 hour test. For the first hour after drinking it I felt really hyper, the second hour felt normal, then when the third hour I felt horrible. I was shaking worse than normal and thought I was going to faint. I couldn't think straight. She tested my blood and it was 69. She said that is not low but it could be low for me if mine is always running high. She wouldn't tell me anything and said she would call in a couple of days. What does all this mean? I've been looking up diabetes (which everyone in my family has) and I've been looking up hypoglycemia. Which is it? I'm worried, can anyone help? P.S. I've been having the low blood sugar symptoms for like 20 years and it's only gotten worse...and I'm pretty overweight, if that matters. Thank you so much!

I've heard it is not a difficult operation, though sometimes may bleed after or small percent having second intervention. I would like to know though how much bleed should send me to surgery again.      My main question is, does it have any importance, whom operates me ? Are private surgeons recommended rather than NHS ? Does the age of the surgeon matter on how experimented he is ?      I had my consultation today, and the surgeon examined me, and it was very nice man, and very young also, a little past his thirties.      In this country dont hear too often people making recommendations about doctors, though it would increase my trust when I hear people have been operated by same doctor. Plus the surgeon today told me he does not know who will operate in that day, and I would like to be able to choose. I hope I will be able to.      Please let me know your experience!

My right has been feeling sticky for past 2-3 weeks, it feels like my eyelids are sticking to it and when i pull my eyelids off , it makes this clicking sound. ive never had this before, and i thought i caught conjuncivitis, i even asked the nurse and she said i did but i wasnt so sure, my left eye had a bit of this for this week and it went away, i dont have pink eyes. ive tried eye wash, eye drops,  eye medicine which gets rid of infections. I don't know what it is because sometimes its itchy but the annoying thing about it is my eyelids stick to my right eye and when i blink it doesnt feel the same. I checked my eye lashes, any signs of infections and nothing.. I dont know what it is , because its really annoying and it kinda is also blurring my vision a bit.      Visiting the doctor is a waste of money $40NZD because over here they just check and make you go buy the same stuff at the pharmacy.

Eventually I made changes, and my mood got better and better to where I didn't think I needed therapy.  But as a late I fell back into that depression and went to see him again, he told me that the healing process wasn't over and still insisted that I need to make better changes.  I  thought everything was good - I got a job, made my relationship with my GF stronger, and moved myself back into a better living situation ( all of which he said was causing the depression) but now feel back at square one and am wondering if this is clinical or is he right?      This has been going on since August but I've been feeling better each day since then.      No history of depression runs in my family.      I'm 24 and never have been depressed before.         Any thoughts?

My main goal is just to become healthier, reduce my body fat level, and gain some muscle definition in the process. My goal deadline would be in about 1 month and half or 2 months and I would love to know if my plan is on the right track:    1.  I'm planning on gettin  there by following a healthy diet from mondays to saturdays.    2.On sundays i'm planning on giving myself a lilttle break from my diet   3. Workouts for about 30 min - 45 min 3 or 4 days a week   4. No coke, or sugary beverages during this period (I will drink only water, natural juices and occasionally diet coke, and other juices)   5. I'll start college next week so that means lots of walking to add to my workout routine!      I would really love some opinions about this program I plan to follow, is  buff or super skinny; just to get healthier, reduce my body fat  and If i happen to gain some muscle in the process, that would be great too!!!

20090304221351AAYVPrM	Health;Other - Health	ATTN. LAB TECH/DOCTORS: Why would a drug test come back +methamphetamine if she doesn't even use?	A friend of mine recently went to see her P.O. and he popped a random drug test on her, well she didn't have a problem with giving the urine sample But when the test came back.. it was positive for methamphetamine. She called me as soon as her apt. was over and told me what happened, I asked her all the medication she was currently taking and she named off....      1} Clari-tin D - for sinus infection   2} Nubian - for brain tumor      Those are the only 2 medications she had recently taken.      Could the Clari-tin D possibly come back as the methamphetamine?      That's the only thing I could think of why it would came back like that b/c if I'm not mistaken the Nubian would've came back as Opioid. Correct?       What do you think?      Her P.O. told her that if she admitted to using that she wouldn't go to jail, but of course being that she hasn't used she wasn't admitting to it.      So, she didn't admit to it and now they sent it off to the lab for a more effective test or whatever reasoning they have for sending it off is.      He told her that if it came back positive for the methamphetamine that she would be looking at a couple of weeks in jail not counting being kicked out of college..All for a false positive or whatever you call it..      Please some1 help me figure this out she is very very stressed and she has worked so hard to get her life straight and to get into college.      ANY OPINIONS/FACTS ON THE DRUG TESTINGS/SCREENINGS WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED..      THANKS IN ADVANCE TO EVERY1!

My point is, I don't know about all those complicated exercises you hear about.      My stomach is the only area I want to work on. I actually do NOT want to lose weight anywhere else, if you know what I mean (don't want to look too boyish)      I also want to raise my stamina, good health, etc in general.      I am vegetarian, and my diet is pretty good. I get protein from lentils (a lot of dal as my family is Indian), no worries there. It's not a super-structured, amazing diet, I'll eat junk food whenever I feel like it, but my problem isn't food, it is lack of exercise.      I want an exercise that I can figure out, that is simple enough to remember to follow through with every day.       Any help? Thanks!

20090305045545AAZDEu5	Health;Mental Health	The way depressed people think....?	My 16 yr old ex boyfriend and I broke up recently because he is struggling with a bad bout of depression. He felt he was letting me down all the time because he just couldn't even hardly get out of bed everyday and felt so guilty. He is homeschooled and not social at all. He also suffers from bipolar. Anyway as hard as it is to continue to be friends after a breakup I am still here for him. But of course I still love him as a boyfriend in my head. He calls me his best friend but how could he just change his feelings for me from girlfriend to friend? I mean is this normal for someone who is having a hard time to help take the pressure of a relationship off of him but still keep me in his life because he still has strong feelings and wants a relationship but just can't do it all right now? Thanks for helping me. I am very confused.

(not intimate or loving just fooling around and being laid back and all that)       i really want ot be a father when im an adult... i used to like a girl for a year and a bit but now i dont really like her, i find her attractive but not as if i had acrush on her.  im pretty sure they werent a cover up because i really did like them alot!!       heres some other questions i have      im not sure what attraction is anymore... can you explain that?      is it possible for me to like girls all my life and then suddenly turn gay?      should i see a docter so i can help my self get sorted out?      ive started getting depressed what can i do?      is it normal to go through this? do you tink i will turn out to be heterosexual or at least bi?      if i do happen to be gay how can i accept myself?      sorry if its a bit long...

I wanna gain like 5-10lbs more then I can cut down to 165lbs      and I'm not athletic, Im the kind of guy that has to work hard on something to achieve it. Like dunking a basketball... I worked so hard for it!!!!!!

20090305043256AAXDtlX	Health;Other - Health	Are certain antibiotics specific to certain infections?	I have been fighting pneumonia since before the new year. I was diagnosed in the hospital with it on new years eve, stayed in the hospital for 2 days with it and got released. I went to the ER in the middle of February having the same symptoms and got diagnosed again. I got put on the same antibiotic (Z-pack/Zithromax) and got sent home the same day because it wasn't as bad as the first time.      Now, less than a month later, here it is again. I am at the point today where if it doesn't get any better by tonight, I am going to end up back in the ER but I don't want to be put on the same antibiotic and just sent home. Obviously the Z-Pack is not working on me as it should be.      Now my main question is as follows. I do not have medical insurance, I lost it when I lost my job just this past month. I have an old script that was never filled from when I had a UTI (they gave me two rounds but I only needed one) called Bactrim DS and I wanted to know if this antibiotic would help with what I think is Pneumonia again. The medical bills are piling up BADLY and I'm scared to go to the ER again because I really cannot afford it. If this medication may help what I'm going through now, maybe I'll just get it filled and hope for the best?

Then of course there is an issue getting it in and we have to start over.  Then the cycle repeats itself.  Eventually when I do get it in, it is literally a few seconds of wonderful before he's "finished."  I'm just confused.  He is only the 2nd person I've ever been with and I did not have this issue before.  He is on some meds, but he is hard up until it's time to insert.

Is there something the doctors can do for her pain besides medication? any operations D&C or anything? because she is too sick to go to school when she is on them as she is in that much pain. any advice? thank goodness I am going into menopause.

I had a brief chat at a party with one girl who was a "life coach" not long enough to figure it out - but my first impression was that she was brainwashed, she kept repeating something like "you can achieve anything you want if you really want it", and asking really personal questions although you can see she was not really interested, it was something like having a chat with a computer that was running a "constantly happy" program with no other feelings recognition at all.

I came very close to losing my job during a difficult period for the company I work for & although have managed to stay employed, when others haven't, my job security has only improved slightly. I am no closer to getting a pay rise, something which I haven't received in 4-yrs. This is making buying a home virtually impossible as I simple don't earn enough money.      Also, in the past 6-mths I have been through a tough relationship break-down which has been difficult to cope with.      I am finding it difficult to cope & lash out at the person closest to me, even though this person does not deserve the verbal abuse I give them. I am finding it incredibly difficult to keep my emotions & moods stable, the smallest thing makes me explode & this is completely out of character for me. I am wondering if this is an early form of depression & if so, how do I approach the subject with my doctor?

Those who have had their front teeth worked on..I had a cavity behind my 2 front teeth, and 2 others hidden behind them. I had 3 shots of novacaine, and normally a little goes a long way with me and don't mind the needles, or any of that. During the drilling i was fine until they got to the right front tooth, I felt the drill so of course I got another 2 shots. Once again, I felt the pain as he drilled. Just that one tooth and that one area. He was going to give me another shot and I refused and said "why numb my face more when the nerve isn't getting numb, just do it" so he drilled as I grasped on to the arms of the chairs.   That was on Tuesday, I felt great that night but Wednesday I had pressure in my head just above my eyebrows all day long.    This morning it seems to have moved to my right eye brow and eye socket.   I just was wondering if this was normal considering all the novacaine I had in addition to the pain I endured. I had my entire right side worked on a year ago, 4 teeth at one time and had no problem but having my front ones worked on was brutal. I also want to know if THAT is normal for the nerves in front like that to be so stubborn to the novacaine.   Boy was it painful. But I am glad it's over with! Thanks in advance and    I never waste a good response, always pick best answer, not let others do it for me.

I just want to know does wellbutrin help ? Also, is it good for depression?

P.s.....no low assaulting comments please..I am aware of my mistakes and am now trying to fix it. I don't need people bashing me for my honesty and willingness to change bad habits.
