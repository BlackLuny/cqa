xhz1kWroaa	I know I am very inexperienced in this whole area of love (except with family members of course...), but I think it is definitely just as important to give love as it is to receive love.  If we didn't give any love, we would be way less likely to receive love.  <br>  <br>  I think it feels so good to give love because we are making deep connections with people who are close to us.  I think it's a very fulfilling feeling.  I think that you would have to be a pretty cold-hearted person never to have given any love...  I think it's almost impossible NOT to give love to those who we truly care for and have mutual feelings for.  <br>  <br>  I also think it's a greater tragedy to have never given love yourself because you would have missed out on so many great relationships throughout your life.  I really don't think life would be worth living if you didn't give out some love yourself.  I think we'd be pretty empty beings if we didn't do this.  I myself give love all the time to my family and especially to my dad to show just how much I appreciate and cherish them as family members.|`|0rpN2419aa	Yes, it is more important to give than receive, because it might be returned back to you.  However it is difficult for a person to survive, emotionally, and physically without love.  <br>  <br>  Even in gifts to another person, we feel better for doing something for someone.|`|CTM29j3Aaa	Hey LG, good question.<br>  <br>  Actually, I don't think there is any right or wrong answer to this. It depends on the individual and what they would deem as 'important' to themselves. Different things make different people feel happy. <br>  <br>  Some people feel more personal happiness giving love. My mother is like this, and I guess I am too. I personally feel more satisfaction giving love to others, and don't mind if I don't receive as much back. I've never really thought about why being like this brings me personal happiness, I suppose part of it is for selfish reasons.... i.e the more love I give, the more I feel like a good person and therefore better about myself. For the most part though, it is because I know life is very short, and this is my one shot at life, so I just feel it makes life easier and better to be kind/loving towards others instead of spending it hating.<br>  <br>  Other people feel happier receiving love instead of giving it. I don't want to generalize but I would say these type of people are probably quite insecure or afraid of being rejected therefore personal happiness for them comes from being accepted and loved.<br>  <br>  Most people, though, need a balance. People don't want to give too much because they see this as a waste of time and energy if this love is not reciprocated in equal measures; and they don't want to take too much because this will make them feel guilty and like a user. So it makes sense to strike up some kind of balance.<br>  <br>  <br>  Is it a great tragedy to never have given love? Personally I would say yes because I think we can only truly appreciate love when we have offered and given love ourselves.|`|gkqmrIAGaa	I agree with you absolutely but the most important is to love yourself first. This gives you the capablity to help others and people can see the person that you are. The loving caring person you are will in turn find love for personal happiness. You sound like such a kind and truly good person. You will have both in your life and everything good that you deserve|`|PEN3hha7aa	Severly YES!!  GREAT Question!!  In a way, giving love is Practice for Getting love.  You are always better off to be on the "plus side" for giving.  There are too many people that we all know that have a "negative balance", i.e. "Takers/Users".<br>  <br>  Just remember that you can give too much of Anything.  Once you get someone used to your giving all the time believe it or not they get offended once you stop because you are not getting anything back.  Human Nature unfortunately.<br>  <br>  Like my mom said, you need to give (whatever) without any thought of getting back.  Give because YOU want to and it makes YOU feel good.  Make Absolutely Sure that you are not giving to have someone like you.  We all make that mistake and get hurt by it till we realize what's up..<br>  <br>  There is an Unwritten Rule that basically says you will get back three-fold for everything you give.  Just don't make the mistake of keeping a ledger and you will sleep better at night.<br>  <br>  Thanks Mom...|`|6w7FKrlfaa	i think love is a two way street.  it's great to give love, but you have to receive it too.  love isn't one sided.

Try to get back to the Earth and formulate a plan.  After that, breath deeply and concentrate only on breathing.  When the stress had exited, complete your work based on that plan.<br>  <br>  This works for me.

6k5fhFyBaa	I used to have the same problem, when I was going through a move, divorce, job change, and everything was just coming at me all at once. I recently signed up for a gym membership and I go after work and on the weekends to burn that excess energy that I always used to save for anxious thoughts. I make time for myself---a hot bath, a good book, a new CD, light a few candles and just let the stress melt away. It takes a while to get used to giving yourself that precious "you" time, but once you do, you'll feel great that you did. I know it's easier said than done, and seems like such a simple solution, but it really works.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|6PBGAp7Raa	music never fails me. it's something that is so personal that no one or nothing can take it away or turn it into something negative. find a band that you love and just listen to their stuff.

TcW0LHLAaa	hi! well,first of all i want to say that the world is a better place because of people like you, this person you know is very lucky to have you, good for you!!<br>  <br>     i myself was a victim of abuse when i was a child it went on for many years and i had to keep it to myself for ten years of my life because i was being manipulated by my "aggressors" I grew up damaged closed to the world wanting to be able to be happy but i never was.I constantly wanted to end my life because i felt guilty,dirty,helpless,useless,invisible and i dreaded going to sleep because of the nightmares i hated the sound of water i avoided people for years because i was afraid.I got in to destructive relationships and i was beating myself up emotionally every chance i got.I hated my mother for not being there for me and I hated God too.I hated the world and i hated myself so much and suffering and i never thought that i would feel better i was dying inside because anyone who try to help i saw them as my enemies because i was so angry with my self that i couldn't see how they where trying to help me . Until this day i still struggle with this and it's not easy but i've learned many things along the way.i understand now that it wasn't my fault,i understand that i am brave,i understand that i am strong,that this might have happened to me but its over now and its not going to happen again because now i the  have control i may still be afraid but there are always possibilities thou i might scared but that makes me brave because I'm trying.I understand that i have to be gentle with myself not because I'm fragile but because in order to recuperate from this i need time and rest because this process is like when you work out your muscles you work them out then you rest and drink water.Im gonna take my time because i understand that i need it.Im still working on those things everyday and sometimes i get discouraged and i acknowledge that and sometimes i allow myself to feel that way because that to a certain extent is healthy too but at the same i say to myself "okay down time is over lets get back in track you can do it! you are able Im your #1 fan lets go!"Hang in there friend it wont be easy but guess what?!YOU CAN DO IT!! Must of all learn to to love yourself|`|TmYTjJT8aa	it's not hard to believe that she doesn't know how to open up. and becuase of this, and also because of her past, i don't think that even the best counseling can help her get over what has happened to her. it is good that you are being a friend to her, a good one at that. she was able to tell you the hardest thing possible and she can't open up, she is brave and i give her kudos. i think the best counsellor for her for now is you. <br>  <br>  i'm not telling her to forget her past, because that is just denying basically what will make her even stronger. i don't think your friend has found her reasons to live yet, which is also probably why she's giving up on life. your friend needs to wait a bit longer, and she will find something that she knows is worth living for.<br>  <br>  i had suicide thoughts when i was in middle school. they were just thoughts, and nothing more than just skin scratches. i thought i was so miserable, because someone else i loved was in even more pain. when he left i was in so much pain to the point of denial. but, when he left... i didn't have any thought of suicide. him leaving is probably the sole reason i'm here today. there are some thoughts when i look at a pair of scissors or a knife. but, i always ask myself, "why give up now? i wanna see how far i can go"<br>  <br>  after all, there is a quote that goes: only a man who has felt ultimate despair is capable of feeling ultimate bliss<br>  <br>  sorry for the long comment|`|gkqmrIAGaa	Your friend is probably suffering with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and she does need professional help. She needs to see a psychiatrist as there are also many medications that can help her lead a normal life and with the right therapy specificaly for this disorder but a psychiatrist has to make a correct diagnosis before he can begin to treat her. There is a wonderful site that was written by someone just like her and he talks about how he got himself to see that what he was suffering was temporary. Please have her read  <a href="http://www.metanoia.org./suicide" rel="nofollow">http://www.metanoia.org./suicide</a>   And there are phone numbers that are staffed by professionals who can talk to her and help her right now. They can also refer her to help in her area that is free or low cost. One is 1-800-273-talk and 1-800-suicide. She has been seeing the wrong kind of counselors who have not given her the advise and referrals that she needs to get well I can promise you that. There is help for her and the people who love her like you will be destroyed for life. Things always get better. I like to to read these words when I feel depressed.  ALL Shall BE WELL, and ALL Shall BE WELL, ALL MANNER OF THINGS SHALL BE WELL.  Your friend cannot handle this alone and needs better professional help. You should be very proud of yourself for being the kind and good friend that you are. You can help her with these numbers and the site to read.|`|ParFJxnSaa	View section 20, about sexual abuse of minors, and depression treatments are shown in section 2; see page R first, then page V, and adopt the core treatments but, in her case, it is vital that she gets additional treatment. Counselling is insufficient; she needs EMDR therapy (8 stages), which is shown in sections 33 -34, with a locator. Use of the beta blocker, Propranolol is an option, perhaps best kept for later. See www.drugs.com & www.rxlist.com A previous answer follows:  I went through a similar thing to you; it's important to realise that you are probably deeply depressed at present, but even so, you may still remember times when life was good. Well, it can be again, and soon: but you need treatment, which is readily available; all you have to do is reach out for it. See suicidal thoughts, and depression treatments, at <a href="http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris..." rel="nofollow">http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris...</a> in sections 5, and 2 (view page R first). Contact the hotlines provided.<br>  <br>  If the suicidal feelings become overwhelming, take a taxi, or call an ambulance, or use public transport, to take you to the nearest ER, or mental health facility, or call your local emergency number:  911 (USA & Canada), 000 (Australia), 999 (UK & Poland),  111 (New Zealand), 112 (Europe), & 119 (East Asia); see the phone book elsewhere, or Google: "emergency phone numbers". On GSM cellular mobile phone networks worldwide, it is 112; you may need a SIM card, and possibly require credit. <br>  <br>  Don't drive, yourself: you may well be a danger to others on the roads, in your current mental state. Too many people are found, and revived, but have suffered permanent mental damage, and live the rest of their lives in a semi vegetative state: their family, and friends feel guilty, and responsible, for not noticing the signs, and doing something about it. It's a very nasty thing for them to have to go through, too, even though I appreciate that life is certainly no bed of roses for you, at present, so please, get help, right now: seek assistance, or use the hotlines provided. <br>  <br>  It may induce those who cared about you to commit suicide, as well, or at least try, with undesirable consequences. Where suicide is involved, family, and friends often feel guilty, and responsible, for not noticing the signs, and doing something about it when there was still time. See: <a href="http://www.cmha.ca/bins/content_page.asp..." rel="nofollow">http://www.cmha.ca/bins/content_page.asp...</a> cid=3-101-103  Sometimes, if it induces suicide attempts from family members, or friends, it can result in either additional grief, for others, or horrible permanent consequences (see SUICIDE: ANECDOTAL, in section 5, at ezy build).|`|3fd2288554aaf55a30c81ff30a54bba2aa	I have been thru the same thing - I was sexually abused by my grandather starting when I was 4 or 5, and then by my two much older brothers (8 and 9 years older). My oldest brother, I couldn't stop him until I was about 15.  I went on to develop bipolar disorder, and it is severe, and does not respond to medications. So I suffer a great deal. I have made multiple suicide attempts. Sexual abuse increases the risk of suicide many times.  Counseling helped me a lot, and also going to a support group for women who were sexually abused, a group that is moderated by a trained professional. If she has health insurance, she may have access thru a therapist, otherwise, a sexual violence non-profit group may offer support groups (I am very rural, and we have it here, so there should be something where you are).<br>  <br>  I'm 44 now and have recovered quite a lot from the sexual abuse - I used to wet my bed almost every night until I was in my mid 20's, and it magically went away when I got a book at the library that mentioned bedwetting was a symptom. That was freaky - I have only wet the bed maybe 4 times since then, and always when I had to somehow confront the brother who abused me most. Also, when I was at my most depressed, I literally thought I was the antichrist and thought that I should be executed for my sins (which is ridiculous, I am a nice person and always have been). Now when I am depressed, I only hate myself, which is a huge improvement, but obviously I have a long way to go.  I took an antipsychotic drug for a year or two while I got therapy and the antichrist stuff went away.<br>  <br>  Your friend needs to see a psychiatrist in addition to a therapist, because the abuse she suffered was severe, and she will need the medication to support her while she gets the counseling. If she improves a lot with counseling, she may not need the meds anymore, but many of us are really mentally injured by abuse and develop lifelong mental illness.  She could consider going inpatient, but I suggest she go to bazelon.org and fill out a psychiatric advance directive and specify that she cannot handle personal searches if that is an issue for her (it is for me - I won't get pap smears or breast exams or any of that, either). Usually they let you just change into a gown and hand your clothes out of the bathroom to  have them go thru them, but a few places are stricter, and this could cause a total breakdown, if that is an issue for her.  I can't even handle a pat down OVER my clothes. Since I filled out my PAD, the hospitals have been very good about handling the searches. They know that almost half their patients were sexually abused - that is WHY they are so suicidal that they need to go inpatient.<br>  <br>  Perhaps the sexual violence support center in your area knows of therapists who specialize in sexual abuse. All therapists deal with it routinely, but some people may be experts in it, and the support center would know who they are.<br>  <br>  I'm going offline tonight, but if she wants to email me, that is totally fine, I would like to help. I'm really in the same boat that she is, but have been dealing with it longer, perhaps.<br>  <br>  such a good friend you are! Ways you can help: call up the sexual violence center and get referrals, bring a casserole over to share & wash dishes after (hard to do when depressed), distract her by playing cards or board games with her or bring over a non-depressing movie. She should get exercise, it helps, and avoid depressing music.<br>  <br>  PS I thought of this because of something someone else wrote - my sisters were abused too, and I worry that if I suicide, there will be a chain reaction, and they will, too.  Also, if a person is suicidal, some places have a mobile crisis team where someone will come sit with you for an hour or two until the crisis passes. A lot of times, if you can calm down, you can go to bed and feel a little better in the morning. Another option is on bad days, you can stay with her for the night and keep her distracted until the worst passed, and she can control her behavior. Trouble is, when a person is at their most depressed, they think no one loves them, and that the world is better off without them, even if it is totally untrue - it is a warped kind of thinking that depression causes.  Having a cat or dog to hug is a help, so if she has a pet, thats a good thing to do when really, really down. Her pet will need her. Another reason not to suicide.
5cSD8mcZaa	Do not take any medication or use anything without a doctor's supervision. You may make the allergy worse. <br>  <br>  With an allergy this severe, a shot of epinephrine and a steroid shot will help you out the most. Reversal is not automatic, however. It can take up to three to six weeks to recover and seconds to ruin it.<br>  <br>  Always consult your doctor before taking any new medicine.|`|Z1qoQjsZaa	You stated that you were taking medication currently.

One Tylenol PM is not going to be bad for you.  I take 1 or 2 Benadryl when I can't sleep or I know I need to get rest and am anxious about a test the next day.

DONT DO IT SAVE YOURSELF THE PAIN OMGG IM SCARED OF THEM NOW!|`|ttsn24hfaa	you should NOT use a tampon if you havent had your period& you should stay at school if your cramps arent unbearable|`|iB22RWkGaa	It depends. If you're at school and you bleed all over your pants, go home. If not, I would still go home anyway. But thats just me.|`|TUVI7FLlaa	no dont put it and stay in school unless you feel very sick|`|ZrwaXUUzaa	I recommend using pads for the first few periods so you can understand the pattern of your period.  how long you bleed  and how heavy etc, plus that gives you a good idea how often you need to change your pad or tampon (when you start using them)<br>  <br>  yes you can although it might be painful because of the lack of lubrication that you can get from your menses. If you want to practice find a "light" tampon and put a small amount of KY jelly on the outside to help it slide into place easier.  I would not recommend you actually push the tampon (from the applicator) in place because it will hurt as you pull it out (again from the lack of lubrication)<br>  <br>  If you get your period at school it's okay you  can stay. remember to have 2-3 pads on you (even though you haven't started your period)  that way when you start you are prepared.|`|l4MovcnCaa	Well Im 14 and I first got my period at 11 and I didnt even know it, it didnt go threw my clothes THANK GOD!!  But I still use pads :P If your mom tells you your being moody LISTEN TO HER!!! Just take some pads or tampons to school with you and go to the bathroom often just to make sure you havent started yet. And its a good idea to keep a couple of pads or tampons in your locker at ALL times lol. <br>  You really dont have any head achs or back achs for a while. But from my personal experience they get heavier after a while.  <br>  Hope this helps :)|`|NjcH0Ogtaa	yes you can put a tampon in if you are not on your period but it will be very uncompfortable. and also the problem with the school thing stay in school just carry a purse with some tampons or pads in it just in case you need one :)|`|Lny9QMn0aa	don't put a tampon in if you aren't on your period. it will hurt really bad and can be dangerous. & stay at school when you get it. you're gonna have it for like another 50 years so u should learn to live with it (: lol hope this helped|`|8gQ9mqs6aa	no and stay

You could be allergic to the Latex in the condom, or even if your not, the continious friction will leave you feeling irratated or inflammed.

uxjeF2Cjaa	Getting counselling can be extremely helpful, but I realize that you are worried about your parents finding out. You can get free, confidential and anonymous counselling on the Kids Help Phone website, kidshelpphone.ca. (If you lived in Canada you could also call Kids Help Phone toll-free at 1-800-668-6868).  <br>  <br>  Kids Help Phone has trained professional counsellors who are wonderful and can help you with your problems, no matter what they are. Calling Kids Help Phone or getting free counselling from the Kids Help Phone website is anonymous, so nobody would know that you used the service unless you decided to tell them. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps. I highly recommend their services, they are fantastic and helped over 2 million kids and teens in 2007. Why not see if they could help you?|`|9pLdhuBnaa	One way you can get counseling without your parents knowing is to talk to the school counselor.

Cutting yourself can be dangerous, and some counselors may see it as a suicidal tendency, even if it isn't. <br>  <br>  But, either way, whether they call your parents or not, I would recommend talking to somebody, ASAP.|`|Pyu4fQf4aa	there is a confidentiality code so the counselor cannot discuss what is said, but if you use health insurance to cover part of the cost, they will find out because the bill will be sent to them|`|lqG3SQ40aa	The school or maybe a church. The school councilor isn't the only one who can help u at school.|`|3HhrPXEeaa	i know what your going thriugh, i used to do that too.  it's good you realize you need to do something.  if you're under 18, i don't think you can legally get a councelor, but if you know anyone with a parent who's a shrink or whatever then i suggest you go and ask them if they can help you.

gwindStOaa	you sound a lot like me... weird! anyways... I would say that you should love yourself for who you are.... the confused person that you are... that doesn't make sense, but I think you should do some searching within yourself to find out what you truly want to do with your life. I did and i'm still doubting it, but ehh w/e... as long as i love it, I don't care. Just find things that you love.... and maybe it will help you define who you are and then you can truly start loving yourself.
gYG5Nkt6aa	I feel so bad for you Jasmine :( But I never knew you chewed gum a lot...And I wonder why you didn't tell me you had this...oh well...never mind...! <br>  <br>  Well, I went to a few sites, and read more than I already know about it, and it seems it has no real cure, so unless you stop chewing gum a lot, it will only get worse. You have one of the light symptoms, but it can also come with headaches, unability to open your mouth, or ability to only open it to an extent. Stuff like that. So I would be careful, and take it easy on the gum for a while. It can also come with stress, not just chewing gum. <br>  Here are a few sites I thought were good, that talked about it:<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporomandibular_joint_disorder" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporomand...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.tmj.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.tmj.org/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.articlesbase.com/diseases-and-conditions-articles/-tmj-treatment-tmj-symptom-cure-tmj-the-natural-way-59637.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.articlesbase.com/diseases-and...</a><br>  <br>  Sorry I can't help much, I ain't no doctor :P I hope you feel better real real soon!|`|AA10349481	There are two matching temporomandibular joints -- one on each side of your head, located just in front of your ears. The abbreviation "TMJ" literally refers to the joint but is often used to mean any disorders or symptoms of this region.<br>  <br>  Many TMJ-related symptoms are caused by the effects of physical and emotional stress on the structures around the joint. These structures include:<br>  <br>  Cartilage disk at the joint<br>  Muscles of the jaw, face, and neck<br>  Nearby ligaments, blood vessels, and nerves<br>  Teeth<br>  For example, daily stress can lead you to clench and grind your teeth, both during the day and at night while you sleep. Clenching means you tightly clamp your top and bottom teeth together, especially the back teeth. The stressful force of clenching causes pressure on the muscles, tissues, and other structures around your jaw.<br>  <br>  Many people who clench also grind their teeth. Grinding is when you slide your teeth over each other, generally in a sideways, back-and-forth movement. This action may wear down your teeth and can be noisy enough at night to bother sleeping partners.<br>  <br>  Poor posture can also be an important factor in TMJ. For example, holding the head forward while looking at a computer all day strains the muscles of the face and neck.<br>  <br>  Other factors that might make TMJ symptoms worse are stress, poor diet, and lack of sleep.<br>  <br>  All of these stresses can result in "trigger points" -- contracted muscles and pinched nerves in your jaw, head, and neck. Trigger points can refer pain to other areas, causing a headache, earache, or toothache.<br>  <br>  Other possible causes of TMJ-related symptoms include arthritis, fractures, dislocations, and structural problems present since birth.<br>  <br>  <br>   <br>  Symptoms<br>  <br>  Biting or chewing difficulty or discomfort<br>  Clicking sound while chewing or opening the mouth<br>  Dull, aching pain in the face<br>  Earache<br>  Grating sensation while chewing<br>  Headache<br>  Jaw pain or tenderness of the jaw<br>  Reduced ability to open or close the mouth<br>  <br>  TMJ pain and symptoms may need to be checked by more than one medical specialist, such as your primary care provider, a dentist, or an ear, nose, and throat (ENT) doctor, depending on your symptoms. Some dentists specialize in TMJ diagnosis and treatment.<br>  <br>  A thorough examination may involve:<br>  <br>  A dental examination to show if you have poor bite alignment<br>  An MRI of the jaw area<br>  Feeling the joint and connecting muscles for tenderness<br>  Pressing around the head for areas that are sensitive or painful<br>  Sliding the teeth from side to side<br>  Watching, feeling, and listening to the jaw open and shut<br>  X-rays to show abnormalities<br>  In some cases, the results of the physical exam may appear normal.<br>  <br>  <br>   <br>  Treatment<br>  <br>  Simple, gentle therapies are usually recommended first. If those don't work, mouth guards and more aggressive treatments may be considered. Surgery is generally a last resort. Fortunately, there are many steps you can take at home long before that point.<br>  <br>  Try massaging the various muscles that may be involved. Probe all of the muscles of the face, shoulders, and back of the neck. (Avoid the area around the throat.) Press on the muscles to identify extremely painful points. Massage the painful spot with hard, slow, short strokes. Do this several times a day until the muscle is no longer painful when pressed.<br>  <br>  To massage the masseter muscles on each side of your jaw, place your thumb inside your mouth and squeeze the thick muscle in your cheek (toward the back of your mouth) with your fingers. To get at the harder-to-reach jaw muscles inside your mouth, use your index finger to probe for tender areas behind the teeth, and use the finger to massage these spots.<br>  <br>  Other home-care therapies, such as moist heat or cold packs on the face, vitamin supplements, or biofeedback are useful for some people. Exercising several times each week may help you relax, strengthen your body, increase flexibility, and increase your ability to handle pain.<br>  <br>  Read as much as you can, as opinion varies widely on how to treat TMJ disorders. Get several doctor's opinions. The good news is that most people eventually find something that helps.<br>  <br>  MOUTH GUARDS<br>  <br>  Mouth guards, also called splints or appliances, have been used since the 1930's to treat teeth grinding, clenching, and TMJ disorders. Many people have found them to be useful, but the benefits vary widely. The guard may lose its effectiveness over time, or when you stop wearing it. Other people may feel worse pain when they wear one.<br>  <br>  There are different types of splints. Some fit over the top teeth, while others fit over the bottom teeth. They may be designed to keep your jaw in a more relaxed position, prevent clenching, or provide some other function. If one type doesn't work, another may.<br>  <br>  For example, a new type of splint is called the NTI-tss. It fits over just a couple of top, front teeth. The idea is to keep all of your back teeth completely separated, under the theory that most clenching is done by

Have you ever seen a steak with the fat around the muscle?  This is how we look in the inside too.  In order to get this fat to shrink you will need to move. When you take a walk, swim, ride a bike, dance, kick-box, etc. this burns the fat for fuel.  If ever you want to lose some fat the moving is the key.  <br>  Try something for 20 minutes to start 5 days a week, then bump it up to 25 and then 30 and so on.  Also watch your diet!  Cut back on portions, sweets, sodas, cheeses, fast foods etc.  Eat healthy and get more active and you will work it off.|`|eJ4IR5Epaa	I would say a good way to make your thighs toned and smoooth but also rock hard, with out the muscle bulk....Is walking daily for about 40 mins.

ZjhQ6PL8aa	Palpitations happen to all of us so I wouldn't necessarily be concerned about that.  However if you feel that occurring you need to take your pulse cause if your below 50 or pushing 150 you need to visit the local ER so the problem can go away.  Then you need to follow up with a cardiologist immediately if your not hospitalized  Typically the mixture of a rapid heart rate and hypoxia is what's causing you to feel the way you do.    <br>  <br>  Here's a cut and paste on causes of palpitations.  <br>  <br>  Palpitations can be attributed to one of three main causes:<br>  <br>     1. Hyperdynamic circulation (Valvular Incompetence, Thyrotoxicosis, Hypercapnia, Pyrexia, Anemia, Pregnancy)<br>     2. Sympathetic overdrive (Panic disorders, Hypoglycemia, Hypoxia, Levocetirizine antihistamines, Anemia, Heart Failure, Mitral valve prolapse.[2])<br>     3. Arrhythmias (Atrial fibrillation, Supraventricular tachycardia, Ventricular tachycardia, Ventricular fibrillation, Heart block)<br>  <br>  Drugs are only needed if SVT is recurrent.|`|5lZbY4hFaa	It could be SVT. You need to see a Dr. He needs to do an EKG and possibly have you wear a 24 hour holter monitor so he can see what your heart is doing for a 24 hour period. There are medicines called Beta Blockers that can help.

They have to wear special breathing masks at night to sleep.  This will deprive them of REM sleep so they are always tired and look tired also.  They frequently sleep late and take naps.<br>  <br>  Sleep apnea (or sleep apnoea in British English) is a sleep disorder characterized by pauses in breathing during sleep. Each episode, called an apnea (Greek: ?πνοια (ápnoia), from α- (a-), privative, πν?ειν (pnéein), to breathe), lasts long enough so that one or more breaths are missed, and such episodes occur repeatedly throughout sleep. The standard definition of any apneic event includes a minimum 10 second interval between breaths, with either a neurological arousal (a 3-second or greater shift in EEG frequency, measured at C3, C4, O1, or O2), a blood oxygen desaturation of 3-4% or greater, or both arousal and desaturation. Sleep apnea is diagnosed with an overnight sleep test called a polysomnogram, or a "Sleep Study".

Don't worry, it'll all even out & come regular eventually :]|`|xrQQ9Zuyaa	You are very light for your height, have you been losing weight? Are you anorexic? This could stop your periods. Go back to the doctor. This is not a normal pattern, given that you were regular for almost a year and a half. Missing the odd period is normal, but this is not.|`|MxxNjf9Zaa	Maybe you can't have children or maybe you won't get it back until you are sixteen. I wouldn't worry too much if the doctor thinks it will come back.|`|EVeT1UqBaa	luckyy,

84821087cda14dd0bdf6bd3bbda14952aa	Good dentists, and there are very few in America today, will tell you NOT to chew gum because if you have any amalgam fillings in your mouth, it will cause the mercury vapor to leave your teeth at a much faster rate and poison you that much faster.  Go see this video:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://movies.commons.ucalgary.ca/mercury/" rel="nofollow">http://movies.commons.ucalgary.ca/mercur...</a><br>  <br>  This was a study done by the prestigious University of Calgary School of Medicine showing how amalgam fillings can contribute to Alzheimer's disease due to the mercury poisoning from amalgam fillings.  This was a peer reviewed study and verified by the University of Tennessee in the U.S.  The amount of mercury used in this experiment was 100 to 1,000 times less than what you get from each amalgam filling from chewing gum or just eating.  <br>  <br>  Dentists have their hands tied by the American Dental Association and can lose their license to practice dentistry if they tell you to remove your amalgam fillings because they are bad for your health.  This restriction has been placed on dentists to protect them from mass law suits and is NOT about your health.<br>  <br>  Also, gum contains sugar that contributes to bad teeth health.  The artificial sweeteners they put into the gum is also very bad for your health.  The FDA is not our friend.  They approve that junk.  To see a totally independent study that was done, NOT BY THE FDA who chooses to ignore the credible studies showing how that junk damages people, but by a woman that did a 2 year 8 month study of the effects of aspartame (leading sugar substitute) to show her children and friends what that garbage does to animals (and we are an animal).<br>  <br>  Go to:   www.myaspartameexperiment.com        Look at the pictures of what it did to rats.  This is NOT money motivated like the FDA does in favor of manufacturers, not the general public.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|S0iqDSSPaa	Probably because of the sugar. Chew sugarless gum. Especially after you eat if you aren't any place where you could brush.|`|4JnQqHBQaa	Not that you can't, but you shouldn't.<br>  <br>  Sugar can cause cavities.

U5ba4q6Laa	Alright I can help you out here. I am a manager of a weight loss company in Canada and I get this question asked all of the time. Fiest you need to get your mindset around "healthy" weight loss. What you did before was fast but it really messed with your metabolism. When I am doing consultations on people I have to average them @ 2 pounds a week. This is normal this is healthy!! For women that don't have a lot of weight to lose the average goes down because your body has less fat to work with. I average about 1 pound a week and it is normal for your body to stay at the same weight for around 4-5 days. That does not mean that what your doing is pointless though. The results that you will get if you keep with it speak louder then words and I myself have only lost 6 pounds in the last 8 weeks but the appearance and shape of my body is a different story. If you get attached to a number you are setting yourself up to repeat old habits. Keep up with a healthy mindset and lifestyle. Make sure you drink 8-10 glasses of water a day or your body will not lose weight. Also eat 6 mini meals a day, finish your carbs and starches before 2pm, don't drink liquor or anything for one month, and cut out red meats and white breads and products. You can totally do this but be real with yourself. It is not going to happened over night and obviously what you did before did not work for you. Everything points in the direction of not giving up on yourself, realizing you can do this and pushing through the rough patches!!!.|`|B1ZTBkktaa	You're gonna make it!!!!!:)<br>  Don't give up !Those kilos will disappear!No one can beat you!!!Don't let them make you unhappy!!!<br>  You rock!!!;)<br>  Good luck!xxx,<br>                    keit-chan|`|wXxISllZaa	you can do it!|`|0fWqfwoFaa	Well, I'll tell you that I too am at a point of wanting an extra boost to help lose weight, BUT when I was your age, I decided to do it right too.<br>  I calculated 12 weeks, ate right, exercised (mostly weight lifting and cardio maybe 2-3 times a week for 30 minutes), after 3 months I started taking a fat loss enhancer.<br>  The first two weeks of weight loss, I saw NOTHING< NADA< ZILCH! BUT then the weight fell off....I went from 133 lbs and 24%body fat to 130 lbs and 12 % body fat in 12 weeks. I am starting that program again tomorrow and want to add a fat burner to the mix. I do not do caffeine or anything that will cause health problems though. It is hard and takes time, that is why most people fail at doing it right.<br>  Set a calendar for 12 weeks, eat ground turkey breast instead of meat, eat every 2 hours, include protein shakes and protein bars. You will see a difference. ALSO.....stay off the scale. It will mess you up mentally that you are not doing what others are doing.<br>  Every pound of muscle that you put on burns an extra 50 calories and that adds up to a lot,because you become a fat burning machine.<br>  I can't wait to get there again. It has been long enough and I have about 20 pounds to lose. Good luck!!!!|`|RTn7QzNqaa	You sound a lot like me!  I'm 31 now and although I'm not at my ideal weight, I'm a lot more confident now then when I was 22 and starving myself to be thin.  <br>  <br>  I used to get really sick too because I just didn't have enough calories and nutrition and I was working out a lot.  Unfortunately, my body got used to that so now that I'm healthy, it's much harder to loose weight.  Starving yourself will actually make it harder to keep the weight off in the long run.  <br>  <br>  You're doing the right thing by eating right and exercising, but two weeks is not enough time to see the results.  It can be very challenging to be patient and wait to see the results, but it's worth it in the end.  The route you're taking now will help you keep the weight off in the long run as opposed to seeing quick results.  By lifting weights, you're creating a healthier, leaner body and building muscle, which burns more calories.  In the beginning, lifting weights will make it harder to see results on the scale, and in inches.<br>  <br>  It's also very important to remember that the most important thing is that you're healthy, not that you're skinny.  That has been one of the hardest things for me to come to terms with, especially in a society where we praise skinniness.  It's very likely that you are much thinner then you think too.  When I was undereating, I was underweight and still thought I was "fat".  Now I look at those pictures and wonder what I was thinking!|`|W3OGM1B7aa	well i have heard that acai burn works really well they have a web site that you can go to and get info about it.  they also have a cleansing system that you take with the acai burn actually a girl from my area started a web site about it telling how she lost the weight taking it. um what i do is i take the adepex diet pill it gives my energy and curves my appetite and some walking will help to but the pill gives u energy to make u want to walk i have lost 12 pounds in 1 month i weighed 173 and now im down to 161 i was scared to take it because i didn't want to have the shakes all the time but they dont make me shake. u need to eat right with them though because once u lose the amount u want to u come off of them that way eating right will keep the weight off even without taking the pill well that's what i did also i weighed 135 when i got married 18 years ago i have a 13 year old and never lost 12 lbs that fast that is what im wanting to get back down to but the doctor said i can only lose 25 because i am 5ft 8 and 150 is what im suppose to weigh. i hope this kind of helps you  ive tried many different things and finally i decided to do this|`|sEzhJjXbaa	If you lose weight the healthy way, then after you finish losing the desired amount of weight, you will look TONS better than if you lose weight in an unhealthy way.<br>  <br>  If you starve yourself and work out too hard then you'll end up looking kind of gross and unhealthy.  You're body needs the energy from food to help you do strenuous activity, so if you work out too hard while not eating, then that's very bad...  And purging will just make you teeth nasty and create digestive problems.<br>  <br>  Good luck!  Its okay if the weight doesn't all fall off in the first two weeks, give it some time.<br>  <br>  : -)|`|tBHL0S2oaa	You probably aren't eating enough if you are only losing 1.5 lbs on your first week.  Everyone knows how important it is to fuel your body, I'm sure you do too.  So give it fuel.  LOTS of protein will help you you can do this the healthy way just keep fighting and never give up.  which sounds like what you are doing by asking for help. Good luck|`|36uns5nRaa	Sounds to me like you are doing things exactly right. You're not supposed to lose more than 2 lbs. a week because it is unhealthy anyway, and probably won't stay off as easily. Don't focus so much on weight however, focus on being healthy. Living a long happy life is more important than trying to look like Nicole Ritchie. Our society is sick, how we want people to look like emaciated concentration camp victims and starve themselves to death.<br>  <br>  And I'll let you in on a little secret: It is easier to maintain your weight the less you worry about food. Drink lots of water, no juice or sugary sodas. I am not a shapely person, and really would like more curves, but I have come to terms with myself and have accepted myself for who I am. I know that throughout my life I will always be happy with my apperance, no matter what I look like, because of this.

G0CBJux9aa	yes it is especally before meals|`|lN7vbLTCaa	It is a good way to help your endurance and tone your lower body.<br>  I believe jogging is a much better way to lose weight because it makes you sweat and use up your stored energy which is what makes you lose fat|`|TuOp3hNPaa	no walking does nuthing.  u have to run.  really get the heart pumping an breathing real heavy. this is how ull loose weight|`|0eOfphnRaa	Oh yes, definitely!<br>  <br>  Fast walking is high intensity exercise. High intensity exercise burns off more calories than a low intensity one, in the same, say 30-minute exercise session.<br>  <br>  Here's a guide on the calories you burn walking at different pace: <a href="http://www.perfect-body-toning.com/calories-burned-walking.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.perfect-body-toning.com/calor...</a>|`|73eSrvWtaa	any form of exercise is "good" but fast walking won't cut it unless you are doing very long distances.  Why not try some jogging or running.  What do people have about exerting a little more energy?|`|FaVYRoXqaa	It's a good start if you're normally sedentary.  Eventually, you'll need to increase your level of activity to continue losing weight.|`|A6fWHZmqaa	Yes. A test shows that walking 2000 steps a day is an excellent excercise for weight control. (Buy an automatic step counter to wear at your waste if you don't want to count 2000 steps)

OPhZ6Bhwaa	you probably be able to grow to be 6'1- 6'3, i have friends that are like this that grow way taller than their parents and they say they got it from of their past relatives like their great grandfather|`|ec76af399c519dad926a10430304f541aa	if your uncle is that tall, then the genetics for height runs in your family's genetic structure.  You could easily become as tall as he is.|`|I2Tw4zOAaa	You've already gone through your growth spurt and will probably grow for a few more years at a very slow rate.  Oddly I have the exact situation you do.  I'm 18 and 6' exactly.  My dad is 5' 9" and my mom is somewhere near 5' 3".  I don't understand where I get my height from either.  I have no idea how tall you will be when you finish growing, but I haven't grown a great deal for about 2 years.
01bd66fcd1adbf6b22cf0169df571d8aaa	Actually you will tone up twice as fast if you alternate legs and arms every other day so that the muscle cells have some time to replace themselves. You see the pain you get in your muscles after strenuous exercise are your muscle cells 'bursting' since they cannot get larger and larger muscle cells grow in their place... So do legs M, W, F, Sun, and do arms the other days or which ever way you want. Also an hour of cardio is a LOT if you're just starting to exercise again. I started at 20 minutes a day for 2 weeks, then up to 30 for 2 weeks, and now I am at 40.<br>  <br>  This is important especially if you are not currently in shape, you want to train your body, not kill it =)<br>  <br>  Most importantly is that you are eating healthy foods and not over-eating. You only lose weight if you consume more calories than you eat, which is why building muscle is helpful, since muscle cells require much more energy and burn more calories than fat cells. Even your age can effect how quickly calories are burned, <br>  <br>  Hope this helps, and good luck!!|`|BWxSSADaaa	I think it looks fine in general, as someone else said, if you watch what you eat it should work.  I also think you don't need to do sit-ups; everything I've heard says that crunches more effectively target your muscles.  I would replace them with push-ups, which are almost a full body exercise when done correctly.  They'll work out your chest, shoulders, arms, back and abs.|`|7pkxOc6Raa	Not at all.<br>  <br>  How about, instead of trying to make a routine, which you clearly have no knowledge of, you get one that is already tried and tested..like Starting Strength.|`|ckriDuxJaa	Short answer: yes.  If you carry through with this workout while eating an acceptable number of calories for your body, you will lose weight and tone up.  If you have any desire to put on more muscle, you might want to change this program when you have reached your desired weight.

It might work for a few days but you will be grossed out by the baby food and you will be craving solid food. If you are serious about loosing excess fat try cutting out soda and junk food.|`|ZcAvP92jaa	try toddler food not baby food, better taste and more nutrition . when i was dieting i used to eat my toddler's jar food. it worked wonders|`|EEqEXDeUaa	Baby food's got a ton of sugar and salt in it... that's why it tastes so good.|`|e3ba75da5a498241d1dba39e7524b495aa	If you really want to get serious, you have to stop searching for a gimmick or quick fix.  Eat correctly and exercise.  I recommend you read a book like Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle by Tom Venuto or Body for Life by Bill Phillips.  These will teach you the principles of how to eat correctly and exercise so you can get fit.  Good luck!|`|ef3e8a055f877ac48bf7cb67749b1830aa	I had a friend that used to do this.  Not only will you be a laughingstock b/c it looks disgusting but....I don't really know how to say this delicately.  Have you ever changed a baby's diaper?  It's soft and doesn't look anything like when an adult goes to the bathroom.  Well...it's b/c of the pureed food.<br>  <br>  There is nothing wrong with it.  And honestly if you just ate carrots and peas and all those nutritious food you wouldn't have a weight issue either.  Just start eatting those foods in solid form.<br>  <br>  Losing fat is a very simple process.  No acai berries, tea, or diet pills required.  You need to burn more calories than you take it.  Cut back on red meat.  Eat more veggies.  Go look up what a portion of meat is.  You cannot eat too many carrots, celery, broccoli, tomatoes...these type of things you can never get enough of.<br>  <br>  Completely stop drinking soda and completely stop eating junk food.  No cookies, no chips.  Eat lots of fruits.<br>  <br>  Never skip a meal.  Most people do.  To be successful on a diet you need to be eating 5-6 times a day just smaller meals.  And I realize you are only 18, but I remember 18.  Cut out the alcohol.  Alcoholic drinks are empty calories and many of them are more calories than a Big Mac combo meal.<br>  <br>  You lose weight by burning more calories than you take it.  You do this by cutting the calories you eat and by burning more calories.|`|OuTlT8f6aa	The baby food diet is not very healthy or good for you.<br>  For a high protein diet you need to increase white meat intake and have more eggs.<br>  To build muscles you have to exercise or else the food while be stored as fat.
xCCyGtv2aa	It sounds like you are clearly depressed.  I even hear you saying things that indicate you have already started planning your suicide.  Please know that I do understand how that feels, and that I have been there and come through it.<br>  <br>  Depression is numbing and overwhelming.  But it does not last forever.  Please seek help right away, either from your guidance counselor or from some other mental health professional.  The National Suicide Prevention Hotline can help you 24/7.  Just call 1-800-SUICIDE and someone will talk you through the steps to getting more thorough help.<br>  <br>  I am concerned that you are worrying about how your parents will react to the news that you are depressed.  Most parents would gladly do anything they could to help their suffering child.  I know I would pay any price to help my kids if they were suffering the way you are.  You are not a waste of time or resources.  Depression is an illness, and is nothing to be embarassed or ashamed of.<br>  <br>  I don't know your parents, but if they are otherwise regular people, they will want to help you.  I will not say your doubts are unfounded, though, without knowing your situation.   If you suspect that your parents will not be supportive of you, or that they will really blame you or berate you for reporting your disorder, please share these concerns with your mental heath professional.  I am only saying this because I understand that not all parents are healthy people.  In fact, some people--like me--develop depression because of intense emotional stress at home.  Any trained therapist will be able to recognize and evaluate your situation, so if you are afraid your parents will react badly, please talk to your therapist about it.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, if you are only concerned about causing trouble and expense for your parents, seek help.  It will be far less for them to worry about than mourning the loss of their child.  Therapy is cheaper than a funeral, dear, and when it's over they'll still have their little girl.  <br>  <br>  Depression does not last forever.  I have survived!  You can, too.|`|QqY8YgGDaa	learn many hobbies<br>  -If you start drawing cartoons and send to local newspapers you will ain confidence &you will change<br>  -You can   write e mail messages to me through this section by clicking my profile|`|NlMm6JOTaa	Hm..

But please don't stop reading.<br>  <br>  DO NOT be ashamed of your thoughts.  You have a medical disease that deserves treatment.  For some reason, there is a stigma associated with this, and it is stupid.  Most depression/suicidal thought is caused by an imbalance of neurotransmitters in the brain.  You cannot change this by thinking a different way.  You need medicine and maybe therapy.  You are absolutely right to think that you need help.  Better yet, you deserve it.  You don't deserve to be haunted by these intrusive thoughts.  Talk with your parents - they love you, and would feel forever guilty if you died.  <br>  <br>  Please, talk with your counselor, or your parents, or both.  There are medications and other treatments that will help<br>  <br>  Best of luck.|`|WEM5n41Oaa	If you try to kill yourself or tell people that you have a plan to kill yourself they will lock you up in a mental hospital.  If you've just been thinking about suicide then they won't.  Why wouldn't you want your parents to know?  I've been suicidal and my parents knew because I told them.  It's a problem that you have.  It would take some weight off your shoulders if you let them know.  Anyway, ask your counselor if he can keep it between the two of you before you tell him.  Usually it's confidential.  If you've done something illegal or if you have a plan to kill yourself than it is their job to rat you out.  Good luck.|`|YbI6PKw3aa	Well you should talk to your counsellor. You could start off by asking him straight out whether the discussion is totally confidential or not, and if not what are the limits. (For example he may be required to tell the police if someone has committed a serious crime or whatever.) So when you've found out, then you can tell him your difficulties if you feel comfortable about it.<br>  <br>  Suicide is "bad" under most circumstances, because it is a needless waste and usually causes pain to others. (There may be some exceptions, for example if a person is facing the prospect of being tortured to reveal secrets which would betray their country.) But unless the circumstances are as extreme as that, I don't think it is justified.|`|gfpUqWSYaa	i think they need to take action to prevent you from hurting yourself or anyone else.  i suggest this, talk to him but don't tell him ur suicidal, instead tell him u have depressing thoughts that u cannot stop.  u don't really to go to a counselor, to be honest though.  u just need to learn why u can't stop ur thougths.  i suggest u read spiritual teacher eckhart tolle.  he will show u why u have compulsive thinking and the only true way to be free of it.  u can also see him on youtube right now for free if you wanted.  hope this helps.|`|Z0cYxDc0aa	um..................wow ...............................idk just dont kill urself...............................go emo if u want to .........................or help ur perents out if there stressed|`|mNTo30zwaa	hmmm my friend had the same problem as well and all i can say is this: <br>  find what you love and hold on to it. don't think about suicide cuz what would happen if you do commit suicide your parents would only blame themselves more than you just talking about it. imagine if you were a parent and you see your kid dead in front of you what would u do? you'd scream and blame yourself and cry hard now wouldn't u? so stop thinking about it and see the light and find the thing you love and hold on to it and do what you love and you'll never have to think like i'm gonna die now. so just relax and end the thoughts and you'll live happily ever after.|`|qL2o3F05aa	ok...slow down...<br>  <br>  Depression...I know exactly what you're going through. It sometimes feels like you're standing in the middle of the street screaming for someone to help you and to notice what's going on with you but everyone just walks on by. You want to tell some one but you don't want to hurt anyone at the same time. You want someone to know that you need help but you're scared.<br>  <br>  Ok...well...I think the first step you need to take, is to talk to your counselor. You could tell him that you just want to keep everything you say to him between you guys because you're not ready to tell you parents, you need more time. <br>  <br>  Suicide is very serious. My uncle committed suicide and it crushed me. You may think the suicide is the easy way out, but it's not. I used to think about suicide to and I actually started cutting myself, but I got help from a theorpist who helped me address my problems. Suicide may seem a good way to escape, but you have people who love you dearly, and it would just crush them completely if you just up and killed yourself.<br>  <br>  I think maybe you need to find something the helps you and you enjoy. For me, I like to draw and play guitar. Art is a great way to release you emotions. Or maybe a sport or something.<br>  <br>  It's up to you to tell your boyfriend. If I were a dude and my girlfriend was thinking about committing suicide, I would want her to tell me because I would want to help her the best I could. But some people are different so he might react differently. Just please talk to someone. Hop this helped, good luck, and god bless! xoxo<br>  <br>  my email if you would like to tlak is shailjah@yahoo.com
Q2UDhYgkaa	Huge difference - you look twice as good in the second picture and you look younger too. Being healthy makes you look younger.|`|U8oR3VU6aa	I see a big difference congratulations on it.

wwRbkCMraa	if you lose fat, you will lose some muscle... just the way it goes.  Usually losing weight is simple numbers. You need to know your basic metabolic rate (BMR). Once you know your BMR then you can design a diet lower in calories than your BMR.<br>  <br>  But.... it is not always that simple. You could also have metabolic anomalies or even hormone irregularities that can make losing weight virtually impossible. <br>  <br>  Start with the simple stuff. Calculate your BMR right here <a href="http://www.bmi-calculator.net/bmr-calculator/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bmi-calculator.net/bmr-calcul...</a>  then alter your diet if necessary.<br>  <br>  Now, if you don't see results after that you may look into the hormonal or metabolic areas. Also make sure you are being realistic, and that you do have weight to use. Don't forget... celebrities use tons of drugs and have personal trainers! We should all be so lucky 8)<br>  <br>  I have been doing the crossfit workouts and they have shredded my body big time (removed my body fat). They are pretty tough, but the results are quick!<br>  <br>  give them a try and see what you think.

lU8e0VQFaa	Going in is always better, that way they have a name and a face. But the economy sucks, I recently called about a job in a small neighborhood only to hear that they already had over 100 applications with qualified people (that doesn't even take into account how many unqualified people had applied). Right now, you need to do everything you can to make sure they remember you, so that you're just not another name on yet another resume.|`|UP194Rlaaa	Do you really want to work for a place that doesn't respond back? Look for another job that has a considerate employer.|`|TXCDvf49aa	Yeah, I'd go in and explain that they missed you when they called back, but you'd still like an interview.<br>  <br>  Good luck, btw.

If you space your meals and snacks properly this will keep your metabolism active. Snacking can also help you feel less hungry during your meals. Instead of packing on your daily calories by overeating in one meal, spreading out the same amount of calories throughout the day can actually help you lose some weight, by not requiring your body to digest huge amounts at one time.<br>  <br>  Do feel hungry the most at night? The problem could be that your skipping breakfast. It's the meal most people cut out if they are to miss one. Having a good breakfast can set the tone for the rest of the day. Having light, healthy snacks in between meals can keep you from overindulging during meals.<br>  <br>  Also make sure that you are properly hydrated. Sometimes we feel hungry when we're actually dehydrated. Drink plenty of water, and this will also give you a feeling of fullness.

Crunch, crunch, crunch, and I don't mean the veggies! Also dance, especially stuff like belly dancing and do leg lifts where you lie on the floor and raise your legs slowly up and slowly down, but remember to breathe. Do side to side toe touches and lunges.

Additional to that add one serving of fresh fruit (oranges, grapes, a banana etc.) and a glass of skim milk. <br>  <br>  In between breakfast and lunch have a healthy snack, which could contain options such as a banana, grapes, carrots, almonds (roughly 20) etc.<br>  <br>  At lunchtime having something like a serving of fruit, water, and lean meat on wheat bread is always a good meal.<br>  <br>  In between lunch and dinner have another snack, which could contain any of the following listed above.<br>  <br>  At dinnertime have poultry, chicken breast possibly (very healthy, not a lot of anything in it except protein), maybe some eggs (two at the most) you can sprinkle a dash of cheese on them if you desire. You can also look up "Healthy recipes" on Google. Fettuccine Alfredo with spinach on top is very healthy & delicious!<br>  <br>  <br>  Okay, and also workout! Remember: Ab machines do not give you visible sexy abs,  you need to lose weight because everyone has a 6 pack but not yet visible. So do a lot of cardio / weight training type stuff. But I am not going to get into that now. <br>  <br>  Hope that helped! (:
DIRbVD5uaa	I dont think your susposta feel anything.  You can lose weight with it but I dont think your organs are susposta feel anything.<br>  Happy Dieting|`|FI9mYCQ1aa	You have made a good choice by looking into Acai. <br>  <br>  Acai berries have far more antioxidants than any other fruit. Even more than blueberries! Besides that, the nutrients in acai berry supplements help many other diseases and maladies, from diabetes to arthritis to blood clotting. It really is a worthwhile supplement to add to your daily nutrition.<br>  <br>  Acai has great anti-aging benefits, will cleanse and detoxify you, and has destroyed cancer cells in recent studies. You really can't go wrong by adding an acai supplement to your daily vitamin regimen. So far it's working for me by helping my digestion, curbing my appetite, and by giving me more energy each day... I don't even get sleepy around 3pm anymore.<br>  <br>  Acai berries are a great weight loss aid. The berry’s natural concoction of essential fatty acids, fiber, phytosterols and amino acids work together to help your body burn fat more efficiently, process food more quickly and shed the unwanted pounds that you’d like to lose.<br>  <br>  The fatty acids and amino acids aid in both muscle development and proper digestion, both of which are essential to fat loss. The fiber helps your body to move food out of your system quicker and also to help you feel full, as do fatty acids. Phytosterols help fortify your digestive tract, moving waste materials out and absorbing nutrients more efficiently.<br>  <br>  Let me tell you what I recommend, and then I'll tell you why...<br>  <br>  I recommend you get a free trial of Acai Power from <a href="http://barbiefood.com/acai-free-trial.html" rel="nofollow">http://barbiefood.com/acai-free-trial.ht...</a> <br>  This is the product I use, and honestly I feel better every day. If you don't like it, just don't reorder it... but you'll like it. =)<br>  <br>  I attempted this past weekend to find a good acai supplement at GNC, Vitamin World, Hannafords, and Shaws, but I was unable to find something that was cheap, high quality, and not filled with sugar and other fillers. I am going to keep getting Acai Power for now.|`|TXCDvf49aa	The internal organs have very little sensation, so you probably won't feel much difference, assuming they work at all.

Congrats! =]|`|DlzPmx9Maa	Urine color is determined by the ratio of water to other chemicals. If it's clear, that means it's mostly water, but there can be two causes: more water, or less chemicals. If you drink a whole bunch of water, it's likely that it's the former reason. If you haven't drank a lot of water, there could potentially be something wrong with how your body is processing things (for example, your kidneys could not be absorbing toxins from your blood stream, which eventually make their way into your urine). <br>  <br>  If you drank a lot of water before having clear urine, you probably don't have anything to worry about.

v9iUPLxfaa	I've dealt with this also as I have been diagnosed with depression. I felt the same way...always wanting to sleep and had no energy. I hated the day time and when it was sunny/nice out. I felt this way bc I was so sad and felt that on days like that, people were in good moods. I wanted everyone to be miserable with me!!! But after taking medication for a year or two, I finally got better. I still get depressed here and there but I've learned to find ways to cope with it! What is going on in your life that you are feeling depressed????  And weight gain is totally normal. #1 bc you sleep all day and eat and #2 , depression medication tends to make people gain weight, I was on Effexor and went from 118 to 140. Thankfully, once I got off the medicine I wasable to lose it. It was VERY hard getting that weight off though. I take Lexapro now and I think it works great. No weight gain either. Hang in there.....|`|TmYTjJT8aa	I'm not really diagnosed with depression, but I know how you feel. <br>  <br>  I hate mornings, too. But as the day goes on, I start liking it. Especially at midnight. You're just turning into a night owl now. I used to be a morning person about 3 years ago and started hating them last year.<br>  <br>  In your case, I think you being diagnosed for depression made you even more depressed, so you started eating junk food & sweets to... I guess.. "console yourself". The symptoms of side effects is loss of interest in everything you liked.|`|erOKvXjHaa	you sound like you have situational depressional..   you must exercise hard for one hour around 2 o'clcok  in the afternoon. this will fix you.|`|qVdvwWUbaa	That's not unusual with depression.

Don't worry, it will change as you progress.|`|q8ZEWy7Xaa	maybe u have mono thats the way i felt|`|YTKFVzJmaa	i was diagnosed with depression also, but i've always hated mornings. i'd stay up until the sun rose when i wouldn't have school- and when id id i'd lay in bed for hours and hours with my eyes closed. only an appetite for sweets and such, like, you say. <br>  <br>  i went to the doctor and got on paxil, i'm not too sure if that even helped- because now i just got tired of taking it and am better during than a while ago. <br>  <br>  If you're not on any medication, i suggest looking into some. Paxil has a small amount of medicine to help you sleep in it, that's why i was prescribed it. <br>  <br>  good luck, i wish you the best.

vEGkSHMsaa	Depends on your bodyfat %. Most of the time, you will see the ones at the top (near the chest) first. Due to fat being stored more toward the lower part of your stomach. And the last part (once you finally lose the fat around the lower portion) is lower part of the ab muscles.
xCCyGtv2aa	This would be a good question to ask a mental health professional.  <br>  <br>  That said, lots of things can trigger the recollection of a repressed memory, particularly developmental transitions.  For example, sometimes childhood sexual abuse is remembered when a person has children of her own.  I cannot say why this has happened to you because I am not a professional.  But I do know that repressed memories are not uncommon.  I would imagine that something else has happened recently to you--maybe even something positive--that might have triggered this memory for you.|`|VHrZumEIaa	I believe that sometime childhood trauma rears it's ugly head. Talk with a therapist.|`|NlMm6JOTaa	I went through the same thing. <br>  Didn't remember anything until 11 years later. <br>  And was with the person every other weekend.<br>  It can happen anytime.

If not the school counselor.|`|TmYTjJT8aa	well if that really dramatic event was probably horrific, your body and mind probably shunned that memory for a long time.<br>  <br>  this is kinda sarcastic, but serious, too (my next comment). do you realize things kinda slow? don't worry, i do too. it takes a while to realize the disguised things and even longer to realize the obvious.

(bumps) the best advice is to use a lufa/buff puff in the shower with an all natural oil it helps smooth it -<br>  Small healthy doses of the sun.<br>  <br>  If it's new or a sudden rash be sure to keep an eye on it and check with an MD - if it doesn't heal.
m6ULiee5aa	I would actually up the amount of food you are eating, that does not seem like a healthy amount of food to adequetly nourish your body. <br>  <br>  What are you drinking? That also needs to be accounted for. I would advise against sodas and other sweetened drinks in excess.<br>  <br>  The foods you are eating are good though - and it takes getting used to when you are trying to form new habits. <br>  <br>  caloriecount.about.com is an excellent resource for nutrition advice.|`|9020ab145d7888256ef46dd3c6e78fdaaa	Very healthy!! I would eat more for lunch, though. You could try the K Smart Start or whatever it's called for breakfast. It tastes way better than that Kashi stuff. You could also eat yogurt with granola. It's very good and you can choose whatever yogurt you want. I'd buy the weight watchers yogurt though. I found it's the healthiest w/o tasting like crap. If you make grilled chicken wraps with veggies, that's good too. They're easy to make and cheap ingredients! You can find all sorts of healthy things to put in a wrap. Buy whole wheat wraps and whatever filling you want. Buy white meat chicken and grill it. Cheese is good in it too. Just buy skim or low fat cheese. Good luck! (Tip: don't buy organic produce. It's really expensive and it doesn't benefit your body that much)|`|HvH9X6ksaa	that is very healthy, i would suggest that you eat some more calcium, maby if you had a yogurt of something, you can also check some websites like<br>  <br>  <a href="http://women.webmd.com/guide/nutrition-101-how-to-eat-healthy" rel="nofollow">http://women.webmd.com/guide/nutrition-1...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2007/07/30/16-ways-to-eat-healthy-while-keeping-it-cheap/" rel="nofollow">http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2007/0...</a>|`|Ou3rGsYkaa	The only thing id say is add a bit more to your lunch, but other than that, youre doing soso well!|`|4fded85bb017fba5407e3727176079ffaa	Very healthy.

BhFeii5Xaa	It is like any other injection into the muscle of your arm, it stings a bit.<br>  <br>  Believe me, it is absolutely necessary that you get these immunizations. You may think Polio has been wiped out. But it hasn't been completely eliminated.<br>  <br>  I was a child in the 50s and our parents were totally paranoid about us seeing people and being in public places in warm weather. Your generation worries about drive by shootings, we worried about being possibly paralyzed with this disease.<br>  <br>  My husband got the polio virus when he was 8. He spent a year in the Children's hospital. His spine was affected and he has major scoliosis. His shoulders and upper chest region did not develop properly so he has limited use of his arms. His best friend also had it at the same time. He has very little use of his lower body. Has been on crutches for most of his life. He is now in wheel chair as an older man.<br>  <br>  It is so very important to keep these immunizations current.|`|3QIWdvG1aa	The polio vaccine is given in a series of shots. The number of shots required and the booster schedule will depend on the age of the person being vaccinated. Follow your doctor's instructions or the schedule recommended by the health department of the state you live in.<br>  <br>  Be sure you receive all recommended doses of this vaccine. If you do not receive the full series of vaccines, you may not be fully protected against the disease.<br>  <br>  You can still receive a vaccine if you have a cold or fever. In the case of a more severe illness with a fever or any type of infection, wait until you get better before receiving this vaccine.You should not receive a booster vaccine if you had a life-threatening allergic reaction after the first shot.Keep track of any and all side effects you have after receiving this vaccine. When you receive a booster dose, you will need to tell the doctor if the previous shots caused any side effects.<br>  <br>  Becoming infected with polio vaccine is much more dangerous to your health than receiving the vaccine to protect against it. Like any medicine, this vaccine can cause side effects, but the risk of serious side effects is extremely low.<br>  What is polio vaccine?<br>  <br>  Polio affects the central nervous system and spinal cord. It can cause muscle weakness and paralysis. Polio is a life-threatening condition because it can paralyze the muscles that help you breathe.<br>  <br>  The polio vaccine is used to help prevent these diseases in children.<br>  <br>  This vaccine works by exposing you to a small dose of the bacteria or a protein from the bacteria, which causes the body to develop immunity to the disease. This vaccine will not treat an active infection that has already developed in the body.<br>  <br>  Polio vaccine is for use in adults and children who are at least 2 months old.<br>  <br>  Like any vaccine, the polio vaccine may not provide protection from disease in every person.<br>  What should I discuss with my healthcare provider before receiving polio vaccine?<br>  donot  <br>  Before receiving a polio vaccine, tell the doctor if you have:<br>  <br>      * a bleeding or blood clotting disorder such as hemophilia or easy bruising;<br>      * a history of seizures;<br>      * a neurologic disorder or disease affecting the brain (or if this was a reaction to a previous vaccine);<br>      * an allergy to latex rubber;<br>      * a weak immune system caused by disease, bone marrow transplant, or by using certain medicines or receiving cancer treatments;<br>      * if you are taking a blood thinner such as warfarin (Coumadin); or<br>      * if you are pregnant;<br>  <br>  You can still receive a vaccine if you have a cold or fever. In the case of a more severe illness with a fever or any type of infection, wait until you get better before receiving this vaccine.<br>  nopreg  Vaccines may be harmful to an unborn baby and generally should not be given to a pregnant woman. However, not vaccinating the mother could be more harmful to the baby if the mother becomes infected with a disease that this vaccine could prevent. Your doctor will decide whether you should receive this vaccine, especially if you have a high risk of infection with polio.<br>  nobrfeed  Do no not receive this vaccine without telling your doctor if you are breast-feeding a baby.<br>  How is polio vaccine administered?<br>  <br>  This vaccine is given as an injection (shot) into a muscle. You will receive this injection in a doctor's office or other clinic setting.<br>  <br>  Polio vaccine is recommended for all children. It is also recommended for adults in the following situations:<br>  <br>      * people who have never been vaccinated against polio;<br>      * people who travel to areas where polio is common;<br>      * people who handle polio virus in a laboratory or other setting; or<br>      * people who treat patients who have polio.<br>  <br>  The polio vaccine is given in a series of shots. Children should receive a total of 4 shots. The first shot is usually given when the child is 2 months old. The booster shots are then given at 4 months, 6 to 18 months, and then 4 to 6 years of age.<br>  <br>  Adults who have never been vaccinated against polio should receive a total of 3 shots.

PUXmTrnMaa	That is hard to say. You have to realize that by putting your body in starvation mode in the first place you put it into shock. It is VERY unhealthy and now your system does not trust you. It will take extra time to feel comfortable about burning food and trusting that you are going to feed it regularly. Don't be surprised if it goes a little overboard on "saving" before it starts going back to normal. Hopefully you learn from this and never starve your body again. Look at your body like it was a car. No gas, no go. Cheap gas and it runs like crap :-)|`|QP8LdPLeaa	what kind of foods are you eating? how many times are you eating a day? how long do you work out? or are you even active. try training yourself to eat every 4 hours. if you're still hungry in between, buy low-calory snakes like beef jerky bites and pickles, there are peanut butter cookies that are 80 calories a piece. try and occupy yourself.|`|xqQO81Omaa	When you lose weight on the scale, but your body fat percentage stays the same. Nothing worse than losing 10lb only to find it was mostly muscle.

UZJ7wVc8aa	Depends what your body fat percentage is. If it's low then sit ups will give you abs, if it's high, sit ups won't solve your problem.<br>  <br>  Getting a nice set of abs is such a misunderstood process. It's actually a lot easier than most people think which is why most people are in a never ending quest to get that perfect six pack - it's because they're doing all the wrong things.<br>  <br>  When you eat more calories than you burn, your body takes those extra calories and stores them as fat somewhere on your body. For some people, the #1 fat storage area is around the thighs and for others it might be around the stomach - it differs from person to person. Sometimes the fat is perfectly distributed around the body so it's not as big of a concern. <br>  <br>  If an excessive amount of fat is stored around your stomach, the reason that you're not seeing your abs is because your body fat percentage is too high. What you need to do is create a calorie deficit (take in less calories than you burn) so that your body is forced to use its fat stores for energy. After a few weeks of doing this, you'll notice that your abs will start to show.<br>  <br>  You first step is to figure out how many calories you burn each day. Use this calculator <a href="http://calorieneedscalculator.com" rel="nofollow">http://calorieneedscalculator.com</a> for an estimate. Now you need to increase the amount of calories you burn by exercising more and decreasing the amount of calories you eat. Cut out junk food such as fast food, candy and sugar. Eat foods that are high in fiber: bread and pasta made from 100% whole wheat, brown rice, oats, fruits and vegetables.<br>  <br>  You shouldn't ignore targeting your abs with sit ups, leg raises and twists but doing hundreds of sit ups won't do anything about the layer of fat that is covering them. Cardio and calorie restriction should be your main focus. If you need more details on getting a six pack, visit The Guide to Getting Nice Abs - <a href="http://www.straightabs.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.straightabs.com</a>|`|N9nJWYa5aa	If you are doing "good" crunches they will help to develop your abs, but they have to be done well and if you just work on your abs and the running it's going to look, well, odd!<br>  <br>  Yes you can spot train, it's weight loss where you can't spot reduce!

Working out can dehydrate you so don't exercise too much. Also a little bit of fat is good. It just lets you know that you are healthy. No matter how skinny you get, you are still going to have a little bit of fat on your stomach. As for stretch marks, try some lotion that is used for people who are pregnant and trying to avoid stretch marks. If you have stretch marks it helps them fade.Coco butter also works really well too.

TNytY4XBaa	Sea salt and table salt have the same nutritional value. The real differences between sea salt and table salt are in their taste and texture. <br>  <br>  Sea salt is harvested from seawater through evaporation. Table salt is typically from rock salt, which is mined from mineral deposits. Both types of salt can be fully refined, and the end result is pure sodium chloride. Variations in the refining process result in different forms of salt. <br>  <br>  Table salt is a fine-grained salt that often contains added iodine (iodized salt). Iodine is necessary for normal thyroid function. Some table salt may also contain anti-caking ingredient. <br>  <br>  Sea salt is available in fine or coarse grain. Sea salt has a slightly different taste than table salt because of different minerals it contains. Many people prefer sea salt to table salt because they claim it has a more subtle flavor. Sea salt doesn't contain iodine or any other additives. However, if you use sea salt you typically don't have to worry about not getting enough iodine in your diet because iodine is available in many other foods, including dairy products, seafood and many processed foods. <br>  <br>  If you favor foods with fewer additives, you may prefer sea salt. But there's no evidence that the additives in table salt are harmful to your health. Although your body needs some sodium to function properly, most people eat too much, which can lead to high blood pressure. Whether you use sea salt, table salt or some other type of salt, most experts recommend between 1,500 and 2,300 milligrams of sodium a day for healthy adults.|`|c63c1a8a3f313613d03647643c55dd58aa	Has more of a variety of nutrients than "mined" salt.|`|222c3710b1c82cfb0a40a144369157a8aa	They may be slightly different in composition but basically there's no difference.

aAXw9gD8aa	It will depend on your height and weight at the moment, not so much your age.<br>  I'd ask at the shop or get your dad to ask and they'd probably give you some good advice.<br>  The trouble is with these things though is it takes a lot of effort on your behalf to get it to work.  It includes high amounts of protein which is good for your muscle growth, but you have to use this protein for muscle, not for a fat build up.<br>  Also, be very careful with your working out, make sure you do it in moderation, or you CAN stunt your growth.<br>  To be honest, at 14, I think your dad may be pushing you a bit for rugby.  Although it's great for the sport and it appeals to the girls, I believe it's better to wait a while just to prevent anything bad from happening to you.<br>  It's probably fine, but I'd get it checked out.  Also, if you're starting body building at 14, you should  consult your GP about it.  Don't worry - all it takes is one quick check-up and some good advice.<br>  <br>  Oh, and also, remember that although annoying, your overall diet WILL have an effect on how fast your body is growing.  The diet is one of the most underestimated things in body building.  Make sure it's balanced, and cut out on any bad foods - but then again, you've probably heard about this enough for one life time.  Make sure you're eating low fat dairy products and a large amount of red meat.|`|36a3ynpJaa	It certainly won't hurt you since it is just protein and vitamins.  The big downside is that you have to have so often and it gets pretty boring after  a week or two.  <br>  <br>  Working out will help for sure along with a good program.  Your muscles need to rest a few days a week to repair.   Circuit training is best for even body building.  I think the PX90 DVD will do better for you than the protein shakes.  I know someone who has that and they say it is a lot of fun.|`|CLQxDI6waa	I say it's not safe for any teen cause your body is probably still growing, now about how to make it work better the best bet is to talk to your doctor because taking more than directed with a medicine could be harmful, good luck!

If you get shingles, make sure you call your son's ped right away.|`|3QIWdvG1aa	Chickenpox is caused by the varicella-zoster virus. It can spread easily. You can get it from an infected person who sneezes, coughs, or shares food or drinks. You can also get it if you touch the fluid from a chickenpox blister.<br>  <br>  A person who has chickenpox can spread the virus even before he or she has any symptoms. Chickenpox is most easily spread from 2 to 3 days before the rash appears until all the blisters have crusted over.<br>  <br>  You are at risk for chickenpox if you have never had the illness and have not had the chickenpox vaccine. If someone you live with gets chickenpox, your risk is even higher because of the close contact.<br>  You can prevent chickenpox by getting the chickenpox (varicella) vaccine. Doctors recommend two doses of this shot for most children 12 months of age and older who have not had chickenpox. Older children and adults who have not had chickenpox and have not yet had the vaccine can also get the shot.<br>  <br>  Most children do not have a reaction from the vaccine. But if your child has a serious or long-term illness, talk to your doctor about whether your child should have the vaccine. These children may have a bad reaction from the vaccine.<br>  <br>  If you have been around a person who has the virus and you have not had chickenpox or the vaccine, you still may be able to prevent the illness. Get a shot of chickenpox antibodies or the vaccine right away.<br>  <br>  Rarely, people who have had the vaccine still get chickenpox. This is called a breakthrough infection. If this happens, you will probably get a milder form of the virus, with fewer blisters and symptoms.<br>  <br>  Do not expose your child to chickenpox on purpose. Some parents expose their children to chickenpox because they think it is safer for children to have the illness when they are young. But this isn't a good idea, because even young children can have serious problems from chickenpox.|`|wwi7SKVpaa	Call a doctor and get advice from them.

AA11091145	The wellbutrin will give you more energy.  It is an antidepressant, but also is a mild stimulant.  Some people notice that the brand name of wellbutrin works better than the generic.  I've seen a lot of postings on this, but I personally haven't noticed a difference.   Wellbutrin will also increase your sex drive a bit.  <br>  <br>  I like taking a combination of lexapro and wellbutrin at the same time.  Lexapro is a better antidepressant, but zaps your energy and your sex drive.  Wellbutrin gives you back that energy.  When combining, I take a lower dose of wellbutrin, just enough to give me energy.  This usually keeps off any weight gain caused by lexapro.<br>  <br>  I think you will be sucessful.

This is really something you need to speak with your Dr about, I'm assuming (hopefully) that you were on lexapro for GAD or anxiety and that he switched you because wellburtin is an antidepressant too with a side effect of an appetite suppressant. Otherwise, I'm not sure what good it would do.
ItJzrvQ4aa	jogging is an excellent exercise because it let you lose weight<br>  evenly throughout your whole body. If you want to lose weight in<br>  specific areas, you should target them with exercises. If they are<br>  your problem areas, they will be very difficult to tone. You will have<br>  to work double on them. The best approach is this:<br>  1. Lower/control your daily calorie intake (control for normal<br>  weight, lower for overweight).<br>  2. Run/jog to lower your overall body fat percentage.<br>  3. Target your problem areas with exercises.<br>  an  excellent  exercise,  you  can do it in front of your TV: sit on a<br>  stool,  and  put  your toes under something (piece of heavy furniture,<br>  for  example). In your hands hold a little dumbbell. Please, make sure<br>  that  it  is  not very heavy, start with one kilo, for example, or you<br>  will  damage  your  back and spine! Slowly move the upper part of your<br>  body  back, until it's parallel with the ground. Stop for a second and<br>  move it back to the sitting position. Repeat ten times. Every week add<br>  to  the  number  of  repetitions.  You will see the results in a week,<br>  guaranteed! You will see or feel under the fat - if you have any - six<br>  pack  and  muscles.

To me the best results are when you can stretch back out.  For example doing your crunches on an exercise ball, ab lounger, bender ball--anything where your abs constrict and expand.  I mean if you see the commercial it really makes sense.  Your abs do a lot more work if you are going from \ to / as opposed to _ to / (you know it made far more sense when I was demonstrating with my hand than when I had to find a key to use).  <br>  <br>  Either way if you are stretching back out it gives you a way better workout on the abs.<br>  <br>  And as far as people spazing out when you work out, that's just crazy.  You don't keep a good body that isn't fat not even chunky without working out.  And if you develop good habits when you are young you are more likely to continue when you get a little older and your metabolism slows down.  It's way easier to be thin at 21 than 37.<br>  <br>  As for seeing results, I can feel results the next day but usually it takes a good 2 weeks before I see any results.|`|TuOp3hNPaa	do situps.  when doin crunches to many ppl jus lift there head up.  if u do do crunches then make sure ur back is completely straight and u lift ur whole back off the ground an keep ur back and neck straight.

So even if you were to walk for an hour a day it will take you almost 3 months just too loose 1 kg of fat. Also you can not take of fat from a certain body part by working out that part particularly. I am telling you all this from my own personal experience i was a little over 100 kgs , and trust me at that time in desperation i have bought anything and every thing that claims to make you loose weight. Non of them really did what they promised. I then learn t from my own research that then only way to loose fat quickly and permanently is by working out and eat healthy, that when i came across the X - MELT program from X attack its a in home based training program , with tons of fun workouts to do at home itself with out any equipment and also custom made nutrition plans by some hot shot nutritionist. Its highly effective healthy weight loss program. I came down to 78 kgs in 3 months of this program. The best thing i liked about this program is the amount of knowledge their staff has to offer, also how they weren't just interested in having to loose weight but also give my body a great shape for the first time in my life. I as a happy client of theirs will totally recommend this program to anyone looking forward to loosing weight. Here is their URL if you want to have a look at their website for more info.

Also, by removing excess belly fat, you can undercover your hidden six pack. <br>  <br>  The Hidden Dangers of Your Excess Abdominal Fat - It's More Serious Than a Vanity Issue!<br>  <br>  by Mike Geary, Certified Nutrition Specialist, Certified Personal Trainer<br>  <br>  Did you know that the vast majority of people in this day and age have excess abdominal fat? The first thing that most people think of is that their extra abdominal fat is simply ugly, is covering up their abs from being visible, and makes them self conscious about showing off their body.<br>  <br>  However, what most people don't realize is that excess abdominal fat in particular, is not only ugly, but is also a dangerous risk factor to your health. Scientific research has clearly demonstrated that although it is unhealthy in general to have excess body fat throughout your body, it is also particularly dangerous to have excess abdominal fat.<br>  <br>  There are two types of fat that you have in your abdominal area. The first type that covers up your abs from being visible is called subcutaneous fat and lies directly beneath the skin and on top of the abdominal muscles.<br>  <br>  The second type of fat that you have in your abdominal area is called visceral fat, and that lies deeper in the abdomen beneath your muscle and surrounding your organs. Visceral fat also plays a role in giving certain men that "beer belly" appearance where their abdomen protrudes excessively but at the same time, also feels sort of hard if you push on it.<br>  <br>  Both subcutaneous fat and visceral fat in the abdominal area are serious health risk factors, but science has shown that having excessive visceral fat is even more dangerous than subcutaneous fat. Both of them greatly increase the risk your risk of developing heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, stroke, sleep apnea, various forms of cancer, and other degenerative diseases.<br>  <br>  Part of the reason visceral fat is particularly dangerous is that it apparently releases more inflammatory molecules into your body on a consistent basis.<br>  <br>  If you care about the quality of your life and your loved ones, reducing your abdominal fat should be one of your TOP priorities! There's just no way around it. Besides, a side-effect of finally getting rid of all of that excessive ugly abdominal fat is that your stomach will flatten out, and if you lose enough stomach fat, you will be able to visibly see those sexy six pack abs that everyone wants.<br>  <br>  So what gets rid of extra abdominal fat? Is there actually a REAL solution beyond all of the gimmicks and hype that you see in ads and on commercials for "miracle" fat loss products?<br>  <br>  The first thing you must understand is that there is absolutely NO quick fix solution. There are no pills or supplements of any sort that will help you lose your abdominal fat faster. Also, none of the gimmicky ab rockers, rollers, or ab belts will help get rid of abdominal fat either. You can't spot reduce your stomach fat by using any of these worthless contraptions. It simply doesn't work that way.<br>  <br>  The ONLY solution to consistently lose your abdominal fat and keep it off for good is to combine a sound nutritious diet full of unprocessed natural foods with a properly designed strategic exercise program that stimulates the necessary hormonal and metabolic response within your body. Both your food intake as well as your training program are important if you are to get this right.<br>  <br>  I've actually even seen a particular study that divided thousands of participants into a diet-only group and an exercise/diet group. While both groups in this study made good progress, the diet-only group lost significantly LESS abdominal fat than the diet & exercise combined group.<br>  <br>  Now the important thing to realize is that just any old exercise program will not necessarily do the trick. The majority of people that attempt getting into a good exercise routine are NOT working out effectively enough to really stimulate the loss of stubborn abdominal fat. I see this everyday at the gym.<br>  <br>  Most people will do your typical boring ineffective cardio routines, throw in a little outdated body-part style weight training, and pump away with some crunches and side bends, and think that they are doing something useful for reducing their abdominal fat. Then they become frustrated after weeks or months of no results and wonder where they went wrong.|`|rA0ozMMcaa	If you are really seriously to loss weight and tone up your body, then do not trust anyone.

Bdg7IsH8aa	Hi<br>  I feel ur pain i'm not exactly the thinnest person and i can't keep off the crappy foods either!

If u take GCSE PE this could be a good thing joining clubs not just too keep at a healthy weighy but also to keep your grades up. If team sports aren't your thing then you could always go to a gym, and get your friends to come to, and when it comes to the crappy food, their's lent coming up, you and your friends could make a deal to all give something up and the one that doesn't has to forefit, (i know this sounds cheesy, but it works 4 me, my friends give me willpower) Have you tried talking to your mum, asking her to buy healthy foods so if u r bored u don't have the urge to rumage through the cupboards for some biccys, and finally i don't know if i'm just a weirdo but i find a nice tasting chewing gum keeps my mouth going so i don't have that urge to eat? <br>  Hope i helped!!<br>  good luck, and don't worry<br>  Xx|`|8O0vy4Fkaa	y cant u jus b happy wi way u r?

UZJ7wVc8aa	Getting a nice set of abs is such a misunderstood process. It's actually a lot easier than most people think which is why most people are in a never ending quest to get that perfect six pack - it's because they're doing all the wrong things.<br>  <br>  When you eat more calories than you burn, your body takes those extra calories and stores them as fat somewhere on your body. For some people, the #1 fat storage area is around the thighs and for others it might be around the stomach - it differs from person to person. Sometimes the fat is perfectly distributed around the body so it's not as big of a concern. <br>  <br>  If an excessive amount of fat is stored around your stomach, the reason that you're not seeing your abs is because your body fat percentage is too high. What you need to do is create a calorie deficit (take in less calories than you burn) so that your body is forced to use its fat stores for energy. After a few weeks of doing this, you'll notice that your abs will start to show.<br>  <br>  You first step is to figure out how many calories you burn each day. Use this calculator <a href="http://calorieneedscalculator.com" rel="nofollow">http://calorieneedscalculator.com</a> for an estimate. Now you need to increase the amount of calories you burn by exercising more and decreasing the amount of calories you eat. Cut out junk food such as fast food, candy and sugar. Eat foods that are high in fiber: bread and pasta made from 100% whole wheat, brown rice, oats, fruits and vegetables.<br>  <br>  You shouldn't ignore targeting your abs with sit ups, leg raises and twists but doing hundreds of sit ups won't do anything about the layer of fat that is covering them. Cardio and calorie restriction should be your main focus. If you need more details on getting a six pack, visit The Guide to Getting Nice Abs - <a href="http://www.straightabs.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.straightabs.com</a>|`|a5ExZKCiaa	Ooooooooooo u told your b'day wish it is not goping to come true|`|w2LKUYWMaa	They're all great!  You can't go wrong with push-ups or crunches as far as getting stronger goes.  They're great because you don't need equipment; you're only using your body weight to get stronger.  Specifically for your abs, push-ups are effective, but you should probably focus on sit-up exercises.  Just make sure that whatever you do, planks, crunches, "superman," try using your abdominal muscles more than anything else (i.e., when doing sit-ups, don't pull on your neck with your arms).<br>  <br>  I hope this helped!  The best of luck to you.|`|oSNz2pfDaa	Hi there, I used to have the fattest stomach. Here,s a good site I found that really helped.

wwRbkCMraa	Yes Whey protein is safe.  Baby food has whey protein. Virtually all dairy products have some amount of whey protein.  The protein in milk is 20% whey, so whey in its concentrated form should be perfectly fine at any age as long as you are not lactose intolerant.  Next time you are at the store look at the label on some baby formula.  Even that has whey protein in it.  Start reading labels and you will see many foods that contain whey, and are safe at any age.<br>  <br>  Make sure you use a pure whey protein with No artificial Sweeteners, No artificial Flavors, No artificial Fillers etc.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.buybulkwhey.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.buybulkwhey.com/</a><br>  <br>  These guys sell the highest quality and best priced pure whey protein.|`|52Vmf8Toaa	it is better to take them after workouts<br>  but please remember:<br>  <br>  protein shakes ARE NOT a miracle drink that will help you gain weight and look good straight away - it is not that easy,<br>  If you want to bulk up and gain muscle, then you should take the protein in the evening after exercise<br>        you mentioned nothing about working out or exercise in your description, so PLEASE!! : you must make sure that when taking protein supplements that you are doing a lot of exercise and workouts in order to turn that protein into muscle, otherwise, you will just end up with a load of fat - believe me|`|2WqvVRa7aa	There is no point in eating whey protein in the morning. Whey is a fast digesting protein, meaning you should eat/drink it after a workout for optimal effects. As for safety, it is fine. Eating whey is just like eating any other food. However, you also need to make sure your exercise routine is in check. I suggest a 5x5 routine.

AA11348638	It's according to what you weigh...if you are overweight it's very possible, that's only 5 lbs a month.  You should do cardio at least 4 times a week, but you can do it everyday if you want, at least 30 minutes.  No matter how much you exercise you have to push the plate back...white food is fattening, no potatoes or white bread.  Switch to wheat.  Grape nut cereal for breakfast or snack, I prefer Grape nut flakes, eat a fruit a day, not a lot of red meat, and try veggies.  God Bless!!!

JEALqb01aa	Generally guys doesn't prefer girls with toned arms but it may vary on individuals. Personally I'm attracted towards girls of the body type of yours.

6NZeItMAaa	I agree with Iboog.<br>  <br>  SET REALISTIC GOALS <br>  <br>  “Lose 10 pounds in a week!”<br>  “Lose 20 pounds in 20 days!”<br>  “Lose 50 pounds by fairy dust!” <br>  <br>  You have seen all the ads … all promising to help you lose weight instantly. <br>  <br>  While some may work, many don’t. Sure, you can lose weight quick and many times you will, BUT…what they don’t tell you is that many times that rapid weight loss is water weight. AND IT WILL RETURN! <br>  <br>  So, what we have to do is set realistic and achievable goals. <br>  <br>  Remember our “One Pound at A Time” philosophy mentioned in the beginning? <br>  <br>  That is our immediate goal. Start with ONE POUND! Then another and another, etc. Pretty soon, you will be reaching your goals and starting to feel and see the changes happening. <br>  <br>  Once you have been successful with your smaller, short-term goals, start setting a little bit longer-term goals. “Today is Monday, July 9th. I will lose 5 pounds by July 31st.” That is not only reasonable, but achievable! <br>  <br>  Think of this: if you set a goal of 5 pounds each month that is a total of 60 POUNDS in a year. <br>  <br>  Stick to your goals the best you can. If you find that your goals are not becoming a reality, scale them back. Make them achievable, because that is a key ingredient to your successful Journey!|`|AA10642668	Acai seems to be all the rage these days.  Oprah recommended it but Oprah is still heavy.

ItJzrvQ4aa	jogging is an excellent exercise because it let you lose weight<br>  evenly throughout your whole body. If you want to lose weight in<br>  specific areas, you should target them with exercises. If they are<br>  your problem areas, they will be very difficult to tone. You will have<br>  to work double on them. The best approach is this:<br>  1. Lower/control your daily calorie intake (control for normal<br>  weight, lower for overweight).<br>  2. Run/jog to lower your overall body fat percentage.<br>  3. Target your problem areas with exercises.<br>  an  excellent  exercise,  you  can do it in front of your TV: sit on a<br>  stool,  and  put  your toes under something (piece of heavy furniture,<br>  for  example). In your hands hold a little dumbbell. Please, make sure<br>  that  it  is  not very heavy, start with one kilo, for example, or you<br>  will  damage  your  back and spine! Slowly move the upper part of your<br>  body  back, until it's parallel with the ground. Stop for a second and<br>  move it back to the sitting position. Repeat ten times. Every week add<br>  to  the  number  of  repetitions.  You will see the results in a week,<br>  guaranteed! You will see or feel under the fat - if you have any - six<br>  pack  and  muscles.  Dumbbells  do  wonders.  Much  better  than these<br>  crunches  -  I  came  up to three hundreds and there was no results AT<br>  ALL.

Muscle and fat are 2 different things.<br>  <br>  To your question, your muscle gains occur in between workouts. When you use resistance training (weight lifting) you are literally tearing your muscle fibers, which is the soreness you feel. Your body makes those repairs (they come back bigger) during your rest period. Your body needs energy to maintain muscle, so they more muscle you have the more it can burn fat.|`|H08vPJ2Maa	Fat can't turn into a type of seafood. Ever.<br>  <br>  Neither can it turn into muscle. It is fat and nothing else. <br>  <br>  Exercising and a proper diet help to make the body use fat for energy. Exercises also helps build and tone muscles but the two are not connected.|`|Jr5YZ8Qbaa	I like a nice bowl of mussels in a white wine sauce with some good crusty bread and a nice bottle of Chianti. There are worse ways to get fat. Have never managed to reverse the process.|`|AA12144656	Fat doesn't turn to muscle.  Fat is always fat and muscle is always muscle. <br>   When you exercise the fat is burned and used for fuel, this happens when you are performing the exercise, and later while you are laying on the couch if you are weight training.  This starts to happen after you have strengthened your muscles and they burn calories while at rest.|`|AA11002304	When does your body fat turn into a shell fish?? How would that happen?? Do you get to travel with the circus after??  If you mean muscle, this is totally different to fat.

When the amount of fat and adipose tissue is decreased, the muscle becomes more visible and dominant. Muscle size can be increased by weight and resistance training, resulting in muscle hypertrophy (increase in size of the muscle).|`|az0fyl3Zaa	Hi, Fat doesn't turn to muscle!

It's delicious, and good for you.

As for gaining weight, it seems to me if all you had was a doughnut, it was probably just water weight (look up conservation of mass).  You shouldn't worry about it too much.|`|8CF7NSIwaa	It is normal for your weight to fluctuate. It is just water weight, this especially happens around your time of the month. It was not the doughnut one is not going to make you gain a pound. And why are you weighing yourself so often?

This is mostly due to water weight.  Curb your salt intake to prevent water weight gain.  Use a low carb diet for weight loss.
PUXmTrnMaa	Please don't waste your money.... It surprises me every day when I see that people are still looking for “diets” or “quick weight loss” after time and time again it has been proven that diets are not the answer to long term weight loss and management. Oprah Winfrey finally figured it out after decades of rollercoaster weight problems. She was so enlightened that she even wrote a book about it.<br>   The problem with “diets” is that you can lose weight but what do you do when you reach your target weight? 95% of the time, people not only put the weight right back on but gain an additional 10%! What Oprah figured out is that losing weight and keeping it off requires a lifestyle change. If you are overweight or unhappy with how you look then what you are doing on a daily basis is obviously not working.  What do you expect to do when you get down to the weight you want? Stay on the diet forever? Go back on the diet every time your old habits put the weight back on you?<br>   If you want to lose weight, gain muscle or just improve your overall health and keep it that way, what you do the first day, the first minute of your “change” needs to be the same thing you are going to be doing 20 years from now. Diets by definition are temporary and therefore have nothing built into them to help you keep weight off.<br>   There are no true “quick fixes” to weight loss and weight management. If there were then the world would not be full of overweight people. The first thing you need to accept is that you are unhappy with how you look or feel or both and your daily routine could be better. Maybe you just want to be even better than you are now. The next step is to make a commitment to yourself that no matter what, you are going stay with it for a minimum of six months.<br>  The most important and difficult part is getting started. Beginners often make a couple of key mistakes. 1) They set their goals to high- think about how long it took you to gain the weight you are looking to lose. It is only fair to assume it will take equally as long to lose. People hit their first two weeks with the gusto of a marathon runner and suffer through major body pain and miserable starvation only to be disappointed by the results on the scale and in the mirror. It will take time for your body to adjust to a new way of eating and having to deal with exercise, so start small. Begin by cutting one or two bad things out of your diet and taking small walks in the morning or evening. Slowly build on this as your motivation and health improves.<br>   2) STAY OFF THE SCALE!!!!!!!  Checking the scale will only discourage you. It can take up to two weeks for your body to even start consuming fat. At the same time you will be strengthening your muscles which considerably outweigh fat. Don’t expect to see any real results on the scale for quite some time. The proof initially will be in how your clothes fit. You should find that what your weight really is irrelevant. It’s all about how you look and how your clothes fit right?<br>   You have a choice to make. Being miserable during your diet in an attempt to lose weight in four weeks that took you eight months to gain and ultimately gain it all back six months after you come off your diet. Or make the decision to change your life forever. Quick weight loss programs reduce mostly water weight or actual muscle mass. As soon as you start putting normal food back in your body that weight will come right back.  Look to magazines like mens/womens health or muscle and fitness for true ways to get tone, trim, healthy or even massively muscular. Just remember, if it were easy to look good it wouldn’t be so special to get there!

8df61e6bfe8263f863d58536e87602e0aa	i feeel like you are very repetative and very paranoid. i looked back at all your questions and you seem to eat the same things every single day, as well as do the same exercises. i think thats why you've hit this plateau and haven't seen the little bit of weight you want to come off actually come off. you eat unbelievably healthy. i think you need to stop worrying so much and start living a little bit more.<br>  and one tip: i would try spreading out your meals more. you eat either 2 or 3 meals a day, and they are large, but your breakfast is usually nothing or a small bowl of cereal. i think you need a bigger breakfast, and you need to eat it everyday, regardless of when you wake up. you also should have a small snack before lunch, so take 1 of the 2 pieces of fruit you have at lunch and eat it mid-morning. same with after lunch/before dinner. you should be eating 5-6 time per day, not 2-3. your metabolism should boost by doing that<br>  <br>  FINALLY, to answer your question, yes thats a good dinner. the pasta isnt too much because tuesday was 5 days ago. you can have pasta 2-3 times a week so don't stress over it. it isnt too much. i would try to eat either the apple or the banana as a snack after lunch so you dont have to eat them both at dinner. also, try spicing up the vita top. i think they are pretty bland if you eat them alone after a while. what i do is i have a chocolate one with 1/2 cup of fat fre frozen yogurt. its ike a brownie sundae. its delicious.<br>  <br>  my only advice for you is to add some more variety into your meals and exercise. you iwll see results sooner|`|sLcIEQEsaa	Too much?

The obvious answer is that any form of exercise that raises your heart-rate is beneficial to you and in that sense, your routine is fine.<br>  <br>  Swimming would potentially be a good form of exercise for you, as being in water, it will reduce stress on your joints.  Otherwise, without knowing your specific goals it's hard to say.<br>  <br>  The only other comment I'd make, is change your routine every 4-6 weeks.

I'll have something small just once in a blue moon, but for the most part, no sweets. <br>  If your meals aren't unhealthy, don't worry about changing those. Pay extra special attention on how much you eat though, because portion control is a major factor in weight loss. A good way to do that is to eat very slowly, and put your fork down between bites. Don't pick it up until you're done chewing. <br>  I know you've probably heard it, but drink water. You really need it in the first place, adn drinking it before a meal will curb your appetite and you'll feel full faster.<br>  It's a good thing to get healthy now, so I commend you. Do it healthy though. That's important.<br>  Now, for the tough part. You need exercise! It's extremely important. My work-outs usually consist of cardio 2-3 times a week, weight room at the local gym as often as possible, and easy stuff every night. A great leg work out a friend of mine told me about is:<br>  Lay on your back. Bring your knees up so that your thighs are verticle (perpendicular to your back). Kick your legs up and down, almost like doing the bicycle exercise, but minus moving your thighs. This is easy and you can do it whenever.<br>  A great stomach exercise:<br>  Stand about half a foot away from the wall or doorway. Hit your hip on the side of the wall over and over, but keep your shoulders away from the wall as much as possible.<br>  OR<br>  When you're doing the leg exercise, finish by straightening your lefs and letting them hover just a few inches above the ground (or wherever you're laying). You should feel it in your stomach.<br>  Crunches are always good. Same for push ups.<br>  <br>  I know you said no links, but I've tried this and it helps. I'd tell you myself, but this should be more simple. This is for cardio work-outs. (running, cycling, swimming, etc.)<br>  <a href="http://health.yahoo.com/experts/healthieryou/8471/sizzle-calories-in-18-minutes/">http://health.yahoo.com/experts/healthie...</a><br>  Look at the column of numbers and words.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|68715d00f9c0b8554aeba265f7cc5d69aa	well if you want to have a diet suggestion<br>  then just cut back in general<br>  try to eat smaller portions. i eat way too much<br>  so i buy gum and drink alot of water inbetween meals<br>  the gum helps me because im always chewing on it<br>  and if you can do about 100-300 sit-ups/crunches a night<br>  then it will help eliminate belly fat (it helped me) <br>  im 5'5" and weigh 120 and im almost 14|`|SCeIOtZpaa	Buns of Steel - Target Toning,     is one of my favorite work out videos.

If you want to lose weight, dieting and exercise should help reduce your weight and slim you down everywhere.|`|Dwz1se0Saa	Go play a sport and don't eat too much :P<br>  I'm a 15 year old guy and you weigh more than me :P I'm shorter though|`|AU5dBi0Taa	"Drink plenty of water throughout the day. Drinking eight glasses of water is almost like a must. And do not forget to drink water in the morning, the moment you wake up. In fact this is one of the most rapid weight loss tips that the dieticians suggest to the people. <br>  Have organic foods for the breakfast like apples, bananas, plain yogurt, tomatoes, carrots, peppers, raw honey, wild smoked salmon, and so on. <br>  Keeping a track on the watch, go for an hour walk. It need not be power walking, but definitely it should be non-stop walk and that’s for sure, in a couple of days only, you’ll start finding the difference in you. <br>  Another tip regarding how to lose weight fast, easy and safe is that you should have your dinner about 4-5 hours before going off to sleep. <br>  The two-point program that will ensure the ultimate success is: regular exercise and balanced diet. <br>  Don’t depend upon fat burning diet supplements. They wont go a long way in helping you sustain your reduced kilos. <br>  Soft drinks cannot benefit you in any way. They contain 150 empty calories, so if you substitute one bottle of soft drink with water each day, it will do wonders for you. It will enable you to lose about 16 lbs per year. <br>  Sometimes boredom becomes a cause of overeating, so keep yourself busy. <br>  If you want to seriously control your weight, then you have to stop yourself from getting lured into trying tempting foods. <br>  As important is to pay attention to the fact that we eat the right food, equally vital is to keep a watch on the quantity. Without altering your diet plan, even if you’ll reduce 5-10% of your consumption, it will prove beneficial. <br>  Eat slowly so that you can get a feeling that you have had enough food and your tummy is full. Eat slowly and fully relish the taste."<br>  <br>  Also here is a web site that tells you what kind of excercise is good for you :)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://lifestyle.iloveindia.com/lounge/w..." rel="nofollow">http://lifestyle.iloveindia.com/lounge/w...</a>|`|bWRetyRzaa	i know it sounds weird, but ddr works miracles!!!!!  it has a section on the main menu where you can go and it tracks how many calories you burn in every song and then at the end.  try to work your way up to the higher levels and do the faster songs.  try to do it consistently for about 30 minutes or so a day.  it breaks a sweat and really works.  also, portion what you eat.  you'd be surprised by how much we actually eat a day more than the prefered servings.  try measuring your foods and eat healthier-you know, more fruits and vegies and stuff.  i hope i helped!!  please answer my question, too!  :)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AjglGttmMakxpDIEzjTcQ2bsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090222112933AAoW9Po">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|3CtoRpRxaa	Targetted weight reduction is quite hard, many would state impossible, but the only thing which really worked for me is wu-yi tea, it can be viewed in the resource box underneath, they have a limited number of free trials remaining, it has been reported in Reader's Digest and CNN.

You'll notice that you will feel more full if you do this. Then never eat after about 7 PM. Everyday exercises (walking/jogging/running/crunches/push ups etc...) about 30 minutes a day. Also, remember that you should drink plenty of water and eat 5-6 times a day (3 meals 2 snacks) You should eat salad more than 3 times a week (i forgot how many times, i think it was 3) and then eat fish at least 2 times. Cut out on the sugary drinks/ soda and that'll be a huge difference too.

What you are doing sounds really good. I DO NOT recommend trying to jog until you have lost weight. Walking is the best thing you can do at this point.

Bananas are a good source of potassium, but since you're allergic that doesn't help much.  Peanut butter and potatoes are also good sources.  Potassium is not particularly useful in pill form because the dosage in a pill so low that you have to pop a ton of them to get any real amount. I believe the dosage in pill form is due to the high risk of overdosing on potassium which can be very damaging to your heart.<br>  So if it were me, I'd actually try to increase my intake of calcium and potassium.

BfmV2KpUaa	Try some basic leg lift exercises. Lay on the floor, back and knees straight, feet together, arms by your sides. Now lift your heels to about 6 inches from the floor, hold them there for a few seconds, maybe do a slow count to 5, then back down to rest. Count to 5 again then lift. Keep repeating the exercise at a steady pace.<br>  You should start to feel the strain in your tummy region very quickly. As you get more used to the exercise you can try holding your feet for longer, also spreading your feet and legs apart while in the air for the count of 5 starts to use even more muscles. <br>  Keep doing that exercise at least daily, for as long as you feel comfortable with, maybe no more than 15 minutes a day is sufficient, but whatever you feel you can cope with. Within a few weeks you should start to see a noticeable improvement as the tummy fat turns into nicely toned abs.<br>  <br>  The beauty of this exercise is that it requires nothing but a comfortable flat surface to lie on. Also combine with the usual swimming, cycling and good old jogging and walking to get a good all-round workout. Basic rule of thumb is, don't overdo it. "No pain no gain" may well be the motto, but once it starts to hurt, you've done enough for the day. <br>  Hope that helps.|`|zon13nY2aa	Sit ups and plenty of them!

ItJzrvQ4aa	There are several different reasons why you may be craving salt. The<br>  first one is that over the years your body and your taste buds have<br>  been accustomed to a lot of salt. If you are trying to cut back on<br>  salt because of health reasons, your body will crave it, simply<br>  because it is used to lots of salt.<br>  Craving salty foods can also be a symptom of adrenal exhaustion,<br>  especially in people who live fast-paced, stressful lives.<br>  You could also be craving salt because your body needs the additional<br>  minerals found in natural salt. These minerals have been filtered out<br>  of our regular table salt. In this case eating salty food will only<br>  satisfy your craving temporarily until your body realizes it is still<br>  missing the extra minerals.<br>  Your body needs approximately 500 mg of salt a day. If you are an<br>  athlete or work hard physically, and sweat a lot, you will need more.<br>  The FDA's recommended daily salt intake is 2,500 mg a day for the<br>  average adult. Most North Americans' daily salt intake is over 5,000<br>  mg. This is the processed, white, refined sodium chloride, which is<br>  toxic to our bodies.<br>  Salt cravings have also been linked to serious health conditions such<br>  as diabetes, high blood pressure and sickle cell anemia. If you find<br>  yourself craving a lot of salt all of a sudden, it may be a good idea<br>  to schedule a physical. Be sure to mention your salt cravings to your<br>  physician, so he or she can administer appropriate tests for the<br>  conditions mentioned above.<br>  If you are craving salt as a result of being accustomed to consuming<br>  a lot of salt with your foods or enjoying lots of salty foods like<br>  potato chips, salted nuts etc., then slowly cut back on your salt<br>  intake and replace it with herbs and spices to give you lots of flavor<br>  without the salt. An excellent way to get the salt taste you crave as<br>  well as 84 necessary minerals is to use Himalayan Salt Crystals.<br>  If stress and adrenal exhaustion are causing your salt cravings, try<br>  eating food that are high in Vitamin C and Potassium.<br>  Foods High In Vitamin C – Citrus, Pepper, Broccoli.<br>  Foods High In Potassium – Apricots, Bran Wheat, Raisins, Figs, and<br>  Baked Potato With Skin.<br>  If you are craving salt, or just consuming a lot of salt each day,<br>  start cutting back on your salt intake. Opt for low sodium versions of<br>  foods and condiments. Start paying attention to the amount of salt in<br>  certain food. Take a look at a bread label. You’ll be surprised how<br>  much salt is in a single slice of bread.<br>  Replace some processed foods with fresh fruits and vegetables and<br>  season your dishes with herbs and spices. Stick with it and after a<br>  while you won’t miss the salt and will be feeling better.|`|DrXWucWpaa	Are you diabetic?  I am type one diabetic and before i went into the hospital, i was craving salt really bad because my blood sugars were so high, causing me to be dehydrated so i drank so many fluids that i washed out all the salt in my body which is why i was craving it.  Are you drinkin lots and lots of fluids? That could be why.  I really think you need to go get a checkup with your doctor and bring up this issue.. please do it.<br>  <br>  Also... you should add some more food choices to your diet, that isnt very healthy!  You need to eat from every food group.  Dairy products, fruits, grains, meat ect.    DO IT!  hehe :)<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck xo|`|BZx4pWg3aa	um, that is seriously unhealthy.

ItJzrvQ4aa	jogging is an excellent exercise because it let you lose weight<br>  evenly throughout your whole body. If you want to lose weight in<br>  specific areas, you should target them with exercises. If they are<br>  your problem areas, they will be very difficult to tone. You will have<br>  to work double on them. The best approach is this:<br>  1. Lower/control your daily calorie intake (control for normal<br>  weight, lower for overweight).<br>  2. Run/jog to lower your overall body fat percentage.<br>  3. Target your problem areas with exercises.<br>  an  excellent  exercise,  you  can do it in front of your TV: sit on a<br>  stool,  and  put  your toes under something (piece of heavy furniture,<br>  for  example). In your hands hold a little dumbbell. Please, make sure<br>  that  it  is  not very heavy, start with one kilo, for example, or you<br>  will  damage  your  back and spine! Slowly move the upper part of your<br>  body  back, until it's parallel with the ground. Stop for a second and<br>  move it back to the sitting position. Repeat ten times. Every week add<br>  to  the  number  of  repetitions.  You will see the results in a week,<br>  guaranteed! You will see or feel under the fat - if you have any - six<br>  pack  and  muscles.  Dumbbells  do  wonders.  Much  better  than these<br>  crunches  -  I  came  up to three hundreds and there was no results AT<br>  ALL. With the dumbbells you will see it in a week.|`|COrM1SQdaa	Targetted weight loss is quite difficult, some peeple would declare impossible, however the sole method that really delivered for me was wu-yi tea, it can be checked out in the resource box underneath, they have a limited number of free trials remaining, it has been highlighted in Reader's Digest and USA Today.

AA10403824	Dear Tony,<br>                  Water is the most important part when doing workout it has many benefits. After workout my trainer suggested me to have a drink which contains carbs as proteins so that damaged muscles start healing rapidly. So i use to have banana shake with egg whites ;) It varies by the intensity of the workout but plz dont drink anything that take time to digest light drink as i do. water plenty of water remember this.|`|QaGJCe0vaa	Water and lots of it is the main drink i would suggest obviously<br>  <br>  But try an energy drink before and during your workout and have a protein shake after you workout<br>  <br>  That should sort you out for def x|`|S31pVLA0aa	Water.<br>  <br>  Water is all you need unless your running a marathon or something.|`|yQdA5rHnaa	water|`|AA12144656	Water is always best, gatorade or a sports drink is only advised if your workouts will be 2 hrs. or more and intense ones at that.  Water will replace the sweat you lose, and keep you hydrated throughout your workout.
48bt3M9waa	Though these exercises are great for building and maintaining your cardio health, neither are particularly great for fat burning because they are too strenuous and will cause your body to burn sugar(glucose) instead of fat. Slow paced exercise such as walking is the best for burning fat. There are charts available which will give you your target fat-burning heart rate based on your age.|`|tSjJpjzKaa	Obesity is caused by unhealthy eating combined with sustained lack of activity. If food gives you more calories than you burn, your body turns on the storage program and puts on fat. This is the basic idea behind obesity.<br>  <br>  Many people try diets, weight loss products and manage to lose a few pounds. But returning to the old lifestyle and eating habits almost always means that weight lost turns into weight regained. Moreover, as diet follows diet, the body gets used to these “lean times” and makes it harder for you to lose weight.<br>  <br>  To all this you may add that following a diet for a longer period of time is hard, because you will always crave the forbidden foods. The fact that certain delicious foods are forbidden makes them that much more attractive. A successful diet means adjusting your lifestyle to your needs, especially by making time for more exercising.|`|S31pVLA0aa	Swimming is definitely better for you than climbing stairs.|`|Hrky2Tigaa	i got my acai info from here|`|LgvOUScvaa	I would have to say swimming, mainly because of the obesity.  In the water you are effectively weightless not putting undue strain on your joints which would cause pain and damage, like the stair stepping would do.  Also, water offers resistance which would help strengthen the muscles and help them be more efficient.|`|QaGJCe0vaa	swimming is an all over body exercise so i would say maybe try and get use to it and do that, its brilliant for you x|`|sxXoLSPxaa	pushing away from the table.|`|AA12144656	The better way to start is to swim, this way there is no impact on your knees, the stairs would stress your knees too much with the angle and weight. <br>   Try swimming and walking on a level ground, this would be much better, be sure to have some good supportive shoes as well.

ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.<br>  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which<br>  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow<br>  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without<br>  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For<br>  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food<br>  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on<br>  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If<br>  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey<br>  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your<br>  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to<br>  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,<br>  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the<br>  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a<br>  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,<br>  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target<br>  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a<br>  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you<br>  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).|`|h8JBSqfkaa	Fruits vegis meat very little bread

Walk for 30minutes, 4 times a week, as briskly as you can comfortably (you should be out of breath and a little sweaty when finished) to tone your muscles sensibly.<br>  5.

UZJ7wVc8aa	Everyone has a problem spot. It can be around the stomach, thighs, arms or chest. No matter where your trouble spot is, the solution is exactly the same. You need to eat less and exercise more. The reason why there's only one solution for all of these problems is because it's impossible to tell your body where to burn the excess fat from.<br>  <br>  When you eat too many calories, your body stores the excess energy as fat in different areas around the body. To lose this fat, you need to create a calorie deficit (eat less than you burn) to force your body to start burning that fat for energy. There is absolutely no way to control where your body goes to find this extra fat. <br>  <br>  The larger your calorie deficit (a bigger calorie deficit means a bigger difference between what you eat and what you burn) the faster your body will burn excess fat and the quicker your body fat percentage will start to decrease. You can increase your calorie deficit by cutting your daily intake and exercising more. Sit ups will do nothing to target the fat around your abs just like squats will do nothing to target the fat around your thighs.

The think that increasing muscle strength some how will change their size. The reality is that size and strength aren't directly related. There is some correlation to it, but if you've ever saw how much a bodybuilder could bench press, you'd probably be surprised. There are so many misconceptions out there about putting on muscle that the average person can't properly figure out how to do things. I want to take the time and show you how to increase muscle size.<br>  <br>  The way you eat is extremely important. Muscle fiber is able to rebuild it self by the food you eat. I've found that a lot of people try to eat better, but they don't take the next step in cutting out all the processed foods. These foods are full of chemicals and other by-products that you just don't want to put in your body. From my own person experience, I believe they slow down the bodies ability to build muscle tissue. That's why you should only by "natural" and unaltered foods at the store. This ensures you're getting the highest quality nutrients.<br>  <br>  If you want to know how to increase muscle tissue at the gym, you have to understand the bodies testosterone levels. As soon as you start lifting weights, they will immediately drop. That means the long you workout, the less effective you will be. That's why I have short and sweet workouts to get the most muscle growth.|`|az0fyl3Zaa	Hi, This program is for hard gainers as he was a hard gainer himself.<br>  Take a look ,This guy really know all the tips and tricks to get through any training plateau.<br>  Hope this has helped<br>  <br>  Ed

Oprah Winfrey finally figured it out after decades of rollercoaster weight problems. She was so enlightened that she even wrote a book about it.<br>   The problem with “diets” is that you can lose weight but what do you do when you reach your target weight? 95% of the time, people not only put the weight right back on but gain an additional 10%! What Oprah figured out is that losing weight and keeping it off requires a lifestyle change. If you are overweight or unhappy with how you look then what you are doing on a daily basis is obviously not working.  What do you expect to do when you get down to the weight you want? Stay on the diet forever? Go back on the diet every time your old habits put the weight back on you?<br>   If you want to lose weight, gain muscle or just improve your overall health and keep it that way, what you do the first day, the first minute of your “change” needs to be the same thing you are going to be doing 20 years from now. Diets by definition are temporary and therefore have nothing built into them to help you keep weight off.<br>   There are no true “quick fixes” to weight loss and weight management. If there were then the world would not be full of overweight people. The first thing you need to accept is that you are unhappy with how you look or feel or both and your daily routine could be better. Maybe you just want to be even better than you are now. The next step is to make a commitment to yourself that no matter what, you are going stay with it for a minimum of six months.<br>  The most important and difficult part is getting started. Beginners often make a couple of key mistakes. 1) They set their goals to high- think about how long it took you to gain the weight you are looking to lose. It is only fair to assume it will take equally as long to lose. People hit their first two weeks with the gusto of a marathon runner and suffer through major body pain and miserable starvation only to be disappointed by the results on the scale and in the mirror. It will take time for your body to adjust to a new way of eating and having to deal with exercise, so start small. Begin by cutting one or two bad things out of your diet and taking small walks in the morning or evening. Slowly build on this as your motivation and health improves.<br>   2) STAY OFF THE SCALE!!!!!!!  Checking the scale will only discourage you. It can take up to two weeks for your body to even start consuming fat. At the same time you will be strengthening your muscles which considerably outweigh fat. Don’t expect to see any real results on the scale for quite some time. The proof initially will be in how your clothes fit. You should find that what your weight really is irrelevant. It’s all about how you look and how your clothes fit right?<br>   You have a choice to make. Being miserable during your diet in an attempt to lose weight in four weeks that took you eight months to gain and ultimately gain it all back six months after you come off your diet. Or make the decision to change your life forever. Quick weight loss programs reduce mostly water weight or actual muscle mass. As soon as you start putting normal food back in your body that weight will come right back.  Look to magazines like mens/womens health or muscle and fitness for true ways to get tone, trim, healthy or even massively muscular. Just remember, if it were easy to look good it wouldn’t be so special to get there!|`|c6zBPGooaa	One can be the ideal weight and still not be healthy.<br>  <br>  You want to lose your body fat, not muscles.<br>  <br>  Eating healthy meals is a VERY important factor in losing body fat. Exercising is important too.<br>  <br>  I`m not going to bother writing several paragraphs about losing body fat, but the key is to have a balanced meal, cardio at least 4 times and lifting weights 3 times per week. Also, patience. Be happy you lost one or two pounds of body fat in a week. Or even half a pound.

A really good exercise is pooping you lose about 100-300 calories per ounce and the poop itself gets rid of some of your weight|`|B12E4rYiaa	You need to do what's best for you and not care what anyone else thinks or says. Or else you can stay as you are and be unhappy with your appearance just to please friends. If you get enough exercise then the culprit is food.

What's more, it's quite impossible because the human body cannot receive such loss. If you insist so, you MUST  be very careful! By the way, such loss in 5 weeks won't be effective because you're gonna put on another 10kgs. you won't resist and this is normal!<br>  you should follow a healty and balanced diet and combine a 4 hour exercise per week..<br>  Trust me! I've made a similar mistake before and now my body has extra "fat" because of my stupidness|`|QLQijWCwaa	The key for losing those excess pounds is easy - consume less food and exercise more often - the issues surface when we in reality try to put that into operation!

I don't know why people think that it is just in wheat!|`|aFK7yD4xaa	Of course. The only grains that contain gluten are wheat, rye, barley and a few other CLOSELY RELATED grains, like spelt. Everything else is gluten free in its natural state - though gluten is frequently added to processed foods. Watch out that it is "natural" brown rice and not easy-cook or something like that, as then you have to start reading ingredients lists to see what the manufacturers have added.<br>  <br>  btw - brown rice is easy to cook. Put twice as much water as rice and a little more water (about half an inch in the bottom of your measure) in a pan, add seasoning and put the lid on. Put onto the smallest ring on your cooker. Turn it on to the lowest setting and walk away. Come back in about 20 minutes (depending on your cooker). ** Push the rice aside with a fork. Is there water? Leave it to cook another 5 minutes and repeat from the stars. When there is no water left, the rice is cooked. Turn the heat off.|`|Jjh16FoHaa	Yep, No gluten in brown rice.

ftidgUNXaa	I don't think you'll notice a different within 2 days. (and 25MG is a low dose). I just started Prozac, and today is also my 2nd day.  Haven't really noticed much.  But sometimes I feel more calm than normal..  It all depends.  If you're really low on sertonin, then within a few days to a week you'll probably notice some effect.  If you're just "medium" on sertonin, it'll probably take 2-4 weeks to work.  Problem is you can't really tell if you're low on sertonin or not!!  That's why some people it works for them in a week, others it takes a few weeks.    It's like your brain being low on fluid (sertonin).  If you're extremely low, then pouring a small amount in every-day (by using the antidepressants) you'll feel effects pretty quickly, since you're very low. But if you're already like half full, then pouring small amounts in every-day it'll take longer to notice the effects. At least that's my theory.<br>  <br>  One thing I noticed is i'm having more trouble sleeping at night, even after the first day.  But Prozac is the most likely of all antidepressants to cause insomina!|`|fXj2kVpPaa	I was one of those people who felt the difference within the first couple of days.<br>  <br>  I have been on Z for almost a year.  I worked my way up to 100 mg and I am doing great.  <br>  <br>  Good luck to you (happiness is on it's way).|`|FEAeTMnfaa	Most antidepressants take 4-6 weeks to have any effect whatsoever.  The change will be very subtle, but after a month and a half if you do not notice any difference you should talk to your doctor about trying something else or changing the dosage.|`|d34NoSGhaa	It took me about 2weeks and I noticed because I wasn't crying so much anymore.<br>  Life didn't feel so glum.

t2R3mEMoaa	Receiving treatment is a private matter but when it affects the family or spouse, it is always good to shed some light on the issues. Yes, I believe you should inform him of everything you know and are concerned with so treatment will benefit her. She may see this (if you must tell her) as a betrayal of trust, but if it will help her then it is worth it, isn't it? Or you can just go to a meeting with her and bring it all up.|`|upvLAyyzaa	No you shouldn't speak to her therapist.  As much as you might want to help, that's not a good idea.  She needs to tell him whatever she feels comfortable telling him, when she feels comfortable telling him.  If you would go to her therapist without speaking to her about it first, that could just create a big fight between you two, and she might not go back to therapy.|`|ziVtTtObaa	Lots of gaps in your question. Why should she not see her moms autopsy report? When we loose someone it hurts and we want answers. If someone we love dies and there is a need for an autopsy we have even more questions. The report may help your wife transition thru her grief more easily. Support you wife. love your wife thru her grief.|`|6a3XXe92aa	If you are concerned about it, I guess I would.  When did mother die?  This seems normal if she is not sure why her mother died.|`|GWRP3vLQaa	Are you in normally in contact with her therapist? Is this different behavior than what has been happening for awhile? Did she say why she wants to see her mother's autopsy report? If she wants to know what caused her mother's death, why shouldn't she know? Does your wife want you to be a part of her relationship with her therapist? It would help to know these things.<br>  <br>  Based only on what you have said, unless you feel that she has become a danger to herself or others, I think you should not be directing her therapy. But if you fear for her safety, then by all means call her therapist.

Fatigue is a common symptom of literally hundreds of different medical conditions (another reason why you can't just go a specialist.  What kind of specialist? A sleep therapist, a dietician, etc) and it is a complex process figuring whether you are experiencing fatigue, or the fatigue you experience is a symptom of something bigger (therefore it's no use in just address the fatigue itself).<br>  It's it's unrelated to a more serious problem, the reason for feeling fatigue could also be simple enough -- being overworked and not resting enough, the dark/cold winter weather and rain, feeling low, etc.<br>  <br>  In the meantime, you may want to consider drinking coffee or tea.

However, I do believe that exercise and eating right is a huge component to feeling great- in many cases eating the right foods and moving your body will totally cure your terrible mindset. The reason? Exercise=endorphins (those natural chemicals in your body that make you feel high) and natural, good, healthy food is called that for a reason. All the crap they put in boxes, tv dinners, fast food- it's all packed with awful ingredients for your body that actually make you addicted to it which is why you keep buying and eating it. <br>  <br>  Start exercising and eating right and see how you feel. If the depression persists talk to a professional and see what they have to say. <br>  <br>  As for exercising during the winter- it's definitely possible and can certainly be inexpensive. All you have to do is go out to Walmart and purchase a couple of weights or some kind of exercise device or you can even turn on some hoppin' music and dance in the comfort of your own home.

Exercise releases the natural chemicals that help make you feel better.  Although I don't believe it's strong enough to help major depression.  I used to run cross country years ago, so I'd run an average of 5+ miles a day.  And walk to and from school.  So I got a lot of exercise, yet, it didn't seem to help much and I was still feeling down. (although I had "environmental reasons" why I was feeling down, such as home life, relationships, etc that where depressing me, not just random depression without cause).<br>  <br>  Another natural approach, which some people swear works is called "5htp". It's suppose to naturally increase serotonin in your brain, just like eating turkey, exercising, etc helps to increase serotonin.  Although will it increase it enough to help depression is the question.And they work differently than antidepressants - instead of naturally raising it, they re uptake serotonin and force it to stay in the brain longer. So antidepressants will have the strongest effect in terms of increasing serotonin.<br>  <br>  There are also natural supplements called "st johns worth" and "Sam E" which many people claim works wonders for depression.  Never personally tried them, but if you want to try the natural approach:  Diet along with all the essential vitamins, exercise, and then adding a supplement such as 5HTP, St johns worth, or Sam E would be your best bet.|`|zsn7lrThaa	Of course, diet and exercise are great!

hEFthejvaa	i'm a guy & girls tell me that the average size is 5 inches. they would know more than us b/c they've seen more penises right?<br>  you should try shaving your pubes if you haven't already it makes your junk look bigger. best of luck........but she sounds like a **** just saying she can't wait to see your package.<br>  you should tell her it's about how you use it, not the size, lol.<br>  best of luck!|`|GQZDcfUiaa	You have a small weenie; sorry. But, they say it's not what you have, it's how you use it.|`|5voSgc6Oaa	I guess it would be ok to satisfy a midget with!!|`|zFwjZy53aa	whoa dude, I feel bad for you|`|WoAAdxHEaa	haha you have a chode....look it up if you don't understand...|`|GB1f4sEEaa	People can be so crude. The average size penis is about 5 inches. Honestly and unfortunately you do have a small penis. <br>  <br>  The penis is how we are judged as men, just as women's breasts size is how they are judged as women. The only thing I can say to you is live with it as best you can. If a woman that likes you cannot accept the fact that you have a small penis there is nothing you can do to make her change her mind, but there are other ways to sexually satisfy a woman, orally or with your fingers.|`|NuUMDTrTaa	There is an old saying that goes "Long and thin, too far in, Short and thick, does the trick"<br>  As long as it will enter, it will do what is required, don't agonise on it.<br>  If the girl doesn't like you because of it, then she is looking for the wrong criteria.|`|ESd9hk21aa	Baby, i think you're underestimating yourself.

Mines small too :(|`|SrgKPAGUaa	yea its small but thats okay she might not laugh not sure sorry dude|`|cQRpOf37aa	the girth is great! i actually think girth is more important, because the "sensations" during sex are on the walls, not at the end of the actual, um, "tunnel". 18 is a more accepting age, 3 inch is commonly seen as below average, but in my opinion, it is not bad AT ALL in comparison to having a ten inch needle dick!! it really depends on how much she likes you, if it is a lot, she really won't care, I know i wouldn't if i really liked a guy. DO NOT act self conscious about it, or mention that you are self conscious about it though!|`|oEoYmcjNaa	3 inches is really small, but personality does count and how you use it also helps.  some of the tips mentioned earlier will help like using your mouth and focusing attention to her sensitive areas.  also 4 inches in girth isn't too bad.  People aren't defined solely on their physical attributes, and if she does criticize you for being really small, then she is not a good person to be intimate with.|`|9Uy4rj1gaa	that is not a normal size but it happens. I think you should start talking to the girl and get to know her first before you start doing anything sexual with her. After she gets to know you and like you more and more....when the time comes any you show her your package she probably wont mind because she'll like you for you and not what you dont have.|`|1Sjxhuo4aa	Well in my opinion, you are a bit below average. It all depends on the girl you're with whether this matters much or not. What pleases a woman most believe it or not is the width, not the length of the member (though length helps some). Hopefully she will accept it because it is a part of you if she truly loves you, and all you can do is hope for the best. Good luck, and try not to think about it too much or you'll drive yourself crazy!|`|fX6QYdxIaa	Ok your not the biggest penis, so what!  Don't focus so much on your penis, but instead on what you can do to make her feel good.  Study up on female parts and how women have an orgasm (clit), then drive her wild.  How you made her feel is what she will remember the most!|`|pMhMwQtwaa	sorrydude that is small but u know what dont be nervous cause of your dick thats not what makes a good relationship...goodluck|`|Z5rztCKyaa	yea dudee its pretty small but its ok. im sure that if the girl truely has feeling for u then she wont mind that much. u can still pleasure her|`|X0HBdCJIaa	I dated a 18 year old that had less than that and now he has twins so I guess it can still get the job done. buy some pills if you want it bigger or a pump|`|1aJjFrUCaa	hunny, thats small!|`|eoagvRWXaa	FREAK!|`|wI5T7tLDaa	It's not bad at all. :D|`|dn2H1Rc6aa	that sucks, i feel bad for youu.|`|LDLTjNCraa	It is true that you can satisfy a girl with only 2 inches.

2wMMAKpOaa	It could be just plain discharge. Every woman gets it, especially right before they start their period. If you have never had a period yet, maybe its signaling that it may begin soon. Another option is that you may have a yeast infection. That may come with buring and itching. If there is an odor to it then definetly go to a doctor. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps :)<br>  -MVP|`|QJHE3z1raa	how do you have it for 6  months - 1 1/2 years???!<br>  <br>  well, that is vag discharge, its the way of cleaning it out<br>  and you'll be getting your period in about a year<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  BUT WAIT; <br>  you know what it is, you just said you have had discharge in another question <br>  you just want people to tell you your getting your period soon|`|S1jddreQaa	Its just discharge, every women gets it.|`|IlweVgxhaa	its just discharge nothing to freak about.

(or get pantie liners!)|`|Yl0ehKj1aa	discharge like everyone else said, you will be okay|`|rtrdOcTcaa	It's perfectly normal - I had it for about two years.  It means you're maturing and will get your period sometime within the next... um, maybe year?  You don't have to see a doctor, it's just the natural fluid coming out of your vagina that cleanses it and lubricates it for when you have sex.  (Your mind probably doesn't want to think about that, but your body does!)  You'll find that when you get aroused there will be more of it.  Also, if you're not aroused and it seems really wet down there for the entire day, you'll get your period very soon - like within the next couple of days.|`|brSfRLspaa	actually it's called cervical mucus, and you start getting it when your body starts producing lots of estrogen, about 1-2 years before you get your first period. Then you keep getting it between periods<br>  <a href="http://www.babychoice.com/Other%20Information/Ways%20to%20Chart%20Your%20Fertility%20Pattern_fichiers/MenstrualChart07.gif" rel="nofollow">http://www.babychoice.com/Other%20Inform...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.fertilinet.com/Cervical%20Fluid%20and%20Fertility.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.fertilinet.com/Cervical%20Flu...</a><br>  your vagina doesn't discharge anything to clean itself unless you have an infection, if it did you would have had it when you were younger. You get it at puberty cause it has to do with fertility. When you do get an infection (and you will eventually) it will be mixed with cervical mucus and hard to distinguish. It's important to go to the doctor when you think you have an infection but it's also important to know the difference between cervical mucus and an infection. They are not the same thing and calling everything "discharge" kind of lumps them together.|`|GiYVrmI3aa	Its just discharge.

FEAeTMnfaa	That all sounds perfectly normal.  The discharge is also normal for a year or two before you get your period.  If you don't get your period by the time you're 15, you should talk to your mom or doctor.  No one can predict exactly when it will happen -- it's different for everybody.  If you are comfortable talking to your mom about it, ask her when she got hers.

No one can tell you exactly when you will get it as each girl/woman is different. We are all snow flakes- unique in our reproductive health.<br>  Genetics plays a big part. So does weight. Health is another factor,i.e., what you eat and stress levels. I started my period when I was 13. I got very sick and lost so much weight that I quite having my period for about 8 months-until, my doctor said i had regained the weight, and it re-triggered my bodies reproductive clock so to speak. I already was about a 32 b bra but almost a c cup at 13. I got pubic hair about 12. My grandmother didnt start her period  or grow breast really until she was 18. Like I said, each one of us is different but I can tell you that you are perfectly normal.|`|87nG6aKaaa	it is normal i have the same thing going on but i started to grow breasts at 8 or 9 and i still dont have my period you should get it in a year or sooo|`|0mcvCOfyaa	yup it's normal and you will probably start your period within the next year.|`|xBd96wvRaa	You are totally normal.

CIsPsB9yaa	I believe that Reiki works on many levels for many different things.  <br>  I think it is great that it is a healing modality that anyone can learn, practice, and use on a daily basis.  <br>  I love the fact that it is also helps one on their road towards enlightenment and that the enlightenment can continue to be found throughout the life of the person working with Reiki.<br>  <br>  As for the distance attunements and sessions...they do work, and therefore are a good thing in my opinion.  And people have a variety of ways that they do their distance sessions/treatments/attunements and all of those are valid.<br>  <br>  As for the different modalities....I think they are great.  Many are what I call Reiki Plus, as it is not just the Reiki energy that is used but another form of energy that is also healing.  I believe these are a natural form that comes about from those who are attuned to Reiki and also find another source that helps with healing and enlightenment of themselves or others.<br>  <br>  But alas....tis only my opinion.....lol.|`|yE2vM76naa	I did my thesis work in the cardiology department at a local hospital. I lost my job at the time, so the director of medical education got me a position in the cancer center entering surgical research data since I had to be at the hospital so many days of the week anyhow - which was real nice - the cancer center of the hospital also happened to have reiki practioners on call for patients. Considering that a hospital endorsed this I was impressed, because they were a science-backed organization. So I went and looked up some of the research on it, and was impressed by the fact that in some measures, it was able to stand up to emperical testing - and I didn't look in whack-a-doo sources available on line, but rather places like the national library of medicine...<br>  <br>  Then I went to work in an alternative medicine school - where reiki was taught, and many of the staff members performed it regularly. I think it is a valuable tool in helping clients heal emotionally, and I think that helping a client deal with psychological dis-ease, is as important as treating biological disease.<br>  <br>  But what really impressed me was about a month ago my dog was stricken by a very bad case of arthritis, and hip dysplasia. One day he was chasing after balls in the park, and literally over night he could not walk to go outside without yelping in pain. The doctors put him on narcotics with no improvement in his ability to function, and we thought we were going to have to put him down (and he is only 7). <br>  <br>  We brought him home while he was sedated, and he slept most of the day. I asked some folks on here to perform reiki on him. The next day we started a new pain medication, and much to everyones amazement he was better than ever - bouncing around like a puppy. Even the vet was surprised. Now, I will admit that sometimes a medication can work wonders, but I like to think that all those people sending out reiki helped too...And I'm real glad I didn't have to put down my best furry buddy. <br>  <br>  If the nature of our being is love, more of it can never hurt, and more likely will be a wonderful medicine to the soul.|`|4a4b9be516eeab81005bf8f97c61e37aaa	I am an animal Reiki practitioner and have had two "classes" and attunements for the first and second levels of Reiki.<br>  <br>  I volunteer at my local humane society and a bunny rescue too.  Our adoption statistics on bunnies has almost doubled since the Reiki started a year ago (another woman channels Reiki at the beginning of the week and I am there to do it on weekends).<br>  <br>  I like doing the distant Reiki work as it helps me to keep up with the work I do on myself.  If I am busy or feeling lazy I feel I must do the work as the many animals in my distance group may need the energy and I can't let a day go by without channeling to them.<br>  <br>  Maybe someday I will go to a "higher" level and wouldn't consider having "distant" attunements for that.  The experience and spirituality of my teacher are important to me.<br>  <br>  Animals LOVE Reiki and are very receptive to it.  They know what the energy is all about.|`|B8BBQZGgaa	Would you go to an acupuncturist who learned by distance??? no.<br>  <br>  Would you go to dental hygienist, nurse, or doctor who learned by distance?? no.<br>  <br>  Would you let an architect who studied online build your house??? no.<br>  <br>  Why not??? Because you can't learn this stuff that way. <br>  <br>  I am sorry to tell you this, but you have been scammed. I am sure you think that you learned a lot - and no doubt you have. But you don't know everything and if no instructor ever watched you do a session, then there is no proof that you are doing it the right way.<br>  <br>  sorry dude, but you aren't a reiki level 3 practitioner/teacher.

fk9AvB25aa	You can have oral and genital herpes at the same time. You can get oral herpes from simply kissing some one on the mouth who has cold sores. You usually contract genital herpes when you have regular sex with some one who has genital herpes. You can also pass cold sores to the genitals from your mouth. Genital herpes usually likes to live on the genitals but it can be passed to the mouth during an out break.<br>  Once you have either oral or genital herpes then you won't be too likely to get that same type again on another part of your body and oral herpes is very common to have (it's what can cause cold sores) 50-80 percent of the world has it. <br>  I have oral herpes on my mouth, as well as genital and oral herpes below the waist.|`|f1174a6f1a9f4cbfe1a8285c6b72ef70aa	you sound like a fun date,|`|6fjMtWboaa	Herpes can spread like wild fire.  If a female has oral sex with a male who has herpes on his penis, she can get the herpes in her mouth.  You can get them anywhere.  I worked at an HIV facility and one client had herpes on his penis and he then got it on his hands.  So if you have sex, use condoms.  If you are having oral sex, use oral condoms.  Bottom line, choose your partner wisely and use protection.  Herpes are FOREVER!!!!|`|EsvJ9ji3aa	oral herpes is cause by HSV (herpes simplex virus) 1 and genital herpes is cause by HSV 2. If a person has oral herpes and give you oral sex you can get HSV 1 on your genitals but it is still considered as genitals  herpes as, as far as I know there is no test that can tell the difference between HSV1 and HSV2 that a doctor will do. If you then have sex with someone who has genital herpes, you will then have both virus so I guess the answer to your question is yes you can have both at the same time, use a condom and you won't have to worry although it does not protect you 100% from herpes it will lessen your chance of contracting it as well as other STD's. Take care|`|973048f8517e0239c85279b6cdd730cbaa	Yes, though if you have HSV 2 on your genitals already, it is unlikely that you will also get HSV 1 on your genitals, because there isn't space for it to hide. It is possible to get HSV 2 on your mouth, but unlikely it will reccur because it doesn't like it there. You probably already have HSV 1 on your mouth, which makes it less likely that you will get it on your genitals because you have antibodies. It happens down there though, alot.

jKqYrUfRaa	The funny thing is, Bongs are sold for "Tobacco Use" In his question he made no reference to smoking marijuana or partaking in illicit substances. People automatically thinking, "Oh! A Pot smoker!" How do you ruin your life with weed? No documented deaths ever occurred from consuming marijuana. You hypocrites base these lies you say off of TV commercials paid for by tobacco and alcohol companies (Even though they have made no effort to research this plant). By the way, everyone does drugs, the food you eat are LACED with drugs. You ever get a headache? You take an advil or tylenol for it. DRUGS ARE EVERYWHERE. Caffeine has ruined more lives. Stop making yourself look like total retards by telling people who know more than you what to do.<br>  <br>  Now on the subject of using a bong. The whole reason of using a bong is getting more out of your substance. If you roll a joint, you have that excess smoke that rises and floats away. That is THC that should be in your bloodstream. When you smoke a bong, you cool he smoke down so you can get a bigger lung-full. Bongs can also filter out some impurities like the tars in the bud, making it a bit (but not a lot more) healthier. You wont get sick from it. <br>  <br>  "Best Answer" .Peace in the Almighty P.|`|Iyvt7ibmaa	I would suggest smoking from a bowl first because it's easier to use and you don't get a crazy insane rush of cold air after hitting the bong. A joint works fine, but it burns even when you're not hitting it, so it's kind of a waste of weed. But do whatever you're comfortable with doing! Weed is supposed to be a relaxer, so be with friends you trust and make sure you're in a good state of mind when you're going into it. The thing you want least to happen is a bad trip! And don't worry about the paranoia, it comes and goes in waves, but as long as you're happy and enjoying yourself, you should have no problems.|`|ykpRiXsNaa	I was paranoid the first time I smoked also, but thank whatever spurred me to follow through with it! Marijuana can be great, but you probably will get even more paranoid when you smoke for the first time. Bongs are great, but it does hit very effectively. Are you staying the night from home? That would be convenient. If you have **** to do too soon following when you plan to smoke, you'd be safer smoking from a pipe, blunt, or joint. Chances are you won't even get high your first couple of times.<br>  Good luck and prepare yourself with clear eyes and some spray!|`|qP0xAMzKaa	Its perfectly fine. its not any healthier or unhealthier in my opinion. It might be smoother, but if it's an old dirty bong it might taste bad. I would go with the joint. As for chemicals, as long as it's a glass bong and not a "bong" that you made out of a pop bottle, its fine. And even if it is a plastic bottle, as long as you don't have a plastic bowl, there wouldn't be chemicals.|`|EBHIdK5vaa	Ok what chemicals are you worried about? The only reason you may get sick is if you get to big a hit or you get to high. I would not have suggested a bong for your first time. They hit allot harder than a joint.  Bongs are allot of fun, you get higher faster. But I will warn you what ever they say DO NOT take the first hit on your first time.  That would be more likely to make you cough so hard you puke. (To big).  Maybe you can tell them you changed your mind and would rather start with a joint or ever a pipe.  Good luck and enjoy|`|2lx4cgYPaa	From one pot smoker to a soon to be another, smoking from a bong or joint wont make you sick, bongs dont have chemicals.<br>  id say a bong would work better as the smoke being filtered through the water will make it not so harsh on your virgin lungs.<br>  <br>  Also, weed isnt worth getting your *** kicked, grounded, going to rehab.<br>  just make sure you have a good 3-4 hours before you see your parents.|`|bGK3UPk7aa	Umm... well smoking from a bong is okay its actually better for you because you get more THC and less smokee.. butt... Idk if your dad is gonna be pissed i'd think twice cuz you get hella paranoid on weed!|`|exMPHWKHaa	I can't believe some of these answers! its incredible how stupid people are. "if you smoke once you'll screw up your life forever!" Listen man im being honest with you, you sound very paranoid but in reality marijuana is one of the safest drugs created. If you can relax and have your friends and cousins reassure you that it will be fine go for it man. It won't make you sick its actually used to eliminate nausea in cancer patients. Calm down and relax enjoy the experience I know it must be scary but don't let yourself think about it too much. Go and have fun!|`|vGxipYJnaa	You'll get more high from a bong generally. If you aren't comfortable with something, then don't do it. Not complicated.|`|AA11173395	The chemicals are the same, whether you smoke from a bong or a joint.<br>  So if you're determined to smoke, there is no difference.<br>  <br>  A problem you make encounter, if you are not a cigarette smoker, is that the amount of smoke taken in from a bong hit is much greater than that from a joint.  Take it really easy or a coughing fit will result.|`|rSTNUGy3aa	Best bet is to steer clear of marijuana or any type of drugs.

Be sure to wear sunglasses and have a container of clear eyes nearby.|`|JZMfUDylaa	you can't get sick from weed hun. the only way it can hurt you is if the grower (the person who grew the pot that you just bought) puts these harsh chemicals in the plant that keeps bugs away from it. (I forgot what its called but a lot of people don't use that chemical so you should be fine) Marijuana is a plant made from God. You shouldn't worry about getting sick. Tobacco and booze are the things you should worry about getting sick or dying. If you want to learn TRUE facts on pot then go on this site: norml.com. It should help you out. anyone who says pot is bad for you doesn't know what they are talking about and are just brainwashed from the media and it's lies. I did research on true facts on pot so if you research some sources will say its bad but again those are false.

GBG2hbQ4aa	Anyone with a mental illness needs the support of family and friends.  That doesn't mean that you allow yourself to be depleted.  It does mean that you do what you can for the person who is ill while you develop the knowledge and the skill base to deal with that person more effectively.<br>  <br>  There is an organization called National Alliance for the Mentally Ill (NAMI) that is a great resource.  There are group meetings available (through NAMI) for family members to get  both support and information.

However, if he refuses to be treated, then...well...that's not good.  And with bipolar, you never know how he'll react.  He could either be so depressed he can barely eat, so angry he could hurt someone, or just ignore it and see things on the bright side.  But they should definitely not pretend the bipolar isn't there.

goe3y4FPaa	THATS SOMETIME.. WE HAVE TO LEARN TO LIVE WITH.. TREAT EACH PERSON.. LIKE U WONT SEE THEM TOMORROW.. EVEN IF U DO.. THEY WILL ALWAYS REMEMBER U..|`|rIzx4OEWaa	This is a question I find hard to answer in short but I shall try, Nothing can prepare you for the death of someone close. i have watched my father die slowly from cancer had to ask for the life support to be turned off on my Nan, seen a schoolfriend years ago ran over by a HGV lorry an killed before my eyes, an fought to save the life of another friend whom I worked with who died from a massive heart attack. The worst experience was when I was hit head on in a road traffic accident by an on coming  builders van who was overtaking two cars down a hill in a country lane giving me no where to get out of the way. he was impaled on his steering rack an it took just over an hour to free him once the emergency services got to the scene. I was trapped all the while because they had to free him first due to our positions in which we ended up. I was also in a life threatening position but had to endure what went until they had freed him an air lifted him to a London  hospital, By the time I was freed an sent to hospital it was three hours after the accident. I will never ever forget that day or the other driver an no death not even my fathers has affected me more than this other driver whom I had never met, nut it turned out I knew of from close friends of us both.  Due to the shock of what happened i now have to have therapy to help me overcome my feelings as in the past I have always kept them within never letting them out, that was my down falll because i did not know how to cope with this event, would you? I hope this answers your question.|`|AUfxSbcRaa	no. death is simply a natural way of life and it is normal for the human body to experience depression and signs of withdraw. Still i feel that giving birth is equally difficult as losing somebody close to you.|`|4oK5JjZ3aa	Yes i do.... besides being tortured with a hot needle or electricity, or a sharp blade. but someone dying also makes a very bad feeling too|`|nZ49ukJvaa	Haha WHAT A LOSER|`|V7lGsaR8aa	That's "Human Emotion" we all have it , some just handle it in a different way !

TsjqzanQaa	Don't you think that sensitivity and function are much more important than "looks?"<br>  <br>  The natural, normal penis has a foreskin.     Like it or not, that's what they are supposed to look like, not scarred, mutilated and partial.<br>  <br>  The foreskin has a number of functions, and one of them is to keep the glans and surrounding tissues moist and sensitive, and smooth.     This is a lot less abrasive to the vaginal walls than the dry, rough texture of the circumcised penis.<br>  <br>  The foreskin also has Langerhans cells, which have antiviral and antibacterial properties.     It's a fact that circumcised males are more susceptible to HIV and other infections than the intact male.<br>  <br>  Have you tried stretching your foreskin opening wider to facilitate retraction?       Have you used a steroid cream to help with this?    <br>  <br>  Doctors frequently don't offer alternatives to circumcision as they very often are members of the religions that try to impose the mutilation of circumcision on all males.<br>  <br>  The only way that you would even need a dorsal slit is if you have severe phimosis, and are not able to retract at all when flaccid.<br>  <br>  Circumcision clean and attractive?<br>  <br>  I was a victim of circumcision, and it destroyed my sex life because it destroyed most of my sexual sensitivity.<br>  <br>  I was unable to achieve orgasm in normal sex as a result of the mutilation inflicted on me.<br>  <br>  Do you want to risk that possibility for yourself?<br>  <br>  Well, it's up to you.      I would reccommend that you look at the site CIRCUMSTITIONS to see about the adverse effects and complications that result from male genital mutilation, called circumcision.<br>  <br>  Then if you make a drastic mistake, at least you will know what you're getting into, as the doctors won't tell you about it.      They NEVER discuss reduced sexual sensitivity, either.<br>  <br>  Circumcision is the worst hoax ever perpetrated on the male sex.<br>  <br>  A foreskin is not a birth defect; it is a birthright.<br>  <br>  ERIC|`|K4zsztkRaa	Actually have you talked to your doctor about steroid creams? You can use creams with stretching excercises and that will most likley cure the problem without any procedure needing to be done.<br>  That's what my friend did. Altho he needed to go to 5 doctors untill he found one that wasn't going to cut him up. He didn't want to get cut and here in America doctors force stuff on people to make money, it's horrible.<br>  <br>  You will lose feeling. I'm sorry but you will and it will be a significant loss. I was circumcised at birth and I am restoring my foreskin (non surgically). And I have almost doubled my sensitivity with it and foreskin restoration doesn't even give you back 100% of your feeling. So from personal exsperience I can tell you that circumcision does cause a lot of sensation loss.<br>  <br>  Who cares what your gf thinks? You are 16, unless it's a truly special relationship you aren't going to spend forever together so don't even concider what she thinks. This is about you and if she's a good girl she will love you and find you attractive no matter what.<br>  Also there is another procedure that I know of, I can see if I can't find a link to it and post it. You do have another option aswell.<br>  <br>  If I were you I wouldn't get circumcised, but it's really your choice and honestly you do what makes you happy.<br>  <br>  -Connor|`|zLUQJxJkaa	If you find that it needs to happen due to medical problems then yes it's good to get it circumcised.<br>  Feeling won't be lost, you won't lose the nerve that you use for... activities.. from circumcision. You also won't lose feeling from not having a layer of skin over it. That's like saying if you don't wear a glove on your hand almost all the time that you won't be able to feel as well. Just not true.<br>  If it were me i'd do circumcision.. at least it's more common than a slit. Up to you.|`|AA10350894	There are other solutions then being circumcised or having the dorsal slit! There is steroidal cream therapy and stretching exercises, among other things that you should consider trying before going under the knife.

When I say that you have to work hard and get your heart rate up.  So many people say they do cardio but they walk or job leisurely on the treadmill or elliptical.  Running is the best way to shred excess fat (make sure you have good knees).  It's not about losing 2 or 3 pounds here and there because it is very easy to gain it back.  You have to change the complexion of how your body functions.  Consistency is the key.  The more you workout your metabolism will burn fat at a higher rate.  Eventually you want your body to work for you, not work for your body (if that makes sense).  And if you want to lift and workout I recommend doing high intensity circuit workouts where you are doing an exercise one after another, to again, get your heart rate up and increase your fitness level (not be one of the those people we do a set, rest for 2-3 minutes and do another one).  There is too much down time, that's good for increasing strength but not overall fitness.  Diet is just as important as working out!|`|biFbXfomaa	Hi there....<br>  I think if you want to lose weight, try some weightloss pill product, but its better you search Products free trial offer first, in order to you have not lost much money and some site offer you Free trial are acaiberry(as a food staple and for their rejuvenating and detoxifying properties), carallumaburn(is patent protected and clinically proven to suppress the appetite )and reloramax (as an ingredient for dietary supplements and functional foods that could be used in stress management and for stress-related appetite control, has excellent stress management properties without causing sedation),unhappily it is for custumor  in the USA and European Union Countries Only . then compare it, if it works,maybe you want to get it more, if it is dissatisfied, leave it. <br>  Goog luck and success for your diet !!! ?|`|iKh2DGCxaa	summer is like 4 months away, so it sounds reasonable to me|`|zAN9JV4kaa	i think you'll be ready, just keep it up|`|N6frEVbiaa	yes

The most important thing is to not do things that can break your fusion.<br>  <br>  I've posted the following a few times for other people with questions. I hope I'll answer the things that have you concerned.<br>  <br>  Let me talk about the hospital stay.<br>  <br>  You'll have meds to help with the pain. You'll start out with stronger meds and then wean yourself from them over time. So, yes, it does hurt, but you shouldn't be left hurting.<br>  <br>  The size of your scar depends on how many vertebrae need fusing and the technique used to do the fusion. A four-level fusion will have a smaller scar than a 12-level fusion. Some surgeries (probably not yours) need both anterior and posterior (A/P, or front and back). Lastly, some people may be candidates for "minimally invasive" techniques. So, this is a hard question to answer without knowing more about your situation.<br>  <br>  Your hospital stay will probably be between four and seven days. Teens typically heal quicker than adults and so their hospital stay is less.<br>  <br>  As for what they do, each case is different. Here's one possible scenerio. Its incomplete as I'm describing things pretty quickly. The amount of time spent doing things will probably differ. Maybe even the order that things are done will differ. But it will give you kind of an idea of what happens. Just take it with a grain of salt.<br>  <br>  You'll arrive at the hospital early to check in. You'll change into your gown and get an IV hooked up. You will talk to your nurse(s) and perhaps a couple of other staff members. You'll then get put to sleep (injected through the IV that you had put in earlier). The operation then happens. You'll wake up, probably in the ICU, but possibly in your hospital room. Probably on the first or second day after surgery, you'll be shown how to sit and then stand. You'll be able to take walks up and down the hallway but you'll tire quickly. Your IV will be removed in a couple of days as will the catheter you've had in you since the surgery. You'll be allowed to go home once your stomach starts rumbling, you're eating, and going to the bathroom. When you are in the hospital, your scar will be checked by a doctor each day.<br>  <br>  You will feel like a truck ran you over for the first couple of days. Once your body starts to recover, you'll feel better.<br>  <br>  When you wake up from surgery, your bed will have a machine that gives measured doses of pain meds (morphine or something as effective). You're self-medicating, so if you're hurting, just hit a button. The machine won't let you overdose yourself, though.<br>  <br>  You'll be weaned off of the meds from the machine and given oxycontin (or the like). This is what you'll be taking for the first few weeks you're at home.<br>  <br>  Bottom line is that you'll be hurting, but you'll be given pain meds to take care of the pain. They'll do the job for you.<br>  <br>  It still takes two months to be doing basic things. You'll be cleared to do more things at six months. At one year, you'll be able to do about anything you could do before the surgery. Take it easy. This is major surgery. It takes a while for the spine to fuse.<br>  <br>  There's a couple of things, off-topic, that will make life easier for you. <br>  <br>  o Make sure you has a robe in case you gets up in the middle of the night when the house is colder. The surgery may mess up your body's temperature control.<br>  <br>  o Get a toilet seat extender so that you don't have to squat as far. These also have handles and certainly made my life a lot easier. Since your chest muscles are fine, you'll be able to use them to raise and lower yourself.<br>  <br>  o It might be nice to get a "grabber" which will help you pick things up from the floor.<br>  <br>  o You may or may not have a walker when you get home from the hospital (probably not, but...). I did and discovered that I had to meneuver through the bathroom door sideways because the walker was too wide. This works, but it may be a bit more difficult.<br>  <br>  o You will be sleeping an awful lot. This is a combination of your body needing rest and the pain meds knocking you out. Expect it.<br>  <br>  o When I was in my bed, my wife made kind of a "nest" with pillows so I wouldn't roll out. I don't normally roll but I think it made both of us feel better. You might want to do the same.<br>  <br>  o It will be helpful to sit in a chair with arms when you're having his meals and is sitting at the dining room table. Since your chest muscles are fine, you'll be able to use them to raise and lower yourself.<br>  <br>  Please email me if you have questions.|`|4lrdrWSpaa	You have a very serious case of scoliosis! I guess you need a "metal rod" to be placed next to your spine (back) to prevent the scoliosis from progressing further!  Furthermore, for each pregnancy scoliosis can progress 5-6 degrees.  Scoliosis compresses your lungs and heart thus, reducing your life expectancy. <br>  <br>  After the surgery, there will be pain but try to resist the intake of "pain killer medications (especially Oxycontin) to avoid addition!<br>  <br>  Best wishes and maintain your posture straight!|`|92BUZcFyaa	I can't really tell you how much pain.

13k2WKx8aa	Haha! You're fine boy-o. You're just stressed! General, plain old stress!<br>  <br>  Diabetes, AIDS, and HIV aren't even close to being related to what you're feeling.<br>  <br>  It's normal to feel tired after eating. If you were a diabetic, you'd feel tired before eating then hyper after (or high and unusual).<br>  <br>  Answer: Again, stress from school. ;-)<br>  <br>  Solution: Give yourself a break. Do something fun! Go camping for a weekend with some friends! Hit the slopes! Sneak into a strip club and enjoy trying not to get caught, only to get caught and kicked out of there by some big bouncer (something to give you and your friends something to talk about and go "Ha! We just did that!" Something fun and relaxing, whatever that may be for you!|`|dffc7b2a5263003ff672067425551ba7aa	It would be best to see your doctor.  If not you can go to a emergency room at your local hospital even if you don't have insurance they must treat you by law.  If you can't pay later when the bill comes you can declare that you are an indigent adult. You can also give blood @ Your local blood bank and they check your blood for HIV and many other abnormalities.|`|lCPQNlWoaa	Stress and a "tingling feeling" are not usually associated with diabetes, aids, or hiv.

You can already see that getting drunk leads you to do things you didn't really care to do in the first place. If your not old enough and mature enough to deal with the outcome of your actions, you shouldn't be sexually active anyway.

pUIGCtaZaa	You need to schedule an appointment with your doctor immediately. If you are over 18, which I'm assuming that you are because you are in college, do not be worried about your parents finding out. You'll have confidentiality with your doctor. To me, what you are describing sound sounds like a serious neurological and psychological problem. Since you are at a college-aged level and are unable to spell/read basic words, I am a little concerned. As far as the feelings of going from "really happy to really sad" that is very indicative of Bipolar Disorder, possibly. Basically, you really just need to go see your doctor and figure out what is going on. I hope this helps. Good luck =]|`|c34c2236afd420be57992daf512144dbaa	I think you should talk to your parents about the first few things. See if you can agree with them that you need to see a specialist once that happens. You need to remember that you are 18 and there is doctor patient confidentiality so once you get to see a specialist you can simply tell him/her the second part. Don't worry, we all go through hard times in our lives and you will come out of it ok. good luck|`|UgZq1pXjaa	Only thing I can help with is I wet the bed past age 15 and wore diapers to bed every night until I was dry.

vVfH8yBYaa	There are a LOT of other SSRIs. If he's having problems of this sort, he definitely needs to tell his doctor and try a different drug. There is no need to suffer these side effects when he has plenty of other options. Having this problem with Zoloft does not necessarily mean he will have the same problem with other drugs in the same catagory.|`|d34NoSGhaa	I'm on Zoloft too. I love it. I've been on other antidepressants too, but this one has worked the best for the same reasons as your fiances<br>  You are correct though, the short term memory loss is a side effect.  <br>  For me it's like... what did I do yesterday?  or where did I put something? or I'll just forget a conversation I had.<br>  It sucks, but I chose to have that rather than the depression. Because the other antidepressants did not work for me.<br>  If he wants, there are the others he can try. Ask his doctor for the other options
XoDUTquWaa	I am hypothyroid. I gained a substantial amount of weight without reason. I was then diagnosed by my doctor as having hypothyroid. After beginning thyroid medication and the doc getting me at the right dosage for me (which can take a little adjusting) I began to lose weight. Rapidly at first then at a slower rate later on. I have lost down to almost my ideal weight with only the right amount of meds. no dieting.|`|mX0qaX3Eaa	Why are you talking about hypothermia?

They tend to be thin as well.<br>  <br>  Medication is needed and it is for life.  It must be taken faithfully and never missed.

Hyperhyroididm causes it to speed up, so when you take pills to regulate it, it cause you to gain a little weight. It also however, causes most of the horrible sideeffects, like anxiety, sweating, insomnia, and some skin issues to go away. <br>  <br>  <br>  Take your medication.
QoS5UOukaa	My fiance and I recently purchased the his and her lube and it was amazing. It goes on cool for both, but not a numbing cool. It's an erotic cool.

Not as watery as other brands.|`|Yl0ehKj1aa	nope i havent tried it....use ky n-e lubricant should work really long as ur not allergic to the stuff thats in it.
CNW6eAjoaa	Progressive thinking health officials now say it is good to masturbate.  Not only is it natural, and common, but regular masturbation helps to reduce your chances of developing prostate cancer later in life.  It also promotes a healthy reproductive system, and leaves you calm and relaxed when you are done.  It is an important stress reliever.<br>  In your early teen years, it is common to masturbate several times a day.  You will not run out of your lifetime supply as your body produces it throughout your life.  You can exhaust your daily supply, but a nights sleep will fix that.  Your body will tell you not to masturbate anymore that day simply by not giving you the urge to do it.<br>  Now, to dispel some myths about masturbation so you do not have to live through your early teenage years on second hand stories and whispered truths,.....no, you will not go blind, develop hairy palms, or experience any other negative side effect.  As you get a little older, you will discover and pursue your sexual preference and experience sex with another person.  This will gradually replace masturbation as your primary sexual activity.<br>  No one wants to walk in on you, so choose a private place and time.|`|lQ8p2QKkaa	It is a very important thing to do! You should do it whenever you feel the urge to. Like, you are in and pop a *****; whip out your wang or, if you are a girl, take your hand down and have fun! Noone will care, or should care.

You can't get a disease, or STD from it, you can't make anyone pregnant, and there's nothing wrong with it.<br>  <br>  And it just feels good.<br>  <br>  I would certainly rather masturbate, if sex isn't available, rather than have a "wet dream" and wake up with cold, sticky semen on underwear and/or sheets.<br>  <br>  And being awake to enjoy the orgasm is much more pleasant.        Cleanup is also easier.<br>  <br>  And you don't have to look your best, nor buy anyone dinner and a movie.<br>  <br>  Sex is better, but masturbation is a great second choice.

nEVoabeSaa	The transverse abdominus muscle is the deepest of the 6 ab muscles. It can have a tremendous effect on body posture. You cannot touch this muscle from the outside. It wraps around the torso, creating an effect similar to a back support belt.<br>  If you can locate this and exercise it, then the spine will be held in the correct alignment. When you contract it you sit up when you relax it you go down. Best of Luck
qKpRCwVXaa	Okay first off you might be suffering from paranoia as delusional thoughts and hallucinations are indicative usually of this type of psychosis. Secondly having said that please call a free hotline for suicidal thoughts such as 1-800 SUICIDE or go to www.hopeline.com for information on psychological disorders. I cannot promise that medication may be the best solution for you but if nothing else psychological counseling with a therapist may drastically reduce your episodes and relieve your paranoia/disease. Please get help as soon as possible and do not delay as paranoia will worsen over time if left untreated, I am a sufferer!!!

BXd4I9mmaa	Canker sores, also known as aphthous ulcers, are annoying irritations in the mouth that afflict many Americans each year. They are different from cold sores, which usually appear on the outside of the mouth on the lips. Canker sores appear most commonly in adolescents and in women just before the onset of their menstrual period. In fact, women are twice as likely as men to get them. If your parents suffered from canker sores, you have a greater chance of developing them. Often, canker sores occur when you are under stress or run down.<br>  <br>  It's probably NOT herpes. <br>  <br>  I get canker sores when I'm stressed.|`|hzMpdFFBaa	I  think a canker sore and herpes simplex 1 are  the same thing. It is not necessarily an STD  but you shouldn't be kissing people when you have an active sore because it IS contagious. Products are available in local drug stores to help canker sores heal. You may have a sore once or twice and never again or else you could have them now and then for years,  <br>  <br>  If you keep getting mouth, lip, or gum sores from kissing this other kid, you should find yourself a new boyfriend very quickly. And if the sores keep happening, you do need to tell your mom and see a doctor.|`|fAFXkikAaa	Most people (50% to 80% of adults) have oral herpes.  It is NOT an STD.  It's usually caught in childhood from kissing relatives.   You don't need to tell your mother - although you could if you wanted to, because you could have caught it when you were five from your grandmother.   In fact, you probably did catch it when you were five and didn't realize it.<br>  <br>  Don't worry.  It's fine.<br>  <br>  If you want to learn more about oral herpes, I recommend the website below.   <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|1KqknaUHaa	It's most likely a canker core.<br>  <br>  If you didn't see any sore around his mouth I really doubt it's a cold sore.<br>  <br>  <br>  It's probably just a coincidence that it happened after the kiss.

pUIGCtaZaa	First off, you undoubtedly have a drinking problem. If you are feeling "normal" while being drunk that is indicative that you have become completely dependent on the alcohol. Alcoholism is very serious, as I'm sure you know, and you need to seek professional help for this as soon as possible. As far as feeling an overwhelming sense of depression when your date leaves, I would consider this to not be normal. It is probably linked to abandonment issues that you have stemming from your childhood. It also sounds like you have a lot of loneliness in your life and are attaching too quickly to people that show you affection. To me, it sounds like you would greatly benefit from seeing a therapist. They would help you sort out these issues and will not judge you whatsoever. <br>  <br>  Good luck =]|`|TEynCQ3Oaa	I think you have some symptoms of depression. You should definitely see a doctor and explain what's going on|`|e1oky4jSaa	Well I think that is great that you found such a wonderful person but until you heal with your own issues your relationship with her will not last. You have to be honest with her about your issues and try to work on them. If she is genuine, she'll stick by you and then you can be healthy and whole and hopefully have a great marriage w/ kids with this woman. Good luck to you, I know it's tough.|`|PEN3hha7aa	The first thing you need to realize is that feeling Drunk can never be considered NORMAL.<br>  <br>  I am not feeling sorry for you at all, but I wish my arms were long enough to reach out and slap you upside the head a couple hundred times for not eating properly.  Alcohol is not now and never will be a Food Substitute.  Do you realize that you are changing your body's chemical makeup and dependencies without even knowing it?  I am not a Doctor or Nurse, but I don't need to be to tell you how stupid you are being.  WHISKEY IS NOT ONE OF THE 3 MAIN FOOD GROUPS YOU LEARNED ABOUT IN GRADE SCHOOL!!!<br>  <br>  All that aside I think you do have a point about female friend being part girfriend/part mom.  That is unfortunate that you did not really have a mother and wanting your gf to be part mom is somewhat normal.  If you really want to keep her you need to get that idea out of your head ASAP.  Most women Assume that by age 21 men don't need a mom/girlfriend.  DON'T ever bring that up about not having a mom because the real world fact is that women don't want to hear that regardless of how it hurts.  Let her ask you about it in time and see what she does with it.  THAT will tell you alot about her and the type of person she really is.   Is she caring and compassionate and willing to help?  You Don't find that in people much these days.  Most people are  "too busy" to care and "don't have time for it".  Notice how they FIND the time to do the things they Want to do????<br>  <br>  You might want to do yourself a favor and talk to someone, even if it is a Community Agency Helpline.  I would not tell her about it just yet cuz the drinking is too much too fast and too early in your relationship.  Your relationship needs a strong "root system" that only time can develop.  The strong root system needs to be there to be able to withstand the "upcoming storms" you two hit each other with.  Trust me, you Both have Skeletons in your Closets.  EVERYBODY DOES.<br>  <br>  Last, there is nothing wrong with you for wanting two parents like everyone else has.  It does not always happen, it is a sad fact of life but it is there.  Do yourself a favor and don't start the pity parties nonsense.   Like my friend Cathe says "Don't borrow trouble"..
BwJOeHDEaa	your weight is good for your height, i think that your good looking, i think your late 20's or early 30's, and nationality, i would say middle eastern, or eastern european, or half asian or poylnesian, and i would say that your personality is really insecure, but you act fun anf have alot of friends and like to go out|`|GiYVrmI3aa	You seem like your could gain maybe 5 more lbs or so. You seem to be in your late teens? its hard to tell how old you are.|`|yeZn6AlPaa	your plenty skinny<br>  i'd say your20 or so<br>  look possible mexican or hawaiian<br>  look happy|`|hOHrNeL7aa	What are you trying to find out if people will f*** you. If so YES:)|`|lxRYFGM7aa	You are to skinny and you look about 30ish. I am guessing they are your children. You should set a better example and eat right and stop throwing up. Once a month is way to much...gross. You really need some professional help. Good luck|`|qog0Yd72aa	You look a little under weight for your age which looks to be around 16.<br>  but other than that you look great. Don't think your fat please, because you are NOT fat at all!<br>  And i think you look a little spanish maybeee.?|`|2rG7rYOWaa	good weight, yes, 16, spanish
S5ZYHiFaaa	sounds like your in the breaking in stage, that's where your body is still fighting off the THC because its new to you, but after a while, your body will allow the THC into your system, thus giving you the full high feeling.|`|FM8aCjmuaa	If you smoked 4 gramsof  (weed) and didnt get high,someone ripped you off. Try getting high by being a productive member of society you obviously dont know the first thing about drugs. Talk to your parents,a youth pastor or someone you trust dont be stupid and mess with things you dont understand. You could DIE from somethings these a###oles sell to young,not to bright kids.Wise up quick|`|goe3y4FPaa	YEAH.. THERES DIFFERENT WEED.. TO KUSH, PURPLE HAZE, CANCUN,ETC.. CHRONIC.. THE STRONGEST.. DEPENDS.. SOME WEED.. GETS LAB MADE.. AND HAS CHEMICALS IN IT.. THAT COULD EFFECT U
M63kq3AYaa	For the same reason women get moody and complain about men plenty.<br>  <br>  Difference is, the hormones we have don't hurt anyone.|`|cr2KKT6Naa	for protection. some woman are just as hairy. if not more if they dont shave.|`|fOp5aWxZaa	nooo! luckily. its because they dont shave and have different hormones.<br>  <br>  thats probably the same thing they thing when they see those girls with gorilla arms. hehe|`|T8bQHOcQaa	Because we're animals ;)<br>  <br>  haha different hormones, testosterone, don't shave etc.|`|0mro55nWaa	Because of the hormone testosterone and plus they don't shave. Think of how hairy us women would be if we didn't shave.|`|8mECLoDhaa	cuz of the testosterone, b***h!!!!!!!!!!
76845aa2d3f727081f73b3db267a28b8aa	yes, Buscopan go to where you are having cramping like the bowels and not in the blood stream,and Vicodin goes in your blood stream and works on all pain.|`|VQlXF8Ucaa	It should be okay to take it now.  The Vicodin was taken 6 hours ago it should be okay.  They are gone after 4 hours that's why they tell you to take them every 4 hours.
qQcw2O4Oaa	He's right. Like the other user said, go to the doctor and get Duac or BenzaClin. They really do start working within days. Or, got to the store and get a gel (like Neutrogena On-the-Spot gel) with 2.5% benzoyl peroxide and maybe some Cetaphil and sunscreen moisturizer.<br>  <br>  First, wash with Cetaphil (or whatever wash you chose)  for 1-2 minutes. Rinse it off, then pat your skin dry. Once your skin is dry, take some of the benzoyl peroxide treatment (not too much) and put it on. Once your skin is completely dry, put on a moisturizer with an SPF of at least 15. Do this once a day for a week, then bump it up to twice a day. (That's what I did since my skin's sensitive.)<br>  <br>  Give something like this a few weeks and you should start seeing improvement. Duac/BenzaClin is really nice, but it will burn like hell for the first several weeks (or more) of using it.|`|c159efe1b44ee4b1b369d779c1d19521aa	It's good. And yeah you kind of have to stick with it but it's either that or something else b/c you have to wash your face.|`|1KqknaUHaa	I don't think it's worth it.<br>  <br>  I would go to a dermatologist and get a topical gel.<br>  <br>  I got one like 2 years ago and my face stays super clear and it works within DAYS.<br>  <br>  -Benzaclin<br>  -Duac<br>  <br>  <br>  or oral anti biotics could be prescribed.|`|2JTBPhuuaa	It's okay but overpriced. Try plain ol salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide treatments form the drug store. I swear by Panoxyl 10% Bar soap, cheap, simple, and convenient.|`|FKwR72iCaa	I've heard good things about it.  I've had acne for a very long time and I've also been thinking about using it.  I guess we can both benefit from your question :D|`|XUujNwTsaa	IT DOESN'T WORK! Try doctor-prescribed meds. They helped for my brother!|`|rdcUOa1zaa	yes ur brother is right. i personally do not have acne. never did. but my brother had it really bad. he used proactive and it worked very well but ur skin gets used to it and once you stop using it ur skin will have withdraws and break out. its best to go to a dermatologist and have something prescribed
A96W1WVCaa	If you're a loner by choice it's the best way to go! I'm not lame, or a loser.. I have plenty of aquantinces, aswell as "school" friends, but I prefer being alone after school hours. My life has been great since I've started doing this, and I've cared less about what people think! Also there is no one in your way trying to influence you to do wrong things, or trying to pressure you. I like it.. but it's always nice to hang with friends after school sometimes. like weekends.|`|BO6S8Pi5aa	sometimes i am one

How long can you count for? It is SOO dependent on whats going on. What food thay ate. Where they are. Whats happening around them. Who's helping it. Wheather there shy or not (Can cause big problems!)! If he's not geting up fast for you, just dont give up. Every guy if different, and will keep changing too!|`|VroLlbhcaa	depends on what you see and if you jacked off in a while it usally takes a couple of min. to get a full bone r|`|qDGfoqW0aa	For me 5 to 10 minutes, or it could take 30 to 45 minutes|`|jWO10NN5aa	It depends on how far he has to travel to get it.|`|X6Di5elQaa	very long (ha ha ha)
ec76af399c519dad926a10430304f541aa	stop worrying so much, if they tested you, then you did not lose enough blood to worry about.  Remember a little blood looks like a great deal when in fact it is not.|`|Gojbv3Nraa	Okay, first...you are not stupid. Despite all that blood loss, you have asked an intelligent question and spoken articulately. <br>  <br>  Next, have the doctors or you tried to figure out what is causing your frequent nosebleeds? <br>  <br>  Finally, I don't know if it can cause brain damage, but I do know it can cause anemia to keep having terrible nosebleeds every day for two weeks. Anemia will make anyone have headaches and "off" thinking. Kind of like a fog....|`|sBVmxwqhaa	you cant get brain damage from "losing" blood.  You should go to the doctor and be checked out again, especially if you didn't normally get nosebleeds before.  Dont leave until your doctor gives you an answer, that's what your paying them for.|`|zkdIn09qaa	unless you lose 3+ liters in one nose bleed don't worry about it|`|HwV8IY7maa	i think the doctor you went to is more qualified than anyone on yahoo answers
ke0dsgkkaa	I'd soak it in Epson Salt or regular salt in the hottest water you can stand (without burning yourself) for a few minutes. Then with a needle either dipped in alcohol or held in the hot water to sterilize. Would prick or open a hole into area, see what will drain easily then soak it some more. Maybe bandage it lightly when gauze. See your doctor soon as you can. Best to you!|`|5cSD8mcZaa	Do not attempt at home. Keep finger covered, preferably use gloves when cooking.

Most of the best poets grew up with struggles which made it easy for them to write, take Langston Hughes for example. He's a phenomenal poet and grew up with some pretty bad stuff. I can't promise everything will be better, but when you read your writing and you're in a good mood, you're gonna be so proud of yourself ;) Its a great way to satisfy yourself and its completely safe, the use of similes, metaphors and paragraph gives the reader a great way of your thoughts and feelings.|`|RdZAC2Pjaa	well, it seems to me that you care too much of what people think of you. i used to be the same exact way. but try not to let it beat you up so bad. your the only person that can control what you believe and what you dont. everytime someone puts you down, try to tell yourself that they are wrong.. and they are insecure about themselves so they take it out on you. trust mee.. it doesnt help right away.. but it definately helps, it just takes time and you nedd to want it to happen too.<br>  <br>  i REALLY hope this helps.(:|`|AA11707163	read this book ! the power of positive thinking ! i picked it up at a young age ! and its exercises still guide me today ! and helped change my life ! finish the entire book and practce what it teaches ! your life will change !|`|ArvEdl3paa	I felt like that last year a lot. I was feeling horrible about myself compared to my two best friends.They were perfect to me and I was no where near them. I was failing math as well at that time and barely getting my grades up. Grades were a huge issue to me, and also, what made things worse was that I had a crush on a teacher and it was that knowing feeling that I'll never ever get him that just made me feel so much worse.<br>  <br>  What I did was do things for myself that made me happy. i joined the Softball team, and it kept me away from home for an extra 3-4 hours or so, cuz at that time, my parents and I weren't on good terms. And I exercised more, cuz it made me feel better about myself and I'd stay in my room and make bracelets and necklaces and it just made me feel good. And mainly, as lame as this sounds, I started a journal. I wouldn't call it a diary. I didn't record what happened everyday. I'd most open the book, date it, and just write out exactly how I feel. When I looked back on that page, I might not known what I was talking about, but I know that helped.<br>  <br>  I hope this somewhat helps you and think positive, even if no on is complimenting you for the changes you make, you at least feel better about it.|`|W6ZBPsVSaa	I so get what your saying so much of what your going through i once did.

If you have reinjured your foot, then ice is okay. If it is an old injury, elevate your foot and use warm compresses. It is okay to alternate with cold, but cold will only make you colder. It will not help your foot.<br>  <br>  Wear low heels, no higher than two inches, and your feet should be fine. If you feel wobbly, at all, better to be safe than sorry and forget the heels.|`|kyTU7yEbaa	NEVER put heat on a sprained ankle! What is the deal with your doc? I suggest getting a 2nd opinion and an x-ray. In the meantime, ice is best. RICE- Rest, Ice, Compression and Elevation. Good luck!
T8bQHOcQaa	Listen to the doctor, I know it can be hard (haha no pun intended). Masturbating should only be done 2-3 times a week. I doubt you've permanently damaged your penis, but just try and lay off a bit. If you find yourself getting aroused, then go and do something else, or think of something which will in no way turn you on! It'll only get worse if you don't leave it for a bit...|`|YbBHo9xDaa	You should be okay<br>  Don't worry too much<br>  Maybe just cut down? I know it'd be hard (wink)<br>  But, cut down slowly, and see if the pains reduce.<br>  Good luck,|`|TsjqzanQaa	I think that you're probably masturbating with too much force.<br>  <br>  If you're circumcised, then you have reduced penile sensitivity, and it might require more than the usual stimulation for you to achieve orgasm.<br>  <br>  I lacked sexual sensitivity because of the damage inflicted on me by circumcision.<br>  <br>  I restored my foreskin, which is a long process, and difficult, but the results are well worth it.   Masturbation and sex are both 1000 times better with a foreskin, the way that nature intended.<br>  <br>  My sensitivity has vastly improved and increased, together with the intensity of orgasm.<br>  <br>  If you are circumcised, and masturbating without a lubricant, then you are damaging your penis and lowering your sexual sensitivity.<br>  <br>  Circumcision keratinizes the penis and the friction from masturbating without lubricant will increase the keratinization and make it necessary to use much more friction and force to achieve orgasm.<br>  <br>  Could this possibly be a part of your problem?<br>  <br>  I think that the frequency of masturbation is irrelevant, but the rough method you use is the heart of the problem.<br>  <br>  At the age of 31, you're lucky to have a good, strong libido.        <br>  <br>  <br>  The best of luck to you.|`|76845aa2d3f727081f73b3db267a28b8aa	masturbation is normal and healthy,but only you know if you are over doing yourself.|`|GtalVPNjaa	did the doctor ask you to demonstrate your technique ?

EZ1cPPvkaa	The fact that your high lasted as long as a typical acid trip is a good indication that there was something else present besides THC.  It's possible that some of the effects of a large amount of weed would resemble that of LSD, such as the time distortion, excessive laughing, etc. But the overall experience of the two drugs are nowhere similar, regardless of amount.  It is very likely that the cannabis was laced with LSD or something else.|`|Ve65q3bZaa	It is very unlikely that the cannabis was "laced" with something else simply because that does not happen.  Putting LSD on pot would not give you any effects, unless you ate the pot.  On the same note, it is highly unlikely that you were slipped drugs as well.  You just were not used to the altered concsiousness that marijauna provides, and equated it with LSD.  I put money it was just the pot, and the fact that it is your first time, and the amount smoked.|`|dmsLrFQnaa	No, it is not. LSD and THC affect the brain in much different ways.<br>  <br>  It's unheard of that any amount of weed smoked in a single setting could last as long and as strong as a trip from LSD-25 (which is generally several hours in length, includes strong visual distortions, ego loss, etc). <br>  <br>  Perhaps what you smoked was not just cannabis, but with that said, I highly doubt you felt anything near the level of an acid trip.|`|URGLdPABaa	good pot or bad acid|`|hmsMpECkaa	Probably . . . lol<br>  But, if you have done acid, you know the difference.|`|UUB398aqaa	absolutely not.  weed can not do that and also can not be laced with LSD because LSD can not be smoked.  either you're completely full of **** or completely exaggerating every aspect of the high

JIrud5INaa	I have epilepsy I am 22 and have had it since I was 14. I have Grand Mal and Petit Mal. I guess I'm not sure of this "blind" thing you are talking about. I have had many Grand Mal's and hundreds of Petit Mal's. Abusing sleeping pills can actually make them worse and bring on more of them. Grand Mal seizures you aren't awake for, unconsciousness takes place, I know I've had my fair share! They have never been able to find a cause or why I have them I just do. You though are lucky enough to get "auras" I get nothing I never know when they are going to happen. The big thing though is that you shouldn't abuse sleeping pills. Yeah it sucks I know I've had my license suspended three times because of it. No ones perfect its a part of life, I don't let it bother me I just live my life sure its a pain sometimes with the yearly check ups and what not but I wouldnt want to change my life at all right now this is the life I've had for the last 8 years and I'm totally fine with it! I now live on my own, have a great boyfriend, have a great job, going to the local tech. school for nursing. <br>  <br>  I am on Lamictal and Zonegran|`|ad09a262eea23aed99f3309da57c67c5aa	You need to talk to your doctor.  You could be having side effects from the medications.  I'm also epileptic with partial complex seizures which are not very much fun.  I also am bipolar possibly from the seizures so I understand what you are going through.  Talk to your neurologist as the sleeping pills especially seroquel can be causing the weird seizure activity.|`|ppVT5QC7aa	Think of all the good things, God put you here for a reason.

Begin, on this first occasion, only, by holding your breath for 5, or 10 seconds: this will give you the confidence to realise that YOU CAN CONTROL YOUR BREATHING, but not pass out, or die (your autonomic nervous system resumes breathing, if you become unconscious).  Advice, from a clinical psychologist is to breathe in to the count of 3: (one thousand one; one thousand two; one thousand three) each takes around a second to say to yourself, in your mind. Then breathe out to the count of 3. Repeat, until it begins to take effect. Understand panic attacks, and what triggers them, in your life (if it is unresolved anxiety, or stress, see sections 6, [page N first] or 42, [page i first] respectively). An alternative is psychotherapy, to address its fundamental cause, which is usually anxiety; read section 1, and examine the <a href="http://1-800-therapist.com/" rel="nofollow">http://1-800-therapist.com/</a> & <a href="http://www.metanoia.org/choose/" rel="nofollow">http://www.metanoia.org/choose/</a> websites, and use the locators to find a therapist, (and phone book, but only if necessary). I used to suffer from panic attacks, until I questioned what had changed in my life, at, or just before that time, to trigger them, which is enough for some people. <br>  <br>  Visualise as vividly as possible, a large, red, flashing, "STOP!" sign, and/or possibly a stern faced person wagging an index finger at you in a negative manner, then say to yourself as forcefully as you can, even aloud in a big voice, if alone: "I know this tactic: GO AWAY FOR A WHILE !!!" You may want to us either: "ruse", "ploy", "game", or "trick", instead of "tactic". It usually takes 30 - 40 repetitions, for most people, to establish a new habit. I also suggest that you learn, then practise the controlled breathing technique, until competent, then employ it, at the very first sign of a panic attack. Practice one of the relaxation methods in sections 11, 2, 2c, or 2i, daily, and when needed. Also, give the EFT a good tryout, to see if it helps you. There is also a version for use in public places, (if you like, you can claim to have a headache, as you massage/lightly tap your temples, but you would then be restricted to subvocalising - saying it to yourself in your mind). Sections 53, and 2, 2.q and 2.o at <a href="http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris" rel="nofollow">http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris</a> also refer: "Even though I sometimes suffer from panic attacks, I deeply and completely accept myself." Note: the controlled breathing only helps with the symptoms (as do medications/herbal remedies): you need to address the underlying cause, which requires some form of therapy, and Cognitive Behavio(u)ral Therapy has been shown to be effective. Imagine that the cause of your panic; your anxieties, fears, your self doubts, self recriminations, all the agonizing "I'm-so-Stupids"; every painful "I-can't-do-it" are huge raging, hurtful bulls snorting and charging at you. <br>  <br>  You see them coming at you and you hold out your red matador's cape at arms length and simply let them charge right by. Every time they come at you, hold out your arm with the red cape and let them rage and snort and go right on past. Because many people can't access/afford professional therapy, I include the EFT, and EMDR variant for them to try, free of charge (professional is best). Cognitive Behavio(u)ral Therapy is generally available in most areas, but EMDR (see section 33) may well be worth trying, and is becoming more widespread. A variant of Eye Movement Desensitisation & Reprocessing therapy, which has been used successfully for those people suffering from anxiety: it is easily learned, quick to use, yet can be very effective, is on page N, of section 6, and I use it before the relaxation techniques, because I have found that it makes them quicker to employ, and more effective. If you are fairly suggestible, (40% of people are) you could also try professional hypnotherapy, or the searchbar at: www.hypnosisdownloads.com/ "panic attacks" orwww.asktheinternettherapist.com/h... Stop Panic Attacks - CD - MP3, or NeuroLinguistic Programming (Google this, or try Wikipedia.org).|`|gkqmrIAGaa	By abusing your drugs you are probably causing more brain activity that causes the seizures. If you are having seizures despite the medication you need to see your doctor for another medication that will stop the seizures. This is so very, very dangerous what you are doing to yourself. A seizure in your sleep without anybody to help you can result in death. I don't by any means want to scare you but to make you think about what you are doing. You have to talk to your mom or go to your doctor yourself. You have to be completely honest with him and let him know which medications you are abusing and how much you are taking. He can not only change your antiseizure medication but help you to slowly withdraw from the abuse of your medications. Please have courage and know that your doctor has seen and hear everything and you have nothing to be ashamed or embarrassed about. He is there to help you. You have to get help or you may not be around to get help. Please, Please do this. There are people who love you and would be destroyed for life if anything happened to you. I care!!!!  If you are feeling suicidal there are two numbers that you can call that are staffed by professionals who can help you right now. One is 1-800-273-talk and 1-800-suicide they really will help you. Also there is a site you can read that was written by someone who felt just like you do and wanted to give up it is a wonderful eye opening read. <a href="http://www.metanoia.org./suicide/" rel="nofollow">http://www.metanoia.org./suicide/</a>  Would you please read it if not for yourself than for all of the people who love you.

Maybe lift weights or walk to burn calories and firm up. But PLEASE do not throw your food up. My BFF is bulimic and she is not even skinny. Her throat is always sore from all the acid and she has digestion problems. Plus she is a basketcase...always worrying about herself.

To make sure you are comfortable but appropriate wear a black t-shirt that is loose and does not hug your middle as well as still provides coverage when you raise your arms. If you have any definition in your arms you may also try a black sleeveless, non-hugging shirt because when you feel like you look good it is clinically proven you will work out harder. Wear black gym shorts or even black or dark colored workout pants (you can get sweatpants or workout pants even at target and walmart). Wearing black pants will also keep you from getting embarrassed if your behind tends to do this as well.<br>  <br>  Do not wear your mowing the lawn tennis shoes that are gross. Buy a well fitting pair for the gym as well as breathable socks (can get at Walmart) that are designed for men to allow air to pass through which helps with sweat and comfort as well as being antimicrobial.<br>  <br>  Lastly wear boxer briefs so you still get air flow in needed areas while having coverage (should you choose to wear shorts) but also have support.|`|aXnVFFUkaa	just 3/4 shorts and a t shirt a baggy one

OjSBaXgoaa	Hey there, sweetie.  Although the internet is a fantastic place to learn about things, using it to try to find out whether you might be bipolar (or have something going on with you) is like calling up the Emergency Room when you have a cut on your arm, and asking over the phone if you need stitches!  I've taken some of those online mental health quizzes, too, more often for depression, and yes, with self-reporting, I usually come off depressed according to the site...but then I look at the questions....kinda leading you on, you know?  <br>  <br>  It's really good that you're looking and thinking and learning, but please don't try to diagnose yourself with anything (even the flu!) using the internet.<br>  <br>  That aside, if you do have concerns, definitely talk to someone in a position to help.  Are you due for a regular medical check up anytime soon?  If so, sometimes a talk with your doctor can get you hooked up with any testing or help you might need.  (Also, sometimes symptoms are due to a medical problem that he/she could treat.)<br>  <br>  Now me, I'm the mom of a teen daughter, and much of what you are saying sounds a lot like what she's going through.  Are you a creative, smart person?  (It sounds so, in the way you write.)  I believe that smart and creative people often "feel" the world more.  (That's just a belief of mine.)  And you mentioned comparing moods with your friends.  Well, that's so impossible to do, as there are no standards for experience of emotions.  It's good you're talking and thinking about things.  Realize that 15 is a tweaky age -- you're almost an adult, you've got amazing amounts of pressure on you with school, sports (or whatever your "extra" thing is), friends...people are asking you what you want to do when you finish high school.  Honey, you couldn't pay me to be a teenager again.<br>  <br>  So, do you have bipolar II?  Gosh, hold your head toward the computer screen and I'll let you know [bad joke].  The short answer -- none of us here can give you the answer.  But realize that life, especially for teens, can be a roller coaster.  Realize, too, that parents and professionals are there for you.  Use the resources that are out there.<br>  <br>  Important -- if you have ANY inclination that you might want to hurt yourself, get help IMMEDIATELY...either talk to a parent (we parents really do care, and want to listen and help!) or get hold of a professional.  <br>  <br>  Hang in there, little miss a.  Welcome to life.  Enjoy the ride.|`|3fd2288554aaf55a30c81ff30a54bba2aa	The hyperactivity does sound really characteristic of bipolar. When I am manic, I can't stand being in bed, wasting time, and want to get up at 2 AM to repaint the kitchen, or work on my Important Work, whatever that is at the moment. In adults, the moods usually last weeks to months, but for kids, bipolar presents somewhat differently.<br>  <br>  It sounds a lot like bipolar to me. You should see a doctor about it. Bipolar usually gets worse as you get older, so you will need treatment if you have it.  I was still functional when I was your age, at age 16, I attempted suicide, in college, I started flunking classes right and left, and at age 28, I was totally disabled and have not been able to hold down a job since.  Treatments haven't worked for me, but that is rare, and they almost certainly will work for you. If you've had a good life so far (no serious emotional or sexual abuse) and you get treatment, you will probably do pretty well with the bipolar disorder, and it will be like managing any other chronic medical condition.<br>  <br>  I will say when I was your age, the depressions were very severe, and I thought about suicide a lot, but I don't know if bipolar has to start that way - I was sexually abused, so it is impossible for me to know when the abuse symptoms started to morph into bipolar disorder.<br>  <br>  Talk to your mom or dad about it. If you are more moody than normal, they will have noticed it, probably, and will be glad you want to talk about it. a lot of times parents don't know how to talk to their kids about this stuff & then don't bring it up and the kid doesn't talk about it. Then they just get sicker and sicker and sicker.  So please talk to a parent about this.|`|PgAtUe2taa	you're bipolar|`|aUCrx2nbaa	Im bipolar and yep it sounds like you are too....things will be ok, you sound s,mart and self aware im sure you will cope just fine. best of luck|`|O5Zr5cWqaa	Yeah, That just about describes me, except im a guy, Its not very fun though.. You should take medicine for it, I dont, But who cares ya know? Sometimes it gets REALLY REALLY bad, but i just wait it out, terrible feelings sometimes too, Im a bad person, but you shouldnt be, take medicine and tell me how it works, So then ill take it if it works good for you XD|`|ee8de852bbfc3404d7247997922499b7aa	Have you discussed this with your parents. That is the first thing I would recommend. If you feel you cant talk to them, then maybe talk to the counselor at school. The symptoms are similar, but it could be that your hormones are doing this. I really would suggest going to your parents and the school counselor with this, then go from there. Best of luck.

Qxh1kPLfaa	The symptoms of celiac, gluten intolerance and wheat allergies can all be very similar.  Sadly since each of them are different issues, you would have to undergo different testing procedures to know for sure which and how many you have.  It is quite possible to have all at the same time too.<br>  <br>  You can also have both lactose intolerance and milk allergies.  Some even say that the failure to treat one creates the other (found in the book "Milk is Not for Every Body").|`|TjWymKRXaa	celiac disease means you are allergic to wheat. you need to visit  www.savorypalate.com    did you know that iodized salt has dextrose in it? dextrose is a wheat sugar.|`|51DIytYSaa	Hi MaluLani,<br>   <br>  Signs of an allergy usually occur within a few minutes up <br>   to 2-3 hours.  Allergy can show up as a skin reaction, <br>   congestion, stomach pain,etc.  If it is severe, and <br>   anaphylactic, it can cause the throat to swell and make it <br>   hard to breathe. (a medical emergency requiring  immediate <br>   medical attention).  In an allergy the immune system  makes<br>   IGE   antibodies.  The milk allergy would also be expressed <br>   as  IGE antibodies, and happen in a short time.<br>  <br>   If you have gluten sensitivity, the reaction could happen in<br>   a couple of  hours or even days later.  The immune system<br>   will react  with IGA  and/ or IGG antibodies, and it wouldn't be anaphylactic.   <br>   Constipation or diarrhea,  itchy rash, and aches are pretty <br>   common  with gluten reactions.  Also headaches and being<br>   very tired. Arthritis  has been associated with celiac disease,<br>   and   the  inflammation a  gluten sensitivity can cause  can <br>   affect  joints, muscles, skin, and  even the brain.<br>  <br>   People with untreated celiac disease usually are lactose<br>   intolerant  because the tips of the intestinal villi are the first <br>   part to erode away, and that is where the lactase enzyme is  <br>   supposed to be produced<br>  . <br>   So the intestinal damage makes you unable to digest the<br>   milk until you have been gluten free and healed long enough<br>   to grow the tips of the villi back and make lactase again. <br>  <br>   Also, a large percentage of people who have celiac, which<br>   is an  immune reaction to gluten, also have an immune reaction <br>   to  casein,  the protein in milk.<br>  <br>   So if your reaction comes on over several hours it is more <br>   likely to be gluten related than a true wheat allergy.  A wheat  <br>   antibody test for IGE would tell you for sure though.<br>  <br>   Taking benadryl helps me  a little if I get gluten accidentally <br>   and get  a  rash.<br>  <br>   Hope this helps.<br>  <br>  Kathy

01Mu3wUeaa	Norwalk virus is nasty virus that creeps up on you when you least expect it.<br>  <br>  <br>  No, unless he has vomited BEFORE he kissed her, she will not get sick.However, if she was close to him when he vomited, she could have ingested the contaminated vomit particles and could potentially get sick (although there have been many people who were close to vomiting people and have not gotten sick)<br>  <br>  <br>  Here are prevention tips:<br>  <br>  Norwalk virus<br>  (Just remember that hand sanitizers will not kill this virus.House hold cleaners such as Lysol will also not kill you.You must use bleach.)<br>  <br>  The Norwalk virus causes viral Gastroenteritis which is known as the nasty 24 hour bug that causes explosive and sudden diarrhea and projectile vomiting.Usually non life threating but can cause complications in the very young,elderly and those with compromised immune systems.<br>  <br>  PREVENTION-Wash your hands before preparing food/eating food and most importantly, TOUCHING YOUR MOUTH/NOSE/EYES.<br>  <br>  The ONLY way to become infected with this virus is if you ingest the contaminated fecal/vomit particles through your eyes,nose and mouth.<br>  <br>  It is impossible to "breathe" in the virus BUT possible to become infected by breathing in aerosol "spray" droplets from someone vomiting right next to you.(the droplets settle within minuted but can still infect someone until cleaned with bleach)<br>  <br>  Even if your whole family breaks out with this virus, you can prevent it by washing your hands for at least 15-20 seconds with warm water and soap.Remember that you are not killing the virus, you are washing it down the drain even if you use an antibacterial soap (which only kills bacteria, not viruses) hand sanitizers are also not successful in killing the virus.<br>  <br>  If a member of your family comes down with the virus, let them know to wash their hands AFTER a bowel movement and vomiting.<br>  <br>  To clean infected areas, clean with BLEACH.Clean bathrooms (all infected areas) with a bleach solution as soon as possible and be sure to prevent cross contamination and wash your hands afterwards.Especially children! wipe down all commonly touched objects like door knobs, faucet handles, light switches, toilet flushers etc.<br>  <br>  People are STILL contagious even after 24 hours after their symptoms settle down so it is always important to wash your hands after the rest room (which you should do anyways!)<br>  <br>  The key to staying Norwalk virus free is to keep sanitary.Wash your hands after using the bathroom...you could prevent other peoples misery as well as yours!!<br>  <br>  TIPS:Do not share any cups/plates/utensils with an infected person and be sure to wash in a bleach solution to prevent cross contamination with the rest of your family.|`|0kWkX8yiaa	yes, she probably has it if he threw up minutes after kissing her. it usually takes about 30 hours to kick in.. so she might want to take it easy tomorrow =/|`|FEAeTMnfaa	It depends whether he has a stomach virus or if he's sick because of food poisoning.  If he has a stomach virus, there's a very good chance he gave it to your friend.  However, he probably gave it to her before he kissed her ... stomach viruses are terribly contagious.  <br>  <br>  She won't know unless she starts feeling sick, though, so my suggestion is that she tries to relax.  If she starts to get sick, she should try and stay hydrated and eat bland food like rice, dry toast, and things like that.<br>  <br>  Hope everyone feels better!|`|b7e5b1319fec08a4df1b67464d59e2f1aa	You can get sick from anywhere.  It depends on your immune system.|`|JbKPj42Uaa	well it depends <br>  wen he kissed her <br>  if it was at least 3 days b4 he got it most likely yes she has it
mqXyDTwwaa	Body cleansing and detoxification have been referred to as an elaborate hoax used by con artists to cure nonexistent illnesses. Most doctors contend that the 'toxins' in question do not even exist. In response, alternative medicine proponents frequently cite heavy metals or pesticides as the source of toxification, however no evidence exists that detoxification approaches have a measurable effect on these or any other chemical levels. Medical experts state that body cleansing is unnecessary as the human body is naturally capable of maintaining itself, with several organs dedicated to cleansing the blood and gut.<br>  <br>  Professor Alan Boobis OBE, Toxicologist, Division of Medicine, Imperial College London states that "The body’s own detoxification systems are remarkably sophisticated and versatile. They have to be, as the natural environment that we evolved in is hostile. It is remarkable that people are prepared to risk seriously disrupting these systems with unproven ‘detox’ diets, which could well do more harm than good."<br>  <br>  Highly restrictive detox diets such as Water fasting or the Master Cleanse are not the safest form of weight loss. These diets, if done improperly or for too long, may result in nutrient deficiencies. Of particular concern is lack of protein, which may result in wasting of muscle tissue, due to insufficient amino acids for repair. With less lean muscle tissue, the body's metabolic needs decrease, which hampers weight loss efforts unless calories are lessened further in the diet.<br>  <br>  Finally, while many testimonial and anecdotal accounts exist of health improvements following a "detox", there is a severe lack of quantitative data. And some changes recommended in certain "detox" lifestyles are also found in mainstream medical advice (such as consuming a diet high in fruits and vegetables). These changes can often produce beneficial effects in and of themselves, and it is accordingly difficult to separate these effects from those caused by the more controversial detoxification recommendations.|`|akHYRh5Raa	the best detox is to eat healthy to keep your liver and kidney in good working order because they are the organs that filter (detox) the blood!!!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  was on bbc news a few weeks ago all those detox products are boguss fakes!
wa3AvezGaa	Yes, this is it, the brown stuff is just old blood|`|4WxCrM0Laa	i would say that counts|`|4puOUmLTaa	Yeah, that's definitely something. It honestly takes a few months for you to get regular, especially at your age.

lDSUQyvIaa	There really isnt a tea that does that. Tea in general is better for you than soda or coffee so the virtue of drinking it may help in losing weight but drinking a specific kind of tea isnt going to do much for your weight unless you couple it with a good diet and working out.
X453cUVFaa	Same thing happened to me and i was a wreck, turned out to be nothing just a cyst and i have a really bad family history of breast cancer. they told me that if it feels rubbery and moves it is usually nothing to worry about.. i know its hard but try to relax, ul get through this.|`|WnbutJsuaa	i'm not a doctor, i just wanna tell u not to worry and that whatever it is you are going to be fine! pleeease e-mail me telling how it turns out! i'm worried about u and will keep my fingers crossed, try not to think about it so much,but i know it's hard<br>  <br>  e-mail me if u wanna talk or need someone to distract u, i can tell u my life story if u want or something... lol
aCDWwsisaa	You are young enough that statistically it is unlikely to be a malignant tumor...that doesn't mean it isn't, just that there are a lot of other things it is FAR more likely to be.<br>  <br>  Of course you are scared, but you really don't need to be, even if it's the worst thing it might be, they can fix it...it might not be fun, but there's no reason to be scared...<br>  <br>  (Think about it, if the doctor thought you were in any immediate danger, would she have had you wait for two weeks for a scan?)<br>  <br>  Best wishes & good luck....you'll be fine!|`|FicyC2TXaa	Your doctor is, quite rightly, being cautious; she doesn't think it's breast cancer.<br>  <br>  Many doctors don't take the concerns of young women seriously when it comes to breast health, because breast cancer in young women is so rare. Be glad you have such a good doctor.<br>  <br>  Fewer than 0.1% of people diagnosed with breast cancer are under 30, so your chances are very, very low indeed.<br>  <br>  Most breast lumps, even in women over 50 (who account for 80% of those diagnosed) aren't cancerous.<br>  <br>  Try not to worry (easy said, I know - waiting is hell); all the indications are that it isn't cancer and your doctor is erring on the side of caution.|`|XK0kZ8Iiaa	Dont panic!  Caffeine can cause lumps(fibrocystic) If you consume a lot of caffeine.  I know what you mean though about not wanting to wait. I had a lymph node like that and I said no way am I waiting-lets see about it now.  It was fine.  Hopefully yours will be too!
3dlBt6vaaa	Are you truly allergic, meaning rash hives throat swelling? If you have those types of reactions to codeine I would not take any codone. If codeine makes you sick to your stomach, then you are sensitve but not allergic. In that case you can take codone, but might have same problems..|`|sw2R5A9iaa	possibly -stick to advil/tylenol/alleve.  narcs just cover pain, they don't treat it.
BpXbNjEpaa	You can.  TUMS neutralizes acid, while Prilosec inhibits the production of as much acid.  It's perfectly safe to take both.|`|8dff1db77e286db113459b3b54cdef2daa	They are two different items and they are safe together. Tums is an antacid that coats the stomach.  Prilosec causes the decrease of acid production.
SLSX6QQsaa	Clairitin and Zyrtec, as well as Allegra for that matter were all prescription not too long ago. I use to pay big bucks without insurance to get it.  I don't take any of the "D" versions of any of these drugs because in my experience the D might as well stand for Drowsy.  Clairtin works well for me when it's just minor allergies, but when I have a full blown hayfever, the only hope is Zyrtec.  I end up with a sinus infection if I don't take it.  I like how it works better but it makes me soooooo tired.  Too tired to work or do anything, but its better tired than really sick.  So every August or September I am stuck on Zyrtec.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	use what works -see your doctor if the OTC meds are working.
ce9d609b58380ee151ad9021694da085aa	There are so many diets out there.  Main thing to focus is on in staying away from white and eating 6-8 SMALL meals a day.<br>  <br>  No rice, potato, sugar or flour. And if you can't.. minimize it A LOT!   I substitute rice by making caulirice.  Buy cauliflower, grate it on a cheese grater, saute in a fry pan with a little olive oil, garlic, salt & pepper.  It's great!  You can do the same with cauliflower to make Mashed Potato alternatives as well. <br>  <br>  Increase vegetables.  Dark leafy greens are almost a free food and can be eaten all the time.   Cucembers, jicama, celery and kale are great crunchy items.<br>  <br>  Don't drink juice.  Opt to eat the fruit instead.  But remember that fruit is high in calories.   And although incredibly good for you, too much is still bad.<br>  <br>  Lowfat meats.. in your case, chicken is great.  Don't eat the skin or have it deep fried.  It is very important you eat protein!  Fish and skinless chicken are GREAT options!   Also string cheese is a great mid day snack in between your main meals.  Protein stays in your body longer causing you to stay ful longer.  And it's low in calories.<br>  <br>  Snack on low carb yogurt and frozen berries as a sweet snack. Or make a shake with them by blending in a bullet or blender with some water.<br>  <br>  In shell peanuts are great for that salty craving.  The peanuts act as a protein and the shell keeps you from eating a lot of them.  Because too many is bad.  Actually.. too much of anything is bad.  Good rule of thumb.<br>  <br>  Drink lots of water and stay away from sugary sodas, juices and drinks.  Add lemon, lime, orange or cucumbers to flavor your water.<br>  <br>  Stay away from fast food!!!  Not only is it just bad!.. it's high calories, fat and sodium or salt, which makes you retain water.  We all eat out, and it's hard.. but there is always some healthy alternative.  If you HAVE to have the hamburger.. take off the bun and wrap it in lettuce or skip the fries all together.  Be sure to eat slow and stop eating when you think you are full.    <br>  <br>  Whatever you do.. DON'T Skip Meals!  You are only doing bad.  Your body thinks it's going into starvation so it holds onto everything it gets.  Your metabolism slows down so that you use less energy.  Food = Energy.  No food.  No energy.  No energy.. well obviously you get tired, slow, sluggish.. but your body more slows down to keep you alive and uses your fat storage as energy.  Which is great!... for cavemen in the winter time that don't know when their next meal will be.  But unfortunately, these days.. we know that another meal will follow shortly.  <br>  <br>  Everytime you eat, your body says.. "Oh.. fuel!"  And it takes the food and disperses it to all the appropriate places in your body. When you have consumed too much of any food, your body says.. "Uh... what do I do with this?  Everything here is taken care of".  So it throws it in to your bodies "Junk drawer" or fat cells.  If you don't use all that extra stored energy, ie.. fat, it will stay on you.  <br>  <br>  So...  Learn to read the labels on everything you eat.  High sugar or carbs generally means high  calories.. and they are not the good kind.  Which all will result in FAT.<br>  <br>  Get out and move your body everyday.  And it doesn't have to be an hour straight at the gym.  Yeah, that's great if you can.. but if you have to break it up in 6 ten minute sessions.. that's fine too.  Walk the dog, vacuum, make your bed, dance to commercials, anything..  JUST MOVE!  It's great for your body and your mind.  And everyday, change it up and increase when you can.<br>  <br>  Sorry to go on so long.   I was over weight all my life and never could lose weight or keep it off.  I get it now.   It makes sense.  And I wanted to share it.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!!|`|f3LrMhqWaa	fruit and veg!!don't eat so much white bread, butter, etc. also, don't go crazy with exercise, do swimming or do what i do and go for a fast walk every day for an hour!!!oh and you need meat in your diet for iron levels!!|`|F8EnH6JQaa	Fruits and Veggies<br>  <br>  Eat more plants and keep away from stuff that was made in plants.<br>  don't eat anything that comes in a can, box or package...THEY HAVE ADDITIVES IN THEM THAT MAKE YOU ADDICTED TO THE FOOD<br>  If man made it, don't eat it<br>  <br>  Stay away from FAST FOOD<br>  <br>  Walk your dog, or walk a friends dog<br>  <br>  Don't think of it as a diet, but think of it as a lifestyle change<br>  <br>  I have lost 25.5 pounds in 2 months, drink lots of water.

hSOEgpPNaa	There is a layer of fat covering your abs and that's why you can't see them.  You have to diet strictly and do cardio to lose that fat.
Drnpe4T5aa	I had my gallbladder removed because I had several really large stones, and one of them got lodged in the opening and it almost burst.<br>  <br>  My symptom was: pain - like equivilant to childbirth, only in my upper stomach area, sort of right under my right ribcage - that did not get better regardless of how I was sitting or laying.   I felt like I had the worst case of tummy flu *ever* coming on, but just couldn't throw up.  <br>  <br>  Hopefully this is not what has been happening to you repeatedly.  Once is bad enough.  Can't imagine having it happen multiple times...<br>  <br>  Good luck to you.  :)
4GNNOQeLaa	Take a shower and use some mild soap to help wash off the oil.  Take some oral Benadryl or apply some Benadryl cream, (if you like generic use Diphenhydramine) but don't take oral med and apply cream, just one or the other.  You can take Benadryl (diphenhydramine) every 4 to 6 hours and this should help with the itching and any rash or bumps you may have on your skin.  Warning: benadryl may cause some drowsiness but its the best thing over-the-counter for allergic reactions that are not anaphylactic in nature.  If you start to feel your airways closing, or difficulty breathing, seek medical attention because this may be a sign of a more serious allergic reaction to the oil.|`|qOpAOt82aa	best thing to do is shower and use dial anti-bacterial soap. then dont use it again, and read whats in it. find out if your illergic to it|`|5cSD8mcZaa	Take a benadryl and a shower--in that order.
AA10766729	Certainly go and get a full checkup, but many doctors will consider a cycle normal as long as it is consistently between 19 and 40 days (consistently meaning that this is the length for every cycle) ....so some doctors would consider your cycle within normal parameters still.|`|G4ZIETRKaa	it can be.

GMcKAWWuaa	well I work in an optical center. Burning eyes is probley caused by the solution you are useing. All in one solutions tend to make your eyes red and itchy and burn. A lot of people are allergic to them. The best cleaner out there is called CLEAR CARE. You have to only use the contact case provided with the bottle. The solution is hydrogen peroxide based. The special case they give you will neutralize the peroxide. When you remove the lens after an overnight soak you should rinse with a themerisal free saline solution . Try to by the kind found in aresol cans.  Dont ever by generic no rub all in one contact cleaner. It will really make her eyes sore.<br>  <br>  I would try the Clear Care cleaning solution. Make sure she never puts it in her eye. Always rinse with saline after use.. The clear care will burn her eyes very badly.  For now I would have her not wear the lens for a few days . Use natural tears to comfort the eye. You can by them in the contact lens isle.  If it continues it could be the CLS are just a bad fit. Make sure docter checks to be sure the CLs fit her eye right and that she has not scratched her eye. Usually thats pretty painful . My best guess. Try the suggested solution.|`|mg0CEcTPaa	Buy a different contact solution, maybe she is allergic or the solution isn;t just up to standard.|`|ldpDzaolaa	She might be allergic to the Thimerasol (mercury derivative) in the contact lens solution. it's listed and spelled under numerous names. can try a preservative free solution, but have to be very careful with handwashing. If the doc won't help you, ask what will he help you with? and if nothing, there is always the BBB and the licensing bureau which sound like a good option to me. look up thimerasol on line for different spellings/products, we knew it as Mercurochrome,the red liquid when we were kids, it's used in cosmetics and numerous ear , nose and throat meds. it's the controversy  in vaccines/autism with no merit. I'm skin positive allergic to it, but have had it injected while in the military for flu vaccines when mandatory, can't say it did anything, but I've avoided it. It's not in L'Oreal Voluminous mascara. I have a list of what it's in and not, It's in Vicks 4 way sinus spray caused a severe asthma flare. if sx continue, see an allergist and stay away from that contact lens doc. and tell them so.|`|772af993bfb42f2f2e74902cb7eb1054aa	don't touch jalepeno peppers without wearing gloves and then try to put in your contacts for the next several days.

MSqE9rbDaa	You said you have had discharge for 6 months to a year and a half? You don't know? Well at most it should take another year then, because usually a period comes 6 months - a year and a half after discharge, I think. So really, it COULD be any day now. But best not to worry. Really. Plus, it IS nice to know when it's coming and you can say that you have it, but in the end, it really is not fun at all... Well, good luck... And in the near future... Welcome to womanhood! :)|`|QJHE3z1raa	stop freaking asking.<br>  you will get it when you get it.<br>  <br>  all you want to see is that your going to get it which no one knows for sure<br>  <br>  <br>  STTTTTTTOOOOOOOOOP!|`|5Ra5xbziaa	it should be|`|FNeCDm3raa	No one can tell you.<br>  <br>  Best not to worry about it at all.<br>  <br>  I don't get the obsession.<br>  <br>  I've had a period for 10 years now, and I never recalled thinking about it before it happened. Not once. It was a big shock.<br>  <br>  It will happen, and thinking about it and stressing, delays it more.........<br>  <br>  Really, a period is not fun.|`|IlweVgxhaa	Honestly, you can't really tell ahead of time. Cramping, mood swings, and discharge (usually all three) mean its coming. But not necessarily SOON. I know it sounds like bs but we're all different and you can't really say for sure. Its not like its an exact science. If you're worried then when you go out of the house put a pad in your bag just in case. Trust me though, you really don't want it.|`|16bWGB14aa	Every girl is different and it could happen any day now or it might not happen for a couple of years but it sounds like it will be with in the next year.

After the final stages of intercourse have taken place,  things tend to get boring.   That is where Flud comes in.   By grasping it with your palms, you can shape it into a sort of bouncy ball, and, presto!   The fun ensues.  You and your partner now have a reason to still hang out after you've bumped the uglies.  However, i should warn you that if you get flud in your eyes, your penis will shrivel to the size of a burnt cashew.|`|Mgg5vcdOaa	If you've got more than one hole in your penis and green stuff is coming out - I hate to tell you but it sounds like an infection has eaten it's way through your dillywhacker and you need to see a doctor.

8GOfmyQfaa	to answer your question i should know your age. decreased vision suddenly in one eye with no pain can be caused by some disease. if you are male 30-50 y.o it might be central serous chorioretinopathy. if you older than 50 it migh caused by CRVO (central retinal vein acclusion) or CRAO (central retinal aretry occlusion), vitreous bleeding.|`|JE2BSt48aa	i have the exact same thing! i went to a specialist and he said i have a scar on the inside of my eye on the retina which means its all blurry in the middle of my sight when i try to see out of that one eye. they cant fix it. but it cant get worse. they don't know how the scar got there. it may have been a pre birth thing. i don't know. but its probably a scar on your retina. don't worry, your not alone. sorry that's all i can help you i think!|`|7b90e0b137475b4929c9e437878b799baa	That happened to me a few weeks ago.

If your glasses are operating you should see a doctor in my opinion.|`|968YIknKaa	could be a bunch of different things depending on your age and Rx and other factors.  some of the potential things can be fairly serious.<br>  <br>  need to see an eye doc asap.
TsjqzanQaa	One of the reasons that we have bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics is people like you who take medication irresponsibly.<br>  <br>  For an antibiotic to be effective, it has to be prescribed for specific organisms, and be taken for the reccommended  period.       If the full course of antibiotics aren't taken, some of the stronger bacteria survive, and are more resistant to antibiotics; that's why we have drug resistant strep MRSA and others.<br>  <br>  If you have a sore throat, take a lozenge; that's what they're for.<br>  <br>  If you have a persistant sore throat, go to the doctor, get diagnosed and treated with the appropriate prescribed medication.<br>  <br>  Self-medication is stupid and dangerous.|`|zOIgzIy4aa	always go by what,s on the bottle. like every other drug, you can overdose.|`|RXI8ImdIaa	This will not help your sore throat.<br>  <br>  If you have a bacterial infection that you cannot clear, you need to get a prescription from your doctor.<br>  <br>  Amoxicilin may or may not be effective on whatever is growing in your throat. Even if it is effective, it will take 7-10 days of steady levels in your bloodstream to kill it off. If you just spike a high level for a few days and then quit, you're more likely to grow a super-infection than you are to cure anything.<br>  <br>  So, don't screw around with antibiotics on your own. <br>  <br>  And like I said they don't help throat pain anyway. Just use cepastat or something like that.|`|F4aJ3LTTaa	Was it prescribed for this specific condition? If not, you should talk to a doctor to make sure its not viral, like the flu. <br>  Taking 2 pills will not speed recovery, if it is a bacterial infection. But you can not overdose on it. Worst case scenario is that you will build a tolerance to it by not taking it correctly, and next time it will not work.|`|SltEwVX7aa	take it exactly as the doctor told you.  If you're supposed to have two pills a day, that means every twelve hours.  It's not so much as knocking out the bacteria with large doses all at once, it's more about hitting them over a ten day period to make sure they stay gone.  <br>  <br>  Usually, once you start your antibiotic course, you should feel way better in a day or two.|`|AA11315244	It depends on the Milligrams..what dosage?
Hq6nSl1Qaa	Possibly.  What you describe may or maynot have been an allergy.  Proactiv does contain irritants in the regiment.  While the irritants tend to be less than, say, relying totally on Oxy10, it can still be irritating.  <br>  <br>  I would try an application on the upper part of your thigh or arm.  If it really is an allergy, there is a good probably that it will hit there.  If it simply irritation on already stressed skin, then you still may have a breakout/flare up if you try to use it again.<br>  <br>  Consider Omega-3 fatty acid supplements, don't drink milk, and refrain from eating beef and cheese as much as possible.|`|8dff1db77e286db113459b3b54cdef2daa	yes. the next exposure wil be worse as you built up anybodies against it

KNbk23Iraa	ok first rule to having nuts is<br>  1. dont get them kicked, punched or hurt in any way. because it hurts so much that it makes you wanna spew.<br>  <br>  2. they dont get in the way.<br>  3. gotta where the right undies other wise they drive you nuts. lol<br>  4. they arent heavy jeeze. not metal. wish they were.<br>  5. there is only 1 way to find out wat they feel like and that is... to feel them. hope this helps your curios mind. p.s dont even think about getting a sexchange.|`|lLN8VD20aa	yeah ... they were so heavy I gave them away.|`|zOIgzIy4aa	i don,t even think about them. they don,t get in the way. yes they are light and no they don,t bump into anything. i guess since we are born with them we don,t really notice them that much.|`|zLUQJxJkaa	So just as a first note, the human body naturally protects the eyes, this is an instinct. A human MALE instinctively protects the eyes and the nuts.<br>  They aren't annoying, obviously I'm used to them since I've had them all my life. Don't notice when I walk unless I actually thing about it.. but no.<br>  No they don't get in the way.<br>  I don't squeeze my thighs together when I walk hence I do not squash my balls. Not always lightweight.. depends on the temperature. Remember that the sack changes length depending on the temp; cold and they come closer, warm and they hang further.<br>  No my warrior isn't annoying.. well unless things happen. I don't really think about it because, again, I don't know anything different.<br>  If you wanted to know what it feels like to get hit there (you'll never know but here's a close shot):<br>  Poke yourself in the eyes, then rip them out. Let them dangle by your jawbone and smack them up against your face, continue doing this for 5 minutes- this is as close as I can describe to being hit in the testicles.<br>  Not really a perverted question.. whatever lol.|`|gnCKVOoZaa	they're only annoying when they get cold... other than that they don't feel heavy unless you have some disease in your nuts lol|`|OKsZngajaa	theyre not heavy but annoying sometimes probably just as annoying as boobs and they can itch|`|IGCZq7BXaa	no they dont feel like their in the way. and no they are not heavy lol|`|XAkLPdhqaa	A guys balls are just there, very sensitive. You don't even think about them until something happens to them.|`|4pGJJMSYaa	They can be annoying.<br>  The thing I hate most about my balls are when they stick to the side of my thighs. As funny as that sounds...it's rly annoying.<br>  But I still luv em|`|AA12022261	"if they get hurt you will cry too.."|`|UR6jvjBVaa	they sometimes feel weird when you get cold..........like they hide inside your body!<br>  it's the Dlck that's annoying!|`|iTwi0w5Jaa	they are something extra that you wish you didn't have between your legs.|`|h5cInok4aa	wtfff is this? i need to stop answering these men's health questions ahahaha.|`|jpyy7Rjbaa	ask a friend to let you hold his and see for yourself.......|`|ti9ZlNJ4aa	dont notice them when u walt... umm... they can be annoyne with boxers sometimes...but never a problem|`|62090c45c2dff067ee36d896ab2d47d4aa	You don't notice the balls at all if you wear underwear. They are so light you don't really notice them. Yeah they can bump into your legs when your moving fast; running, jumping, skipping or moving left to right. But you don't feel a thing hell, it's like there not even there until they get hit then the pain is just mind numbing. The penis isn't really as annoying as you may think. Like the balls you don't notice it until it's needed...you know #1 and such. So I hope I and the other guys have answered your question.|`|Nv0XcFPbaa	Ok. interesting question..<br>  Penis- Annoys all guys throughout the day cuz of random hard ons.. and just moving to the wrong spot..( not heavy..... really..=-_)<br>  Balls. - Lightweight for the most part.. whack back and forth between the legs..; and if you are fat then the thighs rub agains them.. not a big deal quite enjoyable...|`|4UwUMbxCaa	YOUNG LADY,  My balls are in a sac ok. Sometime they hang lower or more relaxed and sometime the sac theyre in gets tight.  They are rather  round not too heavy, kind of firm thay hurt when u dont relieve u r self from sex or masterbation. Annd if they get hit they hurt like hell.|`|JImPiUCqaa	okay well when your exersising they still bounce up and down like boobs<br>  when its hot they sweat and smell like ***<br>  when its cold it feels numb<br>  it hurts when you get kicked there(same for women too i think)<br>  <br>  you get use too them the same way your use too boobs|`|9nilTbW9aa	Nope... barely even notice them... They're just there; hardly noticeable... At least unless you're thinking about them, then you feel everything.|`|oSUM5MmNaa	I mean, since your born with them, you kinda just don't notice them.<br>  <br>  Its like an armless guy saying, "Are arms heavy? Do they bump into your hips a lot?"|`|yfn6ZCk5aa	I enjoy having balls, they have the swing, but they get stuck to the side of your thigh and when kicked...... DAMN!!!!!
lcyV3WHAaa	You should ask to see your doctor alone, that way you can speak to the doctor without any fear of your mum hearing what is said. Tell the doctor what is going on, as well as your fears about bi polar and being put on medication.<br>  <br>  The doctor is there to help you and should keep what is said in confidence. If you are uncertain, confirm this with your doctor before you tell them anything.<br>  <br>  You say that you know that you shouldn't cut yourself - it's good to admit that, and it is the first step toward seeking help. Don't ever think that you are alone in this and do not blame yourself or be embarrassed/ashamed, etc. There are people out there who can help you and you should take the opportunity with the doctor to get that help.|`|rbGoxvI6aa	Wait what? Why do you not want to get medication?|`|rdcUOa1zaa	well they arent guna hurt you if they find out! all they will do is help you! dont you want to be and feel better? dont you want to feel like you dont have to self harm urself to feel okay? of course you do, and thats all anyone will do. they will help you be better.

nEq9pHoLaa	come on! you can do it. just walk/jog/stretch for a minimum of 12 minutes to burn off those calories. anything under that time won't help. ignore that chocolate cake and get sugar free pudding. don't skip breakfast though because that can make your body transfer energy to fat. eat smaller portions. look at the box of whatever you are eating and check the amount of fat it has with other products. choose the one that has the least amount. do some pushups, jumping jacks, sit ups, crunches, tricep and quad stretches.|`|6jSxYrZnaa	Either you're willing to make it happen or you aren't.

Fat looks like little bubbles of rice krispees?<br>  If you see that, you need to goto the ER and get stitches. <br>  <br>  <br>  Otherwise, clean it with soap and water and put a band-aid on it.<br>  Cuts can bleed for awhile, especially if you keep moving the area where the cut is.

The closer you sit across from him/her the more pain your going to feel, but hey the pain only last if you think about it, just breath in and out. <br>       If you prefer to do it yourself, then you can split you legs against the wall (your face should be facing the wall), and lean back a little, using your hands to push yourself closer to the wall, thus stretching your legs. *the closer you sit to the wall the better*<br>  <br>  If there's any confusions you can just post it, and i'll get back to you.

Lean forward and watch 30min - 1hour TV show with legs open, elbows on floor, hands supporting chin/head. 3. STAND, STRETCH and RELAX during commericials. -Done for the day! 4. Repeat daily, getting farther, and farther apart. Move only as far as comfortable. Later you'll be able to lean your entire body weight forward into a "split" position just before getting up for a commercial break stretch. 5. To get better, 'split' for 10 seconds a day, followed by 30 seconds a day, then 1 min. a day, then 5 min. a day etc, etc... <br>  <br>  Feel anything wrong, moved too fast? See a doctor. <br>  <br>  Watch your favorite show to forget that tight to loosening feeling. GOOD LUCK!|`|NVOaNlpqaa	Anyone can do the splits.  You need to be flexible and at first you do not expect to do it.  You need to stretch each day and then you'll see improvement in your flexibility.

bou4tmBmaa	I recently heard that having certain hyperglycemic disorders (apparently there are 6 types) can completely affect and sometimes even cause anxiety, panic attacks, organ tremors, phobias, etc etc...<br>  <br>  ...and apparently the cure is quite simply your diet! You say you only eat sweet foods nowadays? Addiction to sugar and tiredness are the main symptoms for these disorders, and its as simple as cutting out all sugar, (refined carbs -->) white bread, white pasta, white rice (basmati is ok), alcohol and certain fruits from your diet, and supplementing your diet with zinc; and after a few weeks you feel great! <br>  <br>  If you go to your doctor or natropath and get a 4-6hr GTT (glycemic tolerance test) which is a longer version of the same test one would get to test for diabetes, that will tell you if you have this and which type you have..<br>  <br>  ...may not be the cause of your anxiety but its worth further investigation if not just to rule it out..<br>  <br>  Oh,... and i've suffered with major anxiety most of my life, and yes its not a fun thing that's for sure, but if you try for a more positive outlook, thats half the battle sometimes! You may not be able to get rid of it all together but it is certainly manageable with experience, and having understanding of the illness and not letting it weigh you down with a 'woe' attitude makes all the difference. Try not to let the label make you your own prisoner :) It is only as disabling as you allow it to be xx

XoDUTquWaa	Usually tonsillitis is very painful and causes the tonsills to turn a fiery red and they usually swell from inflamation. And most of the time you will usually have a mild to moderate temp. along with swollen lymphnodes. Most of the time it is so painful that you will definately know it's not just a common sore throat with a cold. If you feel that it is please see your family physician. You will need the proper antibiotics promptly.|`|wnyuH0aTaa	Your head falls off|`|A5mgh8G2aa	yup its me again and i was thinking  i had toncillitis and was enimic however the only way to tell is through a blood test which sucks and feels realy wierd if you havent had one it doesent hurt but its just really bizzare thiers one other way to tell which is have a swab put directly at the back of your throat  BEHIND the tocils which i wouldent do as im paranoid of choking btw they dont use anything to num it out other then enough gas to make it so you cant fight them from doing it i chose the blood test|`|48059b1217c0db411cd0097366164c61aa	You won't get a cough with tonsilitus
eVJQrE31aa	no!  this is such an urban myth.  spend just a few minutes on any serious medical website and you'll see that MAYBE supertight jeans might slightly lower temperature of balls but unless you have a very low sperm count or unhealthy sperm to begin with, tight jeans will have no effect on your ability to get a girl pregnant.|`|TsjqzanQaa	I don't think that it will.<br>  <br>  What it will do is slightly lower your sperm count, as sperm are produced in a very small range of temperature, which is why the scrotum expands and contracts to allow the optimum temperature for sperm production.<br>  <br>  In colder temperatures, it contracts, and holds them closer to the body.     When it's warmer, the scrotum allows the testicles to hang farther away from body heat, and to allow more air to circulate around them.<br>  <br>  Skinny jeans and tight underwear interfere with this temperature regulation of the testicles.<br>  <br>  But the decrease in sperm production is only temporary, and goes back to normal when the scrotum is allowed to normally do it's job of temperature regulation.|`|mdHfNKcTaa	They mess up your baby maker.|`|X6ZxYovlaa	If you wear skinny jeans, chances are you won't be needing your balls.  <br>  <br>  EDIT: Maybe you are so popular with the ladies because... well you know girls like gay friends.  Besides, if you aren't gay, here's some advice:  If you wear skinny jeans, girls will think you have an incredily tiny dick.|`|5tjEWSbZaa	Dude, in my eyes, guys shouldn't wear skinnies. It really makes you look like you are gay, so don't wear them to start. <br>  oh and to answer your question, some of my friends have told me of their experiences, so ya, it could.<br>  <br>  Oh, and if you're hair really looks like it does in your avatar... then you'll look like a girl too.|`|jU0RPVLYaa	Well as long as their not to tight it'd be fine. But some dude actually spilt his scrotum from wearing them to tight, seriously. And they're gay as ****. I've never worn them and hopefully never will. <br>  Don't wear them.|`|0f8aaef56ddfbd7442060251c8e3315faa	hahah at Koko's answer!!<br>  <br>  Dudes should not wear skinny jeans!!!|`|0mro55nWaa	As long as they re not so tight they re causing discomfort, then you should be fine.

396e0df85e9b2414f391d81a9892f542aa	HIV information is so sensitive because of the stigma associated with having the disease.  Years ago, when HIV was a death sentence and there was little known about the ways in which it was spread, laws were established to make HIV medical information and the confidentiality surrounding it very strict.  This was done to help protect those who suffer with the disease from suffering from discrimination which has been very severe in the past.|`|CTY7sXzSaa	HIV/AIDS is a new condition yet it is very old. Over two decades down the road, people have deliberately failed to accept reality. HIV information is more or less like the scripture. It is ever old yet ever new. people will need to listen  to the same thing several times before they change behavior. From the fact that HIV is mainly attributed to bad sexual practices and that sexual needs like other needs are insatiable. The continuous need that is never satisfied makes the hearer guilty of making the same mistakes time and again. At some point in time, people become complacent to the information and they end up opening both ears so that whatever information that comes in, exits through the other ear.

It happened to me. But other people end up gaining weight.<br>  <br>  Anyway, when you start avoiding gluten, it will disrupt your diet a lot, and you may have difficulty finding stuff you can eat to start with, so please try and concentrate on that and not worry too much about losing weight for now. It's important to learn how to get a balanced diet with all the necessary nutrients without wheat, rye or barley. It is a lot harder than you might think, because wheat is so much of a staple in our society, and is found in virtually all processed foods.|`|ca2Qs2ykaa	A gluten-free diet isn't meant as a means to lose weight and depending on your choices of food, can cause you to gain a lot of weight.  There is a lot of gluten-free junk food on the market — it's all designed to give people with celiac disease choices since they cannot eat wheat, rye, barley or oats.  A lot of gluten-free food is loaded with corn and sugar which will do nothing but make you gain weight.  <br>  <br>  If you want to lose weight focus on a whole food (no processed food) with as little sugar as possible.  The gluten-free diet is a medical necessity for people with celiac disease, not just another fad diet to lose weight.  Good luck.|`|y4eTE1Ihaa	The key for losing those excess pounds is easy - eat less food and exercise more - the problems appear when we actually try to put that into practice! There are lots of stumbling blocks in the big wide world don't you think?!

I melted away thrity pounds, it definitely does work!

IgztWp0uaa	The only "treatment" for lactose intolerance is to avoid consuming lactose or try taking those lactase pills. <br>  Your body is simply no longer producing the enzyme you need in order to break down the milk sugars. It happens to most adults as they age.<br>  You should also consider being tested for celiac disease or gluten intolerance as lactose intolerance is usually one of the first symptoms of celiac disease as the villi tips are destroyed (the tips are where lactase is produced by the body).|`|a5f8fb915b0c89693e97dc814aba467faa	Yes. Lactose intolerance develops over time. This will happen regardless of any "treatment." There is no cure for lactose intolerance, and no treatment to stop it from getting worse. <br>  <br>  The only thing you can do is to take the enzyme lactase in a pill when you eat lactose (dairy), since your body doesn't product lactase. Luckily, lactase is readily available over the counter. Even at the grocery store. This is because the majority of the population is lactose intolerant to some degree.<br>  <br>  The only other thing to do is to not consume dairy. I use a combination of both methods. I normally avoid dairy. But I have some every once in while. Maybe once a week or every few weeks. Then I take lactase.|`|gaGD8n9Uaa	Technically there is no official treatments, although some Naturopaths have been able to induce the body to create that enzyme again. <br>  <br>  For most people, taking the Enzyme in a pill form only works for so long. For myself after about a year the pills no longer do anything and I have to avoid any Dairy (Minus Yogurt due to the fact that it has an active bacterial culture that digests the Dairy for you) products. <br>  <br>  Some people have a problem with Yogurt, and many Lactose Intolerant people (Myself Included) Also have problems with Soy, Although Rice And Almond Milk are good alternatives. As well eating Goat Cheese and Goat Milk is a Good alternative to those as well, although they can wear off.<br>  <br>  It definitely gets worse over time.

K6fasl6kaa	i say this as a friend, there are several things you say that lead me to believe you may be really in need of some professional counseling.  the first is your desire to die.  that would be tragic if at such a young age , you feel that desperate to throw away any hope of change or happiness.  please get comfortable being who you are and looking forward to who you will become.  over thinking things is one of the things i do that makes me miserable.  it's difficult to stop yourself and think about something else positive, but that is what you must do. the thought processes you are having may be caused by a chemical imbalance or hormones that you can check with your dr or therapist that you trust about.  your parents probably love you very much but don't really understand you or how what they are saying/doing is hurting you.  since you believe in God, know that he loves you most of all and that you can lean on him when you feel like this.|`|rdcUOa1zaa	first to make other people like you, you have to like urself. if ur parents are emotionally and mentally abusing u then do the same back to them. if u have some relative other than ur parents that u trust and love and like being around, unlike ur parents, then talk to them. maybe they could talk to ur parents and maybe you could live with this other relative.|`|A96W1WVCaa	You don't always need friends, and don't let that be the reason to be depressed.

They stimulate the salivary glands, and all the extra saliva cleans your teeth and gums. And if that salsa is too hot, the water you'll drink to cool the burn will clean your mouth, too.<br>  <br>  Salt. Dissolve 1 teaspoon salt in 1 cup warm water, and rinse your mouth with it to help treat bleeding gums, canker sores, and toothache. Salt makes a great whitening toothpaste, too. Pulverize salt in a blender, food processor, or coffee grinder, or spread some on a cutting board and roll it with a pastry rolling pin to crush it into a fine sand-like texture. Mix 1 part crushed salt with 2 parts baking soda, then dip a dampened toothbrush into the mixture and brush your teeth. Keep the powder in an airtight container in your bathroom. This mixture also helps remove plaque.<br>  <br>  Sesame oil. Gargling with warm sesame oil is an Ayurvedic treatment--the holistic system from India--for gum disease. Take a mouthful and swish it around twice a day, then rinse. It's also said that this simple gargle can reduce cheek wrinkles. What a great bonus!<br>  <br>  Vinegar. Here's an easy (although temporary) toothache fix. Try rinsing your mouth with a mixture of 4 ounces warm water, 2 tablespoons vinegar, and 1 tablespoon salt. <br>  <br>  Home Remedies from the Drawer<br>  <br>  Spoon. Brushing or scraping your tongue is an important part of your oral hygiene routine. It rids your mouth of bacteria and food particles, and it stimulates your salivary glands to wake up and get to work. Use a spoon to scrape from the back of the tongue to the front, repeating until you've covered the entire area.<br>  <br>  Home Remedies from the Freezer<br>  <br>  Ice. That's the last thing you want to stick on an aching tooth, isn't it? Well, don't stick it on your tooth; use it on your hand. Rub an ice cube in the soft spot between your thumb and first finger. This acupressure treatment may stop tooth pain. If your jaw is really throbbing and swollen, though, an ice pack to the face for about ten minutes every hour will help relieve both the pain and the swelling. Just be careful, as rapid cooling can increase pain. If that doesn't work, try moist heat.<br>  <br>  Home Remedies from the Refrigerator<br>  <br>  Apples. Munching on a raw apple an hour after a meal cleans the teeth and helps heal the gums.<br>  <br>  Cheese. You know that nasty bacteria that's just waiting to take a whack at your tooth enamel? Cheese is their sworn enemy. First, it stimulates the salivary glands to clean the mouth. According to studies, just a few ounces of hard cheese eaten after a meal may protect against decay. There's also evidence to suggest that fatty acids in cheese may have antibacterial properties. And finally, cheese proteins may actually coat and protect tooth enamel. So, here's another reason to "say cheese"!<br>  <br>  Figs. To "strengthen" your teeth, eat 4 figs at one time, once a day. Chew well and slowly. This stimulates the saliva flow and cleanses the mouth.<br>  <br>  Lemon juice. Squeeze the juice of half a lemon into a cupful of water and drink to staunch bleeding gums and gingivitis. Don't take lemon juice full strength, as it can erode tooth enamel.<br>  <br>  Melon. Any melon will do. One hour after eating, chew some melon slowly. It will help stop gums from bleeding. <br>  <br>  Milk. Milk is a good source of calcium, an essential mineral for strong teeth and bones. Drinking a glass of "moo juice" can help promote dental health. (Note: Milk is mildly acidic, so don't put your baby to bed with a bottle; it may cause severe decay.) While you're in the fridge, check for these other calcium-packed foods: yogurt, broccoli, Swiss chard, and salmon. <br>  <br>  Strawberries. They're a wonderful tooth whitener. Rub the juice on the teeth and leave for five minutes. Then rinse off with warm water that has a pinch of baking soda dissolved in it. <br>  <br>  ?2007 Publications International, Ltd.<br>  Strawberry juice whitens teeth naturally.<br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Tea bag. Black tea contains fluoride that can suppress the growth of bacteria that cause decay and dental plaque, the sticky white film that forms on your teeth. (When it hardens, it's called tartar.) Drop a tea bag of black tea into a cup of hot water, and let it brew for six minutes. This will allow the maximum amount of fluoride to escape into the water. Squeeze the tea bag into the water before discarding it to get that last little bit of fluoride. Use the tea as a rinse to prevent plaque buildup after you eat sweets.<br>  <br>  Watercress. Chew fresh watercress several times a day to treat sore or bleeding gums. <br>  <br>  Home Remedies from the Spice Rack<br>  <br>  Allspice. It helps relieve toothache. Wet your finger and dip it into the spice, then rub it along the gum line near the aching tooth. You can also steep some in a glass of warm water, then rinse your mouth with it. Not only does this rinse relieve pain, it also freshens your breath.<br>  <br>  Clove|`|z1WdtCVfaa	brush your teeth.<br>  if your talking about those white stains on your teeth. thats called tartar. you can get tartar protection toothpaste and you can also get your teeth whitened/cleaned by the dentist and it might go away. but it's really hard to get rid of.|`|loqsl5xXaa	brush with toothpaste that has an agent to remove plaque <br>  <br>  floss<br>  <br>  use a post and or pr- rinse with an agent that has a plaque removal formula|`|EKoRHgdgaa	Brush and floss regularly.

GBG2hbQ4aa	OCD has a strong underlying element of anxiety.  OCD also (sometimes) responds well to medications that increase serotonin activity in the brain.   Given those two characteristics, I would suggest taking a close look at your eating habits.  <br>  <br>  That may strike you as strange, but take into account that your brain is part of your physical body.  The foods that you eat should provide adequate nutrition to create/maintain an optimal state of wellness for your physical self.  If your diet fails to provide that nutrition, or worse...if your diet includes foods that deplete your nutritional status and/or introduce neurotoxic ingredients, that can cause mental and/or cognitive symptoms that range from anxiety to ADHD to depression, to OCD...even to hallucinations.<br>  <br>  Sooo... start keeping a food journal.  Write down what you eat, as well as what your mental states are prior to eating, immediately after eating, as well as how you feel several hours later.  You may identify a particular food that seems to trigger symptoms.<br>  <br>  Make some changes in your diet.  Specifically, eliminate all junk food.  That would be processed foods that contain artificial ingredients as well as foods/drinks that contain sugar or sugar substitutes.  Caffiene should also be off limits for a time while you explore the relationship between what you eat/drink and the symptoms you experience. <br>  <br>  You don't indicate your age.  If you are younger and still live with your parents, you will need to ask your mom to help you plan a 'junk food free diet'.  That means you eat whole foods...lots of fresh vegetables and fruits, whole grains, and protein from healthy sources.<br>  <br>  In addition, supplement your nutritional intake with ...<br>  *   a good multi-vitamin/mineral complex to be sure you<br>      are getting all the nutrients your body needs.  There<br>      are many brands that have a liquid product... these<br>      assimilate well<br>  *   a B100, taken daily...B vitamins are critical for a <br>      healthy nervous system (the brain is part of the <br>      nervous system).  High sugar intake depletes your<br>      B vitamin levels very rapidly<br>  *   a good EFA (essentail fatty acid) formula...again, <br>     critical for a healthy nervous system<br>  <br>  It's usually a good idea to take an enzyme formula as well.  The standard American diet is very lacking in enzymes, and enzymes are critical to health in countless ways (too numerous for this answer).  An enzyme formula will insure you are digesting and assimilating your foods and your supplements, and so will optimize the benefits you get.|`|vNaAZU3gaa	I saw a couple of segments on tv called true life " i have ocd" and it shows three different people and the strugles they go through and what they do to help themselves. Maybe that could give you some ideas. You could probably you tube them..|`|PgAtUe2taa	eat beans.|`|ParFJxnSaa	OCD. There is a quiz for this, in section 1 (psychological tests) on page E, in ezy build, below. If it takes up more than an hour, daily, gets worse, or interferes with your life to any great degree; seek therapy, because it can quickly take over a person's life. See section 7, on OCD, at ezy build, below and also view section 6, (page N first) since some mental health professionals consider it to be an anxiety related disorder - personally, I believe it may be a way of avoiding, or reducing anxiety/fear. View: CONFRONTING YOUR FEARS, and page N, in section 6. Ask yourself when you first started developing OCD tendencies, and what happened, around that time. You didn't have the therapies and techniques available to you then, that are available to you, now. If you are aware of the cause, you can use EMDR, therapy (see sections 33 - 34, with a therapist locator) to address it. If you aren't aware of the cause, you can try asking for an answer in your dreams. Your subconscious mind certainly hasn't forgotten that cause, but may currently be shielding you from it, by not allowing you to remember, and instead, forcing you to adopt your obsessive behavio(u)r.<br>  <br>   Write down 3 times, before going to sleep: "Tonight, in my dreams, I want to remember seeing what my fear is, when I get up", and put it under your pillow. Then say it aloud 3 times, after lights out. It is important to summon as much desire as you are capable of, to more effectively communicate this to your subconscious mind. If this works, it should produce a response within 2 weeks; if not, you may not be remembering, so set an alarm to go off after, first, 3 hrs; next night 4; next night 5: have a pen & paper handy, and WRITE DOWN THOSE DREAMS!!! or, chances are, you will forget. Remember, the response may be metaphorical (figurative), rather than literal. There is a section on dream interpretation in the Social Science section, here at Y!A, where you will receive other interpretations (mine are based largely on the work of the psychologist, Fritz Perls; others vary; some are mystical mumbo jumbo). View DREAM INTERPRETATION, in section 3, at ezy build, if interested. Although I am usually much better at interpreting the dreams of males,  <br>  <br>  I have had some success with those of females. Feel free to email me, by clicking on my profile; all I can do is offer my interpretation, but the dreamer is always the ultimate judge of the true meaning of any dream. Alternatively (and not for free) you could try NeuroLinguistic Programming, (Google: "NLP" & see Wikipedia.org), or professional hypnotherapy, if you are fairly suggestible, as are around 40% of people. Practice one of the relaxation methods in sections 11, 2, 2c, or 2i, daily, and when needed. Also, give the EFT a good tryout, to see if it helps you. There is also a version for use in public places, (if you like, you can claim to have a headache, as you massage/lightly tap your temples). "Even though I suffer from OCD, I deeply and completely accept myself." Section 53, and pages 2, 2.q and 2.o at <a href="http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris" rel="nofollow">http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris</a> also refer. One method you can try is by replacing your OCD behavio(u)r with the EFT. it takes about 30 - 40 repetitions, for most people to instill a new habit.

I had every sign of my period when I was 12 years old, but I didn't get it until I was 14. You should keep some pads/tampons in you locker, just in case.|`|16bWGB14aa	You are probably about to start. I think you should ask your mom for a pad to put in your purse so you will be prepared if you start your period at school.|`|1keH3R6paa	I think you'll get it within half a year or so. Sometimes I feel left out too when all my friends talk about theirs. I'm thirteen and I want it too. But it's nothing to rush about and your body will start when it's ready.
ioNKVW9haa	COMPLETELY NORMAL.<br>  <br>  A lot of times, when young women (such as yourself) get their period, it doesn't follow the usual 28-day pattern.  Remember that your body is still developing, and just because you got your first period, you haven't reached full sexual maturity yet.<br>  <br>  VERY few women have a perfectly regular cycle EVER, and even FEWER women start off with a regular cycle right off the bat.<br>  <br>  The discharge is a good indicator that it may be coming, but you'll probably skip a few months here and there.<br>  <br>  If it becomes a problem and doesn't fix itself in a few years, or if you are REALLY concerned about it, have your mother take you to a gynecologist.  There are many women who start birth control not to keep from getting pregnant, but to regulate their period.  I was put on birth control when I was a year or two older than you for that very reason, and I was a virgin at the time.<br>  <br>  Again, if you are still super concerned about it, see a doctor.  They'll be able to answer any questions you may have much better than we can here AND they'll be able to examine you and tell you if there's a problem.|`|FNeCDm3raa	NORMAL.<br>  <br>  It takes months, sometimes YEARS for a young girl's body to get into regularity, thus you will miss some months. Be happy! LOL<br>  <br>  ETA: Yes, the period is still there, the body is just adjusting. Always be prepared and carry pads/tampons for when it does come back.|`|16bWGB14aa	That happens to some girls. It will come back eventually.|`|9kvR0zpBaa	when you first get your period it is automatically going to be irregualr. some months you miss it and sometimes you get it twice in one month. when i first got mine i skipped 4 months before getting it again! if you are still concerned, see a doc|`|7JwteIHmaa	sounds like me when i first got it the same thing happend and it didnt come back until 5 months l8r its normal and it will come around.

IwlE0oFbaa	Good question!  I guess it is your state of mind and how you function.<br>  <br>  Then it depends on the cause of the short or long sleep.<br>  <br>  Is the short hours of sleep because of a busy full healthy schedule?<br>  <br>  People with a guilty conscious, facing difficulties with anxiety, or the mentally ill may get less sleep and not be able to sleep longer.<br>  <br>  I used to party in my younger years and would sleep when I hit the pillow.  But when I quit, now my mind sometimes would not quit.  <br>  I have had ups and downs on amounts of sleep and recently I took care of my dad who sometimes had trouble sleeping in his illness.  People in pain have a harder time sleeping.  I found a number of books on sleeping better for him and learned some things myself.<br>  <br>  This is a reasonable website for techniques in aiding good sleep; I avoid the expensive suggestions.  Eating turkey is one of the foods that increase natural sleep chemicals in the brain.  Also I find the need to eat plenty of vegtables during the day.
xYTagSIyaa	You have a one in eight chance of getting breast cancer if you are female.<br>  Your risk will be about 20% higher with a family grandmother involved I believe.<br>  <br>  If you do monthly breast exams and get a baseline mamogram in your twenties and when you are 40 and over a yearly one, you will increase your chance of catching anything very early, even if it does happen.<br>  <br>  Their is much research that increasing your exercise and eating heathy with berries and milk and lots of vitamin D and tomatoes, and less red meat, with decrease your risks.<br>  <br>  If you get it and catch it early their is a 100% cure rate for stage 0-1<br>  a 92%  5year survival rate with stage 11A,  and a 81% survival rate over 5 years with 11B.<br>  <br>  So you can see, it is very important to be vigilant and do your self checks.<br>  <br>  Do try and stay away from the pill if you can, as this can increase cancer risk.<br>  <br>  Do not let yourself get to be overweight.<br>  <br>  Do not smoke.<br>  <br>  limit eating soy products as they have a lot of natural estrogen.<br>  <br>  You can get genetic testing to see if you are at an increased risk, if you choose.  If you have no coverage this test can cost about 3,000.00.<br>  <br>  I would not worry about it,  we as women are all at risk and you are going to be more aware and do your checks because you are concerned about it.  You are young and have loads of amunition to help.  There has been tonnes of research done lately and they may even have a cure someday.<br>  <br>  Hope this is comforting to you.

Condoms are NOT 100% effective against pregnancy.  The only 100% guarantee of not getting pregnant is abstinence.  <br>  <br>  The effectiveness of a condom against pregnancy depends on the person/people using it.  If the condom isn't put on until half way through intercourse; if the condom is broken, ripped, or snagged; if the man pulls it on roughly; or if the sex is rough, the chances of the condom protecting against unwanted pregnancy is diminished.<br>  <br>  Even when used CORRECTLY, a condom is only 98% effective against pregnancy and STIs/STDs.|`|sBVmxwqhaa	Well, you're no longer a virgin!  You now need to begin seeing your doctor every year for a womens annual exam.  <br>  <br>  Some times having sex for the first time, or if you haven't had it in a while will alter your hormones and cause a change in your cycles.

It sounds to me like you either have an allergy to cheese, which can be tested for by an allergy doctor, or your body is just really sensitive to cheese. If you were lactose intolerant you would experience symptoms after drinking milk or eating ice cream. Hope this helps! =)|`|pLcUFBl2aa	Cheese is probably something you are sensitive to. You're not allergic or else you would get rashes or have a hard time breathing. Does it happen when eat any cheese at all or how much you eat? Try not eating cheese for  week and see if that's any better. When you eat cheese, if the sick feeling persists, go to a doctor and ask him what the problem is. Doctors know almost everything =)

Also do not cut back on your eating.

Just running for 30 minutes a day and having a healthy diet can help you lose 3 pounds a week. don't sweat it, you can do the extra stuff and that can help a lot. but if you are getting tired, sleep. sleep gives you more energy to do everything you need. always remember, DON'T PANIC:)|`|m8alP5kPaa	Try it.

PxVEzNyMaa	You are NOT alone. I just went on a 5 mile run about a week ago with a plantar wart on my heel. i had bought a over the counter drug for temporary use, then I had bought cotton strips and tape to cushion it. Once I got back home, I called the doctor for a prescription. To save time, ask for a wart ball. It's a cream that takes it out painlessly within a month. good luck:)|`|4d8923629944072027bbc12052c6a2e3aa	You can use Apple cider vinegar.<br>  <br>  Apply it to the wart and it will be gone within two weeks.<br>  <br>  Soak a cotton ball in ACV, then apply the cotton ball to the wart, then fix the cottonball to the wart with magnetic tape or a bandaid. I find the bandaid doesn't work.|`|9b3xkt36aa	Hey...Treating planters warts can be done with over the counter medication.  Duofilm is one that works pretty good but any wart remover will do.  Basically you apply it at night before going to bed...then in the morning use either a pummice stone or a razor blade and "wear off" the treated part (best to do after a shower).  the trick is to keep at it and keep going untill  ALL trace of the wart is gone...including the little black heads you can see at the surface of the skin.

I was depressed from the time I was 9 until I was 18.  I felt I had no one to turn to so I kept silent.  With age I have learned that you don't have to suffer in silence.  Some people you can turn to are a teacher you like, the school clinic nurse, a suicide helpline, a friend's mother that you trust.  Because of your age your parents will have to be informed at some point but that is for an adult you trust to do.  Help is out there; do not think for one moment that it is hopeless.  Depression is an illness, it can be caused by genetics, trauma, or a chemical imbalance in your brain.  You can feel better; amazing advances have been made in dealing with depression.  Don't give up or stay silent; be brave and reach out.  It took courage for you to write this question.  You've taken the first step now take the next.  I believe in you; good luck.|`|PEN3hha7aa	Think how depressed your parents would be if they found this question you wrote and the next day they had to attend your Funeral?

The way you are talking and acting is like you already poured gasoline on yourself and gave someone else the matches.  The only thing you have not done is light the match for them!!<br>  <br>  START talking to your parents, that is what they are there for. You are stupid if you Don't talk to them.

That isn't going to solve anything...you and I both know that.  Um, I'm not really sure what to tell you because I can't say I've been in the exact same position as you (I'm a senior in high school, btw), but don't let a small speech problem get you down!  People shouldn't assume you are stupid based on how you talk, and if they do it's a flaw in them, NOT you.  Also I hope you realize soon enough that if you worry too much about what people think, it will get the best of you.  I think it's a waste of time, really.  I used to do that a lot, but then I decided people are going to judge you no matter what, and it's silly to try to influence the opinions of people who don't even know you.  It's kind of hard to explain, but I really mean it!<br>  <br>  My friend's mom committed suicide about a year and a half ago.  I can't even begin to tell you how it affected her family and friends...  It was horrible.  You never, and I repeat never, want to put the ones you love in that position.  Suicide really is the most selfish act a person can commit.  Not to mention that it is just unnatural for parents to see their children die.  Please don't put them through that.<br>  <br>  I can understand when you say it's hard to talk to your parents...sometimes I feel that way too.  But really there's no reason it should be a hard thing to do.  Try to find something you both have in common.  Perhaps your dad likes to watch baseball or something...you could do that with him.  That's just an example, but if you find something you can do with them it makes communication easier.<br>  <br>  Ok, ALMOST done.  I also want to recommend the book Devos for Teens by Susie Shellenberger.  It's actually a prayer book in that you read a page each day, read a few scriptures, and then say a prayer to go with it.  I'm not very religious, but I still do that each night before going to sleep, and I find that it has been really helpful in putting things in perspective.  I hope it helps you too!

ParFJxnSaa	View the information and weblinks for social anxiety/shyness, and self confidence, in sections 9, and 38, at <a href="http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris" rel="nofollow">http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris</a> Here is an exercise that can help you. It is called "Act as If." When you are in a social situation, act as if you are outgoing. Talk more, smile at everyone, ask questions, speak in a normal or excited tone, not a meek tone. Watch some of your outgoing peers, and imitate the style of their social behavior. (I PRETEND that I'm an ACTOR, PLAYING a PART).<br>  Research shows that when you "act as if" continually, your image of yourself begins to conform to your new behavior. In this case, you will gain self-esteem and self-confidence, and begin to see yourself as socially normal, not shy. You will become more socially successful, and this will motivate you to continue your new social behavior until it becomes a habit. Try this for a month, in every situation you can. I am confident that you will become much more comfortable and outgoing.<br>  <br>  One form of therapy is to go somewhere that nobody knows you, and deliberately make an utter fool of yourself: put on a paper hat, and yell out: "I'm the President of England", or something else ridiculous, (make up your own - have some fun, safely) then get back in the taxi, (warn the driver of your intentions, first) or car, and leave. People will point, and say: "Look at that idiot". But, you may not be up to the stage where you can do that, yet (I can, and I used to be shy). Or, preferably in the company of a friend, or family member, on a different train, or bus route to your regular one, call out the names, or numbers of all the stops. It will teach you that, although it isn't actually pleasant, (EXPECT MODERATE DISCOMFORT) you will survive; be stronger for the experience, and the next time (should you need to repeat this type of therapy) will be considerably easier. Remember: "A fear avoided is a fear strengthened; a fear faced is a fear reduced." Regard it as your final test: once you have accomplished it, the barrier will be broken; just don't go too far, the other way! Learn to laugh at yourself, and give a big, cheesy grin when others see you do something foolish, as we all do, occasionally.<br>  <br>  It is endearing, if you don't do it too often. Use positive affirmations: for example: "I am very likable and other people feel comfortable around me". Write down all of your self limiting beliefs; then write down the positive counter of them, (exact opposite) and repeat them and imprint them into your mind. Most importantly: Force yourself to approach somebody and initiate some sort of communication. Start out small by asking the time and directions and gradually go bigger. Although there are anti-anxiety medications (anxiolytics) available, these come with risks, and the possibility of side effects, habituation, even addiction, and withdrawal problems, and are unsuitable for young people. <br>  <br>  Try having a cup of "Tension Tamer", herbal tea, by Celestial Seasonings, (from supermarket tea, or health food aisles) or make some at home, and cool, then bottle, and drink as needed (I find it so strong tasting, that I need to drink it quickly, followed by something like fruit juice, to take away the taste, but others may find it more tolerable). C(h)amomile tea is a more palatable option. As with all herbal/green teas, use lemon/lime, and/or a little sweetener (NOT ARTIFICIAL!!!) but no cream, or milk. Xylitol, or Stevia is preferable, (health food stores) or fruit sugar (fructose, such as "Fruisana", from supermarket sugar aisles).|`|GqEAun7Baa	You just have to suck it up and talk to someone.

Mine was driving on highways, but I conquered it by just getting out there and doing it.  I know, sounds easier than it is.... So start small.  Invite a a/few friends to come over. Then ask them to go out to eat.  Baby steps first, then as you conquer one obstacle, do another. Then maybe you will see it is easier than you thought.  Second advice... Speak to your school councilor.  They should have some good ideas.<br>  Good Luck.|`|3cn3q2Rbaa	You could try going to see a counselor.<br>  And/or you could join some clubs, talk to people.

I really recommend going to see a doctor, even if it may seem scary at first. They are some of the few people who will actually understand what you are dealing with, and they help you figure out how to cope with it. Sometimes anxiety needs to be fixed with medication, and if this is the case for you, it'll be really hard to deal with the problem on your own without a doctor. I highly recommend finding a doctor to at least consult with about how you're feeling, because they will get you the help you need. Until then, remember to take deep breaths, and focus on the positive. You don't have to be a social butterfly, just be friendly to people and try to talk to people a little more. Eventually, it will get easier with practice. And just remember that you're not alone. I hope this wasn't too long, and it possibly helps a little. Good luck.

In fact, if you wear baggy clothes it will just make it look like your heavier. <br>  Try wearing high rise jeans, it will cover some stomach and give you a slimmer look. But wear a longer top with the jeans, dont tuck any shirt into them. Also, look for empire waist tops (tops that have a bow or something right under the breasts) it will emphasize the slimmest part of you. Try wearing heels too, it will make your legs look longer. <br>  But remember, don't try to wear clothes that ARNT your size. Like, if you are a large, dont buy a medium just because you are worried about what your friends will think about you being a large. In the end, you wearing a smaller size will just make you look and feel worse. Accept and embrace that size that you are because if you do you will look amazing. <br>  Remember, size doesnt mean anything. You can be a big girl and still look hot.

Clothes that are too tight are very unflattering as well.  Skinny jeans & leggings are made for supermodels, and tiny framed people I would stay away from those.  Avoid skin tight clothing period.  Avoid jeans with small pockets on the butt, small pockets make butt look bigger.  <br>  <br>  Darker clothes seem to be a lot more slimming than. Tops that are loose in the stomach are a great choice.  Vertical lines are slimming. A cute hair style, and cute accessories also help in presenting yourself well :)  <br>  <br>  If you have a Maurice's, Torrid, or a DEB in your mall, they usually have some cute plus size teen clothes.  Torrid can be a little more on the pricey side sometimes though.|`|9BNHNcDbaa	i think that you should ask your doctor and parents to help you loose weight at such a young age it is stressful and unhealthy.  Dont be embaressed to exercise.  But wear the best clothes you can find.  Don't wear sweats anymore because they stretch and you cannot tell if you are gaining weight or how your body is changing.  For exercise they are ok but not every single day. otherwise wear what you want and try on lots of clothes o find a style that fits and wear them, not skinny jeans, sometimes wearing shirts that are a little longer will help look better.  If you wear leggings, do black and wear a type of dress that covers your butt and thighs, it makes it looks thinner hope i helped  Good luck|`|NuPwR75Jaa	A baby doll top is always nice.

Also please avoid ironic shirts and clothing lines. Like a shirt that says cuty cuz people will laugh and hurt your feelings. Im not saying your beautiful, it is just people are cruel at times. especially at a young age.<br>  Th best thing to do is get comfertable with yourself and find clothing that makes you feel okay. Also going out for a daily walk of a mile helps you not gain weight so you dont gain anymore, until you feel like finaly excersicing to lose weight.<br>  As you grow up you learn not to care anymore because it does not bug you.

2sycPf8Daa	The heart has four chambers. In the lower left chamber (left ventricle), the aortic valve works like a one-way gate. When the heart pumps, the aortic valve opens to let oxygen-rich blood flow from the left ventricle into a large blood vessel called the aorta. Blood then flows through the aorta to the rest of the body.<br>  The right coronary artery ((abbreviated RCA) originates above the right cusp of the aortic valve. It travels down the right atrioventricular groove, towards the crux of the heart.<br>  The left coronary artery, (abbreviated LCA) and also known as the left main coronary artery (often abbreviated LMCA), arises from the aorta above the left cusp of the aortic valve.<br>  <br>  Take care as always|`|4lrdrWSpaa	They are for the right and left coronary arteries that feed blood to the heart itself.

4M2Yg5wlaa	Duac gel is a combination of benzoyl peroxide and clindamycin gels.  In general, the Duac is well tolerated, but it can create irritation.  This is mostly from the benzoyl peroxide.<br>  <br>  Benzoyl peroxide helps to fight the bacteria that cause acne and it also works as a drying agent.  This may be why you had initial burning.<br>  <br>  Typically the skin gets used to this drying effect (as it sounds like yours did) and then the burning goes away.  It is possible that due to weather changes (getting cold and dry outside) or other circumstances, that your skin has become more susceptible to irritation and this may be why the Duac is burning again.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure if you have added any other topical medications or facial products, but this may have resulted in possible irritation as well?<br>  <br>  It may help to temporarily decrease the use of the Duac from the recommended once a day to every other day for a while during which time the burning will hopefully go away.  Once it does, you can try to boost the application back up to once a day.<br>  <br>  If you wash your face prior to putting on the Duac it is best to use cooler water and allow you face to dry for 15-20 minutes prior to putting on the medication.  Tjhis will help reduce any irritation.  In addition, you could consider adding a moisturizer (something like Cetaphil lotion) to help with the burning as well.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.
4GNNOQeLaa	It all depends on how often you are taking your morphine and how much break through pain you are having.  If you are taking extended release morphine with immediate release for breath through pain then it may be easier for you to switch over to the Fentanyl patch.  The patch can be used for 72 hours with oral morphine used for break through pain.  If you do switch to the patch, when you dispose of it, fold it in half and throw away where a child or animal cannot get to it (don't flush).  Cost may also be an issue so see how much equal amounts of Fentanyl will cost compared to the same monthly dose of Morphine.|`|nEVoabeSaa	I never had Morphine prescribed, had a few injections but not prescribed on any daily basis.

Continue to watch the area for signs of infection|`|67dWrrH9aa	POPPPPP let it squirrtt|`|nt7yYFuOaa	When I had a blister from soccer, on my ankle, it popped. It just made the pain worse. I could put a bandage over it and it wouldn't help. So no! Don't pop unless you want more pain.|`|5cSD8mcZaa	No, do not pop it. It is your skin's way of cooling your burn.

Change the dressing regularly.|`|loqsl5xXaa	well it really doesn't matter to much.. however.. if you pop it you will more than likely get a scar and get an infection. if you leave it alone the pus and serum in it will go back it your body and take care of the blister itself.<br>  <br>  keep putting some cool water or compress on it so the skin can become tougher and it may still go down. i would just leave it!|`|rUk58ywKaa	In my experiences, if you pop a fresh blister it will only hurt worse.

lhHHg6ckaa	To the person who said you can't lose that much weight that fast, you absolutely can, and it's not an unhealthy rate. That's 80 pounds you want to lose in 6 months, which averages to about 13.33 pounds a month, or 3.33 pounds a week. If you have unhealthy eating habits now, simple changes will make a huge difference.<br>  <br>  Forget candy. If you can't, try to get your parents to buy those 100 calorie snack packs of cookies.<br>  <br>  Forget soda and fries. Giving those things up showed an IMMEDIATE result for me.<br>  <br>  Do your best to drink only water, occasionally fruit juice. Real juice. Try to stay away from things like Hawaiian Punch that are sugary "not-juices."<br>  <br>  Simple changes make a suprising difference.<br>  <br>  And seriously, keep it to 1200 calories a day, and be conscious of what you do to burn calories throughout the day. Maybe start walking to school? Or get up early and walk around the block every morning before school, if you live too far.|`|lc3w51jIaa	Drink tons of water.

9b3xkt36aa	Sounds like heart palpitations.  Palpitations are normal and can be brought on by many things.  Caffiene is one of them, along with stress and any other stimulants (Coffe is the worst).  If you get one every once in a blue moon and still feel fine....nada.  But...it sounds like yours are worth getting checked out.  See your family doctor and if he doesn't give you a specific answer ask for a referal to a Cardiologist.  They may do an EKG on ya to make sure the electrisity is flowing properly|`|XIuE1Bp5aa	Call your doctor or local cardiologist to see if there's a chance it could be anything serious, then eat some sugar to keep ur insulin up.
ZjhQ6PL8aa	Cardiac arrest's technical definition is the abrupt cessation of normal circulation of the blood due to failure of the heart to contract effectively during systole.  <br>  <br>  Basically the heart goes into pulseless VT, VF or asystole.  This prevents the delivery of oxygen to all parts of the body. Cerebral hypoxia causes the patient to lose consciousness and to stop breathing.  From there brain injury is likely if left untreated for more than 3-5 minutes, with the exception of a patient with hypothermia.  Cardiac arrest is a medical emergency that can potentially be reversed if treated in time.<br>  <br>  VT can still produce a beat it just may not be sufficient enough to produce a pulse however there are times when a patient does have a pulse and is sitting there talking to you and just not feeling good.  Long story short if you stick an AED on that person in VT with a pulse that AED will shock them because of the arrhythmia as it doesn't care about if the patient has a pulse or not.  VF is more of a quiver and asystole means you got nothing.|`|9b3xkt36aa	Cardiac arrest is when the heart completly stops beating|`|FEAeTMnfaa	Cardiac arrest is when the heart stops beating.|`|GPqjuawtaa	a sudden, sometimes temporary,pause of function of the heart

If you play with your clit (which is just above your vagina) it gives many girls extreme pleasure. Make sure you wash your hands before hand. If you don't want to directly touch yourself, try putting a pillow or stuffed animal between your legs and grinding up and down on it. Also some like to place ice cubes around and in their vagina because of the cold but remember that they do melt so you may have a bit of a mess. You could also try running water from your bath tub or shower head (removable works best) and allowing the warm water to run all over your breasts and vaginal area. Some women love to play with their nipples and breasts, while others get absoutley nothing from it. Just make sure your relaxed and that you have your door locked and closed if your parents are home. Or just go into the washroom. Some women also love to place small vibrarting objects directly on their clit which can give a very intense feeling. You can also use a CLEAN hair brush or other objects that resemble a penis to stick up your vagina but be very careful at first and make sure that the objects are VERY clean.<br>  A old vibrarting toothbrush can also work very well to place on your clit.<br>  Just take and slow and have fun.|`|vukRiS1Eaa	First off, congratulations for being brave enough to ask about this. It's easy to get embarrassed and then not find out what you need to know!<br>  <br>  As for ways to do it, you have several options:<br>  <br>  1. Fingers. They're the old standby, and they work. Focus on your clit--experiment with different speeds and pressures. Start by rubbing lying on your back, and then try lying on your stomach and grinding your hips to rub against your fingers. Experiment, and know this is how most women try it for the first time!<br>  <br>  2. Showerhead/bath faucet. A favorite of many girls. If you have a detachable showerhead, simply adjust the water temperature, lie down in the tub, point it at your clit, and enjoy! Note that the lying down part is important, especially if you're new to this--don't want to slip!<br>  <br>  3. Vibrator. No, you can't go out and buy one at your age from a sex shop. However, take a look at those "Face massagers" and "Back massagers" at Wal-Mart--believe me, they will do the trick. Again, focus on your clit (are you catching the theme here?).<br>  <br>  Above all else, have fun!|`|65sNdaoQaa	well, you have to be comfortable and relaxed.. if you have a tub you might want to try lying under the faucet, letting the water hit you clit with the perfect temp. and pressure for you. ( that always works for me!) <br>  <br>   and you can also try anything like a toothbrush to a back massager that vibrates and hold it down there..|`|FNeCDm3raa	Use your fingers.<br>  <br>  Put a pillow between your legs.<br>  <br>  Any object (that's safe) and resembles the size/shape of a penis.<br>  <br>  A shower head..hit the right spot and........wow.|`|eD9MdcPUaa	Try humping pillows. It's easy to do, just fold the pillow and put it in between your legs and hump away. Move back and forth on it, bounce on it, do whatever feels good. Make sure you put a towel over it though because you don't want your pillow to get *** all over it. Also, make sure your alone because the last thing you need is one of your parents coming in and catching you humping a pillow. Talk about embarrassing. Have fun!|`|k6yAZbIvaa	ive always used my fingers.  you can either move up and down on your vagina or go in a cicular motion, go slow or fast, do it above clothes or on skin, or you could just stick your finger up your vagina.  there are a lot of choices on what to do. just do what feels best. be relaxed. have fun!|`|171b43daae81abd1abec1351e3ec85e9aa	it really depends on Wat u like... use this website 4 tactics www.datingfun.com/sex/masturbation/techn...|`|e6qBT48xaa	well all i could tell u is just to explore ur body i do circular moves in slow and rapid speed try ur one and see how u like it.

A4MNmS9kaa	The thyroid hormone molecule hasTyrosine (an amino acid which you can buy OTC) at the centre with 4 iodine atoms hanging off that. A shorthand for this arrangement is T4. You can think of T4 more as your body's reservoir of thyroid hormone. If treated, this is what you are given, usually in a synthetic form. <br>  <br>  When it's needed, the body then knocks an iodine off to make T3, which is the really active form.  The enzyme that does this neat trick needs Selenium, and is poisoned by Mercury.<br>  <br>  You say you want something natural.  Did you know that there is a natural thyroid supplement, called Armour Thyroid? It contains T4 and T3,  in the human body's required ratio of about 4 to 1.   It's made in a standardised form from desiccated pig thyroid gland.  Don't be alarmed!  It's available on prescription in the US. I am in the UK and get a prescription for it, but I have to send that to a particular pharmacist who imports it from the US.  But it was a long journey to get outside the usual box of synthetic hormone replacement. Try the website in sources below for information. If your husband has tested low and  a doctor is convinced he needs hormone replacement, but you would rather do natural things, he may be lower than mere supplements can reach.  I have to say that although I tried all these things, and in theory they should work, since they meet the body's need for thyroid building blocks, I was still not well enough and needed the actual hormone.  But everyone is different.<br>  <br>  So you could try Tyrosine (say 500mg/day), Iodine (you can take too much iodine - be careful.  Kelp is a good source of natural iodine, to give you say 150micrograms iodine per day, I think), Selenium (say 200 micrograms per day) and keep your teeth free of mercury fillings if you can, and try to avoid contaminated fish (while still having enough omega3 oils of course!).<br>  <br>  Read any labels carefully regarding dose. I checked my supplies for all but the Kelp, which is not in the cupboard for some reason, but I think it's 150micrograms  <br>  <br>  This information is not intended to diagnose or treat any condition. You should always consult a qualified physician.  Unfortunately I have to say that!  This is a contentious subject.<br>  There are herbs that help too, but off the top of my head I can't remember them.  <br>  Good luck|`|CEKZsoFRaa	Vitamin C|`|hSOEgpPNaa	iodine tablets

YDykVkcmaa	There is a link between t-levels and sex but there is no 'optimum' number of orgasms.<br>  <br>  What ejaculation does is inform your body that you have a need for sufficient testosterone to ensure the continued manufacture of motile sperm. That amount of testosterone is regulated by your body as long as your body needs and can continue to manufacture it.<br>  <br>  However, your body does not continue to 'pump out' testosterone it also makes sure that you do not 'overdose'.<br>  <br>  So as long as you have sex on a regular basis (probably only really need it once a week to maintain t-levels) then you will have t-levels as high as your body will naturally allow.<br>  <br>  If you need higher levels than your body will produce naturally then you need some for of bio-identical testosterone supplementation.<br>  <br>  If you check out this site (<a href="http://www.hormonesolutions.com.au/" rel="nofollow">http://www.hormonesolutions.com.au/</a> ) you can find out all about what you may or may not need.|`|nc2emLCJaa	I do it at least 2 times a day,,<br>  it keeps me focused<br>  <br>  Just do what you think is good for you.<br>  <br>  its natural<br>  and helps keep the prostate healthy|`|5LyLuQRFaa	Whenever possible, dependent solely on the wife.|`|Y26eOD9Caa	I'm interested in hearing the answer to this one, myself.
BLD9EEWNaa	People hear voices because of a chemical imbalance or a brain problem, like schizophrenia.  Sometimes people don't want those voices to go away because that voice might be a really good friend, and be the only person who truly understands.  Imagine having a friend you knew everything in your head, and even better, understood and sympathized with it.  The real problem is that usually, the voices turn mean.  They can go from being friendly to criticizing everything and telling you to commit suicide.  Some people also want to keep the voices because they receive instructions from the voices, like when the world will end and what to do about it, etc...|`|7XweQxIUaa	maybe junior is an imaginary friend....somebody encouraging maybe???<br>  <br>  he likes junior so if he wants to talk to junior then let him|`|YfIm4IqSaa	He clearly has some degree of psychosis.

Based on the details you've given it sounds like he is not using illegal substances. Psychiatry would generally state that genetic factors are the biggest risk for such problems, but then there is anti-psychiatry which focuses on the dark side of psychiatry and it tends to state that disorders happen because of the power of suggestion, based on a psychiatrists ignorance.

ParFJxnSaa	It is much preferable to treat the anxiety. Limit "worrying time" to around 45 mns, daily, possibly when you get home, or after your evening meal, but not too close to bedtime) after which, resolve firmly to refuse to worry again on that day: realise and accept that to do otherwise would be counterproductive to your mental health, and enjoyment of life. You will have had your "worry time" for the day, and can just write down any more thoughts that come to mind, and say to yourself: "Well, I'll just have to worry about that tomorrow, won't I?". It's important to regularly monitor, and deal with a negative internal monologue (self talk), or mental process, such as disturbing thoughts, images, impulses, or emotions, by the process of (a): recognising it, and (b): challenging it immediately. Technique For Re-Programming Negative Thoughts: When you notice something negative, such as: "I can't do this/ am never going to get over this!" or: "Why am I always so pathetic/useless/such a loser?" or even an image, emotion, or a memory; recognise that it is being generated from the negative part of your mind. Having identified and labelled it, visualise a large, red, flashing, "STOP!" sign, and/or possibly a stern faced person wagging an index finger at you in a negative manner, then say to yourself as forcefully as you can, even aloud in a big voice, if alone: "I know this tactic: GO AWAY FOR A WHILE !!!" You may want to use either: "ruse", "ploy", "game", or "trick". In the case of an image, visualise a large "STOP" sign, or your preferred version. <br>  <br>  Some people go so far as to keep a wide rubber band in their pocket, then put it around their wrist, when they catch themselves backsliding, stretch and release it, as a method of reprogramming their mind sooner, but I don't regard it as being strictly necessary. Remember to remove it, afterwards, if you use this method. Try replacing a negative thought with a positive affirmation of your choice, like: "I am a unique individual, with my own set of skills, and good points", or "I may not be perfect, but I'm doing the best I can, right now". Practice one of the relaxation methods in sections 11, 2, 2c, or 2i, daily, and when needed. Tai Chi, or yoga suits others better. Give the EFT a good tryout, to see if it helps you. There is a version for use in public places, (you can claim to have a headache, as you massage/lightly tap your temples, but you would then be restricted to subvocalising: saying it to yourself in your mind). Section 53, at <a href="http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris" rel="nofollow">http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris</a> refers: "Even though I sometimes suffer from anxiety, I deeply and completely accept myself." Or Google: "neurofeedback; therapists" Herbal remedies, such as chamomile, passionflower, or St. John's wort, are often effective, but the idea is (as with anxiolytic medication) to use them like water wings, or training wheels on a bicycle, providing initial support, and giving time for other treatments, such as therapy, and relaxation techniques, to take effect.|`|gkqmrIAGaa	If you are only getting sick while on the school bus it may just be motion sickness try one an hour before you get the bus. That should stop it. But if it doesn't you need a psychiatrist for a correct diagnosis and treament. This may just be a problem that the Dramamine may help. It is not for anxiety it is for the nausea and vomiting caused by riding in a car or bus which is motion sickness.

These are some of the symptoms that will present if her shunt were malfunctioning, and her intracranial pressure were rising.  Altered level of conciousness is one of the last things you see. If her shunt has a button on it, ask your parents to push it to see if it refills.  This cannot be done often, but if it refills within two minutes it means that the valve is open.

The doctor needs to talk to her and find out why she is cutting herself. The doctor needs to get to the root of her problem. You can always talk with your daughter alone and ask her what's going on and if she would like to talk, but you need to get her some professional help|`|ParFJxnSaa	A previous answer follows: View the suggestions on what to do about self harming, in section 16, at <a href="http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris" rel="nofollow">http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris</a> and contact them, when you feel the need to self harm/cut. Use one of the alternatives shown, such as snapping a rubber band against your wrist, or holding an ice cube. There is much information, and useful weblinks in the website: far too much to fit in the allowable space here. Seek therapy, to help you address the actual cause of those problems, rather than using an inappropriate method of treating the symptoms, which others have found, doesn't work, in the longer term, and that leaves behind the extra problem of scarring to deal with, then. There is also a selection of treatments for scarring shown. So, are you aware of why you self harm? <br>  <br>  The reasons generally given are: depression (see section 2, at ezy build; page R first, then, if female; page V, young women's depression, & teen? depression; eventually the rest); if male; male depression; anger (see section 4; page C first), attention seeking, or boredom (suggestions for both are in section 16). Stress is addressed in section 42, at ezy build; view the COMPREHENSIVE POST on page i, first, then the rest of that section. Consider taking up amateur abstract, impressionist, or surrealist art, clay modelling, designing and/or making fashion, or jewellery. Journalling those thoughts, and feelings, poetry, or story writing are some more options. No-one has to see them, but you may well surprise yourself at how good you become, with experience. Even if not, and you are totally dissatisfied with every single effort, it will still have served its purpose.

Cutting is a stress reliever or at least for me it is. I have a hard time dealing with stress/emotions/feelings. When I feel stressed I get very strong "urges" to cut because after I do it I don't feel like I did before. Its euphoric its hard to explain if you've never done it. I would say that you should try to get help ASAP! I never did and it has become an addiction whenever I am stressed that is all I can think of. Things though that have helped were/are that I type a little "journal" in microsoft word on my laptop just venting out feelings and such its works you might want to let your daughter do that and just let her keep it to herself don't read it just let it be her own little venting notebook it doesn't have to make sense just anything thats on my mind I type, watch a movie, call a friend, or just take a nap! I am 22 and started when I was 18. My biggest problem is/was that I never told anyone with the exception of a few close friends that I do it my family doesn't know. So I never got help when I first started and it just escalated so all I can say is from a person who knows a bit about this please please get help for her before it turns into an addiction and its all she can think about.

It is your RIGHT to expect to be SAFE from attack - sexual, physical, emotional - regardless of your poor decision, in getting high / drunk.You can tell general facts, omit names and places, if you so choose - BUT, you must get this off your chest, or it will crush you.Please, take care of yourself.|`|mViaFhVVaa	awrh hon!<br>  i know how you feel but you must inform your parent, if thats too difficult is there an aunt, uncle, nana or older cousin or something?<br>  You know that is a male has sex with a female whilst she is intoxicated and cannot make her own decisions it is classes as rape.

You need to tell someone, whether it be a school counselor, a police officer or one of your parents.  No one should be allowed to get away with this.|`|QxjdJOMaaa	i would suggest talking to someone, this is a very serious matter. i wouldn't consider those girls as your friends....at least be a bit more careful with them. what he did to would be considered rape but since you drank it might not be. i would suggest to talk to a counselor but that might get yourself some enemies if you get them in trouble....so instead if you have other friends that are trustworthy or your parents might be okay. but they might kill you for drinking (kidding about that kill)....they would be angry...how about you act calm, you may be a bit emotional right now, but you have to make them know that you are strong. they may not even remember what they did to you! but if you are angry which i think you may be, i suggest you get your anger out by boxing or any sport where you hit something..(imagine the object you are hitting is one of your "pals") i think you should talk to your parents though.|`|tZrRxpFLaa	First off, -hugs-<br>  <br>  I can understand how you're feeling. You're feeling angry, you have every right to want to end your friendship with them. Real friends take of their friends, they don't leave them alone with a guy when they're already drunk and high.<br>  <br>  Now, at least you've learned now to not take extra shots just because people are egging you on. Did you say no to the guy who fingerbanged you? Or were you too drunk to remember? If you did, you could press charges on him for unwanted sexual contact. <br>  <br>  All you can do now is be extra cautious of you hang around, make sure you can trust them first. I really hope nothing like this ever happens to you again. :(
PAvYZJK2aa	advanced masturbation has more|`|u8CFwtyMaa	I don't know what you have tried, but if it's just the basic up and down with the hand, it can get a bit boring.<br>  Try to stimulate other parts of your body, rub your chest, especially around your nipples, your sides, and stomach. Also try your inner thighs, between your legs, and your buttocks. You can start this with both hands, and when you are erect, start rubbing your penis with one hand, and the rest of your body with the other. You'll soon find which bits you like best.<br>  As you get going, you can massage your testicles, and also, the bit behind your scrotum, between your testicles and your anus.<br>  You might even like to rub a finger over, or even into, your anus, don't worry, it's not gay - loads of men like it, use some lube on the finger.<br>  If you have a detachable shower head, squat down, and spray the water up behind your scrotum, and over your anus.<br>  You can make a ring out of your thumb and first finger, and use that to massage the base, or edge, of the glans (knob), you'll need lube for this, use spit if you have nothing else.<br>  I don't know if you have tried looking at porn, that may help.<br>  There are a couple of websites that have loads of information and tips -<br>  www.jackinworld.com<br>  and<br>  www.advancedmasturbation.com<br>  the second one has videos.<br>  You may have to try some techniques several times to get them right, and some may not work for you, but just keep trying until you get something that works for you.<br>  Hope this helps|`|e7410cdd309fbe8be4f14fa845e27703aa	1.

BUI2nlUVaa	You most likely have APS, or Antiphospholipid Syndrome associated with your Lupus.  You should have been checked out for this at the onset of your Lupus diagnosis but you most likely weren't.  Approximately 50% of people with Lupus have APS but less than half are actually tested for it.  It's a simple but specific blood test.  This clotting disorder can be fatal for both mother and child during pregnancy.  Most likely the spontaneous abortions that you're having are as a result of a blood clot across the placenta.  The therapy for this is lovenox, an IM (shot) blood thinner, and aspirin.  After the pregnancy you'll be switched to Coumadin (Warfarin), a blood thinner in pill form.  <br>  <br>  Hopefully you have been seeing your rheumatologist and high risk OB/GYN to come up with a plan for the best time for you to become pregnant.  You need to be in remission from your Lupus and need to be in good health.  The chances of having a flare while pregnant and immediately following are greatly increased.  Most doctors would recommend against having another child as you already took a great risk having the first.  Adoption would be a viable solution as would surrogacy.  If I were you I would look into those options, especially if APS is diagnosed.<br>  <br>  Good Luck to you.|`|rmHDABOzaa	I also live with lupus and my heart goes out to you. I highly recommend two things:<br>  <br>  1. Make sure you are closely monitored by a rheumatologist before, during and after any pregnancy.<br>  <br>  2. See a naturopathic physician for a complete nutrition plan. This doctor will prescribe certain foods that will significantly decrease any lupus symptoms you have and may make medications unneccessary. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|umca7pwoaa	Have you been tested for Lupus Anticoagulant?? It's a blood clotting disorder that 50% of Lupus patients have. Lupus Anticoagulant works with Antiphospholipid Antibody Syndrome (another clotting disorder) and are both known to cause frequent/recurrent miscarriages. I have Lupus Anticoagulant and Antiphospholipid Antibody Syndrome therefore i've been seeing a high risk obstetrician during my pregnancy. These two diseases are very common with lupus and definitely could be the problem. Treatment for them generally involves a baby aspirin and Lovenox injections while pregnant (that's what i've been using so far). If I were you I would consult my doctor about these conditions if you haven't been checked for them already. I hope you don't have them, but I felt like this is information that may help you.|`|NKBu3CdDaa	If your doctor can't provide you with the knowledge or advice on how to keep a healthy pregnancy there is no use continually putting your body through hell.  My advice would be to have a talk with your obgyn and in worst case scenario, adopt!  Good luck
zazJs9loaa	Z, you can not just quit taking it Cold Turkey. That is the worst part of it all. You will be feeling like that for several days. Trust me I have been taking Norco (hydrocodne) for years and sometimes I get low and cut back a bit I start to feel the pain and all the syptoms that you mentioned. Best thing to do would cut back everyday. For example one week take what you are supposed too, and the next week take half of that. The third week take half of the half and so for. Best thing to do is start taking it again and slowely decrease your dosage little by little. Hope that helps.|`|831e735ba92bb0dfd3b16be0d4995ccfaa	I went cold turkey, I thought my doctor wa over stating the injury it could have on me until I read up on it.

WEM5n41Oaa	Sometimes it's hard to control.  If you don't think about sex you most likely won't get an erection unless your penis is rubbing against your pants and it feels good.

If a girl turns you on in some way you don't need to think about sex to get a hard on.|`|0usYKmX9aa	most guys cant control it, and if a guy gets aroused it doesn't mean he wants to have sex, its just something that happens sometimes|`|XAkLPdhqaa	It's mainly in the guy's mind, but having a sexy bod nearby will contribute to a nice *****.|`|AA12022261	umm you got to do something to trigger the --> reflex <--|`|9nilTbW9aa	both. thinking really hard can make it hard|`|zOIgzIy4aa	you can make it hard if you know what to do. sometimes it gets hard just by looking at you. it usually mean that he wants sex.|`|W6pT1Wp3aa	my bf always says he wishes he could control it so that must mean they can't
KzJz17Rxaa	Any "diet" that requires you omit or severely limit an entire food group will fail in the long run. I define a successful diet as something you do for the rest of your life rather than something you just do for however long.<br>  <br>  If your goal is to lose weight then you need to consume fewer calories than you expend.<br>  <br>  To find out how many calories you require to maintain your weight go here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.caloriecontrol.org/calcalcs.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.caloriecontrol.org/calcalcs.h...</a><br>  <br>  Once you know how many calories you need subtract 300-500. That will be the amount of calories you need to consume in order to lose weight.<br>  <br>  I always suggest that folks start here:<br>  <a href="http://www.mypyramid.gov/STEPS/stepstoahealthierweight.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mypyramid.gov/STEPS/stepstoah...</a><br>  <br>  That is the mypyramid.gov website. It is a great place to go for basic information as to what to eat and how much of each food group. It also tells you what foods belong to what food groups.<br>  <br>  I would also highly suggest you track your food intake. Most people don't realize how many calories they are actually consuming. Studies indicate that most people underestimate by at least 500 calories a day. That adds up to mucho pounds over time!<br>  <br>  And just think, what if you are actually underestimating the number of calories you eat? You might be able to get more food if you only knew exactly how many calories you were eating<br>  <br>  And no, you don't have to track and log food forever. Just long enough until you have an idea of how much you should be eating and what calorie level works best for you. After a while you get to know how many calories you're eating because we pretty much all have a fairly limited number of foods we eat on a regular basis. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.nutritiondata" rel="nofollow">http://www.nutritiondata</a> and <a href="http://www.fitday.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.fitday.com</a> are great places to track your food and calorie intake fairly easily.<br>  <br>  There is no right or wrong diet for every person. We are all different. I've tried many popular diet programs. None worked for me because oddly, I require more calories than most diets allow. I also have to limit my carbohydrates - even the healthy ones like whole grains. My body just doesn't respond well to them. For others carbohydrates aren't a problem. That's why I always suggest starting with the basics as laid out in the food pyramid. If that doesn't work then you can begin to change things up - limit carbs, increase protein, eat more, eat less...it will all depend on the individual. You just need to start with the basics first.|`|6jSxYrZnaa	It depends on what you mean by "doesnt take away everything" A successful diet does take away things. The key is avoiding grains starches and sugars. It is this stuff that makes you gain and retain bodyfat. <br>  <br>  The diets that work are low carb, high protein, moderate fat. They work because this is how humans are supposed to eat. Bread is unnatural, cereal is unnatural. These foods promote ill-health and make you fat. Vegetables are natural, lean meat is natural. These foods make you healthy and lose bodyfat. Simple. <br>  <br>  If you want "named diets" that work then I can recommend either the Zone or Paleo. Or Paleo foods at Zone prescriptions. If you feel hungry on those "diets", then you're doing them wrong.|`|vEHP8JySaa	this looks pretty interesting|`|7H4f32heaa	We all know that what you eat is pretty important when trying to lose weight, but finding a successful plan can be tough.<br>  <br>  How much would you lose if you had the exact diets that winners from The Biggest Loser followed?<br>  <br>  Ray Kelly is an Exercise Physiologist from Australia, who trained not 1, but 2 Biggest Loser winners!<br>  <br>  In his new report he outlines the exact foods these champions ate in the leas up to jumping onto the scales for the final time.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://tinyurl.com/gotease" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/gotease</a><br>  <br>  But that's not all this expert has provided.

I always believe that to maintain yourself healthy you should drink as much water as your body graves. I also believe you should drink more fluids or liquids during illnesses because they help flush out bacteria and viruses from you body. In addition, your kidneys don't suffer as much when you drink a lot of water.|`|BMfQ0KMtaa	How Much Water do You Need to Drink?<br>  A good estimate is to take your body weight in pounds and divide that number in half. That gives you the number of ounces of water per day that you need to drink. For example, if you weigh 160 pounds, you should drink at least 80 ounces of water per day. If you exercise you should drink another eight ounce glass of water for every 20 minutes you are active. If you drink alcohol, you should drink at least an equal amount of water. When you are traveling on an airplane, it is good to drink eight ounces of water for every hour you are on board the plane. If you live in an arid climate, you should add another two servings per day. As you can see, your daily need for water can add up to quite a lot.<br>  <br>  Twenty percent of your water need will come from the foods you eat. The rest of your water need should come from the beverages you drink. Water is the best choice. Sodas have a lot of sugar in them, so if you drink sodas, you may take in more calories than you need. Herbal teas that aren't diuretic are fine. Sports drinks contain electrolytes and may be beneficial, just look out for added sugar and calories that you don't need. Juices are good because they have vitamins and nutrients.<br>  <br>  Caffeinated beverages will also add to your daily water need. Even though caffeine is a diuretic, if you regularly consume caffeine, your body will regulate itself to that diuretic effect. <br>  <br>  Edit:  If you liked my (correct) answer, please mark it as "best answer" when you can. <br>  <br>  I'm new here and I need points to ask my questions!|`|82c20274c9f2c8d366cec14496018154aa	keep in mind that your body can only process a certain amount of water per our i think its about one large glass per hour or something|`|4a5e6710a48bf2552818efa224ab69cdaa	A simple guideline is one ounce of water per pound of body weight each day.

NPpalf1Gaa	This could be caused by a lot of things.. if your jaw does not normally hurt then you may have just grinded your teeth while you slept at night or you could have a cavity. Either those or you may have chewed on something that was to hard or irritated your teeth. <br>  If this pain does not go away within a day or you notice it reoccurring, I would say definitely schedule an appointment with your dentist and have them take a look at it.

Now that I'm older, my blood pressure stays steady at 120 / 80, and they don't seemed disturbed by it at all, so, your 120 / 70 sounds just that much better.  But then, I wonder how much age has to do with your BP.

ETcBRko3aa	My psychiatrist is my EX-psychiatrist because she was a total rude, uncaring, condescending *****.  She thought her "**** did not stink" and I was sick of it.  Plus, she kept charging for everything.  If you sat in the chair and not on the couch, you paid an extra $50.  *****.  NEXT.<br>  <br>  I have to find another one because I take alot of Bipolar meds and need prescriptions for them.   I had a shrink a couple years ago that was fabulous.  She was kind and caring and actually listened to me.  She did not last very long in her job because to make money, you have to see patients in 15 minutes or less, and the good shrink actually liked to spend time with her patients, so they fired her.<br>  <br>  <br>  I also think my therapist is a big waste of money.  She did not help me with anything and actually made me feel WORSE about myself.  <br>  <br>  All mental health practitioners are screwed up themselves.  You need to be very very careful when finding one.|`|29e999153715416dcc6bab042f16f0c4aa	I don't think my psych makes me feel special or like a number. He is right in between. The session is over in under ten minutes so there isn't much room for personal talk. Everytime I'm there he asked the same questions like "how are your moods," "is your mind playing tricks on you," and "what do the voices say?" That sort of stuff. And depending on what I tell him he may give me a med change or a dosage increase.<br>  <br>  I think he is caring as the last few times he had to cancel my appointments to which he apologized for and he even disclosed to me the reason why due to his brother dying. <br>  <br>  It's true they are there for the money, but how many people do you know that would work for free? I sure wouldn't work for free. <br>  <br>  I know I'm a number on the hospital records, but as far as feeling special I don't think psychs are there for that purpose. They are there to help you get over whatever you need getting over. <br>  <br>  Sure there are some bad ones out there as well. In the end if he helps me keep the voices, paranoia ideation, suicidal ideation, and depression down the the minimum then I'd say he is doing his job. <br>  <br>  I go there because I want to get better not becuase I'm some stuck up teenager who doesn't appreciate what his or her parents are trying to do for them. I'm 25 now and have been seeing my psych for two years without any professional relationship problems. He will even review my records if I call in with problems and make changes to help me.<br>  <br>  I suppose I wrote a little more than you needed to know, but I hope people will not get discouraged from seeing a psych because of some of these answers on this post that are anti psychiatry. The way I see it if you didn't get helped in the first place then there is a chance that you may have had nothing wrong with you to begin with.|`|STumBiU0aa	he doesnt make me feel line a number.  Hes not overyly personal though because, as his job requires, our relationship is professional - i think thats pretty standard among everyone who has a psychiatrist - they are not overly cold but at the same time not overly personal.  I feel as if my psychiatrist cares about me enough to effectively help me, but not in a creepy overly personal way if that makes sense.  and in responce to bananara, my psychiatrist percribes me anti-anxiety meds because i have an anxiety disorder.  He also teaches me how to cope with anxiety using lifestyle changes, relaxation techniques and other non medical things.  If I stopped taking my pills OR doing the relaxation techniques etc, i would not be in good shape in terms of my anxiety level so i think that ppl need both pills AND nom medical therapy.  To say that pills do not help, and mental illness is made up, is false because pills help a lot of ppl!!!|`|ZsKrYCYCaa	I knew Barbie would be seeing a shrink sooner than later, too many boyfriends, not enough condoms, and all those missing limbs in the dream house.|`|4EZis4lWaa	more like...she's humoring me.  if I want meds, she gives me meds, but she doesn't believe anything I tell her.

rLJZX9GPaa	Well, you need to stop the bleeding and then seek emergency services.<br>  You should apply a damp towel or something similar to the wound and apply pressure. If it has been bleeding for 15 minutes then you will have most likely slightly cut an artery or hit a blood vessel. Just try to relax and don't panic about the amount of blood. I would advise you go to hospital or general practice as soon as possible. Don't drive yourself, get a neighbor or relative to do it for you. The last thing you want is to crash or lose concentration on the road. If you are finding it too hard to slow the bleeding then call an ambulance.<br>  <br>  If you are waiting for a relative, neighbor or friend to arrive. I would advise you frequently flush your wound with cold water. NO Soap or other mild detergents. Apply pressure and wait. <br>  <br>  If the bleeding stops then keep a very close eye on it and apply an antiseptic. I would advise even if you don't want to, is to go the doctor  as you could get tetanus or a nasty infection that could cause serious problems.<br>  <br>  If you have any issues then please state on your question.<br>  Happy to help.|`|cdf9bde60acfd0a622e4bbdccdc9e515aa	Lots of compression with a towel.

c8ebe8705eaf13a28547213ca1de8013aa	You most definitely need to see your physician.  Renal (kidney) disease affects the blood pressure and its treatment.  Blood pressure is under the control of the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus (I do not make these names up).  It follows what we refer to as diurnal circadian variation.  It is lowest during sleep with the highest peak around 11 AM and a second peak at around 4 PM.  The most accurate and reproducible blood pressure is obtained first thing in the AM.  By this I mean you wake up - go to the bathroom - and take your blood pressure.  In this setting there is a well established goal of 115/075 mm Hg or less.  For every 20/10 mm Hg above this there is a doubling of cardiovascular risk.  Thus a first thing in the AM blood pressure of 135/085 (which may sound quite normal) implies twice the cardiovascular risk of someone with a blood pressure of 115/075 mm Hg.  Many factors influence a blood pressure reading and thus the first thing in the morning blood pressure is preferred.  A blood pressure as high as 200/120 mm Hg would by definition hypertension and require treatment no matter when you took the reading or the circumstances surrounding the reading such as activity, stress, caffeine intake, and so on.  You must see your physician and bring with you your blood pressure readings.  It would be most helpful it you noted the date and time of day that the readings were taken.  It is helpful to know that your blood pressure unit has been checked for accuracy.  Again - please see your physician promptly.  I wish you the very best of health and may God Bless.|`|AA11091145	Yes, you should make an appointment.  Anything over 140/90 and you should be on medication.  140/90 or less and you could try diet and lifestyle changes if you have the willpower.  Because you have kidney problems and your blood pressure is extreme at times, you should be on blood pressure medication for sure.  <br>  <br>  You need to be on an ACE inhibitor or ARB type medication which will lower your blood pressure and protect your kidneys at the same time.  You should also get a scan of your kidneys.<br>  <br>  Take several readings at the same time of day (morning) over several weeks and write them down.  Bring the list to your doctor.  If your mom or dad have high blood pressure, I would insist on medication.|`|c9a1b864f1a97925067a5a7737860ac4aa	200 over 120 is dangerously high.

When they intervene surgically there is a whole other complex of issues that have arose , If you did something to the tendon they will usually go in and clean it out .

Therefore, if someone planted some seeds today, in 3-months when they were harvesting, they can easily call it "Pineapple Express" thus, giving rebirth to the weed, and making it an actual weed. Purple Haze, Blueberry Bud, none of it exists anymore, hell even White Widow is in extinction, although they have many copy-cats of the weed, in which they rename that weed as Purple Haze, etc, and people believe it.

b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	If you are going for your first pap smear, it is uncomfortable but not painful. They will take your blood pressure and weigh you. Then they will ask you lots of questions about your health and when your last period was. Then they have you put on a paper gown and get ready for the doctor. When the doctor comes in he may ask some questions about your health. He will discreetly check your breasts for lumps. There will always be a nurse or lady in the room with you and if there isn't and you want one, ask. Then they will put your feet in stirrups with your legs open and he will put two fingers into your vagina and push on your ovaries to check them. Then they will insert a speculum into your vagina and take a long q-tip and take a sample from your cervix. It doesn't hurt but is a little uncomfortable. Sometimes they will put a gloved finger into your anus to check to see that everything is okay there. Then it is over.<br>  <br>  During the procedure, the doctor will probably talk to you about your life or family and try to keep your mind off what he is doing. If you try hard to relax and take deep breaths, it is less uncomfortable. <br>  <br>  Don't be embarrassed, it is nothing compared to giving birth and being in labor, when it seems everyone is checking your vagina.<br>  <br>  I prefer a lady doctor, but either will take good care of you and be totally professional.<br>  <br>  best wishes..|`|451c455bd077166a1cd91fe42a1d17baaa	you only need it do if you are sexually active,,,,,or over 20 in most country|`|FeYTPqd1aa	1. It might hurt a little, but I find its more of a pressure feeling than a painful feeling.  Its a little awkward at first, but you get used to it.<br>  2. It takes just a few minutes for the actual exam.<br>  3. It all depends on what you're comfortable with.  I am only comfortable with a female doctor, but my friend only feels comfortable with male doctors.  Everyone has their own preference.<br>  4. Don't be afraid to ask questions.  Remember the day you're last period started, they always ask so the doctor knows where you are in your cycle.|`|PImvmP1paa	Okay.<br>  <br>  1. If you are relaxed you'll only fell a little jab, that barely hurts. It's uncomfortable but it doesn't hurt.<br>  <br>  2. The wait (with my doctor) in the exam room is the longest. However, the pelvic exam will probably take about 2 or 3 minutes.<br>  <br>  3. Depending on how old you are, and what gender you'd most likely feel more comfortable with. There were 3 doctors in the office that I go to. 2 male and one female. I felt most comfortable with the female. Then again I've only seen one male doctor and not the other male doctor. You'd have to get a gynecologist.<br>  <br>  4. Have your mother go on with you the first time that you go.

If you are nervous you will tense up your muscles and it will be more uncomfortable. Keep breathing, don't hold your breath.   Actually there are benefits for going to a woman doctor or nurse practitioner.  First of all they have smaller hands and secondly  they have had pap smears and pelvics done to them so they are more sympathetic to you.  Also there may be a little less of an embarrassment factor for you.|`|QQSiqQV0aa	it is not painful, it is more uncomfortable than anything. the actual exam does not take that long and as for Dr. preference you should choose either an male or a female based on your comfort level, some women a embarrassed with a male Dr. other info for your first exam is to be honest when filling out your background information, be as honest as possible, the information about you and your exams are confidential between you and your Dr. pap smears are not as bad as they sound.|`|rlWZtKx2aa	It doesn't hurt, but it can be uncomfortable.  sometimes a little blood after is normal.  cramping is normal.

6fjMtWboaa	Usually 11 to 14 days after your period you begin to ovulate and will have a milky discharge, indicating you are fertile.  But if this doesn't apply to you, I would recommend you seeing the dr.|`|Dg0D8SCZaa	normal. if it bothers you, you can wear panty liners so that you can just change them if you feel uncomfortable.|`|l7GjBVvhaa	It's normal to have some vaginal discharge, as the vagina stays moist as part of its self-cleansing mechanism. The normal moist discharge clears dead cells and bacteria from the vagina.<br>  <br>  The amount of normal discharge varies from woman to woman, and with the menstrual cycle. Many women notice that during the week after a period there is hardly any discharge, and what there is has a thick consistency. Towards the middle of the cycle (about 2 weeks after the start of a period) the amount increases and it becomes thin, slippery and clear, like uncooked egg white. When this discharge is exposed to the air it becomes brownish-yellow, so it is normal to find a yellowish stain on your undies at the middle of the monthly cycle. There may also be a feeling of moistness and stickiness. Normal discharge doesn't smell, and does not cause any irritation or itching<br>  <br>  If your discharge is of an odd smell, stings your vagina, burns while you pee, or is not a clear/milky color then ask to make an appt with the doctor Hun.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Be seeing you............|`|AA12385489	Normal discharge.<br>  Don't worry about it.|`|RFUgLmxyaa	That's completely normal and how most girls are.|`|7x9lvbhAaa	are you a vigin if not could me STD|`|G9831g5Baa	It's normal discharge.

But steam and drinking broth soups with veggies and eating fruit, keeping hands and body clean is the best way.<br>  <br>  Make sure you breathe in and out slowly.  The key is to get those viruses to leave the premises (your body) as quickly as possible.<br>  <br>  Vit C, fast on soups, water and hot lemon and honey and lots of rest.<br>  <br>  Colds are terrible but you don't have to catch them and you don't have to keep them if you follow these rules.<br>  <br>  Now do some of this and then go lay down.

But when I started getting arthritis, everyday life became difficult. The more I walked the worse it [the arthritis pain] got, the pain was like a knife twisting inside. Sometimes my knee would give out, it just wouldn't support me. Then there was the sharp pain. Before surgery, the pain was absolutely debilitating. I was getting totally disabled. I couldn't walk. I couldn't stand. That's when I decided that I needed to do something. Once at church I met an very old friend of mine who suffered from the same pain as mine and that’s when she recommended me Fly2india4health Consultants in India , my first thought about surgery in India was fear. I researched on my condition and my possible treatment options. I also spoke with the associate orthopedic surgeon with Fly2india4health Consultants who gave me educational material to help set my expectations after surgery. I was also been told that I would be up the same day as surgery and I was. The most important thing after the surgery is exercise. After surgery, I didn't have to take a lot of pain medication - maybe for 2 or 3 days. I attribute that to the skill of my surgeon. I was driving two weeks after surgery, Had I known it was going to be this easy, I would have had it done much earlier. If u need any orthopaedic care I will certainly advice you to go to Fly2india4health Consultants!<br>  <br>  Source:<br>  <a href="http://www.fly2india4health.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.fly2india4health.com</a>

This pretty much insures that the hind brain (controls breathing, heart rate and many major motor functions) will be destroyed first and then the bullet would pass into the fore brain and render you unconscious and mindless.<br>  Having destroyed the hind brain first; even if your victim could regain consciousness, there would be no respiration or heartbeat.|`|URkTlFteaa	It really matters where you get shot.

Your joy or your sorrow for all eternity depends upon your answer. The question is: Are you saved? It is not a question of how good you are, nor if you are a church member, but are you saved? Are you sure you will go to Heaven when you die? <br>  God says in order to go to Heaven, you must be born again. In John 3:7, Jesus said to Nicodemus, "Ye must be born again." <br>  In the Bible God gives us the plan of how to be born again which means to be saved. His plan is simple! You can be saved today. How? <br>  First, my friend, you must realize you are a sinner. "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God" (Romans 3:23). <br>  Because you are a sinner, you are condemned to death. "For the wages [payment] of sin is death" (Romans 6:23). This includes eternal separation from God in Hell. <br>  " . . . it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment" (Hebrews 9:27). <br>  But God loved you so much He gave His only begotten Son, Jesus, to bear your sin and die in your place. " . . . He hath made Him [Jesus, Who knew no sin] to be sin for us . . . that we might be made the righteousness of God in Him" (2 Corinthians 5:21). <br>  Jesus had to shed His blood and die. "For the life of the flesh is in the blood" (Lev. 17:11). " . . . without shedding of blood is no remission [pardon]" (Hebrews 9:22). <br>  " . . . God commendeth His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us" (Romans 5:8). <br>  Although we cannot understand how, God said my sins and your sins were laid upon Jesus and He died in our place. He became our substitute. It is true. God cannot lie. <br>  My friend, "God . . . commandeth all men everywhere to repent" (Acts 17:30). This repentance is a change of mind that agrees with God that one is a sinner, and also agrees with what Jesus did for us on the Cross. <br>  In Acts 16:30-31, the Philippian jailer asked Paul and Silas: " . . . 'Sirs, what must I do to be saved?' And they said, 'Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved . . . .' " <br>  Simply believe on Him as the one who bore your sin, died in your place, was buried, and whom God resurrected. His resurrection powerfully assures that the believer can claim everlasting life when Jesus is received as Savior. <br>  "But as many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on His name" (John 1:12). <br>  "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved." (Romans 10:13). <br>  Whosoever includes you. Shall be saved means not maybe, nor can, but shall be saved. <br>  Surely, you realize you are a sinner. Right now, wherever you are, repenting, lift your heart to God in prayer. <br>  In Luke 18:13, the sinner prayed: "God be merciful to me a sinner." Just pray: "Oh God, I know I am a sinner. I believe Jesus was my substitute when He died on the Cross. I believe His shed blood, death, burial, and resurrection were for me. I now receive Him as my Savior. I thank You for the forgiveness of my sins, the gift of salvation and everlasting life, because of Your merciful grace. Amen." <br>  Just take God at His word and claim His salvation by faith. Believe, and you will be saved. No church, no lodge, no good works can save you. Remember, God does the saving. All of it! <br>  God's simple plan of salvation is: You are a sinner. Therefore, unless you believe on Jesus Who died in your place, you will spend eternity in Hell. If you believe on Him as your crucified, buried, and risen Savior, you receive forgiveness for all of your sins and His gift of eternal salvation by faith. <br>  You say, "Surely, it cannot be that simple." Yes, that simple! It is scriptural. It is God's plan. My friend, believe on Jesus and receive Him as Savior today. <br>  If His plan is not perfectly clear, read this tract over and over, without laying it down, until you understand it. Your soul is worth more than all the world. <br>  "For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul?" (Mark 8:36). <br>  Be sure you are saved. If you lose your soul, you miss Heaven and lose all. Please! Let God save you this very moment. <br>  God's power will save you, keep you saved, and enable you to live a victorious Christian life. "There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, Who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it" (1 Corinthians 10:13). <br>  Do not trust your feelings. They change. Stand on God's promises. They never change. After you are saved, there are three things to practice daily for spiritual growth:<br>  Pr|`|8gOIc4dMaa	Aww im really reaching out to you right now.

Zyrtec works better than any allergy medicine I have ever taken, but it makes me so drowsy and sleepy I can't function, and that's why I don't take it all the time instead.

But really, that doesn't work at all. It does tone the muscle but will not make the fat in that area go away. When fat burns, it burns all over the body. So you can't do anything specific to control one area and make it have less fat, unless you just lose weight in general. Of course I am not a doctor or a professional so their might be more to it that could help that I don't know of.|`|Oe7SOJyDaa	You cannot target weight loss areas unfortunately.  You gain more of your weight in your thighs instead of everywhere else which means that it can burned off just like it could anywhere else and it just happens to be on your thighs.  The only way that you can burn fat is cardio and healthy eating. if they just need to tighten up then all you really need to do is a lot of squats and lunges.  They are kinda old school but they really work in making ur legs a lot tighter.  They will build muscle and give definition but will not burn fat, in fact they will be underneath the fat unless you can burn the fat off and  only cardio can do that for you.

I started smoking for a year off and on and aftere a while, it starts getting to you. I hate the smell and its really not worth it. Your probably young but I'm 19 and I used to dip for a year as well. I stoped that because I got white cankersores and never did it again and just stopped smoking because I hate the smell and coughed up some green yellow brown mucus when I was sick..with a little bit of blood..yea<br>  be smart, usually it takes a personal event for someone to stop. I thought I was cool dipping...nope|`|h9ZQjnANaa	This is really stupid.  Just by this question, I can tell you're too young to smoke.  Probably too young to even buy cigarettes.  None are less harmful.  They all have an equal amount of toxins in them.  If you think that "light" cigarettes are better, think again.  They have a lighter taste thats all.  We've all gone through that stage.  Just stop..you're not going to look cool by doing it..you'll probably look stupid because you're either not inhaling, don't know how to hold it or you're choking all the time.|`|sZm5oisdaa	HI, I am 67 yrs. old. yes, I do smoke mostly at home now,thank to our state laws. best advice,find a cheap brand you like,cause soon we will have to choose "meat or cigs. this week". all smokers know this answer sad to say but,it is "our choice" If this is the only thing bad I do,so be it .|`|1KqknaUHaa	I don't know the answer to your question but c'mon!<br>  Please don't start smoking, it's very unattractive and obviously it's not good for you.<br>  <br>  I'm not trying to bash on you or anything, just asking you to stop while you can.<br>  <br>  :/|`|LIyESXtRaa	Paul, No cigarette is less harmful than another.  If you smoke low tar, low nicotine cigarettes, you end up smoking more, because the more you smoke, the more you need, so you end up not being satisfied with the nicotine content.  Nicotine works on the same receptors in the brain as heroine.  As an ex-smoker of seventeen years, I would urge you to stop now, before it's too late.  If you are young or old, it doesn't matter.  Smoking is a KILLER.  I watched my father die from lung cancer and trust me it's not pretty.  He was addicted and couldn't quit, and didn't really want to,  He always joked that at least he would know what he would die from.......when I reminded him of that during his illness, he cried and said it wasn't funny anymore.  I'm begging you, find another outlet for whatever is prompting you to smoke.  It limits your life in more ways than one.  It used to be cool to smoke, it's not anymore and you are treated like an outcast.  You will find yourself not wanting to go certain places because you can't smoke and you'll miss valuable time with family and friends, while you step out for a smoke.  The only one benefiting from your smoking is the tobacco companies and they are laughing all the way to the bank.  You already know the drill.  It's your choice.|`|XoDUTquWaa	STOP if you have just started. Don't wait until you become good and addicted. It's too damned hard to quit and they do not relieve stress. Actually nicotine is a stimulant which makes you feel more jittery and restless and can often interrupt sleep no different than caffiene. I have overcome many things but so far the nicotine addiction has been the devil to give up.|`|nAe0sYrsaa	it's your life so it's your decision..and  as you stated there aren't any cigs that aren't bad.  have fun loosing your capabilities to taste.breathe deep. digest properly.  have youthful skin, etc. etc.

PyQhb7gCaa	With your Herbalife intake itself you can lose weight well and efficiently if you do it rightly and consume it accordingly .. Take more Formula 3 for flabby skin dear ..<br>  <br>  Okay I’m sharing with you my own experience .. Actually I consume Herbalife every morning and night, means I replace both my meals and follow it strictly. I take 4 scoops of F1 and 2 scoops of F3 per shake with 400ml of water, which means, 8 F1 and 4 F3 per day. I lost 1kg for the first week. It's just that you must take your shakes well and no cheatings like snacking or eating in between your 3 main meal, breakfast, lunch, dinner. You will feel hungry as your eating style for your shake is not right, that's all. <br>  <br>  I didn't feel hungry at all or have the intentions to cheat and eat when I am hungry. If at all I feel hungry, I eat fruits, that's all. It's just as simple as that. I lost weight with the normal products which you all consume too, the F1, F3 and teamix. I drink 1 litre of tea per day, means 3 to 4 servings per day (250ml per time). You also must remember that when you make your shake, if you add soya or anything to it, you are actually going to add in more calories and sugar into your meal. So try to avoid this kind of things in your diet :) Anyway, it's just as simple as A-B-C.|`|rpSCHt8baa	Actually, you don't need to diet per se in order to lose weight, the only diet that clearly worked for me is wu-yi tea, it can be viewed in the resource box underneath, they have a small number of free trials left, it was featured in Fox News and USA Today. I melted away 25 pounds, it clearly does produce results!|`|GCIAjzShaa	wow im 16 and i weigh 132... gg nub
kpKBwOcnaa	To get over it is to firstly understand why you feel dirty. We all have personal values, they aren't all the same but sometimes when we do something that we feel has gone over our values we feel cheapened. how do you get over this, well learn from it. You now know where your values lay, albeit you have found out the hard way. the way to feel better is to realise at times we all cross out own personal boundaries, but sometimes that is how we discover where they actually lay, discovery of our true selves and what we really value is sometimes discovered through painful lessons. Learn how to be more assertive in saying no with respect and hindsight the next time this proposition comes up that it will hurt you if you do it. The feeling you have is saying to you, don't do that again. Live and learn and the next time you say no to these events in your life, you will reclaim your worth when you stand up for your own personal values, it will just take a bit of time and licking your wounds for a few weeks but you will get there. Hope that helps.|`|eCtrOR3Baa	First, realize that whats done is done and you can't change it. Second, I would recommend talking to the person you slept with and make sure all your intentions are clear. Tell him/her that you respect them as a coworker but feel you guys crossed the line and hope it doesn't effect your professional relationship. Chances are s/he is fine with it and will appreciate you bringing it up. Tell yourself that in the future you will watch your alcohol consumption to prevent this from happening again. Everyone makes mistakes, don't worry about it too much. Good luck.
