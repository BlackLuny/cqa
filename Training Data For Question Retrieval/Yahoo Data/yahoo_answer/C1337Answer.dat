I do and my anger control in the frontal lobe has been damaged.  Talk to your doctor and see if SSRI's are right for you.  It may simply be a matter of chemicals.|`|WjVsIqbPaa	no its not really normal..... at all|`|hZkLVF2Baa	Um, yes... it IS normal. People who are claiming that you have serious issues have serious issues themselves. As long as you are not acting out physically (well, except for that one incident) and it doesn't really upset and anger you for long periods of time, than you are okay.  I get angered by stupidity and ignorance easily as well and though I may feel extremely angry, I don't exactly want to beat the cr*p out of the person. It's frustrating.  If you have to try really hard to keep yourself from acting out physically, than you may have a problem. Otherwise, if it's just frustration there is nothing wrong.|`|zOyMnhiNaa	nooo. i get extrememely annoyed by ignorant, dumb people. i wanna just slap them so hard and knock some since into them.    if your anger is really physical, then go to an anger management class. they aren't that bad. my friend is going through one right now.
f401ea307e44f234284f4730f9d3f181aa	By today's standards, no it's not smart, since no one is willing to help if this happened, until the woman can get on her own two feet. But why bother marrying someone unless you had faith they'd be there till death did them part! I am a housewife, and I do have something to fall back on in case, but I don't contemplate this daily as he grew up in a good solid family and wouldn't dream of leaving us. In fact, it would probably be me doing the leaving since my mom divorced twice and was from one guy to another.|`|cWxwHMQWaa	The ones who aren't sure of their marriages might. I know my Mamma didn't have fears about being stranded by my Daddy.     Any relationship can turn without notice and fall apart, but when you take the time to choose your spouse carefully, I think you live without much fear of it ending suddenly...or much about it ending at all. It's nice when a couple chooses to work hard to keep a marriage going rather than having so little interest they just give up.    I'm definitely a supporter of people living together a while before marriage to be sure it's what they want. Kinda makes sense to be together a while before having kids too =o)|`|S2vI4VEXaa	Never once did the thought cross my mind.|`|BoqbYQ1Naa	I'm a housewife and I don't worry about these things at all.  His son is his responsibility.|`|sfn6SpbCaa	You know something he wouldn't do it on purpose; that's because people., not family, have tried to get him to do it. Well, he never budged. Now, were he to die, then, yes.  Still, I want to do something for myself; something I can look back and say, "Hey, I did that!"|`|NYU37jfGaa	If my husband left me he would find himself obliged to pay large sums in child support, so it probably wouldn't be worth it financially.  he's better off staying with me. Don't you have child support in America?    Anyway, what is the point of getting married at all if you think it's going to break up?  If you think your husband is likely to dump you, wouldn't it be better not to marry him in the first place?  What kind of a marriage is it if you sit around wondering "what am I going to do if he leaves me?"  What the hell is the point of being married if you think like that?    Anyway, even if you have got a job, there's no guarantee you won't lose it.  My brother-in-law is being made redundant after being in his job for 20 years.  As he is now 50, I have no idea what his chances are of getting another job.  I wouldn't be too smug about your education and your job if I were you, they won't necessarily save you from ending up unemployed.|`|2RygPGRaaa	No, I'm a housewife and I don't worry. I know my husband would never leave me even if he hated me. He would still be paying the bills whether I was in the picture or not.  God will always provide. Just have faith. It is a woman's place to be in the home. Do you ever wonder why the world is so messed up? The further and further society gets away from God's standards, the more society gets messed up.

z60J0Z9Daa	Considering you dont tell us anything at all...how are we suppose to know?    Maybe...maybe not.  Ask a Doc...but tell them everything instead of "I have the symptoms"    But I had to take a guess I'd say no...as very few women really have PMS(only 10%) and PMDD is the most sever of them...with only roughly 3% of that 10%. Having it.  So we are talking what 1 in a million?    Edit: your 13, ok thats called crazy hormones and growing pains.  If it's closely tied with your cycle you can speak with a doc to get on birth control to help level out your hormones.  Several of my friends around that age did this to help even things out.   Go talk with your mother or father and get in to see a doc.|`|mCAWxobNaa	You have to formally consult a physician to obtain the diagnosis.  You'll need certain other conditions excluded and if you do have it, you'll need an Rx anyhow.|`|PNwr3JgBaa	I do not know I am not a doctor.|`|a9i8Q98Aaa	If you have all the symptoms, of  course there's a possibility.  But then again you could possibly have about a million other different things as well.  You need to be more specific.    Your age does not necessarily have anything to do with whether or not you have PMDD.  What are the symptoms exactly, have you been to a doctor, etc.
NBBRWd5Gaa	booze helps, but your still a minor, so i wouldn't recommend it|`|oBdGEfhlaa	i'm 43 and sometimes when i get depressed, it's because my blood sugar has dropped and i need to eat something.     Depression can also be caused by the weather or just a feeling of being overwhelmed.     The next time you feel depressed, talk to a trusted adult or clergy person and see if there is something you can do to get you over the depression quicker.    Good luck and take care!|`|O5cTOF0aaa	Yes it is possible. You should probably talk to someone. Depression is an illness that does not necessarily give reasons for why it does what it does.|`|Ajl3iBWIaa	yes and no, People can be influenced by many invisible things and nothing obvious seen.which may something like your surroundings. An atmosphere of negativity or staying in some less positive places can bring a concealable result in body. So I suggest you be aware of your environment, try to figure out what makes your feeling up and down. Try to go near some positive places, positive people and read some more good material and information. Every thing has its cause and effect, either the physical or the spiritual. I could not say any more. Believe in God is something that will lead to happiness. So sincerely may God be with you.|`|PpkxgwJ0aa	yes, mental depression is a chemical imbalance.  you need to talk to a trusted adult and see a doctor.  If your diagnosed then meds might be the next step.  But that's your docs call.|`|7GUIiDRpaa	Yes.  And most certainly in teen years ... the ones I laughingly refer to as my years of insanity.    When your biochemistry stabilizes your moods should too.   Your moods are real and valid, but you should strive toward moderation.  When you find your grades or social life suffer, or when you develop compulsive behaviours ( CLUE: you will not/cannot discuss it with anyone)  then you know you need help.  Try the school counselor.  Hang in there!  It all gets better.    --Hiker
9D08eHn7aa	Developing countries would be wise to invest in biotechnology because it will increase crop yields.  This should improve health and standard of living.  Personally, I think the basis for any fledgling economy should be food production.  If you can support yourself food wise then you are making progress.      Developed countries are wise to invest in biotechnology because it, again, increases crop yields.  And as developed countries, the rest of the world relies on your output.  Not only do you need to supply the staples of your Ag output to your nation, but the rest of the world as well.  This is where it gets tricky though.  In developed countries there is more demand for land.  In the U.S. farmland in production has remained constant for many years, but the land has become more expensive.  The agriculture sector has seen many ebbs and flows because of this, along with questionable financial practices.  Increasing yield per acre allows farms to make more off the same land... but this leads to increased inventories!  Why hasn't this affected the Ag sector in the current crisis... because of the "new' economic kid on the block" ethanol.  There is more demand for corn and it is affecting the prices of other commodities.  Is this artificial... or what I mean is, is corn efficient for ethanol?  Not when compared to sugar cane... but that's a whole different story. (look up sugar cane policy in the U.S.)    Some people argue that biotechnology will force all agriculture production to developing countries because it is cheaper to produce there.  In business the bottom line is always what you make minus input costs.    I think the U.S. should remain in Ag at all costs because those who can grow the food have the upper hand.
n7bok7NRaa	The feelings you describe are very common feelings as you begin to fall into (or out of) deep sleep. Usually your brain doesn't record any memories of these feelings, but is the reason why dreams often end with you having the sensation of flying or falling.    You shouldn't worry about these sensations. Everyone has this exact dream at some point in time in their life (though they might rationalize it more and say they were floating in a river, or spinning out in space).    After all - where do you think the term "falling asleep" came from?    I hope that helps!|`|RWgjnwl9aa	This sounds more like a panic attack than a dream  when you have a panic attack you can feel like you're outside your body  your body can feel heavier  it gives you a feeling of fear for no reason   you just can't get yourself under control  it doesn't last long but it seems like it does your pulse shoots up & breathing is shallow|`|iF88FbMFaa	i have experienced them both. usually shaking happens when u jest wake up. idk if its from ur body gets to cold or from to much energy around u.    and ya i have expirence i was awake one time and i could not move. its half alseep. it usualy hapends before or after a dream.    u could have brain problums
AA10510845	It's possible.  Depression can cause a lot of mental and physical problems.  I hope you're getting help for your depression. Lots of people are depressed these days, so you're not alone.  Through therapy and medication, you can be helped to feel much better.  Good luck!|`|BbC1w6Diaa	Any kind of stress shrinks your hippocampus.

I hope you are getting help for your condition.   my thoughts are with you,  Penny|`|Kgi2RxhBaa	I'm bipolar, and before I was put on the good drugs, I felt like an Alzheimer's patient whenever I slid into a depression. I'm sure it was caused by lack of sleep and stress, because when I was depressed I would only get about 2 hours of sleep per night. You should see a doctor; mental illness doesn't have the stigma that it used to, and with therapy and/or medication you'll feel a lot better.
XKk101Kqaa	Governments do not arrange trade, they impose tariffs. Big countries like America make a lot of revenue from tariffs, however smaller countries tend to lose money if they impose tariffs (they try to maintain their reserves of US dollars).
cWxwHMQWaa	Why would they? They can choose whatever it is they want to do with their lives.    If they'd rather live as women did before we had the right to choose our own paths, they can still do that. There's no great shortage of others who feel that way.    Sounds like they're bitching for the sake of bitching. It's not difficult to land a partner who wants to work while you're at home and strip you of every right to make your own choices. Obviously they're too lazy to bother to find that.     Beyond that, I can't think of anything they could possibly feel like they're 'missing' now =o/|`|uXqDYPNVaa	Yeah, Capone has it right. There are indeed opportunists out there who don't like the obligations that come with power.|`|FL67UPPHaa	I can understand where they're coming from. I'm grateful for the rights I have, and I wouldn't want to give them up, but at the same time they do make life much more difficult and stressful. I'm terrible at making choices, so I'd prefer not to be offered so many of them! I'm happier when someone else is in control, it makes me feel safer and more secure.     Women have more responsibilities now; in the past, we were responsible for the home and children, now we have our careers added on to that. There's a lot more pressure on women today.    I think the extra responsibilities are worth it to have equal rights within society. But I make up for it by giving away the power in my personal life, and letting my partner make all our decisions. It's relaxing and liberating, and it frees me from the stress of my work/public life.|`|531f6a6374dfe1e1a0a3027ce2dd7ae5aa	I don't think many women resent having the power to be able to do what they want and work where they want to in our society.  :)|`|W76VDFKCaa	Yes!!!!!!!!!!  I know women who are in their 30's and 40's who have nice professional jobs and status that are miserable.  All they want is one thing: a family.  Many women work so hard to achieve success that they put aside their natural desires to have children.  Now they are regretting it.|`|P1VXjLPOaa	As the old adage goes. "With great power, comes great responsibility".|`|OTT79NAtaa	I agree with Capone. Noone resents power. This population you're referring to however may resent that they've been required to uphold certain responsibilities with this new power (even if they hadn't agreed to the accepting of the new found power).|`|rjj75n6Yaa	What power?... Oh yeah , the power that we gav--|`|4KlVkaDaaa	I have not met any.  I appreciate it.  There may be some that I've not met who have very different values, but I haven't experienced them.|`|2dfdfcdb4d65c895a40f81c0cb21ef17aa	It's hard to enjoy something that people seem to resent you for having it.
A71Uu05Uaa	Why do women think we really care if they are angry?    The noise is the only bothersome part.  Perhaps the flowers at least make her quiet.    I don't even bother with flowers when my girl is mad.  And there's no way I'd pander to whatever tirade she's off on.  I usually just laugh and go about my business.  It's usually nothing anyone even should be mad about it in the first place.  As wonderful as she is, she sure can make mountains out of molehills.  Not much can be done about that, though... she's a woman.    And since when did parents stop teaching their children that anger and hatred simply aren't good things to hold onto.  They are like poison, holding onto it only hurts yourself.|`|vEj7xoBraa	well if it isn't female inferiority.Long time no see.|`|wgZVeLZPaa	My man doesn't. I told him I didn't want flowers because it usually means that one of us has done something wrong. :)    Seriously - flowers are ok if they are given out of the blue, but not as an apology.|`|1168bcccfff6f3a578ef3a0223e4cce5aa	They don't. What they realise is that women are often too pig headed to offer the olive branch first, so make the necessary first move (as usual).|`|BoqbYQ1Naa	Works for me.|`|s3IBrhZCaa	hell, it always worked for me. women love flowers.|`|cbsAZVNQaa	no. but your a man so you should know the answer to this question.|`|60YMS1xkaa	I don't like flowers.    I think its because of movies and what a great affect they have on society. Just like the put the arm around the girls' shoulders in the movies. It's a supposedly the right thing to do...cause girls supposedly like pretty things. I know I do. But not flowers. They just piss me off more.|`|axGprtU1aa	they just want to shut you up|`|fDGPbwdsaa	Same reason women think a flash of their **** will solve everything.|`|anLdtPQwaa	Ha ha! I caught my man kissing another girl and he said sorry and gave me flowers. I laughed and shut the door in his face. He can go kiss that b**** and I wouldn't care cause I deserve more respect then that. And to think that he would give me flowers and think it would all be better...sigh...whatever, I've moved on! So should you, if he's done anything too wrong :)|`|JebgVOA2aa	I never use flowers as a symbol of apology. Their much to beautiful for that :)|`|9a8dcc5b6d79b07abd75628d8b093129aa	No, it's actually a terrible idea to give flowers when she's angry as hell.    It's different when she is recovering happiness tho, cuz it can cheer her up.      Still flowers don't solve everything. That's stereotypical as hell|`|4KlVkaDaaa	If someone does something to make me angry, some flowers won't fix the problem if they continue behaving in an unacceptable way.

I guess one could say that I am not a "traditional" woman.  I don't like flowers, roses, candy, or jewelry all that much.      So I wonder what a man would do if he was in trouble with me, so to speak because I don't have an interest in all those little thing women are supposed to like.|`|zCxRUFRCaa	I wish someone would buy me flowers    Maybe you need to work on your forgiveness and gratitude and anger management skills

26991c1ba20b717681957ed25b316eacaa	Well there could be a couple of reasons for this.   You may not know what you'd "Want in a man" so to speak. There is a difference between feeling sexually attracted to men more than women or vise versa. But are they feelings or is it just lust? There is a difference. Many straight women feel that they'd rather be with women because they feel that men don't understand them the way that girl friends do. You could feel that you'll be more comfortable sharing a dinner table wiht a women because you trust women more than men, which is common. You should try to date both and see how you feel with both sexes. It could be that you're bi and you have the needs of a straight person but the "relationship" part you would be more successful with a women. Definately put yourself out there, see if you feel happier with a man or women.  The men that have come across you in your life may have just had boring personality and you felt zero chemistry between you and the guys, it happens it doesnt mean you're gay.|`|vvgmyX04aa	Hmm..since you haven't really had experience with relationships and if you are not clear whether you are into men or women or both, maybe it would be a good idea to think of people who you know who are attractive to you and who you think you might enjoy being on a date with. Think this of a few people and just don't worry about what sex they are.    For what it's worth, I don't think you should worry about what your preference is. I think if you find someone you are happy with, that is all that matters. Good luck and I wish you all the best!  :)|`|zCxRUFRCaa	Everybody wonders about their own sexuality from time to time  Even the rabid homophobes!

0d933978330be4fd4b5c6d64deb9f18daa	www.virtuesproject.com  revolutions differ from rebellion as it seeks to implement a different system.  many times violent.  french agst the kings. american agst colonialism.  rebellion is merely agst   particular issue thats agst the government.  one group not liking the other and seek to replace it violently and yet continue with the same system.  eg food riots-haiti, separatist movement-srilanka/spain.  its usu political power that boils down to ego that propels these fights.    then it comes to $$$ and then food.  american is the best example as whatever they did they try to make it different from mother england.  the french one led to the brand of socialism that we hv today.  degaulle tried to enthrone himself which he did but didnt prevail after his death.  franco in spain is another good example

However, at least in some locations - this was required reading for women's studies classes.    Disgusting.

She wrote a tract (the SCUM Manifesto) which called for the entire elimination of men, by force if necessary.     You can read more about it here:    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCUM_Manife...    Wiki describes Valerie Solanas as follows:    Valerie Jean Solanas (April 9, 1936  April 25, 1988) was an American radical feminist writer, best known for the attempted murder of Andy Warhol in 1968. She wrote the SCUM Manifesto, an essay ... advocating the destruction of the male gender, the creation of an all-female society, and the New World Order.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valerie_Sol...    It is to be noted that the "New World Order" was a great favourite of the Feminists, and eventually became adopted by the Right Wing.     One of the most telling reactions to this work was that Valerie Solanas was accorded the highest praise by the National Organisation for Women (NOW), instead of being denounced as the nutty unstable psychopath she was. This shows that Feminism, far from believing in equality, is totally anti-male, and they hold the psychopath in highest esteem.|`|anLdtPQwaa	There's no such thing in the real world.

What I believe needs to be done is flotation of infrastructure. This will bring in a larger need for construction and construction and production companies will need more employees to combat the growing depend of infrastructure. This will in effect increase the circulation of money from coffers to business owners and from business owners to employing for employing to the retail market and the cycle will begin again.|`|oqKuFOotaa	number 1  I am not sure how you missed the past decade of war all around the world that we are involved in. The first Bush administration got the US involved in combat in the Middle East saying it would help the US economy. This obviously didn't work out too well.    number 2      I really like this one! I have been thinking lately that what we need to do is similar. Instead of giving out tax relief checks to the poor and giving massive handouts to huge corporations, we should be creating momentum on all consumer levels.     The problem we are having right now is that no one at the bottom really feels safe spending and a good amount of the top can't afford to hold out without positive revenue.  By send out stimulus checks to the public it is hoped that we will stimulate spending. The problem is that most americans are just going to spend it either on a months rent or not spend it at all and horde it out of fear of recession.     What I would like to see is a line of credit for every single american and company. Something like a couple of thousand dollars is all. No real cash and is has to be spent in the consumer marketplace. Companies can use it to buy product materials and office supplies (no bonuses or raises). The general public can buy groceries, clothes, tv's, cars, alcohol, dental work, gas, lawn care, movies and so on.   (no investing or savings possible) The credit would carry up similarly to cash and that could be exchanged at lessened rate by those at the top and they would receive US dollars for it at the end of a two year period. This should give it time to trickle up through the marketplace, and then trickle down and then up and then down. The rate on the credit could be parallel to value of the US dollar.      I feel that this could stimulate a foundation for growth in spending which of course is the backbone of our crummy capitalist greed based world we live in. If anything it would be a more balanced system of bailout funds to large companies and put the money where it is most valued by the american consumer, and where it is legitimately earned.        I really have no serous education in these matters. This just seems logical to me.|`|exYOd0XCaa	OMGOSH Zhitbox!! u shud be doing business and management atm... RB is gonna kill u
Ao52XHjCaa	The people who tell you that the crisis is caused by mortgages are correct. However, the people who tell you that the crisis is caused by a drop in spending are also correct. Right now, we are in what is called a liquidity trap-actually more like a liquidity tar pit. Consumers are not spending and are finding it difficult to obtain credit to spend. Businesses are losing revenues and also having a difficult time obtaining credit. And several major banks are in trouble. As people stop spending, businesses lay off people, which increases the number of people who can not pay their debts and buy things, which deteriorates the assets held by banks, so banks won't lend, and with less money to available to borrow, businesses lay off more people and so on. It is a vicious cycle and not the easiest problem to fix.    It might make sense to divide this crisis into three or four separate shocks that have come together to create a problem. The number is probably closer to 20, but I don't have all night. This is a global problem right now, so events globally make a difference. You should look at this as a crisis in the financial system, a crisis in consumer credit, a commodity price shock. That should help sort this out.    1) Consumer credit crisis: At the heart of this issue is the mortgage problem, but it also involves credit cards, student loans, car loans, etc. For many years, interest rates were very low, and for a variety of reasons, credit became very easy to obtain. The money available to lend to consumers seemed endless. Financial companies were able to bundle these loans together into securities and sell those securities to other people very easily, obtaining more money back to lend to consumers. (This is called a virtuous cycle, the opposite of our current vicious cycle).     Unfortunately, because interest rates were low, it was more profitable for for companies to lend to people whose ability to pay was doubtful, but with loans that had higher interest rates. Also, the prices of homes were rising rapidly, so people took out much bigger loans than they did in the past, thinking that home values would continue to rise and if they got into financial trouble, they could easily sell their houses at a profit. Also (see, all these alsos), since investors were willing to buy bundled packages of loans from lenders and take on the risk of default of bad loans, lenders relaxed their lending standards. As prices of houses continued to rise, many people bought houses and condos on speculation (flip this house!) and many people found that the only way they would qualify for a loan for a house was to take out a non-traditional mortgage (aka sub-prime loan). Incomes did not keep pace with home prices, and rather than saving until house prices came down, people bought houses with little or no down payment. Also, people thought that their incomes would increase, and they thought that they could easily refinance, so they bought houses that were more expensive than they could afford to pay for at the time thinking that that problem could be solved in the future.    Starting in late 2006/2007, this cycle began to unravel. Some of the people who took out sub-prime mortgages found themselves unable to pay. Because people defaulted on their loans, the investors in the bundles of loans started to realize that the bundles of sub-prime loans that they thought were relatively safe were in fact not very safe. So investors stopped buying securities backed by sub-prime loans. However, lenders kept making loans, thinking that the situation was temporary. The investment banks that bought the loans to sell to investors continued to buy loans for awhile, but suddenly, they found few customers and ended up holding the loans themselves. If the banks had ONLY been doing that, things would have been better.    Anyway, people are not spending for many reasons. One reason is that they are struggling to pay off mortgages. Another reason is that they no longer have access to easy credit to buy things. They are trying to pay down debt and/or save in case they are laid off.     In May last year, the government sent many people a check for $300 if you were single or $600 for a family, thinking that this would make people start spending. The government did this after September 11, and it seemed to work then. The government did this in 1970s, but it did not work so well. The rebate did not work this time.     Now, Congress is trying to figure out how to get consumers to spend again...or whether that is desirable to boost consumer demand in the short run.     Republicans want to stimulate consumer demand through tax cuts and incentives. For instance, they want to incentivize people to buy houses by offering a $15,000 tax break and 4% mortgages and incentivize people to buy cars by making interest on car loans deductible.    The administration does not believe in the short run tax cuts will have any more effect this time than the $300 rebate did last summe

awuGFzOPaa	Vak is close. There are three ways the government gets money.     1. Borrow from the Federal reserve bank, selling Treasury notes.    2. Taxes, they simple raise them.    3. Just print the money.    In case  1 China and Russia announced they will no longer buy our long term notes and other countries are starting to "dump the dollar". Because they see us inflating the currency and devaluing the dollar.    In case  2. If the government were to raise taxes now it would all but stop any growth in jobs and the economy and we would see even more massive layoffs.    It looks like they are opting for  3. The Fed increased the money supply by 70% in October alone. If Congress passes this new spending bill, we will see hyperinflation i the next year or two.     And yes countries can go broke. Iceland already has and there is talk of the UK and Ireland may be next. If our debt level gets too high our bond rating will go down, if that happens to will be a race to dump the dollar and our currency will be worthless.|`|7h5zhoJqaa	They don't borrow from banks - not directly anyway.  They issue government securities - US Treasury Notes & Bonds - as investments to foreign governments and individuals & businesses in the US and abroad. A bank can purchase these securities just like anyone else, of course.  The majority of the investors are individuals & businesses.  If they couldn't pay off the debt, we'd be screwed.    Fortunately, these securities are setup to mature at different rates - some as long as 30 years.  They're also held by a lot of people - billions.  The debt is thus diversified to a point that there is no threat of default.  The government has no problem paying the interest, and people can't just make an instant call on them.  It's a very complex yet well structured system.|`|Lpw41OLdaa	they will borrow money from china or to ivory coast

I, personally, think that this world should support assisted suicide clinics - or just build suicide booths on streets like on the cartoon show Futurama. I knew this girl once when I was in high school, she would slice her wrists to get attention and act the same way you're acting. Feeling sorry for herself. Then she met a guy, is married, and living in Hawaii, happier than everyone thought she would ever be. The point in life is just to be. And I know people say you won't be friends with those people in your school for forever, and I kept my friends through college until I graduated. These people you know and want to pay attention to you won't be around you for long and you need to learn who you are before you know what will make you happy. Things could be better in life, but they could also get worse. I went through what you're feeling like, and my grandmother succeeded in killing herself, so if that's what you want to do, know that this world will keep on turning without you and it don't hesitate to care. Doing something stupid like that doesn't help anyone unless you really can't take life anymore and know what happiness is and just can't cope with all the stress.

zpmXGZsCaa	No license.  Most major universities have anthropology programs.  You will begin with survey classes like Intro to Anthropology and advance from there.  Higher leval courses specialize in certain areas like Human Origins, Meso-American Cultures, or Early Chinese Civilizations.  Also, anthropology majors require a fair amount of history, some science, English composition (you'll be writing a lot,) and usually a foreign language.      Beginning your 3rd year, field work will be required, and you'll need to travel.  Some countries may require you to have permission before the field work can commence.   Others work with national universities and coordinate research that way.      Great major, and quite interesting.

We retain only the significant information and fill in the blanks with generic details which seem to us to be appropriate.    So, it is impossible for you to retain that much information over a long period of time.    Unless you are a savant.
mCAWxobNaa	The vast majority are female Feminists on this section.    I am a man, highly opposed to the doctrine of feminism in the moden era.    The reason for this is because the doctrine is predicated on the hatred of men and Supremacy; both are things that I find sickening.|`|cWxwHMQWaa	Female. Feminist, amongst other things, but I'm not too attached to the label.     People can call me whatever they want, chances are I've been called worse by better anyhow haha =o)    No idea what this 'modern feminism' is about. Eh.|`|uXqDYPNVaa	Ditto Rose.|`|S2vI4VEXaa	Only by dictionary definition.    If someone were to give me a better term for someone who's more into human rights as opposed to JUST female rights, I'd be that. There is no correct term. So until there is, I'll call myself feminist.|`|wkjncmHTaa	Yes, because I believe in equality and not the 'equal but different' nonsense that 'equalists' spout on this site.|`|vEj7xoBraa	I am not a feminists either.I hate feminists|`|z60J0Z9Daa	I'm AM.

The term 'feminist' covers several categories, with three principle ones.  These are distinct enough that just saying 'feminist' doesn't mean that much.    Incidentally, there seems to be some complaint against the socialist feminists here, as well as the radical ones.  I personally don't advocate, but neither do I condemn out of hand, the notion of revolution for equality.  Revolution for female supremacy is a terrible notion, though.|`|jPoQm3C1aa	I'm an equalist.  Neither men nor women should have any more rights than the other, and so I'm not a feminist.|`|mZVk3fP4aa	I believe in equal rights.|`|oCHaJc49aa	Trevor is correct - the Feminists are like a bunch of hungry piranhas.  They act in a very aggressive and extremely cruel manner.     This is why I am not a Feminist. Cruelty is the entire means by which they act - and live. I don't like cruelty, and I don't like those who justify their cruelty by the use of the word "equality". I especially do not like those who are cruel, power hungry and who justify such by claiming to represent some curiously fluid concept called "equality" which means, when a Feminist says it, what the word "INEQUALITY" used to mean.|`|sfn6SpbCaa	Female; I'm not a feminist.  In the same token that I'm not a feminist I don't believe in the constant 50:50 scenario. I'm more of a 49:51 or 51:49 persona; the road is not always going to be smooth.|`|zCxRUFRCaa	I seriously considered myself a feminist of sorts before I came onto this board and then I encountered some women who use it to bully men so I redefined myself as an equalist.    I'll never forget one of the first days I was here on GWS (not realising how vicious it could get here) and I announced that I held feminist principles and I was torn apart and stripped to the bone in 30 seconds by some GWS feminazi pirahnna!    hehe|`|a9i8Q98Aaa	I'm not a feminist.  Not because I think either gender is superior, but rather because neither is so glorifying one is just stupid.  A lot of the 'feminists' here in GWS are more man haters than anything.  True, there are some who actually understand that feminism is about women being equal to men, not better than them, but unfortunately too many of them are just here to criticize men based upon the actions of a slim minority.
2jYVUlKkaa	Sweetheart, relax....No one is going to judge you on the things that someone else in your family has done...Obviously your sister made some bad choices....You are not your sister....Anyone that knows you, knows already what a wonderful person that you are, and you are doing good things in your life to better yourself....you sound like a very sweet, very nice person, and anyone that knows you truly would not think badly of you in such a way....You have goals and are working towards getting them....good for you....please don't be afraid...just continue on the path that you are, and everyone that already doesn't know the real you will soon know for themselves that you are destined to go places....I will say a little prayer for you and also for your sister....Be supportive of her....like I said, she made some bad choices, but she can still turn her life around....,Good luck to you sweetie....It is going to be alright...try not to worry too much....((((HUGS)))).......Linda|`|p0pDGL6zaa	don't let it get to you.

I bowl in leagues, so I know a lot of people in my town and it is a small town. Now that I am older and am away from the troubled life, it is nice to have earned my bachelors degree and help people with behavior and addiction problems.  Bottom line- you are you and not her. Be thankful for that.|`|QS7gq7Fzaa	you can't get past it  people are going judge you know matter what .

There is no "other world".

But think about it... Anything is better than nothing [as you said it]. Wait till you're older, then you can go off and live your own life. The way you want it, however miserable, it's still living and there's joy in life as long as you're free.    Think positive, and you'll see an improvement. You are want you want to be. Thinking about a million $ wont make you rich, but thinking about 1 million $ will give you the will to work harder and perhaps achieve some good money.    Someone said God is testing you. It's good to have faith, it makes you stronger, but trust me, God is not causing any human misfortune. It's the decision you and people around you make that causes you misery.

If you just let that urge go. If you let that urge control you, then you'll be acting like an obnoxiously agrumentive person...so just stop.

BE ALONE on Valentines Day. It's good for your character to weather certain days that have really unrealistic expectations attached to them - pushed on us by society.    I have been alone in the past on all the major days at times:  birthdays, valentines, christmas.    You will feel better when you put yourself through it and realize you DON'T NEED someone.    Your fear of loneliness can be cured if you allow yourself to be alone.    Valentines Day is just another day marketed by Hallmark to make millions.

Someone that you trust and has authority. Also explain to your friend that you are scared for her, and that if her dad really did love her then he wouldn't be doing that to her.   If you really don't want to get the police involved then get her to live with her mom. I would tell her mom though about what is happening also. If her mom tells the police I'm sure your friend won't get that mad considering your friend still loves her dad for hitting her.   Good luck. I hope you do the right thing.|`|M8qLP7MLaa	You should tell an adult like a teacher. Get her or your teacher to talk to her, or if you can her mom. Many a family member that your friend can trust, like an uncle or aunt.    If you can't manage to tell them directly, then tell one of said adults to ask her about the bruising. They'll most likely do so.    Another thing you could do is tell your parents about it and ask for their help.

wiJmJ7gNaa	Sometimes the way you think others look at you can either do good or bad to your boldness or courage. If you feel like you're fat or depressed, talk to a doctor or any adult or person you feel that you can trust. Sometimes it's good to write it all down on paper. There feelings are possible to overcome, except you need a whole lot of determination. A quote that i have always kept in my head "What would you do if you knew you could not fail?" Just try your best and seek out someone who seems alone like you are and you can be friends and help each other out. There are always more ways to help yourself than keep all this burden to yourself. have confidence in yourself, that's one thing that makes you feel great even though you seem to be very imperfect. No one's perfect, you know. STrive for the better!|`|AbtCfY1caa	what does yesterday have to do with today??|`|tSvixAGoaa	well the best way to counter these feelings would probably be to clean up and get in shape. it doesnt take much money to exercise, but it can be pretty expensive to eat healthy though. its a shame. but if you have friends dont feel like you're a burden to them. no one likes it when there is that one person in the group who is super needy or dare i say, "emo". I know it can be hard to over come strong feelings, but when you get to a weight that you are comfortable with, you will be able to look back at what you used to be like and see how great of a person you are for overcoming such a huge problem in your life.|`|JoU7WTadaa	You don't have to 'get a makeover' or change anything about yourself, as long as you try your hardest to be who you want to be. You couldn't help that when you were younger, but now you CAN. You have a great opportunity at your fingertips. Do with it what you will, but my advice: Pretend you have the confidence to overcome those feelings...and soon, you'll believe it as much as everyone else does, and that leads to real, concrete confidence (pardon the paradox). Now some may advise that this solution is unhealthy. That's for you to decide. Go out and make something of yourself.

The first step is to build your confidence. I would start searching for a therapist in your area that you can being meeting with. This isn't because there is something wrong with you, but because a therapist can help you take baby steps to move forward. There is no magic that can be worked over the computer on an answers site like this, but with regular meetings with an unbiased therapist who specializes in motivational therapy, you can find help to you cope with your feelings a little bit at a time. First, understand that children, and most adults, can be rude, ignorant, and lack empathy. You are not inferior to anyone. Socioeconomic status, quality of upbringing, and physical appearance does not make anyone superior or inferior to anyone else.|`|rZoo16TJaa	Yes, you can overcome the feelings if you choose to be strong. you are 20 now it is time to get your life going and leave those things in the past, kids make fun they cant help it they are kids, they have no self control, but as an adult now you have control over your life not them, and if you keep allowing those kids from years ago to burden you as an adult you will never achieve success. Your parents on the other hand were creeps, oh well you are alive despite their ways, so go do in this world what you always wanted to do. If all you have to offer in your life is a kind heart then offer it. You should know your friends love u if they are in your life, unless you give them money. So lift your head up and make a list of goals in your life and attack that list with all of your soul, then you won't have time to think about the losers from you past because your future would be so bright|`|9CHsxrJFaa	You know this makes me really sad. I made fun of this one overweight girl and I feel terrible I wish I never would have done it but I can't take it back. I'll be your friend if that makes you feel better.|`|df14a975e88aa3ace30d8ccaf12bf3e6aa	No one can make you feel bad without your permission.|`|HINny8cGaa	the best thing to do, I've found is to find someone you can trust and talk it out. Cry it out. I haven't have those extremes, but I am experiencing the same things on a smaller scale. Just be careful of who you talk to. Someone anonymous (like this) may be your best option. But if you give up hope, things will never go good for you. remember it doesn't matter what your past is, you always have a future. Keep going for it|`|XUwtAWzkaa	Honestly, anything you set your mind to you can acheive. The reason you think people look at you still to this day is because of your weight. Not to be harsh at all, but if someone is obese there 98% more likely to be the topic of discussion by other people. You can stop this by getting on a diet plan once you get your financial status squared away. A simple walk every morning and no more fast food will cut down 10-20 pounds over a year. The worst thing you can do is give up, you obviously are showing that you want to make a change in your life so the next step would be to go ahead with it. Make a change, I swear you will feel better in the long run. I've been through the weight thing, Im only 18 but I used to weigh about 192lbs at 5'5 in highschool and it was no fun at all. By senior year I was 182lbs and close to solid muscle. Another thing you can do to help you become more comfortable around people is join a local church or book club, neither of these might sound fun, but both will get you out of the house and interacting with people in your community. Hope this helps, and DONT GIVE UP !!!|`|2ZTdAoFjaa	It all depends on who you are on the inside to me.  Nothing you said would turn me away from treating you like a normal person.  All you need is a good friend or two nothing more and eventually all of these feelings will go away in due time.  My best wishes to you and your future.|`|YQAL50PCaa	You can't go back and change your childhood. Just say your adult life is a new start. Right now your in between your past and future. Being there's nothing you can't do about your past,you still have your future. Exercise,watch what you eat better your self for tomorrow.|`|GXM74MGPaa	Get a makeover. Get your hair and makeup done. Buy new clothes that make you feel amazing. Youll feel like a new person.|`|76fYDbsCaa	Anything is possible mate. Just have some hope and try to gain confidence in your abilities. You can do pretty much whatever you think you can do.You just got to want it, life is a desire that you have to go after. Go after your happiness man, that's why Jefferson called it the "pursuit of happiness". You can do it if you try, and the beginning is always hard but you'll make it.|`|u3sw0LMpaa	Yess it is possible... I'm sorry you had to live that way =( Its nothing that can't be changed... If you parents are going to be like that, I'm sorry but screw them... Also, you can go on a diet, you will lose weight overtime if you are committed to it.. Get social and make friends in the right way... Good luck =) Peace on Earth =)|`|AA11269060	I believe the best way to overcome these feelings is to face them head on.  And, you can do this by facing the people that bullied you and made you feel bad.  Let them know how you felt, because often people don't really get how bad they can make others feel until they're called out for it.  Also, do this singly, meaning one on one with each of them with nobody else around.  Bullies tend to feel their power in groups.  When you single them out, just watch!  They won't be able to own up to it, and you'll end up making them feel bad and hopefully guilty for the way they treated you.  I'm sorry that that happened to you.  Just know that once you get out of school into the real world people aren't so awful to you.  Adolescence is a hard period if you're not one of the "in" crowd.  As for now, get out and join some clubs or activities that interest you.  They're great ways to meet new people.  And, this way you'll at least know what you have in common with the other people...you're shared hobby/interest.  Good luck!  =)|`|yUnQahGoaa	It's def possible. First you need to work on your social skills and realize that you aren't that person anymore. Once you start talking to people, just be yourself. You don't need to tell people about your past. Since you'll be meeting people that didn't know you as a child, you can have a clean start. You can be whoever you want to be and that is all they need to know. If you find people that you get really close to and feel the need to tell them about your life back then that's on you. Figure out what you like about yourself or don't like and work it out that way. Confidence is what people are drawn to and like. Think about it this way, be out going and learn to talk to people. If you are meeting them for the first time and aren't close to any of them if you make an *** of your self, who cares you don't have to see them ever again. Once you make a friend or two things will be easier once you see that you are worthy of having friends. And you are, regardless of who your parents are and what you've been thru in the past. Don't let that effect your future. Think of it as an adventure. Keep in mind that you are good enough to be friends w/anyone you want to be. It's not going to be easy but this is a start. Good luck.
NYU37jfGaa	African American women were generally marginalised by the white women who ran the campaign, because they were afraid of offending southern women.  In 'America'sWomen' Gail Collins writes:    In 1913, when Alice Paul organised a women's suffrage parade to coincide with Woodrow wilson's inauguration, ida Wells-Barnett, the black journalist and activist, arrived in Washington with a sixty-member delegation from her Alpha Suffrage club in chicago.  Paul was not thrilled to see them.  In an effort to placate southern suffrage, she had announced that there would be no black women in the march.  But African Americans were determined this historic moment was not going to be an all-white affaird. "If the Illinois women do not take a stand now in this great democratic parade then the colored women are lost." said Wells-Barnett.  In the end, Paul reluctantly allowed the black women to walk at the end of the procession.  Only Wells-Barnett broke ranks.  She vanished intot he crowd and then stepped back onto the street as the Illinois delegation passed, joining her white friends for trhe rest of the march.    This sort of thing happened to black suffragists all the time.  Whever there was a quiestion of choosing between the sensibilites of racist southerners and the feelings of African American women, they wound up on the outside - or at the back of the parade.  When the suffrage movement held its first big convention in the South in 1894, susan B. Anthony asked Frederick Doublass to stay away out of "expediency."  When the convention met in New Orleans in 1903, black women were barred from attending.  Anthony paid a visit to one of the largest black women;s clubs in the city in an effort to make amends.  The president, Sylvanie Williams, greeted her politely, then siad pointedly.  "When women like you, Miss Anthony, come to see us and speak to us, it helps us to believe in the Fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man, and at least for the time being, in the sympathy of women."    All things being equal, most of the white suffrage leaders would have been happy to march next to Wells-Barnett in the parade or sit with Sylvanie Williams at a convention.  But African American women had virtually no political power, and southern whites had all the power in the world, at least in their ability to stop a constitutional amendment.  So people like Susan Anthony and Alice Paul were constantly trying to avoid reminding the south that black women were part of the suffrage movement.  When people like Wells-Barnett failed to appreciate their position, they explained the situation again, as though the only problem was a lack of political sophistication on the part of the AFrican Americans.|`|BC2CNH3jaa	A huge role. I will link you to one example.|`|LR48Rtv2aa	Do you want an honest answer or are just asking because you don't value races other than your own?    I noticed that on this forum, there seems to be a general feeling of people wanting Africans Americans to prove their worth...|`|Pa4cyKn7aa	I don't need to prove anything to you.  It's okay to ask a question, but why does a specific race, usually the Black race have to be the example?|`|xAL7OCUVaa	they were very important,  if you wanna watch a movie about american suffrage thats almost exactly factual, try watching Iron Jawed Angles.  theres a black woman in it (i forgot her name, shock horror!)  but ALice Paul organised a parade down pensylvania ave, and the black women had to march at the back, but this black woman refused, and while the parade was marching by, she walked over th erope with 2 of her white buddies, and she walked right there with the white women.   Shes pretty cool indeed.
axGprtU1aa	No one should need to be changed if they're in a relationship with the right person.|`|oCHaJc49aa	Alien Invasion, the Feminists have created the impression that they are the Judges of All Humanity, and the Font of All Wisdom.    They are neither.     Women who get into a relationship to change a guy are just doing what women all through the centuries have done: set themselves up as God and act like the world is there for them to play with.     It's all to do with control - the female has a much greater need than any male, to control something else. There's a myriad of reasons for this, but suffice to say, it exists and the Feminist tapped into it in order to try and rid the world of men.     The reason that men don't go into a relationship with a women in order to try and change her is because guys realise how unfair and really quite nasty this practice is.     I say this to women who try such: you cannot even govern yourself. How do you expect to govern others?    You cannot change yourself to what it is you desire. How can you expect to change others?|`|D8sN8gNFaa	That's the thing, "From a man's point of view" some women like a challenge or "project" this I am referring to is the man, and in a way that is women objectifying men, so they have no right to complain they they are always objectified. They like a guy and they figure that the little quirks which are ingrained into his psyche can be fixed, some can be, but some women don't realize that some things about a guy they love cannot change.    What does this say about men? It says that they are human, and have qualities that women won't like, but the same goes for women. And the thing is men are less inclined to try to change them because they know beforehand that it's a lost cause. In that regard I think men are more accepting of quirks or imperfections.

In our society, single women are expected to conform to a more conservative role than single men are. Therefore, the gap between expected behavior between a married man and a single man is greater than that between a married woman and a single woman. The organization of the relationship, being more at the whim of the woman, also contributes to this appearance. No, women are not ultimately better than men.|`|cWxwHMQWaa	Reminds me of the saying, "Women meet a man and try to change him, men meet a woman and hope she'll never change".    I think more experienced people learn not to do these things and, if they want love long-term, they choose someone who is what they want and get to know them enough to not need them to make any big changes. They also get to know they won't likely make any drastic changes that would ruin the relationship.    Eventually, you learn you can't change people or hold them back and keep them stuck in that moment forever either =o)|`|wkjncmHTaa	Why would that imply women are better than men??

I have seen it, but not very serious changing, just like encouraging them to exercise more or stuff, nothing major.    I don't know what it says about men other than that some of them have bad habits, but don't we all? It really depends what they are trying to change. Encouraging somebody to eat healthily or exercise more is helpful especially if it could be causing health issues for them. Other things can't be changed, but I still think it's important to try and talk about things you're unhappy with in a relationship.    I've seen it the other way around too, a couple of my friends had very clingy guys who were always trying to change what their girls did and how they acted/behaved. One of them ditched the guy shortly after and he got extremely upset and irrational and continued to contact her with long messages about her behaviour etc.    Harriet|`|vEj7xoBraa	first I like to say I hate the title of you question,second women always want men to stop liking football and start liking soaps.

That women are perhaps more prone to perfectionism, to feeling that the grass is always greener, and/or seeing relationships as projects, while men are more laid back and accepting, or perhaps not prefering the excitement of a change of partner to the effort of 'improving' the current one.    As I say, if there is any truth in that statement, neither is in anyway better.

If youre worried about coming into contact with feces, go to the bathroom to clear out your bowels. You can also shower first, or do your experimenting in the shower, or wear a latex glove with lube on it during anal play.  2. Exercise. Try some anally focused exercises, clenching and unclenching your sphincter muscles. Anal kegels can be done in sets of 12; try doing a fast set and a slow set. During the slow set, exhale on the relaxation portion of the exercise.  3. Add lube to your finger and your anus. The tissue of the rectum is sensitive, it doesn't self-lubricate as does the vagina, and it can suffer little micro tears and abrasions quite easily. So be gentle when you explore, and use lots and lots of lubricanttry Entice by Babeland or Maximus. These thicker lubes are great for anal sex because the dont evaporate as quickly.  4. Get to know your butt. Start by feeling around the outside of the hole. There are two sphincters of the anus, the outer one, which creates the pucker that you can see, and the inner sphincter that you can feel a short ways up if you insert your finger in your anus.  5. Go inside. If youre playing in the shower, ease a fingertip just inside your ***. If youre lying on your back or side, insert a well-lubed finger. If you meet resistance, push out as if you had to go to the bathroom and push your finger in at the same time.  6. Experiment. Do some clenches and releases while touching yourself so that you can feel the changes in your asshole. Try rubbing in tiny, concentric, circles around the rim of your asshole. Notice whether there are any particularly sensitive spots. Dont feel you have to go very far inside. Just explore and enjoy yourself.|`|Heg7MXV3aa	No, but I have a bewbs, butt, and vagina fetish.

There are a few things that you can do to manage this fear, but it won't be an overnight thing. Here is a checklist of stuff that you can do to manage this fear.    Prior Proper Preparation  Prevents Poor Performance  of the  Person Putting on the Presentation.   Nothing will relax you more than to know you are properly prepared. Below are 10 steps you can take to reduce your speech anxiety.     (1. Know the room - become familiar with the place in which you will speak. Arrive early and walk around the room including the speaking area. Stand at the lectern, speak into the microphone. Walk around where the audience will be seated. Walk from where you will be seated to the place where you will be speaking.     (2. Know the Audience - If possible, greet some of the audience as they arrive and chat with them. It is easier to speak to a group of friends than to a group of strangers.     (3. Know Your Material - If you are not familiar with your material or are uncomfortable with it, your nervousness will increase. Practice your speech or presentation and revise it until you can present it with ease.     (4. Learn How to Relax - You can ease tension by doing exercises. Sit comfortable with your back straight. Breathe in slowly, hold your breath for 4 to 5 seconds, then slowly exhale. To relax your facial muscles, open your mouth and eyes wide, then close them tightly.    (5. Visualize Yourself Speaking - Imagine yourself walking confidently to the lectern as the audience applauds. Imagine yourself speaking, your voice loud, clear and assured. When you visualize yourself as successful, you will be successful.    (6. Realize People Want You To Succeed - All audiences want speakers to be interesting, stimulating, informative and entertaining. They want you to succeed - not fail.    (7. Don't apologize For Being Nervous - Most of the time your nervousness does not show at all. If you don't say anything about it, nobody will notice. If you mention your nervousness or apologize for any problems you think you have with your speech, you'll only be calling attention to it. Had you remained silent, your listeners may not have noticed at all.    (8. Concentrate on Your Message - not the medium - Your nervous feelings will dissipate if you focus your attention away from your anxieties and concentrate on your message and your audience, not yourself.    (9. Turn Nervousness into Positive Energy - the same nervous energy that causes stage fright can be an asset to you. Harness it, and transform it into vitality and enthusiasm.    (10. Gain Experience - Experience builds confidence, which is the key to effective speaking. Most beginning speakers find their anxieties decrease after each speech they give.     The last one is a bit of a moot point at this time, but most of the other advice is quite good.|`|jLMbnaAEaa	I remember being called all of the sudden to recite a speech by Mark Anthony in front of the whole student body (about 1200). I was shaking throughout the whole speech and after the speech, they applauded then I ran back to the important meeting I was attending before I got called.    Hmm... Since your comfortale with a small group, try doing it in front of a slightly larger group next, like 10 or 12 people. It doesn't have to be the same speech maybe tell an interesting story or experince of yours.    Try looking at the back of the Classroom, not the people.    I suggest watching a video of Rev. King's speech and see how he did it and find out what motivated him to do thie speech. Get in the mood that hw was in during the speech (it was the civil rights movement, think of you trying to defend something or someone you hold dear).    All of you are doing it so in a way, all of you are relatively in the same boat, don't worry too much.    When your up stage, move, don't stay in one place, use your body as an tool for expressing the speech, not just your lips. Whe emphasizing something in the speech, say it a bit slower nand a bit louder than usual. Pause on commas ( , ) (around half a second) and pause a bit longer on periods ( . ) (about one second). Don't look down, alyaws look straight, chin up. You can move your head but always make sure your face is seen and your eyes are always looking in front.    If you think you can already look at the audinece, dont just look at one area, look at different people in the audience. Talk to the people not at them.|`|k4DxnbMCaa	Well, the best way to overcome all of these obstacles in the long run would be to practice. I remember I had the same problem in Grade 6, and by the start of Grade 8, I was comfortable in the position at the head of the classroom. You just gain confidence as you present more over the years.    However, there are some short-term solutions. Make sure that you've read over your cue cards/notes/PowerPoint several times before presenting. That way, you won't get stuck on a word or forget a point as easily. You should try having a drink of water before presenting, as I find that my mouth got extremely dry before/during a presentation, and therefore became one of the sources of my stuttering. If one of your classmate's faces is throwing you off your game, try to look at something different.    So basically, this is something that you will probably grow out of in the next couple years of school. Don't get discouraged if you can't do it perfectly yet; it's only natural for you to be nervous when put in a situation like that for the first few times. For now though, you can try my suggestions.    Hope this helps!|`|ohUm00RYaa	I dunno, had the same problem myself too, couldn't remember lines for beans.    I never really got over this, I just think some people cannot remember lines.  I gave an hour and 15 minute long lecture on the Slobadan Milosevic trial off memory without looking at my paper once, but I cannot remember 3 lines word for word from the merchant of venice.    If it is not too late ask your teacher if you can do a presentation rather than a speech recital.  Remind your teacher that your ability to memorize and recite verse from a speech has little real importance.  It doesn't teach you anything, it doesn't prepare you to think critically for high school but most of all it doesn't teach the class anything.    Ask her if instead of reciting the speech if you could simply give a presntation on civil rights or MLK which would be far more informattive.    I could never remember 3 lines word for word more or less a whole speech and I'm in 1 of the top 10 business schools in the world, so i don't think it has anything to do with intelligence
iyyvbHHnaa	nailaaaaa, are you serious?    Dylan and Eric are Columbine shooters and Cho Seung Hui is the Virginia Tech shooter.    Please watch some news.    And no, your dream doesn't mean ****. Stop worrying about stupid things and get a life.|`|UR3MjFLtaa	who are those people?|`|1fd334de2dd363f2c3802ce3b9b7466aaa	Well they are closely related, so that's probably why they were in the same dream. Sometimes things from random events (like when watching the news, and hearing about the murders) just come out of nowhere into your dreams. I don't think it means anything..except that you may be a little stressed? Or nervous about something. That's the usual cause for frighting dreams like that..    Hope this helps! No need to worry :)
9Iy69I3Qaa	for females, it depends. i think if they are under 30, this isnt a sensitive question. beyond that age, they worry about all the things that come with aging such as grey hair and wrinkles. exept if they dont look their age. if there is a 40 year old who can pass for being like 20-something, i would not immage she would be ashamed of her age simply because saying that she is 40, she is more showing off that she looks amazing for her age.  truly, i think guys dont care they are getting old untill they get so old where they begin to doubt their appearences.  seniors, i think also do not truly care of their age becasue they cannot hide their age. if you see a wrinkly 80 year old lady on the street and she is insecure about her age so she will say she is 20, then you obviously see she is lying so she has no point in lying.

The diaper will just make things worse...  If the guy lives near your neighborhood  then my opinion's that you need to tell your  parents about it, so you'll get help before it gets worse...

CCg8CLkLaa	This is an important dream and means mostly good things for you.    First, the fact that your dream took place in a large building forecasts changes in your lifestyle. Specifically, an indoor gym is an omen for material prosperity and a respected place for you in society. If it was in a high school, it means that youll have a choice between many options. However, the part where you were being challenged (by your teacher) is a warning not to offend important people.  Your feelings of anxiousness in the dream (waiting to see if your work was satisfactory) are actually a sign that your worries will soon be over.  And whenever youre afraid in your dreams, it means you will recognize your difficulties and find the courage to conquer them.    As far as experiencing so much death in your dream, even though it was obviously very distressing, death in a dream is rarely a bad omen. When you see someone elses death in your dream its an indication to slow down because youre taking on too much. Change is coming, although it might not be change that you like. On the other hand, it can also indicate a birth. The fact that the violence involved a gun means its time to put an unpleasant period behind you and get a fresh start.     Dreaming of dying yourself indicates an end to your worries and the start of a new era in your life. It was a good sign that you didnt run away; You faced what was coming.  However, you were hit by a bullet in the dream, which indicates that you should have a medical checkup. Seeing your own jaw means you will be the target of spiteful gossip which you should confront head-on or it could damage your reputation. Your neck being featured also means money is on its way to you.    Hearing screaming in your dream usually means that distressing news will follow. However, you mentioned the school bell, but not whether you actually heard it ringing. Hearing a distant bell would be a sign of good news coming. (So, maybe they would cancel out) :)    Good luck!|`|AMCuX8XPaa	Wow - what a dream!  When you are awakened by a dream it means that it's quite important.  But I have no idea what it means.  But it's a doozy!|`|p9mB8Z2Kaa	does that teacher scare you?  is that class stressful to you? in other words, do you have trouble keeping your grades up in that class?  have you seen someone die before? like in real-life. not in movies.  you could have seen a scary movie before that.    -To dream that you die in your dream, symbolizes inner changes, transformation, self-discovery and positive development that is happening within you or in your life. Although such a dreams may bring about feelings of fear and anxiety, it is no cause for alarm and is often considered a positive symbol.  Dreams of experiencing your own death usually means that big changes are ahead for you. You are moving on to new beginnings and leaving the past behind. These changes does not necessarily imply a negative turn of events. Metaphorically, dying can be seen as an end or a termination to your old ways and habits. So, dying does not always mean a physical death, but an ending of something.
7h5zhoJqaa	You can donate money to charities who help poverty directly by feeding, clothing, and otherwise financially assisting the poor.  You can also assist education efforts for disadvantaged children and adults.  In my mind, this is arguably a better cause.  Education leads to better employment which brings people out of poverty.    And fivetoze, the UK poverty stats are just a hair better than the US.  You guys are far from the Scandanavian countries, and also well below other European countries.|`|GR8jsGgLaa	The (ONLY) solution to deal with poverty is education.

Yep, it's unromantic, and so on and so forth...but it is EQUAL.    UNTAMED ROSE, YOU ARE EXACTLY RIGHT.

Some women will get pissed if he trys to pay for anything.   and neither group really wants to tell the poor man ahead of time.|`|9a8dcc5b6d79b07abd75628d8b093129aa	Yes, pretty much both partners can do whatever they want.|`|62ZBofvPaa	Nooo...the dating world laaaaaags like none other....    -Guys buying girls more presents  -Guys buying girls more dinners+drinks  -All that chivalry stuff.  -Girls have to be as passive as possible....don't make the first move etc etc etc.    It's not true 100% of the time.  I'm like **** it, I love buying dinners and presents for people (not even just my boyfriend but my girlfriends too)...    But it is true maybe 70% of the time...kind of annoying but there you go.

But that's not to be expected considering the disparities of the goals of the genders.    Women date in order to get money.    Men date in order to get sex.
SzNpagjlaa	I don't have any idea why are you feeling guilty?    But I'll try to help you though, it might be because you yourself are causing problems on your education.

vijGOcPCaa	What you should do is find a new guy the fact of the matter is you will not get him "back" if you can even call it that, he has obviously moved on. What you can do though is you yourself have to move on. If you are still stuck on him its because that is what he wanted you to do you are eating out of the palm of his hand. Guys like him flirt with girls like you just to see if they can get you when they know they have won they cut if off and move on to a new target to challenge there skills. Focus more on school, your friends, and new boys. Trust me there are tons out there, and they are looking. It is true that time heals all wounds eventually you will think less about him, the more you focus on your life, and then the day will come when you do not think about him at all. Every time you see him, just ignore him. He is wasting his energy on blowing off girls like you, and that while you have moved on to bigger and better things he is stuck in his same old routine. Psychologically i would say that he is unhappy with himself and while he may act confident and cocky he go's after so many girls because he wants to validate himself in his own mind. Trust me don't give him the time of day when you see him next time, out of sight out of mind.|`|8q09cPiBaa	don't stoop down to his level yo,    i mean he ditched you (you are sure right?)  when this happens, it usually means he got a girlfriend during the period that he has not been talking to you    so, either set your focus on something else  or, eventually he might talk to you after he's over his girl  or, when you pass by him at school just talk to him about it.    be like, man why did you ditch me when you said you were going to show|`|fkgYL6TSaa	It just takes time!

oo9ZNCTTaa	Do the worst thing first...everything is SO much easier then.   Share the load with a friend or family member or fellow employee.  Let go of the "lesser" things-check your priorities.  Drop one chore/responsibility each day  Life's too short and you are dead too long!! LIVE

Swmd0P2uaa	I lost my apartment and had to move far away from my job. This was in December. I have been looking for work since then, and no call backs! fortunantly I got a shift or two here nd there with an old company, but I have to agree with the third guy, keep your job. You can hand out your resume and maybe you'll get a call back. But even if you do, look at the business first and think about how stable theya re. Are they cutting back too? (you gotta cover your butt!) Ask your manager about the lease issue. I worked at one corporate retail chain for a very long time and got to see how it works (I was close with my boss) corporate tells you everything is fine up until the last week. They do that sometimes, to keep you from quitting before they close. (they wouldnt have any employees for their final days).      Collect unemployment if they fire you. Its not a lot, but it is somthing. Somthing is better than nothing right. As to what to think/do? Stay calm, deep breaths, get some sleep, you probablly have to work tomorrow. One day at a time....|`|ec6b4fb07cc60e9ae7bef47000091ab4aa	Depending on your relationship with your manager, you could be blunt and just ask for the truth straight up. It is a common practice for management to say all is well right up to the end.

You could take a low paying job or wait until this economy comes back, and it will. We just have to invest here in the US and not be so quick to squander our money overseas untill our own ship is in order.    As a business owner myself I have a different take on all of it. I was a young man when the Carter administration turned the economy on it's ear. There were two major problems at the time, unusually high energy prices which rose quickly, to quick for the economy to pass the expense of it along to the consumer before it cut deeply into the bottom line. Second problem was, as the high fuel prices eventually began to be added to the cost of goods, inflation soared. Add to that high interest rates, mortgage rates of nearly 22 % on a three year baloon. I guess the banks wanted to make money during a time of economic strife. Back then however, you had to have at least 20% down in order to buy a home. The relaxing of this very requirement led to much of the problems we are experiencing.  Further, when fuel prices at the pump rose quickly again it removed much of the extra spending money people used for eating out, recreational activities, buying electronics, furniture, and on and on.  My business territory covers a 200 mile radius and believe me I lost my rear end due to high fuel costs which were impossible to pass along to my customers, as they were fighting the same high costs  of deliveries and costs of goods rising, In turn, their customers were being stifled. Also, the number of customers that didn't pay their bill rose. It's bad. The gold standard has been out for quite a while. There has been many years of money being printed out of thin air. Despite what anyone believes devalues the dollar, inflation in my experience devalues the dollar. When fuel prices at the pump rose my dollar dropped considerably. Remember anything and everything is transported. Even my grocery bill jumped 50 % in two years. The farmers that plow the fields, the loggers that harvest the lumber, trains , planes, trucks, the hardgoods made from petroleum.  Even when minimum wage is raised it's inflationary because it gets passed along to the consumer. Corporations moving plants off shore and over the border. Greed on walstreet.  Very complicated.

If you have never been hungry, I mean have not ate because there was no food, you would know how great it is to be able to go to the store and leave with food.|`|rp7ghi4Uaa	we are too used to having it all.  We're spoiled, greedy and ignorant.  Nobody wants to work for what they want.  This may be the wrong context but i'm answering it as if you're talking about living quality     What did u mean by scarcity|`|UfELDZoMaa	Because Vanity is sold to the American public at practically by Media manipulation, almost such as at the same cost as selling one's soul.    We live for today, Live for ourselves. Consume products and spent large amounts of money on non-sense because we believe it can make us happier in the long run. We are such a Competitive Nation that we must show all those around us that we are strong. And to show we are strong, we must show that we have More than others around us. Such as buying BMW's and Mercades Benz cars. Even though these cars look no better than a Honda! If someone is going to spend 60,000 dollars on a car, but something Exotic. Not some average looking car just for it's name.    But basically, It's the Competitive issue. Like a bunch of Sharks in a feeding frenzy.|`|4c3d98ae9cf7e80862067b4993edd82caa	While I don't appreciate, as an American, being part of BLANKET STATEMENTS such as this, I can give you a somewhat legitimate answer. I've studied history and historical politics for a while, so I believe I have a basic idea I think to this very generic inquiry.    Because of the position of the US in the world, both geographically and politically, the country has always been more likely to go about things in its own way, relative to the rest of the "industrialized" world [i quote that, because some people think the "first world" countries are the only ones worth mentioning, but there's an entire world of people in the so-called "second/third world" that are just as legitimate as us. But for continuity, I'll use those terms for this answer].  The US is more or less on its own continent from the rest of the first-world. It has never had to feel direct political pressure from adjacent first world nations, and never had direct cultural influence [if you dont count internet, etc] from other nations [in fact, the US seems to dominate the entertainment industry, so there's even less influence from foreign countries via that medium]. So the US has always gone on its "own path". This is the preface.    Now, after WWII, and the cultural stress that came along with it, the people of the US had a renewed sense of pride in themselves. And in their eyes, why wouldn't you? It seemed to them that their nation "saved" the allies from defeat, and they had the most vibrant economy in the world at the time to boot. So, because of these factors, it was seen in the US from the 1950s that to be American was to live to your fullest; get the best job, have the best family, make the most money, live the most comfortably. Why do you think every image from the '50s makes people seem "perfect"?   Now comes the following decades. We enter into a stalemate cold war with Russia, since we are the two superpowers of the world. Enter even more nationalism and pride. Compared to the totalitarian, "evil" communists, to be American is to be FREE, and live as you like! In fact, telling one to live "scarcely" at that time would be likely to get you labeled as a Communist! It was simply un-American! We have all this opportunity and grandeur, why not live as well as we can!  Then comes the hippie movement, free love, civil rights, etc. All important to the mindset of living in this country.    In the decades since, while the issues have changed, so many of the ideals from the time seem to have held [as often they do in ANY country throughout their life]. This sense of pride, nationalism, and identity, seem to have made parts of today's US very affluent, and prone to living lavishly- WHETHER OR NOT it's in their means to do so! And so comes the issues of eating in moderation [obesity being a major issue], trying to live above your means because it's socially "normal" [affluence, again], and just all around forgetting the values of scarcity and moderation.    Personally, I wish people would learn these values again. The United States used to be THE first-world nation of scarcity and humility. Hopefully, as all of these first world nations today [US, Europe] become humbled by economic woes, environmental concerns, and the plight of the "third world", we will again return to living within our means.
4H4dUBkGaa	Maybe, but that depends on how you define "just friends."    I think that the attraction between friends is not very different from the attraction between lovers. People can feel very intimate with close friends, and that intimacy isn't so different from intimacy with a lover. The difference seems to be one of boundaries and definitions. One could say that lovers are close friends who have sex...and certainly it's possible to go a lifetime without having sex with someone. Of course, people can be lovers without having sex too, if each person gives that title to the other.|`|cdPMyXx0aa	yes of course  they cud ,if each of the 2 have their own men an women  as husdand an wife an if they cud understand the true friendship of their husband n wife|`|KT7cllsLaa	It is possible  I know of more mix-sex friends AFTER they ended up their sexual relationship, then straight-out friends.

The only reason I don't see this happening, is that one or the other is in a relationship, or there is no sexual chemistry between the two (They are in no way attracted to each other physically)...|`|sE94HgDBaa	It is my belief that they can.|`|dBkEqT2naa	No. Unless one of them is/acts gay.|`|rFFYCmOGaa	Rare but absolutely.|`|iUzSlmSbaa	I believe that it is possible if they are not physically attracted to each other but like each other as people.. each others personalities. but not enough to fall in love.. then I do believe it's quite possible to be a friend to a man as a woman and vice versa without being gay or lesbian..  the physical attraction is just not there.. but the friendship is there.. so it does happen to have a platonic friend and he can be in a relationship with someone else.. and if all are friends this may work out and not cause jealousy...  if the woman has a partner..  and the guy has a female partner and they all are friends.. then this can work out.. if they include their partners in the friendship .. if that is possible then all of them can be friends .. and no jealousy is present. Doesn't happen too often but it does happen.|`|habVAikEaa	HELL NO, one of them will probably go nuts.|`|VVk0hHgpaa	sure! why not?  just because they're opposite sexes, doesn't mean that they're sexually attracted to each other.|`|XNx2PbIvaa	Why not?|`|Is6tvTrfaa	Why not?

You can talk about anything under the sun but that person is just not the 'ONE'.|`|rJBJzpSJaa	I think friendship between two heterosexuals of the opposite sex is possible. We must however consider the fact that these "friends" have already assessed one another for sexual partner potential and came to the conclusion that friendship is the limit of their bond. Yet, how often is one individual in the "friendship" secretly harboring feelings for the other? Also, is one or both maintaining the "friendship" in case they are unable to find a preferable sexual partner?  Based on these facts, is this form of friendship the same as that between to heterosexuals of the same sex? No, because the to same sex friends never sized each other up sexually. The friendship instead developed based on situation, common interests, etc. In opposite sex heterosexual relationships this bond develops after sexual possibilities are exhausted.|`|ysZFwYe6aa	if both of them are really heterosexual and they don't have boy/girl friend and their personalities r compatible i think they can never be just friends
zZY3JX30aa	They are what you make them. Your life, your choice.|`|76fYDbsCaa	Well each and every person has a different view of aesthetics; the appreciation of good or bad taste. Some like blondes, some don't, and some like guys and some others think that's creepy. I think beautiful is something that makes your heart jump out and want to keep that special image locked in your heart. You see beauty in what you admire and come to think as beautiful because you have grown to love it. I think something you love is beautiful. I love sunsets,moonlight,the sea, and music. Beauty is in the eyes of the beholder. It's a shame though that a lot of people in this age just care about appearances and about pure vanity, it's a shame...that beauty is not what something looks like but what something truly is.|`|vOE0gL4zaa	beautiful is something you want to look at. ugly is something you don't|`|GSZGmH14aa	I took a humanities class my freshman year of college.

bGlZ8I2iaa	There seems to be some cognitive dissonance at play here. Diverse culture and multicultural are two different concepts. You cannot be an American and claim any other cultural affiliation.     The American culture is well defined. In most respects it has improved over the centuries. Further improvement can only happen if the people act towards that end. You are either an American contributing to that end or you are not. While the only constant in this world is change, in order to improve we ought to strive for change for the better. The end dictates the means; the end does not justify the means. If the means and the end are incongruous, the entire process is nullified.     Using Hispanic as an example, how much influence is there represented in the American culture? Yes, plenty. Those Hispanic traditions are assimilated into the American culture. But how is celebrating Cinco de Mayo congruent with being American? If America was 'just like Mexico', how would that be an improvement? If a sociopolitical atmosphere as exists in Mexico is better, then why come to America? Why did so many Hispanics fight on the side of the Texicans during the Texas Revolution? With an accepted standard for American English being in place for over two hundred years, how devisive is it to not assimilate into that language?    If you were to look around, you'll find plenty of folks that are proud of their assimilation into the American culture...the true 'melting pot tradition'...rather than wanting to 'make America just like where they came from'. To quote Joseph Campbell, "When we celebrate our similarities we prosper. When we celebrate our differences we self destruct." 'Us and them' is the single most destructive device to any organization.     This is not a new problem. It is one that has been redressed periodiclly. Read what Teddy Roosevelt had to say about it a hundred years ago. His words hold true today.    http://www.hornmouthpiece.com/Americanis...|`|Swmd0P2uaa	It is not the multi-culturism that concerns me. (This is a great part of America). But the social problems that coincide with the change. For instance, illegal aliens reaching an estimated 15-20 million in the year 2004 has contributed to overcrowded schools, hospitals and prisons, TAXPAYER costs for benefits, added strain on gov't funded programs and security, increase in poverty rates, unemployment and a shortage in public safety.    But I like your positive outlook!
Y4GAddyaaa	A woman who allows a man to abuse her, either physical or emotional or both, has very low self esteem.  She probably has seen this happen with parents or other important figures in her life.    So, it may be the norm for her, with her low self esteem.  She is also terrified that she is unable to financially support herself, so she stays.      The uncle is the person who is probably an abuser himself.  Why would he bring her back to an unhealthy relationship?    Abused woman are usually timid, and let family relationships go by the wayside.  Actually, this is the male's decision.      She is fearful most of the time, waiting for the next beating.  So she tries her best to please her man.    Or in this character's instance, if the uncle keeps bringing her back, she plans on ridding herself of the abusive, bullying, uncle and the bullying lout in her life.|`|AA12246255	They just learn to BLOCK BAD stuff out in order to be happy...That is how she copes..otherwise she would go insane...Also she keeps telling herself .."I am a good person and this guy is trapping me; so he makes up stuff about me; but eventually people will know."or some self talk like that.|`|CGvjALPOaa	this is similar to the phenomenon known as Stockholm Syndrome. the victim does not like the fact that they are being abused, but relate to it either by believing that they somehow deserve it, or holding the abuser on a high pedastool, feeling secure knowing that the abuser really loves her.|`|Lfc9Zav2aa	where is the "hero" aspect? the guy that she really wants to be with but he don't know where she is.

Fo9ADQLBaa	Well, this is really hard to do.  When there is no trust in a relationship, the relationship has no foundation or bonding to hold it together.  If you feel you must keep this friendship in tact, keep some distance between you, because there are bound to be arguments and hard feelings.  This is inevitable.|`|dBkEqT2naa	If one of your friends often tell lies that it's evident that you should not trust this person.

She will then keep adding onto the lie in the uncomfortable silence.  When she runs out of lies and it is obvious to you both that she is lying, just say in a concerned way, "Why do feel like you have to lie?"  If she gets mad, or says she doesn't or gets all defensive just say, "I'm your friend and I like you for who you are, so there is no need to lie about things, besides it is beneath you."    That way you are reassuring the friendship and giving her constructive critisism.  Hopefully at the same time making her see the truth and stop.    If she continues to lie, everytime just say, "you don't need to do that."  Or "you're doing it again".  And change topics.    Best wishes to you.|`|f1beDbKIaa	I have a good friend who lies all the time.  We've been friends for about 30 years now.  She knows i know it.  She's always known it.  And though i won't say she never lies to me, i will say she's always got some reasonable goal, and it's just easier to stretch the truth, bend some rules, than it is to explain it. She has an incredibly good memory, and can keep straight who she told what and when.    About 15 years ago, she'd gotten worried about some complicated set of lies that she'd spread around.  Everyone got a different story, and it turned out that they were going to get together, and it would come up, and they'd find out.  She asked me for advice.  I said that it was indeed complicated, but that though i could probably remember all that, i really had no experience with this, as i never lie.  "Never" she asked?  "You tell me" i replied.  It took her a full minute to go through everything i'd ever said over 15 years.  Then, she said "Oh my god".    So the deal is, you can be totally straight with a chronic lier.  It can totally work.  But you do need to let it slip what it is that you know, and what you expect.    So, i didn't really help her.  But i did end up buying her a little tiny dog.  And nearly right away, this dog started attacking her cats.  Really, a vicious animal. And i forget which animal(s) were given way gratis.  And she has loaned me stuff (that she's never getting back).

Lctb4qTfaa	Plato thinks that we have preconceived idea about everything like a mold that gives shapes. whatever we see and know according to him is as a result of recollections of the world of ideas. That is his theory.  It really depends on what you believe in. Socrates believed that we should rely on observations i.e our senses and our power of reasoning to come to conclusions because only our senses are reliable. As Plato spoke of the world of the forms, a location where all universal forms subsist, Aristotle maintained that universals exist within each thing on which each universal is predicated. So, according to Aristotle, the form of apple exists within each apple, rather than in the world of the forms.But this is philosophy.    So, answering your question, It really depends.Some say that our senses are not reliable. In fact it is deceiving. But others says that knowledge gained from our senses are accurate. There is really no one right answer!    Maybe it is also attributed to the values that we are born with- to distinguish what is wrong to what is right. We need not see the act of killing to know that killing another is wrong..    These are only some of the examples. I am sure if you ponder upon it, you would find more instances whereby we just know it without actually seeing, touching, tasting etc it..|`|KfkmB4X2aa	Yes. Where else would it come from?|`|rMoqWxDGaa	From the explanation of the lady before me that gave a whole bunch, don't make sense.   Every thing we know not necessary come from our sense knowledge came from the brain. And the sense is the ones that Collects the knowledge for the first time, and the next time something happens, you know what to do cause it happened. For example, let me use the wet guy again  If you first saw someone is wet and your mom told you they're wet, your sense puts the information into your brain. And the next time you see a wet guy, it reminds you of what happens previously to the first time you saw someone wet, and the term "Remember, or Memory" They're De Javu that you don't notice. When it's a feeling that it had happens but it is strong then you notices it. We never carefully pay attention to what's happening so we don't often notice lots of things.|`|U3j7oVflaa	No, the "senses" are smell, touch, taste, vision, and hearing...    We learn a lot from these things...  but... much of what you "know" you've never "sensed" but "derived"...    Your ability to think teaches you things...     For instance, you see a bullet on the table... I place another object beside it, different color, different shape, different feel, even tastes and smells different...  but, you somehow know that it's just a different "caliber" of bullet.      Then you know that it's fired from a different kind of gun, etc etc etc...    This is "inferred" knowledge...  you can correlate information in your head to learn and discover new things and possibilities that logically make sense.     A man walks in covered in water...  you know a giant list of possibilities for how he became wet, but your "senses" will tell you nothing other than the fact that he is wet.  But, because you know it's supposed to rain today, and there's no river in the area, and it wouldn't make sense for him to spray himself with a hose in cold weather... you "know" he got wet in the rain.    Make "sense"?|`|O939tzHSaa	Yes are senses teach us what we know, they build upon are brains learning and understanding mechanisms... I don't know whether computers can achieve conscious states.
ohUm00RYaa	Portugal by far.  Portugal has always been behind the rest of west europe because it had a dictator up until like 1975 so they were kinda isolated.    The next weakest economy is france because it is in need of serious reform.  While France is not poor their current system is completely unsustainable and they will face economic collapse in about 20 years if they cannot cut their social programs.  The problem with this is that french politics is inherently social so people will either have to change their values or have a generation of 80 and 70 year old homeless people.  Not to mention its high unemployment and waves of unemployed illegal and legal immigrants who face significant racism in finding employment, this broke out into full scale riots a few years ago and they are in a ageneral strike right now.|`|RKId3WQxaa	Luxembourg  or may be Monaco|`|7h5zhoJqaa	By total GDP it would be Luxembourg & Lichtenstein on the mainland.  Iceland is much lower in GDP, though, and is officially part of Europe.    It's probably best to look at GDP per capita though.  Lichtenstein has the highest GDP per capita of any country in the world.  Luxembourg & Iceland are up near that top, too.  The lowest in western Europe is Portugal, followed by Greece and Cyprus.

Most people do, some can't control themselves and that's why we have psychopaths and the such, I mean pretty much anybody has evil thoughts or sinful thoughts, no matter the religion,the wealth, the social class, the age, everybody has these. I learnt in Lord of the Flies, that if you left little kids abandoned in a island, they would make groups and wage war and eventually hurt or kill each other because of their savage and primal minds. Every human has some sort of savagery, we are still beasts, but beasts that can rationalize and think unlike any other. So we have morality, and know between right and wrong. You shouldn't feel ashamed of it at all, but don't lose control of yourself.
dmCyY2SKaa	I don't know, I thought it was chocolate that was enjoyed by women? I don't have much of a sweet tooth myself. I like my coffee, tea, etc sweetened but I rarely eat cake, cookies, ice cream, chocolate, sweets, etc. I do occasionally crave chocolate before/during my period, but I usually don't eat any chocolate then either.    I have noticed before that women like sweets and chocolates more than men, but this isn't always true. My ex used to have a huge sweet tooth, he wouldn't feel satisfied unless he ate something sweet after every meal. I'd be sitting there eating extra sharp cheddar cheese with crackers and he'd be eating chocolate chip cookie dough Ben & Jerry's ice cream.

AwAw0uiKaa	I think it would help you to develop interest in a hobby or project outside of school to help distract you. Some people have a hard time making the adjustment between being used to not having anyone to suddenly having connections to people. I understand that confusing feeling that doesn't really seem to make any sense. It's best to distract yourself from it because it is one of those petty things our minds dwell on when it's confused and in a state of transition. There's nothing you'll be able to do that will better your situation if you dwell on it and try to analyze it.     Be happy with the friends you have, try to focus on some sort of project outside of everything, join an after school club, volunteer at an animal shelter or a museum... something to help you feel useful and productive when you are not in the company of your friends. Trust me. KEEPING BUSY HELPS. It seems like running away from the issue, but it actually helps detach you from the issue long enough to come back to it objectively.    I hope this all makes sense. I wish you luck.|`|RTxFNURzaa	I feel the exact same way i have alot of friends but i always feel like an emptiness inside maybe its just a phase or somethin.

Sorry. But you know what? Your family still loves you, your popular,   (if you have a lot of friends)  But, there is something physiologicall insidethat'ss bothering you. Maybe u should see a therapist if u feel like that. I know it may sound retarded but u wont have to tell anyone. And it can truly help you. I know are in a tough time, but keep strong, and try, no matter what, to keep holding on. :) hope i helped.
TCB2C8NPaa	A double-blind is where neither the participants nor the researchers know who is in what condition of the study (i.e., who is taking a placebo and who is taking the real drug).    A single-blind is where just the participants don't know which condition they are in, but the researchers do.  These types of studies are criticized on the basis that if the researchers know who is in what condition, they may influence the outcome to get the results they are looking for.    Edit: Your welcome.  Glad I could help.  ;)

In fact, one definition of economics is "the science which studies human behaviour as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses." (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarcity)
fJ7E43kWaa	It's when people pose limits to themselves, rather than having the limits forced upon them. Yes, it can be a good thing because it shows self control.
YOKJP1evaa	Something tells me that you might want to find someone else who wishes to spend time with you.  Seems like he is not being realistic about where the relatonship between you and him is going.  Why waste your time with someone who won't waste theirs with you?|`|lvIPNDbgaa	If the time isn't right, it being Valentine's Day won't make any difference. Unless you formalize the situation, asking him to make plans on Valentine's Day will just make things uncomfortable. He can say no and leave you feeling hurt, or he can say yes and it can be an evening of forced happiness.
86BzRdIfaa	There's nothing wrong with asking someone to see a movie with you.  If both of you are single, then odds are that he isn't doing anything on that day and you could treat it like any other day of the year :)    Hope this helps|`|GSZGmH14aa	I dont see why not. however if you dont want a full relationship you need to make sure he knows that seeing is to how that could look like a date on v day.. ya know?      talk to him and go for it|`|Qr7M32wOaa	If neither of you are currently in a relationship, go for it.

76fYDbsCaa	Yeah, but psycho's usually don't hurt themselves because they have narcissist issues and a superiority complex. I think you may have something else, so you should seriously consider seeing a psychiatrist.I think you may have extreme depression because this involves thoughts of suicide and murder thoughts. You need someone there for you and I suggest telling someone in your life even thought I know it's hard for you because they may thing you're crazy/insane and you may think you'll end up being separated.       "The very least you can do in your life is to figure out what you hope for. And the most you can do is live inside that  hope. Not admire it from a distance but live right in it, under its roof. -- Barbara Kingsolver    Have hope for it is the last thing that dies.|`|nyPmnlbSaa	Yes immediately rush to a psychiatrist and tell ur parents!|`|yerK8PJ9aa	ok. with the murdering thing. imagine. like really imagine if someone just wanted to murder one of the people you love. some random who just got angry...you know. think of that. or some bastard who wanted to take your life away cause they dislike oyu. and yes darl you should go see a phycologist about your depression. i think once that subsides you'll start to feel normal again. think about someone who loves you. =  )|`|rnUr1JJ7aa	yea i see what u mean because im going through some hard times and i express all of my anger on my brother like just about 4 hours ago i was yelling at him and i told him i wanted him to die which i take back because i love him but im gonna through these things i cant help i think that u should go to a theropist and get help because what if it gets worst?|`|8mWbEFCAaa	I suggest you find a psychologist/counselor to help you with this problem or talk to a friend. Just remember to not look back upon the depressing events in life; keep your head up and move forward.    You should also talk to a teacher that you trust in school about this. I know life can be a bit of a hassle at times, but you just have to remember to move on.
9IvcV7tiaa	Very few people get to live out their dreams. My entire life I've wanted the very same as you, but after kids came, other responsibilities and then life's little twists and turns, I've kept those dreams as just that. Now my parents are old, and I want to stay nearby them. Economics keep us here. On the plus side, our home is paid for. There are birds, squirrels and raccoons in the trees in our yard, and we used to grow vegetables. I try to bring the country to the city as much as I can. I don't dwell on what isn't, but make the best of what is!|`|aLwrpMPXaa	As soon as your first child will be born, you will have a lot of other things in your beautiful mind. Everything that you've described, is truly beautiful. I thought of going back to Italy when I was pregnant, and raising it over there but my hubby had his business and partners here in NY and after so many years, he couldn't just "pack and leave". Once my children were born, I've realized, that all my dreams and goals for them and with them, had to be changed. Anything we do, revolves around them and I have the privilege of "escaping to Italy" in the summer and see my friends and family. Now, I wouldn't raise my kids anywhere else but in New York. This is their country and I make sure, they both are very proud of both nationalities. Children keep you busy and be it in the city or the countryside, they can easily enjoy both neighborhoods. Congratulations !|`|OXs0Iq1Aaa	First you should believe in these words the thing about the life is that it goes on. Even after our best efforts we can't achieve our dreams and there are only failures we see around us. What we should do now?  We should have courage in ourselves...the courage of soul is required.  There are many circumstances around us trying to beat us but we should have courage and hope. You must believe that there will be a day when you can go back to countryside, but for now you should better worry about your child's future and about your husband.  Hope it helped.  best of luck for your and our family's future.  bye|`|2PTlXs9zaa	Find a way to grow a few things of your own in your kitchen. A neighborhood trip to a farmers market. They even have those communal gardens in some cities, where you can go and help plant and gleen the benefits. Find a way to nurture some of that now, showing your coming child a taste of what you wish for in the long run.    A saying I once read, but do not exactly know where it came from. A self help book, went partially like this.  v  "Do not wait for someone to bring you flowers, Plant your own garden, decorate your own soul -  do not recall the entire verse, but it always stuck in my mind, that part.    There are grow lights, a chance to plant lettuce.  I'm a country girl. I just didn't live well in the city. But there are programs there - worth checking into.|`|TEX1iYQgaa	I think you need to get a firmer grasp on what's truly important in life.    You have your place in life ~ it is with your husband and your family. Your surroundings are what you make them. You can either embrace the life you have and find some wonderful things in your environment, or you can stubbornly resist. When you put your heart somewhere else, you end up emotionally holding out on the ones who love and need you the most.    My wife was like you. Where we live and where she wanted to be were two different things. Write me if you want to hear her story.|`|RmQ7oZfaaa	I was raised on a farm and every year we put out 2 gardens and that has stuck with me over the years.  In High School, I wanted to be a US Air Force Pilot because I was into ROTC and big, but I got married, had my boys. Some times our dreams have to take a turn for the better of all involved. I couldn't join the Military and give up custody to my boys to their father, so God put me on another path and that is the path I stick to.   Do you realize you can grow the smaller veggies in flower containers to teach your children what they are? An avocado seed suspended by tooth picks in a glass of water to show the details of roots and how that plant grows is an awesome treat to any child.  Flower containers with tomatoes in them, use broom handles to stake them up, a long container and you can grow lettuce, carrots and if it's deep enough, taters. Your resources are endless in this adventure.    Dreams never go away and why should they! Times may be tough right now, but it doesn't mean God won't Bless you with your Hearts Desires as long as you have Faith and Believe. Remember "Faith of that of a mustard seed" and mountains you can cross, dreams will come true, maybe just not right now, but save for it and keep DREAMING! Never let your Dreams go. They are apart of our substance and keep us going from day to day and God will Bless you with your dream. Strive for it, work towards it. You can't put out a garden without first plowing up the soil. So work your soil and again, God will Bless you. But you have to let him be your guide and sometimes, our dreams have to change course a few times, but you'll get there. Be patient and God Bless you and your family!|`|bAY9j21Paa	Well im kind of in the same boat. Im only 24 years old, i have three children and ive been a stay at home with since i was 18. My husband (thank god) has a great career so ive been able to stay at home and raise my babies. Children are very hard especially when its all you ever do 24 hours a day. I lose patience sometimes thinking, Im never going to get out of here, im never going to have a career, im never going to go places in life. But then i look at it like this, im ONLY 24 years old, i have my life a head of me, children are not forever and I must love and appreciate everything i have in the now... and who knows where life will take me. I am young, and have so many dreams of what i want to do, maybe i wont get to do it until im 40, but thats ok! Count the blessings you have now, and pray for how you appreciate them but want this better life for the good of all three of you.
76fYDbsCaa	Well, maybe you need to know that you have to make decisions for yourself, you can't make decisions for anyone else really.Maybe you have fear of judgement by others.Also,you may havea  a  fear of making the wrong decisions.      I remember Eleanor Roosevelt once said, ""You gain strength, courage, and confidence by every experience in which you really stop to look fear in the face." In life you have to take a risk mate, and when you learn that risking it is worth it, you will be able to. I once was afraid too, don't worry we all were. Know that its okay to be afraid, but you gotta risk it sometime, like my Spanish teacher said, no great man ever became great because he stopped because he was afraid. He had courage and took that chance and made it. You can do it, just have courage.|`|44TduxIKaa	i think that because you know that about yourself is great insight. Focus on one decision and stick with it. After you do this a few times it will get easier. Its alll in your mind . The mind is powerful but so you cann be too. Make a decision and stick to it.|`|rCZrXF2aaa	Try being more honest with yourself.  It doesn't work in every case but sometimes it's good to remember.|`|57d1ac7f50ba1de4b150dce035c710d2aa	I used to be indecisive, but now i am not so sure.....that's an old joke!    My friend taught me to toss a coin, heads for one decision and tails for the other...now I just do that and stick with it. It's like someone else made the decision for me and then I can't feel all the usual guilt, worry , etc .|`|jWBikTSjaa	You are second guessing yourself constantly.  Always thinking, "the grass is greener on the other side of the fence," thinking you made the wrong choice.  Have confidence in your choice, and don't worry so much that it might have been the wrong choice.  (Which often you find it wasn't anyway.)  Just go with it.
kKPFlDZ2aa	Yes, it most certainly is possible for trauma symptoms to resurface after many years. Especially if an event triggered traumatic memories.  Also, yes, "what if" questions are very common in trauma, its part of something called "undoing," trying to undo the trauma. This is understandable but not necessarily helpful. Please consider counseling if you are experiencing symptoms of trauma, such as re-experiencing (nightmares, recurrent memories), avoidance (feeling numb, avoiding reminders of the trauma), and/or increased arousal (irritability, feeling hypervigilant).|`|Vz5KyAbCaa	Yes. You mention you have lost weight. Many who have suffered trauma will put on weight. It is a subconscious padding against the world they fear will hurt them. That trauma stayed buried inside you festering all those years never dealt with & by releasing the protective layer you had you began to process the trauma that was it's cause. You will experience all the stages of death & dying as you process & release it. Thinking what if is very normal. There is anger in this even if unrecognized. "What I might have done, been, etc had they just..." Don't rush it, allow your self to feel it all, even the anger. Once it is processed & released then you will be able to move on past it & in time it will all fade & no longer will you have to carry any of it as a part of who you are. Be patient & gentle with yourself, you held on to this stuff for a long time.|`|cECRv4NMaa	Yes, it is very likely. Still, you can beat it by turning it around and making the what if the result of the next encounter. You know what happened the last time and how you reacted then, but now that you are older, you know now how to correct the outcome. trust in yourself and your knowledge and wisdom.  Blessed be.|`|eb71d539c6860290e80bdaa4253a2f87aa	Praire Crone,    You know that old saying "What doesn't kill me, makes me stronger."    It's a frickin lie!    Friedrich Nietzsche must have been a major putz to have said something so idiotic and false.    Trauma doesn't make you stronger, it screws you up! Anyone who uses that quote to make it seem like a trauma victim has an attitude problem obviously has no idea what they are talking about.    To be honest, your description of how you experience this trauma as if it just recently happened, sounds like you probably have PTSD. That is one of the signs of it, feeling like it just happened or like you are constantly reliving it anytime anything triggers the memory of it. I have PTSD, related to the military and to childhood trauma, and it does feel like I have been irrevocably damaged. However, I have learned some great skills that have helped me to live a mostly normal life, and I also take supplements that help to support my adrenal glands, which were damaged by all the stress I lived through.    You too may have adrenal issues because of your trauma, along with PTSD. You might want to seriously consider seeing a mental health professional who specializes in dealing with serious emotional trauma and see if they can help you.     It can get better, so don't give up...but don't let people minimize your pain either. Anyone who does that is completely out of touch with the reality of extreme emotional trauma.     You deserve peace from this thing that WAS NOT YOUR FAULT. It was not your fault! I know that, because no one can make another person be cruel; that person is completely culpable for their cruelty. The moment you let go of the tendency to blame yourself for what happened (it is clear from your question that you are blaming yourself), then it will be much easier to move on from it. It was their problem not yours, and it is time you gave it back to them energetically.     You deserve peace, so reach for it by getting help.    Blessings,    Vitamin|`|vgpuTBmSaa	oh it is so common that some of us will never be able to decipher why we do things the way we do. and what if is the question that always has at least 2 answers, positive or negative. like when i got injured and could no longer be on the cheerleading team, i was not happy. i had planned to go pro someday.  oh i am now so glad that i did not go that route. i have deeper spiritual undestanding and i am not stuck with a couple of pom-poms  and a lot of regrets like i could have been.  i won't go into any of the more traumatic things tonight, but each of them had some positive aspect. but i do understand you a little more, i think, because i had a venomous christian experience also.|`|baW9sSsLaa	It depends on whether the trauma has truly been resolved or not.  If it has, then it will become only more distant as time passes.  However, if it hasn't truly been resolved--if it's only been dealt with or walled off, or otherwise pushed aside--then yes, it will keep resurfacing until it is resolved.    This is something that only you can do,and only you can determine what "resolution" means in your case.  I can tell you that forgiving yourself, and those who hurt you, is probably going to be a big part of that, and only you can really do that.  It hurts, it's frustrating, and darn it, it's not fair, but that's often the cost of true healing.    Good luck with this, and blessed be.|`|uBX7R6xvaa	Yes, it can sometimes take a while to get to the point that one can face certain traumas that happened in childhood and heal them.  This world is quite messed up morally, and lot of people are made aware of this fact by having something bad happen to them early in life.  Hopefully they eventually heal themselves of the trauma that results and become a more aware and empathetic person.  Life can be really brutal, but one must do ones best to become spiritually strong and sensitive so as to be able to be helpful in changing the conditions in this world to move it in a better direction spiritually.      One can use meditation,  mind-body techniques(not done excessively), and a healthy diet, to make one gain in spiritual strength and heal oneself.  Meditation can be valuable when used more like an exercise and with the focus being on that which is uncomfortable to deal with(emotions - often related to the past, desires etc).  Meditation is sometimes used more like a drug with the focus being on escaping the hard side of life into some blissful state.|`|JOChNigNaa	Such things will only surface when we're ready to deal with them, unless another crisis makes it so we have to deal with them.

I know I do. However there often is a difference between individual feminists beliefs and feminist organizations beliefs. Organizations are easier to corrupt than individuals, so you can find lots of sexist feminist organizations, but very few sexist feminists. Which is why I don't join any organizations myself, because the chances are I wont support all of their views.   Guys do have their own groups too. For example fathers for justice. I think this is a good thing since often organizations can forget about supporting men as well. However I think stronger links ought to be made between men's rights and women's rights organizations, if they work together they are less likely to become corrupt and will probably be able to work more efficiently.|`|E2xG6bpnaa	We do it is called the business leaders of corporations.|`|c77cjTOeaa	The guys have every right to organise into groups.

ohUm00RYaa	All the other people are crazy don't know their azz from a hole in the ground.    You see you already started off the question wrong to begin with.  Ask yourself why are the popular kids popular?  In any given school only a very smal percent of kids are THE populars.  But who makes them popular?  Surely not the other kids, because the truth is many people don't even like The populars because they are popular but yet they want to hang out with them.    See popularity comes from insides youself.  No one makes you popular.  I'm not joking, all "popular" people really have is confidence that lik 95% of teens lack.  See if you have the right attitude about it, the populars will want to get in with you?    The first step is to treat all the other popular kids like they don't matter and that you don't care about them.  Form your own group and do the things that will make you seem hella cool.  For guys this is picking up hot girls and being the bad boy.  From what I remember in high school popular girls were the ones who drank, partayed, smkoed weed, and dated lots of guys(good looking) and were just fun to be around.  Once you hog up all the attention and no one even realize that these former popular kids even exist, they will try to hang around you and be your friend.  They may even start to say we never realized how cool u were before.  O yeah and most of all they were HOT.  And even the ones who weren't hot, dressed sexy so they still got guys.    Don't try to be them, they are them, people who try to act like others show they don't know who they are, lack a real identity, have no confidence in themselves and people really try to avoid these people who are known as bitters or copycats or losers.    Imagine how shitty those popular girls will feel when they realize that all the guys want you, everyone wants you and no one wants to be their friend.  It will basically destroy them and make them all losers    But be forewarned if you try this an don't pull it off right, and if you are a girl and not very good looking even with your make-up (at least as good looking as the 2nd or 3rd hottest girl in the popular group) then you may make a total aszz of yourself.    Highschool kids are superficial and I have yet to meet a good looking person in a highschool who was unpopular.|`|8iQFdkIhaa	don't be yourself, dress like them, act like them, walk like them, and talk like them.|`|6e902ba5b8bd99003ad43ac387de6637aa	Why would you want to?

If they binge and purge, be sure to do that, too, or if they starve themselves, well, guess you gotta do that.  Because being popular is SOOOO important that it doesn't matter if you lose yourself in the process.  Right?    You tell us not to advise you to be yourself.  Well, I'm going to anyway.  When you are 25 or 30 or 40, do you want to be standing in a room of people who are going on and on about all of their accomplishments, and all you have to say is "well, I was a conformist wannabe who was in the POPULAR crowd.  Yeah.  Top THAT, Mr. Brain Surgeon and Ms. Governor!"    If the "populars" are genuinely good-natured, honest, decent people who you WANT to be friends with and who are worthy of your friendship, then be yourself, make yourself available and approachable, and try to strike up friendships.  If the only reason you want to have anything to do with these people is because they are popular, then don't waste your time.  Why not develop strong, lasting relationships with others who share your same interests and goals, popular or not?    The whole popular crowd thing might mean something in your high school (or jr. high or elementary school), but once you hit college, everyone starts all over again.  Most of those people don't give a crap how popular you were at some No-Name High School in Anytown, USA.  Focus on being a good person and making REAL friendships that will last you a long, long time.  I can't be more serious about that!
7h5zhoJqaa	This seemed like such a great opportunity to make a joke, but I'm drawing a blank.  I can't think of anything funny about economics, aside from the political debate going on right now, which is pretty comical.  I also can't think of anything to offer related to economics to build a party around.    I don't know, just buy some food, beer, wine & liquor and forget about modeling & curves for an evening.

It is really sad that some people are not concerned enough and how interesting, when it is not "their" property, they do not even think about economy or saving energy. This is a difficult situation, depending on your relationship to that person (family member, friend, just someone your parents try to help out etc.). You know, sometimes we can not be as straight with a friend or someone we know if we are not sharing that kind of close relationship. I would suggest to try to talk to them and make a point. As I see from your posting, you are an open minded person. Yes, the best thing is to talk to them calmly and simply tell the facts that economy is not as stable as it was and energy prices are going down or our money does not buys as much as it did before so if they would be so good to try cooperate with your family you would highly appreciate it. You know what I mean.    Good luck.
v1A9lxuzaa	the average person can repeat back 57 words in the correct order with no difficulty. If they are then asked to recite them again 24 hours later the average person can recite 38 of the original 57.  No, only joking, you're very good. Keep practicing and you can turn it into a gift.

OHuaBdRjaa	welll........Stop being a pussy and shallow go out one night with some buddies go to a club or somthing meet some girls dance with lots of them just so u can get used to talking to them and stuff......and u said u have some numbers yeah text them GO for it if a girl gave u her number she is interested she wants to hear from u.......just a simple text that says hey how have u been would be fine if she wants to see u she will text back then make convo and make a date and be yourself and if she doesnt like u then who cares at least u tried there are plenty more girls out there and dont think of that girl who didnt like u as a wast of time she gave u some experience so now you know how to deal with the next girl.....just be real sweet to her and dont move faster than she wants to hold her hand be sweet u will find someone u just need to leave your comfort zone u will get the hang of it go out there and try it!|`|m4zocSzwaa	Listen man I can relate to how you're feeling damn near exactly.  I met my first girlfriend when I was 21.  Don't even give that **** the time of day because i'll tell you right now it's inevitable. I mean odds are it will happen. The way you look isnt even that important, girls like guys that are laid back, funny and confident.  In the mean time I would focus on myself.  Start exercising, get hobbies, and stay relaxed with the women.  Keep your options open too, so long as she's alright looking she doesn't have to be gorgeous for you to take her out.  You'll find yourself a changed man in no time, i've been there take it from me.|`|jWBikTSjaa	First - You aren't going to get a lot of sympathy from anyone when you say you're only interested in "hot, sexy, maybe smart girls."  Really?   Align your priorities.  Looks fade, people's bodies change.  What STAYS is the personality and the intelligence.  If you want an actual adult relationship, you might consider rethinking your priorities.  Just a thought.    You are indeed frozen in your comfort zone.  Everyone works five days a week, and has a couple days off.  You need to make time to socialize in the evenings or on the weekends.  It will probably feel uncomfortable at first, because you haven't been doing it, but power-thru!  No great expectations of finding the perfect hot, sexy (maybe smart) girl.  Just go out instead of sitting home, thinking about what you want.    And for now, socialize with friends.  See if you can go out in a group (maybe mix of male and female) and just hang out and talk to people without always looking for "her."  You might find what you are looking for, and what you find might surprise you.  Pleasantly.    Good luck!|`|RMh0a3DSaa	You need to stop overthinking everything and just follow your heart. I know its not easy, but the more experience you have with girls the better you'll get. Life is too short to waste time missing out on all the fun things. Do you really want to be single & fifty years old thinking "man i wish i asked out girls back when i was young and good looking.." You can do it just try to have confidence and try to look more on the inside then out on girls. good luck.|`|NfKxRUo7aa	try being bisexual|`|z55dnFYZaa	tl;dr
hZ9omSataa	I believe that the "fight or flight" response is still necessary, despite the fact that we are not cavemen battling big animals, it assists us when we are battling each other, it helps us when we take tests, it clears our thought and we can focus clearly, our brain becomes sharper.  The issue is with anxiety disorders that cause panic attacks, that is when your "fight or flight" response occurs even when you are not being threatened, and it can last for minutes to hours, which can seriously cause damage to your well being and mental health.|`|DiDCG9UBaa	It's good to the point that it heightens your response to certain negative stimuli. For instance, fearing the dark isn't a bad thing since you are more vulnerable. The physiological manifestation prepare you for potential threats.  Taken to an extreme, the associated psychological and physiological responses can be damaging (as was demonstrated with the classical Pavlov's dogs experiment).|`|n8utZVhIaa	Anxiety is a small tick in your fight or flight response.  When your brain has difficulty determining which direction to take for a certain situation/scenario the confusion becomes manifested into feelings of stress and anxiety.|`|0a921db807e5127996280b0c3209d4d5aa	i guess it's the old 'fight or flight' instinct kicking in.  if an animal/human/creature had experienced a happening or event or situation which had frigtened or hurt him, or he had seen it harm or kill, he would be apprehensive of it, and anxiety would be the emotional response to it.  especially if it happens to be an activity that he had no choice but to participate in, and he knew that it could end up being bad for him.
Swmd0P2uaa	I think it did and does serve a purpose. When we are anxious its usually a mix of worries and fears, and always caused by some event. I think just like stress, it is part of our survival mechanism. We feel physical symptoms as a warning. Example- you fall and break your leg and theres no one around to help. You start to get stressed, your body is telling you its time to react and do something before things get worse.     Oh, or like when I am on yahoo answers way too long, I start getting anxious about my homework- because I know its there and not going to go away. If I dont do it I'll fail. So eventually I get off my butt and go do it! :-)|`|l9uGrfSYaa	I'd say it was more of a depressing thing.     Back then anxiety was based on survival of yourself and family via keeping the crops producing and earning money to provide for family needs.     Now it's just anxiety over utter drama......like all of that stuff that happens on MySpace n everything! It's just annoying that someone can't even think of sleeping because someone they don't even talk to at school blocks them or unfriends them on an internet site. Overall, our society has suffered because of the mellow dramatic drama such as the myspace, the checking of emails, having ten jobs and going to college at the same time.     Sorry, I'm trying not to vent here. So I'd better stop.     nya bya

jIk2ttH1aa	A great character IS success.    We all have demons to overcome, and if you can and be a good person you are successful.    If you look at some of the celebrities touting guns and drugs and degrating woman, and turning on their own but ---  who have lottsa lottsa money and fame-- and you call that a success than....you probably aren't of a good character to hold that point of view and thus are not successful.    Which still supports the original statement.    Round and round it goes.|`|OXs0Iq1Aaa	As you know, for everything a strong base is required and character is the base without which nothing can stand. Success is the result of truth, perseverance and strong will and nothing mare and these all are the characters of strong character.  Yes it is true time is changing and we are surrounded by characterless and selfish people but change is required and we can begin it.  So success is temporary but character is forever.  Hope it helped.  bye|`|Ti0q1Btiaa	Unfortunately, too many think so.    Politicians come to mind.    My parents never spoke of the importance of good character.

vAdtlZDpaa	Dreams tell you how you are feeling about a situation and are a mechanism for your own subconscious to communicate with you about things that you may overlook in your waking life. So, yes, dreams are meaningful, but in a symbolic way.     Dreams do not tell you how others feel or what others are thinking.    Except for the case of prophetic or precognitive dreams, which are not as common.|`|P0EAzyw8aa	the difference between dreams and premonitions are this with a premonition you can for see the event a short or a long time before it occurs the details exact.

Check it out: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echolalia|`|Ahud6tPZaa	Not Echolalia, as Dr Wikipedia tried to diagnose...    It's probably just a habitual thing. Does it happen all the time? Or in situations where you're maybe a little bit nervous?    If it is habitual, perhaps a good way to overcome it is to consciously ensure that, after you've said something, your lips are closed together. Eventually, after a couple of weeks, you may find that the mouthing repetition will vanish altogether.
t1OSx5VOaa	Oliver Sacks, in his book Seeing Voices, wondered if schizophrenic deaf people saw people signing at them.   He said it would take a very skilled psychologist or psychiatrist, who was very good at sign language (and therefore probably deaf) to find out.    He gave an example of an older lady, who was sleeping on a chair and seemed to be knitting while sleeping.  He asked what she was doing, and was told that she was mumbling in her sleep.|`|jWBikTSjaa	Amazing question!  I have no idea what the answer is.  That would be very odd if someone who had always been deaf could "hear."  I know it is a way different type of scenario than hearing through one's ears, but it must be so bizarre for them if it does happen.|`|76fYDbsCaa	Yeah in their heads, schizophrenics hear voices in their heads. Not like audible voices though, just delusional kind. I think it is possible.|`|3OzLxd4Laa	Yes. Hearing voices in your head is different from hearing someone in the outside world.|`|CpfJxUfBaa	Clearly not, when one hears voices it is because they are going into your ear.

galoGEOFaa	I personally know one girl who claims to have it, but everyone she meets also seems to "develop" it. Her, her friends, and others like her use it to get attention and they use it so they can get away with doing and saying anything they want, then later claiming "I didn't do that 'Lucy' did"    The amusing thing is when her friends finally get sick of her and refuse to speak to her anymore, their MPD mysteriously goes away.    Sadly, I believe the disease does exist, but there's really no way to tell those who truly have it from the fakers who just want to use it as an excuse. I also believe the majority of the people who claim to have it fall into the latter category.|`|8mWbEFCAaa	I've been noticing that people act a lot different around some certain people and some other people.

I was married to a woman that had MPD it is now called DID dis-associative identity disorder.  My X was a heavy woman and had diabetes as a result.  Except for one of her younger personalities... the mind still recognized the body as a child.  This personality did not have it.  When she took her medication and this personality came out her sugar would bottom out.  She had to eat sugar to get the blood sugar up.  When this personality went away her sugar would sky rocket. Believe it don't believe it... whatever.  That is how I was convinced it was real.  Her social worker said in all of his 30 years working he has only seen 3 real cases of it and she was one of them.  Funny there is a girl at school doing a paper on this same thing that I am helping her with.  I don't know how to get in touch with you but look me up if you know how and I will educate more on this if you would like to hear it.|`|K2h6M1xqaa	Absolutely.    I've read a lot of stuff about this subject, from the infamous and horrifying, "Greenbaum Speech" and the 1970's sensationalist, "Operation Mind Control" and similar "Manchurian Candidate" stuff, all the way to the more mundane and less alarming literature which you have likely come across in the course of your studies.    But the thing which I find most compelling, is the simple observation of humans in their natural environment.    Humans are both highly complex, and yet painfully simple mechanisms at the same time.  The level of automatic behavior I see people using every day in the belief that they are making actual choices or acting on real thoughts is astonishing and kind of depressing.  Almost all the darkest things said about advertising are true.  It is ridiculously easy to manipulate human behavior.    I think if some of the horrible techniques I've seen described were used on a simple person, (the kind of person who can blithely repeat *verbatim* the contents of a television advert as though it were the product of his or her own unique thoughts), then you could with a bit of effort produce a mind-controlled zombie with multiple personalities.  I have no difficulty believing that whatsoever.      But you are asking about MPD, by which I assume you mean the naturally occurring variety.  Why not?  A large portion of the mind-control techniques I've seen discussed revolve around deliberately creating dissociative states in people through sustained trauma.  And as we know, trauma can happen outside the walls of a CIA-funded hospital wing.
AA11532132	I wouldn't define it as a moral obligation. The world needs all kinds of people to undertake all kinds of occupations. If everyone is fancy, whose gonna pick up the trash?    I think the important thing is that we continue to populate the world period. With the birth control, sexuality outside of marriage, and the breakdown of the family unit the population will eventually begin to fall. Economic prosperity never accompanies a fall in population. More and more people have decided that they don't want to be saddled with children.   Children are the future.

Say for instance the most beautiful woman or handsome man possesses negativity, cruelty towards living things, selfishness, greed and the list goes on, then, to me they are the least attractive and that overrides looks by far. If you are fair, caring, selfless and so on, then no matter how short your limbs may be (or any other condition) or how smart you are, you would be someone worthy of feeling great and worthy of all good things.

Swmd0P2uaa	Eating disorders (bulimia or anorexia) Western societies a tendency to judge self-worth in terms of shape and weight is superimposed on a need for extreme self control. (an irrational perception) This extreme need for self control, we must argue is most important feature of this disorder. It is also the product of poor problem solving skills.    Alternatively, it can be argued that the disorders are not social or cognitive process product, but one of the unconscous mind....(etc)    Does that work? you have all the parts to write the rest of the paper right? You just have to analyze what cognitive psychologists look st which is:    think   remember   solve problems   explain experiences   form beliefs
GSZGmH14aa	Well. I have had a few. Ill tell you the good ones though. and then one scary. My mother passed away on Friday Feb. 13 2004. For awhile afterwards I could see her and she would counsel with me and discuss what I needed to do. It has been almost five years and she still appears to me and tells me what to do and what i did wrong.     Another experience i was umm.. 8 ish. I was running through the house and tripped in the kitchen and busted up my knee. It hurt so bad i literally couldnt move. Well I heard a noise behind me. I turned around there was a black figure standing about 6.5 " tall and stocky. I couldnt see its face or skin but he spoke to me. He asked me Kenzey are you alright? I turned around took a deep breathe and was about to say yes what can i help you with but he was already gone when i turned back around.. My knee was better I jumped up ran into my grandmas room and told her everything. She smiled and started to cry. I asked why she said that was your grandpa. He healed you and was checking on you.     Okay last one for now.... I was 15 my mother had passed away two years ago. I had been seeing spirits on and off the whole time. I was sharing a room with my Aunt at the time. This cloaked figure stepped out from the bathroom. He never showed himself or his full body figure. Just his head and shoulders and an arm.. He was holding a weapon. He would call my name and you could tell he was an evil spirit. I would get so scared. He followed me often. I finally commanded him to leave and he did. Havent had a problem since then.

Looking at current feminists, such as Harriet Harman, Polly toynbee, Patricia Hewitt, etc. it seems the definition of feminist is one who seeks   a) supremacy  b) to spread lies about men as a class  c) to absolve women of any and all responsibilities - even for their own decisions  d) to blame men for any and everything wrong in the world    etc.      However, if you seek 'true' equality as oppose the 'selective' equality (as and when it is beneficial to women only and/or detrimental to men only) - then you are not a modern feminist.|`|jN8duTx2aa	You're a feminist.

What are you basing it on? Certainly the right to do what one wants as long as it doesn't infringe on someone else's rights is inherent to every human. As far as a proven equality in society, whether men "held women back" or not, women have not even come close to proving they can achieve the things that men have, although they can, but still, they haven't (in a large-scale, general manner, of course there are individual women who have while other women look on and say "See!" and then they go back to working on their Sociology majors). Men control the economy, business, engineering, the sciences, etc. This is the hardcore fundamental build a country and sustain it kind of stuff that women have yet to prove capable of. 95% of women can't even get their car running if it breaks down. All this is not for lack of seats in the higher level college physics classes or the auto body class at the local tech school, nor are there shortages of self-defense and martial arts training classes, yet the walls are filled with pictures of missing females and the crime stats are riddled with female victims.    But anyway, my point is that why not just be done with it and consider yourself an individualist? This covers all basis, including actually achieving self-reliance.|`|gKCJLyIbaa	I would drop that term "feminist" completely from your vocabulary to begin with as it only indicates that you are a male-hater and a blatant sexist completely against equality and only a female supremacist..

4apYtDp7aa	im 16, and speaking in a ADULT SENSE, i just want to say its just a period of life you gotta get through. You try to find identity and what you are good for, but alot of times you do something different and your friends laugh because it looks weird. If you need to just relax. You might not fit in but you dont have to, if they find that you're good at something then they will copy you. You're just in a period of life where you don't really know what to do with your future, what others act and how they dress, i went through it too! Like in junior high everyone is like really easy to be mocking, but it was fun because if you tease your friends and they do it to you then its fun and it's basically how i get through school. For you it looks like a problem but find a right crowd and just act normal not all scared and stressed out!|`|Glg1uph7aa	dude.. im 14 and i feel exactly the same way.  people around me just dont get it.  and i never went to church much and stuff liek that but i just dont see any reason why i should believe in my particular relgion.  i do somewhat believe that there is a possibility that there is supernatural whatever...|`|qL3dGTXDaa	When one has not learned anything new for themselves it is natural to pick on others.

65bca57f1825045efe45870949f44bf2aa	Yoga.. e a Tecnica de Medita??o Transcendental:    O que  a Medita??o Transcendental?          A tcnica da MT  um procedimento muito simples, natural e sem esfor?o, praticada duas vezes ao dia, de 15 a 20 minutos sentado confortavelmente e de olhos fechados. A MT permite que a mente se assente automaticamente alcan?ando um estado perfeitamente calmo, ordenado, integrado e alerta. Ao mesmo tempo o corpo desfruta de um repouso duas vezes mais profundo que o do sono. Durante a prtica nossa mente consciente  levada a experimentar seu estado mais fundamental - o estado de menor excita??o da conscincia, a Conscincia Transcendental.        Experimentar a Conscincia Transcendental significa desenvolver nosso potencial criativo latente enquanto que todo stress e cansa?o acumulados s?o dissolvidos atravs do repouso profundo adquirido durante a prtica.        A tcnica da MT  cientificamente validada, por esta raz?o ela n?o requer cren?as especficas nem ado??o de um estilo de vida particular. A prtica n?o envolve nenhum esfor?o ou concentra??o.  fcil de aprender e n?o requer nenhuma habilidade especial. Pessoas de todas as idades (a partir de quatro anos), de diferentes nveis educacionais, culturais e religiosos em mais de 160 pases praticam regularmente a tcnica e desfrutam da grande gama de seus benefcios.      Benefcios Cientificamente Validados          Mais de 600 pesquisas cientficas realizadas nos ltimos 20 anos, feitas por institutos independentes, em 160 universidades, em 27 pases, comprovaram os benefcios da Medita??o Transcendental em diferentes reas: mental, fsica, comportamental e ambiental. Alguns dos benefcios adquiridos pela prtica regular da Medita??o Transcendental:          1. proporciona repouso profundo - a base para a atividade dinamica      2. reduz fatores cardiovasculares de risco (hipertens?o, uso de cigarro, nvel de colesterol, obesidade,...)      3. melhora desordens relacionadas ao stress, tais como ins?nia, enxaqueca, depress?o, ansiedade, fadiga, asma bronquial      4. desenvolve a inteligncia, criatividade e melhora a clareza da percep??o      5. expande a conscincia e a paz interior      6. melhora a ordena??o e sincronia cerebral      7. aumento da felicidade interior, a qual est relacionada com mudan?as na bioqumica interna          Na Amrica do Norte um dos estudos mais notveis foi publicado em Psychosomatic Medicine, em Outubro de 1987. Examinaram-se as estatsticas de uma empresa de assistncia mdica com mais de 600.000 pessoas, a Blue Cross nos Estados Unidos, durante um perodo de cinco anos - 1982 a 1987. O grupo que praticava Medita??o Transcendental tinha 50% menos consultas a mdicos e admiss?es em hospitais do que o grupo controle. Os praticantes da Medita??o Transcendental tambm mostraram ter 87% menos doen?as do cora??o, 55% menos tumores benignos e malignos e 87% menos desordens do sistema nervoso.      Duas meta-anlises recentes, combinando os resultados de centenas de estudos sobre tcnicas de medita??o e relaxamento acabaram por corroborar a unicidade da Medita??o Transcendental. A primeira foi conduzida por um cientista de Stanford, Kenneth Eppley e aparece no Journal of Clinical Psychology em 1989. O artigo conclui que a Medita??o Transcendental produz um efeito significativamente maior do que qualquer outra forma de medita??o e relaxamento na redu??o da ansiedade.        A segunda meta-anlise, publicada em uma edi??o especial no Journal of Social Behaviour and Personality em mar?o de 1990, indica que a Medita??o Transcendental  a melhor tcnica de medita??o e relaxamento para avivar a positividade psicolgica, ou seja, o grau no qual os potenciais internos da pessoa foram completamente realizados.        Esses novos estudos contradizem a no??o comum de que todas as tcnicas de medita??o e relaxamento s?o parecidas, diz Dr. Steele Belok da Escola de Medicina de Havard.  interessante notar que a tcnica mais eficiente (a Medita??o Transcendental)  tambm a mais antiga.        Robert Schneider, mdico e diretor do Centre for Health and Ageing Studies (Centro de Estudos da Sade e Envelhecimento) em Fairfield, Iowa, EUA, disse: Descobertas sugerem que somos capazes de reduzir a arteriosclerose e retardar o processo de envelhecimento atravs da tcnica da Medita??o Transcendental, que possui efeito de equilbrio no funcionamento neurofisiolgico. Os resultados real?am a importancia do desenvolvimento da conscincia e sua influncia benfica sobre a fisiologia, como  o caso da redu??o do colesterol. O programa da Medita??o Transcendental desperta um mecanismo inato que d vida  inteligncia interior do corpo, para que este se auto-repare prevenindo a doen?a e o envelhecimento.|`|639e052809f5ca208541cac8f39a27d1aa	seja budista! A medita?ao  profunda mas vc nao perde a consciencia de seua atos e deveres, na realidade se poli para atuar de maneirta mais consciente muito bacana!

So, we probably have the same brain activity but used for different things.  At the same time, kids are expected to know so much more now when they enter kindergarten than they did 30 years ago.  Was it a lack of effort or exposure that the kids did not know those things 30 years ago?  As we try and fill our brains up, do we expand the activity in the brain?

However, I will say this. That your ancestors were curious and made other people curious......|`|O939tzHSaa	I think yes. I agree evolution is taking place all around us, but these changes are generational. While the people who lived during that period  likely shared many of the same philosophical questions and human needs   we acquire today, humanity has only progressed because of leaning, understanding and survival. People may debate about the differences,  but we all live on a single planet and to better understand are surroundings and selves is all we can do - to not would be pointless.      So is are knowledge really beneficial?    I think living is an experiment where mistakes create smarter solutions.    "Sure we drive in cars and use cell phones, but isn't that just us taking advantage of the advances of other people?"    Where all advancing together, the person who built the cell phone likely   was someone who didn't want to take advantage of the phone booth.    This is how societies create influential people. Progress.    I think that some people are slower to progress then others,  maybe there holding onto there early ancestors beliefs.    ______________________________________...

Hinduism believes in reincarnation - hence, the past life karma effects you in this life, which determines your quality of life.   Hence the statement - " It is a woman's place to be in the home.

Things usually don't manifest when you thing them they manifest them when you believe them....You can program your mind by sitting down each day & affirming what you want....If you don't know what you are thinking take a timer & put it on & keep it near by & when it dings just notice what you were thinking....OK, I am going to show you have to reverse your thinking by looking at your question. I am going to write the opposite of what you wrote or just a better thought:  I know why I do this, I am clear, I love to learn things that are helpful to me, lately I have been thinking really great thoughts & I think they are going in my life, it is done unto me as I believe & all my thoughts are positive. all my actions are good actions. I have so much faith my life keeps getting better.I know how to begin creating a great life by creating great scripts for myself.   Write down everything you are thinking then write down the opposite if it is neg.  I know that you are feeling great about this now cause your mind knows that if a neg. thought comes to it you instantly just let it go it has no power over you.|`|AA10130895	discipline    discipline the mind, with practice    when taking abnormal phychology in college,the teacher said [when you read the book you will think every diseases in the book applies to YOU  so dont think you have thouse diseases.    law if Attraction    thought+POWER+focues= action    so if you think you are a pile of stuff but you dont  put a lot of power behind it it [will not happen]    karma is actions    do good actions and you get good back even if you have to wait 15 life times for it.they never tell you that .  ___________    so write down affirmations and post them on your wall. and try to think about them not the bad stuff    like the Buddhists say    watch your thoughts and if a bad one comes , just delete it and bring your self back to you breath.|`|ZA18KoC9aa	try to relax and stay focused- things WILL always improve as time goes by- don't expect the negative thoughts to disappear right away..before you know it you'll be OK with less negative thoughts/ideas/beliefs to worry about.

Em todo caso, a frmula :    - Concentrado de A?car queimado - Caramelo - para dar cor escura e gosto;     - cido ortofosfrico (em lugar do ctrico -  azedinho, e d a sensa??o de dentes e boca limpa ao beber);     - Sacarose - a?car (HFCS- High Fructose Corn Syrup - a?car lquido da frutose do milho);    - Extrato da folha da planta COCA (frica e ndia), alm de aromatizantes naturais de outras plantas (no final,  cosmtico, n?o muda quase nada no sabor)    - Cafena    - Conservante (que pode ser Benzoato de Sdio ou Benzoato de Potssio)    - Dixido de carbono de mont?o para fritar a lngua quando voc a toma     - Bastante SAL para dar a sensa??o de refrigera??o, e nova sede depois.|`|108259aa029467971ba08895f3b2e960aa	Boa pergunta ?|`|458cce4737172c1ffe93ce6199a0e370aa	Acontece que n?o conseguiram sintetizar ainda nenhum DNA.

fd9086f4d407a4d4572ff41703a29dfbaa	Yo soy 17 anos mayor que mi esposo. El me dijo que las chicas no saben nada, no han vivido. A el le guste fisicamente, me arreglo bien. Soy educada, trabajo, se cocinar. Tengo mi propia casa, la decoro. Tengo muchos temas de que platicar (del mundo), soy inteligente, eh viajado a varios paises de Europa. Nos llevamos muy bien en la cama, (de maravilla). El me encanta, siento que el es el hombre mas bello, con el mejor cuerpo. El se siente orgulloso cuando estamos con su familia o amigos, por que yo me areglo y se que los hombres piensan que estoy bonita, yo no me miro vieja, no tengo celulitis, no estoy arrugada. Hay veces que hablan de un tema de algo que salio en el periodico de alguna parte del mundo y no saben de que se trata o alguna palabra en otro idioma, usualmente yo si se de que se trata. Vivo en los Estado Unidos y la computadora no tiene acentos. No soy vanidosa pero soy un paquete de virtudes, y entre mas edad tengo valgo mas por que adquiero mas sabiduria. Que hace pensar a la jente que tu edad = felicidad y amor. Yo nunca tuve la seguridad que tengo ahora por que se que valgo mucho, y si tuviera la oportunidad de ser mas joven y perder lo que se, no lo haria. Es como una botella de vino viejo, vale mas que una de vino nuevo, o un carro antiguo. Claro que hay sus eccepciones, si fuera una mujer fodonga, no no creo que le fuera atractiva a un joven ni a un viejo. No es la edad la que hace feliz, ni hace la compatibilidad, mas bien la educacion. Si se juntan dos personas con suenos comunes, mas o menos la misma educacion, las mismas creencias, criansas comunes es mejor el riesgo de compatibilidad. En este pais los taboos no son la edad. Ya no son los tiempos en que la mujer no estudiaba, no trabajaba, no manejaba dependia de el esposo para muchas cosas, entonces la mujer valia menos que el hombre. Por eso fue muy sufrida, pero gracias a dios que la mujer ya se da a valer. No veo por que si con la edad se adquire conocimiento y sabiduria por que en Mexico todavia piensan tan antiguo. Mi mama me contaba que hace muchos anos, las ninas nomas reglaban, y ya se podian casar. Entre mas chiquitas, no saben nada.|`|f241165f28c907313bf0932ec9620ee9aa	No mencionas cuantos anos te lleva.

8a5c36068462bfced7c2c96563cae45baa	Olha, basicamente todas as pessoas que trabalham com computador ficam muito tempo no computador. Mas alguns tipos de profissionais ficam mais do que os outros.

Como se pensa num novo design para a tampa de uma caneta, sem pensar na pequeninisse deste problema em relacao aos tantos outros grandes problemas do pas?     Mas por outro lado, pegando o exemplo da tampa da caneta novamente, se nao tem um indivduo que assume este problema, a sim  que o brasil nao "vai para frente" e os brasileros vao estar em 2012 escrevendo com a caneta (e a tampa da caneta!) dos anos 90...    s vezes acho que ainda vale a pena tentar e seguir certos ideais.

O pessoal do governo e os representantes dos produtores se reunem para chegar a um consenso sobre o pre?o justo.  Acontece que pela lei de mercado (oferta e procura), muitas vezes o pre?o oferecido  inferior ao pre?o que deveria ser pago.  Para evitar que os produtores tenham prejuzo, o governo compra a produ??o pelo pre?o justo mencionado acima. Estoca o produto para vend-lo depois. s vezes vende por menos do qu pagou. Isto se chama subsdio.  Muitos pases praticam o subsdio. Os campe?es s?o os EUA e a Comunidade Europia.  porisso que fica difcil competir com os produtos deles.

Llega la edad en que nos enamoramos y empieza el  por qu me gusta.... ?Por qu me habr aceptado? ?Por qu me entrego?.... ?Por qu me dej?..., Preguntas que muchas veces  no sabemos resolver.

4146ea6cb04edc91129ba8576fade339aa	Being in a relationship is hard.    For me, being in LOVE was easy. You have no questions. You know. You trust. You believe. It feels right. When we got married, it was so simple. "Will you?" " Yes. Of course."

This means you 100% understand each other's emotions and feelings.  You don't have to explain yourself too much, becase the other person just knows.  i believe we have many "soul mates" and that soul mate does not directly mean "person you should spend the rest of your life with."    A relationship doesn't last based on being soul mates.  Someone can understand your soul 100%, but the physical world we live in causes a lot of stress (financial, environmental, other people, etc.), and ultimately it is that stress that can end even the best of relationships and soul connections.  At the same time, if you have found someone who can truly respect, understand, care, and be honest with you 100%, then you are on your way to becoming soul mates - and with a solid enough of a foundation to get through the problems we experience throughout life.|`|e25239318abc91712b3c9bae29e927d9aa	Ask God|`|fca4a6c1d0535011f48dda9fa2b7091caa	there is no thing as a soulmate.  however if you connect and communicate and do not judge and listen with compassion and love you will have achieved being soulmates.      so do not look for a soulmate; be open to finding a soulmate.  if you catch my drift.

El primer medio de comunicacin que se conoci fue el JUGLAR: persona que pregonaba en plazas pblicas sucesos, que, a su juicio, eran de inters, que por dinero y ante el pueblo cantaba, bailaba, haca juegos y truhaneras; bien que por estipendio o ddivas recitaba o cantaba poesas de los trovadores.  EL PASQUIN: (Del it. Pasquino, nombre de una estatua en Roma, en la cual solan fijarse libelos o escritos satricos).    1. m. Escrito annimo que se fija en sitio pblico, con expresiones satricas contra el Gobierno o contra una persona particular o corporacin determinada.   Luego los avisos, aqullos de Reward o se busca; tambin los LBELOS: (Del lat. libellus, librillo, escrito breve).    1. m. Escrito en que se denigra o infama a alguien o algo.    2. m. ant. Libro peque?o.   ~ de repudio.    1. m. Instrumento o escritura con que el marido antiguamente repudiaba a la mujer y dirima el matrimonio.   ~ infamatorio.    1. m. libelo (escrito en que se denigra).   dar ~ de repudio a algo. http://www.rae.es/  Con la invencon de la imprenta se aditaron los primeros peridicos; en Mxico el primer peridico que se conoci se llam EL ILUSTRADOR NACIONAL, editado por Jos Mara Coss.  Los peridicos informaban de los hechos relevantes ocurridos en el entorno donde se editaban y posteriormente de ms all de sos lugares.  Con la invencin de la Radio, se extendi el espectro, por decirlo asi, de los medios de comunicacin.  Despus vino la televisin y ahora la internet.  Todos los medios de comunicacin, en principio,  desempe?aron una funcin social, la de informar o divertir. Los informadores eran empiricos y muy idealistas; pero lleg un momento en que el ofici se prostituy y se perdi la idea de slo informar  y desempe?ar una labor social, para pasar a ser tambin un negocio y por consecuencia, actualmente tienen voz en los medios de comunicacin slo los que pagan o bien si se trata de escndalos, nota roja, guerras, quienes ms pagan son los polticos y sus partidos. La empresas informativas defienden intereses o ideologas. La Jornada, de Mxico, es izquierdista, la plana poltica cuesta 120 mil pesotes; EL Reforma, tambin de Mexico plana 120 mil, , es derechista; La Prensa,Mxico algo asi como 80 mil; , es popular y tiende a ser oficialista; EL Universal, Mexico es oficialista y EL VALLE, Mxico es puro negocio, la plana cuesta 35 mil pesotes; un edicto: tres por 600  pesos.  La televisin, dicen, que diez segundos en horario triple A, de las 19.00 hasta las 21.00 llegan a costar hasta 60 mil pesos en Televisa. En radio se venden paquetes de, por ejemplo, 10 menciones, hasta en 30 mil pesos, todos los precios son negociables, mediante convenios publicitariosprincipalmente en radio y prensa escrita. Los anuncios comerciales son ms baratos hasta en un 70 por ciento con relacin a la publicidad poltica. Todos, sin embargo, tratan de taparle el  ojo al macho y dar una idea que son plurales, veraces y objetivos, pero en el fondo lo que cuenta es el dinero y los intereses.  Yo terminara asi, no se tu, la que pregunta, "jvenes, los medios de comunicacin pasaron de ser medios de informacin  y cumplir una funcin social a ser un negocio y defender intereses. Jvenes, todo lo que lean, escuchen o vean, sea entre lneas; porque los medios son manipuladores de la opinin pbblica. Son mercaderes del caos, del drama, la desgracia y lo malo; para que saquen algo bueno debe de ser pagado, por ejemplo la fiesta de cumplea?os de fulanita de tal". He dicho, VALE
