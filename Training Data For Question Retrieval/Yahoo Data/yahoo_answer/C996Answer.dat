c5d46e3c7eb9fa9356007718f6f2444caa	The HK416 is available as an upper assembly that can be mounted on any AR lower receiver.  So, get a CA legal lower and attach the HK upper.  I've included a link to a company that sells the uppers (they have one on gunbroker.com for $5500).  There may be others.  The HK416 receiver does not appear to be on the CA Assault Weapons list, therefore, you might be able to purchase a stripped receiver and make the necessary modifications to comply with California law.  Someone may also be selling HK416 (semi-auto version) as a CA legal conversion.<br>  <br>  You might want to check out Calguns.net for reliable information about buying and/or building California legal "assault rifles".|`|SPleGlS1aa	No such thing.

7BHIyMFmaa	He is overrated. He's been doing the same spots in literally every match he's been in for the last 10 years or so. His act is stale. IMO he's not World Champion material. Even after 15 years in the business his mic work hasn't improved. His brother is a better all around wrestler. Jeff Hardy is the definition of a one dimensional wrestler.|`|pbS2kVJcaa	yes Jeff hardy is overrated....in my opinion Matt has always had the talent when it comes to the brothers...Jeff relies on spots and he cant wrestle a normal match. like you said in a ladder or TLC match people think hes amazing just because he falls off ladders onto tables|`|25HCZmPZaa	Jeff is not overated , the wwe is just suing him right not liek wen he waz on raw , triple is very overrated and so is khali kane and taker for life|`|P3g2Gz2Yaa	nah triple  his <br>  <br>  EXCUSE ME!!!!!!!!!!

I always thought Jeff was an overrated spot monkey (just my opinion) and he never impressed me much. Evan Bourne is better in the ring and has alot more charisma than Jeff.
wZAl2zmEaa	don't stiffen your wrist, kinda let it roll/fling out of your fingers across the stitch, this is where the spiraling comes from, get as much power of the throw from the fingers/finger tips along the stitch which will make it more accurate (due to the spiraling), once you've got the technique you can work on how far you can throw it.|`|AA12170560	I almost understood this to mean to throw a football, something had to be done to your hand to make it spiral. And the answer is no.<br>  <br>  Most footballs have laces (the white line of stitching on one side) and two white stripes towards the ends.<br>  <br>  Hold the football with your thumb and index finger parallel to the white line (not the stitching) at the end.<br>  <br>  Your ring finger (and maybe even your middle finger) should touch the stitiching.<br>  <br>  As you hold the ball...your thumb and index finger should form the letter C - and there should be space between them and the ball...only fingertips make contact with the ball.<br>  <br>  You step into a throw with your opposite foot - toe pointing to your target.<br>  <br>  The ball starts up behind your ear - as you propel the ball forward<br>  (stepping with opposing foot aimed at target)<br>  ...you lead with your elbow ... ball held above your head...<br>  <br>  when you release the ball, your wrist flips downward to encourage the ball to spin...<br>  <br>  no surgical procedure<br>  just a little mechanical technique.|`|1bAFv3Yqaa	nice copy and paste for that answer
6a3172c489600c432a5b3ecd4bc4bb96aa	Dan Henderson is a two time Greco Roman Wrestling Olympian. You know how Randy Couture is world renown for using Greco Roman wrestling in MMA. Couture was an alternate to the Olympic Teams that Henderson made. So Henderson was a better Greco Roman Wrestler than Couture.<br>  <br>  He pretty much has used straight Wrestling and a big right hand to win his matches. In fact he has only submitted one person in his whole MMA career, so he really isn't much of a jiu-jitsu guy.|`|Vrd8gB61aa	he just hugged him on the ground and then hit him<br>  just like all the wrestlers|`|gBO908P6aa	That's Greco-Roman Wrestling, not Jiujitsu|`|nRBC4E5saa	Hendo knew nothing but straight Western wrestling (folkstyle and Greco-Roman, mostly) for the early part of his MMA career.  Even when he and the other Team Quest guys started mixing things in, boxing and other striking arts was the first thing to be added.  In the book "Title Shot", there is some discussion over weather Team Quest or Caesar Gracie's team had the better ground grappling, and Team Quest's style was described as "submission wrestling".<br>  <br>  In summary, no, I don't think it was BJJ.|`|NJMzhcKhaa	Dan Henderson is a top notch Wrestler. His first style will definitely be in Greco Roman Wrestling as listed in that video actually.<br>  <br>  He just control the opponent with his solid Wrestling base and ground and pound him.|`|AA11101806	Hendo started as a pure wrestler, and in large part that's what he still holds to today.|`|jUjBYi7Caa	He was a wrestler.
qVDY1hm5aa	I 100% agree with all of your questions. This one being no exception. I think Festus has decent in-ring skills but his poor gimmick is holding him back. They've already tried repackaging him as the 'moving house workers', where they'd come out with buublewrap and sellotape and embarres superstars like Kenny Dykstra and Ryan Braddock. This angle flopped and I think the only option left is to split these two up, turning Festus into a mental physcopath, thus giving Jesse a nice single's push in the midcard division. Festus has got the look. McMahon likes big superstars with the meancing size and the muscle mass so this could be Festus' first big break.|`|85ecad91da4761d50060ea7e04b61701aa	Its funny you mention that i was actually sitting down earlier and i was thinking what should the WWE do with those two insted of releasing them witch usually happens to all the great talents.....i personally dont think they should push Festus i think that they should push Jesse <br>  <br>  i thought somthing Like<br>  <br>  During a match of Festus's after festus completes his signiture move i say Jesse rings the bell to stop him from moving then Jumps in the ring and eyeballs Festus Chair in hand and full on assault Festus|`|hdp7bv45aa	I think that snap right at the bell and when the bell ring again he is relaxed again is stupid because if he's relaxed he can't defended himself and anyone can beat him up when he's relaxed I think he should snap when someone hit him or spit on him or somethig that way he has a better chance to defend himself|`|Hw4qQLNOaa	I got a list for Festus:<br>  1. Talk<br>  2. Turn Heel <br>  3. Get drafted to RAW<br>  4. Get a push.<br>  5. Sing. <br>  6. Party all night long.|`|25HCZmPZaa	i think the whole gimmick for him on smackdown is over unfortunatly he will be drafted probably to ecw and hava rivalryw ith mark henry|`|s4FIoGwmaa	He's gotta turn heel, snap when the bell rings is getting so old|`|qbEeecndaa	yes|`|1z7M3Tntaa	Yeah I'm getting tired of this gimmick as well there's only so much you can do with it. They should give him a more serious or  monster type gimmick he's got the talnet to make it big in the WWE. He had a great macth against Taker so that shows that he's got what it takes to mainevent if given a seious gimmick.|`|JiCfYfLraa	that gimmick is so lame and corny the wwe needs to stop it. festus is a decent wrestler i give him that but that gimmick has to go its holding him down.|`|bLhTwPqIaa	OK there is an easy way of getting rid of the whole Bell Ringing nonsence. All they need to do is put Jesse and Festus into another little feud like they were with Morrison and The Miz. Remember when they kept ringing the bell and mimicking him and would ring it again straight away to stop Festus doing anything. It was pretty funny. They need to do something like that again, but 1 step further actually hit him over the head with the ring bell. (remember this is WWE and anything can happen) what would then happen is tha the bell hitting him, cured him and now the bell is constantly ringing in his head so there is no need for him to to his Power Ranger Morphing time before each match. (For some reason it makes me think of Power Rangers) <br>  <br>  Now we have it a Human Festus who can now cut promo's, speak and start a fight when ever he wants.|`|NRs72Afxaa	I actually still like the Festus gimmick, but I do agree it is getting stale. <br>  <br>  My guess is put a Kane mask on him  to continue his feud with Kane lol.<br>  <br>  Maybe being a phyco path would help, but lets look at Sntisky when they tried it on him. It didn't work. The reason why it worked for Kane because the way he looked made it believable.|`|fdI0fOAwaa	Yes. he's a good wrestler and he should not waste his abilities by just staying like a retarded. I think he can kick Kozlov's ***.|`|P3g2Gz2Yaa	he sucks soo hate him tell him to go join  miley cyrus both red necks
S0u3HKzhaa	I found it interesting to see,how they learnt the moves and they were teach to the celebrities.I didn't mind it.I found it pretty interesting to watch.Although I was pretty impressed that the celebrities attempted to do what the did.If your looking for high end quality matches you would be looking to see in a wwe or tna main event.Then i would not recommend watching because it isn't that professional.They are just showed three moves each week by beefcake and Nasty and once Hulk Hogan,and once RVD and Goldberg.I liked it over all.<br>  <br>  WQ: loll sure.|`|7f2GSDmqaa	I saw a few episodes and didnt like it. The fans are just plants (not real wrestling fans) and the show looks like a mockery of pro wrestling|`|TgUCZzyIaa	Ya its a good show...It will be very intresting to see such a match of the legend.....<br>  I dont like ur avatar bcoze of 2 reasons.....<br>  1.It is not clear and the picture doesnt fix the exact alloted size..<br>  2.I dont like Vicky....|`|lzbxT6p9aa	I have seen one episode. It's an OK show, Nothing spectacular. Although Dustin Diamond (Screech in Saved By the Bell) getting his a$$ kicked by Dennis Rodman was quite funny.

u3FqxhY8aa	If Nadal is out of the French Open then I think Djokovic could win that one, only because I believe that Novak is a better clay court player than Roger is (although all I am really basing this on is the scores against Rafa in their clay court meetings where Djoko faired a bit better).  Wimbledon is Rafa/Roger's and no one is going to be taking that one away, although he could make it back to the semis or quarters to make up for his second round loss last year.  US open is where he stands the greatest chance, but all 4 of the top players have their eyes on it.  Murray will be trying very hard to defend his points in the finals and win his first slam.  Rafa will be going to complete the golden slam, and Roger will be aiming for his sixth US open title.  I am not sure that he will win one this year, but I do think now that he has won a slam he will definitely be a contender for most of the slams for the next few years.  If he dedicates himself to his fitness I could see him winning more slams and doing really well like Navratilova did after getting super fit since his game is so aggressive.  For the rest of the slams it depends on how he is, if he can get all of the way back to his old amazing self he certainly stands a chance, and if Roger or Rafa slip up in the slams then Novak will certainly be able to be there to pick it up.|`|75ZMWlnnaa	sorry, i do not see it happening.<br>  <br>  french open is rafa's.<br>  wimbledon will be either roger or rafa.<br>  <br>  i think maybe at us open, if he can play rafa in SF, then djoker has given rafa alot of trouble on HC before, i dont see why he can not upset rafa since rafa struggles at NY. provided djoker plays the match of his life against roger or murray in the final, then i think he can win it.|`|U7BkuEU9aa	No, not really. If anyone other than Rafa and Fed are gonna win anything, it will be Murray, though I don't see that happening either.|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	no|`|1w5blbobaa	Okkk I don't know how many ppl will agree wth me bt I hv a feeling that Djokovic might win WIMBLEDON this year becoz Everyone will be expecting Rafa/Roger 2 be the winner or may be Murry will also be the favorite.<br>  <br>  Bt I don't know why bt Im having an Intuition that may be the Djoker surprise us all by winning the title.|`|6KOEbjjJaa	Well if he return to his form maybe it will be the us open as Roland garros i do not think there is anyone could take it from rafa and wimbledon will be for roger or rafa and murray may compete for the title this year|`|BRTa5h7iaa	Not anymore. His biggest chance was at the Aussie Open. He doesn't stand a chance at the French or Wimbledon and the US Open will have Federer, Murray, and Nadal.|`|NxQN1RkEaa	NO ! 2008 was his best year & it's down hill from now on for him. He does not have " the great champ " in him as Federer, Nadal, Agassi, Pete, etc..|`|xLyNsywiaa	Nope, AO was really his only chance...<br>  <br>  Wimbledon...I think Fed might take this back but I hope Nadal wins it<br>  French Open...If fit Nadal<br>  US Open...Fed|`|aTBs7pJ4aa	more then likely not..... there is murray, giles simon and Verdasco who i might put before him this time around.. and with nadal the way he is playing.. goodluck|`|F0q3gi5Gaa	Us open,,,|`|sptrtwxlaa	yess-french or us|`|sywoTNKgaa	It's hard to predict. On paper it looks like it will be difficult for anyone not named Nadal to win a slam this year, but there's much more tennis to be played and a lot can happen between slams.<br>  <br>  Djokovic's been to the semis or better at all 4 slams so he's definitely a contender for all of them.<br>  <br>  His best shot for a second slam title would be at the US Open where he made the final in '07. <br>  <br>  Followed by the French Open where he's never lost to anyone except Nadal.<br>  <br>  Then Wimbledon|`|qnbImhmbaa	No, but he'll probably win the Forfeit Slam (retire from all 4 majors in a calendar year).  Whether it's a health problem or a pride problem, a forfeit is still a forfeit.|`|AA12034105	Nah I don't see him winning one this year :)<br>  They're all Rafa's haha ;)|`|VefSnu0Gaa	no, he has the biggest chances at the us open but i don't think he's gonna win it.-|`|GNq2rmrNaa	No|`|wx2UfKOdaa	he has a shot at us open... nothing else|`|NP5IX3CQaa	no|`|eEXz9KG6aa	hell no|`|f1UYyl3Qaa	nope, if anyones going to win a grandslam besides nadal or federer, its gonna be murray.|`|RC3WoqFkaa	no
lzbxT6p9aa	Match 1. <br>  <br>  Kennedy Hits the Kenton bomb on Morrison but then Benoit scrambles across the ring and puts Kennedy in the Crippler and makes him tap.  WINNER = Chris Benoit<br>  <br>  Match 2. <br>  <br>  Lita distracts Kane on the outside of the ring allowing the Hardyz to take advantage. They use their standard double team moves and Matt hits the Twist Of Fate near the corner, Jeff climbs the turnbuckle and signals for the Swanton but Kane pulls his legs away and he crotches on the top turnbuckle. Taker does the last ride on Matt and Kane slides back in the ring, chokeslams Jeff and gets the 3-count WINNERS - TAKER & KANE<br>  <br>  Match 3. <br>  <br>  Edge is winding up for a spear on Orton when BANG! RKO from nowhere. Orton then covers but forces the kick out after 2, he winds up and punts edge, then gets the pinfall. WINNER - ORTON<br>  <br>  Match 4. <br>  <br>  Trish Stratus gets the win after the Stratusphere on Mickie. Boring match. <br>  <br>  Match 5. <br>  <br>  Excellent Match, The Rock is the heel and he works the crowd as well as he always did. They trade blows and power moves back and forth until Stone Cold hits a huge Stunner which the Rock sells perfectly. He kicks out after 2 and hits the Rock Bottom which also gets a near fall from Austin. Both men get back on their feet and it looks like The Rock is going to hit another Rock Bottom but Austin counters with the setup kick. As he's turning round for the 2nd Stunner, The Rock counters and hits the Rock Bottom after all. He then does the People's Elbow and gets the win. WINNER - THE ROCK.|`|85ecad91da4761d50060ea7e04b61701aa	First of all i know evryone has there own opinion but i can see a few people picking the other two over the Rabid wolverine in the words of Hurricaine Helms :Whats up with that???<br>  <br>  now ill answer<br>  <br>  1.Benoit Submision over Kennedy<br>  2.Kane & Taker> Taker Pinfall over Matt<br>  3.Edge Unfair advantage pinfall over Orton<br>  4.Trish Stratus Pinfall over Lita<br>  5.Rock Pinfall over Austin|`|Vbrn4GQNaa	dude its up to the makers of wresting if u didnt kno already the shows all fake punching and violence and blood obnly lik 10 percent of the things u see are real or those people would be dead by now so whoever wresting wants to win will win|`|lVpmV4gAaa	mr.kennedy<br>  the undertaker<br>  randy orton<br>  mickie james<br>  stone cold|`|yb67y0AWaa	idk john morrison<br>  the hardy wit lita <br>  edge<br>  lita<br>  stone cold|`|qbEeecndaa	kennedy<br>  taker and kane<br>  edge<br>  mickie<br>  stone cold|`|25HCZmPZaa	ok this r sum really random matches but ok<br>  morrison<br>  bod<br>  edge<br>  trish<br>  rock|`|JiCfYfLraa	chris beniot<br>  undertaker and kane<br>  lita(of course she will own those whores)<br>  stone cold|`|P3g2Gz2Yaa	uhmm wtf !<br>  <br>  john<br>  hardy<br>  orton<br>  lita<br>  stone|`|YwEFJWR7aa	Chris Benoit<br>  Undertaker and Kane[most dominant tag team in wwe<br>  Randy Orton<br>  Trish Stratus<br>  Stone Cold|`|X9xWZdgSaa	Chris Benoit<br>  Brothers of Destruction<br>  Randy Orton<br>  Mickie James<br>  Stone Cold|`|PYKlBVmAaa	Chris Benoit<br>  The Undertaker n Kane hands down<br>  Randy<br>  Lita hands down<br>  Stone Cold he is the best!|`|1YrHkxKvaa	Chris Benoit<br>  The Brothers of Destruction<br>  thats a toss up but i'll give it to Edge<br>  Trish Stratus<br>  Stone Cold

4c479c9c27bebd404d7ba657763fe54faa	Yes, it will be celebriting its 10th year in August. 1st Smackdown episode was on 26th August 1999|`|Bhy4k9wPaa	In theory yes but it doesn't seem like they celebrate the anniversaries quite right. I imagine with WM25 being this year (big one, to be honest) they'll leave it either until next year or until the very end of this year.|`|J2h9ef72aa	I think so. Coz smackdwon did start in 1999.|`|s4FIoGwmaa	Smackdown started in 1999 so yes you are right|`|TgUCZzyIaa	s u r rite........
WSZVJRIwaa	Still playing, then Ryan Giggs without a doubt. Come next season, will be the only footballer to have played in every season of the English Premier League's existance.|`|0uvcUV8Zaa	Craig Bellamy.|`|VMXl7Up1aa	Ryan Giggs.<br>  Bellamy isn't good enough to tie his laces
QJlPNgZBaa	i think it's <br>  india , sri lanka, australia, south africa in semi finals.<br>  <br>  but india is the huge favourite.|`|rjWRMDYUaa	according to your prediction,may be bangladesh has also good chances....<br>  come on !!<br>  plz listen this song......<br>  we are the champions......(i used to listen this song during my exams to boost my moral )may be you also need this.......<br>   undoubtedly,INDIA will win........|`|XVYRUzkEaa	India will win the World T20 Championship because they are the defending T20 Champions...|`|dJcPxDBUaa	INDIA!!!!! <3 <3|`|bBMKMd97aa	i would have to go new zealand they are getting better they nearly bet australia but i say there the underdogs this year.|`|AA11088802	india|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	SA|`|GoepUF9gaa	only one voice "india"|`|b2qV9K5Gaa	SA will trash india in the finals|`|JyYAArPNaa	pakistan for sure... india was lucky last time.........|`|403a76a591bc07b10b1a689c061b508daa	Windies will surprise the others. remember i told you so.
CgTwW7H2aa	Ford pulled its support of the truck series teams. Dodge pulled their support last year so the truck series will be only Chevys and Toyotas. Eric Darnell, the driver, is now in the Nationwide series and will drive the # 6 car when David Ragan does not drive it.|`|Nkwv2hygaa	Darnell moved up to the Nationwide Series. Roush decided to cut back the Truck Series business.|`|GCOrku95aa	If Ford pulled it's support, why was Colin Braun racing on Friday night? Wouldn't he have had to move out, or up, as well? But yeah, Erik has graduated from trucks into a part-time Nationwide schedule, driving the #6 Northern Tools and Equipment Ford, when David Ragan is not driving the #6 Discount Tire Ford
eTAiP7OPaa	Cavs vs Lakers.. I favor for the Cavs but I think Lakers will win it =)|`|hZjZZf5vaa	Lakers vs Cavaliers<br>  The Cavaliers will take it|`|Vr4r5l8Raa	where kwame brown happens!|`|21J0IIZbaa	Lakers over the Cavs in 5|`|vzH7f7V5aa	The Cavs Easily.|`|NWXBqftkaa	I think Lakers will end up taking the title. They are just too talented. Lakers might end up playing the Cavs if KG's knee injury from last night is serious. I say this because I don't expect the Cavs to lose too many games and if KG misses games there could go home court in the Eastern Finals which is huge with these two teams. I think whoever has home court between them meets Lakers in the finals.|`|W6jjsiMxaa	Lakers|`|5FypDafWaa	Cavs, the celtics do not have it this year.|`|VIHw7kRkaa	CELTICS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  BEAT LA!!!!!!!
eTAiP7OPaa	Which name is better? DARKO!!!<br>  <br>  Who will be more competitive after 5 years? MARC GASOL!!!|`|21J0IIZbaa	Gasol is better now and will be in the future.|`|vzH7f7V5aa	Darko Milicic.|`|W6jjsiMxaa	Gasol|`|5FypDafWaa	Marc Gasol|`|A71U6gNtaa	Marc Gasol|`|4DcvpQXfaa	Marc<br>  <br>  Marc all ready a good young center,Darko is a bust
eTAiP7OPaa	RUSSEL WESTBROOK! =)|`|NWXBqftkaa	Not Joe Alexander. Russel Westbrook definitely has some live legs. Good hops. He would be an interesting entry.<br>  <br>  Rudy's dunk that Pau assisted with was really nice. If he would have done it within two or three tries it would have been an easy 50.|`|W6jjsiMxaa	Alexander|`|21J0IIZbaa	I wanted to see Alexander in the dunk contest.<br>  <br>  Rudy should of received a higher score on both of his dunks.  The finals should of been Rudy vs. Dwight.  The judge wanted Robinson Vs. Howard.  Nate's first two dunks were weak.  Dunk #1 was the same that Smith performed only with one bounce but received a higher score.  Dunk #2 was one of the worst in dunk contest history.  Chandler should of made a pass from that position.  Robinson last two dunks was great and based on the dunks in the finals, he deserved to won.|`|vFbzBo4eaa	Russel Westbrook|`|vzH7f7V5aa	Joe Alexander.|`|5FypDafWaa	Russel|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	Westbrook by far. But don't worry, he will get his chances over the next few years. That kid has got some hops.|`|4DcvpQXfaa	Russell Wesbrook
eTAiP7OPaa	LAL. They're GREAT + They'll bounce back from their loss. That's for sure! =)|`|NWXBqftkaa	Lakers. CP3 won't be able to run around against the Lakers like he did against the Magic on Wednesday. If Chandler is still out, that means Hilton Armstrong will be guarding Pau or Lamar right? That's beyond laughable.|`|QuLapuE7aa	I think the Lakers will win this one, first because Pau and Lamar have been playing really well, It's also on our homecourt. Hornets play us better at staples but Lakers have been playing well for the past few games.|`|iJ9rbpTFaa	LAL...it's their home court and they've been dominant in the past few games.... well in the other hand Chris paul had a clinic versus the Orlando Magic but still I bet LAL (even if andrew is gone)|`|W6jjsiMxaa	LAL!|`|XNsVqm3Daa	LAL.. Just a better team|`|5FypDafWaa	Lakers-they are at home.|`|21J0IIZbaa	Lakers 102-94|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	Lakers all the way. NOH is still going to be reeling a bit from that botched trade and the Lakes are really starting to roll.|`|Njom1Wbtaa	I've this feeling that Chris Paul will give them trouble again, and I've this presentiment that Chandler is going to prove himself. I will go with the New Orleans Hornets, they've the momentum and the last time they played at each other, New Orleans defeated the Los Angeles Lakers with Andrew Bynum on the floor. I know David West and Chris Paul have a big night, but it was the defense of the Lakers that gave a taste of their own medicine.|`|U7BkuEU9aa	Lakers. If they play focused the entire match, they don't lose to anyone.|`|vzH7f7V5aa	NOH.|`|3jBUJxOdaa	LAL..better team plus its their homecourt
AA12170560	No - it's a conflict of interest if he was acting as a referee in the game.<br>  <br>  I will address this as if he wore the black and white stripes.<br>  If he was not a participating referee, then he was a spectator and there's no recourse.<br>  <br>  A complaint can be raised through the Officiating forum.<br>  <br>  The best thing would have been for his fellow officials to address his commentary immediately.<br>  <br>  His behavior was unprofessional.<br>  <br>  So the officiating committee could censor him...<br>  or...<br>  <br>  A more powerful statement would be coaches forfeiting games he officiated - in protest.<br>  - which is unlikely....<br>  <br>  OR public protest and outcry from parents...<br>  <br>  Nothing worse than referee's that have no sense of ethics...|`|jwm0kQvNaa	like what the above said...<br>  <br>  But what I would like to know is, why in Spanish?  As many spanish-speaking people are in this country now, wouldn't you think the ref wouldn't realize that at least ONE of the parents from the opposing team could speak/understand it?  What a moron...<br>  <br>  I'd get him fired.  You bet it's a conflict of interest- regardless of school/city size.

AA12170560	I think it's out of proportion and ... sorry Bevo...incredibly racist.<br>  <br>  I think there are pros and cons to being franchised...the cons, for Hill  in this case, may be a sense of feeling "owned", or powerless to negotiate of his own will, or maybe a sense of being "limited" to some extent.<br>  <br>  I'm a HUGE proponent of a salary cap: "show me the money" needs to have a limit in the entertainment industry known as Professional Sports.|`|jwm0kQvNaa	Yeah, it's gotta suck being paid the average of the top 5 salaries at your position...<br>  <br>  Most NFL players need to remember that they are there because they were given the privilege to play.  They might have worked hard, did things right, but it's still an honor to play- not a birth right.  They should be happy that football got them through high school, college, and on to a very well paid job.  I know I would drop my job in a heartbeat to play football... for the league minimum at that. <br>  <br>  There are a lot of footballers that think they are union vs. owners, but they are all alike.  The top players control their destinies, while the "average" NFLer is the one being jerked around.  The part that amazes me is how a top player feels slighted at a "ridiculous" contract (say, 6 years, $30 mill with $10 mill guaranteed), while Joe Shmoe the long-snapper makes $250,000... with none of it guaranteed.  The Top Player would only get cut (and keep all the millions in guaranteed $$$) in the last year or two of the huge contract, when his salary cap number is too high.  The Schmoe could get cut at anytime, even over one bad snap, while never seeing another dime.  <br>  <br>  The top players, especially the Franchised ones, need to realize how good they have it.  Over other NFLers, and especially over guys and gals like us.|`|0fQk2spXaa	The franchise tag was a concession the union made in order to get free agency.  Prior to free agency, basically everyone had a franchise tag, because it was next to impossible for a player to seek higher pay from another team.<br>  The player's union was willing to strike over this issue.  The owners agreed to loosen up the free agency rules, but did not want to lose their star players, so the union agreed to allow one player a year be designated as a franchise player.<br>  The players who are given the franchise tag don't like it, but it's better for the players as a group.<br>  <br>  As for the black & white issue, that's just plain stupid.  To pick one white player and say he's not complaining like "all the blacks" is ridiculous.  Cassel isn't complaining because he knows that he will make more with the franchise tag than he would on the open market as a free agent.|`|Zfbe0rYraa	i think that person is blowing it a bit out of proportion.<br>  <br>  in Cassel's case he's essentially getting paid $15 mil (correct me if im wrong on that number) to sit on the bench.  if i was him i wouldn't be complaining either|`|c755a7ce9c9e50f79ac4b65b75c2db62aa	i would definitely complain about being paid millions of dollars to do something i love to do. thats just outrageous!|`|Q8Rx0QZeaa	The major problem with the franchise tag is that yes they make the money but what if the franchise player tears his acl or mcl or both(God Forbid) during that season. that means when he is trying to recover his stock is falling so the next year he doesn't get franchised and he doesn't get the long term deal. People always talk about how these players should be loyal to their teams and happy to make the money but as soon as they get hurt and have less value for 1 year they are dropped quick fast and in a hurry.<br>  <br>  And i don't care if the man is black some many people make so many problems black and white. Of course Matt Cassel won't complain the man hasn't played since high school and he had 1 good year so he won't complain for 15 million to ride the bench. These other players want to make sure they have job security and long term contracts are the way. Most of the players you mentioned are players worth getting a long term contract and are also players who have done great things for their franchise.|`|gcb61vLIaa	Well the texans CB said he was betrayed. Peppers is mad also. The Rams did O.J. Atogwe i'm surprised he hasn't started yet. But Shane Lecher complained before it was put on him.|`|1bAFv3Yqaa	unfortunetly, or fotunetly, depending how you look at it, it's the free market|`|VIHw7kRkaa	This is def true!!!  Perfect example is just like he said Cassel.  Brady started off the same way Cassel is starting right now!  He has great potential and will take whatever comes his way......because he is greatful.  Those other "people" (black players) are just not grateful for anything they get.  They are all money hungry and think they the world own them something!!  Its crazy!!!  I cant say all of them.....but most!!  And its pretty sad when you have black announcers agreeing with this as well!  I really think that what Cassel did for the team was amazing (not just because Im a Patriots fan), these were his first games right out of school, and he played like a pro!!!

xfpJGBfwaa	Have you been practicing with semi-contact?  Don't get yourself disqualified or with points off for being too rough.  And watch your blocking.  Most people practice no contact, so they also don't know what semi-contact is, so they may hit you harder than you expect because they want the point.  Also to make the point in semi-contact, you have to touch, but not hurt.  If you're not used to it, it will not be good to try to learn it "in the ring." Ask for an extra class with semi-contact in the school before the tournament.  <br>  <br>  Most serious athletes practice a process called tapering before a competition. That means LESS intense exercise to build up the glycogen reserves in the muscles, for better endurance, and more carbs in the diet, especially in the two hours right after an exercise session.  Visualizing previous matches also helps train your brain to respond automatically without reducing glycogen reserves.  <br>  <br>  And about the mental game.  Visualize winning, every time.  Some people become very egotistical about this, but it's not necessary.  It's about winning, not making the other person lose.  Think about this and talk yourself into confidence.  Try to obtain the attitude that you're teaching a student how to win.  Imagine you're an expert on it already.  What would you be like?  How would you feel?  When you imagine yourself as a teacher, you automatically train yourself to do it right.  <br>  <br>  Your plan has merit (to take the fight to the ground quickly), but it's a very common idea.  Probably the opponent is thinking the same thing.  Best to not prejudge and just be confident that whatever happens, you can handle it.  I've seen lots of people think this and then when they close the distance, the opponent finds an opportunity to score. Practice moving away without moving out of the "ring."  It will confuse your opponent, and make them move in on you, then you will have the opportunity to score, not them.|`|ve4LsVszaa	He is there with the firstest with the mostest will be the victor.  The advice that I like to give people in these situations is to always use combination of striking techniques, be the one to initiate the throws so that you have a better chance of landing on the top, and when you do all of that, take them down and just stay in control. <br>  <br>  However, if you are significantly smaller than your opponent, I would recommend that you practice throwing 1-2 techniques and then circle away.

I'm italian and  International of Milan's support.

I don't like to talk before matches, the field will speak!<br>  However, I think that in defense will play Samuel and Chivu, and the very young and excellent Santon instead of Maxwell! Maicon, Ibrahimovic, Cambiasso and Stankovic are the most important players of the team. Mourinho knows very well the United and has already beaten several times ... especially in the Champions League! You are careful too not to underestimate the enemy, we are the champions of Italy!|`|31dXpgzEaa	Hi, the majority of Uniteds team are home grown talent regardless of nationality.

AA12034449	soft steel is used at times...(com block ammo is flush with steel cased products)<br>  <br>  Steel rusts so you have to paint it or coat it... the coatings leave residue in firearms that can cause a stoppage.<br>  <br>  Brass is the A choice for casings. No Rust, it has no issues for reactivity, wont spark, expands to seal chambers... and in many cases can be reloaded and used over again.|`|AA11694178	Brass has a natural lubricity that makes easier to extract after firing.  It also can easily be resized for reloading.  Steel offers neither of these properties.  It cannot be reloaded so is good for only one single use.  Brass has simply shown, by virtue of its metallic characteristics,  to be the best choice for manufacturing cartridges.|`|f3f63c87e27f64c3e9f1679c165409b8aa	Basically all the others are right, except Skeptical who never answered your question.  Just thru out an insult....what was that you said about growing up?...hmmmmm<br>  Also Skeptical...take a look at modern day guns (pistols and rifles), holsters, knives, even bullet, packaging and boxes for the above.  You don't think looks play a role in  design?  Aesthetics and whether something is pleasing to the eye ALWAYS plays a role in marketing.  <br>  To answer the question though, it allows the shell expansion to seal the chamber, it's lighter, and also much easier and prolongs the life of the extractor.|`|mOTCr8Pxaa	Expansion and more resistant to rust. Besides, steel cased ammo is made in East Eur..abia in all kinds of calibers but many people complain about it not being able to expand or that the steel wears out the extractor faster (not true), then they go and buy some.|`|mFa5ZDtcaa	Brass is more easily worked.<br>  <br>  Steel is needed for tanks rifles helmets, planes trucks.<br>  <br>  Brass is crappy at stopping bullets or making engines.<br>  <br>  Brass doesn't rust. You don't have to worry too much about keeping your ammo dry.|`|btVNM1Djaa	another reason is steel is much more expensive then brass (about 5 times the cost).|`|ca6144d7933bfd99d11441a498f7e603aa	Steel is fine if you plan on using it now and never again. If you wish to store it, it needs to be rust-proofed. If you plan on reloading it, you won't wear out a set of dies working brass.<br>  For even more ease, make the cases out of a plastic that vaporizes on ignition, then you wouldn't have to worry about picking up the empties.|`|AA11640949	Some rifles it's not good to use steel casing.  In some semi auto's it can break the internal works that feed and eject the casings.  Well, it would be slow and overtime, not an instantaneous thing.|`|05f0ed7a9964bfcd8e3e5fe172f1cf21aa	a shell casing needs to expand and seal the chamber of a gun when fired,also allowing the bullet to be released from the shell case.<br>  brass will do this quite well.steel will not.
LloD26R9aa	I would love to think so but I'm not so sure. Home advantage should just enough to avoid the wooden spoon. But Italy have beaten us 4 times in the past.

I have cano and I'm trying to trade him.|`|0PXa5NP0aa	Cano had a down year last year, while Kinsler was red-hot before his injury.

I'd prefer Kinsler.|`|g5FE0Y62aa	lol rediculous trade. i am a yankees fan and i am telling you: keep kinsler, he is a low 1st round- 2nd round pick. Cano is outa the first 5 rounds.

nwMBfgcdaa	I don't know about the cross trainer.  If you are looking for something else to do, my running coach "ran" in the pool through her whole pregnancy.  Just get a floatation belt.  Its alot let impact, still a great cardio workout.|`|1UID5JtNaa	Moderate exercise should be encouraged during pregnancy unless your physician says otherwise.  15 minutes is not bad, but you should build up to doing it 2x daily.   By the way, if balance is an issue on the cross trainer, you would be better off walking.|`|pkfZXcPCaa	I would check with your doctor first.  However, the general rule I have always heard is you can exercise but you should keep your heart rate below 140bpm
qThmcR1Aaa	No. You can dropkick a free kick if you want to, but if it goes above the crossbar, it won't count for anything.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_kick_(rugby_union)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_kick_(...</a>|`|BgKueDyMaa	What this guy on about with the 10 phases crap ? Thats bullshit. Yes you can, Not directly, Tap the ball and then take one. You cant take it straight up.|`|r2WbxKkCaa	The opposition has to have touched the ball before it can go over for a drop goal so the only time it could occur directly would be if a charge down was attempted and the ball grazed the hand of the opposition and then the ball went over the cross bar.  It could be 10 phases without a stop in play and the attacking team can still not kick a field goal until the ball is touched by the other team.|`|Q7GDRa2Faa	Not directly.  The usual method is a quick tap, pass to your pre-positioned kicker, who is then free to attempt a field goal.  It must be done quickly: the opposition probably have already targeted your kicker, and will rush him as soon as the tap-free is taken.  ...Stop Press!  Make that "...quick tap, pass, form a maul, feed to kicker..."  (I've just checked the Wiki reference.)|`|HTiczN3Xaa	LMAO @ "leroy's" answer. Dude, you have absolutely NO IDEA, do you?<br>  <br>  Drop goal can't be taken directly from a free kick, ball needs to be tapped before taking the kick.|`|RmmO10xSaa	I'm not sure if you can do attempt one straight from the free kick i doubt it , but tap it first and pass backward to the kicker.

uK3erCEOaa	nope...too inconsistent...Spud and Mugsy proved height doesn't matter...|`|vzH7f7V5aa	Pretty amazing.|`|Njom1Wbtaa	From the immortal words of one shoe company, "Just do it!"|`|5FypDafWaa	He is amazing for his size.
Pq5Ds8F2aa	He will get a standing "O", it's not Montreal.|`|RJ5Bevmpaa	Snore. Sundin's nothing special, in his entire tenure with the Leafs he never broke into the 90 point range, yet they're turned this guy into the greatest player on the history of the planet while Jagr, & Hossa for example were both free agents this past summer as well.<br>  <br>  Mats is a greedy dink that screwed over several teams selfishly and ultimately went for the money. He doesn't want to win, he doesn't even want to be in the playoffs and miss his summer vacation. He's basically the poster boy for anything and everything that's wrong with hockey players in the NHL. Give him a Yashin jersey and I'll move on the real players with real heart like Iginla or Shanahan.|`|dhs9QBMoaa	He'll be cheered more than anything.  He hurt the team by leaving the way he did and tarnished his reputation, but there's no denying his accomplishments as a member of the "Blue and White".<br>  I wonder if he's going to be as difficult for the Canucks if they fall out of contention and want to trade him.|`|zbCh3Lxpaa	<a href="http://sports12.weebly.com" rel="nofollow">http://sports12.weebly.com</a><br>  <br>  this website has every game playing in NHL all the time and is pretty well updated. Click on the google ads to help support this website as well.|`|Pc0QjrQ4aa	Complete and utter indifference.  Sundin was a nice enough player (point-per game guy, good on draws, solid 30-goal scorer), but he's not a Clark, a Gilmour, etc.  Doesn't mean he's a bad hockey player.  I'm not going to boo him, but if he's looking for flowers and a heart-shaped box of chocolates...he's a week late.<br>  <br>  He left on his free will, which was his choosing.  He owed the club nothing, but in turn, the club owes him nothing.|`|viIC9hUfaa	is he coming back to leafs on saturday or something?

4uSRVZNNaa	david wright.  legit 5 tool player.  who is taking papi w/ the second pick?  thats just foolish.   he shouldn't even be taken in the second round!|`|G0qBlKI1aa	I would go Pujols to be safe, but ARod might be the steal of many drafts this year.  I doubt he could be suspended, unless they get more recent tests showing him using illegal substances.|`|jYqqZJx5aa	Definitely Albert Pujols or A-Rod. It's pretty much a coin flip between the two, I think A-Rod has the bigger potential for home runs and stolen bases, possibly runs, but Pujols will most likely deliver a better average.<br>  <br>  Lol. Who drafts David Ortiz second overall?|`|dHc2lN39aa	Big Al.|`|EQbVhdnIaa	Pujols! He's the best player period.
WhlwZeiXaa	SANTANA MOSS<br>  it always has been but the redskins gameplan is basically give the ball to portis, whereas the cowboys and giants pass more.|`|i0QzvbSnaa	that RootZoo dude is so caught up in phishing that he lost track of which Moss is where. I might actually say DeSean Jackson is the most talented and will be the best as much as I do not like Philly, but Santana is the best until someone outdoes him or the Giants bring someone better in.|`|MqyoCDrFaa	I'd have to still go with Randy Moss.

I think DeSean Jackson will be the best receiver in the division by season's end.|`|jpMP5p9haa	I want to say Sinorice Moss, or Hixon, because I'm a Giants fan, (and it used to be Plax) so I'm not really 100% sure. I haven't really seen Santana Moss in that many games, but the ones I have, he was really good.|`|yxSvQRlsaa	Roy Williams baby!<br>  <br>  GO COWBOYS! (fan since 92')|`|melbPDVSaa	Randy Moss|`|Vyz5YnZqaa	Roy Williams, Santana Moss has lost a step and the rest of the teams #1 receivers would be #2's on the Cowboys.|`|wxXguyK3aa	Yep, I think Santana, too.  Who knows, though, the Giants might land a really good one in the draft or by trading.
f8e31ab02d07afacdaeceb0a629ba9bdaa	It took me about 8 years and watching a lot of basketball to develop a "go to" move.  My suggestion is watch some basketball games, whatever level and street ball, a little of all of em.  Then depending on your advantage create your own move.  If quick, find a crossover you can master that no one can stop or steal.  If your strong, try a back down, post moves and muscle your defender.  If strong AND quick then you can be lethal.  Try a back down first, then you can go to a quick spin, mostly baseline but depending on the defense.  The reason this will work is the defender will start to try to muscle you back, taking away some balance then you're gone.  For post moves, a good one to watch is Hakeem Olajuwon if you can find video.  If you cannot find a move that works for you, I would suggest working on your jumpshot and becoming an unstoppable, deadly shooter, because a lot of people can get a signature move but every team could use a pure shooter. Good luck on whatever you discover though|`|AA11464004	my favorite is the crossover. the way i learned it is to look at their feet. first, look at which foot is farther out. fake to that side and go to the other side all the way.<br>  <br>                                              OH YEAH!!!|`|AtxXjtJbaa	a go to move is differnt for everyone.  It all depends on your strength, size and skill.  As for a kobe fade away, its harder because as you need a good vertical leap and enough strength to shoot the ball using just your arms and shoulders because jumping away eliminates having your legs for the jump shot.|`|l3eLsUTPaa	My personal favorite move is a back down and then quick fadeaway. Its unpredictable, hard to block. Watch Kobe, he does it to perfection.
35npAVIBaa	Apuesto a que esta no la habían escuchado. El forhand (golpe de derecho o drive) que posee, su estilo, le exige que tenga un brazo fuerte (observa su terminación por detrás de la cabeza y no adelante del cuerpo). Es decir, se ha medido tecnológicamente las vueltas o revoluciones de la bola cuando golpea y se han contado 4000 a 5000 vueltas, cuando el promedio de los otros jugadores es de 2500.<br>  <br>  Decían que Murray comentó que su golpe lo lanzaba hacia atrás (no precisamente por la fuerza sino el rebote de la bola, demasiado topspin)|`|SftW6N8zaa	por que nacio deforme aparte de que con un brazo es mas habil que con el otro|`|gyjnryfGaa	por que está deforme.|`|lcF0F257aa	Porque en el tenis el brazo habil,con el que usa para darle con el drive,reves, siempre se desarrolla mas  que el otro,por eso se nota la diferencia<br>  <br>  <br>  salu2|`|1tjGS7Ouaa	supongo que será porque lo somete a un entrenamiento mayor para pegar esos drives que no para nadie!|`|9LEXhZ7daa	eso es mentira nunca lo he oido lo estas flipando esque akaso te la dicho el en persona ? pues no creo (no juzgues a alguien si no te la dicho en persona)|`|JMBkA6zYaa	por que los tenistas tienen lo que llaman el brazo habli con el que sirven los drives en el caso de nadal es un jugador de mucha potencia por consiguiente el brazo habil es sometido a mas trabajo que el otro y esto ocasiona una diferencia en la masa muscular <br>  <br>  aloha|`|OHZxLt6Faa	No es que tenga un brazo mas grande que el otro, lo que pasa es que se desarrolla mas el musculo del brazo que se utiliza, se nota mas en Rafael porque no tiene mangas la ropa que utiliza|`|OtnrMtCAaa	no me había fijado...pero leyendo a mis compa?eros será el izquierdo que es con el que saca y consigue sus mejores golpes.|`|aUuqd3hZaa	porque el zurdo lo tiene mas desarrollado que el otro porque con esa mano agarra la raqueta y se le re nota y si vos te fijas en los jugadores va a ver que con el brazo que agarran la raqueta lo tiene mas grande.<br>  <br>  salu2|`|bAUp514Iaa	Porque tiene mas fuerza en el izquierdo q en el derecho<br>  <br>  Salu2???|`|qKaJCKIKaa	jaja la diferencia entre un brazo y otro es muy grande al ver que el brazon izquierdo tiene mucho fisico vemos al derecho todo flacucho. El brazo izq es mas grando por q es su mano habil y es la que usa para pegar los drive y el saque en el juego.|`|BrwxHeGdaa	porque el izquierdo es el brazo con el que juega al tenis.Pero tambien es verdad que es bastante exagerado.Puede ser que sea porque rafa en diesto de mano y al jugar con la izquierda pues debe desarrollarse mas.|`|Da0UHVSfaa	Porque al jugar más golpes con ese brazo, se le ha desarrollado tanto que hay una diferencia con el otro|`|DaAPtgnOaa	la respuesta creo que es obvia.. es el brazo con el que el juega por lo cual lo tiene mas desarrolados los musculos.|`|HPwF6A0Naa	por que con el grande se masturba|`|IoUGPhYoaa	si la vdd luego cuando vez q golpea la pelota o en el agarre  parece q tiene artritis o alguna deformidad en las manos se ve todo rarooo|`|TbhLgDXjaa	porque el solo sirve con una mano y el dry lo hace demasiado potente porque en los jugadores el dry es fundamental para los jugadores porque se les hace mas facil.<br>  ?saludos!|`|2xrkZcFEaa	ja es verdad<br>  uno lo tiene mucho mas trabajado que el otro|`|1a06f2b043b1998401642293e7ebfdc3aa	la verdad no lo he notado.. hehehehehehe pero parece que no es gran inconveniente a la hora de jugar...<br>  <br>  felicidades rafa por tu victoria de ayer...<br>  <br>  espero que el porximo a?o tu y roger se vuelvan a enfrentrar en paris y en la catedral... solo que esa vez ambas finales las gane roger!

MUERDKyzaa	russia today editor on skysports said arshavin is respected alot more in russia and is accepted to be the best player in their league "rather than pavlychenko" (direct quote)|`|7Tw7s6HSaa	No, i reckon the best battle will be chimbona v nasri|`|3638ecbacff09303c04d9f60a89e841baa	I'm quite sure Arshvin ain't playing... Pav's an invisible man in the EPL hope A ain't the same|`|PsCS0GK3aa	I assure you that Keane is all but forgotten :S|`|3dPwxPSGaa	I dont think arshavin will be playing on sunday. He has yet to be confirmed as fit and he needs to be moulded into training session before he play a big game like that|`|ToxDHYsaaa	how do you know Arshavin is even playing? According to him he isn't match fit.|`|C6d5yElWaa	Why do people assume Arshavin will play? The Russian league hasn't played for a few months now, in no way will he be match fit.    It took Vidic at least a month to get match fitness when he was signed from the Russian League in January 2006.|`|DfIFTzkaaa	yo man!!|`|tfotPdeZaa	Arshavin was not excused by Hiddink, so he has to go to Turkey for the Russian National Team meeting. =)  But if he somehow gets out of it, then yeah Romka V. Shava. lol, Pav will be the winnerrr=) DOVAI PAVLYUCHENKA!    Ok i would like to inform you gooners that Zhirkov is the best player in the russian league. and Pavlyuchenko is not the laziest player on the team, i think u got that from hiddink's joke that pav is a sleeping giant. Hiddink did not mean lazy, and also Pav scored the most goals in the russian prem. league =p Also you guys should seriuosly stop bragging about arshavin. your not his first fans, and its really annoying everyone who was his fan b4 u guys learned how to spell his name!|`|SvAwrzZ4aa	liverpool arsenal totenham hav to cheat the deadline to stay on form in the leauge|`|zJCWIWE0aa	Arshavin is alot better than Roman everyone knows that|`|AA12370193	Who says Arshavin will play..|`|B7LyNQtBaa	Arshavin.  Best Friends=Worst Friends.  Grrrrrrrrrrr.|`|WdOAxQmoaa	i herd roman was the laziest player in the russian team.|`|4BppP7Mkaa	Arshavin is already a legend. When asked if he spoke to Pavlyuchenco before he came to Arsenal he replied ''No he is no friend of mine'' *laughs*  Well Pavlyuchenco hasn't done anything this season so i'm pretty sure Arshavin will be much better.|`|jSrPNQlHaa	Arshavin probably won't be playing on Sunday. He's not match fit. The Russian season ended in November. Possibly he may be on the bench.

More Passion, More Pride, More Precision    anddddd, he's home grown talent ;)|`|7evWgrZDaa	VIDIC!!|`|fLpnC8qtaa	Vidic has been far more impressive over the past 2 seasons especially. He has become rock solid and so dependable in almost all circumstances and situations.|`|Rds4eGIyaa	Definitely Vidic. Terry was one of the very best in the world during the title winning years but he has looked average over the last couple of seasons (probably through his injury troubles).|`|Oj9ITMSFaa	Vidic.|`|fEWhwumZaa	Vidic|`|AA12066574	I would say Vidic. He has defended well even when his centre back partner Rio Ferdinand has been hurt. Terry has looked somewhat vulnerable without Ricardo Carvalho.|`|OYYYNCyCaa	Vidic  has developed into a great player for Man Utd -- well done SAF      Terry has become an overpriced and overrated player and thug at Chelsea|`|7Tw7s6HSaa	Vidic|`|uXXbegw5aa	Vidic|`|MjPd9vyYaa	They are both great but Terry because he is more experienced.|`|KOsGtal8aa	vidic.|`|B7LyNQtBaa	Terry.

Terry is more of a feminine type.|`|d99GIH9Uaa	Vidic|`|I7ijGuVcaa	Right now you've got to take vidic - he has become the rock in man u's defense as much as rio ferdinand is. terry is also very volatile and tends to make rash decisions that leave cech and the rest of the chelsea defense stranded. both are good at set pieces so i would give it to vidic.

As for practical application of such a cartridge? Rat control maybe. The only thing less powerful than a 32ACP is a 25ACP. They are both useless cartridges, IMO.|`|omOtAPbsaa	some friends of mine were wildcatters & used to love coming up with crazy rounds. My buddy who took the top prize necked a .30-06 down to hold an old phonograph needle. He could never fire it but it was just fun to try & do. That .32 practical? Nah but he got you to stop at his display which is probably what he wanted to accomplish.|`|05f0ed7a9964bfcd8e3e5fe172f1cf21aa	14's have been experimented with in many fashions.<br>  there are 14's based on the 32 acp, the 222 , 221 and also 14 rimfire.<br>  they are used for close range plinking , usually no more than 50 yards as well as dispatching small pests.|`|AA11694178	I've never seen nor heard of such a thing.  I've never even heard of a .14 caliber bullet.  That's not to say that none has ever existed because someone may have made some to test but I know of none that have ever been put into production.  None of my books makes any reference to a .14 caliber bullet.  It may have been that the particular vendor had bought or made an experimental gun to fire some custom made .14 caliber bullets or he may have simply put together something as a curiosity to get people to come over to his booth.<br>  <br>  I went to a gun show in Houston where one of the vendors had loaded .44 caliber bullets into .357 mag. shells.  I think he was calling them something like the .44 Aggie or the .44 Polish or something like that.  They were interesting and I wanted to see the gun that could chamber them.

I'm very sorry to all yous.|`|LdJFFvSVaa	I don't want to get accused of bullying or being a troll so I'll keep my mouth shut but what can't be denied is that she can't spell!|`|cOPCNP7Laa	Hey girl, at least she doesn't copy and paste other's answers ;) :P|`|UZUl0vG8aa	I know it isint funny but cant stop laughing    Edit:Stop its not funny.........

She sounds very annoying in your words =p    Oh yeah what the first answer said :)|`|3dPwxPSGaa	Omg yeah i saw this question earlier and answered it    Such a slag|`|HxET88bDaa	Haha i liked Ibzy's answer..|`|zJCWIWE0aa	We need love not hate|`|UH1ipgJmaa	Well, by that looks I think she is 32C, which is good.|`|d99GIH9Uaa	She's just annoying  & up herself|`|4BppP7Mkaa	i hate her because she had sex at the age of 14 and shes pregnant.   lol:)  her spelling also p's me off.|`|no3tD0OSaa	Maybe she just wants to get on your nerves, like many of the other WAGS out there|`|cjNtjOZtaa	I can't stand girls like her .    @ Sian , oh Jesus so you start spelling properly ? who are you ? oh I get it , your Mis Holly Torres , you have to be
asxE8gCAaa	i suggest that if there is another good team around that's not playing in the tournament you try and get a few of their players to play on your team to fill the spots|`|OYYYNCyCaa	try and get some other player to play or postpone the match if the other side agrees
q4YGEjS4aa	If your coach makes you pick one go for the one you want most.  You'll work hard at it.      Most times, specially in a small school you'll be able to try out for multiple positions.  Do both.  I'm a lefty.  I've played every position except 3B and Centerfield.  I am only 5'8" and was much shorter than you in when I was in jv. I was a starting 1B man.  If you are reliable and good at blocking bad throws or can even scoop em you'll be just fine.  Coaches love having options.  My coaches always loved that fact that I could catch, play corner outfield, was a starting and closing pitcher.  I just love playing and I always got more playing time beside when situations arise I could fill in most anywhere.       You never know your coach might have a big need for a third baseman and maybe your best fit will be there.  The best 3B I've ever played with was left handed. Good luck and work hard.  You'll earn alot of respect from teammates and coaches that way. It'll pay off.|`|Fen6g3f9aa	I would go for outfield, the coach can always try you at first as well, If you can play outfield, the move to first will be realitively easy. Whatever you do, show interest in both. You may be able to try both positions.   Don't let size stop you. Our CF in high school, was 4ft 9, but was one of the best players on the team.. and he was a senior|`|Mxzz2my7aa	ur too small go 4 outfield esp as a fresh|`|pYKRoKK6aa	most of the time the lefties are at first base but as you said you don't have the height. if you are fast stick to the outfield. the first baseman has a lot of pressure on him since fifty percent of the plays end up in his hands better make sure you can catch everything. good luck!|`|mqgS6Dfxaa	Since there's 3 times as many outfield spots as 1B spots I think the odds are better to try out for outfield.|`|yJ8DqPA0aa	Outfield, i recon. More of a chance making the team.   Or just do the one your good in|`|d065d40a6781127c80dc5959554a2d4faa	Go for varsity. Why settle for one? A coach loves when you can play multiple positions, it will also help you get into a game.|`|ak5A435maa	1B is more fun|`|7rjWMG8waa	There are 3 outfield positions and 1 1B and your to small. I have friends who play varsity baseball and they told me to try out for the outfield.
WrDGhduxaa	You can wear your own robe and trunks. Some times they make you change the color of the trunks.  If you wear that robe you had better win.|`|xwpePURIaa	Thats awesome.
1f2275fd28d7683c5e7a9cf2d702e88aaa	Keep practicing of course and build up your arm strength. Dont forget to bend your knees too the more you bend them the more hop you get.|`|JSGLKnA4aa	EAT MORE RABBITS!!|`|DFug1qB2aa	Wow all good answers very true but also when i started riding bmx i had like a 40 pound bike now i have a 26 pound bike and i can hop like 2 and a half feet off the ground so if u have a heavy bike try lighting it hope this helps|`|LiOOF1Plaa	Pedals level with ground, point both toes downward, and kick up and back with your heels...to get rear end high enough- while pulling you bars to your hips...then push downwards, once the rear goes up. Practice makes perfect.|`|FIG58FVpaa	The best thing to do is keep practicing!     Try setting up something that will just fall down if you hit it (try a couple of cardboard boxes flattened and propped up against each other) and try to jump over them. Keep switching to bigger boxes when you can clear the smaller ones.|`|Fx5BENIxaa	keep practicing|`|vy1Wil2Baa	when you bunny hop you only get as high as your front tire. try pulling up as high as you can in the front with out falling and don't forget to "tuck" so you can reach the maximum height you are capable of reaching, just keep practicing and eventually you will be able to bunny hop like the pros
NsYIUu3caa	as the storyline said, if he was to hit JBL before the match then he would void his contract but surrender ownership of his name rights to him, thus he left the ring like that to keep from kicking his teeth in.|`|kY6H6Fvaaa	No, WWE has gone soft|`|JvSCCiKfaa	Nah hes just playing his part right now, the show stopper will be back soon:)|`|Z1ruPjmCaa	jbl told micheals if he hit him before no way out he his name would be used without even being in the match at no way out|`|5xIroQjMaa	That would only be possible if Shawn Michaels had ever been not soft to begin with. This guy hasn't been worth watching since he was a Rocker. And that's a long time.|`|mDuiiVN7aa	HBK is playing his role great as he always does. He must play a broken and dependent man, that is why he looks soft to you. Believe me, he is Still the show stopper, the main event and mr.wrestle mania, as soon as his story line with JBL is over, he will be good old HBK again !!!|`|IIdhUedsaa	no i think hes just acting that role so he can support his children and wife after that he is going to get payback
91be33a93393b2cfe2ea14aae38ab03daa	Of course not. I am a figure skater and I, of course, find ice skating easier. But, it's really a matter of preference. Ice skating and roller blading are not as similar as most people would think. The blade of an ice skate can hardly be compared to the wheels of a roller skate/rollerblade. The only thing th same is the actual boot. In addition, many of the maneuvers are much different. Furthermore, I know plenty of people, not just in the ice skating world, that think rollerskating is easier. In fact, my doctor just mentioned that fact to me the other day, ironically.<br>  <br>  Tell your boyfriend I think he's weird for thinking rollerskating is easier. :)|`|u1XPgNJ4aa	Nope, not at all! haha Actually, it's that way for me, too... But that might just be because I am a figure skater, and have been skating for 8 years :-)|`|ghPzWipnaa	nah.  i learned to rollerblade first, but all my skating skills did not transfer over to ice skating cause they aren't exactly the same.  so i imagine you would find one or the other easier|`|SWsDa1iXaa	Haha, you are not weird! I am like that aswell. I just never got the hand of rollerskating! Neat question. :)|`|Rs5QTZ85aa	no
lWNc9NRfaa	Time for the west, 138 - 131.    MVP - ???, I'll go with Tony Parker just so it will be someone new. Paul has a strained right groin that could limit how much he wants to play.|`|DkwgogXZaa	The West  the MVP will be Chris Paul|`|98wFqBwSaa	1) West  2) CP3|`|Ga11Abmzaa	East 133-121 2OT victory.

443abc47eeff617e8dfb6b03a1b5dc30aa	Staal! no brainer|`|hHXG8ef6aa	spez|`|9vLzGwVqaa	Eric Staal!|`|jwPf5rsiaa	Spazza is playing for a new coach tonight. Very often a team will try and impress those first cpl of games. Look for Spazza to try and weasel his way into the good books.|`|Icze35Nqaa	Spezza 1 pt in last 3 games  Staal 2 pts in last 6 games    Carolina is away playing Vancouver  Ottawa is at home playing LA    I would pick Spezza|`|64LZW2y8aa	Jason Spezza. New coach, look for the Spezza to step up his game tonight, as should all of the Senators. I'd stick with Spezza.|`|IP0fzRw2aa	Eric Staal. The Second half has been good to Staal...
ypIlLtanaa	Yes, Madden09 and Head Coach09, Madden will show you which defense is which, and Head Coach09 will actually tell you and show you the difference in the defense and offense schemes. If you are playing either game and you see nothing but red circles from your linebackers and db's that is a zone coverage, if you see little marks beside their number its a man defense. most of the defenses mix it up between zone and man. Offense if you see a orange line next to the rb's number it is a run, if you see 1-4 yellow lines and 1 orange line (total equals 5 max) then it is a pass and the receiver with the orange line is you hot receiver read receiver or better known as the first look. The best thing to do is get books on this or if able play with a group team with a coach, ex.HS College AFL SPFL|`|Bgpk4npBaa	listen Madden09 is like 50$ not 10 unless you but an older game|`|QADhk0nFaa	madden also there is a COACH game its bout 10 dollars haha im a girl and i bought it you can get it at a wallmart they have some on there and you can make your own but you not playing ur coaching|`|ZUlnZvaWaa	YAAAAAAAAAAAAAA FOOTBALL I LOVE TO RUN ME IN TO SUM PPL YAAAAAAAA I LUV MAH PADDED HELMET YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA WHO NEEDS STRAT WE WILL JUST FOGET IT
GswnLKtQaa	Yes, he's been consistent for the Nets. He and Harris had carried the load for their team.<br>  <br>  Nets have a very tough west games and road trip, VC must bring his A game for the Nets to win.|`|4DcvpQXfaa	Yes<br>  <br>  He will show the Nets thats' he's worthy!|`|5FypDafWaa	Yes he and lopez will carry the team.|`|kRJ7Liu4aa	I hope so
H82AYTpsaa	i would try to get billups. if you are doing bad in FT, billups will definatly help. He would also help you get out of the middle in 3's, assists and steals. according to your information, billups would be a perfect fit.    good luck|`|1OeNP92yaa	get randy foye every nigt when i watch ESPN its seems like hes putting up 20 every game|`|SEcM9EDZaa	You'd be smart to move Millsap because his numbers could drop when Boozer comes back, probably after the break. Otherwise, I'd trade Hilario before Duncan.|`|Ee0JPnrxaa	i would do deron for duncan you have a solid rebounding and blocking  team and deron would probally help you out alot. he is the 2nd best pg in the league next to cp and him and cp are the only two pg to average double digit assists  i believe
6Efhd6lNaa	Trust me Im a fantasy guy. Pick up Turiaf. He gets crazy blocks (about 2) and decent rebounds. He shoots about 50% from the field and 80% from the line, both of those will help you. Also he is finally starting to get consistent minutes in Nelson's offense so his overall production will definitely go up.    I would also recommend Thompson if you need points, rebounds and fg%, but I definitely like Turiaf more.|`|XSCpe9JHaa	pietrus, mikael|`|ZAh8CEoGaa	Raja Bell.|`|Ga5QdZoXaa	Andres Nocioni,Kirk Hinrich or Raja Bell|`|jDi45m0uaa	Nocioni|`|9rVQwJ59aa	Tyson Chandler
lRotJdEWaa	right now, pietrus.  they are also on the same team and he will be talking over his playing time|`|1OeNP92yaa	Hinrich hes from Iowa|`|CxlU410Uaa	1) Thompson - things are only going to get better once B. Miller is traded  2) Hinrich - Bulls are playing poorly and still looking for answers - now that Hinrich is healthy, he'll start getting 30 mins/gm.  3) AK47 - solid all around player, only pick him up if you have the patience to wait a few weeks.|`|bpzI7SQkaa	louis williams  mickael pietrus  mike conley|`|Btm50kIwaa	the only player in the nba tht matters is danny granger.. mvp threat if his team wsnt so bad. can you say complete stud?
uiO590WJaa	i don't agree with most of the other other answers,  just because he's 23 doesn't give him an excuse to be smokin mary jane   there's a lot of kids out there that wanna be just like phelps and it was incredibly irresponsible to do       anyways, if you're gonna do your mary jane, do it inside your own house where no one can see you ( and especially DON"T DO IT AT A PARTY with a 100 people watching you)     i don't know bout you, but if i were to smoke a bong and was world-famous, i would do smoke it where no one is watching me (except my mary jane buddies)       it was especially stupid because just about all of  those people watching him had camera phones      JUST SAYING SORRY DOESN'T MAKE UP FOR WHAT HE DID!|`|idZpEDIdaa	Not really.  I know he is a "role model" but he is a kid being a kid.  I was doing the same stuff when I was his age (well, minus the DUI).|`|FlKrA3nEaa	yay for bongs.|`|YGBowL4Uaa	I thought it was awesome!!!!!|`|pF63IMyVaa	hes arrogant because hes 23. your gonna say you werent at his age? at his age would you be worrying about your every move because some consider you a role model? its rare to find a role model who doesnt do something wrong at some point. we're all human. parents should teach their kids that.|`|7t7XzXsVaa	Yes|`|WwXrTQgaaa	huh?        wha?        haw?    |`|OeFNGqbzaa	who gives a damn about phelps its all about usain bolt|`|oBmLIDHtaa	I agree.    He is role mold.    I am disappointed with him - it's nobodies f'ing business how he spends his free time.    He shouldn't have apologized to anyone.    Who cares if he blew off some high school kids?  Were you one of those kids?    Get a life dude.|`|3wAkbWqSaa	yea, unlike u i didnt c it comin.  my friend said tht evryone wll 4give him- after all he did say sorry,  =(

Both have won the world cup and many other series. I will support Younus Khan because Sri Lanka have not been performing well recently. You cannot judge Pakistan from their previous performance and we all saw that in the odi series. Pak won the first match by 8 WICKETS but lost the next two really badly. Pakistan can do anything so I am going with Younus Khan.|`|3GHIyXWTaa	I THINK IT WILL BE YOUNIS KHAN BECAUSE SRILANKA HAD LOST THEIR ALL SERIES AGAINST INDIA|`|NP5IX3CQaa	M.Jayawardan|`|2BWrVf4Raa	Jayawardene|`|AA11088802	MJ|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	mahela|`|f46e40cfc0dd6c8bb80ff83f005fc521aa	Younis Khan has already captained Pak team a few times but resigned for some reason a few years back.But let him have success some time later for Mahela to have a memorable success in his final series as captain.|`|JyYAArPNaa	Jaywardane|`|cdfab17577ad8962b270c540b0b46e98aa	MJ|`|561a42dcf730fd97fc3a2ebd788ea961aa	MJ....<br>  forver<br>  <br>  cheers~

bzwSCm6taa	when i started going to the rangers games it was before the souness era..rangers weren't winning every week..ibrox was half empty in fact nearly totally empty a few thousand sometime but my dad still took us..so no he wasn't a glory hunter and neither were we..he actually stopped going not long after souness came cos he didn't like some who had latched onto the club..people who had never been to ibrox in their lives but were suddenly going nuts if rangers did not win every week..i don't get to every game cos of work and because i honestly can't bloody afford it but i can assure you i would love to go week in week out...preferably if they were winning but i would still go if they weren't.....good question..x|`|S0LSmJ9haa	being as honest as I can...<br>  <br>  My dad supports newcastle and always has, but he always had a soft spot for Celtic, growing up in England we didn't get the chance very often to see them play, much to his distaste I didn't follow his love of Newcastle.<br>  I went to my first Celtic match a few years back and was hooked, more so than the few games I had seen on the TV, which is natural...I also found the "divide" the most intense thing I had ever witnessed, I still find it very difficult to understand how football can cause such bitterness, yet i find myself rising to the bait....<br>  even with all the anti-English shite that is sometime thrown at me, I love this country and it's complete and total passion for football, believe me, it is far more intense than in England.<br>  and to answer the last part of your question, plenty of people on Celtic fan sites are threatening not to renew teir season tickets, but I have read it all before, the attendances are dire right now but we cannot blame the credit crunch for all of it, the fact that my team is pish at the moment doesn't help me gain the momentum to go and get pi55 wet through on a saturday afternoon.<br>  <br>  war and peace volume 2 over x|`|57edf00d97af522b314c33475bf1e853aa	So pish at both teams are 1st and 2nd in the league.<br>  <br>  With 40,000 - 50,000+ followers everyweek.MUPPET!!|`|fQgaQx4baa	aye they are that pish yet still manage to fill our grounds|`|3sItMgOIaa	Bull. Brought up supporting Celtic because my father was born in the east end of Glasgow. One half of my family was born in glasgow and I am the first generation to be born in Ireland. As a matter of fact I was born in Newry where Willie Maley who played for celtic against Rangers in 1888 and was the first ever Celtic manager was born.  And Brother Walfrid was Irish too. I don't go to many games because fares to Scotland can be expensive but I watch every game wheiter it be on Setanta or if I'm left listening to it on the radio or watching it online in some forgein language. I think that's more than enough reasons for me to support Celtic and as for both teams being pish well take a look at the table and then think that one through again. And last time I checked The Old Firm are the only ones to ever have won the SPL.|`|GkFlzMHMaa	Does full mean full to capacity? that is the dictionary definition anyway? I kind of stumped with that one when you look at the average attendances for both Old Firm this season, and that's not including cup games i might add which would farther bring the average down. I know I know i cannot help that I'm so clever..<br>  <br>  Any-way your now a muppet for asking what seems to me a genuine Question, that's the problem around here you see, you ask any-thing genuine about the Old Firm, and all you get is abuse, there is no debate, there is no genuine answer to respond to the genuine question. And the abuse don't just stop here, you will get a in-box full of hate mail, giving the old i know some army dudes, and there coming to get you. And then they will start explaining on how you are the biggest pricck since sliced bread blah blah blah. Up the Pope and fck the Pope, all sorts of shite. I put it down to education my-self, well there is a bit of this "I'm behind my screen stuff" you know cowardly acts and all. <br>  <br>  But your question is very genuine, and you don't honestly expect them to be honest about the "whys" i support the OF do you? Genuine OF supporters will tell why, and these are the ones i respect, buts its the ones that give you abuse are the ones hiding some-thing. Could there wee pee brains not come out with some made up excuse to why they support them? NO NO there brains don't function that way, they would rather just insult to make there self's feel better about there glory hunting ways. If you stick around here you tend to know who the genuine OF supporters are, and who are the ones that latch on to them. the latches on always make mistakes.

Going to a Protestant school, while many of my pals went to a Catholic one, meant that I mixed a lot more with similarly minded youngsters, the most of whom also 'supported' Rangers if they were interested in the game. Our school team played against other 'Proddy' schools (except when we occasionally met a Catholic team in a mixed cup competition) which further reinforced strong feelings of attachment to the Ibrox club. <br>  <br>  As for abandoning them during bad spells like now (only two points behind with the chance of two cups..."bad" spell?)...I don't think so...true supporters stick with their team till the demise of one or the other. Football fans are (naively or otherwise) much more loyal than any player, manager, director or owner.|`|MbeTFIkFaa	You dedicate so much time to your club,that you take the good with the not so good.You think they are pish true fans will se it as a sticky patch.|`|GHefTsUyaa	They still dominate the domestic scene and that's why most people support them.<br>  There was a while in the 70's when Rangers struggled a bit and attracted crowds of a few thousand.<br>  Their "loyal" fans disappeared like sna' in a tha'.|`|7Tw7s6HSaa	Aye, we're pish but the stadium is still full.<br>  <br>  I started supporting Celtic when Rangers were on their 4th league title in a row, only to go on and win another 5, does that make me a glory hunter, because we won fuk all back then

I hate to burst your bubbles but anything that's California legal will never be qualified as a so called "assault rifle".<br>  <br>  PS: "Assault rifle" is a term politicians and media love to use because it makes things sounds a lot scarier. They could have used something like "infantry rifle" or "battle rifle" but those terms simply aren't as exciting as the term "assault rifle". Besides, terms like "infantry rifle" and "battle rifle" are too limiting. "Assault rifle" could be applied to a wide array of small arms.|`|mFa5ZDtcaa	I believe it may be time for you to leave California.

ZNKuGsB7aa	For standard green side bunkers, I try to envision a dollar bill on the ground directly behind the ball (long ways).  Try to blast the imaginary dollar bill out of the sand by hitting the back of it.|`|AYkEwqRXaa	Practice for both questions. If you practice enough you'll develop muscle memory for when you're on the course.  Develop a pre-shot routine and use it on each shot.  As far as the bunker, it's not a shot I practice very often because for one, I don't hit into bunkers very often and two, I understand how to hit a bunker shot.  You don't want to hit the ball on a greenside bunker shot.  You want the sand to push the ball out of the bunker.  You have to slide the club underneath the ball and hit through the sand.  I suggest you practice it since you seem to have trouble doing it.  When I've practiced it in the past, I struggled with it, so I stopped practicing because of the few times I've been in a bunker, I executed the shot well.  I get out of a bunker in one shot at least 80% of the time without practicing so  that's a fairly decent percentage.  The sound you want to hear when you're hitting out of a bunker is "Thump" not "Click".  Click spells more trouble.|`|wYGeg0QRaa	TB you are asking for an answer to an age old problem and I can only give you my perspective. Like everyone I guess I was always focused for a few holes and found myself losing it on the back nine all the time although I would often score well there. I finally got to where I could stay in the moment when I found that I could hardly wait to hit the next shot regardless of where on the course it was and began to get into it when I arrived at my ball completely engrossed in the shot at hand. I learned I guess to enjoy hitting the difficult shots as much as the straight forward ones. I never really scored any better but I sure stopped screwing up good rounds and turned poor rounds around more often. As for playing bunker shots the best tip you'll ever get is do what the tour players do and open the blade on your wedge to bring the bounce into play and learn how far behind the ball to hit it.|`|96zZlJVYaa	you have to practice the bunker shots and for focus only on the next shot.|`|CvRscCrjaa	stay focused by playing with someone who is better than you. you dont want to embarass yourself. nice easy swing about an inch behind the ball should get you out of the trap.|`|kGur839Daa	forget any bad shots you have made, there is nothing you can do about them now. and focus on your next shot. to get out of the bunker open your club face up some and hit a few inches behind the ball and follow all the way through and you will get out of the bunker.

I watched it.  and the scorecard ir right.  It was a classy bating innings by Ponting, shwoing it is not all about slog shots.  (i am a kiwi too)|`|AA11088802	no|`|kecdkv6jaa	I think that was the first ever international T20 match.<br>  <br>  someone will correct me if i'm wrong but i'm pretty sure it was.
9hC7bbf7aa	Number 9 with 3,480 points, right behind Gilles Simon.|`|RC3WoqFkaa	9th|`|k6M48eUMaa	He is currently ranked  9.|`|bsG2smjWaa	Number 9 with 3,480 points|`|gCGbbIMcaa	9th
wnZ0N3wjaa	He's number 9 now I think so he went up 5 places from 14 and you shoulda put this in tennis section.|`|M8XmhqIhaa	You're looking for the Tennis section.|`|AA11088802	he played really welll in semis .. but its the wrong section|`|gfxXikenaa	this is wrong section but king gave you the right answer~    TU to king and congratz for your favorite player nadal winning aussie open~|`|2HFqoUPcaa	He will surely figure in the top 15 if not top 10 .|`|f46e40cfc0dd6c8bb80ff83f005fc521aa	His baseline strokes are as good or even better than Nadal's but has to cut down unforced errors.Will soon be among top 8.  But Nadal plays the crucial points much better.|`|Y31Ci8vlaa	He will enter into top 10 of the ATP rankings.Fernando verdasco's run till semifinal of the australian open will certainly help him for his other tournaments.He just looks as excellent as nadal was.I wish him good luck.|`|bettx8AYaa	who is verdasco    i know gamma d vasco|`|Dre0GbSBaa	wonder how to compare him with muralitharan, ponting or dhoni
TgUCZzyIaa	nice...|`|0Dm3WEMcaa	I'd like to see Evan Bourne in the money in the bank match instead of say carlito.<br>  <br>  I like the idea of just Cena vs. Edge... i know it has happened before but that was nearly two years ago and things have changed since. <br>  <br>  Jeff vs. Matt shouldn't have a gimmick this early in the feud it needs to be just one on one building to the gimmick matches IMO. <br>  <br>  Other than that i think you have pretty much just named the card we are expecting, not sure if the IC and US titles will be defended but i hope so because they need to do more with the straps then they are doing. Other than that you have ticked all the boxes, better than half the crap "what do you think of my wm card?" normally seen on this site.|`|KIOR56r6aa	Undertaker vs HBK will steal the whole damn show!!!|`|qbEeecndaa	looks about right

(26-0) record, but still.|`|GBGcI509aa	Yeah there not as good as there roster says.|`|lWNc9NRfaa	bad, not really.    old and lost, could be|`|wTWg4WSaaa	the suns play no defense. how do you expect to win if you just base your self on offense.    they say they wanna be a good defensive team. but if you look at they chracter they just like the denver nuggets from last year and denver is what phoenix use to be right now.    denver ftw just want them to make it past first round this year. if they happen to get past the 2nd round  i will be so happy. and if they make it to the conference finals and win that then i will be really happy and if they make it to the finals i will be the hypest person at my school.|`|RkWw38KNaa	good enough 2 woop UR big no good butt!|`|U28gVUKFaa	the phoenix suns are so bad that when other teams come to play them half the team actually plays and the other half go watch the cardinals.|`|FSMpMA9saa	The suns are not as good as they use to be, but they are still good team.. Just a couple years ago they were the best offense team in the NBA. I mean they got Stoudmier who averages what maybe 21 points a game, he's always on his game. and what about the big man downlow Shaq, he's getting better @ those freethrows..    but ya spurs are pretty good this year..you know tim duncan is always doing his thing, along with ginobili..   But the Celtics are having a pretty good season this year, with K.G..

This Rockets team when health is probably the 2nd best team in the West and could compete with the Lakers for  1.     Unfortunately thats not the case, Yao misses games almost every year, they got Artest and even he has been somewat injury prone. McGrady is as fragile as glass. Hopefully they can all somehow be healthy during the playoffs and they will have a great shot at making to the finals.|`|OeFNGqbzaa	dont worry he'll be gone next year|`|AJEDjzC1aa	There has been a lot of rumors that the Rockets are ready to get rid of Tracy McGrady....    http://bleacherreport.com/articles/11858...|`|9rVQwJ59aa	T_WAC IS HIS REAL NAME BABY!!!!!!!!!!!|`|FSMpMA9saa	Why not keep T-MAC..  When you see him, you got nothing else to do but get down and bow..that man is a known legend.. one of the best players.. without him rockets would be no where their past years, i know one man does not win the game, but without him, things wouldn't be the same either
SKe9LcOfaa	who is jeff hardy why do i keep seeing his name everywhere|`|gXHxf2G9aa	I don't think so...the youngest of the family is usually regarded as being the spoilt one but he hasn't shown anything that suggests he is spoilt....but maybe i'm wrong?|`|1z7M3Tntaa	Who are you to judge you dont even know him|`|JiCfYfLraa	yea i agree. matt hardy did everything for that boy and jeff shows him no respect so matt had to put him in his place so personally i agree.|`|5nfqY9T7aa	I'm sure they have brotherly love in real life, despite all the gimmicks they make them do.|`|P3g2Gz2Yaa	storyline|`|7f2GSDmqaa	Im not a Jeff Hardy fan at all|`|3ExtDP45aa	Its just a storyline. <br>  I don't think Jeff is spoilt, although Matt does say in a dvd they brought out that he feels like people dont really get to see what he is like because Jeff is the high flyer<br>  Matt & Jeff are a close family, you can see that in the picture of them on Matt's myspace, although they may have been taken off, because his myspace plays along with his character in WWE|`|85ecad91da4761d50060ea7e04b61701aa	Yeah hmmm to answer to some people who believe Jeff dosent care about Matt i dont know if you are talking about reality or storyline wise but if you are talking storyline wise if you look back to when Jeff  Made his debut return to Raw Edge was the current WWE Champion and he was on the mic during one of the Skits Edge started to rave on about how he took Lita of Matt and i think Matt was injured at the time or somthing but when Edge spoke of this who came to the ring??? None other than Jeff Hardy so i actually do think Jeff Has alot of respect for his brother|`|77b5BDf3aa	Hell no he isn't. since when does it mean your spoiled if all you care about is yourself??? plus he cares about Matt. Remember when Jeff was in a match and Matt had , had surgery on his appendix or w/e and he was back stage and randy beat him up and showed up on the titan tron and yelled Jeff....Hey Jeff.....and he attacked matt and Jeff didn't care about the match anymore and he ran straight back there to help him out.|`|AAk9BtAtaa	no! matt is worse than jeff , by far the fans appreciate jeff more than matt and matt is jealous of that.|`|TgUCZzyIaa	no....He realy loves his brother ...Do u remember the matches where jeff saved matt.....|`|1WgOj89kaa	It is a storyline, im sure in real life, they are best buddies.|`|GgWrhISBaa	No he isnt he is just more like able then matt|`|BYw0LXguaa	sorry,i dont know him|`|dvevk1qbaa	prom lee
7ImGw976aa	I'd say the WWE title because it seems like the main one.<br>  But in looks wise Heavyweight is better than the World Championship, the World Championship looks like a toy and not really a prize you want to win.|`|7f2GSDmqaa	The WHT...it has even more history to it than the WWE title, since it was once the NWA/WCW title|`|P3g2Gz2Yaa	wwe all the way|`|Z31fwTMcaa	You'll get alot of opinions, but the fact is that the two championships are the same. In 2002 the WWE realized they wanted the same championship on Raw and Smackdown. So, they basically made it so that each show had its own version of the championship.<br>  <br>  The WWE Championship and World Heavyweight Championship are equal, neither one is more important than the other.<br>  <br>  Just the same as the Intercontinental Championship is the same as the United States Championship, the Women's Championship is the same as the Diva's Championship, and the World Tag Team Championship is the same as the WWE Tag Team Championship.|`|BCyTD7nIaa	WHC- <br>  WWE will not let anyone change that belt no matter what.<br>  Guess how they let John Cena treat the other one- he made it a freaking SPINNER belt. How can you tell me the World Heavyweight Championship carries less power than a  spinner belt?|`|Z5bH2LOZaa	I would say the WWE as well and for the same reason as you. Way more history.<br>  But I would also say that it would be anyone that Edge does not have.|`|9ijwrcTZaa	DEPENDS ON WHO IS HOLDIN THE STRAPS...|`|tPFikOY7aa	World Heavyweight title.

FtVfuByHaa	if you mean figure skating, first of all you should make sure that you are not afraid to fall. You need to have the courage to try new and different things and be able to put yourself out there. Secondly, practice the basic skating style forwards and backwards before you move into any jumps or pirouettes etc. Practice more than once a week and do also other sports in addition to skating =D|`|bvnzv923aa	Stand up strait. Go slowly and stay by the wall. Do not cling to the wall the entire time though. Just keep near so that if you start to feel off balanced, you can just grab onto the wall. But another way to catch yourself is hold your arms out to the sides of you parallel to the ice, I know it looks really weird but it looks better than sitting on the ice. Start off slowly, or at a comfortable pace for you. I know that you will see those people skating really fast around you and you'll want to imitate that, but don't. You will fall if you try to keep up with a skater or hockey player. Speed up a little bit if you are comfortable with that. never go out of your comfort zone. That is always when beginners fall. If you feel fine on the ice, try to do a small 2 footed spin, or try to do crossovers (Just put one foot crossed over the other to go around the corners and stuff) and every time that you go, keep practicing it and you'll get better. Make up a little bit of a program every time you go and practice it. It will be fun to have your own little program of moves that you can do. Most importantly, have fun. That's really what skating is about. :)|`|AA12232407	Skate with someone who's a good skater and can help you learn away from the boards. The ice is better there. I did the usual and kept a hand near the boards while I was learning, someone told me the ice was better away from there but I didn't dare leave the boards, they had to be in grabbing distance. But once I had the courage to go further onto the ice my skating got better a lot quicker.|`|4T5iaRKcaa	i teach basic skills and if you've never skated before start by marching across the ice...no joke then march and glide. then eventually just skate and glide and when you fall you should get up by getting on your knees  putting one knee  up putting both hands on your knee and push yourself up...dont use the wall it wont help you!!!|`|iynxbd9Daa	put your feet directly beneath your shoulders for a centered stance and slightly poke your butt out (as if you have just been punched in the gut)<br>  really...  practice makes perfect, but in the meantime hope this helps|`|6sPsYqSYaa	Don't fall over.<br>  <br>  It may hurt ;)
wqOpAGkuaa	United still have to play Liverpool, Villa and Arsenal in their remaining games so it is definetly not all over yet.

5uzHW4CYaa	Hello!   That's good that you have goals even through something that could've possibly held you back.  If you have a big yard, just sprint from fence to fence. Remember to breath, get lots of rest in between runs.   There are butterfly kicks that are core and leg work outs. And leg lifts which help the core and legs. FitTV has programs running all day with stuff like that that can help in the beginning, to give you ideas.   Try so isokinetic exercising if your school has a weight room, or a Recreational center.  Ask coaches, even if you don't know them for tips. I bet they'd be glad to help.  Good luck!|`|XDXzuv6taa	I was best at short distance running when I did track. You can practice each week running 100 meters or more. Also if you have healthy food before running, it works abunch ...good luck!|`|70AGy17eaa	I have a lot of leg muscle I do a lot of squats and just run the track every day if I can try and lift light wights with your legs|`|AcSvwT01aa	Hi  Just to start off, you know Paula Radcliffe has a type of asthma, and it seriously doesn't stop her.  anyway, start by talking to your coach because he will tell you whats happening in your local area to help people like you start to run. in your local area, start doing little sprints and 200-400 m running, to build up endurance and strength in your legs. exercersisng your legs and arms is vital in sprinting, mainly because you don't alot of air. The arms will propell you forwards while your legs follow your arms. This means that weight, leg and arm training is necessary.  Have fun!

They have a nice pop and are very light weight. They are good in the groomed areas or the powder. Also a very good park ski. They have nice flotation, and rotation. For about $300 without bindings you could get the 2009 K2 silencers, ive head those are good|`|OMEDzf3maa	I like Scott or K2. these are good for freestyle and offpiest so you cant go wrong.

I would mix it up a bit...Box/sit ups/Box/side straddle hops/Box/ run in place....all shadow boxing.|`|LSg84ucPaa	It does help a bit, but to be honest like the other guy said running is the best thing for that, and if its too cold like you surely u can get a skipping rope, that sure does take over for the running.
ucot94w3aa	That's pretty much impossible to answer.    The schools a player gets scholarship offers from depend upon the players abilities (as long as he is academically eligible as well).  The best players in the country get offers from the big name Division 1 schools.  If you aren't a truly amazing player in high school, you aren't going to get offers from D1 schools.    And by "good college" do you mean a college that is academically excellent or one that has a successful football program?  The schools that are best academically with decent football would be Stanford, Cal, Vanderbilt, and Virginia.|`|f7qVtYfaaa	any  college that offers you a scholarship is interested in you so if you have talent that they are looking for they should be sending you letters of interest|`|oJLCAKxuaa	Depends on the player  and his goals for  playing college football.      If he wants to go on to the NFL.  Usually a BCS  conference school would give him enough showcase.      If he wants to compete  for a national championship,   he should look for schools that have been to the  BCS championship game and still have the same   head coach.        If he just wants a good education and have football pay for it, there are lots of good universities that do not necessarily compete for the national championship, but  are good schools academically.|`|z6pdWKa5aa	Auburn.
LSg84ucPaa	Cruiser Weight my friend    cheers|`|3906124cfbe15ee474641dd5c529df6caa	That's cruiserweight (176-190) you are right at the limit of that weight class.|`|4jeddGOvaa	welter weight if you can get to 200 idk im not sure|`|1MTj578Uaa	For amateurs, here is the breakdown:  Weight Classes      Light flyweight (106 pounds)    Flyweight (112 pounds)    Bantamweight (119 pounds)    Featherweight (125 pounds)    Lightweight (132 pounds)    Light welterweight (141 pounds)    Welterweight (152 pounds)    Middleweight (165 pounds)    Light heavyweight (178 pounds)    Heavyweight (201 pounds)    Super heavyweight (+201 pounds)    The numbers shown are upper cutoffs for that weight class. According to the chart, that would put you in the heavyweight class.     If you have weight you could lose (fat), Light Heavy should be a good class for your height (IMHO of course). Only 12 lbs you need to drop, and you should be one of the stronger guys in the LtHeavy class...  And you would get a lot faster too, without sacrificing strength...     Lol, and Strength x Speed = Lots and Lots of Power ;)

If the small head rackets were any match for the oversized ones they'd still be in use.    if I were a pro (or an amateur!) I'd use whatever equipment allowed me to do the best on the court.

Oversized heads are for beginners and non-oversized heads are for the more advanced players.  All brands have them because pros are endorsed by them and thus, pros don't like to use oversized heads that cramp up their swing speed or playing style.  You can find any online by just googling tennis racquets, tennis warehouse has lots of them.|`|eY1Vttiyaa	The best control racket (opposite of oversize) is the K6.1 90 inches, which is the one that Fed uses.  For me, it is a bit heavy, but I'm 13 and let's face it, not buff.
XTDeAfTqaa	Yes! Just putting 2 lb weights on your ankles during the day will strengthen your legs, butt and even stomach. Just doing everyday things with the weights on will make a huge difference. Just don't overdo it.|`|WrDGhduxaa	No, that is absolutely the wrong thing to do. Do not use ankle weights or weights in your shoes.  It will not make you faster, but it might well injure you.  Lift weights, do plyometric exercises. Practice technique and form.  Stretch and stay flexible.|`|zdynudBAaa	Yes, the more the better. Put 100lbs on and you'll soar like an eagle
TH1fT6rdaa	I like GSP, but Silva is bigger and his strikes are better. Silva isn't necessarily that hard to take down, but actually getting through his punches and knees is nearly impossible. Dan Henderson was able to take Silva down and control him for most of Round 1, but he tried to do it in Round 2 and got his face punched in. Also, Henderson took down Silva by a Greco-Roman bodylock, where GSP uses freestyle wrestling.    GSP likes to clinch, then drop to a double and take his opponent down.  But, clinching with Silva is a bad idea, as Silva has arguably the best Muay Thai clinch in MMA.  Look at what he did to Rich Franklin.  Attacking Silva's legs is going directly for his ever dangerous knees. And, Anderson Silva is a BJJ black belt, who can body triangle from the bottom.  But, Silva's guard really isn't that good, which is good for GSP.  Silva is good at neutralizing opponents' attacks in the guard, but his guard is easily passed.    GSP does have a chance, though, if he can out wrestle Silva for 5 rounds and control him on the ground.  The difference will be whether or not GSP can get through Silva's strikes for the whole match.    I'd give it to Anderson Silva by 2nd or 3rd Round TKO.|`|BNqbOfBsaa	Size edge... Silva      Striking edge.... Silva      Wrestling/jiu jitsu edge.... GSP      Conditioning edge... GSP (GSP has gone many more rounds than Silva)      camps/coach.... GSP          I think with the right strategy GSP would have a real shot at beating Silva. I would still give Silva a slight edge because he is the champ at 185 lbs!       Silva is 6 '2  GSP 5'11       Silva walks around 230 lbs! GSP walks around 185 or so.|`|2jaOYfGyaa	What a GREAT match up. This would settle the whole, "whose the best pound for pound question." Both of these guys are class acts who train incredibly hard. At the end of GSP's last fight, the announcer even hinted at this match up. So you know it's really in the works. I would have to give the upper hand to Silva, due to his reach, spead. And his take down defense is a lot better than BJ's. I can't wait!!|`|Qn6ERwZcaa	As much as I like GSP, I'd have to go with Silva-I think Silva has a slight edge on striking..GSP has been caught before, by Serra, by Penn (their first match when he was all bloodied up).  I would love to see GSP win though|`|o9F9iJ8eaa	gsp will lose to alves, so the fight wont happen against silva|`|IRNvfdB9aa	The best pound for pound is Fedor, so for the fanboys who think it will settle the p4p debate, you're sadly mistaken.     GSP could win by takedowns/lay and pray. A Silva can win by knocking GSP dead. It really doesn't matter one way or the other. Pound for pound  1 = Fedor.    E|`|lcRbG4Csaa	Silva for the same reason that GSP kicked BJ's @ss, Bj is a bad man but he just did not look comfortable, if GSP went up in weight I think Silva would have the same advantage of being the naturally heavier and stronger fighter, regardless of also being a bad mother f*cker.|`|job9o5ioaa	Ive been waiting for this fight FOR EVER and this will take place.    I did not like what Silva commented on BJ & GSP when was asked before their fight that, he doesn't see anything special about these fighters!!!  For one, you're talking about two freak of nature and second, he lost his cool and humbleness, what every one adores him for.    Not a biggy, but he shouldn't say that.    May be the hype is already ON! lol|`|925b7a5199b1427ca918a36c1cc68a1baa	I like GSP, but there is no way he will win.  He faces the same problem that Penn did.  He is just too small to fight Silva.  All Silva has to do is stay standing and he will win.  Silva has a big reach advantage too.|`|sLVGdCOTaa	Too much of a weight difference although Silva is WAAAAAAY overrated, He's got four losses to bums, and his division is horrible (not his fault) He's beaten two good fighters, Henderson and Franklin, when he did move up he took on the 26th ranked LH, Wow! what a challenge, Then the fiasco against Cote (who's beaten no-one by the way) I'm sick of hearing how he's the number 1 ranked guy-he's not, How is he  1 with 4 losses to nobodys??|`|kvWF1a2Yaa	id bet on GSP. hes a machine and should be the best P4P fighter in the world. gsp fights high caliber fighters every fight. while anderson hasnt fought to many top notch fighters other the hendo and franklin.|`|36u3Ml0kaa	I love GSP but he has never faced anyone like Anderson Silva.  He will after train harder then ever before and reach deep down into his heart to pull out a victory-which I believe he could do.  I mean Silva's not invincible abd i'm sure that Pierre will prove that.|`|Vrd8gB61aa	I dunno it would be close cause gsp has the karate back ground and throws the kicks not like most of them who train muay thai and throw the one and only kick.   But Anderson Silva also is very good on the ground, well so was BJ Penn    Its hard to decide cause I like them both and they are both good.  I think GSP will actually challenge Anderson Silva|`|AA11517536	GSP and Anderson Silva are two of my favorite UFC fighters, so that would be a tough fight to watch.
mMFJrPbvaa	Well first you want to walk away at least 200 ft from trails, campsites and water sources.  When you get to your spot clear away a small area of leaves or snow so you can see the dirt and then dig a hole (called a cathole) about 6 to 8 inches deep (about as deep as the blade of the trowel). When digging the hole make sure you keep the removed dirt nearby to fill in the hole, remember the trowel touches ONLY DIRT.  Then you do your business in the hole make sure all your paper goes IN the hole, you dont want Charmin flowers popping through the dirt. And then cover it up completely with the dirt.  Some say to poke a stick in the ground so it stands up near your cathole to warn others, I`ve never came across such a warning. But it doesn't hurt I guess.<br>  <br>  If you are in a well traveled part of the park and find a good spot I would suggest you keep moving, chances are someone probably already used that spot. I like to find a fallen tree or a rock that is about knee height off the ground so you have something to sit on and hang over, just remember to test it to make sure it can hold ur weight if u do that, otherwise it can snap or roll and you could end up in your hole.  Another method commonly used is to find a tree (not hard to do in the woods) and after you dig your hole about 3 feet or so from the base of the tree you hold onto the tree and lean out/squat over the hole so your arms would be directly out in front of u grabbing the tree, again use common sense and pick a tree that wont have a problem holding your weight.  <br>  <br>  As a side note be  sure to carry out any feminine hygiene products, wrap them in foil or plastic and then double bag it in a ziplock bag.  Do not bury them since they are not biodegradeable. <br>  <br>  Make sure you follow the Leave No Trace Principles, this one would fall under waste management.|`|h2KkiKK3aa	you dig a hole in the ground, do your business and cover it up, simple.|`|7royFhIgaa	You dig a small hole with it and do your business and than cover it up.|`|aJp3BbWcaa	During the day, find a discreet location at least 50 meters from any open water source to relieve you. Keep toilet paper usage to a minimum and burn all toilet paper with matches or butane lighter. Pull the toilet paper apart; a wad does not burn. Carrying a small bag to collect toilet paper to burn later in camp also works.|`|qyATAaeXaa	Building on Beach Bum's answer...<br>  <br>  It is OK to put toilet paper in the cathole, but consider two things.<br>  <br>  #1. Use only unscented, single ply TP when in the woods. This will help with decomposition.<br>  <br>  #2. Once the deed is done, stir up the TP with your poop. If your poop is compact, break it up in the cathole before you cover it with dirt. That's why you also stick the twig in the top of the cathole. To bury the poopy end of the stick.<br>  <br>  If you can pack out the used TP...more power to you. If it is mashed up with the poop, the cathole was deep enough, and you covered it up the right way animals won't dig it up.<br>  <br>  If you are above treeline or in tundra you have to pack out EVERYTHING, so poop in a ziploc! (Eventually that's going to be the LNT standard for all of the backcountry...I can see it going that way within the next 10 years. Start preparing now!)|`|3Twg9Uuuaa	Like said dig a hole awaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyy from anything you don't want contaminated do your dooty and cover it up. There's a good book on the subject no long story here needed<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/How-****-Woods-Environmentally-Approach/dp/0898156270" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/How-****-Woods-Env...</a>|`|lTeXIjpOaa	like everyone is saying dig a hole, go potty in the hole, then cover up the hole; do your business away from the trail/campsite|`|wgF54vGOaa	You don't need a trowel. Just use a stick. Dig down six inches. The first time, it might seem awkward, but then you'll realize that it's easier to do your business in a squatting position -- that's actually how our bodies are designed. You're supposed to mix some dirt in with it, but it's fine to just put dirt on top of it. Then make sure you warn others that you've left your business there by sticking a branch into the dirt, sticking straight up on top of the spot.<br>  <br>  Please PLEASE pack out your used toilet paper! Or burn it. It might seem gross, but burying it is NOT Leave No Trace. Animals tend to dig that stuff up. Which is why, too, I don't worry too much about burying it real deep -- the animals will pull it up anyway. Just keep your business away from campsites, established trails and water sources, and you'll be fine.
1e576939d9233965a515d8aaa9992a28aa	Wikipedia may not be the best source of information.  <br>  <br>  However, there may be some truth to that article.  Who's to say?  Between legend and the lack of historical record, it really is difficult to say who founded the Chinese martial arts.  <br>  <br>  (Kung Fu is a name the West has tagged the Chinese methods with for ease of reference.  "Kung Fu" actually means something like "accomplished" usually through time and effort.  It is only through the phrase's use in the West that it has come to reference Chinese martial arts.)   <br>  <br>  It is probably a sure bet it wasn't one person.  First of all, there is a diversity in styles and methods that is most likely a product of "cross training" which occurred back in the day and over time.  However, the idea that all of it was the "viral" result of the efforts of one person just doesn't seem likely.  Considering that methods of warfare have been a major part of every civilization.  <br>  <br>  Keep researching.  Keep learning.  Maybe you will find your own truth.|`|9AR6B4ELaa	go to china's shaolin temple and they'll tell you because they study about this kind of stuff|`|13360f8150c9715c66a1ecb9c2002c6aaa	BODIHARMA taught a series of excercises to the monks based on the movements of animals these were later incorporated into various fighting methods many of which already existed .<br>  <br>  There are more systems in china that do not trace back to the shaolin than ones that do but to claim your art comes from shao lin was then as now a good selling point.|`|sLUgjriLaa	it probably doesn't have a single founder. it probably was an evolution of different ways of fighting combined into one style.

If he will not accept the trade, add one piece, maybe a role player like Roger Mason Jr. or someone.
r5AMG8g7aa	I generally don't recommend styles. However, since you want to strengthen your upper body, I think you want to find a karate style. They have plenty of kicks, yet offer more hand techniques. You will get much more upper body work than in most TKD schools. Just be sure not to join any school that sells black belt contracts. Also avoid any place that promotes often. you are looking for a place that is more interested in teaching skills than in promoting students. <br>  <br>  The instructor is always the most important factor in your learning. Find the best instructor and you have found your style.<br>  <br>  Best of Luck!|`|LFLflsWFaa	You shouldn't limit yourself to two martial arts--unless you want to.<br>  <br>  Nowadays, it depends more on the instructor.

If you do TKD, you will have a total lack of hand use but with Karate, it has more hand use.|`|b9wICW1Paa	I feel both have value if you wish to experience Asian style martial arts.  My biggest problem with martial arts in general, and something you should consider, is the cost.  The monthly dues are likely to be very high, then there is the gi (uniform), sparring gear, testing fees, tournament fees, and the like that are all very expensive.  If you or your parents are prepared to shell out this sort of cash, then by all means proceed.  <br>  <br>  You should ask yourself why you want to join a martial arts club.  Self defense?  Fitness?  Because it looks cool?  You can always learn self defense techniques from other sources.  Local police departments often have free or very reasonably priced courses.  There are also a great deal of online resources for learning basic, effective self defense.  If you want greater fitness, then there are any number of sports activities you could become involved with at school or in the community.    <br>  <br>  It's great to have an interest in fitness and your own well being, and I am not trying to discourage you from engaging in what could be a very beneficial activity.  I trained in Shotokan Karate for 5 years and truly enjoyed and benefitted from the experience.  But realize that martial arts classes are very expensive and it requires years of practice and determination to develop competency in any of these arts.  Although you could say the same thing about any of life's skills, you will not leave your first tae kwon do or karate class with any reasonable self defense skills.  With a self defense course you will likely leave with at least the knowledge of what to do if you are attacked.|`|cc9fd1e80d4f3f3e0531c81601acf1d6aa	You want to strengthen your core muscles, and both sports would do just that. Taekwondo focuses on balance, leg muscles and lots of explosive power for kicking. Karate focuses more on the upper body, lots of punches, chops and whatnot. Kung Fu is totally different while some fundamentals might apply to it ( all the breathing etc. )<br>  Kung Fu is more about form and technique and you have the option of weapons. So if you are going to learn Kung Fu you should start with Kung Fu.

If Karo shows the old Karo, he can probably pull off a victory.|`|4gwSrPhfaa	if the old Karo comes back then i can seem him winning with a desicion or submission , however if the same Parisyan comes out as in the dong hyun kim Davis will knock him out or, get a ref stoppage due to strikes|`|TGCpExqYaa	I agree with ghost.

t5Nrj6Txaa	You've got some good answers here.  Ultimately, there are way too many variables here to make this a simple black and white assessment.  Basically, with the same powder load, a heavier larger shot will have greater penetrating power, whilst the bird shot will have more disruptive power.  How much energy the shot will get from the load also depends on barrel length.  For instance, your common .30-06 bullet weighs from 7.1 to 14.3g, comparable to a .40 S&W pistol bullet weighing from 9 to 13g.  The performance of these loads are vastly different, even if the bullet masses are similar.  <br>  <br>  Basically, the closer your target, you will want to move from a more penetrating load to a more disruptive load, if damage is your intent.  For example, at point blank range, a 30-06 will pass through the target, so you would need to hit something vital.  Meanwhile, at point blank range, buckshot will saw off your arm. <br>  <br>  Keep in mind that a pit bull/mastiff is a massive dog.  People investigating grizzlies that were shot at with a 9mm found that some of the rounds glanced off of the bears skull, while others were found in the chest, still not penetrating the ribs--which contained the guy who shot at him with the 9mm.<br>  <br>  If you are really interested in the numbers, check out the site below, which also makes the valid point that:<br>  <br>  "Many people load their shotguns with birdshot, usually #6 shot or smaller, to minimize interior wall penetration. Number 6 lead birdshot, when propelled at 1300 fps, has a maximum penetration depth potential of about 5 inches in standard ordnance gelatin. Not all of the pellets penetrate this deeply however; most of the shot will penetrate about 4 inches."|`|ryjnt3dhaa	I have used bird shot or rat shot to scare dogs out my yard because they had turned over the trash cans.  It stings their back sides real well but it doesn't do any real permanent damage.  You would think 00 buckshot would drop just about any dog.  I have killed a wild hog with #1 buck.  I think maybe the officer did not get a clean shot at the dog.  I can't see it surviving any other way.  00 buckshot is what I would recommend to put down any animal 250 pounds or less.|`|3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	A Pit Bull Mastiff is a Dog not a human being.* Number 4 bird shot will put down a threat by a human being in a home, no problem.* A Dog is a Dog, a person is a person, big difference.*|`|Vakup5Jvaa	Most home defense shots are from five to ten feet. At that range bird shot would tear an intruder apart, but would not carry through drywall as far once it opened up in pattern. It just does not have the inertia to get through as much wallboard as 00 buck.<br>  <br>  Also it is easier to defend in court that you had your skeet ammo in there as opposed to lying in wait with a shotgun full of the same ammo the police use to KILL people. Sad that you have to think that way ....but if the assailant dies you may be sued by the dirtballs relatives, because you know "he was a good boy" or that's what his mom will be crying on TV.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you are protecting an acre or two behind your house, by all means you should use 00 buck .....but otherwise I personally would stick to bird shot.<br>  <br>  Stay safe.|`|z0gdLgQ4aa	I have experience here: I've been shot.<br>  <br>  Birdshot is totally ineffective in a crisis situation. I've been shot at medium range by birdshot and only a few pellets penetrated the fall coat I was wearing. You must always use a round that will be fatal. There is no room to "wound" when your life is on the line.<br>  <br>  I know first hand that 00 buck is devestating against a human. A very close friend of mine had half of his head taken off by a load of 00 buck. A dog with a very hard skull, maybe not. (I believe that 00 would be totally effective here though)<br>  <br>  Note: 00 buck is the minimum buckshot load that I would recommend.<br>  <br>  I follow a police tactic: I load my 12 gauge with 3" magnums: 1st round 00 buck, second round slug, 3rd round 00 buck, etc. <br>  <br>  I also keep a .45 on my bedstand. That will drop any intruder cold, canine or human variety.|`|b4Y0gYlIaa	i would definitely go with buckshot in self defense. if you were to shoot a person with birdshot, say 7 1/2 or 8 load, it would most likely feel like his chest was on fire. but if ya want to stop someone in their tracks, i would go with buckshot. it wont kill em. my uncle's neighbor in louisiana had a logging business. someone kept stealing the deisel out of the tractors. he sat outside one night and waited for the guy to come back. he shot em once at the tractor, and shot em again in the back while he was running away. it didnt kill but it sure made go away. so in my opinion, i would go with buckshot. if its good enough to go deer hunting with, its good enough for self defense.|`|PxrJZMPaaa	screw buck shot, use a hollow point slug, or at least have the first round be shot and the second a slug.|`|YrxLbfiIaa	"It took a full load of 00 buck from a 12ga to the head at 10 feet"????<br>  <br>  And walked away?<br>  <br>  He must have missed or something?<br>  <br>  A load of buckshot into any dog, person, animal up to a few hundred pounds at close range is dead on the spot!!!!<br>  <br>  Bird-shot should be effective within a few feet - but more than say 20 to 30 feet away it lacks penetration and knockdown power.....<br>  <br>  2 3/4 inch 12 gauge 8 or 9 pellet buckshot is a perfect people or animal stopper up to 150 feet.....|`|mFa5ZDtcaa	Bird shot.<br>  <br>  Buckshot over penetrates way too much.<br>  <br>  I just watched a demonstration on a shooting program that tested buckshot, slugs and bird shot on interior and exterior walls.<br>  <br>  Both Buck and slug went through multiple walls and sidings.<br>  <br>  Bird shot did not but left an initial hole about 4" wide in drywall at 10'. Most did not penetrate the 2nd layer and none penetrated through an outside wall.<br>  <br>  That's a big hole in a bad guy.<br>  <br>  Put it this way, are you going to stand there and hold your ground while a guy is blasting at you with a 12 ga shotgun with #4-7 game load? <br>  <br>  If you do, you will die.
IJfUZeBUaa	I figured I'd wrap all your Calzaghe opponents into one answer if you you don't mind kind sir. The only fighter that you you mentioned on your list that Calzaghe would beat would be Pavlik, everyone else would beat and Archie along with Nigel would knock out Joe. Joe's out of his league when it comes to the fighters you had him matched up with. You're taking an okay fighter and putting him in there with some really good fighters and one great fighter (Moore). Who has Joe fought? A one armed Lacy? Kessler?A very old Hopkins? A old Jones? The jury's out and back in on Joe, feathered fist ed and very weak opposition is this mans undoing.|`|thcr8Y5vaa	Nigel Benn...|`|I1w0HfQbaa	Benn for the knockout in the fourth or the fifth round. There has been talk that Benn is "chinny" but I do not think it will be much of a factor in this fight. Calzaghe is a good fighter and, in my book, is a bona fide contender but he chin is suspect too and with Benn's wrecking balls this would make for an explosive mix. Calzaghe is too much of a slapper-type boxer who likes to build up a points lead over his opponents but against Benn he better be able to hurt Benn in order to get his attention. Does he have the arsenal necessary in order to get Benn's attention? No, he doesn't. <br>  <br>  For one thing, I do not think Benn has the suspect chin critics say he has. His knockout loss to Michael Watson was the result of him punching himself out in that fight and Michael waiting for the right moment to put him away. His only time he was knocked down with a good, clean shot was when he fought Doug DeWitt and was down in the second from a left hook. So Benn can take a punch but I am not so sure whether Calzaghe can take a Benn punch. Calzaghe was knocked down by a badly faded Jones Jr. and was knocked down by Bernard Hopkins. He decided to take a cautious approach against Hopkins after taking a taste of B-Hop's power and truth be told, I am not even sure whether he won that fight. We know all about Benn's heart and courage and determination and his threshold for punishment.<br>  <br>  If Benn decided to go slugger in this fight in terms of tactics and although it did not give him success in certain fights (vs. Chris Eubank 1st fight and vs. Michael Watson) I think it will give him a lot of success in this fight because I do not think Calzaghe can hurt Benn but I think Benn can hurt Calzaghe and hurt him badly.

82JPSNwpaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  Sprinters do not need upper body strength to improve performance, how much of the running do you do on your arms?<br>  <br>  For sprinting you need to build muscle while maximizing the power output. Many sprinters have a low body fat content because the excess fat is just unnecessary weight. Any muscle gain must improve performance, theres no point gaining a 1kg of muscle mass and performance time staying the same or becoming slower.<br>  <br>  There is also more to sprinting than just gaining muscle mass.<br>  <br>  Work on your acceleration, the time it takes for you to get to your maximum speed, the quicker your acceleration is the faster your time will be. Reaction times are also important, how quickly are you responding to the start and then moving away. This might seem slightly insignificant but when you consider sprinting last only seconds those fractions of a second begin to add up.|`|isf5gDbmaa	Sprinters need to have a good upper body strength. <br>  UPPER BODY: <br>  Shoulder<br>  Arms ( biceps and triceps)<br>  Back<br>  Abs (upper,middle,lower)<br>  LOWER BODY<br>  everything from waist and below<br>  Legs ( Calves and thighs) ( upper, lower)<br>  butt muscles<br>  Go to a gym, and ask for help on exercises for the once that i listed above, I don't know what condition in, so i can't really tell you exercises, because i don't want you to get hurt.That's why you need to go to a gym, so you have supervision, and help.

Also, the ability to easily request autographs from and take pictures with star players that don't visit your home stadium often.<br>  <br>  The night life is also excellent because you get to experience seeing your favorite players just being themselves outside of the ballpark enjoying dinner, at the club, shopping and sightseeing.|`|4SKmjYrsaa	for one, it's the day games!!! i am a Braves fan so i dont get to see many day games, I also love the accesability of the players! you can shake hands and meet your favorite players!

2baYnAokaa	I know 77 yr olds who have been doing MA since 4yrs old and many who have actually improved with training but it depends on the art and who you train with.

I have been to some where nobody has any injuries but for a few bruise.  my experience has been no,|`|ceiaGsLdaa	No.|`|Vrd8gB61aa	no<br>  as long as you are doing proper streching and warm ups<br>  which a lot of places do incorrect stretching. esp with the neck(in circles), and will cause damage later in life|`|YDpT2ClBaa	i have the opposite, martial arts has helped my sciatic nerve. i havent had that bather me in over 25 yrs|`|r5AMG8g7aa	Martial arts training has helped my back problems. I have two wedged disc in my lower back. They tend to pinch the nerves. I find that training usually helps as long as I stay away from doing throws. I still teach them, but don't do them or break falls any more.  My doctors told me to quit the martial arts when I was 35 years old. I'm 55 now and still training. for a while I tried not to train. It made my pain worse. Personally I believe in training for these types of problems as long as you are careful and know your limits.|`|dd7de1dd375fcb6afffc282f17c117c6aa	no; but all martial artists who stay in it long enough will suffer from some kind of long term injury including mental disability. hahahaha.|`|v1mbL56caa	No.<br>  Not if done properly.|`|w02Z4Mnhaa	I wouldn't say so, no.

He just seems like a cool guy with the ability to laugh at himself.|`|rFUqIakAaa	Really? I never noticed that before. Anytime I see him in an interview it's always in a press conference and to be honest he comes off as a rather nice guy with good sportsmanship. He tells jokes sometimes about other players (like Djokovic) but usually it's just in good fun. And he always praises his opponents, especially Roger and Rafa so I don't really seem him as cocky. I do think he has a bit of an attitude problem on court sometimes when he yells at the chair umpires, but frankly a lot of other players do that too.|`|VefSnu0Gaa	whatttt??? <br>  this question is ridiculous, hehe.-<br>  are you sure you got the right guy?? <br>  andy is not a show off, this interviews that you're refering to, i've never seen them, but anyway, unless they were for mtv cribs the point of them wasn't to show his properties, it's show him, so this things are merely backgrounds.-<br>  oh, and andy doesn't have a private jet.-|`|AA12034105	Andy Roddick rocks !!

In cricket they are ascendent. In economic, political, military and academic terms it is certainly a fast-rising power too.However, overall, I'm not to happy that India is STILL immitative of the west. The irony is that many of those western nations are looking at India with admiration - fascinated by Indian culture. India should adopt good things from the west which will be to India's benefit (political accountability, for example). But do not sacrifice the essential elements of Indian culture to immitate a waning west. History is coming full circle and the balance of global power is shifting once again to the two nations that dominated it for most of civilized human existence - India and China! What a pity if these two nations recover their global supremacy with an identity that is Asian in ethnicity but western in culture!!!|`|HTiczN3Xaa	Seeing as this is a public forum, I will refrain from posting what usually comes to my mind when I think of india.<br>  <br>  However, what I do know is that on the United Nations Human Development Index, india ranks 132nd, behind other "world leaders" such as Algeria (100th), Mongolia (112th), Uzbekistan (119th), and Bhutan (131st)<br>  <br>  Australia ranks 4th.<br>  <br>  Edit - why are the indian teenagers getting all upset?

I don't know him as a person or much more than an overpaid, overgrown, cry-baby with a bad attitude. I was impressed with his talent and his ability to hit the ball. No one had as much power to all fields. He could take a high and inside pitch and lauch it into the bay every time. But you can't ignore all the drama that surrounded his career. He is obviously a tough guy to like. Most of his teammates didn't care for him and it was evident every game. He always sat at the end of the dugout by himself. He seems arrogant and that the game owes him something. But he was caught red-handed and needs to fess up. Personally, I don't think he ever will and will probably become a bitter old man over the years. It is a same, becuase he had the talent to be just as great without the juice.|`|T0Zx0kx9aa	If he were playing this upcoming season I would definitely watch.<br>  As a baseball player, he is the best hitter I have ever seen.

As for his talent, I cannot say he was a great player because with all the evidence that shows he juiced how do I know what his real talent was. If he cheated and took the juice we will never know how good he really was, just what we saw was a juiced Barry. I don't like the fact that he most likely cheated and did not fess up to it. If it is proved he did not cheat, then he really was a great player. As far as his attitude, again I can only go by what his teammates sad and how he acted when I saw him on TV. He seemed to be a loaner and not much of a "team" type of guy. Maybe he was shy or maybe he was a jerk to everyone and thought he was better than everyone else. I just hope that if it is finally proved that he juiced, his records be erased and he be denied the hall just like Pete Rose.|`|obPSaYf3aa	Since public opinion is not a serious forum because at least 99% of the US population do not know him personally, I don't care what people that never met him think. They can believe everything the media says, if they want, because it's mostly hearsay and evidence is circumstantial. The media has something against Barry just because he does not grant an "easy" interview or photo op. Then when the steroids/PED allegations came up, they started making stories up about how he is a "junkie" or "abuser", which is false because he's not dead or crippled.<br>  <br>  I met him in our neighborhood (San Mateo/Foster City, CA) where he also grew up and went to HS, at my place of employment (EA Sports), as an invited guest of his All Star Game afterparty and SF Giants community events, as well as an occasional visitor to the SF Giants locker room as a corporate perk. He will shake your hand, take time to chat, will sign autographs, joke around and does not walk around like he's above God. The media does not want the public to know that! <br>  <br>  Anyways, he does not have a "nice" clause in any of his contracts so he's free to act any way he wants to..... He does not have to grant every or any interview or photo op request from the media.  With only speculation, hearsay and circumstantial evidence, he may get a guilty verdict on maybe one count, but for the others, either innocent or just plain acquitted.<br>  <br>  I believe that he did take PED's when prescribed by his doctor when injured and he did "use" in a recreational manner, but there is nothing that should warrant throwing empty syringe needles at him, calling him childish names or threatening him for so-called "destroying" baseball, because there were a few names of "users" that surfaced way before his made the news.|`|tvuhGTD9aa	Never met him, don't know him.<br>  <br>  But he was an astoundingly entertaining ballplayer to watch, especially when he was batting.|`|1CgCx1E2aa	no I hate him he's an idiot beyond for just using steroids

The current top 4~5 heavyweights have not fought each other nor does any of them intend to do so and unify the division in the foreseeable future. The lower weight divisions ALWAYS had better talent than the heavyweight division, this holds true for any decade of the 20th century.

A couple of Russian brothers seem to be leading the pack. A far cry from the days when Mike Tyson raised hell, and lit the division up like bonfire night!<br>  <br>   The middleweight division (And there abouts), have produced an era of exciting fighters. Mayweather, Hatton, Pacman, B-Hop, Pavlik Kelly to name but a few...<br>  <br>   Punters go for the excitement, they want to be entertained, they need the buzz..<br>  <br>   In all honesty, you won't get the rush watching today's heavyweights.|`|Ghiy6Cwlaa	we talk about every weight class we answer the best we can at all questions that come around right now it middleweight when you are here awile you will see we get alot of heayweight questions to i hope to see you in here alot more and ask moore questions and help us answer them to|`|VRnJ6aqBaa	well wlad has no competition to name unlike floyd. floyd fought hatton and could fight manny pac, but wlad has no body to fight that the public is really wanting to see|`|qkCFLgaSaa	klitschko rules the heavy weight class i love watching him fight... i agree i hate mayweather, klitschko would beat that guy down!

I though that Tracy Mccgrady would be traded for baron davis nut it didnt happen. I also thought the cavs were goin to trade Wally somewhere and trade someone for Jamison. The thing that stinks the most was the Celtics traded Sam Cassell and O'Bryant 4 no players for the rest of the 08-09 season. Maybe no one made trades to make rooms for the crazy 2010 Free angency.The only good trade was for Orlando to get Rafer Alston. But to sum it up, the deadline STUNK.|`|TJMpKqFNaa	Mostly a bunch of salary dumping by bad teams to really bad teams.  No contending teams really got any superstars or anything like that so it wasn't all that exciting to me.  <br>  <br>  I do like what the Bulls did if I have to name one team.  Getting Salmons from Sacramento was a steal - he's a highly underrated player from what I've seen.  Getting rid of Hughes was also probably a good idea - he's a good player when healthy and happy....which isn't very often....otherwise he's highly overpaid.|`|lbL9wQZJaa	They were crazy.

Rafer is a good player, but he doesn't fit well in Adelman's system, so I glad to see him get a chance with a coach that wants him in the rotation.<br>  <br>  Lowry was the guy the Rockets really wanted when they made the trade for Battier, so unless they are completely wrong about his talent, they did well in the deal too.|`|QIlhmWwBaa	the only team that helped them selves was the magic but besides them there really wasn't any late trades that are going to have much of an impact|`|DnWsMhwLaa	i'm glad the magic got alston, it would be a shame for their breakout season to derail from 1 injury.|`|Kwywmcs8aa	Not very exciting. <br>  <br>  At least the Warriors didn't give up any of their young talent.

Ell00iyqaa	Despite the obviously popular opinion, the old showtime Lakers of Magic, Worthy, Kareem, Byron Scott, Michael Cooper, Jamaal Wilkes, and Kurt Rambis were not defense oriented.  <br>  <br>  Cooper was a lockdown individual defender, Worthy and Scott were good enough athletes to stay with their opponents, Kareem could rotate and block shots, Rambis was a psycho in the paint, and of course no point guards dared take Magic into the post.  <br>  <br>  But, Worthy was regularly overpowered by bigger power forwards, as was Wilkes against physical small forwards.  Kareem couldn't guard big men who could handle the ball, nor could Rambis, or Mitch Kupchak, or later Michael Thompson and Bob McAdoo. Magic was too slow to keep up with quick-footed point guards, and although Cooper was a defensive ace, he could be had in the low post by stronger players.  <br>  <br>  This team was clearly a championship team because they were simply an offensive juggernaut.  Defense was not their main priority.  Out-running and out-scoring their opponent was.|`|hmrqHVtPaa	The Heat only won the NBA finals cause the refs kept calling every cheap foul every time Wade attempted to drive to the basket, Mavs played no D on him cause they didn't want to get into foul trouble.<br>  <br>  Come on now the 90's was all about Hakeem and Jordan, this era was all about defense, just look at the Utah Jazz as another example<br>  <br>  As for the question the closest offensive minded teams that have come to a championship were the Kings in 2002 and the Suns between 2005 and 2007, you could throw in the 2006 Mavs in that list, but Avery Johnson preached defense, which is why they made a deeper run in this season then they did with Don Nelson.  Out of the 3, 2 have made the conference finals, and the other was at the NBA finals.  Closest offensive minded teams to win a championship, and the Heat did lean more towards offense, that was due to the combination of Shaq, Wade, and the refs, similar to how the Shaq/Kobe duo did it, they also had help to beat the Kings, except the laker team then was also good at defense like the Jordan led Bulls. <br>  Shaq sure is babied by the NBA.|`|5FypDafWaa	No but they always say defense wins championships|`|6NVHuQAWaa	Lakers aren't defense oriented.<br>  <br>  90's are limited to Bulls Spurs Rockets Lakers and Pistons|`|ISQAWUf2aa	Lakers a defenseive team???<br>  <br>  They are all on offense.|`|GswnLKtQaa	I don't know I can't remember any past champions that were not known for defence, maybe the Showtime Lakers during the 80's but then again they were also a good defensive team.<br>  <br>  it's a fact defence wins championship.<br>  <br>  EDIT: to Rockets FTW , 2006 Miami Heat isn't defensive?<br>  Shaq, Mourning, Payton, Wade, Posey? 2006 heat team were a good defensive team.|`|Kwywmcs8aa	Lakers aren't defense oriented.<br>  <br>  90's are limited to Bulls Spurs Rockets Lakers and Pistons

EuGsGfuJaa	You can, though you'd either have to kick somebody really hard in their spine or inflict a severe enough head injury to cause a cerebral edema (brain swell).  In both cases, the paralysis would be long term or potentially permanent or fatal (lungs and organs can be paralyzed too).  This largely makes it impractical for self-defense, as it not only requires a great deal of force, but the person would have to be down already or have their back turned to you.<br>  <br>  Their are certain pressure points that will cause short term numbness/paresthesia in a limb (such as the so called "funny bone" point at the elbow) but no way to cause full body paralysis.<br>  <br>  Causing a knock-out is another matter, and going into that subject would be much to lengthy even for a book.|`|YDpT2ClBaa	paralyzing a person is permanent, and there are usually legal consequence afterward, as for using pressure points to cause them pain knocking them out, you should not rely solely on that for self defense.<br>  you should not limit yourself to only a few techniques, that may or may not work on every situation.|`|gBO908P6aa	There isn't enough convincing evidence other than anecdotal and borderline fiction concerning "paralyzing" someone entirely using just your bare hands.  Based on that, you can also imagine the impracticality of such a thing in something like self-defense, where simplicity and proven techniques are of the essence.  If you want to talk about "paralyzing" in the loose sense of the word, like dropping someone with a punch to the stomach like you would in boxing, then yes of course.|`|ieUgty5Faa	Like glistam said, if you hit someone in the head to cause brain damage or in their spine hard enough, I guess you could literally paralyze someone, but the self-defense applications and legal implications of that kind of technique are shady, at best.<br>  <br>  The only other way that I could think of to "paralyze" someone would be a liver shot. Getting hit in the liver will drop someone instantly and put them in a world of pain. More than enough to neutralize the threat and escape, or leave an opening for any finishing move.|`|13360f8150c9715c66a1ecb9c2002c6aaa	Here is a test for you .Have a freind get an old long sleeved shirt upon which you will mark all the pressure points in the body front and back and on the arms .Then have him put on a jacket so you can't see them.Have him move around while you try and touch not strike these points as you don't want to hurt your freind.Then have your freind not only move around but covering and blocking and trying to touch you back around the head area.Knowing where these points are and striking them are 2 different things.There are only 7 out of a possible 108 that are visiable at all times and even those are hard to hit when the other guy is trying to beat you to a pulp .<br>  <br>  Plus what shihan j said.|`|KkkugCJ0aa	certain judo throws can cause paralysis such as uchi mata<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYq-_0EQUS4" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYq-_0EQU...</a><br>  also chokes can cause paralysis or death if you hold them long enough<br>  the twister can snap the c spine like a toothpick<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCCLw_luslE&feature=channel" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCCLw_lus...</a>|`|w02Z4Mnhaa	Technically yes, but it's use in self defence would be extremely suspect.<br>  <br>  1. It would require premeditation to do - not something you can use to justify self defence<br>  2. It can happen 'accidentally', but would require more force than is necessary to end most self defence situations.<br>  3. It is virtually unjustifiable in a court of law to plead self defence if you deliberately paralysed somebody.  You'd have more chance of justification if you killed somebody who was trying to kill you or a loved one.

xhPKkkELaa	Welcome to surfing. This question has been asked enough times before, but there is really only one true answer.<br>  <br>  Lessons are the only sensible way to start surfing, either from a professional instructor, or surfing family or friends who are experienced surfers. Having "surfed" once before is nice, but it really doesn't count. There are way too many dangerous people in the water now, who THINK they can surf. Please don't join their ranks.The VERY LAST THING the rest of us experienced surfers want is people to take silly on-line advice, and go down to the beach, grab a surfboard, and go out and get in our way.<br>  <br>  Most people start out best on long boards, but I have seen plenty of surfers start begin with a short board and master it in no time. It just tends to be more difficult. The bottom line is there are NO RULES as to what kind of surfboard you learn on. Certainly a longboard usually is more user friendly.<br>  <br>  Most professional instructors will rent you a board to learn on. Beginners shouldn't even think about buying a board until they master the basics, and decide they really want to keep on surfing.<br>  <br>  This question comes up a lot on YA Surfing, and it is impossible to answer it accurately on-line. Although I am sure you will get lots of "advice" the real BEST ANSWER is to go to a good local surf shop and discuss your skill level, your size and local wave conditions with the folks there. they will give you much better info than ANYBODY out here in cyberspace. When you are finally ready, you should really think about buying a decent board, and avoiding popouts , and boards made in sweat shops in China, unless that's just all you can afford. And don't forget, there are always used boards for sale in every surf shop. After 42 years of surfing, I still get my surfboard buying advice at good local shops in the places where I surf.<br>  <br>  And, I know there are lots of nice kids who want to share information with you on line. But don't take the advice from youngsters, who may know even less than you do about surfing, a surfboard is a big investment. At 15, you should be mature enough to read through the BS that lots of people throw at you on line.<br>  <br>  Anybody, on-line, who gives specific advice on what size board someone should buy is foolish. Anyone who takes that advice is more foolish.Good luck! <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.avalonsurfschool.com/index.ht..." rel="nofollow">http://www.avalonsurfschool.com/index.ht...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.mckevlins.com/nopopstory.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.mckevlins.com/nopopstory.htm</a><br>  Boards made in far eastern sweats shops:<br>  <a href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hPACOtZKKko/RkSTwhvv9kI/AAAAAAAAAfg/QMqBFAtXzQ4/s1600-h/chinaboards.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://bp3.blogger.com/_hPACOtZKKko/RkST...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.surfing-waves.com/beginner_su..." rel="nofollow">http://www.surfing-waves.com/beginner_su...</a>
BpY2ed0Gaa	There's nothing specifically prohibiting the manufacture of airsoft guns, wha IS illegal is the manufactire of realisitic imitation firearms (note: it doesn't have to be an imitation of a real firearm to be realistic, it just has to look like a gun). Anyone cal legally manufacture airsoft guns which are unrealistic imitations (usually be being at least 50% brighyly coloured...)<br>  <br>  Providing the manufacturer can avail of one of the defences or exemptions to the Violent Crimes Reduction Act (being a legitimate skirmisher, a registered re-enactor, a filmmaker or museum) they can legally manufacture realistic imitations.

John Carpenter's Halloween., Night of the living dead, Dawn of the dead, Day of the dead, Return of the living dead. Return of the living dead, has a entire soundtrack, of songs to pick from.

sqfjfR3iaa	Shelton Benjamin was an NCAA wrestling Champion at the University of Minnesota. He is badly underused by World wrestling entertainment. I would like to see him go to Ring of Honor and really show the wrestling holds, wrestling moves and talent that he has. WWE hems and haws when it comes to using him. I think he is vastly underrated and underutilized. R-Truth is a 2-Time Fomer NWA World Heavyweight Champion and WWE does not really utilize his talents either. Shelton benjamin has had about 5 different characters in the WWE, R-Truth has had at least 2. Remember he was K-Kwick when he was in the WWF/WWE before he went to TNA.

You've been hopeless, completely off form.' <br>  <br>  'Sorry, boss', says David. 'I've not been myself lately. I've got a few problems at home.' <br>  <br>  'Oh dear,' says Ferguson, pretending to care. 'What's up? Posh and Brooklyn okay?' <br>  <br>  'Oh they're fine', says David. 'It's just that something's really bugging me and I'm losing sleep and everything. I can't concentrate on my football and it's really messing me up.' <br>  <br>  'Whatever's the matter, David?' says Fergie. <br>  <br>  'Well, boss', says David, it's pretty serious. You see I'm really stuck on this jigsaw and...' <br>  <br>  'A jigsaw?!!!' shouts Alex. 'You're f......g up every time you play because of a bloody jigsaw?!!!' <br>  <br>  'Yeah, boss, but you don't understand, it's really doing myhead in!' says David in that horrible whining voice. 'It's really hard and it's this picture of a tiger and it looks really good on the box and I'm sure I've got all the bits and everything but I just can't get it right and it's doing my head in and I even had my hair cut to try and cool my brain down and...' <br>  <br>  'David, David, David,' says Ferguson. 'You've got to get a grip. It's affecting our games and nothing is as important as Manchester Uniteds' success, other than Roy Keane's wages, obviously.' <br>  <br>  'Yeah, boss,' says David, 'but it's this picture of a tiger and it looks really good on the box and I really want to finish it but it's really hard and it's doing my head in and it's this picture..and it's a tiger and it's hard...and I can't make the bits fit and, er, it's really hard, er, boss and, er, it's a tiger, er,... on the box...er...boss.' <br>  <br>  Ferguson waits until even Beckham realises he's repeating himself and has got nothing else to say which took a bit longer than usual. 'David,' he says, with that conceited, irritating, smug smile he uses for self-congratulatory post-match interviews. 'Bring the tiger jigsaw in and let's have a look at it. For Christ's sake, we've got to get you back to playing football.' <br>  <br>  'Oh thanks, boss,' says David, 'that'd be really helpful 'cos it's really hard and it's a picture of a tiger and it's doing my head in, that tiger is.' <br>  <br>  So David brings the jigsaw into Ferguson's office.<br>  <br>  'Here it is, boss.' He says, showing Ferguson the picture on the box. 'Look, boss, it's this tiger, right, and it's a really good picture and everything but I just can't do it and it's really hard and it's doing my head in and it's this picture here of a tiger,' and Beckham empties all the pieces from the box all over Ferguson's desk. <br>  <br>  'David,' sighs Ferguson, 'put the f*...g Frosties back in the box.|`|c4GykfVkaa	Bernie and Eddie were fortunate enough to have a season ticket to watch Manchester United.

If you have a local sporting goods store go there and find out were the best spots are.  Drive through the back roads and look for lakes with people on them and you have a fishing hole.

5RZ5tfRYaa	Adjustable sights are for serious competition shooters. On a Glock 19 (compact 9mm), the best sight swap is going to be from regular to night sights -- so you can acquire a quicker sight picture in low light conditions. Here is a link to hundreds of different night sight combinations and brands, starting in the lower double digit prices and running up into the triple digits:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.topglock.com/category/1663-Glock_Sights.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.topglock.com/category/1663-Gl...</a><br>  <br>  If you insist on adjustable sights, I would still get them as night sights. Here's an example for $139.99<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.midwayusa.com/eproductpage.exe/showproduct?saleitemid=541521" rel="nofollow">http://www.midwayusa.com/eproductpage.ex...</a><br>  <br>  Removing the old sights can sometimes be a pain, but generally it's just a matter of sliding them off and sliding the new ones on. You'll want to wrap the sights in a bit of tape and use a rubber mallet to tap them sideways off/on the slide. Can be a 5-minute job.

He watches and studies older games and players, as well as rules and regulations, and therefore his suggestions are well informed and should be taken into serious consideration. <br>  The dunk contest have lost its sizzle as of lately, and nothing will restore its luster than a set of regulations that encourages talented stars like LeBron, Kobe, Wade and others to participate.|`|QIlhmWwBaa	yes i think he should do it <br>  it would be even better if it was something like LeBron against Wade or Kobe|`|kjJkQpzPaa	yeah|`|4uW1QdMpaa	By views, i think he means that LeBron said he wants them to take it back to the days of Jordan and Dominique Wilkins... where players are only allowed 1-2 attempts per dunk so people arent getting 8-10 attempts at a dunk bcuz by the time they make it.. people know exactly what is coming and it takes away from the flare..<br>  <br>  He also said he could probably get some big name guys to participate with him<br>  <br>  i would love to see a LBJ, Wade, and Kobe,and Nate Robinson(bcuz he is the defending champ) compete next year|`|E1qOtwZ3aa	LeBron said during this past Dunk Contest that he will be in next years Dunk Contest and i would love to see him play!!!!!<br>  that will be good....Nate(2-time champ) vs.King LeBron James!!!!<br>  WHO WILL WIN????<br>  ONLY TIME WILL TELL.....|`|fc2LcdvVaa	By views do you mean him participating? then yes I would love to see Lebron in the dunk contest next year.|`|RLoilwCNaa	LeBron's dunks have been known to make small children cry.

What I'm saying is, unless he would get a lot of ￡$￡$ out of it from Publicity and stuff, why use the best of WM against some guy, when he could be having career threatening matches against someone in your promotion? Just seems a little far fetched!|`|UbUSth5haa	Vince would do it for sure.|`|GkFlzMHMaa	Only on your PlayStation will it happen..|`|Q1MI6L96aa	Vince would probably tell him, "You are right about asking, since TNA will be out of business and I'll have your contract...again."|`|OfNTLq3Qaa	Bottom line is Vince would make millions.<br>  <br>  As long as Vince understood that Sting would not job to Taker.

nxymxSUFaa	I could ramble on about this list for hours.  The long and short of it is this, Vin Scully is the greatest baseball play by play announcer who has yet lived.  Mel Allen is a very close second, very close!  Joe Buck has no business on this list.  For Pete sakes his father Jack isn't even listed and he was the voice of the Cardinals for decades.  A great play by play man.<br>  <br>  I remember Howard Cosell as a youngster who worked for WABC in New York at the time.  He had a nation wide radio show titled, "Speaking of Sports".  It was an up to date format of all the current happening throughout the world of sports.  It was also a self promoting vehicle.  Howard had big plans for himself and his show was the stepping stone for future endeavors.  Ali and Ali alone made Cosell a household name.<br>  <br>  The only truly great announcers on this list besides Vin Scully are:<br>  Al Michaels<br>  Dick Enberg <br>  Brent Musburger<br>  Curt Gowdy<br>  Keith Jackson<br>  Jim McKay<br>  Marv Albert<br>  Jack Whitaker<br>  Chris Schenkel<br>  Ray Scott<br>  Linsey Nelson<br>  Dick Stockton<br>  <br>  As far as Joe Morgan and Billy Packer are concerned, they are both frauds.  The worse kind of announcers.  Both self serving and unprepared.<br>  <br>  Besides Jack Buck not being on this list the likes of the great Ernie Harwell, Harry Kalas, as well as Bob Prince are absent.  What could Yahoo have been thinking?<br>  <br>  The rest of the list is filled by those who have yet to separate themselves from the pack.  Maybe in years to come some might actually be able to do that.<br>  <br>  Obviously it's only someones opinion but it's a bad one nevertheless.  Ain't sports great?  lol|`|2wgEsVmsaa	It's a totally subjective list. I agree that JOE Buck doesn't even belong on it, but Vin Scully is not Jesus. He is overrated because he's been around forever. Having Cosell at the top is the right call.|`|6tGYe5roaa	Forget about the people he was ahead of. The fact that he is even on the list at all is ridiculous. But this list was from Yahoo. We have been on Answers long enough to know that anything that has to do with Yahoo is stupid.|`|yk4S7uuraa	The way I see it is that he might be good "under the desk."<br>  <br>  ...and Lindsey Nelson #40, how the hell are Joe Morgan and Phyllis George ahead of him?|`|63e6fbd5b85357a27d660c7d5c0b9ee9aa	Joe in the Top  15 <br>  and the Gumballs in the top 26 Joe MOrgan<br>  they are so boring they put me to sleep<br>  Wheres Harry<br>  Wheres the Uke|`|gMTatFZBaa	John Madden number 2? He shouldn't even be in the top 50.Yes, this is quite a joke. Scully should be in the top three at the minimum.|`|eac78f41a64d286478c23785cf30be23aa	Just goes to show you that Football still dominates the "Hype" game...<br>  <br>  I've got three problems with the list.  First is all the "coat tail" guys....I mean, without Cosell would there even BE a Gifford or Meredith.  And without father Jack, would Joe even be in th booth, let alone "the list?"<br>  <br>  Second, I don't like seeing ESPN guys on this list....Berman isn't an "announcer" he's a "performer."  I consider Dan Patrick and MIke Tirico "hosts" and "journalists" than I do "broadcasters."<br>  <br>  Which brings me to my last complaint...It seems the line between "host," and "announcer" has been seriously blurred.  I use this simple test:  Imagine if you went blind today.  You would never again see, in person, your beloved sport...whatever it be...Who, on that list would you want to be the one describing it?  Who could go beyond analysis and actually paint a picture of the action....rather than just coming up with hyped catchphrases and witty commentary?<br>  <br>  To me, that would be Scully...|`|RKMWeMk9aa	I agree with you on Buck, but I'm surprised Jim Kaat is not on that list.|`|ZVSZZ6qHaa	Lot of people on that list that make you put the mute on your TV.  Ray Scott brings back memories from my youth.  He did all the Packer games back in the sixties when they were the champs every year.  I always liked Tony Kubek also, another Wisconsin boy.  Howard Cosell was terrible as are Madden and Musburger.  Make your own list and go with that.|`|ndopqX6Taa	You actually looked at a list compiled by Yahoo!<br>  <br>  You only have yourself to blame.|`|BD7yd8D4aa	I can't believe it but I am in complete agreement with Slappy La Rue on this one.<br>  <br>  Why so much haterade for Buck on the east coast?|`|118bb66e8faa1eb9da0eb3542d3702d6aa	What's even more messed up is that John Madden is #2!  He is and always has been awful.<br>  But I agree with you, I can't stand Joe Buck either.|`|1uSoU8Lpaa	And this is the guy who said he'd rather watch "Bachelorette" than a game. I can't explain it, maybe he paid off the voters.|`|5MtNumoSaa	I think the key part of the phrase may be "network announcers". While Scully and Mel Allen were certainly deserving of being up there, as well as many of the other names presented by other folks, Scully and Allen were more local guys for one team then they ever were network guys. Yes, you did hear them on occasion on national TV, but most of their careers were spent doing play by play for a particular team, as opposed to a national broadcast.<br>  Might be comparable to someone trying to say that Babe Ruth was the greatest Braves player of all time. Certain one of the all time greatest (or THE greatest), but not known for his time with the Braves.<br>  <br>  To me the biggest joke is Madden being #2. Only ever did one sport, and while he's entertaining, he has never been more than an analyst.|`|tG5Ar7DIaa	Three problems with that list.  First, why is Dick Vitale in the top 15?  I know how much he did for college basketball, but I think he shouldn't be in the top 15.  Secondly, Chris Berman is number 18.  Put him back, back, back, back, gone.  (Wow, that was lame).  Third, Tim McCarver and Jon Miller are top-25.  Why the hell are they top 25?  Fourthly (Yes, I know I said three things but I noticed more), Joe Buck should not be top 50. <br>  <br>  So yeah, those are my problems with that list.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Oh, and Joe Morgan is number 28.  He shouldn't be on there.|`|AQmcZ0gYaa	He's where he is because of daddy!!!!|`|DkwgogXZaa	wow...Chick Hearn---the man who invented the term "slam dunk" isn't in the top 50...what a terrible list...|`|c6q3EERdaa	I hope they meant Jack Buck instead of Joe, because Joe Buck is one of the worst all-time! Jack, however, was a great announcer ("I don't believe what I just saw"... "Go crazy folks, go crazy!").|`|RJghPceKaa	not sure, joe buck is not better than vin scully, but why does everyone like scully so much? he is so boring, not as much as joe buck but still. is it just because hes been around for a while?|`|V6XVLbaGaa	I liked you until you called our beloved Joe Buck a "loser"<br>  <br>  BLOCK<br>  <br>  (kidding, but I do like Joe Buck's style and I know I'm not alone)|`|AA10554783	Politics!

Just an opinion as always.|`|U3ZBUOWaaa	I guess watching him in Loudon last year coming in 5th and cheering for him when everyone around me was cheering for Kurt Busch who won that rained out race.  Poor Elliot wasn;'t in the top 10 much last year and rarely in the top 5 so that made it pretty special.  It was a fun time.|`|tUrrwplgaa	His win at Texas, the nasty flip at Dega, the commercial with the Tylenol "Rapid release", he said "Rabbit release"!!|`|9f0d54c35894f05249bcafb57c720e4baa	.... I'll predict that my favorite moment will be when he is in victory lane this weekend !!!!!!!!!!!!|`|5LxpvXSmaa	to show that he is crazy i will always remember him on Trackside Live and diving into the crowd at the spur of the moment the crowd did not expect it and he just fell off the stage and that was the end of the show. You saw Larry Mac and Jeff and Steve get up and go after him in the closing shot but that was it. I was so upset because thought he had gotten hurt but he qualified and raced that weekend. it may not qualify for my most favorite moment but it is my most memorable.|`|595902780e2c09920890743b229c9c08aa	The year escapes my mind this morning, but he was having a horrible year and had flipped his car a number of times during the year and after flipping again at Dega, in his interview he said that his team needed to stick some decals on the underside of the car because it was getting more TV time than being on the ground right-side up. Classic.|`|sXMrY3uwaa	I was @ Talladega for both of his rollovers. I know they aren't Elliotts favorite moments, but they are mine. His first one on the backstretch we didn't get to see except for on the jumbo tv in the infield.. but the one on the last lap going across the finish line.. MAN, that was awesome.

6abd3bdb56caa5b55d37adf04ec88a38aa	Well, my mom had me into music at a young age but, I wanted to play soccer which I did for 3yrs as a fullback. Then When I hit my sophmore year in H.S. I tried out for a couple of sports and was surprised to make the team. Basketball for one, I'm short but, I managed to make the team though I decided to quit after half a season due to my education was more important than sports at the time. Then I tried out for softball on a whim and made it for left outfield but, declined that one as at that time my drivers license was more important. Funny, how some things you don't think you have a chance of making a team and low and behold you get the news you made it. So, that in itself is my fondest memory. Thanks for allowing me to share. Back then you got trophy's no matter what for participating. Which is nice for little kids. Now everything is so intense it's not so fun anymore. Take care

0Dm3WEMcaa	No because that's how the next icon is made, you have to realize that the icon losing makes a future for the company yes some of the choices are bad, The Undertaker jobbed to The Great Khali for explain of a bad choice but if Khali had any skills he would look like a bigger contender for beating someone like The Undertaker. WCW didn't have icon's lose to younger stars and look how that worked out in the long run, yes sometimes it's a bad choice of who beats an icon but it needs to happen if the company is going to grow if not they become a over 40's club and the main events would be the same every week every month and every year til they retired and you'd be complaining that they never lose to a younger guy.|`|KIOR56r6aa	Undertaker jobbed to Kozlov was reaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaally gay!!!

KIOR56r6aa	WOW, I got an honorable mention!!! Usually at times like this, I would just say, "Why so serious?". But, since I consider this as a serious question, I think I'll explain why.<br>  <br>  There are times in our lives that define our existence, or u can say, mark our legacies. Those times stood as, say, perhaps the reason you're alive in the first place. I, and like most users here, grew up watching HBK and Undertaker. We knew how loyal they are to the company, how talented they are, and of course, how great they are.<br>  <br>  While it's true that they aren't who they are back there cause of their ages', they still perform better than 90% of the youngsters in WWE, eg the overrated gay botcher Kozlov (God, why did WWE make Taker lose cleanly to him?), Ted DiBiase Jr, John Morrison, etc.<br>  <br>  As the time goes, I found something irritating occurs. I found out that most of the current generation fans, view the two as a pathetic veterans who don't know when to quit. They said Taker n HBK should quickly retire so the young wrestlers like I mentioned above could instantly take their spotlights and become the new headliners. It seems to me that, they don't understand that u can't instantly become greats. You earn your greatness.<br>  <br>  I began to think, what WWE could do to make this fools realize that they're wrong, totally wrong. And I come up with a conclusion, to make someone realize a greatness, you must bring that greatness to them. And there's no other possible and monumental way, to show that greatness, other than having two of the greatest legend in our time, to face each other. That is, having The Undertaker face HBK at silver anniversary of Wrestlemania. <br>  <br>  There are some reasons of the time and place :<br>  <br>  1. Wrestlemania is no doubt the grandest stage of them all. It makes stars become legends, mortals become immortals, glories become greatnesses. Although many legends such as Hulk Hogan, Ric Flair, Razor Ramon, Andre The Giant, Stone Cold, Bret Hart, The Rock, Triple H, Chris Jericho, and the legends in the making such as John Cena, Batista, Edge, and Randy Orton performed their bests at Wrestlemania, there's no denying that, only HBK and Undertaker possess the most special things at Wrestlemania. The one being the show stealer and the other one being undefeated at Wrestlemania.<br>  <br>  Showstopper vs Undefeated, how does that sound as a match ?<br>  <br>  2. HBK and Undertaker are currently two of the longest service wrestlers in the roster. They have countless legendary moments and countless legendary matches. Surpassed even Hogan, Flair, Austin, Rock, Bret Hart, and Triple H. Far surpassed them all. They are two of the greatest legends. For me, they will always stand above Hogan, Flair, Rock, Austin, Bret, and HHH. And I believe some users feel the same way as I do.<br>  <br>  3. As I stated above, we as human live for the time that mark our existence. Deep in my heart, I feel that, this is perhaps the time that defines HBK's and Undertaker's careers as a wrestler. The time that will mark their legacies and make them forever remembered by us. I, at some point, believe that this match will far surpass and will be far more legendary than Austin vs Rock, Hogan vs Rock, Austin vs HBK, and HBK vs Bret. This match will be the 'Andre The Giant vs Hulk Hogan' in our time. Icon vs Icon, legend vs legend, hero vs hero.<br>  <br>  I believe this match will show the younger generation fans, what does it take for their young heroes to become greats. And make them realize that HBK n Taker aren't a pathetic old veterans like they said. And above all other, give us, the fans, something to be proud of, for us remember, that maybe this is the time that defines why we became the wrestling fans in the 1st place.<br>  <br>  Can u imagine that most of the users here have hard time answering who they support to win, who they like more, who they respect more, etc? The match is still 40 days from now but the hype and the atmosphere surrounding it is already this  big. Even when WWE tried to confuse us by throwing JBL and Kozlov there, even having Kozlov cleanly defeats Taker, we still believe in this match.<br>  <br>  Well, I guess that's for my reason why I long for this match. And tell u what buddy? I won't stop asking about them, even after the match is done. But, hey...why so serious? (^_^)<br>  <br>  Thank u for asking!!!|`|NLJ33Nkeaa	Yes He Asked The Same Question Like 10 Times But Who Can Blame Him.....Its The Match Of The Century<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT:-....Prince...I Worship That Answer|`|85ecad91da4761d50060ea7e04b61701aa	Im in New Zealand and i still Manage|`|NRs72Afxaa	Maybe because he is excited about the Undertaker vs Shawn Michaels at WM.

Z5xgSATSaa	I keep a couple of pieces of old worn out tire in my bag to deal with rips encountered on the road, and you can use one for a fairly extended period. Duct tape is not strong enough to hold against pressures seen in road bike tires. I once rode a whole season on a tire repaired with a piece of tire casing.|`|CttL3LmBaa	Talk to the Trek dealer where you bought the tire.  I have a set of Bontrager's on my hybrid and I had gravel cut the sidewall.  I explained what happened and he asked me to bring the tire in.  He replaced it at half price.  You might just get the same treatment if you try.  <br>  <br>  If you insist on trying to fix it and the cut is in the tread area, you can install a tire liner.  If the cut is in the side wall it is unrepairable and should be replaced.<br>  <br>  -----<br>  Edit: Rubber Cement or Super Glue will not hold up to the strains or flexing in a tire.  Period.|`|TEX1iYQgaa	There's no permanent repair that I know of. I've heard of people folding up a dollar bill and placing it between their tube and tire, but that was only a roadside fix.<br>  <br>  You can try gluing a patch on the inside of your tire, and continue to ride for as long as it lasts. You'll eventually have to break down and buy a new one though.|`|Cl6KbcAGaa	Personally I would fix it with a New tire!

If it's greater than 1/4", no safe "repair" can be made.<br>  <br>  And is the opening the result of a sharp object?  Or is it the result of failure/defect?  The latter would not be repairable.<br>  <br>  A sub-1/4" opening might be reliable for the remaining life of the tire IF a proper boot is correctly installed.  Such a repaired tire should be checked before every ride and should NEVER be installed on the front wheel.<br>  <br>  Bontrager tires are about as tough and durable as any road tire.  The problems are that they're usually a pain to install, they're heavier than other options, they have lower tpi and don't ride as smooth, and replacements are only available at full retail through Trek dealers.  Before dropping the $40, I'd investigate some alternatives that might be better suited for your type of riding...whatever that is.|`|Z2cbezZDaa	I wouldn't ride on a repaired tyre (I'm British - we spell things differently).<br>  <br>  A common get-you-home repair is to put a piece of hard wearing material between the inside of the tyre and the inner tube. I've heard it referred to as a boot. A tough piece of fabric will do.|`|YE87HP26aa	Yes, you can rubber cement.<br>  First, clean the area where the rip is.

Allow 24 hours for each coat.|`|ef8f9347022c55c01554a48180edfe16aa	Well, Bontrager tires are NOT good. I know it's not what you want to do, but I would replace those cheap *** tires. Go with Conti's.

a9f693c71e4b465afcc9a6b377b02694aa	Gretzky had asked Los Angeles to trade him to one of two teams<br>  1) Toronto Maple Leafs<br>  2) St. Louis Blues<br>  <br>  Toronto was willing to give up as much as LA wanted, so he ended going to St. Louis.<br>  <br>  At the end of the year (despite visible animosity between Gretzky and Mike Keenan), Gretzky fielded offers from both teams, as well as the Rangers, and St. Louis "lowballed" him in his opinion (3 yrs, $15MM).  Cliff Fletcher and Larry Barnett then reached an agreement in principle with Toronto, however (and Cliff Fletcher took years to make this public), the Toronto ownership situation at the time felt Gretzky was too big of a financial obligation ($12MM over 2 years) to take on.  So, he ended up in New York where he was able to get more money than in St. Louis ($6.5MM for 1 yr, it was extended a year later for 2 more years totalling b$11.5MM), and be re-united (as it turned out, only briefly) with Mark Messier.|`|lYnkvRASaa	M-dog you forgot to quote your source<br>  <br>  Quite easy just cut and paste an add a A in front of it<br>  <br>  A retired NHL scout (30+ years)|`|AA10068004	In St. Louis Mike Keenan fired criticism, in public, at him due to the fact that he and Brett Hull never developed chemistry as was hyped up.

DXSp4KQpaa	snowboarding and skateboarding are nothing alike AT ALL in feeling.<br>  snowboarding has a very soft feeling, at times hard and scratchy when its icey. but nothing beats fresh powder cuz it just feels like your flying through clouds. hitting rails almost feels similar to grinding on a skateboard depending on how smooth and waxed the obstacle is that your grinding on with a skateboard. other than that, sorry. hitting jumps is also nothing like a skateboard because you have to hit it with different speeds, land differently, different terrain. its all just different.<br>  <br>  now if you get into longboards (skating) there can be some similarities depending on your deck set-up (trucks, wheels, board, and smoothness of whatever your skating on.) longboards are far more smoother rides and you can go a helluva lot faster than trickdecks (skateboards) sliding a longboard does not feel too much like a snowboard, but it brings in that extra aspect that is similar to a brake on a snowboard. but it feels completely different because your strapped to a snowboard and there are a lot more variables to sliding a longboard. it might look like the same motion, but not at all.<br>  <br>  the thing with longboards is that they are great for hill bombing. when your cruising/carving/bombing/pumping down a hill, you sure as hell know your not on a snowboard, but you get a similar sense of speed and maneuverability you have snowboarding down a mountain. just a lot more intense on a longboard and pavement.<br>  <br>  so overall if someone says skating feels like snowboarding, its that euphoria of effortlessly moving along LIKE your snowboarding. closest thing possible would be carving and pumping down hills with a smooth longboard.<br>  <br>  they dont really use the same words, its just a lot of skaters snowboard too. snowboarding does have its own slang tho.|`|PtZk6c3Caa	They both have their own 'lingo'. Other than doing tricks in the air, many popular video games are based on both sports. Both have two ways of doing it:<br>  skateboarding- vert (ramps), street (rails...whatever you can find)<br>  <br>  snowboarding- race, freestyle (get the most points before you get to the bottom)<br>  <br>  Also, when you snowboard you are strapped into your board, whole different concept with skating. You fall, your board is landing 20 ft from you. In my opinion skating is the much harder sport.|`|z2acL7hgaa	i dont actually do either but from observation, the boards are very similar. One has wheels and the other is very long with no wheels, but they both have the same basic shape making it possible only to do similar tricks on them|`|KbuOMIPxaa	Skateboard is smaller and has wheels<br>  Snowboard is mostly for carving down big hills and doing cool grab tricks though you can carve down hills on a skateboard<br>  Snowboards are attached to you xD<br>  They're both awesome<br>  Snowboards are just for snow skateboard can go on a few different terrains<br>  Personaly skateboarding is better there's so much more to it|`|4AbXxowTaa	They are very different.  Snowboards are about weight distribution, and your feet are fixed to the board.  Skateboards are more about keeping balance while also keeping inertia and your feet are free to move on and off the board.  In snowboarding you never really have to propel yourself, you just keep the weight in the right place and that's how you control the board and gravity does the rest (although snowboarding is a lot more physically demanding in my opinion).  Skateboards are propelled by your feet pushing you forward unless you are on some form of half pipe.
Lh4zl8etaa	Luis castillo is a horrible player and does not deserve to even be in the lineup.  My reasoning of why jose reyes would bat 3rd is because he led the NL in hits last year, so he can drive in a run, Although i dont he should be moved.  The leadoff man is supposed to get on base and is supposed to make things happen.  Luis Castillo would only get the first out.  If for some stupid reason that the mets put Jose at 2nd or 3rd, i would put Daniel Murphy at 1st.  This guy had a good thing going at the end of the year and i think he can bring it into next year.<br>  <br>  Overall i do not think Jose Reyes should be moved in the batting lineup.|`|VlfV7uiZaa	The theory is that if you put someone with power (Beltran or Delgado) behind someone with speed (Reyes) then the guys with power will see more fastballs than breaking pitches, because the pitcher wont want to let the fast guy get to second. And then if the pitcher did decide to throw a breaking pitch, off goes Reyes.|`|BD7yd8D4aa	This is almost as idiotic as Tony La Russa batting the pitcher 8th. Now La Genius wants to bat our best prospect (outfielder) 9th.<br>  <br>  And Willie Randolpf was a bad manager. [sarcasm]|`|QIlhmWwBaa	i actually think putting Reyes as a 2 man is a good move what i really don't agree with is to put castillo as a lead off hitter they should put someone else on that spot|`|A7ddD3rdaa	The Mets want to show everyone they knew what they were doing when they threw all that money at Castillo after the worst season of his career.  Batting him leadoff would prove that they believe he is healthy and capable of getting on-base like he did with the Marlins (8 years ago, with good knees).  If he is in shape, he might be a decent #2.  he can't beat out the infield hits or steal bases like Reyes can, though. Putting Reyes in the 3 spot would put increased pressure on the pitcher, and Wright, Delgado and Church would see more pitches to hit.  Beltran would (supposedly) hit 2nd, keeping the 3 switch hitters at the top of the order.  But it's all rumor and speculation until opening day.|`|8JnpIOkyaa	The Mets are a disaster this year. Even with the addition of those lockdowns in the 8th and 9th, their starting pitching is a who's who after Johan. Reyes should stay at lead-off, Jerry is trying to make apples into oranges. Reyes was born to be a lead-off hitter as he sets the tone from the very beginning. The Mets better shape-up because the Phils are the team to beat, I'm sorry to say. They have the hardware to prove it. The Mets have NOTHING to back up any of their statements. You know spanish people, always talking smack with no credibility. (Just kidding) <br>  <br>  KEEP REYES AT LEAD-OFF! HE CAN'T HIT IN ANY OTHER SLOT... YET. LET HIM FIND HIS SWING FIRST THEN PLACE HIM IN THE 3-HOLE OR CLEAN-UP LATER DOWN THE LINE. But for now, let him lead off and beat out dribblers for base hits.|`|Wo2TEbHPaa	Actually its putting reyes in the 3rd hole. I haven't herd the 2nd spot. Reyes is to good to be a player who just takes high counts and bunts people over. Luis dose suck I cant believe we have him 3 more years. Hes turing into our Aaron Heilman. I cant see Castillo getting on and stealing a base. Let alone even having good speed. If Reyes moved into the 3rd hole though it wouldn't be to bad hes got good pop and hes got a 300 plus average. The question is would he preform differently as a number 3 hitter. I think Jerry manual just sed this to throw a another card in the mets fold. They might practice having Castillo in the #1 spot during spring training. Reyes wont be there though hes in the WBC. Also I think if they seriously considered moving reyes they would have signed a good lead off hitter like Willy Taverious. <br>  <br>  All in all dont worry Reyes will bat lead off. Im sure Castillo wont impress in spring training.|`|qivUrJ3Naa	The main reason is they both have speed and Reyes is good with the bat, for hit and run purposes.
F2ygsPEbaa	Wow, you're just asking for it, aren't you Mr. Valentine?<br>  <br>  Okay, I have heard that because the African American race is one that has historically been oppressed, that the strongest genetically of those in that race would have survived where others in the race might not have due to what they have been subjected to.  So it is natural (arguably) that this race might be better at sports which require the greatest degree of physical exertion.<br>  <br>  There are a few black hockey players.  But in North America, anyway, that is still a sport with largely Canadian origins and Canada has a lesser percentage of people of color than does the United States.<br>  <br>  At the end of the day, really good athletes ultimately pick from among several sports they could play.  This will probably be less prevalent in future generations.|`|PCpC4iS1aa	because most white people like it|`|d5928aef823e729cbef56cb2408fdda4aa	It actually has to do with demographics. Blacks are still a minority and tend to live in areas that are more populated (like cities). In these cities, it's very tough to play baseball or hockey or soccer because there is no access to fields. Basketball on the other hand is readily avaialable. Maybe in the future this will change though.|`|tU98LCX6aa	well maybe there's nothing else we could do maybe  there's no problem about it just let the time go by and u'll see that what you want will come true.... <br>                                                  good luck with that

I don't understand why people turn athletes into role models.  Why?  That's not why they do what they do.  They play professional sports, they're good at it, and they make huge amounts of money.  They aren't doing it for the fans, they're doing it for themselves.  And that's fine, really.  Why do you go to work every day?  Because it's what you do; it's how you make your living.  <br>  It is not an athlete's job to be a role model, and athletes generally are lousy role models, even if they're good, honest people.  What they do does not contribute to the good of mankind.  It's just sports; they're not saving any lives or even picking up your trash.

Varsity players do less that the JV and Freshmen people do. At practices especially.<br>  <br>  At tryouts you need to make sure that you don't give up and try to keep up with the pack.<br>  <br>  But you need to make sure you do a lot of sprinting hear is a program specific for training for varsity players.<br>  <br>  Play or do recovery runs on two of  the other days.   <br>  Make sure that you do a proper warm up and cool down each  time and that you are hydrating properly. Do not do more that what is required in this running program. <br>  <br>                       Running Workout for High School Players<br>                                              Monday<br>                                              At a track<br>                      300m in 1 minute or less recovery for 2 minutes<br>                       200m in 35  seconds or less recovery for 1:30<br>                      100m in 25  seconds or less recovery for 1 min<br>      then recovery  for 3 minutes, active recovery juggle your soccer ball, <br>  footskills etc. then,  repeat the whole workout again<br>                                           Wednesday<br>                                            At a  track<br>   1200m (3 laps)  run in 4:40 - 5:00 then recover for 5 minutes run again in under 4:40 - 5:00<br>                                               Friday<br>                                    Repeat as  Monday<br>  <br>  <br>  You also need to make sure you do a lot of ab work because the stronger core that you have the more balanced you are.<br>  Also work on your leg strengths, do a lot of squats and lunges.

Nash does need to retire but they have just as much talent. I don't judge by what happens on impact i judge on PPV's and they are normally quite good. TNA has a lot of problems now but i don't find watching talented wrestlers boring, company doesn't matter to me.|`|NRs72Afxaa	Lets me ask you this; Do you even watch Tna, buy their dvds, or order their ppvs?  Tna is a very good wrestling show. I agree that Tna needs to do something about their creative team, but what they are doing financially their doing great. <br>  <br>  The Empty Arena match was not bad, but I've seen better. It really played well into the storyline.  Kevin Nash stinks as a wrestler, but he is still gold on the mic.|`|1z7M3Tntaa	TNA don't suck they just make silly decisions sometimes same with WWE, they aren't perfect.|`|dT3xJ9GWaa	it willl not be scuk if they join wwe

This is also great for close quarters because it has a folding stock for easier maneuverability. It is a little heavy around 6 pounds. I don't know much about the JG36k but I know it's heavier and it is more accurate.|`|uBTPq0roaa	Broxa is the gun from aftermath right; if so then I wouldn't reccomend getting the Broxa for aftermath is only popular for they made it into mainstream stores and you can get better guns from Classic Army for the same price or a few bucks extra.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't a JG either; echo is own by the same company however they are the superior verisons.<br>  <br>  I didnt know this and now Im stuck with a JG M16A4 and the gun still has hop up effects with it turn all the way down....|`|2vtwUAg4aa	It depends on how often you are gonna use it. If it's just one to have, then get a JG as you can put it on display, but if it's one that you are going to use for all your weekend skirmishes then I'd get the Broxa.

We ( Chelsea are way too far behind) and Liverpool will fade after you beat them soon. Villa are a breath of fresh air but again they are too far behind you. I honestly think that you will only lose a maximum of one game if any and win the title by at least 9 points. As much as it pains me to say it you have been head and shoulders above everyone again. Even better this year because you have not relied on CR7 to score your goals.|`|106b0861b9e6921cff2d55a1208f8283aa	I support Liverpool and to be honest i doubt we can afford to drop any points and still have a chance at the title, if we have any chance at the title we need to beat man u at old trafford, but with liverpools record against utd under Benitez it doesnt look to likely. I dont think chelsea have got a chance of winning the title this season even if they do win all of their remaining games.|`|pz09LoOyaa	Im much more of a champions league gal myself probally because i support liverpool but I think everyone knows Man U are going to win it again no matter what happens.<br>  <br>  Liverpool and Aston Villa have had very successful seasons wheras Chelsea and Arsenal have had not very good seasons.<br>  <br>  As a liverpool supporter I am not expectng us to win but am very happy we have got second :)|`|0t8XYZKRaa	Lol no chance for Liverpool, Chelsea, Arsenal or Aston Villa to win the prem.

Dam Spurs beeter sort their sh!t out!!!!|`|TKDi70uTaa	i have to agree, the other three are just not up to it this season. even with utd giving them all a head start at the early part of the season they have caught and overtaken them easily. utd will stay top till the end now and i predict that they will win the title at least 12 pts clear.|`|cOPCNP7Laa	CFC up there answered with the one answer ALL Chelsea and Livershit fans should stick to. Except neither will get the CL haha|`|tIBZ9Gi3aa	Not a Liverpool or Chelsea fan,but I'll take my chances in answering this question.<br>  <br>  I think Liverpool can drop maybe 3-5 points for the rest of the season and still win the title.Chelsea can't afford to drop any more points.I think United can afford to drop maybe 5 points and still win the League comfortably.If we drop more than that we'll have to go down to the wire like last season,and God knows those senior citizens reminiscing about Liverpool's glory days can't take the pressure,and impending disappointment.|`|xU7AaQOdaa	As a Liverpool fan I have to agree with Oblivious, and if I was a bookmaker I would pay out on them now. The game at Old Trafford could change things, but I feel we will only get a draw at best- hope I am wrong here! <br>  <br>  Chelsea have no hope, and Villa should finish fourth.<br>  <br>  Now, under Roberto Martinez we would win next season!|`|XU1KaWXwaa	if we beat manu we can probably drop 2 points in a draw or sumthing but if we draw we can't :S and if we lose at OT we r basically out of it.|`|RSJbqioUaa	Tbh, I've given up on the league.<br>  I want the Champions League!!

How windy is the hunting area?<br>  <br>  As far as which one looks the best, that's entirely subjective and 500 people would probably give you 500 different answers.<br>  <br>  If you were wondering what the most common rifles are, Probably the Marlin 336 and Remington 700 (and all of the variants of both) would probably be the most common.  The 700 comes in all standard rounds... .30-06, .308, .243, .270, .223, etc.  The 336 comes in .30-30 and a few other calibers.|`|BQ4M9ODnaa	All of these answers are good answers and every man's rifle or shotgun listed above will more than take a white tail deer.<br>  <br>  I agree that on the east coast the 30-30 has taken more deer than all the rest.

Earlier there were only 1 T20, 2 tests and 5 ODI's. So to incorporate the additional matches,  a few matches were preponed including the first test match. And the extra T20 was added to the beginning of itinerary, which left little room for a practice match. It is a packed schedule with cricket played on 22 days out of the 45 days.<br>  <br>  Edit: There was a 3-day warmup match Scheduled to take place at Lincoln between the ODI's and Test series which was scrapped due to the extended schedule<br>  <a href="http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/india/content/story/386492.html" rel="nofollow">http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/india/co...</a>|`|f9hiPMDxaa	The reason there is no practice match is because this is what the BCCI wanted. Initially there was a 3 day warm up game but because the BCCI wanted to play an extra T20 and test match, the three day game had to go. The BCCI will get a better share of proceeds from the extra T20 and test than they would have from a warm up game. So no courtesy denied, this is what BCCI wanted.<br>  <br>  Cricket M, Dhoni won two tests against Australia in India? Get a life, how often have Australia won a series in India over the past 40 years.

0f58b7ae62db5c245105e10b9c061d03aa	Are you asking about organized groups that support hunting? If so, here are 3: NRA, North American Hunting Club, and Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership. Their websites can describe their viewpoints.|`|Z8UV6S3baa	I'll get you started here, and then you can do more research on your own. I am interpreting your question as identifying three groups of people who all support hunting, but for different reasons and to provide a basic explanation of those reasons. <br>  <br>  This is somewhat artificial as far as distinctions go, because hunters, in general, have very similar or related core purposes, even if at a detail level there are differences. However:<br>  <br>  1) "Hunting for food/survival": This group supports hunting because the meat they get feeds their families. Often these people are at least to some degree associated with rural communities or those with inconsistent employment. Historically this group grown or shrunk with the economy. In the case of the subgroup here where they are poor enough to "need" to hunt to feed their families, the distinction in viewpoint from other people in this financial situation is that they seek to support themselves and family through hunting rather than revert to public services from state or Federal government for support as others in this condition do.<br>  <br>  2) "Hunting for tradition/sport/link to nature": This group is distinguished from the first in that they choose to hunt for personal reasons as opposed to having a compelling need. In this group there is a range of perspectives which generally relate back to the idea that hunting provides a kind of experience and link to nature, fellow man, diety or even their own soul which cannot be experienced in any other way and needs to be maintained and passed down. A related perspective is that hunting is a kind of survival skill which is lost in modern day and should not be. Again, in this group will be people who eat their harvests, mount them, etc. <br>  <br>  3) "Hunting for wildlife management": There is a component of the hunting community which views hunting as a sort of responsibility to balance the other effects of man on the environment. Essentially, methods of controlling wildlife which avoid hunting have generally failed miserably. There are a number of good books on the environmental disasters that have happened at Yellowstone National Park for example due to people attempting to repopulate predator animals to control prey animal populations. (as well as ecological disasters from trying to use "natural methods" to control erosion and such) There are the same in many other places as far away as Australia. In comparison the various state DNR/Fish and Wildlife Management departments that allow hunters to take the role of self managed predators to keep herd populations as well as predator populations in balance have shown a stunning track record of success across virtually every state in the union in comparison. Virtually no extinctions, etc. Again, it is harder to find these due to the negative press hunters tend to get, but it is out there if you look for it. Hunters in this catagory, may also fall into the other catagories, but don't necessarily. <br>  <br>  Thinkingblade|`|6pUzzsuhaa	if you REALLY wanna know, then do your OWN research.. it's not that hard to find.. use google or yahoo<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  since your boyfriend is a hunter- ask HIM, not us|`|3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	* " Hunting is Fun and Enjoyable; Killing is neither Fun or Enjoyable.*..."

bIbyAkHPaa	The big Russian is way too big for Archie. It would be like Holyfield vs. Sweet Pea!|`|kqP7GwOcaa	I honestly believe that Vitali would chase the "Mongoose" around for 15 rounds, eat counter shots at about a 3 to 1 ratio and loose a lopsided decision.  Vitali couldn't even beat Chris Byrd, a feather fisted pumped up middle weight, I doubt seriously he could beat Archie Moore, one of the best light heavy weights of all time.  I would have liked to see Joe Calzaghe fight Moore, that would have been an interesting one.  Obviously if Vitali hit a smaller man, he could do some damage, but lets face it, he's not the fasted heavyweight on the planet, and Moore was pretty quick in his prime.  A good modern test would be if Vitali fought David Haye.  If Vitali could somehow deal with Haye, he "might" be able to take Moore, but if Haye (a fighter obviously inferior to Archie Moore) could give Vitali problems, Archie Moore would give the big guy even more trouble.<br>  <br>  If it went the distance, Vitali would lose, he would have to KO Archie Moore to beat him.|`|u3xmObC4aa	You sure do defend Euro boxers.

A7ddD3rdaa	Halladay - No.  He is one of a handful of true aces, and if he is traded, even the Jays wouldn't trade him to a division foe.<br>  <br>  Byrnes - not likely.  The Mets paid Castillo three times his worth.  In order to unload him, they would have to take on another bad contract or offer some $$$.<br>  <br>  Cano/Cabrera - no.  I can't imagine that, after Torre's book came out, any Steinbrenner would dare to talk trade with the Dodgers.  And, there is no place for Kemp to play in NY.  Their outfield is overcrowded already, if they trade anyone it'll be Xavier Nady first, probably for bullpen help and/or a back-end starter.|`|5EuOTAjJaa	No, none of your fantasy-land trades will happen.<br>  <br>  Analyze what you are saying and you will realize that all three of these "trades" would not benefit the teams involved.<br>   <br>  The Dodgers for example will never trade Kemp until they are convinced that he (Kemp) will never live up to his potential and so far the Dodgers still look at Kemp as a probable impact player.<br>  <br>  The free agent market is still wide open and there are some great bargains in it. Example: The Angels getting Abreu for very little, compared to his former yearly salary.|`|AA12370001	1. Never.  First of all Toronto would never trade to a team in their division.  <br>  <br>  2.  Why would any team want Luis Castillo?<br>  <br>  3. I doubt it since the Yankees are banking on Austin Jackson as their CF soon.  Who would they play at 2B?|`|dhs9QBMoaa	Of the three, I think Byrnes for Castillo is the most likely.  That's not to say that I think it's going to happen.<br>  The Jays will likely have to trade Halladay, rather than letting him walk away as a free agent.  Unfortunately (and I'm from Toronto, so I speak from painful experience), GM J.P. Ricchardi will probably find a way to screw it up.  We're entering year 9 or J.P.'s 5 year rebuilding plan, so that outta let you know how adept he is at his job.  If it's left to anyone other than J.P., I think you'll see Halladay go to the highest bidder - even the Yanks or Sox (who play in the same division).<br>  I don't see the Yanks trading Cano.  They'll just bide their time and buy somebody to replace Cabrera (who is horribly overrated).|`|1CgCx1E2aa	1- no the sox love lowrie and want him to be SS of future<br>  2- possibly<br>  3- never.

He's in the second year of that big contract GM Minaya gave him.  He was the most booed Met at Shea last year.  Good News though is he lost 17 lbs in the offseason and has declcared himself healthy.|`|GfzaszPPaa	i hope they do specially that the mets trade luis castillo. i know he can score and is a veteran but i don't like him. it's just the way he bat. when he bat he always hits ground balls

Vep76FT9aa	i think he will. ppl who say he wont are dumb. he has now got 3 MVPs, 1 superbowl, 1 superbowl mvp, set records. probably the smartest qb to ever play|`|e4ekb1amaa	There never will be a clear cut "greatest of all time" label, but I think Manning is well on his way to making a strong case for an argument.<br>  <br>  Most columnists, sports analysts, etc, have Manning in the top 10 already, and I'm a strong believer that he'll be around for another 5 years or so, and more than likely, he'll end up being the best statistical passer in the history of the league. However, many people judge a QB by his Super Bowl rings. Although Manning has a ring, he doesn't have multiples (at least not yet).<br>  <br>  I think that line of thinking is completely unfair - I suppose all those people think Terry Bradshaw was one of the top 3 QB's of all time then? Football is a team sport, and Manning never had a stellar team behind him. If you think Ben Roethlisberger is the 2nd best QB in the NFL at the moment, you deserve a trip to the loony bin - he's a decent QB on a great team.<br>  <br>  Manning always puts up great numbers, but he never had the defensive support of Bradshaw, Brady, Montana, Aikman, etc. Manning had a very rough start to his post season career, going 0-4, but take a look at that team. The year before getting Manning, they were the worst in the league, and after playing a rough rookie season, Manning turned around the franchise to be an annual contender. The first 4 years of his career, the Colts simply were not good - it was Manning that made them good, and in the playoffs, that's simply not enough. You need a good, well rounded team to find post season success - the Colts only had that team one full year. <br>  <br>  Sadly, the same is true for the Colts today - Manning is the mold to this team. Without Manning this past year, the Colts would have been a sub .500 team. There is no arguing that - he played through injuries behind a patchwork line, and a largely ineffective defense. and he was the MVP of the league, leading his team to a 12-4 season with a tough schedule. There is no other QB in the league who could have done that, and that proves how special Manning is. Similarly, the play of Matt Cassell may have disproved how valuable Brady is - I still believe any decent to good QB would thrive in New England.<br>  <br>  Manning has played amazing, and he will continue to do so for the forseeable future. Will he be the best all-time? To some people, he may be. To me, probably not, but he certainly will deserve mention in the argument.|`|Q8Rx0QZeaa	Nobody will see it now but brett favre will go down as the best of all time. He has over 6 QB awards. His legend will grow and by time he reaches canton he will be considered the greatest of our time. And as the years pass he will be considered the greatest for a long time until somebody better comes along. Peyton Manning is damn close though.|`|2VGbJtnCaa	Hard to say! My dad is 65 and he would argue that Unitas is the best ever! I am in my 30's and Elway was the best I have ever seen because I think he took 3 teams in the 80's to the super bowl that would not have made the playoffs if he was not on them! Manning and Brady are up there and I would not count out Rothlisberger either!|`|jIONJZSJaa	There are some people who would argue he's not even the best quarterback in Colts history.  A lot of older people like Unitas.  Me personally, he's up there, but behind Montana, Elway, and Brady, to name a few.|`|VhgyQES9aa	Not even close|`|PFejQPb2aa	he'll be up there but probaly not the best|`|fKco44yxaa	No...in a few years time he will be a footnote|`|yxaOg0QDaa	yeah he probably will given his stats, everytime he steps on the field he breaks some sort of record<br>  <br>  there are qbs considered some of the greatest of all time who either have 1 ring or 0<br>  <br>  I don't know how many colts fans are on here or how much they know about their post season but manning usually plays well enough to win, out of all their playoff elimination seasons you can probably blame 1 or 2 games on him, the rest can be blamed on other people..this year he was mvp and played good enough to win the game against the chargers, his defense on the other hand, couldn't stop the run and got costly penalties in the game to lose in overtime, that's not his fault, that's the defense<br>  <br>  but that comes with the territory of being a QB, you get praised for wins even if you weren't the key player and you get blamed for the loses when its not your fault<br>  <br>  as far as numbers go, they are unprecedented, he's already a lock for hall of fame and if he gets just 1 more ring he's probably a lock for best all time even though there are players out there with more rings than him|`|IUPUXwQnaa	No, although he's won a super bowl, he hasn't had any accoomplishments which set him aside from guys like favre and Marino. Also, Another championship wouldn't hurt. But, he IS a hall of famer.|`|7AUwyiTJaa	No because Brady is better|`|2fEyQlDoaa	he will be up there in the standings but i don't think he will|`|616b18f35255971ece90dca0da3b2da8aa	Manning will probably stick around long enough to claim all of the signifcant statistical passing records so there will be some that will try to claim that he is the best of all time. He will definitely be considered among the best.<br>  <br>  However, the majority of people will never accept him as the best of all time with 1 ring versus QB's with 2, 3, and 4 rings. He'll come up a tad short in that category like he has in college and NFL competition.|`|AA12103453	Failures in the post-season year after year will prevent that. He would have to win 3 Super Bowls in a row, after all how many more season would he have to try to get to 4(the current record). Face it Joe Montana was better then Peyton Manning, and considering Manning's failures in the post-season there is a reason for him to have to prove he can have success.|`|7RziqsDcaa	He would be if the Colts had better luck in previous years (not choking in the big games).<br>  <br>  Now the Colts are going to be in a declining stage (remember how bad last season was?).

He has no defense what so ever every year but some how he still managed to win one ring. Tom Brady has a much better team around him Matt Cassel went 11-5 with the pats last year and he hasn't started a came since Highschool, he also had 4 games with 400+ yrds and 4 tds something brady never did. The fact that the pats have 3 rings while peyton has one is because the teams are better.|`|jIONJZSJaa	Tom Brady.  He's done more with less.  He won 3 Super Bowls throwing to the likes of Troy Brown, David Patten, and Deion Branch.  Manning had Harrison, Wayne, and Stokley during that time.  Brady was handing the ball off to Antowain Smith, and for one Super Bowl, Corey Dillion.  Manning had James.  If Manning had gotten to at least a few of the Super Bowls in which they were the favorite to go, maybe you can make an argument.  But when the Colts need him to play his A game in the playoffs, he always leaves it at home, unless they play the Broncos.|`|yxaOg0QDaa	manning is definitely a better player but brady has had a better team built around him<br>  <br>  he had the record for most TDs in a season with 49 and that came at a time where, if his team was up by a significant amount of points, he would sit out..when brady did his 50 TDs it was during the Pats' ''F-U'' tour of the nfl, playing every team and running the score up on them because they were bitter about the spygate scandal, tom brady would stay in for pretty much the whole game<br>  <br>  manning does more with less, brady does about the same with more weapons<br>  <br>  the difference is manning is better at reading defenses and he's a playmaker, brady is a qb who plays fundamental ball, he doesn't have to be a playmaker, you put the ball in welker or moss' hands and your good to go, brady has more rings but a superbowl win is a team effort, and last I recall they beat all 3 teams in the superbowl with a field goal, that's more of a credit to adam vineterri than anyone else|`|6AfM6SWaaa	Tom Brady.

He has one of the best offensive lines in the NFL, and 2 WR's in the top 15 in the NFL. Put peyton manning on the patriots and he will shatter Brady's record with another 50 on top of that.

Vep76FT9aa	yes he is|`|AOA8TJraaa	My side of Larry Fitzgerald:<br>  <br>  Larry Fitzgerald, outstanding leaper, exeptional speed for a wide reciever, great young superstar, great awareness.It's easy to say Fitzgerald is right now. Nobody was talking about this subject before the playoffs. Let me be clear: I think Fitzgerald is a very good receiver and certainly one of the best. But I think that Randy Moss is the best receiver. You can't stick to Moss one-on-one.<br>  <br>  I do remember Rodney Harrison playing against Fitzgerald during his rookie season. I was impressed of Fitzgerald, for a big man, he was very athletic, very quick. And he ran really good routes. He's really good at catching the ball at its highest point. He has all of the small little habits that make a receiver really good.<br>  <br>  Fitzgerald has been really good this postseason, having the best postseason of anybody in NFL history. But right now, I think that guys like Moss, Andre Johnson and even Chad Johnson are among the best. That's not to say that Fitzgerald isn't in their class, because he is. I want to see him do it consistently along with guys like Marvin Harrison and Reggie Wayne.<br>  <br>  If he does this next year, then yes, I think he could be the best.<br>  <br>  My side of Andre Johnson:<br>  <br>  I think that Larry Fitzgerald and Andre Johnson are the two best young receivers in the game. I'm torn. I believe that Fitzgerald and Johnson are interchangeable. Johnson is just as skilled of a receiver as Fitzgerald. He is just as unstoppable. He's a wrecking crew out on the field.<br>  <br>  Fitzgerald's team is a lot better. He has a Pro Bowl receiver on the opposite side. He has an all-planet quarterback throwing him the ball. And he's in the playoffs right now, so everybody is watching what he's doing. But we can't get too "fast food" about it -- don't make a snap decision about it just because it's the playoffs. We need to slow down.<br>  <br>  His size is what really sets him apart. He has that great size like a lot of the other top receivers -- Terrell Owens, Randy Moss and Plaxico Burress. Those guys are freaks. They all have that size to make mismatches with defensive backs. Fitzgerald is also good at attacking the football -- fighting off the other guys to make the play.<br>  <br>  So for me, it's Fitzgerald and Johnson as the two top young receivers in the game right now.<br>  <br>  I can't choose between they are both very evenly matched receivers.|`|AA11524511	yes. and not just because of the playoffs or people noticing him recently. he's been among the top 5 for the past 3-4 years, and alot of people thought he was the best receiver before this past season started. for now, its him, andre johnson, steve smith, then everyone else is down a notch. you could even put his teammate anquan boldin in his category, he missed 4 games and still had numbers that match fitzgeralds. he's also the fastest player ever to reach 400 catches.|`|H8c8vt3Yaa	Sorry unfortunately he isn't, although he did great in the playoffs, he's been doing that for years nobody noticed that's all. The best Wide Receiver honestly in my opinion is Calvin Johnson because he has everything. Speed, strength, hops, hands, all he needs is a qb and some ol help and he's hall of fame status.|`|0MJRD9sYaa	The question is now. Now, he clearly is. With how great he was in the playoffs, right now he is the best wide receiver in the NFL. Next season, I don't think so. Boldin may be gone, Warner might be retiring. Tom Brady is back and if the Texans draft a QB like Mark Sanchez then Andre Johnson can put up even bigger numbers than he did this season.|`|yWhFoBBfaa	Yes, because he can do it all. Catch the deep ball, he has speed, he is a great route runner, he makes big plays, he is a clutch player, he is unstoppable when catching the fade but, the most important thing is... HE PUTS UP AMAZING NUMBERS WITH THE NUMBER 2 PRO BOWL STARTER ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FIELD.|`|GmYM3CLwaa	yes because due to how he set the bar and he has anquan boldin as compition on his team but yet between the two i think he is better than any wr in the league.|`|Q8Rx0QZeaa	Andre Johnson is the best in the league he is really underrated|`|pDrm6J2Taa	I mean he has great balance and hands he showed us this in the Superbowl, he also has that dazzling speed, but there are many out there who could contend with him for instance Andre Johnson?|`|7RziqsDcaa	Larry fitzgerald has Kurt Warner as a quarterback.<br>  <br>  Andre Johnson has Matt Schaub.<br>  <br>  Andre Johnson is.|`|XaFYUMRSaa	After watching him in the playoffs I would say yes!|`|MyuexdrYaa	the guy above me i understand your argument but if you watch kurt warner play he lost all his touch. He throws crappy lobs in the general area of the reciever fitz has to do all of the work. Andre Johnson and Fitz are basically ties but ever since college ive been a Fitzgerald fan, I bought all his jerseys, cards, and autographs when he was nobody. So im gonna go with Fitz|`|2VGbJtnCaa	Right at this minute? Yes! Will have to to what Moss does when Brady comes back!|`|UgnMjtYDaa	yes, you can say that safely.|`|uQrIdrjfaa	either him or andre johnson

If I was an NFL player, I would ignore the media altogether.  It would get too frustrating defending yourself against a constant barrage of attacks.   <br>  <br>  No matter how good you are, or how big of star, someone will always have something negative to say.   That's pretty much fact.<br>  <br>  If you need proof, check out Donovan McNabbs career.  Hes never been in trouble, has turned in what is probably a hall of fame career, has kept the Eagles consistantly competitive, dispite having almost nothing around him to work with his whole career, and he is still butchered by his home town fans on a weekly basis.<br>  <br>  Could you imagine being Donovan McNabb, and NOT ignoring things like Yahoo Answers?|`|XLXncQu9aa	Nope.  NFL players spend more time at the clubs, playing golf on their days off, and renovating their mansions.  If they do come to this section it would surprise me.  They also don't have a lot of time on their hands to do that with all of the weight training they must do to keep in shape each week.  And the top contributor badge isn't lame.  It just signifies that those who have it or most of those who have it know something about a particular section.

u8GHTJEEaa	Yes, for 2 reasons:<br>  <br>  1. Vince can put anyone he wants into the WWE Hall of Fame.<br>  <br>  2. There are many people who never wrestled for the WWE at any time in its history that are in the Hall of Fame such as James Dudley,  Ed "The Sheik" Farhat, and Antonino Rocca.<br>  <br>  J3Y, there was once a WCW Hall of Fame. The first inductions were in 1993, and the last inductions were in 1995. Dusty Rhodes,Verne Gagne, Harley Race, the late Big John Studd, the late Ernie Ladd, the late Gordon Solie, and the late Eddie Graham are in both the WCW and WWE Halls of Fame. Terry Funk will join this group on April 4.<br>  <br>  AQ: Diamond Cutter is better.|`|wMh38OzVaa	I don't think that DDP will because he didn't do much for the promotion while he was there and didn't do anything in the business to deserve such a honor.As for Sting no chance.He snubbed VKH years when he didn't take him up on his offer to join years ago.HOF is a "honorary" award going to people VKM wants to show respect to.I don't think VKM wants to show somebody respect that snubbed him do you?|`|UbUSth5haa	I think Sting could be inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame, if he accepts but it would be very controversial because he never wrestling for Vince McMahon. Vince owns the right to WCW, but grabbing a wrestler like Sting and saying I'm inducting you into the WWE Hall of Fame for you're accomplishments in WCW would be controversial.|`|Y34FkAp0aa	well they should do a wcw hall of fame separate from the wwe HOF...but that's goin to take a while.....ddp maybe can cut it(due to he has some history with the company).......<br>  <br>  Aq: i like orton's variaton........but both can do awesome reversals then do a diamond cutter/ a RKO..........|`|uqlbt4vyaa	Probably not but i think they should, but the Bop bop bop needs to go in first of all<br>  <br>  Add Q: Obviously

ZJDpdp8Gaa	Know they didn't! Those guys gave sweat, blood, and tears to get that belt! I can't believe you would say that about such great WWE Superstars! You should go and say that stuff about Jack Swagger and Edge! So get you stuff straight about these Supperstars because they give everything they have for the WWE fans!!!!|`|AtJXqxN2aa	The thing is WWE can't be keeping a title on someone that no one wanna see or no one that will bring in money. We tend to forget WWE is a place of work and not a sport.<br>  <br>  It's like the normal working environment. You get a promotion based on your attitude, work determination etc.<br>  <br>  Same applies for WWE but instead a promotion is called a push where the superstars make it to the world champ level.<br>  <br>  The fans began to loose faith Rey immediately. And WWE were planning on giving Chavo a heel push at the time. That explains why he lost it.<br>  <br>  Punk was a main event push try. Management realised that Punk wasn't ready for the main event as yet. So they carried him back to mid card. If you saw Punk in ROH or IWA MS you would see that he is better as a heel. If Punk gets  a heel turn, not only would the crowd hate him but his mic skills will be better and his ring work will defintely be better. Don't agree, trust me look up the vids Punk is awesome as a heel.<br>  <br>  Jeff as sad as it is to say,the only reason they gave him the belt was just to shut the Jeff fans up. When the fans finally shut the hell up they decided to take it away from him as Edge would hav brought in more money than Jeff. Even though Edge is not popular in terms of what's better for the business, Edge was the better choice. A heel can turn face and challenge Edge. That face turn the heel recieve will send the crowd wild, only because they are going up against Edge and apparently people really don't like the guy.<br>  <br>  RVD is one of those wrestlers that really didn't need the belt. The fan support he had way back in his ECW days all the way to his WWE das was excellent. RVD got better recption flying off laders than walking around as champ.<br>  <br>  There you have it.

onySROuhaa	Its hard to tell you what specifics to work on without seeing you swim, but two general things that you should work on are technique and endurance.  It sounds like if you slow down after your start that you need more endurance/stamina training.  Do things like underwaters to increase your lung capacity.  Then do a lot of pulls and kicking drills to build strength.  It might not hurt to throw in a day or two of weight training as well if you want to build strength.  Technique is also key of course in swimming.  You need to be doing the stroke with precision to be able to get the most out of the effort you are putting in.  This is the main thing coaches do for you.  Just try and maximize the distance you are getting from each stroke you take, while maintaining a rhythm to keep your stamina up.  Also work on your breathing, if it is taking you that long to do 100m you probably arent breathing correctly.|`|Fe15PkS7aa	you should really just work on your form, stroke, and kick and if you lack  the ability to do good on one of these then work on your starts and your pushes off the walls|`|e0Dj4Lejaa	Practice on your start and your turns. Make sure you're always looking down but not burrowing your chin in. Make sure you follow the middle black line always, don't 'circle' swim (don't go on the right side of the lane, then the left). Also, get some training gear to use. Like kickboard, paddles. Work on dolphin kicking off the wall, holding your breath. Breath to both sides in practice, but only one side in competition to make things simple but train body rotation. Practice everyday, eat right, have fun. Get pumped, do stretches, wear competitive swim-wear. Do weight-training, aerobics.|`|gJDJ2r2caa	Dear question girl:P<br>  i swim for 4 years competitive.<br>  do you know to do the turn on the wall in free style?<br>  if u will do it you will get so much beter.<br>  you should count to your self how you do for  25 meters then 50 then 100.try.|`|HaRaKHqaaa	how old are you?? work on your kicks, be sure to have a lot of power in your strokes and keep your head still.. its kinda hard to answer without seeing how you swim.. anyways good luck!! ask your coach!!

CttL3LmBaa	If you see a site selling a Trek it is not a Trek dealer.   You are probably looking at a used bike or someone reselling a new bike.<br>  <br>  Most communities have a couple of Trek stores, if not it's hard to go 50 miles between them.  Cross shop them and don't be shy that you are looking for the better deal.  The need the sales right now.  Also you really should build a relationship with a bike shop if you are looking for that quality of bike.  Most Trek stores, no matter the discount you talk them into, will offer lifetime adjustments on the bike and some give free flat repair.  Even a first bike needs attention sometimes.|`|4dfbcf738541ddcd8d3291d2dbbb44deaa	You can only buy Trek bikes from a Trek dealer.

Uyz6iZwKaa	Because when people who are not fans of AFL comment and give their opinion (being anti AFL) people who are obviously followers of AFL report that answer so it is taken off. Heaven forbid someone should say anything bad about AFL on a public forum where people are entitled to give their opinion. It just goes to show that some people are that self involved that they are not willing to even listen to what others think.<br>  <br>  I wonder how long this answer will be up before its reported for being anti AFL?!<br>  <br>  PS I follow NRL - the best Aussie game ever! (remember that it is just my opinion ... hahaha)|`|nINl1ynhaa	I guess it depends on the severity or how profane the question is and to whether it contravenes the rules for this site.<br>  <br>  However, why post a Anti AFL question on this site if not to seek rebuke and a hostile response. <br>  <br>  I dont normally visit this site, and if I do, it would not to denigrate the fans on this site or to make derogatory comments about the sport.<br>  <br>  I've been following Collingwood and Essendon since 1974 onwards, my teacher then from Victoria, Aus introduced Aussie Rules to our college in Wanganui, New Zealand.<br>  <br>  Cheers<br>  All Blacks and Kiwi Fan<br>  Go the Warriors and the Hurricanes|`|hTruYNUQaa	It's considered a rant if you post anything in this section not to do with AFL.<br>  <br>  Just go away troll and annoy someone else|`|94d210326a19c672cd98b1a32e43da78aa	Because there are some super sensitive people on YA!|`|L739KCSaaa	CameronJ said: <br>  <br>  "Heaven forbid someone should say anything bad about AFL on a public forum where people are entitled to give their opinion"<br>  <br>  This isn't actually a forum - although people have tried to turn it into one. It's meant to be a place to get answers when you ask a question. Basically this place is being misused. So, to answer the question, Anti-AFL questions are taken off because they are usually posted by people who aren't really looking for answers and basically just want to have a negative rant. Unless it's in the form of a constructive question, I don't have a problem with these "questions" being removed. No section should have to deal with trolls who just want to create trouble for fans of that section.|`|mj1bC73gaa	I think a lot of them are mindless rants but if someone wants to seriously compare, then go for it.<br>  <br>  Your suggestion that there are anti-AFL "questions" though is an oxymoron.  You see if you're 'making a point' then you're not asking a question, are you?<br>  <br>  If however someone wants to ask a question like "what's more painful - being on the bottom of a Union ruck, being in one of these modern league (so-called) 'scrums', or taking a hip and shoulder to the jaw at full pace ... then I'm up for it!<br>  <br>  I love all three games myself - but league lost me a few years ago when my team (Raiders) were penalised for "pushing in the scrum".

tvuhGTD9aa	No. Rodriguez' disclosed usage changes nothing about how widespread PEDs had infiltrated the game.<br>  <br>  What it does change is people's perceptions of how some players "would never do that". Fans think they know who would resist, they hope that their favorites or their team would have the will and strength of character to forfend -- but those illusions get dashed frequently, and Rodriguez now stands as a darkly shining example of how wrong those hopes and perceptions can be.<br>  <br>  This changes little other than crossing Alex off a mental list for many fans. Surely, SURELY my next favorite player (Jeter, Griffey, Pujols, Chipper... insert name of choice, anyone will do) won't be the next!<br>  <br>  And then, some day, one of them will BE the next... and we'll go through this again.

0MJRD9sYaa	Look at their schedule for next year before making predictions. They have by far the HARDEST SCHEDULE in the NFL. I would say they are going to go 7-9 next year. This past year they had a very easy schedule playing the NFC and AFC West, the two worst divisions in the NFL. Also, they were last in their division the previous year so they were allowed to play the Texans. This year they have to play the NFC South and the AFC South. They also have to play the Chargers and Steelers because they won their division.<br>  <br>  The Dolphins have a year of problems ahead of them.<br>  <br>  7-9 at the best. I predict the Patriots to win the division and I'm saying all of this as a Jets fan.|`|7RziqsDcaa	Let's hope not.|`|XaFYUMRSaa	They need a QB that can step up in the Playoffs.Until then no ...................|`|UgnMjtYDaa	Matt's right the schedule is too tough. we go 7-9 maybe 8-8 at this point. That said, free agency and the draft CAN change everything. I want to see what parcells and this new owner are about. There are big time WR's available as well as some other big names. And I think chad pennington was looking real good the last few games of the season. So A bowl run is possible but not likely. We'll see about the playoffs.|`|5j81EoVXaa	i did it in madden so why not|`|6a0dd7563167279d8fff996ef06631f5aa	With Chad Pennington as their QB?  No|`|uQrIdrjfaa	no they can not dolphins suck|`|yWhFoBBfaa	I just don't see it. They have come along way since going 1-15, but I don't seem them winning the division when Brady comes back. They have a shot at the playoffs, but the AFC is way too deep. The Steelers could repeat very easily, the ravens are only going to get better on offense, and teams like the colts are always dangerous. I just think their too many landmines out there for the dolphins to get there next year.|`|JqUGmk3Paa	The Dolphins need more WRs... That Ohio State kid Ginn is all they really have.  Their best WR is their friggin TE.... Pennington is a pretty good QB, but he flops from time to time.... The Dolphins need Chad Henne to come in and go big as a rookie, but they will still need some HUGE games to take on the big, physical teams that are in their way.. Mostly the Ravens..  The Dolphins need a bigger offensive line too.  Even though the 'phins used the wildcat to own the Pats in one of their games last season, the second game said a lot about the patriots' overrated talent(they won, but the game was tough against... the phins.. cmon), I would not be surprised if they split 1-1 again next season.. Big, aggressive teams are the worst for the smaller, more effort-based Dolphins.  They just cant handle a team with a big, strong front.|`|fKco44yxaa	Pull it together from a playoff appearance?<br>  <br>  And prob no...depends on a certain person knee...and another teams QB options...|`|6AfM6SWaaa	Nooo  They gotta get by my patriots.

sBrummATaa	tiger woods|`|jwm0kQvNaa	Jack Nicklaus- hands down.  Tiger dominates now... so what?  Until he breaks Jack's 18 major wins (the standard by which all golfers are measured) Tiger is second-fiddle.<br>  <br>  Most fair-weather fans say Tiger is the best only because he is the only one they follow.  No one (yet) is truly challenging him.  Harrington, Mickelson, Singh... those guys all have 3 majors each, Retief Goosen has 2.  Those are his next closest competitors.<br>  <br>  Jack had Arnold Palmer (7), Tom Watson (8), Lee Trevino (6) and Gary Player (9) as his competition... and he STILL managed a 2nd place finish in 19 other majors!  If you want to split hairs, how many second place finishes does Tiger have?  Not 19, that's for sure.  Jack was ALWAYS in contention.  Could you imagine?  Breaks in his favor at different times, and he could've had 37 major victories!  Yes, that's a LOT of breaks at different times, but imagine if only half of those went his way...  Tiger isn't close to that, in an overall point of view.<br>  <br>  Most people need to go back farther than the last 10-12 years, and look up some golf history.  I like TW- don't get me wrong, he's amazing, but he isn't the be-all-end-all of golf.  How many people will disappear from the golf scene when he retires?  That's what I'd like to know.|`|wYGeg0QRaa	The best amateur of all time is the incomparable Robert Tyre Jones Jr. and the best professional Ben Hogan whose story will never be matched. Both of these men are still revered long after their careers are a piece of the history of the game and played at a time when technology and science had nothing to do with the game|`|W2R8TRDmaa	Tiger.|`|3d1XRIzkaa	no doubt about it, Tiger Woods is the best golfer|`|FXfI6Fy9aa	My mother says that I am.<br>  <br>  While Tiger may have the most varied skill set, he hasn't yet dominated as long as Jack Nicklaus did, he hasn't yet won as many times as Jack, and of course, he doesn't have the Major count... yet.  If he never wins again (trust me, I know the possibility is remote, at best) you CAN'T reasonably call him the best of all time.<br>  <br>  He certainly has the best chance to be called the greatest golfer of all time, but he hasn't accomplished it just yet.  Too many people give to much creedence to what is happening now.  It's too easy to forget just how good the golden bear really was... not to mention, amongst MUCH more credible competition.<br>  <br>  I think it's every golfer's dream to see '65-'67 Nicklaus versus '99-'01Tiger Woods, now that would be a match, because unlike most of Tiger's current competitors, Jack ain't bucklin'|`|aX8nee8gaa	C'mon Griller seriously?<br>  <br>  No one yet has possessed the greatness through all facets of the game that Tiger Woods has shown since his career began. Bob Jones was basically forced out of competitive golf by his nerves and Hogan got to where he couldn't draw the putter back on a 4 footer. While no one can dispute the greatness of either of these players, neither one was able to outperform every other player for the length of time that Tiger has demonstrated already. Look at their careers and you can see how very short each of their eras of winning really were. Jack is the only other player in the conversation, but all of us who watched both Jack and Tiger know that Tiger's short game and ability to maneuver the ball both directions and at different trajectories are far superior. I appreciate golfers with a sense of history, but you have to acknowledge that we are witnessing history every time Tiger plays, and we have been for quite some time now.|`|YPQTXOQ5aa	My top five:<br>  <br>  1. Jack Nicklaus-Had a little more competition from other greats (Palmer, Watson, Trevino) than Tiger when he was playing.<br>  <br>  2. Tiger Woods<br>  <br>  3. Ben Hogan<br>  <br>  4. Sam Snead<br>  <br>  5. Bryon Nelson|`|t3rmVomeaa	Right now, Jack Nicklaus.  Twenty years from now, Tiger Woods.|`|CBVlu3Gvaa	While I will agree that Bobby Jones was great in his time and Hogan was surely a force in his and Jack was definetly from a different nebulae in his.....I don't see Sam Sneads name mentioned here so far his 82 career tour wins should be mentioned also......However,  There has been not one golfer that has truely dominated the way that Tiger has......This is not to say the the others are mere footnotes in history.....but hands down I give the nod to Tiger on this

CttL3LmBaa	Most tires with a Vectran or Kevlar belt made under the tread is "puncture resistant".  The very best tires I have experienced in 40+ years of riding are the Continental 4000 S.  I will warn you that it is a $60+ tire.  If you are looking for high performance, long wearing, and cut resistance it is almost impossible to beat.  It is also a slick.  <br>  <br>  A close second is the Michelin Pro 3.  By their ad piece, "Derived from Motocross tire technology".  My son is on his second season on a pair and loves them.  He rides them on a much lower pressure than I like and that may help resist some junk.<br>  <br>  Another brand of tires that have earned a reputation for being bomb proof are Schwalbe, specifically their Marathon brand.  They do not handle anywhere like the Conti, but it is the choice of countless cross country riders.<br>  <br>  I have Vittoria's on one of my bikes right now (came on the new bike) and they seem to be ok.  Haven't been through gravel with them yet.  <br>  <br>  Here is a good site to either compare tires or purchase them.  I buy mine there and they give great service and free shipping.<br>  <a href="http://www.biketiresdirect.com/ti/tires_and_tubes/category.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.biketiresdirect.com/ti/tires_...</a>|`|468e5cy8aa	I've had good luck with Vittoria and Continental tires. I am currently riding Continental Ultra Gatorskins. They are very flat resistant and also ride much better than other flat resistant tires I've tried in the past. They do cost a bit more, but I think it's worth the extra expense.<br>  <br>  HTH|`|znaKDSRhaa	I have ridden Michelins, Hutchinsons, and Vittorias in recent years. I recently swapped on a pair of Vittoria Randonneur tires and love them: great feel, puncture-resistant, easy riding, and good predictable cornering characteristics. They are directional so make sure that you find the little arrows on the sidewalls and mount them pointing in the direction of rotation. I bought mine from Western Bikeworks, on-line, on sale. <br>  <br>  BTW, I strongly recommend that you replace both tires at the same time, keeping them matched. That way, you will not have your back tyre handling the road differently from your front and dumping your bike at the worst possible time ... like in a tight curve at speed. You do not want unpredictable handling characteristics; you want safe and secure. Some tyre sets do come in front/back matched sets and that is okay; they are designed to work as a set, together. Otherwise, avoid homemade mix-and-match.|`|aH5kxWYwaa	Continental Ultra Gatorskins. 23 or 25 mm.  I have tried Michelins, Verdesteins.  Tried the Contis riding on dirt and gravel and  very impressed with these tires.  Not a scratch on them.  This is 70 km on gravel,dirt, and hard pack.  Admitted they are pricey but I think  well worth it.|`|ef8f9347022c55c01554a48180edfe16aa	As stated above, Continentals are great tires. You should really buy 2 new ones. If you have to replace the rear one, the front is next to go....usually.|`|z4Yeofq8aa	I use a conventional tyre fitted with a puncture resistant liner- the only punctures I get are pinch flats and even those are rare.|`|fX581PsIaa	You might want to look at the bontrager race lite hardcase.

7nDpz7vyaa	NCAA seems more fun.  NFL seems more business like and serious.  I like them both.|`|KNTofuxMaa	I love them both but, my heart will always be with college. I love the rankings and the debate that comes with them on a weekly basis. I also like the fact that every game counts. The regular season actually means something in college. I understand that people dislike college because there is no "playoff". It doesn't bother me too much. I would like to see a plus one format adopted in college but, would never be in favor of an NFL style playoff. You can't tell me that the Cards were worthy of being in the Super Bowl. Even playoff system's are flawed.|`|0TAld46gaa	College football brings alot more passion.<br>  Games mean alot more<br>  and players seem too love it more thatn football.<br>  <br>  The crowds even if you have a bad team<br>  come to the games and support there school<br>  <br>  Nfl is great but i prefer college|`|5gG2OfHIaa	The NFL pays its players very well.  The NCAA seems to focus its pay package on the coaches.   My habit is to watch only one tv game per week based on which game I think will be competitive.   Feel that you have to strip the amateur label off the NCAA game, if you are going to enjoy the college game.  I pick the NCAA based on the "X" factor of the players being younger and subject to less predictable play on a week to week basis.  Just two flavors of pro ball.|`|6a0dd7563167279d8fff996ef06631f5aa	NFL far and away better on every level.|`|XaFYUMRSaa	Until the NCAA has a playoff format the NFL is 100% better!|`|Q8Rx0QZeaa	When a undefeated team(Utah this year and Bosie last year) can't make the national championship because of a popularity contest then of course the nfl is better.

XLXncQu9aa	I believe it was too late.  Why wait until now to fine a player when that celebration happened weeks ago?  I believe it has something to do with the ref who didn't call it or didn't fine Holmes being called out or pressured to do it.  I believe that the NFL is just doing this or fining players because they want to keep the peace and not have the NFL look like a mockery.  I do miss the TD celebrations but in a way the officials are only doing this to keep the players in line and so they won't cause altercations.  However if he was going to be fined, the refs shouldn't have waited until weeks later.  That in itself is inexcusable.  But again I believe the ref who didn't flag Holmes or fine him was pressured into doing and now you have a fine that goes back to the first week of February.  And there is no doubt the fans had something to do with this.|`|TJMpKqFNaa	The fine is way too late, no doubt, but I don't know if I'd go so far as to say missing that call blew the whole game for Arizona.  Arizona would have had to have done a lot of things after getting that call to score again and win.<br>  <br>  I think the ref(s) who missed that call should also be fined just like Holmes was - it was clear that what Holmes did (using the football as a prop) was illegal and an obvious penalty.  If everyone at my Superbowl party saw the penalty as it happened, don't tell me (NFL) with a straight face that no ref on the field saw what he did!|`|CrYzalpyaa	Wow!, Santonio Holmes shook the ball over his hands and threw the ball in the air! <br>  *Gasp*.... I guess we might as well start throwing flags and fining guys for taking the football and spiking it into the ground. <br>  <br>  I did enjoy how Mr. Goodell said this.... "As you know, part of this rule is to avoid having a reaction from opposing players and, from what I could see, only seeing it once, it didn't seem like it was anywhere near that," Goodell said. That's from ESPN.com<br>  <br>  I don't think he should of gotten fined. <br>  <br>  And the officiating wasn't poor... The worst call of the game came against the Steelers for their "apparent" holding in the endzone that ultimately gave the Cardinals 9 points. AZ fans should be thanking the refs for getting them back in the game.

13360f8150c9715c66a1ecb9c2002c6aaa	Bruce lee concept "the strongest weapon hand /foot should be the closest to the opponent to shorten striking distance"<br>  <br>  Other than that gem right hand lead is more condusive to shooting in for a leg lift take down and many throws where the combatants are not holding on to each as in judo.|`|tQGRJBYAaa	It's better utilized in MMA then boxing or some people (like me) are left foot kickers/spinners but right handed so you can better trick the opponent.|`|Vrd8gB61aa	well if u want to be a good martial artist u need to be good with both sides. Plus there are different concepts for the diff sides.<br>  <br>  Let's assume ur right handed.(most likely to be stronger)<br>  <br>  so ur right hand is behind u left hand in front. ur right hand can cross and have a lot of power.<br>  Or u could fight southpaw with ur stronger hand in front. So u can jab and it will be strong and solid. wouldn't u want to have ur stronger hand to block.<br>  <br>  That is just one way to look at it.<br>  Or u can just be a good fighter and fight both ways.|`|nRBC4E5saa	Some are natural left-handers, like Anderson Silva, but others like Rich Franklin are right handed but will fight southpaw.  This is largely due to a wrestling background, where one leads with ones dominant side, similar to fencing.  The idea is that you want your best side forward in order to "shoot" in for a takedown.  When Matt Hughes fought GSP for the third time, he led southpaw, abandoning his striking game and just searching for a takedown.  I'm a righty and fight right-side forward due not only to this, but to the JKD influence, where Bruce Lee emphasized having your strong side forward for striking.<br>  <br>  Also, since boxing has a bit more politics and lefty fighters are more difficult to fight against, many left handed fighters just can't get fights.  Guys like Mike Tyson will usually convert to a left lead.
e4ekb1amaa	You guys are ignoring the first and most important role a corner has - covering his assignment. You can't judge a cornerback by how many interceptions he gets because the best cornerbacks don't have the opportunity to get interceptions - they don't allow their guy to be open enough to get targetted.<br>  <br>  Asomugha is currently the best corner in the game. The reason why he has so few INT's is because no one dares to throw towards him. In 2007, he saw 35 passes come his way on the ENTIRE NFL season. That's 2.1 times per game. Of those 35 passes, he deflected 7, and intercepted 1. That means that of the 35 passes that went towards him, about 25% of them didn't even reach the receiver. Of those passes that Asomugha didn't manage to get his hands on, how many were probably caught? Even if all of them were, it still would mean that he only allowed 1.5 catches a game. More than likely, about half of them were, which would be less than 1 catch a game.... Think of how ridiculous that is.<br>  <br>   In 2008, I don't have the numbers in front of me, but I know that the number targets dropped down to 1 well past midseason. That means he completely locks up his side of the field, and QB's don't even get an inch to take a risk to throw to him more than 4% or so of their pass attempts - that's absolutely phenomenal. <br>  <br>  Think about the ramifications of this. It means that your defense can simply focus on the other CB's assignment, and rushing defense, and essentially ignore that side of the field. Asomugha is brilliant, and he doesn't get the recognition he deserves for exactly the reason why you're saying - people get too focused on stats. Champ Bailey has widely been named the best corner in the league, and yet he has been beaten deep consistently throughout his career. Likewise Asante Samuel has tenancy to try and jump routes and play the ball rather than cover his man and not allow a throwing opportunity. <br>  <br>  Asomugha is very special, and an incredible athlete. It's a shame hes stuck in Oakland. <br>  <br>  As far as the money goes, he would be the one corner in the league I'd be willing to pay that kind of money for. I do believe it's too much money, but I think he'd have taken a lot less to play for a good team, so the Raiders had to spend that much.|`|i0QzvbSnaa	He is a really good player, but dammmmmmn - is the Bay <br>  Area suddenly loaded or something. He went about $5 million a year over where I would have thought and I'd bet it was about $5 million over what he would have taken too.<br>  If Al wants a pissin contest, he needs to do it in a way that does not end up costing the other NFL owners and fans down the road. The only thing that I can think of is that Al-zheimer is on his last leg as owner and does not care anymore. Look at the economy, especially in Cali and try to justify this. Even if other owners can somehow push it aside during negotiations with other DBs, it will have franchise tag implications.|`|TJMpKqFNaa	It's a good start if you ask me.   CBs who can shut down one whole side of a field by themselves come along maybe once every 10 years and it's looked like Nnamdi might be that guy.<br>  <br>  At least the Raiders gave a boatload of money to a guy who is really good for a change instead of just overpaying for a name...|`|6KZgeq3Maa	Based on the deals that he gave Hall, Walker, and Gibril Wilson last year, I can't say I am surprised.  Asomugha is a great corner but i don't even think most QB's are worth that type of deal, yet alone a DB that teams can simply shy away from.|`|AOA8TJraaa	Damn!!! That much money!! That is WAY too much money, especially for a cornerback I would expect more money for Moss, Fitzgerald, Johnson, and Steve Smith. That is way too much money for a cornerback hands down.|`|8eaNfLEOaa	Doesn't really make sense when they could have franchised him this season for a little under 10 million.  <br>  <br>  His stats really aren't that impressive either (although he did have 10 INT's one year, I think in 2006), and he had (I think only 1) INT this year, but hands are Asomugha's strongsuit.<br>  <br>  Nnamdi Asomugha is the best shutdown corner in the league.  He doesn't let his receiver's get open.  He started for the Pro Bowl, with mediocre stats; but that is because he doesn't get INT's because the QB's don't throw his way, and he doesn't get a lot of tackles because his opponent doesn't get the ball.|`|jIONJZSJaa	I don't know if he's worth that much money, but look at what the Colts signed Kelvin Hayden to: 5yrs. $43 million.  If someone is getting overpaid, its Hayden.|`|6UHMxWKBaa	it is a bit much but Asomugha is probably the best cornerback in the NFL|`|6AfM6SWaaa	Crazy|`|a9U0aH54aa	that is way too much|`|XLXncQu9aa	Asomugha is a great CB however I really don't think he is worth that much money.  It shows that the Raiders are committed to him as a player but when you look at it, Asomugha only had 1 interception this past season.  He had 40 tackles in this past season, however 1 interception.  He also only has 10 interceptions in his career which is mediocre in that area of turn overs.  He's great as far as pass coverage, but he is no Champ Bailey.  I think this shows that players are overrated in terms of how much they produce. I mean why did he only have 1 interception last season? I think he is a great CB as far as tackling because he has shown he can wrap up the offensive player quickly which some CB's have trouble doing, but he isn't worth that much money based on his past stats as it relates to interceptions.  It seems to me he is a bit overrated.
4uSRVZNNaa	baseball (or all of sports for that matter) is no different than any other walk of life in that people lie, cheat and are dishonest to get what they want.  true the stakes are higher here.  this kid lied to the tune of millions of dollars. but this stuff happens every day in other walks of life.  the difference is that it doesn't make the daily papers or is on the news. <br>  <br>  now by no means does that justify any of this.  my point is that I am not surprised.  I hold no purist ideal when it comes to baseball/sports in general.  call it a kid's game if you want, but it ceased to be just a game long, long ago.  when you involve money in anything, not just sports, there will always be those who will cut corners and be unethical to get what they want.  <br>  <br>  on the specific subject of baseball, I am convinced that baseball never has been nor will ever truly be "clean."  before steroids, it was corked bats and doctored baseballs.  sure, they will eventually clean up the steroids mess but by then it will be something else or another way someone will find to cheat.  and as long as mlb can use it to put fannies in the seats and make money, then they will turn a blind eye until they are exposed.  <br>  <br>  maybe some think this is a pessimistic way to look at it.  but to me that is part of life.  it is a great thing to have ideals, but they must be tempered with a liberal dose of reality.|`|GfzaszPPaa	all boy!!! if is not drug use is lies or fake documents or cheating you know i'm getting sick of sports. maybe the media should just keep information like this on the low that way sports can be as excited and joy able as it was in the 90's and earlier.

If the guys got 4 kids and 2 ex-wives he's probably older than 16 (exaggeration). But I agree with you, enough. Too many people milking the MLB for money, once they sign a contract they give you a signing bonus, you take the signing bonus and don't even have to play. He was bragged up for being 16 and along comes the accolades. It's like getting a $2000 check from work and not showing up the next day. <br>  Check the kids age, recheck and check again-age faking has been a rumor about the DR for years. <br>  Just the thought of a 16 year old being talented enough to play in the major leagues can be enough for dishonesty and faking ages...MLB needs to check these things out.|`|HbTC1BBIaa	I dont even really care.

C6BfjkGpaa	I would go for the Harris-Aldridge trade.<br>  Devin Harris is playing some amazingly good basketball right now.<br>  <br>  As for the richardson-hamilton trade, if you want to be safe, keep hamilton.<br>  He has, and always will be a consistent player.<br>  Richardson is more of a player that has a couple really big games.|`|harkVzvkaa	don't do it, stay with your strengths if u trade adrige u might not stay ahead in boards and blocks|`|4wRVxL6Xaa	I think you should pull the Harris for Aldrige trade.. In my opinion anyway.. You already have Duncan and Nene and they will give you the rebounds that you need. You will also get good production from Lamar now that Bynum is out.. You can definitely benefit from it.<br>  <br>  Harris will bring your team up a bit and give youa  decent PG. Ramon Sessions is good but his FG% is very low. If you replace session with Harris and have Josh Howard as Util, your team might actually benefit.. Actually Ryan Gomes is going to do well also since Al Jefferson is hurt.. You should pull the trade..<br>  <br>  Trade Hamilton, JRich is going to score more and get your more 3s since you want to bring that up as well.

They have some similar mentalities in their characters, but they are not the same.<br>  <br>  p.s.

sZj8uzdFaa	Because then a bad team whose season is already lost can send it's 1 or 2 good players to a contender without receiving equal players back. Once a manager's team is beyond repair he may just help out his buddy who only needs a player or 2 to get over the hump. It's unfair to everyone else in the league.|`|6UHMxWKBaa	Don't want anyone ripping someone else off cuz that would ruin the league.|`|9dba8fd793d11e5dc0acb7b038cbfd7baa	Because most fantasy leagues aren't exclusively for experienced or beginner players, approval for trades helps to ensure that one manager is not "robbing" another manager.

Throw it straight down (and assuming the "bounce" is vertical) it will return to you.<br>  <br>  3.  Go to a point on the earth's surface where the line of latitude is less than the maximum range of your throw  (this will be close to either the North or South Poles).  Then, throw the ball either due East or due West.  Then (assuming no wind or other external factors) the ball will travel around the line of latitude and come back to you from the opposite direction in which you threw it.  <br>  So turn around to catch it otherwise it will hit you in the back of the head!|`|AA11215075	ok, now lets get down to business. sallow the golf ball and take it with some xlax and wait, the ball will hit the bottom of the tolit and you got your golf ball back. now give me my 10 points,,i just tried it but im waiting for the xlax to work.

LnJjS8BRaa	The process of turning a hide into leather removes elasticity from the skin. You do that to yourself and your skin may be tougher, but the elasticity that keeps it from tearing is diminished and you're probably more likely to end up bleeding all over the place.<br>  <br>  I don't even want to start getting in to the adverse health effects you'd probably end up with after treating live skin, especially on your face, to those chemicals. Skin cancer isn't worth the trouble.<br>  <br>  But here's the silver lining, as a troll, your skin is naturally thicker and tougher!|`|3BGJETHYaa	The best way to avoid bleeding is to not get hit.  Work on your footwork, blocking, and head movement.|`|AA12213253	You're better off learning how to avoid blows.|`|r5AMG8g7aa	Tannic acid is what you are asking about. But it is not recommended that you do ANYTHING to try to toughen your face. It is something you will live to regret. That is for sure.  As far as the comment someone made about using tea to toughen their feet. Tea has a chemical in it that helps stop bleeding. After having a tooth removed the dentist will many times tell you to bite down and hold a damp tea bag on the tooth socket if it begind to bleed.|`|9NDL5YQJaa	Putting black tea or Tannic Acid on your face is a BAD idea.  Blistered and burnt skin isn't going to help.<br>  <br>  The only thing you can do is get a good amount of sparring in.  If you bleed, you bleed, and you are just going to have to work through it.|`|3DnX9NmAaa	...Melanoma.|`|PZjmWdW8aa	exposure to cold weather will toughen the skin.<br>  also grow a beard.|`|JqUGmk3Paa	If you are going for MMA, you arent going to avoid bleeding... Some of the best fighters are natural bleeders... Some people bleed more, some bleed less.. You are never going to toughen your face to the point where an elbow to the forehead isnt going to split you open. It just happens.  Dont go getting punched in the face as much as you can either, that is actually counter-productive, considering the scar tissue you can form will open easier, and bleed more than otherwise.|`|13360f8150c9715c66a1ecb9c2002c6aaa	Dempsey was world champion and thus had good cause to do what he did.Do you have any hopes or chances of becoming a world champion anything ?<br>  Plus that will not protect you against bare knuckle blows to the face.|`|s4qOgi19aa	Five packs of Pall-malls a day for 20 years!<br>  Look at Keith richards, face like a catchers mitt! <br>  <br>  Seriously, head movement and good footwork!|`|100b7048a63bacdbd18d8ea89e6894a2aa	use cold black tea. It's what ballet dancers use to toughen the skin on their feet to stop them bleeding after going en pointe.|`|ci6f63Ifaa	Find the plastic surgeon that screwed up Mickey Rourke's face.|`|c73AAq22aa	Vaseline is good|`|Qn6ERwZcaa	Keep your hands up|`|ceiaGsLdaa	I've never heard of that, and I don't know if it would really work. I mean do you really want stuff that is used for tanning cow hides on your face? No, of course you don't.<br>  <br>  If you want to toughen up your face, you're going to just have to practice and take damage to your face. The reason most fighters can take so many punches and keep going is because they've been hit so many times throughout their lives.
OfNTLq3Qaa	Stone Cold had his neck severely injured in a match with Owen Hart. Before the injury, Austin could really put on a wrestling show but after the injury, he was lucky to even be able to walk.<br>  The neck injury and the fact he had bad knees forced him to retire in his prime. He could just no longer carry the load of a full WWE schedule.<br>  Plus Austin had legal problems outside of wrestling that also forced him to leave at various times.|`|sqfjfR3iaa	Injuries accumulated through 2 decades of wrestling.

His knees and his neck are in bad shape.|`|pbS2kVJcaa	Knees are in horrible shape and the next bump he took on his neck would put him in a wheelchair.<br>  Health reasons is what I heard. He had serious neck problems about 2 years ago. He had to have a second neck surgery. The reason I heard was because after the first one he didn't take it easy and take the time off needed, and re aggrivated it. Then one day/night he was wrestling and someone did a move which injured it and when he went back to the doctor he was told that if his neck had ANY more trauma, the likelihood of him being paralysed was extremely high. I heard him say in an interview that he was scheduled for a second neck surgery and that he would take all the time he had to to make sure it was really healed this time. And that at the time he didn't know how long it would take or if he would even be back. About 6 months later or so I heard he was coming back and he wrestled a few matches but on air it was said that all of those who wrestled him were told not to do anything to his neck or head. After that I didn't see him wrestle much, although he would make appearances occasionally. Shortly after that I pretty much stopped watching.<br>  I believe because his knees were getting to the point of no repair. Some don't want to go through the complcatios of surgery. He did that with his neck and almost did'n come back then.|`|AA11354286	He has a bad neck, two bad knees, and a bad back. If you watched his last match at WM 19, he had to will his self through that match. Austin just doesn't have the body or will to have to wrestle anymore.|`|6NVHuQAWaa	Both of his knees are practically useless. He also has reacurring neck problems.

a2c5c06fca81996e233e1a3ee41e964baa	Listen, i could tell you what rod and reel to buy, what baits to buy, but that isn't going to help you at all unless you know what you want to fish for. If you are like most beginners and you want to just fish for whatever untill you find a preference, your best bet is to go to a local wal-mart or something like that and get a rod and reel combo its called an "Ugly Stik" they are great poles and decent reels. And like i said it depends where you fish what your fishing for, its all a mess but your best bet as a beginner is to just grab a pole some worms maybe a few lures and just go fish around, try to find a few nice fishing holes or sweet spots around you, If you would like to talk more about it feel free to email me and i will help you if you want to get more specific. Createdbydefault @ Yahoo . com ... .Thanks and have fun.|`|bRXuAgCqaa	Walmart sells an Ugly Stik spinning reel combo,6' long for like $30.That'll do ya well until you get the hang of things.|`|XKdUGiwFaa	Check with your local library, they have books, videos, and magazines about fishing that can be very informative.  Best of all they are free.  The best knowledge comes from experience through trial and error.  Just get out there and enjoy it.  Good luck.|`|TeNIStN1aa	For spinning outfits, 6'6" medium action freshwater rod is a very popular configuration.<br>  <br>  For general freshwater and saltwater fishing, it will handle a very wide range of fish. It could handle small pan fish. It could handle pretty sizable fish. It will handle baits as well as lures. Simply put, you could do a little bit of everything with it.<br>  <br>  For spinning reels, Shimano IX series reels is one of the best buys out there. Actually, it is the smoothest spinning reel available within that price range. The reel is durable and fairly powerful for its size. You could spend over three times the price and you still might not be able to get similar performances. The reel could be used in both freshwater and saltwater. Shimano IX2000 will go well with a 6'6" freshwater spinning rod.<br>  <br>  For lines, 8lb test is a good weight for general fishing. There is no need to over spend on lines (yet). A spool of Berkley Trilene XT or XL will put you on water for quite a while.|`|AS5bLez1aa	Why don't you ask some friends or family if they might let you try out some of there rigs.One of the most important aspects of fishing is having fun,if you go out and buy equipment that you end up not liking you might miss out on some fun fishing outings.Once you establish which reel you are most suited for be it either a spinning or open face a spin cast,or a bait caster(which is usually for your more experienced angler)go on bass pro shops website and buy a combo set up they are are already balanced, they are having a big sale right now,just don't go out and buy a cheap Zebco 202, you are going limit what you can do.Good luck have fun fishing!|`|ICGQ9EBcaa	An Ugly Stik would be a good start paired with a 20$ spinning reel.  It wll give you a chance to fishing without getting bailout money from the govt. Also start watching fishing shows they have become more informative over the past few years then they were when i was a kid. Talk to family and friends that might fish for some tips. If you live within an hour drve of a Bass Pro Shops the staff there can help set you up with an economic rig and at times they have seminars of various angling subjects.

I own a couple Zebco's, and Shakespeares. They are great.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope i helped ya out.|`|Kg15knZgaa	Greatly depends on what you're fishing for. I guess something general would be a medium-light action rod around 6', Zebco spincast reel ( great for beginners and make it so you don't have to deal with knots in your line when learning to cast ) and for line... If you're fishing for panfish and small trout then you could use some 6lb test Stren, or if you're bass and catfishing go with some 10lb test+.
