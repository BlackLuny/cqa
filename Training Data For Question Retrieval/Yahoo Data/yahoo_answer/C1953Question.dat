20090219185724AAnkenY	Consumer Electronics;Cell Phones & Plans	How hard is it to use iPhone for Senior Citizens?	My mother has a Pink Motorola RAZR cell phone (the flip fone style) with camera on it, and all the bells and whistles.  She has a tough time hearing people on it (due to it's shape and size) and can't work most of the features.  She has had the phone for at least 3 years (maybe more) and the contract she signed is up for renewal.  She is thinking about getting another phone and has asked my thoughts on the new iPhone.  I say if you can't use a Razr then there's not a good chance that you can use iPhone.  She is in her 60's and has problems seeing keys and buttons and stuff like that.  What do you think?  Will an iPhone help her? or will she be lost trying to use it.        For what it's worth, the main features on a phone that she uses are camera, text, and basic phone calling.

20090203112008AA6WC2l	Consumer Electronics;Music & Music Players	Ipod touch turning on?	first of all i wont to start by saying, i look all over the web and haven't found anything about this.    so here the problem.....   yesterday my Ipod wasn't working good, and it hasn't been working good awhile, so what i decided to do was go to setting and restart everything.   i click conformed, and disappointed when i read a pop up that it was going to take 4 hours.  So i went to bed and figured i catch up with it after school the next day.      So it is today, after school, we got out early cause of da snow storm. i go to my Ipod touch and it is already on. But the only thing is it the apple on the screen with black back round.  (the loading screen) usually this would be a good thing unfortunate, these screen has been up for 16 hours. So i did a hard restart (hold home button and off button) but the loading screen stay on and doesn't change.      so next what i thought of was plug the usb plug in restart it from itunes, but it doesn't find the ipod. So what do i do, go to my laptop, but still doesn't find it. hmmm i think to myself that no problem and i go back to my desktop and do control panel bla bla bla so it would be able to find it. BUT IT STILL DOESN'T      any tips/help u can give me would be greatly imprecate.   thank you and have a very pleasant day.

In August of last year I got the Samsung Instinct through Sprint.  I absolutely hate this phone.  It is so fragile and I am not a fragile person.  I am a clutz.  I am more interest in a flip phone where it's less likely for the "important" screen to be safe.  I was wondering if Sprint has any kind of service that they will allow you to swap out the phone you don't like?  Perhaps a downgrade?  If I were to change my phone my plan would change as well.  Any help would be appreciated.
