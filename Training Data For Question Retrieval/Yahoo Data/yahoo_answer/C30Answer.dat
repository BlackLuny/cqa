QOyuFSvwaa	Those are some detailed plans, I like the idea...of course it's possible, but getting anywhere will take enormous amounts of effort so I hope you are willing to struggle. <br>  <br>  There are a multitude of paths to becoming a US Senator, because in reality anyone (30 or over) can be elected to the post, all they have to do is demonstrate how they are the best choice to represent the state. So be sure, as I mentioned, to place all the effort you can into succeeding in the positions you reach, whether it be chamber of commerce, mayor, or any other position. Show your hard work, your devotion to the common and greatest good, and the real contributions you can make, and you're sure to claim the seat. (I'm an idealist like that, I like to think it doesn't take political brown-nosing and corruption to get somewhere)<br>  <br>  As someone who also wants to go into policy administration, and Congress, I applaud your long-term goals, especially at this age. Keep pushing and I'm sure you'll succeed.

AA11163314	The government is going to borrow the money.  The pool of money they will be borrowing from is the capital and investment market.  This market is where financing (in the form of stock and loans) for new businesses and business expansion comes from.<br>  <br>  In effect every dollar spent on the spending bill is one dollar less for new job creation.|`|WpA7n8Iwaa	The bottom line is that most of this "money" is fictitious and it really is just going to be tacked on to our already huge National debt.  Other governments, like the guy said who mentioned China, buy US bonds and so, in a sense, give the US money to get more in debt.  But they want a return on their investment.  So, again, the National debt takes the hit.  This kind of policy generally leads to hyper-inflation.  <br>  <br>  It's not a clueless question at all because very few people understand how the US can run when it has no ability to pay it's debt off.

2rcSILkWaa	Let me Google that for you.....|`|NiuYkbGMaa	How a bill goes through Congress and becomes a law can be a very complex procedure, or it can zip through Congress if it is considered very important that it be enacted. Basically, here are the steps from bill to law.<br>  In the House, any member may introduce a bill by dropping it into a box, called a hopper. In the Senate, a member may introduce a bill after being recognized by the presiding officer and announcing the bill’s introduction. (Bills dealing with raising money must originate in the House of Representatives.) The bill is then given a prefix and a number. H.R. 33 would be House Resolution 33 and S.B. 44 would be Senate Bill 44. Once a bill is introduced, it goes to a committee for study. The committee in the Senate or the House basically do the same thing, that is they study the bill, hold hearings on the content of the bill, send it to a subcommittee if they feel it necessary for more study, and then vote on it and report it to the floor of the Senate or House where it is placed on the calendar for action. The House and Senate then debate the bill and vote on whether to pass or reject the bill. Most bills never get out of commitee. Once a bill is passed by either house, it has to be in the exact same language and set up. If a bill passes the Senate but it is not exactly as the one that passes the House, a conference committee is created to work out the final wording of the bill. It then goes back the each house where it is voted on again in its new form. The bill is then sent to the President. The President can sign the bill into law, veto it and return it to Congress with his objections to the bill, or do nothing. If he vetoes the bill, the Congress may override the veto by a two-thirds majority vote in both houses. It then becomes law without the approval of the President. The President has ten days to sign or veto the bill. If, after ten days, Congress is not in session, the bill does not become law. This is known as a pocket veto.|`|ISMWh4Zaaa	well i know this much...there is a time when its being put together when the lobbysts go to work on the politicians and shape the bill to look like the way they want it to.

XpUF9f1Saa	The Democratic-Republican party was Thomas Jefferson's party. He was the He was the secretary of State, and a plantation owner that was later elected 3rd president. It generally believed in less federal government, and more state freedoms. It had joiners, because it favored the "common man" (the farmers). The south supported it, and it later became replaced the Democratic Party. Libertarian<br>  <br>  The Federalist Party was a party started by Alexander Hamilton. He was secretary of the Treasury under Washington. He was a rich banker, and was talented in economics. The party mainly received support from New England, and believed that the national government should have power, and that only landowning, literate, educated white men should get the vote. (As you guessed, it favored the educated and the richer). It favored a national bank. The party saw it's demise when Alexander Hamilton died, and was replaced by the Whigs, who had a different platform, then the Whig party demolished and became the republicans. Authoritative.<br>  <br>  That's the simplest run-down for you! You should know a lot more, if you wanted to write an essay, though.<br>  <br>  Interesting thing, both parties became very different.

But since the turn of the 20th century, federalism has run amok.|`|XowM9e7Naa	The Federalists inherited the position of the old Tories when we were a colony.  They believed in a strong central government.  Their opponents were the Whigs, somewhat like today's Republicans.  When the Federalist party collapsed, They were succeeded by the Republican Party (Democratic-Republicans, later called the Democrats).  In the 1850's the Whig party went into a decline.  There was a need for an anti-slavery party.  A new party was formed which was called the Republican party.  Early party lines were drawn differently in a country where most people earned their income from agriculture.  Factions were the Eastern shipping and fishing interests, the manufacturing interests, the Southern planters, the small Southern farmers, the Norther farmers, and the Western farmers.|`|CVVl4U4caa	Federalists-Modern Day Republicans.<br>  Democratic Republicans-Modern Day Democrats. <br>  The confusing thing is, that although they are called the same names, they actually had a differentiation in beliefs then what the party does today.

ohUm00RYaa	Basically this is hwo trade works.  Imagine trade between some 3rd world country like mali and the USA.<br>  <br>  Now USA can build, grow, or create anything.  Mali can basically only grow cotton, they barely have roads, do not build airplanes, or buses, or all that fancy stuff american can build.<br>  <br>  So basically USA subsidizes or gives farmers in america of cotton free money to lower the price of cotton in america.  So people in Mali say wtf. Wtf are we suppose to sell, we don't have metal, or electricty or all that fancy mumbo jumbo you need to build an airplane or a car.  The WTO won't stop the us government from subsidizing farmers so third world nations are basically blocked out from trade.<br>  <br>  What ends up happening is that the USA will actually sell cotton to mali because no one in mali can even find a job and they becoem dependent on aid.  All a third world country can do is farm and the USA and EU and western nations all subsidize their farm products to the point it is near impossible for thrid world countries to benefit from free trade.  All that happens is that the developed contries sell high technology like air planes to mali but mali can't sell back, so they get poorer|`|QOyuFSvwaa	Although the WTO is intended as a positive force (I encourage you to visit www.wto.org to see their own statments), its regulations can sometimes impede individual countries' policies, which makes forming effective policies more difficult. <br>  <br>  The WTO also promotes "free" trade, which is designed to end favoritism in trade agreements and "level the playing field" for countries, so to speak. Critics, though, claim that these policies favor wealthier nations that already have the economic "weight" to trade heavily, while poor countries get left behind and can't compete in such a highly competitive environment. <br>  <br>  Both sides in the argument have valid points. For a pro-globalization and WTO perspective, visit their site and read "The World is Flat" by Thomas Friedman. For a more critical view of the WTO, as a counterbalance to the other sources, I recommend "The Future in Balance" by Walden Bello.

MnbMpzaoaa	President: two terms.  Or 1 term and more than 1/2 of your predecessor's term if the vice-president assumes the presidency because of death, removal, or resignation.<br>  <br>  No other executive branch term limits exist.  But usually the cabinet positions expire with the president.  Any future president can reappoint them. <br>  <br>  State governors may have limits, usually two consecutive terms then they can run again.  But it varies from state to state.

He made a campaign of cutting federal spending in all areas besides the military and he had this dream of balancing the budget in 4 years.

The navy tho also has it's place because they are vital to the protection of america.

AA11615216	R&R leave and Emergency leave truly varies on the situation of the soldier.  One of my friends last April went into labor and had serious complications...she was in ICU for 3 weeks and the baby was in the NICU for about 2 months.  The red cross did contact her husband but he was not allowed to return home, even with BOTH their lives in danger.  He did get his scheduled R&R later on, but they could not send him home when the emergency happened. Unless his leave in set already around your due date, don't plan on him being there for the birth.|`|ABmZYbDZaa	They will NOT send a red cross message until AFTER you deliver. They will need the Service Members full name, SS #, location and unit. They will ask for your info, your doctors info, the babies info (name, weight,length, time/date of birth and status)  and the hospitals info. They will confirm that the baby had been born and his/her status. They will then pass that info on to the unit for them to give to him.  Unless there are complications and there is a life or death situation there is little to no chance he will get emergency leave for the birth of the baby. <br>  <br>  I have never seen anyone get pushed ahead of others for R&R simply because their wife just had a baby. Nor have  ever seen it qualify someone to take R&R immediately when it isn't their turn or time to do so.  If he knows when about you're supposed to deliver he can ask to try and take R&R at that time but other than that there is NO guarantee that he will be able to.<br>  <br>  ETA: Since I am getting nasty emails... Having been not been deployed has NOTHING to do with knowing if it will effect his R&R or not. Having been an FRG leader for 2-15 month deployements and also having numerous friends who've had babies while their spouses where deployed and as I CLEARLY stated I have never seen it effect someone's status on the R&R list nor have I seen it move them/get them immediate  to the head of the line. I did NOT state that it was regulation or the norm I stated it was what I have seen/experienced as everyone else has also stated their experiences.<br>  <br>  ETA: WHERE Did I say I did???? NO WHERE that's where.....  I say that I have ever never SEEN it happen. Key WORD SEEN! <br>  <br>  UGH! Some people SERIOUSLY need to get over it already. This "just a spouse" crap is beyond old already. I did NOT claim first hand deployed knowledge. PLEASE read and comprehend before bitching about things.  I said that I'VE SEEN not "It's  the regs"  or "It always happens this way or that way" Whatever....you know I'm starting to think you're no better than the ones that you bitched about in your prior supposed question about people staying in their lane.|`|AA11313983	Birth of a child does not qualify him for emergency leave.  It does, however, qualify him to take his R&R immediately.|`|KSizZYZEaa	I have to agree with others in getting emergency leave unless something very bad happens is not going to happen since many people do not see a child born while in duty in Iraq. I would have to say your husband will most likely get R&R over anything else. Also the command could be asses and refuse his R&R as I am not aware of any specific law for husbands to get leave in the case of child birth. Also if R&R has already been used then the command does not have to and will most likely refuse any further leave to see the birth of a child.|`|e205d688e231b13af75443c794fc1564aa	You having a baby is not considered a Red Cross Emergency.  The Red Cross will convey the message but he won't be coming home.  If his R&R happens to coincide that would be awesome.  He can only leave for Emergency Leave for an Emergency which the military usually defines as impending death or death of an immediate family member.|`|Dxxz5s7Vaa	Unless there are complications you don't get emergency leave for the birth of a baby.  Emergency leave is for a death or serious illness to an immediate family member.<br>  <br>  If he has dates for R and R already they can try to adjust them but don't get your hopes up.<br>  <br>  ARMY WIFE exactly you have no first hand knowledge and never seen how R and R can be swapped around.  FRG doesn't always have the full scoop of what goes on especially when you are out in Iraq doing missions.  I don't know if you got other emails but I just asked if you were ever in or deployed if you considered that nasty than that is you.  I was a simple question just verifing if you had first hand knowledge or not and you don't.<br>  <br>  Of course if you never been you can't see.  You need to calm down.  You are getting crazy about something and I think it is because you didn't like being called out.  Stay in your lane.|`|l4N0FJ3Yaa	The red cross message will get to him and his chain of command very quickly and as the other responders have told you, this does not qualify as an emergency. However, if the chain of command has been informed of this for quite some time, when it comes time to send people home, this situation always has priority, that much I do know. That is where the red cross message comes in handy, people that have really sick family members, custody issues or will be having a child and this also depends on the chain of command, those people are already at the top of the list for people going on R & R. For instance, when I was deployed the first time, there were 3 expecting fathers and luckily none of their babies were due around the same time. It was put out that when it was your time to go home, if their child was being born and unless you had already bought tickets for something, that person would bump you and you would go on leave as soon as possible. But tell your spouse not to sit on this issue because they only get so many slots per month to go home and if you are due in a certain month they will already slot him for that month and adjust accordingly. But most of all, be patient.

Dxxz5s7Vaa	ADD/ADHD<br>  Under the old standards, any history of ADD or ADHD was disqualifying. While waivers were sometimes possible, they were among the hardest categories of waivers to get approved. Under the new standards, ADD/ADHD is disqualifying only if the applicant has been treated with ADD/ADHD medication within the previous year and/or they display signs of ADD/ADHD. For applicants with a previous history of ADD/ADHD who have been off medication for more than one year, and they do no demonstrate significant impulsivity or inattention during MEPS processing, the MEPS examining official may find them qualified for military service without submission of a waiver.<br>  <br>  Records review is still required. Any history of being evaluated or treated for ADD/ADHD must be documented. As a minimum, all treatment (if any) within the previous three years must be submitted to MEPS, in advance, as part of the medical pre-screening. Full medical records are required if the applicant was ever treated for ADD or ADHD with any medication other than Ritalin, Adderal, or Dexedrine, or if there were any additional psychiatric symptoms, such as, but not limited to, depression.<br>  <br>  MEPS may require school transcripts to demonstrate acceptable academic performance for the year without medication. If treatment for ADD/ADHD occurred throughout the school environment, but wasn’t stopped until after the applicant left school, there is still the possibility of waiver consideration.|`|gDSJpRvTaa	Yes it will keep him from enlisting...<br>  End of Story...|`|n2oEhdZiaa	A history of ADD is workable.

Even if I agreed with the program (and I sure a hack don't), the money takes away form investing in capital.

The best advice I can give is to have the mother consult an attorney as they would know more about these situations than a normal Yahoo Answers user would.  Good luck with this.|`|HlYzvJ51aa	Nope, after signing over your rights you have 10 days to recant your signature after that all rights are lost and can not be reclaimed for any reason.

It is good to try and be better, but it is bad if the attempt is a single individual run up as the party's diversity leader for the past 8 years while nothing substantial happens to transform their policy proposals or inclusion within the party to reflect that.  4. It still took too long.  5. Hopfully this isn't just a political ploy and actually reflects substance and understanding.  6. Republicans did make David Duke all crazy...so yeah that's cool.|`|CmG8oTH0aa	I wonder if Michael Steele will bring "Change".|`|AA11847612	I agree that he was a good pick.    I disagree with your characterization that the Republican party is full of racists. Actually, check that. I disagree that your implication is that the Democratic party doesn't have their fair share of racists.|`|2bf7b1928da0ba8574b96d3c8eb7ff68aa	I saw Michael Steele on Bill Maher.

Sounds racist to me.  You must have been at Obama's $170 million (taxpayer funded) party in celebration of the fact that his skin color is a shade or two darker than that of his opponents.    Also, FYI: Republicans freed the slaves, ended Segregation, advanced civil rights, etc.  Prior to Obama's election, they had advanced women and minorities to higher positions of power than Democrats had (Secretaries of State, Supreme Court Justices, etc.).    I personally think Michael Steele is not the optimal candidate and that he was chosen only for his skin color.  If he were Caucasian with identical political positions in the current political climate, he would not have become the GOP chair. His nomination was a racist political move (as are many of Obama's appointees), yet you celebrate it as the antithesis of racism.  In addition, his stance on the second amendment is weak, at best, which will not go over well with those who hold their Constitutional rights dear.|`|tA8T4QYFaa	So far he tends to just be a speaking box for the existing old positions.    So it could have been anybody. The Republicans needed somebody with some new ideas.|`|7c5d1a76836b7ed2ed52eb7c751f6331aa	Agreed. Michael Steele is great!|`|1219d6000cca01c9f3c4489d1c7b4a16aa	I agree with your intentions, racists won't rush to sign up and join a party that is chaired by a minority.

I have been watching Steele for awhile.  He has been in consideration before Obama was elected.  My husband is Mexican and says Dems are the true racists    http://www.nationalblackrepublicans.com/...    I liked Steele's message about not going against his conservative views, but bringing his views to other races.|`|FhKfyxWlaa	I think your entire post is racist.  That's what I think. I am tired of the assumption that Republicans are the racist party.  I think that Powell and Rice would agree.  Steele is hardly the first African American Republican.  This entire post reeks of ignorance.|`|45cb74f9b5bb495b15a6f3f0a1d5c694aa	I disagree.  IMO Steele was chosen only because he is black, certainly not because of anything he has accomplished in life.  As such they think they can use him to be the attack dog without their party being called racist.  I think that is pathetic, but typical, Republican BS.  This from the party that gave McCain Sarah Palin as a running mate.

They are pandering to blacks just like the Democrats.  White people are no longer relevant in politics.|`|axeuS4zJaa	Yes, I believe he is a good start but not because of the fact he is black. I believe he is intelligent and qualified for the job.  The Democrats have been taking the minority vote for granted for years but it's not the Republicans duty to beg and educate the blacks into voting for them. Liberals hate anyone with a different view, so just because a black man is head of the GOP will hardly change any of their closed-minds. We already know this.|`|qlduZDO3aa	Agree, it will be good for America when racists do not instinctively look to either party for representation.|`|uemkazVZaa	Disagree.    The GOP needs to take some time to reorganize its party.  This was a hair-brained idea.  It is my understanding that it took six votes in order for this assignment to pass.      The Republicans are definatily not popular this year.  My advice - take three to six months and find out what went wrong and what can be done to correct it.  Then find a true leader (for your party).|`|Q5D4CRFkaa	I don't like Steele, so I would have to say I disargee.|`|AA11042590	Republicans are so brilliant.

If you mean cloning of parts, like a replacement muscle or nerves, I'd be very happy to have that done in the event that I needed it.    In terms of cloning a whole person, there is a practical reason that it's not a good idea. While the clone would develop as a baby then as a child, the cloned DNA is already aged. The effect is that the life expetency of the clone would equal the remaining life expectancy of the donor. That is, if you are 70 and cloned yourself, your clone would live only a few years.

When two people reproduce the offspring gets a mix of genetic material from both parents.  Some traits are good, some traits are bad.  But, regardless, they are different.  Based on the advancement of the species, it could be argued that the best traits tend to outlast the weaker traits (Darwinism).    However, what does cloning do?  It freezes the genetic map to be exactly the same as the prior offspring.  There is no advancing of the species and, worse, there is no change in the genetic map.    Germs prey on humans and it is up to our immune systems, through the variety in our genetics, to repel them.  If we all have the same genetic map and same immune system, all it would take is 1 germ (of the right caliber) to wipe out the species.  This is the biggest shortcoming for cloning.

Back in 2005, Jews left Gaza. And after this, Hamas was voted in & then they started shooting into Israel regularily.    And Hamas (Just like Hezbolla does) shoots from civilians, using civilian sheilds. (This is one of their schemes to accuse Israeli's of murdering civilians.)    Basically, those terrorist we are attacking now, during Obama's Presidency also accuse US of killing many civilians.    So if we (the US) would denounce Israel for something that is a false accusation, we would be guilty of cursing Israel. And he LORD has promised that those who bless Israel will be blessed. And those who curse Israel will be cursed.    Now we were guilty already of pressuring Israely settlments in Gaza of leaving Gaza. And so when they did, Hurrican Katrina hit US & took the same amount of land.  Plus, when Hurrican Katrina was heading toward US, my home town Church where I grew up were interceding in prayer for the Hurrican to turn.  But one young lady fell in a trance & saw a sword hit Israel & divide its land. Then a vision of a sword hit the US & divide land. And she heard when coming out of the trance the words, "Land for land!". And she shared this with all praying. And they knew that Hurrican Katrina would hit. That was the LORDs answer.  http://www.gatewayrevival.org    Also, Kim Clement & his wife were in New Orleans and he & his wife had to leave since they sensed a death.

Further more, Michael Steele was elected despite the fact that he is black. Obama was elected because of this fact. Also, the man you hate most in the world, George W. Bush, had two black people holding high positions while he was in office. It's disgusting how you believe the only reason Steele was elected was to "copy" the Democrats, as if he is unqualified elsewhere (like Obama). Who is the real racist?|`|lAuIxO1Jaa	Michael Steele is a well spoken gentleman, regardless of what his color is.      TYPICAL for a liberal to call it out...I swear that liberals do NOT want anyone of color to succeed, only to keep them down and on the tit.      Condoleezza Rice is the classiest lady on the world, I have admired her for YEARS.      Have you noticed there are loads of black republicans?  Also, Lincoln was a Republican...

wyAtVqbOaa	Yes if you do get married your new husband will be able to adopt your children BUT you will need permission from the father who is on the birth certificate, regardless whether he is on the scene or not and if he says no, then you can take it to court and see if the court will override his answer, this though, very rarely gets done.      This happened to my friend, luckily for her he said yes.  By the way, all three of you will have to speak to a councillor about your feelings etc to the change and Social Services will see if the child will benefit from it.  Sucks I know but apparently the child may well become "who am I really" from the change.  Jamie, the boy in question, always thought that he was his "dad's" son so they had a hard time explaining to him that "dad" wasn't biological dad but that "dad" wanted to adopt him, even though he had "dad's" surname.  Poor kid was confused but it turned out well for him.    Good luck in the future.|`|70e9d9eee37ee3f1f4008f4ae6b92dc8aa	In almost every case, the biological father must be contacted and give his permission and relinquish his own parental rights whether he is on the birth certificate or not.    In very few cases, if it can be proven that the biological father has, "abandoned," the child, having no physical or verbal contact or payment of child support, etc., the court MAY order termination of the father's parental rights.|`|z88IMXNFaa	The fathers would each have to terminate their parental rights.|`|oOR511mFaa	Yes, their real father needs to relinquish his parental rights to the children and then he is free to adopt them.|`|42910e399cf1ff7bf1eb16843000fb5eaa	Well the one who's name is on the birth certificate would have to sign away his parental rights, I don't know about the other one. If I were to assume I would say no.|`|RkfIPD7Iaa	A new father cannot adopt unless the biological father agrees.    No name on the birth certificate means nothing (I ask again, why do women do this pointless and selfish act?).  In fact, the lack of a name will confuse the issue because you will need to establish paternity before any adoption can go forward.|`|96a318bea85eb2aa7d0b38b893875fb9aa	Yes, you need the permission of both fathers, despite their abscence.|`|5oIpfes5aa	Yes he can. My friend was adopted by her mum's new husband.    I'm not sure about the permission thing. I would think yes, especially for the known one. Though the lack of contact could mean no. I suggest you read up on it.|`|c67a2f77ab7471bed4b2f279ff05e2e1aa	If a father is mentioned on the birth certificate, he has a right to refuse to allow his child/ren to be adopted. He does have to give permission. If the other father were to apply to have his name added to the relevant certificate, and it was granted, he, too, would have power to veto such an adoption.|`|ucYwexwJaa	yes, unfortunately the United States doesn't recognize mothers as being the supreme ruler of the family matriarch.  Fathers actually retain their status as "father" unless they're so spiteful of you that they'd never want to be near you, even if it meant giving up their kids and signing them over to the new daddy.    **edit** wow, you even proved my point by adding in the other details to your question and claiming it's "unfair" because it doesn't make you happy.  LOL!! It's too bad we can't give you away to another family, sounds like you are one spiteful b*tch.|`|yqAwWO4uaa	I believe they need to relinquish their parental rights.  There may be a way to give them notice and if they don't respond I believe the courts will declare that they have given up that right.  however, without a court order there is no way to legally adopt the children.|`|2xO8AxYRaa	That really depends on the laws in your state. Some states when there has not been contact made in over a year you can go to court and get his rights taken away and then the new spouse can adopt.|`|2a9MLpZRaa	no. He can't.  Your kids already have a father.  I understand you have some aggression you want to act out on this man that you no longer love, but please don't involve your children in that.|`|fa38e842848a4d4d0e66c24701940524aa	When you go to a Court to apply for formal Adoption, they will ask about the biological father, including a former husband who might not have been the actual biological father, but due to marriage is legally deemed the father.      You're going to have to either demonstrate that no one has parental rights as a father to begin with, or that those rights are or should be terminated.     Your allegation that they've had no involvement is evidence if proven, but not a conclusion.      I suggest a lawyer that knows this area of the law, it'll save you money in the long run.    ** It's not "unfair" that they have the right to say "no," what would be unfair is if one person could terminate the rights of another without giving them an opportunity to be heard by an impartial decider.

Lethal injection as opposed to having your body wracked by either of these diseases is a no brainer.  Why don't you try using yours sometime?|`|kPNnfjNSaa	I think it would be highly unethical, and extremely vulnerable to abuse. (Prisons are too corrupt. No prisoner would have the "choice".)    I also think that it'd be a waste of time, since I believe those diseases have been cured already, and the cures are not available to the public. (Medical system would go bankrupt if it weren't for the "non-curable" terminal illnesses.)|`|jLboQqC8aa	They are human beings even though criminals and not lab rats.|`|bda08b314a4966c36d4acd161c9ec0f6aa	So the options would be to die now or to die later since there is no cure for AIDS or most cancers. I don't think anyone would be cured or have their sentence commuted to life. Also many prisoners have been freed from death row because of DNA evidence, if they agreed to your option for life they would be dead any way because of the AIDS and cancer. Not much of a choice.|`|X6RwSrJjaa	Oh yes, we should force them to do **** like that. I have been saying that for years. They are of no benefit to society being in prison. This way there is at least some reason to keep them alive. Experimental Surgery is another example of **** we need to be doing. Also.. if we do this ****.. maybe people will understand that you have a productive role to play in society. If you chose not to play  that role... then society will force that role upon you.|`|Ra24OqXXaa	Our nation began to gain so much power that we began to think that we had the right to chose when someone should die. No matter how harsh the crime, we do not have that place. These people have to stand in judgment for their actions, so why do we have the place to serve them any type of justice
GcOWoAmSaa	Yes. Losers who smoke weed are still losers, and good people who smoke weed are still good people. This drug war hysteria is tearing America apart and the sooner it stops the better off we will be. I don't think smoking weed made Michael Phelps the fastest swimmer in the world, but it obviously didn't stop him from it. But if he would have got busted, the law, not the weed, would have destroyed Michael Phelps just to prove they can stop a weed smoker from being great.    Most Americans who are for banning marijuana call themselves Christians, yet they apparently have never even read the first chapter of the first book of the Bible. Genesis 1:29 clearly said God gave us every seed bearing plant on the whole earth. Any government that takes away from the people that which God has given the people is going against God and will have to change or that government will eventually fall. The question is, how much damage to good people will that government do before being corrected?|`|LzPhdri5aa	Well from a purely neutral perspective...it is a strong point in favor.|`|AA12066574	I'm so amused at how the potheads are coming out of the woodwork, now.

Daschle has been a paid consultant and advisor to Hindery's InterMedia Partners since 2005, during which time he received from Hindery access to a limousine and chauffeur. Daschle reportedly did not declare this service on his annual tax forms as required by law. A spokeswoman for Daschle said that he "simply and probably naively" considered the use of the car and driver "a generous offer" from Hindery, "a longtime friend."[37][35][25][38] Daschle told the Senate Finance Committee that in June 2008 -- just as he was letting the press know he would like to be HHS secretary in an Obama administration[30] -- that "something made him think that the car service might be taxable" and he began seeking to remedy the situation.[39]    Daschle reportedly also did not pay taxes on an additional $83,333 that he earned as a consultant to InterMedia Advisors in 2007; this was discovered by Senator Daschle's accountant in December 2008.[39] Daschle also revised his deductions to remove $14,963 in charitable donations that he made between 2005 and 2007. Several Native American charitable organizations that Daschle had contributed to were revealed to not have kept proper records of many donations, and thus the deductibility of these donations was in question.    The former Senator paid the three years of owed taxes and interest -- an amount totaling $140,167 -- in January 2009.[37][40][38][39] He still reportedly owes "Medicare taxes equal to 2.9 percent" of the value of the car service he received, amounting to "thousands of dollars in additional unpaid taxes."[41]    On Tuesday, February 3, 2009, Daschle withdrew his name from nomination for the HHS Secretary position, saying that he did not wish to be a distraction to the Obama agenda.[2]|`|LzPhdri5aa	Bush was often praised for his loyalty to his henchmen despite their activities, including Scooter Libby.

Women have to undergo dangerous hormone therapy to get the eggs out to fertilize . . . what is a fertilized egg?  A zygote, what is a zygote?  It's a baby.  You're creating lives to destroy them to maybe have a small chance of saving another life.    Not all embryonic stem cell research is unethical.  A woman who miscarries can donate the baby's body for research.  May I point out to you that of all the research that has been done with stem cells that embryonic is the only one that has not yielded any progress.    There have been incidences in different parts of the world where people are able to walk again after spinal cord injuries . . . thank you adult stem cells!    This may be an interesting article for you:  http://www.lifesitenews.com/ldn/2006/jul...    I actually caught part of this guy's presentation on EWTN, I was very impressed on how in depth and thorough his presentation was.  Most of what you hear on the news and other open sources is frivolous information trying to confuse the public as to what stem cell research really is.  That (I believe) is why the proposition passed in Missouri to legalize certain stem cell research.  The proposition was written to confuse the public and make it sound like a charitable thing.  Unless you were very well versed in what the research was, you'd have no clue as to what the proposition was actually saying.    Check out that article, though, hopefully this nation can become more prolife some day so that we can focus our research on something more worth while.|`|AA12103453	It already is. It was never illegal. Perhaps you are thinking of EMBRYONIC stem cell research. I wish people would either learn what they are talking about or be more clear. Adult stem cells are legal for research.

Only Embryonic research has been an issue.|`|5ypdHLtGaa	I think so. I think that people are confusing killing an unborn baby with stem cell research. No one is encouraging abortion so that we can start using all the fetuses. They are using embryos that were left over from invitro and going to be destroyed anyway. why waste soemthing that has the potential to cure people...   anyone catch that article last week? the FDA finally approved clinical trials on a stem cell drug that is supposed to help cure paralysis caused by spinal cord injury..|`|f08acadf20db255caa972f1c2ebf2c7eaa	Yep !

AA10621418	many states, but not all require attorneys to do pro bono work.  Those that dont, strongly suggest it.  Just be careful---one common thing that dirtbags that give the rest of us a bad name do is take on an immigration case, do most of the work, then say that they need x amount of money or they cant finish.  Doesnt happen often, but be careful|`|Hpctd5Pgaa	Hell to the NO!! Dude, if a lawyer wants to do all of that research for you for free, then by all means let them!

For some the primary reason might be for the sake of experience and sharpening their skills.    Others it's a matter of community service or dedication to a specific cause.    Attorneys also receive tax breaks/deductions by donating a certain amount of their time to pro bono cases annually.    For whatever the reason, the intention is usually admirable.|`|01669e8c4403fe7fd458f8bdcb56e56aaa	Not necessarily.  Some lawyers do it as a part of their community obligation.|`|ucYwexwJaa	Attorney's are compelled to work a few pro-bono cases every year, it's like a tax write-off for them.|`|nbibIzC5aa	If you are suspicious of your attorney then get to know him or her better.  Ask him or her questions about how they came to work with those who cannot afford legal assistance.  Many areas do have foundations which help indigent defenders get legal assistance which other wise would not be possible for them.      Hope this helps.

Now it will be up to the new administration to build them in before dispersing any additional help.|`|AA10118655	The money they spend on parties like these are to keep customers doing business with them. It will cost them a lot more money to try to get new customers if they don't keep their current ones happy and they leave.    Maybe we should ban them from doing any advertising. Ban them from generating any new business. Ban them from trying to get new customers. Basically ban them from trying to make any money, and require them to lose money year after year.    CEO/upper management bonuses and luxuries. on the other hand, they need to crack down on if they accept government bailout money. That really does nothing to bring business in, and only rewards these people for the company doing good. If they need to get a bailout, they really didn't do their job, and don't deserve any of this.

AA10123414	Since the agreement is for her to pay by July 2009, there is nothing you can do until then. If she fails to pay after July, then you can file a suit in sm all claims court against her.|`|Gezfmghuaa	And as always, the caveat applies - "A verbal agreement is worth the paper it is printed on"    If she does not pay it back, you will have to take her to small claims court, which does not require a lawyer, just a small filing fee.      As far as her behavior, if it has reached the level of threats of physical or other harm, file a report with the police by going to your local station, just so it is on the record.|`|AA10118655	"They verbally agreed that she would pay him in full by July of 2009."    She still has a few months left to pay it back. Not a whole lot you can do until after July. Then, if you still want to pursue the issue, you can try to take her to court to get the money. But even then, there is very little enforcement of the court's decision if you win.|`|kPWGVeWhaa	Verbal agreement?      Sorry...not much you can do.  You MIGHT be able to go to civil court if you have check copies and such.|`|KDUwFiBPaa	Sorry to say a verbal agreement between them isn't necessarily legally binding especially since there is no documentation of the "loan."  Plus she still has until July.  But don't hold your breath, she's probably not going to pay.  Honestly, write her out of your life and your bf should take the 2k as a loss.  Even if you take her to small claims court, she could easily argue that it was a gift especially the purse and you have no real proof otherwise.  Going to court would be costly and keep her in your life.  Write it off as a loss and lesson learned.|`|AA10621418	You can obtain a civil protection order to keep her away, but will make it hard to collect.  As they said before me, your issue is not yet ripe for a lawsuit and would be dismissed solely based on your contention that the money is not due until july.  Next, you will have to prove that the verbal contract exists - while it is as binding as a written one, it is far harder to prove.  You will also have a hard time proving that the purse was a contractual agreement to repay between boyfriend and girlfriend and not a boyfriend purchasing the purse out of love and giving it as a gift.  Absent her volntarily paying you the money, you will be required to go to small claims and sue for the money, which is no guarentee that you will get.  Do you have anything other than their agreement years ago that she would repay?|`|nOOAcMLMaa	You need to take her to small claims court, not like judge judy, but locally, small claims covers any thing below $5,000.00 which you obviously are under. In most cases you will get the money back or a large portion of it. The other thing you could look into is if you have enough documented encounters with this person, you can get her on harrasment and get a temporary restraining order, they are not worth much in the case of a violent person, but in this case it should help you.

They will not only help you with your situation with the Army, they can also advise you on your situation with your girlfriend.    If you didn't go AWOL and went on approved leave to go see your girlfriend, you still need to talk to your base JAG office to see what your legal actions are regarding your alleged unborn child.

8MUj24s6aa	Britain Backfire.  "A litany of failures were apparent as early as the year 2000, when CBS news reported that law and order in Britain was deteriorating at a rapid rate, while the country was experiencing a crime surge much more severe than any recorded in the U.S."    "use of handguns to commit crimes rose 40% two years following the total ban on guns."    "In 2002, the chance of being mugged in London was approx. 6 times greater than in New York City, NY." (which as strict gun control as well).     In fact, the motherland was indeed racing ahead by a substantial lead, sporting a crime rate in England and Wales that at times peaked at as much as 60% above the crime stats here in the U.S., with gun crimes being especially prominent?    Lantz, Gary (2/2008), Backfire in Britain,     American's 1st Freedom, Feb 2008,     p27 and 28    "The laws that forbid the carrying of arms ... disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes. Can it be supposed that those who have the courage to violate the most sacred laws of humanity ... will respect the less important and arbitrary ones ... Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants, they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man."  Thomas Jefferson|`|gERaZGZeaa	Yes.   What is the benefit to having handguns legal?|`|nooi0ldjaa	no, your only dis-arming the good guys and making it easier for the bad guys to rob people.    outlaws well get guns even if they to are outlawed...that's why they are called outlaws!|`|Q7ovix19aa	Yes, there's too many people defending themselves noisily.

Ulff1hcDaa	Food stamp rules vary from state to state so you will want to check with your local human services office but that being said...    I am a food stamp working in my state and if the three of you came into apply I would look at you as a family of 3 for income but a family of 2 for a benefit.  That means that your husband's income would count as available to the family but he may not be eligible for a benefit.  It depends on his status and what rules your state has adopted.    When he applies to be a citizen it will again depend on his status but for many immigrants they are not eligible for any assistance for 5 years.      So, since he will not actually be on food stamps with the rest of your family I wouldn't think it would cause any problem later....but I don't work for immigration so you may want to check with whatever local advocacy group your area has for immigrants.|`|AA10045620	Applying for food stamps or other benefits would drastically impact residence.

The two principal enactments are the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA) [FN1] and the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA). [FN2] The new legislation provides more stringent restr ictions on the eligibility of aliens for benefits available under Federal law. [FN3] Congress has also authorized States to adopt similar restrictions for their own benefit programs. [FN4] Finally, Congress has made the traditional use of "affidavits of support" mandatory in certain cases, and, more importantly, made the affidavit of support enforceable by civil action. [FN5]     Public Charge    "Public Charge" has been part of U.S. immigration law for more than 100 years as a ground of inadmissability and deportation. An alien who is likely at any time to become a public charge is inadmissible and ineligible to become a lawful permanent resident of the United States. Also, an alien can be removed from the United States if he or she becomes a public charge within five years of entering the United States from causes that existed before entry.    The issue of becoming a public charge generates considerable public confusion and concern about whether a non-citizen who is eligible to receive certain Federal, State or local public benefits may face adverse immigration consequences as a public charge for having received public benefits. This concern has prompted some non-citizens and their families to deny themselves public benefits for which they are eligible  including disaster relief, treatment of communicable diseases, immunizations, and children's nutrition and health care programs  potentially causing harm to themselves and the general public.    The following information products are provided to address some of the questions and concerns you may have about the issue of becoming a public charge.  http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/m...|`|I8M5kw5Saa	maybe before you had a baby you should have thought of how are we going to feed her.Its really sad that you come here and now must have food stamps so your little girl can eat.You and your whatever needs to go back to where ever you came from and do it the right way.Even though I do feel bad that you are having this problem it is a problem you brought on yourself.Do not file for food stamps it should only be for legal americans.Sorry I know people here will say that the baby is an American Im hoping that we can soon say that if the parents are illegal then the child is too.|`|MeeJWmGtaa	http://www.nilc.org/immspbs/fnutr/foodnu...|`|XRYAfxpTaa	Immigrants are eligible for food stamps after 5 years of residence.

Gezfmghuaa	In this case yes, because even though he is assigned overseas, he is a US resident.  The tricky part may be serving the suit, and, he will have a pretty good reason to request a delay of trial until he gets back, so you should factor those into your decision.|`|RkfIPD7Iaa	You can file suit against anyone, although collecting is tough if it's out of the country.    However, there is nothing here to sue over.  You cosigned on the loan, it's your responsibility if he doesn't pay.  Simple as that.  There is no basis for any suit.|`|0AjyzHUHaa	Yes, but since he's out of the country, it'll take longer and be a little more complicated.  You should go talk to a lawyer about it though and get some information on how to win the case.    Although you co-signed you CAN still file a law suit.  Like I said, talk to a lawyer who can help you out, especially to find out all the logistics.

wyAtVqbOaa	I agree with the poster above but I was talking to a mate a while ago and apparently it's no longer valid legally if you just change your name.     His mum was not married to his dad but she took his name and has done for the last 40 years, however, when she went to take her driving test, it is in her maiden name and not her "married name" and the only way she can get it in her "married name" is to change her name legally with the help of a solicitor.  This includes all documents eg passport (she doesn't own one) and any other photographic proof as to get one, you need your birth certificate and or marriage certificate to confirm your change of name.      As it's your step dad's surname, if you want it on special documentation you do need to change it legally via a solicitor.|`|c67a2f77ab7471bed4b2f279ff05e2e1aa	Don't part with your money. Nothing is binding unless you sign it.  That means with a pen, on the table, in front of you.   Just tell your friends to call you by your new name.  It's easier and cheaper, and in the UK it is perfectly valid.  And if you had searched the archive of questions you'd have found more answers to the same effect.|`|b9c7add3a1a5c128cb474f91eaadd1d7aa	When you decide to change your name you can start using that name as soon as you've decided. That is totally legal.    Deed Polls are just there to prove that you are using your new name.     When you order Deed Polls online you're not ordering your change of name, you're just ordering proof that you've changed your name.

Personally, I find it odd that Glenn Beck is the only one in the media shining the light on the Progressive agenda of the early 20th Century, and comparing it to the modern political landscape on BOTH sides of the aisle. Look at Teddy Roosevelt. He was a Republican Progressive, and his cousin (FDR) was a Democrat Progressive! Woodrow Wilson was a Democrat Progressive, and Herbert Hoover was a Republican Progressive. They kicked that ball back and forth, making it look as if they were opposed to each other, while the ball was constantly moving up the field slowly toward the Global Governance goal. Their agenda did NOT go onto the back burner. WWI and WWII, the Cold War, and the insurgence of Genocide in 20th Century world politics are ALL a part of their agenda. What we here in the US call a Progressive/NeoCon, the Europeans call Fabian Socialist or "Fascist" for short. Most people don't realize that "Fascist" is NewSpeak for Fabian Socialist, and that it was first done by the Moussolini regime. Don't think for a second that the left is only in the American Democratic Party. What is a NeoCon but a Republican Progressive?

W1xs3vYBaa	My heart goes out to those in America, and the rest of the world, that have suffered because people do look at skin colour as a form of distinction. <br>  <br>  IQ tests have been used inappropriately whether it was testing cultural bias, or knowledge, and then people discriminated from it. Its use now can also be inappropriate because the methods of administering it haven't been properly regulated and they are often not administered by a professional. It is not supposed to be just a multiple choice test. <br>  <br>  In Canada we do not use IQ tests to get into schools, or even into gifted programs. Yes, we administer them as a starting point sometimes but our school system has said that IQ tests alone are not enough proof of intelligence. No college or university would even look at them. EQ is more important than IQ, and schools stress life skills instead of purely intelligence. <br>  <br>  Still, we suffer from Racism in Canada, and quite a lot. We do not have nearly the same sort of ghettos as in the US, nor do we have the governmental discrimination that is present in the US.<br>  <br>  We don't elect our police commissioners or supreme court judges, so there are no politics involved in it. We also have a charter that tries to enforce equality, though there are obviously still people out there who were raised to be judgmental. <br>  <br>  <br>  I will say that there are less intelligent individuals and more intelligent individuals. IQ has nothing to do with pigmentation. <br>  <br>  Still, those who live in poverty have a hard time getting the education and many people do not realize that in a ghetto society the best way out is through what many consider as an example of having low IQ: crime. When you are not able to get an education or employment there is only one route for people to take, and that is to go against the system. This gives people a purpose and meaning. Sadly, many people have used this cycle as trying to prove that people of colour have a low IQ. Thankfully the academic community sees through it, but the population as a whole doesn't. That they paint people in a negative light based on their actions is an argument, but this neglects the fact that their actions are primarily a result to how they are painted. The cycle really needs to end, and many people are hoping that Obama will signal to the black community that they have an out that is outside of deviant behaviour. Whether or not you're in agreement with his policies his appointment has given a prominent figure for youth to recognize and relate to. In an ideal world they wouldn't need a black figure to look up to, but we do not live the ideal. The media showed that electing a black man was a huge deal, and the media is what the youth see. Trying to tell them that race doesn't matter is a lie, because the structure of society, from media to individuals, have made it apparent that it is a matter. If the country can end the cycle of poverty and crime it will greatly improve its productivity and security because poverty and ghetto mentality hurts everyone. <br>  <br>  So, if there are people that truly believe that pigment has any correlation with IQ I urge them to go to college and university, even if it is just for a year, and learn a bit about socialization and different societal functions. Or, just try to give someone a chance and set a positive light with positive expectations on them and see the results.|`|4efdc5368b23398e691a290a96c0937baa	no, people who generalize are the less Intelligent.<br>  <br>  Liberals need to stop looking a people a groups or victim groups. Instid we need to treat people as indviduals.<br>  <br>  Were all Americans and where all individuals some a better than others but there is no correlation to race.<br>  <br>  Im personally offended by the term African American or Asian-American, were all Americans and most AA have never even been to Africa|`|rcPnnfmmaa	Yes. There are also people who genuinely believe the Earth is flat and under 10,000 years old. There are people who thought that if you lend money to people who can't afford a mortgage but charge them more it'll be a great way to make money. There are people who actually respond to emails about nigerian diplomats trapped in space stations.<br>  <br>  Stupidity is not a theory. I am sorry.|`|pM81f5tnaa	You make some valid points.  <br>  <br>  But when you say, "IQ tests only measures 3 intelligences," I don't know what you mean.  <br>  <br>  The most commonly used IQ tests are the Wechsler scales.  They measure numerous aspects of intelligence.  The four major index scores are Verbal Comprehension, Perceptual Reasoning, Working Memory, and Processing Speed.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Thanks for the link.  You're referring to Gardner's theory of multiple intelligences.  Not widely accepted, but I believe it has some merit:<br>  <br>  "The theory has been widely criticized in the psychology and educational theory communities. The most common criticisms argue that Gardner's theory is based on his own intuition rather than empirical data and that the intelligences are just other names for talents or personality types. Despite these criticisms, the theory has enjoyed a great deal of popularity amongst educators over the past twenty years. There are several schools which espouse MI as a pedagogy, and many individual teachers who incorporate some or all of the theory into their methodology. Many books and educational materials exist which explain the theory and how it may be applied to the classroom."|`|de0fc1da097f66a349eb15de28f1834faa	Can a black own property? can a black be a doctor, lawyer, pilot, president, ceo, teacher? <br>  <br>  Yes they can.

Even the great emancipator; Abraham Lincoln considered the supposed intellectual inferiority of African Americans to be self-evident; and in his writings, he favored buying land in South America and forming an African American colony. This was considered the "enlightened" position of the time. It was not politically expedient in those days to consider blacks equal in potential to whites. And even as late as World War II, there was an army surgeon who was dismissed from service for saying that separating plasma from white people and plasma from black people was (in his words) "retarded."<br>  <br>  My best friend from college is an African American, and he is currently in med school studying to be a surgeon. His wife, also an African American, is in law school studying to be a lawyer. Both are from humble backgrounds in rural South Carolina. I know from personal experience that such sentimentalities are simply relics from a more barbaric age. I for one consider it a blessing that they are here, both culturally (we'd still be listening to the Singing Nuns if it weren't for their cultural influence on music) politically (Barack Obama) and even intellectually (George Washington Carver)<br>  <br>  I think it is a case of "the people who matter don't mind, and the people that mind don't matter". I've never met an educated person who adheres to the pseudo scientific notion that races are intrinsically separate by intelligence. And the people that I know who are racist are usually white trash who couldn't do anything about it if they wanted too.|`|ONjTdk7Kaa	I think you're hypersensitive to this stereotype. Most people I know don't correlate intelligence with race - they're entirely separate.<br>  <br>  Actually, you're post is one of the only suggestions of a link between race and intelligence I've seen.

zJABsfsxaa	You can't be both in the Air Force or Navy. Whether you enlist or go through the officer route (via ROTC or OTS) you are contracted and obligated to one service branch under the terms you read and agreed with.<br>  <br>  There are two routes:<br>  Enlist and hope to go to an officer school which is the long route or<br>  <br>  If you want to become an officer and go to school, you can try the ROTC programs which you can knock out two birds with one stone - get a degree and commission as an officer. Remember, you still have to strive for excellence in order to get the career you want.<br>  <br>  Air Force ROTC is one you should considered if you want to be get a degree, become an officer and have a pilot career. Don't read into people who have biase views on other branches.  Joining the military and serving your country is up to you regardless of what branch.  If you decide to look into the AFROTC program -Check it out  at www.afrotc.com|`|JJrkROl7aa	Nope. Go Marine Corp.  Then you can get a really smart wife like me!|`|l4WEwTWwaa	If you want to be any type of pilot join the navy and start school fast or join the marines. The Air Force has only 6700 planes and over 300,000 enlisted people for them. If you go to the Air Force you will almost certainly not engage in fighting or fly at all. It is actually common knowledge in the military that if you join the Air Force you will do absolutely nothing. Its a great branch for people who don't want to fly or fight, they have almost nothing to do with the Air. While on the other hand although difficult, it is still quite easy if you excel in school to be a pilot in the navy or marines.

E9XL5x3Paa	Socialism, Communism, and Fascism all begin from the starting point of Capitalism.<br>  <br>  <br>  The basic idea of Capitalism is that businesses need work done, and workers need to get paid.  So a balance is struck between the two when the businesses start with a low wage for a job needing to be done, and keep raising it until the workers take the wage and get to work.  That is then considered the fair wage for the job.<br>  <br>  Fascism believes that the workers have too much power for this balance to work.  That they will get lazy and stop working until businesses agree to pay more.  The businesses do, but then the workers do this again.  At some point, the businesses will not be able to afford the wages, and that is when production of goods stops and the economy collapses.<br>  <br>  To save it, business owners would have to put a single dictator in charge of the armed forces, who would then use those armed forces to force the workers back to work.  Granted, it would be a dictatorship, but it was believed the only way to save the economy from workers who didn't understand the need for businesses to make a profit to keep the economy going.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Communism believes that the balance in Capitalism won't work because the businesses have too much power.  Workers are competing against each other for the same jobs and they also need to eat, and businesses would use both of these facts to play workers off of each other and keep wages low.  The businesses would drive wages down so low that people could no longer afford to eat, and that would then show the workers the need to revolt.  They would have to if only to eat.<br>  <br>  So the workers revolt, and kill the bourgeoisie (the business owners) in this revolt.  Afterwards, the workers would establish a committee charged with two main goals.  One, they would hunt down and kill off any remaining bourgeoisie to make sure they didn't come back and overthrow the new worker government; and two, put the workers back to work turning the "means of production" (raw materials and the factories to turn them into goods) into goods that would then be equally distributed amongst the workers.<br>  <br>  This time would be known as Socialism, and it was to be a very bloody time.<br>  <br>  <br>  After the bourgeoisie had finally been killed off, the committee was to disband itself.  If they would not, then the workers were to revolt again and overthrow them, then start Socialism over again until there was a committee that would disband itself.<br>  <br>  After the committee disbanded itself, there would be NO government whatsoever.  But since everyone was getting what they needed because everyone was sharing, there would be no crime.  There would be no need for crime, since crime is believed to be done only to get what one needed when they could not do so through legal means (the businesses not paying enough or not hiring enough).<br>  <br>  And while there would be a power vacuum, none of the workers would want to fill it by taking power themselves, because they lived in a crime-free and well-fed utopian paradise and would not want to destroy it by going power-hungry.  This utopian paradise was known as Communism, and is the complete LACK of government.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Democracy is an attempt to be a compromise between Fascism and Communism.  We have the single dictator of Fascism in our President, the worker committee of Socialism in Congress, and a system of checks and balances between the two to keep either from getting too much power.<br>  <br>  And then the Court Judiciary to act as a sort of referee between the President dictator and the worker Congress.|`|204577ae32c80edc66057923f993dd9aaa	It is significant to add to the GOOD answers you've gotten thus far that Socialism, per se, is liberal but Communism is conservative.  Case in point, I wonder how many who speak about the poor, working class and unemployed like they're trash and speak of Democrats as babying the dregs of society in wanting to help pull those people up, realize that in Communism, not working is called "parasitism" and is punishable by jail time.  I'm sure those same American conservative voices would be all for it.<br>  <br>  Communism is marked by a presence of a strong, militaristic central government.  Marx was responsible for Socialism, it was Stalin and Lenin who made it the Communism we know today.  Socialism, while not a workable economic model on a large scale, would hardly be threatening.  Communism is very much so because of its militaristic aspects and its involuntary control of the populace.<br>  <br>  You might find it interesting to Google The Political Compass test and take it.  You'll find that it's possible to be both left authoritarian and right authoritarian and left liberal and right liberal.  People chronically misuse these labels.|`|2vtP7WS7aa	Socialism is an economic philosophy( although as a political philosophy it does exist sort of a lesser form of communism). and Communism is the matching political philosophy.

However, the most important parts of the ASVAB are 2 Math and 2 English sections.  I would highly recommend going to after school tutoring to improve your math score.

Barefoot driving is sometimes discouraged because of a perception that one will not be able to apply as much force to the brake in an emergency situation and thus may not stop as quickly, but I am not buying that one.  Even if  this contention could be demonstrated true, which I doubt, driving in flip-flops or some forms of sandals would pose a similar issue, and yet these forms of footwear are not prohibited.<br>  <br>  I've done a lot of barefoot driving in my life, and I've never had an accident or gotten a ticket when driving barefoot.

Palin owed taxes on $18,000 of benefits that she got from the state as a result of living at her house instead of in Juneau. While I don't like the accounting error, I find it more plausible that is was indeed an error rather than the 6 digits of actual taxes that Daschle owed the government. Face it. Why would she lie about taxes on $18,000? I think she could afford the small amount of tax on $18,000 instead of putting herself in the sprotlight by intentionally committing tax fraud.<br>  <br>  2. The other part of it is the hypocracy of the left on this. Palin and company have never said that paying taxes is a good thing and aren't trying to raise other people's taxes. On the other hand, Daschle and company go around trying to convince us how we need to pay more and more, yet they feel it is perfectly appropriate to skip out on their share.<br>  <br>  3.  From what I understand, her sources were the ones who asked the government to look into this.  Apparently, there was some sort of change in the tax code, and there was debate on whether the income was taxable.|`|2gx2LgzEaa	Nice try, go back to school. <br>  <br>  the"TAX" shes being accused of Not paying is called a PER DIEM, which is usually NOT taxed.

(some jurisdictions will only allow the giver to take back the ring as long as they did not cause the subsequent condition to fail.)<br>  <br>  As you explain it, it appears he gave you a gift of the stroller and baby swing and then later decided he wanted to sell them to you.  He can't do that.<br>  <br>  Now, I almost don't want to say this, but if something happens to the child (God forbid) and you miscarriage, then he does have a pretty good claim to have the "gifts" returned.  Let's pray that doesn't happen.<br>  <br>  Now the above is not intended as legal advice and based on unknown facts, the answer could change, but for the most part the above is correct.|`|wR1XyyrUaa	He will likely lose. Gifts are the property of the recipient the instant they are given, the giver can not take them back without the permission of the recipient. You can probably counter sue for any court fees inured.|`|6a29fa9432cd11f6628b8d1ef1265ca6aa	"Does he have a chance?"<br>  <br>  Not likely.

The text message you sent and his response support the fact that they were gifts.|`|3oz4r6Nraa	No, gifts are gifts.  Once you give someone a gift you can't sue to get it back.  You own those two Christmas gifts, they're your property.<br>  Save and lock those texts, don't delete them from your phone.|`|oFcrglxzaa	the definition of gift is something acquired without compensation, he has no case|`|K2h6M1xqaa	Seriously; give the items back.<br>  <br>  It'll be worth it to cut off all ties.<br>  <br>  A stroller and a swing aren't worth the grief of having to put up with a petty ex.  They're just things.  --And easily replaceable things at that.  I've seen perfectly good strollers for $10 at garage sales.  You may even find that somebody donates one to you.  Material objects are ridiculously easy to come by when you are open to them.<br>  <br>  Be smart.  Don't let your ego screw up your life.  If you go to court, you'll spend weeks of your life with your gut screwed up in a giant ball of stress.<br>  <br>  But it depends.  Some people define themselves by having titanic battles over unimportant bits of nonsense they could have easily walked away from.  Some people find happiness and fulfillment in such dramas.  I don't have the patience for it, though.  I'd let the guy sit there looking at a stroller and a swingset in his living room and feel like a dork before I bothered to fight over it.  Thank goodness you didn't buy a house together, because then financially it might actually be worth your while to ruin two years of your life fighting over it.<br>  <br>  Cheers and good luck!|`|kQA7SbY9aa	If he gave them to you as Christmas gifts, you would probably win. Sounds like an idiot who has time and money to waste. I guess "love" can make us think and act in crazy ways sometimes. <br>  <br>  But I would give them back. I just wouldn't need the aggravation associated with going to court and continuing to deal with an ex (who is not the father of my child) over items I can just purchase myself while I'm in the last weeks of my pregnancy, which should be a time when I'm trying to keep things as 'light' as possible.

A party will have supporters who are corrupt, but it doesn't mean that the party or the typical supporter is corrupt.<br>  <br>  I heard on the BBC last night that he's been found and served with official papers by the FBI.<br>  <br>  Personally, I'm a little annoyed that he came here, to the UK, and has managed to damage Cricket, in so little time.|`|cIH0QbfMaa	I'm sorry, but you are proceeding from a false assumption. There are so many Republicans already in the closet that there's no room for any random stranger to just come waltzing in.|`|Q7ovix19aa	I heard he was an old-time Dixiecrat and is hiding in Clinton's New York home.|`|f6OOxJQsaa	He's in Virginia.|`|alQ5wIVqaa	The guy is a L-I-B-E-R-A-L. What are you smokin'?|`|slmQoSNqaa	he is sitting in a public bathroom stall next to Larry Craigs.  <br>  Give them some privacy, please.  Also, wouldnt it be nice if the police used excessive force when they finally arrested him.  If he were black, im sure the cops would beat the everyliving S out of him.  but, since he is a rich white elitist im sure the cops will all shake his hand while they send him off to a white collar jail or house arrest.  Im sure he will be pardoned anyway.  a slap on a wrist is probably what he is looking at.|`|U50orfPhaa	The guy is a BANKER!  So he is a Democrat!  Do you work for Huffington Post Nonsense?|`|AuAsQcCFaa	My fellow American, you must realize that Mr. Stanford donated more to the Democratic party than to the Republican party.

This is often six, seven, or eight figures. Your average street criminal can't afford to post bail in that amount, but Madoff can.|`|Rg2ERXAtaa	it may be blind,but justice can be bribed,no doubt about it|`|k6u1Kka0aa	I don't believe he has admitted to anything, he is just accused and not yet charged. The deadline to indict him has been extended.<br>  <br>  All his assets should be seized to pay off those he stole from and, if found guilty, should be jailed and forced to work off the rest of what he owes. He should also have two cellmates that repeatedly rape him for the duration of his sentence which should be 25 years minimum.|`|nLpctnwgaa	Dems protect their rich donors.|`|cWmx0J4jaa	same reason OJ knifed 2 people to death and stayed at home during the sham trial.

Maybe we can stick him and nobama in a cell together. Afterall, nobama has stolen Trillions from your grandchildren. Madoff only managed a few Billion.|`|ZZZgZ764aa	He is out on bond until trial.  He has no record and is not charged with violent acts.  Most people in this situation are not jail either.|`|kELDXjkgaa	We don't have enough money to keep jails staffed and inmate beds open.

Please research who you're voting for, they're the ones making the final decisions on these "stimulus" plans.|`|XHCoIo3zaa	Only taxpayers are paying to support these businesses.  The collective noun "we" only applies to taxpayers and not to welfare recipients or other people that do not pay any federal taxes.  By the way, people who deposit money in banks are supporting the banking system even if they do not pay taxes.  This is the money that is used to make loans.  <br>  <br>  Declaring bankruptcy deliberately might seem expedient now.  But then you will guilty of irresponsible behavior.  I hope that your conscience does not let you do that.|`|2QBHT8Azaa	Totally agree with you.  Some of us were actually loyal taxpayers who bought houses we could afford and made smart financial decisions.  In a recession, the best thing to do is lower taxes, not raise them.<br>  One of the false conclusions about "rich" people is that they are all lazy bums who inherited their money.  Actually, rich people are the ones who start companies and employ people, and cannot be expected to take any risks at making a buisness if the government will take away their money and give it to the car companies, banks, and whatnot to "stimulate the economy".

Oh, and she'd have to change party affiliation.<br>  <br>  socialismsucksarse.com|`|xugO6cDsaa	Not very far. If you remember a lot of the pro- Palin posts on here during the elections, all had something in them about how "hot" she is. And they had the gall to call Obama supporters shallow.|`|XHCoIo3zaa	Probably a lot farther.  As an attractive woman, she had to deal with the negative stereotypes.  If she wore contact lenses and dyed her hair blond nobody would take her seriously.|`|HmOdSP5Waa	Probably not far.<br>  <br>  But which office did Madeline get elected to?|`|EAqQXm7Oaa	She'd still like shooting animals from helicopters and call it a "sport".|`|EOPD0ftfaa	Let me consult my magic 8 ball.

icRwgQ7waa	If the letter says "this confirms that you have discharged me" or puts you on notice that he is making a fee claim/lien against any final recovery you get once another lawyer takes over your case, that is perfectly acceptable. Not sure what else you might be referring to but you could call the Michigan Bar Association which governs lawyers and ask - or better yet call your old attorney and ask what is going on. In my opinion, client questions about my bill are not chargeable to my client as a fee.
697f4b7e2abf668416acd21a3fe138f0aa	The current income tax laws are codified as Title 26 of the U.S. Code.  You can read it at <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/26/" rel="nofollow">http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/26/</a> or at <a href="http://uscode.house.gov/download/title_26.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://uscode.house.gov/download/title_2...</a><br>  The sections that apply to most people are 1, 61, 62, 63, 3402, 6001, 6011, 6012, 6151 and several others.<br>  <br>  Title 26 is known as prima facie law or evidence of the actual laws passed by Congress.  To read the actual laws passed by Congress, you have to look in the U.S. Statutes at Large.  For the most part, these are not available online.  However, you can find a copy in most Federal Depository Libraries and most law libraries.  Do a search on Federal Depository Libraries to find one in your state.  Our current tax laws get their basic structure from the Tax Reform Act of 1986.  It can be found in Volume 100 starting on page 2085 of the U.S. Statutes at Large.  It has been modified by Congress several times in the years since.<br>  <br>  Re: Why is the IRS under the control of the executive branch?<br>  Because that is the way the government works.  The legislative branch (Congress) writes the laws within the power provided by the Constitution.  The executive branch executes those laws.  So, when Congress creates a law stating the Secretary of Treasury can appoint a Commissioner of Internal Revenue and that the Secretary can delegate the power to hire the personnel necessary to collect taxes and enforce the income tax laws, that law is executed by the executive branch.|`|Wcjc8Au1aa	Big Cazzo is dead wrong.  No one has won a legal argument claiming that the income tax is unconstitutional.  In fact, some crackpot author who has been writing books to that effect has recently been jailed for deluding people into that belief.  There are still some wishful thinkers who think they can get away with that argument, but every single one of them is either in prison or a lot poorer after paying a hefty fine.<br>  <br>  Why do you think Al Capone ended his career in prison?|`|tx2lX6Rfaa	only the constitution -__________________-|`|BpcgaJd4aa	Ya...well it's not written but if you dont pay they lock you up|`|U9XlITtHaa	None that anyone has been able to find.|`|aFC72tLZaa	Here we go again.

The federal statute pertaining to individuals is found at 26 USC 1.   A taxation on income was made Constitutional by the 16th Amendment.

V44ARW4maa	sorry, but oil is a finite resource. You seem to think the concept of running out of oil is "insane" and this implies you are more intelligent than the oil analysts, not to mention the economists who project what happens in the future when the world begins to consume more than the producers can supply. I disagree with you but i also am willing to state you could very well be correct and everyone else is dead wrong. So, is this generally what the worlds' best and brightest (that's you) does all day? sit on answers? Wow, what a great waste of such intellectual brilliance.|`|AA11713693	Yeah there is and that is a real shame.|`|qEYYHNyyaa	Oil is finite. We will run out, the only question is when.|`|ZhBo2NsRaa	We're running out of "cheap" oil. There's still oil left but it would not be cheap anymore because the supply of this nonrenewable resource is disappearing.|`|QMYNDtHgaa	It's not a scare tactic if it's honest dude.

There have been several powerful and accurate industry supported white papers on the situation.<br>  <br>  People just don't want to hear the bad news until it's too late!<br>  <br>  All oil and gas we're getting now requires a whole lot more effort to obtain, and no one is claiming more than 100 years worth of methane and oil reserves.

The wind will come back around as it always does, and the Democrats just spent a HUGE portion of their wind (meaning the wind change is coming very soon....especially once they realize this "stimulus" thing did nothing at all to fix the problem, and screwed us all pretty bad).|`|3ivEoxzaaa	I can find you polls that will prove just the opposite.

But support for the bill has fallen 12 points since January, and nearly half of those surveyed do not believe it will shorten the recession. <br>  <br>  Fifty-one percent of those surveyed support the stimulus package, while 39 percent do not. An additional 10 percent don't know. Last month, 63 percent supported the package and just 24 percent opposed it.

SYPcyNoTaa	I LOVE the draft. its the only way to end the war. Right now the war is only directly affecting like 8% of the population so therefore anti-protests are not well attended.<br>  if there is a draft and the war affects more people then more people would get off the couch and into the streets. the government does not want that. remember the anti-protest during Vietnam, nobody wants that anymore.<br>  The draft will end the war, the government knows that and thats why we having 3rd and 4th deployments instead of drafting new folks.|`|n2oEhdZiaa	A society with a draft has several advantages:<br>  <br>  It instills an understanding of civic responsibility rather than civic entitlement.<br>  <br>  By having a draft that effects all the population, people have a tendency to hold their government accountable for their actions.  For example, if all our congressmen had children in the military, would they have so readily voted to invade Iraq?  Would news on the military be relegated to the back page?  <br>  <br>  By not having a draft, we have an elite all volunteer military.  This military is very pro-military for obvious reasons and trains hard to do their job and wants to have the adventure and see the world and conduct their missions.  They are thus more inclined to vote in favor of a war.  It polarizes our society and eliminates the commonality of service.<br>  <br>  I believe we would have a much stronger, unified society if we all shared the responsibility of service.  I also believe we would not deploy as often and we would be a lot less likely to go to war with nations unless our entire society was truly behind it.|`|1HLDASNcaa	why would you rather be imprisoned or tortured than join the army? thats way overboard even if you are a pacifist. no offence but you are a real loser if you would rather die than join the military especially since you dont have to do infantry jobs. and stop being a little ***** seriously.|`|oPLpwKH2aa	i am fine with a draft, i wish people would help out their nation in a time in need, otherwise we wouldnt need a draft.<br>  some people only worry about themselves and dont care to help others. thank god we have people that are willing to sacrifice themselves and put others first.|`|749a6586e68d3ab356d776176fd57b63aa	Without an Army,you just might be tortured and imprisoned.( By the way,I'm a United States citizen,not a world citizen,I'm proud of my country,just not its present leader.)|`|wg8SQQjEaa	you do not have my respect.<br>  <br>  if my country needed me i would gladly put my life on the line to protect it. against any enemy, foreign or domestic.<br>  <br>  you are just a coward.|`|ILgk3OLOaa	No, I'm fine with it.

They are respected unless they disrespect, and they use the same judgment as any other normal human being. They dont go around killing innocent people, they dont enjoy war, and they believe in doing the right thing. <br>  I had a friend who thought just like you. His best friend joined the Navy and invited him to one of the bases, and guess what? Now he is in the Navy also.

lYkvps54aa	Parts of Sharia law are already incorporated into British law. I think it is important to understand that Islam is not a bad religion, not any worse that Judaism or Christianity. It is a religion of peace and tolerance, don't believe all the propaganda being pump out by cnn, bbc or fox. its because WE have invaded their lands, that's why it is the way it is. Chechnya, Sudan, Palestine, Iraq, Afghanistan, to name a few<br>  <br>  its our foreign policy that's the problem, not Islam.|`|4c999009943f84ff6c47298a2358efd7aa	No, not at all.

WyyyrUrQaa	If you are seriously interested in joining the military (although you have plenty of time to make up your mind) you should check out <a href="http://usmilitary.about.com" rel="nofollow">http://usmilitary.about.com</a> <br>  <br>  But don't just look at army.  There are five major branches in the military: Air Force, Navy, Army, Marines, and Coast Guard.  You can get lots of information on all five branches. I've been using it to compare branches and it has been really helpful. I found out about it from a recruiter. It answers some questions, but a lot of questions you have would be good for a recruiter. Go talk to a couple. (no one says you have to only talk to one) Tell them about yourself and ask "what can your branch offer me" That's what I did.  <br>  <br>  Because you're 13 if you talk to one now you can get into ROTC which can really benefit you when you decide to join (you can go up a pay scale or something, i'm not totally sure all the details but I know it's very good)<br>  <br>  I'm not an expert on this stuff or anything but if you have any questions I'd be glad to help answer them (If i'm not sure I can always go ask my recruiter too)|`|937d8516b6bac65675aebed05fbfdfc9aa	good job thank you for considering to be a person who loves their country and wants to fight for freedom and pelosi|`|qfe5GOcMaa	dont become a pot head and flunk school|`|c01478a0ce464355e8ad471d5a5c87dcaa	Question...

They just don't answer questions you don't ask.|`|l4WEwTWwaa	What you have to understand is that Recruiters get a bonus in pay the more people they recruit. Some are also supposed to fill a certain quota. Also if you don't ask them a specific question they are not required to tell you anything. You should also know beforehand that joining the military is not going to be 5 star hotel living accomodation. You have some that do twist things and are just plain jerks but you have others that are 100 percent honest despite the fact that it could cost them their job, and you have others in the middle. That's why I made sure I grilled my Recruiter with a **** load of questions from every topic imaginable before joining. He was pretty honest and I don't feel cheated or lied to at all. Everyone is different.|`|AA10079277	some are, some are not.  there is nothing unique among military recruiters. all recruiters are the same....|`|Q9W7p6Kzaa	They are more like your computer, they will always give you an honest answer, if you ask the right question, the right way.|`|z58NVkOnaa	In what manner do you wish the Recruiter to be honest?<br>  <br>  Depends on the topic that is being addressed...you highlight the positives and not bring up the negatives...<br>  <br>  What are the positives?

Your away...you will miss your GF, and in most cases, you will lose her...no gal should be tormented in staying within a relationship to someone that is not here...it is just not fair to her...and it is cruel.  So let her go...dont be selfish...<br>  <br>  If your married, the same applies...see if you go on without sex for a year or two...dont kid yourself, your not going to be able to restrain yourself...<br>  <br>  Trust them?!  their job is to get you in...if you are a numbnuts, and dont have a clue what your doing, you better beware.<br>  <br>  If you have your head on straight...and know what you want to do in the military, you better have a signed contract, not a handshake, or a verbal contract...but, a signed guarantee...if you go in on a open contract, you will be placed based on your score once your in...and what you end up being, is what you will be...|`|AA11301908	By doing your research.<br>  <br>  Most recruiters are honest, some however aren't. For every one bad story about a recruiter you hear there are 1,000 you didn't hear.<br>  <br>  Do your research, and ask multiple sources if one recruiter gives you an answer that seems odd go and call and talk to a recruiter in a different city.<br>  <br>  Always make sure your contract is exactly what you want before you sign it.|`|cDnxIXjvaa	Though this is a stereotype, there is some danger of it happening.

Not just propering but actual going to extreme measures to prosper. She believes in the we and they, us and them. She cannot get out of the mindset of "Why doesn't everyone think and behave like us?. After all we are the conquerers, we are the ones who have the power, money and brains". Anyone else is an enemy. In other words she believes in duality. Never realizing the extremism in the name of good is as just as wrong as extremism for the sake of bad.

HJaVcUGwaa	It depends where is your starting point.  If it is the recent history, then the native population of Palestine was there first.  This native population was mainly Arab (about 83% Muslim, 8% Christian and 9% Jewish).  This native population is what we call today the Palestinians.  This was the population when Britain gave the Balfour declaration (1917) to the European Zionists to establish a national home for the Jews in Palestine.  Between 1917 and 1948, European Jewish emigration to Palestine increased the Jewish population to 33%.  3 months before Israel's declaration of independence the Zionists launched a military campaign to empty the land from the native population to make room for the incoming European Jews.  This campaign would have resulted in the total ethnic cleansing of the Palestinians had the Arab armies not arrived 3 months later to prevent the fall of the remainder of Palestine (West Bank and Gaza Strip).  I suggest you read the answer to this question for a factual brief history of the conflict.<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Aq1UwPuJNuZoW_epETqvqXDty6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090208102834AApxDtI">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  However, if you want to go back to the beginning, then the first known civilized inhabitants of Palestine were the Canaanites about 6000 years ago.  According to the bible, Abraham emigrated to Palestine (Canaan) and was a refugee with the Canaanites.  Abraham's son Isaac married a Canaanite, so did his son Jacob, and his children after him.  Thus the descendants of Jacob (the Israelites are at least 87.5% Canaanite blood).  The Palestinians are considered the descendant of the Canaanites.  Because of the above, genetically, the Palestinians and the original Israelites (not the converts to Judaism) have almost identical genes.<br>  <br>  So whether you consider the recent history or the old history, the Palestinians were there first.  However the problem is not who was there first.  Palestine could have taken both peoples.  Muslims, Christians and Jews had lived in Palestine peacefully together for hundreds of years before Israel.  The problem is that the Zionists ethnically cleansed the native population and never allowed them to return in spite of several UN resolutions.

Kh4p4gPXaa	You will go to jail.   If you get in trouble with the police (even a random traffic stop),  the warrant will be on the computer as outstanding,  and you will end up in handcuffs (and with a lot larger fine).<br>  <br>  The statute of limitations doesn't apply to you,  it applies to you being charged for the crime,  since a warrant is issued,  you've been charged (and convicted).   It doesn't go away,  in the past they would close out old minor files,  but since this is the computer age,  it stays forever.<br>  <br>  Yes,  you can pay it,  and you should,  since its collecting interest and late penalties.   Contact the court and tell them you want to settle it.   You will likely have to make an appearance,   but you can make payment arrangements and get it off the books then.|`|1KGXts5Daa	One does not "pay" to have a warrant removed.<br>  <br>  What type of warrant are you referring to?  Bench warrant, arrest warrant, search warrant, etc. etc. etc.<br>  <br>  From your description, it sounds like a bench warrant.  Bench warrants are issued by a judge.  They are an order to have you "brought before the bench" (the judge, the court).<br>  <br>  They are a form of arrest warrant, meaning that if you have any contact with law enforcement (ie: a traffic violation) which causes an officer to "run you for active wants/warrants" you may be immediately arrested.<br>  <br>  They differ only slightly from arrest warrants in that arrest warrants are filled out by law enforcement, "sworn to" before a judge, and then signed by the judge.<br>  <br>  To resolve the issue you need to contact either your local law enforcement agency or the court having jurisdiction in your county.|`|c07v7O80aa	Yes.

My advice is to go to court and get it taken care of. the longer you wait and avoid it the worse it gets. and if you get pulled over by the police and they check your record it will show up and you will be arrested on the spot for an outstanding warrant.|`|MHdzTrUZaa	I'm not sure if there is a statute of limitation for warrants but I wouldn't play with this. The warrant may no longer be valid in one county but it may show up in another.  Let's say you get stopped for a routine stop on Friday and the officer finds that you have a warrant, you would be stuck in jail for the whole weekend until your court date (usually Monday or Tuesday).  I wouldn't gamble on this, your weekend would totally suck if this happened (no pun inteneded).<br>  <br>  You need to find out if you have a warrant for sure and the best thing to do is to simply call the police department/county who issued it in the first place and ask them to check to see if you have a warrant. If it happens that it still shows, let them know you would like to setup a court date to take care of it.  You will have to go down there and you may or may not have to come out of the pocket with some money, it depends on the county.  I doubt they will try to arrest you because most counties are interested in the money you owe vs. having to lose money to house you in lock up.

But don't say anything in court until they ask you a question. And he will probably will still have to keep paying $650 a month.|`|UinOWcMUaa	Man He is the father.. He should have half custody if He wants.. Stop being so greedy and do what's best for the kids...|`|iOqmoIrcaa	Did you even bother to talk to the child support enforcement staff?  90% of the stuff you are ranting about is nonsense.  Who cares what type of clothing you put on her?  The courts don't.  Who cares what she calls him?  The courts don't.  This is a straightforward you make this much money so you pay this much situation.  What you do is none of his business.  Who he is married to is none of yours.  This is about the child getting what she deserves, so leave all of your personal drama out of it and look out for your daughter.|`|VGhy6Wdxaa	so what if you put her in named brand clothing if you can afford it or if his child support pays for it what does it matter and if she calls your husband dad that isnt going to change anything you already have full custody of her your just going to court to solve the child support problem i hope he has to pay more that's what he deserves for trying not to pay for his child....your the one that is there for her every day!|`|XuG5g9Zgaa	I don't see why he doesn't have partial custody but a judge can order anything.  If you can afford it, get an attorney to represent you.<br>  <br>  If you defend yourself, don't you have to say he isn't telling the truth (lie) in order to do this?|`|kjdKkDAkaa	It would be best if you have a lawyer when you go to court.<br>  He may want to share custody  --and if the two of you could get along, that would be the best thing for your daughter.  A little girl really  needs her daddy.  Children need both parents --and it would be better for all concerned if the relationships were good.|`|TYRkO91Saa	Every situation is unique.  More than likely the judge will order th $711 that child services came up with. And if there are any false statements that are being made you need to address them, especially if they are in documents that the court or child services has to review.  You can prove that he is not fit to have custody because he only knew the woman he married for 3 weeks and you don't feel that your daughter is with a woman you and your ex barley even know.   Also you can prove that you are able to provide a stable home and that you want the child's father to take financial responsibility for his child.  As far as the child calling your current husband dad that should be a non-issue because your ex obviously feels threatened by your current husband and deep inside he feel that he is being more of a father figure to her, anyone can father a child but it takes a man to be a dad.  Also, so what if your child wears name brand clothes your children always deserve the best.  Finally, when you appear in court, come dressed appositely but not flashy, try to look the part of a mother who works hard to provide for her child and puts her child before anything else and at the same time you can tactfully make your ex look like an ***.

GIVE PEOPLE A BREAK!!<br>  <br>  You could go a bank to ask for an overdraft/personal loan. Other than that you could see how long the application will take and start to save. Good luck.|`|839be5UKaa	I dont think there's such scheme. You could get a personal from your bank (or from your credit union if you're a member). Its not a huge amount so it shouldnt be too hard to get a personal loan even with the recession making credit short at the moment.<br>  <br>  You can pay by credit card. You could pay that back in installaments. Alot of credit cards offer 0% interest for the first 3 months so if you can pay it off in 3 months it would be better. Be careful after that though because the interest will be high and its so tempting to just pay the minimum amount. It can be a quick way to get into bad debt. I wouldnt recommend doing it unless you know that you pay it off before it starts to accrue interest.|`|AA11808995	You can borrow the money from a Bank if you can find one thats open.|`|c30e7d5dc21c881fa2b4e10f9ca03ee5aa	sir or madam????

I’ll try though…<br>  <br>  If someone called child services because the “heard” someone was hurting a child, well they would take the obligation serious…. At school/work or wherever if a form of harassment/bullying is occurring, it needs to be attended to ASAP before it gets out of hand.

cDnxIXjvaa	If you want to fly planes in the Air Force, you have to be an officer. That means a 4-year bachelors degree (can be in anything, but STEM especially engineering is helpful) and either AFROTC (training at a civilian college), the Air Force Academy (or the Merchant Marine Academy, or possibly cross commissioning from another academy), or OTS (4 month post-graduate training program). Once you commission, you need to earn a spot at UPT (undergraduate pilot training, 54 weeks). This is based on your GPA, class standing, Air Force Officer Qualifying Test, Pilot Composite Selection Method (includes flight simulator and psych-eval), and recommendations. It's *a lot* easier to get a slot if you graduate from the Air Force Academy (you are basically guaranteed one). There are complex medical factors (look them up) as well. Former civilian pilot experience is extremely helpful, and physical fitness is very important.<br>  <br>  Enlisting is another great option for some people, but will not lead to a pilot seat in the Air Force (unless you later commission). Also realize that you don't "take a tour in Iraq", you're deployed whether you like it or not, whether you're enlisted or not.<br>  <br>  It's more complicated (not to mention difficult) than that, but there's the gist.|`|c01478a0ce464355e8ad471d5a5c87dcaa	ROTC is your best bet, unless you want to see Iraq.

AA11494150	I don't have statistics readily available, but I can safely say guns are used in a very small percentage of all crimes committed.<br>  <br>  I can also safely say drugs are illegal, but you have no trouble finding them. The same goes for guns. Making them illegal will not prevent criminals from getting them, it will only prevent honest citizens from having them. This would make them an easier mark for criminals.|`|DFJ9m4WKaa	Trooper is correct, and while I do not have exact figures myself I can say that in the case of violent offense guns are more common and in cases where guns actually are involved, they are often stolen or illegal. Making guns illegal only impedes on the liberties of otherwise responsible gun owners. That and any American should have the right to protect their home if their lives are in danger. <br>  <br>  Guns in the wrong hands kill people. But making guns illegal doesn't necessarily take them out of the hands of those people. As far as preventing crime? That is a bit harder to say. I guess if at a gas station a sign indicating that there is a gun under the counter will make that gas station less likely to be robbed. In that case, then yeah it reduces crime. But is it enough to say that they reduce crime more than they cause crime? Well compared to the illegal sale of guns on the black market I think its hard to say "guns reduce crime". They can. But there are so many more crimes committed with guns, than without them. <br>  <br>  What we need is more strict enforcement on current gun laws and harsher penalties for those who carry or deal illegal guns. If nobody can buy guns illegally, or its much harder to do so, then less crimes will be committed by buying guns and it'd be easier to say that guns reduce crime.|`|lJGnuMbbaa	if a house holds have a firearms a criminal will think twice about doing their dirty work as they may be shot.   in all places where guns have been taken away or confiscated crime went up. murders also was on the rise. criminals will get guns even when no one else can have one.<br>  the public needs to be armed to kept the liberals from taking every ones liberty|`|k5WdChc7aa	If you're a criminal and you have a choice between three houses to rob, do you rob:<br>  <br>  A) The house you know that is unarmed.<br>  B) The house you aren't sure about.<br>  C) The house you know that is armed.|`|AA11858035	Sorry, I took a minute or two to try and think of a valid opposition argument and,,,,I can't.|`|otYOxmnuaa	Lets not do your homework.  ;)

b31dbdcb27d3c5c8df1a7f8d790d7ae8aa	Sounds (once again) like the teaching profession has hit all time lows. They must be digging from the bottom of the educators pool in the past few years. My biggest problem with modern day teachers is that they spend more time force-feeding propaganda to their students than actually instructing. They are simply doing a disservice to teens as well as the communities they reside in. I don't understand why teachers can't adhere to basic learning essentials (math, english, the sciences, civics, etc.), the value of hard work and training students to be objective/productive members of society. With the constant bombardment of ultra-liberal/socialist principles by the media and now, education, it seems that free-thinking is frowned upon in both the classroom and the working world today.

Worrying about who's right, and who's wrong wont get you better grades in school, or more money at your future job. It will however land you a job in a school pretending to be a teacher.

Kuhlmeier was a case involving the First Amendment argued before the U.S. Supreme Court in 1988.  This case didn't involve the US Supreme Court invoking "original jurisdiction."  This was a typical Supreme Court case where the Court chose to review the decision of the lower court.  This is called "granting cert."  (Cert is short for writ of certiorari.  The US Supreme Court has the option as to whether to hear most cases.  If it chooses to exercise its power to review them, it grants cert.  If it chooses not to hear them and let the lower court's decision stand, then that's called denying cert.)<br>  <br>  In the Federal system, most cases begin in a district court.  This is the trial court and usually the court with original jurisdiction.  If a party disagrees with the district court, it can appeal the case to the Circuit Court that oversees and reviews decisions from the district courts.  The Circuit Court reviews the appeal -- this is appellate review.  If a party doesn't like the decision of the Circuit Court, the party can then try and appeal to the US Supreme Court.  The US Supreme Court may or may not choose to hear it.<br>  <br>  This particular case began in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri.  It was then appealed to the 8th United States Court of Appeals, which reviewed the ED of Missouri's decision.  Cert was granted and the US Supreme Court in turn reviewed the 8th Circuit's decision.  <br>  <br>  Jurisdiction in Federal court was proper because this case involved a question of Federal law -- i.e. First Amendment rights under the US Constitution.  Federal courts are granted original jurisdiction in cases involving interpretations of United States laws (including copyright laws for example), maritime law (admiralty), cases involving citizens of different states, cases between ambassadors and representatives of foreign nations, cases between state governments, and cases in which the United States is a party.<br>  <br>  Cases where the US Supreme Court has "original jurisdiction" are relatively rare and infrequent.  These cases usually involve disputes between two or more U.S. states, typically regarding boundary lines, water claims, or other property issues.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.

547f5b1d679b79c320d53d1b57946dd9aa	Fantastic observation and question!  The answer is that WW1 bayonets were meant for charging and used primarily as a weapon that was needed because of the trench style warfare.  The extra length gave an advantage with weapons that were bolt action and did not have a high rate of fire.  In WW2 the bayonet was good for close in fighting, but not as useful in a war that had weapons with a high rate of fire.  Further, it took on an additional role, it was also a tool, they could be used for cutting barbed wire and were also instrumental in being used as an entrenching tool to help break up hard ground in the winter.  If you notice, the ww2 bayonet is much thicker than the pure piercing thin WW1 bayonet.  I hope this helped.|`|MQIc7X0Zaa	well i think that ww2 bayonets are better. plus those bayonets were movie props not the real thing.|`|c22cd3bc80b769e97ac9ae2bc60d368eaa	You received some good technical responses.

Lucky I have not been laid off but my hours slashed and benefits cut.  But my husband went out and got a second job.  We bought a house in a non desirable area and in no means my dream home.  It needs a roof, but I did not buy the house for a few hundred dollars more JUST INCASE for the day that we could not afford our payment. We looked at each other and said under most circumstances, even the death of one of us, could we afford to live here forever if we had to?  <br>   Then we look at our children and say this is a new time.  Sorry, one of you can not go here/there.  One of you can not play ball this Spring. Sorry we are not ordering pizza, we are having beans and rice...Again!  But each month we send in our mortgage payment even week or 2 late, but it gets there.

Under the National Popular Vote bill, all of the state’s electoral votes would be awarded to the presidential candidate who receives the most popular votes in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. The bill would take effect only when enacted, in identical form, by states possessing a majority of the electoral votes—that is, enough electoral votes to elect a President (270 of 538)."|`|83t9G4gcaa	If we did that, candidates would do a round of campaign stops before narrowing the focus on say, the top 20 cities, by population density, and then hope the message saturates the outlying areas.<br>  <br>  We'd have a few key cities deciding the presidential race every cycle.

Since it is clear that there is no appetite for nationalizing banks and no appetite for suspending/repealing mark-to-market accounting, then the federal government must step up and buy the banks' asset-backed securities with public funds at some agreed upon price or guarantee a price floor, e.g., 33 1/3 percent of face value, to encourage private transactions.<br>  <br>  There is another proposal that would have the federal government buy the assets and then require the banks to pay the loss differentials on an annual basis or x years out. Let's say that the federal government requires the commercial banks it regulates to sell those assets to a special asset fund at 100% of their face value. Five years later the fund has sold the assets and experienced a total loss of 30%. The banks would then proportionately reimburse the fund for the 30% loss over an appropriate time frame. Say 5 or 10 or 15 years, with or without interest.<br>  <br>  You have to make the banks viable again or no substantial lending can take place. Without substantial lending the economy will continue to contract. there also needs to be a program to permit over leveraged  consumers refinance their homes. Jim Cramer from MSNBC has suggested that 40 year 4% fixed rate mortgages would give many underwater homeowners desperately needed breathing space. 30 year mortgages fixed at 4% with no points would help many other homeowners who are not underwater but who would benefit from a reduction in their debt service freeing up money for other purposes such as spending, saving, investing or other debt reduction.<br>  <br>  You have to address both of these problems because they are intertwined and cannot be treated separately. You also need the stimulus funds for immediate needs, and you need structural tax reforms and economic policies that encourage real capitalism that will create new jobs, invent new industries and re-invigorate old industries.<br>  <br>  The deleveraging death spiral will end just as soon as we get the short and long term policies right.|`|GtO2FMnTaa	Might as well...if we try and bail them out they will just keep wasting the money like they have so far.<br>  <br>  The banksters are mental.|`|9cbd33d2161007ec93c0593d77c8434faa	Armageddon.

The amount you state of Federal Debt as a percentage of GDP is wrong.

Big oil and OPEC crapped in their nests with the 4 dollar a gallon rape they laid on us.  Everyone figured out they didn't have to drive as much as they thought they did.  The demand for the supply has decreased dramatically and if they don't stop the gouging it will go even lower and they will have to settle for decent profits instead of obscene ones.|`|v5VlL09iaa	Drilling for more oil means that the oil companies lay claim to those oil reserves before someone else does, plain and simple.<br>  <br>  What I don't get is how is that supposed to lower the price of gas at the pumps. In Washington state most of our gas comes from oil in Alaska, government owned. But when foreign oil prices rise, our gas prices rise right along with everyone else. So that in and of itself tells me that *drill here, drill now* will only make the oil companies rich, not lower the price of gas.|`|0tp5qpzkaa	Because if there were more drilling , more refineries would be created to process the oil being drilled. I know because I worked in the oilfield for over 12 years. Why have 2 frying pans when your only cooking in one.

Government spending was involved but the spending went straight to industry not to bail out people and give them welfare.|`|AA10774878	It was government spending but it was also very necessary. Remember the Nazi's and their atrocities against Europe? <br>  <br>  FDR waited until Americans died at Pearl Harbor, truth be told he knew about it in advance, to get involved in the war. <br>  <br>  Had FDR acted in a preemptive manor, thousands if not millions of lives could have been saved. He knew we were heading towards war he just didn't have the stones to get us involved until we were attacked.|`|AA10652652	The U.S. was the only game in town till the Japanese got their act together in the 1980s and then China came along.  Europe had a very high unemployment rate and they were spending money too.  Even during and after WWII, the percentage of unemployed (mostly then underemployed) was about what is now.  The debt for WWII stretched all the way to the 1980s.  Also after the war, the women were fired and 50% of non whites were unemployed in the cities.  So all that money ended up just helping white males which made up less than 50% of the population.|`|trMsK86jaa	"am I missing something here?"<br>  <br>  Generally speaking people are always missing something.<br>  <br>  It's what makes us human.|`|04a4824f734643fd0c6adefd032a1af8aa	ww2 created jobs...right now we already in war..with the unemployment rate increasing, i dont think govt. spending on one of the main things that got us in this "crisis" will help this time.|`|742e4c8b4668a0ad6462b4a0210ce82aaa	The Great Depression started in 1929.  WWII was in the 1940's.  FDR's New Deal had pretty much reversed the Depression before the war even started.

This spending today is to keep the nonproductive happy and voting for liberals, at the expense of the real responsible working people. <br>  -- This is welfare for those that support the liberal agenda.The Dem's fig they can stay in office and make the country into a liberal state, control the people by taking away some of their rights.|`|2KNzw0Rbaa	It was all the spending by the allied nations, England, France, Russia and many more borrowed and paid the U.S. for war goods in amounts far more than the U.S. spent. And prior to the U.S. entry into war we were still 'trading' with Germany, Japan, and Italy. So it's more a matter of demand of U.S. products overseas.|`|TTyXas7Xaa	World war 2 did help get us out of the depression because all our factories were being used to make war stock. This also meant that they needed people to work at these places.  Government spending will help get us out. Proof: how we got out of the great depression|`|651a651e9e9b67965456fb9edd123aafaa	No.. And gov't F's everything up.. But the military is the greatest.. der......... der......<br>  <br>  BTW = The "free market" will fix itself.. Gov't has no control over that.. But don't raise taxes! Because that will stifle progress.. get it? hahaha|`|4f9e57dbf0fa6fc41e6fe3e1397aa468aa	The war spending in WWII was only a part of what got us out of the great depression.|`|4IOlVVR6aa	the war took 15-25% of the men out of the work force and then we geared up. If you can remove that many workers from the US economy, we would have a lot more good jobs. It's starting to look a lot like Carter-Daze again. Carter did much the same, and we had something like 26% unemployment, which they had to finagle to make it look smaller. He then tried to get us into a war to get us out of the Carter Depression.<br>  <br>  Obama wants the military draft. He wants to remove 75,000 men from the workforce to send to Afghanistan. After that? Sky's the limit. In FDR's day, at least we were the only ones to have the Bomb. Now most of our enemies do, thanks to the dems.|`|HQoGiaPFaa	No, the WWII boom was generated by selling supplies to our allies.
YupMCYHlaa	The bit about the president being able to take over the entire government, that wasn't in the Patriot Act, it was an executive order issued unilaterally by Bush.  No, it isn't strictly constitutional, but that never stopped Bush.<br>  <br>  I wonder how many Republicans realized at the time that all the illegal and unconstitutional stuff Bush did, and got away with, becomes precedent for successive presidents.  Obama could build on that and -really- become the most powerful president in US history.<br>  <br>  The economic crisis could get really nasty, and in that case yes, Obama might consider simply taking over the govt.  And the media--Bush's executive order allowed that too.|`|IasHMWM2aa	President Obama has the legal right to exercise the expanded powers of the presidency established under our president Bush.

Apparently it has deteriorated significantly. It is a shame that we took our eye off the ball in Afghanistan after Iraq, which was pretty much early 2003 on, so that's the better part of six years of neglect. I don't know, I hope this troop surge works, it did a lot better than I and many others expected in Iraq.|`|a388e4e3066dcb4e1de9e18979b89ef0aa	I have a 17 year old son...he and i are cool about Afghanistan...but really don't comprehend Iraq as being necessary for peace in the USA|`|50zbKv0jaa	the american military disaster has to be fixed|`|Lc6o6w8Maa	Good.

Additional troops and supplies could not be sent because the Democratic Congress would not approve any such thing while Bush was in office.  It did not matter to them if lives are lost and supplies are low, all that mattered to them was trying to make a Republican president look bad.  How dare they???? They should be tried as traitors for not supporting our country and our military during war time!!!!!|`|r8qbCKgfaa	first poster: you're right! we should just let terror exist so we can live in fear. we shouldn't retaliate when people attack us or our allies multiple times. we should sit back and chill whilst our citizens get annihilated.<br>  <br>  That being said, I think going to Afghan land is a bad choice, as bin Laden will end up a martyr, and will only fuel the fire. That is, unless Obama releases him like hes doing to the hundreds of other terrorists on Guantanamo Bay...|`|FdZtCnwhaa	No, the USSR had no luck with going into Afghanistan, but I do support our troops training a military for the country so they can handle it internally.|`|86990ea910ba06fc1046c0e615f983d3aa	Yep.

q4EXFhV7aa	Um, they don't try to get tax deductions for their charitable giving. Why do republican millionaires in congress report every last dollar they donate to charity for a write-off? While it is true that McCain claimed more in charitable deductions, more than 90% of his 'charity' went to his children's private school. I'm sure they are in desperate need.<br>  "Between 2001 and 2006, McCain contributed roughly $950,000 to his own foundation. That accounted for all of its listed income other than for $100 that came from an anonymous donor. During that same period, the McCain foundation made contributions of roughly $1.6 million. More than 90% went to his kids’ private schools, most of which was donated when his children were attending those institutions. So McCain received major tax deductions for supporting elite schools attended by his children." <a href="http://harpers.org/archive/2008/02/hbc-90002519" rel="nofollow">http://harpers.org/archive/2008/02/hbc-9...</a>|`|NMaCcyeKaa	So?  Charity is voluntary, no compulsary.  How is this any grounds for criticism?<br>  <br>  Democrats want government to take care of the disadvantaged, so people can focus on taking care of themselves.  Republicans want government to leave the disadvantaged high and dry so they have to rely on charity.  The Republicans system seems less reliable to me.  I wonder if the only reason Republicans donate so much to charity is to justify their political positions.<br>  <br>  Edit for Jakki S:  I must be an atypical liberal then because I donate about 10% of my income to charity.  I know that's not as impressive as the McCains, but I earn less than $50k  per year.  Please refrain from your generalizations; they offend me.|`|yeu09pfOaa	That is typical of liberals ... they give very little to charity in comparison to conservative|`|50zbKv0jaa	guilt for leaving them to die in new orleans|`|86990ea910ba06fc1046c0e615f983d3aa	Probably because most of that money you donate doesn't really get used for the project you donated to. It's a fact. I only donate in the form of items. At Chrismas, I get a gift for a needy child. I donate outgrown winter coats to the police dept because they collect them for the needy kids. I donate to Goodwill and I give to Toys For Tots. That's as far as I go because they are the only organizations I KNOW will recieve my donation. <br>  <br>  As for the Obama's. They recently just finished paying off their student loans. I'm pretty sure they were putting money back for their kids college or something equally important. You don't KNOW why they don't donate more. <br>  <br>  McCain is much wealthier than the Obama's and his wife pretty much spends her life doing charity work. It's a given that they would give more.|`|BRd0G6lCaa	speaking of campaign slogans, shouldn't Bush's have been something along the lines of <br>  "working for the American people, as long as they don't ask questions, don't pay attention, think the vice president has as much power as the actual president and happen to need trillions of dollars of debt."<br>  if you're going to call out Obama-Biden for not donating to charity, why don't you call out your good old boys about the horrible crimes against our country they have committed. <br>  get over it and take some oxycontin with your pal Rush, you need it to stay so delusional.
651a651e9e9b67965456fb9edd123aafaa	I'd hope limbaugh.. He's flipping super almighty rich.. <br>  <br>  Obama has donated hundreds of thousands I've read..

That was an issue before he was elected and it was on all the news networks.  <br>  <br>  I don't know anything about Limbaugh or how much he donates to charity but I do know that it is a fact that republicans donate more time, money, and blood to charity than democrats.|`|8aXimsjBaa	Rush L.

But it does rankle me that somebody who is in default on his mortgage is going to get a big "discount" on the price of his house.  I have always paid my mortgage on time and I'm not.  But it's better than having the banking system collapse and having the market flooded with houses that have been foreclosed on.<br>  <br>  The bill should provide that if a homeowner who gets a bailout sees his house for more than its net cost, the proceeds in excess of that net cost should go to repay the discount.|`|JIvvg6f7aa	I dont want a stimulous check.

I believe that many Republicans who believe this is unfair are not saying that they are not getting their piece of the pie. We are just stating facts. To take away from the taxpayers (the people who are working hard) to give to causes that will not stimulate the economy is unfair. Bailing out people whose houses are going to be foreclosed because they cannot pay their mortgage is not fair. I STRUGGLE to pay my mortgage and no one is going to bail me out. But I do not want them to. I know that I'm SUPPOSED to pay my mortgage. I'm not waiting on a bailout or a rescue plan. I'm pro life and $700 million of this "stimulus" plan will fund abortions abroad. I dont think thats fair. If I wanted to pay to murder a child, I'd cut planned parenthood a check. But I don't but since I'm a taxpayer, I guess I'm just screwed....It's things like this that I find unfair. Not that I'm not getting anything out of it.

Funny how they all said they want nothing from him, but they are the first ones complaining that it's not enough.<br>  What they should be hoping for is that this will fix the whole country, (which benefits all of us in the longrun) not JUST their lives, but that's how selfish people act.|`|eOwPWu4maa	The government shouldn't be redistributing wealth like this, but since they are, then whether or not you are against it, you should receive your fair share.

Who more appropriate than the Attorney General to call attention to the issue many conveniently deny exists.  <br>  <br>  People who are offended or protest the statement by Attorney General Holder have not had the experience of drinking from a "colored only" water fountain.  <br>  <br>  Racism hides in many customary structures that people on various sides of the equation are reluctant to challenge.  Beneficiaries of racial advantage have a vested interest in ignoring the customary disparities.<br>  <br>  Beyond private clubs and organizations the US Senate is a classic example of presumed racial dominance in political life.  The US House of Representatives in contrast demonstrates the diversity of leaders who are in reality evidence of voter community ethnicity.<br>  <br>  The 1968 Kerner Report and the 2008 Eisenhower Foundation (Review of the Kerner Report) Report lend support to the supposition of the Attorney General.  The racial tension and undercurrent during the Presidential campaign is another example of latent discrimination.<br>  <br>  It is most instructive that Attorney General Holder used the phrase "("nation of cowards" on matters of race)" that detractors would attempt to question as unpatriotic.  This is precisely where the suggestion is rooted.|`|tvNkizDraa	I think he makes a valid point because we do have racism and the only way to resolve it is to face it, bring it out in the open, not sweep it under the rug.  <br>  <br>  If racism didn't exist, the focus on Rev.

Lincoln was president in our nations darkest time, i'll give him that, but he did a lot of bad things like putting people in jail for disagreeing with him and shut down newspapers for being on the souths side. The only reason he was considered a good president is because he was the first president to get killed.<br>  <br>  George went through some tough times too, he had to follow a terrible president, the trade center, iran, iraq, and all that stuff.

Neither one is more dangerous than the other, and you should not be drinking if you are under age.<br>  And no, the drinking age should not be lowered IMO.<br>  All you're doing is getting a really early start to liver damage and other health issues.|`|KKH9y0ECaa	Come to Europe, you can drink as much as you like here.<br>  <br>  You can buy and drink wine and beer aged 16 in countries such as France, Belgium, Italy etc.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.icap.org/PolicyIssues/YoungPeoplesDrinking/AgeLawsTable/tabid/219/Default.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.icap.org/PolicyIssues/YoungPe...</a>|`|2d890d7e87135b9825c64c3a73ea74c5aa	Nope I agree with the age limit set. However how is beer dangerous? Its no more dangerous than wine when taken out of moderation. Red wine is healthy for your heart. How old are you. If Im talking to anyone under 21 than yes its wrong you drink wine if it is illegal in your country.|`|w4GOENAKaa	Almost everything is OK in moderation. Drink wine, beer, whatever - just know your limit. I have a son and I will let him try wine when he's 10 or 11. It's much better than soda for sure!|`|8diTOnNiaa	wine has more alcohol than beer|`|v0PY0UDAaa	Want to save lives?<br>  <br>  Lower the drinking age and raise the driving age.  Say 18 for drinking and 21 for driving.<br>  <br>  There, thousands of lives saved.|`|vYgJMybeaa	Alcohol is bad<br>  <br>  it should be illegal
LLoxgn0haa	I find her words to be confusing.<br>  Why did she make the comment at all.<br>  Why tell those you are negotiating with what your priorities are?<br>  She must realize that there would be questions over our failure to get China to talk about their heel being on the throats of the Tibetan people.<br>  She must also realize that not everyone would be happy that no changes are going on in China's human rights violations.<br>  But she has to know that speaking out like she has will only make the task harder later.<br>  I just do not understand her mind set.|`|AKjACjkOaa	not at all|`|QlrIUIfOaa	A wise man once said: "It's the economy, stupid."<br>  <br>  Hillary is right on and realized that if China pulls their support of our debt we are toast.

xBd96wvRaa	I believe you make a valid point. But the KKK clearly states on their website that only whites are welcome to join their 'club'. <br>  <br>  Sure everyone knows you must be black to join the black panthers but their website does not state it. <br>  <br>  Upon judging such a website it must be looked at in a black and white manner, no pun intended, not ones interpretation of the words. <br>  <br>  We have a half white - half black president now I do hope it takes some steam out of this pot.|`|ExCAedp4aa	The Black Panthers are not the same thing as the KKK. The Black Panthers have been a radical group, but the KKK has historically been a violent terrorist organization, guilty of literally thousands of violent crimes.|`|DiDCG9UBaa	I think you're just making all that up.|`|y9N3DsKBaa	NO|`|tmGRe2Jraa	Demanding full employment, equal rights, and fair trials with a jury that isn't likely to be biased or pass judgment based on the race of the defendant does not constitute hate speech.  It wasn't so very long ago that African Americans were prevented from receiving an education, were separated from their families, were forced to work all day without compensation or even respectable living conditions upon pain of death, were bought and sold and worked and slaughtered like cattle.  That's not extremist or racism, it's true, and although President Obama's election marks an important milestone for civil rights, there's still a long way to go.  Pointing that out or attempting to impose sanctions that'll compensate for ongoing discrimination does not a "double standard" make.|`|NrXDYAPGaa	My school blocks the Communist Party website. It makes doing research a lot harder.|`|LzPhdri5aa	There is no double standard.  The Black Panther's are widely regarded as a borderline terrorist, racist extremist organization just like the KKK.<br>  <br>  The fact that you're obsessed with a 'double standard' however, does speak volumes.

You admit you were wrong.  <br>  <br>  With the economy in recession, crimes rates are rising dramatically, and states and municipalities need the extra revenue from citations.  Don't break the law, and you won't have to pay the fine.|`|ZQZCJmD1aa	I am a cop and I've backed off on writing tickets because of the economy. I have given a lot more warnings instead of tickets. I know some people are paycheck to paycheck and a $150 ticket could put them over the edge. My partners have backed off also.|`|b17e71d85e289323782f308374bc9642aa	I haven't noticed it, but I guess I should thank you for the warning. I guess it would be a good time to stop speeding.|`|86990ea910ba06fc1046c0e615f983d3aa	It seems like it. I've seen cars pulled over left and right everywhere. In my tiny little town, they always overlook minor stuff. However, I have 2 friends who got tickets for going 36 in a 35. My son got pulled over for going 55 right before he hit the 35 sign. He wasn't even there yet. And yes, they gave him a ticket. He works at a car dealership as a mechanic and they pulled his boss over for driving a dealer car with no front tag. In Ohio, that's not illegal if it's a dealer car. He had the magnetic tag on the back. The cop actually had to go to his car to research it and ended up letting him off. But he did give him a ticket for no seatbelt. It's getting ridiculous.
f0HneGCiaa	It depends on the sexual harassment laws in your State. Contact an Attorney who specializes in employment discrimination/ sexual harassment, your State Fair Employment & housing, or look online for sexual harassment laws in your State. You can also contact a Civil Rights Attorney as Sexual Harassment can in certain situations be a violation of your civil rights. Get the facts first, then you will need  "evidence" to prove the sexual harassment, the first question you will be asked is "Did you tell this person to "stop?" and how can you "Prove it"? You'll need evidence, witnesses, other victims, it's really hard to prove because the company will have the money to hire the best lawyers and who will you have?|`|zTau6hDIaa	Absolutely.<br>  You should contact your HR department.|`|70e9d9eee37ee3f1f4008f4ae6b92dc8aa	Yes, it is still sexual harassment whether he, "understands," the comments or not. Your boss should still take responsibility and deal with the situation/individual appropriately. Take it to human resources.<br>  <br>  Edit...get tough or get another job.|`|gaXUIduMaa	Absolutely.  Your boss doesn't have to be present during the act so his not knowing what was said is moot.  As soon as he is informed that something inappropriate occurred, it is his responsibility to act on it, even if it is days later.
rIzx4OEWaa	Yes join the army or the royal marines they will take you to a place that is all about politics you may as well learn what it's all about from the bottom up. as for money it will cost you loads until you get elected an then you could be kicked out an unemployed again so give this up now an have a better life one that does not involve causing people to much harm because of greed which is the way most MP's go.|`|nW3iJkT5aa	You have no idea how politics work .<br>  One of your 1st questions is "do they earn a lot" <br>  SON you have ALL the qualifications necessary to become a senior British Politician|`|aFC72tLZaa	Join the republican party and give tax cuts to the wealthy.|`|HGv8Lbd1aa	You can do things like the UKYP (UK Youth Parliament) which I think you're eligible for when you're 17? And I think you can do any A Levels you want and any university degree, although i intend on doing arts based subjects and English at Uni. But I think you can do what you're good at and still get into politics. Join your local labour/conservative/lib dem party once you turn 18 and try and get as involved as possible.|`|4z1gryIGaa	You could always of course go to school to get a formal education in politics. Otherwise why not go to your local alderman, congressman's office and ask to volunteer. You may even be able to volunteer at your mayors office. Work your way up that way. During election years you can even apply to be an electoral judge(they serve at the polling places) I believe you may have to be 18 to do that though. but you may be able to participate in other ways.|`|3secB3Smaa	Start getting involved now in your local politics. Attend town meetings.<br>  Speak up. Study the constitution of the USA and know what it means. <br>  Study history and current events. Join civic groups and get yourself know. In college take political science and criminal justice.<br>  The main thing is that you start now getting involved in community affairs.|`|QnK3ESBdaa	A lot of politicians have law degrees, with political science as their undergraduate degree. That's a good start, you could also volunteer for a local political party and perhaps work getting a particular candidate elected.

Due to their religious beliefs, they believe they are entitled to dictate which actions are to be allowed and which are not, even though no material harm is caused to others - for instance, millions of conservatives were up in arms when the Supreme Court ruled that a Texas law dictating which orifices are allowed to be used during sex was overturned. It's really not possible to get much more totalitarian than regulating the sex lives of others.|`|g2GSdY8Aaa	If your from the left you automatically throw any convictions and morals out the window in the name of tolerance. Conservatives typically hold on to the values that were instilled in them and speak out when the immoralities of tolerance rears itself.|`|NMaCcyeKaa	Conservatives have strong opinions and aren't afraid of saying so.<br>  <br>  In your example, you are being judgmental.  You've made a judgment and voiced it.  That's being judgmental.|`|IG8s8UnSaa	Knowing the difference between right and wrong does not make one judgmental.  I think the liberals just have a chip on their shoulder.|`|c3vPZfghaa	Because conservatives are moderates that swing right.<br>  Right-wing politics are the politics of moral-ism and vehemently opposing anything they view as WRONG. There is no compromise, only their views of right and wrong.<br>  If it was any other way, they would be called liberals.<br>  <br>  And no that particularly wouldn't make you judgmental, since robbing a bank being wrong isn't a contraversial view, nor is it faith-based. What makes you judgmental, is when you rationalize a view based on faith or take a stance on contraversial issues and declare that there is no other way.|`|Gbwiwkauaa	What a joke! Conservatives are some of least moral people that I've ever seen. They're intolerant of other religions or people who do not believe. They want their beliefs forced on everyone else thru legislation. They wine about personal responsibility for everyone but themselves. Don't bail out struggling home owners or people who've lost their jobs, but bail out failed corporations and CEOs who used the bail out money to give themselves huge bonuses.|`|9npIzlHKaa	It's a lack of compassion combined with selfishness that leads to the judgmental nature of conservatives.<br>  The current Repub stance celebrates policies and platforms that incorporate greed and callousness.<br>  They think it makes them "tough" or "rugged individualists" or feel "morally upstanding".|`|noo8vpvzaa	Because it's subjective<br>  <br>  A liberal would say, "If the greedy Republicans would increase welfare, people wouldn't be forced to rob banks"...He's a victim of society, etcetera.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: See Teeewalk up there for proof of what I'm telling you|`|159d24ded141300e0c13cc0b9dc7f716aa	Because truth is relative. But let me explain:<br>  <br>  If I rob you because you have more money than me, then that's Wrong.<br>  <br>  But if I have the Government rob you for me instead, that's perfectly moral and fair.<br>  <br>  Welcome to the after affects of the LSD generation.|`|2vtP7WS7aa	That accusation is used as a smokescreen anytime a conservative makes a point about a moral issue(sometimes any issue at all).|`|9cbd33d2161007ec93c0593d77c8434faa	Because we do not live in a Utopia, we live in reality.  We use common sense|`|TvD9BIGRaa	You mean logical?|`|xKthWOGtaa	Liberals would also say that "Robbing banks is wrong". So that is not a very good example.<br>  <br>  I don't think there is anything wrong with being conservative, or holding conservative values personally. What I do not like about them is that they try to preach and impose these values unto others. It is not the values they hold, it is the way that many of them choose to express them - in a judgmental, inhuman, incompassionate way.<br>  <br>  For example, I don't think there is anything wrong in holding the opinion "abortion is wrong". However, when people go and picket abortion clinics and shout 'murderer' at young teenage women coming out... that is totally disgusting and cold hearted. You might not agree with what they are doing, but is that an excuse to add to their misery, to kick people in the guts while they are down? Granted, not all conservatives behave that way... but enough do that they get the reputation of being judgmental and intolerant.|`|UpZFb6X5aa	Because most are. Here's a few examples. They are all quotes from leading conservatives:<br>  "If you oppose the war you are unpatriotic.<br>  "All liberals are pro-abortion<br>  "all liberals are socialists<br>  "all liberals are atheists<br>  "poor people are just lazy<br>  "Muslims are all terrorists<br>  "Illegal immigrants are all on welfare<br>  <br>  Note that each of these statements is not only judgmental, they are provably false (lies) and in most cases clearly stereotypes (bigotry).<br>  <br>  On a personal note--in 2006 I stated that a recession was likely due to the policies of the Bush administration. I was accused to my face of being anti-American and unpatriotic. In this--as in a thousand other things--their rhetoric, spears, and lies are empty. Reality exposes these extremists (not real conservatives) for what they are. And all their rhetoric and all their lies willnever change one single fact.<br>  <br>  That is why they lost the election. That is why they always lose in the long run.|`|o35cQe3Iaa	The media, schools, newspapers most of them are liberal.  I'm not talking about kinda liberal, I'm talking about Socialist, Communist, Marxist liberal.  They control the news and schools and stuff and a lot of people are just plain stupid and buy into thier madness.  They can't stand the idea of a common sense type of person who strongly believes in religious values and loves our country, Constitution, and Bill of Rights.  They seem to think you have to be 'politically correct'.  Heck, politically correct/incorrect didn't even exist until the 90s.  Who cares about stupid liberals, if they wanna ruin our country, they have their chance to do so, and their off to a darn good start.  I personally believe there will be more conservatives in the future, especially after Obama's presidency.  That's providing our country still exists.|`|hXQ56DQKaa	I think it's because some people consider certain conservative/republican ideas/policies to be judgmental. Like "no gay marriage." Some people see that as people judging gays as bad people. Do you see what I mean? I think this is what you're talking about...|`|o0JEkGCjaa	Because you are.<br>  All libs are on welfare.<br>  All libs are baby killers.<br>  All libs smoke pot.<br>  All libs are hippies.<br>  All libs are lazy.<br>  All libs don't believe in God.<br>  And on. And on. And on. And on. And on.|`|MTkXXOsjaa	Factually speaking, "right" and "wrong" are a matter of opinion as is "good" and "evil."  You might think that robbing a bank is wrong but the bank robber thinks it's right.|`|kT7GCNnCaa	We see right and wrong quickly and tend to stick to that conclusion.  We also tend to exclude emotion when making a decision such as when someone murders another we do not tend to look at the why of the action.|`|akvrwpywaa	No you're not.  But there will always be some ultra-liberal nutcase who will say "But you have to put yourself in the position of that person who was commit the robbery: they needed money and had no other means of getting any..."|`|4KvLIa6Saa	Ever hear of a idea That liberal Dem had that worked> So conservatives are judgmental>|`|d13c4c2bb60f93e106a5ef936fc63dc9aa	Oh....... how all the idiots try.
Fyq5nK4waa	It's not directly.  The Stimulus will not help the economy, it will  only overheat it when the natural business cycle turns upward.  Most of the Stimulus Bill is pay back to Democratic special interest and it was done by lying to the American public.  <br>  <br>  As a Republican, President Bush made a major error by trusting in Paulson and the Bank Bailout.  All he did was reward incompetency and greed on the backs of current and future tax payers.  <br>  <br>  Bad move on President Bush.  Horrific move on President Obama.|`|KztKQSoXaa	That's not the half of it.  Obama is also moving the Census into there control.

I have a friend in Italy, and he said when you ask Italians why they like Obama, they simply say, "he'll change the face of America...he's something new". They don't fully understand the dynamics in America nor the details of the issues this nation faces.

Otherwise, sheesh - Uncle Sam could just print enough money to pay all of our mortgages...heck, just send it to us without our needing to work.  <br>  <br>  When there is too much money in circulation, it loses its value - it's actually not worth as much.  Therefore, things start costing a whole lot more.  It really is a simple economics concept.<br>  <br>  The government can't set price limits on things, nor should they - we live in a free society and deal with a free market.  Businesses look for the best place to buy their goods (or parts) from, and sell them at a reasonable markup.  They compete with each other for our business, and we choose where and who to buy them from.  <br>  <br>  Tell you what - why don't we all take the time to become educated, responsible adults BEFORE we vote, and then we won't end up in this mess?  It really would make the whole thing work out a lot better.|`|Vvgnw0iuaa	ooohhh goody another ''well informed'' voter that elected Obama into office.<br>  <br>  No you just dont print money off for the hell of it like Obama is doing.<br>  When money is not backed  up by gold or silver it causes the dollar to lose value.<br>  <br>  example:<br>  a loaf of bread is say $1.59<br>  but because so much money is being printed and there is no gold or silver to back it up the dollar then loses value so the bread now becomes $4.59 a loaf.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  No, if gov't starts to set too many regulation and controls on too many things it becomes socialistic.<br>  It wont just stop at controlling the price of bread.<br>  The next thing you know they'll be telling you when you're bed time is and what clothes you should wear etc.|`|eHjk9di0aa	Think about what makes a dollar actually worth a dollar? It used to be that the government backed the value with gold. A guarantee that one dollar really was worth what it said it was.<br>  <br>  Now the dollar isn't backed by gold anymore, so if more money is printed it won't be worth a dollar any more ... the more that gets printed the less valuable it becomes. Eventually we would need a wheelbarrow full of dollars to buy a loaf of bread.<br>  <br>  Short answer - printing more money isn't going to fix anything.|`|fqhtSiyxaa	the government owes its people money.|`|gQJqxWKNaa	It would decrease the value of our dollar which is bad.|`|SPsYrJJEaa	Do not let these people upset you Michelle your husband does not understand economics either and he is President.!!|`|fqT3HOXMaa	See 1930s Germany|`|48fkZzzfaa	Please tell me you're not old enough to vote.
S6XSLvjLaa	No.  Apparently it is only racism when the white guy says it.<br>  <br>  excellent point, btw|`|tvNkizDraa	No.  I think most got so upset because they bought into the media's 'caricature' of Rev. Wright instead of digging a bit deeper to learn more about the man and his viewpoints.  If racism didn't exist, the focus on Rev. Wright wouldn't have been a caricature but would have pointed out that the infamous "GD America, Chickens have come home to roost" sound bites were from sermons where he was repeating the words of a (white) UN Ambassador concerning US foreign policy.  The CIA calls it "blow back".  <br>  <a href="http://www.pbs.org/moyers/journal/04252008/profile.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.pbs.org/moyers/journal/042520...</a><br>  <br>  I saw him on Bill Moyer's Journal (PBS) one Friday evening and he struck me as a very learned and thoughtful man.  Then I saw him on C-SPAN's coverage of his appearance at the National Press Club breakfast the following Monday morning, and he came across as more buoyant and yes, strident too.  If there wasn't racism we all could have laughed because Rev. Wright was right... many of us white folks do not know how to clap on the downbeat.    <br>  <a href="http://74.125.47.132/search?q=cache:QX9RT65h1cQJ:www.press.org/members/transcript/20080428_wright.pdf+national+press+club+breakfast+transcript+%22Jeremiah+Wright%22&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=2&gl=us&ie=UTF-8" rel="nofollow">http://74.125.47.132/search?q=cache:QX9R...</a><br>  <br>  My overall impression... on Moyer's program, he 'gave as good as he got'; at the press club breakfast, he played to an audience that hadn't given a fair break and still wouldn't so he "fell on his sword" for Obama.

It is against our second amendment. Simply that.
dxMQAdndaa	I agree completely. It's kind of like how our credit system works. The only way to get credit is to open a line of credit somehow: a credit card, a loan, a mortgage...those who pay off their homes and cars and don't use credit cards ultimately get punished in the long run because their credit comes up as having no credit history. Considering credit is checked for a lot of jobs, this isn't fair. We are basically punishing people for not being in debt!|`|R1B01pPNaa	everyone thinks that spending more money is going to fix the economy..its only going to put us further into debt.

We can debate the best way to stimulate spending, but until we start spending we can only expect more job losses and continued economic instability.<br>  <br>  EDIT<br>  When I say buying, I mean buying homes, buying cars, buying washers and dryers.

If it is something that you can go to driving school over, you just have to show up and sign up for the class.  If it is anything more serious, you will probably have to explain your actions. You will have to pay for the tickets and make arrangements to pay for court costs.  Just be polite and apologetic, and whatever you do, don't act hostile toward the officer. Good luck.

PI8VfiY1aa	Interesting question. The answer will be long because the transition was part of a chain of events. <br>  <br>  Federalist were a party of a strong but small central government, which they believed was necessary to maintain order. Since most federalists were landowners and businessmen, the party tended to support industry. There isn't a single reason why the Federalist party fell apart, but some say it was because the party was too monarchistic and represented a minority, and the ideas of democracy became more and more popular. Jefferson was elected in 1800, the first Democratic Republican, and the Federalist were finished. <br>  <br>  The Democratic-Republican party led by Jefferson was a party that favored the worker more than the industry (which would lead you to think they were more like modern-day democrats), but they also favored state's rights over the federal government regulations, a strict interpretation of the constitution, and they were opposed to a national bank (which makes them sound like modern day republicans). <br>  <br>  The election of 1824 was between John Q. Adams and Andrew Jackson- both were Democratic-republicans. Adams won, but his philosophy was closer to that of the Federalist party. So the Democratic-republican party split into 2 factions. Jackson would create the Democratic Party, and Adams would create the National Republicans. <br>  <br>  The Jacksonian Democrats believed in voting rights for all white males, not just land owners. They also believed in geographical expansion, the spoils system, and free-market economics. There were also Jeffersonian Democrats who believed in the separation of church and state, the advocating of workers rights, a representative democracy, a strong belief in freedom of speech, and keeping the constitution flexible for new generations. The southern democrats, however, were much more conservative than the northern democrats.<br>  <br>  The National Republicans supported a strong central government, a high tariff, a national bank, and increased spending of infrastructure.  Andrew Jackson, the Democrat, ran again in 1828 and won this time. The national republicans nominated Henry Clay as their leader, set to take the office from Jackson in the upcoming 1832 election. Jackson won overwhelmingly, and the National Republicans never ran again for president. They joined with conservative forces to become the Whig Party. <br>  <br>  The Whigs were very much like the National Republicans. The issue of slavery split the party apart. The northern Whigs favored the abolition of slavery, and became the Republican Party. The southern Whigs aligned themselves with conservative Democrats. That is how the 2 major parties were formed. <br>  <br>  But the parties were very different back then. Over time, those conservative democrats would come to represent the southern republicans of today, and conservatism as a whole would come to represent the modern-day republicans, while liberalism would come to represent modern-day Democrats.

BIQrsl4paa	doxidude has it essentially right. However, he forgot to bring up the fact of corporate influence on those same zoning laws. In recent years, it seems that, if given big enough corporate payoffs, local governments will rezone anything, including rezoning residential districts out of existence.|`|vUiUoamVaa	Zoning laws are government regulated restrictions on how a particular piece of land can be used. The zones can be of any type, including housing, financial, and industry. These laws are at least partially an attempt to solve a very real problem. If people by a house in a residential area, they do not want a loud or polluting factory to be opened next door to them. The problem is not the creation of a factory, per se. It's the damage done to the original owners. A house becomes unusable if the sound, smell, or air quality around it is suddenly changed. <br>  <br>  Normally, it would be a city or municipality government (City Council) but it could be the County Commission.

CBpp5Kuwaa	In my opinion the easiest and most practical way is to use encryption.  At the moment the vast majority of web browsing happens over HTTP which is actually a clear text protocol meaning that everything is easily readable, the secure portion is HTTPS where the connection is protected. <br>  <br>  Of course there are numerous ways of protecting your privacy currently -but we will not get any sort of global standard of privacy through any technical IT means simply because Governments are actually looking at increasing surveillance - for instance the European Directive on Mandatory Retention of Communications Traffic Data - actually stipulates that ISP should keep logs of all communication traffic emails, web browsing for up to two years in case it's needed as evidence.<br>  <br>  As we speak many governments are looking at taking all this information and centralising it into an electronic database so that any 'agency' can look up someone's internet history very simply. <br>  The UK Government are looking to introduce this via the intercept program.<br>  <br>  The point I'm trying to make that we are losing privacy and confidentiality by the design of our governments and unless something changes it will be left to individuals to take action themselves.  I can't see the development of any secure global protocol happening anytime soon because of this even with encryption there are loads of different rules restricting its use in many countries because it does protect your privacy.<br>  <br>  There are a few programs available that do protect your anonymity but many people seem to focus on anonymous proxies or piecemeal solutions which simply don't work.<br>  <br>  We need to actively protect our privacy and support projects like TOR which will stop our governments monitoring our every move, treating us all like criminals and damaging the right to freedom of speech.|`|trMsK86jaa	By removing the ability for hosts, federal or otherwise, to check I.P addresses.<br>  <br>  Without an I.P signature, their skills are useless.<br>  <br>  That goes for security agencies interested in investigating people's backgrounds too.<br>  <br>  <br>  p.s; not that i'm saying people will simply be coerced into it, but the simple fact is that no matter what system you use there is a flaw.|`|zmxMrOO3aa	dont post anything private on the internet simple as that the internet is not the place for that not even if the website has a password there are ways...

Government is only good during the time that it works for a group of people.  Governments have winners and losers.  You just have to hope that the government that you live in works for you personally.  <br>  <br>  Governments only stay in control until they no longer work for the people that the are governing.  I.e., the Kings and Queens worked for years for different countries but they no longer work when so many people are education and want a say in the way they live and in most cases the governments were miss managed by the kings and queens or environmental events changed the needs of the people.  <br>  <br>  In the case of Marie Antoinette, she and her husband were doing the same government that their parents did but they could not handle the changing environmental changes that were effecting the population that they were governing, they did not understand that the crops were not coming in and their people were looking to them for help.  The government was no longer working for enough of the people of France, therefore the government (Marie Antoinette and her husband) was blamed for the changes that the king and queen could not understand or/and control.  <br>  <br>  Currently, the world governments are in the same boat and need to do an overhaul of their governments to work with the growing environmental and social issues that are happening before the people over throw them.|`|6ZkXL8mRaa	its not the government that the prob. its all the people in it & who run it. their the 1's who make everytghing hell. but the governemnt shud be for the people & ONLY for the people. that wut it was meant for. it shud hav people in it who pay their taxes & dont defend porno people! -_- just to name a few things. but anyway, the people in government shud be honest,true,non-greedy,non-ignorant, non-arrogant & non evil. but oh well. until people start shootin them evil litl sukers....were doomed|`|dE7b0odvaa	An even number of Democrats and Republicans working TOGETHER AS A TEAM with zero BS.|`|c82ecbef231aced5c49891502424aad3aa	There really is no best system each system has it's ups and downs.|`|TDJsIjfyaa	FAIR AND PEACEFUL|`|ss0vy4tFaa	the one founded by abe lincoln|`|e149d8651ec2a8062fd5aee0bdd23a16aa	Yes I do but it is less than  perfect.

To assume that simply b/c Obama is in office racism is dead  is to lie to yourself. Go see if the KKK is still alive and kicking. George Bush did such a terrific job of fouling up just about any Democrat could've won. More African Americans are going to college and assuming more  prosperous roles in society. That socioeconomic status will most likely be passed on to following generations. Does a college degree guarantee anything? Does it guarantee the interviewer doesn't have issues with you as soon as walk in the door? The human heart is a dark and secretive place. Just look at the woman in the Justice Department who was fired for being a supposed lesbian. She was the most qualified person in the country for her position yet the Republican appointee Monica Goodling, ugh her name makes sick, fired her because Mrs. Goodling has issues with lesbians.  <br>   I agree with the comment that we could move to an economic disadvantage program and probably get the better results as women and minorities are still facing inequalities. To those who think that racism is dead just talk a walk down the street with me and see how many white women clutch their purses in fierce protection. It is kind of fun just to mess with their heads a bit. lol.|`|BUI2nlUVaa	jesus are we still on this one...there's a black man sitting in the oval office for christ sake.  affirmative action is BS, has been proven to be BS, and will always be BS.  What it does is require an employer to hire people who may not otherwise be qualified into a position based on the color of their skin.  I can think of nothing more racially biased than that.  We've all been to any government office anywhere in the US and seen affirmative action in place.  you know, the black woman, chomping on her gum, speaking ebonics.  i know it's a sterotype, but i'm proving a point here.  I would love to see that same position filled by an intelligent black woman.  If she applied for the job and is qualified then great.  Problem is that we give dipshit these jobs and then can't understand why government has so much waste associated with it.  <br>  <br>  Fact of the matter is, 51% of the students in Los Angeles County will not graduate from high school....51%....Yet LA has the highest per capita spending on students than anywhere else in the nation.  You see, they can gets them a job because the white man owes them.  Get outta here with that crap.  These idiots should be working where they are, sweeping up floors and mopping up vomit.  This is all they're qualified for.  So when the black population puts an emphasis on education and stops whining about their lot in life then maybe, just maybe we can put all this affirmative action crap behind us.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Yes people do still discriminate that goes without saying.  The point i was making with obama in the white house is that you need to stop bitching about what you can't do and start focusing on what can be done.  Everyone has barriers in their lives, not just minorities.  I have a disability...you don't think that employer's take one look at me and say...damn, we're really going to have to pay  a lot of money for that one?  Do you really want to work for an employer who is thinking that in his head, especially if he is forced to take you in due to affirmative action.  NO.  Take some responsibility for yourselves and stop whining.  Find a job that suits you and that you are qualified for.  But you have to make yourself worthy....no one is going to just throw that at you.  It is a proven fact that having a college degree increases your net worth 10 times over the course of your lifetime against someone without a college degree.  This isn't different if you're black or white.  So get off your *** and start making something of yourself.  Stop waiting in line for a government handout.  All you're doing is playing into the stereotype that you so adamantly deny.<br>  <br>  And while I'm on the subject of stereotying can you tell your people to learn to tip...I've managed a restaurant for several years and seriously, black people don't tip for crap.  Less than 5% usually.  Had a table only give $5 on a  check of $120.  This is an every day occurance even to my black servers.  I can't figure it out.  It's not like it's just a smattering here or there, it's every table, every time.  Why is that?   Then they'll ***** about bad service when my server, who has served the same table over and over, ignores them for someone who wil actually pay for the service?

TAYErNRkaa	So, in a perfect world with all things being equal, you might have an argument. But in this world, there are intangibles, strengths and life experiences that can add to the value of a resume that just might change the leader board when competing for a job or promotion. Your gal had 10 years exp in mgmt and a degree from harvard. Your two boys had 2 yrs exp to bring to the position with no degree. To most people with an equitable spirit it would sound like a no brain-er, and that harvard girl should be hired. But, after the third interview, a observed a check in her body language in regards to a certain question, and I hit her with a flag. Also, her persona is a bit blue-blooded, and I questioned whether she would fit well with my team, or would she cause a rift. One of the guys applying for the same position had a lot less experience than the woman, but he was so upbeat and genuine and had superior people skills. I also found out that his background as a teenager and young adult working with his uncle would give me tools to build off of, and he had vertical potential. I hired him. Am I wrong?|`|bc830b1601cd7380ec1f17c83fef3a4eaa	I would give her the job.<br>  <br>  Too much is placed on how well someone kisses up to the bosses these days.

Not because of some stupid moral high-ground, but because I don't have to kiss-up to be kept around. I have done a good enough job that I am still employed.|`|BpcgaJd4aa	You have to prove discrimination. If the boss chose someone else over her thats not enough to say he discriminated against her.|`|gkrNPM5Daa	This boss, does he have no choice of who he hires? He has to hire based on merit? He can't choose his employees for his business based on whatever criteria he chooses? Logic would say hire the person that will be most profitable and you could assume the skilled person would be that choice. But there again isn't it the bosses choice if he wants his business to profit or fail? <br>   The argument you speak of is that people with less merits should not be hired ahead of the best person for the job just because they are some kind of minority. AA forces that boss to hire people with less skill so as to be fair to society regardless of how that effects HIS business. <br>   White will be a minority in US before my lifetime is over, your best bet would be to let these AA laws go. These laws will be potent when used by such skilled people when they are the "underdog".|`|GHusBLjgaa	You kind of vague on what your role is here, so I will answer as if I was the boss of the guy who did not hire the woman who was the best person for the job in your example.<br>  <br>   I would call that guy in to my office and tell him for not doing what is in the companies best interest he has 2 hours to clear out his office. If not security will escort him out of the building. Then we make that guy a poster child for what happens if you do not hire the best qualified person for the job.|`|AA11707728	Yeah ummm, you seem not to understand that affirmative action is not related to discrimination. Or rather, it is a type of discrimination that is inappropriate as any other, yet sanctioned or even institutionalized.<br>  <br>  In the example above, the woman would be protected from discrimination by laws completely unrelated to AA.<br>  <br>  AA is much more the case when a black person(AA is almost solely an issue of race, not gender) shows up for a job with no education and no experience and isnt even close to having the ability to do the job.  Yet, he is hired even though there are 4 other applicants with education, experience and proven track record for that position.  There is a word for that....racism.  And it's a big problem wherever AA is implemented.  Because, what happens is this.  Everyone knows that applicant can't do the job.  So they put him someplace out of the way, give him a task that makes him look busy.  And then shunt all the work that he should be doing to his coworkers.  This, of course, pisses off the coworkers, who then leave, to be replaced with lower skilled workers who have to work under such conditions because they can't get jobs anywhere else.  The business eventually folds and everyone becomes unemployed.  <br>  <br>  It's that last issue that makes AA so intolerable that it is being outlawed in state after state.|`|AA11819105	Private company's should be able to hire who they want and need not what a corrupt government makes them do.<br>  We need to go back to our Constitution and kick all the anti American groups out of D.C.|`|159d24ded141300e0c13cc0b9dc7f716aa	In Free-Enterprise Capitalism (as if you can find this anymore!) bosses who do not hire the most qualified people become less productive than the competition and therefore fail.<br>  <br>  Free-Enterprise Capitalism is fundamentally anti-racist and anti-sexist.

Only idiots bound for failure hire people based upon their race or gender.<br>  <br>  Now that we're a State Capitalist country, things are different. You will hire who the government says you can hire. If your organization fails, the taxpayers will support you. <br>  <br>  Affirmative Action uses the coercive power of the State to force people to hire employees because of  their race. AA is therefore racist in nature.|`|Ga3lCQTNaa	It really boils down to this.

yX4xVukPaa	This is old new... the short version goes like this:<br>  <br>  Scientology doesn't like to be criticised. Someone posted a video of Tom Cruise behaving like a nutcase, talking about scientology, on youtube. Scientology had it took down. Anonymous didn't like that. <br>  <br>  Anonymous started reading about scientology and discovered there were loads of other reasons to not like scientology. They decided to do something about it. <br>  <br>  First they DDoSed, hacked, black faxed and prank called. Then they discovered the peaceful and perfectly legal protests in real life worked much better and annoyed the scientologist a lot more...<br>  <br>  Fox News ran a highly misleading peice about Anon, saying it was a "domestic terrorist organisation". This was at the time common scientology propaganda. The implication is that Greta Van Susteren persuaded Fox News to follow that propaganda line. No other respectable news organization reported Anon in that way. <br>  <br>  Anon enjoys feuds... but the Fox News thing is ancient in internet term - it happened last year. You can see typical scientology attitudes as posted by "Mary" in the comments section of the article you link to.

9QBlKlFmaa	Jordan is indeed Palestine.  This Arab state already was carved out of 76% of mandatory Palestine.  It was first called Transjordan and now is known as Jordan.  It was given as a gift to Emir Abdullah by the British.<br>  <br>  The so-called "occupied" territories of Gaza and Judea and Samaria, known as the West Bank never belonged to the so-called "Palestinians"; Israel won them in a war of self-defense from Egypt and Jordan respectively. Furthermore both countries relinquished their claims to the territories, so whose territory is Israel occupying? The answer is they are not occupied; they are rightfully part of Israel, as is the Golan Heights which Israel also won from Syria in the same war in self-defense. Yet even Israel itself and its supporters have bought into this false narrative of Israel being an occupier. <br>  <br>  <br>  .|`|Fb519XJgaa	For the last 60 years, the Palestinian Refugees are living in a United Nation Refugee Camps waiting for UN to implement the UN Security Council resolutions. For the last 60 years, Israel conducts collective punishment and state terror against the Palestinian Refugees.<br>  <br>  Reading the Revolutionary Education Philosophy of Thomas Jefferson and compare it what is going on in Israel VS Palestine issue. We find that education played a major role in the Palestinian demand for freedom, self-determination and liberation from a forced occupation.<br>  MR. Jefferson said that the liberation of the slaves can be achieved by education when the slaves get educated they will ask for their natural rights as human being.<br>  All Men are created equal by God was the key to African American liberation from slavery? In the holy land the two States solution is the key to Palestinian liberation which go back to 1947 Security Council resolution called 181 or the partition plan. In the USA education was needed on both sides the Slaves and Masters. In the Holy Land, education is needed on the Israeli side where the Israeli must understand that the land is for the two people equally. A viable Palestine means a viable Israel and no viable Palestine means no viable Israel and wars go on between the two people. <br>  <br>  If the Messiah is coming today who will he save the Palestinians whose lands was taken by force and living in a Refugee Camps for the last 50 years. Or the Israelis forces, which took the Palestinian, home and land and cities? <br>  The Messiah is fare and justice and love and peace how can he stand on the occupation side.<br>  <br>  Occupying other people by force is losing policy in the past and now and has no future.<br>  No one could "NOT" change his mind unless he has no mind.|`|Z03zgM0maa	Yes it is a UN made conflict. After world war II the U.N. more specifically the U.S. and the U.K. decided to create the state of Israel in the middle east to compensate for their losses during the holocaust. The Arab nations did not agree, but they did it anyway. So the Palestinians were forced to move so that the Jews could move into their neighborhood. Not a good idea by the U.N. It is what it is.|`|teKeLxX2aa	An intelligent question. Yes, the current conflict is UN made, there would be no Jewish state of Israel in the former Palestinian territory had UN Resolution 181 not been placed. <br>  <br>  As for the solving of the conflict, I wouldn't dream on any future solution to last very long. Both nations are very volatile and have extreme prejudice against one another, probably as great as any two races or religions in recent history (it would be comparable to cats and dogs, without state of the art fighter jets and suicide vests).<br>  <br>  That's not to say that it hasn't been proven that historical enemies can eventually form truces. It was possible for France and Britain to come to some sort of truce after arguably hundreds or even thousands of years of war, but there are a variety of reasons for that. For one thing, they don't exist in nearly the same proximity to one another. Also, while it may have been an issue in some past conflicts, religion is no longer a key issue of which any wars between the two nations in the future would be rooted from. <br>  <br>  Religious fanaticism has tended to tame down quite a bit in the Western World in recent times. But both the Israelis and Palestinians have radical religion being the focal point of their current ongoing conflict. Unless the most strictly religious and stubborn people in the world become less religious, any ceasefires or social stability in the future will be few and far between. Understand that both sides are backwards, in that they are willing to kill one another for a singular God they both worship, and regardless that both religious texts stress the principals of morality and humanity.   <br>  <br>  UN Resolution 181 was as poorly conceived as the British's Partition of India in 1947. Their execution of the two state solution over there resulted in unprecedented mass violence in a matter of weeks, estimated casualties ranging from 500,000 to 1 million.|`|aR1OiJ7Waa	Why can't these damned muslim heathens get off Jewish property?

I question the wisdom of connecting cities with it; I prefer instead to build monorails within major cities.  But it requires a huge amount of construction, providing for more longterm jobs in building it; as well as a large amount of resources that provide jobs for people who provide those resources (like steel).<br>  <br>  And afterwards, it saves greatly on gas and oil, thus helping to break us free from the oil that is provided by terrorist supporting nations like Saudi Arabia.

bcc62a4f188c1522006cc8ba2c7b102aaa	The one claiming Iraq was  involved no doubt. For the people still questioning the obvious lies of the Bush administration.<br>  <a href="http://www.alternet.org/story/16274" rel="nofollow">http://www.alternet.org/story/16274</a><br>  However CT claiming the US government was involved should not be underestimated. That conspiracism has penetrated the American conscious and replaced ideological awareness, political insight and debate for a big part is a major reason why leaders such as the Bush administration can sell their CT, including the one about Iraqi involvement to a substantial part of the public. Conspiracism is a cancer because to the believers premises can never be disproved.  Facts become irrelevant and easily dismissed. "NIST, the BBC, PBS, Al Jazeera are part of the cover up" is exactly the same mindset as "The Iraqi WMD were moved to Syria" or that tries to spin the yellowcake story into justification for the attack. It's an addictive mindset detached from logic that sees any even opposing signs only as more proof the theory is correct. You can't disproof a negative, yet that's about the only thing that would make conspiracy theorists give up their beliefs.<br>  <br>  So the answer is yes the Iraq CT has done a lot more damage but other 911 conspiracies aren't innocent.<br>  <br>  Radical politics and social analysis have been so effectively marginalized in the US that much of what passes for radicalism is actually liberal reformism with a radical-looking veneer. To claim a link between liberalism and conspiracism may sound paradoxical, because of the conventional centrist/extremist assumption that conspiracist thinking is a marginal, "pathological" viewpoint shared mainly by people at both extremes of the political spectrum. Centrist/extremist theory's equation of the "paranoid right" and "paranoid left" obscures the extent to which much conspiracist thinking is grounded in mainstream political assumptions.<br>  Consider a message sent through a computer bulletin board for progressive political activists. Following an excerpt from a Kennedy assassination book, which attributed JFK's killing to "the Secret Team--or The Club, as others call it...composed of some of the most powerful and wealthiest men in the United States," the subscriber who posted the excerpt commented,<br>  ===We, the American people, are too apathetic to participate in our own democracy and consequently, we have forfeited our power, guided by our principles, in exchange for an oligarchy ruled by greedy, evil men--men who are neurotic in their insatiable lust for wealth and power....And George Bush is just the tip of the iceberg.<br>  Scratch the "radical" surface of this statement and you find liberal content. No analysis of the social order, but rather an attack on the "neurotic" and "greedy, evil men" above and the "apathetic" people below. If only we could get motivated and throw out that special interest group, "The Club," democracy would function properly. <br>  All of these perspectives assume inaccurately that (a) the US political system contains a democratic "essence" blocked by outside forces, and (b) oppression is basically a matter of subjective actions by individuals or groups, not objective structures of power. These assumptions are not marginal, "paranoid" beliefs-they are ordinary, mainstream beliefs that reflect the individualism, historical denial, and patriotic illusions of mainstream liberal thought.<br>  To a large degree, the left is vulnerable to conspiracist thinking to the extent that it remains trapped in such faulty mainstream assumptions.|`|SkWzsnuxaa	Please show us these quotes from Bush Cheney and Fox News that establish your claim.

When governments try to legislate your mind and body they are getting a little to intrusive to tolerate.  The best approach is to reward people for having 2 or less children and encourage them through benefit to voluntarily have themselves surgically prevented from having more.<br>  <br>  Make having a swarm of children impossible to benefit from at least so far as the system is concerned and people will have fewer children.  Some people never will of course.  But many would hesitate to have a third or fourth child if the cost far exceeded any possible benefit.<br>  The woman who had 8 children will end up getting 6 or so of them declared to be handicapped and she will receive a check each month that will more then cover their cost and keep her in wealth as well.  If she cannot then she will appeal to charity and make money that way.  So long as there is a potential profit from mass manufacturing kids, people will do it.

If you have the attitude that your not your brothers keeper, you've never had a brother. I'm not trying to profile or categorize or stereotype any of you.

But when the shows over, and life is beautiful once again you wondered why you were so worried about an insecure power-tripping bully in the first place.

When we compromised our Christian beliefs, we get this, this that seems like a nightmare, but we allowed it to slowly happen.  We have to make the people follow the  Bible, and then with that they will uphold the Constitution. But those men didn't care about what God/Jesus said for us to follow and to lead a better life and that if we were going to follow we would get Eternal Life with our Savior, but they stopped believing, so now why would they care about a Constitution, now????

He often references this credential in touting his own knowledge and understanding of the Constitution.<br>  <br>  But what does he really know about the U.S. Constitution?<br>  <br>  How does he actually view it?<br>  <br>  Does he see the Constitution, as the framers did, binding the authority of the federal government?<br>  <br>  Or, does he take the view prevalent in most U.S. universities and law schools today that the Constitution is a "living, breathing document" that adapts to changing times, conditions and mores?<br>  <br>  You don't need to be a "scholar" to understand the Constitution. It was written to be easily understood by ordinary people – ranchers and farmers and men who worked with their hands in the 18th century. In addition to leaving us with the final document, the framers left us with hundreds of pages of writings about the debates they had with each other over the drafting and ratification process.<br>  <br>  There can be little mistake about what they meant, what they had in mind, what they were thinking and why if you take the time to read the Constitution and those papers.<br>  <br>  The legal debate today is over whether we should follow the letter and spirit of the Constitution, or whether is merely a symbolic guidepost whose meaning can be changed by clever arguments by attorneys and judges.<br>  <br>  Is it really necessary for us to take seriously the restrictions the Constitution places on the powers of the federal government?<br>  <br>  To that all-important question, I'm afraid the unequivocal answer from Barack Obama is a resounding "no."<br>  <br>  Let me quote his own words, from pages 92-93 of "The Audacity of Hope":<br>  <br>  "What the framework of our Constitution can do is organize the way by which we argue about our future. All of its elaborate machinery – its separation of powers and checks and balances and federalist principles and Bill of Rights – are designed to force us into a conversation, a 'deliberative democracy' in which all citizens are required to engage in a process of testing their ideas against an external reality, persuading others of their point of view, and building shifting alliances of consent. Because power in our government is so diffuse, the process of making law in America compels us to entertain the possibility that we are not always right and to sometimes change our minds; it challenges us to examine our motives and our interests constantly, and suggests that both our individual and collective judgments are at once legitimate and highly fallible."<br>  <br>  What does that mean?<br>  <br>  Not much, I'm afraid.<br>  <br>  Considering the man taught constitutional law at a major university, the lack of clarity and precision in this written statement is astounding and somewhat alarming.<br>  <br>  There's not much substance here, at all. It's not much more than gibberish. But let me attempt to decipher it.<br>  <br>  The long and the short of it, as far as I can tell, is this: "The Constitution is not the binding law of the land. Instead, it is a framework for stimulating debate – a guidepost for testing our ideas."<br>  <br>  In other words, Barack Obama reads the Constitution like he reads the Bible. Both, he believes, contain some good ideas. But no one should take either too literally.<br>  <br>  Last year, Obama talked about the kind of judges he would appoint – especially to the U.S. Supreme Court. We all understand, or should, that the job of a judge is to interpret the law, not make it. The role of the judge is to apply the law without fear or favor. The judge is not supposed to bend and twist the law to shape an agenda.<br>  <br>  Yet, look at what Obama is looking for in his judicial appointments: "We need somebody who's got the heart, the empathy, to recognize what it's like to be a young teenage mom. The empathy to understand what it's like to be poor, or African-American, or gay, or disabled, or old. And that's the criteria by which I'm going to be selecting my judges."<br>  <br>  Those are nice sentiments, indeed – but altogether rather narrow, don't you think?<br>  <br>  For instance, I'd also like to see judges appointed who have empathy for people who work hard, keep their families together, obey the law and contribute to their communities. I don't see many federal judges or members of Congress who have much of an appreciation for people like that and the sacrifice and commitment it requires.<br>  <br>  But, more to the point, Barack Obama is speaking here in code. He is telling his constituency that he is going to appoint judges who will continue to transform the Constitution from the document designed to shackle the government to one that frees Washington to do whatever it wants whenever it wants.<br>  <br>  In other words, he intends to unshackle the government from constitutional res|`|iKEjXj5Gaa	Go sailor wrote a good answer .<br>  <br>  you absolutly must fight them with patience and humour.<br>  The federal governement do know that there are boundaries which must not be over passed!  because the executive power will not obbey and in your case the majority in not very marge for them 52% of voices.Sure it's <br>  the majority and a better way is to fight according the rule of democratie.<br>  They will fall like a rotten pear by the stem because in their head they are not clean and wear the discorde germ!|`|C3gaC24Iaa	"The Constitution can not be breached."???<br>  Obama did it directly, last summer, in Iraq, through his violation of the Logan Act.<br>  Nothing was said.<br>  Nothing was done.<br>  <br>  Evidently, the constitution is used only when it is convenient, under a democrat (Socialist/Marxist) system.|`|BpcgaJd4aa	Yes, we have to elect people who actually strictly adhere to it and stop re-electing the same politicians.<br>  The politicians we have now are like teenage kids running wild and they're constantly pushing the boundaries to see what they can get away with.|`|zejFr1Ciaa	It has been for over two hundred years but somehow I get a creepy felling that's all about to change.|`|teKeLxX2aa	In response to 'Red', a violent revolution on behalf of any armed militia against the federal government would end in an absolute disaster (making the Veterans march following WWI look like a picnic). During the times of only small arms and cannons perhaps, but not in the modern day (let alone the fact that the US is the single most powerful and technologically advanced military superpower to ever exist). But you have the idea, a militia protected by the 2nd amendment was so citizens could resist the wrongful use of its governments powers when they were no longer in the best interest of the people. But violence against the government is treason and wouldn't be advisable unless you were suicidal (Don't even think about it). <br>  <br>  People should know where the lines are drawn at all times, so when the government does overstep its boundaries they'll be there to counter it through nonviolent and productive means. Your congressman is there for a reason, so your voice and the ones like yours can make their way up the chain. Given the chaotic circumstances of the state of our nation, the upper echelons of our nations government probably have their hands too full to give any serious consideration to what the people are thinking (because everyone is very upset right now). <br>  <br>  Through careful study of American history, you'll notice that there have been a variety of times where our constitution has been stretched and even broken by the federal government. Take the McCarthy era, in which people who didn't fully agree with the government were put on a witch trial of sorts, having absolutely no regard for citizens rights under the first or fifth amendment. Eventually, so many people got fed up with him (including other politicians) that he was ousted from power (and ended up dieing shortly thereafter). There were a variety of rights been squashed and abused by the federal government during the entire Vietnam/Civil Rights Era, which is why millions of people protested and rebelled nearly every way they could. Luckily it never turned into mass violence (The Kent State shooting by National Guardsman is usually cited as being the bloodiest incident and major turning point) so that by the early seventies, by after years of social unrest the government began giving into the People's demands (People of different color were given equal rights, and the war effort began dissolving considerably). However, none of that would've happened if millions of people weren't visibly frustrated, and if somewhere along the upper echelons of our government, politicians weren't beginning to worry about what might happen if things continued to escalate.<br>  <br>  It is your civic duty to use all rights afforded to you by the highest law of the land for a cause you deem worthy. Our rights will disappear or be over-ridden if people sit idle and assume them to be everlasting based solely off of the 'goodwill' of politicians and powerful interest groups (corporations, political philanthropist, etc.)|`|QQsIPlV2aa	I don't know about the Constitution bein "BINDING" Just like THE LAW OF THE LAND!

National security during a time of war  is a good example.  The trick is to determine exactly what "unusual circumstances" is defined as.  ...and that's where the big problem comes in and because of it our Constitution hasn't one chance in 100 of surviving the next four years.  To a certain segment of our society everything is a "crisis" and constitutes "unusual circumstances."|`|ae54718496dc216dbde0762324f5ee8caa	No, sorry it isn't. You see some Socialists who today call themselves Liberals, can elect a pretender they insist is a President, and he will be allowed to break the Constitution by personally taking control of unbiased agencies of the government, like Obama has the Census bureau. For what purpose? So he knows where his "enemies" are, and can shut them up without the rest of us knowing about it. Sounds a little like Hitler, doesn't it? Sounds a lot like Karl Marx, right before the Russian Revolution doesn't it? Everyone in power, and with a voice to the people was shot point blank in the head, hung, or cooked alive while the rest of the citizens stayed uninformed, naive, or afraid to tell for fear of the same fate.<br>  <br>  Americans better be GD scared of the power Obama can wield, and is, because if they're not, they're fools, and it will take living in the hell Socialism creates to teach them they don't like Socialism. They will then wish they had used the free education the American taxpayer had paid for for every year of their lives, and more...they will want to know what all those History books said that lay in the Library right now, growing dust on a shelf...FREE to read.<br>  <br>  I wonder when Obama's order for the book-burning will begin?|`|ujIinLzGaa	Yes, it is binding!  Unless it is amended, which requires ratification for each proposed amendment by at least 2/3 of the states.<br>  <br>  We need to recall, criminally try, or impeach those politicians who do not adhere to the Constitution.  Obama is guilty of subverting the Constitution, fraud, and breach of contract for his conduct since he took office, and he needs to be called to account.  The way to do this is through proper legal proceedings, which will only happen if enough of us lean hard enough on our politicians to get them to carry them out.<br>  <br>  New Hampshire has a resolution to secede (Google HCR 6 if you want to read it) if Obama keeps doing what he has been doing to subvert the Constitution he swore to uphold and defend.  8 other states are drafting similar resolutions, and additional states are talking about doing so as well.  If they carry this forward, we could actually end up in another civil war, depending on what Obama decides to do.  So, it would obviously be a lot better if many more people started demanding that their elected officials do something about this.  Sitting around discussing it among ourselves is not enough.|`|JthubNIsaa	Not anymore.

AA10932453	This has historical roots in the 1950s.  The Army developed an entire "technical" rank structure that included Spec-4 through Spec-9.  The idea was to provide rank/pay/privileges to soldiers in special fields that did not fit the usual squad-leader/section-leader/platoon-serg... mold.<br>  <br>  Most of the Spec ranks disappeared during the Vietnam War.  The Spec-5 helicopter pilots all went WO and so on.  The only rank that didn't have a good reason for disappearing was the Corporal/Spec4 rank.<br>  <br>  Today, there is only one class of 'specialists' -- the E-4 'specialists'.  In 1990, the Army actually redisignated the Spec4 rank to be just a plain Spec.<br>  <br>  Today, the difference is that a Corporal is in a TO&E leadership position -- like team leader.  The specialist is just in an enlisted position.  In many units, they will be doing supervising personnel, but the TO&E doesn't recognize it as a supervisory job.<br>  <br>  Corporal is a wierd rank these days.  Since the Army limits it to TO&E supervisory positions, and since the people eligible for those positions are  also usually considered 'better than average'.  You get a situation where the people that are about to make Sergeant are made a Corporal for a month or so.  Or to people that have some unusual reason that they can't be promoted to Sergeant.<br>  <br>  Either way, Corporal is generally unusual, but it is an NCO.  Specialist is all too common, and is not an NCO, but us usually expected to behave as if it were an NCO, with an eye toward future advancement.<br>  <br>  With promotion points at wartime lows, you will not see all that many Corporals -- they will usually make their points and get their E-5 pined on before they could get a lateral authorized.  The traditional exception is a Spec4(p) that hasn't been to PLDC and can't be promoted yet.  But I hear they are giving exceptions to that these days too.|`|hJNwAHccaa	Specialist and Corporal are both E-4.  If a SPC is sitting in a NCO slot or if the potential is shown that he/she has leadership qualities equal to that of a SGT, then a lateral appointment(not promotion) from SPC to CPL is given.  Most SPC(P) that I know are given lateral promotions to CPL because their points are so high and they've been working as a NCO for such a long time.  <br>  <br>  A CPL is to be given the same respect as any other NCO but most times that's not the case.  In some units, they are just like what someone else has already said...an underpaid SGT.  Most NCOs will abuse CPLs and make them do their work instead of treating them as equals, which really sucks.<br>  <br>  There are only two types of E-4...SPC and CPL...not 4.  The only other rank that uses the lateral appointment is Master Sergeant/First Sergeant.|`|K6zkGj7Zaa	In the Army a E-4 Corporal is a primarily a leadership position and used mostly in Combat Arms units (Infantry, Armor, Artillery, etc.).  You do not see it much used in Combat Service or Support units.<br>  A good example is that of a Squad Leader position (depending on the type of unit), might be normally held by an SGT/E-5, if there was not an SGT to fill that position, an E-4 Specialist would be chosen and given Corporal Stripes.  Yes, a Corporal is an NCO while a Specialist is not.  They are both E-4, but one is primarily in a leadership role and the other is not.<br>  The Specialist position was created early Vietnam era and at one time there were "Specialist" positions shadowing all the NCO ranks (Specialist 4, Specialist 5, 6,7,8, & 9?)  they were for technical positions not requiring leadership.  This was drooped slowly until the last Specialist rank, Specialist 4 or SP4, is now just Specialist.<br>  The old rank is getting collectible.  If you have seen today's Specialist rank, add an upside-down gold "rocker" or stripe and you have the Specialist 5, add two and you have Specialist 6 and so on.  It was quite confusing for the Army (not to mention other services) because it did not match up with the amount of stripe of the "regular" NCO rank.<br>  But that's a thing of the past.|`|n2oEhdZiaa	Paddy is correct except that a Corporal in the Army is an NCO, not a "mini-NCO".  Many young soldiers are confused because they hear Corporals are "Junior NCOs" and they think of it like Whopper vs a Junior Whopper.  They fail to realize Corporals, Sergeants, and Staff Sergeants are Jr NCOs while Sergeants First Class, Master/First Sergeants and Sergeants Major are all Sr. NCOs.|`|Q8GFvklUaa	specialist is not an NCO, a Corporal is an NCO<br>  <br>  it's basically saying "your good, and we are giving you some added responsibility before your eligible for advancement"<br>  <br>  Basically it's added stress.|`|aR1OiJ7Waa	In the Army  - A specialist is an overpaid private.  A corporal os an underpaid Sergeant.|`|yB7b4qQNaa	E-4's can either be a specialist or a corporal. The pay grade is the same, but a corporal has more responsibilities. A corporal could be considered an NCO or a mini NCO in that they have authority over specialists and privates.<br>  <br>  While one would make specialist just from having the proper time in grade/ in service, the high speed ones that have leadership potential are promoted to corporal by their command. I know it's different for the Marines, but one isn't an NCO until they're an E-5 (sergeant.)<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|1BUI7tcVaa	LOL ex marine here too, as of three weeks ago . the corporals i believe are combat troops and the specialists have a skill like medic(doc/corpsman), or something technical. oh yes ncos are not the back bone of the marine corps, its the pvt pfc and Lcpl that are that bone. they do all the work and put up with all the crap. without getting the job done the corps would be useless! well i hope i helped! have a nice day!
ZJ5SwhmNaa	Have you ever talked to your neighbor. If so bring her something hot to eat. You can talk and ask her what agency she uses as a friend wants to get a caretaker. When she shows you the card or paperwork call the office there and put in a anonymous complaint of the worker and let them know what is happening. You can also call the elder services and they will check up on her with a social worker.  I had a neighbor I was worried about and I took her food everyday.

teKeLxX2aa	Well, normally films attempt to portray good and evil in ambiguous terms that everyone can relate to no matter what. The evil actions of people in reality are usually fairly simplistic, but their interpretations and legitimacy will vary considerably based on the observer. <br>  <br>  Take for instance Bernie Madoff ripping off nearly 50 billion dollars (some of it being from non-profit organizations). Based on his actions and the fallout resulting from it, I would say he's perhaps the single most diabolical businessman the world has ever seen. There's no need for cheap villainous laughter or far-out master plans like in some James Bond movie. His actions were truly evil. and his motivations (being mainly greed) are as common place as anything that exists in the world we live in. He must have known to some degree that what he was doing was highly immoral, but his harmful actions justified the means in his mind. <br>  <br>  Don't be too quick to categorize all right-wing conservatives as simplistic individuals who are only motivated by greed and deception, because there could be a handful out there who truly believe that they're doing the right thing for the American public (as all stereotypes can't possibly be 100% true). <br>  <br>  As it is though, corrupt politicians and greedy businessmen probably compromise or orchestrate most of what is wrong in the world today in some way or another. People are so quick to pass judgment on the low-life criminals in society who rob and steal, but their actions aren't even nickels and dimes compared to what white collar criminals do on a daily basis (but they usually aren't in the news unless the story becomes full-blown).|`|9DtJeAUKaa	When you can achieve proper Grammar & English, try asking again for genuine intelligent & logical answers.|`|BpcgaJd4aa	I guess if we had any intelligent and logical politicians in power we'd have something to be afraid of...|`|SPsYrJJEaa	I am glad you cleared that up for me i was trying all evening to figure it out so thanks.!!
e2tE6EI8aa	Japan was playin dirty...|`|E9XL5x3Paa	There is argument both for and against that the American government wanted Japan to attack.  I really don't know, and I doubt anyone ever will.<br>  <br>  <br>  But the American government did cut off Japan's oil supply to weaken it for the purpose of limiting their inroads into trading with other Asian countries; countries we wanted sole access to.<br>  <br>  That was the main reason for why we cut off their oil supply, and the major reason for the TIMING of their attack; it would probably have come much later or not at all if we had not cut off their oil supply.  Doesn't mean the American government WANTED the attack, but it was one of the reasons that it came and at that time.|`|nr96BgWfaa	no, that is not true.<br>  <br>  slap your friend for me.|`|0RvtrkYOaa	In a way, but remember it was a decades long friction between the US and Japan.  The embargo of oil happened because of Japan's war against China.  The reason are too many and varied to really discuss here.  One good thing to read about is the US military war plans (operation Orange) which will give you a lot more information about US intelligence and what they thought about the Japanese.  Also another good source is letters from Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto will give you a good idea of the Japanese position as well.<br>  <br>  A complex answer which really a person saying oil was the biggest part never really understood the realations between the two countries.|`|84059953db605b032d680002df0b2a4faa	The U.S. wasn't happy with Japan invading China and the ensuing atrocities they committed, but they also found out that Japan was planning on attacking SE Asia, which could have included the U.S. territories of The Philippines and Guam.  To make an invasion immensely difficult for them, they cut off their oil supplies.|`|SkWzsnuxaa	There is some truth to the fact that Japan feared a loss of access to raw materials, not just oil and this did contribute to their attack on America. But America was more worried about the war in Europe than the Pacific at the time.|`|EzsnkxgVaa	We interfered with their supply. Most historians agree we provoked them, but were not expecting a full blown military response, but rather an Incident that we could exploit.<br>  <br>  We were already supplying China with planes and pilots (Bah Bah Black Sheep) and were looking to butt in on our own terms.<br>  <br>  [In 1940, Japan occupied French Indochina (Vietnam) upon agreement with the French Vichy government, and joined the Axis powers Germany and Italy. These actions intensified Japan's conflict with the United States and Great Britain which reacted with an oil boycott. The resulting oil shortage and failures to solve the conflict diplomatically made Japan decide to capture the oil rich Dutch East Indies (Indonesia) and to start a war with the US and Great Britain.]<br>  <br>  They fooled us.|`|9Vs6IgYUaa	Partially...  Japan had been blockaded by the US for several months prior to the attacks.   <br>  <br>  The US has not been attacked by any nation unprovoked since 1812.  All the wars we have been in have been optional & voluntary, and many of them, to some degree, as a result of blowback from our own policies.<br>  <br>  There is also good evidence that they knew the attack was coming..  not necessarily Peral Harbor, but somewhere.<br>  <br>  Our government & schools revised history & lied to us?

NMaCcyeKaa	No one forced banks to make loans to high risk groups.  Banks did so willingly because home values were so high the banks thought they could still make a profit even if they had to foreclose.  They lost a lot of money when the housing market collapsed.<br>  <br>  I blame the free market because the owners of business were doing anything to increase their profit margins, including short-changing and laying off their employees.  They didn't realize they were impoverishing their own consumer bases.  Businesses lost money because people couldn't afford their products anymore.  Consumers had to go into debt via mortgages, car loans, and credit cards to make their purchases, and all that debt finally caught up to us.<br>  <br>  Edit:  I did.  The Act specifically states it would not force banks to make loans at unreasonably high risk.  The act includes the phrase, "consistent with safe and sound operations."|`|tvNkizDraa	There are a couple of things that come to mind when I hear the term "free market"...<br>  <br>  1. When the Community Reinvestment Act (1977), there were some protections in place as well against predatory lending practices. The Community Reinvestment Act has been around for about thirty years, so why the problem now?  Deregulation.  The banks used predatory lending practices to make loans that they KNEW were high risk.  So they made the loans, bundled them and resold them to strip off their fees and pass on the risks.<br>  -- Transcript: Help for the Homeowners?

sgEloO1Jaa	Emperor penguins are the largest of all the penguins. They stand almost 4 ft. (1.2 meters) tall and weigh 70 to 90 lbs. (30 to 40 kg.). They live and breed at the beginning of winter, on the fast ice all around the Antarctic continent. The total population is estimated to be about 200,000 breeding pairs. Emperor penguins can mate when they are 4 years old and can live to be 20 years of age.<br>  <br>  Emperors live in the coldest climate on earth. Temperatures can drop as low as -140 degrees Fahrenheit (-60 degrees Celsius) on the Antarctic ice. After mating, the female lays one large egg. The egg is then immediately rolled to the top of the male's feet. The egg is then incubated or kept warm on the male's feet by a thick fold of skin that hangs from the belly of the male. The males manage to survive by standing huddled in groups for up to 9 weeks. During this time the female returns to the open sea to feed. During the time the male incubates the egg, he may lose about half his body weight because he does not eat. <br>  <br>  When the egg hatches the female returns to care for the chick. Once the female returns, the male will go to the open sea to feed. The male will return in a few weeks and both male and female will tend to the chick by keeping it warm and feeding it food from their stomachs. After 7 weeks of care, the chicks form groups called "cr?ches" and huddle together for protection and warmth. They are still fed by the parents. The chicks know their parents by the sound of their call. The chicks are fully grown in 6 months, which is the beginning of the summer season in the Antarctic. At this time all the penguins return to the open sea. <br>  <br>  The shape of their body helps them to survive. They have short wings that help them to dive up to 900 feet to catch larger fish. They can swim 10-15 kilometers an hour which lets them escape their main enemy, the leopard seal. They can stay warm because they have a thick layer of down under the outer feathers and a layer of blubber. The layer of downy feathers trap air that keeps the body heat in and cold air and water out. They also have large amounts of body oil that aids in keeping them dry in the water. <br>  <br>  Emperor penguins have the upright and regal bearing that their name suggests. They take the dinner-jacketed formality of all penguins to its highest level and though they are able to be as awkward, gawky and get as dirty as other penguins, when they shake it all off and stand up to regain their dignity, there are few if any more stately and elegant animals on earth.<br>  <br>  Emperor penguins are the largest of penguin species with an average weight of around 30kg (66lb, but can be up to 40kg (88lb)) and a height of approx. 1.15m (3.8ft).<br>  <br>  They have colourful feathers around their necks and heads, though are not quite as bright as king penguins which are almost as large. There is little or no possibility of confusing the two species however as their distribution around Antarctica is very different. While king penguins are a sub-Antarctic species, being based on islands dotted around the continent, emperor penguins are animals of the deep south.<br>  <br>  Emperor penguins have yellow ear patches that are "open" fading into the white of the breast feathers, whereas king penguins have orange ear patches that are "closed" by a band of black feathers. Emperor penguin chicks have distinctive plumage with a large white face patch.<br>  <br>  All but 2 of about 40 known emperor penguin colonies are on winter fast ice that is frozen solid and attached to the land from autumn until it begins to break up in the spring (though some years it doesn't break up at all). They are found all around the coasts of the Antarctic continent. They breed during the depths of the Antarctic winter and in some of the most desolate, coldest, windiest and downright grim places on the planet during the season of 24 hour darkness. Some emperor penguins are therefore the only birds that never set foot on land. They were completely unknown until the first sighting in 1902 by Lt. Reginald Skelton on Scott's 1901-04 Discovery Expedition and new colonies were still being discovered as late as 1986.<br>  <br>  Early in the 20th century, Emperor penguins were thought to be some kind of evolutionary "missing link", something that scientists thought could be proven by observing the growth of the embryo at various stages. On Scott's 1910-1913 Terra Nova expedition a small group of expeditioners set out on a winter sledging journey led by Wilson, the biologist and including the young Apsley Cherry-Garrard, famously this gave rise to the acknowledged greatest of all Antarctic adventure and travel books "The Worst Journey in the World".<br>  <br>  Emperor penguins feed on fish, krill and squid which they catch on dives that are longer and deeper than any other penguin or bird species. They can dive to a depth of 1,800 feet (550 meters) and hold their breath for up to 22 minutes. This allows them to reach and exploit food resources that other birds|`|dVQdswtTaa	That's a brilliant solution to a complex problem.

So, "The American Dream" is really an American delusion. We actually do have quite a rigid class system.<br>  <br>  AgCrew08: "A man should never have to argue why he should be able to keep what is his."<br>  <br>  Yeah, the problem with that is the money is only "his" because he's the boss and he says so. Hypothetically speaking, a member of the owning class could pay his employees exactly the same amount that HE gets; or, if there were no government regulation, he could pay them a penny an hour. Of course, no rich person would ever pay his employees the same as he, because of the whole greed thing. And that's Jamie's point (which you've yet to sufficiently address); rich people are too greedy, and the government should put a stop to it. No one's trying to say that the government should make all wages equal, just saying that the playing field shouldn't be so severely tilted.<br>  <br>  Appeal to Heaven:<br>  <br>  Coveting or Envying rich people would be to want all the excess luxury they possess for yourself. I don't think that's what he's saying. I always thought it was funny, anyway, that the Christian God is a "jealous God" according to scripture, yet it's a sin for us to follow God's example in that respect. Not to mention, Jamie already said he's not that religious, which means he may not follow ALL the rules, despite that he may agree with some. Envy could be completely okay in his book; just greed that's unethical.<br>  <br>  mgunnycappo:<br>  <br>  If one group of rich people move away, another group will, by necessity, come up from the lower class to take their place. However, if republicans are really as patriotic as they claim to be, moving to a different country wouldn't be an option.<br>  <br>  What's great is that all can be regulated. I think the government should rework our tax system so that an employer cannot make more than a certain (healthy) percentage above the annual income of their lowest paid employee; anything above that percentage mark would be taxed away, be it that fiscal year or the next. This would solve the problem of them raising prices to cheat the system. Also, since there would be no incentive for rich people to even attempt to go above that percentage mark, as they are aware that they're not getting the money anyhow, there would be a less skewed tax contribution across classes--the rich wouldn't be carrying such a heavy tax burden in relation to the working class. It's not about hurting the rich people, it's about valuing labor and recognizing that laborers are just as vital to this country as their employers.<br>  <br>  Justin H:<br>  <br>  Your testimony and testimonies like yours are the reason why a country that promises opportunity can get away with 80% of people dying in the same class as they were born in. The people involved in devising this system were geniuses. There's just enough social mobility that we can point to cases like yours and say "Hey the system works, look at that guy." The problem with saying stuff like, "I say they should work as hard as I have" is that if everyone accomplished what you have, who would work the drive-thru at McDonald's? We can't all be members of the owning class because, as business owners, there'd be no one left for us to employ. As I said to mgunnycappo, it's time we recognized that both employee and employer are equally vital to our system.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Oh, and Justin, I gave you the second thumbs down.

Lawmakers who seem more interested in pleasing special interests than voters back home now control Congress. Some of the leading voices in crafting the massive bank bailout and stimulus packages — including Sen. Chris Dodd, Rep. Barney Frank and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi — were the very ones who helped get us in this mess.<br>  <br>  They did so by loosening Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's lending rules and pushing commercial banks to make bad loans. Both Dodd and Frank were recipients of hefty donations from Fannie, Freddie and other financial firms they were charged with regulating.<br>  <br>  ? Trade protectionism passes as policy, even amid the administration's lip service to free trade. Congress' vast stimulus bill and its "Buy American" provisions limit spending to U.S.-made products and will drive up costs, limit choices and alienate key allies.<br>  <br>  Already, it has triggered rumblings of retaliation in a 1930s-style trade war from trading partners, just as the Smoot-Hawley tariffs prolonged the Great Depression. Several European partners have begun raising barriers. Meanwhile, three signed free-trade pacts with Colombia, Panama and Korea languish with no chance of passage. Free trade offers one way out of our problems, yet it's been sidetracked.<br>  <br>  ? A 1,000-plus page stimulus bill is bulled through Congress with no GOP input and not a single member of Congress reading it before passage. It borders on censorship.<br>  <br>  GOP protests of the bill's spending and the speed it was passed at were dismissed by Obama and other Democrats as seeking to "do nothing" or "breaking the spirit of bipartisanship." But voters are angry.<br>  <br>  Along with thousands of angry phone calls to Congress, new Facebook groups have emerged, and street protests have sprung up in Denver, Seattle and Mesa, Ariz., against the "porkulus." CNBC Chicago reporter Rick Santelli's on-air denunciation of federal bailouts for mortgage deadbeats attracted a record 1.5 million Internet hits.<br>  <br>  ? Business leaders are demonized. Yes, there are bad eggs out there like the Madoffs and Stanfords. But most CEOs are hugely talented, driven, highly intelligent people who make our corporations the most productive in the world and add trillions of dollars of value to our economy.<br>  <br>  They don't deserve to be dragged before Congress, as they have been dozens of times in the past two years, for a ritual heaping of verbal abuse from the very people most responsible for our ills — our tragically inept, Democrat-led Congress.<br>  <br>  ? Words like "catastrophe," "crisis" and "depression" are coming from the mouth of the newly elected president, rather than words of hope and optimism. Instead of talking up America's capabilities and prospects, he talks them down — the exact opposite of our most successful recent president, Ronald Reagan, who came in vowing to restore that "shining city on a hill." <br>  <br>  Even ex-President Clinton admonished Obama to return to his previous optimism, saying he would "just like him to end by saying that he is hopeful and completely convinced we're gonna c|`|E9XL5x3Paa	Well initially it will only provide work, not jobs.  Republicans are right on that point, INITIALLY.<br>  <br>  But that work provides certain things.  More roads provides businesses with the ability to find more efficient routes to ship their products to stores, saving them greatly on gas and oil.  Repaired roads also means that businesses will save on repair costs for shipping fleets who are no longer destroying their trucks when they hit potholes.<br>  <br>  More Internet access provides for better worker-to-worker, worker-to-business, business-to-worker, and business-to-business communication; which should mean for more efficiency and greater productivity.  It also provides businesses with a new pathway for sales by opening online sales to people who previously had no access.  <br>  <br>  Better education is a longterm help, as it prepares the next generations for the jobs of the future; providing them with the knowledge they will need to create new and innovative technologies.<br>  <br>  And while that work is not a permanent job, those guys who do it do get paid.  That means they have money to buy things they need; and the only stores available for them to buy from here are American stores.  Stores owned by American businessmen and staffed by American workers.  Then those workers in more permanent jobs get paid, and then they can go out and buy more.<br>  <br>  And that means higher profits for businesses; which they can then, in turn, use to attract investors.  Then the investors invest money that allow businesses to create more products and hire more workers to build those products.  That means even more sales as those employees then become the new consumers and buy even more, increasing even more profits, thereby increasing more investment.<br>  <br>  Then it just goes on from there.|`|84059953db605b032d680002df0b2a4faa	Well, for one we get the benefit of a good laugh as cons run around screaming, "the sky is falling!"|`|BpcgaJd4aa	Oh I can!<br>  <br>  "It's going to help America we're not sure how, but Obama said it would"
WYa3UY6Gaa	No<br>  <br>  Being Bi-Polar does not inhibit you from working. Sorry<br>  <br>  To an answer below.<br>  <br>  <br>  My aunt has severe Bi-Polar disease. She had many symptoms you described. <br>  <br>  BUT all of those symptoms are controlled with medication. Being Bi-Polar DOES not inhibit you from working. You can get a job not working around money. You can find a job to meet your needs. Unlike the people that truly need the money. My aunt took her med's, and she worked ..still works her butt off. <br>  <br>  People who actually have a serious health condition that keep them from working.<br>  <br>  I don't mock people with mental health issues. I just don't think its an excuse.<br>  <br>  _____________________________<br>  <br>  I do understand that sometimes getting medication to the correct dosages for a person can be a hard, and long process. It's just probably that I grew up, and am still around so many people with mental health issues. <br>  <br>  Like my nephrologists has severe turret's, but he is the top doctor in that hospital. He finds ways/people to help him cope. My best friend is Bi-Polar. Shes a manager at Macy's. Her mother is Bi-Polar, and owns her own restaurant. I mean the list goes on, and on and they have always pounded into my head that its no excuse you can always work around it. So maybe that's why I believe it's no excuse.

"the blue ink?? or the black ink?" could cause somebody to spiral into a suicidal phase.<br>  <br>  there are many many other symptoms that can accompany bi-polar that make it difficult in a work place but my daughter is running around like a twit and i don't have time to write an essay.<br>  <br>  i do want to stress that the severity of the bipolar that would trigger those kind of symptoms are  not common and generally go hand in hand with an anxiety disorder, PTSD or a history of other mental health related issues.<br>  <br>  it is very easy for some to mock those with mental health issues because they ave no understanding personally of the effects on somebodies life and i feel sorry for those people who are so narrow minded.<br>  <br>  RE: the first poster:<br>  I understand what you are saying but there are many cases of it taking several years to find the right balance of meds to suit the individual.  I know of one specific case where the only way the girl is capable of functioning in a "normal" sense is to be on one specific type of meds and the dosage of which is nearly 5 times higher than what the recommended dosage should be. She's the case I was thinking of when i answered that yes in Australia it has been known to happen. she was on a disability support pension for nearly 5 years until they got her dosage correct. in those 5 years she tried several times to get a job and each time within 3 monthhs or so she'd end up back in hospital unable to cope.<br>  <br>  ALL mental health disorders can be handled with the right combinations of therapy and medication..

My mother was at the store with us all and I guess we were acting out a bit, must have been sleepily or some thing because in was not normal for us.  But my mother saw a child's hand go to touch something on the shelves and she smacked the child's hand and said, "I told you for the last time not to touch anything."  As she turned to the child to look at it, she found that it was not her child.  <br>  <br>  Lucky, the other mother was laughing and telling the child that was what happens when you don't do what you are told.

1KGXts5Daa	As of January 2008, there were nearly 3 million people incarcerated by the US prison system.  This is NOT including people held in county jails throughout the US.<br>  <br>  The United States has the highest amount of prisoners per capita (number of people incarcerated of overall population) of any country in the world (715 incarcerated per 100,000 people).

3FoU68xuaa	I would first and foremost eliminate the electoral college completely! it still pisses me off immensely to this day that that has yet to be done away with! It is no longer needed and hasn't been for decades! I also agree that registration shouldn't be required because i think that only contributes to making less people vote than would if registration weren't required...sure it may only be out of peoples' laziness to go register, but regardless of the reason, i do think more people would vote if it weren't required!! I think that they should revise the entire constitution actually, because it's not nearly modern enough and let's face it- life and it's problems are not nearly the same as they were hundreds of years ago! Get with it, people!|`|teKeLxX2aa	I am not one to fully agree with the electoral system as it exists today, but those rules were put into place over 200 years ago for some very important reasons. Any serious reforms made to our nations voting system are constantly being reworked and submitted by college graduates and experienced political scientist who know a thing or two about politics in the best interest of the people. It isn't that I don't value the opinion of every American, regardless of whether or not he/she lives in a trailer park and whose only political literacy is derived from cable television. But there is good reason why people like that don't have a say in the way our nations government is run or how officials become elected to public office. <br>  <br>  Understandably, the roots of the electoral college can be traced far back. It stems from something our forefathers knew full well of at the time, having just experienced a revolution and having the new colonists calling for George Washington to be their new King (which he adamantly denied, but accepted the notion of serving two four-year terms later one). <br>  <br>  I try to answer every Yahoo Question as fully and thoughtfully as possible, so if you care to learn a thing or two about why the electoral college stands from the viewpoint of our forefathers 200 years ago, please read the Federalist Paper No. 10 by James Madison. James Madison was our country's fourth President, and has been widely cited by historians as being among the most intelligent of the founding fathers. His Paper No. 10 discusses the issues involving factions. His main arguments gives creed to a bigger government in order to lessen the whims of a few people, because their smaller size would have greater influence on the actions of a democratic government, which they could control without much difficulty. His well articulated argument was one of the main reasons why our federal government was formed in the first place, or rather, the reason why we're the United States of America and not the Confederate States of America.  <br>  <br>  He also discusses how "undesirable passions can quickly spread to a majority of the people." When taking into consideration how easily a majority of Americans can be coerced and manipulated by the media, its a good thing there are precautions in place to avoid mass amounts of uninformed and misled people from making extremely bad decisions (as was the case of a Democratic Germany electing Hitler and the Nazi's into power in the 30's).<br>  <br>  So as you can see, there were reasons behind the rules put in place over two centuries ago. It would be hard to argue that without our forefathers incredible wisdom and ungodly foresight, our nation wouldn't of experienced a bout similar to the Nazi's during some of its most turbulent times.|`|aR1OiJ7Waa	New Bill of Rights<br>  <br>  1.

Here's a little reminder to you numbers crunchers....Obama has only been in office for one (1 ) month! It comes as no surprise that his approval numbers are a little less then he started with, but if I were going to run interference for Barack, I wouldn't try to shoot down the oppositions darts with that approval rating launcher. It's brand new, and it's bound to wear out quickly from over use.<br>  We'll see how that weapon works in about 12 months ( by the way, if you want to test it on a consistently stable approval rating, Sarah's your gal. You all can bad mouth her until you swallow you own tails for all I care, but the numbers don't lie. Just a little fruit for thought. How do you like them apples?<br>  <br>  Griggnax, that list of offenses would be impressively scary if GW were in fact the first one to implement such sinister tactics. What were they thinking? Oh yeah, I remember. Alls fair in love and war. I'm not trying to make light or be flippant, but there are many ruthless perps out there we could pin that list to as a description of their theoligy and resume.And as for the wmd's over in iraq, there are families in eastern iraq who buried loved ones due to the chemical attacks by saddam. His reason for the attacks was to test the ordinance for percision, range, and killing power.And our government, as well as many other leaders knew of the attacks, and the wmd's. I'm not GW's defense attorney or even an advocate for his place in history. I'm only saying that everyone wants to give our leaders too much credit for engineering covert operations when, in fact, we pick politicians who always get caught with their hands in the cookie jar. I wouldn't want any of them to set the foundation on any assignment I was on. But,our leaders surround themselves with the valuable and the expendable to compensate for collateral damages and damage control. And there are some real beasties out there.

teKeLxX2aa	Those were just slogans used to hook politically gullible and persuadable people at the time. And as it showed, you can win massive amounts of supports by using emotionally charged words over, and over again. Despite losing, look at how much support McCain and Palin got for saying "Maverick!" over, and over, and over again. <br>  <br>  The Change has certainly come, but the Hope has weened (as was to be expected by any realist). Anything short of a miracle by Jesus himself, our country is going to take years or even decades to recover from its current predicament. However, narrow minded individuals or political scumbag correspondents will use the current state of the economy as an excuse to blame the current leaders in government. <br>  <br>  Understand however, that the Sh!t only really hit the fan (in the media) after Obama assumed power. Despite the accumulation of trillions of dollars of debt during the entire Bush administration, the media took little if any notice, so it was not high on the public radar until recently. People should have gotten mad when we were 7 trillion dollars in debt, but that didn't happen. Notice that even the 700 billion dollar bailout under the Bush administration didn't face nearly the same amount of scrutiny, and none of that money went to help the middle class (it was to appease the banks to continue giving out loans). We got to where we are today over an eight year period through mass negligence, if people cannot realize where the blame lies there is little hope for them (regardless of political affiliations). Our recovery will be long and hard from where we are now, as Obama did explicitly mentioned in his acceptance speech. But by giving up all hope so early, your only throwing in the towel during the first round. <br>  <br>  Most people tend to think because things aren't getting noticeably better instantaneously, that things aren't moving in the right direction at all. However, questioners of the War's success following Mission Accomplished were few and far between, at a cost of 15 billion dollars a month and countless casualties. It all just goes to show how easily persuadable and emotionally manipulated the average person can be through various mediums (television, radio, internet, etc.)<br>  <br>  As history as shown, you should never follow the media and you should always view the current government with skepticism. But despite how your views on the government may be, you still have to do the best with what you have. As the right wing objected to war protesters in 2003, economic complainers today shouldn't think that their anger is going to be productive in anyway whatsoever.|`|cO9lH8f6aa	Now they have no hope of any change, it only going to get worse.|`|J81tP8k2aa	Well, how are you going about it.

f5058943507feef30be15c90091dab2eaa	First off, the new studies show, it causes plaques similar to alzheimer, which is why Marijuana users tend to have memory losses.   New studies from Lancet  that there is strong correlations of Marijuana use and psychological disorders.  There is an arguement though that people with psychological disorder tend to  smoke pot.    Most scientist in the field believe that it probably trigger problems fromthose who are predisposed.   THe medical benefits seem limited.   First off Marijuana is biological and the amount of active agent would vary each time one uses it.   Also the problems from it can be far worse then the benefits.   Marijuana like cigarettes is smoked.   Other people would inhale as well as the user.   I have gotten very sick because someone was smoking outside and I was indoors in a closed room.|`|4f9e57dbf0fa6fc41e6fe3e1397aa468aa	For the same reason why ANYTHING is illegal...the majority of voters want it that way.  Things in the United States become illegal because the representatives that we vote for pass laws making things illegal.  If the majority of voters wanted marijuana to be legal, representatives would be elected who would legalize it.  If you need more information as to how this works, read about prohibition in the 1930s.|`|ZZtQ2btIaa	Out here in Los Angeles, it is legal.  I actually have a  medical marijuana card.  But it's only considered legal in the state not by the federal government.  So alot of the dispensaries out here are being raided by the feds.  It's really sad because marijuana helps so many people in so many different ways as you listed.  But anything you misuse or abuse is going to have consequences.  I have no problems with the "God Plant" as long as it's used in moderation and it doesn't affect your daily life.|`|15fafbb5314da7937a58fa36d4ece8fbaa	I dont use or condone drugs, but I see your point and share your opinion.

Now it is enshrined into society. They used to run propaganda adds that it made white women have sex with Mexican and black men.<br>  <br>  These days we have a police state culture. If it were to be legalized then many police would likely be out of a job.<br>  <br>  It is a proven fact that prohibition increases overall crime rates. If it were legalized then there would be a lot less crime and a lot less need for the services of the prison industrial complex.

Without the holding facility at Guantanamo Bay military officials can simply hold interrogations in what ever country the terrorists are captured in. They could also just quietly shoot some of the more serious terrorist combatants.  Military officials have a pretty good idea of who they are dealing with. <br>  <br>  Finally if the terrorists don't go by the rules of the Geneva Convention why should we? Barbaric yes but then again war isn't exactly all fun and games.|`|NMaCcyeKaa	I don't trust the word of the Pentagon.

5mCm2XTLaa	Marijuana used to be legal up until 1937 when the feds outlawed it. The reasons were largely political. Despite what people like Harry J. Anslinger and William Randolph Hurst said pot smoking caused no real harm to society. <br>  <br>  Marijuana should be taxed and regulated just like alcohol and tobacco. What I'd like to see is for the government to issue special licenses to growers who will produce the stuff and distribute it similar to the way tobacco products and alcoholic beverages are now. <br>  <br>  Marijuana has been legal in the Netherlands for years. An adult can possess up to 5 grams for personal use. Dutch pot smokers can only legally obtain cannabis through government licensed dealers, the penalty for "bootlegging" cannabis is 20 years in prison.|`|xnBbmCkCaa	That's funny, because 99% of my friends smoke marijuana, it almost seems like it is legalized to me.

If it were legal, not only could people form corporations to sell it, but taxes could be collected on it, a lot of people would get out of jail, and no one who wants to smoke it will be forced to associate with people who sold harder drugs.  Not gonna happen, though.  The alcohol lobby is too powerful and they know how much business they would lose if grass became legal.|`|6a29fa9432cd11f6628b8d1ef1265ca6aa	I would make it legal to grow it for person use, but selling it would still be illegal.

I've smoked weed and i'll tell you something, it's not really that big of a deal. Also, think about this. I'm 19 and it's a hell of a lot easier for me to get weed than it is for me to get beer. Plus, whens the last time you heard of a high driving accident? Alcohol is a true problem and marijuana possession shouldn't be considered criminal.|`|7XSMjgroaa	We would still be in the same predicament with it that we are now.

Sometimes, we have to take the good with the bad. Other times, we have to keep out the good in order to keep out the bad. In this case, I think the second option makes more sense.<br>  <br>  We should kick out the illegal 'aliens.' Don't give them rights by referring to them as immigrants. I am an immigrant. My family members are immigrants. Illegal aliens should be deported...and they really should have no rights.<br>  <br>  Rights should be available to those who actually respect this country.

9Vs6IgYUaa	There is a great decider of what jobs should pay..  it's called the free market.  If there are few that have the skills to & are willing to do a job that has a great deal of value, the job will pay a great deal, such as industrial oil rig deep divers that can make $1500 a day for the risks they take & the skills they bring to the table.  If a job takes little skill and has many people that are willing to do it (welcome to wal-mart!?) then it won't pay diddly.  There is no reason for an employer to pay more than the market rate for labor, anymore than you would pay a dime more for a gallon of gas than the place across the street is charging.   It's supply & demand.   If an employer chooses to pay more, than it's their business.  It's none of anyone else's to dictate the rates.<br>  <br>  Think you're worth more than you are making?   This is America, land of the free...  quit your job & find someone that will pay you what you believe you are worth.  If you don't?

You can choose to be forced into a dictatorship, a socialist government, a communist government, or a democratic government. There is no such thing as absolute freedom because government is required to provide education, SECURITY, transportation, etc. So you can choose to have more choice or be forced to do what other people say. <br>  <br>  So basically my answer is no I do not believe it is hypocritical because the concept behind democracy is attempting to give the people the most choice possible while providing the necessary services a government is charged with doing.|`|5c99d5b60a8c84c9aa2ce28b8d1e9e56aa	Your question first.  Iraq was a Dictatorship, now with some more progress it will become a Democracy.  Would you rather live in a place that because of your religious beliefs you live in fear everyday from getting gassed and killed like they did to your relatives back in the late '80s and early '90s?  Or would you rather go to church, mosque, synagogue, field, whatever without having to look over your shoulder?  <br>  <br>  Shame on us for eliminating a Genocidal Dictator.  Shame on us.  <br>  <br>  Oh and for the person that answered your question first, you're an idiot sheep.  Go down to the corner store and buy yourself some common sense and a slim jim.  The media has forgotten about the war because Bush is out of office and they don't want to do any damage to Obama.  Because regardless of whether he started the war or not he is the President now and is responsible for what happens and the media doesn't want to talk badly about the war because that would make Obama look bad and then his approval ratings would sink.|`|742e4c8b4668a0ad6462b4a0210ce82aaa	Like it or not, the Bush Administration left us in a sticky situation in Iraq.  It's not going to be an easy exit no matter what anyone thought.  Democracy is probably not going to be an easy answer for Iraq because they have opposing groups who don't just argue, they kill each other.  That's the way it's been for thousands of years.  It's all they know.  For the Iraqi people to forge a democracy, it would take alot of compromise and hundreds of years to change attitudes.

There are almost forty species of dolphin in seventeen genera. They vary in size from 1.2 m (4 ft) and 40 kg (90 lb) (Maui's Dolphin), up to 9.5 m (30 ft) and 10 tonnes (9.8 LT; 11 ST) (the Orca or Killer Whale). They are found worldwide, mostly in the shallower seas of the continental shelves, and are carnivores, mostly eating fish and squid. The family Delphinidae is the largest in the Cetacea, and relatively recent: dolphins evolved about ten million years ago, during the Miocene. Dolphins are considered to be amongst the most intelligent of animals and their often friendly appearance and seemingly playful attitude have made them popular in human culture.<br>  <br>  Various methods of feeding exist, not just between species but also within a species. Various methods may be employed, some techniques being used by only a single dolphin population. Fish and squid are the main source of food for most dolphin species, but the False Killer Whale and the Killer Whale also feed on other marine mammals.<br>  <br>  One feeding method employed by many species is herding, where a pod will control a school of fish while individual members take turns plowing through the school, feeding. The tightly packed school of fish is commonly known as a bait ball. Coralling is a method where fish are chased to shallow water where they are more easily captured. In South Carolina, the Atlantic Bottlenose Dolphin takes this one step further with what has become known as strand feeding, where the fish are driven onto mud banks and retrieved from there.[25] In some places, Orcas will also come up to the beach to capture sea lions. Some species also whack fish with their fluke, stunning them and sometimes sending fish clear out of the water.<br>  <br>  Reports of cooperative human-dolphin fisheries date back to the ancient Roman author and natural philosopher Pliny the Elder.[26] A modern human-dolphin fishery still takes place in Laguna, Santa Catarina, Brazil. Here, dolphins drive fish towards fishermen waiting along the shore and give them a signal when they can cast their nets. The dolphins then feed off the fish that manage to escape the nets.|`|5f52c5c3d1d0deab80192fb888e39e9aaa	I'm not saying we're saints for going in there, but keep the following in mind: under Hussein, there was so much government control that the people had very little chance of rising up and establishing a democracy.  People can't make their own decisions under the rule of a dictator.  <br>  <br>  I think we went into Iraq for strategic reasons, not to free them from Husein.

Vvgnw0iuaa	I think it was a bitter election on both sides.<br>  In the last few elections it seems the candidates were moderately liberal and moderately conservative on alot of their issues<br>  but this time Obama was definitely an outspoken liberal and McCain, although still a moderate conservative, was still on the opposite spectrum from Obama.<br>  <br>  People on both sides took things to a whole new level of anger and bitterness.<br>  I mean honestly this wasn't just another presidential election, the candidates were very different in their stance on the issues and the people who supported them were as well.<br>  <br>  I know as a McCain supporter I saw Obama as a socialist who stood for things that  opposed our Constituion(and I still do)<br>  And I think Democrats and Liberals saw McCain as another Bush and they didnt want that again.<br>  <br>  I know in school in our gov't class things would get heated. I live in a county that voted 60% McCain and in our class we would get into some of the nastiest arguments between the Obama and McCain supporters.<br>  Thats kind of  what this whole thing reminded me of.<br>  Our country has become very idealistic on both sides of the political spectrum and that resulted in nasty insults thrown both ways.<br>  <br>  Although I dont approve of Obama, I still think its sad our country is so divided.<br>  As the quote goes:<br>  United We Stand<br>  Divided We Fall|`|Rlm7VjeEaa	It was because Obama was the first black man to actually stand a chance so there was a lot of mud slinging to try to knock him down.

But looking back at how Abe Lincoln kept the nation unified through the bloodiest war in American history, and how FDR managed to steer the nation during the depression and WWII, it would seem that our nation has relied heavily on intelligent and strong leaders during its darkest hours. <br>  <br>  Whether or not Obama will ever stand among the greats and return America to its former glory remains uncertain, and only time will tell.|`|3E6lf2cJaa	It was.<br>  <br>  Two very opposite parties running.

Unfortunately, our children are going to pay for our past mistakes with credit, interest rates, government systems that are broken and not fixed, greed, and the wars that we have had it in the past and current situation in the middle east.

mqXyDTwwaa	I agree with the penguin thing.|`|esOaJoqBaa	Penguin soup actually. Sometimes it needs fava beans. Try it with a nice Chianti.|`|ljmE8eLLaa	Soup.|`|sgEloO1Jaa	Emperor penguins are the largest of all the penguins. They stand almost 4 ft. (1.2 meters) tall and weigh 70 to 90 lbs. (30 to 40 kg.). They live and breed at the beginning of winter, on the fast ice all around the Antarctic continent. The total population is estimated to be about 200,000 breeding pairs. Emperor penguins can mate when they are 4 years old and can live to be 20 years of age.<br>  <br>  Emperors live in the coldest climate on earth. Temperatures can drop as low as -140 degrees Fahrenheit (-60 degrees Celsius) on the Antarctic ice. After mating, the female lays one large egg. The egg is then immediately rolled to the top of the male's feet. The egg is then incubated or kept warm on the male's feet by a thick fold of skin that hangs from the belly of the male. The males manage to survive by standing huddled in groups for up to 9 weeks. During this time the female returns to the open sea to feed. During the time the male incubates the egg, he may lose about half his body weight because he does not eat. <br>  <br>  When the egg hatches the female returns to care for the chick. Once the female returns, the male will go to the open sea to feed. The male will return in a few weeks and both male and female will tend to the chick by keeping it warm and feeding it food from their stomachs. After 7 weeks of care, the chicks form groups called "cr?ches" and huddle together for protection and warmth. They are still fed by the parents. The chicks know their parents by the sound of their call. The chicks are fully grown in 6 months, which is the beginning of the summer season in the Antarctic. At this time all the penguins return to the open sea. <br>  <br>  The shape of their body helps them to survive. They have short wings that help them to dive up to 900 feet to catch larger fish. They can swim 10-15 kilometers an hour which lets them escape their main enemy, the leopard seal. They can stay warm because they have a thick layer of down under the outer feathers and a layer of blubber. The layer of downy feathers trap air that keeps the body heat in and cold air and water out. They also have large amounts of body oil that aids in keeping them dry in the water. <br>  <br>  Emperor penguins have the upright and regal bearing that their name suggests. They take the dinner-jacketed formality of all penguins to its highest level and though they are able to be as awkward, gawky and get as dirty as other penguins, when they shake it all off and stand up to regain their dignity, there are few if any more stately and elegant animals on earth.<br>  <br>  Emperor penguins are the largest of penguin species with an average weight of around 30kg (66lb, but can be up to 40kg (88lb)) and a height of approx. 1.15m (3.8ft).<br>  <br>  They have colourful feathers around their necks and heads, though are not quite as bright as king penguins which are almost as large. There is little or no possibility of confusing the two species however as their distribution around Antarctica is very different. While king penguins are a sub-Antarctic species, being based on islands dotted around the continent, emperor penguins are animals of the deep south.<br>  <br>  Emperor penguins have yellow ear patches that are "open" fading into the white of the breast feathers, whereas king penguins have orange ear patches that are "closed" by a band of black feathers. Emperor penguin chicks have distinctive plumage with a large white face patch.<br>  <br>  All but 2 of about 40 known emperor penguin colonies are on winter fast ice that is frozen solid and attached to the land from autumn until it begins to break up in the spring (though some years it doesn't break up at all). They are found all around the coasts of the Antarctic continent. They breed during the depths of the Antarctic winter and in some of the most desolate, coldest, windiest and downright grim places on the planet during the season of 24 hour darkness. Some emperor penguins are therefore the only birds that never set foot on land. They were completely unknown until the first sighting in 1902 by Lt. Reginald Skelton on Scott's 1901-04 Discovery Expedition and new colonies were still being discovered as late as 1986.<br>  <br>  Early in the 20th century, Emperor penguins were thought to be some kind of evolutionary "missing link", something that scientists thought could be proven by observing the growth of the embryo at various stages. On Scott's 1910-1913 Terra Nova expedition a small group of expeditioners set out on a winter sledging journey led by Wilson, the biologist and including the young Apsley Cherry-Garrard, famously this gave rise to the acknowledged greatest of all Antarctic adventure and travel books "The Worst Journey in the World".<br>  <br>  Emperor penguins feed on fish, krill and squid which they catch on dives that are longer and deeper than any other penguin or bird species. They can dive to a depth of 1,800 feet (550 meters) and hold their breath for up to 22 minutes. This allows them to reach and exploit food resources that other birds

It doesn't really make you feel better for longer than a minute.  The only one I could give a definite immoral to is capital punishment.  And making drugs legal is not a moral issue.  It is a matter of the consequences of keeping it illegal, which are far more monumental than legalizing it.

I was part of it. Soldiers who lived in the Barracks (ie Single Soldiers) had the same rights as married soldiers when it came to their living conditions. That meant they could have different sheets and bedding, no more "Dress Right Dress" Must give notice before room inspection... etc... The Same Rights of living as people in Housing, not allowed to live in housing.<br>  <br>  Lets put it simple. Where ever you live, you must maintain a room in the Barracks. Which means you are responsible for what happens to that room and all room inspections.|`|AA10932453	If your permanent station is 50 miles from your home, the Army will have no problem with that.

Fort Stewart, for example, lacks enough housing in Heinsville -- many soldiers live in Savannah, about 50 miles away.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  The people telling you that EMs must live in the barracks are missing just plain wrong.  It seems they missed Tommy Frank's single soldier initiative that is now a quarter-century old.  You can live where you want.

Also some times and with some units you will have a one hour recall time for emergencies, and that may be difficult to comply with. Lastly the commute would defiantly cut into your sleeping time. Most units start P.T. (physical training) at about 6:00 or 6:30 AM. Some times as early as 5:00 AM. Also it is likely that you will get orders to be stationed some where else, and it is likely that you will get deployed. You will have to leave home eventually.<br>      I guess my main question would be why would you want to live at home? The army will provide you with free housing if you are single, and will provide you with housing, or will give you an allowance for rent if you are married. Living at home if you are single would not give you any advantages unless you were to be given housing allowance which is extremely unlikely for about the first 4 years or so.|`|HNH6SqLraa	The Army is your new home.

AA10932453	There are really no "reserves" or "active duty" in the National Guard.<br>  <br>  There are a few (very few) slots for "Active Guard" -- usually one or maybe two soldiers per battalion.  Also, National Guard recruiters are "active" -- meaning they work 5 days a week, but they are not "Active Duty Federal Army".<br>  <br>  For matters of pay, all soldiers get paid the same -- but the weekend- only Guard and Reserve get paid double for the days they show up.  That is, a full workday is considered 4 hours.  When mobilized, however, a full work day is considered 24 hours.<br>  <br>  Anyone that is active -- "active Guard", "Reserve temporally activated" or regular "active duty" get paid only 1 day per day of work.|`|K6zkGj7Zaa	In the Army National Guard the only truly "Active Duty" are what is known as AGR or Active Guard Reserve.  There are only a few per unit and more in Headquarters units and Staff positions.<br>  <br>  The majority of what "appears to be" Active Duty are in fact National Guard Technicians.  Guard Techs are in fact just regular Federal Civil Service positions that require membership in the Guard.  So you are a weekend warrior with the rest of the unit while on drill status, and during the week you are a Civil Service Employee (GS or WG).  All the time wearing the same uniform.<br>  <br>  As long as you maintain your Guard status you can hold your Tech position.  Loose your Guard position (Injury, weight, etc) you loose your Tech position (unless it's on the job related).<br>  <br>  Whats strange is the possibility that a weekend position my outrank someone who may be their supervisor during the weekdays.<br>  Had my Battalion CSM report to a SFC during the week when the CSM was an Air Craft Mech and the SFC was the Shop Supervisor.<br>  Strange, but it worked out.<br>  <br>  As for the "Pay".<br>  AGR are paid the same basic bay for their pay grade as an Regular Active Duty service member.<br>  The Guard Techs are payed for their job position and civil service pay grade.  GS or WG and service/tenure.  Everyone is basically different.
BIQrsl4paa	As a former Army Recruiter, let me answer thusly.<br>  Your recruiter asked if you had ever been Arrested, charged, cited, or held, by any law enforcement agency ever, regardless of the outcome. You answered "Yes". Therefore, you need to provide documentation proving the outcome you claimed.<br>  As for the Zoloft, listen to your Recruiter and keep your mouth shut, they can't access your medical records no matter what they tell you, unless you first tell them about the problem.<br>  Finally, the stitches. The injury which caused the need for them occurred less than 5 years ago, and will require documentation of everything from the initial diagnosis thru the procedure (stitches), to final prognosis. You will have to make that request in writing and the hospital will only provide what is requested.<br>  Hope this answer helps.|`|AA10932453	Hmmm...let me summarize:<br>  <br>  You are drug addled and have a criminal history.

The fact that you needed the Zoloft to handle stress once means you will probably go back to it at some point.  You can not suppress your natural anxiety response and expect to  function in the Army.<br>  <br>  You also have a criminal history.<br>  <br>  Think about why the military would want you.  What are you bringing to the table?  You need to prove to them that you will not commit more criminal mischief and that you will not need mood altering drugs to cope with normal life pressures.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry I came over as harsh, but the reality is you made your choices in life, now you have consequences that accompany those choices.|`|sgEloO1Jaa	if there are scars they will find them and you will have to say how you got them. as far as the stuff involving the law your recruiter will have to get you waivers for that. it doesnt sound like it will be a problem dont stress out so much man|`|6931a8d973e2a0c7f37954ef3a68a4c7aa	Yes you "might" be able to join but you won't be able to get a security clearance.

This was the second time she did it, and we have government assistance programs for people who are in need of food, shelter and clothing.  If this were 100 years ago, I would be much more lenient on her because she would have had less recourse to provide for her family. I can understand your friend's feelings on the matter, but I only really let people off for stealing when they're clearly going to starve and have done everything else in their power to make it.

She should get custodial for this and it may give her a sharp shock and stop her doing it again.<br>  <br>  edit<br>  I think that the sentance is supposed to reflect what is in the interest of the public and I think in a case where it is her second offence (and therefore she is clearly not sorry as if she were she wouldn't have done in the 2nd time) then it is in the interest of the public for her to be punished sufficiently so that she does not reoffend.  I would assume she got a community sentance the first time.  As this did not deterr her from doing this again, I would be looking towards a short custodial sentance.  <br>  To the person who said she would steal for her kids - you should be in prison.<br>  To the person who said she should get off with a sorry - are you for real?|`|d40e4596ee31f7749a7773684fe3ab6baa	Hi. being a single parent does not put anyone above the law. The facts of the case need to be studied carefully. It may be that she just could not see a way out of her situation and saw shoplifting as the only thing she could do to keep her head above water. She may have been left with the debts by a previous partner/husband and sees it as her responsibility to repay them. I think the first thing the courts should do is put her in touch with an appropriate debt management agency and help her get out of the poverty trap she seems to be in currently. Then the children's welfare needs to be considered... are there appropriate family members to take care of the children or would they have to go into temporary foster care? Perhaps as you say community service with a suspended sentence may be the most appropriate action in this case.|`|mNzgWFkGaa	Well that's a difficult one isn't it?  and I'm thinking of cases of stealing in other countries where they will not hesitate to chop your hand off for stealing for a 3rd offence but do nothing to address the reason why the person stole in the first place, namely that they are living in poverty  so should poor people who steal have there hands chopped off in some countries or  should poor people who steal in western countries be sent to jail?  I'd like to see someone trying to argue that a single mother living on benefits isn't living in poverty.  I don't agree with you that she is hurting the people she steals off in any way whatsoever that's way too dramatic and not to put too fine a point on it untrue. Did Winoya rider actually hurt anyone when she stole thousands of dollars worth of stuff from that department store that time?  Or is this in a way more punishable because the woman is a single mother and therefore  we can lay more blame at her feet?  I go with the lighter punishment, if only because kids shouldn't be hurted because of there parents and i think jails should be full of real criminals instead of poor single mothers.|`|8c26794a87dbf74cd24ea326b3136147aa	I understand that magistrates are limited in the length of prison sentences they can give. They should pass this case up to the next level of the justice system so that an adequate sentence should be given.<br>  I don't care about the criminal's personal circumstances, they are probably of her own making anyway, and that appears to be her love of getting bedded for her own pleasure.<br>   We have enough do-gooders in this country who try to get thieves off the hook.

AA11270223	As a general rule, they don't publish the names and pictures of minors in the newspapers to protect their identity because they are minors.  As far as jail-time, I don't know.  I'm not a lawyer and I don't know all the details of this case.  But I can guarantee you that you didn't think about getting kicked out of school or getting arrested, until it was too late.  A lot of times -- whether it's fair or not -- you are judged by the company you keep.  If you're hanging out with stoners, then everyone will assume that you're using too.  If you're not, then why hang with the stoners?  Talk to your parents, your priest, or somebody else you trust and get some good advice.  Next time, think about it before you get involved in something that you're not ready to handle.|`|l2MjVVpRaa	I doubt you need to worry about the newspaper telling anyone.<br>  <br>  I'm sure that the 'rumor mill' will let the school know immediately.<br>  <br>  It's called 'constructive custody'.... it there was dope on any of them, they can all be charged.

I know three guys who just applied to the RCMP and to municipal police and had their applications rejected for this.  One guy had admitted to use several years ago and was rejected because they thought he was too old when he started experimenting (he was a late bloomer) and they see him as a high risk.  Second guy was like you and tried to clarify his answer which they felt meant he lied.  And the third guy admitted he was at a halloween party that someone smoked weed.  He did not, but they said he should have left.

When you go thru SFAS, Q Course, language, SEREs, etc, you're on active duty since those are active duty schools.<br>  Upon completion of all the training, you go back to monthly drills unless you're activated which is highly probable.  Even then, you would only stay active until that tour is over (unless you re-upped for active duty).|`|n2oEhdZiaa	There are no combat formations of any sort in the Reserves.

W1xs3vYBaa	I don't smoke. I also don't drink or take any substance that alters my state of mind. It doesn't interest me. <br>  <br>  On a personal note, I don't like pot because I know people who have a dependence on it and it has negatively affected their lives.<br>  <br>  Still, it could be a very good form of tax revenue and would make it much safer. At the moment Cannabis is grown and distributed through organized crime, and keeping it in the hands of those individuals increases their wealth and decreases the wealth of the state because of medical, police and legal expenses. All in all it makes no financial sense to allow drug traffickers to accumulate wealth when the state could be. It would also be healthier for the society to smoke it, because people are and always will be (it is a part of some peoples religions-Rastafari for one) and so we should decrease the risk to the individual. Still, I don't believe that harder drugs that are physically addictive, like heroin, should be legalized because they are addictive substances and my overall stance on drugs is that addictive prescription drugs are over prescribed, to the determent of society.<br>  <br>  Also, if the US legalized, or even decriminalized, Cannabis and stopped treating it like cocaine than Canada could start making tax revenue off of it. We've already de-criminalized it, but because of the war on drugs down south we cannot legalize it without our border becoming a solid gate which would destroy trade. <br>  <br>  So, here's to hoping you start to take a pragmatic approach, teach people not to smoke any substance, and tax those that choose to destroy their health so I can stop living above a nanny state that actually encourages the use of pot by making it an exciting, and elusive substance.|`|4BoteYDwaa	I think it would be fine, it's still far safer (and healthier) than alcohol. Private would mean, in your own home or for personal use and not for commercial sale.|`|OinmziYvaa	Without a doubt, cannabis should be legalised.<br>  <br>  People getting stoned at home (or in a controlled environment such as Amsterdam's coffeeshops, for that matter) do far less harm to themselves and others than alchohol drinkers, tobacco smokers and users of other recreational drugs, by a long, long way. I've never seen a stoned person start a fight, ever. And all the hogwash in the UK press about psychosis is just that, press claptrap that has no substance behind it whatsoever and relies solely on anecdotal evidence and badly flawed or biased studies. <br>  <br>  I feel that a lot of people would benefit from using cannabis, who would normally disregard it just because it's illegal, and never even question why it is illegal. The movie Grass, a history of prohibition in the USA, gives a lot of insight into this and it really is a total swindle. The campaign to ban marijuana was totally fuelled by lies and corruption, people who had massive interests in the cotton industry which was about to be undercut by the superior hemp plant financially backed it and it was a success, and people started getting sent to jail for smoking weed. Atrocious.<br>  <br>  I also think the recent news that Michael Phelps got busted hooting on a bong will do a lot to dismiss the view that cannabis acually turns people into lazy unmotivated stoners. I know plenty of stoners and yes, some are lazy but I know teetotal people who have never touched drugs who are also lazy. I also know stoners who get more done in a day than most people do in a week. It's a myth.<br>  <br>  Sure, cannabis is bad for you, but it is a vice, and it helps to see it as that. All vices are bad for you, especially alchohol and tobacco which help pay for hositals through tax revenue, so why can't cannabis be the same? It certainly does less damage to society than those, or it certainly would, if it's distribution didn't involve a large network of organised criminals. Criminals, it should be noted, do not tend to require ID at sale. Amsterdam coffeeshops do. The amount of under 18's who smoke cannabis there is significantly lower than in the UK, the USA or France who have generally much harsher laws on the drug.<br>  <br>  So, it seems to me that the major problems associated with cannabis stem from it's being illegal. If it were legal a whole load of smugglers, dealers and kingpins would be hit hard in the pocket, while the government reaped the tax pennies which we so desparately need right now. It would be harder for kids to get their hands on the stuff and responsible adults wouldn't be in jail at our expense and much police and court time for putting a harmless plant into their bodies. Also, medicinal users of the plant could use it without fear and will not have to deal with shady underworld characters to get their medicine.<br>  <br>  So, in summary, I can see nothing except benefits to legalising cannabis. Why it isn't already legal is baffling to me.|`|2f6UATGOaa	Legalize it.

1KGXts5Daa	As a highly trained and experienced commander of a fire department hazardous materials response team, as well as state certified hazardous materials instructor, I can tell you that mercury exposure poses significant hazards to human health.  It is not "nothing" as some posters have stated.<br>  <br>  Perhaps the most ludicrous statement regarding your question is this one: "Before lawsuits, mercury was much less harmful."<br>  <br>  Mercury (once known as "quicksilver") caused widespread "mad hatters disease" - aka: insanity, resulting from chronic exposure to mercury - in England a couple hundred years ago.  To my knowledge, there were no civil lawsuits filed at that time in the UK.<br>  <br>  Fortunately, from your description, it does not sound like your son or any other person was a victim of exposure to a toxic substance.  The fact that your son required medical attention as a direct result of this incident, however, is sufficient and legitimate reason to file a civil action (civil lawsuit seeking compensatory - and possibly punitive - damages from the responsible party/parties).<br>  <br>  My guess is that the reason your son's school was closed down for several days is that, initially, it was declared a hazardous materials incident which was handled by the fire department.  <br>  <br>  Following all action required to mitigate and to protect life, environment and property the scene was turned over to an environmental health or industrial hygene clean-up contractor, and then finally declared safe for return to normal functions by your local county health department.  This scenario would be typical, and is one I am very familiar with.  It takes days to weeks, depending on complexity.<br>  <br>  That fact alone should tell some of the uninformed posters here that this is not "your own paranoia", or that "your son...had a panic attack over nothing."  This is the type of wildly incorrect thinking that causes these types of individuals to suffer huge financial losses and possible criminal indictment.<br>  <br>  I am not an attorney, so will not advise you as to whether or not you are likely to be successful at recovering any damages from this incident.  However, as I stated before, this is a legitimate scenario for filing suit in civil court.  Be prepared to put out money up front, both in filing fees, and (possibly) attorney fees (depending on what type of compensation schedule you negotiate).  This is not the type of case you would want to serve as your own legal counsel for, in my opinion.<br>  <br>  I have experience testifying as a qualified expert witness in cases similar to this (however my experience has been in testifying for the defense, as opposed to the petitioner - which in this case would be you if your son is a minor).<br>  <br>  The point that has been missed by most posters here is that this is not a frivolous lawsuit - regardless of eventual outcome - and it is not about bringing financial ruin to the school, school district, or individual employees.  It is about the bigger picture of preventing danger to life and health (in this case, mostly to school students), as well as to the environment and to property.<br>  <br>  For anyone who is even the least bit familiar with the term "superfund" and the cleanup and health hazard reduction at places like "love canal", "three-mile island", and Santa Barbara, CA (from the pesticide, DDT) they should be aware that all were the result of civil litigation - which in each case significantly improved the health and safety of all of us.|`|n7hezV5aaa	There certainly can be.

So why were they opposed to our involvement?<br>  <br>  Let me start from the beginning. Australia became involved in the Vietnam war in 1962 due to the strong anti-communist feeling by the Australian public. At the time, they believed in the "domino theory" that if Vietnam goes "Red" (defeated by communist), Australia would become the next target. So people saw the war as black and white. <br>  <br>  We also the need to help the USA in case we need their help in the future (we're close allies). <br>  <br>  But by 1969, the war intensified. As people saw the inhumanity of war from the telly, our initial perception of the "black and white" war became "grey". Our veterans from Vietnam developed post-traumatic stress disorder. The conscientious objectors were against conscription by the Aust. government Aust. Army because they were morally against the killing of others (particularly their view that we stepped into their country to kill their people). Also, more than 2 million indo-chinese were forced to abandon their beloved war-torn country by boat, and some arrived in Aust. <br>  <br>  2. How did they react to our involvement in the Vietnam war?<br>  <br>  -Uni students protested against the war and went on a student strike.<br>  -Many motherss of young conscripted soldiers formed the "Save Our Sons" (SOS) campaign to demand the immediate abolition of conscription. So soon, public protest united different groups.<br>  <br>  Eventually, in 1972, the New Labour Prime Minister Gough Whitlam abolished compulsory national service (of young men 18 yrs or older) and ended our 10-year involvement in the Vietnam War. many veterans developed serious health complications from exposure to dangerous chemicals (Agent Orange - a pesticide used to destroy vegetation in vietnam).<br>  <br>  LOL I love Aust. history. I can't believe I just wrote all that!!! Anyway hope I helped.|`|Q8GFvklUaa	RED DRAGONS!|`|TtMKPBR3aa	yes i agree with you
mxXwQRfxaa	No one here in the US even wants to think of the prospect.  We are all spoiled and think American wealth is a given.  That somehow we are entitled to success and prosperity even if we don't work for it.  Sadly, most of the people in America who earned its wealth are dead now, and cannot tell us how hard they worked to give us what we have.   Americans today are spoiled, lazy, and unmotivated.  I say this as a 25 year-old.  Soon the wealth begot in blood will run dry, and we will be left at the mercy of nations which begrudgingly lent us their own wealth.  They did so under the premise that the US was still a strong nation, and would pay back it's debt with hustle and interest.  Now when they see our wastefulness in excess and arrogance, don't think for a second they won't pull the rug out from under us, so to speak.  <br>  <br>  The people want entitlements?  The only entitlements headed your way are to bow and speak Chinese.  It is time to take the government back from bureaucrats and lawyers, and put it back in the hands of the people.  It is almost too late.  The public needs to re-learn in innovation, hard work, and personal sacrifice.|`|f4Yec6iNaa	We will have to print the money, this is already being done.

So long as people get to vote in their favorite party they are happy with whatever they do to us.<br>  <br>  If the republicans are in power then all their supporters are fine with whatever happens, so long as the pubs are doing it. If the democrats are in power then all their supporters are fine with whatever they do to us so long as the Dems are doing it.<br>  <br>  These are the two factions of American politics. They will never come together under one banner to end the corruption and trampling of THE LAW!<br>  <br>  They are too busy calling each other fascists or communists.<br>  America is its own worst enemy.<br>  <br>  The rest of us are just some weird social fanatics who are delusional or even out right insane.<br>  <br>  I write this in the hope that it will piss all of them off. The only way to get us together is to get us all pissed off at the same thing.|`|SCzrZosXaa	Not gonna happen. Most Americans are too apathetic, too concerned about themselves not like the generations before that stood up no matter the consequences. The liberals like to talk alot but in the end do nothing, conservatives would have too much to lose, the poor would be overwhelmed by the state/federal forces quickly and the rich don't want to risk losing their mansions and beemers to take a stand.|`|FdZtCnwhaa	Until people realise that they are paying for everything that politician get for being in office, none of this will happen.

While this is going on, Americans are incredibly apathetic towards forcing societal change.  We are too content with distracting ourselves with pop culture.|`|tCQ8DfFFaa	I agree, but try thinking about down the line, maybe in 20 years or so, an example of a governmental change that has occurred this year was in Iceland, an "Atlantic Switzerland" in terms of its financial connections, and corruption. In January, the current ruling party was ousted by weeks of widespread, non-violent revolt by youth activists and the unemployed.  As for the USA, the only way We the People will revolt is after massive commodity (water, food, fuel) shortages, government repression, and further wars of imperialist aggression occurr. The proven methods to combat this are non-violent protests, civil disobedience, and the unification of moderate right and left parties under one banner.|`|3tQZ0Y9Paa	I have to agree. I will even give your question an interesting point.  I like your approach.  This topic is unheard of, but needs to be discussed.  I believe it will happen before the next election.  The people will finally be tired of what has happened. Although, the people who had voted the current prez, will be unable to let go of his welfare state.  Then I see a revolt.  Not because they wish to be free, but you're taking government shelter away from them.|`|AA11422300	It's the same here in the UK !!!|`|mxXwQRfxaa	We have the option to revolt every 2 years by holding elections.  These elections essentially overthrow the government should we choose to do so.  I don't think any rational person wants bloodshed and violent revolution when there is a proven system in place to allow nonviolent transfer of power.  This is what our fore-fathers fought for, and we have it.  We were the first to have it, in fact.  If you want the government to change, get involved.|`|8j70Neqeaa	very interesting,

YOU'RE RETARDED.  WE'VE BEEN BORROWING MONEY FROM CHINA SINCE THE LATE 80'S.  THE GOVERNMENT CAN PRINT MONEY WHENEVER THEY WANT.<br>  <br>  INFLATION IS A *****.  IN 2 YEARS AFTER OBAMA'S DONE, $1 WILL BE WORTH AROUND .40 CENTS.  NO MORE DOLLAR MENUS FOR THE LAZY/OBESE.|`|f4Yec6iNaa	This is a good question, you have to remember that it is better for the government to borrow money rather than print it. Printing money is highly inflationary, while borrowing money is not. When inflation get too high, the public will be alarmed and the politicians will have to get back their spending. Obviously they do not want that to happen.|`|nnG8rLxgaa	Our country is broke so we need borrow billions from China they now subsidize our government.|`|LCqL6Z2laa	The government already does both at the same time.<br>  <br>  They can't print too much or inflation would get out of control and the sheepeople would notice this.

1KGXts5Daa	No, there is not one single list of current US "laws".  <br>  <br>  Laws take many, many forms.  One form are "codes": United States Code, Code of Federal Regulations, California (as one out of 50 states) Penal Code, Vehicle Code, Health and Safety Code, Welfare and Institutions Code, Code of Civil Procedure, Uniform Fire Code, Uniform Building Code, Uniform Electrical Code, and on and on and on and on...<br>  <br>  Another form of law is "case law" derived from judicial decisions.<br>  <br>  There is no way for any one individual to have a working knowledge of every law in the US.|`|emNCaAq7aa	Most cities, some other government entities, counties, all states and the federal government have separate laws.

h2LmAM0Baa	It's not illegal, consider yourself lucky your company gave you more than they had to when times were good. That's how it goes when things get bad, the company wants to save money and they realize they dont need to give you perks. My company did the exact same thing. I used to get two paid hours and a 30min unpaid for a 12 hour shift. No more. Now it's 30mins unpaid. (Nobody follows it though) And we even have to punch out, which is new. Used to just take 30mins off our checks.<br>  <br>  EDIT= But he cannot keep you from being paid for your sick/vacation time.

Even though you are in the UK and I'm in America, I am willing to bet the labor laws are very similar. Here, we only get 15 minutes for any less than 6 hours of work, 30 for 8 hours, and I'm not sure about anymore time required. I have personally worked a 15 hours shift on only one 30 minute break earning a horrible hourly wage.<br>  <br>  As for the holiday time, my boss is having that same issue. If her boss were to say no, then she must postpone her vacation, and this is a local government job.<br>  <br>  I think you should just be glad to have a job right now. The economies are failing internationally. Soon, people will be lining up to take your job from you and be very content with those hours.|`|n7hezV5aaa	To say that your boss is being an unreasonable bastard would be an understatement. What he is doing is illegal. If you are concerned about standing up to him because you think you would lose your job, then talk to the rest of the people who work there and stand up to him, all together. Threaten to file a law suit if he says anything about firing you and besides...he can't fire the whole company.
1KGXts5Daa	On Saturday, March 25, 1911, a fire broke out on the top floors of the Triangle Shirtwaist factory. The “shirtwaist”—a woman’s blouse—was one of the country’s first  ready-made clothing affordable even for working women.  <br>  <br>  Firefighters arrived at the scene, but their ladders weren’t tall enough to reach the upper floors of the 10-story building. <br>  <br>  Trapped inside because the owners had locked the fire escape exit doors, workers jumped to their deaths. In a half an hour, the fire was over, and 146 of the 500 workers—mostly young women—were dead.<br>  <br>  The shirtwaist makers, as young as age 15, worked seven days a week, from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. with a half-hour lunch break. During the busy season, the work was nearly non-stop. <br>  <br>  They were paid about $6 per week. In some cases, they were required to use their own needles, thread, irons and occasionally their own sewing machines. <br>  <br>  The factories also were unsanitary; women had to leave the building to use the bathroom, so management began locking the steel exit doors to prevent the “interruption of work” and only the foreman had the key.<br>  <br>  Years before the Triangle fire, garment workers actively sought to improve their working conditions—including locked exits in high-rise buildings—that led to the deaths at Triangle. <br>  <br>  A week after the fire, Anne Morgan and Alva Belmont hosted a meeting at the Metropolitan Opera House to demand action on fire safety, and people of all backgrounds packed the hall. A few days later, more than 350,000 people participated in a funeral march for the Triangle dead.<br>  <br>  Three months later, after pressure from activists, New York’s governor signed a law creating the Factory Investigating Commission. The commission investigated nearly 2,000 factories in dozens of industries and, with the help of such workers’ rights advocates as Frances Perkins, enacted eight laws covering fire safety, factory inspections and sanitation and employment rules for women and children. <br>  <br>  The following year, they pushed for 25 more laws—entirely rewriting New York State’s labor laws and creating a State Department of Labor to enforce the laws. <br>  <br>  During the Roosevelt administration, Frances Perkins and Robert Wagner (who chaired the commission) helped create the nation’s most sweeping worker protections through the New Deal, including the National Labor Relations Act.<br>  <br>  1938 Fair Labor Standards Act establishes first minimum wage and 40-hour week.<br>  <br>  From the National Labor Relations Act and Social Security Act of 1935 to the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 and the Family Medical Leave Act of 1993, labor unions have been instrumental in securing labor legislation and standards. <br>  <br>  The Occupation Safety and Health Act of 1970 (OSHA) provided the foundation for the Occupation Safety and Health Administration, which enforces safety and health standards at places of work. The administration's purpose is to limit work-related injury, illness, and death due to known unsafe working conditions. <br>  <br>  In the manufacturing industry, for example, the probability that OSHA inspections would be initiated by worker complaints was as much as 45% higher in unionized workplaces than in nonunion ones.<br>  <br>  Unions give workers a voice on the job about safety, security, pay, benefits—and about the best ways to get the work done. <br>  <br>  On average, union workers’ wages are 30 percent higher than their nonunion counterparts and union members also enjoy the union advantage of better benefits, working conditions and a voice on the job about how the work gets done.|`|AA10672774	What is your question.|`|SCzrZosXaa	They were started to protect workers and get decent wages for the jobs they were doing.

For years now the US government has been developing a prosthetic arm unlike anything ever before seen under the DARRPA program defense sciences office.  This would be a very good thing for me as I have one hand that is, well, less than functional.  But it occurred to me that if I were to try to get the arm and the procedure there would be no way I could pay for it under what I make in the civillian world, nevermind the fact that it is still experimental.  Now, orginially I was against the idea of a nationalized healthcare program in the United States.  But now that I look at it in a more personal terms, I see that it could be a good thing.  I mean, I could get back to having a relatively normal life, and not have to do anything illegal or unethical to get to it.|`|tBSChaT9aa	Cool-yet scary might be good for soldiers on the battle field so if they get captured they can quickly be found..

Now the point of the matter is... you and I together cannot be more intelligent than the President and his entire cabinet along with Congress.  So, what's the agenda?  There has to be a reason why they are pushing this bill despite the inevitable consequences that yield very little benefit.  What gives?      When you find out why, then you can begin to see the bigger picture...    "This present window of opportunity, during which a truly peaceful and interdependent world order might be built, will not be open for too long - We are on the verge of a global transformation.

This CANNOT be ALLOWED to continue!  We must stop it!  If it does go thru as Obama has it RIGGED to do, OUR Country is doomed!  Not only for OUR Generation, but it will only worsen rapidly for those of our Future Generations...   But, then when one really takes a serious look at it, really delves deep into what all it's going to do NOT do...  There will be NOTHING for ANY Future Generations except Poverty; NO Health Care at ALL; NO jobs; NO Mortgages or Hopes of Owning a Home because ONLY the More Wealthy will be able to get loans for homes.  Or      Not to worry though, of course, for the Generations that have learned to "Play" the Democratic Welfare Systems so well, or for the Illegal Aliens who've become their "Pet" Projects to cater to, & fulfill EVERY Dream that USED to be one that was reserved for EVERY Hard-Working AMERICAN!  They will have everything provided for Them!  You notice that the ONLY mention of ANY Help for Housing mentioned in his so-called "Stimulus" Plan is the MILLIONS of $$ he's set aside to Upgrade, Improve, blah, blah, blah...  PUBLIC Housing!  Now we All know to which "Housing" this refers to, & who lives in this housing!   All the while Obama, & his Close pals running Freddie Mac & Fannie Mae, who received 100s of BILLIONS of $$$ of OUR Tax Money in the Other "Stimulus" Plan, ALL laughed Their way to their luxurious vacations; the buying of villas & huge estates for "vacation" homes;  fleets of unbelievable FOREIGN sports cars; & NOW 100s of BILLIONS over 20 yrs. to have their Name on a Sport's Stadium!    While people are continuing by record numbers to lose their HOMES where so much of the $$$ were to have gone!    Obama's "Stimulus" Package is even WORSE than the prior one, if that's possible!  Because it's putting Us & Our Country into an even Higher Deficit!   One that We'll NEVER be able to climb out of!  Even worse, it's with a jealous, power hungry Country that has always hated us, wanted to destroy us by any means!  Our gov't. gave them their 1st big Step-Up toward this in the demands they allowed the EPA, the IRS, & others to put on our American Cos., to the degree that they totally moved their businesses over there!  Now we're inundated with cheap, dangerous, inferior products, & most of all, they've stolen, or more factually, have been handed on a silver platter, Multi-Millions + of American jobs!      What is really horrible is that these jobs are being done by Little Children!  Most held in Concentration Camp environments like the slaves they in TRUTH are.  Almost 100% of them are Female Children; again, because Females have NO benefit, NO worth at ALL in China!  Why isn't the EPA, the U.N. & all the whining cowards over there fighting for their rights instead of those of a bunch of Murderous, Terrorists in Guitmo?  Why hasn't Obama mentioned them?  Why hasn't he mentioned the fact that his spending BILLIONS on forcing young illiterate black girls in 3rd World Countries to have abortions, just like the Mandate in China where they force these upon Women carrying Female BABIES...  Or, how in China, they take it even further, & MURDER Female Babies when they're born!    Why isn't he or the crying Liberals protesting that?  I will tell you why!      They want to make us even MORE Indebted to China with this "NEW" INSANE "Stimulus" Package in borrowing MANY MORE 100s of BILLIONS of DOLLARS from them...  That We can NEVER Pay Back in OUR, our Children, or their ChildrensLifetimes!        These "Stimulus" Packages are far from being Stimulating!  Some Political Spinners really worked hard on coming up with that word instead of what they truly should have been called which is the ANTONYMS of "Stimulus"!  Now look at the meanings of "STIMULUS," & the OPPOSITES/ANTONYMS of it, & YOU tell me which should Obama's REALLY be called?!  STIMULUS -Synonyms:  Spur; Incitement; Inducement; & Incentive   ANTONYMS:  Deterrent; Destruction; Dissuasion; & Hindrance|`|63c6ad890d0828ff609c53ea0a1378e0aa	I think it is just what we need. It reminds me of Franklin Roosevelts New Deal. And people were just as against it. He was iinagurated in 1933, after Hoover about lost the country. He started the Social Security Act, Emergency Relief Programs, Work Relief Programs, The WPa, the CCC. The public works system started job, men were put to work building infrastructure, bridges, high schools, hospitals, the CCC was put mostly to work in our National Parks System, cutting trees in parks to make room for people to camp in the great outdoors, and boy did the people laugh about that, but until you have camped out in Holly River State Park and gone to the Pavallion to a square dance, or a sing along you do not know how wonderfull our state parks all over America can be. And building High Schools, why the old timers used to sit around and say, the one room school house was good enough for them, why these fancy high school. And Social Security, who ever heard of the government paying money to old people so they could be more comfortable and live a decent life, stuff and nonsense, they said. They predicted the US would run out of money by 1945.  And his wife, Eleanor Roosevelt, trying to make things better for the coal miners, who ever heard of such fool ideas. Well I was born in 1935 and by the time I was five, I remember seeing the lines of men still out of work. A knock on the door, a man in rags, asking for a bit of supper, mom always put extra potatoes in the pot, and she always made biscuits and gravy and she never turned away anyone. If you think about it the war against Iraq (Bush's illegal adventure) will cost one trillion dollars, it is costing us 2 million dollars each and every day. So 900 billion to put American back to work does not see very large to me.  And now Obama is trying to get us back to work, and people are yelling about him, just like they did about Roosevelt, but he wants to rebuild our infrastructure, he want to increase our internet broadband so even farm people can receive internet. Do you know America is 15th in the world in internet. And so many people now work out of their homes on their computers, saves green house gases from fuel in the air. I have a girl friend in California who has an Avocado ranch, her fax machine comes in with the orders and she prints out how much to send out on trucks. The internet has still not reached it's full peak.  He wants every child who wants an education to be able to get one, nothing wrong with that, but a lot of people think, why do kids need an education, I got by without one, let them struggle too. He wants child care, child health care. He wants teacher and nurses not to have to pay back student loans, these are our service positions and we need more good teachers and nurses.   They laughed at Roosevelt, but he has gone down in History as one of our best Presidents, and I am Confident Obama will too, just today he brought another republican into his staff. He is truly trying to be a bipartisan leader. His plan to invest in alternative energy, do you really think gas is going to remain as low as it is now? Wait until next summer until we get used to low prices and the price will go right back up, Why not alternative fuel, why not cars that get better miles to the gallon, and less lead in our air. The President is trying, he is stopping torture, stopping sending prisoners to secret overseas prisons, closing Gitmo, how many millions has been wasted in Gitmo. He is trying to bring our boys home in 16 months. Lets give the man a chance before we start to curse him.

One things for sure though is that history keeps repeating itself when it comes to politics..|`|b6c9b3f40f9ac8337ea22396c739b02faa	Let's just make this simple:  President Bush was a giant jerkoff and he made fools of all of us in front of the entire world, made enemies we did not need to have, and acted with no regard to what anyone wanted but the people lining his pockets. Regardless of whether or not being a total scumbag is a crime, or specifically fits into any of your preselected choices, he was of no benefit to this country whatsoever.|`|8uJVN1n3aa	Do you really think that anyone is going to do your homework for you, question by question?

Hillary Clinton for one.     5) French, German, English, and Americal intelligence all said W.M.D.     6) None... Saddam DID use W.M.D. against the Kurds in Iraq... facts are the facts.     7)no, his hate for the U.S. is large... he put out a "hit" on Bush Sr.     8) Please...

Yes  authorized torture and admitted to it. Hides behind the defense that his lawyer John Yoo declared waterboarding "not torture"  he lied us into a war with Iraq  He failed to act to prevent 9/11 gross negligence  He used banned weapons on Iraqi people  He violated the terms of the Geneva Convention with his wrongful imprsionment in Gitmo  He denied Jose Padilla, a US citizen basic civil rights to be charged and tried for the accused crime. He just threw him in jail with no trial- the S.C. had to get him out and tried  Bush also outed a CIA agent and pardoned the man who covered up the crime. That is treason and conspiracy  he should be tried in federal court, but Obama wont do it  so expect Bush to be tried in absentia in the international court for torture  2. Many democrats voted for the war. They werent given access to the intelligence Bush was, they didnt know that the Dept of energy poo=poo ed the aluminum tubes story  they didnt know that Joe Wilson poo-pooed the yellowcake story  they didnt know that Muhamad Atta did not meet with Iraq officials as Cheney said  they did not know that the stories they read about WMD in the New York TImes were planted there by CHeney  b- some, others were bribed with aid to vote for the war  c-all of them.

No, he did it because Iraq was in direct violation of 9 UN Security Council Resolutions, was using chemical weapons on citizens of his own country, and was threatening to cut off oil to our European and Asian allies, thereby sending them into economic turmoil (and then sending us into economic turmoil).     a) a lot of Democrats voted for the war in Iraq...Hillary Clinton was actually one of the leading proponents for the war     b) none...Iraq had WMD...they used it on their own people for crying out loud     c) none (see answer above)     d) no     e) yes...he purchased some from Russia and developed some in-house  3. Yes...power makes people do crazy things, especially when the liberal media is fueling them.    If you're going to ask questions chocked full of obvious pro-left bias, and obviously asking for answers only from those members of the political left, then that's not exactly a good sampling for a poli sci report.  A good political scientist will ask neutral questions and get answers from the left, the right, and the center.  Unfortunately, most colleges and professors are very politically liberal and will bias their coursework in that regard.  Shame on them!|`|ZWePAEZUaa	Yes to all of your answers.|`|428efb71e699232f9f19f3ae05c0947caa	Why don't you do your own research?  It's your homework, not ours.|`|Y6DUXDfdaa	Why just ask Democrats?  If you want facts, just ask for them.  It's going to be tough given the loaded nature of your questions.    As for voting in Iraq:  A)  Yes they did.  The us vs them jargon coming from the white house made any opposition to the war on terror seem treasonous and the popularity of the president at the time would make opposing the war political suicide.  Even the "liberal media" was very supportive of the president and provided little opposition during the run up to the war.  B)  Most of the 132 nations were going on the intelligence that we provided for them.  We knew the information was shaky at best but that, of course, was not how it was presented to those nations nor to the people of this country during the State of the Union address.  C)  We know that the main scientist telling us about WMDs was lying.  I'll try to find the documentation on that.    EDIT:  Here is the story as printed in the LA Times:                               Curveball's German handlers for the last six years said his information was often vague, mostly secondhand and impossible to confirm.  >>  That's at least one liar, and he's the one Bush used to make his case for war.  You wanted documentation, you got it.  D)  I'm sure he was not lying, but that doesn't mean he had the ability to do it.  E)  Certainly, from a financial standpoint, he could afford WMD's.  Once again, none were ever found.    As for your final question, the answer is yes.  Ask Rush Limbaugh.|`|AA11496527	Not a Democrat or Republican, but wanted you to know that most of the questions you asked, will have the answers using Keith Olberman and MSNBC as their source. That would be just the reverse if you asked for Republican sources.. That would be FOX I'm sure. Good questions and hope you get what you want for an answer.
n5Fkuxz5aa	Very clever, I like your style. <br>  <br>  In his inaugural address, William Henry Harrison said "A decent and manly examination of the acts of government should be not only tolerated, but encouraged."  I agree with the short-lived Harrison. Attempting to quash dissent because "we're at war" is wrong. War does not mean the government is beyond reproach and it was terrible for members of the Bush Administration and his ardent supporters to suggest otherwise.|`|oWicCn28aa	I don't as long as it's not considered un-American to question this administration as well.

There is no excuse for this and its hurtful and frankly its depressing as we are all part of this country. We are not just a white face we come in all colors all religions and different mindsets. Not one is better then another one but it seems like some people feel they are superior and they can put Obamas color and you name it on here and they somehow feel good about this. It says alot about the mentality and type and quality of a persons character doesnt it and frankly its very depressing and makes our country look so ignorant and backwards.|`|Xmr76hGJaa	it is unamerican to not question the government.<br>  I agreed with the war, but I would stand up and die for someone else's <br>  right to question it and disagree with me.<br>  <br>  It is our duty to question what the government does, and stand up when the government is wrong, For example the stimulis bill that just got signed by obama that will turn america into a socialist country was wrong, and It is my duty as an american to stand up against it.|`|uithGZOwaa	No,  I don't agree that it is anti American to question the government.<br>  <br>  It's our duty to question the government.|`|teKeLxX2aa	Absolutely, they should teach kids who watch Dora the Explorer to think more American. <br>  <br>  Had it not been for those rebellious young adults during the 1960's, we would've won that war.|`|cO9lH8f6aa	Nah, your attempt at reverse psychology failed.|`|AA10527991	That was funny.

They did the right thing, by your logic, when they were told to gas Jews and shoot entire towns in the head.  They were following their government and you said that's the right thing to do. So, you are clearly saying that the Holocaust was the right thing to do - because the right thing to do is to follow your government. <br>  <br>  There are a hundred more historical examples just like this last one. <br>  <br>  Questioning your leaders and your government is always the right thing to do. It's called critical thinking, and America is going down the tubes right now because we DON'T do it. Too many people think like you do, Dora. <br>  <br>  I have a degree in history despite my being a Classical musician. Your ideas about the Founding Fathers "working together" no matter what is LAUGHABLE. Jefferson was very upset about what the others were doing. They disagreed about how to found the Republic to no end. You should try reading the Federalist Papers at some point in your life. It's nothing but a long winded debate between the Founders (it was written by 3 but the debate was between all the Founders). All they did was argue about how to found a Republic.<br>  <br>  The others are right. You are a fascist, Dora. One day you might wake up and realize it.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  <br>  I'm seriously glad you were joking and I wouldn't have posted this had you written that sooner. Oh well. I'll leave this here for the folks that took you seriously and actually supported your viewpoint.<br>  <br>  Another edit:<br>  <br>  Why are people trying to look smart by claiming this was obvious sarcasm when it clearly wasn't? Face it - you guys had the benefit of being told clearly that it was sarcasm. There was no way to tell at first. You people just want to look smart.|`|CGr6EtRUaa	The last sentence of your 2nd paragraph sums it up. Why do you think the 1st Amendment was passed in the first place?<br>  <br>  Far from being unpatriotic, citizens of a democracy have a right and indeed a duty to question their government. The government is elected by the people and is therefore accountable to them. Didn't Abraham Lincoln say something to that effect in his speech at Gettysburg?<br>  <br>  I'm British and nobody would call me a 'traitor' merely because I question the actions of Gordon Brown and his government. Similarly I don't think you can write off millions of loyal Americans as 'traitors' simply because they didn't agree with GW Bush and his Administration.|`|3r1TwMCQaa	On the contrary I think that questioning government is extremely American. In fact your right to question government is guaranteed by the Constitution, something very few other countries can say. If you would prefer to live in a country that you don't question government go find a nice dictatorship to live in. And yes the founding fathers did question government. They questioned the right of the king of England to govern Americans. So how can you say questioning government is un-American, our whole country was formed by questioning government.|`|AA11148986	Can't tell if your being sarcastic, but I'll take it seriously.<br>  <br>  Actually, I think it's pro-American to question the government. I don't care if you agree with the president or not, as long as your open to debate their policies or decisions, go for it.<br>  <br>  Not because you blindly agree to whatever someone on TV or radio said.|`|BpcgaJd4aa	I don't. I think we have an obligation as citizens to question the government.<br>  <br>  And our Founders did not just go along with everything the President did. There was much debate that went on in Congress.

If so, we may as well embrace socialism or even communism.|`|PHpKo5hZaa	You need work on your communications skills. If you're sarcastic in writing, you'll have to signal in more apparent ways - even if that means saying right out that you're using sarcasm.<br>  <br>  People are not mind readers. And writing has no facial expression or body language clues.<br>  <br>  Edit: By the way, I love Dora the Explorer! I guess that means you...|`|TAYErNRkaa	No, I think it's time for a paradigm shift. It's our responsibility to question our politicians, from the top down. We begin the process of checks and balances out here where life is lived. If we left it solely up to our leaders to monitor each other, well we don't want to see what that world would look like. Public opinion dictates the way our leaders govern. We the people are the leadership of direction, and the governing bodies have been elected and empowered to serve the interests of the majority rule. And by the way, the sessions that brought men like Washington, Adams, and Franklin together during the framing of our constitution and forever after were anything but peaceful. Those gentlemen were very opinionated statesmen who probably preferred to listen to your ideas after you agreed with them. I believe those early sessions were quite loud and animated.

Hitler did not want to reestablish any monarchy.<br>  <br>  EDIT: It appears the guy next to Hitler on Manson's site is Joesph Goebbels, Hitler's Minister of "propaganda."<br>  <br>  EDIT, the sequel: There was nothing free about Germany's market under Hitler. He viewed capitalism as holding back the true power of German might. To believe otherwise is ignorant, at best.|`|tCQ8DfFFaa	Hitler was not a socialist. The only German in the last 150 years or so that was socialist was Karl Marx. Even then, socialism wasn't around a great deal then... But  to correct a previous answer, the notion that the political spectrum "ends up going the other way" is misleading. In fact, the left and the right meet at top in an extremist form, instead of at the bottom of the spectrum where moderate politics exist. Anyway, Hitler's party, the NDGP, or in English, the German Nationalist Socialist Party, is commonly known as the Nazi party. The "socialist" part was just a buzz word back then. Really this just creates a load of confusion, not to mention headaches for socialist activists having to break totalitarian stereotypes about socialism.|`|vy8SRHxlaa	sure the nazis were national socialists but that is not socialism.

If my neighbor is found to be negligent, their insurance company may very well not do the same.  That's their problem.<br>  <br>  @ bekindtoanimals - By your logic, someone should cut me a check too.  My mortgage... the one I got at a reasonable rate for an amount I could afford... is now paid in full.  My home, however, is not valued the same as it was when I bought it.  Should the bank give me a check for the difference because my victimized neighbors have defaulted on their loans and caused my home to drop in value?|`|CGr6EtRUaa	Here in Britain the banks have had billions of ￡￡￡ from the taxpayer to cushion them from the depression, while tenants are being evicted through no fault of their own because their landlords, who bought to let so they could make money, now find they can't afford the mortgage payments on the properties they rent.<br>  <br>  If I had any say in the matter I'd say the government should be helping tenants who fall foul of this injustice, instead of propping up the banks which have already made billions in profit.|`|up40wvywaa	Most people can not afford to pay for their own homes right now, besides we are to busy paying for our congress men and women's houses, vehicles, air fair,all of their insurance packages including  health , expensive foods and parties, and their raises...I also believe that they hide some of the tax money they receive from workers to pay for their campaigning, or to support their Presidential choice.|`|93HyAM60aa	I'm not going to.

Personally, I think the lending institutions should have to eat that loss rather than the taxpayer.<br>  <br>  rrm38:  Same here.  It isn't my logic.  Its what they're going to do whether we like it or not.  This time period reminds me of the 80's when there were thousands, maybe millions, of homeless.

ybLErb9caa	For the ones who aren't concerned about race,he's their guy.For the ones who are,you can expect comments that were made about Obama to be made about Jindal. For the ones who aren't concerned about race but are dirty,they will use the same Rovian tactics that John McCain went through in 2000 and ultimately used some of those in 2008<br>  <br>  I don't see centrists like him though if they are concerned with social issues.He's the smarter version of Palin,but when it comes to social issues like abortion,they're exactly the same.He's book smart,but I don't how any person with an ounce of common sense can be a social Conservative|`|2a9MLpZRaa	Oh I agree, especially since he's the only other Republican leader I'm familiar with and I've seen him on the TV, DUHHHHHHH.|`|Ebqz6NhXaa	the conservatives would never run a sand ****** or anyone close to a sand ******  for the pres. keep dreaming conservatives. and yes i am quite black...quite proud of it too. i love being chocolate. when will it be easter for i a m chocolate!|`|YHmr7nvsaa	It doesn't matter who runs, Obama is a lock for 2012.|`|68d5b7f672196c4474ae9e60bdf04328aa	I think the Republicans are looking for an Obama like candidate in the Republican party and they are looking at Jindal for the wrong reasons.  No one really knows how good he is he really hasn't been tested.  That Hurricane you are talking can't even be compared to Katrina.  It was mostly a storm.  Jindal has a Hindu background but I am sure they won't bring that up because he doesn't have a Muslim Background.  People seem to go ape over anyone with a Muslim background in this country which is ridiculous if you ask me.  Jindal in my opinion is an ABC wanna be.  He is playing politics by not accepting the money and that is a foolish thing to do.  Ok you might be against the so called stimulus, but if your states really needs help and you say no just to come off hard core, I call that cowardly and abrasive.  The Republicans will need the help of the second coming of Christ to win this nation back.  I don't think we as a nation is ready.  People are just getting used to the idea of Obama.  I don't think Ron Paul has a chance either. I support him, however he only appeal to a limited group and he was demonized by the media and his own Republican Party during the race.  He created a lot of attention and raised a lot of money.  I think he would be 1000 times better than a wanna be Jindal type who will not really rock the boat.  Jindal is smart I give him that.  But what really has he done in the state of Louisiana to make a big difference so far?  New Orleans is still trying to recover from Katrina while this guy is playing politics.|`|5YTkGB5yaa	Wow, it's always about race on here...*sigh*<br>  <br>  Bobby Jindal is a solid candidate to be on the ticket possibly as President or VP|`|AA11702773	I want Ron Paul because of his long, consistent and proven record, no matter who was in power.|`|mZi7R0Enaa	I am a Republican who cares not a wit about BO's race but everything about his lousy deemed-to-fail policys and I totally support Bobby Jindal because he is a true CONSERVATIVE!|`|zkovxRseaa	well its a better reality than a Sarah Palin run|`|a0ea30926acdfeb82a6d6f9ca13bcc69aa	I realize that many liberals seem to believe that there are quite a few Republicans who wouldn't vote for someone solely because of race.  There are liberals who have agreed with you on this.  However, how many conservatives on here have agreed?  Exactly how much experience "within" the Republican party do these liberals have to base their opinions on?  After 20 years in the Republican party, I have never seen anyone in my local Republican headquarters state views of not voting for someone due to their race.  Not once.<br>  <br>  It would be the same as me making sweeping judgments about the Buddhist religion without ever being a member of that religion or ever stepping foot in one of their temples.  Then if I see a person declaring themselves to be a Buddhist and ripping up the Quran, I could simply say that a significant number of Buddhists hate Islam.<br>  <br>  Yes, there are fringe groups in every political party who have racist or other extremist views.  Should the entire political party be represented that way?  I don't think so.  Is there a small minority of Republicans that are racist?  Yes.  Is there a small amount of Democrats that are racist?  Yes.  Is the number of racist voters in either party large enough to significantly change an election?  No.<br>  <br>  As far as the stimulus money, I'm guessing that you haven't read the article about Jindal's stance on it.<br>  <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/politico/20090220/pl_politico/19092">http://news.yahoo.com/s/politico/2009022...</a><br>  <br>  As you can see, Jindal is not refusing all of the stimulus money.  He is refusing the stimulus money for unemployment.  <br>  <br>  In this article, it is said that he has reaffirmed his acceptance of the transportation funds included in the bill to fund shovel-ready transportation priorities in the state.<br>  <a href="http://politics.theatlantic.com/2009/02/jindals_stimulus_stand_wont_take_unemployment_benefits_from_fed.php" rel="nofollow">http://politics.theatlantic.com/2009/02/...</a><br>  <br>  If you have a link where it shows that he has refused money for projects like rebuilding roads, levees and bridges, please post it.  I would be very interested in reading it.  I will easily admit that I could be wrong but I would like some kind of proof that he has actually said that he has refused these things.  I'm sure that you understand.|`|b88afc0dddc3aea6958a0772f8b3c5b3aa	There are too many racist in the republican party for Jindal to have a realistic chance.  Racists are not like most republicans that will hold their nose and cast their vote for the party nominee when they don't approve of their party candidate.  Racists would have no problem voting for the Communist party candidate if he was the only white candidate running.<br>  <br>  Dr. Paul would be their best bet but I doubt that he will even run in 2012 because he will be 77 years old at the time of the 2012 election.
teKeLxX2aa	Well, I can tell from your question and the paragraphs that followed, that you are an intelligent person who wants to get a thoughtful response from the Yahoo! Community. It isn't everyday that I actually come across someone who is grammatically literate and able to separate their thoughts into separate paragraphs, which is actually sad considering how much time the average American spends on the computer.<br>  <br>  Yes, the social upheaval and raging political differences you find on Y! are entirely reflective of the times and society we live in. <br>  <br>  Intelligent responses or post will be few and far between, as you will find in many college classrooms around the country due to the poor general education system prior to. The common courtesy's lacking by soccer moms is a combination of a factors as well, somewhere along the line it became socially acceptable to lax social courtesy standards, kids used to get smacked for not addressing an adult by 'sir' or 'Mam'. Not that I'm advocating parents physically disciplining their children, but its because of a society that has placed less emphasis on respect that it's lacking thereof is so apparent in modern society. <br>  <br>  Our society's intelligence quotient has gone up several points over the last several decades, but this is non-reflective of the deterioration of common sense and political literacy. Given that neither one can be accurately measured by any objective standpoint, but it should be quite obvious to someone of relative intelligence that whatever goes out in the media, the public consensus that follows usually isn't too far off. People don't even realize that they are being played like a ballet, left and right wing media is tearing ideological and political difference between both sides, ripping the nation in the process. The social turmoil is only adding to the economic problem, as you now have a majority of Americans who are in no way supportive of their elected leader (quite in contrast to Bush following 9/11, with an 89% approval rating at one point) and are taking advice from political correspondents who only wish to make things worse (like media scumbag Glenn Beck). <br>  <br>  These are turbulent times, but they are inevitable as history has shown. It is nice though to see someone that isn't a stereotypical right or left wing nut job. As you seem to find a way to do your job with dignity on a weekly basis, so should all Americans learn to put their differences aside to work towards the common goal of moving our nation forward, even though social unity may be difficult in times such as these.|`|PHpKo5hZaa	More important than good manners is tolerance.

If you took on too much debt it's the bank's fault, and the taxpayer's responsibility. Trip on a paving slab? Well that's not your fault for being an idiot and a lesson in looking where you're going, it's the city's fault for not having instant repair squads descending from helicopters.<br>  <br>  So to answer you, a lack of personal responsibility.|`|2a9MLpZRaa	Let me tell you a little about myself.  See I am regarded as a fairly smart individual, though through years of college I never managed to graduate.  The only reason I keep coming to as to why is because I either didn't realize what was expected of me in given situations or I just didn't feel like doing it.  Sure it helps to stick to your ideals, but for how much easier my life could have been afterwards, you'd think I would've been willing to just go with that.  Anyway, to me it sounds like you're suffering from unrealistic expectations of the people you serve, and that is hurting you emotionally.  First, dealing with their children you're going to have to understand the adults and your place in relation to them.  They get what they want, most all the time.  You are their dog, period.  I know it sounds harsh but that is the way of the world right now, people make money and pay people to take their ****, and complain about politics.  Also, I think that you being the smart guy you are you would realize how easy things can be or how hard they can be if you do or don't play your role.  So ask yourself, is it really so hard to talk to them about stamps or whatever stupid bullsh**  they have on their mind??  Is it really worth being jobless in todays market because you can't stand their brats?  You'll just have to understand that while if the character and values your parents instilled in you at a young age were an advantage (virtues of hard work, saving money, honesty, courtesy towards others), that maybe they didn't get those advantages.  We all come from different places to get where we are when we meet.|`|IwCir7zIaa	I completely agree, I think many of these self centered types have no respect for anyone behind a counter.

I used to work in a wine shop and right in the middle of talking to a customer, their phone would ring and without as much as an 'excuse me' they would answer their phone and turn away.

93HyAM60aa	Because being self-sufficient and responsible for one's own affairs and the security and well being of those he loves has its own reward. If you rely upon others to provide for your needs in life, they also have control over you in one way or another, which is the only reason that they will shell out the money to begin with - to buy you.<br>  <br>  By the way, your chances of ever being a billionaire are less than the odds you presented because you invest your efforts into class envy rather than improving yourself so that you have something people are willing to pay for in terms of abilities, products, or services. When free enterprise becomes so encumbered by redistribution of wealth that the incentive to perform is eliminated, who will then even bother trying? It is true that we are already well on our way to such an outcome, and the final nails are being driven in that coffin as we ponder such things as your 'question'. I find it disturbing that those who complain about fighting for crumbs fail to grasp that if the bakers have the entire loaf of bread taken from them as soon as it comes out of the oven, they will stop making it altogether.<br>  <br>  Edit: And if you had invested nearly as much energy into being the one providing those services - as I said - as you do in blaming them for the unfairness of your lot in life, you might have benefited in the ways that they did financially. The baker analogy was meant to give you food for thought. I should have known that you would have expected that the bread was then toasted and buttered as well, as that is the philosophy that you embrace. The point is that people have a choice in life in what they hold to be important, and despite overbearing regulations and redistribution of wealth, it is yet possible to secure money if that is your driving force. You could have been any of those 'players' you are so critical of rather than the person standing on the sidelines excoriating them with baseless resentment for their achievement.|`|AA11398340	Socialist ideals affect all income levels if you make it harder on those folks it has a downside on the most part "billionaires" drive economies and keep "regular" folks employed.

There are SERE instructors who teach the course.|`|0szdPqI0aa	Well, your conditions would be like anyone else who's enlisted.<br>  SERE just teaches those how to survive , etc.<br>  they dont sleep outside or anything.<br>  They go to work like anyone else.<br>  <br>  you would have a barracks like anyone else.<br>  <br>  but SOMETIMES you may have to be out side for a few days on a training thing or something.<br>  <br>  PS. i hope you know SERE training is one of the hardest schools to pass.|`|LwPcGpAOaa	SERE is a course.  There a people who have been in the Air Force for at least a couple of years who teach this course.  No ones job is to just live in the woods off the land for 4 yrs high speed!
FXD58zAqaa	actually the government owns a dozen or more of the same identical planes which ever one the president is using is designated as air force one it and the others all go by call numbers when the president is not on board.|`|05de70a9e49e65b10045a7155a822df7aa	she uses a private plane for traveling from states to states, and nope the air force one is for the president.|`|ExYfur9haa	no, but i am sure she uses either Air Force 2,3,4, or 5.... yea, most people dont realize that there are a few different planes|`|7dad943aeb0eea9ef53ff4446976257baa	Why do you ask? Do you want to target it Mr Laden?|`|1KGXts5Daa	Neither.<br>  <br>  Nor does she travel on a "private plane" as stated by some who have posted replies so far.<br>  <br>  Cabinet members (such as the Secretary of State) travel on an aircraft owned by the federal government and operated by the US Air Force (as is the case also with "Air Force One").<br>  <br>  The difference is that the aircraft which serve as Air Force One, for use by the President, are modified Boeing 747's.<br>  <br>  The aircraft which serve the US cabinet-level staff members are modified Boeing 757's, a much smaller (yet still large) airplane.|`|B1XT60WEaa	She uses a government plane.|`|cO9lH8f6aa	Air Force One is the call sign for whatever plane the president is on.  When the president is not on the plane that plane's call signs are different.|`|NsYIUu3caa	she uses a private plane for everywhere she has to go, and no, AF1 is solely for the president.|`|svfBYHFfaa	well whatever Hilary uses plane chopper or what she can havvvit as long as she does her mandate aint she not sexy?|`|HzP6xg1Uaa	Air Force One is exclusively for use by the President. She can get her own **** plane.
Jm3vMKx3aa	Yes, it is possible, provided that the general immigration requirements are met. Those are for the most countries for tourist or business travel<br>  ? holding sufficient funds to cover the travel<br>  ? holding an onward or return flight ticket to the next destination<br>  ? holding all required documents for the next destination<br>  <br>  You have even left out countries to which Brazilian citizens may travel as tourists without a visa; those are: Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, Bermuda, Botswana, Dominica, El Salvador, Fiji, Haiti, Jamaica, Maldives, Nicaragua, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Vincent & the Grenades, Seychelles, Singapore, United Kingdom, Venezuela, Virgin Islands (UK part)<br>  <br>  <br>  Source(s):<br>  <a href="http://www.klm.com/travel/ch_en/travel_information/travel_planning/travel_clinic/visaform.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.klm.com/travel/ch_en/travel_i...</a>|`|cuFePknIaa	<a href="http://guideforu.kaohsiung.tv" rel="nofollow">http://guideforu.kaohsiung.tv</a><br>  A very informative website you can also get much information in website
2YLjd9uSaa	You are not allowed to work off-campus without an EAD card. Self-employment is employment. If you qualified for an EAD card, you are allowed to accept employment, even with your business because a company is a separate entity from its employees, but you cannot work more than 20 hours a week.<br>  <br>  Your best bet would be to open a restaurant and not be involved in its day to day operation, i.e., don't prepare the food, don't operate the cash register, don't mop the floor, etc. Just oversee its operation, and let the employees run the day to day activities. Hire a manager. It would be more like an investment than employment that way.<br>  <br>  The license question is not an immigration question.|`|ICeSfYSzaa	I'm seriously wondering the same thing! Except, in my case, I have a few people working with me, and we're opening the bakery in England<br>  Moving on, I think as long as you've got a work permit, and you can afford it, there're no objections.|`|AA10045620	No, you cannot.  On a student visa you are not allowed to work for anyone/any place but part time for the college you are attending.
iryMpZYwaa	He faces a ban.  Your best option seems to be for you to move to his country to be with him, feel free to take the rest of his illegal family with you!|`|AA10045620	You can do nothing but join him in his own country.  You might also suggest the rest of his illegal alien family join him there to keep him company.      He faces at least a ten year ban from entering the USA, if not more.|`|WBwlKbLeaa	Nope, marrying does not make much a difference. I imagine he just needs to get back in line and do things the proper way instead of feeling extra special. I am curious as to why having a pine tree on his rearview mirror would be cause to get pulled over.....|`|CpTQagJOaa	He will have the 10 year ban. You can apply for hardship, but it probably won't do much good.|`|AA11966821	Both the possession & the use of a false, forged, or stolen instrument or identification are major felonies.  Entry without inspection is likewise a felony.  He is barred from reentry for at least 10 years, and more likely permanently due to possessing and using the forged/stolen green card.  If you want to marry a multiple felon, go to his country and stay there.  He isn't coming back, so don't waste your money trying.|`|AA10925759	He was deported so nothing can be done. Something can be done if you are willing to spend tens of thousands, time, effort and wait for years. The fake card assures this.     You will never see him again. If he comes back illegally he will go to jail or never be able to adjust his status.     The police do not pull people over for just a pine tree.|`|GMJCjMqmaa	I believe that is a ten year ban for Illegal port of entry, and if he gave him a fake green card, there could be other charges pending. I would ask a lawyer if their are any options after the ban, which is ten years.|`|XRYAfxpTaa	He was in possession of a fake green card as well as being here illegally.  He is under at least a 10 year ban from the US. You could join him, marry him and petition for him, however, it is difficult to get a waiver. Hardship would have to be proven and still may not offset immigration fraud.|`|N7xDpSQxaa	10 year BAN.  Tell him to come back for the rest of his family.    Those Pine Trees will get you every time.|`|ZXkOQapLaa	He should've been JAILED then deported. Fake green cards are a federal offense. Forget him he'll never be able to get here legally and why waste your time on a criminal.|`|hbmZqhscaa	doing it legally will be really hard for him.  he could try to do it the illegal way again but i hear they are increasing border patrol so tell him to be careful.|`|LX6AQ4kuaa	Once he got deported, not much can be done. Not only was he illegal but he also had a fake green card. That's a felony. So your bf did not get deported "solely" for the reason that he was illegal.|`|pHmKGLMoaa	Well tough.  Maybe he should try coming here legally for a change.  Go through the process and quit playing the sob story card.|`|sIvUjRT3aa	Like everyone else said, he is now banned from entering the US legally for 10 years.  Your best option is either...    A) Find a new boyfriend, one that is legally in the US.    B) Move to whatever country he got deported to, good luck if that is Mexico since they aren't exactly as "welcoming" to immigration as we are.  Recommend his illegal family move too.     C) run the risk of having him re-smuggled across the border.  Of course if he is ever caught again, be prepared for a lenghty prison sentence as it is a felony to re-enter the US illegally after deportation.|`|AA12186175	If he was deported to Mexico, then you're gonna need to go over there with him and maybe look for someone who can smuggle people across. My prayers to you and your family.
