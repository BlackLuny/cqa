20090220101526AAjRo2i	Environment;Green Living	School council and recycling?	I'm 14, my friend is going to be president of the school council next year and he said he's going to put me in it. He knows that I work hard. I'm always nagging him about recycling paper and wrappers from his lunch, and so he asked me to be head of his Recycling campaign next year. That means a lot to me, so I want to do well. I've been trying to come up with good things like contacting the local council for bins (we live in Portugal, by the way) and if they don't provide us with some, I'm going to buy some, I've found some for a good price. I'm going to try to persuade the principal to hold an assembly about it, and also try to put small boxes for recycling paper in every classroom. Well, I have a lot of ideas for recycling, but do you have any?      Also, I want to do well on council, so I want to provide some good ideas for the school. I've already come up with a few, but do you have any ideas?      Thanks!

I am interested in installing  these in conjunction with a Mechanical Ventilation heat recovery system, but am confused as am getting differing advice from the experts. Does anybody have either system up and running in their home?   How many collectors have you installed (and for what size house) and are they connected to your heating boiler? Are your energy costs greatly reduced?   Any information would be a help. thanks
