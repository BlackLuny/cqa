EcjfWdsbaa	The day after Thanksgiving. What many consider the busiest shopping day in the US, as its the start of Christmas/holiday shopping. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Friday_(shopping)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Frida...</a>|`|myw1SEgzaa	Well, in accounting terms, being in the "red" is being in the negative.  But being in the black means that you are in the positive.  Black is referring to the businesses being in the black that day and turning a profit because it's the busiest day of the year for them The friday is the biggest shopping day of the year.....the day after thanksgiving.  So you have black friday.|`|0b88d85db15d5417f0727131d571b402aa	black friday is the friday after thanksgiving. its the beginning of the christmas season and it is when all the stores have HUGE sales. Its great to go shopping then , but everywhere is super pack. lots of people go at 5, 6 o' clock in the morning. it is crazy.  |`|WM8QRcdMaa	it's the day after thanksgiving...there are crazy sales in all the big stores and some people go out at 4 in the morning to shop!! as to why its called black friday, i really dont know lol.|`|7DIc5PN6aa	Black Friday is the day after Thanksgiving where all the stores have everything for really really good prices.

The official start of the Holiday shopping season.|`|GLJkGgloaa	The day after Thanksgiving is called black Friday where people go shop at 3am in the morning...It's also the time you will meet the Meanest and Rudest people on the face of the Planet!!|`|e43LESCPaa	In the USA  the Black FRiday  they called  ,friday after  'Thanksgiving'-then lots  store have  good deal to buy so many things for Christmas.Most this deal is just from 6am-to 11;00  am  .People stand all nights on the line to be first in line  to got real good deal.
e20e778807f334f6575085b3abdf95fcaa	I feel quite the opposite. <br>  When words for God are overused, people become numb to it and the effectiveness is lost. Listening only to songs about God deadens the effect of something that is supposed to be profound.<br>  Also, God has made so many wonderful things in the world, such as relationships, feelings, etc. There's nothing wrong with singing about the wonderful things God has given us. It shouldn't have to be pushed in our faces that God made them. Overkill only kills the message of God, and that is a sin. <br>  <br>  |`|4OjLMQ6Yaa	I never heard that it was a sin to listen to secular music. Man you are really stuck on this. And yet it seems so simple to answer.|`|da807e7e17ab4dd2a5d678db7a393207aa	It sounds to me like just being alive is a sin to your friends, maybe you should find new ones.|`|tpDICzslaa	Is it a sin to read the Song of Solomon? That doesn't directly mention God either, but it's still part of the Bible.|`|8tF9Py9Daa	Of course it isn't.  The idea!|`|Um79JB1naa	That is nonsense. In a sense, music does glorify God because he created it. <br>  <br>  Music that glorifies idiocy and sin is displeasing to God. Otherwise, consider it "good" music. <br>  <br>  You need to read your bible and go to church to understand what is sin, and what is not sin. There are many things to enjoy that are not part of the church, but are acceptable. If someone is telling you nonsense about sin, stop listening to them. |`|jJTGKkSuaa	no. just because the song doesn't mention God doesn't mean its a sin. you can listen to whatever music you want. God understands that you don't want to listen to glorifying music. just don't listen to satanic music. |`|zKOZ8Gafaa	No it's not a sin.  However, I have been watching the John Todd (illuminati videos) and he was #1 at Zodiac Production who produced Rock Music for the purpose of satanism.<br>  <br>  Google John Todd Illuminati or illuminatist|`|W1FagZlyaa	its not a sin to listen to nonchristian/nonreligious music as long as the lyrics dont dishonor God (by talkin about bad stuff that go completely against God)|`|OxuLUCX9aa	Atma -Halls of Amenti<br>  Lost Children of Babylon- Pillars of Enoch<br>  Razah- Razah's Rubiks cube|`|PySJVGcNaa	Pink Floyd mentions God all the time. <br>  <br>  Jesus, Jesus, what's it all about?|`|1e7d56a3860040de885ccc1c5e24acf7aa	No...|`|If0vYA1qaa	nope|`|530418510999e8769b7600cca03808faaa	I don't think it is a sin.<br>  <br>  You could ask the same about reading material. In that case, the Book of Esther in the Bible doesn't mention God. However, the book indirectly speaks to God's providence in the lives of the Jews.<br>  <br>  This doesn't mean however that you can listen/watch/read anything though and assume it isn't a sin. I'm only saying that the absence of God's name in media doesn't make it wrong to read/watch.<br>  <br>  <br>  |`|AA11937917	any god worth bothering with would not be a narcissistic megalomaniac in need of a constant stream of sycophanticism merely for its own sake.<br>  <br>  as plenty of music (religious or not) lacks lyrics, I do not see how it could even be an issue.|`|xRAkOW3Taa	It is not sin at all. You should go to church if you feel you need to listen to God more. Just because it does not mention their name it is definitely not a sin. It's not in the 7 sins is it?(rhetorical)|`|tBlLxH5Kaa	No it's not a sin. |`|WNWKDw4uaa	Yes - if you listen to Chopin or Beethoven you are going to hell.
UHTcpdkVaa	I'm an atheist, but I understand why some people are religious.  It DOES something for them.  I don't understand WHAT it does for them exactly, but somehow it makes them feel better about their life.<br>  <br>  This is an insubstantial, but real effect that can't be discounted.  You have to admit, that if you make the assumption that everything happens for a reason, you will accept bad things that happen with more grace.  If you accept that good people go to heaven, you feel better when your grandmother dies.  If you accept that Jesus loves you, you don't feel as lonely.  These are real effects of religion - it provides you with a sense of perspective and belonging that while I may disagree with wholeheartedly, I still can see the utility of.<br>  <br>  Science is a cold source of comfort for those who do not take the time to test the finding themselves, or to derive the philosophy inherent in them.  All of us take some findings of science on belief - how many of you have actually tested the time dilation demanded by General Relativity, or acquired a vacuum chamber to test the universal speed of falling objects?  Some have!  But most likely it wasn't you.<br>  <br>  Truly understanding scientific perspective requires a great deal of time and effort and money.  We all go to school for 12 years learning rudimentary science; most spend an hour on Sunday learning religion.  After 12 years, most people still can't tell me where lightning comes from - and hearing that gravity is not fully understood means that some will inevitably discern that science doesn't know - without accepting the "yet" part.<br>  <br>  One of the primary reasons for people becoming atheist (at least for me, I cannot speak for others) is the historical examples of atrocity committed in the name of God.  I'm sure you can name off of the top of your head dozens of examples of men who used religious influence to cause death and destruction against the human race.  You may not be able to name a single good religious figure.  The same exists in the opposite side.  They may know about the tortures of the Inquisition, but they also know when Pastor Bob brought the family dinner when Mom died - but they know that Stalin was atheist.<br>  <br>  Kindness and goodwill exist in religious communities, just as it exists outside of religious communities.  Life will be much better when we all realize that.<br>  <br>  Finally, there is a very good point made about believing the entirety of the Bible, or Koran, of Torah, etc.  We all know that VERY few Christians believe ALL of it - just as we know that VERY few Muslims think that 72 virgins await them after having killed a bunch of kids as a disco.  Just as Christians would be comforted if "mainstream" Islam announced what they as a group truly believe and practice, so would atheists be comforted by a "mainstream" Christian declaration of what that believed and did not believe.  For no matter what we believe in, we all want the other side to be rational and somewhat predictable.|`|1e7d56a3860040de885ccc1c5e24acf7aa	1. You are atheist so I'm assuming you've never been religious before and don't know what it's like based on all the questions you're asking.<br>  2. I don't believe all science I hear is true.<br>  3. We have faith.<br>  4. My reasons are because I choose to believe.<br>  5. Yes and no. Yes to some things, no to others.<br>  6. Many people wrote the Bible. I don't base my whole life on it, just most of it.|`|mFy3M8mVaa	Christianity isn't the only religion. My religion doesn't have an ancient book. I do accept everything that science can teach us. I was attracted to my religion because it fits my philosophies and makes sense to me.<br>  Open your mind a bit and stop generalizing.|`|vDr5aROwaa	I am not religious. I am a Christian.|`|fNw4wJSGaa	Well, let's be clear.<br>  <br>  Not everyone who is religious is one of the major 3 faiths that your referring to. There are tons of other religions and philosophies.<br>  <br>  I'm not a believer, but I don't think those who have faith are dumb. Nor do I think they are all wasting their time. If they found something that keeps them inspired to be the best person they can be, then that's wonderful.<br>  <br>  Some people need that kind of direction to feel happy. Others don't.<br>  <br>  It's only bad when you have those who take their beliefs too far and start condemning others, or try to inflict their morals on the rest of society. Attempting to block the rest of us from pursuing what we think is right for us.<br>  <br>  We aren't all the same. We all have reasons to believe or to not believe. I wish people could just learn to agree to disagree, and gain a live-and-let-live attitude toward others.|`|W1FagZlyaa	im not too big on "religion". i am a Bible-believing Jesus-loving God-follower and the most important thing in my life is my relationship with Jesus Christ. there is so much proof that shows what the bible says is true. archeological, scientific, geographic, historical proof that it is true. i could go on and on forever prooving that the bible is true. i will if you want me to! the bible has never been proved wrong, either.|`|pfNnuD5saa	I do believe in science and facts. I have loved science all my life. I also know God exists!  Religion is not just what "someone teaches you". It is a journey to find out what you believe. |`|UgBBdmclaa	Religion has been around forever, isn't that enough proof to believe in it?..<br>  ever since Jesus died on the cross people have been having Faith in God.|`|RqC1s733aa	It's "atheist".<br>  <br>  You label yourself with a word that you can't even spell?|`|tvSgx9Ogaa	They have hope for better times and justice|`|eAMq1iBWaa	it's called faith - give it a try sometimes<br>  <br>  BTW - at least learn to spell what you are <br>  <br>  it's "atheist"<br>  <br>  ;-)|`|D9lMg7A2aa	NO, you have that all wrong<br>  -- I'm an athiest BECAUSE I don't get why people are religous?<br>

If you are really crafty, you can even make a sculpture out of old metal pieces.  But take a look around and see what you have.  I found some fronts of old speakers.  They have wood frames and the black cloth inside, like a matting.  I got some black and white photos of Venice and matted them on the "frames."  Hung those in the family room and they look wonderful.<br>  <br>  Another thing I do is get old magazines and cut out things I like.  I took an old enamel pot with lid and decoupaged a laundry ad from the 1940s.  It shows a woman with a laundry cart and it says How to be a Lazy Days Housekeeper.  I thought that was funny so I used that to make a laundry soap container out of the pot.  I attached a scoop I found at a thrift store.<br>  <br>  I have cut out other funny sayings and made a collage for my friends' bathroom.  But I have made 100s of things using decoupage or other craft items. Another one is to get a terra cotta planter and using a brush and white glue, just brush the glue over pictures and sayings on the outside of the pot.  Then varnish it when it's dry.  People love those planters as gifts.<br>  <br>  It really made me start looking how anything can be used before I get rid of it.  I found that I don't need to throw much away because most everything can be made into something else.|`|FkGh0LuWaa	Make them gifts using recycled materials.
1rxYT4V7aa	I apologize, but I don't quite understand the question. What exactly does my faith have to do with biological taxonomy? Humans are of the species homo sapiens which includes hominims  like  homo erectus and other predecesors to modern man, not apes as you bluntly chose to put it. If you are attempting to insinuate by this question that all subscribers to a religous faith are unwilling to accept the concepts of biology and evolution, then I must call you on your clear neglect of the truth that lies squarely in front of you.|`|f3nwI8ytaa	Not to be too nit-picky, Desi, but the list you cite is based on convention.

Gotta watch him in this clip: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_OmnP527Dw" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_OmnP527...</a> lol :-)|`|boipPoVJaa	I hate the british humour but have never heard scottish humour so I dont know about that...|`|GokGEXfiaa	me and my mate were taking the p*ss out this yanky and he just didnt get it. he thought we were being "chummy old chap" with him of something, i dont know, but he didnt get it.<br>  <br>  we asked him if he knew if we were "taking the piss" and he kept repeating it..."what, what...taking the p*ss...what"....so anyway, one of us replied "yes, we were taking the p*ss out of you"....to which the yank, totally confused, replied (i will forever remember this and laugh) "what, you mean you just extracted it right out of me"??????<br>  <br>  we couldnt stop laughing.<br>  <br>  he still didnt get the whole situation<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT......<br>  <br>  i love the replies......|`|CBKjEvp5aa	Well I've never heard Scottish humor and I don't know how well I could relate or understand. As far as British humor, probably my favorite form of humor. Love it to death. One of my favorite shows is Monty Python and the Flying Circus.|`|PPyMhRJAaa	I am Scottish and think we have a great sense of humour. I love Still Game, Billy Connelly, Jerry Sadowitz, Rab C.Nesbitt etc.|`|weBvwrloaa	if you are a fan of Monty Pythons flying circus you have to understand it, which i am...|`|jItNwbpQaa	I'm not familiar with a lot of Scottish humor, but mainstream British humor as portrayed in some television shows like Monty Python, the Office (UK version), As Time Goes By and One Foot in the Grave makes me roar with laughter. I think it has something to do with the use of the absurd (especially in Python) and also with the way the English use the language. The words they choose to express themselves in funny situations are often more precise...or something like that. I've never been able to put my finger on it, but I really love it.|`|7ZqSiZqUaa	the first time I heard Billy Connolly I honestly thought he was speaking a different language!  mind you, that was before his accent got smoothed out by becomeing more widely windswept and interesting.<br>  <br>  i'm a Brit, btw, does that count?|`|RyQ1AsO9aa	Try watching an Irish movie that will blow your mind our sense of humour is kind of out there<br>  <br>  Try Man about dog that an amazing film|`|3CBWubtAaa	there are a lot of Scottish jokes about being cheap
kiihLiLvaa	Just tell them, that u r not ready to have kids, becuz u wana achieve or u wana have a career. I dont think so people should not have nay problem about your decision. Its your life and people wont take care of your kids if they r in the problem... so u know better wt is good for u and bad. and about your friend, but she is just dumb...|`|XwyUATsKaa	I understand how you feel.  But, you will grow more as a person as you get older.  Your views will change.  That does not mean that you will grow to like children, and that is OK.  You don't have to like kids, I didn't until my early twenties!!!  I didn't have the best childhood either, but I met someone who I know will want to create a good life for the children we will have.<br>  <br>  Bottom line: It's OK to feel the way you do. You are certainly not evil.  Try to explore some of the issues with the abuse in your family.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|ENzHIUdOaa	you shouldn't tell anyone that abuse runs in your family, or the authorities will have a special file on you, and will be keeping their eye on  you.<br>  <br>  BUt, anyways, who cares what other people think about that.  You can have whatever attitude you want.|`|Y6odIQgJaa	You're obviously a lot more mature than your "friends."<br>  <br>  Parenting isn't for everyone, and I respect you for saying so.|`|98GbovYTaa	i think your friend is evil for having kids..life can be crappy and the only happy people are stupid people|`|vYAgIMLdaa	You can't make others change their attitudes any more than they can change yours. I have never been a "child person" and have met with hostility from parents with 11 kids and bleeding hearts alike. Shrug it off. To each his own.|`|s6GKHKccaa	Cut out the people who judge you, and only hang around people who respect you. You can't fix ignorance, and those people who judge you suffer from an epidemic known as stupidity.|`|4FQrXiylaa	if it worries you so much just dont tell people|`|a345d4c25e6c992f96ca13e532e7b002aa	i don't think your friend should call you evil just because you don't want to have kids or work with them.  that is your decision for your life and she should respect it.  as long as you aren't rude to kids or mistreat them, then your dislike isn't really a big deal.  <br>  <br>  tell her that it really bothers you when she says that.  to you it isn't a joke.  try to explain how you feel.  even if she doesn't agree, the two of you can at least come to understand each other.<br>  <br>  to each his own
z8Euv8xKaa	This one.  It is the safer question that does not reveal which side you are on
oQnlIr88aa	We definitly need more curvy white actresses because the image that is sent out to women every where is that only women who are really skinny are beautiful.  When really that body type is not common at all, rather quite rare.  We need to do something about it because it is creating body image issuse in every womens life no matter how big or how small.|`|s6GKHKccaa	Absolutely! There are beautiful curvy White women just as there are beautiful curvy Black women.<br>  <br>  I think the media should teach society to embrace true beauty, and not unrealistic standards that cause young women to impose harm on themselves.|`|CBKjEvp5aa	Back in the 40's and 50's curvy white women dominated the silver screen. I really wish that they would bring real women back to the public eye and not these pencils that they show nowadays.|`|RMsHTePVaa	I don't understand why Hollywood wants grown @SS women to be pencil thin walking around looking like preteen boys. It's not cute they should have people who look realistic like Alicia Keys or how Marilyn Ma roe looked back in the day. Not skinny or Obese.   If they stop over paying these actors maybe they can afford to get normal weight actors. I believe the reason for all the skinny actress is because Hollywood can't afford the extra fabric for their wardrobe lol...|`|ZYOJQdjyaa	Agreed, but remember Marilyn Monroe weighed 150lbs. They're out there but the modern ideal is skinny, so they have a hard time getting hired. Hollywood sells fantasy, and right now everyone's number one fantasy (at least among Caucasoids though I'm sure all races are represented in shocking amounts) is to be able to live the American Dream 4.0: eat all the greasy fast food you want and remain thin and 'beautiful.'<br>  <br>  After and during wartime when people were still on rations the image of a well-fed female was the fantasy: I've found that it often happens that way. In times of plenty it is thought more admirable to resist the temptations of sitting on some of the world's largest hoards of food: there's enough being produced right now to feed everyone on the planet, but Big Agriculture is the tool of Big Corporations and the First World is storing much of it 'just in case' of emergency. At the same time we are told to consume and it tears us apart, leaving people unable to choose.<br>  <br>  European culture has enshrined the mythic ideal of the delicate, frail woman (who can yet do all household chores and bear children with no lasting complaint), the Victorian myth that complements the Masculinity myth that holds men back from being completely human just as the female myth imprisons the woman. Conversely, traditions derived from African cultures have generally passed down the image of the well-fed woman as desirable, as she was obviously strong and healthy, fit for survival. That fitness has driven the ideals of humanity for its history entire, except when we go civilized: the physical detachment from natural processes alters our perception of fitness, leaving it vulnerable to perversion by corporate interests. If people were happy, they wouldn't be able to sell us so many cures. <br>  <br>  It would be nice if the selection of actresses actually reflected the variation present in females of all races, but you are correct in noticing that Caucasoid females seem disproportionately pressured to be artificially attenuated without regard for their health. The sickest thing is that a lot of actresses started healthy and then were pressured after they had become 'stars' to get thinner.<br>  <br>  Ballerinas weren't always anorectic either - that too, is a newer development. Watch some older versions of the Nutcracker and Swan Lake, or the Rite of Spring, or even just the huge high budget musical spectaculars of the 1940's/1950's, you might see some surprising things. They are often available on DVD or VHS.
VgfUAleGaa	I never actually thought of that. Kudos to you, LHOOQ. You win 1,000 internets.|`|daf653722b9a000bcaed6ea65b1dc5e6aa	That was a smart question, although not something I haven't heard before.<br>  <br>  He gave man the ownership of His creation and man gave it up to Satan. <br>  <br>  When you bring in Matt 4:8 into context, By saying that he (Satan) could give Jesus all dominion he was implying that he had all power over earth.<br>  <br>  What all of it means is that for God to be able to work His way on earth, he'd need man to "cooperate" -- free will. Which means, as long as Satan has dominion over earth, he will continue to wreck havoc.<br>  <br>  So, how does that gel in with your original question? Well, the only way God could get humanity and everything else on earth to survive was to get man to gather them two by two.<br>  <br>  Of course, He did not forget -- He never does.|`|5ifHSNSraa	He specifically stated after the flood humans and animals are allowed to eat meat.<br>  <br>  Why didn't he just create some more..because he didn't want to?|`|zfUpf50paa	I think it was a cover and he just want some males around to arouse his animal interests so to speak .|`|TYstsM7Yaa	lol good one.

Billy Graham was the most popular show on TV.  <br>  <br>  Today we have digital cable/Satellite TV with over 500 stations and too many perverted stations, polluting the minds of Americans.  Every home has 2-3 computers (not counting laptops).  People have IPODS and mp3 players hardwired to their skulls.  Most kids are addicted to cell phones by age 8.  You are considered a terrible person if you do disapprove of homosexuality.  Kids in schools who make a poster with the American flag and the National Motto "In God We Trust" get the poster sensored and receive a bad grade.  We are more concerned with who wins the American Idol, Bachelor, or Survivor than the lives of the men and women fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan.  <br>  <br>  More and more people are getting caught in the corrupt society we live and less involved in serving God.  We had to compete with "Guitar Hero" on our Christian youth trip last summer.  Instead of Bible studies the adults leaders let the kids play Guitar Hero.|`|xUXpfKyIaa	I think it's great.  <br>  <br>  We need more Sarah Paln's, Mike Huckabee's, Kent Hovind's, and Ted Haggard's.

It's making their hands all greasy.|`|zTuc5eDIaa	"dropping religion" is a bit misleading, don't you think?<br>  <br>  The percentage of respondents who claimed "no religion" increased just 0.8% in 8 years, according to the study you cited. I'd hardly consider that a sudden decline.<br>  <br>  The one conclusion that we CAN derive from that survey is that the religious composition of the US is changing rapidly. Catholics are gaining numbers because of the massive influx of Hispanic immigrants, and Protestants are losing popularity, probably because of low birth rates (since 1990).|`|gf3CCvuUaa	(gasp)<br>  <br>  But no surprise, it is America after all.

WJGsHFRAaa	there are many irish beliefs in werewolves. now I don't know if this is true but, some of the irish people believed that they were decsended from wolves. I know this sounds like twilight but my dad and granfather have told me the same thing. They also believed that if you were desended from a wolf you can either take on that form or have wolf instings.|`|pKAIgPWcaa	Every culture has their own version of werewolves in general.  You just have to look.

This seems to be a more modern invention, perhaps a few hundred years old.<br>  <br>   People is Irish myths could assume the shape of an animal or bird, which was a way of saying that this human was really a deity, but wolves do not spring to mind; mainly swans, ravens, cow, horse or dog, which is like a wolf.|`|BT4KgOobaa	Most of the werewolves ive heard about were Scottish, not Irish. but I have heard of a few. search the old Celtic tales. i seem to remember something about a Clan somewhere near Tara.

rCNRcF5waa	Hi! (Waves) I'm Mpcotk's wife. (He wanted me to say that.) And I just wanted to say that I don't think black nail polish is bad AT ALL. Even as a solid black color. Trust me I feel your pain. I didn't grow up a JW but even then I still had people ask me if I was goth. It was pretty ridiculous since I had pink hair most of my teenage years. (Rolls eyes) Anyway I just wanted you to know that black nail polish is perfectly fine. I can understand why your mother doesn't like it. Most parents don't. JW or not. What I did to stop the slew of "you're goth" attacks and to stop my grandparents from thinking I was suicidal, was what the above people said. I used black with a hint of another color, or I made my nails one black one white and so on. It was fun and cute. At one point they even had a black nail polish that would crackle on your fingernails and leave this awesome pattern behind. They don't make it anymore but Sally Hansen now makes awesome nail polish pens that you can use like markers to draw on your nails. It's pretty awesome. Don't feel bad, I'm 22 and I still paint my nails a bajillion different colors. I even have black in my collection. :D<br>  <br>  Here's a link for you<br>  <a href="http://www.sallyhansen.com/product.cfm?product=374" rel="nofollow">http://www.sallyhansen.com/product.cfm?p...</a>|`|hT7BhNamaa	Ahhhh Cassidy, we have gone from hair styles to nail polish now lol. From what I understand from your type of grasp of the English language, I really can't see a problem with black nail polish, trust me I have seen worse.<br>  <br>  Even though this is not my line for answers, I am sorry but, where do the Jehovah's Witnesses fit in with all of this? If your family are Witnesses, my belief with any religion or faith. They are there for your Soul, not your fashion aspirations.<br>  <br>  <br>  Chris|`|hZjPYyFTaa	Can you get a way with a black red - a colour that was popularized by Chanel 15 years ago? It's fashion and not spooky.|`|UmjJmYsjaa	Black isnt bad, but it might be the way you're doing it.<br>  <br>  Is it completly Black?<br>  <br>  Well Black, and White match real good with other colors.<br>  <br>  Well since you're 13, it is wise to obey your parents (Eph 6:1-3)<br>  <br>  Try mixing the colors around. You must have other nail polish that'll mix well with black.<br>  Trust me i like Black suits, but throwing in color really changes things around a bit. Try something else. Why does it ONLY have to be that color, really?<br>  <br>  PS: Just give it time, ignore it for right now. Black isnt bad, but just give it time.|`|9xwhzf6Eaa	Goth JW?  I don't think so.|`|XIIGr5f2aa	what's so bad about black nail polish? i am not a witness, btw.|`|2pbiwYRtaa	Jehovah is a balanced God, we can even assume that the Israelites wore makeup, however black make up was often associated with nations that worshipped false gods. For example in ancient egypt a substance called Kohl was used  around the eyes. The israelites would not have worn the same, otherwise they too would have been recognised as an Egyptian by others, EVEN if they denied being one.<br>  So do you see? Even if you know you are not an emo or goth, its what others see that is important. Although there is no scripture saying you cannot, it is a conscience thing, yes, but we do not want to be a reason to stumble anyone. Rom 12:2 tells us to "quit being fashioned after this system of things". Perhaps there are a few points for you to think about.|`|FTGoA0E0aa	HA HA<br>  same here!!! I guess that it is a consience wise thing but i don't think that it is wrong,just really cute.Maybe you can try a nail polish that is like black with a hint of something.<br>  <br>  Like my mom saw how i really wanted black nail polish so she bought me one that is black with a hint of green..bt it looks more like black.That way your technically not wearing black lol plus its pretty in the sun.<br>  <br>  I personally love painitng my nails you should try bright neon colors!!They have lots of personality and are fun.Plus it will make your fingers pop instead of "emo,rocker" black. lol<br>  <br>  =)|`|mjGSAGHyaa	There's nothing scriptural that would deny you black nail polish. I'm not a JW, but I do know this.

The only thing we have is what we hear from people who has died and come back to life (near death experiences). They all say that when you die you either are brought to hell by demons or you are brought to heaven by angels. Again, I can't say for certain because I've never died. <br>  <br>  Despite what anyone thinks about God he is fair and loving. I speak as someone who used to be an atheist. I didn't choose God however, he chose me. I didn't try to find him, nor did I have interest in him, but here I am today a true believer in God. I haven't seen visual proof, but I have feelings and I just know that I know that I know who they are associated with. <br>  <br>  Also, God doesn't send anyone to hell. I don't know how it goes exactly, but I believe it's something like this: if you don't choose God you have chosen Satan and only God can free you from him, if you don't come to him Satan drags you to hell with him. He gives us a very easy choice to make...believe and try, or do not believe and don't try. It's honestly that easy. God does not send children to hell I know this only because children do not have the maturity to understand what it means to believe and not believe. Same rules apply to someone who has never ever heard of the gospel. God does not judge them the way he judges those who have heard but rejected him. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|ZfbFLM1Eaa	no.<br>  <br>  Matthew 19:14   But Jesus said, Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven.<br>  <br>   Hebrews 5:13   For every one that useth milk is unskilful in the word of righteousness: for he is a babe.|`|AA11336384	...don't commit suicide!<br>  <br>  I don't really know why suicide is a sin, since God really can't have a hand in anything.

Especially when the victims are children.<br>  <br>   2356 of the Catechism of the Catholic Church.<br>  <br>   " 'Rape' is the forcible violation of the sexual intimacy of another person. It does injury to justice and charity. Rape deeply wounds the respect, freedom, and physical and moral integrity to which every person has a right.

Any Catholic who endorses the murder of children through abortion or any other means separates themselves from God's family and is no longer a Catholic Christian. The Church is clear in endorsing protection of life and has never made exceptions to the right of everyone to life. This is a fundamental foundational moral teaching of the Church.<br>  <br>  The step-father being accused of rape and being probably guilty of rape is a separate issue. He has committed a sin as well as those murdering these two precious children. God is the final judge of all and he will be punished by God's justice if not by man. I am sure the secular authorities will deal with his crime as they should also prosecute those who perpetrated this double murder of children. God bless!<br>  <br>  In Christ<br>  Fr. Joseph<br>  <br>  NOTE:<br>  <br>  Only Satan can influence people not to have compassion for these two murdered children who were innocent of any crime and helpless to defend themselves.

SCJVE0gTaa	My story is a true story. This happened in I think 1953 or 55. I was a kid in those days and I have not yet experienced fear of darkness or see apparitions until that night:...I remember I was in bed in the right lateral position and the light on.  In the corner of my eye I saw something appear like a shadow in a form of a man on the foot of my bed on the left side behind. I was paralyzed with fear. It began to glide behind me until I began to feel it behind my head. Then I felt two long claws pinching me in the back of my neck. I don't know how long that thing took tormenting me by pinching and scratching until I heard my father enter our apartment coming from work and the thing vanished and I slept fitfully. The next day I was playing with my sister and my mother called me to come to her. I thought she was going to hit me for something I don't know what but it wasn't that. I came to her and she turned me around and she passed her hand on the back of my neck and I felt a soft sort of crunchy sound. She showed me her open hand with crusts of thick dried blood and some cuts and she asked me how did I get cut. I remembered and I told her that a "negrito" came up to me and did that to me. She gave me a puzzled look, but she shrugged and said nothing. But from that time all the way to 1959 when I saw apparitions and sleepless nights and then daily nightly nightmares where I saw myself in Hell and thick darkness and demons tormenting me until it began to diminish until it became no more in 1965 when I was fifteen years old.  Present time...2009 13 of Jan. I exorcised Legion from a fifteen year old girl. But this is something very serious and this is not a joke. They are very powerful entities and you have to live a righteous life plus fasting and prayer in order to get those things from a human being.|`|0lpXN8p9aa	People on here actually "think" that vampires are real......Booo|`|VZo8R0Smaa	one upon a time there was a old man. then he died<br>  <br>  THE END its so scary huh? :P|`|Oj59Qdg0aa	yes ive heard a ghost before but never seen one it was 1am and i woke up because i need to go to the bathroom i head the toilet lid slam and it made a loud sound i walked slowly to it then i saw that the toilet lid was up. true story mate no joke. i was **** scared shivering like a leaf.|`|AnEg8PTpaa	I don't know any but these websites hasve some: <a href="http://books.google.com/googlebooks/scarystories/" rel="nofollow">http://books.google.com/googlebooks/scar...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.halloweenishere.com/ghost_stories.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.halloweenishere.com/ghost_sto...</a>

It reinforces what they see in their own violent neighborhoods & gets them in deeper with the element that will land them in prison or in the graveyards.  I doubt it's going to get them on the WWE circuit.|`|KBxz1Wfyaa	My dad would watch every Saturday night when I was young.  His favorite wrestler was Dick The Bruiser.  The local 4H fair would have a night of wrestling at the pavilion and the Bruiser was usually there.  One year my dad had a couple of beers with him after the show at a local tavern.  I remember him telling me how beat up and scarred his face was.  Back in those days the wrestlers would use razor blades to cut their forehead so they would really bleed.  At least that's what dad told me.|`|Vx9wpNJKaa	Haven't watched it for a long time, but it is definitely staged.  Jesse Ventura attested to that on Larry King Live.  But they can still get terribly hurt.<br>  <br>  I kinda always liked the bad boys:  Macho Man, the Nasty Boys, the Undertaker, Jake the Snake.<br>  <br>  We had live local wrestling from a Pittsburgh, PA studio when I was a kid. Bruno Samartino and Jumpin' Johnny DeFasio, and Chief Jay Strongbow  were family favorites.  There was an old lady in the audience known as "Ringside Rosie" who would get so irrate she would jump out of her seat, run to the ringside, scream into the downed wrestlers faces and shake a rubber chicken at them!  We thought she was hilarious and my mother's fondest wish was to have her own rubber chicken.  We scoured local stores to no avail; she was SO disappointed because she was really INTO her wrestling (and teasing her grandkids).  Years later, after her death, my sister came across a fake chicken in a costume shop.  <br>  <br>  It was one of those tear-filled/laughing moments when she held it up, shook it, and said ,"I should buy this and put it on Mum's grave."|`|59Wg2cI3aa	Not into the televised rasslin shows, and actual sports wrestling I think is boring.|`|AA11229554	not any more, but my favorite years ago was George "the animal" Steel|`|AA11767291	Not any more.

That was when I learned that beauty must indeed be in the eye of the beholder. I didn't think that Gorgeous George was even a little bit cute. Wrestling was broadcast from San Antonio, Texas on Wednesday nights and we always had several of Mom's uncles and aunts over to watch wrestling. We must have been easily entertained in those years.|`|4a2eee5eefa1d6701c73d4bd94101010aa	I don't understand what the attraction is.

9GoiqfHxaa	Teenagers didn't do that much to distinguish themselves from adults. They dressed exactly like their parents as well as having the same views, music tastes and they had no distinct subculture of their own. <br>  <br>  This all changed as soon as the 50's came. Before then there was no in between of children and adults and people acknowledged that there was a transition period between the two stages of life which was where the concept of teenagers came from.|`|9ehfz3Gzaa	The concept of 'teenagers' began in the 1950's to describe the group of adolescents that were not yet adults, but too old to be children. <br>  Prior to the 1950's, adolescents were either grouped considered children, until their coming of age, usually around 16. <br>  In the last 5 years, there has been a new concept invented - "tweens", used to describe the 8-13 age bracket. It is generally considered a marketing ploy, as was the term "teens" when it was first used.|`|GZUZqazcaa	Teenagers before then were basically adults,my grandmother was married off when she was 13,had 3 children by the age of 18.When you got your first period as a lady(sorry if it's graphic for you.),you then were a woman,and women get their periods at about age 9-13.<br>  <br>  This ''teenaged''thing was recently made as you said because I guess the goverment thought it was disgusting for 12 year old young,not even fully developed girls to be married off to men in their late 20s,30s and so on.|`|m0xehTLqaa	because in the 1950's everyone skipped ahead in time, from age 12 to 20. its a great mystery|`|5qFmukWwaa	Right.  Up until 1950 you were 12 and then you turned 20 on your next birthday.<br>  <br>  Seriously, there were teenagers but before the 1940s they were probably working. By the time my grandmother was 8 she had been put to work as a maid - it was the only way her mother could be sure she would get enough food to survive.  My father-in-law quit school after the second grade because they needed his help on the farm.  My great-grandmother was barely 15 when she got married.  My mother and her twin sister took 8 years to get through high school because they would take turns working and going to school.<br>  <br>  Back in those days you hit the ground running and never had a chance to look back.|`|9580a1e44dd3d2bae7d2f867611ab353aa	? Because they had to work, get married, and have babies at that age. There weren't able to just be kids "teens", most couldn't even finish school, had to work.
46fouwFfaa	It's Somali. To tell the truth, I didn't used to think in any language. I would just think of things or ideas but I wouldn't word out my thoughts in my head. I always thought that was a peculiar thing to do. There was no language in my dreams either. Their mouths would move but I would just understand without hearing. I never thought much of it until I grew older and had a hard time communicating. I soon realized that people who worded their thoughts in their heads had an easier time of communicating their thoughts and ideas with others effectively.

Save it for the guy you marry then on your wedding night it will be the most special experience of your life.  One mistake now and your life can be altered forever.

The thing is, we are all people, and shunning a group of people just because they are a little different is simply ridiculous. There are certain people that will never learn, and we just have to do our best to ignore them. Your sexuality is a part of you, and you should be proud of it, whatever it may be; just like you should be proud of your culture or race. We should celebrate our diversity, instead of challenging it.

ahFV9rfxaa	It would have been good if you had stated their ages.  It depends on the church.  Some protestant churches like Methodist, Presbyterian, etc., do infant baptism.  Older kids and adults can still receive baptism by sprinkling in these churches.  <br>  <br>  A lot of protestant churches require believer's baptism by emersion  though.  That's following the New Testament model of all persons believing first before being baptized by being dunked under the water.  Baptism doesn't convey salvation, or even remove sins.  It's an outward expression of one's new life in Christ, to where our old lives are put behind us and we recognize our new life in Christ.<br>  <br>  In these churches they will not baptize your children unless they have accepted Christ and have been saved.  That's following the NT model of people believing first and then getting baptized.|`|ehBPus3Zaa	In my faith we have dedication ceremonies where we dedicate our babies to God, symbolically giving them back to God. We vow to raise our children in the fear and admonition of God. Teaching them the ways of God, and leading them to live their lives committed to God's service.  When they become knowledgeable of doing right or wrong, they come to the age of accountability, and they personally ask Jesus to be the Lord of their lives. To show that they have made this decision for themselves, and they confess it openly, they are given the possibility of water baptism. Not to cleanse their sin away, but to show that their sins are forgiven and they accept Jesus as their Savior.<br>  God says if you confess Jesus Christ and His grace before men, He will confess you before the Father (God). To help them grow in God, they should read their Bible everyday, and pray to God, asking Him to show them how  He would have them live a pure and holy life before the world. Glorifying God, and becoming a light unto the lost and dying world.|`|ZJ2k7Ynqaa	Christian churches have "baby dedications", not baptisms. But I have seen older children dedicated as well.  You go forward with them in a service and the pastor prays for the child and the family that God will protect them, direct their lives, etc.  It takes about 5 minutes.   Ask your pastor about it.|`|1XEUETPKaa	For babies, it would depend on the denomination of Christianity. At my my church (Evangelical), the pastor blesses the child with a white rose. At my friends church, the pastor  "baptizes" babies by dipping his hand in water and touching the child's forehead. As for children, once they grow to know and believe in Chris for their own as their personal Savoir and establish a relationship with him, then they can get baptized<br>  [in the sense of what most people would call "a normal baptism" - pastor and person-being-baptized in a tank of water.]|`|xZ1GD4zbaa	A lot of non-catholic parents have their children dedicated to the Lord; this is a public declaration that the parents will raise their children in the church.<br>  <br>  Once the child has reach the age where he/she understands they want to be saved the pastor will talk to them to see if they know what they believe and at that time will decide if he will baptize the child.<br>  <br>  The church often puts on a little ceremony at the time of the baptism and that's about it.|`|UinOWcMUaa	There are dedications -- but baptism is a choice they must make, when they become accountable.. :)<br>  <br>  Jesus was Baptized later on in life -- we follow His example :)|`|VRl1jENHaa	The Scriptures do not teach that children should be baptized.  In fact, we are told again and again that a person MUST believe the Gospel (which results in the person being "born again") and repent from sinning BEFORE they are baptized.  Children cannot do either of these things.  Therefore, they cannot be baptized.|`|Eo7KcX3Waa	You can dedicate your baby to the Lord,that means that He will take care of your baby...and you bring up the baby in the things of God.<br>  Then when the child is old enough that he wants to belong to the Lord and he asks to be saved, then he can make that commitment and be baptized...<br>  Talk to your pastor about it, he will help you with that, that is what he is there for, for spiritual advice..|`|62bdfaff99eb94891a0098fdd62fe168aa	Talk to the pastor some churches believe in Infant Baptism others do a dedication service.

I can only speak of what I understand my church (Catholic) teaches. As I understand it, after your children have past their first year, they cannot be baptized as infants. They must first be taught and understand the teachings of the lord. And despite what the haters may scream, infant baptism is biblical. <br>  Lk 18:15= people were bringing even their infants to him<br>  1Cor 1:16= I baptized the household<br>  <br>  There are many more but the most compelling is Col 2:11-12. This states that baptism has REPLACED circumcision. In the old testament, Infants were circumcised at 8 days old.<br>  <br>  Also 1 Pet 3:21= baptism now saves you|`|QxcRUl9haa	Well it depends on what type of Christian church you're in (ie Catholic, Protestant etc.). I'm really only familiar with the Protestant, it is much less formal than catholic. Baptism is important but only when the individual is ready to do so and is able to fully understand what it is they're doing, other than that there's no real major requirements :).|`|dada964081337d511df9d4bcdd176dcfaa	Talk to you pastor. <br>  <br>  Baptism with babies is kind of weird to me...like the guy with the long answer stated. Its for believers to celebrate and make public the joy they have inside. Babies don't know that yet. <br>  <br>  But often times churches have a "baby dedication" that is like a prayer for them to follow Christ and for you to set a Christ like example as a parent.|`|uAMzmAwaaa	Baptism is something that the person needs to choose for themselves to do... as far as religiously i suggest just at most take them to church with you, the last thing you want to do is force religion down their throats as that is a very good way to have them leave it when they get older.|`|d5GfhPM4aa	i think that you should baptize your kids its said that the unbaptized children who die before theyre seven and the ppl who commit suicide will stay in limbo for the rest of their lives and thats what the other sacraments are for to comfirm your faith in the church|`|FOzN3xwzaa	"Infant baptism" is unbiblical.  Don't do it. <br>  <br>  Water baptism cannot save, water baptism is not required for salvation, and water baptism cannot be added to Jesus's PERFECT salvation. <br>  <br>  Water baptism is only a celebration for the ALREADY saved. And if a person is never water baptised, they are of course still saved if they are a believer. <br>  <br>  The thief on the cross was never water baptised. <br>  <br>  Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation (John 6:39-40, 1 John 5:13). <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what! <br>  <br>  Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|nhZWAt8laa	Depending on the denomination you could have a dedication ceremony.  for the Kids but it's more of a commitment from you to raise them in God's way.|`|SzybqjFxaa	Baptizing infants or babies is a CATHOLIC tradition.  Most modern Christians wait until their kids are about 7 or 8 to be baptized, because the ceremony means nothing if the participant does'nt understand the meaning.|`|vDr5aROwaa	When your children are of accountability age and get to accept Christ as their personal Savior, then you can explain to them about getting baptized. Then tou can talk to your Pastor about your children being baptized.|`|54hVzylRaa	It is not scriptural to baptize babies. Only those old enough to make a conscious choice should be baptized.

I am a member of a Wels Lutheran church. Below is an excerpt from some literature from our church regarding baptism. We believe in infant baptism for the reason that we are all born sinful and since an infant cannot verbalize faith, we baptize "to cover all ground" if you will. It is the only means of grace for infants. We believe that we are all descendants of Adam and since he and Eve were sinful, we are all born sinful. If you are born of sin, then if you were to die without your sin forgiven...  In the bible it says “Go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you” (Matthew 28:19,20). What is a nation? A nation is not just made up of adults, it includes children. When John the baptist was baptizing people the people would have brought their children with them to have them baptized, he would not have turned anyone away. Baptism is a gift intended for ALL. Jesus being baptized as an adult was a display of obedience toward God. It wasn't intended to be an event only for adults.  When you proceed with making plans to baptize your children you'll first have to make arrangements with your church. Churches may handle things differently from the next. My church for example offers baptism as a no stings attached gift. We don't even expect the families to become members but of course would welcome them. Some churches may encourage bible information classes or encourage membership.   As written from prior answers some churches believe in infant dedication, not baptism. I don't understand that myself. Why would you dedicate but not baptize? As far as the actual baptism ceremony it can be private or during a church service. Either way, children or infants the method of baptism is pretty universal. Weather it's by sprinkling water on the head or full immersion, either is the exact same in providing grace. The pastor of your church will go over all the details with you when you plan for the baptisms. Congrats and God Bless!!!<br>  <br>  Sacrament of Baptism the Holy Spirit applies the gospel to sinners, giving them new life (Titus 3:5) and cleansing them from all sin (Acts 2:38). The Lord points to the blessing of Baptism when he promises, “Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved” (Mark 16:16). We believe that the blessing of Baptism is meant for all people (Matthew 28:19), including infants. Infants are born sinful (John 3:6) and therefore need to be born again, that is, to be brought to faith, through Baptism (John 3:5). 5. We believe that the Lord gave his Word and the sacraments of Baptism and the Lord’s Supper for a purpose. He commanded his followers, “Go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you” (Matthew 28:19,20). Through God’s Word and sacraments he preserves and extends the holy Christian church throughout the world. Believers should therefore be diligent and faithful in the use of these divinely established means of grace for themselves and in their mission outreach to others. These are the only means through which immortal souls are brought to faith and to life in heaven.

N8pTEgjhaa	Every Christian goes through periods of doubt, and don't let anyone tell you that that this isn't true. Keep praying, reading the Bible, and being in community with other Christians. I would also recommend reading some of C.S. Lewis' works like mere Christianity and possibly a book like The Shack. Though it may not be 100 percent theologically correct, it gets at the truth of the Christian God and can bring you closer to him.<br>  <br>  I went through a period just like you are going through now and I continued to press on.

Doubt is a natural feeling. You have these emotions that God himself has given you. You will find though that the closer you become to kindness the closer you will be to God. Be patience with yourself is my advice to you. God loves you. He will always be there for you but do not forget about Satan and his army of demon. There influence is around us each and every day. Satan wants us to fail and mock God. I say to you find strength in the little acts of kindness to your fellow man and then you will see Jesus hiding behind the corner smiling.|`|0a35bd8efe64caf91fcf1e0cf5d79e07aa	Satan is the author of confusion. Like you, I accepted Christ as savior at a young age and walked away later in life. I didn't just backslide, either. I went deep into things of the devil trying to find God on my own terms, listening to the lies of Satan about how the Bible was just a book written by man, etc. After decades of sin and depression, I finally hit rock bottom, but God was right beside me ready to pick me up and dust me off and assure me that I was still His. The devil will send demons to urge you to question your salvation, remind you of your sins and otherwise attempt to prevent you from living a life pleasing to God so that you might fail to reach others with the gospel. God had grace for you. You know that He does. It is up to you to accept that grace and stop being so hard on yourself. Please read the Screwtape Letters, by CS Lewis. It really helped me understand how Satan works in the world against us. Rebuke the devil and his confusion in the name of Jesus, and walk in grace. God already gave you peace. Christ said He left His peace for us. It is up to us to claim it. Email me if you want. God bless.|`|RyhluHk3aa	You MUST understand that you do NOT need to go to an altar, unless you just want alone time with Him, to talk. If you are going to an altar like I was, when I was wasting time in the Pentecostal church, asking God for what I already had (forgiveness), then you need to study and learn just exactly what Christ did at the cross.<br>  Thousands of pastors have correctly taught millions of Christians that "all of your sins have been forgiven you..... past, present, and future". Then they contradict this basic teaching of grace directly, by instructing these believers to ask God for forgiveness when they sin. Rather, Christians MUST remember that God HAS FORGIVEN them (past tense) of ALL sin:<br>  "...He HAS made you alive together with Him, having forgiven you all trespasses..." (Col. 2:13)<br>  "And be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, just as God in Christ also FORGAVE you." (Eph. 4:32)<br>  <br>  Christ gave you freedom from being identified with sin, and you are now blessed with ALL spiritual gifts IN THE HEAVENLIES.<br>  <br>  He is there for you. You may get lax, and lazy in your Christian walk, but you can never walk away from Christ. You are a purchased possession. (Eph. 1:14)<br>  Pretty Poison was correct in what she said that you can NOt go on feelings. If you are seeking signs, and expecting God to speak to you, you are going to be disappointed. Signs, miracles and wonders ceased in the days of the apostle Paul. No signs will be given. That includes Him talking to you. Take it on faith that He is there. That is what Paul teaches us, that we walk by faith, NOT by sight (or feeling).<br>  <br>  Just do your best.

When you pray, read the bible you must concentrate on what you do......|`|D5QdN3tiaa	I remember being there.  In fact this sounds exactly like my story!<br>  <br>  Here is what is so important:  Hold onto the scriptures.  Believe them above what any man says to you -- they are the Word of God.  <br>  <br>  If you are seeking for assurance of salvation, read and even MEMORIZE the book of I John... read it from top to bottom.  And then read it again.  The apostle John wrote it, who was one of the disciples nearest to Christ.  He wrote it to give assurance to those who were saved, and to clarify those who were not.<br>  <br>  I also grew up in church, prayed the salvation prayer when I was seven, rededicated my life in my teens, and went through lots of doubts, struggles, .... and I was not saved.  How do I know?  I was holding onto sin, living for myself, not following Christ.  I was loving the things of this world (see I John 2), often rebelling against the very commandments of God, harboring sin in my life.  This is not evidence of true salvation.<br>  <br>  When God saves, He gives us a new heart that HE will CAUSE to walk in His statutes (Ezekiel 36: 25-27) -- that's what being "born again" means! (John 3)  That's what the new covenant is all about!  Christ, the Son of God, came and bore the wrath of God for our sins... the wrath that WE DESERVE!  He saves us when we repent (turn away) from living in sin -- living in rebellion against Him, idolizing other things above Him, living for our own selves and not for His glory alone -- and cling to Christ.  We trust that, although we are totally unworthy on our own, God will love and accept us because of what Christ has done (II Corinthians 5:21)<br>  <br>  If we are His, if we love Him, we will keep his commandments -- that is how we know we are His disciples, no longer enslaved to sin.  (John 14:15, I John 2:3-6, Romans 8)<br>  <br>  Saturate your mind in the Word of God.  Pray continually that He will teach you, show you where you stand with Him.  He will!  He is a gracious Lord, good and merciful!  Cling to Him.  When did He ever turn anyone away who begged His mercy?  Know Him -- read the gospels telling of His life.  Love Him -- that is the first and greatest commandment.  Never give up following Him -- He promises that if you seek Him you'll find Him, that if you draw near to Him He will draw near to you.|`|FOzN3xwzaa	You have to BELIEVE in Jesus alone to save you.  Believe. <br>  <br>  Jesus is God  :)  Ask Jesus to give you faith to believe.  He will!  :) <br>  <br>  And when you believe, then you are saved, period!  :)  It truly is that simple. <br>  <br>  Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation. <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what!|`|OndkYzHdaa	1 John 5:13 " I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God that you may know that you have eternal life." Don't worry, everyone feels distant from God sometimes. The best way to get closer to Him is to spend time in His word and spend time in prayer. If you don't kno a good place to start, I would suggest Job 38-40. There's nothing to be worried about if you know that you're saved. If you don't spend time with a friend you're going to feel distant from them. Our relaionship with God is no different. If you're praying and don't know where to start, just start by thanking Him for what He has blessed you with and for who He is. Sin in your life can also make you feel distant from God. Come clean with it, I mean He already knows. I'll be praying for you! Draw near to Him and He will draw near to you!|`|cmZ5Opmuaa	You sound a lot like me. I accepted the Lord when I was 10 and kind of strayed and re dedicated my life not to long ago. And you know what? I still have doubts! But doubts come from stupid satan. He makes you think you are a terrible person who sins too much, and could never be forgiven of them. But it says in Romans 10:9 that, "if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe He rose again on the third day, you will be saved." and it goes on to say some really cool things after verse 9. Read the whole chapter of Romans 9 and see what it does. Sometimes we doubt. But that's when we need to back up those doubts with biblical truth and see if they are true or not. I ask myself this a lot: Are you a sinner? Do you believe Jesus died on the cross for our sins and rose again on the third day? Did you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord? .....Just say, "Lord, I give you my life and trust you with it." I said that when I rededicated my life to Him. Sometimes it's really hard. But if you read the Word, God will speak to you. God bless you and I hope God will quiet your heart and those doubts. :) EDIT: and sometimes when you sin, and don't hear from God, it's because sin is keeping you away from Him. Just ask God to forgive you of your sins, and they will be forgiven. When i strayed and sinned a lot and came back to the Lord, i didnt hear from Him at first because sin was between Him and I. So i said a prayer and He re entered my life, because I was sick of sinning and fulfilling my evil desires. When I looked in the mirror i saw and ugly picture, i got to the point where I hated myself. But God kind of tugged on my heart and said, I'm here,......God bless ya:)|`|dada964081337d511df9d4bcdd176dcfaa	Well, depending on your theology, salvation is something that can go away. I believe that it can but many people think its locked in. Theres scripture to support both sides.<br>  <br>  One word I noticed a lot in your post is feel. Feelings are a part of a person, but at the same time, they are not your whole person. They also change in an instant. <br>  <br>  Do you want to follow Jesus? If so, keeping doing it, and you're fine.<br>  <br>  Honestly though, and I could be wrong, it seems like youre dealing with guilt from some kind of sin issue. Is there somehting you need to give up to God? Evaluate that. <br>  <br>  But honestly everyone goes though these thigns.|`|qYMAebZEaa	Hey hun... First of all, you NEVER have to doubt being saved, provided you still believe in Jesus and His death/resurrection.  For a LONG time, I dealt with still not being sure I'd go to heaven, but as long as you have Christ in you, you don't have to worry.  That being said, having doubts is completely human.  I definitely deal with that a LOT.  But your desires to spend time with Him and read His Word are putting you on the right track.  Sometimes I fall away from Him and can't really put my finger on why, but you just have to cling to Him and just talk to Him.  Say what's on your mind, what's troubling you.  I wish I had better advice, but I'm still trying to figure this out for myself.  But as long as you keep believing in Him, you don't have to doubt your salvation.  As far as growing up in church, that has nothing to do with it.  Sometimes that's where the most doubts come from because you start thinking that "it's what I've grown up with, what if it's wrong?" and such.  But it has nothing to do with how long you've known Him.  It has to do with your relationship with Him and the longing (that you still have) to get closer to Him.  Also, it's really easy to look back on times (like when you re-dedicated) and wonder why you can't always be that strong in your faith and get discouraged because of it.  Try not to.  Everyone goes through ups and downs in their life, and like it or not, it affects your relationship with God.<br>  <br>  Also, look at your life.  Is there anything that is keeping you from feeling close to Him? Something that He wants you to give up? Someone who's discouraging you? And just spend some time with Him; not even talking, but just spend some time in His presence. It can have a calming effect.  And remember that no matter what, He's with you. <br>  <br>  Hope that helps.  I'm praying for you. <br>  <br>  Hebrews 13:5b- Never will I leave you; never will I forsake you.

Regardless of whether he loves her or not, he IS with her and you won't gain any points with him by trying to steal him away. If you don't respect him and his boundaies, he won't respect you.

FOzN3xwzaa	That's not the blasphemy of the Holy Spirit. <br>  <br>  The truth is that the blasphemy of the Holy Spirit is dying without having believed in Jesus alone for salvation.<br>  <br>  The message of the Holy Spirit is that believing in Jesus alone is the only way to be forgiven of your sins and to be saved and to get into heaven and to avoid being sent to eternal torment in hell. <br>  <br>  The person who dies without having believed in Jesus alone for salvation, is unforgiven and is therefore sent to hell for eternal torment. <br>  <br>  So believe in Jesus alone for salvation right now, and you will never be able to blaspheme the Holy Spirit :) <br>  <br>  Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation. <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what! <br>  <br>  Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|8pQrIL90aa	God does not condemn man, he heals them.

The unpardonable sin is complete rejection of the Holy Spirit's influence in your life.  It is unpardonable because the Holy Spirit is the source of the graces of repentance.  Forgiveness requires repentance, therefore without the Holy Spirit gently calling us to repentance we cannot be forgiven.  Since you are concerned about what you have done, the Holy Spirit is obviously speaking to you through your conscience.  Therefore you have not rejected His influence in your life.|`|6jAVElX7aa	you can ask for forgiveness in the Name of Jesus Christ, we all have bad thoughts at times, as long as you dont act on those thoughts, I believe you can receive forgiveness,  It is satan who wants to pull you away from the saving grace of our Lord Jesus Christ.|`|Ytxt5HsYaa	Although I am not a christian some christians believe(and I agree) that those thoughts are Satan "whispering in your ear" or putting thoughts in your head, it is thought of as a form of his temptation of man.|`|9xwhzf6Eaa	yes|`|OugNf0x6aa	Have you become a nutcase?

eb4e977a0cb9ce50b08bf74f0f3a0c61aa	Here is truth - read and understand. <br>  1. Vampires, defined as a humanoid being that MUST consume blood or energy to survive do not exist. Cut and paste time, as it is too much work to type this out over and over and I "recycle" my own answers instead of retyping them so here goes. A brief discussion of the human digestive system and then the probable vampire population given an exponential growth rate should explain why vampires are not possible. <br>  <br>  2. The human body is not designed to process large amounts of blood for nutrition. There is not enough protein, carbohydrates, and fats present in blood to maintain a complex creature such as Homo Sapiens or any theorized offshoot mutations. When a human ingests food it is first broken up into a bolus by chewing, then churned up in the stomach with digestive juices to form a mass called chyme. It then passes through the pylorus into the duodenum, part of the small intestine where it mixes with bile salts and secretions from the pancreas and liver which continue breaking it down on a molecular basis, mostly affecting fats at this point. The broken down nutrients pass through the wall of the intestines and into the bloodstream where they are carried to each cell or stored for later use. Indigestible bulk continues through the intestines, turning a dark brown from the bile. Water is absorbed from this mass in the large intestine depending on the needs of the body - a well-hydrated person will usually have a softer stool than a dehydrated person will. Water also enters the bloodstream, and this is what helps to maintain blood pressure. The pressure tends to balance itself in a healthy person because the bloodstream goes through a formation in the kidney called the Loop of Henle, where the narrowing blood vessel forces excess water and cellular waste such as urea out through the cellular wall into the kidneys, where it is excreted through the ureters into the bladder, and then out of the body via the urethral passageway.<br>  <br>  3. IMPORTANT - A person physically unable to process his own food for nutrition therefore also could not process blood - it's the same process. Ingested blood does not transmit directly to the veins anyway - it would be chemically broken down by the digestive system.<br>  <br>  4. Theoretical ingestion of blood to supply these nutrients would therefore have to occur at least once a day, and would require the ingestion of the entire blood supply which could not happen as the stomach is far too small to hold that much liquid volume. Hold up your clenched fist - under normal conditions your stomach is about that size. Furthermore, such a mass would be difficult to pass thru the intestines as it has no fibrous bulk, would create an intestinal impaction, causing massive vomiting from the large concentration of iron present, and any "real" vampire would have to eventually expel the waste, which would come out as a black, tarry, smelly goo, just as stool does when blood is present from a upper GI bleed. <br>  5. These humans that affect the whole "vampiric lifestyle" are NOT vampires. They are simply humans playing their own little game, in their own little fantasy world, usually pandering to their own little sexual fetish, which may or may not actually be sexual. I too, play my own little game, in the SCA, but mine is a game where the deeds that I do are determined by the strength of my arm and sword - I am a warrior, with just as much skill and ability as any warrior of ancient times. The difference is that I am claiming to be something physically possible: a warrior, and I prove it everytime I strap on my armor and walk onto a SCA battlefield. The so-called "vampires" are claiming to be something physically impossible: a walking corpse, and all they prove is that black Victorian clothing, a pair of false fangs, and a little makeup make for a good Halloween costume - it does not make you a vampire.<br>  <br>  6. Even if a vampire feeds once a week, and his victim also becomes a vampire, that is exponential growth, with four iterations a month. First iteration: One makes one, total two. Second iteration: Two make two, total four. Third iteration: Four make four, total eight. Fourth iteration: Eight make eight, total sixteen. 16 vampires at the end of one month, 256 at the end of the second month, 4096 by the end of the third month, 65,536 by the end of the fourth month, 1,048,476 at the end of the fifth, and 33,572,832 vampires at the end of half a year! By way of comparison, there are currently approximately 33 million people who have HIV/AIDS and the disease is a world-wide epidemic. I see people every day in the hospital with AIDS, but never has there been one documented case of a vampire attack. Do the math - vampires are a mathematical impossibility. As for the idea that vampires existed "a long time ago" consider the estimated global population 5,000 years ago - using the above mathematical rationale, a single vampire converted every human on the globe in less than two years. This falls therefore, under the logic of Occam's Razor - which states that when you have removed every impossible answer, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth. Since there is no "vampiric plague" swarming the earth, the logical deduction is that they don't exist.<br>  <br>  7. Point of clarification about "vampire" bats: vampire is simply the name we have given them because they do drink blood, same as a flea, mosquito, leech, or spider. Are these creatures vampires? No. They are living creatures, not legendary monsters. They can subsist on blood because of their smaller size and proportionately larger stomach volume. Drinking blood does not make you a vampire anymore than eating raw meat makes you a werewolf, although it might make you a mosquito.<br>  <br>  8.The humans who profess to be vampires are victims of an all-encompassing self induced delusion. They are as human as you or I, regardless of their claims, and if they ingest HIV tainted blood they can most certainly contract the disease, esp. if they have any cuts, sores, or lesions in and or around their mouth. It is a very dangerous delusion to be laboring under. Note that there is absolutely no scientific or medical proof that these people derive any benefit at all from the ingestion of blood, and even worse are the so-called "psychic" vampires, because their delusion is one that they cannot substantiate with any concrete evidence at all.<br>  <br>  9. There is no "vampire" gene. People are not "born" as vampires. When a woman goes to the hospital for prenatal care there are many tests done on mother and child, even while still in the womb, to check for many things, including genetic anomalies that result in deformities and birth defects. If such a gene existed, in today's world with today's technology it would have been found - we have already completely sequenced the human genome. It would also have to follow Mendel's law of dominant/recessive gene theory. Again, the odds on that many "vampires" all escaping the notice of the medical/scientific community are so low as to be almost nonexistent. The idea that there is a global "vampire community" engaging in controlled breeding to keep the "bloodline pure" is delusional in the extreme.<br>  <br>  10. There is no "vampire virus" - as I have already pointed out, HIV is a virus, and look at how fast it has spread - virtually everyone knows someone with the affliction. According to the "vampire websites" there are "thousands" of vampires running around. If that was so then at least one of them has ended up in a hospital for bloodwork when they became pregnant, had a bloodborne infection, was injured in a car wreck, etc, etc, ad nauseum. The anomaly would have been detected and medical science would have isolated it, studied it, applied for research grants on it, published papers on it, and turned it into the talk of the medical and scientific community, as well as making its "discoverers" celebrities and rich beyond their dreams. A virus cannot alter your DNA in such a radical fashion without killing you.|`|RrQNJsVsaa	Read twilight.|`|AA10691319	ok heres the secret.

6DmsiLGbaa	It really depends on the climate, though from what I know of Brazil, isn't a large chunk of it fairly humid and warm?  I served as a sister missionary in a very warm area myself, and I learned a few things the hard way.<br>  <br>  First, if it's as warm in Brazil as I believe, you're going to want a few things that aren't on your list.  <br>  <br>  --Handkerchiefs, and lots of them!  I can't count the number of times when my companions and I went tracting and someone would stop us and ask if it'd been raining or if we'd fallen in a lake or something.  Sweat is not attractive, especially on women who have to keep up appearances.  Buy more of these than you're required to bring.  <br>  <br>  --Pantyhose is also an issue for girls.  You'll need a few pairs of full hose for meetings, but unless your mission president specifically orders the sisters to wear full hose at all times, you'll want to avoid that.  Wearing hose in major heat and while you're sweating can actually cause a very painful rash to form on your legs (which makes shaving a whole lotta fun).  Knee-highs are infinitely preferable, though if you're in an area where you have to ride a bike, you'll want to avoid those, as well.  I found that it wasn't really possible to wear a long skirt on a bike since it always caught on the wheels, but if you're wearing a shorter skirt, people will see the thigh-highs when you ride.  That's obviously tacky.  Instead, buy MANY pairs of footies--the hose that only covers your feet.  You can find them at Wal-Mart.  The thicker ones will last longer, though since no hose is really all that strong, you'll go through them fairly quickly.<br>  <br>  --Sensible shoes.  This should be obvious, but don't bother with anything that doesn't have a heel or that has any gaps in the toe area at all.  They'll only cause pain.  I found that Mary-Janes were best, since the sole is insanely thick and will last most of your mission.  You'll probably need to buy them online, however, since they're ugly as sin and most stores don't carry them.  Nursing shoes will also work, but try to get them in black since that color will match everything.  Also, break them in BEFORE you go!  No matter how often you wear them in the MTC, it won't be enough.  Trust me.<br>  <br>  --Hair ties!  If it's hot, you won't want to leave your hair loose.  Also, since girls have to keep their hair at least semi-respectable and this is hard to do in the field, you might want to think of how you're going to keep your hair tied up.  I used a bunch of hair clips, but I had companions who just used a ton of hairspray.  Whatever you decide, make sure you stock up.<br>  <br>  --Try to purchase shirts that are wrinkle-free and don't have to be ironed.  I know ironing only takes a few minutes, but time is precious.  <br>  <br>  --A good rain jacket!  I'm not a big fan of the missionary mall in Utah, but they do have a rain jacket that can fit in your pocket.  You'll want one like that.<br>  <br>  --You'll also want to buy the missionary backpack at the MTC.  I didn't, and I always regretted it, because finding a bag that had so many pockets was always a problem.  I ended up just buying these really big bags and then wearing them across my chest so the weight wouldn't hurt my shoulders.  That was okay, but the dressier shirts don't really have thick material, and the straps on the bags actually wore out the fronts a little too quickly.  <br>  <br>  --Electric adapter.  You may or may not have electricity, but American hairdryers do not work in other countries.  You can buy an adapter kit at pretty much any electronic store, including Wal-Mart and the missionary mall in Utah.  <br>  <br>  --A really, really good water bottle!  The missionary backpack has one built in, but most of the missionaries I've known have carried an extra water bottle anyway.  Try to get one with a strap, because you might not always have a place to carry it.  <br>  <br>  --Lotion, bug spray, and hand sanitizer.  You will need them.  Oh, and if you typically use facial moisturizer, get one with sunscreen.  <br>  <br>  --You should also bring one or two sweaters.  Warm places often get cold in the winter, and you'll want them then.  <br>  <br>  I hope this list helps, and congratulations.  Mission work is exhausting, but it's also a blast.  You'll meet some incredible people and have some incredible experiences...after all, there's a reason why most missionaries have to be dragged back home, kicking and screaming!  <br>  <br>  Oh, and one last tip: start studying the lessons from Preach My Gospel now.  Most of the time spent at the MTC will be on learning to teach, not learning the lessons themselves.  If you're at least familiar with the lessons, you'll have a much easier time of it.  <br>  <br>  Congrats again!|`|d05b366085d8773ec7654e3ad2b991cdaa	Congratulations.

There are some pretty cool LDS stuff you can get--little trinkets and such.  I liked to give oil vials and ties to the guys I baptized, sort of hints to wear a white shirt to church and to have them work towards the Melchizedek Priesthood.<br>  <br>  As far as stuff that you'll need, just make sure you got the best pair of shoes ever.  I walked right through mine--but I'd do it again in a heartbeat if I could.<br>  <br>  You'll love it.  The MTC (we call it the CTM) rocks.  The language is CHIQUE (awesome)<br>  <br>  I'm jealous.  I'm sorry, and I'm ranting.  You'll be great.  Don't give ear to these naysayers.  Just commit to be obedient, commit to give the whole time to the Lord and commit to waste some serious Elder trash.<br>  <br>  I know a few people in Fortaleza and one of them works in the mission presidency.  (He's one of the counselors)  Say "Hi" from Elder Gigante and I'll bet he'll freak out.  His son was my "son" (trainee) from the mission.  Most awesome person I met.<br>  <br>  Here's something for you to practice..<br>  <br>  Eu sei que a igreja de Jesus Cristo dos Santos dos U'ltimos Dias e' verdadeira.<br>  <br>  (It won't let me put accents on here, shucks)<br>  <br>  It means, I know that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is true.<br>  <br>  You'll be great.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  In response to one answer you got, most of the people you'll talk to will probably be evangelicals.  They are the most visible people there.  Most of the Catholics are the kind that go to weddings and baptisms and that's about it.  The JW's have a pretty good presence too.  <br>  <br>  Just love them all--you'll be great!|`|xNejgCYOaa	I served in Recife, which is close.  It's really warm.  Wear comfy shoes, you will do a lot of walking.  I had a new comp who brought shoes with some heels.  Don't even bring them. Make-up and hair?  It's too humid.  It will melt off your face.  Cotton clothes are the best.  Nice t-shirts (not like the logo kind, like the dressy kind) and skirts are the best.  <br>  Have fun and work hard.  You will have the time of your life!!!|`|5nCKxYsUaa	I'm not LDS but still wish you the best.

Check around the web - I wouldn't be surprised if the mission has a website where you can get more info and even ask your questions.

stD14wWaaa	You need to accept that it is Allah's will and that this person's life (the one who died) is just a loan from Allah. Verily, to Him we shall return. It's painful but you need to be strong. If one cannot find relief in Allah, he will not find it anywhere.|`|bfWcfCKXaa	Yes, of course, someone very close to me died. My grandmother who was like my mother - I spent as much time with  her as I did at home. I adored the woman and she adored me. She died of a heartattack while I was in seminary back in 1985. I still dream about her- I like to think she comes to me in my dreams. I often have dreams that she is still alive. But in my dreams there is this sadness that her life is fleeting and will go away soon. I deal with the loss of this most wonderful woman in my life by keeping her memories alive in my alone life. I cook the old fashioned ways that she did, I garden they way she did, I keep holiday traditions the way she did - I keep her spirit alive in me by being as she was. You can never have that person's physical presence back. But you can adopt their spirit and that spirit can become apart of who you are and how you choose to live your live and what traditions you choose to keep. Do not betray the one you loved with alien traditions. When I'm in the rose garden, the spirit of my grandmother is with me. When I am working in the herb garden, her spirit is the air and in the soil. When I'm baking bread from her receipe, her spirit makes the bread rise. When I make applesauce, her spirit makes the sauce sweet. My grandmother has never really left me - the memories of her are always there.|`|19ec41e42df6e58799e9d9a266240579aa	Nope..

"Hiyo Silver, The lone Ranger Rides Again" captured my imagination on the radio, years before television came along. I believe that the Lone Ranger  intro is what helped Mom and Dad interest me and introduce me to classical music. They also took me to local classical concerts where I started recognizing better music. Walt Disney also made a valuable contribution to the life long appreciation of good music with the scores that he used with his animated  cartoons that we referred to as " The Comedies."

Ghosts can be pretty harmless for most of the time, but some can be aggressive. if the ghost in your house ain't doing anything bad to you and your family members, then they should be pretty friendly. Sometimes a ghost will stay, because it's fond of the place that your living in and they just can't bear to part from that place, just like you can't bear to part from your home.

I looked in the very back stall and there was a girl's head peaking over the stall with a big black mess of tangled hair covering her face. I really panicked looked to the side of the wall and saw three big scratch marks. My heart was pounding away. I told my friend and at first i thought my eyes were playing tricks on me but no. <br>  <br>  We continued going to the bathroom and trying to call the spirit of "Alice" thats what we named here. We got others involved, and they too believed in her. My best friend and i would take people who didnt believe. We did a made up little chant that was supposed to make her powerful. We believed we could turn it on and off. We didnt dare to go halfway to the back stall because we'd turn the light off when we did this. Halfway to it we'd line the floor with toilet paper making it a cross. <br>  <br>  We've heard footsteps, loud bangs, and twisted whispers. It was so thrilling to encounter with something dead but not yet passed on. I didn't want to stop. We got in trouble for being over there and now its always locked.<br>  <br>  I'm now in the 8th grade. You psychicc or something. Your never frightened?|`|C1r8C58oaa	im going to play on both sides here . i was paranormal person a few years ago.. but if you only believe one side of an argument you never get an answer .. <br>  <br>  i think there is something around that's left behind .. but also it can be our mined . when we feel ppl its an irreversible feeling when you ever creep your self out your hairs stand up  if you don't believe normally its goes away but our heads can fill up with all sorts of stuff. <br>  <br>  i lets that feeling stay i did it once walking home threw a dark alleyway my god my hairs stud up and i ran my heart was thumping but i then realised i did it to my self .. this can be triggers buy you ears ....<br>  <br>  when you start trying to listing to those really silet ears it sets off a signal in your brain which can confuse you or make you see things .<br>  <br>  people have loved to scare ppl for years with hoaxes i love to watch those documentaries about dead people but i need to see to believe ..|`|ETxhrPwPaa	thats really creepy! <br>  <br>  I would cry! <br>  <br>  yea me and my mom are 'communicators" aka we see dead people. <br>  <br>  The worst one that happened to me was when i was getting dressed in my room and i was a bit sore so i sat down on my chair from my grandmas house tht is in my room ( my granpa had recetly died) first time i ever sat in the chair. I looked up and in the  irror i saw clear as day  a silhoueette man walk across my room behind me and disapear into the wall. I havent sat in the chair since. <br>  <br>  Also i was at my moms friends house when i was really really young and i pointed at a lady in a picture and said angel angel angel look at the angel. The lady told my mom thatwas her grandma and she had died the day before. <br>  <br>  sometimes i get so scared when i see them even though i know they cont hurt me, i beg for my abilities to leave me. I can feel it when they do. Sometimes i sub consiously tur nthem on but never to their full extenet  <br>  <br>  im working on my fear and embracing my gift. :)

So many lost, and so many who think they are saved, and really don't have a clue. People, read and study The Word of God!! It's your "human" owners manuel.  Gods heart is so grieved. He sent His one and only Son, Jesus Christ, to die so I would have the choice to go to heaven. That's why He 's closing down so many churches, they are so far off!!Life is a test, and we get to take it, with an "open book". We get to read, reread, over, and over.

xp6UVyj2aa	I would say he's doing it for attention. If hes breathless everytime a guy walkls by and starts getting loud and obnoxious he's odviously going for attention and knows that with the way he's acting no guy is going to be interested.

If hes becoming obsessed with homosexuality its probably an outlet for attention for him.|`|aI1z8bQeaa	How are you friends with this...?<br>  <br>  I have plenty of male gay friends none of which act like this, and depending on what he looks like they would either hate him or like him (if he's hot).<br>  <br>  He's probably trying to psych himself into liking guys.<br>  If your close try and talk to him, maybe he's hiding something and needs advice.|`|46rvOfL2aa	He's probably gay but, there's no reason to just go around acting like you're the best thing to hit the earth and trying to make everybody else feel weird.

A7m5CdvMaa	Magic is one name given to a process that cannot be explained something that seems to happen without explanation. Since the magician knows the explanation it isn't magic.<br>  <br>  All magic must eventually have a physical explanation even if the explanation is an aberration of perception like an optical illusion or a symptom of mental illness.<br>  <br>  If magic was real it would be governed by the underlying properties of the mechanism facilitating it, uncovering these rules would be an act of scientific enquiry.<br>  <br>  The issue of whether or not the paranormal is real is a very interesting one that could eventually lead to a new scientific perspective on the universe. Those who claim magic is beyond science don't understand science, because science is simply a description of what is.|`|wMALGKFsaa	No, I dont think it was real...|`|9OqSl1Jlaa	Magic is all hocus pocus.

That is what has made America great, being able to decide your own future. That you can decide to have a traditional relationship and not have to worry about other people making that decision for you is a bonus.<br>  <br>    At the moment, gay people don't have that choice. It's nice that you do though. Keep a traditional lifestyle if you love it and want it. <br>  <br>   The truth is that America is on the decline and we are losing our rights to various things but that does not mean you have to accept it. Live your life, your own way.

ahFV9rfxaa	If you want to read the good and the bad, you also need to be willing to explore all websites.  The Koran has many contradictions.  For this reason Islam has the law of abrogation, that's where Muhammad's later writings supersede his earlier writings to deal with these contradictions. <br>  <br>  The Koran has an endless stream of contradictions.  Like who was the first Muslim: Muhammad [6:14, 163], Moses [7:143], some Egyptians [26:51], or Abraham [2:127-133, 3:67] or Adam, the first man who also received inspiration from Allah [2:37]?<br>  <br>  Can Allah be seen and did Muhammad see his Lord? Yes [S. 53:1-18, 81:15-29], No [6:102-103, 42:51]. <br>  <br>  Here's an endless list of these contradictions:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.answering-islam.org/Quran/Contra/index.html#internal" rel="nofollow">http://www.answering-islam.org/Quran/Con...</a><br>  <br>  Here's a list of contradictions, both against the Bible and history.  It even mentions Joseph being sold for a number of coins before any coins ever existed.<br>  <br>   <a href="http://www.answering-islam.org/Quran/Contra/index.html#bible" rel="nofollow">http://www.answering-islam.org/Quran/Con...</a><br>  <br>  In his earlier writings Muhammad wrote favorably of the Jews and Christians, but then later on he had wars with them and wrote disfavorably toward them.<br>  <br>  In his earlier writing he said if anyone has questions about the faith to ask the people of the book, referring to Christians.  But later he wrote to kill Christians and Jews, and if any infidels will not convert you are to kill them.<br>  <br>  At one time there were many different versions of the Koran.  But one of the Caliphs destroyed all but one version and killed those that had the other versions; although we have fragments of those other versions, including a fragment that correctly says Abraham was going to sacrifice his son Isaac, instead of the current Koran which says he was going to sacrifice Ishmael.<br>  <br>  Here’s a big contradiction in the Koran that underscores it not being inspired by God.  Here's a quote and link that discusses this contradiction.<br>  <br>  Christians read with surprise in Sura 19:28-29 that Mary, the mother of Jesus, was a sister of Aaron. Learned men of Islam, who are aware that between Miriam, the sister of Aaron, and Miriam or Mary, the mother of Jesus there is a gap of 1500 years, try to persuade us that Mary had a brother, who also happened to be an Aaron. We reject this possibility, because she is also described as the daughter of Imram (Sura 66:12), the Amram of Exodus 6:20. He was indeed the father of Aaron, Moses and Miriam.

QjlWEapVaa	The bible speaks of salvation in many aspects and putting them together forms a complete salvation.  I believe you are referring to the salvation from eternal perdition or the lake of fire.<br>  <br>  Yes, salvation from perdition is eternal.  Once a person is saved, he/she is eternally saved.  Being saved from eternal perdition is on the negative side.  On the positive side, we receive eternal life, which is God Himself as life to us.  This is something marvelous and great.  Because we have receive His life, we became His children.  John 1:12 says that those who believe/receive Him were given authority to become children of God.  As true born again christians, we were not adopted but genuine child of God.  Therefore it is impossible for us to be "unsaved".  We cannot be "unborned".<br>  <br>  We were born of our biological parents.  We maybe naughty and the relationship between our parents and us may turn sour, and even to the extend we might deny them... no matter what, they are still our parents.  Likewise, our God's eternal salvation is the same.  It cannot be undone.<br>  <br>  Hallelujah!<br>  <br>  (p/s: once saved, we need a continual daily salvation for the coming age of the kingdom)|`|9h5n906Caa	John 3:16 says that whosoever believeth in Him shall have everlasting life.  So if we except Him as Lord and Savior then we do have eternal salvation.  But that does not mean that if we turn away from him after that we will continue to be saved.  It is a daily process.  If you marry someone and then immediately following the ceremony move to different states and never talk again, that is not really a marriage is it?  salvation is not just a ceremony to look good, but be able to do what ever we feel like we want to do.  it is a relationship, a friendship, and a commitment.|`|FOzN3xwzaa	Yes. <br>  <br>  Jesus gives ETERNAL life  :)  Not "temporary" life.  Not "probationary" life.  <br>  <br>  Eternal life  :) <br>  <br>  The truth is that it is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation (John 6:39-40, 1 John 5:13).<br>  <br>  In other words, until a person believes that what he has received from the Lord Jesus is permanent and cannot be lost, he might not yet be born again. A person cannot believe in Jesus alone for his eternal destiny and yet also believe that he must do something (or avoid doing something) to keep it.|`|jZaLFfb2aa	Anything you are not sure of is all in the Bible. God gave it to us so we would know how to live. We all need Salvation, because we are all sinners. That's why Jesus died on the cross. The people who say no are probably Atheists who say God isn't real. How to know God is real? In the bible, a verse says Look outside, that is enough proof right there. Just look, and you see a wonderful creation that has been twisted by human kind.<br>  <br>  We need salvation because we don't want to burn. We want to be by God.<br>  <br>  Now do we get salvation forever? sorta. Only if you believe, ask for forgivness, and live. It is a gift from God that we choose to except.<br>  <br>  Some people never accept it. The question really is will you?<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I have no idea if I answered your question, but I hope this helps.|`|XSwfvM9Eaa	It's not enough to be saved you have to live a sinless life and turn away from sin and walk with god!

That is hypocritical and back biting. After all even satan knew God and all He stood for and he managed to turn away from Him.|`|UinOWcMUaa	If they truly believe and our born again  -- YES --|`|QqxZzvbAaa	eternal means just that, eternal life.<br>  if someone is truly saved then they will hate sin and do everything they can to avoid it.<br>  <br>  if someone is continually living in sin and doing whatever without any regard for what God thinks,I question their sincerity.<br>  <br>  if someone claims they are a "former" christian I don't believe it because the bible says if they left us then they were never one of us.<br>  <br>  <br>  (IFB)|`|AA11703455	Paul didn't think so.<br>  <br>  There were Christians in the 1st Century that abandoned the faithful course, and had received the Holy Spirit. This is what Paul says at Hebrews <br>  <br>  Hbr 10:26 For if we go on sinning willfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins, <br>  <br>   Hbr 10:27 but a terrifying expectation of judgment and THE FURY OF A FIRE WHICH WILL CONSUME THE ADVERSARIES. <br>  <br>   Hbr 10:28 Anyone who has set aside the Law of Moses dies without mercy on {the testimony of} two or three witnesses. <br>  <br>   Hbr 10:29 How much severer punishment do you think he will deserve who has trampled under foot the Son of God, and has regarded as unclean the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified, and has insulted the Spirit of grace? <br>  <br>   Hbr 10:30 For we know Him who said, "VENGEANCE IS MINE, I WILL REPAY." And again, "THE LORD WILL JUDGE HIS PEOPLE." <br>  <br>   Hbr 10:31 It is a terrifying thing to fall into the hands of the living God. <br>  <br>  That does not sound like "once saved, always saved" which is what the term "Eternal Salvation" would imply.<br>  <br>  Some would say that Paul's words didn't match that of Jesus..If you doubt it, go to Revelation and read chapters 2 and 3. Some in the congregations were warned that if they didn't correct their course, Jesus would take action. One congregation he warned he would vomit them out. Pretty strong words, and supports what Paul warned about. <br>  <br>  Rev 3:15 'I know your deeds, that you are neither cold nor hot; I wish that you were cold or hot. <br>  <br>   Rev 3:16 'So because you are lukewarm, and neither hot nor cold, I will spit you out of My mouth.|`|mSFjbetxaa	Yes, I believe in eternal salvation and there is not even one asinine man made religion that makes a bit of difference.<br>  <br>  It must be sad to live with a religion that sells guilt and fear.|`|9OqSl1Jlaa	For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  That's John 3:16.|`|hj76FSKdaa	If a person thinks that he/she can lose salavation, then that person must identify how it would happen.  People who believe they can lose their salavation usually think that it happens from backsliding, leading a sinful life, forgetting to confess sins, and/or from not doing one's best for God.  So a person who thinks this way might be saved one day and not saved the next day.  <br>  <br>  Of course, this is nonsense.  Good works are the result of salvation, but not the cause of it.  And we have to avoid back-loading the gospel, by making a long list of things we must do (or not do) to be certain we were saved in the first place.  That's basically the same works-based mentality.|`|jWljrvOaaa	These are crazy psychotic stuffs.<br>  Just because many believe in these things does not make it real.<br>  Delusion is delusion whether it is manifested by religious or not.<br>  You die, you rot - end of stories. <br>  No heaven or hell and probably no God.<br>  Be a good human being. Harm no one. Help other if you can.<br>  Stop worrying about God. And enjoy your life.|`|uAMzmAwaaa	yes, but just like he won't force the person who rejects the gospel to go to heaven, he won't force us to go to heaven if we choose later down the road to turn our backs on God and just leave him. in turn leaving our salvation (note im not saying that you can lose it though, but lose and leave are 2 different things)|`|xPhbxoK8aa	Yes, I believe that. Once you believe in Christ and accept him as your Savior you are given eternal life. And if you sin you can repent and be forgiven.|`|0a35bd8efe64caf91fcf1e0cf5d79e07aa	Absolutely. God bless.|`|5pgVIlLFaa	Yes Salvation is forever. Jesus is good for his word by his actions|`|kfv0bHPnaa	yes through Christ|`|RyhluHk3aa	Yes. That is what the Gospel of the Grace of God is all about.Ephesians 1:12 -14 teaches us, "That we should be to the praise of His glory, who first trusted in Christ.<br>  In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise, which is the earnest of our inheritance UNTIL THE REDEMPTION OF THE PURCHASED POSSESSION, unto the praise of His glory."<br>  <br>  Also, Ephesians 4:30 teaches us, "Grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby YE ARE SEALED UNTO THE DAY OF REDEMPTION."

They will comply.  If you want them to leave, ask and if they can they will.

iPpmhjR1aa	Great question!  I'm not necessarily an atheist but i can tell you how life started in a model without a creator!  It is very complex and requires knowledge in other fields, such as molecular biology, evolutionary biology, and chemistry to understand, but through some side explanations i will try my best!<br>  <br>  Ok, quite a few billion years ago the earth was a very different place.  There was none of the type of oxygen you breathe in the atmosphere.  It was all locked away in water and CO2.  This is a good thing, for the fragile chemical reactions needed for life to start would be destroyed by the very hungry oxygen atoms.  There was plenty of ammonia, methane, water, and hydrogen though!  What you need for life though, (pretty much) is two things, DNA, and amino acids.....<br>  <br>  Explanation---------------------------...<br>  .Simplified, this is what DNA and amino acids do.<br>  Your body gets stuff done with proteins.  A protein is a little tiny tiny TINY machine.  There are thousands inside every one of your cells.  Proteins are made up of Amino acids.  There are 20 amino acids.<br>  The blueprints of proteins is DNA.  DNA has a code on a string. Basically the code is read and a string of amino acids is made, this string then folds and creates a protein. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PKjF7OumYo" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PKjF7Oum...</a> great video! WATCH IT! it will help you understand IMMENSELY.  Everything you see in that video working with the DNA is a protein! Depending on how the protein folds, it will have certain chemical capabilities, because the Amino Acids that make it up can interact with other molecules.<br>  DNA is made of nucleic acids<br>  So our shopping cart for life includes:<br>  <br>  Amino Acids<br>  Nucleic Acids<br>  hmm, we need an area for life to be contained like our cells are today, so lets pick up some sort of simple container to hold this all in.<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  As i said before, there was ammonia, hydrogen, water, and methane on earth at the time.  Within these 4 molecules, are all the types of atoms required for life. But how do we get the required molecules on our shopping list out of those other ones?  Well, good thing for lightning strikes!  In the famous Miller–Urey experiment, they showed that when ammonia, hydrogen, water and methane are shocked with electricity, Amino acids form! Wow! So we can scratch that off the list!<br>  you can read about their experiment here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller-Urey_experiment" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller-Urey...</a><br>  <br>  We still need some sort of code to do something with all these billions upon billions of amino acids floating in the seas now, but first, let me explain another topic...<br>  <br>  Explanation---------------------------...<br>  People often used the words "puddle" and "millions and millions of years" when sarcastically questioning the evolutionary origins of life theory.  i know it sounds like all these millions of years are an excuse, where we can kind of smudge the facts and say "uhhh yea, give it enough time somethin'll happen" and that is what you're given. and you say to yourself "no! i wont just take the fact that after miiiiiiillions of years, i'll appear out of a puddle!"  and you should rightly feel that way!  it is because there is a lot of opportunity for unlikely happenings to occur in those BILLIONS, not millions of yeas (about 4.5 billion years!) that we are here.  you see the problem is people visualize the opportunity of all life resides in a little "puddle" of "goop." i'm sure we all get the same picture in our minds, some nasty, sticky dark little puddle! but we know exactly what is in that puddle. and this wasn't just a puddle, this was the entire SURFACE OF THE EARTH! that's a 510,072,000 km2 puddle!  so, think about this... let's mentally appreciate the level of coincidental opportunity on ancient earth that could have led to the first organisms.  for every (we'll say square, even though i should be talking about cubic inches since you can travel up and down as well) square inch, you can fit millions of the molecules in question, and each one of these has the opportunity to start making life since they are all interacting with eachother (and it is a key, yet extremely unlikely interaction that will kick start the domino effect of life). multiply that number * we'll say millions* by the area of the earth since this is happening everywhere at the same time *510,072,000 km2* now multiply that by the time the first life started appearing, about 1500000000 (1.5 billion) years.  then multiply that by the number of times each one of those molecules has the opportunity to start making life per year, which is billions and billions of times (chemistry is FAST at the atomic level).  So we multiply *millions and millions* by *510,072,000 km2* by *1500000000* by *billions and billions*. that is a LOT of opportunity for something to happen! even if the odds of life happening were one in a hundred billion, just divide that mental appreciation we came up w|`|3mDvjCa8aa	We know abiogenesis is hypothetically possible thanks to Miller-Urey. We weren't existent at that time and the planet was very different than it is today, so it's hard to tell what the exact chemical make up of Earth was. We know complex carbon compounds were involved, we know liquid water was involved. Some say the original source of energy was the sun, some say lightning, some say hydrothermal vents. We don't know everything.<br>  <br>  But we do know that a God making men out of dirt and women out of man's rib is not a better hypothesis. We've known that for some time...so get thinking if you actually care.|`|ubPOjh0qaa	No one knows. That's why there are religions.

It's asking a rational question.<br>  "Why is 'God did it' the default answer to your lack of data on the origins of life?" That's also a fair question. <br>  <br>  My answer to your question is: the universe is full of organic compounds which are volatile and reactive and tend to produce new and novel compounds under circusmtances which seem to proceed slowly but frequently and naturally in our cosmos. However, that you even ask this question shows how limited your thinking is. Life is easy to explain and the explanations easy to accept if your mind isn't innoculated by cultural conditioning. <br>  <br>  What is not easy to explain is the existence of the cosmos in the first place, and this is ultimately where the theist will retreat. Because you said god was on top of the mountain, but we climbed the mountain and only found thin air. Then you said god was in the clouds, but we flew to the clouds and he wasn't there. So you said god was in the heavens, but we left the earth and found no gods and so now you say he exists in another dimension. So shall theism ever retreat before the expansion of human knowledge, and soon your Bronze Age beliefs will be buried along with you and the flea bitten goat-herders that made it up to scare their women and children.|`|X8LNbaKQaa	I don't know where life started or how.

I proceeded with reverence and caution. Since I was in Ojibwa country (upper Michigan), I spoke to an elder who gave me some advice. She said they like sweet things (then she smiled and winked and said, "but then again, who doesn't like sweets?" She also confirmed what I already knew: they liked offerings of kinnikinnik (Indian tobacco). I learned the Song for the Little People. I was specifically looking to make contact with "Those Who Fly to the Flowers"--because, you see, there are several different faery types among the Ojibway; and "Those Who Fly to the Flowers" are the most benevolent. I visited the site often, always leaving offerings of flowers, sweet cakes and tobacco. Although I didn’t see anything, I felt their presence, and I didn’t give up.  My personal encounter with Ojibwa fairies known as "They who fly to the flowers" occurred later that summer  Here's part of what I wrote in my journal, shortly after the experience:<br>  <br>  “understand that our world and the faery world co-exist and share the same space. There are certain places where the veil that separates these dimensions can be pierced. It’s like knowing a hidden picture is on a page; the picture is hidden because the arrangement of color, shapes and images makes it very difficult to see. But when you put on a pair of red glasses— all of a sudden you see the image clearly. As you can see, the image had always been there. And even after you take the glasses off—and you won’t be able to see the image—you know with certainty that the image is indeed really there. With the Little People is was a green lens, so to speak. There we were on hands and knees, kneeling before a flower . . . offering tobacco and sweet cakes . . .singing the (Ojibwa) Little People Song and believing with all our heart that they were there. And then it happened. Like a beautiful green lens was placed over our eyes, enabling us to see what has always been.”<br>  <br>  In addition to the tobacco and sweet cakes, we also left vanilla flavored rice milk. (It seemed right to leave something for them to drink, too!) Also, a word of caution from the Ojibwa elder I spoke with: never leave alcohol!  She was a spunky old woman with a great sense of humor. But, she said that if I ever get to Ireland. . . "those kind [referring to Irish fairies and leprechauns] like a strong drink."|`|myCyhsouaa	I do; because of faerie circles; all of the stuff they find in Ireland and England.

Adam began life as a perfect human. Therefore, his children could have enjoyed perfect everlasting life. However, Adam sinned before he fathered any children. The entire human race was still in his loins when he received the sentence: "In the sweat of your face you will eat bread until you return to the ground, for out of it you were taken. For dust you are and to dust you will return." (Genesis 3:19) So when Adam sinned and began to die as God said he would, all mankind was sentenced to death along with him.<br>  <br>  Appropriately, the apostle Paul later wrote: "Through one man [Adam] sin entered into the world and death through sin, and thus death spread to all men because they had all sinned." (Romans 5:12) Yes, because of the original sin, children that were supposed to be born perfect with endless life ahead of them were brought forth with sickness, old age, and death as their prospect.<br>  <br>  "That is not fair," someone might say. "We did not choose to disobey God—Adam did. Why should we lose our prospect for everlasting life and happiness?" We know that if a court of law were to put a son in prison because his father had stolen a car, the son could rightly complain: "That is not just! I did not do anything wrong."—Deuteronomy 24:16.|`|hQDapmICaa	the why, who, when, where, which, How and everything you need to know for your salvation is in the Bible.<br>  <br>  As it is written:<br>  <br>  Pro 9:12  If thou be wise, thou shalt be wise for thyself: but if thou scornest, thou alone shalt bear it. <br>  <br>  Peace!|`|AA11124121	Read and quit complaining.<br>  <br>  The original sin was disobedience, mistrust, and disloyalty against God.<br>  <br>  What the original sin did was to cause the human race to fall into the practice of sin. We are born to imperfect parents, whose sin negatively influences us. <br>  <br>  We become accustomed to committing "minor" sins without regard to their negative impact on our lives and the lives of others. <br>  <br>  However, God, in His love, provided the means by which all people could become completely righteous before Him, thus inheriting eternal life.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The Bible says that God has created people to be upright, but they have chosen to do evil.12 We are not condemned on the basis of Adam and Eve's original sin, but our own. <br>  <br>  Our condemnation is rightly deserved due to our rebellion and disobedience of God's laws. <br>  <br>  God is not responsible for our sin, but we are, because of our own lusts.<br>  <br>  However, God, in His love, has provided a way of escape for those who recognize their own inability to live up to God's holy standards. <br>  <br>  Jesus Christ died for our sins to reconcile us to God.

Jesus is our choice just as our first parents had a choice. He even calls Himself the seed that is sown for a family that grows forevermore - those saved by His Spirit. He calls Himself the tree of life, "I know My sheep and they hear my voice, and I give unto them eternal life, and no man shall snatch them from Me." God gave us the choice between life and death because if He did not, then we would be robots doing what we were programmed to do and think. one cannot have the option to love without having the option to dislove. God allowed us to fall, for an almost incredible reason... that He may lift us back up. what is a better thing, a thing made perfectly good? or a perfectly good thing made fine? that is what we are friend, born-again if we believe in Jesus Christ as our payment of sin. you take up the cup of salvation, that fruit from a tree that gives life. we gain more in Christ than we ever lost in adam, i'd rather be a saved sinner than an innocent angel, to become one with Him and Him be one with me.

Here we go again-this seems to be a very popular question.Most are Arab(Semitic White) and has been since 5,000 B.C..When the Arabs conquered and settled the area now known as Egypt(Arabic name given by the Arabs(Semitic Whites)-the area had no name before this The Black leaders of Nubia/Kemet which made up the southern quarter of Egypt(lost to the Arabs) and Sudan, made a pact with the Arabs so as not to be destroyed and permitted to to become Pharoahs, hence some Black Egyptian Dynasties(800-700 B.C.) much like the Indian Police and scouts when the European Whites drove out the Indians in America.This is based on fact and often gets many thumbs down and disagreements by racists,including many Blacks.<br>  <br>  The Egyptians are Arabs(Semitic Whites).The pre Egyptians were Black(mostly Nubian, some Nilotics).Nubia/Kemet(making up 1/4 of southern Egypt and the remainder in Sudan) was conquered by the Arabs-the Black Nubians making a pact with the Arabs to be Pharaohs.<br>  <br>  The feaures of the Sphinx are White by facial structure-the nose being busted away could have provided more clues-the thin lips, high forehead, and recessed jaw are Caucasian (White) features.<br>  <br>  ******ARABS (SEMITIC WHITES) AND BLACKS ARE TWO DIFFERENT ETHINICITIES.ARABS ARE GENERALLY SWARTHY(olive colored/golden brown skin).******<br>  <br>  Because people live/or originated in Africa, does not make them Black, but Africans, much like being American does not mean everyone is White.<br>  <br>  The builders of the pyamids were Arabs(Semitic Whites-yes like Jesus and other Jews, and, Arabs and Jews ARE related) and as proven by genetic(DNA) tests on the mummies, anthropological measurements, and asking the Egyptians themselves. Egypt is an ARABIC name-no name prior to this, existed for Egypt.Before the Arab invasions and pyramid buildings,pre- Egyptian Black Africans did inhabit the area in ancient(keyword) times(before Arab-Semitic White invasions and settlement).Most were driven out by the Arabs(Semitic Whites),much like the European Whites drove out the American Indians in America -the few remaining, intermingled(mixed unions producing descendants) with the Arabs, some even making pacts to become Pharaohs(i.e.-Nubians/peoples of Kemet), much like European Whites allowing Indian police and scouts.Many of the people on wall art are, in fact, Black Egyptian slaves(also some free) as well as peoples of other ethnic backgrounds-much like in America, and the difference shows up in the use of different pigments and physical features drawn-many standing side by side.Many drawings, paintings, statues, and other likenesses of King Tut do exhibit both Black and Semitic White physical characteristics, most notably in his facial likeness(even this varies the spectrum from Arab(Semitic White) to Arab(Semitic White)/Black admixture). He is portrayed anywhere from light brown skin to dark black skin.<br>  <br>  Because Egypt is in Africa, many Blacks, as above, erroneously claim Egypt as Black , when it has NOT been since at least prior to the pyramid building about 5,000 B.C.-MUCH AS IF THE AMERICAN INDIANS WERE TO CLAIM ALL OF AMERICA IS INDIAN.Egypt's culture and foods are Arabic, far different than Black culture and food. Many Blacks often point to Anwar Sadat as being Black. In fact,he was half White(Egyptian-Semitic White) and half Black(Sudanese mother)-denied this until shortly before his death).<br>  <br>  Present day Egypt is 65% White(Semitic Arab)-comparable to 70% of the White population of the US- and 35% nonwhite(predominately Black admixtures and Black, with the remainder Asian(Oriental and Non Oriental(Indo Ruropean Aryan), Indo European Aryan-Greeks, Romans, Turks,Iranians/Perians, etc., and other Semites(mainly Jews)).<br>  <br>  To my Black friends and others, bottom line, Egypt(an Arabic name) is Semitic White and has been since the building of the pyramids based both on history and genetic(DNA) testing on the mummies and yes, some of the Pharaohs(i.e.-Nubia-result of pact with Arabs(Semitic White invaders)), were, indeed, Black-MOST were NOT, being Arab(Semitic White)-please, read your history.Before Egypt(the Arab(Semitic White) given name), as it is known today, Blacks did inhabit the area, but it had not been invaded and settled by the Arabs(Semitic Whites) and given the name, Egypt,its Arabic name, again very similar to European Whites invading and settling America.<br>  <br>  Incidentally, for those who claim Cleopatra was Black, thousands of busts, drawings, paintings, and other likenesses(i.e.-coins) of her, along with written descriptions of her, from that time period, exist.One look and you can tell she is NOT Black(did not say she was Semitic White/White either,but definitely, not all ,if any, Black either), although she may possibly have some Black ancestry.<br>  <br>  The scholars seem to agree: Cleopatra was the last in a line of Ptolemies--Macedonian Greeks(Whites)--who ruled Egypt from the death of Alexander the Great in 305 B.C. until Antony's defeat in the battle of Actium in 31 B.C. The Ptolemies, as was the custom, were an incestuous, intermarrying peoples (to preserve the royal bloodline),also often having relations with the courtiers and concubines who filled their palaces. Many of the children born of these unions were given a place in the royal lineage despite being illegitimate, the secret unspoken.<br>  <br>  Many believe that Cleopatra's father was the product of such a union--his mother may have been a concubine from Nubia(Black) or Alexandria(White). Lending credence to this theory is the fact that Cleopatra's bond to the people of Egypt seemed greater than those of her Ptolemic ancestors, who aligned themselves culturally and linguistically with Greece. <br>  <br>  Yes, as I acknowledged, BEFORE the pyramids, Arab(Semitic Whites) invasions, and Egypt identity, Blacks did populate the area.Technically, Egypt did not exist, so those Blacks are really not ancient Egyptians any more than the American Indians can be called ancient Americans.Show me any kind of scientific proof that Blacks(not including slave labor),and, NOT, Arabs(Semitic Whites) built the pyramids.<br>  <br>  An even better question might be,why do so many Blacks want to claim and insist, Egypt, a majority Arab(Semitic White), Arab culture, food, music, identity, and pyramid building as their own against all factual evidence instead of hearasy? Black Heritage has much Ancient art work an herbal medicines they can rightfully claim as their own rather than trying to claim Arab(Semitic White) Heritage.<br>  <br>  From the time of the pyramid building Egypt has retained about 65% Arab(Semitic White) majority, 35% Black/Black admixture,Indian, and Asian ratios.Anything prior to that, was an area populated by Blacks, but not labeled Egypt(an Arabic name) hence, not really Ancient Egypt or Architects of the pyramids.<br>  <br>  Arabs(Semitic Whites) and Blacks ARE two different peoples despite many racists(including many Blacks) wanting to claim otherwise-totally different food, cultures, music, physical characteristics(ethnic characteristics)-side by side, the differences are readily apparent.Why many Blacks insist, contrary to evidence, Arabs are Black, I do not understand.Being swarthy alone, does not make it so, any more than Indians, Asians or any other swarthy ethinicity would make it so. <br>  <br>  MODERN ETHNIC SAMPLINGS OF ARAB(SEMITIC WHITES) COMPARED TO BLACKS<br>  <br>  Arab(Semitic Whites) Americans: Lebanese heritage: Ralph Nader, Jamie Farr(Clinger on Mash), and the late Danny Thomas.<br>  <br>  Arab( Semitic White) Americans: Egyptian heritage: Dina Powell, Rami Malek<br>  <br>  compared to:<br>  <br>  MIXED: half Arab(Semitic White)-Egyptian/half Black(Sudanese): Anwar Sadat and King Tut<br>  <br>  Black Americans: Bill Cosby, Denzel Washington, and Will Smith<br>  <br>  Clearly, you can tell the sets of men and one woman, do NOT fit in the same ethnic classification.The late Anwar Sadat, was half Arab (Semitic White)-Egyptian and half Black(Sudanese), many of the same features attributed to King Tut, whom most likely, was also bi-racial.<br>  <br>  When Blacks and Egyptians(Semitic Whites) intermarry, Black traits do dominate(i.e.-Anwar Sadat-(Egyptian Semitic White Father-Black Sudanese mother)).<br>  <br>  Homo sapiens idaltu, (similar to modern Blacks/N*egroid features) whom had Black features and Cro Magnon(similar to modern Whites/Caucasoid features) whom had White features, lived in Africa about the same time-both forms of Homo sapiens, now extinct-modern humans are a subspecies of Homo sapiens-Homo sapiens sapiens to be exact-so you can not say the first humans were Black or White.Also, the indigenous(originating there) peoples of Maghreb(the term is generally applied to all of Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia, but in older Arabic usage pertained only to the area of the three countries between the high ranges of the Atlas Mountains and the Mediterranean Sea). are classified as Aboriginal Caucasoid(resembling/<br>  appearing White/Caucasian).<br>  <br>  The Hamitic THEORY is outdated by DNA testing(haploid groups) and anthropological measurements.The Hamic people have been portrayed from Black to White(Semitic and/or Indo European Aryan) to an admixture. <br>  <br>  HELPFUL LINKS:<br>    <br>  <a href="http://mathildasanthropologyblog.wordpress.com/2008/07/22/the-faces-of-ancient-egypt/" rel="nofollow">http://mathildasanthropologyblog.wordpre...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.geocities.com/enbp/pbs.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/enbp/pbs.html</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/history_in_africa/v032/32.1keita.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/history_in_...</a> (DNA proof)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Gates" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Gat...</a> (Ancient Egyptians delineate THEMSELVES from Black Nubians-King of London-you left out identifying features-the second black- skinned person is a BLACK NUBIAN-Different than the Egyptian-the mural is from Arab Ancient Egyptian-King Seti I)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.catchpenny.org/race.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.catchpenny.org/race.html</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.jrbooksonline.com/PDF_Books/RaceOfAncientEgypt.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.jrbooksonline.com/PDF_Books/R...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://naturescorner.wordpress.com/2008/12/13/where-the-ancient-egyptians-black-or-white/" rel="nofollow">http://naturescorner.wordpress.com/2008/...</a>   (King Tut was MIXED contrary to expert opinion he was Caucasian)|`|3BPI2nMwaa	They were not Africans, so how could you call them black?

There are many things you could do to make a ritual celebration which connects with those ideas.<br>  <br>  a) timing<br>  (i) dawn - to see the sun rise when the day is exactly as long as the night<br>  (ii) noon - when the sun is at its highest point during that day<br>  (iii) dusk - to see the sun set at the end of day<br>  <br>  b) location<br>  (i) a site of historic importance, ideally pre-Columbus<br>  (ii) a raised location - to view the horizon for sunrise/sunset<br>  (iii) a deciduous wood/forest - to appreciate the new leaf growth (blossom, possibly too)<br>  (iv) a meadow full of wild flowers<br>  <br>  c) food / drink<br>  (i) eggs! hard-boiled or devilled<br>  (ii) salads - with plenty of green<br>  (iii) vegetarian only (no dead animals on a day of rebirth)<br>  (iv) wine - especially if you can find "country wine" (made from local wild fruits), rather than wine from distant vineyards<br>  (v) genuine spring water<br>  <br>  d) activities<br>  (i) form a circle - hold hands in a circle, and bow your heads - one of you could say some pertinent words, and/or you could all contemplate silently<br>  (ii) disrobe - be naked as the day you were born, on this day of rebirth<br>  (iii) sing - with guitar or unaccompanied some suitable songs<br>  (iv) make love - on a day of fertility celebrate the precious gift of human sexuality, that allows us firstly to be active all year round, and secondly to have sex for recreation (not just procreation).<br>  (v) plant a seedling - you'd better germinate a seed now!

(a appearance of Christ before he became human).|`|X9rXRNUxaa	Hebrews 7:1  For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him; <br>  :2  To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of peace; <br>  :3  Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God; abideth a priest continually. <br>  :4  Now consider how great this man was, unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils. <br>  :5  And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham: <br>  :6  But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises. <br>  :7  And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better. <br>  :8  And here men that die receive tithes; but there he receiveth them, of whom it is witnessed that he liveth. <br>  :9  And as I may so say, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, payed tithes in Abraham. <br>  :10  For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him. <br>  <br>  The foregoing chapter ended with a repetition of what had been cited once and again before out of Psa_110:4, Jesus, a high priest for ever, after the order of Melchisedec. Now this chapter is as a sermon upon that text; here the apostle sets before them some of the strong meat he had spoken of before, hoping they would by greater diligence be better prepared to digest it.<br>  I. The great question that first offers itself is, Who was this Melchisedec? All the account we have of him in the Old Testament is in Gen_14:18, etc., and in Psa_110:4. Indeed we are much in the dark about him; God has thought fit to leave us so, that this Melchisedec might be a more lively type of him whose generation none can declare. If men will not be satisfied with what is revealed, they must rove about in the dark in endless conjectures, some fancying him to have been an angel, others the Holy Ghost; but,<br>  1. The opinions concerning him that are best worthy our consideration are these three: - (1.) Therabbin, and most of the Jewish writers, think he was Shem the son of Noah who was king and priest to their ancestors, after the manner of the other patriarchs; but it is not probable that he should thus change his name. Besides, we have no account of his settling in the land of Canaan. (2.) Many Christian writers have thought him to be Jesus Christ himself, appearing by a special dispensation and privilege to Abraham in the flesh, and who was known to Abraham by the name Melchisedec, which agrees very well to Christ, and to what is said, Joh_8:56, Abraham saw his day and rejoiced. Much may be said for this opinion, and what is said in Heb_7:3 does not seem to agree with any mere man; but then it seems strange to make Christ a type of himself. (3.) The most general opinion is that he was a Canaanite king, who reigned in Salem, and kept up religion and the worship of the true God; that he was raised to be a type of Christ, and was honoured by Abraham as such.<br>  2. But we shall leave these conjectures, and labour to understand, as far as we can, what is here said of him by the apostle, and how Christ is represented thereby, Heb_7:1-3. (1.) Melchisedec was a king, and so is the Lord Jesus - a king of God's anointing; the government is laid upon his shoulders, and he rules over all for the good of his people. (2.) That he was king of righteousness: his name signifies the righteous king. Jesus Christ is a rightful and a righteous king - rightful in his title, righteous in his government. He is the Lord our righteousness; he has fulfilled all righteousness, and brought in an everlasting righteousness, and he loves righteousness and righteous persons, and hates iniquity. (3.) He was king of Salem, that is, king of peace; first king of righteousness, and after that king of peace. So is our Lord Jesus; he by his righteousness made peace, the fruit of righteousness is peace. Christ speaks peace, creates peace, is our peace-maker. (4.) He was priest of the most high God, qualified and anointed in an extraordinary manner to be his priest among the Gentiles. So is the Lord Jesus; he is the priest of the most high God, and the Gentiles must come to God by him; it is only through his priesthood that we can obtain reconciliation and remission of sin. (5.) He was without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, Heb_7:3. This must not be understood according to the letter; but the scripture has chosen to set him forth as an extraordinary person, without giving us his genealogy, that he might be a fitter type of Christ, who as man was without father, as God without mother; whose priesthood is without descent, did not descen|`|4bc5b87ed73962c0f8d5a68384af5d86aa	This link may help to explain it somewhat.<br>  <a href="http://www.biblestudymanuals.net/melchizedek.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.biblestudymanuals.net/melchiz...</a>|`|kiOjChe6aa	I don't know I never understood the bible|`|kX0T1urdaa	I had to study on this a while back. Fascinating study. Melchizedeck was the King of Salem and also its high priest. He was a Gentile. The first High Priest who took tithes was a Gentile. (Interesting)<br>  <br>  Jesus had to be a high priest of the tribe of Judah, but only Levites were priests. John the Baptist was descended from Aaron the first Jewish high priest. That is why John had to Baptise Him into the ministry. <br>  <br>  Since Jesus was also of the tribe of Judah He is also High Priest to the Gentiles after the order of Melchizedec who was high priest forever. <br>  <br>  Hard to get one's head around.

eVFL3WDkaa	It really all depends on if you can handle all the work. By the looks of your schedule, I see that you are taking a lot and that you are a hard worker. If the Mandarin course is an introductory course, then I suggest you take it if you want. If it isn't, take it some other time. Just because though I bet you are a terrific student, taking on too much at one time can really throw you off with some of your other courses. It all really depends on the load you want for your school year. As I am guessing you are starting from scratch with Mandarin, make sure it is an introductory and not a Level 1 or 2. <br>  I hope I could help you with your decision and good luck with whatever you may decide!|`|WPratgUYaa	It depends on the intensity of the course. For example, the intensity level at my university is very high. You learn hundreds of characters in a matter of weeks and are expected to learn them all by heart. You would need to be able to get a grasp on the loose grammar as quickly as possible and learn as much vocab as possible too. Also, getting the tones perfect can be a bit tricky.<br>  <br>  If you feel that you can pull it off, you should go for it, but if you only want to learn it now as a "background" study, then I'd check how intense the course is going to be. I did night classes in Mandarin and they were nowhere even close to the level of intensity you learn it at university. If it's taught in a more relaxed atmosphere, it would be very beneficial to go ahead and start it. But be warned, it takes a lot of determination to get Chinese even half perfect.<br>  <br>  Good luck with whatever you choose to do.

But here is my two cents. <br>  When you have actual meaningful sex with another person that you have an emotional connection with. You have an endorphin release that is very powerful. Thus the term "laid". Because of the way it makes you feel. Sex with someone you connect to at a deeper level is mental, physical, and sort of spiritual in the sense of the connection. After this happens to you just once, it changes the dynamic of the relationship. It intensifies the relationship or raises the relationship to a higher level. <br>  The same goes for meaningless sex with anyone, yea it feels good but without the connection it is just sex. With this one you do not want more. With the other one you crave it all the time, to the point that you will do without things like food or other daily items just to repeat that endorphin release again.|`|M1yfrNgDaa	its different because your with another person than just by yourself.  having physical contact with another person is just more exhilarating and more sensual.|`|bd89db95a8636a616e42896cf49b6a87aa	Ha!

You can spend time with God on your own, reading His word and praying.

It's how you act towards others, how you talk, etc.  If you "walk the walk."|`|hZjPYyFTaa	Yeah, you can but you do have to go to church and partake in the Catholic rite.

He preached in the synagogues and temples, but he aslo preached in the marketplaces, on the road, and at the well, to name a few.  The famous Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5 thru 7) was delivered outdoors.  He preached from a boat on the Sea of Galilee to people standing on the shore.|`|AA11703455	Basically, if the only place you practice your religion is in church, it is a useless religion. <br>  <br>  It should be a part of your life, constantly. <br>  <br>  Paul speaks of changing one self because of the message received by us.<br>  <br>  Eph 4:20 But you did not learn Christ in this way, <br>  <br>   Eph 4:21 if indeed you have heard Him and have been taught in Him, just as truth is in Jesus, <br>  <br>   Eph 4:22 that, in reference to your former manner of life, you lay aside the old self, which is being corrupted in accordance with the lusts of deceit, <br>  <br>   Eph 4:23 and that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind, <br>  <br>   Eph 4:24 and put on the new self, which in {the likeness of} God has been created in righteousness and holiness of the truth. <br>  <br>  New American Standard Bible. <br>  <br>  True, you don't have a priest following you around, but your conscience is always with you. You must train it to listen to the instructions of our master Jesus.|`|B6r56Nr7aa	Yes. I've been on a Lifeteen Youth Retreat with my church where THOUSANDS of CATHOLIC teens go with hundreds of priests. We worshipped, had Mass, confessions, lectures, all of it.|`|yXx1nB0Qaa	Isn't that the whole idea, more important to practise being a good Catholic when nobodies watching. Shouldn't you follow and practise your faith every were you go or is it the Catholic practise of doing whatever you want as long as you go to confession and get those sins written off.|`|AA10034051	Yes.

Personally, if I were you and truly wanted to know the answer, I'd pick my self up and go there in person to be informed.  However, it may just be that they are busy and under no rush to fill this position.

DiIAaFgzaa	If I remember correctly, he was 40 years old when he was exiled from Egypt, 80 when he returned to free the Israelites, and then they wandered in the wilderness for another 40 years before they entered the land of Canaan.

That would make him about 120 years old when he died.|`|WjRqYf6naa	One hundred and twenty.<br>  <br>  Deu 34:7  And Moses was an hundred and twenty years old when he died: his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated.|`|X9rXRNUxaa	Exo 2:15  Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian: and he sat down by a well. <br>  <br>  Moses was about 40 when this happened.<br>  <br>  Exo 3:4  And when the LORD saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said, Here am I. <br>  Exo 4:20  And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them upon an ***, and he returned to the land of Egypt: and Moses took the rod of God in his hand. <br>  <br>  Moses was about 80 when this happened.<br>  <br>  The years of the life of Moses are remarkably divided into three forties: the first forty he spent as a prince in Pharaoh's court, the second a shepherd in Midian, the third a king in Jeshurun; so changeable is the life of men, especially the life of good men. He had now finished his second forty, when he received his commission to bring Israel out of Egypt. Note, Sometimes it is long before God calls his servants out of that work which of old he designed them for, and has been graciously preparing them for. Moses was born to be Israel's deliverer, and yet not a word is said of it to him till he is eighty years of age.<br>  <br>  Moses the servant of the Lord died. God told him he must not go over Jordan, and, though at first he prayed earnestly for the reversing of the sentence yet God's answer to his prayer sufficed him, and now he spoke no more of that matter.<br>  He was old, it is true, but he had not yet attained to the years of the life of his fathers; his father Amram lived to be 137; his grandfather Kohath 133; his great grandfather Levi 137. And why must Moses, whose life was more serviceable than any of theirs, die at 120, especially since he felt not the decays of age, but was as fit for service as ever?

The day seems ordinary enough. Cyclists maneuver through traffic, and orange poppies bloom on dry brown hills near Linde’s office on the Stanford University campus. But everything here, right down to the photons lighting the scene after an eight-minute jaunt from the sun, bears witness to an extraordinary fact about the universe: Its basic properties are uncannily suited for life. Tweak the laws of physics in just about any way and—in this universe, anyway—life as we know it would not exist.<br>  <br>  Consider just two possible changes. Atoms consist of protons, neutrons, and electrons. If those protons were just 0.2 percent more massive than they actually are, they would be unstable and would decay into simpler particles. Atoms wouldn’t exist; neither would we. If gravity were slightly more powerful, the consequences would be nearly as grave. A beefed-up gravitational force would compress stars more tightly, making them smaller, hotter, and denser. Rather than surviving for billions of years, stars would burn through their fuel in a few million years, sputtering out long before life had a chance to evolve. There are many such examples of the universe’s life-friendly properties—so many, in fact, that physicists can’t dismiss them all as mere accidents.<br>  <br>  “We have a lot of really, really strange coincidences, and all of these coincidences are such that they make life possible,” Linde says.|`|B7TFX4wUaa	It doesn't make sense.

I'm actually half-Mexican and part of my family migrated here from Mexico many years ago. The other half of my family is Italian and migrated here from Italy. My fiancee is from the Philippines and moved here when he was 13 with his family. In fact, I can name numerous people I know that moved here from another country. America always has been and always will be a land of opportunity for people living in other countries. People will come here as long as there is a better standard of living and opportunities. Since a lot of Latin American countries have appalling living conditions as well as other horrible conditions such as wages, etc, moving here is the "gleam of hope" for many Hispanics. <br>  <br>  I sense a slight bias against Hispanics in your question. You have to remember at some point every single one of our ancestors came here from another country.|`|hUyIeCVlaa	Mary Jane your comment was ignorant.<br>  <br>  Actually I read that article and I remember it saying that by 2042 Whites will no longer make up 50+ % of the US population and that minorities will outnumber them, that means Hispanics will still be a minority. Now lets say that which you stated does happen, I doubt it will seriously matter because<br>  <br>  1.) Right now America is about 60+ percent White (Non-Hispanic). You can go to parts of the Southeast and places out West and the Midwest and they won't have many White people there if any at all.<br>  <br>  2.) America will remain the way it is. The Southwest will be majority Hispanic, The Midwest will be majority White/Black, The Southeast will be majority Black, the Northeast (excluding big cities) will be Majority White, and the Northwest will probably go to the Asians. <br>  <br>  3.) By then they will not count you as a Hispanic alone but rather as Black or White Hispanic. Then again that will swing more in favor of the Whites.<br>  <br>  4.) There are states like Texas and California where Whites are the minority but you can go to places in those states which are 90 percent White.<br>  <br>  5.) Asians make up 1 percent of the population right? Well, go to Seattle and San Francisco and tell me whats up lol.<br>  <br>  <br>   I know what is going through your head. You are thinking that just because Spanish people are in the majority you will HAVE to learn Spanish. Well we didn't have to learn German despite most Americans being from German descent. Most Spanish people will assimilate. You may ALSO think that there will be more gangs, I will tell you right now that I have Hispanic friends that absolutely hate those gangs that give their ethnicity a bad name. I had the same feeling but you see, I was around the wrong type of Hispanics, I spent too much time in the Bronx. When you are around the right type of Hispanic people you will see that they are a great ethnicity and are people with some of the greatest character in the world, you may not know it right now but soon you will find what I say to be true.<br>  <br>  The growth rate will stop though, because of the economy no illegals want to come here that much anymore. Depending on immigration laws and what not, it may slow down. Honestly, Asians are what we need to be seeing. They already make up 56 percent of the world population and grow by BILLIONS each year. Most are flooding into Europe and from there they will come here. I predict that by 2050, Asians will make up 70 percent of the US population. A smarter nation on the way perhaps?

1GCLKkpTaa	Dear Sisyphus<br>  <br>  This is an interesting question and most of the people are in a state of denial and have defended their faith, and have answered on the expected lines. Let me tell you real reason why Indian religions, especially, Jainism and Buddhism do not have a violent history and do not inspire their adherents to indulge in violence:<br>  <br>  1. Their (Jain and Buddhist) Gods have not declared that: “I am the only truth and the only savior. Submit to my will.” <br>  <br>  2. The good and moral behavior does not depend on some commandment of GOD, but rather on certain cosmic principles and laws that are applicable to everyone – Even Buddha and Mahavira had to go thru it.<br>  <br>  3. In other religions, it is believed that you may indulge in violence (although it is not good) but if it for defending faith, or if you seek forgiveness, then divine grace can wipe off all violence. On the other hand, in Jain and Buddhist philosophies, divine grace does not work. The law of Karma is supreme (like newtons third law of motion : to an every action, there is equal and opposite reaction) If you indulge in violence, you will get bad karmas, whatever may be the reason. No divine grace can save you. Hence “non-violence” is the supreme religion.<br>  <br>  4. Eastern philosophies believe that there is some element of truth in all philosophies. Jainism has philosophy of “Anekantavada” or multiplicity of view points. See this link on wikipedia :<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anekantavada" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anekantavad...</a><br>  <br>  5. Eastern religions do not have concepts like: “Pagans, heretics, kafirs, infidels, blasphemy” as do the Abrahamic religions.<br>  <br>  Let me talk of Sam Harris here. Author Harris advises admirers of Martin Luther King, Jr., that "the doctrine of Jainism is an objectively better guide for becoming like Martin Luther King, Jr., than the doctrine of Christianity is." (Sam Harris, Letter to a Christian Nation, p. 12). He goes on to explain that Martin Luther King, Jr. was influenced by Gandhi, who, he claims, got his doctrine from the Jains, polytheists to whom this atheist has attached himself.<br>   <br>  "Once again, we need look no further than the Jains: Mahavira, the Jain patriarch, surpassed the morality of the Bible with a single sentence: 'Do not injure, abuse, oppress, enslave, insult, torment, torture, or kill any creature or living being.'" (Sam Harris, Letter to a Christian Nation, pp. 22-23).<br>  <br>  Emphasis on Creature or Living being.....not simply Human beings.<br>   <br>  I trust this helps.|`|xo4iux9gaa	christians do not commit violence against innocents......get an education please....and LEARN what  the Bible teaches....|`|3m00lxxuaa	My God doesn't want me to cause violence towards the innocent, and any Christian(or so called) who claims he does, needs to read his Word then.|`|vnEdfxeVaa	If you want to  blame  God for reveling the jihad verses because some followers will abuse it then you have to blame man for having capital punishment in their laws because there is possibility that some innocent people will be executed and you should blame man for making jails because some innocent people will end up there .<br>  <br>  Buddhism doesn't  have any laws so please don't compare them to us .

Basically Islam does provide for reasonable treatment of people who respect the civil law, and the Christian religion promotes civilized behavior within its own testament. It appears to promote the opposite by including the Jewish book within its own.<br>  <br>  But the reality is that the churches launched into a struggle for control, a struggle that substantially ignored the principles of the New Testament and borrowed more from the thinking of the Roman empire. Well, the Christian principles have come through occasionally in the peace churches, Mennonite, Hutterite, Quaker, Doukabhor, where the principle common doctrine was non-violence.<br>  <br>  But Christians have mostly stayed with the empire building thoughts of the  Roman Empire. <br>  <br>  Over long periods a lot of the Islamic community has felt it was  promoting the peace, Salaam, of Islam. It has not always succeeded in persuading people it has shared the earth with of the same. But like Christians, many Muslims have acted like  empire builders. And of course many times those who have acted that way have been punished by Islamic courts. They had brought disrepute on the good name of Isalm. But all too often, nobody ever took those people to court for redress. The concept that even soldiers on a field of battle must  be there to promote peace, and can be punished for misdeeds ought to have been a great step forward compared with what had gone before.<br>  <br>  But when soldiers actually find themselves in a battle, no matter how their religion guides them, it seems that they become task driven rather than principle driven.|`|BQ6WmoHiaa	I think you're living dangerously in thinking that Jainism and Buddhism can't be abused as Christianity has been abused.<br>  <br>  I also think you're in deep trouble - as most are - when you consider it God's fault that humans kill and rob each other in His name.  Just shows a lack of accountability so typical in people these days.<br>  <br>  Besides, if you are under the impression that what happened in recent centuries due to Christianity can't happen with Jainism or Buddhism then you haven't the first bit of understanding of history nor of why people do the things they do.<br>  <br>  Your first flaw?

Verse from Surah Taubah<br>  <br>  The following verse from Surah Taubah is very often quoted by critics of Islam, to show that Islam promotes violence, bloodshed and brutality:<br>  <br>  "Kill the mushriqeen (pagans, polytheists, kuffar) where ever you find them."<br>  [Al-Qur’an 9:5]<br>  2.    Context of verse is during battlefield<br>  <br>  Critics of Islam actually quote this verse out of context. In order to understand the context, we need to read from verse 1 of this surah. It says that there was a peace treaty between the Muslims and the Mushriqs (pagans) of Makkah. This treaty was violated by the Mushriqs of Makkah. A period of four months was given to the Mushriqs of Makkah to make amends. Otherwise war would be declared against them. Verse 5 of Surah Taubah says:<br>  <br>  "But when the forbidden months are past, then fight and slay the Pagans wherever ye find them, and seize them, beleaguer them, and lie in wait for them in every stratagem (of war); but if they repent, and establish regular prayers and practise regular charity, then open the way for them: for Allah is oft-forgiving, Most merciful."<br>  [Al-Qur’an 9:5]<br>  <br>  This verse is quoted during a battle.<br>  3.    Example of war between America and Vietnam<br>  <br>  We know that America was once at war with Vietnam. Suppose the President of America or the General of the American Army told the American soldiers during the war: "Wherever you find the Vietnamese, kill them". Today if I say that the American President said, "Wherever you find Vietnamese, kill them" without giving the context, I will make him sound like a butcher. But if I quote him in context, that he said it during a war, it will sound very logical, as he was trying to boost the morale of the American soldiers during the war.<br>  <br>  4.     Verse 9:5 quoted to boost morale of Muslims during battle<br>  <br>  Similarly in Surah Taubah chapter 9 verse 5 the Qur’an says, "Kill the Mushriqs where ever you find them", during a battle to boost the morale of the Muslim soldiers. What the Qur’an is telling Muslim soldiers is, don’t be afraid during battle; wherever you find the enemies kill them.<br>  5.    Shourie jumps from verse 5 to verse 7<br>  <br>  Arun Shourie is one of the staunchest critics of Islam in India. He quotes the same verse, Surah Taubah chapter 9 verse 5 in his book ‘The World of Fatwahs’, on page 572. After quoting verse 5 he jumps to verse 7 of Surah Taubah. Any sensible person will realise that he has skipped verse 6.<br>  6.    Surah Taubah chapter 9 verse 6 gives the answer <br>  <br>  Surah Taubah chapter 9 verse 6 gives the answer to the allegation that Islam promotes violence, brutality and bloodshed. It says:<br>  <br>  "If one amongst the pagans ask thee for asylum,grant it to him, so that he may hear the word of Allah; and then escort him to where he can be secure that is because they are men without knowledge."<br>  [Al-Qur’an 9:6]<br>  <br>  The Qur’an not only says that a Mushriq seeking asylum during the battle should be granted refuge, but also that he should be escorted to a secure place. In the present international scenario, even a kind, peace-loving army General, during a battle, may let the enemy soldiers go free, if they want peace. But which army General will ever tell his soldiers, that if the enemy soldiers want peace during a battle, don’t just let them go free, but also escort them to a place of security? <br>  <br>  This is exactly what Allah (swt) says in the Glorious Qur’an to promote peace in the world.|`|M1kJZnmmaa	Violence and repression are tools used by the state , and often in the name of Religion .

The people i.e. the Clergy, the Kings that influenced the Clergy and the corrupt clergy that obeyed the kings for greed etc., TWISTED the words of God. And thus caused a lot of blood shed. They did not fight the oppressors BUT slayed the weak and innocent.<br>  <br>  The MAIN problem is that they did it in the name of God.<br>  <br>  While if u look at the Quran, it NEVER says, fight and slay the innocent, the peaceful. NEVER EVER, does it say so. It ALWAYS advocates to STRIVE against the "OPPRESSORS". <br>  <br>  Forget about the media for the time being, and forget the black history of Tyrant kings and dynasties. JUST hold the book and study it and see if it really advocates injustice in any sense. Does it advocate fighting with peaceful people. OR does it say to ENFORCE brutal rules on other people.<br>  <br>  It DOES NOT !!!!<br>  <br>  Take the case of Jews and Christians and Muslims.<br>  <br>  Do u ever realize that ALL of them have been PUNISHED by the same God. The SAME GOD, cursed them and punished them very heavily. The same God divided them into three different religions (although they started as the one Abrahmic religion). And then further subdivided them into many sects. And caused them to taste each other's tyranny.<br>  <br>  Can u infer, the core reasons for such an act of God. WHY did HE really punish them in such a way??<br>  <br>  I can tell u that ONE of the reasons was that they acquired the path of Hypocrisy.

By religion you mean including God, His Word, the inspired articles of His Word (Bible, Torah, Koran, etc) and his followers?<br>  <br>  I for one believe God to be perfect. After that, everything else, including the written articles, are suspect.<br>  This is because they are written by man. Whether or not inspired by God, unless I hear Jesus preach, I cannot be sure what was written and reproduced hundreds and hundreds of years later is an exact, untainted reproduction of his preaching.<br>  <br>  There are plenty of things in the Bible which seem quite barbaric, even unbelieveable. But that's another topic altogether.<br>  What my point is, is that we humans are an opportunistic lot who will utilize any possible means to achieve an end, be it selfish, selfless or maniacal.<br>  Even if it means plucking a couple of juice, choice words out of context from the Bible, Koran, Torah to justify the slaughter of innocents.<br>  <br>  Since you speak in the sense of a non-spiritual side (meaning spoken from the context that God isn't really part of the equation because you do no believe He exists), I shall address the question from that aspect. <br>  I used to be atheist, and I questioned the same things you are questioning now.<br>  <br>  You have to look at the demographics and cultural history of the times when the religion was revealed as well.<br>  Buddhism, first and foremost isn't really a religion per se, it is a set of beliefs which do not address the issue of a God and more of a set of principles and thought processes which aid in a person's knowledge of Truth and Life.<br>  I can be Christian and still possess Buddhist principles, save for the reincarnation part. Buddha was raised with Hindu beliefs of reincarnation and thus his principles were based upon the assumption humans would reincarnate.<br>  Today, most Buddhists are Asian - concentrated in mostly Chinese ethnic and Indian ethnic people. Traditionally, Indian and Chinese people have never really be people of conquest, instead, choosing to brawl it out over petty border and territorial conflicts.<br>  Jainism, similarly, has a small following and never really took off. It focused on the fact that anyone can achieve God-consciousness and its very principles preach unconditional non-violence of any living thing.<br>  <br>  Both were revealed in a country where outward conquest was not practised and spread in neighbouring countries were again, outward conquests were not really practised.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, <br>  even before Christianity and Islam were revealed the Middle East had already been a hotbed of tribal conflicts between various warring civilisations and countries.<br>  Christianity, Islam and Judaism itself preaches not of non-violence as the main principle but a personal and collective relationship with God, not so much so a "I won't harm a fly and meditate 12 hours a day" focus.<br>  <br>  Even after these religions were revealed. Yes, things improved - or declined - depending on the turbulent recesses of social life and politics between the civilisations there - but a religion doesn't wipe the world of bad things it simply places the responsibility of it on the people's shoulders.<br>  Where these people were worshipping sun and moon gods, then converting, they merely tossed out the sun and moon gods and affixed a cross or a woven Islamic script over the altar to worship - few people really cared for or understood the meaning of the texts, not to mention the complexity of shouldering their collective fates upon prayer, faith and good deeds.<br>  As with most religions, just because a god existed and was revealed didn't mean that "poof!" we were back in garden Eden sipping unfermented grape juice because of that 'truth'. It took and probably still takes a united effort to keep the original intended path and meaning because we humans are lazy, forgetful, procrastinating and very, very self-serving.<br>  <br>  In the Mid East, where conquest had always meant conquest regardless of whichever god of the week they were worshipping, conquest went on as usual.<br>  Christianity and Islam became convenient banners to wave as propaganda machines. And this was written in Western history. Thus your knowledge in the conquests.<br>  <br>  But Eastern history you probably know less of because of the typical Western ignorance of Eastern history.<br>  In India, wars were waged by Buddhist warlords who were described, ironically, as kind and compassionate Buddhists, but yet as apt to slice off the heads of his enemies in the battlefield.<br>  In China, similarly.<br>  <br>  But the history of India and China never really recorded any outward conquests (no Indian colonisation of Britain or Rome), ditto with China. <br>  <br>  Lets move on to recent past and now.<br>  We're living in an increasingly westernised world. Everything now is influenced by a very western view of 'human rights' and violence is a very central theme.<br>  In Tibet, a Buddhist country, had an incredibly long history of slavery, serfdom and violence toward serfs - who had no rights, even over their own sexuality. They were raped by monks and their 'owners' because they had no 'rights'.<br>  Later, China "invaded" and outlawed serfdom, these 'peaceful' Buddhists rioted, killed, burnt, pillaged - all in the name of 'peaceful Buddhism'.<br>  China isn't so slick, I know - but what would you expect Buddhists to react to oppression? What comes to mind for me is mediation, fasting and silent peace protests befitting the principles of Buddhism.<br>  No, it was killed or be killed.<br>  <br>  This is a human trait and no matter what religion espouses what, humans will always be up in arms as the first reaction.<br>  Religion simply teaches them to think before they strike.<br>  <br>  I believe that we as humans can choose - we can choose to use and abuse religion, we can choose to ignore it, or we can choose to be the best we can to ourselves and our fellow man, that way, regardless of whatever religion we choose, we ensure it is practiced the right way.<br>  <br>  In the end, we as humans choose, not the religion. I believe this is what God wants. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Jenova.

By the time the Church finally had the power to shut down the temples of Zeus, they almost weren't worth shutting down. <br>  <br>  Christianity has survived Nero, Caligula, the Arian Heresy, the Fall of Rome, The Angles, the Saxons, the Goths and Visigoths,  Islam, The Vikings, The Great Schism, the Avignon Papacy, the Borgia Popes, The Mongols, the Black Death, the Reformation, the Age of Reason, the French Revolution, Napoleon, the Kulturkampf, World War 1, The Depression, the Nazis, the Communists, the Stalinist, the Maoists, the Cold War, MTV, Hugh Hefner, and Richard Dawkins. <br>  <br>  And Zeus lost out to a Jewish Carpenter?|`|326c72d56b3c29d35b1fb5cda316d143aa	I would echo the words of the Apostle Paul...Though there are Lords many and Gods many(called such,by the world) for us(Christians),there is one God(the Father) and one Lord(Jesus Christ,his Son)..memory paraphrase...<br>  <br>  I defend the right of all,to believe whatever they wish...I will continue however,to defend the Gospel of Jesus Christ...I personally believe that Jesus Christ is God and the only hope,for humanity...|`|evStsOQiaa	The only way zeus could be real is if he wrote The Mosaic Laws, which I doubt he did or else there would be no difference between the Greeks and Jews.|`|HK4cW2Vcaa	People claim alot of things, that dosen't mean I believe them.|`|3oNcHdgCaa	Hey, how dare you follow a different sky fairy than us!|`|1a10b6b1127b07e424d93d828a3444d8aa	Larry R> I think you need to check you history<br>  <br>  Christianity came about LONG after the greek gods were gone..supplanted by the Roman Gods.  Also the reason why Christianity survived..was because Emperor Constantine mandated it as the official Roman religion in order to unify the vast empire (although he remained a pagan)<br>  <br>  After the fall of the Roman Empire, religion was the one thing in common for most parts of the world and so in order for each noble to get a legitimate claim to power they all said they were the true heir to Rome and the Church.  Charlemagne himself did so and converted people by the sword.  He killed thousands of people in order to force everyone to be christian.|`|hzMpdFFBaa	There are plenty of Europeans who do believe that Zeus is "real." They are reconstructionist Hellenic pagans.  If someone claimed that Zeus was "real," I would just accept that Zeus is the name and form they choose to associate with "God."  Zeus actually means heavenly, from the Sanskrit world Dyaus, from which we get the Latin word Deus--which we translate as" God." Jupiter (Roman Zeus) literally means "Heavenly Father"  in which "Ju" is etymologically related to "Dyaus" and piter is related to the words pater and pitre (father in Latin and Sanskrit) Sound familiar?  Some people say that Constantine was a devotee of Jupiter-Zeus and in converting to Christianity, he was equating Jesus with Zeus.|`|zKOZ8Gafaa	I would want evidence.  The Bible provides evidence that Christ was real and that God was his Father.  Google how many hundreds of prophecies have come true in the Bible.  Coincidence?  I think not.

GgVufxlHaa	Ugh I can't stand people lie that- they think they're the 'life of the party' but really they're just arrogant, annoying and noisy. I used to work for a catering company (family business) and we encountered many of these drunk party-goers who thought socially acceptable behavior was getting as hammered as possible at the expense of the bride and groom and them acting like a complete idiot. <br>  We actually had one wedding where a woman stood up on a table and began dancing (mind you this is a fairly high-class place, with not so high class guests sometimes), and when that wasn't attracting her enough attention, she tried to swing from our chandeliers! Her equally drunk husband then grabbed the mike from the DJ, beer glass in hand, trying to sing a song to the bride and groom- it might not have even been so bad if the song wasn't "I'm Lonely" by The White Stripes...not that couple's shining moment.|`|zHN43P4Haa	They were just singing loudly.  I could see if they were saying foul language or making rude gestures then that would be very bad and i would have kicked them out. I also think it is a bit odd that a jukebox was providing the music for the wedding.  I have never been to a wedding that did not have live music.  I guess this wedding sorta had live music provided by the undesirables band.|`|K2dNndE2aa	if anyone gets drunk at my wedding, especially if they make a scene, they're getting kicked out! <br>  <br>  i plan on having no alcohol at my wedding, no one i know drinks, even occasionally or a glass of wine here to there. thinking about champagne though, but yeah. definitely not getting drunk. my dad was an alcoholic and ruined most of my life, alcohol isn't ruining my wedding either, lol.|`|WeR0E56eaa	intoxication|`|68XKVDU2aa	they were probably too happy and just lost control|`|kL8BzsBNaa	Depending on the wedding.

rh5vbol9aa	Dear Chairman of the IMF,  <br>  <br>   I have been received an e-mail in july 2008, which had mentioned me as a winner of $ 400.000. I beleive in it. Because the style of the letters was very kind and persuasive. The claims agent requested from me sums different kinds of necessary supplies. And ? used my credit cards for cash money and ? got loans from the banks. I had been sent to him, a Nigerian and a Swiss bank totaly $ 5.500. I had  not sent the last sum only, which was $ 1.200. In the last letter I suggested to him $ 50.000, because I had not any source already at that time to find $ 1.200. And now I am still waiting $ 350.000. During the intervening time I've searched the origin of the Austalian Lottery and recognized that ?'ve been swindled.<br>  <br>      This is the story of my lottery-playing. <br>      I have been translated a book from hungarian to turkish (The History of the World Literature)(900 p.) and its published. With that translation fee ? paid my debts. But it was not enough. A week ago one of my bank have been agreed to give me a new loan. I've spent aIl of that money for my debts. But now ? still need 2.500 Tl=$1.500. I had been translated the year before an another book (about the Ottoman history, 400 p.) too from hungarian. And it is now in a state publisher. Probably 6 monts later it will be published and my lottery-adventure will be end.<br>  <br>     I present to the chairman of the IMF with respect!<br>     Kind regards<br>  <br>  P.S.

QF4W5aYRaa	God is just, righteous, truth, and love. Sometimes tough love. Never have found the word "nice" in any of The Bibles I use. Hosea 4:6; as you know tells us that "My people perish for lack of knowledge", and Proverb 1: 7; states that "the beginning of wisdom and knowledge is the fear of The Lord", and I then ask myself, what is that, and the one The Lord brings me to first is Proverb 8:13; "The fear of The Lord is to hate evil". I attempt to point out that we have become too "tolerant" of what goes on in our nation today.

PtIyg9Qqaa	They are both (today) paper and ink.  The Qur'an, if written in Arabic, its original language, is read from right to left.  The Bible, if written in its ("Old" Testament) original language, Hebrew, is written from right to left.<br>  <br>  The big differences are not physical, though.  They are spiritual.  Read a few pages of each and see how different they are spiritually.<br>  <br>  Mohammed chose one of the many gods of the nomadic people of Arabia to be his "almighty," but it was the moon god, Allah, that he chose to change into the form that he wished to make him.  This is not the God of the Bible.  Despite the wars and killings told about in the Bible, the true Creator is a God of love, "not willing that any should perish."  But he is a jealous God, not willing to share worship with another.  He is NOT "tolerant" of other religions.|`|xo4iux9gaa	Those who say Allah is the same as the God of the Bible are simply ignorant of both the Scripture and what the Quran teaches.<br>  <br>  The Quran says: "God has no Son" and forces its adherents to believe God has no son, thus directly attempting to nullify the Gospel of Jesus Christ. <br>   Quran denies also that Jesus is the Christ/Messiah. <br>  <br>   The Scripture says explicitly: "Who is a liar but he that denies that Jesus is the Christ? He is anti-Christ, that denies the Father and the Son. HE THAT DENIES THE SON,  THE SAME HAS NOT THE FATHER". (I John 2:22)<br>  <br>  Don't be deceived.

But of course you can find translations of it in any language, including English, which would be read from left to right.<br>  I'm also pretty sure the Bible (when including the Old and New Testaments) is longer than the Qur'an. The Bible tends to be printed on really thin pages and the Qur'an on ones of normal thickness, so they seem to be the same size.<br>  <br>  (Fierce: if you're going to insist on the "correct" spelling, you should know that it's Qur'an, not Qu'ran ;) But there really is no correct spelling, since it's just a transcription of an Arabic word.)|`|U7sBZKUuaa	Arabic reads right to left, and so does Hebrew, but this is not typically preserved when they are translated into English.|`|1VaH8D3Raa	To the reader there is <br>  .<br>  To the other people it is just a way that people are<br>  .<br>  Taught how to think and feel<br>  .|`|UinOWcMUaa	<a href="http://www.allaboutreligion.org/islam-vs-christianity-faq.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.allaboutreligion.org/islam-vs...</a>|`|qCBWlmnMaa	Yes, the Quran does read right to left which may seem different from any other book you've read.

QE2hNXeCaa	The image will fade away in time. I don't know how recent this is but what is happening to you is the impression of the moment, you were trying not to see the body and you caught a glimpse. Because you were afraid or uncomfortable to begin with the image got stuck in your head and it will roam around for a bit but keep busy and try to understand that what you saw was a perfectly normal human body, there is nothing mystical or scary about it. If you ever find yourself in a similar situation it is better to actually contemplate the body for a little bit, it's not morbid, it makes the body more real and you can cope with the whole image better than having just a fragment.|`|cXXJVz64aa	Just remember that death is a normal part of life.

God never intended death to be "engineered" into our genes. That came about by the sin of Adam and Eve. <br>  <br>  I also have the same reaction to seeing my friends dead. One really bad year, one of our friends died at a hospice hospital, and we got there just as she let out her last breath. To see my friend laying there is still a hard memory, a painful one. <br>  <br>  Just a month later, another friend died, and she was 8 1/2 months pregnant. They tried to save the baby but he died too. I didn't know that they had an open casket, and there she was, with her dead little one in her arms. <br>  <br>  My heart knows that death is an enemy, it robs us of our family and friends. The scriptures also calls it our enemy. <br>  <br>  The comfort that I have from the Bible is that all 3 of them will be in the resurrection, and I will be able to have them in my life again. <br>  <br>  Paul says at Corinthians<br>  20?However, now Christ has been raised up from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep [in death]. 21?For since death is through a man, resurrection of the dead is also through a man.<br>  <br>  22?For just as in Adam all are dying, so also in the Christ all will be made alive. 23?But each one in his own rank: Christ the firstfruits, afterward those who belong to the Christ during his presence. 24?Next, the end, when he hands over the kingdom to his God and Father, when he has brought to nothing all government and all authority and power. 25?For he must rule as king until [God] has put all enemies under his feet. <br>  <br>  26?As the last enemy, death is to be brought to nothing. <br>  <br>  Jesus said this:<br>  <br>  ” 25?Jesus said to her: “I am the resurrection and the life. He that exercises faith in me, even though he dies, will come to life; 26?and everyone that is living and exercises faith in me will never die at all. Do you believe this?” 27?She said to him: “Yes, Lord; I have believed that you are the Christ the Son of God, the One coming into the world.”<br>  <br>  You experinced a natural reaction. The grandfather was special to many in your family. Even if it had been years, the last sight of him is locked in your thoughts. <br>  <br>  But think of this. <br>  <br>  If you could be at his resurrection, wouldn't that sight be the grandest thing, to see him alive, healthy. That would wipe that last sight of him from your heart and mind. <br>  <br>  That is why Revelation 21 describes a world that many have never thought of. Verse 4?And he will wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore. The former things have passed away.”<br>  <br>  That is the future for both those that you have lost and my friends too.

AA11238146	There are several kinds of jihad or struggle. The struggle with inner desires, the struggle to achieve, raise a family etc. Then there is the jihad fee sybil Allah (jihad in the path of Allah) that is defined in the Qur'an. Sometimes the verse will use the word qatala (which is stronger) instead of jahada. <br>  <br>  Not all Muslims blow up things, yet "jihad in the cause of Allah" "jihad fee sybil Allah" is "fard ayn" "compulsory duty" for all Muslims. Why? There are rules from the Quran for combattive jihad. <br>  <a href="http://www.notislam.com/id8.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.notislam.com/id8.html</a><br>  <br>  Among Muslims there are those who:<br>  a) jihad in the path of Allah with their wealth and their lives (including those who sit at home but give asylum to mujahidin 4:74) = true Muslim<br>  b) those who sit at home (and do not give asylum to mujahidin or jihad in the path of Allah)<br>  c) the handicapped (does not count as a category)<br>  d) apostates (does not count as a category because they are not even considered to be Muslims and may even be killed like Sunni kill Shia)<br>  <br>  In the Quran 4:95 it says:<br>  The two are not equal: those who sit at home (and do not join the fighting) _ unless they have a reason; they are handicapped _ and those who [jihad] strive hard in the path of Allah with their wealth and lives. Over those who sit at home, Allah has excelled and elevated to a higher honor those who strive hard with their wealth and lives. Compared to those who sit at home, Allah will award a far greater reward to those who wage a struggle.<br>  <br>  8:74 Those who believed, left their homes and waged a struggle for the cause of Allah as well as those who helped and protected them are really the true believers. There is forgiveness for them and a generous rewards.<br>  <br>  49:15 The (true) believers are actually those who believe in Allah and His messenger and then do not waver (and do not entertain doubts). With their wealth and their lives, they strive for the sake of Allah. Such are truly the sincere ones<br>  <br>  Yes, indeed, "Where are the moderate Muslims?"<br>  Killing (qitl) and jihad in the cause of Allah is the hallmark of true Muslim believers. It is not a matter of moderate or fanatic. It is the distinction of a true believer or a rebel. <br>  <br>  4:76 Those who believe, do fight for the sake of Allah, while those who reject faith (Islam) fight for the cause of ‘taghut’ _ (all rebellious forces aligned against Allah). So, fight against the minions of Shaitan. Feeble indeed is the wily guile of Shaitan! <br>  <br>  8:60 Acquire and prepare all the (military) strength you can muster, including the finest trained horses (and other military wares). With that, you would daunt and deter the enemies of Allah _ your enemies, and others besides them. You do not know them, but Allah (surely) knows them. Anything you spend in the path of Allah will be returned to you in full. You will not be wronged (at all).<br>  <br>  2:216 Warfare (for the sake of Allah) has been ordained for you, though it is not something you like. It is possible that the thing you detest might just (turn out to) be good for you. It is possible that the thing you like (the most) might in reality be bad for you. Allah knows (all) while you know nothing (at all)!|`|1097f970c57009683aae8f78528bc221aa	I guess you are quite ok with this question.I don't know how they interpret 'Jihad' but i'm sure killing innocent lives is CERTAINLY NOT JIHAD. Jihad is for defending yourself and country, like they can go bomb up zionist tank that are attacking lebanon . Thats jihad. Jihad is not about attacking other countries .If you go and attack a country and torture its civillian ,making innocents suffer nowadays ,you're considers as BARBARIC INTRUDERS|`|083e21d6524022b85f06e54be16967b5aa	I'm not muslim, and I don't know what 'jihad' means let alone how to interpret it.|`|4c0c456f2d638bc34b4300ce987441c9aa	To my knowledge, the concept of Jihad has been corrupted by terrorists.  There way is not the way of Islam.  It is the way of extremists corrupting a religion while committing violent acts.|`|e9ba635e485c3d4cef5b66d60b332721aa	As I understand it, Jihad is making war against unbelievers|`|f32a960319cb87da11f3c41c9d9846dbaa	There are two types of Jihad, the greater Jihad, "al-jihad al-akbar", and lesser Jihad, "al-jihad al-asghar". The greater Jihad is a struggle within oneself to combat evil and make oneself pure and good. The lesser Jihad is an outward Jihad towards the world around you. The lesser Jihad is the one that is often confused with Holy War by extemists. <br>  <br>  There are also five kinds of Jihad accepted by Scholars: <br>  Jihad of the Heart: an inner struggle between good and evil<br>  Jihad of the Tongue: struggle against evil through speech and writing<br>  Jihad of the Pen: struggle against evil through the study of Islam<br>  Jihad of the Hands: struggle against evil through ones actions (good deeds)<br>  Jihad of the Sword: fighting in the way of Allah (protecting one's home from unbelievers or evildoers<br>  <br>  The best of Jihad can be done through example to others. ONce one has fullfilled their inner Jihad, they may got to the outer Jihad. They can do this through good actions, good words and good thoughts.<br>  <br>  Perhaps if someone were to actually educate these terrorists on Islam, they would be true Jihadis.|`|22870b9fa74667f35d8c85caa8621251aa	Jihad is a holy struggle with the enemies of Islam . Self protection when enemies STARTS ATTACKS FIRST..<br>  <br>  So USA is provoking muslims to protect themself. So Jihad is justified<br>  <br>  I think every muslims know what jihad means.|`|272018bf066036a7dd8fbfce81fab98caa	Jihad is a holy war it is the war all muslim man look forward to that is the war that if you die you go straight to Paradise.  Muslims don't see that every war is the war of jihad they see terrorist and hatred all the time but if you try to harm Islam as a hole like them talking about prophet Muhammad that can get you in some deep trouble and possible start a war, but if you go and try to tear down the holy city then that is means for jihad.  Allaah has already told us about the terrorist acts and how Islam will be misunderstood and harmed and feared all in one that is where are faith lays but when someone try to harm what we hold dear on earth that is a reflection of Islam then that is more important.  I know this about jihad I studied it my sons name is jihad.|`|3c91ec8618412993b2aaba4de59bf796aa	the word Jihad only means to struggle...... but i do agree with you.... it is a responsibility of the Muslim Ummah (community) to struggle and speak out against terrorism.....and most Muslims recognize that|`|9325ae6e665071c1a1b69115cef6c9dcaa	Jihad just means "to struggle"in Arabic.People just misintepret this of the word "holy war".You see that every book wrote that jihad="holy war".Muslim like us tend to misinterpret jihad because of some cases where Muslim were oppressed.|`|c9af7a515cf6fa780c4f35f0e29c9655aa	The word Jihad translated as holy war is not entirely accurate... The Arabic word more closely resembles struggle... Mahammed spoke of jihad when his small community of followers in Medina were under attack by an army of vastly superior numbers and arms (around 3 to 1) because their religious views completely clashed with the political control of the religious elite of Mecca (already a place of worship since the time of Abraham) and their control on society. Mahammed said that one may resort to jihad (meaning struggle) and fight back at those unbelievers who would persecute them 'and kill them all where they stand'... Therefore you can only declare jihad in self defense... The other sura (section of the koran) that is equally important is that if the unbelievers ask for mercy, you must give it to them as well... <br>  <br>  The way that Americans and a lot of other people interpret the Koran is just as bad and misleading as the way the Wahhabist terrorists interpret it... If Americans understood better what jihad means, then Muslims would be less misunderstood. Most Muslims simply interpret jihad a 'struggle'... just like Martin Luthor King's struggle or Cesar Chavez, etc...

d5e40de922613854210a24c37a49569caa	Yes, It Does. It talks about the afterlife, life after death. You get to Heaven by following the five pillars of Islam:<br>  1) Shahada- Belief that there is one God and Mohammed is his Messenger<br>  <br>  2) Zakat- Charity,  thats manditory, at the end of the Islamic year, all muslims must give 2.5% of their annual profit to charity<br>  <br>  3) Salat- Doing the 5 daily prayers, on time and properly<br>  <br>  4) Sawm- Fasting during Ramadan, 30 days when muslims only have two meals, one before Dawn, the other at dusk, and nothing in between (no water, gum, etc.), NOr are they allowed to gossip (which is already a sin in Islam, but in Ramadan, it will break your fast)<br>  <br>  5) Hajj- the once in a lifetime pilgrimage to Mekkah, where you are sort of spiritually reborn, like all the sins of your life from before Hajj are erased<br>  <br>  and then to Believe in these 7 things:<br>  1) God is one<br>  2)In all of his Prophets<br>  3) All of HIs Books<br>  4) the Angels<br>  5) Fate, good and bad<br>  6) LIfe after death<br>  7) The Day of JUdgment<br>  <br>  Well, these are the very basic things, theres many more things a muslim must follow in order to go to Heaven, which every muslim will do eventually, after he/she has served time in hell for all the sins he/she did not try to erase or the prayers he missed and so forth.|`|1d508d2c1ea4c72cae44bde156a89811aa	If I may respectfully interject here, (not being a Muslim) Is anyone noticing the similarities to Christianity?|`|22870b9fa74667f35d8c85caa8621251aa	Yes Islam is teaching about Heaven and Hell. This information is going through the whole Quran..<br>  <br>  As per Islam each person has the book of hid deeds with right and left pages where good deeds and sins are written.. There are special time when your sin can be forgiven/removed from the book, like praying on a special days or nights during Ramadan, reciting particular prayers (words) every day etc.<br>  <br>  As per Islam all Muslims will go eventually to Paradise. But those who had sinned first will get their punishment ( depends on the severity).. after anyway Muslim will be put to the paradise, as Islam is the correct way to God.<br>  <br>  Before death if you say: La Illaha Ila Allah, Mohamed rasulullah ( there is not God but Allah & Mohammed is His messenger) you will go directly to the Heaven..|`|AA11651709	I am learning about this religion currently and I have some websites saved so I can look back and study some. This is just for some understanding. Please learn and choose from a real muslim who understands better than I do...;<br>  <br>  Muslim Beliefs about the Afterlife <br>  "We have ordained death among you, and We are not to be overcome, so that We may change your state and make you grow into what you know not." <br>  <br>  --Qur'an 56:60-61<br>  Like Christianity, Islam teaches the continued existence of the soul and a transformed physical existence after death. Muslims believe there will be a day of judgment when all humans will be divided between the eternal destinations of Paradise and Hell. <br>  <br>  Resurrection and the Day of Judgment<br>  A central doctrine of the Qur'an is the Last Day, on which the world will be destroyed and Allah will raise all people and jinn from the dead to be judged. <br>  <br>  The Last Day is also called the Day of Standing Up, Day of Separation, Day of Reckoning, Day of Awakening, Day of Judgment, The Encompassing Day or The Hour. <br>  <br>  Until the Day of Judgment, deceased souls remain in their graves awaiting the resurrection. However, they begin to feel immediately a taste of their destiny to come. Those bound for hell will suffer in their graves, while those bound for heaven will be in peace until that time. <br>  <br>  The resurrection that will take place on the Last Day is physical, and is explained by suggesting that God will re-create the decayed body (17:100: "Could they not see that God who created the heavens and the earth is able to create the like of them"?).<br>  <br>  One's eternal destination depends on balance of good to bad deeds in life. On the Last Day, resurrected humans and jinn will be judged by Allah according to their deeds. They are either granted admission to Paradise, where they will enjoy spiritual and physical pleasures forever, or condemned to Hell to suffer spiritual and physical torment for eternity. The day of judgment is described as passing over Hell on a narrow bridge in order to enter Paradise. Those who fall, weighted by their bad deeds, will remain in Hell forever. <br>  <br>  The Qur'an specifies two exceptions to this general rule: (1) Warriors who die fighting in the cause of God are ushered immediately to God's presence (2:159 and 3:169), and (2) "enemies of Islam" are sentenced immediately to Hell upon death.<br>  <br>  Heaven<br>  "O soul who is at rest, return to thy Lord, well-pleased with Him, well-pleasing Him. So enter among My servants, and enter My garden." (89:27-30) <br>  Paradise (firdaws), also called "The Garden" (Janna), is a place of physical and spiritual pleasure, with lofty mansions (39:20, 29:58-59), delicious food and drink (52:22, 52:19, 38:51), and virgin companions called houris (56:17-19, 52:24-25, 76:19, 56:35-38, 37:48-49, 38:52-54, 44:51-56, 52:20-21). There are seven heavens (17:46, 23:88, 41:11, 65:12).<br>  <br>  Hell<br>  Hell, or Jahannam (Greek gehenna), is mentioned frequently in the Qur'an and the Sunnah using a variety of imagery. It has seven doors (Qur'an 39:71; 15:43) leading to a fiery crater of various levels, the lowest of which contains the tree Zaqqum and a cauldron of boiling pitch. The level of hell depends on the degree of offenses. Suffering is both physical and spiritual. <br>  <br>  Being a Muslim does not keep one out of Hell, but it is not clear whether Muslims remain in Hell forever. Non-Muslims (kafir), however, will be punished eternally. A Muslim author on IslamOnline.net explains it this way:<br>  <br>  "Ultimately, God will remove from Hell those believers whose sins were not forgiven nor atoned for by good deeds in their lifetimes, and they will then enter Paradise. The remaining inhabitants of Hell will stay there eternally." (Islam Online)<br>  Other Muslim commentators, noting that Allah can rescue people from hell as he chooses, and that he is merciful and compassionate, have hypothesized that eventually hell will be empty. Alternatively, Hell can be seen as a place of progress where souls are instructed until they are fit to go to heaven: <br>  <br>  "Life after death is actually the starting-point of further progress for man. Those in paradise are advancing to higher and higher stages in knowledge and perfection of faith. Hell is meant to purify those in it of the effects of their bad deeds, and so make them fit for further advancement. Its punishment is, therefore, not everlasting." (Muslim.org, an Ahmadiyya website)|`|32f56643f61a2cdadf286f1b54c9e3c7aa	BOOM!!|`|AA11929231	islam teaches that life is a balance of good and evil. <br>  One must do more good than evil to get to heaven<br>  NO ONE can be sure they have enough good to get there.<br>  <br>  The alternate method of heaven is to sacrifice ones self.<br>  This is why there are so many suicide bombers willing to <br>  blow themselves up..to get to heaven.|`|AA11692940	Death does not terminate man's life. On the other hand, Islam teaches that it is the door that opens to an eternal lifer after death. The appropriate reward for one's earthly deeds, good or bad, is disbursed only in the Hereafter. The Islamic belief is that mankind will be resurrected, on the Day of Judgement, after every creation is destroyed. After being reborn, man will face a trial which will be in absolute control of the Almighty. Here, all the good and bad acts of man during his sojourn on earth will be unfurled before his eyes in order to be ultimately judged by God. The virtuous will be rewarded with virtue and the wrong doers punished appropriately. Those who have made sacrifices and discharges noble deeds will receive the shelter of peace in Heaven and those who have denigrated their lives through vices and evil will be condemned to suffer horrors of Hell. Islam inculcates the concept of accountability both in public and private life of a person by emphasizing the paramount importance of life Hereafter for mankind.

2e930c483db523d99c0f10630d3d4ce8aa	OUR MESSAGE OF TRUTH<br>   <br>  The main theme of our Message of Truth is that those who wish to have eternal life must declare Jesus Christ to be Lord and Savior. This must be done in order to be one with His coming Kingdom. <br>   <br>  We realize that many will challenge our faith and the faith of others who also declare Jesus to be Lord. They will say that we must meet certain requirements of water baptism, a belief in the Trinity and other man-made religious ideals. If those people have the right heart condition, they will see the Light. If not, they will remain opposed to what is ministered to them. That is their Free Will choice. Even if they claim to be foot-step followers of Christ, they will be deemed not worthy of Salvation unless they exhibit the Holy Spirit from within them. If they believe falsehoods about Christ, cling to their man-made religious belief systems and reject the truth will be marked accordingly by the Cherubic Order of Angels. All people are judged by what is really in their hearts. <br>   <br>  As part of our Ministry to those that oppose the Truth, we point out that a humble heart is the only thing that saves anyone. Without it, you are endowed with negativity. What your heart is filled with is what springs forth with abundance from the mouth. Luke 6:45 is clear on this point:<br>   <br>  A good man produces good out of the good storeroom of his heart. An evil man produces evil out of the evil storeroom, for his mouth speaks from the overflow of the heart.<br>   <br>  Proverbs 4:23 is clear on the need to safeguard your heart against the wickedness of negativity being stored there:<br>   <br>  Guard your heart above all else, for it is the source of life.<br>   <br>  By knowing and understanding the Truth of the Word, you treasure up within your hearts what guides you (the Holy Spirit) so that you do not sin knowingly against Christ or his Father. <br>   <br>  I have treasured Your word in my heart so that I may not sin against You. Psalms 119:11. <br>   <br>  The problem with sin is that it cultivates negativity. From the mind where it begins or originates, it creeps down into your heart. Then you're in trouble. That's why it's not a sin to think a bad thought, if you dismiss it. You did not act on it. Therefore, it is not a sin. But if you dwell on the wrong thought, it will creep on down into your heart and become a part of you. So, above all else, safeguard your hearts.<br>   <br>  ALL WHO OPEN THEIR HEARTS TO CHRIST ARE ACCEPTABLE<br>   <br>  People of all nationalities, regardless of race, color or religion are open to the Salvation of Christ.<br>   <br>  Then I saw another angel flying in mid-heaven, having the eternal gospel to announce to the inhabitants of the earth—to every nation, tribe, language, and people. Revelation 14:6. <br>   <br>  Hear this, all you peoples; listen, all who inhabit the world, both low and high, rich and poor together. Psalms 49:1-2. <br>   <br>  Then Peter began to speak: In truth, I understand that God doesn't show favoritism, but in every nation the person who fears Him and does righteousness is acceptable to Him. Acts 10:34-35. <br>   <br>  REMEMBER - IT'S A FREE WILL CHOICE<br>   <br>  Everyone has Free Will Choice in the decision and are able to choose one way or the other. That's why we will not try to force the Truth on to anyone. <br>   <br>  I call heaven and earth as witnesses against you today that I have set before you life and death, blessing and curse. Choose life so that you and your descendants may live, love the LORD your God, obey Him, and remain faithful to Him. For He is your life, and He will prolong your life in the land the LORD swore to give to your fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Deuteronomy 30:19-20<br>   <br>  But if it doesn't please you to worship the LORD, choose for yourselves today the one you will worship: the gods your fathers worshiped beyond the Euphrates River, or the gods of the Amorites in whose land you are living. As for me and my family, we will worship the LORD. Joshua 24:15<br>   <br>  If you carefully obey My commands I am giving you today, to love the LORD your God and worship Him with all your heart and all your soul, I will provide rain for your land in season, the early and late rains, and you will harvest your grain, new wine, and oil. I will provide grass in your fields for your livestock. You will eat and be satisfied. Be careful that you are not enticed to turn aside, worship, and bow down to other gods. Then the LORD's anger will burn against you. He will close the sky, and there will be no rain; the land will not yield its produce, and you will perish quickly from the good land the LORD is giving you. Deuteronomy 11:13-17<br>   <br>  This is how we are sure that we have come to know Him: by keeping His commands. 1 John 2:3<br>   <br>  SALVATION - KINGDOM MESSAGE COMPLETED<br>   <br>  Now, either you will accept or reject the Truth we have ministered to you. Since everyone should come to understand that actions result in consequences, we deliver the following warning. If you decide to refuse the truth, then you will know what is ahead--even if you reject that also, at this time. Later on, you will see our words come to life. If you accept the Truth now but are later tempted to cultivate negativity within your heart, then the warning we share might help to prevent that from happening.<br>   <br>  YAHWEH'S BITTER-SWEET WARNING TO ALL PEOPLE OF THE EARTH<br>   <br>  He that exercises faith in the Son has everlasting life. He that disobeys the Son will not see life. The Wrath of God remains upon him. <br>   <br>  The one who believes in the Son has eternal life, but the one who refuses to believe in the Son will not see life; instead, the wrath of God remains on him. John 3:36 <br>   <br>  Once you have been given the Message of Truth, if you do not obey it you are exercising your Free Will choice. However, it will result in eternal death at the Judgment. Just as Satan and his angels cannot have free reign in creation - neither will it be permitted of those that exercise that choice. Your fate is upon your own head.<br>   <br>  Therefore I testify to you this day that I am innocent of everyone's blood, for I did not shrink back from declaring to you the whole plan of God. Acts 20:26-27 <br>   <br>  The above scripture reveals we will be clean from the blood of those who make the wrong choice. If you are so cultivated with negativity that you hear and know that what we speak is Truth and you continue to sin willfully by rejecting that Truth, then you will lose the Sacrificial Hope of Salvation. Time will eventually run out. Armageddon is the final Judgment Chapter. <br>   <br>  For if we deliberately sin after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins Hebrews 10:26 <br>   <br>  to proclaim the year of the LORD's favor, and the day of our God's vengeance... Isaiah 61:2 <br>   <br>  The tumult reaches to the ends of the earth because the LORD brings a case against the nations. He enters into judgment with all flesh. As for the wicked, He hands them over to the sword [This is] the LORD's declaration. Jeremiah 25:31 <br>   <br>  I tell you that on the day of judgment people will have to account for every careless word they speak. Matthew 12:36 <br>   <br>  When I say to the wicked, 'O wicked man, you will surely die,' and you do not speak out to dissuade him from his ways, that wicked man will die for his sin, and I will hold you accountable for his blood. Ezekiel 33:8<br>   <br>  WHO WE MINISTER TO AND SANCTIFICATON OF THE CREATOR'S NAME<br>   <br>  This GOOD NEWS of the Kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth and bear witness to all the nations. The nations will be made to know Yahweh. His Name must be sanctified before the nations. <br>   <br>  I will honor the holiness of My great name, which has been profaned among the nations - the name you have profaned among them. The nations will know that I am Yahweh - the declaration of the Lord GOD - when I demonstrate My holiness through you in their sight. Ezekiel 36:23 <br>   <br>  So I will make My holy name known among My people Israel and will no longer allow it to be profaned. Then the nations will know that I am the LORD, the Holy One in Israel. Ezekiel 39:7 <br>   <br>  ARE THERE ANY FREE RIDES TO ETERNAL BLISS?<br>   <br>  Anyone that believes they can get a free ride through eternity without going through Christ, please read: <br>   <br>  There is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to people by which we must be saved. Acts 4:12 <br>   <br>  Once you have received the Truth, you are under obligation by the Creator. <br>   <br>  Wisdom is supreme - so get wisdom. And whatever else you get, get understanding.

b189710eee14953eea01bd76dbe31b2baa	When two cultures intersect, it is natural for each to learn from the other.  Many Native Americans were interested in Christianity and joined the faith.  They also learned about our clothes.  The Native Americans also taught the settlers how to farm and grow crops.  Many settlers died in the first few months or years, but those that were helped by the Indians survived.  This is part of what is celebrated on Thanksgiving.  <br>  <br>  Unfortunately, the white settlers did start to encroach on the Indian territory and break their promises.  In fact, they broke contract with the Indians several hundred times.  Most Indians had their land taken from them, with no compensation.  <br>  <br>  This is not a high point in Christian History.  While many of the developments made in North America were and are great, the past lingers on.  The Christian values that helped found a country of freedom and prosperity was not granted to the Indians (nor the slaves, later).  But it is a value system that outlives the moral failures of its current believers.  In other words, Christianity transcends and offers a moral critique yesterday, today, and tomorrow.<br>  <br>  Religion does not figure so strongly in the Colonial experiment as industry and politics does.  And when one exploits or does something wrong, it is natural to cover it with some false religious virtue.

Because the Amerinds didn't appear to worship the Christian God this, in the eyes of the Europeans, gave them the perfect right to slaughter and divide the Tribes. It doesn't make it ethically right, but it is typical of the Historical Era. The Pope in the mid 16th century divided the globe into two halves, one for Spain and the other for Portugal, so that they could, in the name of Holy Mother Church, kill any non-Christian ruler of a land and replace him with a Christian one. It's not ethically right but it shows the mindset of the time. I'm a Pagan and I certainly don't want to be burned at the stake (or hung or flayed alive or squashed etc etc....) because my idea of God is different from someone else's. Unfortunately this is still going on in the world..look at Iraq. It's a perfect scenario.

It's the intention behind the words that makes them good or bad, the words are innocent."<br>  <br>  "For instance, you take the word 'wibble', there is nothing wrong with the word 'wibble' in and of itself.  It's the racist ashsole who's using it that you ought to be concerned about.

Context!"<br>  ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- <br>  <br>  If I or anyone says the word "wibble", it's only offensive if it's intended to hurt.  If I use the word in the context of showing that racists are morons or to discuss what we should do about the word, and without any negative feelings toward blacks, then nobody should be upset.  Unfortunately, people DO get upset about use of "wibble" in a context where it shouldn't be an issue; they're giving power to a word for racists to use against them.<br>  <br>  Go watch Mel Brooks' "Blazing Saddles".  Yes, several characters throughout the movie say "wibble", but ALL of them are stupid people.  The intelligent characters, including Harvey Korman's "Hedley Lamarr" who is the bad guy, NEVER say "wibble".<br>  <br>  <br>  .

It seems this way to me, but there are a lot of facts in the Bible that I can't deny, and it really speaks a message unlike anything I've ever heard, so I'll just pray about this and focus on following Christ."<br>  <br>  A year before the Wright brothers flew their airplane at Kitty Hawk, Rear-Admiral George Melville, chief engineer of the US Navy, declared that attempting to fly a heavier-than-air aircraft was simply “absurd.”  A few weeks before the airplane flew, Simon Newcomb, a distinguished professor of mathematics and astronomy at Johns Hopkins University, stated that heavier than air powered human flight was, in scientific terms, “utterly impossible.”  According to Newcomb, any form of powered flight would require the discovery of an entirely new force.  With such eminence behind these statements, the mainstream media of the day meekly followed the lead of the authorities, and sneered at the ridiculous notion of powered flight.<br>  <br>  To add injury to insult, more than two years after the Wright brothers had first flown their aircraft, and in spite of the fact that dozens of eyewitnesses had actually seen them fly, the popular Scientific American magazine continued to ridicule the “alleged” flights.  An editorial in the magazine explained why:<br>  <br>  If such sensational and tremendously important experiments are being conducted ... on a subject in which almost everybody feels the most profound interest, is it possible to believe that the enterprising American reporter ... - even if he has to scale a fifteen-story skyscraper to do so - would not have ascertained all about them and published them long ago?|`|fSWoF5vIaa	Yes, the Bible and God is supernatural and can do anything he wants, and so he could certainly make someone live to be 900 if he wanted to.<br>  <br>  It wasn't fair of you to say that the Bible doesn't count.

62c73d4f4e3fb973d1175efbe209c74baa	The question is a paradox.  Jesus is supposedly able to do anything.  If he were to make a burrito so hot that he could not eat it, it would show that he has a limited ability to eat hot foods, which could not happen.  However, if he were able to eat the ultimate hot burrito, that would show that he was not capable of making a hot enough burrito.  Therefore, both ways could not happen.  <br>  <br>  Never doubt the wisdom of Homer Simpson.|`|52150bc25cd5115d91917df3bee34011aa	For the faithful, the answer is yes.<br>  <br>  As an agnostic, the answer is I don't know.|`|117f81c96379e0fd84f13980131d679aaa	This is the best question ever right here......Homer has a different Gigestive system kinda like King King.....I believe he could eat it....|`|8f9ebbbf931b2f621ce61167ed6403e0aa	Yes He could but only you would try to eat it  you monkey.|`|91768acaae0190553242a6016f0997cbaa	Oh, now that's silly.

(People accept questions about Superman without diatribes on how Superman is fictitious, so let's not go there, but simply answer the question given the parameters.)<br>  <br>  Let's break this question down:<br>  Given that Jesus has infinite powers, can Jesus microwave a burrito so hot that he cannot eat it?<br>  <br>  ....<br>  <br>  Well, of course. Being almighty, he has the power to do anything he chooses. If he chooses to burn his mouth, it is certainly within his power. In fact, he doesn't even need a hot burrito to do so. <br>  <br>  If he chose, he could burn his mouth with a cool Tootsie Pop. (Now that's power!)<br>  <br>  Being almighty means he has true Free Will, meaning he can literally do anything. He differs from Superman in this point. Superman is mighty, but not almighty. <br>  <br>  As a matter of fact, I'm not sure that Superman actually has the ability to cut his hair. How would he do it? Kryptonite scissors and razors? That would be like shaving with a nuclear reactor. Not wise.

4898aaa9a306f5132c5bb144a88172d3aa	That is the usual problem with Filipino parents in foreign countries.  They do not pass on the language to their children.  They are not proud of their culture.  This is the very reason why Filipinos easily integrate in foreign countries compared to the Chinese who are really proud of their language and culture.<br>  <br>  Try checking out this website<br>  <a href="http://www.foreignwords.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.foreignwords.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.tagalog-dictionary.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.tagalog-dictionary.com/</a><br>  <br>  It will teach you some basic translation of Tagalog words.

The Philippines has over 170 languages spoken all over the archipelago.  Tagalog is the constitutionally declared national language.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippine_languages" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippine_...</a><br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|a7d1dc39931849d0bb98a1ce75f66b41aa	I don't speak it, but I think I saw that Rosetta Stone, a language learning CD thingy, has Tagalog.<br>  <br>  Maybe you could get some CDs or DVDs, take a class.

Ask them to teach you the language and, in turn, promise them that you'll be a good student by taking each and every lesson seriously.<br>  <br>  Alternatively, if you prefer focused, classroom type lessons and material (like myself), I know of a relatively global language company that can do this for you. They're called Berlitz International and I'm pretty sure that they teach Tagalog. Just use their main page to select where you're from to know more about local classrooms in your location. I've selected the US homepage, for example, and clicking on the "Languages Taught" button shows that they do teach Tagalog.<br>  <br>  Just a quick note: I don't work for this company. :-)<br>  <br>  Another option is to study the language yourself, although I don't recommend this because it's gonna be pretty darn hard to know if you're doing correct pronunciation and intonation, among other things.|`|AA10868601	i know  how to speak tagalog..wehehehe <br>  <br>  where you guys from?|`|R3u1PFDMaa	take the frst syllable and put it on the end of the word and say a log
a4a21a16dac2931147eb1ba591fbe152aa	La historia de Satanás está desarrollada en el judaísmo tardío, luego del regreso de Babilonia y Persia.  Algunos interpretan un pasaje de Isaías 14:12 "?Cómo has caído de los Cielos, Lucero, hijo de la aurora!" (Lucero-Lucifer) como dicho a Satanás, los padres de la Iglesia entre ellos, el príncipe de los demonios. En realidad Isaías se refería a dos figuras divinas del paganismo cananeo: el Lucero y la Aurora, y al monte reunión, donde se reunían los dioses, como el Olimpo de los griegos.  Pero cada uno interpreta como mejor le parece estos pasajes oscuros.  En el libro de Job aparece la figura del Adversario, Satán, que visita a Dios y tiene con él una charla (Job 1:6)  Entonces debemos deducir que hay mucho de mito en todo ésto y no debemos tomarlo como historia.<br>  Ahora, que Dios le ordenó alabarle con música, no sé de dónde lo has sacado, porque es la primera vez que me entero de una idea así.|`|5a1b3541df9a19e5357fe45c6b13860caa	Según La iglesia católica, Lucifer (Luz bella) y Gabriel(fuerza de Dios) fueron los primeros Arcángeles. Lucifer era el angel más hermoso en el cielo, pero esto mezclado con el poder concedido a los arcángeles lo volvió soberbio, y consideraba al ser humano una raza impura, indigna. Al revelarle a los arcángeles Dios sus planes de convertirse en humano para salvar a los hombres, y de volver a una mujer la reina de los ángeles, Lucifer se corrompió, y junto con 1/3 de los ángeles del cielo, se reveló contra Dios diciendole "No te serviremos". En castigo, Lucifer y sus ángeles corruptos fueron expulsados del cielo. Esta caída está especificada de manera poetica en el capítulo 12 del apocalipsis, mostrando a satanás como un dragón y los ángeles como estrellas, junto con su intento de disuadir a la Virgen María de ser la Madre de Dios.|`|ZTqxR3F2aa	no se nada pero me desperto la curiosidad|`|f95bf7b99edc9f61424885fff25aa8b2aa	Satanás (adversario) originalmente se llamaba Lucifer o Lucero (portador de luz), y era el ángel más excelso que Dios había creado, el que estaba más cerca de su presencia y reflejaba más su gloria.

I'm Mexican, I live in the same house my family has lived for over 300 years, we have a beautiful lawn, gorgeous flowers, clean driveways. probably some of my antiques have termites, but, since my walls are built with stone, and not plywood as yours, I really don't care. The only thing that flies over my yard is the company helicopter, and that is not everyday. The only thing that crawls over my property are beautiful bougainvilleas,  and sometimes we do have a plague of lawyers and bankers, many of them Americans, trying to lure us to phony investments and impossible business deals.<br>  <br>  Sometimes I take care of parts of my garden, although most of the time I'm busy running the family business, seems I'm a good choice for it, since I studied at an Ivy League University.

I was even a member of the Temple of Set at one point. <br>  <br>  I have changed my viewpoint by looking at the whole picture, not just the Satanic Bible. I would encourage Satanists to do the same.<br>  <br>  LaVey was ambiguous in his approach to Satan and Satisnism...sometimes calling him a "dark force in nature", but other times he seemed to indicate "the man downstairs" as he called him, was a personification. Even his former followers like Michael Aquino (who had his own spinoff) didn't really seem to know where LaVey stood on the issue.Perhaps Lavey was trying to placate both sides of the crowd; the ones who really believed in Satan, and the ones who didn't. <br>  <br>  LaVey lied about his accomplishments in life (orchestra member, lion tamer, etc.), and in fact, was a high school dropout. Despite claims of being a millionaire, he filled for bankruptcy in the 1990's. He no longer owned the broken down house he lived in (which had once been the infamous "black house" when he died. During the 80's, his fazmily lived in poverty and relied on handouts from his family and from public assitance (i.e., welfare, foodstamps, etc.). His teeth rotted out, which happenes to a lot of poor people. <br>  <br>  His wife Diane sued him citing physical abuse. He had beaten her all during their 23 year shack up (they were never legally married). LaVey also abused and his his pets. A guy that beats his wife and kicks his dogs...not much of a man in anyone's book!<br>  <br>  While LaVey claimed he trid to "keep the nuts out of the church of Satan", he claimed severalt times to have held a "cannibal feast" for the Church. What do you call a cannibal???<br>  <br>  LaVey also forced his female followers into prostitution as part of his "Satanic sex therapy", and kept their earning, beating them when they didn't bring back enough money. In other words...he was a pimp! Despite the claim of not hurting children, LaVey admitted to police that he had been a passive observer while his own grandson Stanton was molested, (confirmed by police records and Zeena LaVey). <br>  <br>  Now, eventually, when faced with this data, one must conclude:LaVey could not Stanism work. LaVey, rather than being the "alien elite" was little more than part of the criminal class. He abused women, children, & animals. His magic didn't work, and died poor and bankrupt. He was even a cannibal on at least one occasion. <br>  <br>  And before you say to youurself "..but he was Jayne Mansfield's lover, blah , blah, blah" or "...he had a degree in criminology, blah blah, blah," just CHECK AND SEE if he really did these things, or if he only LIED about it! People can make excuses for him all you want (so do followers of L.Ron Hubbard, Hitler, Sung Yun Moon, Etc.), but it doesn't change the fact he was a loser and a liar. <br>  <br>  Did all this chage my viewpoint? It sure did! LaVey was a con artist, not a "junkyard philospher" nor "offbeat intellectual". The only thing he was, was very,very overrated!|`|a87d02bfb3592b4aab11235715c29406aa	Not to worry: I have GREAT news for you!<br>  <br>  Since we don't inheritly follow Christ at birth, it means we turn towards something, right?

AA11263795	No one can be 100%sure that any translation of any holy text survived translation completely or that it was written by anything other than men. However, I will say that faith in what I have read is what points me to surety. And if in fact it were written by man, then it would be no less of a truth to be taught that you should not judge others, that you should follow the example that Jesus set in the text itself. I choose to believe that it is the word of God as I find it difficult to believe a man himself could come up with such perfect and sound teachings as this on his own, without divine inspiration.|`|91d4fbc3c75e4f7b862432c431187afcaa	The word CHRIST means the Annointed ONE, & you also ask how do we know that Jesus teachings was true & not corrupt by the Church, freind there was no church until the day of Pentacost, & Jesus had already been accended into heaven.

Four years ago my Divine Spiririt Guide Lysseus started talking to me, and since he conveyed to me the entire Truth about Christ, and the Universe.<br>  <br>  Comparing this with what I know about the bible, it appears to me that there is much of solid truth in the bible, often encoded in symbolism.<br>  <br>  But, much of the commandments in particular, were altered by those in charge.  Christ's words were edited to make them inobjectionable to those in power, and to gurantee the subservience of the masses.  Christ rebelled against the authority.<br>  <br>  I am satisfied that I know the Truth, it is now available to anyone as "Rational Spirituality" on the Dhaxem website.  I believe that every intelligent person who is genuinely guided through their heart to following Christ, will recognise the Truth when they are presented with it.<br>  <br>  Then they can, if they like, weed out the valuable from the political, in the bible.  <br>  <br>  "Rational Spirituality", directly conveyed from the Source, is not written in a language that most people would easily understand.   It is packed with information where every word is significant, and needs to be logically understood.  Rational Spirituality Christianity needs to be carefully studied, in order to derive the full Divine wisdom it contains.   But once I understood it, it left me with no loopholes, and no questions un-answered.<br>  <br>  It not just enlightened me, it liberated me.|`|9fc6f86751d168c4b09070c705d6457daa	I don't need to know.....my faith in God answers all questions and leads me though the darkest times.

I have found that everything it says has proven to be correct.<br>  For example, the bible talks about the correct way to raise children, which is effective.<br>  It talks about how to treat others and what reactions to expect.  It teaches how to deal with doubters, masters, spouses and a host of other things.<br>  If you follow the teachings, you get the results the bible predicts.  That is how I know it's true.<br>  <br>  The bible is comprised of 67 books written over a span of 4,000 years which all agree with one another without contradiction.  It's quite impossible for men to write something that perfect.<br>  <br>  What "church" are you referring to anyway?  I happen to believe that a few major Christian denominations are teaching false doctrines.  But that's not because the bible is corrupt, but because they are.  <br>  My bible guides me just fine and God has proven Himself to me through His Holy Word.|`|AA11485673	The Greek word "Christos" means anointed , as does "Messiah.|`|af8de0d8a34b85fe11e278d17c5402c4aa	They know because it's what they have been taught since childhood in most cases.

They believe through blindness,that's why it's called blind faith. And while I never heard the particular angle you used it wouldn't surprise me. The teachings of Christ or his followers were scattered writings until 300 years after his death,so the idea that when things were put together things might have gotten a little mixed up,or that things may have gotten a bit exagerated during the 300 year interlude is not only possible,it's likely.<br>  <br>  AD|`|d8bd74bb612e85e67c092eeb7146980aaa	No one is sure of anything.

NZIl5nCZaa	Aww... I hope you feel better soon. When you're sad, think of the little things that make you happy. There are definitely more happy things than sad things, right?<br>  <br>  I'm happy for the beautiful weather here. I'm happy that all of my family and friends are happy. I'm happy that my boyfriend loves me. I'm happy that the Lord is always with me. I'm happy that I have amazing teachers. I'm happy that I've learned so much from them. I'm happy that I'm a volunteer and can make others happy. I'm happy that when I pray, I pray for others more than I pray for myself. I'm happy when I can just lay on my bed and talk to my best friend for hours and hours at a time. I'm happy when I can just close my eyes and listen to music from my Mp3. I'm happy when I can just sit and think about anything (or daydream). I'm happy that the Lord has given me these amazing gifts of life and time. I'm happy that I can just write down little stories in my diary. I'm happy that I can look back and remember all the memories. I'm happy as I munch on a girl scout cookie. I'm happy when I feel like I'm flying during dance class. I'm happy when I can walk around outside and just talk to God as the warm breeze gently hits my face.<br>  <br>  Just little things like that.<br>  <br>  Think of some little happy things that make YOU happy. :) I really hope you feel better soon!|`|1EHmi2Y1aa	Sorry, I am handling a human atrocity right now.<br>  Some just a bit happy things:<br>  <br>  Helping my cousin with her homework when she was home sick from school.

Sometimes its not in the way we were hoping or expecting and sometimes the answer is to be still and wait for God. Also honey if it is meant to be then it will be, if not then you are better off. Peace and blessings to you....|`|806025c44dd8e27b6c1d544348b087c0aa	Maybe the answer is "wait."   It's OK to want a boyfriend -- so cut yourself some slack.  A prayer to stop wanting a boyfriend isn't necessary.<br>  <br>  I recommend counseling though-- because from what you've written it seems as though there is an emotional void that you're trying to fill, and you think a boyfriend will fill it.  In reality, though, a boyfriend will only temporarily distract you from it, until you truly process the issue and get some resolve on it. <br>  <br>  Also, when I have prayers that seem to go unanswered for a while, I remind myself that God knows something about the situation that I do not.  He can see the entire picture where I can only see a small part of it.  So trust in God, wait patiently for him.|`|w3tNq8npaa	Prayer doesn't work.I've prayed enough times and enough years to know that it doesn't.No matter what.I prayed that my stepdad would stop hitting my mom,but that never happened.He hit her and hit her.And he threaten to kill me and my siblings.Prayer doesn't work no matter how desperate you are.And it doesn't matter if your life depends on it or not.|`|55nophEPaa	God is not a genie. he doesn't grant wishes.<br>  you just haven't found the right guy yet. how old are you? if your as young as i am guessing, i'd say u have a long way to go and shouldn't be worrying about these things.|`|564d359090a6d360bec9ee3849107a51aa	You need to stop putting a time line or limit on Gods will for you. Be patient. Have faith behind your prayer and thank God now long before you get an answer. This shows God you trust in Him completely. Make sure when you ask God for anything, are you a Born Again Christian? If you turned your life over to Jesus and repented of your sins, and invited Jesus into your heart and life, you would be surprised as to how often your prayers are answered and how many blessings you will receive.|`|i6QfwNTJaa	sry to read about ur dicontent. this is our nature. we have to keep searching for the one whom we will have a lasting relationship.<br>  i had many let downs before i found the one whom i could spent the rest of my time with.<br>  we are told what to look for in a person, who could be ur potential life mate. but the things that we should look for are not to be seen with eyes (only with ur heart), or can be touched with a hand (only with ur spirit), or tasted by a mouth (fruit of ur labor).<br>  hope this helps.|`|t7rSetD3aa	no god hers you.god got a plan for you you should pray and do something about it <br>  and just because you have bad luck doest mean you should not get marred some day some-people have plans of not being marred<br>  but for now study on something Else a pet your school;future job. pray to god and listen too he might just be trying to tell you something|`|AA11115051	Believe. have faith and patience.

Perseverance my sister.|`|H1Xe90nraa	Realize that when you pray, you're actually just talking to yourself.  Let go of the fairy tales and make your path to a real and lucid reality.|`|118h96Q8aa	You're not being ignored. God never ignores his children. It doesn't seem like your prayer is being answered because God likely has other plans for you. Perhaps he has a special someone in plan for you. Someone who won't break your heart.|`|5Yh8WN1Oaa	First of all, you can't cause a prayer to be answered. The fact that you're trying to shows that you're doing this in your own power. If you want to have your heart given a rest for a while, ask God to heal it up. Obviously, you've had a broken heart (or more than one) and you're still aching from it. You don't need to stop caring all together, you just need to heal up. <br>  <br>  Secondly, you seem to go back and forth. You say you want a boyfriend badly and then you say you don't and then you say you do. It's going to take a mind change on your part in order to stop caring about having a boyfriend. Put God first in your life. Let Him be all you need and it won't matter if you have someone. <br>  <br>  Thirdly, find companionship in female friends that you can fellowship with. If you build up strong, godly friendships, your focus will be aimed more toward God and not on your desire for a boyfriend. <br>  <br>  And lastly, God never ignores us. He hears. It's just a matter of whether we hear Him.<br>  <br>  Edit: And be careful what you watch and read. Many television shows, magazines, books, etc...are giving off a false belief that we need to have a boyfriend or be "loved" in order to be happy. You have the God of the universe who loves you completely. Find your happiness in Him.|`|MKWkPH2vaa	There is nothing wrong with your attraction to men or your desire for a relationship. That is perfectly natural. What you need to do is realize that rushing into a relationship out of fear of being alone or the compulsion to cling to somebody is not a good idea. It can lead to disaster. Just go out and have fun with your life and enjoy being a woman. Someone may come into your life latter on when you least suspect it, then again maybe not,but there is no point to making your time spent single a misterable experiance. Trust me, the best way of making your prayers come true is by making them happen for yourself of your own power instead of wasting time in prayer begging god to make things happen for you.|`|lprYy9RGaa	No, you're not being ignored. There is a time for silence.. You must get quiet in the Lord in order for you to HEAR from the Lord.<br>  The Lord never shouts, but is the soft voice that urges you to do the right thing.<br>  Abraham waited for 40 years until he had a son. He was 100 years old when the son of promise came thru a dried up vessel(Sarah,who was 90 when God opened her womb).<br>  Abraham waited till the Lord showed up, and it was accounted as righteousness to Abraham for waiting on the Lord.<br>  It's all up to God.<br>  You must be patient, and wait upon the Lord.<br>  Thank Him daily. Don't give up.|`|Htx64N6Caa	Your prayers go unanswered for the same reason everybody else's prayers are unanswered.|`|9GbqtmrBaa	The reason that God isn't answering prayers is because God doesn't exist. (What?) Now, honestly, what needs to happen is that you need to take a nice long look in the mirror and figure out what your issue is. "Why do I get continually dumped?" Are you taking responsibility for yourself? Or are you waiting for god(s) to bless upon you a boyfriend.<br>  <br>  I'm not much older than you, but what I know for sure is that this dating game is very much a game. And this game has rules. And if you don't abide by the rules you can't possibly win. This means die alone with a thousand and one cats and not a man in sight.<br>  <br>  Are you attractive? Are you healthy? Can you get healthier? Health is synonymous with attraction.<br>  <br>  Go get a new ward robe, go get a make over, lose any annoying habits or facial twitches you might have, quit smoking (if you smoke) lose some weight (if you are overweight) and learn how to be sexy. Men will appreciate it and you will see.<br>  <br>  And lay of the God stuff, I read like two paragraphs and I wanted to run for my life. Seriously the praying and praying and praying is setting off multiple personality defect alarms...<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|AHTi2mjCaa	If you want your prayers answered, you need to pull your hands apart and act yourself instead of relying on a god. Part of the reason your prayers are not being answered is because you expect there to be someone to answer them for you and you aren't doing it yourself.<br>  <br>  Besides, if you believe prayer actually works, you have to ask yourself, is what you are asking for worth clogging up the "airwaves" when there are millions of people dying in 3rd world countries?<br>  <br>  No offence this is real life and it doesn't cater to you, you have to work to achieve what you want and since you want a boyfriend you can keep, get out there are look for one you will stay with.|`|zH0rvMDcaa	Ok.  First of all I'm going to clarify that I'm in no way attempting to troll you.  I'm going to honestly explain exactly what I think about your question and my answer to it.  So, here we go...<br>  <br>  Despite what you wish to happen it's going to be very hard to go against millions of years of evolution.  It's not just going to go away.  Your hardwired to pro-create.  We all are. And to top it off, you're around the age where 'mother-mode' kicks in.  <br>  <br>  The only solution that I can ascertain to this problem is to shift your focus onto something that you love to do.  Do you have any hobbies?  Anything in your life that you've been wanting to try?  Are there any trips you've been wanting to take?  Something aside from church, I mean.  When stuck within the mindless mediocrity of sleep-work-home it's easy to start to feel lonely.  To wish someone else was there to share the boredom.  The solution that helped me was completely and utterly re-focusing my entire being onto something I love to do.  <br>  <br>  Now, I don't worry about a relationship at all though ironically I get more opportunities to start one than I ever did before.  In following my dream and attempting to establish a career doing what I love I have become a much more happier person.  Rising above adversity and achieving steady accomplishments leads to a measure of self-respect and self-confidence that is attractive to others.  Once you've focused on whatever it is that makes your heart sing a relationship usually follows naturally or not all - depending on your preference.  <br>  <br>  Putting your hands to work will accomplish far more than they ever will clasped in prayer.  <br>  <br>  I sincerely hope it works out for you.

Indeed the United States has sent troops abroad or militarily struck other countries' territory 216 times since independence from Britain. Since 1945 the United States has intervened in more than 20 countries throughout the world.<br>  <br>  Since World War II, the United States actually dropped BOMBS ON 23 COUNTRIES.

dqnLZaIRaa	Here's my idea:<br>  On the front: "Diaper Shower!"<br>  <br>  On the inside: "______ is having a baby and diapers are the perfect gift!  Please bring your diapers to (place) at (time) and join us for food, fun, and games!"<br>  <br>  I hope that works! :)|`|t3eJ0Y3caa	Just a quick reference to how a diaper shower works. "A diaper shower asks that the only gifts be diapers"  I have never head of this! a gift registry,yes,( and thank God for those!) but never a diaper shower. It is interesting, tho!|`|zHN43P4Haa	I hope your friend knows that she will just be getting diapers for her shower. If not, this does not sound good. There are so many things that a baby needs and that is the whole point to a baby shower.  If all she is getting is diapers you may have too many of the same size and she won't get to use them all.  Size one usually lasts until baby is less than 2 month old.  I don't think you should specify what to bring at all.  People should bring what ever the want.  I know alot of people like to make homemade quilts etc. which are so special.|`|lvMLxFSkaa	Registry...?  People are registering with department stores (and so on) for baby showers?!  How greedy.<br>  <br>  Nevertheless.  Miss Manners always said that there is no polite way to ask for a gift.

wlhMUwKsaa	No, it's the new "No child left behind" policy.  If there's one stupid kid in the class they have to dumb the whole class down to accommodate for him....|`|AA10819407	Hi, I think this is a topic of concern..<br>      Here where I live in Ga.USA. We have several exchange students<br>     living with local family's for the school year, they come from<br>       Europe(Germany) Korea, Hong Kong,Denmark, and a few other<br>        countries I can't recall right now.<br>                     These young people gave interviews on their time in our area up to this point,(6 months)<br>   They pointed out how they saw how important sports was to this community, compared to their own country, which focused heavily<br>   on their education..Thay also stated how easy our classes were, and that their courses were more challenging.Failure in their school was not an option. They failed, and they had to go looking for jobs.<br>         Sports I believe need to be included in the schedule, for <br>  health and social interactions, but not to take over the young persons life, as it does..I believe young people like you need to rally within your community, write to  Congressmen, the President, and whoever will<br>  listen, your school paper, your local paper, on your opinions on this situation as you see it. If it is truly important to you..<br>  Parents also need to become involved in their childrens education, the blame is not sports, more so lack of attention to studys, and turning a blind eye to the failing students..<br>  <br>  Some will not be able to make a living in the sports world.<br>  Those that do may not last for long, and may not have the education they need to fall back on..<br>       Go out and make the difference!!|`|d2lvgxJhaa	No, I just don't agree.<br>  <br>  I've taught in high schools in the UK and the US and they are not that much different in terms of the time spent on sports.  Those people that are big on sports will do loads of it to the detriment of their studies, however this is not a general pattern, most students don't suffer because of sport.  I actually think sports, in moderation, are beneficial to study.  They give a student structure and focus and help him or her sleep soundly at night.<br>  <br>  I think the real problem (at the high school level) is the college transcript.  High schools determine which of their students go to certain colleges, fueling rampant grade inflation.  In order to justify the grades on the transcript, teachers have to give very precise grading schemes which makes their teaching formulaic and boring.  They simply cannot afford to take risks with interesting teaching!   They also don't want to give harsh grades, in comparison to their colleagues, so everything drifts upwards and students are left unchallenged. In addition, in the US, parents and government are constantly interferring with the judgment of teachers and meddling in education as a whole.  This "no child left behind" scheme is just another classic case of ham-fisted meddling.  <br>  <br>  Rampant grade inflation is also a problem in US universities.  Again, students feel that they are paying for high grades, so the colleges take the easy route and give them what they've paid for.  Whether they've earned it or not.<br>  <br>  The countries with the best education systems are the ones that leave teaching to the teachers: Singapore, South Korea, Finland, Denmark.  The government and the parent accord great respect to teachers and the teachers respond to this trust by producing challenging and interesting teaching.  The more government interferes in teaching, the worse it becomes.<br>  <br>  Whether the big money of sport in US universities intereferes with its academic mission is indeed a contensious question.  I am not qualified to comment on that.|`|3ERx4opSaa	Well in America, we have about 60 million obese people and i think 20 million are obese children? So no way in hell are they gonna do sports on their own, so they need to have someone push them. Sports might not be educational academically, but they are socially. Like in football, sometimes you run the ball yourself sometimes you pass it to a teammate.<br>  <br>  The real problem in America's education are the parents. Most parents care nothing about what their child does, whether its flunking class, having sex, getting drunk, or getting high on crack. Parents have lost all devotion in their children, which needs to be looked at.|`|zHmZkMStaa	I don't think sports are neccesary at all in school, yet a generation ago they had both sports and good grades.  I think the problem is that BOTH parents these days are too busy working to assist with homework and enforce disciple, rules, and good study habits.|`|smVOs80xaa	They are only part of the blame and it is hard to claim that all sports are of bad or no educational value
ac275d8c81af7a6d196b0abe6ce650b1aa	they weren't treated so badly if you focus in their point of view. Their society was like governed by male so basicly that's the conception of society they had. In fact, also Aristoteles considered that slavery was the main factor for society to subsist, and that was encouraged. So basicly they are considered to mistreat women b/c we see that today, where women have "discovered" their rights (in my opinion, always existed, so i'm not the kind of person that says women are not equal to men)|`|a457e9a42af7d95c857ddbcfefd4f337aa	I honestly don't know.  However, if you look at how some of the goddesses were treated, you can see parallels in human life.  Take for example the story of Persephone.  Hades basically took her against her will and Zeus (her father) had no problem with it.  At least Demeter (Persephone's mother) was able to make nothing on the earth grow so at least she got her daughter back for part of the year.  I know there are other examples like that throughout mythology.  Look at the story of Pandora (all gifted).  She is the one who supposedly brought all misery onto mankind.  They may have been goddesses, but they were still not on the same level as the gods.|`|f61669bf5355465eee015e67e63698bbaa	They weren't treated badly by their standards.  The women had a special place in society and unlike many modern men, any man of Greece would tell you that they couldn't run a household and raise children etc.  Women today are treated badly, worse even than the Greeks.  If you are a stay-at-home mom, you are stupid, wasteful and not contributing to society.  If you are a working mom then you are depriving your children and allowing them to be raised by daycares and schools,  If you choose not to have kids, then you are selfish and immature.

They reserve "piacere" ("to like") for when we say "I love that movie!" and "I love that book!" which only means that we really liked it, not that we had romantic connections with it. They also have "volere bene" ("to wish well") which they use for loving friends in a non-romantic way.<br>  <br>  "Ti amo." = "I love you." (to a partner)<br>  "Mi è piaciuto quel film." = "I loved that movie."<br>  "Ti voglio bene!" = "I love you!" (to a friend)<br>  <br>  I'm not sure about the spiritual kind of love. I've yet to run into a language that has specific words that relate to one's experience with higher beings or with God. I mean, we have religious words in our vocabulary, but things like "blessing" and "miracle" can be used in ordinary senses as well.

In Spanish, you say, "me encanta," when referring to things you love (such as movies, foods, etc.), "te quiero," as an everyday kind of "I love you," (what you'd say to lovers, family members, etc.), and then there's "te amo," which is a very strong statement of love for another person that goes beyond "te quiero." It is sometimes said that if you're going to say "te amo" to a lover you'd better have a ring in your pocket (although that does depend on the region [Spanish has a lot of regional dialects]).

It affects you physically not to mention the Greyish landscape which kills your Morale right from the start (dull, no colors). Also ask any of your friend that has sensitive bones or a really bad injury (broken bone usually), they could usually tell you if it will rain the next day or not since they feel it in their bones. As for the Cold, it could be strickly related to the fact that your body temperature usually rises a bit during deep sleep. So when comes the cold morning under very warm bedsheets, what a painful torture!  This is why I left my Cold and Rainy country to come and live in a sunny and very hot one! I can tell you that since 7 months, I am living much happier then ever!  Good luck!

Man and woman are concepts that God created. A better question would be is God more masculine or feminine. These are characteristics that could be used to describe God. Also, in the Bible, it repeatedly uses the masculine word He not She. Also, since Jesus was a man and is God incarnate, He would want to take the form He is the most comfortable with. Another point is that Adam was the first human and was created in God's image. If God was feminine, Eve would have come first.|`|ZFllYTlpaa	When Gods Son Jesus was hanging on the cross, He turned His eyes to heaven and said Father, Father, why hast thou abandoned me?

She is also referred to as Sophia (wisdom of God) in Greco-Roman religion and especially in Gnosticism, medieval Hermetic Christianity, and Orthodox Chrisitianity.  Sophia --or Shekinah-- was neutered and reinterpreted as the Holy Spirit (iconographized as a dove) in mainstream Christianity. In major sects of Hinduism, God is considered "Mother" and is revered as a goddess. She is regarded as the form and power of God,manifesting as creation. In certain forms of Buddhism, female Buddhas are highly revered. In ancient pagan religion and modern neopagan religions, God is regarded as Goddess. <br>  <br>  Those who believe that God has a feminine aspect also generally believe that God also has a male aspect, that these ideas about God are metaphorical and functional,and that  God is ultimately beyond any attributes, including gender.<br>  <br>  <br>  Naomi , your rock!|`|pj2bnJgjaa	Your god may be a woman.  Of course, your god does not exist, it's a figment of your imagination.|`|2e6d0bf8ecab06aa35b4c1cb6fa300d5aa	I think you could be right…<br>  <br>  Shekinah (Judaism) is a visible manifestation of the presence of God, which has descended to "dwell" among men. “Shekinah” was a term used in place of "God" where the anthropomorphic expressions used in the Bible were no longer regarded as appropriate. The Shekinah is held by many to represent the feminine attributes of the presence of God. Shekinah (Shekhinah) being a feminine word in Hebrew, the AH suffix, has the feminine gender.<br>  <br>  The word for spirit in Hebrew was “Ruah” this was a feminine word, when it was translated into Greek it was translated as “Pneuma’ which neutered it.<br>  <br>  “She entered the soul of a servant of the Lord, and withstood dread kings with wonders and signs. She gave to holy people the reward of their labors; she guided them along a marvelous way, and became a shelter to them by day, and a starry flame through the night. She brought them over the Red Sea, and led them through deep waters; but she drowned their enemies, and cast them up from the depth of the sea.” (The Wisdom of Solomon 10:16-19) <br>  <br>  Notice it says “She.”<br>  <br>  “In the days when we were Hebrews we were orphaned, having only our Mother (the Spirit). Yet when we became Messianics, the Father came to be with the Mother for us.” (The Gospel of Philip 6)<br>  <br>  “She alone is the truth. She makes (the) multitude, and concerning us she teaches this alone in a love thru many.” (The Gospel of Philip 12)<br>  <br>  “Our Earthly Mother, She who sends forth her Angels to guide the roots of man and send them deep into the blessed soil. We invoke the Earthly Mother! The Holy Preserver! The Maintainer! It is She who will restore the world! The earth is hers, and the fullness thereof the world, and they that dwell therein.” (The Essene Gospel of Peace, Book Two, The Unknown Books of the Essenes)<br>  <br>  “Until you know the darkness of Sophia, you will not acquire her light. Unless you die and are reborn of the Mother Spirit, the knowledge of the resurrection will elude you.” (The Secret Gospel of Mary 56)<br>  <br>  I could go on, but there are just too many…<br>  <br>  Actually, many believed they were a couple, the father, son and holly (ruah – female) spirit.<br>  <br>  “El” is the masculine singular Hebrew word for “God.” “Eloah” is the feminine form of “God.” In Hebrew, the “ah” suffix makes a word feminine. “Elohim” is a combination of the singular feminine word “Eloah,” to which the masculine plural suffix “im” has been added. In Genesis it speaks of how the “Elohim” (plural) created him and her in our image. Was that a royal our or did it mean our as in both of us? That’s why the Rabbi’s had to create Lilith, Adams first wife in order for the text to make sense<br>  <br>  (Nag Hammdi Library, the lost gospels) In the Gospel of the Hebrews that the Nazarenes read, Yeshua says, "Even so did my mother, the Holy Spirit, take me by one of my hairs and carry me away to the great mountain Tabor [in Galilee]." It also says, "Just now my mother, the Holy Spirit, took me." Yeshua refers to the Holy Spirit as his mother. The Acts of Thomas gives a graphic account of the Apostle Thomas when he went into India with Abbanes the merchant and contains within it prayers invoking the Holy Spirit as "the Mother of all creation," “She that revealeth the hidden mysteries,” "compassionate mother," “mother of the seven houses,” along with many other titles. These Coptic Christian writings unquestionably link the "spirit of Spirit" as the "Spirit of the Divine Mother." “We glorify and praise thee and thine invisible Father and thine holy spirit the mother of all creation.” (Acts of Thomas 39)<br>  <br>  Jesus even said he was the true vine and his father was the husbandman. Husbands generally have a wife. It wasn’t until man decided to hide the consort under the neutered term Holy Spirit has she disappeared, but if you search hard enough you can find her.|`|pOlDMXWdaa	I kind of think God doesn't technically have a gender, per say, but, since the Bible refers to Him as He though out.

You aint convinced, go look in Saudi Arabia...the lair of the Islamic beast itself. Non-muslims who go there (foreign workers in particular) are forbidden to display their religious symbols (especially Christians, they cant bring their bible and crosses in public). Women in Saudi Arabia are treated differently and as inferior to men (they cant even drive a car!!!). Of course not all Muslim nations are this barbaric and backward (excellent examples include Turkey, Egypt, Indonesia and Malaysia)...but the mere fact that this is allowed to happen in the supposed heart of Islam speaks volumes about Islam as a whole..<br>  <br>  To all Muslims everywhere...what are you trying to pull on us non-Muslims? Tell us the truth about your religion...is it one for peace or are you guys really trying to kill us? Why do I think this...simple. 90-99% of Islam is supposedly peaceful and different from Osama and Fiends...but few (less than 10-20% at worse) have summoned the courage to stand up to Osama and his Fiends.

Through subterfuge and concealment, many of today’s Church leaders and faithful Christians have camouflaged the Christianity of Adolf Hitler and have attempted to mark him an atheist, a pagan cult worshipper, or a false Christian in order to place his misdeeds on those with out Jesus.  However, from the earliest formation of the Nazi party and throughout the period of conquest and growth, Hitler expressed his Christian support to the German citizenry and soldiers. Those who would make Hitler an atheist should turn their eyes to history books before they address their pews and chat rooms.<br>  <br>      Considering that Christianity has thus far been incapable of producing an unbiased, educated follower which speaks the truth, (I haven’t encountered any), I have been forced to dispel the myth by writing this essay.

This is important information to take into consideration for I am privy to some info that most Americans do not know.  It is common for American media and education institutions to lie to their citizens concerning Nazi Germany.)  So, in presenting this information I must break it into four parts: 1) Facts about Hitler and his involvement with the Church.  2) How the Church was the catalyst for anti- Semitism.  3) Facts concerning how the Nazi regime drilled these beliefs into Germanic society.  4) Quotes Hitler made which prove he had a disdain for atheism/occultism, upheld his Christian faith, and hated Jews due to his Christianity.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Hitler’s involvement with the Church:<br>  <br>  a) Hitler was baptized as Roman Catholic during infancy in Austria.<br>  <br>  b) As Hitler approached boyhood he attended a monastery school.  (On his way to school young Adolf daily observed a stone arch which was carved with the monastery’s coat of arms bearing a swastika.)<br>  <br>  c) Hitler was a communicant and an altar boy in the Catholic Church.<br>  <br>  d) As a young man he was confirmed as a “soldier of Christ.”  His most ardent goal at the time was to become a priest.  Hitler writes of his love for the church and clergy: “I had excellent opportunity to intoxicate myself with the solemn splendor of the brilliant church festivals.  As was only natural, the abbot seemed to me, as the village priest had once seemed to my father, the highest and most desirable ideal.”  -Adolf Hitler (Mein Kampf)<br>  <br>  e) Hitler was NEVER excommunicated nor condemned by his church.  Matter of fact the Church felt he was JUST and “avenging for God” in attacking the Jews for they deemed the Semites the killers of Jesus.<br>  <br>  f) Hitler, Franco and Mussolini were given VETO power over whom the pope could appoint as a bishop in Germany, Spain and Italy.  In turn they surtaxed the Catholics and gave the money to the Vatican.  Hitler wrote a speech in which he talks about this alliance, this is an excerpt: “The fact that the Vatican is concluding a treaty with the new Germany means the acknowledgement of the National Socialist state by the Catholic Church.  This treaty shows the whole world clearly and unequivocally that the assertion that National Socialism [Nazism] is hostile to religion is a lie.”  Adolf Hitler, 22 July 1933, writing to the Nazi Party<br>  <br>  Hitler and the Popeg) Hitler worked CLOSELY with Pope Pius in converting Germanic society and supporting the church.  The Church absorbed Nazi ideals and preached them as part of their sermons in turn Hitler placed Catholic teachings in public education.  This photo depicts Hitler with Archbishop Cesare Orsenigo, the papal nuncio in Berlin.  It was taken On April 20, 1939, when Orsenigo celebrated Hitler’s birthday.  The celebrations were initiated by Pacelli (Pope Pius XII) and became a tradition.<br>  <br>  Each April 20, Cardinal Bertram of Berlin was to send “warmest congratulations to the Fuhrer in the name of the bishops and the dioceses in Germany with “fervent prayers which the Catholics of Germany are sending to heaven on their altars.”  (If you would like to know more about the secret dealings of Hitler and the Pope I recommend you get a book titled: Hitler’s Pope: The Secret History of Pius XII, by John Cornwell)<br>  <br>  h) Due to Hitler’s involvement with the Church he began enacting doctrines of the Church as law.  He outlawed all abortion, raged a death war on all homosexuals, and demanded corporal punishment in schools and home.  Many times Hitler addressed the church and promised that Germany would implement its teachings: “The National Socialist State professes its allegiance to positive Christianity.  It will be its honest endeavor to protect both the great Christian Confessions in their rights, to secure them from interference with their doctrines (Lehren), and in their duties to constitute a harmony with the views and the exigencies of the State of today.”  –Adolf Hitler, on 26 June 1934, to Catholic bishops to assure them that he would take action against the new pagan propaganda “Providence has caused me to be Catholic, and I know therefore how to handle this Church.”  -Adolf Hitler, reportedly to have said in Berlin in 1936 on the enmity of the Catholic Church to National Socialism<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  How Christianity was the catalyst of the Holocaust:<br>  <br>  Hitler’s anti-Semitism grew out of his Christian education.  Austria and Germany were majorly Christian during his time and they held the belief that Jews were an inferior status to Aryan Christians.  The Christians blamed the Jews for the killing of Jesus.  Jewish hatred did not actually spring from Hitler, it came from the preaching of Catholic priests and Protestant ministers throughout Germany for hundreds of years.  The Protestant leader, Martin Luther, himself, held a livid hatred for Jews and their Jewish religion.  In his book, “On the Jews and their Lies,” Luther set the standard for Jewish hatred in Protestant Germany up until World War 2.  Hitler expressed a great admiration for Martin Luther constantly quoting his works and beliefs.<br>  <br>  Now, you must remember before Hitler rose to Chancellor of Germany the country was in a deep economic depression due to the Versailles treaty.  The Versailles treaty demanded that Germans made financial reparations for the previous war and Germany simply was not self sufficient enough in order to pay the debt. Hitler was the leader that raised Germany out of the depression and brought them back to a world recognized power.  Due to his annulment of the financial woes of the Germanic people he became their redeemer and they anointed him as the leader of the German Reich Christian Church in 1933.  This placed him in power of the German Christian Socialist movement which legislates their political and religious agendas. It united all denominations, mainly the Protestant/Catholic and Lutheran people to instill faith in a national Christianity.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  How the Nazi Regime converted the people:<br>  <br>  a) In the 1920s, Hitler’s German Workers’ Party (pre Nazi term) adopted a “Programme” with twenty-five points (the Nazi version of a constitution).  In point twenty-four, their intent clearly demonstrates, from the very beginning, their stand in favor of a “positive” Christianity: “We demand liberty for all religious denominations in the State, so far as they are not a danger to it and do not militate against the morality and moral sense of the German race.  The Party, as such, stands for positive Christianity, but does not bind itself in the matter of creed to any particular confession...”<br>  <br>  b) The Nazi regime started a youth movement which preached its agenda to impressionable children.  Hitler backed up the notion that all people need faith and religious education: “By helping to raise man above the level of bestial vegetation, faith contributes in reality to the securing and safeguarding of his existence.  Take away from present-day mankind its education-based, religious- dogmatic principles-- or, practically speaking, ethical-moral principles-- by abolishing this religious education, but without replacing it by an equivalent, and the result will be a grave shock to the foundations of their existence.”  – Adolf Hitler (Mein Kampf)<br>  <br>  c) The Nazi regime began to control schools insisting that Christianity was taught.<br>  <br>  d) The Nazi regime included anti-Semitic Christian writings in textbooks and they were not removed from Christian doctrines until 1961.<br>  <br>  e) The Nazi regime having full blown power over the people began to forcibly convert all its military.<br>  <br>  Nazi Belt Bucklef) The Nazi regime forced the German soldiers to wear religious symbols such as the swastika and they placed religious sayings on military gear.  An example here is this German army belt buckle (I believe my Opa had one) which reads “Gott Mit Uns”.  For those of you who do not speak German it is translated as “God With Us”.<br>  <br>  g) The German troops were often forced to get sprinkled with holy water and listen to a sermon by a Catholic priest before going out on a maneuver.<br>  <br>  h) The Nazis created a secret service called the “SS Reich” that would act as spies on the dealings of other citizens.  If anyone was suspected of heresy (Going not only against the Socialist party but CHURCH DOCTRINE) they would be prosecuted.<br>  <br>  I Agree with truth revealed, you should get your facts straight|`|cad39442f6542b58ad163c28032a3ea1aa	ZIONISM TODAY<br>  Christian and Muslims are seen as subhuman and are forced to use color coded license plates that easily identify them as non-Jewish.

[I] tend to support the latter view and have an additional argument:...the need to sustain the character of the state which will henceforth be Jewish...with a non-Jewish minority limited to 15 percent.

The following points will make it clear, that far from being spread by the sword, it was the inherent force of truth, reason and logic that was responsible for the rapid spread of Islam.<br>  <br>  <br>  1.   Islam means peace.<br>  <br>  Islam comes from the root word ‘salaam’, which means peace. It also means submitting one’s will to Allah (swt). Thus Islam is a religion of peace, which is acquired by submitting one’s will to the will of the Supreme Creator, Allah (swt).<br>  <br>  <br>  2.   Sometimes force has to be used to maintain peace.<br>  <br>  Each and every human being in this world is not in favour of maintaining peace and harmony. There are many, who would disrupt it for their own vested interests. Sometimes force has to be used to maintain peace. It is precisely for this reason that we have the police who use force against criminals and anti-social elements to maintain peace in the country. Islam promotes peace. At the same time, Islam exhorts it followers to fight where there is oppression. The fight against oppression may, at times, require the use of force. In Islam force can only be used to promote peace and justice.<br>  <br>  <br>  3.   Opinion of historian De Lacy O’Leary.<br>  <br>  The best reply to the misconception that Islam was spread by the sword is given by the noted historian De Lacy O’Leary in the book "Islam at the cross road" (Page 8):<br>  <br>  "History makes it clear however, that the legend of fanatical Muslims sweeping through the world and forcing Islam at the point of the sword upon conquered races is one of the most fantastically absurd myth that historians have ever repeated."<br>  <br>  <br>  4.   Muslims ruled Spain for 800 years.<br>  <br>  Muslims ruled Spain for about 800 years. The Muslims in Spain never used the sword to force the people to convert. Later the Christian Crusaders came to Spain and wiped out the Muslims. There was not a single Muslim in Spain who could openly give the adhan, that is the call for prayers.<br>  <br>  <br>  5.   14 million Arabs are Coptic Christians.<br>  <br>  Muslims were the lords of Arabia for 1400 years. For a few years the British ruled, and for a few years the French ruled. Overall, the Muslims ruled Arabia for 1400 years. Yet today, there are 14 million Arabs who are Coptic Christians i.e. Christians since generations. If the Muslims had used the sword there would not have been a single Arab who would have remained a Christian.<br>  <br>  <br>  6.   More than 80% non-Muslims in India.<br>  <br>  The Muslims ruled India for about a thousand years. If they wanted, they had the power of converting each and every non-Muslim of India to Islam. Today more than 80% of the population of India are non-Muslims. All these non-Muslim Indians are bearing witness today that Islam was not spread by the sword.<br>  <br>  <br>  7.   Indonesia and Malaysia.<br>  <br>  Indonesia is a country that has the maximum number of Muslims in the world. The majority of people in Malaysia are Muslims. May one ask, "Which Muslim army went to Indonesia and Malaysia?"<br>  <br>  <br>  8.   East Coast of Africa.<br>  <br>  Similarly, Islam has spread rapidly on the East Coast of Africa. One may again ask, if Islam was spread by the sword, "Which Muslim army went to the East Coast of Africa?"<br>  <br>   <br>  9.   Thomas Carlyle.<br>  <br>  The famous historian, Thomas Carlyle, in his book "Heroes and Hero worship", refers to this misconception about the spread of Islam: "The sword indeed, but where will you get your sword? Every new opinion, at its starting is precisely in a minority of one. In one man’s head alone. There it dwells as yet. One man alone of the whole world believes it, there is one man against all men. That he takes a sword and try to propagate with that, will do little for him. You must get your sword! On the whole, a thing will propagate itself as it can."<br>  <br>  <br>  10.   No compulsion in religion.<br>  <br>  With which sword was Islam spread? Even if Muslims had it they could not use it to spread Islam because the Qur’an says in the following verse:<br>  <br>  "Let there be no compulsion in religion:<br>  Truth stands out clear from error"<br>                                  [Al-Qur’an 2:256]<br>  <br>  <br>  11.   Sword of the Intellect.<br>  <br>  It is the sword of intellect. The sword that conquers the hearts and minds of people. The Qur’an says in Surah Nahl, chapter 16 verse 125:<br>  <br>  "Invite (all) to the way of thy Lord<br>  with wisdom and beautiful preaching;<br>  and argue with them in ways that are<br>  best and most gracious."<br>                                [Al-Qur’an 16:125]<br>  <br>  <br>  12.   Increase in the world religions from 1934 to 1984.<br>  <br>  An article in Reader’s Digest ‘Almanac’, year book 1986, gave the statistics of the increase of percentage of the major religions of the world in half a century from 1934 to 1984. This article also appeared in ‘The Plain Tru|`|qCBWlmnMaa	Ok, Islam spread over a wide area due to trade, the Middle Eastern people were famous for making fine textiles which were sold for a lot of money/gold. Many of these traders became Muslim and traders travel around the world which is why Islam spread to places such as Africa and India. <br>  <br>  The divisions... hmmm, I think I know what hes talking about, I think hes talking about the Safavid empire, the Mughal Empire, and the Turkish empire, these are the 3 empires. Im not sure about the time frame or else I would list it. I believe the Safavid Empire were in the Indian region, the Mughal Empire were in the Mongol area, and the Turkish empire was around the Middle East. You might have to check my answers on the Mughal and the Turkish, but im fairly certain that the Safavid empire was in India. <br>  <br>  The Decline of the Arabs was due to the Mongols attacking it from Chinggis Khan who was the grandson of Kubalai Khan.

It would make more sense to say something like "Tuesdays, I like to go out with friends" or something like that.  Even in english, it sounds kinda weird to say that about friends, because it implies that you only like friends on tuesdays?  I would say "Los martes, me gusta salir con mis amigos" = "Tuesdays, I like to go out with my friends"<br>  For wednesday (miércoles), you should spell check "navagar", the word is "navegar".<br>  For thursday, it should be "pasar tiempo solo" and "mirar television" or "mirar al televisor" or "mirar la tele"<br>  For Saturday, "EN bicicleta"<br>  For sunday "los domingoS"<br>  Otherwise, good job!  For conjugating verbs, ANY verb in spanish, it doesn't matter if the person you are talking about is male or female.  That only effects the pronoun ("El, ella, ellos, ellas, etc")  Only the number of people (1st, 2nd, or third person, and plurality) affect conjugation

0cc161ff5c4a48e6e463a279c916b3d0aa	Let me say, I've never been on one. Let me also say that finding anything out is difficult because the retreat is supposed to be secret. The best I could find was a post on FactNet. While some of the responses told the questioner not to worry, none seemed to contradict her description:<br>  <br>  "In order to graduate from my catholic high school everyone must go on a 4 day retreat called 'Kairos'. The entire retreat is almost all student led- that is, kids my age whom have already been on the retreat. The 'leaders' (as they are refered to as) are all selected on their application and 'public speaking ability'. The entire retreat is clouded in mystery. No one is supposed to discuss the retreat and there is segrigation between those who are 'leaders', those who have already attended Kairos and those who have not. Through a secret source I have found out what exactly happens on this retreat. At the convent (where the retreat is held) all clocks are taken down or shut off. The first day of retreat, you are subjected to hours and hours of the leaders and their 'public speaking abilities'. Sleep and food are deprived, especially on the first day. You are not allowed to bring cell phones, money, cigarettes, clocks or watches, drugs (even over-the-counter medications, CD players, radios, or anything else that would give someone contact to the outside world. Your belongings are searched for these items. Then, unknown to the people on the retreat, letters written by your parents are read out-loud to the entire group by the 'leaders'. Then you are sent back to your room, alone, where you will find a stack of letters all written by fellow class-mates, siblings, friends, etc. The next 3 days are followed with more sleep deprivation (my source says you get about 4-6 hours every night), and a diet of high sugar, high caffine, high fat foods. Then you are split into 'small groups' with a 'leader' to lead each group. These groups are designed to share your most personal of stories or experiences. Everyone is supposed to cry, as if it is planned. The same inspirational songs are played every day and at least an hour a day is left to 'meditation'. You are not allowed to call your parents or friends. All phones within your access are disconnected and the retreat is held in another state. Does this sound like brainwashing????? Please help me, I am leaving soon."

I'm aware that black people could like other foods, and I like other foods, and I also enjoy the occasional fried chicken (although it's pretty damn greasy so I don't eat it constantly like some people do.)

Many arabic families are not happy with mixed marriages ( nationalities and religions). The problem as I can see it - his family. In Arab culture people do no go against their parents` decision.

Master's degree in Divinity <br>  "What happened to you?" This was usually the first reaction I encountered when my former classmates, friends and co-pastors saw me after having embraced Islam. I suppose I couldn't blame them, I was a highly unlikely the person to change religions. Formerly, I was a professor, pastor, church planter and missionary. If anyone was a radical fundamentalist it was I. <br>  <br>  I had just graduated with my Master's Degree of Divinity from an elite seminary five months before. It was after that time I met a lady who had worked in Saudi Arabia and had embraced Islam. Of course I asked her about the treatment of women in Islam. I was shocked at her answer, it wasn't what I expected so I proceeded to ask other questions relating to Allah and Muhammad (pbuh). She informed me that she would take me to the Islamic Center where they would be better able to answer my questions. <br>  <br>  Being prayed up, meaning-asking Jesus for protection against demon spirits seeing that what we had been taught about Islam is that it is Demonic and Satanic religion. Having taught Evangelism I was quite shocked at their approach, it wa s direct and straightforward. No intimidation, no harassment, no psychological manipulation, no subliminal influence! None of this, "let's have a Qur'aanic study in your house", like a counter part of the Bible study. I couldn't believe it! They gave me some books and told me if I had some questions they were available to answer them in the office. That night I read all of the books they gave. It was the first time I had ever read a book about Islam written by a Muslim, we had studied and read books about Islam only written by Christians. The next day I spent three hours at the office asking questions. This went on everyday for a week, by which time I had read twelve books and knew why Muslims are the hardest people in the world to conver t to Christianity. Why? Because there is nothing to offer them!! (In Islam) There is a relationship with Allah, forgiveness of sins, salvation and promise of Eternal Life. <br>  <br>  Naturally, my first question centered on the deity of Allah. Who is this Allah that the Muslims worship? We had been taught as Christians that this is another god, a false god. When in fact He is the Omniscient-All Know ing, Omnipotent-All Powerful, and Omnipresent-All Present God. The One and Only without co-partners or co-equal. It is interesting to note that there were bishops during the first three hundred years of the Church that were teaching as the Muslim believes that Jesus (pbuh) was a prophet and teacher!! It was only after the conversion of Emperor Constantine that he was the one to call and introduce the doctrine of the Trinity. He a convert to Christianity who knew nothing of this religion introduced a paganistic concept that goes back to Babylonian times. Because the space does not permit me to go into detail about the subject insha'Allah, another time. Only I must point out that the word TRINITY is not found in the Bible in any of its many translation nor is it found in the original Greek or Hebrew languages! <br>  <br>  My other important question centered on Muhammad (pbuh). Who is this Muhammad? I found out that Muslims do not pray to him like the Christians pray to Jesus. He is not an intermediary and in fact it is forbidden to pray to him. We ask blessing upon him at the end of our prayer but likewise we ask blessings on Abraham. He is a Prophet and a Messenger, the final and last Prophet. In fact, until now, one thousand four hundred and eighteen years (1,418) later there has been no prophet after him. His message is for All Mankind as opposed to the message of Jesus or Moses (peace be upon them both) which was sent to the Jews. "Hear O Israel" But the message is the same message of Allah. "The Lord Your God is One God and you shall have no other gods before Me."(Mark 12:29). <br>  <br>  Because prayer was a very important part of my Christian life I was both interested and curious to know what the Muslims were praying. As Christians we were as ignorant on this aspect of Muslim belief as on the other aspects. We thought and were taught, that the Muslims were bowing down to the Ka'bah (in Mecca), that that was there god and center point of this false deity. Again, I was shocked to learn that the manner of prayer is prescribed by God, Himself. The words of the prayer are one of praise and exaltation. The approach to prayer (ablution or washing) in cleanliness is under the direction of Allah. He is a Holy God and it is not for us to approach Him in an arbitrary manner but only reasonable that He should tell us how we should approach Him. <br>  <br>  At the end of that week after having spent eight (8) years of formal theological studies I knew cognitively (head knowledge) that Islam was true. But I did not embrace Islam at that time because I did not believe it in my heart. I continued to pray, to read the Bible, to attend lectures at the Islamic Center. I was in earnest asking and seeking God's direction. It is not easy to change your religion. I did not want to loose my salvation if there was salvation to loose. I continued to be shocked and amazed at what I was learning because it was not what I was taught that Islam believed. In my Master's level, the professor I had was respected as an authority on Islam yet his teaching and that of Christianity in general is full of Misunderstanding. He and many Christians like him are sincere but they are sincerely wrong. <br>  <br>  Two months later after having once again prayed seeking God's direction, I felt something drop into my being! I sat up, and it was the first time I was to use the name of Allah, and I said, "Allah, I believe you are the One and Only True God." There was peace that descended upon me and from that day four years ago until now I have never regretted embracing Islam. This decision did not come without trial. I was fired from my job as I was teaching in two Bible Colleges at that time , ostracized by my former classmates, professors and co-pastors, disowned by my husband's family, misunderstood by my adult children and made a suspicion by my own government. Without the faith that enables man to stand up to Satanic forces I would not ha ve been able to withstand all of this. I am ever so grateful to Allah that I am a Muslim and may I live and die a Muslim. <br>  <br>  "Truly, my prayer, my service of sacrifice, my life and my death are all for God the Cherisher of the Worlds. No partner has He, this I am commanded. And I am the first of those who bow to Allah in Islam." <br>  <br>  (Holy Qur'aan 6:162-163) <br>  <br>  Sister Khadijah Watson <br>  <br>  Sister Khadijah Watson is presently working as a teacher for women in one of the Da'wah (Invitation To Islam) Centers in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia <br>  <br>  more stories <br>  <a href="http://www.islamdoor.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.islamdoor.com</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.thetruereligion.org/priests.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.thetruereligion.org/priests.h...</a> <br>  .............. <br>  Answers to FAQ about Islam <br>  <br>  <br>  1. What is Islam? <br>  <br>  The word "Islam" means peace and submission. Peace means to be at peace with yourself and your surroundings and submission means submission to the will of God. A broader meaning of the word "Islam" is to achieve peace by submitting to the will of God. <br>  <br>  <br>  This is a unique religion with a name which signifies a moral attitude and a way of life. Judaism takes its name from the tribe of Juda, Christianity from Jesus Christ, Buddhism from Goutam Buddha and Hinduism from Indus River. However, Muslims derive their identity from the message of Islam, rather than the person of Muhammed (P), thus should not be called "Muhammadans". <br>  <br>  <br>  2. Who is Allah? <br>  <br>  Allah is the Arabic word for "one God". Allah is not God of Muslims only. He is God of all creations, because He is their Creator and Sustainer. <br>  <br>  <br>  3. Who is a Muslim? <br>  <br>  The word "Muslim" means one who submits to the will of God. This is done by declaring that "there is no god except one God and Muhammad is the messenger of God." In a broader sense, anyone who willingly submits to the will of God is a Muslim. Thus, all the prophets preceding the prophet Muhammad are considered Muslims. The Quran specifically mentions Abraham who lived long before Moses and Christ that, "he was not a Jew or a Christian but a Muslim," because, he had submitted to the will of God. Thus there are Muslims who are not submitting at all to the will of God and there are Muslims who are doing their best to live an Islamic life. One cannot judge Islam by looking at those individuals who have a Muslim name but in their actions, they are not living or behaving as Muslims. The extent of being a Muslim can be according to the degree to which one is submitting to the will of God, in his beliefs and his actions. <br>  <br>  <br>  4. Who was Muhammad? (P) <br>  <br>  In brief, Muhammad (Peace be upon him) was born in a noble tribe of Mecca in Arabia in the year 570 AD. His ancestry goes back to Prophet Ishmael (P), son of Prophet Abraham (P). His father died before his birth and his mother died when he was six. He did not attend a formal school since he was raised first by a nurse as it was the custom those days, and then by his grandfather and uncle. As a young man, he was known as a righteous person who used to meditate in a cave. At age 40, he was given the prophethood when the angel, Gabriel, appeared in the cave. Subsequently, the revelations came over 23 years and were compiled in the form of a book called the Quran which Muslims consider as the final and the last word of God. The Quran has been preserved, unchanged, in its original form and confirms the truth in the Torah, the psalms and the Gospel. <br>  <br>  <br>  5. Do Muslims worship Muhammad? (P) <br>  <br>  No. Muslims do not worship Muhammad (P) or any other prophets. Muslims believe in all prophets including Adam, Noah, Abraham, David, Solomon, Moses and Jesus. Muslims believe that Muhammad (P) was the last of the prophets. They believe that God alone is to be worshiped, not any human being. <br>  <br>  <br>  6. What do Muslims think of Jesus? (P) <br>  <br>  Muslims think highly of Jesus (P) and his worthy mother, Mary. The Quran tells us that Jesus was born of a miraculous birth without a father. "Lo! The likeness of Jesus with Allah is the likeness of Adam. He created him of dust, and then He said unto him: Be and he is" (Quran 3.59). He was given many miracles as a prophet. These include speaking soon after his birth in defense of his mother's piety. God's other gifts to him included healing the blind and the sick, reviving the dead, making a bird out of clay and most importantly, the message he was carrying. These miracles were given to him by God to establish him as a prophet. According to the Quran, he was not crucified but was raised into Heaven. (Quran, Chapter Maryam) <br>  <br>  <br>  9. What is the purpose of worship in Islam? <br>  <br>  The purpose of worship in Islam is to be God conscious. Thus the worship, whether it is prayer, fasting, or charity, is a means to achieve God consciousness so that when one becomes conscious of God, in thought and in action, he is in a better position to receive His bounties both in this world and the hereafter. <br>  <br>  <br>  10. Do Muslims believe in the hereafter? <br>  <br>  God is Just and manifest His justice, He established the system of accountability. Those who do good will be rewarded and those who do wrong will be punished accordingly. Thus, He created Heaven and Hell and there are admission criteria for both. Muslims believe that the present life is a temporary one. It is a test and if we pass the test, we will be given a life of permanent pleasure in the company of good people in Heaven. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  12. What is the dress code for Muslims? <br>  <br>  Islam emphasizes modesty. No person should be perceived as a sex object. There are certain guidelines both for men and women that their dress should neither be too thin nor too tight to reveal body forms. For men, they must at least cover the area from the knee to navel and for women, their dress should cover all areas except the hands and face. The veil is not essential. <br>  <br>  <br>  13. What are the dietary prohibitions in Islam? <br>  <br>  Muslims are told in the Quran not to eat pork or pork products, meat of the animals who died before being slaughtered or the carnivorous animals (as they eat dead animals), nor drink blood or intoxicants such as wine or use any illicit drugs. <br>  <br>  <br>  14. What is Jihad? <br>  <br>  The word "Jihad" means struggle, or to be specific, striving in the cause of God. Any struggle done in day-to-day life to please God can be considered Jihad. One of the highest levels of Jihad is to stand up to a tyrant and speak a word of truth. Control of the self from wrong doings is also a great Jihad. One of the forms of Jihad is to take up arms in defense of Islam or a Muslim country when Islam is attacked. This kind of Jihad has to be declared by the religious leadership or by a Muslim head of state who is following the Quran and Sunnah. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  15. Was Islam spread by the sword? <br>  <br>  According to the Quran, "There is no compulsion in religion" (2:256), thus, no one can be forced to become a Muslim. <br>  <br>  The Junior Encyclopaedia of Canada says: <br>  <br>  "Islam is the fastest growing religion world-wide" (The Junior Encyclopaedia of Canada, Hurtig Publishers, Canada, 1990, Vol2, p396) <br>  <br>  What explains this phenomenon? Who is forcing anyone today to become Muslims? Muslims are not even engaged in active preaching in any noticeable degree. People are voluntarily coming into Islam because they find Islam makes sense. <br>  <br>  Huston Smith discusses in his book entitled The World's Religions, on page 256, how the Prophet Mohammed, on whom be peace, granted freedom of religion to the Jews and Christians under Muslim rule. The Prophet had a document drawn up in which he stipulated that Jews and Christians "shall be protected from all insults and vexations; they shall have an equal right with our own people to our assistance and good offices," and furthermore, that they shall "practice their religion as freely as the Muslims"(Quoted in the World's religions by Huston Smith, Harper Collins, 1991, p256) Smith points out that Muslims regard that document as "the first charter of freedom of conscience in human history and the authoritative model for those of every subsequent Muslim state"(p256) <br>  <br>  So, was Islam spread by the sword? The following short answer comes from Ira ZeppJr, a non-Muslim, in his book entitled A Muslim Primer: <br>  <br>  "It is unfortunate that Islam has been stereotyped as the 'religion of the sword' or that Islam was spread by the sword.' The historical reality is that the expansion of Islam was usually by persuasion and not by military power. In any case, Islam cannot be forced on anyone; if profession of the shahadah (i.e. the declaration of Islam) is forced on someone, it is not true Islam" (A Muslim Primer by Ira Zepp, Jr., 1992, Wakefield Editions, US, p134) <br>  <br>  <br>  16. Does Islam promote violence and terrorism? <br>  <br>  No. Islam is religion of peace and submission and stresses on the sanctity of human life. A verse in the Quran says, [Chapter 5, verse 32], that "anyone who saves one life, it is as if he has saved the whole of mankind and anyone who has killed another person (except in lieu of murder or mischief on earth) it is as if he has killed the whole of mankind." Islam condemns all the violence which happened in the Crusades, in Spain, in WW II, or by acts of people like the Rev. Jim Jones, David Koresh, Dr. Baruch Goldstein, or the atrocities committed in Bosniaby the Christian Serbs. Anyone who is doing violence is not practicing his religion at that time. However, sometimes violence is a human response of oppressed people as it happens in Palestine. Although this is wrong, they think of this as a way to get attention. There is a lot of terrorism and violence in areas where there is no Muslim presence. For example, in Ireland, South Africa, Latin America, and Sri Lanka. Sometimes the violence is due to a struggle between those who have with those who do not have, or between those who are oppressed with those who are oppressors. We need to find out why people become terrorists. Unfortunately, the Palestinians who are doing violence are called terrorists, but not the armed Israeli settlers when they do the same sometimes even against their own people. As it turned out to be in the Oklahoma City bombing, sometime Muslims are prematurely blamed even if the terrorism is committed by non-Muslims. Sometimes those who want Peace and those who oppose Peace can be of the same religion. <br>  <br>  <br>  17. What is "Islamic Fundamentalism"? <br>  <br>  There is no concept of "Fundamentalism" in Islam. The western media has coined this term to brand those Muslims who wish to return to the basic fundamental principles of Islam and mould their lives accordingly. Islam is a religion of moderation and a practicing God fearing Muslim can neither be a fanatic nor an extremist. <br>  <br>  <br>  18. Does Islam promote polygamy? <br>  <br>  No, polygamy in Islam is a permission not an injunction. Historically, all the prophets except Jesus, who was not married, had more than one wife. For Muslim men to have more than one wife is a permission which is given to them in the Quran, not to satisfy lust, but for the welfare of the widows and the orphans of the wars. In the pre-Islamic period, men used to have many wives. One person had 11 wives and when he became Muslim, he asked the Prophet Muhammad (P), "What should I do with so many wives?" and he said, "Divorce all except the four." The Quran says, "you can marry 2 or 3 and up to 4 women if you can be equally just with each of them" (4:3). Since it is very difficult to be equally just with all wives, in practice, most of the Muslim men do not have more than one wife. Prophet Muhammad (P) himself from age 24 to 50 was married to only one woman, Khadija. In the western society, some men who have one wife have many extramarital affairs. Thus, a survey was published in "U.S.A. Today" (April 4, 1988 Section D) which asked 4,700 mistresses what they would like their status to be. They said that "they preferred being a second wife rather than the 'other woman' because they did not have the legal rights, nor did they have the financial equality of the legally married wives, and it appeared that they were being used by these men." <br>  <br>  <br>  19. Does Islam oppress women? <br>  <br>  No. On the contrary, Islam elevated the status of women 1,400 years ago by giving them the right to divorce, the right to have financial independence and support and the right to be identified as dignified women (Hijab) when in the rest of the world, including Europe, women had no such rights. Women are equal to men in all acts of piety (Quran 33:32). Islam allows women to keep their maiden name after marriage, their earned money and spend it as they wish, and ask men to be their protector as women on the street can be molested. Prophet Muhammad (P) told Muslim men, "the best among you is the one who is best to his family." Not Islam, but some Muslim men, do oppress women today. This is because of their cultural habits or their ignorance about their religion. Female Genital Mutilations has nothing to do with Islam. It is a pre Islamic African Custom, practiced by non Muslims including coptic Christians as well. <br>  <br>  <br>  20. Is Islam intolerant of other religious minorities? <br>  <br>  Islam recognizes the rights of the minority. To ensure their welfare and safety, Muslim rulers initiated a tax (Jazia) on them. Prophet Muhammad (P) forbade Muslim armies to destroy churches and synagogues. Caliph Umer did not even allow them to pray inside a church. Jews were welcomed and flourished in Muslim Spain even when they were persecuted in the rest of Europe. They consider that part of their history as the Golden Era. In Muslim countries, Christians live in prosperity, hold government positions and attend their church. Christian missionaries are allowed to establish and operate their schools and hospitals. However, the same religious tolerance is not always available to Muslim minorities as seen in the past during Spanish inquisition and the crusades, or as seen now by the events in Bosnia, Israel and India. Muslims do recognize that sometimes the actions of a ruler does not reflect the teachings of his religion. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  21. How should Muslims treat Jews and Christians? <br>  <br>  The Quran calls them "People of the Book", i.e., those who received Divine scriptures before Muhammad (P). Muslims are told to treat them with respect and justice and do not fight with them unless they initiate hostilities or ridicule their faith. The Muslims ultimate hope is that they all will join them in worshipping one God and submit to His will. <br>  <br>  <br>  "Say (O Muhammad): O people of the Book (Jews and Christians) come to an agreement between us and you, that we shall worship none but Allah, and that we shall take no partners with Him, and none of us shall take others for Lords beside Allah. And if they turn away, then say: Bear witness that we are those who have surrendered (unto Him)." (Quran 3:64) <br>  <br>  <br>  What about Hindus, Bahai, Buddhists and members of other religions? <br>  <br>  They should also be treated with love, respect, and understanding to make them recipients of Invitations to Islam. <br>  <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------... <br>  <br>  Almighty God is Compassionate, Loving and Merciful. The essence of falsehood is the claim that God cannot deal with and forgive His creatures directly. By over-emphasizing the burden of sin, as well as claiming that God cannot forgive you directly, false religions seek to get people to despair of the Mercy of God. Once they are convinced that they cannot approach God directly, people can be mislead into turning to false gods for help. These "false gods" can take various forms, such as saints, angels, or someone who is believed to be the "Son of God" or "God Incarnate". <br>  <br>  <br>  The original, unchanged revelations given to Abraham and other prophets(like Moses and Jesus ) reaching back to Adam all came from the One True God(The Creator). This common origin explains their similarities in many beliefs and values <br>  <br>  <br>  However, over time the teachings of the various religions, due to a variety of reasons, have become distorted and mixed with made-man ideas. <br>  <br>  <br>  The last Prophet and Messenger of God, Muhammad , who is a direct descendant of Abraham through his first born son, Ishmael, was sent with the Last Guidance, Revelation and Testament, the Holy Qur'an(koran) to amend and correct the changes and corruption made to the the "Torah" which was sent to Moses and theTrue Gospel of Jesus.To say the truth ,God preserved all the other Holy Books plainly by preserving His Last Book the Holy Qur'an(koran)which contains the right and the truth of all that was changed in those other Books. <br>  <br>  <br>  This is why this last Revelation which was sent 1423 years ago has remained unchanged, not even a word or a letter has been altered. <br>  <br>  <br>  There is not even one word of difference between two Arabic Qur'ans, anywhere in the world. There has been no disagreements in history among Muslims as to what should and should not be in the Qur'an. However, in the case of the Bible, even the most ancient manuscripts conflict with one another so that no two are identical. Footnotes in all modern versions of the Bible prove this fact. <br>  <br>  <br>  These revisions serve as concrete proofs that all the Biblical books are not at all divinely inspired. This is because it is beyond man's ability to correct the work of his Creator, who alone is Almighty and perfect <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  It was only natural for Almighty God to preserve the scripture revealed to Prophet Muhammad, because he was the last Prophet and Final Messenger of God. <br>  <br>  <br>  Islam teaches us that we must pray directly to God without an intermediary and no soul can bear the burden of another and that the nature of humanity is good, and we did not inherit sin from Adam. Each soul comes into being free of sin.in Islam there are no priests or clergy -- each worshipper, man or woman, has a direct relationship with their Merciful Creator -- Almighty God. Since God is the Owner and Sustainer of everything, as well as the only one who can provide true and complete forgiveness, it is completely futile to try to approach Him through anyone else. <br>  <br>  <br>  The oneness and universality of God's message requires that people accept all the messengers of God. Rejecting one of them amounts to rejecting them all. The Jews reject Jesus's mission and Muhammad's mission; the Christians reject Muhammad's mission; whereas the Muslims accept them all, but reject incorrect historical interpretations and human elements in these missions. <br>  <br>  <br>  As the Qur'an is the final revelation and Muhammad is the final prophet, humanity is obligated to accept it: "If anyone desires a religion other than Islam, never will it be accepted of him; and in the Hereafter he will be in the ranks of those who have lost all spiritual good" (3:86). <br>  <br>  <br>  The Final Prophet Muhammad said: "Whoever believes there is no god but God, alone without partner, that Muhammad is His messenger, that Jesus is messenger of God, and that Paradise and Hell are true, shall be received by God into Heaven." <br>  <br>  <br>  you can do that now as you are reading these lines is to pronounce the two confirmations and attestations of faith, here it is <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I BEAR WITNESS THAT THERE IS NO GOD WORTHY OF WORSHIP EXCEPT ALLAH ( ARABIC WORD MEANS ONE GOD-THE CREATOR). AND I BEAR WITNESS THAT MUHAMMAD IS HIS SERVANT AND MESSENGER. I BEAR WITNESS THAT JESUS IS HIS SERVANT AND MESSENGER. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The right picture of lslam is conveyed in the Qur'an, which is exemplified by Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him. The reality is that it is not fair to judge a religion by the actions of its followers alone because there are good and bad followers in every religion. The correct thing to do is to judge a religion by its documented revelation from God and the prophet who brought that revelation. <br>  <br>  I encourage Christians and other religions to learn about Islam from Muslim sources and The Basis Of The Muslim Belief and not rely on second hand information which in many cases is distorted or contains a deep seated anti Muslim agenda.

God has given you this ability. It is called being a co-creator. Your mind can cause you to create good and bad in your life. I'm not sure how it works, but I do know it can be done.  Positive thinking is just as realizing as negative thinking. Example (negative programming). Try thinking about you spilling a glass of water. (car wrecks are going to far to prove a point)  Fill the glass with water leave about a 1/8 inch from the rim.  Say to yourself 3 or 4 times "I know I'm going to spill this water"  Now  carefully walk across the room with the glass of water. Did you make it without spilling it? If you did. Try 3 or 4 more times. (hint: the point of this exercise is to program yourself to do what you said you were going to do, that is to spill the water)  Now try positive thinking,  saying I'm not going to spill this water.  O yeah, clean up your mess.

They point to a verse in qurran, ...and We did not make the vision which We showed you but a trial for men... 17:60 and a hadith regarding Isra and Mi'raj in Sahih Bukhari, ...Allah's Apostle said, "O Moses! By Allah, I feel shy of returning too many times to my Lord." On that Gabriel said, "Descend in Allah's Name." The Prophet then woke while he was in the Sacred Mosque (at Mecca). 9:93:608. They argue that it was a mode of revelation for the Prophet in symbolic form for the guidance of the Muslim nation. This event also foretold Muslims that God would now raise Muslims up as a superpower and Jerusalem would soon fall into their hands.[1][2]<br>  <br>  its not a thousand times its 50 and when he went down not to gabrial but to the other prophets of gods message who told him that people wud be lazy and wont be able to perform all fifty prayers <br>  <br>  when he first met god(Allah) god told him that people should pray fifty times a day but when he went down (not to gabrial) but to the first prophet he told him he should ask god to reduce the prayers after he did he went the second prophet and so on<br>  until i think the ninth prophet (moses)|`|AA11638870	That was nicely asked.

We can only take the lessons we learned from the holy book and apply it to our lives...having faith and doing what is right with our families....God wants us all to look to him for courage, strength and faithfulness. We do not have the power to change things only God has the power. So we need to pray and live the best we can and this way it will be a good example for our children.

Any Godless state will sooner or later end up  either in anarchy or a police state. <br>       If there is no God then there are no absolutes. If there are no absolutes then there is no such thing as right and wrong. Right and wrong are just whatever the culture defines them to be in a Godless society. Our christian culture says you're supposed to love your neighbor. Some cultures down in the amazon say you're suppose to eat your neighbor. A government can define right and wrong just by man made law that is not based upon anything higher. But man has a natural bent toward evil. It's inherent in him. If you don't agree with that, your argument is not with me but with 6000 years of human history. Being bent toward evil he will always water down those laws because those laws are not based upon anything but the governments opinion. It's  as if God has established those laws and man always wants to be free to live in any licentious manner he pleases.. Eventually, you come to one of two end results: 1)the morality keeps getting watered down and watered down until you have anarchy in your nation because no one has any morals. 2)You need more and more force to enforce those man made opinions(laws) that are not based upon anything ultimate(God) and pretty soon you have a totalitarian government. So you always end up with one of two end results.....either you end up with anarchy or a police state.<br>  Francis Schaeffer, that great christian philosopher, used to say that liberals always bring on the thing they hate most......totalitarianism. What he meant was that they keep whittling down the morality in a nation until the only way you can keep order is with storm troops and a gestapo.<br>  Mao Zedong understood this perfectly well. He said " the only real morality is at the point of a bayonette. In his society that was true. He was a communist and his state was atheistic. An atheistic state doesn't allow for a God. As I said at the beginning....if there is no God there are no absolutes......if there are no absolutes there is no such thing as right and wrong ........if there is no such thing as right and wrong then sooner or later you will need bayonettes to keep the peace. <br>    Just read their moral code. One of the codes says " Humane relations and mutual respect between individuals: man is to man a friend, a comrade, and a brother".  Another said  "Irreconcilability towards injustice".  YEAH RIGHT. They slaughtered 70 million of their own people between 1917 and 1989.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.intouch.org/index_76034.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.intouch.org/index_76034.html</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pleaseconvinceme.com/home.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.pleaseconvinceme.com/home.php</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.livingwaters.com/listenwatch.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.livingwaters.com/listenwatch....</a>|`|22870b9fa74667f35d8c85caa8621251aa	yes at the same time they repressed everybody who was against communism, killed all priests and religious people ( as religion was prohgibited), shout out all nobel and intelligent families of previous tzar Russia ( some of them immigrated to Europe), created utopia of equality and socializm, put the border around the country preventing people to go abroad..<br>  <br>  I was born in Soviet Union and I was there during Perestroika time.

I do not mean to be arrogant about it. First of all, and explanation of what one means when they say they are a true Christian is necessary. A true Christian is one who imitates Christ. How can one do this? We obey Him, just as He obeyed His Father in heaven.<br>  A true Christian does not adhere to any false doctrines or man-made creeds. We follow only the teachings in the Bible.

8446b0bd7a0c5d7795039d6c92b20599aa	My mom passed away when I was 9. She and I missed alot of events in our lives. She was only 34. I had a dream that seemed to have lasted the entire night. I dreamt that she was sitting on the end of my bed. She was wearing a powder blue gown that seemingly flowed even though she didn't move much and that there was no breeze. Her hair was to her shoulders, brown and curled. She touched my leg to talk. I told her about things I had done and how proud I was to have done them despite her not being there. She said that she was there and knew everything that I had done. After what seemed a full night with her, she said she had to go. In the dream I started crying with tears running down my cheeks. We embraced. She had tears in her eyes, too. When I woke up, I really did have tears, but they were happy ones. I woke up refreshed and assured that she is always with me, and I with her, in spirit.|`|405b548b2dc7cdb2b4d509d8a29ad571aa	I was in a dimly lit room (her apartment from three's company) with crissy (suzanne sommers) and we were kissing, I hated it when I woke up.|`|WfJYH05aaa	I can't get into detail, but it involved Angelina Jolie, and Jennifer Anniston.

They have genetic engineering capabilities, they can already choose what genetics your baby will have, and cloning. That's just scary. <br>  <br>  It's nice to do that but just like the cell phone, at first it's always used to be for the benefit of mankind. But with government tapping your phone, using it as a way to harm people, then there is a very high chance that cloning can be used in the wrong way. Cloning body parts for humans for organ replacements is great but what about the people who abuse it. That's what I'm worried about. I'm sure there are people who would love to use this cloning technology for harm.|`|OgmG9f2zaa	I believe the great debate here is that we are leaving God out of the equasion, would they have a soul, would they have the same humanness that biologically born children have?

This judgment does not determine salvation, but rather is when believers must give an account of their lives to Christ. Believers are rewarded based on how faithfully they served Christ (1 Corinthians 9:4-27; 2 Timothy 2:5). The things we will likely be judged on is how well we obeyed the Great Commission (Matthew 28:18-20), how victorious we were over sin (Romans 6:1-4), how well we controlled our tongue (James 3:1-9), etc. We will have to give an account for our actions, Romans 14:12 declares, “So then, each of us will give an account of himself to God.” Unbelievers are judged at the Great White Throne Judgment (Revelation 20:11-15). This judgment does not determine salvation either. Everyone at the Great White Throne is an unbeliever and is therefore already doomed to the lake of fire.|`|2c6714a066b4bac19cc8bbb0e98a371baa	It's impossible to say for certain, as revelations, the book that speaks most about judgment day, is full of symbology and metaphors.<br>  Personally though, I believe judgment day occurs for us every time we make a decision... mini-armageddons... those choices define us and our spiritual direction.|`|AA10002921	That is a good question. We will be judged on an individual basis, yet as a nation as well. Perhaps how we voted as a nation will reflect on our own judgment. Did we agree with abandoning Israel? Did we vote to watch over her?<br>  However, first we must realize that judgment on whether someone goes into Gehenna or not is a black and white issue. Either you are in the Book of Life, or you are not. Now there is hints in the Bible that there are degrees of hell based on a number of factors. So this is a toughy in which I see no clear answers.

We will be judged by what our status or station in life was and what we did with what we had, which is also fair.  So if I live as a poor person in some "third world" country, or if I live the life of a person in America.  I will be judged by the assets I had as a person that got to live the life I lived and how I used those assets for good or evil.  I will also be judged based on what I accepted within my own country's general standards, and if I stood up for things my country represented herself as for good within the world.  And if I rejected the things my country stood for (in general) in the world if it was something bad.  But like others are saying, we will be mostly judged on our relationships with other people and God Himself.  For example, if we live in a "Christian" nation and I choose to fill all my freedom with pornography or some other moral abuse, it's like throwing the gift of freedom back in God's face.  When some people in other countries would die just to be able to sit in a country without a veil on and not fearing death.  In other words, we'll be judged fairly according to whatever freedoms and whatever limits we had imposed on us in this life.  Including those that happened by living in whatever country we lived in.  As far as when God judges America will you be punished, too?  No, not necessarily.  What I mean is, righteousness escapes the need for "punishment'.  God is always FAIR.  If you have done nothing wrong, you have nothing to fear.  If you've done some things wrong, you will be punished fairly.  But God isn't into senseless punishing that you don't deserve.  So you won't be punished because of what your government did.  But you'd be punished if you chose to do nothing if you knew about something unjust happening.  But only to a degree that's fair.   Even if a nation suffers a national disaster or even a war we should remember that death ISN'T a punishment.  It is a doorway to eternity, where our trials are over.  So sometimes innocent people die, but God is there with heaven waiting for them.   And we should never fear as long as we have tried within our means to live a decent, fair life.  Even if we've made mistakes as long as we've kept trying, we'll find that we have the most EVEN, FAIR, KIND JUDGE in all the Universe!  Don't worry!|`|zIprSgOFaa	he will be judging humans only!!!!!!

And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for mortar. 4 And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth. 5 And the Lord came down to see the city and the tower, which the children builded. 6 And the Lord said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do. 7 Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech. 8 So the Lord scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off to build the city. 9 Therefore is the name of it called Babel (confusion); because the Lord did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the Lord scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth|`|0919b1800f41ad8afc9bbac54502f413aa	just have a look to the book "the study o language " by "goerge yule ".it a very simple book and one of its chapter refers to this matter. good luck|`|9Br923jZaa	It is so complicated yet so intriguing.

Te adjunto un artículo que comenta, con base biblica que está haciendo Jesús ahora.<br>  <br>  ?Se ha preguntado usted alguna vez .?.?. ?<br>  ?Qué está haciendo Jesucristo ahora?<br>  <br>  JESUCRISTO fue un hombre sobresaliente. Millones de personas por toda la Tierra lo consideran uno de los más grandes maestros de la historia... aun muchas que no figuran entre sus seguidores. Pero hace mucho que él vivió y ense?ó, ?sí, hace casi 2.000 a?os!<br>  <br>  En la época de la Navidad, muchas personas piensan en él como un infante acurrucado en un pesebre. Por ejemplo, a una ni?a se le llevó a ver la escena de la Natividad. Al mirar en el pesebre, ella quedó confundida y preguntó a su madre, “?Llegó a crecer Jesús?” Se le respondió: “?Por supuesto, querida! ?Por qué preguntas?” La ni?a contestó: “?Bueno, él no ha crecido nada desde que lo vi el a?o pasado!”<br>  <br>  Quizás su curiosidad juvenil nos haga sonreír, pero su pregunta pone de manifiesto cierto hecho. él no fue siempre “el ni?o Jesús.” Sin duda usted reconoce que Jesús creció y llegó a ser un gran maestro. ?Pero sabía usted que durante la vida de él miles de personas quedaron convencidas de que él llegaría a ser un gran rey? Hasta se le llama “Rey de reyes.”<br>  <br>  JESúS COMO REY... ?PERO CUáNDO?<br>  <br>  Muchas personas que vivieron en los días de Jesús creían que él ejercería su poder como rey sobre el mundo en aquel tiempo. Pero estaban equivocadas. En una de sus parábolas, Jesús mostró que habría de esperarse largo tiempo antes que él llegara a ser rey del mundo. Aludiendo a sí mismo, él habló acerca de ‘cierto hombre de noble nacimiento que viajó a una tierra lejana para conseguir para sí poder real y volver.’ En los tiempos bíblicos dicho viaje “a una tierra lejana” requeriría bastante tiempo.—Luc. 19:11-14.<br>  <br>  Así que, después de su muerte y resurrección, Jesús ascendió al cielo y se sentó al lado de su Padre para esperar hasta que se le diera “gobernación y dignidad y reino, para que los pueblos, grupos nacionales y lenguajes todos le sirvieran aun a él.”—Dan. 7:13, 14.<br>  <br>  A fin de guiar a las personas que anhelan ‘servir’ a este Rey de reyes, Jesús proveyó una se?al detallada que serviría para determinar el comienzo de su gobernación. él predijo que habría guerra en escala internacional, escaseces de alimento, terremotos, enfermedades en escala epidémica y desafuero o violencia, para mencionar solo unas cuantas cosas. No es que su régimen acarrearía tales condiciones, sino que éstas serían comunes al tiempo que comenzara su gobernación. Las condiciones llegarían a causar tanto trastorno, dijo Jesús, que los hombres ‘desmayarían por el temor y la expectativa de las cosas que vienen sobre la tierra habitada.’ (Luc. 21:26) ?Por qué no lee los detalles en los capítulos 24 de Mateo, 13 de Marcos y 21 de Lucas?<br>  <br>  Al comparar las condiciones que han existido en la Tierra desde la I Guerra Mundial (1914-1918) con la profecía de Jesús, se ve que él describió las condiciones que existen hoy. Por eso, Jesús debe estar gobernando ahora en el cielo.<br>  <br>  SI ESTá GOBERNANDO AHORA, ?QUé ESTá HACIENDO?<br>  <br>  él está hallando a las personas que realmente desean ser súbditos de él y las está congregando para formar una hermandad unida y mundial. Jesús se?aló esto en una parábola que describe el comienzo de su gobernación, cuando ‘se sienta sobre su glorioso trono.’ él dirige su atención a “todas las naciones” y comienza a ‘separar a la gente unos de otros, así como el pastor separa las ovejas de las cabras.’—Mat. 25:31-33.<br>  <br>  Se les da a las personas la oportunidad de demostrar su verdadera actitud para con la realeza de Jesús. Después que se haya juntado a todas las personas con disposición de oveja, Jesús destruirá a las “cabras” e invitará a las “ovejas” a que “hereden” la región terrestre de su reino. El Salmo 72 describe cómo el Rey bendecirá ricamente a sus súbditos. él ‘librará de la opresión y de la violencia al pobre que clama por auxilio.’ Además, habrá “abundancia de grano en la tierra.”—Sal. 72:1, 12-14, 16.<br>  <br>  Desaparecerá una sociedad compuesta de personas inicuas, opresivas y violentas. También se eliminarán las escaseces de alimento, las enfermedades, sí, hasta la muerte. Es con la mira de que disfruten de estas bendiciones que Jesús esta juntando a sus “ovejas” ahora.—Rev. 21:3, 4.<br>  <br>  ?QUIéNES SON SUS SúBDITOS HOY DíA?<br>  <br>  No toda persona quiere ser súbdito. El obedecer a Jesús como Rey exige que se hagan ciertos cambios en la vida, que muchas personas no están dispuestas a hacer. Estas personas prefieren pensar en Jesús como un infante inocente, y no como Rey poderoso.<br>  <br>  Por ejemplo, después que los testigos de Jehová visitaron a una inglesa varias veces, ella se interesó muchísimo en leer la Biblia. En poco tiempo quedó convencida de que la ‘se?al de los tiempos’ anunciaba que Jesús estaba reinando. Como miembro activa de su iglesia, ella hablaba a menudo al pastor acerca de las cosas que ella estaba aprendiendo. A él le gustaban estas conversaciones, y en el transcurso del tiempo le pareció que era apropiado informar a su congregación sobre la realeza de Cristo y las bendiciones venideras mediante el Reino.<br>  <br>  En el sermón que pronunció el Día de Navidad, él habló con toda seriedad sobre la necesidad de mirar más allá de la infancia de Jesús, de aceptarlo como Rey y de estudiar la Biblia a fin de identificar la ‘se?al de los tiempos.’ ?Ay, esto no agradó a la congregación en lo más mínimo! Se reunieron los miembros y, mediante un portavoz, dijeron al clérigo: “Aunque apreciamos su sinceridad en todo lo que nos dijo, eso no es lo que vinimos a oír.” Entonces se le advirtió: “Si usted insiste en hablarnos así, iremos a otra parte.” El ministro accedió por temor de perder su puesto. Pero ?quiénes realmente salieron perdiendo? Los de la congregación, que se sentían satisfechos con volver a vivir cada a?o el “cuento de la Navidad.” La realeza de Jesús no les importaba en absoluto. Además, el ministro mismo estuvo dispuesto a dejar de hablar acerca de la realeza de Jesús. ?De cuánta importancia es esa realeza para usted?<br>  <br>  Esta experiencia dirige la atención a un grupo que no solo quiere que Jesús sea Rey, sino que también está recomendando su reino a otras personas en más de 200 países, tal como Jesús predijo. (Mat. 24:14) Son bien conocidos por su unidad y lealtad a este Rey celestial. Esperan con anhelo las bendiciones que la gobernación de Jesús pronto traerá a esta Tierra. Estos cristianos gustosamente compartirán con usted aún más conocimiento respecto a esta esperanza y lo que Jesús está haciendo ahora como Rey celestial.|`|25a398e879f60d11ef7865f2a69aa172aa	Trabaja de programador en Microsoft.|`|3bd3487240241f190eafb74ff00564e9aa	Se supone que subió a los cielos y está sentado a la diestra del se?or (ascendit caelos sedetque dextera Dei)|`|645e1a48ae0bbf3e4dea9ca135cdd90daa	Buena pregunta    ?             ?|`|84deb7b88520cdcad48b4b54add8051baa	SOLO SE SABE QUE SUBIO A LOS CIELOS, Y ESTA A LA DIESTRA DE DIOS PADRE, POR LO DE MAS NOS DAREMOS CUENTA CUANDO ESTEMOS CON éL.<br>  <br>  BENDICIONES!|`|8aef0bec53830a5674e2310d86576effaa	es posible que este a tu lado cuidandote en este momento|`|Cym89gccaa	hola<br>  pues cristo esta en estos momentos a tu lado por que dios es omnipotente,  dios todo lo puede pues el esta en todos los lados y siempre esta a tu lado<br>  cristo te ama amalo tu a el<br>  pues dios es amor el te ama y te invita a que tu lo ames no tengas miedo pues con dios todo se puede intenta lo pues yo lo intente y no me arrepiento dios me ha bendecido grande mente .<br>  dios te ama<br>  tu amiga de P.R|`|UTzERFbyaa	?Donde dos o más están reunidos en mi nombre allí estoy en medio de ellos?

Le mot christianisme est né bien après la mort de Jésus -psl- et de la Vierge Marie... ils étaient tout simplement soumis au créateur (donc musulmans).

Er war von Geburt an ein sehr zuverl?ssiger Mensch und alle ,die ihn so kannten vertrauten ihm ohne ende... Und irgendwann wurde er von Gott gerufen . Mohammed hat eine Zeit lang auf einem Berg meditiert und als er wieder runter kam, war sein Kopf voll mit dem Inhalt des Korans uns er hat das alles aufgeschrieben , aber das Interessante war, dass er v?llig ungebildet war, was das schreiben und das Lesen anbetraff...<br>  <br>  Andere Araber hatten verschiedenste Religionen der Welt, die es heute fast gar nicht mehr gibt...<br>  <br>  Wei?t du ,wenn ich weiter schreiben würde ,würde der Platz nicht reichen ...<br>   Geh auf die Seite: <br>  <br>  Die wahre Religion .de<br>  und h?r dir was von Pierre Vogel an|`|Bi4OCxHKaa	In Mekka, wo Mohammed geboren wurde und aufwuchs, herrschte der (ur-semitische) Vielg?tterglaube der arabischen Wüstenv?lker, verbunden mit ?ngsten vor Wüstengeistern. Die Ka'aba gab es schon, aber sie war garniert mit Statuen, die Mohammed als G?tzenbilder verstand und zu Beginn seines ?ffentlichen Wirkens zusammen mit seinen Anh?ngern zerst?rte.<br>  Mohammed selbst aber hat offensichtlich nie etwas von diesen "G?tzen" und Wüstengeistern gehalten, vielleicht schon seit seiner Kindheit. Darum hei?t es manchmal, er sei ohne Religion und deshalb auf der Suche gewesen.<br>  Als er als Kaufmann an den R?ndern der arabischen Wüste umherreist, ist er jüdischen Gemeinden und zumindest Randgruppen von Christen begegnet, entweder solchen "Judenchristen" (Ebioniten), die Jesus als Prophet, aber nicht Gottes Sohn verstanden (mit denen er übereinstimmte) oder Sondergruppen, deren Verst?ndnis der Dreieinigkeit Gottes sehr nach einem Drei-G?tter-Glauben aussah (und die er dann bek?mpfte).<br>  Sein entscheidendes Berufungserlebnis besteht darin, dass ihm der "gro?e Engel Dschivreel" (Erzengel Gabriel) erschien und ihm eine auf ein Tuch geschriebene Sure in den Mund drückte. Mohammed war anfangs durchaus im Zweifel, ob diese Erfahrung echt von Gott kommt; seine Frau Chadidschah hat ihn dabei aber best?rkt, und alsbald nach weiteren ?hnlichen Erlebnissen hat er diese Offenbarungen  niederschreiben lassen (d.h.  diktiert, er selbst war des Lesens und Schreibens unkundig, das haben damals Diener für einen Kaufmann erledigt). Nach seinem Tode sind diese Offenbarungen (Suren) gesammelt und in eine Reihenfolge gebracht worden (= der Qur'an).<br>  Man beachte die Parallele: im Christentum verkündet der Engel Gabriel die Geburt des Messias Jesus (an Maria), im Islam bringt derselbe Engel den Qur'an (w?rtlich: Lektion, das zu Lesende, zu Rezitierende) Mohammed. Die Position des Qur'an im Islam entspricht nicht der der Bibel im Christentum, sondern der von Jesus Christus.<br>  Als Mohammed aus Mekka wegen seiner Feinde nach Yathrib (sp?ter: Medinat-al-nabi = Stadt des Propheten) flüchtete, versuchte er zuerst, in den dortigen sechs jüdischen Gemeinden als Prophet (nabi) anerkannt zu werden. Das musste misslingen, weil das Judentum l?ngst die Reihe der Propheten als abgeschlossen betrachtete.<br>  Seinen Anh?ngern in Mekka empfahl er, wenn der Druck der (heidnisch-naturreligi?sen) Feinde zu unertr?glich würde, sollten sie übers Meer in das Hochland flüchten, wo Menschen des Glaubens an den Einen Gott lebten. Gemeint waren offensichtlich die ?thiopischen Christen (die viel Jüdisches aus ihrer Vorgeschichte beibehalten haben).<br>  Der Qur'an ist in einem damals ganz neuartigen Arabisch niedergeschrieben, welches seitdem aber die ganze arabische Sprache beeinflusst und erneuert hat. Eine sch?ne Charakterisierung spricht von den "feurigen B?ssen des Qur'an".|`|OFskw3jwaa	Die beste, weil treffendste und sachlichste, Antwort ist meiner Meinung nach die von erhard...<br>  Was die erste Offenbarung an Muhammad betrifft, m?chte ich allerdings Folgendes anmerken: <br>  Der Engel Gabriel hat den in einer H?hle bei Mekka meditierenden Muhammad aufgefordert zu lesen. Als Muhammad darauf hinwies, er k?nne doch gar nicht lesen, las Gabriel ihm einige Verse vor und Muhammad wiederholte sie und lernte sie auswendig.<br>  Da also Muhammad weder lesen noch schreiben konnte, hat er sich auch nichts "angelesen". Alles, was an wissenschaftlichen Fakten, die teilweise erst in der heutigen Zeit erkl?rbar geworden sind, an historischen Fakten aus der Vergangenheit, Vorhersagen für die Zukunft und Rechtsbestimmungen für alle Lebensbereiche im Koran steht, ist dem Muhammad von Allah geoffenbart worden. Das Wissen, das der Koran enth?lt, kann ein "normaler" Mensch - und damit meine ich jemanden, der kein Prophet ist -, in seinem Menschenleben überhaupt nicht zusammentragen und in dieser Stichhaltigkeit und Genauigkeit und Perfektion in einem derart brillanten Sprachstil (was das Arabische betrifft) darstellen. <br>  übrigens hat sich Muhammad nach seiner Auswanderung von Mekka nach Medina auch nicht bei den in Medina lebenden Juden versteckt; vielmehr ist er von dort lebenden Muslimen aufgenommen worden und verfasste in Zusammenarbeit mit den Juden die erste islamische Verfassung, die allen Bewohnern Medinas, also Muslimen und Nicht-Muslimen, die gleichen Rechte einr?umte.<br>  Die von Muhammad empfangenen Offenbarungen wurden schon zu seinen Lebzeiten von Gef?hrten schriftlich fixiert. Bis heute ist der Koran inhaltlich vollst?ndig so erhalten, wie er von Muhammad verkündet wurde.|`|meKrqoglaa	Ich vermute einer Naturreligion!<br>  Er wurde aber auch sicherlich vom Christentum und vom Judentum stark beeinflu?t!|`|19b5db778d830028e590917eb9c6ecd3aa	Zu dem Zeitpunkt waren im orientalischen Raum die Naturreligionen verbreitet, also denke ich mal, dass auch Mohammed diesen angeh?rte.<br>  Darüber hinaus (um es aus Sicht des Islams zu sagen): der Koran ist "das Wort Allahs". Allah hat durch einen Engel Mohammed den Koran übermittelt (wenn ich mich jetzt nicht t?usche).<br>  Ich glaube auch, dass er ihn nicht selbst aufgeschrieben hat, ich meine, es sind seine Begleiter gewesen, die alles, was Mohammed gesagt hat, aufgeschrieben haben.<br>  Ich muss dir übrigens zustimmen, auch mir gef?llt der Stil des Korans (und auch ich bin noch nicht weit gekommen). <br>  Wahrscheinlich trete ich jetzt hier eine Lawine los, würde diesen Kommentar eigentlich auch eher in einem Forum loswerden, in dem mehr Gleichgesinnte sind, doch dir scheint der Koran ja auch zu gefallen also meine Meinung über den Koran für dich (und ich verbitte mir irgendwelche abwertigen Kommentare von irgendwem, das ist jetzt tats?chlich nur für den Fragesteller gedacht!!!):<br>  Ich habe versucht, ganz ohne irgendwelche Vorurteile an den Koran "dranzugehen", und ganz ehrlich: mir gef?llt sowohl Stil als auch der Inhalt bisher sehr gut, ganz anders, als einem diese Religion durch Medien oder sonst irgendwie durch andere Quellen "nahegebracht" wird. <br>  Ich kann dir übrigens den Film Mohammed mit Anthony Quinn empfehlen, dort wird sehr sch?n das Leben und Wirken von Mohammed gezeigt - ist nur manchmal auch ein wenig blutig.|`|EsSdBpcXaa	1. Die Mosleme glauben, er hatte keine Religion. Was sicher nicht stimmt. Nach seiner Flucht vor seinen Widersachern, hat er sich bei den Juden in Medina versteckt. Haetten die Juden jemanden aufgenommen und versteckt, der nicht ihrer Religion ist. Sicher nicht. <br>  2. Der Koran beruft sich zu nahezu hundert Prozent auf das Alte Testament. Mohammed konnte weder schreiben noch lesen. Woher hatte er also all dieses Wissen.<br>  3. Der Koran wurde nicht von Mohammed, sondern erst nach seinem Tod von seinen Anhaengern geschrieben (siehe Punkt zwei).<br>  4. Weder die Juden noch sein Ziehvater sind zur Religion Mohammeds gewechselt.

Jedoch wusste ich vor ein paar Tagen selbst noch nicht die Antwort auf diese Frage, aber zum Glück gibt es Bücher wo alles drin steht und die man aus der Bibliothek ausleihen kann ;) Also, so viel ich erfahren und gelesen habe, hatte Mohammed bevor er Prophet wurde gar keine Religion. <br>  Vor seiner Geburt starb sein Vater, mit 6 Jahren seine Mutter und er kam unter den Schutz seines Onkels. Zwischen 610 und 619 wird Mohammed zum Prophet, spricht zu Gott und schreibt das, was Gott ihm sagt auf- so entsteht der Koran. Mohammed ist ein fürsorglicher Vater, guter Ehemann, vorbildlicher Führer,.. Er lehrt seine Anh?nger, und hat Mitleid mit denen die gegen ihn waren/gek?mpft haben und lehrt sie. ER ist der wahre und letzte Prophet - viele meinen, dass die Christen wussten das Mohammed der wahre Prophet ist und deswegen die S?tze in der Bibel wo in etwa stand " Mohammed ist der wahre Prophet" ge?ndert haben- daher gibt es auch so viele Neufassungen und Ver?nderungen der Bibel. Ich wei? nicht ob diese Aussage stimmt, aber viele meinen es ist so.<br>  <br>  Die anderen Menschen im orientalischen und arabischen Raum waren vorher entweder Juden, beteten die Kuh/Feuer/...an, oder (sehr wenige) waren Christen. <br>  <br>  Hoffentlich konnte ich dir weiterhelfen und habe dir zwischendurch auch noch etwas über seine Biographie erz?hlt ;)<br>  mfg<br>  merve
S51x5vK3aa	Das würde eine lange Liste ergeben... Viele Lernende kommen mit den 4 Kasus schon nicht mehr zurecht -- auch verst?ndlich. Es gibt keine richtigen Regelm??igkeiten in der Deklination.

Bi4OCxHKaa	Deine Aussagen kann ich alle best?tigen, ebenso deine Erg?nzung, dass es im Buddhismus um eine Erl?sung aus dem ewigen Rad der Wiedergeburten geht.<br>  Der Buddhismus ist, ganz kurz gesagt, eine Religionsphilosophie, die in der Befreiung aus den Zwangsvorstellungen der Hindu-Religion ihren Ursprung hat. "Dewas" (was indogermanisch dem Wort für Gott griech. theós, lat. deus entspricht) sind niedere Geistwesen, mit denen der Mensch nichts am Hut hat. Darum wird nach der Geburtslegende Siddharta Gautama, der sp?ter Buddha genannt wurde (= der Erleuchtete), nicht von einem Gott gezeugt wie die griechischen Halbg?tter, von einem wei?en Elefanten (der ist seltener als die dewas ...)<br>  Diese Religionsphilosophie, die man als den Ur-Buddhismus lernen kann, hat sich in ihrer langen Geschichte mit vielerlei Natur- und Volks-Religiosit?t verbunden (Mahayana-Buddhismus, tibetanischer Lamaismus). Bei uns ist er durch Schopenhauer und (organsiert) durch Paul Dahlke verbreitet worden und gilt (Gott sei Dank) vielen nicht an den Gott Abrahams (der Juden, Christen und Mslime) glaubenden Menschen als echter Religions-Ersatz, den sie im allgemeinen sehr individuell (und damit westlich-europ?isch) interpretieren und leben.<br>  <br>  Der Unterschied zum Christentum besteht nicht prim?r im Glauben an Gott (was ja auch im Christentum sehr interpretationsbedürftig ist), sondern charakteristisch ist, das der Buddha "der Erleuchtete" ist, Jesus Christus dagegen selbst das "Licht der Welt" (Joh 8,12). Jesus ist gekommen als "Licht, das die V?lker erleuchtet und zum Preise deines Volkes Israel" (Luk 2,32).<br>  Die Gebote vom Sinai zielen prim?r auf das Leben der Gemeinschaft (Handle zum Guten des anderen), die fünf Gebote des Buddhismus auf das Leben (genauer: die Selbsterziehung) des Einzelnen (Lebe so, dass du dem Kreislauf der Wiedergeburten entgehst). Der (ursprüngliche) Buddhismus hat kein Interesse an der Gestaltung des Soziallebens oder der Gerechtigkeit für die Erniedrigten, hat solche Impulse aber an vielen Orten in Asien aus de, Christentum aufgenommen (bis hin zu Kinderkliniken in Thailand mit der Figur des Buddha als Kind analog zum Jesuskind).<br>  Der Buddhismus ist als die vornehmste "Konkurrenz" zum Christentum zu achten und zu würdigen. Beide Religionen haben sich schon gegenseitig gute Impulse vermittelt und sollten es auch künftig tun. Dabei sollten beide von der authentischen Gestalt ihrer Frühzeit ausgehen.<br>  übrigens ist der Buddha unter dem Namen Josaphat in den Heiligenkalender der orthodoxen Kirchen "eingewandert".|`|6a8e5d28669a1b7822d0b193041f3567aa	buddhismus ist eine nontheistische religion. es ist aber eine religion. die bezeichnung als philosophie ehrt diese religion zus?tzlich.<br>  <br>  buddhismus ist neben christentum die einzige religion, die den menschen in den mittelpunkt stellt.|`|d7d2d5afc2774e4cd6bf8bbfa3194646aa	Hallo Chihiro.<br>  <br>  Da es im Buddhismus weder einen noch mehrere G?tter gibt, passt er absolut nicht in dass Monotheismus/Polytheismus-Schema. Verglichen mit dem Christentum, Judentum, Islam und Hinduismus ist er eigentlich auch keine klassiche Religion, sondern eher eine Lebenseinstellung/Philosophie.<br>  <br>  lg, Katja<br>  <br>  Wieso wird das Wort S-C-H-E-M-A nicht angezeigt? Ist das was anrüchiges?|`|zgNfdhnEaa	Für den Buddhismus ist die letzte, absolute Wirklichkeit nicht mit einem Begriff zu erfassen. weil sie über alle menschliche Erfahrung, Wahrnehmung und Sprache hinausgeht. Das Wort "Gott" kann nicht hinreichend sagen, was das All-Eine, Absolute usw. ist. Insofern gibt es auch keinen Vielg?tterglauben.|`|S51x5vK3aa	Ich wüsste keine Religion, die mehr G?tter hat als der Buddhismus. Allerdings, es sind keine Sch?pfungsg?tter, also G?tter, die die Welt erschaffen und die Natur steuern. Es sind meist Buddhas (Buddha ist kein Name aber ein Titel) oder Bodhisattvas (Wesen, das die Erleuchtung gefunden hat, aber zum Wohle aller anderen Daseinsformen auf die Erl?sung verzichtet), die durch ihre gottes?hnlichen Eigenschaften als "Gro?e Wesen" (sanskr. maha saatva) verehrt werden. Es geh?rt zur t?glichen Zeremonie, denen Opfer zu bereiten und zu ihnen zu sprechen.|`|a74d346e0d644049ba25546fc8d77c68aa	Ich denke das der Buddhismus mehr oder weniger eine Philosophie ist. Den es gibt im Buddhismus keinen Richter oder Erl?ser.|`|c38976723ee9b37f5c90f3768d12be59aa	nein.<br>  im buddismus gibt es weder einen gott noch mehrere goetter.|`|5daaec663ba4660308cb663cf60f762faa	Nein, da pa?t er meiner Meinung nach nicht rein.<br>  Ehrlich gesagt ist Buddhismus für mich eher eine Philosophie als eine Religion.

If you tax churches, then the Church can manipulate politics by threatening to move itself to another district, state, what have you if they don't get what they want. <br>  <br>  Sure, a church rents out apartments. Then the town it's in decides to legalize gambling. The Catholic League calls up the town of Nowheresville and says, "I understand you are trying to legalize gambling. That troubles us so much, we are thinking of turning the residences we rent out into free clergy housing rather thanrevenue building housing because of it." The town needs that income, so they back off. <br>  <br>  Or want to get more sinsister, ho abou this threat, "We are leaving, and evicting the people and tearing down our buildings. Explain to the voters the homeless problem and lack of emergancy cell phone coverage."<br>  <br>  Then you get the chances of a religious person being elevted and using these taxes to manipulate other religions. They see Catholic church's own more income property, and protestant church's own more steeple cell phone equipment; so they pass a law taxing church property income. Heavily. Catholics are affected, protestants aren't.|`|AA10004735	On a level I agree with you, but even as an Atheist, I see the great value of some of these groups in the community.  So I don't think a small church should bear the cost of tax when their value is given back to the community.  However, these smarmy televangelists really abuse the system.   If they can afford TV air time, then they can afford to pay taxes.<br>  <br>  This means you: Jim Bakker, Jimmy Swaggart, Pat Robertson, Jerry Falwell, Joel Osteen, Billy Graham, Gene Scott, Robert Tilton, Don Stewart .  All of these guys (some desceased) are smarmy and untrustworthy.  (And Don Stewart is just scary looking)|`|cf8LO93Yaa	why?|`|e0hKtVXMaa	sure, the church is a business too|`|35388c245298f734c446f07410c4ec69aa	They should be taxed to exactly the same extent as any other organisation.|`|921bb20cbeff6759eaec9997f6c36ecdaa	Yes they should be taxed like they are in France.

Entonces trasladé tu situación a una persona sordomuda, que tal vez no pueda hablar, pero puede expresar su amor con abrazos, o caricias... Sin embargo, la mayoría de los mamíferos expresan "afecto" por las personas que los cuidan y alimentan. Esto lo hacen por supervivencia y de una manera natural, sin implicar deseo sexual o afán de matrimonio.... Así es que, a menos de que la oveja te diga "quiero hacer el amor contigo" o cuando le preguntes "Quieres ser mi esposa" te responda que si; lo que intentas es parecido a querer casarse con una persona que está en coma...

XRglIqoWaa	WHAT? NO LADIES OF CAMELOT???<br>  <br>  1). You have forgotten Gareth, Bedivere & Caradawg Vreichvras. Caradawg was Arthur's deputy ruler & Chief Elder at the court of Gelliweg in Cernyw (The Welsh Triads). Bedivere was the one who returned Excalibur to the lake & was with Arthur till the end.<br>  <br>  2). Lancelot is always wearing snow-white or silvery-white armour. You can read this in the prose version of "Lancelot du Lac". I believe Galahad is always wearing white, and he carries a white shield with a red cross. Gawain carries a shield with a five-star pentagram on it, signifying the Goddess. This comes from "Sir Gawain & the Green Knight".<br>  <br>  3). It is entirely up to you. Arthur must always be in the middle, and Lancelot, his right-hand man, is always next to him. Galahad, who is always aloof, should be standing off to one side.  <br>  <br>  4). I think you've asked this before. There was, and even today, there is NO standard "coat of arms". Each knight carried his own family heraldry & crest, passed down from father to son. If you were not the eldest son, you had a modified version of the family heraldry, but possibly in the same colours. <br>  Even the ladies had their own individual coat of arms. Guinier had a white shield with a red fesse (pre-Vulgate Lancelot du Lac). <br>  When they married, their family symbols & colours were combined with their husbands' to create a new coat of arms.<br>  <br>  As for Arthur, his family crest would have been a boar (Arthur is derived from "Artos", which means "boar"). <br>  He also carried a golden dragon into battle, passed down from his "Uther his father" (Geoffrey of Monmouth), and his shield Pridwen, which had an image of the Virgin on it.|`|6f4f7d14ae8b69e50ccaf068c55c7152aa	You may want to include Arthur and Guenevere in the middle with the knights on either side<br>  <br>  See the following for the coat of arms for the knights<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.historicalnames.com/digital-coat-of-arms.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.historicalnames.com/digital-c...</a>|`|izjq5VLdaa	www.questia.com|`|71c3f37814ca115454da60888d7cbf7eaa	Kyng Arthur  King Arthur<br>  Sir Galahallt Sir Galahad<br>  Sir Launcelot Deulake Sir Lancelot du Lac<br>  Sir Gauen Sir Gawain<br>  Sir Percyvale Sir Percivale<br>  Sir Lyonell Sir Lionell<br>  Sir Trystram Delyens Sir Tristram de Lyones<br>  Sir Garethe Sir Gareth<br>  Sir Bedwere Sir Bedivere<br>  Sir Blubrys Sir Bleoberis<br>  Sir Lacotemale Tayle La Cote Male Taile<br>  Sir Lucane Sir Lucan<br>  Sir Plomyde Sir Palomedes<br>  Sir Lamorak Sir Lamorak<br>  Sir Bors De Ganys Sir Bors de Ganis<br>  Sir Safer Sir Safer<br>  Sir Pelleus Sir Pelleas<br>  Sir Kay Sir Kay<br>  Sir Ectorde Marys Sir Ector de Maris<br>  Sir Dagonet Sir Dagonet<br>  Sir Degore Sir Degore<br>  Sir Brumear Sir Brunor le Noir<br>  Sir Lybyus Dysconyus Le Bel Desconneu<br>  Sir Alynore Sir Alymere<br>  Sir Mordrede Sir Mordred<br>  <br>  i think each knight has it own coat of arms and its your picture so however u want to show them<br>  <br>  <a href="http://metamedia.stanford.edu/imagebin/Knights%20at%20the%20Round%2" rel="nofollow">http://metamedia.stanford.edu/imagebin/K...</a>|`|8cLR79mgaa	I am getting a vision of a medeville Last Supper.

YSK2PbAEaa	It was the Prophet Mohammed himself who attempted to negate the positive image of the Jew that had been prevalent earlier. According to historian Bernard Lewis, the Prophet Mohammed's original plan had been to induce the Jews to adopt Islam; when Mohammed began his rule at Medina in AD 622 he counted few supporters, so he adopted several Jewish practices-including daily prayer facing toward Jerusalem and the fast of Yom Kippur-in the hope of wooing the Jews. But the Jewish community rejected the Prophet Mohammed's religion, preferring to adhere to its own beliefs, whereupon Mohammed subsequently substituted Mecca for Jerusalem, and dropped many of the Jewish practices.<br>  <br>  Jews faced the danger of incurring the wrath of a Muslim, in which case the Muslim could charge, however falsely, that the Jew had cursed Islam, an accusation against which the Jew could not defend himself.  Islamic religious law decreed that, although murder of one Muslim by another Muslim was punishable by death, a Muslim who murdered a non-Muslim was given not the death penalty, but only the obligation to pay "blood money" to the family of the slain infidel.  Even this punishment was unlikely, however, because the law held the testimony of a Jew or a Christian invalid against a Muslim, and the penalty could only be exacted under improbable conditions--when two Muslims were willing to testify against a brother Muslim for the sake of an infidel. <br>  <br>  <br>  .|`|gGmMw2vDaa	Perhaps you should take time to regather your thoughts and then post them again so that we can understand your point.|`|wlYcWaQ3aa	Your family is honorable and you have my deepest respect.

My call is for the house of Islam to sweep itself clean. Good leaders must pressure those who use their positions of power in promoting hate. Those who do rarely make headlines in the news. There is some progress but more is needed. When renegade clerics realize the whole of Islam stands against them, they will cease to see advantage in their blind rage.<br>  I also believe, based upon the many, many posts I have read here, that the average Muslim knows next to nothing of Christ. When people stop thinking of themselves as slave they enjoy the freedom to learn.|`|69750f25faea5e6021c54c23d0dcb774aa	Great post!

You're right, what's the point of asking a question like that (which was really a thinly veiled excuse to persecute)?  There is no point to it.  He just wants a group of people to hate.

People should be judged by their actions, there are plenty of well intentioned people who are going to hell because they didn't stand up for what was right.|`|jUEUOtxXaa	15,000 Muslims are fighting in the US army?

896cefc62ec2cd1fd45bd59a7b3128f8aa	La oracion es nuestra via de comunicacion personal con Dios.  Esta se debe hacer con corazon sincero, el se da cuenta si lo es o no, y en el nombre de aquel que dio su vida por nosotros, Jesucristo.  Solo el es mediador entre Dios y el hombre, nadie mas.  Los beneficios; pues ensancharias tu relacion con el.  El desahogarse con el y saber que el nos comprende y nos entiende es algo reconfortador.  No esperemos que Dios nos conteste y nos solucione todo al orarle una vez.  Tenemos que obrar de acuerdo con lo que oramos.  Por ejemplo si oras para que te ayude a encontrar  trabajo, de nada sirve esperar sentado en casa a que te llamen.  Si ponemos de nuestra parte el nos ayudara, no siempre sera lo que esperamos o de donde esperamos.  No podemos esperar todo a cambio de nada siempre..........|`|bb6a57daa211a59a0da2fa055ff622d3aa	yo te ense?o papacito|`|f1f2d9ce736e269bade70340ea548929aa	Puedes obtener muchos beneficios, pero no lo hagas para obtener algo, hazlo por amor a Dios y al projimo, y veras que todo tu alrededor tornara a bien, Aprovecha que puedes orar, que tu vida sea conducida por el bien con tus Oraciones!|`|fabcfb75718fffe4f4f7d8286d01be2baa	la oracion viene del corazon es la peticion de yo superior pide lo que sientas en tu corazon, la oracion es el arma más poderosa que nos dejo Jesus.|`|8lZJZlMDaa	tu oración debe ser de gratitud<br>  "gracias se?or porque yo........tengo la bendición tuya de obtener tal o cual cosa. amen." pero debe ser vehementemente y con Fé en que tu petición se presentará en tu realidad, con contundencia, sin dudar.<br>  la palabra dice: antes de que me pidas yo abre contestado. el que no se presente inmediatamente es por tu falta de Fé.|`|ig8zQz4paa	...apr3nderas ... a reza r........... el dia .......que tengas ......algun problem a........real .........................y pondras ...toda la voluntad .....en ello ............y cuando sientas que ....tu oracion .........no funciono ........y tu problema no ....se soluciono ..............y se jodio todo .........vendran ...nuevos problemas casi insolusionables ...............y volveras a repetir la accion ................hasta el punto de hacerse costumbre .....rezos y problemas ...............y seras alguien con un inmenso fervor ...........como yo ...........que ya soy ...........inmaculado ........... y no hay nada que me da?e ......y siempre haciendo el bien ...........no para otros ....sino para mi .........................@m3n...|`|tBWFuLYeaa	Es buena pork dios te esucha y te ayuda en tus problemas, créeme, puedes aprender a orar yendo mas seguido a la iglesia, chao|`|0740ca7d261d60093b622af140d20f07aa	No lo hagas como algo religioso, ni con frases armadas, solamente busca un lugar en privado y decíle a Dios a través de Jesucristo todo lo que sentís y pensás, y que esperás que El te responda de alguna manera.<br>  Luego lee la biblia, y seguramente te va a hablar a través de ella, o una situación, un sue?o, una conversación con alguien.<br>  <br>  El mayor beneficio, es una RELACIóN PERSONAL con Dios y no una RELIGION HUECA Y VACíA.|`|cba1a9b483be00ef27421d9131c764efaa	"La oracion no cambia a Dios, cambia al hombre" S?ren Kierkegaard.

Una mujer tiene tendencia a fijarse en mayor medida por lo que es sentimental, por una necesidad primitiva de protección y seguridad. Los hombres que nos sentimos atraídos por otros hombres, aunque también buscamos una sensación similar a las de las mujeres, somos muchísimo más físicos. Un jovencito con cara divina puede enloquecer más a un man que a una nena, pues ella puede que no se sienta lo suficientemente segura con él.<br>  Obviamnet es peligroso generalizar, pero de acuerdo con mi experiencia esto es lo más común...

Por ejemplo una mujer busca que su novio o marido tenga un trabajo para poder salir adelante economicamente, un gay (a mi parecer) no es tan asi porque ambos trabajan y no esats esperando a que te mantengan. Otra caracter′stica es que las mujeres piensan en hijos, y si quieren tenerlo pues por lo menos que sea con alguien bien parecido, aunque no es la regla general y un gay pues nada mas por tener a alguien guapo porque pues hijos no tendran, es mas el lado sexual de la relación y la mujer busca mas el lado sentimental de la relacion.<br>  <br>  Fisicamente creo que en gustos se rompen generos.

Après, suivant les besoins du clientèlisme electoral, on provoque des pics de haine raciale (contre les noirs, les Polonais, les Italiens, les Templiers.. ou tout commode "ennemi de l'interieur"), ou on bat publiquement sa coulpe et on fait repentance... enfin de la com quoi, avant de designer un nouvel ennemi a la vindicte populaire.........<br>  Je ne sais plus qui a dit (je soupconne Talleyrand): "gouverner, c'est faire en sorte que les gens ne s'occupent pas de leurs problèmes".

Muslims respect all prophets in general, but Jesus in particular, because he was one of the prophets who foretold the coming of Muhammad. Muslims, too, await the second coming of Jesus. They consider him one of the greatest of Allah's prophets to mankind. A Muslim does not refer to him simply as "Jesus," but normally adds the phrase "peace be upon him" as a sign of respect. <br>  No other religion in the world respects and dignifies Jesus as Islam does. The Qur'an confirms his virgin birth (a chapter of the Qur'an is entitled "Mary"), and Mary is considered to have been one of the purest women in all creation. The Qur'an describes Jesus' birth as follows: <br>  <br>  "Behold!' the Angel said, God has chosen you, and purified you, and chosen you above the women of all nations. Mary, God gives you good news of a word from Him, whose name shall be the Messiah, Jesus son of Mary, honored in this world and in the Hereafter, and one of those brought near to God. He shall speak to the people from his cradle and in maturity, and he shall be of the righteous. She said: "My Lord! How shall I have a son when no man has touched me?' <br>  He said: "Even so; God creates what He will. When He decrees a thing, <br>  He says to it, 'Be!' and it is." [3:42-47]<br>  <br>  Muslims believe that Jesus was born immaculately, and through the same power which had brought Eve to life and Adam into being without a father or a mother.<br>  <br>  "Truly, the likeness of Jesus with God is as the likeness of Adam. He created him of dust, and then said to him, 'Be!' and he was." [3:59]<br>  <br>  During his prophetic mission, Jesus performed many miracles. The Qur'an tells us that he said: <br>  <br>  "I have come to you with a sign from your Lord: I make for you out of clay, as it were, the figure of a bird, and breathe into it and it becomes a bird by God's leave. And I heal the blind, and the lepers, and I raise the dead by God's leave." [3:49]<br>  <br>  Muhammad and Jesus, as well as the other prophets, were sent to confirm the belief in one God. This is referred to in the Qur'an where Jesus is reported as saying that he came:<br>  <br>  "To attest the law which was before me, and to make lawful to you part of what was forbidden you; I have come to you with a sign from your Lord, so fear God and obey me." [3:50]<br>  <br>  Prophet Muhammad emphasized the importance of Jesus by saying: <br>  "Whoever believes there is no god but Allah, alone without partner, that Muhammad is His messenger, that Jesus is a servant and messenger of God, His word breathed into Mary and a spirit emanating from Him, and that Paradise and Hell are true, shall be received by God into Heaven.

AtcZb1MNaa	The pope technically holds the position of the head of state of the nation of Vatican City,  the smallest country in the world.  While the Holy See obviously sends someone else to attend gatherings such as the General Assembly to the United Nations and has other priests and cardinals handle the day to day affairs,  the pope does dictate the policy of  Vatican City.  Vatican City came about in the late 1920's when the Catholic Church was wary of the influence of the Italian government on church affairs-  and this was right before Mussolini came to power although prior to his formation of the Axis with Hitler he had good relations with the Pope.|`|2b932e39a523b81bffb8ffc799e928ceaa	To some I guess.

Un pais que aun en los anos de dependencia economica de la URSS ha hecho progresos en el cultivo de muchos de sus recursos minerales,productos alimenticios y  textiles que beneficiaban al bienestar del pais en general. <br>  En el presente la educacion esta lamentablemente empobrecida. Los que se reciben con titulos profesionales no tienen done usarlos a menos que sean explotados por el aparato retogrado del presidente de UZBEKISTAN. A causa de ello, muchos se han forzado ha emigrar. <br>  El nivel de Educacion es bajisimo en el presente. El gobierno pretende de que les paga bien a los docentes. Ellos, a su vez, pretenden que estan ensenando. La gran mayoria de los jovenes estudiantes estan desmoralizados.<br>  Las grandes companias se han esfumado luego de tres anos de coerciones y burocracia. El pequeno propietario para sobrevivir, debe pagar impuestos oficiales  y a su vez dadivas a agentes del gobierno que con el pretexto de inspecciones cobran dinero ilicito.<br>  En el campo, las cosechas del algodon son compradas por el monopolio estatal a precios irrisorios, que luego traen al gobierno ganancias increibles que casi no vuelven al pueblo.<br>  El estado de abandono afecta a todos los programas medicos, desde la infancia  a la vejez.<br>  Esto es aplicable a todas las areas de  de la industria y al servicio publico nacional.  El aparato policiaco mantiene orden en medio de la oscuridad intelectual y el aislamiento internacional.<br>  El presente gobierno se vende al mejor postor internacional. Se practica bien el juego de sillas mientras la poblacion esta siendo diezmada por la falta de lideres con vision en el futuro.<br>  La hija del presidente es duena de varios hoteles internacionales y supuestamente podria "heredar" el trono de su padre, quien seguiria manejando los intereses de su minoria. El empleador mas grande es el gobierno, el que mantiene una burocracia civil y militar sin antecedentes. Si no hay un despertar, muy pronto, la poblacion de UZBEKISTAN va ha ser una de las naciones mas atrasadas, las que terminaran generalmente por producir bienes a un precio bajisimo, y de esta manera beneficiar a la nueva clase intermidiaria.

Ambos son un fracaso en la mayoría de los países latinos...<br>  <br>  Sobre todo la escolaridad que es más fácil de contar (número de a?os en la escuela).<br>  <br>  Es uno de esos círculos viciosos donde la pobreza causa baja en las escuelas y la baja en las escuelas puede producir pobreza a la larga, aunque no necesariamente (todos sabemos que muchos norteamericanos tienen una escolaridad media o pocos conocimientos científicos y aun así viven muy bien a comparción con los pobres latinoamericanos).<br>  <br>  En cuanto a la educación (cambio de valores), esa se dá más en las familias y en los grupos sociales en estos países, por lo menos para mi, en la escuela jamás me educó nadie (nuestro sistema escolar laico propicia esa estelilidad).<br>  <br>  Y también ahí podemos tener problemas porque además de familias pobres tenemos violencia y drogas involucrados lo cual corrompe a las personas desde temprana edad... Lo cuál es otro círculko vicioso.<br>  <br>  Pero creo que el círculo sólo se puede romper desde arriba y no desde abajo, es decir que es responsabilidad de los que tenemos más, y del gobierno, dar nuevas oportunidades y un buen ambiente para el desarrollo de las familias pobres, que de esa manera se superarán a sí mismas naturalmente.<br>  <br>  Pero eso no les conviene a todos porque implica meterse DE VERDAD contra el narcotráfico y contra la corrupción institucional que mantiene a tantos...<br>  <br>  En fin.<br>  <br>  Saludos.

p1yUQ71Aaa	El nombre completo es WATCHTOWER BIBLE AND TRACT SOCIETY OF PENSILVANIA INC., que en espa?ol significaria algo asi como SOCIEDAD LA TORRE DEL VIGIA, BIBLIAS Y TRATADOS, es la empresa  que usan los testigos de Jehova para tener caracter legal, la empresa (y notese que estamos hablando en principio de la empresa y no del grupo religioso que la usa), fue fundada a fines del siglo XIX en Pensilvania para tener una agencia que se ocupara de la impresion y distribucion de literatura biblica a todos los rincones del mundo, el a?o fue 1884 y esto se hizo por una ley que se conocia como LA LEY PARA SOCIEDADES NO LUCRATIVAS DEL ESTADO DE PENSILVANIA, por eso por ley la watchtower no puede tener fines de lucro de modo que nadie lucra con esa sociedad, la carta constitucional de esa sociedad declara: ESTA SOCIEDAD NO CONTEMPLA GANANCIA NI BENEFICIO PECUNIARIO, INCIDENTALMETE NI DE OTRA MANERA, A SUS MIEMBROS, DIRECTORES NI OFICIALES. cabe destacar que la gente de poco razonamiento asocia a esta entidad legal con la religion de los testigos, sin embargo te puedo comentar que es algo totalmente separado ya que si bien es cierto que la mayoria del personal que alli trabaja pertenece a ese grupo religioso, no se identifica legalmente como parte de los activos de esa religion, la manera en como se sustenta economicamente esa entidad es por las donaciones voluntarias que hacen los mas de 6 millones y medio de testigos de Jehova por todo el mundo y tambien cuentan con las acciones de algunas empresas importantes que cotizan en la bolsa de valores, si deseas mas informacion y te es posible puedes marcar en mexico al 51 33 30 00 en horas de oficina o visitar la pagina oficial de watchtower en internet, tambien hay dos videos de los testigos de Jehova que te brindan un panorama muy amplio de este punto. uno es LOS TESTIGOS DE JEHOVA, LA ORGANIZACION TRAS EL NOMBRE y el otro es LA SOCIEDAD DEL NUVO MUNDO EN ACCION, cualquier testigo que toque a tu puerta te lo puede prestar. Tambien puedes visitar de manera gratuita la sucursal en tu pais, en el telefono que te di te pueden dar la direccion de Mexico o en la revista LA ATALAYA puedes ver la direccion de otros paises.|`|2df21d3a067b7d55cbfe72cd6e7c4c88aa	ES LA TORRE DEL VIGIA DE LOS TESTIGOS DE JEHOVA...

Despues de investigacion y de llegar a la conclusion de que lo que habiamos creido se nos derrumbo, nos precede un proceso de confusion, tension y depresion. <br>  Superado esto, nos duele ver como miembros de nuestra familia, y amigos, a los cuales queremos, estan tambien enganchados y queremos que dejen de estar sometidos a un enga?o.  Queremos que ellos tambien conozcan lo que hemos llegado a descubrir nosotros, pero es aqui donde a veces se cometen errores.<br>  Muchas veces la tendencia es ir a decirselo a un "amigo hermano" tj, y confiarle nuestras dudas, o nuestras convicciones. O si no comunicarlo de inmediato a nuestros familiares, padres, madres, esposa, esposo e hijos. Pero, antes de hacer esto tenemos que tener en cuenta como y cuando hacerlo.<br>  No es positivo atiborrar la mente de otros tj con una cantidad de informacion que ellos de momento no van a procesar, piense, ?por que y como llegue yo a darme cuenta del enga?o? Casi siempre esto se debe a una decepcion de la organizacion, o a una injusticia cometida, esto pudo dar pie para que usted hiciera una investigacion de por que estas cosas le estaban sucediendo. Pero preguntese, ?esta mi amigo o mi familia atravesando una decepcion de la organizacion? ?No confia ya como antes en su organizacion? O, por el contrario, ?sigue confiando y apoyando lealmente a la WT como el canal de Dios en la Tierra?<br>  Si esto es asi, entonces tiene que obrar con prudencia y paciencia. Existen estudios psicologicos, que presentan a un enganchado en una secta como a alguien que esta enganchado en la droga, y el cual tiene un proveedor de tal sustancia. A un adicto a la droga no se le puede desenganchar de golpe, es contraproducente hacerlo. De la misma manera a una persona enganchada en una secta, no se le puede desprogramar de golpe. <br>  No es positivo ejercer presion sobre ellos, nunca utilice la agresion verbal o las discusiones agresivas con miembros de su familia u otros tj. Recuerde que los tj como lo era usted tambien antes, estan educados o entrenados para creer que su religion es la mejor, y no van a creerle a usted de un dia para otro. <br>  Hay muchos miedos y fobias inculcados en el subconsciente de un tj.<br>  1- Miedo a perder el favor de Jehova<br>  2- Miedo a morir en el Armagedon<br>  3- Miedo a perder contacto con sus hermanos y familia (Dependencia emocional)<br>  4- Miedo a que le tilden de "apostata"<br>  5- Miedo a ser excluido del grupo, por una expulsion o ser ignorados por otros tj<br>  6- Miedo a estar pecando contra el espiritu santo<br>  7- Miedo a ser llamado a un comite judicial por los ancianos<br>  Teniendo esto presente, hay que entender la situacion, y darles tiempo. No todas las personas reaccionan de la misma manera aun ante la misma situacion.<br>  Si usted es un esposo y padre de familia, sera el mas interesado en que su esposa e hijos le apoyen. Pero eso toma tiempo, y esfuerzo paciente de su parte, por sobre todas las cosas demuestre amor, demuestre que usted es ahora mejor que antes, y que se siente mejor y mas libre de opresion que antes.<br>  Demuestre que su forma de actuar ahora es digna y honesta, y que detesta la hipocresia y la falsedad de dogmas humanos.<br>  Suministrele informacion verbal (tenga en cuenta que en la mayoria de los casos le temen a internet) ya que se les ha dicho que todo lo que provenga de ese medio en contra de la WT es "apostasia" y mentiras que utiliza Satanas el Diablo, para oprobiar a Jehova. <br>  Hagala ver con la misma literatura de la Sociedad, las multiples equivocaciones y las muchas veces que han prometido cosas que jamas se cumplieron. Muestrele el origen de su organizacion que muchos tj desconocen, y utilicen sus mismos libros para hacerlo. Ense?ele sobre Russell, Rutherford y pregunteles si ellos sinceramente creen que estas personas eran guiadas por el espiritu santo de Dios.<br>  Hagales preguntas, ?se equivoca el espiritu de Dios? ?Miente Dios, primero y luego cambia la mentira por una verdad?

85a767b335aa5827d84449e808b17f3aaa	ah! misterioso, no?<br>  <br>  te voy a dar la misma respuesta que le di a otra persona que preguntó algo parecido, (Y la tengo como MEJOR respuesta, así que ya podría tomarse en serio) :<br>  <br>  Si Dios es perfecto, y OMNIPRESENTE, que significa que "él está en todos lados y Todo lo existente está en él" ?Dónde está el Diablo, o el Infierno? ?El Diablo está DENTRO de Dios también?<br>  <br>  1.- Si el Diablo está dentro de Dios, se podría decir que "La Maldad" es un atributo divino, que es controlado por Dios o por lo menos que deja que afecte al mundo con algún propósito desconocido. Entonces el Diablo NO ES LO OPUESTO DE DIOS, sino una parte Completamente FUNCIONAL DE éL, o sea, una herramienta del TODO. (Lo cual sería como admitir que Dios y Diablo son lo mismo, o que por lo menos son colegas que viven en el mismo barrio)<br>  <br>  2.- Si el Diablo es NEGACIóN de Dios, y está fuera de él, ya sea como parodia de su existencia, eso quiere decir que Dios no es TODO, por tanto ni es ETERNO ni OMNIPRESENTE (Ya que la existencia de un ser FUERA de Dios, significa que EXISTE en un lugar y un tiempo donde no está Dios) por tanto: Dios no es PERFECTO ... -plantear a Satán como un "ERROR" cae en la misma problemática que si es un Expulsado del "Todo": Que ese TODO dejó de ser TODO cuando SACó o expulsó un objeto impuro. Tal vez ahora Dios sea más puro por no contener a Satán, pero definitivamente en éste caso YA NO SERíA UN TODO ETERNO Y OMNIPRESENTE...<br>  <br>  ?MI OPINIóN PERSONAL?

Pero, por el contrario, ensayan explicaciones complicadísimas para responder tu pregunta, porque quieren dar a entender que saben todo, y que en la Biblia están todas las respuestas.<br>     La Creación de Dios es perfecta, pero existe el Mal, entonces el Mal es externo a la Creación ?De dónde proviene? Lucifer era el tercero en la jerarquía celestial. ?Cómo un Angel que estaba tan alto llegó a conventirse en algo tan bajo? Además, siendo un ángel, tenía la sabiduría suficiente como para poder prever que lo que estaba haciendo iba a terminar mal; es decir, que no iba a poder vencer a Dios. <br>     Yo (sí, yo) soy menos poderoso y menos sabio que Lucifer, ya que no soy un ángel. Sin embargo, nunca voy a llegar a ser tan malo como él. <br>     De todas formas, el problema no es Dios. El problema son las religiones, que tratan de explicar algo que no pueden explicar.

Antes que nada tienes que ver si realmente crees en Dios y su hijo Jesús, de ahí podríamos partir y entender que Dios tanto a los ángeles como a nosotros nos dio el libre albedrío, que no es otra cosa que el escoger el camino que nos convenga o guste. El a todos los seres humanos, ángeles, etc,  nos da la opción de pensar individualmente. Solo nos pone los hechos y ya nosotros decidimos. La rebeldía de lucifer se origina en que en cierta forma Dios le da preferencia a los humanos sobre todas las cosas, de ahí el realizo la revuelta y fue expulsado junto con todos sus seguidores. Imagina que tanto nos ama Dios, que mando a su hijo Jesús a dar su vida por nosotros y así saldar cuentas y a la ves sentenciar a Lucifer, ya que su ley o palabra de Dios, fue cumplida. Por otra parte, si no crees en Dios, creo que siempre te inclinaras a juzgarlo y tratar de desprestigiarlo. Saludos.|`|ptRpoC0yaa	Hay cosas que no podemos explicar por nuestras limitaciones humanas.

3c673247879f638619499c547ce28f6aaa	Bonjour :)<br>  <br>  Oui cela nous est arrivés, je parle de mes parents et moi. J'ai un cousin, qui est maintenant assez agé, dans la fin vingtaine. A l'époque, il avait été abandonné par son père (donc le frère de ma mère), car il s'etait remarié et sa nouvelle femme ne voulait pas de mon cousin à la maison. Ma mère étant la marraine de ce cousin, on a tout fait pour l'aider. On lui donnait de l'argent, on l'hébergeait souvent. Par la suite, on a su que l'argent qu'on lui donnait lui servait à payer de la drogue, il nous avait totalement menti. Et on s'était aussi rendu qu'il manquait des objets à la maison, disparus!.. Des années après, il nous a avoué qu'il nous avaient volés.<br>  Un jour, il était revenu, pour de l'argent. On ne voulait plus le voir. Il a tout cassé dans la cour, surement était-il drogué (il n'était pas dans son état normal.)...<br>  Depuis, on ne lui fais plus confiance.<br>  Mais bon, j'ai encore aujourd'hui de la peine pour lui, je me dit que c'est pas vraiment de sa faute, c'est d? à son sentiment de rejet de la part de son père.... Voilà! :)<br>  <br>  Et toa, que t'ai-t-il arrivé? <br>  <br>  Bonne journée, gros bisouille! :-><|`|dd6bde3b68089f587e6c52e1b0de528faa	oui, l'attitude à adopter c'est de rester calme ds ton coin et surtout ne pas regreter le bien ke tu lui a fait. sa conscience le jugera|`|2db77d2626c0eb8dddb89847575e0c89aa	cela m'est arrivé ...et plusieurs fois...mais on a un proverbe en arabe qui dit "le chat n'aime que celui qui l'etrangle"...et honnetement c'est ce que j'observe dans la vie...les gens n'aiment pas ceux qui les traitent delicatement..mais ceux qui les provoquent!!!!|`|4abff8d5c103f42ea1f2898428a53cd6aa	j'ai déja entendu cela souvent d'africains!<br>  un son cousin l'a mit dans la m..de en lui faisant faire des dettes pour acheter une maison et ensuite le revendre avec interet, mais vu que le cousin n'a pas aidé le pauvre devait faire cela seul, en plus il habitait dedans pendant des mois! Et il a fait des dégats que l'autre a du remettre en ordre avant de le revendre! Parfois il vaut mieux ne pas avoir de famille que d'en avoir une comme cela!|`|7724c6a9510715f02e6088d6f727383eaa	et oui ,fisco cela arrive bien souvent j,ai ramener une amie de 20ans d,amitié chez dans ma famille l,année dernière pour visiter mon pays ,elle était accompagné  de son fils on l,as très bien accepter . . le problème   elle as voulue être ce qu,elle n,était pas  et cela a marcher,mes secrets ont étés divulgués, son fils  as voulu retourner le mien contre moi.je suis demander si elle n,as pas  profiter   de     moi  etde toutes ces années  pour aller  pour aller dans mon pays car elle rêvait et n,avais pas l,opportunités. pour conclure ,j'ai perdu mes amis et ma mère ne m,appele pas mais elle a garder le contact avec mes parents. je sais pas pourquoi elle as réagie de cette fa?on, la seule chose je sais elle était transformé  . j,ai couper le pont . et je ferais attention aux sois disant ami|`|db7fae9425cfb369ee721f6f2e51d0c6aa	oui, c'est malheureusement la vie!<br>  c'est comme ?a qu'on découvre ses vraies amis!<br>  Prends tes ditances, l'indifférence fais généralement plus mal que la violence!<br>  C'est elle qui perd au final, pas toi!|`|da66598eeb5e15b8e9b77ce893d24913aa	oui, pas quelqu'un de ma famille, mais une copine. Elle avait des problemes, des crises d'angoisse, pas d'argent, des troubles mentaux. Je l'ai aidee, conseillee, soignee. Puis un jour elle a commence a etre parano et a penser que je ne l'aimais plus, m'a laisse plein de messages sur le repondeur dont un a la fin me disant d'aller me faire enculer, et qu'elle etait mieux que moi a tous les niveaux....Conclusion: qd on aide quelqu'un il faut le faire sans rien attendre en retour. Donner pour le plaisir de donner. Aussi il est bon de savoir a qui donner car si on peut eviter de donner des perles a des cochons c'est encore mieux! LOL|`|e2aa665136e4bd118510bc9238e3e770aa	Oui. Pas dans la famille mais une amie. Je l'ai soutenue quand elle n'allait pas bien, soutenue dans une histoire difficile. Tout ce qu'elle a trouvé de mieux à faire c'est sortir avec un ex à moi (pour qui mes sentiments n'étaient pas très clairs à l'époque, maintenant c'est bon je vous rassure, un salaud reste un salaud) devant mon nez. (mec contre lequel je l'avais pourtant mise en garde). Ca s'est mal fini elle est revenue pleurer dans mes bras... après ?a j'ai coupé les ponts pendant 4 mois, le temps d'oublier un minimum, mais ?a reste là entre nous deux, elle le sait je le lui ais dit. Il restera toujours ?a entre nous...<br>  <br>  Mais bon c'est "moins grave" que pour ceux où ?a se passe dans la famille. Bien du courage à tous !|`|fa5e8ea34bcd95ce259aff52b41062feaa	Oui. j'ai soutenue mon ancien beau-père contre une partie de ma famille car il a toujours été très gentil avec mon frère et moi. Résultat: a la mort de ma mère, il n'a rien voulu nous rendre( même pas de photos de notre mère) et s'est remarié 6 mois après.<br>  Dans une lettre assassine, il a sous entendu que nous avions fait notre deuil et qu'il fallait qu'il fasse le sien.Sa fille aimait soi disant plus notre mère que nous.<br>  J'avais 15 ans et mon frère 12. On a été très choqués.|`|uzek1tJKaa	Quand j'habitais encore avec mes parents, nous avons hébergé le petit frère de mon patère. <br>  <br>  Il a commencé a raconter des ragots sur mon père jusqu'à même nous interdire, mes frères et soeurs, à nous rendre chez notre famille maternelle.<br>  <br>  Il tapais mon frère a?né parce que celui ci allait chez mes oncles maternelle devant ma mère qui devenais impuissante.<br>  Car dans notre culture et comme dans beaucoup d'autre, la famille maternelle est très importante surtout les oncles pour ce qui est de l'éducation.<br>  <br>  Il est même allé jusqu'à prendre la moitié de notre terrain pour agrandir sa maison.<br>  <br>  Il disait que notre famille devait rester unis et après ce qu'il nous a fait, avec mes frères et soeurs, nous ne voulons même plus retourné dans notre tribu paternel.<br>  <br>  Et le pire c'est qu'il n'a même pas le culot de demander pardon à son propre frère de tout ce qu'il a fait.<br>  <br>  Il nous l'a même dit haut et fort lors d'une soirée en famille que nous étions, ma petite famille y compris mon père son propre frère, des évités et non des invités. Nous venons à peine d'arrivé que nous voilà repartis.<br>  <br>  Mais heureusement pour lui que mon père l'aime et qu'il a du coeur car moi même je ne peux le pardonner car ?à fait depuis longtemps que pour moi il n'existe plus.<br>  <br>  Il a même demandé à mon père de venir à son mariage pour représenter la famille car ces autres frères ne voulaient pas assistés à cause de c'qu'il a fait à mon père. Et il a accepté car il est son petit frère.<br>  <br>  Cela fait maintenant presque 7 ans et toujours pas de pardon envers son propre sang.<br>  <br>  Je ne peux plus le pardonner pour ce qu'il a fait à mon père mais jamais je m'en prendrai à mes cousins car la famille c'est sacrée.
Otdh4dJxaa	Descripción<br>  El penacho es una obra de los amanteca, los artesanos mexicas especialistas en la creación de objetos con plumas. Tiene una altura de 116 cm y un diámetro de 175 cm. El centro del penacho esta hecho con plumas azules del ave Xiuh Totol, y tejuelos de oro en forma de medias lunas con piedras preciosas. Sigue una zona rosa de plumas de Tlauquechol y otra zona de plumas marrones de cuclillo, de donde sale una hilera de plumas verdes de quetzal, algunas de hasta 55 cm de largo. Sigue otra zona también de plumas de quetzal. En total tiene más de 400 plumas de quetzal. A pesar de que en la actualidad esta muy deteriorado, su valor estimado por el gobierno austriaco es de 50 millones de dólares.<br>  <br>  <br>  [editar]La reliquia y sus dudas<br>  El penacho de Moctezuma es considerado con mucho, la reliquia más importante de México, que se encuentra fuera del territorio nacional y fuera del dominio de los mexicanos, por ello el gobierno de México ha intentado recuperarlo de manera infructuosa.<br>  <br>  Por su parte el gobierno austriaco dice que intentar devolverlo es una empresa compleja, porque se trata de un bien con valor histórico y el Presidente del país no tiene facultades legales para devolverlo o entregarlo en donación, en cualquier caso, se necesita la autorización de diversos organismos de Austria y por lo mismo es aventurado en este momento intentarlo, pues en caso de fracasar, sería prácticamente imposible lograrlo después.<br>  <br>  Por otra parte y a pesar de la importancia de la reliquia, no existe ningún documento que acredite que dicha pieza haya sido utilizada por el tlahtoani Moctezuma II, quien gobernó el imperio azteca de 1502 a 1520, tampoco se tiene evidencia que ese penacho haya sido de emperador alguno, a continuación se cita lo manifestado por Alejandro González, historiador de la Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM) en el 2003:<br>  <br>  "No hay vestigios históricos que prueben que el penacho era de Moctezuma, sin duda era propiedad de un alto dignatario o sacerdote azteca, todos los miembros de la elite de entonces usaban uno, pero no hay forma de saber a quién perteneció"|`|CxYspMlbaa	es el equivalente al tocado egipcio, solo que con plumas y dependiendo de la jerarquía del que lo portaba eran las plumas, un jefe, talvez usabva plumas de zopilote, mientras un gobernante o un "emperador" usaba con plumas de quetzal|`|13323a050a96bc97771e3b57c2092cfdaa	Te puedo responder solo que es un penacho,un penacho es como un sombrero de plumas que usaban o usan los indigenas cuando bailan su danza.|`|JHUkmvoLaa	penacho<br>  m<br>   1.

Es un error frecuente, y de hecho de tanto afirmarlo casi se convierte en verdad, llamar penacho a los tocados que utilizaban tribus prehispanicas. En realidad la mayoria de las tribus usaban tocados, y por lo que corresponde al centro de México se les llamaba Copilli en idioma Nahuatl, que se puede traducir como "tocado de plumas". Actualmente, la palabra penacho es la que mas predomina, recuerda, el idioma del vencedor es el que perdura.

2RM98Kkkaa	Maybe you should rewrite your question a little better so they can understand you.<br>  <br>  Hey thumbs down!! I was trying to help.|`|AA11279122	I love women. I think that they are sexy and every bit as vibrant and exciting as males. I think that they truly are wonderful people...however, sexually they do nothing for me. No, I'm not shy because I am gay,,,but was when I was young...but I was shy about everthing then.|`|AA10283855	Most gay guys have a lot of female friends. I have been told by females that they prefer a gay guy as a friend because they don't feel like a sex object around them like they do around straight guys. No, I am not shy at all around women. I have females that are very close friends.|`|5gJKBYJiaa	Women can be good friends but you wouldn't want one for a boyfriend. Its probably easier sometimes for women and gay men to just talk to one another as people than it is for two gay men or a straight man and a straight woman.|`|AA12351891	This might not be a popular answer, but I'm going to say that a little misogyny comes with the territory.  Some gay men are actually afraid or repulsed by vaginas, I suppose; there's probably even three or four who just really don't like big breasts.  But this isn't the only thing keeping gay men from having sex with women--and if it isn't something physical, then that must mean it's something mental.  How they behave, react, emote... it doesn't matter what exactly, we've established at this point that it's due to a perceived difference between the mental faculties of men and women, which means it's fair (at least some of the time, in certain situations) to call it sexism.<br>  <br>  Fortunately, science has demonstrated that the average male and female brain do in fact have certain slight physical differences, and tend to perform some mental tasks in different ways as well.  So calling this preference misogyny or sexism may be going a bit too far, in some situations at least.  Consider this: two men share not only a more physically similar mind than a man and a woman, but also often share more similar life experiences, due to things like societal gender roles and parental expectations on behavior.  I think this increased general expectation of similarity is a large part of the draw for many gay men.  I have heard normally somber and serious straight men suddenly start waxing poetic about the "mystery that is women" when asked why they prefer women over men.  Gay men, I think, can do without this mystery, and prefer the comfort of the known.  Two men, looking into each other's eyes, are more able to know what the other's thinking.  In fact, with experienced gay men, sometimes one walks into a gay bar, looks across the room, meets the gaze of another, and they almost instantly know if they're interested in having sex, who's going to make the first move, how much talking will be involved, how much alcohol each is going to consume first, if that sex is going to happen some other night, later tonight or as soon as physically possible, where the sex is going to happen, who's the bigger top/bottom, what position(s) they're going to be in, and possibly much more.  This can certainly be a draw for gay men.<br>  <br>  At any rate, if there's one way gay men definitely don't feel about women, it's that they're nothing but sex objects.  This frees us to respect them as individuals, for their strength of character, and for the resolve, tact and diplomacy they demonstrate as inhabitants of a male-dominated society.  All of this can easily outweigh our feelings regarding them as sex objects (although women generally seem to seriously underestimate just how much value and importance men, gay and straight alike, can place on being a good sex object).<br>  <br>  As for shyness around women, this seems to largely boil down to personal experience and societal roles again.  There are gay men who go to parties and play with willing women's breasts.  (As I suggested back at the start, it's a stone cold f*gg*t who doesn't like women because of the boobs.)  Some are completely shy, awkward, and even ashamed and apologetic around women; they typically don't go to these types of parties.  Gay men can feel anywhere between these two extremes, or really just about anything else.

pA2jRPLKaa	Some Kurds are Iranian citizens, just as some Palestinians are Israeli citizens.  So as things stand at present you can say that some Kurds are Iranian, some are Iraqi, some Turkish and some Syrian.  The north of Iraq is almost developing into into an autonomous Kurdish state, and if  Iraq breaks up - as is looking increasingly likely - could well become the nucleus of an independent Kurdistan.  But given the attitudes of the other three governments - especially the Turkish - it may take a very long time.|`|0370fd46af40ff0a67a8182e1d0051a2aa	Kurds are from a region in Turkey, Iraq and Iran known as Kurdistan.

0b48Tr09aa	hi.how are you?i am from Greece.i like Kurds very much.i think Kurds are the most sinless people in the world.your dear country isn't  freedom  because Arab governments (Iraq.Syria)and Turkey government and Persian government(Iran) don't like Kurds and hate Kurds.Muslims are bad and terrorist people and we don't have really Muslims in the world.Muslims (all of Arabs like Palestine .iraq.syria.egypt .lebnon.gordan.......and  Malaysia and other Muslims in the world only think to Palestine people  and don't see Kurds as Muslims.you right.international   centers don't speak about Kurds and they only speak about Palestine. and this is worst  injustice in the world.because 10000000  sinless (children.men .women) were killed by turkie.iran.iraq.syria.govermants. in 25 years only.and international world didn't speak about it.and those governments kill many Kurds now. in iran.syria.turkie.but international world don't help and don't speak about it.you right.in Turkey Kurds cannot speak.in Iraq Georg bush helped Kurds and Kurds are freedom.now.in Syria Kurds cannot speak Kurdish and ....in Iran Kurds are killing by toxic (foods and water)and by  other things.but  international world don't say anything.i am sorry very much for our world and people of world special Muslims.my dear friend if you want help for Kurds please say me.i am very pleased to helping Kurdish people.have a nice time .i think kurdish people are best people in the world.becausa kurds think to most of people of  world.now most of europa contries like italy.greece.france.sweden.holland and .... like help kurds.bye|`|LN2uR6Wraa	The Kurds are self-reliant and independent and everyone want the oil field in their region.|`|AA10044748	The muslims can not even help them self.

Right now you sound like an uneducated bible thumper.|`|d03c88ba58ffba1bf408499a394e7d19aa	C.S. Lewis was an atheist.<br>  That which I greatly feared had at last come upon me. In the Trinity "Term of 1929 I gave in, and admitted that God was God, and knelt and prayed: perhaps, that night, the most dejected and reluctant convert in all England. I did not then see what is now the most shining and obvious thing; the Divine humility which will accept a convert even on such terms. The Prodigal Son at least walked home on his own feet. But who can duly adore that Love which will open the high gates to prodigal who is brought in kicking, struggling, resentful, and darting his eyes in every direction for a chance of escape?"<br>  <br>  Alister McGrath was an atheist.<br>  <br>  Lee Stroebel was an atheist.<br>  <br>  This type of "evolution" requires them to search for the evidence and examine it. Books like Case for Christ, and Mere Christianity are starts in their search I would say. SO there is hope for their salvation.  Too many of these atheist were what I call Christmas list Christians at one time and God didn't give them their wish or fit their philosophy and they gave up.  They were usually the ones that never read the Bible and thought God would grant prosperity and eternal health and happiness in this life.... like I said then never read and studied the Bible.  SO it will take them learning.... and they have made up their minds and stuck their heads in the sand.<br>  <br>  "Truth is absolute and knowable and must be searched for diligently, but many will try to hide it, deny it or muddy it." -   annon.|`|n26jThoCaa	I think the evolution happens the opposite way.  I went from liberal Christian to serious Christian to fundie new-Earth Christian, to agnostic, to atheist, to confident and knowledgeable atheist...  and I can keep going upward from there.<br>  <br>  Problem is, if we evolved INTO Christians there would be nowhere to go from there, and that's not how evolution works, there is no "The End, start over from the beginning," option.|`|wYtlYaFWaa	Nope.

Et ce jugement c'est que, la lumière étant venue dans le monde, les hommes ont préféré les ténèbres à la lumière, parce que leurs oeuvres étaient mauvaises. <br>  <br>  je ne voudrai pas vous prendre trop e votre temps mais sachez que les questions spirituelles faut les prendre avec beaucoup de prudence et de délicatesse;d'accord?<br>  En plus , il y a beaucoup de loup !<br>  <br>  Ne faite pas ce que je dis mais ce que dis la bible !<br>  Si vous croyez qu'il peux vous guider et vous entendre, alors rentrez dans votre chambre ou ailleurs, dans votre intimité et parlez lui, comme lorsque vous parlez à quelqu'un que vous voyez, dites lui ce que vous voulez; il vous guideras dans votre quète !<br>  Que Le Seigneur Jésus Christ vous dirige !|`|onf8j8Xaaa	ca dépend car c est large comme terme ,si s est pour etre catho va voir un curé car je sais pas trop, pour etre évangélique  c est tres simple<br>  1 tu doit te reconnaitre pécheur et perdu<br>  2 le seul moyen  pour etre pardonné c est Jésus , tu peut faire une priere  dans le genre  je reconnait que je suis pécheur ,je te demande de me pardonné mes péchés ,lave moi dans ton sang,<br>  je croit en toi Jésus ,je croit que tu est venu sur la terre pour me sauvé ,je te donne ma vie   ,merci de m avoir racheté amen<br>  tu peut allé sur des sites aussi comme topchrétien.com  ils explique tres bien <br>  bonne chance|`|1ace2c6b65c53751b8f7b83ea2e08580aa	Prie Dieu sincerement demande lui qu'Il mette quelqu'un sur ta route pour apprendre plus sur Lui.  <br>  Lis la Bible.|`|8258dba9f17d856922809a78d7c600b2aa	parler a un pretre pour te baptiser. attention tu recevras beaucoup de reponses qui ont pour but de te faire changer d'avis et d'offenser le christianisme. bonne chance et que le seigneur te benisse!|`|8ydzbPWEaa	La réponse la plus facile serait de t envoyer voir le pretre de l eglise a cote de chez toi... mais j'ai conscience que les pretres parraissent encore tres fermes et que ca peut effrayer un peu alors mon conseil sera... ca dépend de ton age:<br>  si tu es jeune, (18-35 ans) essaie de trouver une aumonerie ou un autre groupe de jeunes a cote de chez toi. tu pourras commencer en douceur, t habituer a l eglise et aux autres personnes du groupe sans rien te demander, ni sacrement ni meme qu on te demande si tu es chretien... et tu pourras leur poser toutes les questions que tu veux... et comme ils auront a peu pres ton age le contact sera peut etre plus facile.<br>  si tu n'es pas de cette tranche d age, d'autres groupes existent qui fonctionne de la meme maniere. <br>  en general, on trouve des prospectus avec le nom et un contact pour tous ces groupes dans les eglises où tu peux aller a peu pres n importe quand...<br>  et si tout ca te conviens pas, contacte moi je t emmenerai dans un de ces groupes! lol<br>  et bon courage!|`|bbfdb2c71f8430f776e19d7e6776c867aa	Plut?t que de chercher à te "convertir au christiannisme", je te conseille simplement de chercher à conna?tre Dieu et son message dans les évangiles.

Mais sais-tu ce que c'est le christianisme?<br>  <br>  Beaucoup pense que le christianisme c'est un ensemble des dénominations qui PARLENT DE CHRIST. Si c'est cela ta définition du christianisme, alors je te conseille de chercher une place devant la télé, un verre de lait à la main et oublier tout ?a car tu cherches ce qui t'ennuirait toute ta vie et risquerait de la saper sans pitié.<br>  <br>  Le Christianisme est UNE VIE dont le modèle est  CHRIST. Tu n'appartiendrais à aucune dénomination ou réligion tu serais le plus vrai des chrétiens et le plus heureux de la terre si du moins tu réalises quel est l'objet de cette vie.<br>  <br>  Qui est donc Christ? me demanderas-tu peut-être. Pour que tu en saisisses la portion essentielle, comprends bien ceci:<br>  Les humains se sont constitués ennemis de Dieu et se sont placés eux-mêmes du c?té de la cible à détruire, Satan. L'option de Dieu est de détruire cette race qui contient le virus le plus mortel et virulent qui soit : le péché. Et chacun des humains sans exception, hélas, l'a et va irrémediablement vers la mort. Mais comme Dieu est amour, Il présente une solution aux humains, comme Bill Gate le ferait si tous les Microsofts créés s'infectaient d'un virus qui détruit tout le système. Bill Gate ventilerait ce programme dans le monde entier pour que chaque ordinateur se débarrasse du virus. Le Microscroft qui s'avererait incomptatible sera inévitablement détruit sans procès. Et cela sans que Bill en ait le moindre regret. Détruire les logiciels infectés ne serait-ce pas de l'amour pour le bien des choses. Quelqu'un le condamnera t-il pour cela? <br>  <br>  Dieu a envoyé Christ dans le monde pour que Quiconque se l'incorpore comme une vie, puisse vivre et avoir le droit de vivre, sans quoi le sort est irrévocable. La mort!<br>  <br>  C'est pourquoi, il suffit de le recevoir dans sa vie comme Seigneur et Sauveur et C'EST TOUT.<br>  <br>  Le principe est simple et accesible à tous : CROIS AU SEIGNEUR JESUS TU SERA SAUVE.<br>  Le salut n'a pas d'autres conditions que croire à/en Jésus Christ.<br>  <br>  Il ne s'agit pas de consentir à un quelconqu'effort, pénitence, application des 10 commandements, etc. ON EST SAUVE APRES AVOIR CRU.  Quand on a cru et été sauvé alors on peut observer les commandements de Dieu.<br>  <br>  La chose se passe comme si tu avais été pauvre et mendiant. Et tu découvres que ton père est l'homme le plus riche du monde. Tu iras chez lui, Lui t'acceuillera sans t'exiger que tu deviennes d'abord comme lui ou l'un de ces enfants pour qu'il t'accepte comme fils et te faire jouir de tous ses biens. Tu n'auras pas encore les manières, la classe, le langage, l'élégance qui caractérisent un fils de noble, mais il n'en demeure pas moins que tu sois le fils de cet homme. Mais, c'est après que tu apprendras petit à petit la noblesse. Tu te retrouveras peut-être avec les autres fils pour parler de votre merveilleux père et apprendre avec votre chère noblesse. Par contre, tu conviendras avec moi que cet homme riche sera TRES EXIGENT VIS A VIS DE CEUX QUI NE SONT PAS SES ENFANTS. Il ne manifestera aucune tolérence pour eux. <br>  <br>  C'est pourquoi il est temps que tu choisisses dès aujourd'hui d'être son fils en t'intégrant ce programme et de ne pas être de l'autre c?té.<br>  <br>  Ainsi il n'y a qu'un seul pas à faire c'est CROIRE EN CHRIST et non ingurgiter les lois d'une quelconque réligion.<br>  Et je pense que je ne me trompe de dire que Dieu n'a rien avoir avec la réligion et même Il s'en moque! Tu sais que Jésus s'est bien moqué des pharisiens et des réligieux de son temps.

Existen dos tipos de melanina, la feomelanina (de rojo a amarillo) y la eumelanina (de marrón oscuro a *****). De cuatro a seis genes, que operan bajo dominancia incompleta, determinan el tipo de melanina y las cantidades. Cada uno de los progenitores proporciona una copia de cada gen, que presenta a su vez diversos alelos. Esto supone una gran variedad de tonos de piel.<br>  <br>  Una piel oscura protege al individuo del cáncer de piel, es decir, las mutaciones en las células de la piel inducidas por la luz ultravioleta. Las personas de piel clara tienen una probabilidad unas diez veces mayor de morir por cáncer de piel bajo las mismas condiciones de luz solar. Además, la piel oscura previene la destrucción de la vitamina B esencial folato por radiación ultra violeta.

And it's a very difficult thing for some people to do.  Perhaps they don't want to think that they are so sinful that they do not under any circumstances merit heaven on their own.  But it's only when you look at man as being absolutely destitute before the Lord that you can start to see how awesome and wonderful the Lord is.  All the way wonderful, not just part way with some glory given to us.  And now I can answer your question.<br>  <br>  In our clouded, blind, depraved state, there is no way that we would ever have the ability to choose God.  No one seeks him, Romans 3:11.  Salvation must then come from an external source, not an internal one.  Since we don't do the choosing, the only answer left is that God must do the choosing for us.  And, if he can do the choosing, the choice can be made at any time, and the Bible tells us when this has been done in Ephesians 1:4.  <br>  <br>  So, what about the unregenerate, the ones that do not seek him?  Surprise surprise, if God loves the ones he has chosen, then by definition he has no love for & no relationship with the ones he has not chosen.  Therefore Christ died for the chosen, John 17:9.  Does it mean that God predestines the unregenerate to hell?  No, that would make God the author of evil, and 2 Peter 3:9 says that the Lord is not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.  So this means that the unregenerate are simply left in their sins, condemned already (John 3:18).  Do the "chosen" have the right to any pride in their status as God's people?  No, if not for God's intervention they would be in the same boat as the unregenerate, they have nothing to claim because it was nothing they did, no choice they made, or would have made to distinguish them from the unbeliever.  It was simply God's grace that pulled them out of unbelief, the Holy Spirit's work in man's heart rather than man's action on his own heart, Ezekiel 36:26.  THAT'S predestination, a supreme, saving love, salvation from eternity to eternity, comfort, not robotics.|`|31e0283ff8bc957ec9168709f61d5bf0aa	We Are not. Your destiny can be seen by a fortune teller purely based on your present situation which he can call your fate. What he does not see is your own will to make a detour and change your own destiny. It may be true that you have a picture of your life ahead but is just based on ephimereal researches, written in the sky among the stars because of the present condition when you were born (like a higher mathemathical calculations of the scientists who can see what will be earth situation in the next generation). Like you, the scientists are doing its best to find a way to divert an oncoming asteroid or comet that may destroy the earth and that is what is considered on the Free Will given to man. there is no need for Bible backups.|`|c9a1b864f1a97925067a5a7737860ac4aa	The words translated “predestined” in the Scriptures referenced above are from the Greek word “proorizo,” which carries the meaning of “determine beforehand,” “ordain,” “to decide upon ahead of time.” So, predestination is God determining certain things to occur ahead of time. What did God determine ahead of time? According to Romans 8:29-30, God predetermined that certain individuals would be conformed to the likeness of His Son, be called, justified, and glorified. Essentially, God predetermines that certain individuals will be saved. Numerous Scriptures refer to believers in Christ being chosen (Matthew 24:22, 31; Mark 13:20, 27; Romans 8:33; 9:11; 11:5-7,28; Ephesians 1:11; Colossians 3:12; 1 Thessalonians 1:4; 1 Timothy 5:21; 2 Timothy 2:10; Titus 1:1; 1 Peter 1:1-2; 2:9; 2 Peter 1:10). Predestination is the Biblical doctrine that God in His sovereignty chooses certain individuals to be saved.<br>         If God is choosing who is saved, doesn’t that undermine our free will to chose and believe in Christ? The Bible says that we have the free will choice – all we have to do is believe in Jesus Christ and we will be saved (John 3:16; Romans 10:9-10). The Bible never describes God rejecting anyone who believes in Him or turning away anyone who was seeking Him (Deuteronomy 4:29). Somehow, in the mystery of God, predestination works hand in hand with a person being drawn by God (John 6:44) and believing unto salvation (Romans 1:16). God predestines who will be saved, and we must choose Christ in order to be saved. Both facts are equally true. Romans 11:33 proclaims, “Oh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable His judgments, and His paths beyond tracing out!”|`|YHuu8LVfaa	Ephesians 1:5 Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will, 6: To the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved.  Romans 28: And we know that all things work together for the good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose,29: For whom he did forknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethern. 30: moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called, them he also justified, themhe also glorified. We are called of Christ because he already knew we would accept the call.|`|c7ae28466da4eed846a08b25d4de5f6daa	I believe that we are predestined based on God's foreknowledge (Romans 8:29). There is a reason God included the word foreknew in there! <br>  <br>  We see in 2 Peter 3:9 as well as John 3:16 that God wants everybody to be saved, but not all will. That is because God, through His grace, gave us the ability to choose. <br>  <br>  God commanded the Israelites to choose between life and death in Deut 30:19. We see in the New Testament how God ministers to some who resist Him (Acts 7:51, Luke 13:34). God could force us to choose him, but He wants us to want to love Him.|`|eea28160e2175a4c8a06986bd36ddfe0aa	I do not believe in the concept - - and neither did anyone in the Church for the first 1,500 years.  John Calvin came up with the theory - and I believe he was totally wrong.  I am not Roman Catholic, but my views on the matter are closer to theirs than anything:<br>  <br>  The Roman Catholic Church teaches that Jesus Christ died for everybody and not just for some people. It calls predestination God's Plan and states that this plan also includes free will for mankind. Catechism of the Catholic Church #600 says - "To God, all moments of time are present in their immediacy. When therefore he establishes his eternal plan of "predestination", he includes in it each person's free response to his grace: "In this city, in fact, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel, gathered together against your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed, to do whatever your hand and your plan had predestined to take place." For the sake of accomplishing his plan of salvation, God permitted the acts that flowed from their blindness."|`|2f124b7a5c1ab950206072bf46bd1f6daa	Predestined means <br>  From G4253 and G3724; to limit in advance, that is, (figuratively) predetermine: - determine before, ordain, predestinate.<br>  <br>  Ephesians 1:4 - 5  According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love:  Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will, <br>  <br>  &<br>  Romans 8:29 - 30  For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.  Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified. <br>  <br>  So where is your freewill if this God PREDESTINED you to be a certain way?  You can't have the ability to make your own choices and been PREDESTINED to follow a certain path!<br>  <br>  Face it freewill is a myth NOT supported in your bible!<br>  <br>  WHY MUST A SATANIST BE THE ONE TO POINT THIS CRAP OUT!

Aber sp?ter haben vor allem Christen das AT auch missdeutet. Die Gebote vom Sinai sind zu verstehen als Wegweiser zu einem Leben in der Gemeinschaft, das gelingt. Nicht als Gesetze, deren Nichtbefolgung bestraft wird. Wo sich ein Volk nicht an den Geboten (der Thora) orientiert, schafft es sich selbst Probleme. Wo die Menschen ehebrechen, lügen und stehlen, oder wo dumpfer Aberglaube herrscht, kann keiner mehr glücklich leben. Das hat sich doch inzwischen überall herumgesprochen. Oder?<br>  Es ist peinlich, wenn Menschen, die vom Christentum herkommen, noch auf diesen alten Fehldeutungen beharren, Gott, der Vater von Jesus Christus, sei "im AT rachsüchtig und blutrünstig" (gewesen).<br>  Lies mal Jesaja 40 und 61, da schl?gt das Herz des barmherzigen, liebenden Gottes im Alten Testament.<br>  Oder frage (h?flich und vorsichtig) jüdische Menschen, wie sie das sehen, was sie aus ihrer Bibel heraush?ren.<br>  <br>  "Auge um Auge, Zahn um Zahn" bedeutet übrigens nicht, dass man dem anderen ein Auge ausschl?gt, wenn er einem das eigene geraubt oder versehentlich ausgestochen hat, sondern dass dafür ein Wert (in Geld oder Naturalien) als Entsch?digung zu zahlen ist, der nicht h?her sein darf als die Entsch?digung für ein Auge bzw. einen Zahn, eine Hand usw. Von einem Mann names Lamech wird in der Urgeschichte Genesis 4,23f erz?hlt, dass er für eine Wunde bzw. eine Beule sich r?cht, indem er den Verursacher totschl?gt und dass er 77-fach Rache nehmen will. Aber das wird erz?hlt, nicht gutgehei?en!

Auf der einen Seite sagt Gott über sich selbst: "Ich bin ein eifersüchtiger Gott: Bei denen, die mir feind sind, verfolge ich die Schuld der V?ter an den S?hnen und an der dritten und vierten Generation" (Deuteronomium 5,9); und: "Wenn du nicht auf die Stimme des Herrn, deines Gottes, h?rst... werden all diese Verfluchungen über dich kommen...: Verflucht bist du in der Stadt, verflucht bist du auf dem Land... Der Herr heftet die Pest an dich, bis er dich ausgemerzt hat..." (Deuteronomium 28,15-68, ein Text übrigens, den man in seiner ganzen L?nge einmal gelesen haben muss, um zu verstehen, wie entsetzliche ein Rachegott sein kann).<br>  <br>  2. Auf der anderen Seite wird das Bild eines unglaublich liebevollen g?ttlichen Wesens gezeichnet, z.B. Jesaja 66,13: "Wie eine Mutter ihren Sohn tr?stet, so tr?ste ich euch." oder Psalm 103,8: "Der Herr ist barmherzig und gn?dig, langmütig und reich an Güte." Bemerkenswert!<br>  <br>  3. Was nun?

IJocNAQYaa	Je vais essayer d'expliquer en sommaire.<br>  Le Coran en quelques Sortes est un code ( comme le code pénal, loi de fnance etc..) difficile à interpréter.<br>  <br>  Par le biais de notre prophète SAW, nous avons appris à être des bons musulmans.<br>  Le Coran a dit: Faites la prière sans donner de détails.<br>  Notre prophète SAW nous a expliqué comment faire cette prière en détail.<br>  Il en est de même pour les ablutions, pour le Ramadan, pour la Zakat, pour le Haj, etc...<br>  Durant la vie de notre prophète SAW ses compagnons et les plus proches ont suivi à la lettre ce que faisait le prophète SAW gestes et faits. (c'est la sunnah)<br>  Chaque jour notre prophète SAW dictait ou expliquait une loi.<br>  C'est ce que les gens appelle le Hadith ( dire du prophète SAW).<br>  Un dire qui fait loi en interdisant une chose ou l'obligation d'en faire.<br>  Par la suite et avec le temps les savants musulmans ont regroupé ces hadiths en ouvrages répértoriés et numérotés par cas et par rite.<br>  C'est d'après cetains Quristes l'équivalent des évengiles.<br>  La sunnah, c'est ce que faisait le prophète  SAW .<br>  Il est judicieux de suivre la sunnah du prophète SAW  dans la mesure du possible.<br>  exemple, faire les cinq prières de la journée plus les prières surogatoires comme le faisait le prophète c'est la sunnah.<br>  Ne faire que les 5 prières de la journée et une ou deux prières surogatoires, c'est bien, c'est suffisant et il n'y a aucun manque dans tes prières.<br>  et ainsi de suite.<br>  <br>  Donc en résumé un musulman doit<br>  1/ avoir le Coran à ses c?tés. en savoir par coeur le maximum possible sans en conna?tre les explications et essayer par la suite d'en conna?tre les significations.<br>  2/ Conna?tre comment pratiquer l'islam par les hadiths, soit de bouche à oreilles (en majeur partie c'est le cas) soit en lisant les hadiths qui eux aussi sont rédigés en langue arabe un peu difficile pour les non initiés.<br>  Dans ce cas, il existe des ouvrages qui relatent un hadith et l'expliquent en général dans un langage très facile à comprendre et avec des exemples.|`|1f81d9a90dcb06dcb3b2d80e3c317b3faa	Parce que pour l'islam tout est lié: La révélation , la vie du prophète , ce qu'il dit , ce qu'il fait, tout est dicté par Dieu . Une autre raison aussi c'est que de son vivant, le prophète était en même temps, chef spirituel , politique, militaire etc...

Le "Livre" est bien s?r le Coran, que le Prophète a retransmis aux hommes ; quant au terme "Sagesse" ici employé, il désigne la Sunna, comme en témoigne cet autre verset, dans lequel Dieu dit aux épouses du Prophète : "Et gardez en mémoire ce qui est récité dans vos maisons, de Versets de Dieu et de la Sagesse" (Coran 33/34). En plus des versets coraniques, quoi donc d'autre que les propos du Prophète les épouses de celui-ci entendaient-elles dans leur maison ?<br>  <br>  "Et ce que le Messager vous apporte, prenez-le, et ce que qu'il vous interdit, abstenez-vous en" (Coran 59/7). "Conformez-vous à (ce que dit) Dieu et conformez-vous à (ce que dit) Son Messager" (Coran 5/92). "Conformez-vous à ce (que dit) Dieu et conformez-vous à (ce que dit)Son Messager et à (ce que disent) les détenteurs de l'autorité parmi vous ; si vous divergez alors au sujet de quelque chose, faites référence de cette chose auprès de Dieu et de Son Messager si vous croyez en Dieu et au jour dernier" (Coran 4/59) : il s'agit bien de deux sources : les paroles de Dieu et celles du Prophète : si le Prophète ne faisait que transmettre les paroles de Dieu, le verbe "conformez-vous à" n'aurait pas été répété, exactement comme il n'a pas été répété avant "les détenteurs de l'autorité". <br>  <br>  Pourquoi le besoin des enseignements de la Sunna en plus de ceux du Coran ?<br>  <br>  La Sunna montre la fa?on humaine de vivre les enseignements coraniques :<br>  2.a) la Sunna détaille les enseignements du Coran, qui demeurent, eux, souvent d'ordre général ; le Coran dit simplement : "Accomplissez parfaitement la prière" (73/20 etc.) ; mais c'est le Prophète qui a détaillé quelles sont les invocations, les postures et la concentration qui composent la prière ; il en est de même concernant la zakate, le je?ne, le pèlerinage, les invocations, etc. : le Coran se contente de mentionner sommairement ces actions, tandis que c'est le Prophète qui les a détaillées ;<br>  2.b) la Sunna définit le champ d'application des lois coraniques, en déterminant les conditions pour leur applicabilité et les exceptions dans leur application : ainsi en est-il des conditions d'applicabilité de certaines peines mentionnées telles quelles dans le Coran ;<br>  2.c) la Sunna offre les repères humains pour la mise en pratique d'enseignements qui, sinon, demeureraient fort théoriques car n'existant que sous formes de phrases dans un Livre ; ainsi, le Coran dit : "Accomplissez parfaitement la prière" (73/20 etc.) et fait les éloges de "ceux qui, dans leur prière, sont dévoués" (23/2) ; mais voilà des paroles qui resteraient très théoriques pour nous si nous n'avions pas de repères humains quant à la fa?on de les vivre ; et ces repères, nous les avons eus par le biais du Prophète, qui priait la nuit au point qu'on lui demanda pourquoi il se donnait autant de peine (al-Bukhar? 6106 Muslim 2819) ; dont on entendait, lorsqu'il priait, montant de sa poitrine, le son de ses pleurs (Ab? Dao?d 904, an-Nassa'? 1214) ; qui a dit : "La fra?cheur de mes yeux a été placée dans la prière" (an-Nassa'? 3940) et : "Bilal, donne le second appel vers la prière et procure-nous le repos par celle-ci" (Ab? Dao?d 4985) ; voilà les repères humains montrant comment il s'agit de mettre en pratique cette "dévotion dans la prière" dont parle le Coran ; on pourrait passer en revue d'autres aspects de sa vie ;<br>  2.d) la Sunna offre aussi le modèle humain pour la mise en pratique de l'ensemble des règles qu'offre le Coran : elle induit un équilibre en pla?ant chaque enseignement à sa place et en prévenant les risques d'excès : c'est bien le Prophète qui a enseigné comment à la fois être dévoué à Dieu, s'engager pour Sa cause, et avoir une vie humaine normale ; sans ce modèle, les musulmans se consacreraient à un enseignement coranique au détriment de tous les autres.<br>  2.e) la Sunna offre une dynamique dans la mise en ?uvre des enseignements coraniques : certains enseignements du Coran ne sont applicables que lorsque certains points ont pu être réalisés ; c'est la référence à la Sunna qui permet de le comprendre .<br>  <br>  Tout ceci fait que le rapport entre les éléments communiqués par la Sunna et les éléments du Coran est comparable, toutes proportions gardées, au rapport existant entre la loi, décidée par l'autorité législative du pays, et le décret d'application de cette loi, décidé par l'autorité exécutive du même pays.<br>  <br>  A la lumière de ce qui précède, on ne peut, en tant que musulman, que penser ceci : Dieu a voulu que le Prophète ait pour r?le non seulement de transmettre le texte du Coran mais également de détailler par ses paroles et ses actes les enseignements du Coran. Toujours en tant que musulman, on ne peut que penser aussi que dès lors que Dieu a voulu que les paroles et actes du Prophète détaillent les enseignements du Coran, et dès lors qu'Il a voulu que le Coran parvienne dans son authenticité jusqu'à nous, Il a également voulu que ces paroles et actes du Prophète parviennent eux aussi jusqu'à nous|`|e8c49be68faa1848082685530bf78f9caa	le coran et la sunah sont complementaires<br>  le coran ce sont les paroles de Dieu telles que le prophète les a re?ues de l'ange Gabriel<br>  la sunah ce sont aussi  des revelations Divines mais reformulées par le prophète soit par ses propres paroles soit par des actes.

c9a1b864f1a97925067a5a7737860ac4aa	The root of the word “limbo” is the edge of a hem on a garment, so the word itself is telling us that limbo is someplace which borders very close to another. A very broad definition of limbo is a zone which exists between two definite places. The Bible does not give the name “limbo” to any specific place or realm, but various people have used the word “limbo” in various ways.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  One Roman Catholic tradition names a limbo for children who die before their baptisms or die outside of the Roman Catholic religion. There is no Bible support for this view. It is merely a religious opinion which has been handed down by Catholic theologians. For a study on the destiny of children who die, please read our article on the age of accountability.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  The closest Biblical account for a “limbo” concerns “Abraham’s bosom” and “Paradise” in the parable of the rich man and Lazarus (Luke 16:19-31). Although it is a parable, to teach a truth concerning prophecies declaring the kingdom of God, the places mentioned must exist or Jesus would not have used them. Parables are not based upon imaginary objects and locations, but things which are real. So, before the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, there were two places souls went to upon death. One place is at the side a Abraham (often described as Abraham’s bosom); this would be people who died in faith in God’s promise, just as Abraham did, and were declared righteous by faith just as he was (Genesis 15:4-6; Romans 4:13-24). Those who died in unbelief went to a place of torment. The Greek word used is Hades and probably is the best Greek word for the Jewish “Sheol,” literally the lowest pit. It is clearly a place of great torment.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  When Jesus is on the cross, remember that He turned to the thief and told the man: “Assuredly, I say to you, today you will be with Me in Paradise” (Luke 23:43). He must have been referring to that place where the soul of Abraham was, so it seems that paradise is another name for “Abraham’s bosom.” When Jesus went to paradise where the thief, Abraham, and others who believed God’s promises were, He set them free through preaching the gospel to them so their faith could become complete.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  This ties into Paul’s explanation of a prophetic passage quoted and explained in Ephesians 4:7-10: “But to each one of us grace was given according to the measure of Christ’s gift. Therefore He {God} says: ‘When He ascended on high, He led captivity captive, And gave gifts to men.’ Now this, “He ascended”—what does it mean but that He also first descended into the lower parts of the earth [Paradise/Abraham’s bosom]? He who descended is also the One who ascended far above all the heavens, that He might fill all things.” So the “limbo” of Paradise is gone now, because its inhabitants, who were “captured” by Jesus, have entered into the presence of God, just as each Christian does upon their death (2 Corinthians 5:8).<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  This leaves us with Sheol as the only limbo remaining. But this is also a temporary limbo. These souls will appear at the second resurrection before the great white throne of Revelation 20:11-13. These people are not in the Book of Life because they do not have eternal life through faith in Christ and they are cast into their final destination in the “Lake of Fire / Gehenna.”<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  The idea of Limbo as a realm in between Heaven and Hell, sort of another Purgatory, is not Biblical. If there is any sort of a Limbo, it is the temporary holding place of the wicked (Hades / Sheol), which will eventually be emptied into the lake of fire (Revelation 20:11-15).<br>  <br>  Recommended Resource:  What the Bible Says about Heaven & Eternity by Ice & Demy.|`|bRIm5TJdaa	Only at the skating rink!<br>  <br>  Limbo has no place in Church!<br>  Purgatory has no place in Church either.<br>  One does not have to EARN their way into heaven.<br>  <br>  `|`|AA10249608	No, there is no such thing.A Catholic belief,well until now.|`|AA10293793	Purgatory - opinions differ, depending on which brand of christianity you're talking about, but Purgatory is supposed to be a place where people who haven't earned either heaven or hell can cleanse themselves, through suffering of course, of their sins and make themselves worthy of heaven.|`|UVNIjYuFaa	we know what limbo means and no|`|wxBFZ41Taa	According to the Catholic faith, there is purgatory.

The Pope recently reiterated that limbo is not, nor ever was an official teaching of the churchl...and that we really just don't know what happens to unbaptized babies.

They may also plant images and data on networks that others may find disturbing (usually indirectly relating to the individual in person) in order to cause confrontation, i.e loss of jobs; marriage disruption. While not deemed as 'hacking', such a practice is against the Computer Misuse Act 1990, where mischief is caused in order to ensure chaos is spread.[1]|`|7b69af62f1022457c55e7f4a3e14ea56aa	Alguien que intenta causar polemica... en los foros con diversos temas...|`|QnaYXVXgaa	uhhh loco..están todos dados vuelta acá...qué flash...|`|4B2vn8Mnaa	Lo que eres tu.. un ser horrible<br>  <br>  sino me crees mira acá: <br>  <a href="http://www.howardlyon.com/images/paintings/page%203/Cave%20Troll%20Final%20Small.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.howardlyon.com/images/paintin...</a>|`|82689351eae553bf76ee3a7de759997baa	Un troll es un usuario que se mete a los foros a molestar a los demas.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troll_(Internet)" rel="nofollow">http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troll_(Inte...</a>|`|MsCm6t3qaa	me gustaría satisfacer tu curiosidadpero, no lo sé.|`|tT1hvekjaa	No , escuchastes mal , la palabrita es TROLO .O.O.<br>  DYAN , QUE MIRADA PENETRANTE TIENES , HUSAS CONTACTOS O SON TUYOS , TROLO.-|`|28dfcc70a5b1b374fd9ce1368a93b63faa	Es Un Duende Muy Malo|`|29881e000bb399a28d8a1f0591fff223aa	Creo que es un mu?equito con los pelos parados, que sonn hermosos|`|330rR7Suaa	Ni ellos mismos saben que es un troll pero no les creas y sigue con tu noble causa, crear polémica en YR.|`|3a8be8b383b627043e0e011840dccccfaa	Es una bestia de la mitologia, o un ser del mundo magico, se caracteriza por ser exageradamente torpe, se comunican entre ellos por gru?idos y gestos, atacan a las personas pero su principal caracteristica es su torpeza...<br>  Comen carne humana o animal... y en algunos libros se vuelven de piedra con la luz del sol, en algunos mas ya no son suceptibles al sol...|`|4iCs2oeBaa	Es una persona que solo busca crear controversia....|`|c6bf35d8a150507c066e268115d972e5aa	bue me parece que algo de razon tienen si ya los tratas mal a los demas sin respeto, pero sinceramente nunca oi algo asi en mi vida.|`|fb7da14f3d33d8ef508190ca76cec1caaa	tu eres un troll en internet, lo mismo que un una falla en el sistema educativo, un cancer de la sociedad, una verguenza para tus padres, un parasito de la sociedad, una ladilla que molesta la intimidad, una almorrana en los ciclistas, y ya me canse de decirte de cosas, no entiendes de todas maneras|`|0196e8591836f9be6069910ce91d89eeaa	alguien muy feo|`|0gTCzEmZaa	Gracias, aprendi algo nuevo.

Vivían en grutas o en castillos en la cumbre de las colinas, robando y comiéndose a cualquier viandante tan atrevido como para entrar en sus dominios durante la noche. Enormes, de piel dura y casi indestructibles, poseían un defecto: si se los capturaba a pleno sol se convertían en piedra o estallaban.<br>  <br>  En el folclore posterior, los trolls eran menos impresionantes y malignos. Cometían actos de malicia característicos, como robar las viandas a las muchachas que cruzaban por sus dominios, y también tenían poderes semimágicos tales como la profecía y las metamorfosis. Fuera de Escandinavia se los asocia con historias infantiles y se los presenta como habitantes de terraplenes situados en los límites exteriores de las tierras cultivadas, dedicados a cometer travesuras.<br>  <br>  Los trolls tienen su lugar en la literatura. Henrik Ibsen recurrió a ellos en Peer Gynt como símbolos del mal. En las historias para ni?os, tales como El Hobbit de J. R. R. Tolkien, se los describe como muy peligrosos, aunque esencialmente son criaturas de reacciones lentas. Parecen ser también la inspiración de los monstruos de la obra ilustrada de Maurice Sendak Donde viven los monstruos. En las populares historias de los Mumin, de Tove Jansson, se han metamorfoseado en criaturas benignas que viven en una arcadia rural.|`|6PnpFapHaa	El significado de la palabra troll es incierto. Originalmente podría haber tenido el significado de ?sobrenatural? o ?mágico? con un revestimiento de ?maligno? y ?peligroso?. Otra probable sugerencia es que significa ?alguien que se comporta violentamente?. En la antigua ley sueca, trolleri era un tipo particular de magia usada para provocar da?o. Debería advertirse que términos escandinavos como trolldom (brujería) y trolla/trylle (?realizar trucos de magia?) no implican relación alguna con los seres mitológicos.

xBsUDM5oaa	Greetings!<br>  <br>  In my experience as a Minister, some people only want to know what "benefits" of a particular Religion are availiable.<br>  <br>  They treat it the same as buying insurance, or rooting for a footbal team-the Human Condition.<br>  <br>  "New-Age", "Non-Christian", "Christian Spirituality", all share Elements, but it is the individual which defines the Actions produced.<br>  <br>  "The tradition of Christian Mysticism is as old as Christianity itself. At least three texts from the New Testament set up themes that recur throughout the recorded thought of the Christian mystics. The first, Galatians 2:20, says that:<br>  <br>  I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me, and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.<br>  <br>  The second important scriptural text for Christian mysticism is 1 John 3:2:<br>  <br>  Beloved, now we are the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.<br>  <br>  The third such text, especially important for Eastern Christian mysticism, is found in II Peter 1:4:<br>  <br>  ...Exceedingly great and precious promises [are given unto us]; that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.<br>  <br>  Two major themes of Christian mysticism are (1) a complete identification with, or imitation of Christ, to achieve a unity of the human spirit with the spirit of God; and (2) the perfect vision of God, in which the mystic seeks to experience God "as he is," and no more "through a glass, darkly." (1 Corinthians 13:12)"<br>  (wikipedia)<br>  <br>  I am Initiate in a Mystic Christian sect, and the emphasis is on practices where Knowledge turns to Wisdom, and one proceeds into the World with the ability for Right Action.<br>  <br>  Christianity must either evolve, or go back to its Root, in order to interact with the "Real World".<br>  <br>  /!\|`|dOXUYv0Xaa	Mysticism is the development within the inner self of a beautiful process leading to "Wisdom". Without wisdom<br>  man is like a leaf blowing in a turbulent wind. There have been Mystics in every form of religion. Most have hidden themselves away from the world, never to be seen again.<br>  Mystics know that there is a world of the "seen' and the world of the "unseen". If one experiences the world of the "unseen", questions pertaining to the outer world or "seen" are easier to comprehend. Mysticism ultimately is that which allows man to come to a greater understanding of the relationship between man and God. Mysticism was practiced by all of Gods Prophets. This is something that is very difficult for most humans to understand unless they clear the excess baggage from the mind and heart, allowing the heart to open.<br>  When the heart of man opens a beautiful fragrance is emitted, attracting the one we call God.<br>  Its much like a flower opening, attracting the honey bee.<br>  It's not an easy path, for it takes patience, determination and certitude.<br>  Mystics have surrendered their heart to God.<br>  Allowing their will to melt and allowing Gods will to be permenant in their life.<br>  All mystics are identical. They are one happy family living in "Unity"|`|6c738af4ac776343f2bc535bba7907ceaa	I believe that mysticism is a direct experiencing of the Divine force, whatever the person chooses to call it.|`|AA10691201	A Christian Mystic is like any other mystic who has had a mystic experience, but after the experience, since they are a Christian they relate the experience to Christianity. <br>  St. John of the Cross is a famous Christian mystic. <br>  Mystics all tend to experience Unity.|`|ptRpoC0yaa	The aim of the christian life is the acquisition of the Holy Spirit.<br>  The highest gift of the spirit that some saints of the East aquired, was in the school of Hesychast. To step into it, you may find information in the Philocalia.<br>  <br>  Philocalia  A collection of writtings of the Fathers of the Church, begining from the time of Constantine.<br>  It contains the instructions, admonitions, and personal experimental knowledge of the spiritual path written by holy man and saints.<br>  The Prayer of Jesus or The Prayer of the Heart is it special province. The selection, on this matter, from St. Simeon the New Theologian can be found also in the Philocalia (Philokalia).<br>  The Hesychast, are practitioners in this form of prayer.<br>  <br>  The Holly Bible mentions the need for seaceless praying in order to acquire de Gifts of the Holy Spirit, and is one of the major inward and outward expressions of a mystic life.<br>  <br>  <br>   In the Conversation of Saint Seraphim of Sorov with Nicholas Motovilov concerning the Aim of a Christian Life, we read<br>  "The Holy Spirit itself enters our soul, and this entrance into our soul of Him, the Almightly, and the presence with our spirit of the Triune Majesty is only granted to us through our own assiduous acquisition of the Holly Spirit, which prepares in our soul and body a throne for the all-creative presence of God with our spirit according to His irrevocable word".<br>  <br>  Also see "Three Methods of Attention and Prayer", by Simon the New Theologian.

For you travel land and sea to win one proselyte, and when he is won, you make him twice as much a son of hell as yourselves". (Jesus' Words in John 7:24; Luke 7:43, 12:57 and Matt. 23:15)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  There is an extremely serious error that is being believed by the vast majority of people caught up in christian religion. This error is literally making those folks unwilling and unable to discern truth. And what is this error? It is believing that all "judgment" is wrong. If this is true, then what is to be made of Jesus' Words above? In the verses above, Jesus clearly commands people to judge, commends people for judging, and judges himself.<br>  <br>  The key point to understand is that not all judgment is wrong, just various types of judgment. The types of judgment that are wrong according to Jesus are condemnation, as well as hypocritical and self-righteous judgment. On the other hand, right judgment is commended by Jesus as we see above. Right judgment includes the judging of truth versus falsehood. The sincere, serious and sober judgment of our own sins, as well as the gentle, and compassionate judgment and correction of other's beliefs or sins.<br>  <br>  What is the matter with 'judging'?<br>  <br>  Tragically, Satan is doing a masterful job in christianity's organizations in regard to confusing people over the issue of "judgment". People have been lead to believe that it is "un-loving" to correct someone who is in error, whether by word or deed. Certainly many have contributed to Satan's lie of "don't judge anyone" by being harsh, ungracious or unmerciful in their judgments. It is easy for a person - after being excoriated by a modern day Pharisee who is telling them that they are going to hell if they don't believe something that Jesus doesn't even address - to be pushed to believe that all "judgment" is wrong.|`|kPyVTLRKaa	I'm really not sure<br>  i think that everyone should make their own choices, and not judge...specially when it comes to religion.|`|lSR5VQ0Saa	Not everyone gets angy.

You also need to destroy the social safety net, so do away with food stamps, welfare, and Medicaid.  Finally you need to outlaw private and charter schools and have everyone go through the same federally controlled public school system.

(and it does not have to be a man that eats the plant, but possibly an animal - and it does not have to be soil that a man is decomposed in, but possibly water).|`|ObrjZ8mmaa	i would not change a thing. cos all that has happened has brought me to where I am now.|`|AA11610394	im going to live agasin as myself on whichever day God says

c466b9fe384ccd2f6427a9a20ea03052aa	Al parecer este texto está copiado de un chat, ya que el habla es informal y con algunas fallas ortográficas.<br>  Para el departamento (un Wg es un departamento alquilado y no propio) pagarías 300 euros al mes (supongo que no es en Alemania porque se comenta que ese dinero "no es comparable con los precios alemanes") y 300 iniciales de Kaution (o sea, depósito). Sólo tiene un cuarto.<br>  También menciona que en el depa, el que escribe vive con amigo suyo (un "Kumpel") y un tipo que es quien lo renta, pero que este tipo no siempre está ahí, sino que se la pasa con su novia.

Es una abreviatura alemana para lo que aquí llamaríamos piso compartido, aunque en Alemania los pisos compartidos son un poco diferentes a los espa?oles. Normalmente cada habitación tiene su propia cocina y puede que su ba?o, tienen llave en cada habitación y normalmente no tienen una sala de estar común, por lo que puedes no ver a tus compa?eros de piso en toda la semana.

T48BkNDmaa	I would have a baby shower about 3-4 weeks before the baby's birth and then have a birthday party for your daughter on her birthday. This way you get to celebrate both events but they are far enough away from each other that they don't interrupt one another. Also you might not want to plan a huge birthday party. She probably won't be feeling quite up to a big party that soon after giving birth.<br>  <br>  Have a wonderful time!|`|8iA8Ncxzaa	The first two answers pretty much hit the nail on the head. It does not sound like the new baby will even have a father. How sad is that? If you are a christian, you should be praying for your daughter and the illigitemate baby and the suffering it will have. According to christian faith both are going to hell. I would say the fun and party days are long over for your partying daughter unless she plans to sluff off the baby onto society like so many other single mothers have done.|`|m7IS8wvkaa	Is she married? If not, I would be more concerned about your daughter bringing a bastard child into an already overpopulated world. If she is married, then congratulations and the best of luck to you. If not, shame on you for enabling your daughters obvious poor choices regarding her sexual activities.|`|511f5aeedcd688bb382e8547310bfac5aa	It might be hard to convince family and friends to attend two separate parties. Perhaps have her choose which is more important to her, and make that a larger party? For example, maybe she can go out with a few of her closest friends for dinner (and you, of course) to celebrate her birthday, but have a big shower where you invite more people for the baby? <br>  <br>  Or, you could do a full day event. Start with a shower at your home for the baby in the afternoon, say, around 3, then, on the invitation, say, "The celebration continues later that evening at (mention restaurant or same home, etc.) where we will celebrate her 19th birthday. We hope you will join us for both parts of the celebration as we support her in becoming a mother and celebrate another year of her life." <br>  <br>  As far as I know, your question didn't ask for any judgment to be passed, so I ain't gonna pass any. Good luck.|`|0320fb72089d365755059c57e016436eaa	Obviously, she loves to 'party,' or else she wouldn't be knocked up at NINETEEN.<br>  <br>  IMHO, this isn't something to celebrate. Full-time student? Not anymore, unless she tosses the kid into the care of family or a babysitter, so that the child can grow up with no attachment to his/her mother. And how financially capable can she be of taking care of someone else, when she isn't even taking care of HERSELF (still living at home)? Also, where's the father?<br>  <br>  Yeah, congratulations for contributing to the new generation of knocked-up teenagers. You must be so proud.

Qp00DCokaa	Ahhh! Mexico es hermoso! Depende de lo que quieras hacer. Si quieres ir a la playa te recomiendo la peninsula de Yucatan (no necesariamente Cancun) pero lo que ahora llaman "La riviera maya".

S51x5vK3aa	Ich bin mit 14 Jahren zum Buddhismus übergetreten. Er wurde von Buddha Shakyamuni (Buddha ist ein Titel, kein Gott!) etwa 480 v. Chr. gestiftet. Er übernimmt Vieles aus den traditionellen indischen Religionen (kurz Hinduismus), wie z. B. das allumfassende Moralgesetz "karman", der Kreislauf der Wiedergeburten "samsaara" oder das ewige Erl?schen "nirvaana".<br>  <br>  Der Buddhismus lehrt, dass der Mensch mit jeder Wiedergeburt neuem Leiden ausgesetzt wird. Ziel ist deshalb, den Kreislauf der Wiedergeburten zu verlassen (ins Nirvana eingehen). Das kann nur durch die richtige Ethik (Achtfacher Pfad) erreicht werden. Oberstes Gebot ist die Gewaltlosigkeit gegenüber allen Lebewesen.<br>  <br>  Ziel eines Buddhisten ist, durch unendliches Mitleid zu den Mitmenschen und steter Bemühung um das Verstehen der Welt vom eigenen Leiden erl?st zu werden.<br>  <br>  Als man den Dalai Lama XIV. (er ist nicht Oberhaupt des Buddhismus, sondern geistiger und weltlicher Führer der Tibeter) einst fragte, wie er seinen Glauben beschreiben würde, sagte er: "Meine Religion bedeutet Freundlichkeit."<br>  <br>  Der Buddhismus ist viertgr??te Religion in der Welt und z?hlt ca. 450 Mio. Anh?nger. Er respektiert alle Glaubensrichtungen, solange sie auf Liebe und Leidenschaft aufgebaut sind.<br>  <br>  Ich hoffe, jetzt hast du einen Durchblick, was Buddhismus anbelangt... ;-)<br>  <br>  Tschüss!|`|549a6a34972e04b5fe8f13880a76060baa	Ich bin von I-kuan-Dao. Wurde früher in China verfolgt. Wir beten alle G?tter der Welt und eigene Ahnen an.  Wir sagen nicht, da? die eine oder die andere Religion besser oder schlechter ist. Jede Religion hat einen Gott (oder mehrere G?tter). Alle G?tter sind zu verehren.|`|d9b00245c9495b3f940cd53394f68d16aa	ich bin hinduistin, aber genau genommen vaishnavi, die vishnu oder Krishna verehrt. In den Schriften steht: <br>  Krishna, der als Govinda bekannt ist - ist die h?chste Gottheit. Er hat einen ewigen, allwissenden und glücksehlligen K?rpter, Er ist der Ursprung von allen und Er ist die Ursache aller Ursachen. Das ist für mich die perfekteste Kurzbeschreibung Gottes und damit bin ich h?chstzufrieden und verehre Ihn, Krishna.|`|vi5t6P8vaa	Alle im Allgemeinen als ?Weltreligionen“ bezeichneten Religionen haben ihren Ursprung in Asien.<br>  In Asien werden alle Religionen vertreten ,aber haupts?chlich der Buddhismus.<br>  Geh?re aber dem Islam an.

AA11767986	I agree. Despite its massive arrogance, I think it's just a way to cope with what happened. And as far as children starving to death, I can't stand it when people say that, I tell them they might as well go to one of those countries and just spit in their face while they're at it, that's such a crock. Brushing it under the God-rug is horrible.|`|M4tAy4ECaa	God is playing with dice|`|aIj0MkWYaa	Good Q<br>  Also, what if god let terrible things happen? Was that just gawd working in mysterious ways?<br>  total cop out, IMO<br>  :)|`|owwlyib0aa	it is the result of disobedience when given a choice in the Garden of Eden.....everything bad is our (human) doing by not trusting God enough to obey Him when He told us not to touch that tree.........God allowed us to make a choice, and we made the wrong choice, and brought all this on ourselves.|`|6jI6LEvmaa	So what you are asking is why are we not living in a world where nothing bad ever happens and there are no problems and everyone is happy? And since it isn't that way Boo on God? You could be an instrument of God on earth helping those starving children, finding ways to protect people but instead you are on a computer complaining because didn't put you in Heaven.|`|MMbnFgZcaa	the reason people suffer is becasue there is sin in the world.  people get hurt and die becasue of the fall, and God takes that suffering that is innevitableand turns it to save other's eternal soul|`|OcdYCP8Zaa	If satan had his way we would all be dead, people overthink things sometimes|`|Z7PBj0ttaa	I spit on god - you see I even didn't write it in capital letters.

Good question.|`|ep4oVgaBaa	God doesnt 'let anything happen' he gave us free will so we could do what we wanted. Hes watching us and waiting to see if we can do his work. In my opinion people that blame God for tragedies are mistaken. He suffers along with us everytime something like that happens. If you believe in his promise all this will end shortly anyways.|`|nbP9NOFgaa	I won't tell you He has a plan, i won't tell you He works in mysterious ways. I WILL, however, tell you that He did give humans free will... they chose to deprieve the third world countries, they chose to get in that car drunk or not look before entering the intersection... God has NO control over those who don't believe in Him whereas those who do He does so He would have placed them in the seats that recieved the least amount of impact therefore saving their life. <br>  <br>  If you dont' beleive in God you shouldn't go around blaming Him for everything either.|`|MFFd7L3Iaa	I look out for me.

X9rhcHCpaa	don't really know where it is but " an eye for an eye". you are protecting yourself, thereby you sow your life to go on, reap the life you saved is yours.|`|0G96V7Kbaa	The Bible talks about turning the other cheek and love your enemies.  For me, this has several meanings.<br>  <br>  First, Jesus was talking to the Jews.  Because of the Law of Moses, they were living under some pretty strict guidelines.  "If this happens you do this" spelled out type of law.  (Read the scriptures after the Ten Commandments.)  Christ was trying to show the Jews the new law.  The law of love and forgiveness.<br>  <br>  A good example was the woman caught in the act.  They were going to stone her.  Jesus said, "He who has no sin, let him be the first to cast the stone."  He was teaching forgiveness.  This was his mission.<br>  <br>  I believe in forgiving, but if someone is threatening you or others, I believe in self defense.  Self defense laws do not allow a person to look for trouble.  Self defense laws do not allow hurting other people if you can avoid it.

"If a thief is caught breaking in and is struck so that he dies, the defender is not guilty of bloodshed; but if it happens after sunrise, he is guilty of bloodshed. A thief must certainly make restitution, but if he has nothing, he must be sold to pay for his theft.” <br>  So it seems that when a thief breaks into someone’s house at night and that person defends his home and slays the thief, God does not hold that death over the defender’s head. However, God does not wish for anyone to take law into his or her own hands. This is why it is said that if a thief is struck down during the daylight the defender is guilty of bloodshed. This discusses thievery not an attack. If the thief were to attack the defender even during the day, surely the man would be justified to defend himself. Maybe not as:<br>  <br>  Matt 5:39b-41 <br>  Do not resist an evil person. If someone strikes you <br>  on the right cheek, turn to him the other also. And if <br>  someone wants to sue you and take your tunic, let him <br>  have your cloak as well. If someone forces you to go <br>  one mile, go with him two miles. <br>  <br>  Matt 26:52b <br>  All who draw the sword will die by the sword. <br>  <br>  I would say: let your conscience be your guide, but that's just me talking!<br>  <br>  Polly

Die Wissenschaft führte in Europa dazu, das die Kirche ihren ursprünglichen Stellenwert verlor.<br>  <br>  Die Entwicklung im nahen und mittleren Osten verlief jedoch gegenl?ufig zur europ?ischen Entwicklung. So setzten die Muslimischen Religionsführer auf das Prinzip welches in Europa vorherrschte, der Unterdrückung und "Verdummung" der Menschen bzw. der Gesellschaft. Au?erdem hatten viele Kriegerische Auseinandersetzungen wie die Kreuzzüge, oder den Mongolensturm sowie zahlreiche andere Ereignisse dazu geführt, das die Muslime sich mehr auf die Kriegsführung konzentriert hatten als auf Ausbildung der Gesellschaft. Durch diese Ereignisse blieb auch die Industrialisierung aus, welches ein wichtiger Faktor für die entwicklung dieser Regionen gewesen w?re.|`|29aba8ab0437be6f883c0c8ae89d2d17aa	Im 14. Jahrhundert waren Muslims führend in Wissenschaft, Mathematik , Physik, Medizin usw. Das trotz Islam nicht wegen Islam.

Wegen Islam kam es zum Stillstand, w?hrend einige Jahrhunderte sp?ter, sich die Europ?er aus dem dunklen Zwang der Kirche l?sten.

Daher gibt es ein beherrschendes Gefühl der Schw?chung und Beeintr?chtigung in der heutigen islamischen Welt. Wie der Imam einer Moschee in Jerusalem vor nicht allzu langer Zeit sagte: ?Früher waren wir die Herren der Welt und jetzt sind wir nicht einmal die Herren unserer eigenen Moscheen."<br>  Auf der Suche nach Erkl?rungen für ihre missliche Lage haben die Muslime drei politische Antworten auf die Moderne ersonnen: S?kularismus, Reformismus und Islamismus.<br>  S?kularismus ist das Beispiel Türkei die aufruft vom Westen zu lernen.<br>  Die Reformer haben diese Art der Begründungen in allen Bereichen angewendet. Zum Beispiel machen sie geltend, dass die Muslime keine Vorbehalte gegenüber den Wissenschaften haben sollten, weil die Wissenschaften in Wirklichkeit muslimisch sind.<br>  Die dritte Antwort auf das moderne Trauma ist der Islamismus, Thema des Restes dieses Aufsatzes. Der Islamismus hat drei Hauptthemen: die Ergebenheit gegenüber dem heiligen Gesetz, die Ablehnung westlicher Einflüsse und die Umgestaltung des Glaubens in eine Ideologie. Der Islamismus ist der Ansicht, dass die Muslime hinter dem Westen herhinken, weil sie keine guten Muslime sind. Um den verlorenen Glanz wiederzugewinnen, muss zu den alten Wegen zurückgekehrt werden und das wird erreicht, indem man in voller übereinstimmung mit der Scharia lebt.|`|IGArzKTRaa	Führende M?chte kommen ung gehen .

Statt sich um Ausbildung zu kümmern, Schulen und Universit?ten zu bauen, haben sie lieber an ihrer Kriegskunst gefeilt, um diese Schmach auszubügeln.<br>  <br>  Nach der Eroberung Konstantinopels ging es nur noch bergab, Forschung interessierte keinen, nur die Beute - und die Zerst?rung einer uralten Kultur und all der dortigen Bibliotheken. <br>  <br>  Ein letztes Aufb?umen war der erfolglose Feldzug gegen Wien im 17. Jahrhundert. Wissenschaft und Streben nach Erkenntnissen  waren da schon l?ngst verkümmert, statt dessen verengte man den Horizont auf den Koran und brachten dem Nachwuchs bei, dass er weiter nichts ben?tigt.

Dieses enth?lt die Ethik des Buddhismus, die Beschreibung des menschlichen Leidens und seiner Erl?sung, des Lebens uns Sterbens, Leidenschaften, die geistige L?uterung des Praktizierenden, Ratschl?ge für die praktische Umsetzung der Lehre und manche Fabel.<br>  Darin enthalten sind auch die Vier Edlen Wahrheiten und der Edle Achtfache Pfad.<br>  Der Dharma ist Teil des Tripitaka (Sanskrit: drei K?rbe), neben der Gemeinschaft und die Buddhas.|`|fzbs5hLnaa	Es gibt die "vier edlen Wahrheiten"Buddhas.Durch diese erl?uterte Buddha seine grundlegende Lehre.Der Buddhismus lehrt den Weg der vollkommenen Rechtschaffenheit und Weisheit ohne einen pers?nlichen Gott, zur h?chsten Kentnis ohne eine Offenbarung.1.Alle Existenz ist von Leiden gekennzeichnet.2.Leiden entstehen aus einem Verlangen oder einer Gier.3. die Aufhebung der Gier hebt das Leiden auf.4.Der weg zur Aufhebung des Leidens ist der achtfache Pfad durch den das Verhalten, das Denken und das Glauben geregelt wird.|`|c38976723ee9b37f5c90f3768d12be59aa	nein<br>  die bibel und der buddismus sind gegensaetzlich.|`|Bi4OCxHKaa	Den Pali-Kanon, benannt nach der Sprache, in der er geschrieben ist, auch Tri Pitaka (Drei K?rbe) genannt.<br>  <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pali-Kanon" rel="nofollow">http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pali-Kanon</a><br>  <a href="http://religion.orf.at/projekt03/religionen/buddhismus/buddhismus_schriften_fr.htm" rel="nofollow">http://religion.orf.at/projekt03/religio...</a><br>  <br>  Aber der Buddhismus ist keine Buchreligion. Im Unterschied zu den heiligen Schriften der anderen Religionen geht der Pali-Kanon nicht auf eine himmlische Offenbarung zurück. Der Pali-Kanon ist die schriftliche Fixierung der bis dahin mündlich überlieferten Lehre des Buddhismus, niedergeschrieben im ersten Jahrhundert v. Chr. in Ceylon. "Pali" ist eine Sprache, die mit dem "Sanskrit" verwandt ist. Ungekl?rt ist die Frage, ob Buddha selbst in dieser Sprache gelehrt hat bzw. ob seine eigenen Worte im Pali-Kanon festgehalten sind.<br>  <br>  Der Pali-Kanon gliedert sich in drei Bereiche oder "K?rbe":<br>  -      der Korb der Ordensdisziplin ("Vinaya-Pitaka"), in dem die von Buddha selbst gegebenen Lebens- und Verhaltensregeln für die M?nche und Nonnen in seinem Orden,<br>  -      der Korb der Lehrreden des Buddha ("Sutta-Pitaka") – die Grundlage für die Geschichte seines Lebens und seiner Lehre, und<br>  -      der Korb der "h?heren Lehre" ("Abhidhamma-Pitaka"), in dem die Lehren des Buddha und seiner Hauptschüler analysiert, geordnet und systematisiert sind. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Die strikteste Buchreligion ist der Islam. Da ist das Buch selbst, der Qur'an, die Offenbarung aus der Ewigkeit.<br>  <br>  Bei evangelikalen, "biblizistischen" Christen ist es fast genau so (fast!). Aber das Christentum ist keine Buchreligion. Christen sehen in Jesus Christus die Offenbarung Gottes, nicht in den Bibelbüchern, wenn auch die Evangelien mit den Worten Jesu eine herausgehobene Bedeutung haben als Glaubenszeugnis, "Gottes Wort in Menschenmund".

iiza1H1Daa	Ja, der Buddhismus ist in der Tat eine sehr sympathische Religion, natürlich auch wegen des immer gut gelaunten Dalai Lamas, der zudem immer zu einem Sp??chen aufgelegt ist. Der Buddhismus glaubt eben im Gegensatz zu den meisten anderen Religionen nicht an G?tter, Engel und Teufel, sondern versucht die Menschen durch Meditation und überwindung ihrer Gier auf den Pfad der Erleuchtung zu führen.<br>  Vielleicht ist er gerade deshalb so erfolgreich, weil die Gier in unserer sp?tkapitalistischen Gesellschaft eine so gro?e Rolle spielt, und viele Menschen es leid sind, nur noch an den Erwerb von materiellen Werten zu denken.|`|xsRapxNNaa	das ist eie interressante Frage!<br>  ich denke dass die meisten menschen im Westen den Buddismus als Modetrend missbrauchen aber es gibt sicher auch Menschen die sich ernsthaft für diese faszinierende und inspirierende Religion interressieren. <br>  hierbei kann ich dir zwei Bücher empfehlen die meine Meinung zum Buddismus gepr?gt haben: <br>  "Sieben Jahre in Tibet" von Heinrich Harrer (in dem Buch geht es nicht nur um die bergsteigerischen und dramatischen Abenteuer sondern auch um die Tibetische Kultur) <br>  "Wolkenkind" von Soname Yangchen (die Autorin, selbs Buddistin und Tibeterin, beschreibt nicht nur ihr Leben unter der Chinesischen Herrschaft und mit ihrer Religion - sie spürte n?mlich die Anziehungskraft des Dalai Lama - sondern auch über ihre Erfahrungen mit der westlichen Welt)<br>  hoffe dir geholfen zu haben!<br>  mfg <br>  Liz|`|c38976723ee9b37f5c90f3768d12be59aa	Vormarsch des Buddhismus im Westen?<br>  nein<br>  das war vor 10 jahren.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Wie kommentiert ihr die schon lang anhaltende Begeisterung für den Buddhismus im Westen?<br>  <br>  sie nimmt wieder ab wie eine modewelle.<br>  <br>   Ist es nur eine Mode-Erscheinung? <br>  <br>  leider ja..<br>  <br>  <br>  Oder suchen die Europ?er ernsthaft nach neuen Werten? <br>  leider nicht.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Und welche Rolle spielt dabei der Dalai Lama, den ja kürzlich in Deutschland die Massen umfingen?<br>  <br>  <br>  das ist leider nur ein event.|`|NHRC7diuaa	Schau dir unsere verweltlichten und politisch orientierten Kirchen an - da hast du die Erkl?rung.|`|1db46cb82d818332483b2535b36c0210aa	Wenn überhaupt dann Buddhismus - es ist eine Religion welche von Allen den wenigsten Schaden anrichtet und angerichtet hat.|`|Bi4OCxHKaa	Die Sympathie für den Buddhismus h?ngt sich auch mit dem Dalai Lama zusammen, obwohl der immer davor gewarnt hat: Buddhismus sei nichts für unsere westliche Kultur. <br>  Das stimmt auch sicher für den tibetanischen Vayrayana-Buddhismus, den er vertritt.<br>  Aber die abgemilderten Formen von buddhistischen Meditationsübungen und ?hnlichem, die hier jetzt en vogue sind, sind nicht gegen die bestehenden Religionen gerichtet, sondern eher eine übung, die hilft, dass Atheisten und Religionslosen nicht alles Spirituelle abhanden kommt.<br>  <br>  Ich l?chle schon wie ein Buddha, wenn ich lese, dass Buddhismus mit "Vormarsch" kommentiert wird ... :-)<br>  Buddhisten jeglicher Art sind so was von unmilit?risch.|`|de8b7d71ff0a0e1e896c6bd7556dda06aa	Ich denke es ist eine Mode-Erscheinung .Der Buddhismus ist eine Lehre und keine Religion.

rSWXqFkxaa	Some points that Ido changed were possibly a slight improvement, but most in my opinion were totally unnecessary and even made the language worse.<br>  <br>  Specifically:<br>  <br>  The spelling reform has marginal benefits and marginal costs. Ido words are often not as visually recognizable internationally as Esperanto ones because of the different spelling, and the Esperanto accented letters in general do not pose any problem.<br>  <br>  The vocabulary thing is silly. Ido basically just copied French vocabulary (I believe that 93% of Ido's vocabulary is French derived.) I personally slightly prefer the fact that Esperanto has a wider variety of source languages, but ultimately the whole thing is pretty unimportant.<br>  <br>  Ido uses irregular correlatives (table words), taken from national languages, whereas in Esperanto there is a consistent and regular pattern. Studies have shown that Esperanto's system is easier to learn.<br>  <br>  Ido replaces most common words formed by prefixing mal- (meaning opposite) in Esperanto with single roots. This is not a good idea. First, it greatly increases the learning burden. Second, the mal- prefix in Esperanto is one of the greatly distinguishing features of the language, and the fact that it is so common even in very basic words means that every Esperanto speaker finds words formed with mal- to be normal and easily understandable. Esperanto speakers always have the word for the opposite of the concept they are talking about right on the tip of their tongue, and it's as natural as any concept they use.<br>  <br>  Ido has the absolutely WORST solution to the accusative: making it optional. Since Ido users normally don't use the accusative, they are highly likely to forget that it's necessary in the few cases it is. I think that Esperanto's solution is best, because when dealing with speakers from many diverse linguistic backgrounds, explicitly marking the accusative helps to avoid confusion where people may not even be aware that it could exist.<br>  <br>  I think that getting rid of number agreement on adjectives was also a mistake on Ido's part. In almost all languages, adjectives agree with their nouns in the inflections that the nouns do take. (In some languages, nouns don't inflect, in which case the adjectives don't either, of course.) English is unusual in this respect. This is also a matter of making communication clearer between speakers of different native languages in cases where there could be confusion without the speaker even realizing it.<br>  <br>  Ido changed the plural from adding -j to a noun (or adjective in Esperanto) to replacing the -o of the noun with -i. Thus the noun ending becomes a bit more inflectional in Ido, instead of completely agglutinative as it is in Esperanto. In Esperanto, -o always means noun, and -j always means plural, and their forms don't change. In Ido, -o means singular noun, and -i meansn plural noun, and there's no single part that can be cut out of that to refer just to nouns or just to singular or plural. It's a small point, but it seems to me to be a rather unnecessary change.<br>  <br>  Ido's system of derivation is overprecise. In Ido you constantly have to think whether you can directly derive a word, or whether strict logic requires that you use a suffix. Esperanto is less technically "logical", but is much more natural, and forms its words basically how humans tend to think.<br>  <br>  One good thing about Ido is how it made indication of sex on nouns symmetric between masculine and feminine. However, I think it's a small point, and the way Esperanto works is not so bad.<br>  <br>  Finally, Esperanto has a relatively large speech community, whereas Ido is minuscule. I think that Esperanto on balance is a better language, but even if you think that Ido is a slight improvement, it is hard to see how the small difference can justify uprooting the large Esperanto community and starting over with Ido.|`|yfCmRsawaa	I like the way Ido "smooths out" the rough edges of the sound of Esperanto speech. But this is a matter of personal preference. It's probably much more important to stick with what is has worked on an international level for many decades.<br>  <br>  What I don't like is the way many Ido words that are different from the Esperanto ones have an extra syllable in them. They may sound more international but using an extra syllable in everyday speech is more tedious & not really an improvement at all.

De todos modos se fué apartando y el pecado hizo mella en la raza humana. Es decir que en vez de evoucionar, involucionó. La gran mayoría se apartó del Bien, recuerda que el diluvio fué a raiz de la gran maldad que habia en la tierra, pero la biblia se refiere a esa raza antidiluviana como grandes hombres hablando de sus grandes atributos. A lo largo de la historia antigua los pueblos de toda la tierra recibieros evidencias mas que suficientes de quien era Dios y lo respetaban, aunque muchos no lo aceptaban como salvador. Preferian poner su confianza en seres inanimados. Hay muchas historias que hacen referencia. Pero tenian gran luz de conocimientos religiosos mas que ahora porque los milagros de Dios eran grandes evidencias. <br>  Pero al no aceptarlo o alejarse, como el evangelio dice, Dios los entregó a pasiones vergonzosas, y recuerda que para Dios todo pecado es inmundo. Sin embargo siguió conservando talentos, como el intelecto que hizo posible grandes descubrimientos y a la vez un razonamiento puro que, guiados por un espíritu sincero, lo llevaría a él.<br>  La teoría de la evolución cuadra en pasiones impropias, desviamiento, confusión, o como quieras llamarlo.<br>  Nadie, ni siquiera el hombre mas antiguo, pensaba que podría descender del mono. Muchos se llamaban hijos de dioses, como los faraones, etc.<br>  En conclusión, los hombres de la antiguadad creian en algún dios, la evolución que terminó de gestarse en el siglo XX refleja los grandes esfuerzos del pecado por negar la existencia de Dios.|`|9e3c28a1823cd7f16928c90e52ae958baa	Te equivocas respecto a los primeros hombres. Los primeros hombres no son los que escribieron la biblia o los que tuvieron cualquier religión "X". Los primeros hombres NO TENIAN ninguna religión. La historia escrita tiene apenas unos 5000 a?os de antigüedad, mientras que los humanos, tal como somos hoy,  habitamos la tierra desde hace aproximadamente 1 millón de a?o, y los primeros primates antropomorfos, tienen alrededor de 4 millones de a?os. Así que 5000 a?os no son nada comparativamente con el tiempo de evolución. <br>  El hombre no comenzó por querer dar explicaciones a las cosas; comenzó por tener MIEDOS, que tampoco son originales del hombre, ya los tenían desde que no eran humanos. Miedo a los fenómenos naturales, a los animales, etc. Los miedos hicieron que nacieran los primeros seres divinos y poco a poco se transformaron en dioses y finalmente en religiones. <br>  Cuando aparecieron los primeron clanes, tribus, pueblos, culturas, etc. Ya habían pasado varios cientos de miles de a?os. Y efectivamente no eran ateos. <br>  El ateismo surge al comenzar a descubrir, que muchas cosas a las que se les daba un origen o explicación divina, tenían una explicación natural. Así se dejó de creer en dioses creadores.|`|L4IuLortaa	Los hombres inventaron a los dioses para tratar de explicar su existencia, y no traian informacion de la evolucion por la sencilla razon de que la evolucion tarda millones de a?os, y crear a un dios es proceso de unos minutos, esto provoco que cuando los hombres obtubieron conciencia, no conocieran nada de la evolucion, por favor, no digas tonterias, dios no existe y tu eres un loco religioso.<br>  <br>  Belzebu will free your soul|`|PWZzdJ6Qaa	Te equivocas de principio a fin. Para empezar, el hombre ha evolucionado, sí, y las religiones nacieron cuando el Homo Sapiens comenzó a sentir miedo por todo lo que no podía entender, empezando por el rayo, el fuego, la lluvia, etc. Es decir, a lo largo de la historia del hombre ha habido millones de religiones y millones de dioses, al igual que, hoy en día, hay cientos de miles de tipos de religiones en el mundo, aunque sólo unas pocas sean mayoritarias (islam, cristianismo, budismo, hinduísmo...) Es decir, que el Dios del que hablas es sólo uno más en los millones de dioses que han "poblado" la Tierra, por así decirlo. No cometas el error de creer que todos los hombres han compartido (o comparten) la creencia en un mismo Dios desde el principio de los tiempos.<br>  <br>  Por cierto, el ateísmo no es un "invento nuevo", como dices. Y la evolución tiene pruebas más que suficientes que la respaldan. Hasta la Iglesia Católica la ha aceptado como verdadera, considerando siempre a Dios como el principio creador detrás de todo. Por otra parte, la evolución es un concepto científico que surgió gracias a las investigaciones de Darwin. Según tu planteamiento, si la evolución fuese real, el hombre tendría que haberlo sabido desde siempre. Pero, siguiendo ese razonamiento, también tendría que haber sabido desde siempre todo lo que es el Universo, los misterios del cuerpo humano, etc. La ciencia nos desvela poco a poco los misterios que nos rodean.<br>  <br>  Edit: gracias por responder. Sin embargo, tu planteamiento es erróneo. Si tuvieses razón, el hombre hubiese sabido siempre que la Tierra era redonda, aunque no tuvieran pruebas científicas. Sabemos perfectamente que éste no era el caso. Es parecido para la circulación de la sangre, las órbitas planetarias en torno al Sol (y no en torno a la Tierra, como decían los antiguos), y un largo etc. Consideras que Dios es verdad porque la religión siempre ha estado presente a lo largo de la historia del hombre, pero muchos conocimientos científicos que hoy en día damos por sentados no han existido hasta hace relativamente poco. ?Entiendes el error de tu planteamiento?<br>  <br>  Por otra parte, la evolución no niega la existencia de Dios. Es simplemente un hecho científico. No sé en qué se enfrenta a vuestras creencias, a no ser que pretendáis que la Biblia debe leerse literalmente, y entonces, debes estar preparado a demostrarme la existencia de gigantes y dragones.

Zbn0TLeHaa	Untuk yang mo puasa, hal-hal seperti ini tidak menjadi masalah. Justru yang gak puasa yang bikin ribut, seperti memancing dari air keruh di dalam ember...<br>  <br>  Sekedar informasi buat yang tidak ikut puasa, penentuan awal puasa adalah dengan terlihatnya bulan sabit tanda awal bulan Ramadhan. Terlihat disini menurut orang NU adalah bisa terlihat dengan mata dari atas menara masjid, puncak gunung/bukit, dll. Sedang terlihat menurut orang Muhammadiyah tidak perlu nampak benar-benar, asalkan posisi bulan sudah diatas horizon menurut perhitungan atau pemantauan melalui satelit, berarti sudah sah, tak perlu benar-benar melihat, karena mata bisa saja tidak melihat karena tertutup atmosfir/awan/debu, dsb.<br>  Nah sekarang kaitannya dengan MUI, karena Indonesia ini dari sabang sampai merauke, pemerintah maunya kita merayakan lebaran sama-sama. (ini berkaitan dengan penetapan hari libur, dsb). Repotnya kalau posisi bulan ditengah-tengah, di Indonesia barat sudah terlihat, tetapi di Indonesia timur belum (misalnya). Maka bisa saja MUI menunda puasa satu hari lagi. Tetapi karena NU atau Muhammadiyah pentolannya ada di Indonesia barat, mereka mungkin saja memulai puasa lebih dulu. <br>  <br>  Buat seorang muslim, hal-hal seperti ini bukan hal yang mana yang benar atau salah. Semuanya benar. Yang salah tetap yang gak puasa. Setiap orang ingin menyempurnakan ibadah mereka sesuai dengan ilmu yang mereka miliki.  Bukan sekedar dogma berlandaskan Tuhan Maha Pengasih dan Penyayang. Bahkan Rasullulah melarang orang berpuasa 1 atau 2 hari menjelang (sebelum) Ramadhan jika masih ragu tentang awal Ramadhan. <br>  <br>  BTW, semua perbedaan tersebut adalah benar dengan mengharap ridho dari Allah, bukan untuk menonjolkan ego.|`|81497e1615b62f8b7721f0538598fbecaa	Itu mungkin hanya Islam di Indonesia, karena seperti di Arab,Pakistan,India, dll tidak seperti itu.|`|AYeHTfljaa	gw baru denger di radio neh barusan..<br>  wapres kita berkata 'jika amerika dan rusia sudah pernah mendarat di bulan, kita masi bingung posisi bulan dimana' mengkritik perdebatan yang terjadi tentang waktu puasa hihihi|`|6AVXujEiaa	Mereka terjebak oleh apa yang dinamakan yuridis formal.berangkat dari al-qur'an ayat 183 surat al baqarah."hai orang-orang yang beriman berpuasalah kamu...........dan hadist riwayat imam bukhari "barang siapa yang berpuasa pada bulan ramadhan...................<br>  kita sama dalam hal mengartikan yang namanya puasa wajib itu pada bulan ramadhan tetapi ukuran untuk menentukan awal puasa atau satu ramadhan ada dua pendekatan.<br>  -yang pertama dengan cara melihat hillal <br>  -yang kedua dengan cara hisab atau perhitungan ketika kita tidak dapat melihat hilal maka kita menggenabkan bulan sa'ban menjadi genap 30 hari .<br>  hal inilah yang sering menjadikan pertentangan diantara organisasi - organisasi islam yang ada di indonesia .<br>  walaupun ada yang memanyungi untuk menentukan satu ramadhan yang dipasilitasi oleh depag dan mui (tiem isbat) tetapi kadang keyakinan kelompok lebih mendominasi..... hal tersebut yangkadang sering menjadikan perbedaan menjadi semakin tajam .|`|WgU9Po7eaa	Kesalahpahaman dalam penafsiran... tak perlu terlalu dibesar2xkan...,, yang terpenting adalah keikhlasan dalam melaksanakannya....<br>  bukan ego yang berperan,, namun keyakinan yang selama ini dipegang yang berbeda,, hal yang wajar terjadi dimanapun...<br>  Memang benar Allah Maha Pengasih dan Maha Penyayang,, yang terpenting bukan Tanggal mulai dan Tanggal Akhir namun keikhlasan dalam melaksanakanNya...|`|Wq9oMTeOaa	kira saya dalam versi dan skala yang lain - ada perdebatan/ perpecahan dalam tubuh agama2 lain.

Mereka tidak pernah minta dilahirkan cacat, tapi takdir berkata bahwa mereka harus menjalani hidup di dunia dengan kecacatannya... Ada juga yang cacat karena musibah/kecelakaan, mereka juga tidak pernah meminta untuk menjadi cacat...<br>  Seharusnya pertanyaannya bukan bagaimana menghilangkan bibit2 cacat dan orang2 cacat, tapi sudahkah kita menghargai orang2 cacat? atau sudahkan ada kesetaraan antara orang cacat dan yang normal? <br>  Buktinya sampai dengan saat ini masih ada jurusan2 di universitas (bahkan universitas terkenal sekalipun) yang tidak  membolehkan penyandang cacat tubuh untuk menjadi mahasiswanya alasannya terkadang tidak masuk akal, seperti penyandang cacat dianggap tidak mampu mengambil larutan kimia dari lemari lab yang tinggi. <br>  Ada juga penyandang buta warna parsial yang dilarang masuk ke sekolah kemiliteran.. padahal buta warna parsial kan masih tetap bisa melihat warna, dan seluruh fisik lainnya sehat.....<br>  Cacat dan bibit cacat mungkin tidak bisa dihilangkan, tapi kita bisa melakukan berbagai cara agar penyandang cacat bisa mendapat perlakuan yang layak dan sewajarnya....

AA11957086	According to the 1983 Code of Canon Law, the rule for the universal Church during Lent is abstain on all Fridays (inside or outside of Lent) and to both fast and abstain on Ash Wednesday and Good Friday.<br>  <br>  Some traditional Catholics might follow the older pattern of fasting and abstinence during this time, which for the universal Church required:<br>  <br>  - Ash Wednesday, all Fridays, and all Saturdays: fasting and total abstinence. This means 3 meatless meals -- with the two smaller meals not equaling in size the main meal of the day -- and no snacking. <br>  <br>  - Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays (except Ash Wednesday), and Thursdays: fasting and partial abstinence from meat. This means three meals -- with the two smaller meals not equalling in size the main meal of the day -- and no snacking, but meat can be eaten at the principle meal.<br>  <br>  On those days of fasting an abstinence, meatless soup is traditional. Sundays, of course, are always free of fasting and abstinence; even in the heart of Lent, Sundays are about the glorious Resurrection. This pattern of fasting and abstinence ends after the Vigil Mass of Holy Saturday.|`|4ae37dae0665ce14bc4728f72f1a5764aa	Too many....enjoy what the gods have given you.

For Orthodox and Eastern-Rite Catholics, it is pretty strict.  No meat at-all; or only on Sunday or the weekend (depending on the sui juris Church).<br>  <br>  For Roman Catholics, no meat on Fridays, Ash Wednesday, or Good Friday.  On Ash Wednesday and Good Friday, only 1 full meal, and 2 snacks (which add-up to less than the amount of a full meal) are allowed.  Exceptions are allowed for those under 14; over 60, and those, like pregnant women with health reasons.  <br>  <br>  Ask your pastor for more details.|`|7CeGpna1aa	Do you think god cares?

In this usage, a theory is not necessarily based on facts; in other words, it is not required to be consistent with true descriptions of reality. True descriptions of reality are more reflectively understood as statements that would be true independently of what people think about them. In this usage, the word is synonymous with hypothesis.<br>  <br>  practical on the other hand is sth u do, sth u have to perform, to prove with actions...<br>  <br>  was tht really ur question?

ssZZeKbcaa	1) Hace X tiempo, estaba en el centro de la ciudad de México en un dia de Diciembre con mucha gente y había una bolita de personas que estaban "jugando" a eso de "dónde quedó la bolita", en fin, me dije a mi mismo, -Ah, vamos a ver cómo le roban a la gente-, así que me acerqué, y entre los apretones me quitaron $150 de mi bolsa izquierda y había sido una do?a de la bolita que estaba "jugando", total que me super encabroné (enojé) y estuve calculando cerca de un minuto que hacer hasta que se me ocurrió la estúpida idea que te voy a contar:<br>  <br>  El se?or que estaba barajeando la bolita tenía una rutina, revolvía las bolas y luego decía a alguien de los cómplices "dónde quedó?", total que sea que ganara o perdiera la casa (el se?or que revolvía las pelotas), el dinero siempre iba a parar al centro donde había una mesita improvisada con cajas de cartón y estaba ahí cerca de segundo y medio y lo agarraba quien le correspondía, total que en una de esas vi un billete de $200 y como no había billetes de $150 ps dije, nimodo, así que lo agarré y salí corriendo, la do?a que me había robado me agarró pero me safé por la fuerza que llevaba, me topé con una parede de gente que hasta hoy no sé como libré, di dos pasos y en eso escuché un "Agárrenlo, ratero!!!", entonces dije, Dios! qué loquera he hecho! si me agarran aquí ahora yo soy el ladrón y no importa lo que diga les robé aunque ellos me hayan robado y entre dimes y diretes o me linchan o a la carcel voy!! :S:S:S:S, total que dije, ni madres! primero que me alcancen. ví un caminito por donde pasar y pegué la carrera más rápida de mi vida, detrás de mi venían los ladrones reales y tuve que saltar un puesto ambulante para salir a una calle muy grande y transitada, y luego luego escuché los pasos tras de mí de que me venían persiguiendo, los carros en direcció opuesta y yo con la adrenalina a todo lo que daba, total. mientras seguía corriendo llegué a la conclusión de que si seguía corriendo o salia alguien de la banqueta y me daba un guamazo, o me agarraban o un policía haría algo, así que tenía que hacer algo y mi única salida fue cruzar la caye como de 5 carriles con carros que iban rapidísimo y muy juntos, lo logré sin que me mataran, me metí a la primer calle y jamás fui alcanzado otra vez.... <br>  <br>  2) Subí a una "extra?a" a mi carro para llevarla a un lugar que no sabía donde era... en fin... somos novios ahora y estamos muy muy pero muy enamorados, hasta hay planes de boda jajajaja<br>  <br>  3) en realidad hay tantas que no sé ni qué decirte, lo que si te digo es que si te las cuento todas, no me crees jajajaja<br>  <br>  Por algo dicen que estoy loco...|`|ZTqxR3F2aa	pus tire a mi perro del 3 piso de mi casa porque mi papa le hiba a pegar por mordiskeor su zapato<br>  <br>  y lo avente<br>  y el pobre se frakturo|`|tBNZvTP2aa	casarme con un loco, y eso que lo ame y creo que me amo... pero terminamos como los roses... vieron la guerra de los roses? el amor perdio, y pasamos al odio... odio de guerra en el cual casi nos matamos, hace a?os nos separamos y nos seguimos odiando...|`|X8rF9Ybvaa	acostarme con la prima de mi esposa <br>  <br>  no me la puedo quitar de ensima me arrepentire toda mi vida<br>  <br>  tanto que no lo vuelvo a hacer|`|uYqR7rrSaa	por ser la amyor locura que hasta ahora he hecho en vida es que no puedo contarte si te cuento tendria que silenciarte, asi que dejemoslo que siga siendo un secreto y yo seguire riendome sola de mi picardia...<br>  <br>  saludos, abrazos|`|xJvsSWQzaa	Creo que mi mayor locura esta por llegar aun, y espero que sea muy pronto!|`|zJYu9ccjaa	habrelo hecho en una trctomula mientras ella iba andando  y es exelente|`|nW45mZkHaa	No puedo decidirme entre estas:<br>  <br>  -Estando enormemente enamorado y en un momento de "crisis"; haber pagado un paquete de pa?uelos de 50 cent con un billete de 10 € y salir corriendo de la tienda diciendo que se quedaran el cambio.(Pero fue un momento de crisis feliz y los pa?uelos no eran para mi)<br>  <br>  <br>  -Entrar en una tienda con un casco de moto colocado al revés y comprar dos chicles.

Something from Comedy Central perhaps. I like to watch Whose Line Is It Anyway after I watch horror movies. Secondly, if you feel so bad about not being able to help the animals, I suggest actually trying to do something. Even if you just adopt one pet from a rescue shelter, you're helping. If you don't have the time or money for pets, perhaps you could donate your time or resources to a local animal shelter. Shelters are often looking for donations of certain dog foods, blankets, leashes, etc. Another thing you could do is donate money to a foundation dedicated to saving animals in need. This will help your conscience quite well, and its a wonderful cause. Might be something to consider.|`|o9HUldMIaa	Have a good drink and watch something fun and happy..like a comedy..and cuddle with your pets..distract yourself.|`|OiAle1soaa	I"m sorry, that's always horrible. It's happened to me before.  Talking about it openly like this is a good step. I wrote down every detail and then threw away the paper. Then I did alot of things that I like that took my mind off of it like reading and watching fun movies. Time will make it better, and if you're still upset, give to an animal charity or adopt a pet from a shelter or somthing of that sort. You'll do a little for the animals and it'll make you feel a lot better. Hope I helped. =]

She's been through so much, but some how, is still able to stand up and be strong, taking each emotional blow but not backing down. Her weight is just right, and she may be a bit shorter than I am. She's friendly and kind, artistic and a bit of a musician, who plays the bass and can sing. She's honest and funny; she can always make me laugh, and vice versa. She's someone who probably needs help with her problems, or at least someone to hear her out, and I can do that.

Bukan berarti Masehi itu adalah kalender Kristen.|`|Weygfswdaa	setahu saya, setiap kalender masehi adalah kalender untuk umum, bukan utk orang kristen aja. namun jika ditanyakan nama asal penanggalan saat ini kenapa kok pake kata Masehi, itu berasal dari patokan kelahiran Mesias (Yesus Kristus). benar sekali jika ada yg bilang  penanggalan itu di buat pada masa pemerintaah romawi, kan pemerintahan itu ada pada masa beberapa puluh tahun setelah kelahiran dan kematian Mesias.<br>  <br>  kalender sendiri, kalo kita mau bijak, sebenernya dah ada sejak zaman penciptaan, hanya saja tidak ada yang membuatnya dalam bentuk cetakan sekarang ini. Karena kalender itu tidak bisa lepas dengan waktu, maka sejak hari pertama Tuhan ciptakan ini dan itu, sejak itulah awal mulanya adanya kalender. dan saat itupun bisa dibilang beberapa ratus ato ribu tahun Sebelum Masehi. <br>  <br>  jadi, kata Masehi yang dipakai pada penanggalan saat ini, kelahiran MEsias-lah yang menjadi patokan. sehingga untuk tahun2 sebelum kelahiranNya, dipakailah kata "sebelum".

In your case, being in the closet and all is still okay, and you've got to understand that, BUT having homophobic friends isn't such a great idea at this point in yourlife, because somewhere along the line, you're gonna want to come out and be openly proud of who and what you are. Having homophobic friends may deter you from that and make you even more afraid of coming out than you already might be. Hanging out that kind of atmosphere would make ANYONE have second thoughts about coming out, because the number one reason most people are in the closet is because they fear rejection (I know that was my reason for the longest time). Having homophobic friends would dissuade you from coming out, because you don't want to be rejected by people you call friend; as opposed to having friends that AREN'T homophobes. Personally, I think you should stay away from the homophobe scene so you wont feel trapped by it... but it's all up to you sweetie.

The thing is, even if you're not out and they don't direct their negative comments towards you in particular, they will still hurt you, sweetie.  It’s never good for you to hang around kids who (even unknowingly) insult you and your lifestyle.  You can get paranoid because each time they say something you worry if you have let anything slip or show.  You should never worry about showing such a huge part of your self to a friend.  What I would suggest is you start right now just looking around for people that are gay friendly.  Maybe look for an affirmations youth group or GSA (gay strait alliance) in your school (or if you don't want to join the one at your school, find one that's local and more confidential).  Ask your school counselor or school psychiatrist if you need help finding somewhere; they're not allowed to talk about what you tell them so you should be okay talking with them.  Start maybe telling your friends that you don't think it's right for them to discriminate.  Even if they're like that, they're still your friends.  Hopefully they'll listen and realize you are uncomfortable with dissing people because of their lifestyle.  Just because you are in the closet doesn't mean that you have to stay quite about stuff like that.  You can be accepting and still be strait.  <br>  <br>  Once you feel you have some good friends that you feel would be supportive of you, then you should start thinking about opening up with a few of them.  Eventually you may start feeling more comfortable with it and tell your homophobic friends and hope for the best.  They are your friends; they might even surprise you.  Some people just act homophobic because they feel it's un-manly to be supportive of it.  It's harder to do that when someone your close to becomes part of the faceless group they are dissing now.  I wish you the best of luck hon, and I hope that your friends someday learn to accept people as they are.|`|AA11371919	If you keep hanging around them, it's gonna hurt like hell when they make gay jokes.

I think WE would know if we are opressed or not. <br>  <br>  Human Rights<br>  Islam, fourteen centuries ago, made women equally accountable to God in glorifying and worshipping Him – setting no limits on her moral progress.  Also, Islam established a woman’s equality in her humanity with men.  In the Quran, in the first verse of the chapter entitled “Women”, God says:<br>  <br>  “O mankind!  Be careful of your duty toward your Lord who created you from a single soul and from it its mate and from them both have spread abroad a multitude of men and women.  Be careful of your duty toward God in Whom you claim (your rights) of one another, and towards the wombs (that bore you).  Lo!  God has been a Watcher over you.” (Quran 4:1)<br>  <br>  Since men and women both came from the same essence, they are equal in their humanity.  Women cannot be by nature evil (as some religions believe) or then men would be evil also.  Similarly, neither gender can be superior because it would be a contradiction to equality.<br>  <br>  Civil Rights<br>  In Islam, a woman has the basic freedoms of choice and expression based on recognition of her individual personality.  First, she is free to choose her religion.  The Quran states:<br>  <br>  “There is no compulsion in religion.  Right has been made distinct from error.” (Quran 2:256)<br>  <br>  Women are encouraged in Islam to contribute their opinions and ideas.  There are many traditions of the Prophet which indicate that women would pose questions directly to him and offer their opinions concerning religion, economics and social matters.<br>  <br>  A Muslim woman has full right to approve or deny a proposal of marriage, and her name is to be kept after marriage.  A Muslim woman’s testimony is valid in legal disputes.  In fact, where women are more familiar, their evidence is conclusive.<br>  <br>  Social Rights<br>  The Prophet said:<br>  <br>  “Seeking knowledge is a mandate for every Muslim (male and female).” (At-Tirmidhi)<br>  <br>  This includes knowledge of the Quran and the Hadeeth as well as other types of knowledge.  Men and women both have the capacity for learning and understanding.  Since it is also their obligation to promote good behavior and condemn bad behavior in all spheres of life, Muslim women must acquire the appropriate education to perform this duty in accordance with their own natural talents and interests.<br>  <br>  While bearing, raising and the teaching of children, and providing support to her husband and maintenance of a home are among the first, and very highly regarded, roles for a woman, if she has the skills to work outside the home for the good of the community, she may do, so as long as her family obligations are met.<br>  <br>  Islam recognizes and fosters the natural differences between men and women despite their equality.  Some types of work are more suitable for men and other types for women.  This in no way diminishes either’s efforts or benefits.  God will reward both sexes equally for the value of their work, through, it may not necessarily be the same activity.<br>  <br>  Concerning motherhood, the Prophet said:<br>  <br>  “Heaven lies under her feet.” (An-Nasai)<br>  <br>  This implies that the success of a society can be traced to the mothers who raised it.  The first and greatest influence on a person comes from the sense of security, affection, and training received from the mother.  Therefore, a woman having children must be educated and conscientious in order to be a skillful parent.<br>  <br>  Political Rights<br>  A right given to Muslim women by God 1400 years ago is the right to vote.  On any public matter, a woman may voice her opinion and participate in politics.  One example, as narrated in the Quran (60:12), where Muhammad is told that when the believing women come to him and swear their allegiance to Islam, he must accept their oath.  This established the right of women to select their leader and publicly declare so.  Finally, Islam does not forbid a woman from holding important positions in government which suit her role as a woman.  Abdurrahman Ibn Affan consulted many women before he recommended Uthman Ibn Affan to be the Caliph.<br>  <br>  Economic Rights<br>  The Quran states:<br>  <br>  “By the creation of the male and female; Verily, (the ends) you strive for are diverse.” (Quran 92:3-4)<br>  <br>  In these verses, God declares that He created men and women to be different, with unique roles, functions and skills.  As in society, where there is a division of labor, so too in a family, each member has different responsibilities.  Generally, Islam upholds that women are entrusted with the nurturing role, and men, with the guardian role.  Therefore, women are given the right of financial support.<br>  <br>  The Quran states: <br>  <br>  “Men are the maintainers of women because God has made some of them to excel others and because they spend of their wealth (for the support of women).” (Quran 4:34)<br>  <br>  This guardianship and greater financial responsibility given to men requires that they provide women with not only monetary support but also physical protection and kind respectful treatment.<br>  <br>  Muslim women have the privilege to earn money, the right to own property, to enter into legal contracts and to manage all of her assets in any way she pleases.  She can run her own business and no one has any claim on her earnings, including her husband.<br>  <br>  The Quran states:<br>  <br>  “And in no wise covet those things in which God hath bestowed His gifts more freely on some of you than on others; to men is allotted what they earn, and to women, what they earn; but ask God of His bounty for God hath full knowledge of all things.” (Quran 4:32)<br>  <br>  A woman inherits from her relatives.  The Quran states:<br>  <br>  “For men there is a share in what parents and relatives leave, and for women there is a share of what parents and relatives leave, whether it be little or much – an ordained share.” (Quran 4:7)|`|hQgUSAsoaa	to each his own its like the bible they focus on the good and ignore the bad|`|QXLpUrFGaa	Women Treatment in Islam<br>  <br>  We receive many questions about the treatment of women in Islam in general and what Muslim men do with their wives in particular. The following should help to shed some light on this most important subject.<br>  <br>  Question: <br>  <br>  I have a question about the treatement of the women in Islam. Could you please tell us why the Quran tells men to "beat them" meaning their wives? (chapter 4, verse 34)<br>  <br>  Answer:<br>  <br>  Thank you for asking about Islam. It is our committment to try our best to provide answers to questions to the best of our ability. However, sometimes we come across questions for which we do not have answers. In this case we will refer you to others who may be able to provide you with proper answers.<br>  <br>  First of all please be aware that we as Muslims, must never lie about anything, especially our religion.<br>  <br>  Secondly, we do have the original text of the Quran and the preserved teachings of Muhammad, peace be upon him. This enables us to verify exactly what was said, intended and taught by Muhammad, peace be upon him, as being the religion of Islam.<br>  <br>  Third, I would like to remind myself and all who read this in the future that not all questions are purely questions. Some contain statements and implications, that may or may not be true.<br>  <br>  Finally, it is important to keep in mind anytime we discover something in the answers to actually be better than what we already have, we should be committed to change our position and accept that which is true over that which is false and take that which is better for that which is inferior.<br>  <br>  After taking all of the above into consideration, if we find that the answer to this question provides us with a better approach to understanding what Almighty God has provided us with as a way of life on this earth and in the Next Life, we should then make the logical decsion to begin to worship Him on His terms.<br>  <br>  Having said that, let us now look to the particular verse in question in the original text (Arabic), followed by the phonetic sounds in Latin letters and then finally, followed by a translation of the meaning to the English language by experts in both Arabic and in Quranic meanings.<br>   <br>   <br>  Transliteration<br>  Ar-rejalu qawwa muna 'alan-nisa'a bima fadhdhallahu ba'dhahum 'ala bi'dhi wa bima anfaqu min amwalihim. Fas-saliHatu qaintat HafaTHatul-lilghaybi bimaa HafiTHal-lahu, wal-lati takhaafuna nushuza hunna fa'iTHuu hunnaa wa hjuruu hunna fiil-lmadhaa ji'i wadhribu hunna. Faa'in aTa'nakum flaa tabghuu 'alayhinna sabiilan. Innal-laha kaana 'aliyaan kabiira(n). <br>  Explanation (tafsir) of Sura 4:34<br>  “Men are the support of women as God gives some more means than others, and because they spend of their wealth (to provide for them). So women who are virtuous are obedient to God and guard the hidden as God has guarded it. As for women you feel are averse, talk to them suasively; then leave them alone in bed (without molesting them) and go to bed with them (when they are willing). If they open out to you, do not seek an excuse for blaming them. Surely God is sublime and great.”<br>  <br>  Meaning of the Words<br>  For the three words fa'izu, wahjaru, and wadribu in the original, translated here 'talk to them suasively,' 'leave them alone (in bed - fi'l-madage'),' and 'have intercourse', respectively, see Raghib Lisan al-'Arab and Zamakhsari. Raghib in his Al-Mufridat fi Gharib al-Qur'an gives the meanings of these words with special reference to this verse. Fa-'izu, he says, means to 'to talk to them so persuasively as to melt their hearts.' (See also v.63 of this Surah where it has been used in a similar sense.) <br>  <br>  Hajara - Wahjaru (do not touch or moleste them)<br>  Hajara, he says, means to separate body from body, and points out that the expression wahjaru hunna metaphorically means to refrain from touching or molesting them. Zamakhshari is more explicit in his Kshshaf when he says, 'do not get inside their blankets.' <br>  <br>  Daraba (to have intercourse, not to beat)<br>  Raghib points out that daraba metaphorically means to have intercourse, and quotes the expression: "Darab al-fahl an-naqah" - 'the stud camel covered the she-camel,' which is also quoted by Lisan al-'Arab.<br>  It cannot be taken here to mean 'to strike, hit or beat them (women).' This view is strengthened by the Prophet's authentic hadith found in a number of authorities, including Bukhari and Muslim: <br>  "Could any of you beat your wife as he would a slave, and then lie with her in the evening?" There are other traditions in Abu Da'ud, Nasa'i, Ibn Majah, Ahmad bin Hanbal and others, to the effect that he forbade the beating of any woman, saying: "Never beat God's handmaidens." <br>  <br>  Source:<br>  Al-Qur'an: a contemporary translation by Ahmed Ali, Princeton University Press, 1988; pp78-79<br>  <br>  In the past, some translators of this verse have mistakeningly used the word "beat" to represent the word "dhaaraba" in Arabic. This is not the opinion of all scholars especially Raghib and Zamakhshari as mentioned above and those who are well grounded in both Islam understanding and the English language.<br>  <br>  Quran: (Surah An-Nisaa' [The Women] 4:34)<br>  Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because Allah has made one of them to excel the other, and because they spend (to support them) from their means. Therefore the righteous women are devoutly obedient (to Allah and to their husbands), and guard in the husband's absence what Allah orders them to guard (e.g. their chastity, their husband's property, etc.). As to those women on whose part you see ill-conduct, admonish them (first), (next), refuse to share their beds, (and last) beat them (lightly, if it is useful), but if they return to obedience, seek not against them means (of annoyance). Surely, Allah is Ever Most High, Most Great.<br>  <br>  We understand from this some of the translations are not properly representing the spirit of the meaning. Therefore, they cannot be considered to be the representation of what has been intended by Almighty God.<br>  <br>  Now we can properly understand that Almighty God has commanded the men to provide for the women and allow them to keep all of their wealth, inheritance and income without demanding anything from them for support and maintenance. Additionally, if she should be guilty of lewd or indecent conduct, the husband is told to first, admonish her and then she should cease this lewdness. However, if she should continue in this indecency, then he should no longer share the bed with her, and this would continue for a period of time. Finally, if she would repent then he would take up sharing the bed with her again.<br>  <br>  Dr. Jamal Badawi (St. Mary's University, Nova Scotia) is of the opinion these (three stages) are necessary steps prior to divorce. Instead of a man saying, "I divorce you" three times in a row, he should follow this procedure before acting hastily and thereby doing something unwise and displeasing to Allah. The first step would be as mentioned above, to give her a "good talking to" and then if she continued in such unpleasing behavior, to leave the bed (not have intercourse with her) for a period of time and then finally, the last straw would be to "tap" her on the arm with a "tooth stick" or something of this size and nature to signify to her this is the final straw and then if she still persisted in her bad way, he could divorce her.<br>  <br>  Regardless of the various positions and opinions, there is no permission establish through the teachings of the Quran or the Sunnah (way) of Muhammad, peace be upon him, wherein one person could "beat" another person.<br>  <br>  And Allah is All Knowing of the meanings.|`|R0sd5oubaa	What a trick, only part lines of that verse has been shown as translations, and also read the verse in full below:<br>  <br>  Also the word beating is translated word of Arabic, See my foot notes below : On the basis of these Traditions, all the authorities stress that this "beating", if resorted to at all, should be more or less symbolic - "with a toothbrush, or some such thing or even with a folded handkerchief<br>  <br>  The complete translation of 4:34 is :<br>  <br>  4:34 Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because Allah has given the one more (strength) than the other, and because they support them from their means. Therefore the righteous women are devoutly obedient, and guard in (the husband's) absence what Allah would have them guard. As to those women on whose part ye fear disloyalty and ill-conduct, admonish them (first), (Next), refuse to share their beds, (And last) beat them (lightly)**; but if they return to obedience, seek not against them Means (of annoyance): For Allah is Most High, great (above you all). <br>  <br>  **<br>  It is evident from many authentic Traditions that the Prophet himself intensely detested the idea of beating one's wife, and said on more than one occasion, "Could any of you beat his wife as he would beat a slave, and then lie with her in the evening?" (Bukhari and Muslim). According to another Tradition, he forbade the beating of any woman with the words, "Never beat God's handmaidens" (Abu Da’ud, Nasa’i, Ibn Majah, Ahmad ibn Hanbal, Ibn Hibban and Hakim, on the authority of Iyas ibn ‘Abd Allah; Ibn Hibban, on the authority of ‘Abd Allah ibn ‘Abbas; and Bayhaqi, on the authority of Umm Kulthum). When the above Qur’an-verse authorizing the beating of a refractory wife was revealed, the Prophet is reported to have said: "I wanted one thing, but God has willed another thing - and what God has willed must be best" (see Manar V, 74). With all this, he stipulated in his sermon on the occasion of the Farewell Pilgrimage, shortly before his death, that beating should be resorted to only if the wife "has become guilty, in an obvious manner, of immoral conduct", and that it should be done "in such a way as not to cause pain (ghayr mubarrih)"; authentic Traditions to this effect are found in Muslim, Tirmidhi, Abu Da'ud, Nasa'i and Ibn Majah. On the basis of these Traditions, all the authorities stress that this "beating", if resorted to at all, should be more or less symbolic - "with a toothbrush, or some such thing" (Tabari, quoting the views of scholars of the earliest times), or even "with a folded handkerchief" (Razi); and some of the greatest Muslim scholars (e.g., Ash-Shafi’i) are of the opinion that it is just barely permissible, and should preferably be avoided: and they justify this opinion by the Prophet's personal feelings with regard to this problem.(Quran Ref: 4:34 ) <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  There is no problem to understand if you see the two verses, I dont know what the questioners want to proove:<br>  <br>  47:33 <br>  <br>  O you who have attained to faith!

Yet if they repent, and take to prayer, and render the purifying dues, let them go their way: for, behold, God is much forgiving, a dispenser of grace.  <br>  <br>  <br>  9:6 And if any of those who ascribe divinity to aught beside God seeks thy protection, grant him protection, so that he might [be able to] hear the word of God [from thee]; and thereupon convey him to a place where he can feel secure:  this, because they [may be] people who [sin only because they] do not know [the truth]. <br>  <br>  ===============================<br>  <br>  Allah knows the best.|`|caen2K64aa	As-Salaamu Alaikum, MoonLit Muslima!<br>  <br>  You are very much on point.

Tell him pantyhose get runs and it's expensive to replace them all the time, so he can buy his own if he wants to wear them.|`|AA10109926	My dear,there is no middle ground to be had.If you find one,it only means that you are in a crossfire.<br>  The Holy Bible is dead set against that very thing and it is addressed in Deuteronomy.<br>  Condoning this in your husband will only bring you pain.<br>  <br>  Deuteronomy 22:5 (New International Version)<br>  5 A woman must not wear men's clothing, nor a man wear women's clothing, for the LORD your God detests anyone who does this.<br>  <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=5&chapter=22&verse=5&version=31&context=verse" rel="nofollow">http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?boo...</a><br>  <br>  That is a stark and clear order for mankind.You will regret it if you ignore it.|`|OOHSCZ5Aaa	Hopefully he's just being a jokester about it and doesn't really want to wear your pantyhose.

Unless of course you don't think it's weird in which case by all means buy him a couple packs and let him have a field day.

It's when he starts wearing them outside the house, even concealed, that there could start to be problems.<br>  <br>  And to the bible thumper- nobody's asking what the bible says about men wearing pantyhose.  It's a supreme work of fiction anyhow.

S51x5vK3aa	Naja, ich misch mich da mal ein, obwohl ich mich mit Mo und Atlantis zu wenig auskenne. Aber Hebra:isch und andere semitische Sprachen sind sich ziemlich ?hnlich (Arama:isch, Koptisch, Arabisch...), es unterscheidet sie nur einige Lautverschiebungen und historische Kontexte.<br>  Auch die Verwandtschaft des Griechischen mit anderen indogermanischen Sprachen ist kaum zu leugnen. Vor allem das altindische Sanskrit und das Altgriechische sind sich zum verwechseln a:hnlich: Vater = grch. patér, skr. patr′ oder Schaf = grch. pecós, skr. pecu usw. Auch grammatisch mit Aorist, 8 Fa:llen, synthetische Satzbildung usw.<br>  <br>  Ich wu:rde auf der Suche nach den zwei Zivilisationen eher nach Etruskern tendieren. Sie haben eine Sprache, die bis heute keine nachweisbaren Verwandte hat. Eine Mo:glichkeit wa:re ho:chstens das Baskische (bask. euskara ~ lat. etrusca). Ihre Kultur und ihre Folklore liegen zum Gro3teil noch im Dunkeln. Als ich in Rom das Etruskische Museum besuchte, war mir ganz mulmig zumute. Ihre Bildnisse hatten ganz seltsame Gesichter und stellten unheimlich Szenen dar. Ihre Schrift a:hnelt keiner der bekannten und wurde erst vor einigen Jahren entziffert. Und Poseidon war der erste Gott, den die Etrusker von den Griechen u:bernahmen, so weit die Quellen zuru:ckreichen. Ich wu:rde mich mal dort umschauen.<br>  <br>  @Alfred I: Farsi ist indogermanisch/indo-arisch und Türkisch ist altaiisch (nach dem Altai-Gebirge in der Mongolei).|`|SRXS6Qocaa	Was hat die griechische oder die hebr?ische Sprache mit dem Mythos Atlantis zu tun? Die hebr?ische Sprache stammt aus dem semitischen Sprachstamm, das griechische dem indogermanischen Sprachstamm an. Atlantis ist ein Mythos, der von einer überlegenen Zivilisation handelt, die durch die Rache der G?tter untergegangen ist. Für die Entstehungszeit dieses Mythoses eine übliche Geschichte zur Verh?rlichung der Macht der G?tter und zur Mahnung an die Tugend des Menschen. Das Gleiche steht in der Bibel oder Gilgameschepos zum Thema der Sinnflut. Beweise gibt es keine, aber viele verschiedene Erkl?rungen.|`|ad88945ecc5630cb5582a164a6a97501aa	Blablabla. Das Hebr?ische geh?rt zu den semitischen Sprachen, wie auch das Arabische, Türkische und  Iranische (Farsi). <br>  Griechisch ist eine Indogermanische Sprache, soviel ich in der Schule lernte.<br>  Der Mythos Atlantis ist wahrscheinlich nach der Vernichtung der Minoischen Kultur auf Kreta durch einen Riesentsunami ausgel?st durch den Vulkanausbruch auf Santorin zurückzuführen.

S51x5vK3aa	Das ist so, weil die deutsche Sprache aus vielen Mundarten besteht (z.B. Bairisch, S?chsisch, Alemannisch usw.), die vor tausenden Jahren eigene Sprachen waren. Alle Mundarten sind in drei gro?e Gruppen einzuteilen: Oberdeutsch, Mitteldeutsch und Niederdeutsch. Ich komme zum Beispiel aus Süd-Tirol, das liegt auf der Landkarte in Norditalien. Wenn ich nach ?sterreich, Bayern oder in manchen Orten der Schweiz fahre, versteht man meinen Dialekt und ich verstehe den der anderen. Wenn ich aber nach Berlin oder Hamburg fahre versuche ich Hochdeutsch zu sprechen. Das ist aber auch nicht immer eine gute L?sung, wie du sagst, weil es sogar Unterschiede in der Grammatik gibt. Aber ich wei? circa, wie man in Norddeutschland spricht und ich versuche so zu klingen wie die Leute dort.

S51x5vK3aa	Zuerst zu ? und ?: Die Beispiele die du aufgez?hlt hast kamen über das Franz?sische ins Deutsche. Man behielt also die ursprüngliche Schreibung bei. Mit der Zeit ver?nderte sich die Aussprache der W?rter (zuerst aka-zieh), aber die Schreibung blieb gleich (das Englische hat damit erheblich zu k?mpfen). <br>  <br>  Das Problem mit den zusammengesetzten W?rtern haben alle synthetisch-flektierenden Sprachen. Im Englischen ist das Affix be- schon im 16. Jh. abgefallen und ist jetzt nur mehr dort gel?ufig, wo eine Bewirkung oder ein Seins-Zustand angezeigt werden soll (before = be [sein] + fore [vorne] = vorne seinend, oder beget = be [i.d.F. machen] + get [erhalten] = etwas zu Erhaltendes machen = zeugen). Nach neuer Rechtschreibung müsste man so und anders "bein-" von "halten" trennen. Ansonsten, wenn es substantivisch ist, wird es ja zur Erkennung gro? geschrieben (das Bein-Halten).<br>  <br>  Dass in W?rtern oft "sch" und "sp" usw. nicht klar hervortreten, hast du vollkommen recht. Die neue deutsche Rechtschreibung bemüht sich deshalb auch um eine neue Trennstrich-Regelungen bei krassen F?llen.<br>  <br>  Das mit dem "auSSehen" ist auch ein unl?sbares Problem in der deutschen Sprache. Deutsch benützt nun mal Pr?positionen und nicht worteigene Postpositionen (das Englische macht daraus "get UP" anstatt "AUFstehen). Und andere F?lle wie "WelthilfSSprache" k?nnen insofern auch nicht gel?st werden, weil es des Genitiv-Eses bedarf. Man kann es aber auch in vielen F?llen weglassen: "WelthilfSprache"oder "RechtStaat".<br>  <br>  Das "s"-"z:"-Problem hat auch seinen Ursprung in der Geschichte. Weil Hochdeutsch, wie das Wort eben sagt, alle oberdeutschen Umgangssprachen (von Frankfurt bis Bozen) umfasst, hat es auch seine Macken blindlings aufgenommen. Im Oberdeutschen unterscheidet man nur seltenst zwischen "s" und "z:".<br>  <br>  Du fragst, warum man solche Sachen nicht einführt? Die Leute sind schon so eingeschnappt mit den marginalen ?nderungen der neuen deutschen Rechtschreibung, die durchgeführt wurden. Solche radikalen ?nderung würde die Leute dazu bewegen, wieder zur alten Rechtschreibung zurückzukehren, was ich ihnen auch nicht verübeln würde.<br>  <br>  Viele Grü?e!|`|4sJdhCD2aa	ist die deutsche Sprache nicht schon kompliziert genug. warum neue bl?de, von dir vorgeschlagene aussprachen einführen.<br>  wei?t du wie hart es ist für einen Ausl?nder die deutsche Sprache zu erlernen. die haben schon Probleme mit der, die und das.|`|YA2QEySCaa	interessante frage, <br>  aber lass mal gut sein mit den ?nderungen, <br>  das volk würde doch sofort wieder auf die barikaden, und unsere politiker k?nnten sich wahrscheinlich auch nicht recht entscheiden, die gerichte w?ren besch?ftigt etc...<br>  für "sch" gibt es im türkischen einen sch?nen buchstaben, "?", für "tsch" w?re da "?", aber solche reformen, so sinnvoll sie auch sein k?nnten, gehen halt nicht mal auf zwang!<br>  ausserdem ist doch dies das sch?ne an den verschiedenen sprachen, dass sie eben ihre kleinen, aber feinen unterschiede haben.<br>  als muttersprachler w?chst man in diese unterschiede ohne viel zu hinterfragen hinein, für ausl?nder, welche unsere sprache erlernen wollen, sieht dies schon anders aus, aber andersherum ist es wohl genauso.|`|psRNBugNaa	Die DEUTSCHE Sprache sollen DEUTSCHE sprechen, lesen, schreiben und verstehen.<br>  <br>  Im Gegenzug m?chte ich dann aber auch, dass alle anderen L?nder. die typisch deutschen Umlaute (?, ?, ü und das ?) in ihre Sprache mit aufnehmen.<br>  <br>  Unsere Freunde die Türken hübün jü schün düs ü ün ührer Sprüüche. :-)|`|b457f56ed500ffe24a26658642ea691aaa	Eine sehr sch?ne Frage - schade, dass manche sich damit nicht ernsthaft auseinandersetzen.<br>  <br>  Die Antwort muss aber mehrgeteilt werden:<br>  - warum ist das so (historische Entwicklung)<br>  - wer soll die ?nderungen festlegen<br>  - wie wird die Akzeptanz sein<br>  - wie lange wird die Umsetzung dauern<br>  - welche Verwirrung wird eine neue Schreibweise verursachen<br>  <br>  Und wahrscheinlich noch ein paar Fragen mehr - ohne dass wir eine einzige neue Regel aufgestellt h?tten!<br>  <br>  Mein Lieblingsbeispiel für den Wunsch nach zus?tzlichen Schreibweisen ist das Wort "Hochzeit". Sollten wir für die Bedeutung Blütezeit nun "Hoochzeit" oder doch lieber "Hohchzeit" schreiben? Handlungsbedarf besteht da durchaus.<br>  <br>  In jedem Fall aber bin ich gegen das Einsetzen neuer Schriftzeichen (Aktzente, Tilts, ...)<br>  Mal ganz abgesehen davon, dass wir neue Tastaturen br?uchten, Tastaturtreiber sind dabei das geringere Problem.<br>  <br>  Es geht n?mlich auch anders. Wenn ich Spanisch und Portugiesisch miteinander vergleiche, so schreibt der Spanier "Se?or", der Portugiese "Senhor". Gleiches Wort, gleiche Bedeutung. Es geht also auch ohne Sonderzeichen. Das w?re in jedem Fall meine Priorit?t!<br>  <br>  Aber ich kann mir nicht vorstellen, dieses Projekt zeitnah zu realisieren. Au?erdem bin ich ein Gegner von Schreibweisen, die von Gremien oder Ausschüssen oder wem auch immer definiert wurden. Sprachliche Entwicklung sollte dem Sprachgebrauch überlassen bleiben. Nicht irgendeiner Verordnung.<br>  <br>  Aber das ist schon wieder ein anderes Thema!|`|c0998070bced6de899f7cc9ebe3780eeaa	Eine Sprache lebt und daher entwickelt sie sich auch. Wenn man deutsche Texte von mehreren Hundert Jahren liest, sind manche - obwohl Deutsch - kaum zu verstehen. <br>  <br>  Durch die Entwicklung der Sprache sind natürlich auch solche "Unsinnigkeiten" in der Aussprache und noch mehr in der Schrift zu finden. Mich st?ren beispielsweise das "?" und die unsinnigen Umlaute ebenso wie die Abweichungen von Aussprache und Schreibung. <br>  <br>  Aber damit müssen wir wohl leben müssen.<br>  <br>  P.S. Deutsch ist allerdings keine Ausnahme, das ist in allen Sprachen so.

9xJlsakbaa	Halo,<br>  <br>  Sebenarnya banyak keuntungan yang kita miliki.<br>  <br>  Pertama, mari kita bahas tentang segi Ekonomi, dari letak astronomis Indonesia, berada pada daerah khatulistiwa. Karena itu Indonesia memiliki sinar dan suhu Matahari yang baik serta curah hujan yang cukup, sehingga tumbuhan atau hutan di Indonesia tumbuh dengan subur, sehingga Indonesia memiliki hutan hujan tropis, yaitu hutan yang hijau sepanjang tahun. Hal ini dapat menjadi devisa utama bagi Indonesia. Indonesia juga berada pada garis sirkum pegunungan di dunia, hal ini membuat Indonesia kaya akan gas alam dan macam-macam SDA lainnya (tidak seperti Singapura yang rakyatnya mayoritas menjadi pedagang atau hanya pembuat barang tak baku menjadi barang jadi).<br>  <br>  Dari segi budaya, Indonesia merupakan persatuan dari berbagai suku/etnik, sehingga kaya akan seni dan lain sebagainya, hal ini dapat menarik wisatawan domestik maupun asing untuk berkunjung ke Indonesia untuk menyaksikan seni-seni dan lain sebagainya. Dan Indonesia memiliki ratusan Bahasa Suku atau Daerah bahkan pencampuran bahasa dari negara lain yang bermacam-macam, seperti Melayu, Arab Saudi, Inggris, Belanda, dan lainnya.Hal ini juga memikat para wisatawan (tidak seperti Arab Saudi atau negara Asia Barat lainnya).<br>  <br>  Dari segi pariwisata, Indonesia termasuk berada pada lokasi terstrategis di dunia, diapit oleh dua benua, yakni Benua Asia dan Australia, serta diapit oleh dua Samudera, yakni Samudera Pasifik dan Hindia, hal ini membuat tingkat pariwisata bagi Indonesia sangat mendukung, baik yang pergi maupun yang datang (tidak seperti negara-negara di Eropa Tengah).<br>  <br>  Dari segi geografis, Indonesia merupakan negara kepulauan yang membuat pantai dan laut berada disekelilingnya, serta garis pantai Indonesia yang termasuk terpanjang di dunia, membuat wisatawan tertarik untuk singgah, contohnya seperti Kuta di Bali, Pangandaran di Jawa Barat, dan pulau lainnya di daerah Indonesia Tengah dan Timur (tidak seperti negara-negara Eropa Tengah yang sulit untuk pergi ke pantai).<br>  <br>  Dari segi sosial, Rakyat Indonesia juga termasuk ramah dan baik serta tahu tenggang rasa dan tolong menolong (dibandingkan negara lainnya yang hidup seperti sendiri), hal ini membuat kita merasa nyaman.<br>  <br>  Dari segi astronomis, Indonesia berada pada garis khatulistiwa dan dikelilingi oleh hamparan laut dan samudera yang luas, sehingga Indonesia hanya mempunyai dua musim, yaitu hujan dan kemarau yang disebabkan oleh Angin muson barat dan timur. Terasa sejuk. (Tidak seperti negara-negara di Eropa Utara atau Amerika Utara yang kadang-kadang rakyatnya menderita akibat badai),<br>  <br>  Indonesia juga merupakan negara yang luas, sehingga kita masih bisa membeli tanah/lahan/rumah sendiri (tidak seperti Singapura atau Monako yang rata-rata penduduknya tinggal di apartemen).<br>  <br>  Dari segi fisiografis, Indonesia memiliki tanah yang subur, sehingga hampir bermacam-macam tumbuhan di dunia dapat hidup di Indonesia. Dan Indonesia memiliki beragam fauna, karena Indonesia terbagi atas dua garis fauna yang dipisahkan oleh Garis Weber dan Wallace (tidak seperti Cina, Jepang, atau negara-negara di bagian Utara atau Selatan Bumi).<br>  <br>  Dan saya tidak bermaksud ingin melucu, tetapi jika anda mengalami ban kempes atau bocor saat mengemudi kendaraan, hampir dipastikan bahwa anda dapat menemukan tempat tambal ban dengan mudah, begitu juga dengan kios atau warung dan lain sebagainya (tidak seperti Amerika Serikat yang rata-rata penduduknya harus menelepon truk gandeng jika terkena ban kempes, atau mengharuskan perki ke market jika ingin butuk sesuatu).<br>  <br>  Sebenarnya masih banyak lagi keuntungan menjadi warga negara Indonesia, tetapi kita sebagai rakyatnya belum dapat mempergunakan hal-hal tersebut secara baik dan maksimal.<br>  <br>  Semoga hal-hal diatas dapat sedikit membantu anda,<br>  Terima kasih.|`|ZiJ4Zvajaa	ada sih dari segi hukum, hukum di indonesia bisa di hitung sangat ringan, coba kalau tinggal di cina, berapa banyak warganya yang di hukum mati bahkan yang pernah ku lihat masih remaja, di hukum mati di tempat umum, cuma masalah seperti narkoba. <br>  <br>  bayangkan kalau terjadi di sini cewek belasan tahun di hukum mati ( di tembak ) misal; di kaki bukit pinggir kota dan boleh di tonton umum. itulah enak jadi orang indonesia, hukuman setelah menjalani 2 tahun masa penjara akan di kuranggi. atau seperti hukuman mati yang di tangguhkan sampai belasan yahun.<br>  <br>  orang indonesia lebih mudah mengampuni orang yang pernah bersalah di masa lalu. dan bisa-bisa dia anggap sudah tidak ada.<br>  misal kaum penjajah, belanda, inggris, dan secara tidak langsung ( perancis), berapa banyak orang membenci bangsa2 itu padahal mereka bekas penjajah.<br>  <br>  kasihan orang keturunan cina, karena kemakmuran mereka mereka lebih banyak di benci oleh orang asli. (padahal orang cina gaya hidupnya sangat sederhana sekali, dan sangat irit ) <br>  <br>  indonesia menjadi negara kesayangan , bahkan orang cina sendiri enggang pulang ke negeri nenek moyangnya yang katanya sekarang menjadi negara maju), katanya dinisi masih enak dari pada di cina.|`|kTaRCUk2aa	Menurut saya, keuntungannya: kita patut bersyukur bumi pertiwi ini memiliki banyak SDA yang melimpah ruah dibandingkan negara2 maju lainnya, Tanah yang subur atau dikenal sebagai zamrud khatulistiwa , dan indonesia juga terdiri dari 5 pulau besar dan +- 16 000 lebih pulau kecil di sekelilingnya. Sebenarnya kalau diitung2 banyak tuh keuntungan menjadi WNI. Kerugiannya : Indonesia adalh negara terkorup 2 di dunia, penduduknya banyak yang menyukai produk2 luar atau nggak cinta produk negeri sendiri, Banyak yang serba palsu, Maraknya penggunaan formalin dll.

Amigo....entenda que voce n?o faz idéia do que está falando. Isso é uma coisa inexplicavel....assim como o amor !  Deus fez o homem e a mulher para a procria??o....e isso continuará sendo assim. Mas o  em rela??o ao amor Ele nos deu o livre arbitrio, ele n?o disse que homem pode AMAR só a mulher e vice versa... Ele disse amai o próximo! E digo mais... as pessoas se preocupam tanto em colocar rotulo em todo mundo que se esque?em do que fazem, do que pensam...ao invés der voce fazer esse tipo de pergunta...voce deveria perguntar se ser uma má pessoa é falta de carater? falta de amor proprio? falta de educa??o?.....porque ninguem quer saber se está fazendo o bem ou n?o....quer saber porque o outro é gay....ESSA IDéIA ESTá ERRADA.....come?e a se importar com coisas mais importantes meu amigo.

Rn8bL6Tlaa	12 Proofs that Muhammad (Peace be upon him )<br>  <br>   was a True Prophet<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  An Article written by Shaikh Abdur Rahman Abdul Khaliq <br>  <br>  My brothers and sisters everywhere! With this essay, I am not singling out the adherents of Islam - to which I ascribe - but rather I am writing this essay to every man and woman throughout the whole world. <br>  I ask Allah that He facilitates that this essay reaches every ear, falls under the sight of every eye, and is understood by every heart... Muhammad the son of `Abdullah is Allah's Prophet and the Final Messenger Sent by Allah to the Inhabitants of Earth. My brothers and sisters everywhere! You should know that the Messenger, Muhammad the son of`Abdullah (may Allah's blessings and peace be upon him) is Allah's Messenger in reality and truth. The evidences that show his veracity are abundant. None but an infidel, who out of arrogance alone, could deny these signs. <br>  <br>  Among these proofs: <br>  <br>  <br>  1. Muhammad (may Allah's blessings and peace be upon him) was raised illiterate, unable to read or write, and remained like that till his death. Among all his people, he was known as being truthful and trustworthy. Before receiving revelation, he had no prior knowledge of Religion or any previously sent Message. He remained like that for his first forty years. Revelation then came to Muhammad with theKoran that we now have between our hands. This Koran mentioned most of the accounts found in the previous scriptures, telling us about these events in the greatest detail as if he witnessed them. These accounts came precisely as they were found in the Torah sent down to Moses and in the Gospel sent down to Jesus. Neither the Jews or Christians were able to believe him regarding anything that he said. <br>  <br>  <br>  2. Muhammad (may Allah's blessings and peace be upon him) also foretold of everything that wouldoccur to him and his community after him, pertaining to victory, the removal of the tyrannical kingdoms of Chosroes [the royal title for the Zoroastrian kings of Persia] and Caesar, and the establishment of the religion of Islam throughout the earth. These events occurred exactly as Muhammad foretold, as ifhe was reading the future from an open book. <br>  <br>  <br>  3. Muhammad (may Allah's blessings and peace be upon him) also brought an Arabic Koran that isthe peak of eloquence and clarity. The Koran challenged those eloquent and fluent Arabs of his time, who initially belied him, to bring forth a single chapter like the Koran. The eloquent Arabs of his day were unable to contest this Koran.Indeed, till our day, none has ever dared to claim that he has been able to compose words that equal-or even approach-the order, grace, beauty, and splendor of this Glorious Koran. <br>  <br>  <br>  4. The life history of this Noble Prophet was a perfect example of being upright, merciful,compassionate, truthful, brave, generous, distant from all evil character, and ascetic in all worldly matters, while striving solely for the reward of the Hereafter. Moreover, in all his actions and dealings, he was ever mindful and fearful of Allah. <br>  <br>  <br>  5. Allah instilled great love for Muhammad (may Allah's blessings and peace be upon him) in the hearts of all who believed in and met him. This love reached such a degree that any of his companions would willingly sacrifice his (or her) self, mother or father for him. Till today, those who believe in Muhammad honor and love him. Anyone of those who believe in him would ransom his own family and wealth to see him, even if but once. <br>  <br>  <br>  6. All of history has not preserved the biography of any person in the manner it has preserved the life of Muhammad, who is the most influential human in history. Nor has the entire earth known of anyone whom every morning and evening, and many times thereafter throughout the day, is thought of by those who believe in him. Upon rememberingMuhammad, the believers in him will greet him and ask Allah to bless him. They do such with full hearts and true love for him. <br>  <br>  <br>  7. Nor has there every been a man on earth whom is still followed in all his doings by those whobelieve in him. Those who believe in Muhammad, sleep in the manner he slept; purify themselves (through ablutionand ritual washing) in the manner he purified himself; and adhere to his practice in the way they eat, drink, and clothe themselves. <br>  <br>  Indeed in all aspects of their lives, the believers in Muhammad adhere to the teachings he spread among them and the path that he traveled upon during his life. <br>  <br>  During every generation, from his day till our time, the believers in this Noble prophet have fullyadhered to his teachings. With some, this has reached the degree that they desire to follow and adhere to the Prophet's way in his personal matters regarding which Allah has not sought of them to adhere to in worship. For example, some will only eat those specific foods or only wear those specific garmentsthat the Messenger liked. <br>  <br>  Let alone all that, all those who believe in Muhammad repeat those praises of Allah, special prayers,and invocations that he would say during each of his actions during day and night, like: what he would say when he greeted people, upon entering and leaving the house, entering and leaving the mosque, entering and leaving the bathroom, going to sleep and awaking from sleep, observing the new crescent, observing the new fruit on trees, eating, drinking, dressing, riding, traveling and returning from travel, etc. Let alone all that, all those who believe in Muhammad fully perform-even to the minute detail-every act of worship-like prayer, fasting, charity, and pilgrimage-as this Noble Messenger (may Allah's blessingsand peace be upon him) taught and as he himself performed.All of this allows those who believe in him, to live their lives in all aspects with this Noble Messenger as their example, as if he was standing before them, for them to follow in all their doings. <br>  <br>  <br>  8. There has never been nor will there ever be a man anywhere upon this earth who has received suchlove, respect, honor, and obedience in all matters-small and large alike-as has this Noble Prophet. <br>  <br>  <br>  9. Since his day, in every region of the earth and during every period, this Noble Prophet has beenfollowed by individuals from all races, colors and peoples. Many of those who followed him were previously Christians, Jews, pagans, idolaters, or without any religion. Among those who chose to follow him, were those who were known for their sound judgment, wisdom, reflection, and foresight. They chose to follow this Noble Prophet after they witnessed the signs of his truthfulness and the evidences of his miracles. They did not choose to follow Muhammad out of compulsion or coercion orbecause they had adopted the ways of their fathers and mothers.Indeed many of the followers of this Prophet (may Allah's blessings peace be upon him), chose to follow him during the time when Islam was weak, when there were few Muslims, and when there was severe persecution of his followers on earth. Most people who have followed this Prophet (may Allah's blessings and peace be upon him) have done so not to acquire some material benefits. Indeed many of his followers have suffered the greatest forms of harm and persecution as a result of followingthis Prophet. Despite all this harm and persecution, this did not turn them back from his religion. My brethren! All of this clearly indicates to anyone possessing any sense, that this Prophet was truly and really Allah's messenger and that he was not just a man who claimed prophethood or spoke aboutAllah without knowledge. <br>  <br>  <br>  10. With all this, Muhammad came with a great religion in its credal and legal make-up. Muhammad described Allah with qualities of complete perfection, and at the same time in a manner that is free of ascribing to Him any imperfection. Neither the philosophers or the wise could ever describe Allah like such. Indeed it is impossible to imagine that any human mind could conceive of an existing being that possesses such complete ability, knowledge, and greatness; Who has subdued thecreation; Who has encompassed everything in the universe, small or large; and Who possesses such perfect mercy.Nor is it in the ability of any human being to place a perfect law based upon justice, equality, mercy and objectivity for all human activity on earth like the laws that Muhammad brought for all spheres of human activity - like buying and selling, marriage and divorce, renting, testimony, custody, and all othercontracts that are necessary to uphold life and civilization on earth. <br>  <br>  <br>  11. It is impossible that any person conceive wisdom, morals, good manners, nobleness of charactersas what this honorable Prophet (may Allah's blessings and peace be upon him) brought. In a full and complete manner, Muhammad spread a teaching regarding character and manners towardone' parents, relatives, fiends, family, humanity, animals, plants and inanimate objects. It is impossible for the human mind alone to grasp all of that teaching or come with a similar teaching. All of that unequivocally indicates that this Messenger did not bring an) of this religion from his own accord, but that it was rather a teaching and inspiration that he received from the One Who created the earth and the high heavens above and created this universe in its miraculous architecture andperfection. <br>  <br>  <br>  12. The legal and credal make-up of the religion that the Messenger, Muhammad, (may Allah'sblessings and peace be upon him) brought resembles the engineering of the heavens and the earth. All of that indicates that He who created the heavens and the earth is the One Who sent down this great law and upright religion. The degree of inimitability of the Divine law that was sent down upon Muhammad is to the same degree of inimitability of the Divine creation of the heavens and earth. For just as humanity cannot create this universe, in the same manner h|`|suvmne5baa	Do your homework, maybe it will teach you to think for yourself.|`|q8tTteHFaa	Why ask here?

Noi siamo solo soldatini di fango in una guerra in miniatura. <br>  Chi rinuncia ai sogni è destinato a morire. <br>  Ci sono diversi tipi di libertà, e ci sono parecchi equivoci in proposito… Il genere più importante di libertà è di essere ciò che si è davvero. Si baratta la propria libertà per un ruolo. Si barattano i propri sensi per un atto. Si svende la propria capacità di sentire, e in cambio si indossa una maschera. Si può privare un uomo della sua libertà politica e non lo si ferirà – finché non lo si priverà della sua libertà di sentire. Questo può distruggerlo. <br>  Comprare droga è come comprare un biglietto per un mondo fantastico, ma il prezzo di questo biglietto è la vita. <br>  Darei la vita per non morire. <br>  Darei tutti i miei giorni per un unico ieri. <br>  Datemi un sogno in cui vivere perché la realtà mi sta uccidendo. <br>  Di questi tempi la fuga è l'unico mezzo per continuare a sognare. <br>  Dicono che l'amore è vita, io per amore sto morendo. <br>  Dicono che sbagliando s'impara, allora lasciatemi sbagliare. <br>  Dopo il suo sangue, la cosa migliore che un uomo può dare di sé è una lacrima. <br>  è il Sole ad inseguire la Luna, o la Luna ad inseguire il Sole? E il cielo si stancherà mai di far loro da terzo incomodo? <br>  è meglio stare all'ombra e vedere la luce che stare alla luce e vedere l'ombra. <br>  è meglio una fine disperata che una disperazione senza fine. <br>  è nel momento in cui dubiti di volare che perdi per sempre la facoltà di farlo. <br>  Eroe non è colui che non cade mai, ma colui che una volta caduto trova il coraggio per rialzarsi <br>  Essere allegri non significa necessariamente essere felici, talvolta si ha voglia di ridere e scherzare per non sentire che dentro si ha voglia di piangere. <br>  Fra il bene e il male c'è una porta, e io l'aprirò! <br>  Fuoco, cammina con me! <br>  Guarda le piccole cose perché un giorno ti volterai e capirai che erano grandi. <br>  Ho dato tutto ciò che potevo, sono poeta che racconta le sue storie e che canta i suoi versi. Se volete ascoltarmi tutti insieme, andremo lontano; se non vorrete ascoltarmi... <br>  I dubbi te li crea la libertà. <br>  I sogni sono come le stelle, basta alzare gli occhi e sono sempre là. <br>  Il futuro non esiste, è qualcosa che noi ricorriamo e, quando lo raggiungiamo, subito diventa presente e poi passato. <br>  Il mio migliore amico è lo specchio, perché quando piango non ride mai. <br>  Il mio più grande dolore è non poter far niente per la persona che amo. <br>  Il passaggio più importante della vita è quello tra due amici e due innamorati. <br>  Incontrami per la città, mentre vago per la città, in cerca di qualcosa che non so, incontrami e sorridimi, poi va per la tua strada. <br>  Invece di sentirti in colpa o cercare delle scuse per delle azioni negative compiute in passato, incomincia ora ad agire positivamente. <br>  Io amo e vivo in silenzio ma dietro ogni sorriso nascondo una lacrima di dolore. Io sono così perché rispecchio quello che ho dentro. <br>  Io non sarò mai nessuno, ma nessuno sarà mai come me. <br>  Io vivo per dominare la vita, non per essere schiavo. <br>  L'anima di una persona è nascosta in uno sguardo per questo abbiamo paura di farci guardare negli occhi. <br>  L'unico modo per sentirsi qualcuno è sentirsi se stessi. <br>  La droga è la speranza di chi speranza non ne ha più. <br>  La felicità è fatta d'un niente che al momento in cui lo viviamo ci sembra tutto. <br>  La liberazione interiore è l'unica cosa per cui valga la pena di morire, l'unica per cui valga la pena di vivere. <br>  La mente mette i limiti, il cuore li spezza. <br>  La notte è un pozzo nero dove intingo inchiostro per le mie poesie. <br>  La perenne tentazione della vita è quella di confondere i sogni con la realtà. <br>  La solitudine è ascoltare il vento e non poterlo raccontare a nessuno. <br>  La vera felicità non è in fondo a un bicchiere, non è dentro a una siringa: la trovi solo nel cuore di chi ti ama. <br>  La vera poesia non dice niente, elenca solo delle possibilità. Apre tutte le porte. E voi potete passare per quella che preferite. <br>  La vita è come un'autostrada: non finisce mai, ma ci si resta sempre vittima. <br>  La vita è come uno specchio: ti sorride se la guardi sorridendo. <br>  Le persone credono di essere libere, ma sono solo libere di crederlo. <br>  Liberate l'amore o liberatevene per sempre! <br>  Malinconia del passato, gioia del presente, pentimento del futuro... questa la vita. <br>  Mi chiamano drogato perché mi faccio le canne, ma non sanno che la vera droga è la crudeltà dell'uomo. <br>  Nella vita ci sarà sempre un bastardo che ti farà soffrire, ma sarà l'unica persona che riuscirai ad amare veramente. <br>  Non accontentarti dell'orizzonte, cerca l'infinito. <br>  Non amare per paura di soffrire è come non vivere per paura di morire. <br>  Non arrenderti mai, perché quando pensi che sia tutto finito, è il momento in cui tutto ha inizio. <br>  Non avere paura della morte, fa meno male della vita. <br>  Non c'è notte tanto grande da non permettere al Sole di risorgere il giorno dopo. <br>  Non cercare l'impossibile in questo mondo di pazzi, non vi è luogo dove tu possa rifugiarti, ma se trovi qualcuno che ami tienilo stretto perché ricorda: si nasce e si muore soli... tutto il resto è niente. <br>  Non credere a chi ti dice "ti amo", ma a chi ti guarda negli occhi e tace. <br>  Non dire mai che i sogni sono inutili perché inutile è la vita di chi non sa sognare. <br>  Non essere così triste e pensieroso, ricorda che la vita è come uno specchio: ti sorride se la guardi sorridendo. <br>  Non diventerò vecchio: io sono come una stella cadente. <br>  Non fuggire in cerca di libertà quando la tua più grande prigione è dentro di te. <br>  Non ha importanza che una cosa sia vera, l'importante è crederci! <br>  Non ho chiesto a nessuno di nascere, perciò lasciatemi vivere come voglio. <br>  Non parlare mai di amore e pace: un Uomo ci ha provato e lo hanno crocifisso. <br>  Non pentirti di qualcosa che hai fatto, se quando l'hai fatta eri felice. <br>  Non piangere per chi non merita il tuo sorriso. <br>  Non piangere per me che parto, ma pensa che se domani piove me ne sono andato a cercare il Sole. <br>  Non piangere se un amico ti ha lasciato: solo quando ti avrà dimenticato potrai dire di averlo perso per sempre. <br>  Non serve strappare le pagine della vita, basta saper voltar pagina e ricominciare. <br>  Non si può dire di aver vissuto se prima non si è provato ciò che è proibito. <br>  Non tradire chi ti sorride: potrebbe avere la morte nel cuore e regalarti ugualmente un po' di vita. <br>  Non vivere con la paura di morire, ma muori con la gioia di aver vissuto. <br>  Non volevo nascere (e sono nato), non volevo vivere (e sto vivendo), ma quando morirò andrò in paradiso (perché l'inferno lo sto già vivendo). <br>  Non è cercando di essere gli altri che si è se stessi. <br>  Non è forte chi non cade mai, ma chi cadendo trova la forza di rialzarsi. <br>  Non è tanto dell'aiuto degli amici che abbiamo bisogno, ma del poter far affidamento su quell'aiuto. <br>  Ognuno di noi ha un paio di ali, ma solo chi sogna impara a volare. <br>  Penso a me stesso come a un essere umano intelligente e sensibile, ma con l'anima di un pagliaccio, che mi costringe a distruggere tutto nel momento più importante. <br>  Per cancellare una vita ci vuole un attimo, per cancellare un attimo ci vuole una vita. <br>  Perché è scandaloso fare l'amore a 16 anni se si può morire a tutte le età? <br>  Perdonami Padre poiché so quello che faccio. <br>  Quando imparerai a fregartene della gente, solo allora sarai grande. <br>  Quando la gente mi chiede cosa vuol dire amare, abbasso gli occhi per paura di ricordare. <br>  Quando la guerra sarà finita, saremo troppo stanchi per goderci la vita. <br>  Quando lei ti lascerà perché avrà trovato due occhi più belli dei tuoi, altre mani da stringere, un'altra bocca da baciare... non odiarla, ma ricorda i momenti che avete passato insieme e ringraziala... perché lei ti ha dato un poco della sua vita. <br>  Quando ti sveglierai e non vedrai più il sole, o sarai morto o sarai tu il sole. <br>  Questa notte non può durare in eterno, perché fra poco arriverà il mattino, ammesso che ci sia un domani. <br>  Rifiutarsi di amare per paura di soffrire è come rifiutarsi di vivere per paura di morire. <br>  Rido ma non sono felice: sto solo recitando un copione chiamato vita. <br>  Se ami qualcosa lasciala andare via, solo se torna sarà veramente tua. <br>  Se devi vivere tutta la vita strisciando come un verme, alzati e muori! <br>  Se dovessi scegliere tra il tuo amore e la mia vita, sceglierei il tuo amore, perché è la mia vita. <br>  Se dovessi scegliere tra la vita e la morte, perché non esiste vita senza di te, di sicuro sceglierei la morte prima che mi scelga lei. <br>  Se hai un'idea rispettala, non perché è un'idea, ma perché è tua. <br>  Se la morte è il risveglio, la vita è un sogno. <br>  Se le persone che parlano male di me, sapessero quello che dico io di loro, parlerebbero peggio. <br>  Se non hai ragione per vivere, non trovarne una per mori|`|v54TwGdaaa	io ne o una quando sono un po giù e forza e coraggio oppure volere e potere|`|yDM2eGs3aa	Meglio un giorno da leone che cento da pecora.

S51x5vK3aa	Im Internet findest du ganze Listen von deutschen Lehnw?rtern im Englischen. Ich will sie gar nicht aufz?hlen.

"Angst"), Technik ("Autobahn"), Musik ("Zimbelstern") oder Kriegsführung ("Blitz").<br>  Allerdings m?chte ich anmerken, dass das Englische zu 40% aus franz?sischem - wenn auch altfranz?sischem - Vokabular besteht. W?rter franz?sischen Ursprungs finden sich in allen Lebensbereichen: "beef" (frz. boeuf), "charity" (frz. charité), "city" (frz. cité), "treasure" (frz. trésor), "aid" (frz. aide) usw.

They aren't lying they are denying the theory.|`|EQhY4x05aa	Why would they say the earth is flat, and scare all those old school mariners into thinking they would fall off the world?|`|IgUGbW85aa	So you want to say you came from a monkey?|`|ebETHKvGaa	I don't think evolution is a lie.<br>  I think one species having a different kind of species is.<br>  It has never been proven and never will. If you want to disprove God, than belief in this will benefit you. Any scientist who disagrees with this, there have been many, are laughed out of their field. So why would you protest it with risk of job loss and humiliation. There have been many who have lied about findings, used bones and teeth from other animals to make an ape looking man.|`|kk8iDf3xaa	Wow...Many Christians accept evolution and many don't, and not all for the same reasons. <br>  The lying angle really misses the point. There is evolution as a biological explanation and evolution as a philosophy. <br>  <br>  God could have created and used evoltution as the method. <br>  <br>  The problem comes when a scientist or whoever goes beyond the science part and extrapolates into non-scientific areas. Don't think conspiracy theory :) <br>  <br>  What's So Great About Christianity  by Dinesh D'Souza  -- very popular scholarly book whose author accepts evolution. <br>  He said in an interview:<br>  InNterviewer :You obviously accept the theory of evolution, but you point out that its explanatory power has limits that are ignored by Dawkins and company. What is the significance of those limits. <br>  <br>  D'Souza :Evolution doesn't explain the origin of life. It doesn't explain consciousness, and, despite some heroic efforts, it doesn't explain morality. I'm not making a God-of-the-gaps argument arguing that because evolution can't account for it, therefore God did it. But neither should we submit to the atheism-of-the-gaps, that holds since science explains some things, it can surely explain everything.|`|106JbfFkaa	almost all Christians don't say evolution is a lie only a few crazy ones|`|19f2152c85750f3009b06b3b0b650899aa	Why do Atheists deny that God could quite possibly have started the whole 'evolution' thing?<br>  <br>  I just happen to believe in both. <br>  <br>  When we close our minds to the many different possibility's in this world.....we cease to grow and become auto-mats.

But I will answer the question the way a closed minded christian would, then in parentheses give my best answer.<br>  <br>  Why is evolution a lie?<br>  -Because Genesis clearly contradicts the theory. (but it also contradicts itself, and there is no reason to believe it is not a lie, just the pattern of how God created the universe.)<br>  <br>  What beneifts does it provide to society or to scientists to make up this devilish lie?<br>  -They are of Satan, and Satan is the father of lies. (Actually, these people that find these things are usually unbiased, and go only off of evidence, there is NO good reason why they should lie)<br>  <br>  Why would a scientis [sic] lie about something like that?<br>  - Again, they are of Satan, and Satan is the father of lies.<br>  (They wouldn't, again, they are usually unbiased, and go only off of evidence)|`|nRYU8Fdoaa	nobody lies about it, ya thunk Jews believe in evolution... ? you abviously have a hard on for Christians... get over it and grow up... most Christians accept evolution... did not know that, did you ?<br>  EDIT: actually they do... more schooling, less drooling...

It is sad that going to church makes you relive the most terrible thing that could happen to a child and causes you to have thoughts that scare you so much.

He paid a terrible price for your help, healing and deliverance.  Do NOT dwell on and go over and over in your mind all the negative things of the past and the present.  Bring EVERY THOUGHT to JESUS  (see 2 Cor. 10:4-5).  Memorize these verses, and follow them.  Then you MUST dwell on Psalm 91.  These verses will bring the deliverance you seek.  You do not need to go thru deliverance sessions.........God will deliver you simply thru using and believing these Scriptures.  It is IMPERATIVE that you use the above Scriptures.  Read them aloud when you are able.  Commit them to memory.  You also need one other Scripture, and that is Deut. 54:17.  I can GUARANTEE YOU that your enemy, the devil, will RETREAT from you as you use these Scriptures.  Remember that the Lord Jesus constantly quoted Scriptures.  The POWER of God's WORD, if USED, will drive away the darkness.  Keep at it.  The enemy may slowly retreat....or he may retreat for awhile and then try to come back.  RESIST him by using these powerful Scriptures.  God's WORD frightens the devil and his demons.......and they cannot hurt you, or confuse you, when you stand on these Words of God.  They lie to you, Remember this, they LIE to you.  God's Word is truth, and it is this truth that will drive out the torment.  Dwell on God, and not on the devil.  Keep your eyes on Jesus.|`|uvs2Wk2daa	Ask your pastor! If you were raped it's not your fault and your step-father would be the person who sinned, in my book! It's not your sin!

Pray for your asbuser that way you will heap burning coals on his head. He needs to repent not you.|`|WxqeMSw7aa	What happened to you was not your fault so how could God forgive you for it  <br>  <br>  ~God loves you SO much (you) , not the abuse, not the pain , not the fear or confusion. HE LOVES YOU  !<br>  <br>  Have you read anything by James T Anderson ?  He is very good at teaching WHO we are in Christ, not what we should be doing. Once we know who we are, what we do comes naturally.<br>  <br>  Have you been baptised in the Holy Spirit ?  If not then I suggest you ask Him, and keep asking until it happens. The Holy Spirit is known as the Comforter, and it sounds to me like you need a comforter right now.<br>  Also its ok to go and have a good long shout to God about how you feel. David did it quite often : a good example being Psalm 109. He has a rant, gets it all out of his system and towards the end of the Psalm he starts to feel a lot better.<br>  <br>  Also, in the Bible, satan is known as the "accuser", if you feel bad, or that things are being aimed at you in an accusing manner tell satan to get lost, you are now a new creation in Christ, and that he has made all things new.<br>  <br>  Here are some words of encouragement :<br>  <br>  Psa 103:8  The LORD is merciful and loving, slow to become angry and full of constant love. <br>  Psa 103:9  He does not keep on rebuking; he is not angry forever. <br>  Psa 103:10  He does not punish us as we deserve or repay us according to our sins and wrongs. <br>  Psa 103:11  As high as the sky is above the earth, so great is his love for those who honor him. <br>  Psa 103:12  As far as the east is from the west, so far does he remove our sins from us. <br>  Psa 103:13  As a father is kind to his children, so the LORD is kind to those who honor him. <br>  Psa 103:14  He knows what we are made of; he remembers that we are dust. <br>  Psa 103:15  As for us, our life is like grass. We grow and flourish like a wild flower; <br>  Psa 103:16  then the wind blows on it, and it is gone--- no one sees it again. <br>  Psa 103:17  But for those who honor the LORD, his love lasts forever, and his goodness endures for all generations <br>  <br>  2Co 5:17  Anyone who is joined to Christ is a new being; the old is gone, the new has come. <br>  <br>  Zec 3:1  In another vision the LORD showed me the High Priest Joshua standing before the angel of the LORD. And there beside Joshua stood Satan, ready to bring an accusation against him. <br>  Zec 3:2  The angel of the LORD said to Satan, "May the LORD condemn you, Satan! May the LORD, who loves Jerusalem, condemn you. This man is like a stick snatched from the fire." <br>  Zec 3:3  Joshua was standing there, wearing filthy clothes. <br>  Zec 3:4  The angel said to his heavenly attendants, "Take away the filthy clothes this man is wearing." Then he said to Joshua, "I have taken away your sin and will give you new clothes to wear." <br>  <br>  Rev 12:10  And I heard a great voice saying in Heaven, Now has come the salvation and power and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of His Christ. For the accuser of our brothers is cast down, who accused them before our God day and night. <br>  Rev 12:11  And they overcame him because of the blood of the Lamb.<br>  <br>  Try to find out about "freedom in Christ" its an excellent course. <br>  My heart goes out to you, know this : we WILL be praying for you at my church. <br>  <br>  If you want to know the truth, look in Gods word. Nowhere in the Word will you find yourself condemned for whats happened to you  ( someone elses sin ) , and if you know salvation then your personal sin has been dealt with, once and for all.|`|zQyslfHKaa	I am so sorry that you were abused by people you should be able to trust.  It is a horrifically terrible thing.<br>  <br>  Please don't let religious impressions of evil effect your view of yourself.<br>  <br>  You have no reason to feel guilty, and if you find your religion causes you to feel dirty or unclean or sinful or unloved, it may be time to evaluate whether it is good for you or not.|`|AA11907063	Please find some professional help so that you can realize that you did nothing wrong, nothing at all.  There is nothing God needs to forgive you for.|`|pRF5LLloaa	You question is confusing.<br>  <br>  For complete healing, the VICTIM needs to forgive the PERPETRATOR, even if the "perp" doesn't ask for it, or maybe isn't even present (in prison or dead). Although sometimes helpful, it is not absolutely necessary that you ever see this person again.<br>  <br>  While you as a victim didn't do anything wrong, carrying around this unforgivness obviously causes you mental pain.  You must therefore forgive the "perp".<br>  <br>  YOUR forgiveness does not  release the criminal from any guilt.  He is still guilty of a crime, and needs to be punished. But THAT is not your job.  After a certain length of time it may not be the job of the police and/or courts (statute of limitations), but it will ALWAYS be the job of God to ultimately locate and punish this person.<br>  <br>  But be aware that the time for this man's Godly punishment may not come until his death.  That is not under your control -- that is God's realm.<br>  <br>  So forgive him now, Write him completely out of your life with a HUGE mental effort, and place the him and the crime he committed into the Hands of God.<br>  <br>  The act of forgiveness is for YOUR sake. not his.<br>  <br>  God Bless!|`|AA12281718	You do not need God's forgiveness because you did not sin. What happened to you was not your fault and has nothing to do with anything you might feel you had done.<br>  <br>  You are not guilty in God's eyes of anything. God loves you and always has. But your feelings that God hates you are because when something like this happens to us, we start to think that maybe God is punishing us by letting it happen.<br>  <br>  God is not and was not punishing you. He has laways loved you and always will. What your stepfather did to you was evil. And it is your stepfather that needs the forgiveness not you.<br>  <br>  The feeling you describe as pressure sounds to me like a feeling of calm overtaking the fear and anxiety. I hused to get that a lot just after I was abused and when I was finding my feet with God. All the fear and anxiety and guilt used to well up so that I felt as though I would burst, but then this feeling came over me like a wave, it seemed to calm me down and also felt like a gentle pressure that seemed to push the fears out.<br>  <br>  I believe now that God was trying to comfort me and make me feel calmer so that I could hear and understand what was being said. At the time I did not realise that what was being said was not aimed at me, but for me. It was to let me know that God felt as I did and that he was as angry over hwat happened to me as I was.<br>  <br>  For the longest time I used to cry myself to sleep because of the anger and guilt and pain I was suffering. I used to think that no one could help me and that every one knew and thought bad of me bacause of what happened.<br>  <br>  But the truth is that those around you may not know anything at all. Probably the only ones that do know are your direct family and those who may have needed to know to sort the whole thing out.<br>  <br>  But please don't blame yourself. You need to let go of this feeling of guilt and realise that none of what happened to you was your fault and nothing that happened to you was any form of punishment.<br>  <br>  The only 'evil' you can lay claim to is if you let yourself go on suffering like this. If you carry the burden around forever that makes you feel it is your fault. Then that would be wrong.<br>  <br>  Let go of this guilt. It is not yours. Give it back to the devil were it belongs and accept that you are blameless and innocent before God and that God has never ever stopped loving you.<br>  <br>  And no, being raped or abused does not count as 'sex before marriage'. You did not consent lawfully to the sex because as a child you are not legally old enough to give that kind of consent. Just as a baby cannot be guilty of sin when it is born, it is innocent. And you are innocent as a new born babe in this thing.<br>  <br>  You mention that this feeling comes at the times of prayer for healing. Have you considered that that is because God wants to heal your heart and to set you free? That is why he is trying to help you calm down so that you can accept his healing of your heart and accept his love for you and the cleansing he wants you to have of the evil that was DONE TO you.<br>  <br>  Now, if it would help I have some friends and we all are part of a group that helps people who have been victims of all kinds of abuse including spiritual sexual and others too. The group is here on yahoo and it is called cultrecovery but it also deals as I said with all kinds of recovery. You can join if you would like and I will be there as will many others who have been through similar problems like yours. We are all there to help and come from all kinds of backgrounds and have all kinds of understanding so I am sure between us we can answer and help you with all your questions and feelings.<br>  <br>  But even if you do not join this group please understand that god loves you. I cannot say that enough times. And all of God's children everywhere love you.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps even a little bit.

zk3hRk4naa	Eu estudei japonês por quase quatro anos, mas infelizmente n?o cheguei nem perto da fluência que eu gostaria de ter. Pretendo voltar a estudar em breve.<br>  <br>  De qualquer maneira, o que eu posso passar da minha experiência para você é que o japonês parece mais difícil do que realmente é. No tocante à pronúncia, o idioma é muito fácil, até porque quase todos os fonemas do japonês existem no português - com exce??o do "chi", "tsu" e de alguns outros poucos que s?o aprendidos com facilidade.<br>  <br>  Quanto à gramática, ela é bem mais simples do que a do português - mas é complicado comparar porque os dois idiomas têm estruturas totalmente diversas. A regra de deixar o verbo sempre no final das frases no japonês, por exemplo, era algo que me atrapalhava consideravelmente quando eu tentava montar frases mais compridas, porque simplesmente n?o estamos acostumados com esse modo de pensar. Em rela??o ao número de exce??es por regra, pelo menos, eu garanto que o japonês é menos traumático que o português nesse sentido.<br>  <br>  A escrita pode parecer alienígena à primeira vista, mas n?o é t?o complexa assim. O japonês utiliza 3 alfabetos, dois formados por sílabas apenas (hiragana e katakana) e um por figuras (kanji), este último "importado" do chinês e ocasionalmente modificado. Os dois primeiros alfabetos s?o ensinados primeiro e n?o requerem muito tempo para serem fixados; mesmo sem rever o idioma há algum tempo, eu n?o esqueci nenhum desses dois. Já o kanji é mais complicado, às vezes pela quantidade de leituras que uma palavra possui ou às vezes pela complexidade do tra?ado mesmo; se serve de consolo, nem os próprios japoneses usam ou conhecem todos eles.<br>  <br>  De qualquer forma, aprender um idioma é algo muito pessoal; existem pessoas que têm facilidade e outras n?o, gente que acha mais ou menos fácil uma determinada língua. N?o é impossível aprender japonês sendo brasileiro e n?o possuindo nenhum contato com a língua - basta vontade e dedica??o, como em qualquer outro idioma. Boa sorte para você!|`|539270258a2b099d679d0208b6b2f0aeaa	O basico é facil...   parece dificil mas é facil...  logo logo vc já decora os caracteres e tal...   o problema é qdo come?a a ver coisas  gramaticais um pouquinho mais complexas...  aí o bicho pega!  ^^ <br>  <br>  Eu sou japa entao nao sei como é para um brasileiro aprender japones...  mas pelo q me dizem é isso aí...|`|sqBsRpdxaa	depende da pessoa <br>  tem um site aqui que ensina é n?o é muito difícil<br>  <a href="http://www.aprendendojapones.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.aprendendojapones.com/</a>|`|tGQojNzwaa	Falar n?o é difícil.

Aliens..well...when I was 4 or 5 I swear I saw one in my hallway.  I'm not joking, nor was I on drugs.  I slept with the light on because I was always so scaredy when I was little.  This white, big-eyed, short, big-foreheaded dude seemed to come *thru* the hall window and in front of my open bedroom door.  He seemed to speak to me in my mind, telling me not to worry because he wasn't there for me. My husband swears I was dreaming, but I was not.  I even remember going around the house the next morning trying to figure out how he got in.  Now, I could have been astral projecting.  I won't rule that out.  But it wasn't a dream at all.  I also grew up with this terror of things coming out of the sky to get me.  I think it's connected. <br>  <br>  It's interesting the Air Force guy up there said that he's seen UFOs.  My grandad was in the Air Force and saw them, too.  He was told never to talk about it.  <br>  <br>  I've also seen strange lights in the sky, that scooped up and down and back and forth.  So have my sister and brother.   There's this one spot in eastern Colorado where they seem to get them a lot.  It's not near an airport, and anyway the lights don't move like airplanes.  <br>  <br>  Part of me thinks, but the galaxy is so big, and this part is so empty--why would they be here?  But so many normal, regular people have seen UFOs or maybe aliens that it makes me think it's possible.  There is a bright historian, David Jacobs, who has written several books on UFOs.  He talks to people who say they've been abducted and stuff. <br>  They're interesting but creepy.

You can't turn into a mermaid. The closest thing to being a mermaid is you. If you just like water and swimming you are a mermaid. That comes from the heart. Think about that.|`|e87578a8912d84efdea276789acfc11baa	First off my dear ....that is Witch with a capital ! Second, no self respecting Witch is going to give you any spells....we have way too much respect for our beloved Craft ! And what in the world do you need a Mermaid Spell for ? Oh and there are not any. My advice is don't play with magic ....ever.|`|AXoNyxMaaa	coming from a practitioner of spellcraft, there is no such thing as a spell to turn you into a mermaid... though that would be really cool....<br>  <br>  there might be a spell to help you see mermaids... for that, i would burn mugwort on an incense charcoal tab and say seven (or nine) times, "mermaids i wish to see, it is my will so mote it be" with your hands clasped over your eyes.... lol that might work but hopefully it won't backfire on you (i.e. seeing mermaids everywhere.... in your bed, in the car, on your house, on your plate, at school etc lol). IF mermaids exist (dunno if they do).<br>  <br>  postscript: you would be safer if you sealed your spell with "to the harm of none, the spell is done."<br>  <br>  post postscript: like lynne said, DONT mess with magic unless you have READ about it (real books, hon, not sites for little teenage goth chicks) and KNOW about it and BELIEVE in it. what you're talking about is like watching a magnificent ballet dancer do a pretty little dance and then you get up on the stage and try to do the same thing... fall down and break your ankle. READ UP ON IT.<br>  <br>  but contrary to what lynne said, i am a self-respecting practitioner and i don't mind sharing my intellectual insight into what spell i would use for a situation. just because some witches are secretive doesn't mean they have to be selfish.|`|CGCFDVpIaa	rofl theres no mermaid spell. wicca cant turn anything into something else, thats voodoo, and you dont want to mess with that. thats  like shrooms if we were talking about drugs; extraordinarily powerful, but will mess  you up so bad.|`|rkC5i4i0aa	what the heck is THIS all about?! mermaids? witches?<br>  uh...

e0lfV7skaa	No one is banned from sports due to orientation - in theory.<br>  <br>  There still isn't one currently active out gay athlete.  They still feel that if they don't wait until retirement, they're at risk from fans or players.|`|sVkBdQ28aa	Perhaps they were gay men who just played games and were proud of their sexuality? It's not like they were setting apart separate games.|`|xhr2juWGaa	Why does it matter? A group of people get together and mess around and have fun. It doesn't hurt anybody...it's not a big deal.|`|987n8L87aa	gaydom?<br>  but i never heard of the gay games, but i dont really care.|`|RPKKpwAiaa	they are not scared to say they are gay unlike you who prolly is gay...lol|`|V7F63wfgaa	Cool I wanna go to the gay games!!!!<br>  |`|NkjN8rLsaa	if they have the gay games surely they should have the straight games aswell?|`|KCVjqN8Taa	I haven't heard of it but I def support it|`|sWxaNuiAaa	lmfao.<br>  <br>  and you care why?<br>  <br>  who the heck cares if they have gay games..<br>  <br>  my god.

omWqhaqKaa	I hate racism it's disgusting.<br>  <br>  The fact that people can judge someone based on their race is gross. Sure there might have been someone who blew up the world trade center that was of a certain race for example, but that doesn't mean a whole race would do that.<br>  <br>  Where someone is born, what they look like and the language they speak do not determine the way that they are. <br>  <br>  I'm 15 years old too and when people genuinely will dislike someone based only on their race and not having known the person at all i feel sick.<br>  <br>  How is it possible that a black man is worse than a white man or vice versa? the truth is that terrorists, rapists, murderers and terrible people come from any race and it's not because they're a race it's because that's who they are. <br>  <br>  people are racist because they like classing themselves as better, superior and feel like they belong to a special group or something. no one is better than anyone else. we all come into the world the same way and leave the same way (please dont pick that argument apart i know there's c-section vs natural birth all that bullshit) but you get the point. seriously racism is disgusting and even if we all looked the same im sure people would find a way to discriminate so you just have to accept that they're the ones with the problems.|`|IPeORvphaa	<br>   I do not hate them I just pity them and it infuriates me that governments and society had not done anything to put and end or at least to relieve the ignorance that causes racism.<br>  Racists thoughts are often instilled by society and those who can ,make a difference just stand arms crossed.|`|7m33u9RKaa	I don't like any kind of prejudice, I think anyone who dislikes someone because they are different is pretty small minded, if people were more tolerant the world would be a better place.  You must also realise that some black people don't like white people, it does work both ways.|`|bc3a29fe87a18faea81427613782afe8aa	I detest racism - and at the end of the day, we all look the same underneath our skins! If only people could think of themselves as world citizens rather than skin colours or something. |`|zNkqZbE8aa	lols to katie ^^<br>  <br>  people are entitled to their own opinions. <br>  And doesn't every new kid get bullied at school, not just cos their from another country, cos the fact that their new. <br>  |`|iGbjmUzQaa	It not right but that's the way of the world. Let's see how long a white Westerner would survive living in Pakistan.|`|t6AtIIySaa	I hate everybody equally.  It's the only sane way to live.|`|hrqxD5K0aa	No, because that would make me a hypocrite and hater. I disagree with them, but only fools hate. |`|TGxBw0FEaa	BECAUSE THEY ARE TAKING OVER THE WORLD !!!!<br>  well where i live anyway|`|X5hTmAkBaa	hating is something that racists do... so no |`|BUGuJIk9aa	Yes I absolutely hate hate hate racist people. It really does anger me when I see someone judging someone based on the colour of skin. If you painted everyone blue it wouldn't change the person they are. The colour of your skin doesn't define who you are. |`|N53y9qohaa	Hello,<br>  <br>  No, I try to reason and educate them a little rather than go ballistic when the express their views.<br>  Well ironically East Indians and Pakistanis, anthropologically belong to the Caucasian race. The word Aryan that white supremacists and Nazis use actually refers to an area of Northern India.<br>  <br>  Just bear in mind that racism is not just a white Eoropean or North American man's problem. The Caste system, though made illegal over 50 years ago in India is still alive and well for example.<br>  <br>  <br>  Cheers,<br>  <br>  Michael Kelly|`|QRbCnBgFaa	i hate racism... it is pointless!<br>  people do it because they think one race is better than the other... which in fact is pointless.<br>  <br>  all the racism people can just all go to hell.<br>  Tell your brothers to ignore them and carry on with your life...<br>  <br>  have a nice day :)|`|104c298c569130856f8ea29d45c48c6caa	Racist people are small minded and ignorant people.  People are people no matter where they come from or what skin colour they are.<br>  It is very sad that some adults are so small minded and bigoted. They should be ashamed of themselves.|`|61f6e6f435d7885eb7d1dfffa67bff6daa	Hi,we live in a crazy world.When I was about 7 &  that was in the 50's<br>  a lady moved into our street she was married to a dark skinned man.It was the first time I had seen a different coloured skin to my own.Her son I played with him & thanks to him & his family I grow up to not be bothered about the colour of people's skin.I live in a town which is multicultural & we do not seem to have any trouble in getting along.People bully not just because of colour.I got called names because of my Auburn hair only I learnt how to stick up for myself &<br>  made sure bullies where not tolerated.Bullies are nothing but cowards & cannot stand on there own 2 feet.|`|o6dH6o6saa	I used to be often attacked by whites everywhere. When I was growing up, whites would attack me if I was walking down the street, police would harass me and teachers would ignore me.<br>  <br>  And because of that, I hate most whites today.<br>  <br>  I can't trust them, <br>  <br>  I don't think I am racist, but I might appear by most whites.<br>  <br>  After what happened to me and my community, I consider 99% of whites racist. Am I wrong?|`|h7qkIGsKaa	I don't hate racist people, but I hate their racist and stupid opinions and views.  And I hate bullying whether it is because someone is a different colour or fat or poor.  <br>  <br>  I try to hate the opinons and behaviour and not the person.  The person and their opinions are not set in concrete and can change.  So the person has hope and it is only their current stupid opinions that are to be hated.|`|gPez4ko4aa	I hate people like you who play the race card wherever and whenever they see fit. Every kid gets picked on at school, regardless of colour. How many white people do you know who get bullied by pakistanisand call it racism? Not many I'll give you that. Racism works both ways. It's not just white on black.<br>  |`|dSOfuO3Laa	Just like the 1st answer, they are taking over the world where I live too. Also, I do not hate anyone, but I do dislike how hard-headed and ignorant they are.|`|FsYUBf6faa	Yes.<br>  EDIT:<br>  Not to be rude or anything, but the boy was bullied with 'racist comments.' Somehow i don't think thats a new kid issue.|`|5G6GhO1vaa	Racists disgust me. They should be heavily fined.|`|eimToBI7aa	yes|`|xEmIhOc3aa	yes i do hate rasict people...because they hate us for things we can't change..just accept as we are..
