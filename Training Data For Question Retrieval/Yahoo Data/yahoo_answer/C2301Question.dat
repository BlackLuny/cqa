I'm a college student In my junior year working on my undergraduates degree; however I'm currently caught up in a terrible situation. Despite loans, state grants, and private scholarships, I'm currently having great difficulties satisfying college expenses. I'm a dependent, so much of the burden is also being carried by my parents. They were struck hard with the financial crisis and are now at risk of foreclosing on their house. I'm left to find the money on my own, but as a full-time student, my job is simply not going to cut the bill. I'm seriously considering dropping out but wanted to get some opinions first.

Question 9 (Multiple Choice Worth 6 points)      An author who is particularly humorous is said to have a style that is part of which element of writing?        Conventions and Mechanics        Organization        Sentence Structure        Word Choice and Voice                --------------------------------------...             Question 10 (Multiple Choice Worth 6 points)      Which writing elements help to make your paper grammatically correct and easier for the reader?        Sentence Structure        Word Choice and Voice        Organization        Conventions and Mechanics             --------------------------------------...             Question 11 (Multiple Choice Worth 4 points)      Which term means to write freely without rules?        Timed writing        Practice writing assessment        Discovery writing        Freewriting             --------------------------------------...             Question 12 (Multiple Choice Worth 6 points)      Why can’t writers only use spell check to edit their work?        Spell check has very few common words listed.        Not all computers have the recommended version 5.0 or higher.        Spell check can tell if a word is misspelled, but it cannot tell if a word is misused.        Spell check misses seven out of ten errors in most programs.             --------------------------------------...             Question 13 (Multiple Choice Worth 6 points)      Which statement best describes the topic sentence of a paragraph?        It connects one paragraph to the next.        It gives transition information for the next sentence.        It states the main idea of the paragraph.        It gives specific details about the main idea of a paragraph.             --------------------------------------...             Question 14 (Multiple Choice Worth 6 points)      When editing, how can a writer fix a sentence fragment or incomplete thought?        Read several sentences and combine them all into one.        Add more punctuation to the sentence.        Leave sentence fragments within your writing, as they are important in effective writing.        Read each sentence carefully to find the subject and verb, adding a subject or verb if either one is missing.             --------------------------------------...             Question 15 (Multiple Choice Worth 6 points)      Why should you replace “to be” verbs to improve your writing?        Since they are often misspelled, it is best not to use them very often.        Specific, lively verbs are better choices in effective writing.        Subject and verb agreement is more difficult with “to be” verbs.        They are misunderstood and should be limited in your writing.             --------------------------------------...             Question 16 (Multiple Choice Worth 6 points)      When you are peer editing someone’s work, what is the best way to help the writer improve the writing?        Be extremely critical and point out all the mistakes.        Be positive, constructive and ask questions for clarification.        Be sure to ask what version of spell check they are using.        Be sure to rewrite the main idea and supportive details for them.             --------------------------------------...             Question 17 (Multiple Choice Worth 6 points)      Which one of the following is NOT an example of publishing?        Posting the work in a Discussion area        Keeping a private journal        Submitting work to your school newspaper        Reading the work out loud

20090205085822AAhta3V	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	Freshman political science major -- should I be an attorney?	I'm currently a freshman at UMass Dartmouth and I'm majoring in political science. I absolutely love it.   For the longest time, I've wanted to be a lawyer. I just started doubting that idea last year. Should I still go on to law school? I make very good grades (I made Dean's List last semester) and politics is very easy for me, but I'm just wondering if law school is a waste of time and money. If I did go on to law school, I would want to be centered somewhere in New England.    I know the job market is pretty bad right now so getting an idea about available careers in law is a little tough. Any suggestions?   Also, if you have any suggestions as to which law schools I should look into or what fields of law would be the most likely ones to land me a job (I'm interested in environmental and corporate law, in particular), that would be a great help. I've been looking into Roger Williams Law, Northeastern Law, Boston University Law, and New England School of Law. Money isn't really an issue for financing my education, but at the same time I don't want to spend TOO much money, either.      Thanks for the help!

20090205090224AAWwAqH	Education & Reference;Homework Help	So, I have this English assignment... PLEASE HELP ME EDIT!!!?	Breath in, breath out.  Breath in, breath out…  I leaned up against the cold brick wall of the dark, humid hallway trying to keep my breathing under control; I was sure going to need it.  It was silent, all except for the slow and nervous breathing of the other seven girls in the hallway.  I wondered if they could hear the butterflies in my stomach, it was so silent.   I tugged at the zipper of my orange and black parka and pulled my arm behind my head, stretching out my tight muscles.  The girl next to me slouched to the floor and began stretching as well, the other girls soon following suit.     The starter’s horn jerked me out of my fog and I straitened, knowing that these were the last moments before the biggest race of my swim season so far.  Suddenly, my mind went blank.  What was I about to do?  What had my coach just said?  Did my suit fit just right?  I tugged at the straps on my tiny Speedo FastSkin, and then at the smooth fabric that was now a second skin to my thighs.  I let out a quavering breath and turned to look at the other girls, butterflies from my stomach now making their way up my throat.  It was me, the lone Tecumseh swimmer and the smallest girl in the room up against three Chelsea swimmers and four Dexter swimmers.     The four Dexter girls were huddled up together, whispering, probably about race strategy, and the three Chelsea girls were helping one another stretch. I shook out my legs, trying to be as intimidating as possible, if it even was possible.  The sound of loud cheers made us all look up and towards the single wood door at the end of the hallway.  One by one, the girls and I lined up in order of our lanes, one through eight.  I stood fourth in line, first seed.  Slowly the door opened and the cheers roared in my ears.  They sent chills down my spine and fueled the fire that raced through my brain.  A lady stuck her head into the hallway and smiled kindly.  I adjusted my cap and goggles and took a deep breath.   “Follow me,” she said and opened the door all the way.  Light flooded my eyes and we started walking.  The cheers got louder and I could barely hear the song I had picked.  As we walked out onto the cool pool deck, a line of Dexter and Chelsea girls screamed at their fellow swimmers.  I looked around and spotted a gaggle of Tecumseh girls at the very end, all of whom were screaming and as I walked by, I felt them slap my shoulder blades.  I smiled and, as suddenly as my doubt had appeared, it was gone, and a strange, overwhelming confidence filled my mind.  We reached our blocks and I stripped off my parka and dried off my block, my hand lingering on the “4” for a moment.  Slowly, I started tuning the world out so all I could hear was the sound of the starter.     “Finalists for the Women’s 100 yard Breaststroke, first seed Gretchen Seidel from Tecumseh, second seed…”  I closed my eyes.  I was ready.     “Don’t over think it,” I whispered to myself and then thought, “Great. Now I’m talking to myself!”  A silence crossed the pool deck until the sound of the pool was the only thing that could be heard.  I put a foot on the block and suction- cupped my goggles to my eyes.  I looked over toward the starter.  I stared him down as he raised the microphone up to his lips and opened his mouth.   “Swimmers, step up.”  I steadied myself and stepped up onto the block, positioning my feet on its rough surface, getting the best grip I could.  I pushed on my goggles one more time, just to be extra careful.  I bent over, dangling my arms, ready to grab the edge.    “Take your mark…”  Another deep breath… BEEP! I exploded off the block, and hit the water.  Every stroke, every breath seemed natural.  I focused on my lane and my lane alone, forgetting the race, just swimming as fast as my tiny body could move.  On the last length, I couldn’t see anyone close to me, but I kicked it into high gear and sprinted for the wall, the touchpad, and victory.  The excited whistling of my coach made my arms and legs move even faster and I slammed into the wall and looked up at the scoreboard.  There was aloud roar and I found my name.    “Seidel - THS - 2 - 1:12.56.”   I could have cried, but I didn’t.  I just looked at the girl in the lane next to me who was still looking at the scoreboard.  I slid over the lane-line and into her lane, lane five, the lane of the winner.  I realized immediately that we must have been dead even, hence my not seeing her…  I tapped her shoulder and she turned around.     “Hey, congratulations,” I said, sticking out my hand, and I smiled.

I'm leaning towards attending the University of Maryland in the fall, but I hear stuff about how it's such a hugeee party school, and everyone there gets drunk and stuff. People make it seem as though if you're not a partier, you absolutely will not make any friends.   And I don't party. At all. I mean, I don't mind a few parties now and then, but I would never, ever drink and I don't want to give in to peer pressure.      Is it true that if I'm not a partier, I wouldn't make any friends at UMD?   I'm generally friendly once you get to know me, but I'm certainly not outgoing. So I was wondering about your thoughts on this school.

There are two highschools close to where I live, and its been a tough decision on which one I should attend.      School A:   -In my district   -Most of the people from my school are going there   -Has an Honors, AP, IB* program (*:for juniors and seniors only)   -Has a horrible ice hockey team   -Has alot of racial/drug violence   -About 10 minutes from my house (I can ride the bus there)      School B:   -Honors program offered to all grades, AP starts at your sophomore year, No IB.   -Great campus   -Some violence (all highschools do)   -Some of my friends are going there (have to make some new friends)   -Great Ice hockey team   -15-20 minutes from my house (no bus, because Im not in the district, and my parents work)      Some things to consider:   -Hockey is a big priority (I might not be able to afford playing AAA next year, so highschool hockey might be the only option)   -Academics are a big thing to me (I want to do IB, but I could always switch over in my junior year)   -I could attend school A, but if I want to switch to B, there is a one year wait for district switching in academics.   -Does AP every year really boost, or is honors your first year just as good.

20090204220105AAd7UkO	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Opinion of this piece of writing?	I know this has some grammatical errors but I was wonder what people thought of the actual content.      I look at myself often. I see my legs, and face, and arms, and body everyday in the mirror. It never ceases to amaze me how I am a stranger to myself. Do not take this statement any deeper than it was meant to be, I merely mean that we see our friends and family everyday. We see them in our memories, and their faces are ingrained in our minds. We look to them in times of need and in times of happiness. We see emotion play across their faces. When, during these times, do we look in the mirror? When, at these times, do we see how our own faces look? Because looking at ourselves during times of happiness and stress are so rare, we become strangers to our own feature, our faces feeling foreign. I am not in anyway promoting vanity, but I find that we should know our own faces. Sure I know that my eyes are usually dark brown, I know that they change to green once in a blue moon, I know that my nose is very round and that my lips are perfectly symmetrical yet my ears are not. I know I have brown hair and braces, but what I don’t know is how I look when I show true emotion, true sadness, or true joy. I know who I am inside, I know what I like and what I want. I know who my friends are and who my enemies are. I know what foods taste good and which don’t. I know my personal restraints and limitations. I know who I am, just not what I look like.

20090205001031AA6pfBc	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Opinions, Ideas, Tips On My Story Idea?	Hey everyone,      Anyway I have to write a creative writing piece for my Yr 10 English, as our new teacher wants us all to write something so she can see what we are like when we write.      Anyway, I would like some opinions on my ideas, I decided to write a horror style story as those are the ones that I am good at.      1. The first idea I have is about a man with an obsession. He is a laborious kind of man who is obsessed about the human body (medically of course :D). Anyway, as his obsession becomes worse, he starts to create his own sort of way of thinking or "world" in his head, where it is rightful for him to murder other humans in order for him to study the human body. His obsession becomes worse and worse, and the reader gets to see the crazy ideas in his head about what a "hero" he is to humanity and how these lives are being given up "for science".      2. The second idea was inspired by those classic "escape from the room games" (when i was playing "Bars Of Black And White on Kongregate to be precise). Anyway, whats happened is that a person has shut themselves out from society, taking extreme measures to stay away from the community in general. They never leave their apartment and you get to see their condition getting worse and worse, and the person goes nuts and kills people who enter their home, ect. In the end, you find out that the person was in one of those padded rooms in a mental asylum the whole time, giving it a twist of some sort. If someone could tell me the name of this condition it would be very helpful.      Anyway, id appreciate your opinions on my ideas and anyways to improve them plus any additional hints and tips you may have.      Thanks, Soul

20090204224417AA94VjP	Education & Reference;Homework Help	What's your opinion on this short oral on an entertaining story about my life?	My task is to give a short oral on something funny/embarrassing/entertaining that has happened to me. I'd really like some opinions and improvements. I'm not known for my comedic skills so any help would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance.      Good afternoon class and Mrs. Buick. I’m here today to tell you a short, entertaining story about myself. I have chosen the following because my life stories are about as entertaining as an Antique Roadshows marathon so I found choosing a funny story really hard!       This incident occurred around 4 years ago, when I was still living in New South Wales. I attended Grafton Public School and every month we would have a huge school disco. This disco was going to be my final one before I moved. I asked my dad to pick me up at the end.       So I went to the disco that night and had a great time. At the end all the school kids have to line up along the school fence and identify their parents before they could leave. I searched the crowd for my dad. And there he was standing there looking for me wearing ugg boots and his daggiest pyjamas, covered in dogs and to top it off he had his pants pulled up to his bellybutton. I looked away quickly and as I did he came closer to the gate. The teacher asked if I could see my parent so I just kinda pointed at a bunch of people to the left of my dad.      Then all of a sudden I hear him yelling my name really loudly. I ignored him hoping he’d give up but he didn’t. He got as close as possible and then the arms started to wave around frantically trying to get my attention, by this time he’d already gotten 90% of the schools attention by yelling my name repeatedly and as loud as possible. I finally gave up and told the teacher he was my dad. As soon as we were in the car, I told him how embarrassing he was and he looked at me and shook his head “dads like me don’t grow on trees you know” and he was probably right, they usually swing beneath them! Thanks for listening.

Step 1: p pierce arrow p = not (p^p) = p         Step 2: (p pierce arrow q) pierce arrow (p pierce arrow q) = (p pierce arrow q) = (not(p^q))            That would equal p^q...right?      Thanks in advance for helping me. =D      REMINDER: Explain step by step please.      but if I'm right, then just add any comments to what I did.

These two have ticed me hither to this place,    A barren detested vale you see it is;    The trees, though summer, yet forlorn and lean,    Overcome with moss and baleful mistletoe.    Here never shines the sun; here nothing breeds,    Unless the nightly owl or fatal raven:    And when they showed me this abhorrèd pit,    They told me, here, at dead time of the night,    A thousand fiends, a thousand hissing snakes,    Ten thousand swelling toads, as many urchins,    Would make such fearful and confusèd cries    As any mortal body hearing it    Should straight fall mad, or else die suddenly.    No sooner had they told this hellish tale    But straight they told me they would bind me here    Unto the body of a dismal yew    And leave me to this miserable death.    And then they called me foul adulteress,    Lascivious Goth, and all the bitterest terms    That ever ear did hear to such effect;    And had you not by wondrous fortune come,    This vengeance on me had they executed.    Revenge it, as you love your mother's life,    Or be ye not henceforth called my children.       Thanks!

Would that be a more beneficial degree? Is a B.S. better than a B.A.?

Ok we did our English speaking & listening assessment today and we had to do a roleplay of a scene in 'of mice and men'.      i was in a group of 3 and i did practically all the work.      I did the plot   I did the structure   i did the script   i did the stage directions   i'm the only one who put any emotion into my lines    and i'm the only one who remembered the stage directions       YET I GOT THE LOWEST GRADE IN THE GROUP!!!      why? what did i do to deserve that?      The person in our group who got the highest did absoloutly nothing, destracted us repeatedly during rehearsal and messed up one of her lines. Why did she get the highest mark?      Also in the summer holidays we had to do an english booklet on 'of mice and men' she couldn't be bothered to do hers so she copied mine and despite the fact that the vocab was clearly mine and the parts about the depression were all answered by someone who quite clearly does history (me) not someone who does geography I GOT THE MESSAGE SAYING DO NOT COPY!!!!!!!!      AND i got higher than my friend in the exam and all but one of my courseworks were higher than hers (i didnt do well on poetry) but other then that it's all A*'s A's and one B but for our predicted grades SHE GOT PREDICTED AN A AND I GOT PREDICTED A B!!!!      What do you think is this totally unfair?   i'm not trying to be mean she's a great teacher but it's so infuriating when that happens.

Is it possible?    The largest internet portal in my country offered me a very good salary for a web designer position. But even I enjoy it I don't want to do only designing. I am an engineer and I want to do engineering stuff. I want to do research, invent stuff, teach people what I know, write books etc... I don't just want to go to one direction and leave music or drawing. I'm scared of loosing my talents.    Please give me some advice. (I'm 23)

I want to have options but i feel like its way too late. i'm suprised i haven't been kicked out of my school my grades SUCK. My average in math is so far a C my Science grades maybe a D!! English: B Philosophy B+, History C, Language B-. I'm involved in school musicals and stuff and i'm good but i don't have enough passion for it to make it my goal in life. There's just nothing about me that would make a college want me. I have been in a slump for like 2 years, i'm one of those people that the better i'm doing the more motivated i am. But things just keep going down hill and i have adhd and dyscalculia but i can't take meds bc  they make me depressed and i become even less productive. Since my grades suck i'm grounded and can't see my friends who all go to different schools and i need them because i basically have no real friends at my own school. Its really small and everyone there is so dramatic and always getting in fights there all miserable so i'm distant toward them bc  i really cant handle that stuff. I know it seems like the basic solution is GO WORK. but there is so much i just feel like i cant catch up. how do/did you get through your schoolwork? i'm in a huge slump please any practical advice? I need something to make me want to work bc i just can't. i can't even describe it i feel like i can't work i sound like a lazy ***** right now but seriously i want to do well. I hate being he disappointment of the family, not ever seeing my friends, and just feeling like a worthless failure. What can i do have you ever felt like this? if i by some miracle manage to shape up is it too late for a college like NYU to accept me?

At the end I asked her if she would like to go on a date. We went on dates and I fell in love with her. I could stare at her all day and not get bored. I have a great time with her. The only problem is she's 30 and Im 20. My parents kinda don't like the idea. We continued to date and it's been great. I started school and I walked in to my history class and she was there.

For my AS English coursework option 3, I had to write a piece to entertain, and we were given 4 different styles of entertaining writing as a basis, but which kind we chose was up to us, it could be any of the four, or anything else.      The four styles we were shown were "A Life in the Day Of," a monologue, a radio drama or a piece of travel writing. I originally planned on doing a monologue, but in the end it kind of turned into a short story in the form of the first person who is a footballer who after a bad tackle in the Champions League final may have ended another player's and life, as well as his own career.      For the piece, we have to include a style model, and produce a commentary analysing my piece, and so I need an audience for the piece to feature.       Does anyone know where I can find a suitable source for a short story to feature, as well as a style model to use.      Need some help asap, will be much appreciated!      Thanks in advance.

For some reason, I felt that skates should be skate. But the book clearly states that its correct as it is.       Also is there much difference between Australian and American Punctuation and Grammar?       thanks alot

20090219122412AAg8oFz	Education & Reference;Words & Wordplay	Is the sentence grammatically correct?	Singing other birds’ songs, a mockingbird is a harmless creature that makes the world more pleasant.      its part of an essay im writing for english so here is the rest of it incase that helps:In To Kill a Mockingbird Boo Radley and Tom Robinson represent mockingbirds. Singing other birds’ songs, a mockingbird is a harmless creature that makes the world more pleasant. "I'd rather you shoot at tin cans in the backyard, but I know you'll go after birds. Shoot all the blue jays you want, if you can hit'em, but remember it's a sin to kill a mockingbird."(p.69) When Atticus tells Jem and Scout that it is a sin to kill a mockingbird he is refering to Tom and Boo. It is a sin to dislike Tom and Boo based on the town’s opinions. Boo Radely is a mockingbird figure because he was a kind person, yet he is persecuted by the people of Maycomb for being shy and coming out of his house.  Although Boo Radley is misunderstood and feared, the truth is he is indeed helpful and causes no harm until it is absolutely necessary. He leaves two pieces of gum, Indian heads, and string for Scout and Jem. Just as Boo Radley represents a mockingbird so does Tom Robinson. Accusing Tom Robinson of rape is like shooting a mockingbird. He risked his own safety by helping Mayella, and he did it because he felt sorry for her. An innocent being fell victim simply for existing, having done nothing wrong." "I seen that black ***** yonder ruttin' on my Mayella." (p.73) Chopping wood and helping Mayella Ewell were his only mistakes. He, just like a mockingbird never caused anyone any harm. Tom Robinson and Boo Radley were kind people only wanting to help but in the end were persecuted by the town because they were misjudged.

Okay, so I have a lengthy question...if you would answer, that would be great...if you don't have time, etc., that's fine.  Thanks.      I will be going to college next year, and I have already finished all of my college applications (the schools are all in the state that I am living in now).  However, since we are planning on moving to another state now...maybe California, I was wondering how I would go to college there...would I have to wait an entire year to apply? Just so you know, I have applied to good ranking schools, and if I am going to California, I would like to apply to the same caliber of schools...so, I was thinking about the UC schools or USC...what are the policies?  Can I transfer after a semester? Would I have to be a resident? To go to the UC schools, would I need to enroll in a California community college?  I'm not sure what to do...but since we are not sure whether we are going to move in state or out of state, I would like to make sure that I know everything about my schooling situation, etc. in order to make the best choice.      Thank You so much.
