20090129084331AAPM1OP	Sports;Horse Racing	Expert riders (Horses)?	so last summer i ad been having lessons. And this particular day someone was riding one of my instructors horses whilst she watched. My instructor started telling me the girl riding was off to get a education soon and she wasn't sure wat she was going to do,so i said i would be happy to help, and well she didn't seem interested to say the least. Anyway i didn't really think much about it, now winter is coming t an end i have started having lessons again and she says my riding as really come on. which got me thinking does she not want me to ride her horses cos she thinks im not good enough, anyway she was saying again today she needed to start and bring her horses back into work again i said i would help n again she said well hopefully this other girl will be around a bit more soon. so all that led me to the question of wat makes a good rider. I mean i have a good seat my hands are soft my lower leg does swing a bit and sometimes i get a bit nervous and i could do with being a bit stronger in my leg but that's about me. what i want to know is What makes a good rider i understand everyone has a different style but as an all rounder  What is a Good rider?

20090129085626AAZYh8I	Sports;Boxing	Why are so many people doubting Pacquiao vs Hatton?	I know Pacquiao loves the opposition of being the underdog but this wouldn't be the case if he was someone else?  He has shown massive improvement over the past 3 fights in 2008 and is the current P4P King.  Yet, others still are on the band wagon to have Pacquiao lose.  Is it cause he's taken down so many "better" fighters?      I don't think it's a walk in the park like others keep insisting.  Hatton is dangerous but Pacquiao has proven to be extremely dangerous as well.      I vote on Pacquiao due to his abilities and hopefully he can get rid of Hatton and move on to the formerly-retired Pu**y Boy Mayweather!

I can't remember exactly what NFL game it was, but a WR fumbled the ball forward when his teammate recovered the ball for an extra 4 yards.

There wouldn't really be a way to tell would there?

20090129091126AAk0db4	Sports;Boxing	Plaster of paris and boxing don't mix. why?	I am a Dental Lab Technician. I play with plaster all day long. Plaster breaks easy unless the stone is super thick. Plaster of paris comes in powder form and is mixed with water. takes about 45 minutes for plaster to set. takes 24hours to set to it maximum strength. Once plaster is set it becomes hard. However if exposed to a moist environment it will weaken and crumbles easy. That is why doctors  tell the patients to not wet the cast. Now in order for Margo to use plaster in the gloves mixed with gauze, it has to be thick like more than 1/2 inch in thickness and keep it dry. No plaster used, take my word, read my lips.

20090129090815AAOJzQN	Sports;Wrestling	What do Triple H's fans see in him?	Triple H has one of the worst finishing moves in WWE (pedigree).       He lacks athleticism (Undertaker is older but more athletic).      He still does that lame DX "chop" even though DX itself is extinct.      He is called the Game (what's so awe-inspiring about that? If it is, call me Monopoly or Scrabble).       He has that terrible entrance gimmick where he stands on the ring-apron and spits water up and out his mouth.       He is the beneficiary of nepotism (courtesy of the McMahon's).      He calls himself the "Best" [in the WWE]! Huh! He is not even the best "Paul" on Smackdown. Paul Calloway (aka Undertaker) is better than Paul Levesque (aka Triple H).      He makes his entrance with what is supposed to be the aura of a fearsome Viking god (Thor or Odin) but then enters the ring and proceeds to make wise-cracks. Viking gods crack skulls, not jokes!      And for someone called the "cerebral assassin" you'd be surprised how many times he prematurely turns his back to an opponent that he's just defeated only to get clobbered by the same opponent from behind after which a third guy (whether Edge, Kozlov, Big Show or Khali) enters the ring and beats him up further! Cerebral?      Triple H ain't no Edge! Edge is the best!!!      But to his credit, Triple H at least has the looks of a wrestler.      BTW, all you HHH fans specifically, and face-fans in general, just remember that this is what us heel fans do - just as heels beat up faces, us heel-fans diss faces and their fans.

He's been surprisingly soft-spoken and quiet. Everytime I see JBL with HBK backstage, he's not really screaming or badgering him like I'd expect. He just kind of looks at him with straight face and is quiet these days and leniently gives him orders. Seems like Joey Styles must have punched him good.

No one has shown that much character except for Peyton Manning (and Manning was rich so it was much easier for him).     In fact, Bradford, McCoy, and Williams all came back though they were all scheduled to be in the first 15-20 picks in the NFL Draft!     Do you think he did that just to shut Texas' whining up once and for all next year?     I predict another 65-13 game like OU beat Vince Young's Texas team in 2003.   Do you agree?      P.S.

20090129095056AAygMWH	Sports;Volleyball	How can I encourage my volleyball teammates to set me?	Hi there!      I play recreational sand volleyball two or three times a week with a mix of people from different cultures -- Finland, Colombia, Argentina, but mostly guys from India (I am a white gal from Texas). None of us is that great at volleyball, but we are good enough to have several good points a night.      The ongoing problem is that when I am on a team with the guys from India, they sometimes get into a super-annoying routine of only setting each other and of hogging the ball.       This is super-frustrating because I set really pretty well, and I will set everyone equally. But when the guys set, they often clearly play favorites, picking each other over any girl they happen to have on their team.      If they were the best hitters ever, maybe that would be OK. But they are wildly unpredictable, so the girl can be standing there wide open, ready to spike, but the guy hitter will get the set ... and hit it straight into the net. Or way the heck out. Lather, rinse, repeat.      I feel like this is primarily a cultural thing, and there are some language barriers between us, but I feel like in the international language of volleyball and good sportsmanship, they need to knock it off.      I am outnumbered, and I need them more than they need me. Any advice on how to get my message across without sounding like a brat?      Thanks!

20090225131336AAIEz7s	Sports;Basketball	Why do people make a big deal over career Total Points?	All that really proves is that you were able to play for a long time (which is good). That doesn't mean that you are a better scorer than someone you have pasted on the scoring list. Kareem Abdul Jabbar is the All-Time Leader in Points but he's not a better scorer than Michael Jordan or Wilt Chamberlain. So what's the big deal about having the most total points, assist, rebounds, steals, blocks, & etc?.....Because it doesn't mean that you were the best at it.

I heard on the radio on the way home from work, the deal that Zetterberg is about to sign with the Wings.......12 Years for 72 Million...it also mentioned that he is 28 years old. My first thought was how it might be a little long for a player that age and that these deals are best for players who are younger.....goalies and Dmen might be a small exception because they often have a little longer shelf life. The other thing that came to mind was how it sounded similar to the Mike Richards deal........and it is......Mike Richards signed for 12 years and 69 Million so my question is..........       As the GM of your favourite team, you have an opportunity to sign either player, they have both given you the outline of what they want and you can only afford one........       Mike Richards 22 Years Old @ 12 years for 69 Million    Henrik Zetterberg 28 Years Old @ 12 years for 72 Million       Who do you choose? Why?

All you duffers out there…  I’m sure you agree with this poem…       In My Hand I Hold A Ball,       White And Dimpled, Rather Small.       Oh, How Bland It Does Appear,       This Harmless Looking Little Sphere.          By It's Size I Could Not Guess,       The Awesome Strength It Does Possess.      But Since I Fell Beneath Its Spell,       I've Wandered Through The Fires Of Hell.       My Life Has Not Been Quite The Same,       Since I Chose To Play This Stupid Game.       It Rules My Mind For Hours On End,       A Fortune It Has Made Me Spend.       It Has Made Me Yell, Curse And Cry,       I Hate Myself And Want To Die.       It Promises A Thing Called Par,       If I Can Hit It Straight And Far.       To Master Such A Tiny Ball,       Should Not Be Very Hard At All.       But My Desires The Ball Refuses,       And Does Exactly As It Chooses.       It Hooks And Slices, Dribbles And Dies,       And Even Disappears Before My Eyes.       Often It Will Have A Whim,       To Hit A Tree Or Take A Swim.       With Miles Of Grass On Which To Land,       It Finds A Tiny Patch Of Sand.       Then Has Me Offering Up My Soul,       If Only It Would Find The Hole.       It's Made Me Whimper Like A Pup,       And Swear That I Will Give It Up.       And Take To Drink To Ease My Sorrow,       But The Ball Knows ... I'll Be Back Tomorrow.             Stand proud you noble swingers of clubs and losers of balls....       A recent study found the average golfer walks about 900 miles a year.       Another study found golfers drink, on average, 22 gallons of alcohol a year.       That means, on average, golfers get about 41 miles to the gallon.       Kind of makes you proud.   Almost feel like a hybrid.

20090225112603AAud5iA	Sports;Running	Does running with bad shoes lead to damage?	If I were to wear thin martial arts shoes and go running on pavements or hard surfaces, would there be damage to my knees or legs? I heard that if I don't wear running shoes to take in the force of running then eventually my knees get problems. I mean logically when you land there is force, so if you have thin shoes more force goes up your leg, then surely your leg gets stronger, not weaker...   OK let me sum it up: Does running without "running shoes" cause knee or leg damage?

Is lubrication of the firearm mechanisms a separate step?      Would you say it cleans better or worse than a good cleaning the old fashioned way?      Many thanks in advance.

I live in Chicago and although this is not the coldest place on the face of Earth, I have difficulties finding ways to be active. Now there are quite a few problems: 1- I hate Gym. I think work out in gym is boring. 2- I love walking but besides the cold weather sidewalks are mainly frozen or not easy to walk on. I already had my second falling incident this year and don't wish to break any bone. 3- I am not an active person. My body is not flexible and my reactions are too slow. I tried racquetball and the result was so depressing! So, no small balls involved please! And also since being the last person is not fun, I don't like competitions. Because if it is between individuals, I am always the last and if it is between groups I feel guilty for causing my team to lose! 4- I don't know how to swim. Yeah, I know. I tried. 5- I am over age of 30 and have problems with Allergies and Asthma. That is actually one of the reasons I was so far from staying in shape.   Well, there are good things to mention. I eat healthy. I don't smoke. I use my bike in Summer. I have access to a good sport facility.   So, if you can think of something, please help!
