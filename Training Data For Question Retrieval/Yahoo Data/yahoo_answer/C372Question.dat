I had them cleaned and have even bought covers for them which helped a lot - but the arms of the couches are sagging and oddly shaped - looks to me like there was a lot of sitting on the arms which made them flat and saggy. This makes it really difficult for the cover to stay in place!     How can I fix this myself? We want to save up and eventually buy new couches together but for now these will have to do.

We plant in this area the end of May or even the beginning of June.    Is there anything else we should do or check with using this ground?

20090205133643AAbIF8L	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	I have a question about water leaks and who's responsible.?	My husband and I bought a trailer last year a fixer upper for our family. Before we could move in we had to pay the back rent of the previous owners which at the time I didn't care but now it's bugging me that it wasn't my responsibility to do that in the first place! But now the landlord is putting in water meters so we can pay for our own water. Fine not a problem. We had frozen pipes which busted my outside water line plus the water meter. I called the water department to have it fixed in which they won't because it's not switched to them yet it's the landlords responsibility. I called the landlord which is sending someone out but called me to tell me that if I had frozen water lines and it busted because of that it's my fault and I have to pay for it. Now... my question is...is it my responsibility to fix this leak regardless of how it happened or is it the landlords problem?

20090205115435AAy8dnV	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	Hot water heater wiring?	I am replacing my hot water heater with one almost identical to the old one.The old one had a black and a red and a ground wire. The new one is the same. They are both 50 gal electric. The new one trips the breaker(basically it won't even let it engage). I assume my water heater is bad. It is a dual element like the old one was. Of course I am filling the heater with water before I try the breaker. The wiring in my house has a black and a white and a ground. I hooked the black to black and the white to red and the ground to the green ground screw on the heater. I also verified that the ground from the heater was secured tightly. I looked on the info labels of both heaters and verified that they are the same. I forgot to mention that the old one did work just fine but it was 15 years old and time had taken its toll on it. I figured that it was just a matter of time before it gave me trouble and I was remodeling the area where it is located. The house is actually an old mobile home that I bought and am remodeling so I can move to the country. What kind of voltages should I read between the black and white and ground wires in the trailer? I think it read about 240v between the black and the white. Thanks in advance for any help you can provide me.

20090205115425AAZS7pi	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	Damp and mould problems with my windows?	I live in a rented house which has wooden double glazed windows. the were fitted about 20 years ago. the landlord has never maintained the units( it is the landlords responsibility ). as a result the exterior paintwork is badly flaked allowing the elements to soak through. the inside of the frames are in a poor state with mould there seems to be different types of mould. most of the mould is black but there is also small patches of a white coloured mould on top of the black mould. cleaning the frames makes little difference as it just comes back worse than before. anti-mould/damp paint is not an option as surfaces need to be dry to apply and my frames are basically rotting. in one room i also have a white/grayish growth between the panes of glass.   can any one tell me what types of mould i have and whether it can be a hazard to my health? am i likely to encounter airborne spores?   my landlord assures me that they will replace the windows but im not holding my breath, or maybe i should. please can you help me identify my moulds and advise me of the risks.

I was given a Dining room set from my uncle over a year ago.  it was from the 1960's but in ok condition.  it had some water stains etc so with the help of my mom, i sanded it, cleaned it, primed and painted it all black this was all well over a year ago (i used an expensive paint i might add so it's not a problem with cheap paint)   anyways it looked amazing like something out of the ikea catalogue!   however now i'm having some issues with it.  the other day i lifted up a card that was on the buffet and the paint was missing, and the primer underneath was wet and goopy.

20090205121409AAUTsYS	Home & Garden;Garden & Landscape	Neighbor removed drainage ramps from my yard?	I had some work done on my foundation in my front yard.  End results, some dirt was added the drainage pipes were extended.  This was completed about 2 weeks ago.      Well, the other day I notice the drainage pipe had moved.  I found it odd but thought perhaps the wind did it.  I moved it back.  About 15, 20 minutes later I came back out and it was gone.  I looked around and it was over the fence in my backyard.      I went and knocked on my Neighbor's door.  I asked him if he did this.  He said Yes.  I said why.  He proceed to make serveral racial slurs about the men who performed the work.  How I should have informed if prior to having any work done on my property.  And how the water was going to drain into his basement.  Ruining his basement and belongings.  This is the first I have heard of any of this.  I have lived here for almost 7 years.  I am on a hill and his house does sit below mine.  My response was why couldn't he come talk to me about this.  He replied I am never home.  I told him I was home often and if not, he could always call.      I told him this work was performed by professionals, I had a work permit and their was engineer involved.  This was not something I did myself and I had mentioned to the contractors that the water could not drain into my neighbors house.       He was very intimidating and deaming to me.  Telling my house was a piece of crap and lastly that I would be getting a warning from his lawyer.      He also mentioned a drainage pipe, further up, that I had replace at least 7 months.  He said I was going to have to remove that too.      I have contacted the company that did the work.  They think my neighbor is being unreasonable.  The engineer is coming back out next week to look at the situation himself.      Meantime, I am stressed and upset.  I am single with 2 kids.        I do not want to talk to him.  There was absolutely no reasoning with him the other night.  I ended up walking off crying.      What should I do?

I am painting the whole house all different colors. The color on the walls now is a really light like tanish yellowish.

One of the spare rooms has crayon and marker all of it. What should I do? The only dark colors I am using is a burgandy and a burnt orange only on one wall in the master and spare...it will not be on all walls, should I prime those walls? Should we do the trim first or walls? Some people say do walls first then trim and some say it the other way...I am confused big time...haha..      We are trying not to spend a whole lot of money on this stuf....but don't look like it's going to happen...      Where can I get KILZ prime in the spray can?
