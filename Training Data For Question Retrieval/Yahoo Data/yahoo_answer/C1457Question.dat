I used to be sure that they should, but I've been doing some thinking and now I'm not as sure.    I know nowhere in the New Testament is there a command that Christians refrain from violence, but it seems to be implied. There are a few verses in the Bible that speak of leading "quiet and peaceable lives" and of domesticity (not just for women, mind you, but on the whole).     I'm not saying that God will condemn a Christian who's been forced into warfare or something like that, but in your opinion should Christians join the military on their own?     NOTE: If you or a loved one is a Christian serviceman/woman, please do not think I'm trying to condemn you. I'm just curious what people's opinions are.

20090205193330AA1fRLn	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Are relationships necessary to make life meaningful?	Right now I'm a 21 year old college student. My major is International Economics/Business, and I'm not really that happy with it. Yeah, I am semi-interested in it, but it's not what I want I want to do with my life. The problem is, I don't really know what I do want to do. I just don't know that I'm not doing what I want to be doing. Honestly, I don't get enjoyment out of many activities. Part of me actually wants to drop out of college, but I only have a year left, so it's not an option. I just don't know what I want to do. I feel that even if I do get a great job...so what? I'm going to be a wage-slave my whole life and then die. We're all going to die, so what's the point. But it's sort of reassuring that we're all going to die, because it leaves us more freedom to do whatever the hell we want.   Another issue is that I've never been in a relationship, which doesn't bother me so much. I also have no desire for sex. So perhaps I'm asexual. I think society puts way too much emphasis on relationships. People think that if they don't have someone they are incomplete or a loser. Why can't people just be happy alone? Why can't people be happy with themselves? I think there's more to life than relationships and love. What's with society's obsession over love. Because when it comes down to it, if you're not happy with yourself, and don't love yourself, you're not gong to be happy in a relationship. Relationships are not a cure to make yourself happy.   Between school and relationships, I'm just at a very confused point in my life. Society's typical path of good career, marriage, white picket fence, kids is not for me..   On top of everything, I have an extremely overbearing mother who won't stop telling me what jobs to apply for and what to do with my life.

I don't want to sound racist either, but is this a cultural thing among black people? A black girl I go to college with has an 11 year old son, and she talks all the time about how if he gets a smart mouth with her, she'll punch him in the chest and knock the wind out of him. She seems to think this is an acceptable form of discipline... A while later my 9- year old brother proceeded to tell me and my mom about how his friends get "chestized" (yes, the parents have a cute name for it...) when they act up.. sure enough, that means they get punched in the chest. The little boy showed my brother the bruises. Yea, he's black too.....

20090205173738AAYROAL	Society & Culture;Etiquette	Why is my husband so upset with his birthday gift?	It was my husband's 24th birthday last week.      A couple of weeks before his birthday, his truck started having engine problems and he expressed his desire to have a new truck for his birthday.      So, the day before his birthday, I sneaked out of the house to go on a little birthday errand. I went to our local Dodge dealership to look into purchasing a new Dodge Ram, where I nearly fainted when I saw the price of those things. Oh my goodness! I did not know they were THAT EXPENSIVE! I began to rethink buying him a new truck.      I left the dealership and headed to a make-up store, where I bought a couple of different kinds of make-up that I liked very much. I figured that he would like this gift very much, as he might like the look of this expensive make-up on me.      So anyway, I came back home and left it in my brand-new (and also very expensive) Ford Expedition. In the middle of the night, I snuck out of bed and to the garage. I retrieved the make-up, wrapped it up in a very nice, pink box with purple wrapping paper and a bright yellow bow, and put in on top of the good of his truck. As I finished and locked up for the night, I thought to myself, "OH, I CANNOT WAIT TO SEE THE LOOK ON HIS FACE TOMORROW!!! " I then went back to bed, hardly able to sleep, as I was very anxious.      Well, the next day finally came. He woke up to the smell of a hot waffle breakfast along with sausage, eggs, and an ice-cold cup of chocolate milk, his favorite. He seemed very pleased, saying, oh, you are the perfect wife!!! We then made out for 5 minutes. After breakfast, we took a very nice, hot shower together for about an hour. We took a trip to the beach later that day, and we spent some good time together. As the day ended, we headed back home. I, along with a little of his assistance, made him his absolute favorite meal, grilled steak grilled with honey-Bar-B-Q sauce. It was an incredible dinner, the 2 of us absolutely loved it. After dinner, we had a great 2 hours of sex without a condom (I think he got me pregnant).      Then, it was time to open presents. He had to go to the bathroom really fast, so I sneaked out to the garage really fast to make sure everything was ready. This was going to be perfect!      So, my husband was standing right beside me, and I said, ready to see you gift? He couldn't wait, and I led him to the garage. I could see the excitement building in his eyes, and he said to me, oh, you shouldn't have, honey!      I put my hands over his eyes as I took him into the garage. I turned him to the direction facing the gift, and said, "One... Two... THREE!!!"      I moved my hands and he just stood there, shocked. At first, I though he was excited, but then he just said, "Oh." He opened the present, and at first, I thought he really liked I had gotten him, but then he turned around and slapped me in the face really hard and said, "Why did you have to get my hopes up so high!?!?!?" He stomped his way back inside the house, and I later heard him crying in the bedroom.      He hasn't talked to me ever since, and he still wont talk to me. What did I do????????????

20090205175116AAReb3P	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	What's wrong with you idiots?	How can you call yourself a good parent when you try to kill your kid everyday? that's right, i'm targeting cigarettes. All the time i see parents with 8 year olds, 5 year olds, hell i've even seen little babies who do'nt even look to be over 2 years old, in the backseat while mommy's puffing away at a cigarrete in the front of the car, here are the problems with this:      1. The kid has no choice but to sit in the back, windows rolled up because it's cold, no other way to go anywhere, but to breathe in that smoke.      2. This is putting the kid at risk for cancer and other diseases, not to mention problems breathing when he's around middle school and up.      3. This risks the parent of dying and breaking the kid's heart.      4. distraction from the road, could crash and burn.      5. Infants people, they don't even KNOW they're being hurt for God's sake.      6. isn't that against the law now in many states? if not, it should be. in fact cigarettes should be just as illegal as marijuana, cigarettes kill a LOT more people than that illegal crap.      and i've seen little kids who's parents smoke imitate them, pick up a candy cane, puff away and say "i'm smoking" i told one "no, that's bad, you dno't want to smoke" they say "mommy smokes". that really ticks me off, come on parents, these are your kids, if you really care about them, put it out, quit, nicorette gum, i don't care, just stop smoking!      are you green, smoking puts harmful greenhouse gas in the air.      it hurts people you dno't know, smoking in a restaraunt or outside wal-mart? people walk past, they don't know you, they don't like the smoke, don't force them to eat fast-food to go when they want to go to a nice breakfast place with the family and have a family breakfast.      and wtf, if a smoker hates the smell of other people's smoke, why the crap do they smoke?      bottom line STOP SMOKING, it's rude, inconsiderate, deadly, stupid, i could go on for hours.

My question is this:  Can I be arrested or have charges against me for speaking dirty in this chatroom, as a minor?  I didn't ask anyone for real life sex or anything, it was all just online and cybering with people that stayed completely anonymous, as I did.  I'm actually quite worried that the police could trace my IP or something.

I'm 16 and i consider myself to be the best looking guy at my school, and so do most people at my school.  two of my friends and one of my best friends growing up have come out as homosexuals, but i still hang out with them.  I change infront of them and the slap my butt a lot and whistle when i take my shirt off and stuff like that, but they know where the line is and not to cross it.  And even though i would never, NEVER hook up with a guy, it actually makes me feel even sexier than i already do knowing that straight girls and gay guys think im hot.       Yesterday my straight friend came up behind me and started dry humping me (totally joking around) and then we hugged (again, totally joking) then these seniors who i hang out sometimes and were like "is he gay too? why do you hang out with f*gs so much.. especially since they all wanna f**k you?"  then i told them how im not homophobic and how it doest bother me that they think im hot and they said something like "wow, thats pretty gay of you. maybe your bi"      I honestly don't care what those seniors think of me and what they are gonna go saying about me, and i also know that im completely straight for the fact that im only sexually/emotionally interested in girls.  but out of pure curiosity... in the GBLT community would a guy liking the fact that he is attractive to gays make him Bi?

"I do set my bow in the cloud, .... and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh" (Gen 9:13,15)      If it was indeed a local flood, god promised mankind that he will never send another flood, which is completely false if he is referring to local floods since they happen all the time.       Whats your explanation to this?      Also, if you believe it was a world wide flood how do you explain the fact that the oldest tree in the world is 5,000 years old?

20090205191539AA851gB	Society & Culture;Community Service	Please help me come up with a name!?	I recently did my clinical for CNA. I noticed that many of the residents were bored out of their minds and felt really bad. The majority had many children and lived their lives taking care of people and homes. Now they sit and watch T.V. Land all day - it isn't as great as you might think. So I decided to bring my baby to the nursing home so they can hold him and play with him. The residents and staff love it. I really want to find more mothers to join me so there can be more babies to go around, but how creepy would it be to put up a rambling flyer asking to take babies to the nursing home?!   I want a name for this so more people would be interested. I appreciate all answers!

20090205194351AA5pi9q	Society & Culture;Languages	What is the main idea in this paragraph?	What sentence contains the main idea?      Almost all insects will flee if threatened. 2Many insects, however, have more specialized means of defense. 3Roaches and stinkbugs, for example, secrete foul-smelling chemicals that deter aggressors. 4Bees, wasps, and some ants have poisonous stings that can kill smaller predators and cause pain for larger ones. 5The larvae of some insects have hairs filled with poison. 6If a predator eats one of these larvae, it may suffer a toxic reaction. 7Insects that defend themselves by unpleasant or dangerous chemicals gain two advantages. 80n one hand, they often deter a predator from eating them. 90n the other hand, predators learn not to bother them in the first place.          10Other insects gain protection by mimicry, or similarity of appearance. 11In one kind of mimicry, insects with similar defense mechanisms look alike, and predators learn to avoid them all. 12Bees and wasps mimic each other in this way. 13In another kind of mimicry, insects with no defenses of their own mimic the appearance of stinging or bad-tasting insects. 14Predators avoid the mimic as well as the insect with the unpleasant taste or sting. 15For example, syrphid flies look like bees but do not sting.          16Another kind of defense based on appearance is camouflage, or the ability to blend into surroundings. 17Many kinds of insects and animals have distinctive color markings that make them difficult to see. 18Predators have trouble locating prey that looks like its background. 19An insect is more likely to survive and produce offspring if it is camouflaged than if it is not.

After reading a lot of these questions on this site I noticed a lot of questions asking about why certain profile's are the way they are. Ex. Are blonde's really air headed? Why do black guy's treat white women so bad? and How come fat women are nicer and thin women are conceited? We come in all types of different backgrounds, colors, size's, and beliefs.  We can't take one experience and judge all as the same. When we do we cut ourselves off from meeting and experiencing so many other wonderful opportunities. Not all white, black, mexican, chinese, fat, skinny, rich, poor, brunette's, curly, glass waring, and whatever kind of profile one may be doesn't make all in the same group alike. It is sad to see so many people who close their mind based on one experience they had and judge all to be the same. A closed mind lives in a small world and misses out on so much this big world has to offer. Things that make you go Hummmmmm

20090205195739AAlv8mi	Society & Culture;Mythology & Folklore	How do you know you are a psychic vampire?	I have read some of the 'symptoms' online but it is too confusing. I have however noticed that I have a lot of the same things. These are my symptons: I am moody, I get very anxious and jumpy with a feeling of needing something I guess you could say but never finding something that makes me feel better, when I get into verbal fights I feel empowered a little more (that's the best way I can describe this feeling) I get very tired for no aparent reason and dizzy at the same time, my eyes have gotten sensitive to the light, I'm psychic and very empathic, I have a a low immune system and I constantly get sick and I can see auras. I know that there are real vampires other wise I wouldn't be asking this question and I have done research and my friend is a sang vampire. He has left on a trip for a while so I can't ask him. I have been to a doctor and they have told me that nothing is wrong and they don't know why this happens. I really want help on this and if you could email me please about it that would be cool but you don't have to. Oh and would the changes I be experiencing such as the fact that I'm tired more and my appetite has changed be part of the awakening if I am one? I do not want anyone telling me there is no such thing I won't pay attention to it anyways. I also put it under this category because I know its where more people will find it.
20090205200019AA64ahS	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Can someone resolve this biblical contradiction about God tempting or not tempting people?	James 1:13 says God doesn't tempt "any man." ("Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man. ")     But here we have: Genesis 22:1 "God did tempt Abrahmam." and 2 Sam 24:1 "And again the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel, and he moved David against them to say, Go number Israel and Judah." not to mention Matthew 6:13's appeal to God in the Lord's Prayer to "Lead us not into temptation." (Unless we're praying to satan instead??)    Thoughts from Biblical inerrantists (Is that a word? Well it is for now...)

20090205200352AAItLI3	Society & Culture;Etiquette	Annoying friend!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!…	ok so everyone has a friend that is sooo annoying but he is nice and that is why you deal with his annoyance. ok i can live with that, but my friend went from annoying to envious and not giving me space. i say envious because he is always looking for a chance to point out any flaw that i have. he does! and i had enough!!! but i told myself u have to be nice. so i have been dealing with this for a long time.   .........But today he crossed the lined. we have science together, so i was the last one in class, and he waited for me, so everytime he does that i feel obligated to hang out with him. so we went to PE. out side of PE i was talking to some girls, and my friend Scott, he said that Badminton wasnt that hard and that it wasnt as girly as he thought. so i told him, Yeah at first i sucked at it but now i can play decently, then the annoying friend interrupted, he smirked and said, *you cant even serve* i told him that i could, that last time i played with him(2 weeks ago) i couldnt but now i could. he insisted that i couldnt, he was getting on my nerves. he said that i served over hand and that that was illegal. so in my head i thought of saying" your illegal" but it would have been immature n why bring politics in? so i kept my cool, but he kept on picking on me, so i told him that he was always annoying, that he was always trying to feel better that n me. then my other friend told me your bitchy. then my other friend told me in front of everyone that i should punch him and thats when Scott got in between us. the bell rang and we got into our class. he ruined my day.   ..... and i know he is envious because i can sense it. it got stronger when i flirted with the girl he likes. and that girl found out that he likes her and she told him harshly that he was a loser and that she would never go out with a guy that looked like a toad. that girl flirts with me and i just feel that he holds that againts me.   What should i do?????? i thought of attacking him verbally like he has, but that would be immature. but i feel that if im quiet he will feel victorious. also we have a lot of friends in common, and thats a problem. what should i do????????

For people to say that shes doing this just for the money is mean. To say someone chooses to have a big family just for the money is mean. People see Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt who have six kids together as doing a good thing becuase their giving kids a home. Yea but also becasue they have money. Who says you have to have lots of money or a big house to have a big family. It was her choice and she was given the chance to raise all these amazing kids. I wish her nothing but the best!

I'm only asking due to the hormone oxytocin. It is the hormone that promotes the release of testosterone and gets the sex-drive going. It heightens sexual experience and can be released through touch or presence. In woman it reacts to estrogen promoting the psychological predilection of cuddling. Do men like to cuddle as much as woman and woman how often do you defy your biological "sanctions"?

20090203070451AArbHQB	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	AN HONEST question for Creationists...(I'm serious)?	OK, I know I've been a bit hard on you guys this morning, so I'll stop.      I have a real, honest-to goodness question for you guys.      Everyone, even the most die-hard Creationists, agree that "micro-evolution" is real, that species will adapt to their environment. (It took you guys awhile, but I will give you credit for that) However, from what I understand, you guys draw the line at "macro-evolution", where species can evolve into a seperate species which cannot interbreed with the first over thousands and millions of years (Like Homo Rhodesiensis to Homo Sapiens, for example).      You state a lack of evidence for this claim.      However, can you guys help me out here for a second?   Assuming   1. ALL things are possible with God, including macro-evolution, and   2. Macro evolution DOES exist      How would we prove it? If it takes millions of years to occur, you obviously cannot "see" it, so what proof would be sufficient for you guys?

The problem is that I'm atheist and I know that church youth groups sometimes don't focus highly on religion, but it would still probably play a large factor and I wouldn't feel comfortable discussing my actual viewpoints on religious issues if we have a group discussion, especially in a group full of people who would be overtly religious.      I would probably end up not participating in any discussions and just agreeing with the majority opinion so I wouldn't create a stir or draw attention to myself, and I don't feel like doing that either.      Is religious discussion a large focus within church youth groups, or is the focus more on socialising, etc? Do you think I should go and see what it is like, or are most church youth groups pretty lame anyway and I shouldn't waste my time with them?

20090203072224AARiWXE	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	How do we explain that the most important religions came from men with great messages?	Some try to explain religions in terms of the fear of the unknown or similar possible weakness of mankind. They are in denial of the facts. It is very unlikey that a lot of people will rally for a long time around a single messenger because of that. The explanation must take into account the messenger and the message. No message could rally so many people for such a long time without a great value for mankind.. Yes, we see some sects based on fear or stories about aliens, etc., but they are small and they will never create an imporant lasting religion.  The source of the most important religions were messengers with a message of great value.  This suggests that if religions today appear as fairy tales or simply unpractical doctrines or philosophy, it might be that the original practical message of these religions that could rally so many people is now lost.

I'm all in favor of being friendly, and taking the time to stop and visit with others, whether it be at work or home or elsewhere.      What I don't understand though, is people who spend EVERY SINGLE MOMENT of their lives in a non-stop frenzy of gossipping and giggling and texting and hysterics and "he said she said" and blah blah blah.  In some cases, they literally spend more time talking than breathing.  I'm not kidding.      And they talk about the most meaningless things . . . every thought in their head is blurted out, no matter how trivial.  It's like a twisted form of "thinking out loud", although, I don't think they actually think before they speak.  "I'm hot.  I'm cold.  I like gum.  Purple is a pretty color.  I like shoes.  I took a dump this morning, and it was in the shape of Elvis."      What is it with these people?  Is it simply severe immaturity, or is it some sort of personality disorder?

20090203071847AAqkOPm	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Do you think you could write something like the Book of Mormon?	Here is the Book of Mormon challenge that a professor gave to his students at the beginning of a semester.      "Since Joseph Smith was younger than most of you and not nearly so experienced or well-educated as any of you at the time he copyrighted the Book of Mormon, it should not be too much to ask you to hand in by the end of the semester (which will give you more time than he had) a paper of, say, five to six hundred pages in length. Call it a sacred book if you will, and give it the form of a history. Tell of a community of wandering Jews in ancient times; have all sorts of characters in your story, and involve them in all sorts of public and private vicissitudes; give them names--hundreds of them--pretending that they are real Hebrew and Egyptian names of circa 600 b.c.; be lavish with cultural and technical details--manners and customs, arts and industries, political and religious institutions, rites, and traditions, include long and complicated military and economic histories; have your narrative cover a thousand years without any large gaps; keep a number of interrelated local histories going at once; feel free to introduce religious controversy and philosophical discussion, but always in a plausible setting; observe the appropriate literary conventions and explain the derivation and transmission of your varied historical materials."      "Above all, do not ever contradict yourself! For now we come to the really hard part of this little assignment. You and I know that you are making this all up--we have our little joke--but just the same you are going to be required to have your paper published when you finish it, not as fiction or romance, but as a true history! After you have handed it in you may make no changes in it (in this class we always use the first edition of the Book of Mormon); what is more, you are to invite any and all scholars to read and criticize your work freely, explaining to them that it is a sacred book on a par with the Bible. If they seem over-skeptical, you might tell them that you translated the book from original records by the aid of the Urim and Thummim--they will love that! Further to allay their misgivings, you might tell them that the original manuscript was on golden plates, and that you got the plates from an angel. Now go to work and good luck!"      They finished the translation about 80 days after they started, but history shows they only worked about 65 of those days.

20090203071027AAuNpGB	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Is the acceptance of Evolution a significant move?	Ever since the theory of evolution was first published, it   has engaged in a creative dance with religion. In the early day’s traditional religionists were enraged by it. With time many sects of Christianity realized it was here to stay and found ways of cohabiting with it.       Eventually even the Catholic Church came to accept it.
20090203072205AA2PM2i	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Is the theory of evolution under assault?	especially in America?      Not in the universities, where it deservedly   reigns supreme, but in the schools, where the   vast majority of minds are intellectually formed.      Opponents of evolution have so far lost most of the legal battles, but they may be winning on the most important battlefront: in the classroom. They are making so much fuss and furor that many teachers are pulling back from teaching any aspect of evolution.      That’s a shame, because evolution is the most embracing field of biology, and the most exciting for   young minds fascinated by dinosaurs and their fiery mass extinction.       The study of extinction leads seamlessly into our modern, ongoing, human-driven mass extinction,   and how we treat the planet, with all that this implies for   consumerist lifestyles.

These are the ones who wrote up his teachings after he died. If these are the ones who messed up his teachings, then how do we know what his teachings really are? (Perhaps they merely meant his much later followers, but that's not messing up his message, which remains in the NT) Also, what IS his message anyway? Take into account passages like Luke 12:46-47, Matt 10:21, Matt 10:34-36, Mark 4:11-12, and others. I'm sure you all have Bibles (King James of course...) next to you so actually looking these verses up should be no great effort if you don't already know them by heart. So do respond to these types of passages and tell me how they fit with the usual view of Jesus the pacifist nice guy that so many think of when they think of Jesus.

20090203070843AAeNKkQ	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Did David Attenborough LIE?	David Attenborough said these worms can ‘only reproduce by entering [someone’s or something’s] eye’. However, the lifecycle of the creature to which he was referring shows that invasion of the eye occurs only in heavily-infected people (&, presumably, animals the same). Yet according to        http://plpnemweb.ucdavis.edu/NEMAPLEX/Ta...       & SEVERAL other NON-Christian websites, the life cycle does not involve invading the eye at all.       While this still leaves us with the problem of why a good God would make such horrific disease-and-morbidity-causing parasite, it does show the invasion of the eye to be neither necessary nor even usual.    So, the question is: Did David Attenborough lie, or does he not know his subject as well as huge numbers of people believe he does?      See below for any true Christian’s attitude to David Attenborough’s propaganda, and his spiritual blindness (which has far more serious -- indeed eternal -- consequences than physical blindness):       http://www.answersingenesis.org/articles...        Why does God allow the innocent to suffer? See:    http://www.christiananswers.net/q-eden/e...       Please, keep your answers on the subject.

I read this article www.time.com/time/asia/covers/1101020805... before but couldn't quite believe it until I actually saw a few little korean kids all about 10 years of age who had received cosmetic surgeries to alter their eyes during my short trip to Seoul. When I saw the girls I had to confirm my Korean guide, and she said yes. She also added that the reason they get surgeries at such young age is mainly because they want to leave their "pretty" faces on their first graduation books... I was shocked and somehow outraged. What kind of sick culture would make such young kids to think "being pretty is the key for all success" and they need to get their little faces screwed up if they aren't pretty?? What the F*** their parents are thinking????? It's just sickening...

" What kind of role model are you as a mother to say that about people to your daughter!" She then said " Well, its a free country". I pretty much just walked away. I mean I've never been insulted like this in my life. Am I taking it to hard?Oh, i forgot to mention. I had my two siblings with me and they were a bit loud but that's just how kids are.

20090205212151AAlsdnR	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians, Do you believe me or Not? Tell me why?	I prayed for the Devil for 2 years straight, I figured that I could save many people if I could save the devil! Then God told me I was praying for Every Human being and I didn't even know it, He told me to read the Bible and see who rules this world, I read and saw that we do! He told me that He could have called Us a Bad word but He doesn't talk like Us, so He called Us devils and demons. Told me the Serpent is our Flesh, He told me that is what we fight against...the things our flesh wants to do...He said to me,"Kevin have you ever been at your Parents House and before they went out they told you not to touch something?"...I said,"Yes Lord." and He said,"Didn't you touch the very thing your Parents said not to?"...I said,"Yes I did." He said,"You even told yourself that you won't get in trouble, but you did get in trouble, Didn't you?"...I said,'Yes I did Lord." God did have to say another thing to me...I know who we are now! I take full blame for my sins and Jesus knows I am telling you the Truth! I did everything evil that I did and no devil made me do it, the flesh did! I repented and Follow God Now!         AMEN!

20090205212902AAjD4pE	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Catholics, I need some help?	So today in my religion class, we are now in semester 2 which is the study of Hebrew Scriptures, so we were talking, and then we learned that the people of Israel, I think, were being invaded and controlled by many other empires. And they questioned God, and said why. So then I looked at my Bible, which is a new version, and my priest/teacher showed the dates everything happened. But then he said the dates were leading from the time of creation through the dates. Then I asked "But I thought we weren't supposed to take the Bible literally" and then I didn't receive a clear answer. So what can you give me to be a clear answer? Thanks, should the Bible be literal, and should we believe the dates? Thanks again.

Be a very wealthy non famous person in america or a person who lives in a another country (like in the Caribbeans) for free and doesn't need money to survive.       Like some of my friends family come from many different islands (Jamaica, Virgin Islands, Dominican Republic, etc) and they say that they own their own a lot of property and there home and eat a lot of healthy foods and smoke a lot of different but natural herbs. Worry free life.       However, if your wealthy and live comfortable in the US that's pretty good too. Even though the food here is unhealthy (even the fruits and vegetables in the supermarket), what we smoke is harmful (not natural or and modified), the society we live in is based on fear and death.

20090205214024AA7T9Az	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Are there any Baptist organizations that say the Holy Trinity is three persons in one essence?	I was wondering because I heard some Baptists get mad at Jewish accusations of polytheism, saying that Baptists believe the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are not three different person in one spiritual being or essence, but rather three manifestations of the same person.  I know that that the Nicene Creed said that's the Modalism Heresy, and by definition is not believing in the Holy Trinity.  So I was a little confused, do Southern Baptists believe in the Holy Trinity?  I know Catholics believe in the Holy Trinity, and Methodists do too.

I'm sorry, I don't mean to laugh but.. Oh my God, I came across a few christian websites that teach kids dinosaurs actually existed at the same time as humans. Apparently, these people call themselves creationists. It's not enough for them to believe that God created everything (which is fine, I believe in God too), but they interpret the bible so literally that they believe God created the universe in 7 days.. You know, because 7 days can't mean anything but 7 days.. It can't mean 7 billion years, or something..    I remember hearing a few years ago that some of these people are actually fighting to have this taught in our public schools. I realize that it's not all Christians, just these right-wing Evangelicals.      Here's one of the sites    http://www.creationists.org/mananddinos....

In some cases, in some states, a child of 14 years of age can and will be tried as an adult.  What is the basis on the judgment, is age not a factor anymore?  If it's believed that he was in the right state of mind to commit the crime, or the right state of mind to make a decision to commit the crime.  Then shouldn't 14 year olds be allowed to smoke, marry, have sex, drink, buy cars, get jobs?  If they are in the right state of mind to commit a crime and get tried as adults, should 14 year olds not be treated as adults, and given the right to do "adult" stuff?  Or we as a society turn a blind eye and deny them to be adults, but when they get tried as adults we agree, that they are in an adult state of mind?

I have been debating on whether or not I should tell my best friend that i've head over heels fallen for her. About a month ago I informed her, and only her, that I was bisexual. She said it brought us closer, and she 'truly' loved me. Lately she has become distant, but that's besides the point. For Valentine's Day I was thinking about maybe telling her. I have written sweet letters to her, but actually given them to her. I was thinking about maybe giving her one. I also made a video where it had a song of ours playing, and I was writing her notes (It's hard to explain). I don't want to mess up our friendship so I don't think I will give it to her, but the idea is something I enjoy pondering. Do you think I should tell her or give her the letter? I       was planning on telling her after I get my braces of so I have perfect teeth (I get them off in three montsh). I was going to whiten my teeth, buy a Louis Vuitton bandana, wear skinny jeans, put on a stylish tank, chanel sunglasses (maybe), and tie the bandana around my neck. Then when I look the best I can, maybe, tell her.

20090205212004AAhBpGm	Society & Culture;Etiquette	How does eye contact make you feel?	I like to keep eye contact when I speak to people. With my friends and family it's very easy, but sometimes I feel like I make people nervous. When I speak with friends or acquaintances at school, and I keep eye contact with them, they are constantly looking away or at their feet. Should I not keep eye contact with them? This situation is difficult for me because I feel like I should stop looking them in the eye, but at the same time trying to find something else to look at makes me feel like I'm being rude.    Also, lately I feel extremely nervous around my professors. I have a lot of respect for them and when I speak to them one-on-one I am so incredibly nervous. I have never been nervous like that before, and I find that my biggest problem is deciding where to fix my gaze.      What should I do!?!   How does it make you feel when someone keeps eye contact with you?

20090205212231AApkxtf	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why do I have pressure on my forehead?	When I hear of this common symptom of a person having pressure on his or her forehead they are commonly associated with migraines. However, when I have this pressure on my forehead it only happens when I'm praying, receiving a blessing/sacrament, and it usually appears when I am in the presence of a person or place that may be commonly regarded as 'holy' places or people. I have asked several priests and religious advisers. I have also looked up some information on my own on the net, but I have not gotten very far (and yes, I have looked desperately for scientific information as well) but for some reason I still have this pressure at certain moments. It does not hurt, it only tingles me. I have found out that there are only two other people who have the same symptoms I do when we are doing the very same types of things. Might anyone have any clue as to what this may be?

Seriously answeres only...NO CHIMPOUTS      I need this answer for a homework assignment.      ? Of the nearly 770,000 violent interracial crimes committed every year involving   blacks and whites, blacks commit 85 percent and whites commit 15 percent.   ? Blacks commit more violent crime against whites than against blacks. Fortyfive   percent of their victims are white, 43 percent are black, and 10 percent are   Hispanic. When whites commit violent crime, only three percent of their victims are   black.   ? Blacks are an estimated 39 times more likely to commit a violent crime against   a white than vice versa, and 136 times more likely to commit robbery.   ? Blacks are 2.25 times more likely to commit officially-designated hate crimes   against whites than vice versa.   Gangs   ? Only 10 percent of youth gang members are white.   ? Hispanics are 19 times more likely than whites to be members of youth gangs.   Blacks are 15 times more likely, and Asians are nine times more likely.   Incarceration   ? Between 1980 and 2003 the US incarceration rate more than tripled, from 139   to 482 per 100,000, and the number of prisoners increased from 320,000 to 1.39   million.   ? Blacks are seven times more likely to be in prison than whites. Hispanics are   three times more likely.

20090205214736AAnEfH0	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	It is my passion, but is it his?	I hate that I can't ask God this and receive a response in a second.  My passion has always been natural science and stuff.  When I'm out in his creation I feel great.  Now not necessarily as a vocation, but I really like hunting and mounting butterflies...like a lot.  Have been doing it for a couple of years.  And when I'm out in the field, I feel God's precense and a sense of freedom.  But at the same time, sometimes when I'm at home researching the stuff, I get this, heartache like, "YOURE DOING EVERYTHING WRONG" yelling at me.  So its a hobby that I feel really passionate about and would have a hard time doing anything different.  I worry I'm wasting my time and nearly get in tears sometimes because I don't know what to do. When I'm through traveling through here I want to be glad I lived for Him.  And for some reason there's this gist that as a Christian you have to witness and spread the Gospel.  By no means catching butterflies as a hobby will ever bring glory to him.  While I have lots of unsaved friends, I find it nearly impossible to witness to a Catholic or other religion.    So what do you think, is catching butterflies serving God or just me and will amount to nothing?  Or is God telling me I should change something somewhat?

I am aware that the axis forces were a threat to peace  And then christians say They are secular ,they have respect for other faiths,you should stop acting like Hypocrites .why should every body believe in the bible and christ and not their own faiths.Muslims have a same belief those who are not muslims will go to hell what is difference between your basic beliefs

However in this question:    http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...       Many atheists argued that the Bible is not a trustworthy source for knowledge of history, science or morality.      If the Bible is not trustworthy in several distinct fields, why would theology be the exception?  In other words, *if* God exists, then why wouldn't the Bible be just as inaccurate and incomplete about God as it is about history and science?
