1e39e4ff5ad6a9ea20311bd72097c1aeaa	Liano says it's a recycling business.  Are the wedding gowns used?  The site he uses says that they specialize in minerals.    They also are on a site for oil painting reproductions...copies, not recycled.  It's listed at the same Lisle address:    http://www.reproduction-oil-paintings.co...    This business has no record with the Better Business Bureau.  Bad news / good news because that means they are not a member but that nobody has complained to them about HHY.  The name implies that they are in the import business. Ask where alterations will be made?    I would advise having a seamstress or someone familiar with dressmaking accompany you to check out fabric, hems, and workmanship.  You don't want the gown falling off while you're walking down the aisle or dancing with your dad and new husband.|`|QCkanmR9aa	http://www.recycle.net/trade/aa1089358.h...    nope it comes up a recycling company

If you live in an apartment that means you are a renter and not an owner. Renters are second class citizens and don't enjoy all the privileges that us owners do. You do know that as a renter of an apartment you are not allowed to vote, get married or hold a real job. Twice a year during the solstice, owners are allowed to run through the town and capture renters and sell them at auction. The winter solstice is coming up in two months so you had better stay inside, but stock up on food first because you are not allowed to order any.|`|G9Vsyy1daa	As long as you have an address the post office and/or UPS delivers to and a credit card, you should be able to order anything you'd like online.|`|EMoL87yZaa	yes|`|UM01RK0Caa	wats d problem d guy is gona knock on d door n u answer n u sign n get ur stuff lol|`|6oXKCC1Baa	yes as long as u have a unit  |`|M73nsTXuaa	yes you can as long as you give them adress and apratment number when orderiing said caps you can order anything anywhere as long as your not on the street living-hope that helps you order you caps|`|baf4liItaa	Yeah just give your apartment number and it should be fine.

1e39e4ff5ad6a9ea20311bd72097c1aeaa	Today is the last day to buy things that are overstocks, out of production, out of style, liquidated, etc.  It sounds like an enormous flea market that you have to pay to park and enter, stand in lines, and lug purchases around through a crowd.  If that's what you're looking for...go for it.  Today would be a good day for bargains since the vendors will not want to take anything home.    Remember, everyone pays at Rosemont.  It's a big venue with big vendor fees and admission for buyers.  Vendors are there to make $$$ not give things away.  It makes you wonder how much mark-up there is in retail.

AleT38EYaa	It depends on what you're looking for and where exactly you want to live.  There are still some prestigious zip codes (Shaker Heights) where I'm sure the prices will always be inflated.      I have a friend trying to sell her condo built in 2002 in Brunswick.  It's nice and she's offering a great deal on it (she has to move out of state for her husband's job), so I know you can get nice houses for cheap.      I think the Cleveland economy is about comparable to Detroit's right now.|`|5SgBAgwVaa	I think our area is as depressed as yours is.  Our property values have gone down slightly in the suburban areas---not hugely, because they were low to begin with.  I wouldn't recommend buying in the city of Cleveland proper.|`|4e846120a30e765fcdf27eaf5fa85b62aa	Regardless of the economy, property values in Cleveland have always been lower than Detroit including the the city's outskirts.
