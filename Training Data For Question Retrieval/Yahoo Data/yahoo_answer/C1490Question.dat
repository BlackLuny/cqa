THIS IS A LETTER I AM WRITING TO MY BEST FRIEND   WE'VE BEEN FRIENDS FOR TWO YEARS NOW AND I REALLY LIKE HER. SHE KNOWS I'M GAY AND I KNOW SHE IS BI.

No, it's not something bad - just rather personal. Don't take me wrong though- I only say this because I know you won't break up our friendship. Okay... look.... I'll spit this out now. I think that I've fallen from your charms. A long time back, even when I assumed you were straight. Hoewever, I do realize you don't like me in that way. But for me - I can't control my feelings... I've always thought of you as my second part and I wished you were mine. What you think of me now is up to you, just please don't hate me.

20090222145242AAjurah	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Prophecies of St. Malacy?	They speak of a final pope, Petrus Romanus, after Pope Benedict, and after his reign, will come the end of the world.   But scriptures specifically stated:   "But of that day or hour, no one knows, neither the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father. Be watchful! Be alert! You do not know when the time will come." (Mark 13:32-33)      26"Just as it was in the days of Noah, so also will it be in the days of the Son of Man. 27People were eating, drinking, marrying and being given in marriage up to the day Noah entered the ark. Then the flood came and destroyed them all.       Luke 17:28-30   28"It was the same in the days of Lot. People were eating and drinking, buying and selling, planting and building. 29But the day Lot left Sodom, fire and sulfur rained down from heaven and destroyed them all.        30"It will be just like this on the day the Son of Man is revealed.    Seems to indicate that it will happen out of the blue, no indication.      So if Jesus does not know, why would this be revealed to st. Malacy?      please, no anti catholic spam.
20090222145254AATA9pv	Society & Culture;Etiquette	Do You Ever Take Shoes Off In A Restaurant or Store & Put On Top Of Your Shoes?	I was waiting outside in the seating area for a table to eat at after church with my family. I was wearing a nice dress, and a pair of high heeled thong sandals. I put my toes over the thong straps.        A hostess, waitress, or whatever (I don't know her job) comes up to me and says "You got only one warning. Put your shoes back on all the way or we're going to ask you to leave."      It wasn't like I came in barefoot, or holding my shoes. My feet were not even touching the ground. I just had my toes out of the thong strap piece.      My bf's mom was pissed at hearing this lady yell at me. Then this lady yelled at someone else who was standing with one of their feet out of their shoes while paying for their meal.      So we went across the street to IHOP instead.      Does anyone else do this? Why do people take this so seriously? Someone putting their toes over their flip flops does not ruin the Chicken Kiev sitting in the oven at 400 degrees. Has anyone else been yelled at for this?

From the article;    "The bill declares that "any organism with the genome of homo sapiens" is a person protected by rights granted by the North Dakota Constitution and state laws.      So, essentially, it will now be illegal for men to masturbate or for women to menstruate, since both spem and egg carry the genome of Homo Sapiens.   Luckily, Canada is close to North Dakota so women who still understand that their body is THEIR body can come here and get the abortion they need.   But why did ND decide that women's rights needed to be trampled on like this?

My junior year in high school there were only a handful of girls who were openly bi. My senior year it seemed like every other girl was dating another girl. I know it sounds like a major exaggeration, but that is just about the way it was. I have been graduated for a few years and my little brother is just now in high school. The other day he was telling me about how so many of the girls he went to school with were either gay or bi, and how he wasn't even sure whether or not to approach girls for fear of them not being interested in males. What caused this influx of bi-sexual girls? These past few years the number of young bi-sexual girls has seemed to multiply uncontrollably. What is going on?

20090222151949AAcDdJK	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	People who believe in a personal God, how do you define your belief?	That is, I have found that people tend to approach the matter or the belief system in itself in two different ways. Those who have love of life and seem to direct God towards their own desires in living, in which having a personal relationship with God seems to revolve only around themselves, and then there are those who approach it in a different manner, in such a way that they are seeking God and not matters of living, they are not seeking wealth, power, or sensual pleasure, and their relationship with God is also personal but revolves around the general whole, that even when they ask Him for favors, it is not out of seeking the material itself but out of seeking Him and performing their duties toward others.      Thinking about it in the second form makes such personal relationship takes a different context, it takes the context of uniting all under the worship of One.      How do you define your own belief system?

The days of creation were probably not 24-hour periods.   5. We existed as spirits before the Earth was created.   6. All people, whether good or evil, will be resurrected.   7. The Bible as we have it today is imperfect, and contains some errors.   8. Those who live in serious sin should not be granted full fellowship until they repent.   9. Premarital sex, extramarital sex, and homosexual sex are all sinful.   10. One must believe in Jesus before receiving baptism.   11. Baptism must be performed by immersion.   12. Miracles, healings, and speaking in tongues still occur today.   13. Salvation in the kingdom of God is dependent on the grace of God.   14. Salvation is also dependent on the works of the individual.   15. The church has deacons, bishops, elders, pastors, and other ministers.   16. Christ is the head of the church.

We've asked them twice to keep the bass down and the last time they rolled their eyes and turned it off.

We've talked to the police department and they will send an Officer out to speak to the neighbors.  I'm not trying to make enemies.

Me being a black women was thinking...um....wouldn't any women want a man with a job?      Like he said when he was wasn't doing well many older white females were willing to take care of him. He said one homeless black male got off the streets because a white women took him in...something a black women wouldn't do.      He did make sense and I have seen it only twice...so I can't say all. But he did. He said white women are more forgiving.  He brought up our next door neighbor who he had talked to.  He is a black male who has not worked for over a two years and stays home as his white wife works long hours....something he said you won't find a black man doing.

Putting aside all moral arguments and basing your answer on just science, why wouldn't a fetus be it's own individual?       When conception occurs, a baby/fetus with it's own set of DNA and it's own genetic blueprint is born. Basic biology. Doesn't the fact that it has a different and unique set of DNA show that it is its own individual? If you don't think it does, who is to decide the timeline until the fetus actually becomes an individual with the right to live?

20090222113406AALZpTf	Society & Culture;Languages	English grammar? Help please!?	Can you check if these grammar constructions are good?      1) Noisy as a pack of dogs, my neighbors move off to Valparaiso at night.      2) The children got out the school happy about the end of the season.    I don't remember if a comma is required. Do you know it?. This is and adjectival phrase (I think)      3) Charles, rich as a businessman and glamorous as an actor, couldn't catch his beloved's attention.   Is the appositive correct?      4) We got in the stadium ignoring the check-points.   Ignoring explains an action happening at the same time. is it the ing- clause good?   It suggests that they would've paid for the ticket but ignored the check points.      5) We got in the stadium by ignoring the check points.   The method they used to enter the stadium was ignoring the check points. (is the prep. phrase ok?)   if you write a comma before "ignoring" it still carries the same meaning as with "by"      6) With a pair of earplugs and a mp3 player, a person could get deaf in six months.   I know one can change the Prep.Phrase order depending on the emphasis you're giving to the sentence. :D right?      7) Maria made very bad decisions afraid of what was gonna happen.   Could you explain these constructions?. I'm not sure if they're correct.      Ufff, I hard a really hard time studying this. Hope it's fine. DON'T doubt to correct me if i'm wrong.

With Atlantis being in the news/public eye recently, is it possible that something could have evolved into human like beings or beings with around the same level of intelligence or potential intelligence of modern day, land dwelling humans, but living in the oceans rather than land. Would they have to be a mammal or other species needing air to breath , or could fish with human intelligence be possible that can build etc. underwater?       Aside from the posibilty of aliens, could an extint race have built an atlantis who originated from earth or is it only really possible than humans built atlantis (if there is one) with some technology we do not know about today? I really can't get my head round how there could have been an atlantis and if there was, who the inhabitants/makers would most likely be?

This boy is about 8 and he screams with like a high pitch, loud wail, sometimes for an hour more at a time and late at night.  After a while I hear the mother yelling at him to stop screaming, but it seems to have no effect.      I'm not sure what I can do as I'm sure the parents have talked to the boy.      This is an apartment building with thin walls.  Should I complaint to the landlord?  The parents?  Or just grin and bear it?

I was thinking about what i believe in and i think that all "myths" come from some sort of facts... Here's what i was thinking....      Aliens- I do believe that there are some life forms on other planets, not necessarily green people who speak in clicking noises and fly around in round space ships, but other people defiantly.      Wizards- I believe that there are some people who can move objects around or can do things. Not necessarily with a cape and a wand but a few specific people might possess special powers.      Vampires- Here's where i have some trouble. I think there is/was some vampires in the world, i do believe there is very few. Although i think it would be cool if there were the twilight/buffy vampires in the world i don't think there are. I think that the ones who do exist just want to be left alone and that is why you don't hear a lot of stories on the news or whatever.      Well, that's what i think, i would love to hear your opinion.      and thanks for reading!

No offense to anyone. peace.      Im a junior in High school, and My Family (especially my mom) is very Catholic. I haven't considered  myself catholic since my freshman year. Im agnostic. But my mom is pressuring me to be confirmed and that, to me,  will mean defeat.      My mother isn't a bad person but the last time I hinted at not being a good catholic (prop 8 issue) she flipped out. She was drinking and the next morning she yelled "Your never going to that school again" because "The Liberal teachers are putting this **** in your head". (granted 4/6 of my teachers are catholic and believe in the same **** she does).      Whenever I did something wrong she never blamed me. She blames someone else for "corrupting my mind" or influencing me. When I was young and never got in trouble, I kind of liked it. But now, I feel disrespected.      This really sucks because my best friend is an atheist (she thinks they're all the same) and might call him, or his parents, blame him and never let us hang out anymore (Im out of a ride for the rest of the year)(also me and my best friend have something stronger than normal. We're Blood Brothers. So we will still hang at school).      I hate being controlled, I've been very depressed since a horrible experience called "steubenville". I cant keep lying to my mothers face.    How do I tell her? How Can I confront Her about it?

An amateur treasure seeker finds shiny golden flecks in a rock and because they want to believe that it's gold they think that it is. Then they take it to the survey office and are told that it's really iron pyrite or "fool's gold".      Is that a good analogy for the specimens that have been put forth so far as being transitional fossils? The people finding them want to believe that they are transitional but then when more evidence comes in it turns out that their faith was misplaced especially when it comes to human beings?       http://www.allaboutcreation.org/human-ev...

20090222133123AA4TU92	Society & Culture;Languages	Does anyone else find the runic letters of Old English are what make it tough to read?	If you've done any studies in Old English, or even had any exposure to it you'll know what I mean. I'm not talking about the language of Shakespeare and the King James Bible (early Modern English), or even the language of Chaucer and Gower (Middle English). I'm talking about the language of Beowulf in the original manuscript. Many words aren't used anymore and only bear a passing resemblance to our modern words.      But anyways, the question is, did anyone else find Old English completely unintelligible at first, but then look at a Latin transliteration and find it to be somewhat easier to read? Reading Old English in the original text for me is an arduous, but I find it as easy to read as Frisian (the only mutually intelligible language with English, unless you count Dutch and Plattdeutsch having semi-intelligibility with English) when transliterated using the Latin alphabet. Infact some of it is as easy to read as Scots (which I consider a dialect of English, but some consider a seperate language). Of course, it helped me a lot to learn the runic letters, but I couldn't have picked up and read something in Old English naturally without training without a Latin transliteration.

20090222135001AAhMoxe	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	In a world lacking a deity, do you believe that the ways of bad people will catch up with them?	Obviously this question is directed to Atheists and Agnostics.      Do you think that because bad people harm society as an example that sooner or later they will have to "atone" for their behavior?      Will they get caught by the law?  Will the husband/wife they cheat on leave them and get it all in the divorce?      Even though we don't believe in a deity, can we still believe in justice?

20090222141132AA30AdK	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Question about God removed.....?	I had a question removed yesterday.   I posted a link to a clip showing poverty stricken children, and asked how it can be said that a "loving god " allows this to happen?    The clip was shocking at times...but it is the reality of life for an overwhelming number of the worlds population. To simply deem it offensive and have it removed is to bury ones head in the sand.I can only say that it was removed due to the complaints of those who found it too challenging to compose a reasonable answer.    It is offensive. It is offensive to human kind.    But it does not answer my question.   How does a loving god allow a tiny, emaciated child to wither away in the sun, while a vulture sits eagerly awaiting the moment of death in order to pick the child's body apart??   How does he allow a child to be so thirsty that he stands behind an animal trying to capture a little urine to drink?   You bet it is offensive.      How does a loving god allow it?    Seriously?

20090222131758AAiw7J0	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Should non-Christians be taking the Bible from hotel rooms?	I was speaking with a Christian individual whom had just returned from a vacation. In his room there had been a book in the drawer, but it wasn't a Bible. It was "The Teachings of Buddha".      I asked if he read it and he said no. Instead, he proudly explained that he took the book with him when he left the hotel. Once home, he tore the pages out, burned them, and then threw out the cover. He says it was not stealing because it has to be something of value to be considered stealing, and that no one should read it anyways.      So I'm curious... should non-Christians be doing the same with any Bible they find in their hotel rooms in the future?

I am agnostic atheist (which means I accept that there is no way to prove or disprove God, but I don't believe in God) but I went with her anyways. it was teen night, and all they did was push religion on everyone all night long. they gave us each like ten of these cards advertising the church and told them it was our duty to put one in every locker in school. I would REALLY hate it if I found a card telling me to go find God in my locker, and I would not put them in lockers. Besides, I think it's very wrong. Let people think what they want to think.          So the odd thing was, I went to a Sunday service there too and it was COMPLETELY different than Teen Night. it was like a normal church. so I'm wondering, were they trying to, for lack of a better word, brainwash the teenagers because they are easily manipulated?

I was simply reading The Idiot's Guide to Buddhism and there was a paragraph to this effect -       "The Buddha taught that all things are impermanent. Nothing lasts. All things are born and then cease to exist. Mountains, seas, castles, plains, and especially humans are all impermanent."      Then a few pages later it said something like "The Buddha taught that it was wrong to be attached to any non permanent thing."      Is this saying that it is bad to be attached to humans? To love being around someone and miss them when they are away? I am slightly confused on that. So, please answer if you can!

Jesus did not go to Heaven on the same day that he was crucified.   3. God's authority to judge the world may be delegated to various individuals.   4. The days of creation were probably not 24-hour periods.   5. We existed as spirits before the Earth was created.   6. All people, whether good or evil, will be resurrected.   7. The Bible as we have it today is imperfect, and contains some errors.   8. Those who live in serious sin should not be granted full fellowship until they repent.   9. Premarital sex, extramarital sex, and homosexual sex are all sinful.   10. One must believe in Jesus before receiving baptism.   11. Baptism must be performed by immersion.   12. Miracles, healings, and speaking in tongues still occur today.   13. Salvation in the kingdom of God is dependent on the grace of God.   14. Salvation is also dependent on the works of the individual.   15. The church has deacons, bishops, elders, pastors, and other ministers.   16. Christ is the head of the church.

I know for sure tat I want a career in the human/social services field.       At first, I wanted psychology.... then I realized i have a low chance of getting into the programs with my low grades also that, being a psychologist with a phD takes a real long time. Then I'm like "i'll try social work... its not as hard to get into and if u get a master's then you'll make a decent amount of money". Now my problem is that, I dont know what I see myself as. I've heard social work is a burnout for many.. and I dont wanna waste my time with that. I want a career where I'll be able to have the opportunity to work with children ( no not guidance counsellor or ECE), mostly teens and young adults. Everytime I decide on a career that I want to "focus" on I overanalyze it and then I feel as if I'm not the right person.  What should I do? I'm thinking now that i should get a degree in something else like psych or sociology  to broaden my opporunities in other work ( such as business) and if i decide to later on, I can do my MSW in social work, where I'll be able to make more money than with just an undergraduate degree.      I don't know what to do. I dont want to go to college or university regretting all the money I've wasted because I did something else. I dont want to be those people in the future hating my job and not being financially and independently stable. Iwant to be able to support my own family, without depending on anyone else. I want to be happy in my future.       Somebody please help!! Sorry for my long essay :(
20090222133337AA7kleq	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Why are all Oriental-asians being categorize as Chinese here in the UK?	I was filling out forms for colleges yesterday, and I just noticed most of the asian ethnicity categories there are just like for Indian-Asians, no Oriental-Asians whatso ever      Great, theres Asian- Pakistani, Asian- (i forgot the others), theres like 5 different asian categories for Indian-Asian, but just 1 (Chinese) for Oriental asians      I mean, Indians are not the only Asians in the world you know. I'm a Filipino - and Filipinos are not Chinese!    how bout the Vietnamese - their not Chinese either!   neither are the Indonesians and the Malaysians!    AND YES! WE ARE ALL PART OF ASIA!      Aint these like an act of racism saying all Oriental-Asians are all Chinese? Yes, we all kinda have a "chinky" eyes, but it doesnt mean we can from the same country. They can divide the Indian Asians, but not the Oriental Asian??      And this isnt just about the forms. Ask a random person here in the UK! and I bet they would stereotypically say that a slanty eyes person is a Chinese

Whenever I tell someone my religion the response is usually something along the lines of 'You're going to hell if you don't convert' or better yet, 'You worship Satan,' which is a bit impossible since we don't have a satan in the Wiccan religion and only two gods that are there for guidance and to help keep the balance of good and evil as equal as can be on this plain of existence.

20090222132130AADhMnF	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Am I Alone With Anxiety About Religious Things?	I've had anxiety for about 3 years now   not the best years of my life.      I've been scared of everything from heart attacks to demonic possession   (which is what I'm currently scared stiff about)   I always get on the internet to look up things about it, I'm never satisfied with what I find.  I always always ALWAYS find things or signs that could lead to possession and piece them together with how I'm feeling in my life      currently I am not exactly in school, I don't have a job and I'm moving out of my house soon (I'm 18)   I'm honestly going crazy right now about this whole possession thing, I try to have a good time but in the back of my head I always scare myself.   I DON'T dabble in dark arts or anything of that sort so therefor I don't know if I'm even able to get possessed.  I read so many forums and sites about possession that I'm now scared silly about it even though deep down I know i shouldn't be afraid.   Sometimes when I'm REALLY freaking out about it I'll say to myself in my head "demons come into me" even though I truely don't mean it.  I feel really invaded by religion too because I've heard the devil can read your thoughts so when I think that stuff I'm afraid I'm making connection to him in that way even though, I'm not because I'm not that spiritual.   Anyway I also think to myself sometimes like "okay if the Packers loose this game then the Devil can have/will take my soul" but I'm only saying it to scare myself and I don't mean it   and sometimes the Packers win and sometimes they loose.      I've talked to lots of people who are religious and they all say possession is real, they say they don't think I'M possessed but they say it happens   I even read once that possession just happened to some normal people who weren't involved with anything which scared me even more      I was wondering if anyone else fears these kind of things, and if anyone has any advice      I'll be honest right now I'm not to sure what I believe in, I used to go to Youth Group with one of my friends but were not exactly friends anymore so therefor I don't really go anymore   Churches and such kind of really scare me and so do crosses, I'm just nervous around them I guess   Sometimes I just want to jump up and scream at the top of my lungs because I'm so distraught by the fear of these common objects.   My phycologist sometimes says maybe I should just hiss and growl and pretend I'm possessed to get it out of my system but I get to nervous to do that.   If anyone has any problems like mine please lemme know, or maybe just some friendly advice might be helpful too      Please I'm really scared about possession   and everything in general   I'm tired of being scared of things I don't understand   I want to just live my life again       Any advice or comforting comments would be nice   Thanks :)

She's like a charismatic loner that everyone respects if you know what imean.

I thought maybe she was a lesbian but she's not into girls. It's like she feels she should've been born a guy. I think she is depressed but puts a brave face on. I promised not to tell anyone so I can't talk about it with anyone, I really worry about her.

I know you guys will judge her negatively, because no life deserves to be taken away without Allah's permission, and i know Allah SW will punish those who allow acts of abortion to take place. It's my friend's and her partner's fault for having sex before marriage and my friends and i always told her it was wrong. I love her to bits though and i know she doesnt want to go through with it. Her b/f says he doesnt want her to go through it either but due to 'circumstances' they have to.       1) They don't have good jobs to provide for the child   2) Their families hate each other and don't like them being together anyway and if they found out about the pregnancy, they believe their families will face shame and hardship from relatives and all the people they know   3) their parents may develop mental issues or have a heart attack due to the shock      I still believe your circumstances can change all the time due to Allah's will but after killing your child, he or she can never return back to you ... what will you do themn?      I basically feel it's the couple's fault and they should face the consequences of their act. But thanks to their circumstnces they believe they can't do it       My friend wants me to come with her, and i told her i don't think i will. She seemed hurt but said ok.      What do i tell her? I believe i may get sin for accomanying her. Is this the case? I don't think i'm being selfish because i think going there will be like supporting the abortion. That may sound weird but it is how i feel... what should i tell her? I love her to bits because she's my best friend and she's been there for me always. What do i do?????

Will you be born again?	it probably means your smarty than 99% of the population. Religion will never reform mankind because religion is a form of slavery. Do some research. Look up ancient gods like Horus of Egypt, Mithra of Persia, Attis of phrygia, ect,ect.... Many godsons dating back to 10000bc where all born on dec 25, to a virgin, a star signaling the birth, traveled with 12 decipels and performed miricles. The bible has more to do with astronomy than anything else. Look for orions belt tonight, the constillation. See how the 3 bright stars line up with serius the brightest star in the night. On Dec 25 they will line up and point to the sunrise. "the 3 kings" that follow the star to the birth of the sun. Religion keeps people ignorant and obediant. I appologize if I offended you at all. But everything Im saying is true.

20090222135501AAFBAJ0	Society & Culture;Languages	How does this statement sound to you?	Had an issue at work the other night and my boss told me to write up a statement.. Names have been removed and replaced with asterisks.      "On 20 Feb 2009, I was extremely busy handling pressing matters including preparing a res to leave the facility via ambulance, discussing the urgent transfer with the resident's family, corresponding with the physician, assisting a confused res back into his wheelchair, answering questions two separate family members had, and other tasks that required my prompt attention when a resident in the dining room began crying in pain and making statements expressing the pain he was in.       I approached the resident, asked him where the pain was, assessed the indicated extremity, and asked other questions trying to determine the cause of his pain. I checked the MAR and found an order for Acetaminophen prn for pain. I saw ***** CMT near the crying resident and instructed her to administer the med. She looked up at me and stated "Can't you see I'm with another resident?" I told her I had noticed and she needed to give the Acetaminophen as soon as she was done and I went back to work. I phoned Gill's answering service and put out an urgent page to obtain an order for a stronger pain med.       Approximately 5 minutes later, I asked ***** CMT if she had given the pain med, she glared at me and said "To who?" I answered the question and asked her for the second time to give the Tylenol. I stated "I really need you to give the man his pain med; I'm juggling a lot right now and I just need you to give it." I returned to the Nurse's Station and resumed filling out paperwork and speaking with family members.       Approximately 5 minutes later, I approached ***** CMT and asked her for the third time if she had given the pain med, she sighed and said "To who?!" I answered her again. She said "No, I haven't. That's a prn med and you have to give it. You're the nurse, you have to do an assessment." I told her I'd made an assessment 10 minutes ago and reminded her that this was the third time I had asked her to give the med and she still had not. She said "I don't know why you haven't given it to him. You're the nurse and he's your patient, go give it to him." At that point I walked away, received a call from Gill with orders to administer Vicodin. I took the Vicodin from the E-Kit, administered it, and called *** DON to explain the situation.       While I was speaking to *** DON, ***** CMT took the med cart and left the unit to pass trays in the main dining room. I didn't see ***** CMT again. She left the facility without turning in her keys to me or any other nurse. She left the facility without returning the med cart to the unit; it was left sitting outside the main dining room only to be returned to North by the South CMT. She left the facility without reporting to me or any other nurse that she was leaving. After my shift had ended and I had gone home for the night, I received a call on my cell phone from the night nurse asking if I was aware that none of the treatments had been done or that a whole hall had not received their HS meds. I stated no. I had no report or knowledge of the missed meds and treatments."

20090222150815AAdBe62	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	A question for those who believe that nobody could enter Heaven before Jesus' death and resurrection . . .?	OK, there are some who believe (or at least come from a tradition that believes) that the OT patriarchs -- Adam, Noah, Moses, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob -- and the faithful kings -- David, Solomon, etc. -- could not enter Heaven and were thus consigned to "Limbo" or some such place.  All those faithful who died before the death and resurrection of Christ, in fact, were sent to this place until Jesus "descended into Hell" (in the words of the Apostles' Creed) to proclaim victory.  IF such would be the case, how would those that believe such explain 2 Kings 2:11?      If I misunderstand the belief system, please clarify -- however, I have read Dante, understand his influences and belief system insofar as I can without speaking with the man, and he placed the patriarchs etc. in Limbo, the first Circle of Hell, the outer edges of the Inferno (Inferno, Cantos III and IV).      If such belief system has in fact changed within the church, is it possible to tell me how the early church disregarded 2 Kings 2:11?      This is even more interesting in light of the Transfiguration, at which Peter (the accepted founder of the Catholic Church) saw Elijah conversing with Jesus.  Where then did Peter think Elijah had come from . . .?      This is NOT intended as a "Catholic-bashing" question.  Thanks all for your informed answers.

20090222144504AAdMmEB	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians.  Did you know that the temple shows us today how to approach God?	People say that the old testament has no bearing on us today, but that couldn't be farther from the truth.  Noah's flood story, the Exodus and the temple all show us spiritual things that were hidden from them long ago.      The laver (wash tub in the outer court where the priest's washed before approaching the temple) symbolizes how we must cleanse ourselves and repent of our sins before approaching God      The table in the inner court being set with the bread made without yeast, the candelabra with that was never to go out and the incense that was also to be constantly lit symbolized:      the bread - that we are to approach God with no hypocrisy or malice (Jesus said the yeast represented those 2 things)      the eternally lit candelabra - represents that we should keep the Holy Spirit and our fiery zeal ever burning in our hearts for the Lord.      the ever burning incense - represents our prayers (Paul said pray without ceasing)      Peter said we are priests of God forever.  Notice these things are our responsibility to do.        Does anyone have any other insight or anything else to add?  God bless you all.
