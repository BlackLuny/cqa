PjICrHkJaa	Pheromones. Your armpits and your dirty clothes have the smell of your pheromones, a unique smell emitted by you and only you. I have had cats that drool before and I finally found out on some trustworthy site (which I can't recall) that cats drool when they are happy and relaxed. This relaxation includes the jaw muscles, which is why they drool. Your smell makes your cat happy and relaxed, thus he relaxes his jaw and saliva drips out. Not all cats do it. I have two. One does, one doesn't. I have had others that drool as well.|`|e297ec36aa9e3904ff06e84dd4fce511aa	It sounds almost as if he was a your bf in a past life.<br>  On a more logical note, perhaps it's some of the info posted already that was mentioned.<br>  Mine loves to circle around my legs all the time in the kitchen. But he does this constantly and he isn't even hungry. <br>  When I'm sitting at the desk, online, he'll hop right up on the desktop, and plop/flop right OVER the keyboard, lol!<br>  And he'll just sit there, purr and gaze at me. Then he'll roll over because he always wants his tummy petted.<br>  He's black and white, with a BIG white heart shape on his chest, white snout, white whiskers w/a big black button nose.<br>  I've never had a cat that drools.|`|591d2bc57b8d0e5a6738abecf7b3b309aa	The logical explanation is.... your cat is weird. Thats all|`|BaGcsCmjaa	Ask your vet!|`|D15q5cz6aa	I once had a cat who did similar things as yours. he used to drool when he was on my lap. and my mums lap. I believe that if you got your kitten very young it is a "kitten" kind of thing in that he relate to you as a mother. it was proabably taken from its mother just a bit early, but it is a sign of effection in that it thinks of you as a maternal figure, probably thinks your its mum. I would not panick over this behaviour.|`|e3e6e5b5145e6aed3ff96a161f0f920faa	Hi:<br>  <br>  I also have a cat that seems to prefer my personal odor, but it doesn't seem to have the same behavior as you describe.  My cat is basically very skittish around strangers, and will run and hide.  The only person she came out around has been my mom, and I think it is because she probably smells pretty similar to me.  She is absolutely the least cranky cat I've ever seen though, and unlike other cats, she is completely happy any time you want to pet her, and she likes to sleep in my lap.  If she weren't so shy, she would be a perfect cat to visit a retirement home.  This cat also really likes the smell of clothes from the dryer - it isn't just the warmth - I think she likes the dryer sheets.  I have another cat who really likes bananas - and if you eat one, she'll smell it and come and cry to lick the inside of the peel and we always give her that along with a small bite of the banana - she's sort of a licking fool and will lick glass, the phone, the cover off an old book - really weird.   Every cat I've ever owned has its own quirky behavior like this - one I had liked to lick Ivory Soap and eat cucumbers.  I would think the drooling would have something to do with the nursing response, though, but one that's sort of evolved into some other quirky cat behavior.<br>  <br>  You might try switching deodorant, laundry solutions or dryer sheets - maybe a scent from that is what he likes.<br>  <br>  I think for pheromone emission, men actually emit more than women, and I think it was discovered several years ago there is a small opening in the nose that detects pheromones.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, and at least maybe makes your cat seem not that odd.|`|aydXqEu7aa	Pheremones - it's like catnip to cats.

AA12215194	Brittanys are great and will stay perfectly. Try this.......<br>  <br>  <br>  Teaching Your dog to stay can be useful in certain circumstances and it also helps to teach Your dog steadiness and patience.<br>  <br>  With Your dog in the sit position ask him to stay, hold your hand up with your palm facing Your dog and take two steps backwards. If Your dog stays in position return to him and give him a treat. Repeat this exercise until Your dog is quite happy to stay until you return to him. If he moves out of position make sure you put him back in EXACTLY the same place.<br>  <br>  It is vital that you do not call Your dog to you, you MUST return to him. If you call him to you after he has stayed, each time you ask him to stay he will be anticipating you calling him and this will make the stay exercise very difficult for him.<br>  <br>  Next time take three steps back and again return to Your dog and give him a treat. As you become more confident move further away from Your dog. Do not move on to the next stage until he is 100% reliable at each point. Eventually I would like you to be able to walk all the way around Your dog at a distance of three or four paces.<br>  <br>  The next stage is to do an out of sight stay. Get Your dog to stay and move out of sight for just 2 seconds. Don’t ask too much of him until he is confident that you will come back. There is no need to rush this. The more you are working with him the more he will be getting your full attention and having something else to occupy his mind.|`|01c3046840fc4554279a5b27c5c32f9faa	nope sorry i have cats|`|AA10378701	just keep on trying|`|AA12285971	it goota take some time for a dog to learn. i duno repeat the cycle every min<br>  or teach her more often|`|03f85d579905eae648a299b8e9ea77d3aa	point a gun at her and say move ***** and you die lolol|`|06ac307d6091d9214edc2c5916b6c9c7aa	Practice amkes perfect.

Tell her to stay.  If she does this for about 10 seconds, give her the treat.   If she doesn't stay and comes after the treat, start again.  After doing this for a few times, take a step back with the treat in view.  Tell her to stay again. Do this a few times with her staying.  Then move another step back.  Continue this process until you are about 10 feet away and she is staying.  After that try different things to get her attention away from you- say have someone come over and call her name.  Tell her to stay.  If she stays, give her a treat.  Always, remember to be consistent and good luck!|`|e1324afe30b3263880f1dde64fcd16faaa	get a treat, tell her sit, stay.  start to walk away. if she moves, physically sit her down and say stay.  walk away again. keep doing this until you can walk a few steps.  then say good stay!!! praise her and give her her treat.  keep practicing, making her stay longer each time.  also try "don't touch" with the treat on the floor.  fun and good luck!!|`|AA11781843	THIS IS GOING TO SOUND STUPID BUT IT WORKED FOR 2 DOGS THAT I HAVE HAD.

Never get angery with your pup for not responding to a command. Praise lavishly every time pup responds to a command.<br>   NEVER hit your dog. NO reason is an acceptable reason for physicaly abusing your pup.|`|AA12083992	Teaching your dog to "stay" involves the same positive reinforcement techniques necessary for all training. Be sure your dog understands a "release" command first so she'll know when it's OK to move from the "stay" position. <br>   <br>     <br>    Steps:  <br>  1.   Be sure your dog understands a release command, such as "free" or "okay," before teaching this command.  <br>    <br>  2.   Have your dog sit or lie down in front of you. (See Related eHows "Train Your Dog to Sit" and "Train Your Dog to Lie Down.")  <br>    <br>  3.   Place your hand, palm open, in front of your dog's nose and give the command "Stay."  <br>    <br>  4.   Say "Good" at the exact moment your dog exhibits the behavior you want.  <br>    <br>  5.   Give the release command immediately after (within 1 to 2 seconds), followed by treats and unlimited praise.  <br>    <br>  6.   Reward your pet even if she only "stayed" for 1 second; and always offer rewards for even slight indications of understanding.  <br>    <br>  7.   Lengthen the amount of time your pet remains in the stay position very gradually, and slowly move farther away.  <br>    <br>  8.   Remember to give the release command after every successful "stay" as you increase the length of time your dog must remain in the position.  <br>    <br>  9.   Avoid going into another room until your dog fully understands the command.  <br>    <br>  10.   Train in 5-minute sessions.

These 2 breeds together are going to be a challenge, I had a golden retriever & my terrier would always pick fights with him, because retrievers are easygoing & mild dogs, easier to pick on.<br>  <br>  But you have a puppy, he's really just wants to always play. Your older dog WILL let your puppy know if he's bothering him & WILL snap at him to keep him in line.

I had taken care of two jack russels, one was a puppy and the other an older dog and play fighting and running were their biggest goals during the day.  It's best to give the russel alot of excerise and attention to avoid hurting the collie.  Eventually when it gets older it will temper down some, but will always be a hyper active dog.

Mi piacerebbe davvero vedere una legge che vieta la vendità dei piccoli ancora da svezzare, e mi piacerebbe anche vedere meno piccoli allevati a mano ( e l'obbligo di una licenza ed ispezioni a sorpres per gli allevatori).  L'usanza di allevare a mano era cominciato per salvare i piccoli in pericolo di vita, ed è diventata una cosa troppo comune. Certi bravi allevatori inglesi ed americani che lasciano i piccoli con i genitori e li tirano fuori per un po' dal nido ogni giorno soltanto quando sono più grandicelli in modo di abituarli all'uomo, si sono resi conto che allevandoli in questo modo, assieme ai loro genitori,  produce pappagalli molto equilibrati, meno propensi alle beccate e l'abitudine di urlare, più sicuri di se stessi, e più socievoli con altri suoi simili - un pappagallo più "completo".    Certe speci poi veramente soffrono lo stacco troppo presto dai genitori  - ma qualsiasi bestia soffre di questo fatto - cani, gatti, scimmie ecc.(hanno anche sperimentato e provato questo fatto anche se uno dovrebbe arrivarci da solo).  Perciò è un usanza crudele e inutile.   Per forza che tanti pappagalli poi diventano mostri urlanti che si strappano le penne.   Noi umani siamo troppo egoisti - pensiamo solo al nostro piacere e non al benessere del pappagallo.  <br>   E se tu fossi veramente uno con la giusta esperienza nell'allevamento a mano, sapresti già la risposta alla tua domanda (detto senza cattiveria),  perciò se davvero sei un amante dei pappagalli,  per piacere fatti un esame di coscienza e pensaci davvero prima di fare questa cosa.   Cerca un allevatore più serio che non cederebbe mai i suoi piccoli non svezzati.   Cè ne sono anche diversi che rispondono spesso su questi forum. e che spesso dicono di non comprare piccoli non svezzati.|`|KVxj06zoaa	Non ho capito cosa vuoi dire con "variazione" riguardante alimentazione ecc... se hai già allvato altri soggetti allo stecco sai già come si fa!|`|qmhCMOTnaa	fischer è una specie separata dai testa-nera (che è il nome comune dei personata)...<br>  la variazione di cui parli non c'è, perchè sia il fischer che il personata SONO inseparabili!<br>  comunque buona fortuna con la tua nuova avventura con il piccolo! ciao!!! =)
micmV9thaa	Portalo da un tuo amico o chiedi ai tuoi genitori di occuparsene.Tu tornato dalle vacanze potresti contraccambiare|`|6499a6f0937bbb4c83bcde40790fcc34aa	Non lasciarlo da solo a casa con qualcuno che gli darà da mangiare.  Soffrirebbe moltissimo.  O lo devi lasciare con qualcuno - un amico, un parente, - o con qualche allevatore o negozio animali o veterinario della tua zona (dove abito io c'è un vet che tiene anche i pappagalli durante le assenze dei padroni).  Prova a guardare sui giornali della tua zona o metti annunci sui giornali stessin o negli ambulatori veterinari richiedendo un pappagallo sitter - scegli qualcuno che ha qualche esperienza dei pappgalli e spiega bene (meglio anche scrivere) gli abitudini, il mangiare, le parole che dice, ecc in modo di farlo sentire più al suo agio possibile..<br>  Buone ferie.|`|FytqPgopaa	Io ho avuto il tuo stesso problema l'anno scorso!Poi però ho scoperto che il negozio dove l'ho preso faceva anche da pensione..puoi lasciarlo lì quanto vuoi(ma non troppo altrimenti il pappagallo soffre) e i prezzi sono abbastanza modici se l'animale è piccolo.|`|NTdWyrrlaa	Farò la bacchettona: i pappagalli sono animali molto impegnativi e andrebbe pensato meglio l'acquisto se non è possibile stare in casa con loro o lasciare qualcuno di familiare nel frattempo che se ne occupi.<br>  Non puoi ne portartelo con te (a prescindere dall'Hotel) che lasciarlo solo!!Non hai nessuno che se ne può occupare mentre sei via (genitori, amici...ecc)? Se no dovevi pensarci meglio all'acquisto! Mi dispiace, ma anche le soluzioni di pensione non sono l'ideale per un animale come un pappagallo: si sentirà abbandonato e starà male perchè lontano da te.|`|mcIbqRcsaa	anke io ho dei pappagallini...<br>  qnd vado via...li lascia a casa..e faccio venire 1 mio amiko a dargli da mangiare...<br>  oppure potresti lasciarlo a casa sua se lui vuole..magari se kiedi a qlc tuo amiko vuole...<br>  ciao :)|`|njfAT2V3aa	ti consiglio se ti è possibile di portarli a casa di un tuo amico o parente che ama gli animali.

Why would you keep a dog when some other child may be crying for their lost pet?  If you can't afford a dog why did you keep it?

SbLeCOjZaa	My dog's gas is awful- it lingers forever.|`|um5CVvTfaa	Occasionally Yes, all the time-- I would change their food.|`|1Ayb4UK7aa	Oh yes yes yes.  We had a dog that would fart everytime someone would just say 'poooot'.  He scared himself one night farting.  He was on the kitchen floor and it made noise and he jumped and ran.  Guess it might have tickled him a little.|`|df7bf836aea5d7c83e8e3ffb0bf38d9baa	Gas is generally caused by fermentation of carbohydrates - proteins don't linger in the digestive tract.  A dog has no dietary need for carbs -they're added because they're cheap. Try a higher quality dog food or switch to a whole prey raw diet and you'll remove the majority if not all of the gas. |`|oChOlCqYaa	It depends on the dog and what they eat. You might try a different food or give them s spoonful of yogurt. Probiotics are good for dogs, too!|`|NxAsYUiLaa	of course it's natural!  dont worry about it/ if there is a LOT of gas, then maybe change it's diet?|`|53R2rc6Gaa	My dalmation is very gassy. It's horrible, worse than any human ..... It was so bad one time when he let it rip while he was asleep and my two other dogs were asleep near him, that they woke up and looked at him and moved away! It was the funniest thing I'd ever seen.... ;)|`|koVk3P9Gaa	Are you kidding me??  My 3 dogs could clear out a football stadium w/ there gas. They burp alot too.  It's actually embarrassing when we have people over, but funny at the same time.  Just light some candles.  Cute|`|ABl7ebSyaa	it really depends what quality food you have!! if it is bad quality food they most likely have gas.|`|gOzlr6hEaa	Yup. Hes a pug so he has so much character so when he does fart he comes up to me a licks my face like he did some thing wrong or else he runs away. ha ha its pretty funny to see.|`|d4slGQG5aa	Yes,<br>  <br>  especially if they've been eating cheese lol|`|TWpVBzqtaa	oh yea and its usually when he is sleepign... on my bed... by my face|`|AA11394554	so dose my cooker whats the question?|`|9M8WY2vJaa	O M G YES|`|vaW0h0Ajaa	Yes, mine pumps like a fire extinguisher.

I bet it has worms now too, because fleas cause that. (  I bet you meant fleas. )|`|df08ff1d0e2d054dd5d050673bdbd724aa	Give your lab a bath right away this will really help o cut back the number of fleas.  It would also help if you would use an oatmeal shampoo.  You can get that at Wal-mart or something like that.<br>  <br>  Then go to the vet and get Frontline.  This will get rid of the other fleas and the eggs.   After 3 days you can give you dog a bath with oatmeal again to help the skin.|`|e1324afe30b3263880f1dde64fcd16faaa	take your dog to the vet to get rid of his flea problem, and while youre there pick up some frontline... it is a once monthly medication that you apply to your dogs skin between his shoulder blades.. it works fantastic for keeping away fleas and tics!|`|e51f6062bd000eff36008f1173cf7d70aa	There are medicines that you can put on once a month to keep the bugs off.  Ask you vet.|`|AA10104179	Not sure what you are trying to say, but if flies(fleas?) are bothering your dog to that extent, she needs to see a vet and get treated. Vet will give you flea preventative to get rid of her problem that you'll have to put on her once a month.  If the dog is inside in your house so are the fleas.  Remove all her bedding, wash in hot water. Then by a spray or a "bomb" (is easier) for fleas and set it off in your house. It is bascially insecticide that will kill fleas or prevent them from hatching.  Humans and animals cannot be exposed to this "bomb", so make sure everyone is outside for a few hours, then when you go back in open all your windows/doors, wash out all pet dishes, counter tops, etc.  Vacumn really good all over and you should be ok.  Pets with fleas are miserable to you need to keep your dog on some flea preventative ALL the time.|`|AA12131278	There is this stuff called Corona that you get at a feed store.  My neighbor puts in on his dogs ears for the bites.  Seems like it keeps them from biting more too.  I used to use Avon Skin So Soft on my dogs when we would be out camping or walking.|`|fe2d86e15f3b4645eeed0111e5621e6caa	If you dog has flies on it maybe it has some type of infection. Or just needs a good bath. I would advise you to wash your dog in some dog shampoo and water to get her clean.

2f5738f60ce330d58256976c53283b61aa	okay..just because you have a young child does not mean you cant have a dog. i have 5 young children and 2 dogs. we have a husky mix and a greyhound. <br>   personally i would not recomend a husky or husky mix. you think a lab is bad about being a pup..try a husky! they can be very destructive, get seperation anxiety ect. these are working dogs...and they need a job to do. so if you have time to help the dog have something to do..research the breed and find a very good breeder then go for it. i do obedience w/our husky mix daily..go to a 5 acre dog park 2x month.. and 2 walks a day...and he still has tons of energy. he has to be crated everytime i leave my house and when i am in bed at night..he will destroy it.<br>   German Sheperd dogs are pretty good dogs..one of my favorite breeds. they are pretty good w/children and very protective of their homes and families. i have never got the chance to own one of these yet. <br>  i recomend a st. bernanrd or great pyrenese..these dogs are very big...but absolutly great w/children. there are lots of great pyrenese rescues and st bernard rescues out there. and most these dogs are already house trained, obedience trained ect. if you do decide to get a puppy then do not get one from a pet store. pet store pups come from puppy mills and these are horrible places. <br>   also another good breed is a greyhound..ours is wonderful. a very laid back dog..they only need  a good run about once a week. and are very good w/children.<br>  whatever breed you do decide to get do your research first...that way you know what you are getting into.|`|0635a845f66f1560993ef88c99cce9c7aa	Well, with Chihauhuas, what I'd be more concerned about is the puppy nipping at your child. They have a tendancy to be slightly high strung and will defend themselves if they feel threatened. As for you worrying about the puppy getting hurt... Like you said, you supervise your child with the animal and the chance of a toddler seriously injuring the dog is slim to none. If you had a five or six year old that was being too rough then your chances of injury increase but when you say toddler, I'm assuming 1-2 years of age and their strength just isn't that great, not enough to break bones. Puppies of all breeds are amazingly durable, think about how puppies interact with each other; it's a lot of biting, tumbling and chasing. If you're heart-set on getting another breed of dog, though, I wouldn't recommend a German Shepard since you said you don't want a lab because they still act like puppies when they get older. I have a 10 year old German Shepard who still acts like he's six months old and loves to play around with me still. A Husky also wouldn't be a good idea with a small child considering the fact they will get defensive, just as the Chihuahua might. A Golden Retriever would probably be your best bet or possibly a chocolate Lab. The Chocolate Labradors, as apposed to the black labs, have a tendancy to develope that maturity with age better than Black Labs do. There is always the chance they'll still want to play and be hyper, a lot of it has to do with how they were bred but your chances are reduced. Another consideration is a Doberman puppy. If it's raised with the child, it'll be a very affectionate and loyal companion, not to mention tolerant and you'll find Dobermans age very gracefully. I was raised with a Doby and they're the greatest dogs to have as a playmate when you're a kid and even an adult.<br>  <br>  Also, as for the people above who are saying you need to pay attention to your daughter more than the animal... That's dead wrong. Yes, both need lots of attention and love but that doesn't mean you can only have one or the other. Are you going to wait until your daughter is 18 until you have another child? Most likely, no. An animal companion is a great idea for a young child because it offers them the opportunity to grow and learn with their new friend and offers them a type of social interaction they won't get with other children. I've had pets since the age of two and it gave me a wonderful opportunity to learn about responsibility and boundries. My husband and I plan on raising our children the same way and with any luck, that will be very soon!|`|639a18686558cf5f23bc27f5042383f1aa	I have both dogs.... chihuahua and husky....both are great with kids. my chuhauhua is very VERY protective of my children. He grew up with my kids starting at 5 weeks old.  There is not a thing wrong with your toddler to play with the puppy, they are actually bonding. they are going to need this interation to make a bond, a connection. Toddlers can be a little too aggressive towards puppies, but sometimes thats not always a bad thing. You will learn the temperment of the puppy. For example.... my chiahuahua LOVES attention, you can play aggresively with him.... but if he snaps at the kids, ( which he never leaves a mark)... they KNOW hes done playing and wants to be left alone. Because of the interation he has gotten with the kids ( growing up with them)..... he is tolerant of other children's 'rough play'.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|7202bdb6105bde6aec7f734509150536aa	if you want a dog that will take to your daughters playfulness get a rottweiler.

I think every child needs to grow up with a pet I did when I was small .<br>  <br>  If it was me personally I would probably keep the dog a little longer. What I did with our son is I would sit right there with him and the puppy and let him play and when he got to aggresive with the dog I would slap his hands and say no you are being mean to puppy. It took awhile but he finally understand and then they was fine.  Actually kids and puppies growing up together is a good thing they will become the best of friends. My puppy followed my toddler every where especially if he was eating a cookie lol didnt need to vaccum then :o).<br>  <br>  Seriously though I would not go with a German Shepard  they can get a little aggresive sometimes, now a Husky . I have a Siberian Huskay and got her when she was a year old and my son was 3 years old and she was so great with my son. There isnt a mean bone in her body . And if Michael pulled her tail or ears without me seeing she would just leave the room .<br>  So my kiddo grew up with two puppys actually .<br>  but like I said I had to sit with my child and teach him right from wrong and slap hands or swat his behind to teach him that is not allowed to be mean to animals of any kind and he did learn .<br>  <br>  Good Luck and your child will love your pet once they learn the rules of having a pet that you have to be nice to the doggie<br>  <br>  <br>  Additional Information<br>  <br>  I agree with the others on here that say get your child a dog , just because you are getting your toddler a dog does not make you a bad parent or you need to spend more time with your kid I have no idea why in the heck they would say something like that. When my son was born I had a beagle but sad to say they did not grow up together he got out and got hit by a car, but the one dog I was telling you about on here they did grow up together. I think a child having a dog or pet is wonderful. It teaches them to love and respect animals and when she gets a little older you can hand off some of the dog responsiblity to her like feeding the dog, giving it water, or sitting down to brush the dog, it makes her feel important that she can help out , my son loved the fact he could take care of "his dog" :o). Dont listen to these folks on here about you not being a good parent that is bs .|`|AA11453627	My suggestion to you is NOT to get a puppy while your child is still a toddler.  YOu already have too much to handle and if you think the chihuahua is too much, any puppy will be too much.  SInce adopting a dog is very much like having a baby, I think you should consider not having one at least till your toddler gets older and you do not have all the responsibilities that are just too much.  A puppy needs training and lots of patience and love, and right now all this needs to be given to your baby.  You either should have gotten the pet way before you had the baby so it would be trained already, or just wait a few more years.  Find it a real good home where he will get the attention he needs and for now, play with the baby and get him a stuffed dog.  A German Shepard puppy requires the same kind of care as a little dog and if it is a puppy you will need to really train him well which takes lots of time and patience.  A husky will also needs lots of care...just because they are a larger breed does not make them 'more durable' ----   I think you have plenty of responsibility right now to be taking on a new pet......what if you get a larger dog and you find a reason why you cannot keep this one and you have to find this other dog another home, like the other one, and you just cannot keep this going on......Just find the little dog a home, make sure it is a good home, and find your daughter a medium size dog later on when you will not have any problems.   I understand your daughter likes playing with puppies but let her play with stuffed ones until she gets older.|`|cc130386962fb491be2db78885aac4f1aa	I hate to say this because I know you won't want to hear it, but you are speaking of two different creatures who both need your attention and love in order to grow up happy and healthy.  Don't you think you would be better off just giving your new daughter ALL of your attention and waiting on getting a dog until later, maybe 3, 4, or 5 years?  Your daughter is the one who really needs all of your attention and if you are giving her what she needs then you will be doing a disservice to any pup you bring into the house because the dog won't be getting anywhere near the attention that it deserves.|`|dc4498b788256d4c8670ea3018db8976aa	when he comes around (the child) try to find a room you could put a gate in front of the door and try to keep the child away from the puppy................... my cousin has the same problem|`|230de8c8ef5f153f11aae5f1a15af8d6aa	***NONE***!!!<br>   NO breed is safe from children!!!

No matter the animal, she will want to play with it, and a Husky or German Shepherd could actually make the situation worse, as they are more likely to snap back, if she harms or threatens them in any way.  Larger dogs will see her as a member of their pack, and will want to show dominance over her.  It is very difficult to bring a new dog into a home with a child that is unable to leave the dog alone.  Since she and the animal will be approximately the same size, the dog will see her as a threat in some situations.<br>  I wish you good luck in finding a healthy, happy home for your dog, if you choose to give it up.  Try your vets office, as they may know of a family who is looking for a new pet, and they will be able to provide the references you need to know your dog is going to a great home!<br>  <br>  Added to respond to comments below:<br>  <br>  Please, dear God, don't recommend they get a Pyrenees or a Newfoundland.  This woman is ready to give her dog away because the kid won't leave it alone.  She doesn't need another dog, she needs parental classes.  Get your child to respond correctly to the dog you already have, or get rid of it.  It's that simple.  To go out and replace it with another dog, which of course will bring the same problems she has now, makes NO sense.  <br>  As for those who think this is bashing people who have dogs and children in general, it is NOT.  I have a child, and 4 dogs.  In this particular instance, this woman is not interested in training her child, she is interested in the easiest way to get rid of this dog so that she may replace it with one "more durable".  If there wasn't any thought before this poor dog was purchased, why do you think it will be okay for the next one she brings into the home for 6 months??!!!|`|AA10889713	Who is 6 months, the dog or the kid?

You need to find a dog that is physically and emotionally compatible with your lifestyle.  We suggest going to your local shelter / pound with your child, and introduce her to some of the dogs there.  Find one that is gentle with your child (and vice versa).  An older dog with more established behaviors might be better suited to your child than a puppy (which can be unpredictable).|`|e51f6062bd000eff36008f1173cf7d70aa	Your pup should be fine...as long as you keep doing what you are doing in monitering the the child when she plays with the pup.  How old is you kid...I have a 16 month old and he loves the pups and plays with them quite well....If you still think the small pup could be a problem then you might get him a new home....I have a German Shepard and he is great with my son...he is very tolerant with him....that is because we got the GSD when my sone was about 3 months old so he has always had to deal....My GSD is also very protective of my son know....So that breed is not a bad choice either....but you will still have to watch the kid and dog until the pup is just a little bigger....I had no problems though...<br>  <br>  And don't listen to the people who say kids and dogs are not good at the same time....that is not true...they will have a great bond and a pup who has to put up with kids all his life will be more tolerant of them when he is older....
nSxwBvZjaa	Das Gehirn der Katze wiegt zwischen 26 und 32 g und macht damit rund ein Prozent des K?rpergewichts aus. Die Aufgabenbearbeitung im Gehirn ist auf verschiedene Bereiche aufgeteilt. Das Gro?hirn ist der Sitz des "Bewusstseins". Im Stirnlappen werden die Bewegungen, die die Katze bewusst ausführt gesteuert. Im Scheitellappen, im Hinterhauptlappen (visuelle und Sinneshaarreize) sowie im Riechkolben werden die von den Sinnesorganen übermittelten Eindrücke ausgewertet. Für Verhalten und Ged?chtnis der Katze sind die Schl?fenlappen zust?ndig. Das Kleinhirn der Katze steuert die Motorik. Das Gehirn von Hauskatzen ist übrigens etwas kleiner als das wilder Katzen. Grund hierfür ist, das bestimmte Bereiche des Gehirns nicht voll entwickelt werden (müssen), da das Leben bei und mit dem Menschen verschiedene F?higkeiten der Katze wie z.B. die Jagd nur in geringem Umfange erfordert.

However, I use a private vet and the prices that I pay are much cheaper than Banfield charges.<br>  <br>  I would check with other vets in your area and see what they charge for exams, vacs and bloodwork then compare that to Banfield's prices.|`|32ffc675c2eac4a6462f4067b9b6b0ffaa	It saves you alot of money....My puppy was very sick when we got her...so we got our money worth....<br>  <br>  ....but also note that anyone can go in during wellness hours for free...if you pet is fine, there is no cost...<br>  <br>  we did have a few problems with the vets.....  Everytime we go it's someone different--and each time they tell you something different--once they completely midiagnosed something.  Our puppy had worms--visable worms in her waste--- the vet claimed that they were something else that is a microscopic parasite--which didn;t make any sense because you could see them...<br>  <br>  If I were you, I would go to a regular vets office and just pay more money--it' not worth the risk!|`|4961850597792e068703282485a1b3ecaa	i would set up a seperate savings account open it with the 139 and each month put in 25 dollars.  you can take your pet to a private vet and have that money to use on your vet bills.  also most vets are really good about helping you with payment arrangements if needed.|`|c37b5c8ee9c84d9cd1788ed8ec8a1522aa	My sister used Petsmart as her vet care, not sure if she had the Banfield Plan or not, but, she became very unhappy there.

Some dogs are prone to problems. If you got your puppy at a pet store you can't follow the blood line to see if there has been any problems with it's family. You should research each cross of your dog (maltese&poodle) to see what there prone to. Sometimes it worth getting a plan ready for your dog...but I find odds are you end up spending money you didn't need to.|`|42818303b584595022305e3f237bffcdaa	i havent but its a great vets office very good class and clean not a bad price what do that enclude email please|`|4400944ac639d7e3a061286a622149cbaa	Banfield is on <a href="http://www.ripoffreport.com." rel="nofollow">http://www.ripoffreport.com.</a><br>  Buyer beware.

Some Akitas have also been known to have their toenails fall off, but this is not common. etc. didnt the vet tell you why he was giving her prednisone?? did he do any test etc? here is the treatments for this disorder:Medical treatment is usually with oral prednisone and azathioprine, and topical prednisolone and atropine. it may be possible that she has this but the best thing too do is get the vet too give you a real diagnosis...|`|20490665d5893b995dabc8048d39fb4faa	Nope never had one but I do know yes they get skin problems.

Unsere Katze liebt Fisch, Hühnchen, Steaks, Lyoner Wurst, Schokoladekuchen, Hagelzucker und frische Sahne.<br>  <br>  Doch Scherz beiseite, da auch unsere Katze ein atypisches Essverhalten zeigt: man sollte Katzen eigentlich weder Zucker, noch Salz oder Gewürze zumuten. Denkbar sind schon so manche H?ppchen, die wir für sie übrig haben, wie z. B. auch ein Klecks Kartoffelbrei oder ein paar Nudeln ohne etwas oder etwas vom Fleisch oder Fisch, das nicht so stark gewürzt ist.  Aber auch Magerquark mit etwas warmem Wasser verrührt schmeckt und ist Katzen sehr zutr?glich. Katzen ben?tigen eben viel (tierisches) Eiwei?, Vitamine und weniger Kohlehydrate.

Aquí tienes una lista con los principales:<br>  <br>  Alimentos no recomendados<br>  <br>      * Huesos: Al roerlos pueden astillarse y perforar el instestino del animal, es mejor darles huesos comerciales, fabricados con piel tratada. Si decides darle huesos naturales, han de ser grandes, de res o cerdo, pero nunca de pollo, ya que se quiebran con mucha facilidad.<br>      * Chocolate: El chocolate contiene teobromina, que suministrado en grandes cantidades es muy tóxico para los perros. Un perro que tome chocolate presentará sintomas parecidos al envenenamiento: vómitos, temblores, diarrea....<br>      * Cuidado con las sobras: Es muy común alimentar a nuestra mascota con los restos de la comida, sin embargo esta práctica puede ocasionar trastornos alimenticios graves.

2821e642f26e1d2d0daab24df234f001aa	They are a Tibetan breed.  I have 2 and they are the best little dogs ever!!<br>  <br>  It is widely accepted that the Shih Tzu is descended from small dogs from Tibet, given as gifts to the Chinese Emperors and bred with Chinese dogs including the Pekinese. It was under the care and direction of the Dowager Empress, Tzu Hsi, who came into power in 1861 that the Shih Tzu developed into the breed we know today.<br>  <br>  In the Imperial Palace in Peking, the Eunuchs were made responsible for the care and breeding of the Shih Tzu. These shaggy little dogs became the pampered darlings of the palace. The Empress insisted that complete pedigrees and descriptions of physical markings be kept for all dogs used for breeding and for all puppies whelped within the household. For aesthetic and religious reasons, parti-colors with perfect facial markings and perfect saddle were held in high esteem by the Empress, but solid colors were also prized by her. In fact, the only known photograph of her with any of her Shih Tzu is with a solid black male, one of her favorites, who followed her everywhere from her private apartments to the Palace of Heavenly Purity.<br>  <br>  Tzu Hsi was wise to the laws of color inheritance and knew the importance of the darker shades of brindle, silver and black in maintaining pigmentation-of eye color and coat color. <br>  <br>  Because the Chinese considered the lion symbolic of Buddha, and because of a centuries old awe and respect for this most courageous of beasts, Chinese dogs were bred to resemble the lion.  As the lion was not native to China, it is probable that sculptors carved lions from descriptions they had received about the beasts, and the dogs were bred to look like the statues instead of the real thing, i.e.: flattened muzzles, undershot bites, bowed legs (bowed legswere  even intentionally bred into the Pekingese and are a characteristic of the breed!), protruding eyes, wrinkled faces, and fierce expressions.  The two breeds most lion-like in their appearance are the Shih Tzu and the Pekingese.   The eunuchs vied with each other to breed the most perfectly lion-like specimens.<br>  <br>  The Empress jealously guarded her treasured Shih Tzu and was loath to let any leave the Palace. She entertained wives of ambassadors and diplomats for political reasons, but feared and hated these "foreign devils". She bestowed valuable gifts upon them but in the beginning Shih Tzu were not among the gifts- despite the interest the foreign ladies showed toward the dogs. <br>  <br>  However, in the early 1900's several Shih Tzu were brought into Europe by returning diplomats. Many of these original dogs died (it was rumored that they were fed broken glass so as not to be bred outside of the Imperial Palace). <br>  <br>  After the death of the Empress in 1908 and the ascension of the new child Emperor, Pu Yi, the fate of the dogs became tenuous. Many of the eunuchs who had become expert breeders were dismissed and many dogs were destroyed by fires in the Palace. It is also speculated that many of the eunuchs took prize specimens with them and sold them to Chinese noblemen and foreigners. <br>  <br>  In the early 1930’s, several Shih Tzu were imported into England and Scandinavia.  Offspring of these dogs were imported into the US and Canada.|`|D4X7wT7gaa	The Shih Tzu is a sturdy, lively, alert toy dog with long flowing double coat. Befitting his noble Chinese ancestry as a highly valued, prized companion and palace pet, the Shih Tzu is proud of bearing, has a distinctively arrogant carriage with head well up and tail curved over the back. Although there has always been considerable size variation, the Shih Tzu must be compact, solid, carrying good weight and substance.

(a mi me pasó una vez con un zancudo, se cayó a su pecera y antes de que pudiera sacarlo, mi tortuga ni tarda ni perezosa se lo comió) Si quieres darles alimento vivo, dales peces, caracoles (caracoles acuaticos de río no de jardín, ellas se encargan de sacarlos de su concha), acociles (camaron de río también se puede conseguir vivo y es muy buena fuente de calcio), grillos (los puedes criar), cangrejitos y tenebrios. Claro siempre ten en cuenta que sean de tama?o adecuado para tu tortuga. También les puedes dar lombriz es una buena fuente de proteína, lo malo es que también viene muy sucia, pero la puedes enjuagar bien antes de dárselas, también les gusta mucho.<br>  <br>  Algunas tortugas son más carnívoras que otras y también depende de su edad, si es tortuga japonesa (que son las verdes que normalmente venden en las tiendas), cuando son jóvenes son muy carnívoras y conforme crecen se van volviendo más herbivoras pero siempre hay que darles una dieta balanceada que también incluya algunas frutas sobre todo las japonesas que son muy susceptibles a enfermarse por falta de vitamina A|`|uHvaCPN4aa	Noooooooo, evita darles cualquier cosa que no sea la comida q venden en las tiendas de mascota (ojo con estas) a no ser que quieras matarlas (moscas, insectos en general, carne cruda mala idea).

Innanzi tutto non e' che gli fa male , ma lo devi aver abituato gia da piccolo perche' in genere i gatti hanno il terrore dell'acqua.

Fai una prova, vedi come reagisce appena gli butti qualche goccia d'acqua addosso e se vedi che scappa via allora lascia perdere anche perche' rischi che ti graffia e ti fa male!!! Se ci riesci devi usare uno shampoo per gatti , che devi comprare al negozio degli animali, perche' e' importante che non sia troppo aggressivo per la sua pelle tanto da togliere anche quello strato protettivo che ha addosso . Se non ci riesci lavalo con uno shampoo a secco fatto apposta per loro in modo da pulirlo senza traumatizzarlo.<br>  Anche per le orecchie  vendono dei detergenti apposta per loro .MIAOOOOO!!!!!|`|f14a07a229da578604afa822513b86fbaa	prova.... ma fai attenzione..... a certi gatti piace l'acqua|`|sf0NwmrJaa	non te lo consiglio|`|3dacacba67766bfb634a633b299aeb2caa	SI,CONSIDERA CHE IL GATTO è UN ANIMALE PULITO COMUNQUE Cè ANCHE LO SHAMPOO A SECCO|`|CRdfKWAeaa	Non è assolutamente vero che i gatti non hanno bisogno di essere lavati; anzi è molto utile per rimuovere eventuali parassiti, pelo morto e lo sporco che non sono in grado di levarsi da soli.

99f6283bf623c5ede4b6d11f0de36ce2aa	I have allergies to all animals.  Some dogs I am fine with and others set my allergies into high gear.  Most of the Airedales that I come in contact with do get my allergies going.  The majority of Wheaton's I don't have a problem with.  I have never had a problem with Bichons or Poodles.<br>  <br>  Of course, allergies are different for each person.|`|546918fee8ba877a73bc4bc604438741aa	I am 47 and my family has had many, many Airedales.  They shed very little, but I can tell you this -- two of my three kids are very allergic to them (my parents' dogs), but they're not allergic to our own dog (a shedding mutt.)  Also Airedales are very prone to skin diseases, like hot spots!|`|AA10327148	Here is the list considered low dander dogs><br>  Hypoallergenic dog breeds are those touted as being hypoallergenic; that is, provoking fewer allergic reactions in allergy sufferers.<br>  <br>  There are various coat types that are said to produce fewer allergens: single-coated dogs, who do not have a thick undercoat; dogs whose coat continues to grow, like human hair, rather than shedding regularly; and hairless dogs.

Most terriers don't "shed", because the hair gets trapped in the top coat and must be stripped or cut out.  They do not have the same hairtypes as the long silky dogs or the poodles.  Wheaton terriers don't have a normal terrier coat at all, and I'm pretty sure they do shed.|`|8a4157f33d1e9a8a2d24ef99295de54daa	There is no such thing as a dog that doesn't shed.  They all shed to some sort of degree, it just depends on where you live, what time of the year it is, and how their coat is.  Even poodles shed, I dont care what anybody says, I work with them, and I come out of rooms sometimes just covered.  If you want to try, they make a shampoo for dogs (and cats)  that is made to help humans with allergies to them.  It works for my fiance.  He's allergic to dogs, we just bathe mine in the shampoo and he's fine.  But if we go too long...he starts to have a little "attack".|`|230de8c8ef5f153f11aae5f1a15af8d6aa	LMAO!!!<br>   NO!!! <br>   ***ALL DOGS SHED***!!!!!!<br>  <br>  There's NO SUCH THING as "hypoallergenic" dog breeds!!! *OR* "non-shedding"!!!<br>  <br>  *WHY* don't people ever THINK???<br>  <br>  duh...has it never occured to you that the DOG'S enviroment has something to w/it???

Poodle - The Poodle is an elegant, medium to large-sized dog, with a profuse, but well groomed and clipped, wiry curly coat<br>  <br>  ? Labradoodle - The Labradoodle's body is slightly heavier than that of a Poodle. The forelimbs are robust and muscular with ears set flat against the head and level with the eye. Excessive hair in the ear canal while the head is broad with well-defined eyebrows.<br>  <br>  ? Bichon Frise - The Bichon Frise is a puffball of a dog with a loose curled coat. It is usually all white, cream, gray, or apricot<br>  <br>  ? Havenese - Smaller dog with dark eyes and long tail, covered with long silky hair. The profuse coat can be wavy or curly. A double-coated breed with soft hair on outer and undercoat. Adult coat reaches 6 to 8 inches, and has a pearly sheen. Some Havanese can be short haired<br>  <br>  ? Miniature Schnauzer - The Miniature Schnauzer is small, squarely-proportioned, has a long bushy beard, long head, and bushy mustache and eyebrows<br>  <br>  ? Kerry Blue Terrier - A well-built, muscular, medium-sized dog with terrier style and terrier character. This dog is born black but the coat changes color through various transitions<br>  <br>  ? Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier - A medium-sized, squarely proportioned dog that is strong and gracefully. The head is rectangular, rather long, with a short, strong muzzle. Its jaws are able to seize and grip prey well, and it has large teeth<br>  <br>  ? Maltese - A hardy little dog with a silky white coat hanging straight to the ground on each side. The coat has no undercoat and should not be wavy or curly. The color is pure white or ivory<br>  <br>  ? Portugese Water Dog - A hardy, muscular, medium-sized dog. The coat can be shiny, thick, open curl, or tight curl. The non-shedding coat comes in black, white or brown, parti-color (white with dark spots), black or brown with white markings, or even silver fox or gray.

They have a smooth shiny coat that is copper colored, red, black or tan<br>  <br>  ? Chinese Crested - Hairless except for feet, head, and tail. They do not have the protective hair that other breeds have and therefore can get injured easily. These dogs are sweet, lively, and playful. They are affectionate with children<br>  <br>  ?

366c549faa6d33e7833a21b648ff171faa	Hola!. Sin verlo está complicado.... Lo primero, es llevarlo a un veterinario para animales exóticos. Y para ir adelantando te digo:<br>  Entre las muchas cosas que pueden ser, están los parásitos, ya sean internos o externos, que pueden afectar a los ojos, pico... El tema de las plumas no creo que sea un a?adido sino  un síntoma más. <br>  Los parásitos puede tenerlos desde que lo compraste (en las tiendas es muy normal que los haya) por contágio, por una mala higiene en la jaula (los restos de heces en palos, comederos, bebederos, suelo de la jaula etc... es un foco infeccioso muy peligroso que puede acabar con la vida de tus aves) etc...<br>  Además, tienes 9, cuando lo correcto sería tenerlos por parejas,es decir, pares no impares. ésto, aunque te parezca una chorrada, es muy importante, porque sometes al ave a un estress por el cual puede acabar con enfermedades o incluso con la muerte.<br>  En la farmacia (en Espa?a) hay un producto llamado Xibroxín. Es un colirio con algo de antibiótico que puede ir ayudándole por lo menos para la inflamación y picores. La administración sería dependiendo del grado de hinchazón, pero como no lo veo échale dos gotas como muchísimo en cada ojo, sepárale del resto pero procura que los vea (de lejos) para evitar que se estrese más y acude rápidamente a un veterinario especializado.|`|6adfd24082be5f50266b4b270442379baa	----------------|`|uHvaCPN4aa	Lo que le pasa es que no lo llevas al veterinario.|`|06f154e3840f07b946a0dbc76b3a4a47aa	No es solo por lo lindo que no debes dejarlo morir sino por que tiene derechoa la vida como tu y como yo...cuidalao y si ve al veterinario lo mas pronto posible ayudale a sobrevivir a este suceso tan raro. digo raro por que nunca lo habia visto en ningun otro pajaro...suerte|`|6399d6b592ebbea34c0fd8df426c6f76aa	ve con un veterinario, es un pajaro muy lindo para q lo dejes morir.
be29ba43a644164409259d9e62d4c4d3aa	Well first of all, Yorkies can be more intelligent than Great Danes sometimes, and you know how that goes. Second, Maybe you should use the water bottle thing with the trash, or find out what is so intriguing about the trash if you can. Lastly, (this seems kind of cruel but it's not) put a bit of hot sauce on your dog's tongue, and act as if it is what you are eating every time that you have lunch/dinner/breakfast. Eventually he will think that it is mainly what you eat and he will not do it as much. The problem is if you don't carry hot sauce around with you all day, it could be a problem.<br>  <br>  And to krsnallsn... Yorkies are not poodles.|`|AA11391165	make your poodle eat the trash..if still persists in such behavior, beat your poodle senseless like shane does his rotweiller max|`|7ca44a3727786e789f15a19554574c39aa	You'd rather he goes into the refrigerator!<br>  <br>  Maybe if you waisted less food he'd have nothing but paper wrappers to find in the trash!<br>  <br>  It's called trash for a reason<br>  <br>  You don't want it anymore.  One beings's trash is another being's gold mine!|`|AA12002068	A yorkie (and all small dogs) are actually smarter than larger dogs....  you both need to seek professional training for behavior modification. Positive reinforcement works better than punishment. put the waste basket where the dog can not reach it... in addition, if the dog is begging for food, perhaps you should consider feeding twice a day with treats for good behavior in between meals. and crating the dog during YOUR meals.
ec78fbc4ade47de6c1bf0842bce9b7e2aa	I know from my own experience how well this stuff works. Frontline Plus is even better because it kills the eggs and larvae and it kills ticks. My dog has no fleas at all, I use frontline plus for dogs, they make it for cats too. If you have a problem inside your house the product you put on your cat will eliminate fleas in your house. Also 99% of fleas are eliminated (dead) within 24 hours. I recommend frontline plus. Make sure you use it about the same time each month. Especially during flea season.  Advantage is a really good product too. But I would try the frontline. I highly recommend it. There aint no bugs on me, there aint no bugs on me, Oh there might be bugs on some of you mugs but there aint no bugs on me! Your cat will love you!|`|04e56aef99609c1b695c5aad6e951f53aa	Well advantage will take care of the issue. If you live in a small apt, just that being on the cat will be sufficient enough. Bombing the house is a hell of a mess to clean up. You have to wash down the counters, put everything away. I'd give the cat a bath, and let it dry off, and then give advantage. If the cat is indoor only, how did the flea problem come about? Did the cat get outside? IF not, then I'd also get some outdoor spray, and go around the house. Indoor only cat getting fleas, without an escape maneuver, then they must have came in on you. Other pets, friends pets etc....  I like frontline better because i give my cats a bath once a week to help control the hair bunny populations, and it doesn't wash off like advantage does. Good luck, but bombing is a pain! so much stuff to bleach afterward.|`|1ea58c41c8d4e6552fe964bf24d2a325aa	Yes.  Unless there is an infestation, then you need to take him to a vet.|`|38e0e47d5b3146aff52f2239022bbfb7aa	USE it(follow directions)  wait two days repeat....Make sure the cats bed gets treated,...repeat...dust carpet with cayenne pepper.....repeat .....|`|3c521c0010f55faaf526239798e9a78caa	Advantage will take care of the fleas on your cat but you will also have to kill the fleas living in your carpet.  <br>  <br>  I personally am against any bombing b/c it's poisonous to you and the cat, but try something called Borax. <br>  <br>  After vacuuming once, throw the bag away by wrapping it in a plastic bag....sprinkle the borax and let it sit a while.  Vacuum again and then throw that bag way.  Repeat unitl you notice the fleas are gone.<br>  <br>  Keep the cat out of the area while you are boraxing the carpet.  <br>  <br>  Do a test on a small area of your carpet to make sure your carpet colors won't run.|`|7e097728c9f568565cc461f03b1f4fdbaa	I'm my experience it has killed the fleas on the cat.  You will need to flea bomb your house though to assist.|`|661205252f12364387eade453b993d6aaa	yes great idea|`|46465463e9a9114f6aea1c68a978589daa	If your cat is an indoor cat, where did the fleas come from...?  And fleas DO live on cats.<br>  <br>  Wash and thoroughly dry in the dryer anything you can that the cat frequently uses to sit or lay on.  What you can't wash, spray.  I don't think there is any need to bomb unless the fleas are really bad.

2f5738f60ce330d58256976c53283b61aa	you need to teach your dog some obedience i had to do this w/our dog while i was pregnant w/my twins. <br>   first get your dog a choke collar(they do not hurt the dog..just get your dogs attention.) and some dog treats .<br>  if your dog does not know how to sit..then this needs to be done first. <br>   1. put the choker and leash on your dog. have some treats in your pocket. take the leash and tell your dog to sit. push his butt down into the sit position. reward him w/a treat. continue doing this until he sits on command.<br>   2. heel- take your dog outside w/you. position the dog on your left hand side. make him sit right next to you. say your dogs name to get his attention...then say heel. start w/your left foot  and begin walking w/the dog. he should stay next to you as you walk. when he lags behind, bolts forward or to the side give him a sharp tug w/the choker and say heel and bring him back beside you.if he gets too worked up..then make him sit next to you and start over. it is best to start your training w/him after you have had a nice brisk walk or have let him run and play in the yard. this will take time. praise him when he does it right. <br>  3. Jumping on ppl- first pick a command that you want to use to tell your dog not to jump. if you use the "down" command to tell your dog to lay down..then do not use this..it will only confuse him. first when you dog jumps on you..give your command such as "no jump Buddy" then take the dogs head in your hands and gently push your dog in the sitting position. when he is sitting and you can not feel him still trying to come up on you then release and give him tons of praise. when doing this you are not only teaching the dog not to jump..but you are also teaching him that you are the boss. <br>   4. another good thing to teach your dog deals w/the pack order. when you are going to put your dog on the leash make him sit. if he wants to play ball make him sit before you throw the ball..and most of all before you go outside or inside make him sit..and tell him to wait..after you walk in the door you call him to come w/you. by doing this you are higher on the pack order than him..therefore helping him to listen to you better.|`|35ec2288b9b65db7c42cb30727a1daf2aa	Sometimes, when people buy Goldens, they don't realize how much energy they really have. Goldens and Labs alike both need a lot physical activity. They make great running mates, and most often the lack of activity is what makes them so hyper. If you can't walk the dog daily because of your pregnancy, maybe find a dog walker to play with the dog for a half hour or so. Find a doggie day care center so they dog not only gets to play all day, but socialize as well. The extra exercise will calm him, but remember he's still sorta a puppy and won't completely calm for a couple or more years.|`|AA10889713	Obedience class and proper exercise.  Most retrievers with high drive are crazy due to not getting enough exercising.<br>  <br>  Othertimes, unfortunately, it's bad breeding.  It's very prevalent in labs and goldens.  So really the only solution is obedience training and exercising.|`|bcc595f419f79fe25b50c6d6d96b39d7aa	I have a chocolate lab and she was like this until she was about 3 - and she's 5 now and still does it somtimes. So really, it's hard to completely stop. One thing that worked with my dog was whenever she was jumping or barking or just bothering us, we'd get "the can." It's basically just a soda can with bolts and screws inside with tape over the opening. Dogs don't like the sound of it and it helps to teach them they're doing something bad when you shake it. You can also use nickels inside. It worked for us, good luck!|`|f1d910e0eb10586ea4517e451deb8ba2aa	My golden is like that, but no matter what I do he always needs to have his paw on our laps.

AA10327148	The puppies are likely to live and do fine with their new owners..However, you will produce the much NICER puppy if you keep them with their litter mates for the 7th week.. That is when they learn the very basic puppy good behaviors, such as playng gently, and controlling their bites..If a puppy bites his siblings too hard, the siblings will either bite hard back, or abandon the naughty puppy. this is the best way for them to learn that biting hard is not acceptable behavior..the same with being food-aggressive, and several other lessons...The 7 th week is THE most important socialization training in the puppy's life...It is much better for him to learn these manners from his  litter-mates..|`|b19e643af0a10c7093d6014733018674aa	I got my puppy when it was 6 weeks and he did just fine!!|`|1e250409099c75f76a8e5be7964d665baa	Pups you can sell at 6-8 weeks better at 8 weeks or you can even have people come look at them then sell them to them at 8 weeks.|`|35d6503f498a14badcb217a6c05e8ed4aa	yes they can go to new owners. suggest that they may need a supplement from the pet store or vet......puppy food and get those vacc's started, if not already.|`|b6804340ca2d6b7d0c5447298ae452c9aa	You can give the to owners, but if you start to supplement their food with puppy chow (like the owners will when they are gone), you can give them a chance for two more weeks, to learn more about interacting. I think pups taken this early from Mom and the litter-OFTEN suffer from seperation anxiety and have to be medicated. They act out by ripping furniture apart, howling and all sorts of behaviors that may have the new owners bringing them right back to you, dumping them at the shelter or worse, abandoning them.<br>  <br>  Pups need to spend at least 8 weeks with mom and their litter mates.

Specifically....."it DEPENDS"...lol .....on the number of pups, the breed, and if the mommy is smart enough to know when to give up if SHE isn't being allowed to wean them. You probably have "pack rank" here. Mommy knows this! So if you do not agree with how she should "wean" her babies; she's gonna give up and  let ya do it YOUR way! In all seriousness though; watch her without her knowing it. She may sneak in for a little feeding time when you are not there to call the shots. Mommy could be warn out and not up to par herself for many reasons. She might need a trip to the vet. The babies will be fine to let go of at this age IF the new owners know this is a dangerous time of year for pups to be without their Mom's antibodies they get from her and give them the attention and care they would give a new born human baby. Just the move away from home WILL lower their immune system just from the normal stress of a change from what they are used to. Eight weeks and a couple of shots under their belt would be best if possible. Good fortune to you and the babies! And by the way.......she just might be a spoiled baby herself like a couple I've had!!!|`|ac053bf615e55cdd3fb8f5f5f59678ebaa	No, the pups still need time together to learn important doggie rules, however you can separate them from mom as long as they are fully weaned and can eat normal puppy food. Wait until the pups are at least 8 weeks old until they go to their new homes. Make sure, however, than any pups left over are separated by 12 weeks old so they learn to bond with people instead of other dogs.

Hope I could help!|`|d26778e74597bd61ec4ff7386e65455faa	Taking the dog to the pound is not abandoning the dog.It is your dads house and you have to go by his rules.Some day when you have your own home ,then you can do what you want ,but until then you have to do what your dad says.If your dad doesn't want to keep the dog ,see if there's a way to have a breed specific rescue take him ,or post posters or flyers around your town for a lost dog who needs a home ,or use your vet and post flyers in there.If he does insist on the pound please make sure it's a no kill shelter.Lastly posting on Pet Finder is good to. If you do  place the dog your self please don't place the dog with just any one  .Interview the people first ,get to know them a bit to make sure their intentions for this dog are good.<br>  <br>  One more thing take the dog to the vet to check to see if he's microchipped. He may have just got out of his yard.

2821e642f26e1d2d0daab24df234f001aa	The Lhasas are usually a little bigger than the Shih-tzu and have a longer nose and smaller almond shape eyes, they also have a smaller bone structure (Shih-tzus are built a little more solid for their size). The main difference is their character. Lhasas are happy, assertive little dogs that are chary of strangers; whereas the Shih-tzu are outgoing, happy, affectionate, friendly and trusting towards all (mine don't know a stranger).<br>  <br>  Lhasa<br>  The coat should be heavy, straight, hard and very dense. The texture should not be woolly or silky. The head should have heavy "head furnishings," and the ears should be heavily feathered.<br>  The shape of the head should be with a narrow skull, falling away behind the eyes in a marked degree, not flat, but not domed or apple-shaped, with a straight foreface of fair length. The nose should be black, and the length from tip of nose to eye should be roughly one-third of the total length from nose to back of skull. The eyes are dark brown, neither very large and full, nor very small and sunk. <br>  The Lhasa's feet should be round and catlike, and well-feathered. The tail, also well-feathered, should be carried well over the back in a screw, andthere may be a kink in the end of the tail. A "low carriage of stern" (tail) is considered a fault in the breed. <br>  <br>  Shih-tzu<br>  The general appearance of the breed is that of a small, compact, sturdy dog with luxurious coat, upright head, jaunty step, and plumed, curved tail flowing over the back. Ideal height is nine to 10.5 inches at the withers, but ranges from eight to 11 inches.<br>  The head is round, broad, and wide between the eyes, and in balance with the rest of the dog. The dark eyes are large and round; the ears are natural and heavily feathered; the muzzle is square, short and unwrinkled, and flat; lips and chin should neither protrude nor recede. The jaw is undershot -- the incisors of the lower jaw overlap the incisors of the upper jaw.<br>  The Shih Tzu body is slightly longer than tall, its legs straight and muscular, and its feet firm and well-padded.<br>  The lavish double coat is the breed's crowning glory. A well-groomed Shih Tzu in natural coat is a picture of perky elegance with flowing tresses framing an impish face and body hair brushing the floor.|`|342b3711423c978836fa192cef3238d8aa	Llasas are a breed that actually had a use - they were used as guard dogs.

Personality-wise, they're pretty similar.|`|01b97260f97417a01a71ef4ffbeb286daa	A Shih Tzu is actually a cross between a Lhasa and a Pekingese.  They get their underbite from the Peke side.  Lhasas end to be a little bigger.  Other than that they're both friendly, loving dogs.  And very pretty if you have the time to maintain them in their show coat.|`|889545bad896c1c9ca40d5e5b017cdb9aa	Shih Tzu is decended from Lhasa Apso.

4b96522cdada9bee2a93669cc4023651aa	OH WOW!! One of my TOP favorite breeds.<br>  <br>  I needed a Mobility Service Dog to wear backpacks and carry for me. Rhodies were in the final two choices. I have known various Rhodies for nearly 35 years.  Unfortunately we live in the far north and with that short coat, they wouldn't be real thrilled wih running errands around town in deep snow and bitter cold.<br>  <br>  They are in the hound group but they were really a herd guarding who also was used secondarily for hunting. They are incredibly devoted (think velcro dogs), friendly and patient; but let someone threaten their charges and all bets are off. <br>  <br>  A Rhodesian who had 3 little girls in his charge got the Kennel Ration Hero of the Year when he foiled a pedophile's attempt to kidnap the one child from the bedroom - attacked as the creep who had come in the 2nd story window, was carrying her down the stairs gagged (no bark, no growl just flat out to kill), never touched her and ripped him to shreds. He dropped her and the Rhodie, instead chasing him, put his body over top of the child and woke the household. The police followed the blood and caught him. The canine hero went back to playing with his kids and sleeping on their beds.<br>  <br>  (Downside on Rhodies - the counter surfers par excellence unless properly trained. and they are also usually smarter than their trainers and get it in a couple tries and see no point in repetitive practicing so they yawn and quit!)<br>  <br>  They do love to run so you will either have to do a super job of training them (think AKC obedience competition at nearly 2nd level called "Open")  or have a fenced yard with a 5 ft plus fence.<br>  <br>  They need a pretty good amount of exercise or they will go stir crazy. Great partner for jogging or biking once you teach them how to run next to the bike on a lead. (They have been clocked at 35 mph.)<br>  <br>  Go here to read about them:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.akc.org/breeds/rhodesian_ridgeback/index.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.akc.org/breeds/rhodesian_ridg...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.rrcus.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.rrcus.org/</a><br>  <br>  That is the National Breed CLub recognized by the AKC. On the website is a link to the breed resuce.<br>  <br>  Now like all breeds but particularly the large breeds they have hereditary health problems.<br>  <br>  . The Clubs' websites will give you an ENORMOUS amount of information about the breed - the good, the bad, and the why or why not to get that breed.<br>  <br>   The clubs websites also have:<br>  <br>  (1) a breeders list - all of whom have agreed to abide by the breeders code of ethics (which you can read)(<br>  <br>  2) a link to the breed rescue for their breed<br>  <br>  Do give serious thought to adopting from an adult from a breed rescue. The clubs' breed rescues go to a great deal of trouble to determine the dog's temperment, personality, likes and dislikes (particularly kids and cats and other dogs in the household), HEALTH, and level of training. They make a huge effort to match the right dog to the right home - and if they don't have one they think will be suitable for your home, they won't place it. Great way to avoid the puppy training, newpapers, chewing.......They have dogs that are purebred and part-bred (1/2 or so of their breed.)  PLEASE consider adopting from rescue. They are often more loyal and bond more closely when they know that they can trust you not to leave them having already been abandoned and deserted in their lives, and thankful for a loving home.<br>  A rescue adoption is usually $250-350.<br>  <br>  If you decide to get a puppy , please use one of the breeders who are members of the breed club. A well-bred pet puppy may not be a candidate for the show ring (that nose being 1/8th of an inch to long or something else very picky) but they will be very healthy, the parents carefully screened for hereditary health problems, and from a breeder who has devoted a great deal of time to understanding the breed and bloodlines. A responsible breeder will have a written contract with a health guarantee for hereditary problems; require that if for any reason you ever have to give up the dog that it comes back to them; and always be available for help, assistance and advice about your dog. Such a breeder will tell you if they don't think their breed is right for you based upon your needs. They want a perfect forever home for the puppies - not the money. (In 43 years in the dog show world, I have never known a breeder of that caliber who has made a profit on their dogs - it is labor of love.)<br>  <br>  A puppy from such a breeder costs no more - and often less beacuse poorly bred dogs typically have health problems and the vet bills go on all their lives - than from a backyard breeder who doesn't do the health checks, knows nothing about the breed or bloodlines, doesn't give a guarantee, never wants to hear about the puppy again and has breed from mediocre or poor quality dogs. A pt puppy from such a breeder will probably be $600 -900; and a top flight conformation show prospect about $1000-1500.<br>  <br>  (And backyaad breeders want nearly that and pet shops charge more for puppies from horrible puppy mills where they have breed anything they can get their hands on wihtou regard to temperment or health problems - they don't even vaccinate or worm let alone pay for all the expensive screening tests.<br>  <br>  IF A SERIOUS BREEDER OR RESCUE TELLS YOU THAT THE BREED IS NOT SUITED FOR YOUR SITUATION - BELIEVE THEM - NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOU LIKE THE WAY THE DOG LOOKS<br>  <br>  Hope you find one of my big gold buddies and give him/her a forever home.|`|342b3711423c978836fa192cef3238d8aa	Go to the AKC website and type in rhodesian ridgebacks - you'll find lots of info there.|`|27b0dc152d8cb508cc723b372dc58c91aa	they are huge dogs really cute they have on their back (its pretty cool hence the name) they make excellent guard dogs|`|99f6283bf623c5ede4b6d11f0de36ce2aa	I don't know that much about them but as a dog groomer I have seen several and all have been very sweet dogs.

2b4dfcd09c0f800f24c1cc6e3834773eaa	Los peces tropicales requieren cuidados y atención específicas:<br>  Checar diariamente la temperatura y ajustar el termostato si es necesario.<br>  Alimentar dos veces al día a los peces, proveerles únicamente del alimento que consumirán en unos minutos, retirar con una red el alimento que no se consumió en ese lapso, ya que de dejarlo ahí se ensuciará el agua. Checar que todos los peces estén consumiendo alimento. Además de hojuelas, periódicamente puedes ofrecerles a tus peces alimento vivo.<br>  Limpiar periódicamente los cristales de la pecera, ya que éstos empezaran a presentar alga. (Existen esponjas especiales para ello)<br>  Realizar cambios parciales de agua periódicamente cuando nuestro acuario lo requiera, para esto te puedes auxiliar de un sifón. A la vez con el sifón se limpia la grava del acuario.<br>  Reponer periódicamente el agua que se evapora, preparándola con acondicionador antes de introducirla<br>  <br>  Suerte con tus peces!!|`|038a2ffb2553007c2a103bbde29b3b00aa	Lo que pasa con estas peseras es que el filtro bien muy chafa. necesita uno mas fuerte así no necesitaras limpiarlo tan seguido una forma de que alguien te limpie tu pecera es comprarte un tipo de pes que se desliza por el vidrio.|`|9dc97e8e0feffde105fd6e13f656d9f2aa	tranquilo es normal, el agua está turbia, tienes que dejarla reposar por lo menos un mes antes de meter los peces, y preparate, es una aventura preciosa pero nada facil|`|cc20b336e288f2eeee5adf4d20ccf4ceaa	Te recomiendo que esto lo veas en Dr. Pez|`|3e2fcc0109e9872968cebba19757cd71aa	Te voy a decir tres tips 1.- Coloca tu pecera donde no le de el sol de lleno porque eso provoca el crecimiento de microalgas y te enturbian el agua. 2.- Procura que la grava de tu pecera mida por lo menos tres centimetros de grosor de esa manera cuando pongas tu aireador provocara mejor filtración del agua y todas las particulas suspendidas en ella quedaran atrapadas en la grava. 3.- Trata comprar una "cabeza de poder" ya que con esta la filtracion se realiza con mejor efectividad y funciona mucho mejor que el filtro de cascada.  Ahora, ya tienes el problema no? Compra en un acuario unas gotas que se llaman permanganato de potasio este producto envenena poco a poco las microalgas que ya se te formaron y que hacen que tu pecera se vea turbia, solo ten cuidado de como la dosificas.|`|510106c704252c114a3ccb1c251caa71aa	Estimado japn: El acuarismo, como todo lo que se inicia, no es difícil, solo debes tener un poco de paciencia y leer todo lo que caiga en tus manos, referido al tema.<br>  En principio debo decirte que el agua de tu acuario está opaca (como lechosa) debido a que está sucia, la causa mas probable es que se deba a que estas sobrealimentando a tus peces, una buena norma es: darle comida, si al cabo de tres a cinco minutos, la comida no fue completamente devorada, entonces estas poniendo mucha comida, la próxima vez coloca menos. dales de comer dos veces por día, una por la ma?ana, preferentemente a la hora de tu desayuno, y otra vez tres o cuatro horas antes del anochecer.<br>  de esa manera la comida que haya caído al fondo será buscada y comida por algún pez limpiafondo (Corydoras, Plecostomus, etc) que nunca debe faltar en tu acuario.<br>  No cambies el agua de tu pecera mas de una vez por mes, y no toda el agua como oí decir por ahí, cambia solo una tercera parte del agua, aspirándola desde el fondo para retirar los desechos acumulados y no te olvides de reponer el agua que se evapora cada dos o tres días, hazlo preferentemente con agua de lluvia o bien con agua del grifo declorada y reposada 24/48 hs.<br>  Tambien debes tener presente la cantidad de peces que tienes, si son muchos y el acuario es chico entonces los peces estarán nadando en sus propios desechos (orines y heces).<br>  Si así están las cosas deberás retirar algunos peces de tu acuario. Una buena norma para saber cuantos peces puede albergar tu acuario es: por cada centímetro de largo de pez (sin contar la cola) necesitaras un centímetro cuadrado de superficie de agua. Es decir si tienes diez peces de diez centímetros, tienes cien centímetros de pez, es decir necesitaras cien centímetros cuadrados de superficie de agua. se entiende...<br>  Espero haberte sido útil...|`|71815385b193fae9be3b5487c44918e9aa	El agua se hizo opaco por que usaste agua cruda es decir no dejaste que madurara, ya se que me vas a decir que no me entiendes eso de agua madura, veraz cuando introduces peces, los desechos de estos que gran parte es amoniaco elevan la toxicidad de tu pecera pero existen bacterias que transforman el amoniaco en nitratos y otras que lo transforman en nitritos, estas bacterias aparecen espontaneamente en la pecera pero tardan minimo 2 semanas lo que tienes en tu pecera es un exceso de nitratos e incluso puede matar a tus peces, entonces lo que debes hacer es cambiar el 20% del agua de tu pecera y renovarla con agua fresca, estos cambios hazlos diario hasta que se regualrice la situacion, otra manera es que utilices bacterias vivas como el Cycle y se lo agreges directamente, esto ayudara a que se estabilice el sistema, pero no te preocupes a esto que estas paasando se le conoce como sindrome de pecera nueva|`|7ef2bab58e7243d36a67984cbc4e0a56aa	ADEMAS DE TODO LO QUE SE TE INFORMA ES MUY IMPORTANTE QUE LA TEMPERATURA  ESTE CORRECTA ME A PASADO QUE SE LLEGA A ELEVAR Y ES TODO UN CAOS SE PONE LECHOSA ADEMAS CHECA QUE TENGAS BUENA CORRIENTE SALUDOS|`|OQYhXjVUaa	primeroque nada, lo turbio del agua se debe a las paqrticulas que se despenden de la grava y arena que tiene tu pecera. antes de instalar ebes hacer un lavado a ese material muy repetidamente.

Females have a twice-yearly fertile period, known as 'seasons', during which her body prepares for pregnancy, and at the peak she will come "into heat", her fertile period, during which time she will be mentally and physically receptive to copulation. A female is able to become pregnant on her first heat; this is not normally considered advisable as she is mentally and physically still young in other ways.  Please write down the first signs of heat in your dog. This way you won't be surprised when it arrives, you will be able to adjust to it and plan your schedule (trips), and, above all else, you will have an excellent control over your dog's sexual behavior.  The first few days, her sexual scent will attract the male dogs although she will, irritated, bite and chase them away.  Female dogs do not enter in heat only in summer or spring, as many wrongfully claim. Unlike other animals (sheep, deer), the seasons hardly influence them; however, they follow their own rhythm, which can vary among the different breeds, but remains almost always the same in every individual. The average interval between two heat periods last between 6 and 7 months. According to a common rule, the bigger-sized breeds have longer intervals than the smaller ones. Two well known exceptions are that of the Daschund at between 7 and 8 months, and that of the German Shepherd at between 4 and 5 months.  Female dogs do not experience menopause, although their cycles will become irregular and fertility becomes unpredictable as the become older. Dogs over around 7 or 8 years are usually considered no longer appropriate for breeding, but can still remain.|`|AA10327148	Any female, bred before her second birthday, will have a MUCH higher chance of early bone disease as an adult...The puppies steal the nutrients that the mom needs to mature her bones properly.|`|AA11112230	If you don't know, then do not breed her!

Go to the library and pick up some good dog breeding books. Theres lots of info on gestation, whelping and both care for the puppies and the momma dog. Remember to feed her extra during pregnancy.

A lot of private breeders sell them for much cheaper since they usually have large clutches of babies that they need to sell before they start running out of room, since these guys grow so quickly.The prices start to get much higher as you get into the different color morphs and variations.

You are building aggression by leaving him chained up and that's why he breaks his collar and runs away. If he hates it in the house, then a nice run with shelter from the elements is a far better idea than the horrible life on the end of a chain.

AA10029366	If you take your dog to a groomer or even a vet for a nail trim, they should be willing to show you how to hold the dog -- if you stay in the room while the vet/vet tech trim the nails, you can watch how the tech holds your dog, and how your dog reacts to that method.<br>  <br>  I restrain my dogs in the way most vet clinics do it (I think) -- <br>  <br>  Starting at the front: Stand at the side of the dog (on a table) or sit beside the dog and pull them into your lap. Put one arm under and around the dogs neck/head, and press the neck/head against your chest/shoulder. This will immobilize the head.<br>  <br>  Put your other arm over the dog's back and, using that arm to press the body against you, grasp the elbow joint of the front leg. This will also prevent the dog from pulling that foot away from whomever is trimming the nails. The easiest thing to do would be to reverse the dog's direction for the other front leg.<br>  <br>  For the rear legs, you can hold the same way (and just let the person trimming deal with the hind feet. You can also put the arm that was going over the dog's back under, instead, and press the body against you. Either way, you may have to hold tight!<br>  <br>  Again, this is hard to explain in writing, and would be much easier to understand if you could see it. Nail trims aren't terribly expensive -- it would be worth the $$ to get the technique so that you can do it at home.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|27d2fe79dd9df7b907483b0eb75c1a39aa	He He that's funny.  All but one of my five is fine and will just let them get snipped.

A pug mix.|`|12e67832e3db94d47bafc734b06e4b47aa	take your dog to a vets or dog salon & they will do it right please do not attempt to do this your self.<br>  If needed they will sedate it|`|e51f6062bd000eff36008f1173cf7d70aa	all I have every done is when they are very young pups I would always play with their paws....like when they were laying on my lap or something I would just rub their feet, front and back ones, just to get them used to that feeling....now I just tell them to sit..pick up one paw at a time and clip their nails.....for the back ones I have them lay down...and just pick up the rear paws and clip....I don't have to hold them down they just wait until I'm done and then get up and start playing again.|`|xZy05taKaa	HAHA<br>  OK time for the comedy act<br>  Wrap both legs around the dog (your legs) then pull its one leg up so you can see the nails...<br>  No, wait a minute, better than that get someone to sit on the dog without squashing it...<br>  <br>  No actually, talking in a sweet calming voice does help. Sometimes it is a good idea to have them restrained it really all depends on the dogs. Some are no problem at all. One thing is true though and that is if you are very Sweet to them, and manage not to cause them any pain than eventually they do get over the nail trimming fears and aren't bad.<br>  <br>  There are devices that groomers that do not have an extra set of hands to help them use. Some involve a set of arms and a harness that also lifts the belly of the dog so it has no traction and can't really do much to push away as there is nothing to push on.|`|yyP7f8mnaa	Lie the dog on his side.  You can keep him in position by gently "leaning" on him with one arm, just enough so he feels you're there.  Your hands will still be free enough to clip the nails easily.|`|0dbcab5a78b72d97386463d98eaa4726aa	Of all the dogs I have ever had, only one had a problem with having his nails cut and he did it anyway.

We charge $8.00, so it is well worth the money to have it done right without you having to struggle with him/her.  In some rare cases, the animal does have to go to the vet and be sedated, but only if the animal is highly stressed about having his/her nails trimmed.  That eliminates the stress to the animal and ensures that they won't be hurt during the process.|`|ae108db02c12ef58e1d75f3c981eba34aa	Do not I mean DO NOT let anyone sedate your dog to clip their nails. Almost everyone clips their dogs nails Nicole I don't know where you get your information from but you not right in your answer at all. I have my groomer do it when she is grooming my dogs, or the vet office will do it for free when they are checking out my dogs.. Or I will do it at home.  The best way I found to do it is that I hold my dog while a person is cutting them.  They feel safe in my arms so I don't have a problem.
MaYQWweqaa	It's what happens when a dog goes into heat.I suggest that you read up and talk to your vet before you decide to breed. You don't even know the basics.You'll be the next one on here asking "I think my dog is in labor and a pup is stuck, what do I do." Better yet get her spayed.Leave the breeding to the breeders.|`|M3jRtq2Aaa	She may be having a false pregnancy.  Some dogs even have milk with a false pregnancy.  She will be in heat again in 6mo, so you will be able to let her stay with her mate if you want puppies then.|`|ju34qmUXaa	Why don't you get her spayed and get your male neutered?  There are a lot of dogs in shelters getting euthanized because their owners did not get them fixed.  You should probably take her to the vet anyway to determine if she's pregnant.

Cats clean themselves where dogs tend to smell downright nasty eventually.<br>  Cats are a laugh a minute especially if you have two of them. Besides they dont eat a fraction that dogs do.|`|AA10628966	I like dogs better, because they have nails but their nails are really thick, so therefore they don't scratch up the skin as opposed to a cat. I have had my dog for 13 years, and not once have I gotten injured by him trying to hurt me. Ever since I got my cat I have been getting cut everyday, sometimes I do annoy my cat, so she has a right to scratch me. Other times I'm playing with my cat and she decides to scratch me at times, it is really painful! Also dogs are more playful and easier to get along with, my cat is very anti-social and only wants love when she wants it. She will even roll her eyes at me.<br>  <br>  My dog is just so sweet compared to her, but I know she tries her best.|`|056a4fd71fbe87c16fb3343df2d73ed5aa	dogs|`|0Sij1Ssvaa	cats without a doubt|`|1lQEDTibaa	I like dogs better!

Most dogs have a need for attention and affection of the owners. I have heard of many stories of dogs tearing up the house while owners are gone this is because there lonely and have a need for attention. However if you’re a person who is not at home alot Cats make better pets they are very self reliable, and do not need to be let out if you have a litter box and outside cats will tend to hunt when owners are not home to feed them everyday. So your personality and life style may establish which is the better pet for you.|`|URmp4Lu3aa	I like dogs better.They are so cute (cats are too) and  most like mine love to be played with.They can do so many tricks.A dog is a lso better in my household.With 8 fish, a hermit crab,2 parakeets,a hamster and bunny a cat will be jumping on everything! You are proballly asking why do you have so many pets.Well  I love animals! On the other hand cats eat a lot stay up all night which can get very annyoineg while you are trying to sleep.Also a cat drinks so much water and needs so much quiet plus attention.Take my moms cat for instance.She sits on her bed  and follows my mom all day.<br>  I hope you understand why i like dogs better.<br>  P.s-Cats shed too much
3300ddc0ef5c47c0f8f5f1abf32112dcaa	The average is three weeks (21 days). But it can be shorter (two weeks) or longer (four weeks). Assume the longer period if in doubt.  a female can come into heat (it varies with each dog) every 6mths but it could be more or less often. i suggest keeping her away from any males the whole heat cycle cause im sure you dont want any suprises. puppies are alot of work,money etc.|`|342b3711423c978836fa192cef3238d8aa	Dogs do not have periods - they have heat cycles.  They last about 3 weeks and females, while not ready to be bred the whole time, need to be kept away from all males the whole 3 weeks.  If your dog were spayed you wouldn't need to worry about it and it's much healthier for your dog, too.|`|11xlb9n1aa	Dogs do bleed but they don't have periods (menstrual cycles) like humans.  They go into heat (estrus).  A dog will usually bleed for a week to two weeks.  The important thing to know is that even after she stops bleeding, she is still in heat and can get pregnant.  This phase usually lasts about a week, but can last a little longer.  You won't be able to tell, but male dogs will.  Unless you want puppies, you should keep your dog away from other dogs for three weeks or more after she starts bleeding.  If you want to have her spayed, keep in mind that most vets won't do the proceedure until your dog is completely through her estrous cycle due to her swelling and hormonal concerns.|`|MaYQWweqaa	Get the dog spayed.|`|X9RVWXuoaa	Good question, my dog is in heat as of yesterday<br>  One week coming in heat <br>  One week in heat (this is usually when they will accept the male dog although it can happen at any time) <br>  One week going out. <br>  so about 3 weeks total <br>  <br>  and if you wanna consider her having puppies you might want to try now|`|b807f13da6719d3e3a726d7eb53fb59daa	A female dog doesn't have periods as a human.This is called a heat cycle and the cycle will last around 4 wks. at which time a female will breed a male around the 10th day  after cycle begins and up to the remaing days thereafter.Keep your pet contained if you don't want a litter of puppies.|`|AA10350451	A female dog is usually in season for 21 days.|`|URt2HF4zaa	i dont think that dogs have periods *cough, cough*|`|b9hh00Nqaa	i dunno|`|d98b687086f86af33cf68db0e2d30c51aa	3wks than they won't be in heat for another 6moths---i had the  same question for my dog as we are breeding her---|`|tk7u4RVZaa	A b*tch is in season for 3 weeks and is usually at her most fertile for one week in the middle.<br>  <br>  You can tell when she wants to mate by stroking her rump near the top of her tail, which will lift slightly and she'll flip it to one side.

I thing some other people misunderstood or maybe I did I'm not sure.  Anyways an E collar is the one you put around their neck that resembles a lamp shade sort of by it's shape and is used to stop dogs from licking wounds and such.  Anyways if I have it right and you really do mean an E collar then there is a great one made by a company called Kong pet care.  They are the best one's I have found because they have little snaps on them and can be taken apart so you can store it away when you don't need it so you will have it again for when you do.  It's made of a durable blue colored plastic and comes in various sizes.|`|yeUMvmBoaa	The one you wear on yourself.  Honestly.  Why does your dog need a e-collar, anyway?  I suggest you attend an obedience class first and learn how to TRAIN your dog.  Clicker training can yield amazing results without e-collars.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dragonflyllama.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.dragonflyllama.com/</a><br>  <br>  Also, you can look at this "canine freestyle"-- done all without e-collars.  <a href="http://www.dogdance.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogdance.net/</a><br>  <br>   If you're intending to train your dog as a gun dog,  yes, e-collars are popular in the field, but unnecessary if you've put in the solid training foundation first.   <br>  <br>   A trainer I know who gives workshops on training with e-collars herself told me that she would never recommend an e-collar to somebody who doesn't know how to use it.  <br>  <br>   She believes training, training, foundation FIRST and use the e-collar only as an necessary correction when the dog is offleash.<br>  <br>   She's right.  Lots of people mess their dogs up by not knowing how to use leash corrections properly, they could do even worse damage with e-collars.<br>  <br>    So get thee hence to an obedience class first, or see an animal trainer or behaviorist, if you have serious behavioral problems like aggression, lunging, or nonstop barking that you don't know how to solve.<br>  <br>   <a href="http://www.iaabc.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.iaabc.org/</a> <br>  <br>  Oh, by the way, you should always test an e-collar on your arm first and see how the lowest setting feels. <br>  <br>   The problem is, what doesn't hurt your arm with ONE use, could well hurt your dog's neck if used repeatedly  since it's much softer and less muscled around the throat, with lots of nerves and blood vessels running up and down under the fur. <br>  <br>   And retrievers are bred to go through very rough brush and take painful welts on their body and legs going after game.  I've seen my own retriever mix run nearly head-frist in a tree and keep on going; get cut up by thistles and brambles while chasing foxes, etc.<br>  <br>    So really, I don't think shocking is an very effective deterrent on an untrained dog if you don't know what you are doing in the first place.<br>  <br>    There is no magic solution that will solve your dog's behavior problems unless you learn how to train your dog.  I know, I listened to trainers who told me a good correction would solve all my problems.  My dog got worse.  With clicker training and serious attention to fundamental training, he was beautiful.|`|39kZIT9Baa	What is your dog doing? Why does he need to be shocked into doing what you want?

Malachite green usually works the best (unfortunately the parasite is starting to become more resistant to common treatments), and chelated copper sulfate can also work (if you have invertebrates in the tank, make sure the meds are safe for them).  If your fish are salt tolerant, adding salt to the water can improve the treatments effectiveness, but I don't think using salt only is very effective (although some people swear by it).<br>  <br>  Just be patient and vigilant - nothing can cure ich in 48 hours!

AA10029366	Ahhh...a topic close to my heart.<br>  <br>  Remember that the standard describes the ideal dog for the original job. If the dog doesn't conform to the standard, it was not bred for the original job.<br>  <br>  Racing is, obviously, not the Whippet's original job.<br>  <br>  However, this is simply a case for selecting traits in a breed more suited to what you want. If this man didn't cross-breed, the dog comes from a very long line of Whippets; his ancestors were chosen for traits that made them racing dogs, and over the generations, the type and traits in this particular bloodline have changed. The genes and breed have not.<br>  <br>  So, to answer your questions:<br>  <br>  1. If the dog is being bred to work and do a job, I consider it ethical. Maybe not what I consider ideal, but fulfilling a function.<br>  2. Yes. As I said above, if the dog is the result of artificial selection for non-standard traits, it is still a Whippet, born from thousands of generations of Whippets.<br>  <br>  It's a racing Whippet.<br>  <br>  In my breed, there are racing Siberians. They have been bred to compete in races, and don't look like the standard Siberian, or the original import (upon which the Siberian standard was based). But they all go back to the same ancestors as any show winning Siberian, and they are purebred Siberians.|`|ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	I have no problems with breeding to develop a dog for racing, but when he starts breeding for something substantially different from the breed standard then he should call it something else.<br>  <br>  I have to wonder, is there no other existing breed of dog that would fulfil this purpose?|`|kd9kWB8Kaa	if it doesn't fir the standards, i wouldn't think he could race it.|`|xYsCC5UXaa	Have you ever seen two Dobermans side by side, one who's shown, the other who works?<br>  There's quite the difference there.<br>  A show dog adheres and furthers the breed standard. They will have certain requirements for them to really be considered a well-bred dog; and that's the only way they'll be able to be shown.<br>  But a working dog has no requirements other than the fact that it performs at it's job, and it performs it well.<br>  If a dog is being shown AND worked, then it might have a slight advantage on the plain-ol' show dogs who fit the standard perfectly.<br>  <br>  To me, Working dogs, and dogs that both work and are shown, Are of much higher quality and standard than dogs that are just Shown.<br>  <br>  <br>  Answer to Question 1: In my opinion, yes. The dog is being used to perform a function, and it's almost always guaranteed to look different than regular Whippets.<br>  Answer to Question 2: Yes, it should. It's performing the main function of a Whippet dog -- to race. It's build SHOULD be different than that of a Show dog's.<br>  <br>  Hypothetical Answer: It's a Whippet, plain and simple.|`|KxjUim7yaa	I don't see a problem with it as long as he is using Whippets with selective breeding to create a better racing Whippet. Many breeds have the "show" version and the 'working" version.|`|DpT9qJ6Naa	Since a Whippet is an AKC breed, I will base my answer on the guidelines established by AKC.  Please remeber that AKC is just a registery (they register dogs)--it's up to the individual breed clubs to establish breed standards and to "decided" how the breed should look.<br>  <br>  Each breed has a "standard"--think of it as a guideline to how the over all dog should look--i.e. color, size, height, weight, body length, tail carriage, etc.  Ideally, a breeder should breed only to produce dogs than fit within the standard and can meet the overall purpose  (be able to do the job) the dog was developed to do.<br>  <br>  Some breeds do have different sizes--Beagles, Doxies, Poodles--but not Whippets. Just like there is no such thing as a "fiest" or "teacup" chicuhuha--to explain the difference is size.<br>  <br>  Of course, some will breed to suit their own ideals and views--that's why we have 20 lbs toy breeds (oversized) and "apartment sized" (undersisized) Giant breeds.  When a breeder places more emphasis on breeding to produce extremes in size, "rare" colors, and other oddities, they very seldom breed a dog that is true to it's standard.  Is it "good " for a breed?  IMO-No.<br>  <br>  There are many dogs that are over sized for their breed or undersized for their breed.  No, they are not "conformationally correct", but are still considered to be of that breed.<br>  <br>  If both of the dog's parents were true purebreds--then yes, it's a purebred.  Is it well bred?   Well,  That's a question that can only be best answered individually with an opinion.<br>  <br>  Often you can see a visual difference between "hunting" or field dogs and their "dog show" brethen.   Racing Greyhounds look different  from the "dog show" greyhounds.  This dog has been bred to have a better chance at winning races--not winning best in show.  In the show ring it would probably be over sized and be "disqualified".<br>  <br>  Now that doesn't make it a "bad" dog--just one that is not with in the standard.<br>  <br>  IMO-  "designer" dogs--dogs developed by alternating one of more purebreds are not true breeds. It is simply a dog developed and based on the whim of some breeder.|`|F27az9NEaa	Whippet Racing? <br>  If that's anything like the Greyhound Racing Industry, I wouldn't support him for anything.<br>  Is the dog a mix? or is he taking the largest whippets of the litter and breeding them to other larger/stronger whippets to create bigger whippets? If that's the case, yes, they are still Whippets-they just don't fit the breed standard.<br>  <br>  But as for an ethical breeder...I guess that would  depend really.<br>  If he's breeding mixed dogs-then no. just no. If he's breeding for racing (in this case, I'm talking about something that is similar, if it is similar, to the greyhound racing industry) then again I would have to say no.<br>  <br>  But then again if he's breeding dogs that do well in let's say, (lure coursing), and is using purebred whippets, then yes he could be breeding ethically (depending on his breeding practices). I guess the only example I can give is the working German Shepherd vs. the Show German Shepherd, they look different (have slightly different body structure) but are the same dog.'|`|b2df0927cfc00ec0b4a6f61d9c5cd6e5aa	1. If you ask me i would say no it's not ethical due to the fact that he is not breeding for a dog to fit the breed standard or color. If your correct he is not fitting  to the breed.<br>  <br>  2.IF it's pure breed it's still a whippet rather it be a good looking one or not. <br>  <br>  Hypo: It's kinda like those breeding the APBT to be shorter and bulker they are being breed to be the ultimate bully. Most pit bull people will call them American Bullies but thats becuase they are mosre then likey mixed with mastiffs. I guess if enough people caught on and breed the whippet liek that i could be called a sub breed.<br>  <br>  Then again why mess with a dogs standards. No reason to create dogs away from the breed standard on purpose.|`|bIaywrBCaa	not ethical and doesn't sound like a purebred whippet. There are enough breeds, people shouldn't keep trying to make more.|`|y0cbLn0Yaa	Most working dog owners will sacrifice the breed standard to breed the perfect dog to do the job.  Most breeds that are actually in the field working would not win in the show ring - Border Collies, Kelpies, etc.  I think it is sad because I don't see why conformation has to be sacrificed for workability and vice versa.  I can understand it because the underlying focus of each "reason" to breed is different.  Unfortunately usually the show dog owners look down on the working dogs and the working dog owners look down on the show dogs.  It just seems to be the way it is.
YdwwHv8haa	Crested Geckos are arboreal, tree loving, so your enclosure should be more vertical than horizontal. Include branched and places for the gecko to hide. The most important part of the care for crested geckos is there need for humidity. If the gecko is not in an enclosure with at least 60% humidity then the gecko won't be able to stick anything and will have health problems.Ways to increase humidity are spraying the vivarium, adding a water feature (like the exo terra waterfall) or adding plants. <br>   The geckos feel happier with a planted vivarium and because they are from an island is thick rain forest, they need tropical plants. Like I said plants help add humidity, but need care. <br>    Unlike leos, they are more than happy with living in house temperatures, if temperatures exceed or drop below about 70-85 degrees then they become uncomfortable and may even die. The upside to this, is that they don't need any added heating.<br>    One of my favorite things about keeping crested geckos is there ease to feed. My geckos are feed on soely on Repashy Superfoods. The powder can last a gecko for months, and is powder. The powder can kept unrefrigerated and is mixed with water. The powder has absolutely all the needed vitamins for a growing or adult crested gecko. Even though you technically don't need to, I suggest feeding your gecko crickets (coated with calcium) every now in then as a treat and for exercise. <br>    These geckos are great for anyone, as a beginner or expert. They are easy to tame and come in an array of morphs. I suggest buying one from a breeder or expo. Expo prices are always the cheapest, so see if one is coming to a town near you. I don't suggest buying from a pet store because usually the prices are overpriced.
kNYDHZqAaa	I'd recommend putting neosporin (or a similar product) on it, it will help keep the scratches from getting infected and will help them go away faster and scar less.<br>  <br>  If your cat is aggressive and bites/scratches a lot, you might want to consider getting another cat - it really can do wonders. Cats do things like biting and scratching because it is how they play with one another and get out energy. They don't really realize that it hurts you. Aside from changing the litter more often and buying more food, having another cat isn't too much more work and it can make things a lot more peaceful for you!|`|ivOpNL8uaa	im not quite sure but you can put cream on them, and just get your cat a scratching post so it doesn't scratch you. But to be sure you can go to the pet shop or something an ask them if they know any thing. hope it helps.

What I found out is that cats and dogs have anal glands on either side of their anus. Typically, a cat releases them on their own (dragging sometimes helps). Sometimes, they will need some help and can rupture without help. They should only be pea-sized. and somewhat soft.  If your cat drags a lot, then usually a vet or a groomer can release them if needed. Realize that this is relatively unusual and probably won't need to be done.  My cat needed hers done once because they were impacted, but hasn't needed it since.|`|14e4610723b5f7453ddc2705c59f75feaa	I think he might be needing another round of de-wormer.

stCyrS4Eaa	After neutering, keep your pet quiet and limit exercise. Feed only broth until you see your pet’s intestines are working and it is passing gas or defecating normally. Then, provide one meal of easily digested food such as chicken soup and rice. This fully stimulates the intestines, which may be sluggish after anesthesia. Return to normal feeding unless your pet vomits or has no appetite—in which case, notify your veterinarian. <br>  Prevent jumping and running for one week, then slowly increase the amount of activity. Pets that become active too quickly can have several problems: <br>  <br>  scrotal swelling, <br>  pain, <br>  infection, and <br>  an open incision site (dehiscence).|`|zz4JkjbMaa	your Vet should have told you this.

One thing you need to do is dont allow him outside for long periods of time, (5 minutes) as the dirt can get into the incision and infect it. And supervise him alway's. You may need to go back to the vet to get the form that they should have given you.

U6IWoRSRaa	If your dog is light enough to carry, defend your dog. I wouldn't run, because then the dog would chase you. What I would do, is I would always bring a chew toy with me, so that if that happens I would throw the chew toy and the dog would go and get it. Possibly throw it in the direction it came from. Then I'd run or something. Or, I'd bring something loud to scare the dog away. If it's a big dog, do the same thing, because obviously you wouldn't be able to hold it, unless you could... Always make sure you dog is on a lesh! It depends if you fed him at all, I would normally feed the dog before, and bring water along the way. If it's a short walk, you could do either.It also depends if it's hot outside, normally in the summer, I would let the dog drink before, then when we come back I would let the dog eat and drink. =) Hope this helps!!!|`|U1nr0Bc5aa	To be honest, that kind of crap happens all the time.  I would carry pepper spray just in case, and what I tell people when that happens is just what you said.  That a lot of people carry weapons and pepper spray and although you didn't harm his dog, someone else might have.  <br>  <br>  I call animal control when I see dogs off leash as well.  If I can't safely walk my dogs on a leash because other people are being irresponsible, that's not okay.|`|KxjUim7yaa	Feed the dog after. Exercise after eating can cause torsion of the intestines. My dogs eat and then take a nap.|`|9DtJeAUKaa	Feed after. <br>  <br>  You should carry pepper spray & spray the other dogs ONLY if they come at you to attack you or your dog.<br>  <br>  And do NOT be fooled by pitbulls. There's no misconception sweetie. I've worked w/ animals all my life. Domesticated & wild. Pitbulls are dangerous & even the sweetest ones have the ability to snap & turn dispositions. It is their nature, they have been bred like that. The most dangerous ones of course being ones whose owners train them to be aggressive, but all of them have the potential. You would be wise to ALWAYS use EXTREME caution around them. Of course the owner is going to claim the dog is sweet. Oh how sweet, my dogs jaws are locked onto you or your dog & you have blood gushing out, she's really sweet though, that's her way of playing!! RIGHT! <br>  You should report people letting their animals run rampant. Most areas have a leash law!|`|xPPmqNQvaa	Hi~<br>  I have pepper spray myself when walking my dogs. It beats having the large stick I use to carry!~<br>  There's not much you can do but have Something to ward off an attack by another dog. You can also try yelling at it to scare it back before it gets to you. A loud angry voice makes a lot of dogs stop in their tracks.That has worked for me also. <br>  And it's true that if you stare at a strange dog that's staring at you, You are the aggressor to that dog. Isn't that wild? If a dog isn't running to attack you or your dog, act like nothing is amiss. [of coarse you'll be on your toes}<br>  I would also wait til the walk was over before feeding him.<br>  I hope this helps and Good Luck to you & Blaze<br>  <br>  And I just wanted to add this about the Pitt Bull : There are no bad dogs, only bad owners<br>  Any dog who is showered with affection, disciple and socialization with other dogs from a early age will be a well balanced dog no matter what it's breed.
4253fb6106243c0983e2542e5a7a5adaaa	Your base question is a little different than those you ask in your details.  The changes in ratio or percentage to answer your base question cannot be known.<br>  <br>  Would I rather have someone else train my horses vs. me doing it myself?<br>  The answer is "It depends" - if I can have anyone I want train my horse regardless of cost (cost isn't a factor) I'd prefer to have Ed Wright train my horse as in my opinon he's the best there is.  If I must chose someone I can afford, the answer may be different.<br>  <br>  Regarding the older horse giving you more problems than the younger, I expect this would be because the elder horse has learned habits that don't fit with your expectations - you must UN train, then retrain it.  WIth the younger one, you have a clean slate with which to start.  The horse likely hasn't learned any bad habits or attitudes.  Depending on the quality of training and the differences between what you do and waht the previous rider did, the horse could have learned that running the barrels wasn't fun, but was rather work.  Even things like thinking for himself rather than waiting for your cues to respond properly are easy things for a barrel horse to learn on his own.<br>  <br>  I think every situation is different - can a $250 horse beat a $10K horse? Sure.<br>  <br>  Can it do so consistently?  Depends on the level of competition and quality of horse and training of both horses.<br>  <br>  Can it do so consistently enough to win NFR quality competition?  Not likely with today's technology, knowledge and competetion.<br>  <br>  You have to think of many things: if a person spends $10K on a horse, it's likely they have the $ as well to train it well - whether those $ are put into having a pro train their horse or those $ are spent themselves learning to be that great trainer.  <br>  <br>  Look at the asset-the horse - if you had a $10K horse would you pay that much for it if it didn't have potential and you didn't have the money to add value to the original investment?  More than likely not.<br>  <br>  Also, if a person competing at a high level were to seek a horse, do you think they'd look for a $250 horse or a $10K horse?<br>  <br>  So your 3 year old paint may do very well under your own training - and you might beat more well-bred and valuable horses, it's totally possible.  People in this horse industry seem to think that $=value in performance.  While the basic premise is accurate, a poor rider can take a $10K horse and turn it into a $250 horse real quick.  And a really good rider can increase the value of a $250 horse just as well.<br>  <br>  Forget the value of the horse, forget the people who tell you this, go out there, run those barrels and have fun.  Ed Wright will be the first to tell ya (and he says it in all his clinics) if you're not having fun, what's the use?  Having fun releases tension - a horse that doesn't feel tension will be freer and having more fun himself.  A person who's in it mostly to boost their ego and their perceived value to their peers will tend to be touchy, nervous and reactive which their horse will feel.<br>  <br>  I think your value in barrels isn't just how fast you turn 'em - but also in how you treat your horse, how you treat those other humans you encounter and what you're in it for.  There's an awful lot of people out there in it to show everyone how great they are.  The greatest ones are the ones who started out to have fun and learn and help others.  Ask Martha Josey, Charmayne James, Ed or Martha Wright - any of 'em and I bet they'll tell ya they started mostly to have fun.  When they learned they were good at it, then they set their sights on the big time.  I read an article once from Charmayne - she talked about her time at the NFR one season - how shy she was of doing interviews and whatnot, how important her horse's state of mind was, what she did for that horse each day to ensure he was at his peak physically, mentally and emotionally, she talked about making a good impression on kids as she new they were her role models - there was no "I'm here to show how great I am" attitude out of her.  Follow that lead.<br>  <br>  To gain respect, one must be respectful.  To gain trust one must be trustworthy.  To gain honor, one must be honorable.  Be what you want others to see - well you tell people you want to be doesn't make you who you are - you are what people see.|`|UIM8X38Oaa	It just depends on the ability of the horse.  The price you pay has nothing to do with it.<br>  I know someone who payed 500.00 for a horse and it bacame a national champion. <br>  Sometimes you can find great deals on horses,  there is a saying<br>  "a horse is only worth as much as someone will pay for it"<br>  <br>  Good Luck with your horse :)<br>  Jenny|`|QpElKY8Kaa	Better than average.<br>  <br>  Several years ago, a local girl was shipped to Martha Josey on a regular basis.

This sounds more like worried competition that is trying to play mind games with you. Some of the greatest horses in the world did not come with six figure price tags. Charmayne James Scamper was a $1000 horse. And the greatest who ever lived. Good Luck with your horse!|`|jpqt4KEhaa	Maybe they are a little fearful. I think that money is jsut a number I mean I got my horse for free and she is amaxing and my friend payed 600 for her mare and she is amaxing our other friend spent a ton and got a horse that goes lame intermitantly and bucks and is lazy and he is registered and has crazy papers and he is slow and dumb. <br>  <br>  Money doens't mean anything think of seabiscut.|`|AA11570905	I'd rather train my own horse.  These $10,000 horses are started too fast, too young and end up as nut cases in the end.  The people who train these horses are just in it for the money and don't care about the ultimate health of the horse.  The people who buy these horses then think they need to run them hard every weekend, all weekend in order for the horse to earn his purchase price.  They become physical and mental wrecks.  I'd take a 3 or 4 year old, train it to carry a rider and just ride him for a year or two, then show him the patterns and trot or lope the pattern for another year or more.  By taking the training slow (it should take several years to properly train a barrel horse) you will end up with a horse that is better physically and mentally.<br>  <br>  Here is an article that anyone who trains young horses should read and remember:<br>  <a href="http://www.equinestudies.org/ranger_2008/ranger_piece_2008_pdf1.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.equinestudies.org/ranger_2008...</a>|`|IWP0gop5aa	$250 horse has just as much chance as a $10000 or even a $50000. Your horse is obviously worth a lot more than what you got him for. No horse is worth that. You just got lucky. More fool those people who say you will do crap...I'm sure you'll do fine and I hope you beat them all 'cause they sound like stuck up idiots!|`|gDAqEfMoaa	lol same thing happened to me i had a 400.00 horse that beat the 20000 dollar horses and ultimately becoming number one in nbha state of colorado i also had a 400.00 horse that did as well big price tag means either fancy paperwork or success in the arena a cheaper horse is either grade or unbroken so i think you could take a 5 dollar horse and a 5 million dollar horse that's unbroken and the 5 dollar horse will excel same as people rich people arnt better then the  less fortunate it just depends heart has allot to do with it too  they probably feel kinda stupid that they spent that much on a horse when your 250.00 horse is doing so well just ignore them and i will be routing for you good luck!|`|pfUwosyDaa	Well I have been around horses all of my life and I barrrel race my self... the price of the horse doesnt' determine how good the horse is... it is all in the attitude and the trainning... not the price... and as far as the old and young horse you are working with... the older horse is proably set in his ways and just not willing to go any further with the young horse is still green and willing to learn.. so just keep with them and you will do fine...|`|8YXhaTNDaa	I have always trained my own, bought all kinds of horses and if they took to the barrels well that's what we did, and as far as price you go get r done.|`|mYHmFAUfaa	Money is not everything.<br>  I have beat a 50000 dollar horse with a 7500 dollar horse once.<br>  Its all in your confidence and ability.|`|yt4AYZHFaa	price doesn't affect how your horse runs, they are paying for a trainer and a blood line, i've seen horses that people got for free go on and win state rodeos|`|AA10188682	The price doesn't matter... from what i know the price is up that high cause of it geniology. And dont get some one else to train your horse. It will make it hard on you and the animal when it comes to competion and the horse does something you don't think it should do when it was supposed to do that for another person. So if you buy a horse for $10 and run it agianst a horse that cost $10000 and your horse wins. It is probably because you trained it the way it needed to be trained to win.|`|UyKMwdrAaa	I firmly believe its the horse and his agility that will succeed it's not how much you paid for the horse.  There have been some awfully expensive barrel horses that have not done well.  So if you feel confident that this horse has the speed and agility to do barrels well, and he is proving himself don't let anybody tell u different.  You've had the experience of 20 years under your belt and u can tell a good one when u see one.  If u don't feel confident to train this new horse then yes i would get a trainer but with all your years of experience i think u would be wasting your money.  Good luck and go with your gut feeling.|`|4mmTyMglaa	They are just worried.  If your $250 horse beats their $10,000 horse it makes them look silly for paying so much.<br>  <br>  Besides, the horse market has been down for a while.  $250 gets you a lot more horse then it did 5 or 10 years ago.|`|u1HahCoqaa	Just because you got the horse for nothing does not mean, really, that it is worthless. Although usually horses are priced by how good they are, you still see horses in the hands of people who do not realize their potential value- also, how good a horse does depends on the rider as well.  I knew this horse off the track who they got for cheap- she was basically a nutcase, to put it nicely. But it turned out she was a phenomanal jumper, a great eventer. But the sellers never knew that, did they?<br>  <br>  Just ignore them. People who make comments like that are simply pathetic little snobs- really, it is none of their buisiness- thats something you see in rich little kids who are parading their $15,000 horse infront of their friends, not grown adults.|`|cSqx1DxKaa	Honestly, it's impossible to say.  Price tags don't necessarily mean a thing, especially if a great horse happens to sell for a low price or vice versa.  Price is not always indicative of quality.  The proof will be in the pudding when you put your horse up against the more expensive ones.  Good luck!|`|9LH3Dz5Laa	it doesnt matter about how much the horse costs, its more about how much training and how fast they are<br>  just cause they cost a couple thousands doesnt mean they will run<br>  <br>  my parents bought a horse from the slaughter house for me for $25 and fattened him up, my dad broke him out- trained him as a roper, cutter, barrel and all around trail horse <br>  after my dad was finished with him, ANYONE could ride this horse, he was great for beg. and fun for adv. -its like he could tell the difference,<br>  but his last year he ran was when he was 27 years old and i took him in the barrel class up against 5-15year olds who were really fast and top of the line--he took home first place, they were all giving me hateful looks after that cause my old, cheap horse had beat all of their expensive, young horses <br>  <br>  so yeah it could happen|`|Pm8nsCGZaa	Here ya go......<br>  Born in 1977, Scamper’s registered name is Gills Bay Boy. When this “wild little bay” sent his first trainer to the hospital, Scamper was put up for sale. Charmayne’s father purchased him for $1,100, thinking that was too much to pay for a horse that had to be ridden for a half hour so he didn’t buck. In 1984, a veterinarian advised Charmayne that Scamper “just wouldn’t hold up” to barrel racing’s stresses - that same year the pair won their first championship - their first of ten in a row! In 1995, Scamper was inducted into the ProRodeo Hall of Fame (timed-event horse category) in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Besides his 10 World Championships.......|`|bI7wMCJXaa	I paid $4300 for my OTTB that performs just as well as my trainer's horse she paid 10x more for.<br>  <br>  You're right in assuming the the price of the horse has absolutely nothing to do with ability to compete. Someone just paid for paperwork and fancy bloodlines, at least I would hope. I've seen some five figure train wrecks too.<br>  <br>  The people that told you he won't be good as their expensive horses I can explain that in one word: Jealousy. Or maybe: fear.<br>  <br>  Enjoy your horses. You obviously have a good eye to pick up a $250 horse and turn it into something amazing. Good luck and have fun!

0e4ec90e978769f9222aded1018a21f5aa	I have six cats, so I know that it is nearly impossible to train them and if you yell at them to go lay down they won't listen to you lol. <br>  <br>  My cats also tried to be very affectionate at night while I was sleeping. I ended up shutting the door to keep them out, but like yours they would just sit outside and meow and scratch.<br>  <br>  The only thing I found that helped was to get a plastic spray bottle and I would squirt them under the door when they meowed or scratched. Eventually they just stopped doing it all together. I guess they finally figured out if they meowed at the door they would just get squirted.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, good luck!|`|4aAhEK9daa	This poor cat.  It's lost your grandmother - who probably lavished him affection - and is now in your house where it's completely denied.  You obviously are not capable of showing affection so please find a family that will love this poor cat.  He's probably vomiting due to hairballs as I'm sure you don't bother grooming him, either, and longhaired cats need regular grooming. <br>  <br>  I really can't believe you said he's "always doing something bad" when the poor thing is just trying to get attention.  And that your other cat that "keeps to himself" is "well behaved".  Why do you have a cat if you never interact with it?  It's a living creature - not a piece of furniture.  I pity both of these poor, unloved cats.  Why are you so cold to them????  Very, very sad and says a LOT about your character.|`|beLTXTg7aa	Perhaps you could shut him downstairs at night then you wouldnt hear him!|`|WJhGfrDhaa	He is probably stressed out too. New home, another cat around, and no more 'grandma'  Give him time you should also get some treats from pet store or Walmart for hairball control I get the Whiskas crunchy ones my cats love them I also feed them Indoor cat food has natural greens in them and no more hairballs and 8 cats that is amazing to me.  |`|NGmRMqe6aa	It sounds like he is having a emotional crisis. He is traumatized by the move and is trying to get some emotional support from you in the only way he knows how. I bet if you just reach out and grab him stuff him under the covers and love him up he will eventually calm down. It may take him a while so bear with him please.|`|FJz8GVbWaa	he's missing your grandma and wants some attention from his new owners (you). be patient with him while he adjusts to his new surroundings and family. |`|sJWriIDKaa	Train him and be nice to him.|`|YDUZdUMHaa	Well first of all: how old is he? He's probably old because your grandma had him, but when I first got my cat and he was a kitten he would throw up randomly because we were accidentally feeding him adult cat food.<br>  I could understand if the cat is throwing up because he's agitated, though. Try cuddling with him more during the day so maybe he'll get sick of you and want his personal time to be at night, [lol] or let him fall asleep then move him to the other side of your bed, maybe to your feet. I do that to my cat all the time, he barely opens his eyes when I move him and he's just as happy purring against my leg.<br>  As annoying as he sounds, he must be a cutie! Cherish the times you have with him....good luck!!!|`|rI9HiYSFaa	My cat was ALWAYS waking me up at night until I discovered a little trick.  Put your vacuum in the doorway to your bedroom, switch it to on, and put the cord near your bed so that you can easily plug it in.  Trust me you will only need to plug it in a few times with it going on far away that he will associate the noise with the bad habit and quit doing it.  I will tell you though, when I have company and have to put the vacuum away, he wakes me up again!  So remember to keep it out in the doorway.
zMXDolD9aa	How old is she? The younger they are, the more they appreciate the money i would say. If she was simply just coming round each day to feed the pets, i'd suggest $15-$20 but if she's walking the dog aswell i'd increase it quite a bit. If she's taking time out to come and look after your pets, appreciate it. People who actually come and do it as their job would expect more than a neighbour. Maybe give her some money and buy her a gift from your vacation (or wherever you're going) as a gift.|`|mh0QRDE9aa	$150 Total,  but she will have to take the dog for a walk more than once a day.  Is she going to clean up if the dog messes up the house or it does its business in the house?  Also depends on how hold she is and if she is responsible enough.  Otherwise, a boarding kennel may be your best solution.|`|28834ea3162329035a24ce080e7020edaa	$5 a day?

I had a 'business' like this one summer when I was young (15 years ago) and I charged $10 a day and I thought that was A LOT.  Maybe a little too much.  I walked the dog twice a day for atleast a 1/2 hour, brushed them daily, took them out 2 other times during the day for exercise and to poo and fed them twice daily.  $140 for a little kid for two weeks is a lot.<br>  <br>  I had a dog walking 'business' too and I was paid $2/day for 6 months.|`|AA11560792	tell her if she does a good job you will give her 200 dollars when you get back... dont give it too her up front cause some teens think they got the money they dont have to do much... but if you make her wait she will do a good job cause she is really gonna want the 200 good luck.....|`|lZiBRhGyaa	about 80 is what people pay me.<br>  <br>  for just feeding a cat for 1 week i got 50 dollars..|`|8YXhaTNDaa	If it was me I would give the Kid $5 a day, thats still a lot cheaper than a kennel, both of my teenagers do a lot of petsitting.|`|0vkLOl7zaa	i pet sit and get about 30 bucks for two wks

Who knows!<br>  <br>  Research confirms what pretty much every dog owner knows: dogs dream when they sleep, just like people do.<br>  <br>  Dogs have different phases of sleep, just like humans do. The only difference is in the length of time. Our sleep cycles tend to be longer, but like people, dogs go through slow wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep.

If you must help her with any grasp the pup around its entire body gently and pull steady.

f4da67d78496875ebabbba2de441fdc7aa	No.  Color of light is the same as wavelength, different wavelengths produce different colors and they are NOT interchangeable.  Green isn't blue and I'm pretty sure that the red light is for heat so you can't replace that one.  Each bulb has a specific function in addition to just providing light, if you figure that out and you can then look for other bulbs that do the same thing but there isn't really any color options as certain colors are best for certain purposes.<br>  <br>  Party lights might appear to be the same color as what you are using but are not designed for the same use-ie: a red party light won't provide the same heat of the red light.  Not all of the reptile bulbs' ouputs are visible light, a lot of it is either outside the visible spectrum or are indistinguishable to a human.

They mke pellets as well, but it's a little more expensive.|`|Xyj4nmFnaa	super solvitax cod liver oil or another reputable cod liver oil supplement.|`|NOAwpvcTaa	Look for a supplement with Glucosamine and Chrondroitin (sp?) in it. That is what I use for my gelding
TNTFomKeaa	OK, this is what you have to do. First, make sure that you're sitting really tall and still when you ask your horse to move forwards. Give a bit with your hands so that she is allowed to move forwards. A lot of beginners pull back with their hands to balance when they kick. This just confuses the horse, and she won't go forward. When you ask for an upwards transition, pull your stomach muscles in and sit really tall. This makes you easier to carry and takes the weight off her front end so it's easier for her to speed up.<br>  Secondly, have a three strikes rule with the horse. First, ask lightly. For me, this would be using my voice, clucking or saying woah. If this doesn't work, back it up with a light hand or leg aid. If the horse still doesn't do what you want, you've asked politely. Now you can do whatever it takes to make them go or stop. The horse soon learns (like in two minutes) that it's better to do what they're told than to get into a fight. Once she does what you want, be nice again. Make it clear that she has a choice. Either she does exactly what you tell her, right away, or there will be trouble. <br>  Thirdly, get the horse really listening to you. Turn circles. Do transitions. Focus on getting a quick response and reward the horse when she does what you tell her. Pat her neck or say "good girl". <br>  Now for when she puts her head down. Do yourself a favor and get some gloves. If she puts her head down, don't pull back. You will get into a tug-of-war and you won't win. Instead, give her a kick and make her trot on. She'll have to pick her head up and you can shorten up your reins again.<br>  Think to yourself, if your trainer rode the horse, would she behave this way? She'd be really good for her probably. And this isn't just about riding skill. It's about attitude. Your trainer expects the horse to do what she's told, every time. So tomorrow, get on that horse and pretend that you're your trainer. You're not going to take any nonsense. <br>  I've seen this happen so many times with my horse. She gets used for lessons and she messes about because she can. She doesn't trot when she's told, the rider gets tired and gives up. So my horse wins - she gets to walk, and the rider gets tired. If I get on her, we have a fight for about five minutes when she doesn't want to do any work and she wants me to ride like the lesson riders do. I remind her that I won't take any nonsense. Then she's as good as gold after that. So you have to do what I do. Sure, the first five minutes of your lesson are going to be tough. Even if you get tired of telling the horse what to do, make her do it anyway. Make sure you win every time she tries to be lazy, and she'll figure out it's easier to do the work. Good luck!|`|VmZKZjP1aa	There are some great tips here. I would add to make sure she is being exorcised before you ride. Like put her in a round pen, or lunge her. Horses tend to be better behaved if they get some of that P&V out before you ride. <br>  <br>  Try lunging her for 10+ min. before you ride.|`|AA12144656	Sounds to me like she needs some ground work.  If she will do things on the ground, she'll do it in the saddle. DVD's helped me learn how to do this and get their respect.  Sounds like it's time for you to learn some things, make it a fun thing.  Clinton Anderson's site was my favorite.|`|rbLdJ6Iiaa	look up Monty Roberts and take a look at his way of training!!! its so cool and if you do it right it will totally work!!!<br>  <br>  www.montyroberts.com<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_gw?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=monty+roberts&x=0&y=0" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_gw?url...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dx91mH2voo" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dx91mH2v...</a>|`|UIM8X38Oaa	It sounds like a smart old lesson horse taking advantage of you and your trainer is telling you to be more assertive with her.<br>  <br>  You will just have to practice and don't worry about how you look, you are a beginner it takes time to figure it out.<br>  <br>  You will improve with time, hopefully your traininer will give you tools to help.  Ask her if you can change the bit so she is not pulling on your hands so hard.  <br>  <br>  Good Luck, You will Do It!!<br>  Just keep working on it.<br>  Jenny|`|gDh1t1Yyaa	My pony was EXACTLY THE SAME AS HER.<br>  Except he was a gelding.<br>  If he didn't like something, he'd stop.<br>  If he wanted to go home, he'd turn around and go home.<br>  You've just gotta be domnating. If the horse stops, quick her on, loosen your reins and push forward in your seat. I got taught to use my reins if he was playing up, like a crop. The minute she tried to move stop her again. If she starts playing up, backing up etc, get someone to stand with you. My horse used to do it, 2nd I rode a horse and rode him he was rearing up because he didn't want to stand still. I got him out of it though; you've just gotta let her know who's boss. If you get nervous when she keeps walking off, don't portray it in your body language. If you tense up, she'll know you're nervous. And most of all, follow your instincts.|`|XXPgh3FTaa	Horses are smart and can feel every emotion so remember to stay calm on her so she doesn't know your nervous.  It isn't unusual that the horse would try to take advantage of you, just remember Your The Boss.<br>  <br>  Use your heels and add alittle more oomph to get her going, you cant be afraid of her and you have to be smart.  Another tip for you is that a horses ears goes where its eyes go so try to keep attention on the horses attitude.|`|8YXhaTNDaa	Never say cant. Horses are smart animals they also can feel that you are nervous, you need two work on yourself first than make her do what you want her to do sounds like she's got you intimidated, first start bonding with her do a lot of groundwork get to know each other, and your trainer is right kick harder get some spurs.|`|0nBZnca8aa	I would lunge the horse before i get on it. and if your standing still and that horse wants to go turn it in circles. And about the head thing ask your trainer if he/she has a german martingale. Hope you have fun.!|`|7xOhg2F7aa	Don't be afraid to be firm. i thought firm was a soft squeeze on teh girth at first, but when i finally realized a smart kick behind the girth and light pressure on the reins wouldn't hurt them, I was a much better rider. Try being firm but forgiving and supportive. It's a hard balance but once mastered you will be a much better rider.<br>  However, if this persists, just ask your trainer for another horse. They may just need a person with a bit more expierience (no offence!!!) to get the message across a little better.|`|WPGU48Kuaa	Oh my oh my.  Your trainer should find you another horse that is more geared for beginners.  This horse has some obvious and plain serious vices that need to be dealt with before someone gets hurt.  If you do not feel that you are in complete control of this horse....DO NOT GET ON HER.  That is asking for an accident.  You are NOT going to look like an idiot if you ask for another horse or refuse to ride this one until she is trained PROPERLY.  She is not a horse for a beginner if she does not listen to subtle cues and you have to use a stick!!  Please, ride a different horse......or find another trainer who is more concerned for your safety....and the safety of others around you!!|`|tWTJ4CSIaa	Sounds like you are nervous about not having the back up of a crop to MAKE her listen.  Remember, you can always use your hand, just reach back behind you and hit her as hard as you can on the rear (as hard as you can with your hand isn't very hard compared to a crop, don't worry)  <br>  <br>  Also, it sounds like she isn't really untrained, just taking advantage of you and being mean.  My old horse was like this.  Try lunging her first.  Not too long because then she will be tired but maybe like 10-15 mins each way.  Use a lunging whip and verbally ask for trot and canter like you do when you ride.  If she doesn't respond, tap her immediatly with the whip and ask again, if she still doesn't hit her harder until she does it as soon as you ask.  Work on trransitions up and own and up and down for 10 mins then switch her direction and strat over again for another 10 mins.  What you are doing here is making her understand that a. you mean business and b. that she has to do what you say.  <br>  <br>  Then once you first get on, make it VERY clear that you will not tolerate her taking advantage of you.  If you ask nicely and she doesn't go, hit her rear or kick as hard as you can.  Hopefully, she will realize you mean it and you won't have to do it but 3 or 4 times.  <br>  <br>  Also, you could ask for a spur.  It works the same but then you have to rely on your leg and not your arms.  Used correctly though spurs can be much more effective.  Tell your trainer that you think you need some help riding and since she wants you to ride off your leg more, you thought a spur might be a good way to start.<br>  <br>  Don't be nervous, that only makes things worse, you'll be fine... your trainer will help you (that's what she's there for) GOOD LUCK!
K1YHSR3oaa	Oddly enough, there is rape in all species.  We just don't consider it "rape" generally because we don't always understand mating rituals of species.

nFcl0BOsaa	I gather you are not gone more than a few hours at a time. Install a lock on your bedroom door. Crate Louie so he doesn't use your bedroom for a toilet or chew the carpet.  Set a deadline for your boyfriend's family to be out of your home, and if they don't meet it you have some decisions to make. In a situation like this, you may have no legal right to kick them out. If that is the case, if I were you, I would move out.  Every second you will have to be watching your dog because of the pee pads that are all around the house. Get a a baby gate and either confine the dog with the pee pads to one room or confine Louie to a room where there are no pee pads. Really you should demand she housetrain her dog if it's going to be in your home, it is disgusting and lazy to let a dog eliminate in the house. But the woman sounds like a trainwreck, I don't see how you would be able to get her to do anything.<br>  <br>  P.S. Certain types of crates can be securely padlocked. <br>  <br>   I hope Louie has been cratetrained. If he barks and whines simply because he can hear the activity in the house, you can leave a sound machine playing white noise (similar to static) in your bedroom.<br>  <br>  When you are home, you can keep Louie by your side by attaching his leash to your belt.<br>  <br>  You could use a pen in your (locked) bedroom if he had not had this setback in housetraining. (Not his fault, I know.)  Get whatever lock(s) you need to stop her.  You shouldn't have to defend this, it's your dog. But you can say Maltese will develop bad traits if they are allowed to take over as the boss of the house.  I would be extremely worried about the safety of my toy dog around such irresponsible people.|`|1Z4XGmWbaa	Unfortunately, your situation is more on training the humans around your dog than training your dog. He's getting mix signals and this will confuse and frustrate him. Your Bf's family needs to respect your wishes, if they can't then they gotta go. This is your house right? The peeing on the wee wee pad isn't a bad thing as long as it's on the pad, the acts of destroying things is a sign of frustration. Don't take it out on the dog, tell your bf to talk to his family to respect your wishes. Good luck.|`|9pDEhA1Xaa	I am amazed that with all these people in your house, that the biggest problem you have with all this is,.....THE DAMM DOG!!!!

Id tell him he needs to tell her - I don't really know if its your place to confront her, as awkward as it might be a big discussion/fight about it might make her realise how much it bothers you....You need to basically pull a "MY HOUSE MY RULES" type stance...if she does not like it she can move out - the thing is, your boyfriend has to feel the same way....otherwise maybe you move out with your dog until they are gone? do you have family you can stay with for a bit?|`|fd7190dbf41367abef107c3ae34b04cbaa	its your house. you set your boundries if your boy friend objects then he is not respecting boundries either  ill tell you if you dont get a handle on thes your the one that willl want to move out and leave them all together     sorry to hear this is tough but you gotta take a stand and let what ever happens happen good luck   have a house meeting and let them know your stuff in a diplomatic way   ask first if they are finding things well and if they are comfortable  after that then you say its an adjustment but there are a few things that i need to say  also and then take a deep breath and say it  just remember that Mark Twain lived through many tradgities and problems  non of which ever happened  what im saying is that we build up stuff in our own minds and think that that is the way it will turn out but how often does it turn out that way    almost never so take your shot kid  they will get over it|`|kvHqnR5Haa	Did they just move in with you for a short time?

Unfortunately some people are too stubborn to listen.  My dad is the same way - my mom watches my dog while I am at work and I don't table feed him, but when my dad is around he sneaks him whatever he can because he thinks it makes him the good guy.

If your boyfriend chooses his family over you, then it's time to find a new boyfriend, too.|`|VNvVhDWgaa	One alternative to the kennel, is to have a family sit down. Tell EVERYONE EXACTLY how you feel about this and that you think it's unhealthy for a dog to eat people food, that you do not want him running loose in the house unless you are there... and put a LOCK on your bedroom door so that your boyfriend's mom can't let him out anymore. That might be a cheaper and easier solution.
EGsMBfljaa	The guppies would not be good. Because if you have male guppies, the betta will think they are fighters and kill them. Tetras are great tank buddies. I have Neon tetras and black tetras with my betta. I also have two OttoCats in the tank aswell.<br>  There is a great site that has alot information about Siamese (Betta).<br>  There is more awesome info there about tankmates.

Hope I helped alittle.|`|eyKx05LKaa	The neon tetras would be, but I'm not sure about the guppies.  You are suppose to avoid any long finned fishes, because the Betta might mistake them as another male betta and attack them.<br>  <br>  Other suggestions:  Hatchets, minnows, danios, cory catfish|`|rrLHU6ehaa	I hope you mean 35L gallon, not 35 liter.<br>  If 35 liter, about 9 US gallons, the Betta and neons might go together.  Neons may nip at the slow-moving Betta's fins, but if you have a plakat, that shouldn't be a problem.  Leave out the guppies.  They might get along, but I wouldn't chance it.<br>  If a 35 gallon, there's plenty of room with a minimum of bickering, but I'd suggest at least 1 more neon and some bottom fish.

I asked her if she had EVER had problems w/ amyloidosis... her response was no. I later found out from another breeder that a cat purchased from that same individual had died of amyloidosis & a copy of the pathology report given to her. So much for honesty. My stud is now part of a study to develop a DNA test for this genetic disease.<br>  -----------<br>  Easiest way for a breeder to get away w/ saying "NEVER HAD A PROBLEM" is to sell all kittens young, never perform DNA tests or sonograms or other health screening & never have a post done on a dead cat. As long as they have never had substantial proof of a problem w/in their cattery they can bury their head in the sand & *claim* not to have the problem.

But is she breeding to the standard and breeding to show her cats?  Or is she just breeding Persians to sell as pet kittens.<br>  <br>  That would be the biggest factor on whether I'd buy.  Lots of long time established reputable breeders probably do not test for PKD because their cats have been healthy.<br>  <br>  Its only a resent thing among the Persians that have come to light - so not sure where it really came from that its in some of the lines now.|`|oDVx7nSxaa	Not buy - because she's a back yard breeder.  She *says* she's been breeding for 22 years, and has never had a problem in her lines.  Sorry to be so blunt - but talk is cheap, especially when there is money to be made.  A reputable breeder does test for this, and will be happy to provide you with real documentation that it's not in their line.  Without the proper testing, you have no idea what you're getting, and could be looking at heartbreak in a couple years.
A7XV2K3Paa	My concern would be that typically moving a cat to a unknown place causes stress. Cats in general do not like changes. Does he know the other animals? If he doesn't I'm not sure that I would take him. If you do, I would shut him in one room and keep him there until he seems comfortable. I think I would also ask the vet.|`|UADLdXBtaa	He will probably have to stay overnight at the vet hospital and then be pretty sore and lethargic for the next week anyway. He would be much happier at home, even if you aren't there 24/7. Depending on how he is with other animals and how protective your parent's cats are of their territory, it may cause him to be anxious and worry about being attacked or eaten by the dog (even if he isn't a threat, the cat doesn't know that). He doesn't need all that on top of the pain he will be in.|`|AA11644298	I would take him with you.  He's going to be pretty out of it for at least a day and you'll need to watch him.  It sounds like the other animals are pretty tame, so I don't think they'll mess with him.  I think they'll be able to sense that he doesn't feel well and leave him alone.|`|AA12107238	I think he would be much happier going home from surgery to his own environment.  If your going to visit with him everyday and give him love and attention he will be much better in his own home.  Surgery will be enough stress.|`|hm8QR95Kaa	I'd say bring him but if hes just ben neutered he will just want to be left alone. Leave him at home with plenty of food ( maybe caned and dry)water & warm softy  bed and let him rest stress free. It will be ok.|`|3Hf3YtyKaa	I think it would be ok- just check with the vet to make sure|`|pDPSaL37aa	I think he would much rather stay at home. You don't want to stress him out by introducing him to so many other animals and bringing him to a new house right after he's had surgery. You never know what the other pets will do to him. The dog may be used to the 2 cats that live with him, but he may attack your cat. You should keep him at home and just check on him every other day. As long as he has fresh food, water and the cone around his head, he should be fine.|`|X6PDtlq4aa	No, I'd leave the kitty to recover in an environment he's used to. Any foreign environment may stress him out and that with the stress and pain of the surgery may not be good for him. Make sure he has plenty of food and a water fountain preferably if you have one and let him recover on his own. He'll be happier that way. After surgery they don't want to be touched much anyway.|`|CuGT5X6eaa	you would probably be better off leaving him at home,so he knows where he is,you should see if you could make a new appt with the vet and get him neutered after the house sitting is over....but,if thats not possible,then I would recommend leaving him home,because adjusting to a new environment after that would probably cause alot of stress.|`|FDgarm4Zaa	i think you should take him with you.<br>  i dont have a boy cat, but i have a girl, and after we spayed her she was very sleepy and dependent. she didn't do anything alone.<br>  i would comfort him and stay with him. :)|`|I3jYOT9haa	I think it would be okay. We had my cat neutered and not long after we moved to a new house and he was okay. Just make sure you keep an eye on him :] Hope I helped.|`|14e4610723b5f7453ddc2705c59f75feaa	Everything I've read says to keep your cat's environment as normal to them as possible.  I would say keep him at his own house.  Also, cats generally are very private, but especially when hurting or nervous.  I would check in on him as often as possible (make sure he's going to the bathroom), but besides that, just make sure he's comfortable and has his food and water and a clean litter box.  Too much change for a cat isn't good, especially when he's hurting (and had enough with his SEVERE change in schedule!)  =)  He may think, "Geez, first THIS and now I have to deal with other pets, a new house, new smells, and everything?!"  LOL  Also, you never know how pets will react to having an unknown animal in the house.  Especially an injured one.  I'd vote to keep him at home.  Good luck, and give him a hug for me!!!!  =)|`|4D7nhSHnaa	The day he comes home is the most critical.  This is when he needs you most.  They are still under the anesthesia effects.  They will sleep a lot, but also may have the urge to do his usual stuff, like jump off the bed, or wanna jump onto the window sill... These things they are NOT supposed to do for at least 24 to 48 hours.  You need to make sure he does not vomit while recovering.  After the first or day and a half, they return to their normals selves.<br>  My Bradley was neutered Dec. 19th, so I just experienced all of the above.  I would rather he be with me for the first couple of days.  Just set him up in the room where you will be, have familiar things in there for him and he will be fine.  If you want you can take him back home after the first day and a half.  But its little things (like possibility of vomiting) that has to be watched right after procedure.<br>  Hope this helped.|`|xwSNEYICaa	I would suggest leaving your cat at home for the first day or two.  He will be sleepy after the neuter and probably won't even notice you are gone.  Obviously, check in on him.  If he seems to be healing fine, I would take him with you and see how he does.  You can always take him back home.  Just keep in mind that after a neuter, you need to use shredded paper for litter for the first 5 days.  Two older cats may not like that, and act out by not using the litter box.  <br>  <br>  I just had my cat neutered a few months ago, and he did fine, just was sleepy the first day or so.  I have two poodles that play with him all the time, and he was running around, chasing them, and wrestling them on the second day.  He is also a very personable cat, so much so that we have had to unplug our printer at night, because he has figured out not only how to turn it on, but he walks on the button until he faxes or prints a test page, just so he can jump down and attack the paper coming out.  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|kNYDHZqAaa	If you DO decide to take him to your parents house, you should probably try to keep him separate from the other animals. If he's like most cats, then he'll probably be a little freaked out by all of the new animals. Keeping him in a separate part of the house could let you monitor how he's doing and give him attention without the stress of new animals.|`|LoNHfIpPaa	I think you should take him with you,at least for the first couple of days. Just to make sure hes ok,and his wound is healing properly. If you think hes doing good after that,and hes not comfortable at your parents house,take him home.

SHe LOVES boys!<br>  <br>  Mischief Trouble (aka Baby Boy or Son)- age 5.  All black except two white spots he's always determined to hide!  He can't meow worth squat!  Its still a 'kitteny' sounding meow, high pitched and annoying.  He's in love with people food and will do whatever it takes to get it!  He also likes getting into trouble with Stripes, usually trying to get his way with her, though he's fixed.  He likes to cuddle on HIS terms and you had better cuddle with him or he sulks around the house meowing his whiny meow.  He also has a thing for burying things that offend his nose, which usually means the hubby's work socks!  He also tries to bury his food and water dish, the nut!  He was the only boy in a litter of calicos too.  He got his name by messing with the girls and being a very mischievious kitten.  He's since mellowed some, thank goodness!<br>  <br>  My girls were from my grandparents, Grandma gave me Tiger, and Grandpa gave my nephews' Stripey.

He figured out how to step on the right button to turn it on.  In the last 4 nights he has made a copy, faxed 3 times, and printed 2 test pages.  He always waits until we are in bed, then presses different buttons to make something print, just so he can attack it.

stCyrS4Eaa	You need to prove to your mom that you can be responsible around the house. Help with dishes, lawn care, etc. Ultimately, depending upon your age, she will be the one responsible for the dog. She will be taking it to the vet, she will be paying for the food, shots, etc. You may be growing up and going off to college within that dog's lifetime. Keep all that in mind too.|`|oQ5oKILHaa	If she isn't allergic or anything I would build a good argument around the fact that she won't need to be responsible for the dog.

f4da67d78496875ebabbba2de441fdc7aa	Feed your turtles a good commercial food (reptomin is one of the beat and you can get even it at Walmart) in a volume equal to the turtle's head for EACH turtle at each feeding. For turtles over 6" long you should only feed them once every other day (twic daily if under 3"), if you can't stand the begging, give them veggies between meals. Overfeeding is very bad for the turtles' health as the shell can't grow fast enough and they can suffocate (but if the turtle is UNDER 4" it's nearly impossible to overfeed-babies need to eat constantly). Veggies and fruits are freebies, remember to only feed RES or other aquatic/semi aquatic turtles while they are in the water or they can't swallow properly and will choke. Live food should also be fed regularly: blood worms, blackworms, feeder guppies, rosy red minnows, ect. Shrimp (alive, frozen, dried, ect) is too salty for anything other than occasional treats. Goldfish will slowly poison turtles.<br>  <br>  Turtles of any species need 10 gallons of water per INCH of shell length. Even the smallest turtles need a 55 gallon tank (you can't fill a tank fully with turtles or they will get injured climbing out from either the water or basking spot and fall to the floor). This doesn't include the space taken up by the "land"-one of those floating docks seems to work best and doesn't take up any swimming room. Most aquatic turtles only need a basking spot large enough for them to be completely out of the water-no other land needed. A cheap alternative to a large aquarium are those plastic storage tubs (the ones with wheels crack too easily). My 12 month old (I know when he hatched) *male* RES has a shell that is nearly 6" long and already needs 60 gallons of water. Females can get as large as 16 inches long-in just the shell. Bigger tanks are also easier to take care of.<br>  <br>  My 13 month old male (smaller than a female) is already over 6 inches and should be in a 75 gallon aquarium. RES (the most common pet) and most other pet turtles you buy are true aquatic turtles and only leave the water to lay eggs and to bask. That's it. <br>  <br>  Keeping them in a too small tank won't keep them small-that logic only works for goldfish and even then they don't stop growing until they're too big.<br>  <br>  The tank also needs a basking spot (don't have it so it cuts down the swimming space) where the turtles can completely dry off (the turtle docks are great but make sure you don't use the bottom two suction cups). A heat producing light bulb needs to be focused on the basking spot so that the temperature is 95-105 degrees. You also need a UVB specific lamp over that spot so that the turtles can metabolize calcium and make sure that there is not glass or plastic in the way because UVB can't travel through it. I use a mercury vapor bulb that produces both heat and UVB, it's more esxpensive but costs less than two separate bulbs and fixtures.<br>  <br>  You also need a water heater to keep the water 75-85 degrees but make sure it is sheilded (pvc with lots of 1/4" holes works really well) somehow or the turtle will burn itself on it (they don't know it's too hot until it's too late). Petstores usually carry one specifically for turtles that is preset and already sheilded. If the water isn't above 70, the turtles can't digest their food and it will rot in their stomachs.<br>  <br>  Filters are good, make sure you use one raterd for 2-3x the capacity of the tank as turtles are messy.<br>  <br>  NEVER use rocks or gravel smaller than the turtles' heads. They are known to swallow them occasionally and it will kill them.|`|EDOxXdcoaa	Aquatic turtles are almost strictly carnivorous when they're young so feeder shrimp, feeder fish, and feeder insects are options. As is the raw fish fillets you can buy at the grocery store. You can cut bite-size chunks of it for your turtle and keep the rest in the fridge/freezer to use as needed or until it has to be thrown out. There is also commercially available turtle foods but it can be hit or miss with some turtles. Provide fresh vegetables and dark leafy greens as well, but younger turtles may not accept it in the beginning. Older turtles will still feed on fish and other small aquatic animals (provided it can catch them) but be more apt to incorporate more greens and vegetables in their diet.|`|ld2vmypNaa	<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/29035692@N03/sets/72157612827773738/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/photos/29035692@N0...</a><br>  <br>  This is my care for  of my 5 sliders. Two who are 37 yrs old next month. Plus 5 adopteed males.<br>  <br>  Aquatic Turtles are a life long commitment.<br>  <br>  Remember 10 gallons for every inch of turtle.. 55 gallon to start, if the turtle is larger than 2" across.<br>  ***You need a heater...set at 80 degrees. If water is cold they will stop eating! <br>  <br>  Sliders, westerns, cooters , midland, painted, map, yellow bellied all are basically the same and require the same basic care. <br>  They NEED calcium and protein they get it from the fish meat and the fish bones. Drop 20 or 30 or so feeder guppies or small goldfish (or minnows they maybe a bit fast for babies) at first just drop in the tank and watch them disappear in a few days! The more they eat the healthier the turtle.<br>  **** If these are hatchlings a 1” and a tad over they may need to have their live food half dead by leaving the fish out of water for a few minutes (10minutes) and put in the tank. That way the baby can get the meat he needs and the fish can’t out run the baby turtle.<br>  Plus some leafy green and vitamin A fruits cut up a few times a week. Swollen cloudy eyes comes from lack of Vitamin A. Which we all need for good eyes. <br>  <br>  Plus I also feed dried cubed blood worms or tubiflex worms or pellets at least 5 times a week for my five..<br>  They can have garden worms which I collect after a good rain and dump them un the pond, also meal worms, snails, crickets, flies, crayfish small frogs, slugs, tadpoles, shost shrimp ,dragon flies and anything that moves, but only as a treat.<br>  They need leafy greens Romaine, Butter lettuce. (Iceberg and cabbage are bad for them, any other leafy greens will do) for vitamin A that they need at least 4 to 5 times a week.<br>  They love grapes and strawberries and squash , apples.<br>  These turtles in captivity do not hibernate their eating may slow down some but they will not hibernate. They cannot hear or see well so they feel you coming by the vibrations each foot step take. And in the winter their appetites slow down some.<br>  TOSS in a bird cuttle bone in the water for calcium that will promote better shell growth, it will dissolve real slow and if they eat it that’s fine!!<br>  <br>  Did you know that they need to bask under a reptile light UVA/UVB for up to 8 hrs a day for the vitamin D that they need to grow. <br>  So they need a turtle basking dock. <br>  Gravel larger than they can swallow, allot larger.<br>  Their water needs to be clean otherwise they get sick easily from dirty water cause they poop allot. <br>  You need a GREAT filter system depending on the tank in a 60 gallon my girls were in one, I used two double sided marine or penguin filters…It really helped keep it cleaner! <br>  <br>  They will bite very very hard. Under 4" they carry a disease called 'salmonella'. So you must wash after every handling ANY size turtle.. ***And my pictures don't lie. All ages and all sizes get along as long as their is allot for swim room and plenty to eat! They can become cannibalistic if you have 2 or more turtles and a small environment. They will kill off the smallest and then fight for the tank for themselves.<br>  <br>  Size for basic aquatic turtle is approx Body length: 5-8" is average for males, up to 12 inches max for females, but average is about 9 to 10“ in captivity. Life span: 15-25+ years plus. Males have the longer front nails and are used in mating. And are considered mature at about 5 yrs old. You can’t start sexing till about 3” across. Real mating happens in May through June and hatchlings within 90 days. Eggs are laid in soil. If laid in water they will die. Do not cut the males nails!!<br>  They sleep at the bottom of rivers, streams. lakes or ponds or your tank to avoid predators like coyotes, foxes, owls, hawks, possums, raccoons and even some wide mouth bass and us humans.<br>  <br>  ***Some sicknesses they get easily Like shell its actual holes rotting through the shell. <br>  Respiratory sickness, lopsided swimming, coughing, vomiting, blowing bubbles from their nose. .Swollen eyes due to lack of vitamin A fruits and veggies.<br>  Fungus white cotton patches on their skin.<br>  <br>  Contact rescues sites…and vets ..in your city ,state, or country<br>  Red-Eared Slider: <a href="http://www.anapsid.org/reslider.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.anapsid.org/reslider.html</a><br>  <br>  I wish you luck.|`|36a3ynpJaa	You can buy special turtle food for them in any pet store.  They really like worms, but some turtles get by on lettuce.  <br>  <br>  Make sure you have a heat lamp or they will not be able to digest their food.  <br>  <br>  My brother has had four small turtles for over five years.  They are very frisky little guys and he has a tank with water and rock for them to bask on.  He feeds them turtle food and it is tiny.  They will also eat bugs if you can catch them.|`|2YIxnXXyaa	Depending on their size.<br>  If it's really small, they strictly eat live foods.<br>  Small foods that they can chase down.<br>  Otherwise if they're about 3 inches and older, they can eat vegetation, live/dead foods and aquatic turtle pellets.<br>  <br>  Small live animals that are good for them are<br>  Feeder gold fish, earth worms, guppies, minnows, tadpoles, small frogs, crawyfish/crayfish, ghost shrimp, dragonflies, butterflies, crickets, grasshoppers, gekos, salamanders (NOT firebelly ones, they're poisonous), etc.<br>  Just basically anything that's not poisonous and moves.<br>  I personally don't suggest feeding them a praying mantis.  They make a huge cow sick, I don't know what it could do to your turtle.<br>  <br>  <br>  They also need ten gallons of water fore very inch of turte shell.  If you're getting a red eared slider, they get up to about 12 inches so that'd be a 150 gallon tank.<br>  They need a water heater set to 70-80 degrees.<br>  A basking area that's about ten degrees warmer than the water, so about 88-90 degrees.<br>  A layer or two of river rock (anything smaller your turtle could swallow one and it could end in your turtle dying or suffering)<br>  A UVB light and a basking area -Without these two things, your turtle could get a serious illness or die.<br>  Oh and it will need a REALLY good filter.  Aquatic turtles are very easily suseptible for getting Salmonella because they feces in the water, eat animals and some crumbs fall out of their mouths, so the water gets dirty.  It's very important you get a really well working filter.<br>  And wash your hands thoroughly after holding them.<br>  <br>  It'll all cost you about 400 dollars to get all the equipment.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck.

b3b3292f0a82969ceed4f00b38611bccaa	Kitten, senior, adult… it matters not, it’s just a marketing label that allows manufacturers to charge more for that particular food. <br>  <br>  For example… you pick up a can of Wellness kitten (chicken) and a can of Wellness Chicken) adult. Compare the percentages. The kitten food has 1% more protein and 1% more fat, which is what all kitten food manufacturers tout that growing kittens need more of. Well then where is it, because 1% is certainly not worth noting any comparable difference? And it’s like that across the board. Dry cat food has even LESS of a difference. <br>  <br>  The main objective when feeding kittens is to feed more of a high quality food, more times per day because they burn it so fast even when they are doing nothing because they are growing. Kittens pretty much need to eat as much as they want… whenever they want it. <br>  <br>  Kittens don’t need “kitten” food. Mother Nature did not make “kitten” mice and “adult” mice and “senior” mice. It’s the same mouse. The only difference is how much each cat needs to eat daily to thrive. <br>  <br>  <br>  Cats were never meant to eat dry food, also known as cereals or kibble. We, humans, make them eat it for convenience to us. It has nothing to do with them or their nutritional needs. It's completely species inappropriate. <br>  <br>  All small domestic cats descended from desert cats. In the wild, desert cats derive their entire liquid intake from their prey. They do not have a thirst mechanism because they don't need it when eating a species appropriate diet. They get all they need from what they eat. Additionally water was usually not available to them in their desert climate. So they do not often drink water. Regular ol' house cats have descended from those same wild desert cats. <br>  <br>  So in a home environment, your kitty does not get the moisture it needs from dry food and it’s almost always in a constant state of dehydration. Water fountains are encouraged to TRY to get your cat to drink more and your kitty may even enjoy it, but it will never meet its water intake needs drinking from a bowl. <br>  <br>  Deadly feline illnesses such as diabetes, kidney failure, obesity, allergies, Irritable Bowel Disease (IBD), constipation, bladder stones, kidney stones, urinary tract blockages and Urinary Tract Infections (FLUTD), with and without deadly crystals run rampant these days. Cats are not taking in enough water to stave them off. Proper water intake through a species appropriate diet alone can prevent most of these conditions. <br>  <br>  Overall,  wet is all around better for any cats diet, be it canned or Raw and they should never be fed dry cereal kibble if we wish to most closely match their wild nutritional and dietary needs. Kibble meets our needs… not our cats.<br>  <br>  I recommend varying the diet with a constant rotation of 2 to 4 different brands of canned foods that your cat enjoys. If you do this, and allow your cat the same assortment they would have in nature when eating mice, bugs, birds and rabbits, your cat’s digestive system won't be so sensitive and you won't have to run around looking for a specific brand when your store is out. You will have a nice variety to choose from instead. <br>  <br>  Canned foods I recommend you consider for your rotation: <br>  <br>  <br>  Nature's Variety - <a href="http://www.naturesvariety.com/content.lasso?r=0829192&page=1172&-session=naturesvariety:D04EC9250c614143FDKiM2BA9520" rel="nofollow">http://www.naturesvariety.com/content.la...</a> <br>  Wellness Grain Free Formula’s - <a href="http://www.wellnesspetfood.com/cat_wellness_can_index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.wellnesspetfood.com/cat_welln...</a><br>  By Nature Organics - <a href="http://www.bynaturepetfoods.com/productpages/catmain.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.bynaturepetfoods.com/productp...</a> <br>  Organix -  <a href="http://www.castorpolluxpet.com/store/organix/organix_organic_canned_formulas_for_cats" rel="nofollow">http://www.castorpolluxpet.com/store/org...</a> <br>  Evanger's Holistic Pheasant - <a href="http://www.evangersdogfood.com/cat/20089.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.evangersdogfood.com/cat/20089...</a> <br>  Evanger's Organic Braised Chicken - <a href="http://www.evangersdogfood.com/cat/50103.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.evangersdogfood.com/cat/50103...</a> <br>  Evanger's Turkey & Butternut Squash - <a href="http://www.evangersdogfood.com/cat/50111.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.evangersdogfood.com/cat/50111...</a> <br>  <br>  <br>  |`|VMY7No0eaa	they should be 5 - 6 weeks before eating solid food...<br>  <br>  PLEASE HAVE YOUR MOMMA KITTY SPAYED AS SOON AS THE KITTENS ARE WEANED!<br>  good luck|`|gD7o77Sdaa	 Months 1-6<br>  <br>      During these first six months I recommend that your mommy feed you 2 to 3 times a day. Given your age of 8 weeks you should be completely weaned and comfortable eating dry or wet food. I am partial to dry for the general dental benefits and recommend using warm water to help make your dry food softer (at first).<br>  <br>      Your mommy should be aware that as a kitten you are likely to eat your meals in little bits. She should not be too concerned if you just approach your food, sniff it quickly and then eats just a bit. More than likely she will see you return at various intervals to eat more. Being a little kitten noise, commotion and your new surroundings are likely to cause you to stop eating so if possible have her keep it quiet during your meals! <br>  <br>  # Months 6-12<br>  <br>      Once you reach 6 months of age, you should be fed twice a day if you are on a canned, soft-moist, or moistened dry food diet. I believe that dry food is better because it can be left out for you without danger of it spoiling. It is generally worthwhile to use the amounts recommended on the packages of the food you have. However, be sure to use it as a guide and have your mommy adjust it as necessary. So in answer to your question, if your mommy sees you getting fat, have her cut back a little bit. However, be aware that if you are well exercised you might need more food. |`|oChOlCqYaa	Kittens should get formula until 6 weeks as stated previously, then they should get dry kitten food. You can transition by putting formula on the food. They can be switched to adult dry food at 1 year old. I recommend feeding moist food only as an occasional thing, since it doesn't have as much nutritional value as dry food and isn't as good for their teeth. |`|1mhqYyiWaa	if the kitten does not have their mother than kitten replacement formula is the best thing to feed it..<br>  <br>  You can start weening kittens to cat food around 6 wks or so but shouls still get formula for the nutrition up to 8 wks|`|WJhGfrDhaa	As long as she has teeth can food is ok try the paste kind with less chewing or you can soak dry food in water until poofs up and becomes soft they will eat that too.|`|YDUZdUMHaa	My cat was throwing up adult cat food when he was 6 weeks old...we found a wet food formula for kittens [tuna, chicken, the usuals too]and fed that to him until around 6 months. You could probably feed the cat adult wet food way before then, but my family was making sure. He liked the kitten food a lot, also.<br>  Month-old kittens can drink water, but since it's so young you might want to run to somewhere like petsmart and pick up kitten milk formula to put in a bottle. If you think it can drink on it's own, there is cat milk for regular cats [I think whiskas] and you simply pour a little in a saucer [I spread some out on a glass plate thats slightly caved in and my cat licks all over the plate]<br>  Good luck!

TSc8OE4vaa	$15,000+.  Her temperament is not really a huge problem, the kind of person who would be interested in her is probably very experienced.  She's very pretty and I love her jump.  I realllly like her and this is a horse that I would consider buying, if I were in the market.<br>  <br>  Have you considered getting her spayed?  There are many non-invasive ways to do this in mares, the most common being "marbling" in which a marble is inserted into the mare's uterus to mimic pregnancy.  This usually calms them down as they are less hormonal.  <br>  <br>  She might have a cyst on her ovary or her uterus.  That would cause much more hormonal/"mareish" behavior than normal.<br>  <br>  She might also have a hormonal imbalance causing her to be this way.<br>  <br>  Basically, I think your horse might have some medical issue which causes her to be like this.  This is not normal mare behavior and I think you should get the vet to rule out ovarian cysts, hormonal imbalances, et cetera before selling.  Try marbling her too, it's hard to find a vet that knows how to do it but it's not that difficult for a vet to do, they just need to put a sterile marble in the uterus on the right day of her heat cycle.<br>  <br>  EDIT-  This is a super nice mare.  If you don't at least try to spay her (even try marbling... marbling isn't permanent so she could be bred if you so decided).  This problem sounds, for sure to me, like a hormonal issue.  The fact that regumate helped (even just a little) makes me even more sure that it is a hormonal problem.  Seriously, get this mare marbled and there will be a world of difference.<br>  <br>  Maybe if you sell her, someone would want to breed her to a very even tempered stud and use her as a broodmare?  She is super nice, selling her would be a loss to you.|`|bqbrKFeUaa	Because of the horse buying market right now you probably don't have that great of a chance because so many people cannot afford to keep horses anymore. I got my gelding Arabian for only 1,000 it was a family friend though giving it to us very cheap, and he's amazing. I would try at like 3,000 than see what happens. Also I don't know why all these people are saying outrageous numbers such as double digit thousands, that would never sell, because she's not a complete pro.|`|XL62syrCaa	It depends. It would like to see a better picture of her (especially free jumping) to really get an idea of her jumping form. From the picture I am not too impressed. She doesn't tuck her feet and just looks lazy in her jumping. I would also like to see pictures from 4 sides (front, back, left and right) to get a good idea of her conformation. <br>  <br>  Also with her "nutty" issues I would consider either having her spayed or making sure she is sold to a experienced handler/trainer. Make sure you let the buyer know her problems.<br>  <br>  In todays market I would look at in between $5,000 and $10,000 (from what i have seen in the picture). If I had better pictures and signs that shes not a lazy jumper probably inbetween $10,000 and $15,000. If the market turns (which it looks like its still going down hill) you could get $20,000 out of her.|`|bI7wMCJXaa	Depending in your area you might be able to get around $20,000 for her if she wasn't a nutcase. Being nutty won't bother someone looking for a hot horse that can jump 5' but for the majority of your buyers it might but you can still reasonably expect five figures for her in New England.<br>  <br>  The has a great jump, great expression and she's 17HH. She has everything an advanced Hunter would want.|`|cSqx1DxKaa	First of all, I think you need a better photo.  Like Dallas said, she's in midair and it's kind of hard to tell what's going on.  She's in an awkard moment which really isn't helping much.<br>  <br>  I don't mean to be rude but she sounds like a bit of a headcase.  I am trying to think of the type of person who she would appeal to, and really all I can think of is an upper-upper level person who is so confident and knowledgeable in what they're doing that they won't be phased or bothered by her personality and tendencies.  Perhaps she could be a project horse for someone like that, since she is not yet an upper level horse herself.  <br>  <br>  What kind of "American Warmblood" is she?  I thought that was a catchall term for a certain type of horse and could encompass many different breeds, but I could definetely be wrong.<br>  <br>  I wonder if it would be worth it to spay her and see if her temperment improves before trying to sell her.|`|iz03uvV4aa	This is a tough one. <br>  <br>  For starters she sounds like a nice mare - well rounded on the flat, adjustable gaits (I love that expression) and she seems to have an ok jump.  That photo though doesnt tell me much at all.  She is sort of mid air ish and doesnt show me her scope or any real ability.  Her knees seem relatively even enough that I assume she packs a large jump BUT her temperment sets me back.  I personally am a 3'6-3'9 rider and based on her temperment and "unhandle-able-ness" I would be hesitant to buy a horse like her.  1. If Iam going to spend 18,000+ on a horse who has upper level potential who is only going consistently 3'6, Iam shopping for something consistent.  Consistent on the ground AND under saddle.  Her "dangerous" marish moods make me wonder if it really has anything to do with being a mare at all. Seems to me it might be something a little more underlying.  BUT I dont know this horse, I havent seen her tempers, I dont know what sort unpradictability she has but I do know that having started, trained and ridden many young advanced level horses, I work from the ground up first.  My horse needs to come off a trailer and I expect obedience on the ground at ALL times. Mare or Gelding there is no excuse for poor and especially "dangerous" behavior.  <br>  <br>  Anyways - with all that said she sounds like a nice mare. But no VERY experienced rider who wants a 4'6-4'9 horse under saddle wants an ill mannered and non manageable horse. SO I think this might put a slight damper on her price. Not to mention there isnt much of a market unless youre marketting her on a large competitive circuit.  <br>  SO - I really wouldnt look at spending anymore than 18,000 for this horse.  I would list her for 20,000 with upper level potential for an experienced rider ONLY and make that a negotiable price.  But my best advice would be to solve this ground manners issue first, this will help immensely in selling.  A well mannered and respectful horse on the ground tells alot about how it rides.<br>  <br>  Good Luck :)<br>  <br>  EDIT**<br>  <br>  I hate to say it but Iam just being honest, instead of solving the problem on a perfectly good horse you will pass her "issues" and "dangerous tendancies" on to someone else. Eeek. Atleast your intention is to be honest about her but still...I think if she is perfectly suitable with a little maintenance and time to figure out the root of her "issues", you're silly to sell her. Just my opinion though!!!<br>  <br>  I wish you luck! :)|`|yt4AYZHFaa	it all depends on where you are, here in Utah horses that were selling for 13,000 a year ago are now going for 2,500 and they are still not selling, i good friend of mine recently had someone drop 4 horses off to him cause they couldn't afford to feed them|`|277f88461e1df8f316c52c480977aaa6aa	neh, she doesn't tuck her feet up well.  i don't know what she's worth, but i personally wouldn't consider buying her as a jumper.  especially if she nuts.|`|gDAqEfMoaa	depending on area i know that around where i live( colorado) maybe 4,000 maybe and because of the horse market being so bad idk the best thing is to list her make offer.|`|j2yLjm6Naa	UM..... if she is swssooo good why would you want to sell her|`|dykkFuCqaa	Ooh she's plain out LOVELY!|`|3LXbUg1raa	Considering her temperament and "dangerous tendencies", the fact that she's suited for more advanced riders only, and that she's a hard keeper that tends to injure herself often...not to mention the state that the horse market/industry is in right now...I'm hoping that when you say you want to sell her for around 15 if possible, that you are talking about $1500 and not $15,000...With her temperament and everything else you described, $1500 is a lot more reasonable for her...personally, even for that price, I myself would have to really think long and hard about purchasing her...the amount she's going to cost someone in vet bills everytime she injures herself, the cost of the hospital bills because her "dangerous tendencies" sent someone to the hospital, and the high cost to feed her because she is a hard keeper...it just doesn't make her worth all that much...realistically, you're going to end up sticking a lot more into this mare than you'll ever get out of her and for most people it just isn't worth it...|`|mKWwz1uUaa	After reading all this I keep asking myself, does she get turn out in a large pasture daily, for how long with other horses?

Has she been jumping sense she's been 5?  What age did she start?  What was her experience in life before this and you?

zMXDolD9aa	The first answer is incorrect, you don't have to pay yearly or monthly for rent/lease generally, unless profusely stated by the horses owner. I lease a horse and i don't do this.<br>  Renting a horse is more short term. For example, renting a horse could be simply for the day. If you want a short ride out on the trails or something (unaccompanied by a leader or not), this would be considered more renting.<br>  Leasing is different. It tends to be more long term (or is intended to be), e.g. months/years. You can either full or part lease a horse, depending on your preferences and the owners' along with the horses availability etc. When you lease a horse, the money paid is more towards the upkeep e.g. shoeing, feed, board. In more formal leases, a contract is signed stating who has the horses what/how many days, terms of return to the owner, what can be done with horses in specifics. This is not always a requirement, as i have never been contracted to a lease.<br>  Hope this helped.|`|28834ea3162329035a24ce080e7020edaa	They are the same thing.,|`|AA11570905	When you rent a horse it is usually on a very short term basis (by the hour or day).  When you lease a horse then you have a contract with the owner in regards to your rights of use and your responsibilites. Often it means that you provide certain care for the horse in exchange for the right to ride or show the horse.|`|ptVGgQUQaa	A rental agreement usual refers to a short term arrangement, that will automatically renew at the end of the term, unless a party to agreement notifies the other it will not.  A lease is typically for a longer term, and will not automatically be renewed at the end of the term.  Contrary to earlier answers, all lease and rental agreements should be fully detailed in writing to reflect the bargain of the parties involved.  Details concerning liability, releases/waivers, who is to provide care, emergency details, authorization for medical treatment, feeding, care, and training/riding requirements and others should all be set out.  As an equine attorney, I have seen too many horse persons enter such agreements on a handshake with little else, and after the horse colics, or someone is hurt, or the horse is not cared for, a costly and timely court case results.|`|AA10188682	when you rent a horse you are just simple using someone elses horse... where as leasing one, you are letting some one ride your horse

2fdee6b1fd597a29209ecfad9dc8b598aa	I bought my first two ferrets in my second year of college.  They are great, intelligent and loyal animals.  They are expensive, require a lot of interaction, and are rather high maintenance (if you want healthy and happy ferts).<br>  The best thing to do would be to read up on their care (and everything you'd have to do daily), and then see if you still want ferrets.|`|AA10438532	well they take alot of care. they need lots of exercise, are rather destuctive, and they stink. can't think of anything good.|`|aeee4f0cd8f8b54cba0e6fac9a771ebdaa	My boyfriend and I have 2 ferrets and I would honeslt advise against it.They're adorable when they are younger, but unless you bathe them every single day with special shampoos their hair becomes course and they obtain a terrible smell. Sticking them in the cage is mean, so you sort of have to let them run free, but if you do that, its easy to litter pain train them, however you still have to keep everything super clean cause they will knock down ANYTHING that can be knocked down.|`|4eUext7Xaa	If you are going to college, shouldn't you be concentrating on your work ad not on a litle ferret? I wuldn't get one. It would distract me and take more time and money which I wouldn't have in college. LOL|`|Jx0dobejaa	I would probably advise against it....I'm not saying that it might not work for you, but I think it would be a distraction and it is best to keep them in groups of 2 or more....They are very destructive when they get bored....The good thing about them is they are only up for around 4-5 hours a day, and they can be caged durring the time they are , asleep (it's not cruel), alot of times they will get into places that can be hard to get them out and if something were to happen, oh lets say like a fire and you needed to get to them fast if they were in a cage you could easily get them, but if they were loose in the house and behind your entertainment center and you couldn't get to them.....it could end very badly....I have four of them and we have one that is up for around 6 or so hours a day....he just likes to tear EVERYTHING up! but he is soooo sweet.  I personally don't think ferrets stink, I actually like the smell of their fur....they have their own sent just like people do....most of mine smell like fritos....but their litter boxes stink, just like any animal...and most people don't really care for ferrets, alot of people call them snakes with fur (rolling my eyes)......And this is for katie too.....ferrets should only be washed ONCE A MONTH!  That is why your ferrets stink so bad, the more that you wash them the more oils they produce, every time you wash them you take away vital oils that their skin needs, so their glands go into hyper mode prodicing oils like crazy, their skin is already dry enough with out you washing it all away....you should be using a ferret shampoo or baby shampoo only, and if they still "stink" use some smell good spray.....I hope this helped and if you still decide to purchase a ferret here is a great ferret rescue group located in Auburn wa,  <a href="http://www.washingtonferret.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.washingtonferret.com/</a><br>  The average adoption fee is around 90.00.....she has over 117 fuzzies for adoption....I believe the ferrets are microchipped, spayed/neutered and have all their shots....which is much better than 130 at a pet store with none of that (except being fixed).|`|jyGTlpzTaa	Pros:<br>  <br>  Ferrets can be caged, which might be good for shared accomodation, if you have to move into it in future.<br>  They tend to be less expense than dogs and cats.<br>  <br>  <br>  Cons: <br>  <br>  They are still very expensive to keep.<br>  Your situation is bound to change what with you still being in college, and you might end up having to give your ferret up because of it.<br>  A lot of people really hate ferrets, so if you are in the situation where you have to share or move to a pet unfriendly place you might have problems.<br>  Ferrets can live a long time, who knows what you will be doing 5 years down the road...however this applies to anyone really.<br>  Your ferret will need four and a half hours attention EVERY SINGLE DAY, college life is hectic and this could be a problem.<br>  <br>  Please consider getting two ferrets, the expense is not much more and take it from me they do much better in pairs, and watching two play is much more fun than watching one play.|`|lFTAn56Baa	I am in college, and I bought a ferret last summer.<br>  Ferret are wonderful pet.. <br>  When I wake up for school, I take her out of her cage for all the time I am here, then, i put her back in her cage and she sleeps all day (ferret can sleep up to 20 hours a day!)  Then when I am back from school, usually around 4:15 pm, I take her out of her cage until I go to bed.<br>  So actually there is no big deal if you are going to school, but its my opinion.<br>  <br>  I dont see any cons... except maybe that when you travel you have to bring the cage... <br>  <br>  The pros of having a ferret : You always have "someone" with you...<br>  Ferrets are loveable, and smart pets (mine roll over, jump over my arm... she's a cutie)..She is litter trained.. You can take a walk outside with your ferret too (except when its too cold)...<br>  <br>  I hope you'll be getting a ferret, because you'll see how good pets they are and you wont regret it :):)
0mb78CiWaa	I would take her to the vet.|`|UNFxjNHkaa	you need to take her to a vet, like right now.|`|14e4610723b5f7453ddc2705c59f75feaa	She could have (most likely does if from a barn) parasites... roundworms, tapeworm.... if it's serious that could be causing it.  Or an injury, of course.  Either way, it is definitely abnormal, so you should take her to your vet.  Call them today, and tell them what's going on, and they could maybe fit you in today, but if not, try to talk to a nurse or the doctor to know what to do while you're waiting for your appointment date.  It's their job to deal with this stuff, and they will be able to tell you if it's an emergency.  Good luck, and my heart goes out to you and your baby!!!|`|Adq6y8tXaa	i've got two cats from a farm too and they've had sooo many problems it's crazy i'd say either take it to the vet or take it back to the farm..|`|QC6oBb2iaa	Chances are, a very bad case of worms.  She needs to go to the vet.
C5YBD3F1aa	Don't start them on soft puppy food until they are at the least 4 weeks old. Try making it to 5-6 weeks if possible, but if mum stops feeding them now, you will have to feed them.<br>  <br>  Feed them three times a day, and make a schedule. Feed them at the same exact times every single day, don't move around the times a lot. Make a schedule and stick to it! How much to feed them? It should say on the back of the can.<br>  <br>  Make sure to start them out on high quality, canned, soft, puppy-formulated food. Don't get Pedigree, IAMS, Ol' Roy, etc. Go for the highest quality you can afford! And keep in mind, high price doesn't mean high quality. Look for puppy foods that contain extra brain development ingredients. Avoid any by-products, look for REAL meat in the ingredients list! And most litters of puppies LOVE rice & lamb flavored foods.<br>  <br>  Whenever the puppies are 7-8 weeks old, start mixing high quality, puppy formulated, dry food in with their soft food. Increase the amount of dry food in it each day. Eventually, they will be eating nothing but dry food. Then, at 12 weeks old, they should be ready to go to their new homes!<br>  <br>  Please spay your female (and any other dogs you may own) after this. The world is overpopulated with dogs, especially common small dogs like Pugs. Do the world a favor and leave the breeding to the professionals.|`|bIaywrBCaa	If they just got their teeth it is too early to think about weaning them. At first just give some softened dry puppy food once a day. Next week, twice a day, after that about 3 times a day. Mom should be weaning them by then.|`|ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	I start my pups on puppy mush at 3 weeks of age, four times a day.<br>  <br>  Why are you breeding when you don't know what you are doing?  Why didn't you research this stuff long ago?  What else don't you know that's important?|`|bPdqwkpPaa	Where's your mentor?  Why didn't she teach you this over the last 3-5 years of training with them?<br>  <br>  Any remotely responsible breeder knows that you & mom wean the puppies at 4-6 weeks.  Then, you feed them as needed.  Usually 3-5 times a day. <br>  <br>  Please tell me this was a pregnant rescue dog.  Please.

Rw7gi86Naa	When you get mad and yell at your cat, it will accomplish nothing except your cat will be angry and scared of you. You should never “spank” or use your hands in any way to cause pain to your cat. This will only make her fear and resent you. Our cats should associate our hands with pleasant things like petting, feeding and love, not violence. <br>  <br>  In my experience, spray bottles never really work, especially with kittens. They often see the water bottle as a form of play. And you should never use hot sauce as a deterrant. There are products you can buy in the pet store for that. You can try those, or just buy a trash can with a lid like mentioned before. She will eventually learn, and probably grow out of it.<br>  <br>  Please don't ever hit your cat for any reason.|`|1hciyvKdaa	Get a trash can with a snap on lid! Or phone book setting on top of the trash can. If its the hanging paper on the roll, hmmmmmmmm Get one of those wall mount dispensers, the silver ones that really just sheild the paper from site, not that have slits to feed the paper through and turn it upside down would work|`|dQCZDAqgaa	get a trash can with a top.|`|VDP3pNCPaa	Well, a spray bottle is used for training, but hot sauce and spankings are punishment, and you want training since she doesn't know better.<br>  <br>  But probably the only approach is to have a covered container with a lid that seals.  She may outgrow it, but perhaps not.<br>  <br>  In my bathroom, the toilet paper is in a container, or it would be shredded.|`|UNFxjNHkaa	why would you spank your cat?  She has no idea why you're doing that to her.  If you keep that up, she'll eventually become afraid of your hands.  And what do you mean that you've tried hot sauce?  Please god tell me you didnt give your cat hot sauce!  That would be so cruel.<br>  <br>  The thing to remember here is that she doesn't realize that she's doing anything wrong and you're punishing her. <br>  <br>  Does your garbage have a lid on it?  If not, get one!<br>  <br>  And in regards to the spray bottle thing:  Are you spraying her when you catch her in the act?  Or are you doing it hours later?  If you're doing it hours later then thats why it isnt working - she has no idea why she's being sprayed|`|RWgjnwl9aa	All cats love to shred things if you know enough about their nature as predators but this is a simple remedy get a trash bin with a cover & never hit or use hot sauce or another corporal punishment on a cat  you are luck he didn't shred you up|`|Adq6y8tXaa	keep the bathroom door shut?|`|X6PDtlq4aa	My cat does this when I'm away- he shreds the toilet paper roll into pulp! Cats love to rip stuff up, they love making use of those claws naturally so she's not going to stop doing that. However you can give her an alternate outlet like a scratching post or new toys to divert her attention from the bathroom garbage. Also, get some essential oil spray or air freshener-- scents like lavender, eucalyptus or cinnamon are harsh to a cat's nose. If you spray some in the garbage often enough, she will hate the smell of the garbage and will most likely leave it alone!|`|fQRunQphaa	easy solution - i have seen lots of small garbage cans with lids.  the ones you step on to open up.  or other kinds with lids.  just don't have an open trash container in there - they love playing with tissue, its in their DNA.  <br>  <br>  please don't use hot sauce or spanking - those methods are too harsh.  nothing your cat does should get that respsonse from you.  your cat might fear you and/or suffer from it.  <br>  <br>  you could also flush the tissue assuming it is safe to flush down the toilet.  but seems to me the right trash container is the best bet.  or walk to another trash container like the kitchen and dispose of tissues there.<br>  <br>  good luck to you.|`|kNYDHZqAaa	I think the easiest answer is to get a garbage can with a good lid on it. My sister's puppy had this problem, and that solved it. Don't use hot sauce or spanking, and don't get rid of your cat! All cats have their "things," minor annoyances you have to figure out a solution to.<br>  <br>  Paul RN - don't flush tissues! They will decompose in landfills, and flushing them does more environmental harm than good. Flushing your toilet when it's not necessary wastes a lot of water.|`|ZTNDqBJ5aa	Easy!  Get a garbage can that's covered!  Target has cute, small stainless steel ones that are always covered (like the kind in resturants, lobby's ect) You just 'push' open the door and it will swing open-but then close!!|`|xMnN99T8aa	Put the used tissues down the toilet. that way they actually get returned to the elements by sewage treatment instead of laying in a landfill for 500 years. And, there won't be any for the cat.|`|G3hTM9qeaa	Why would you spank a cat? A cat can not connect the punishments that you are giving it to it tearing up tissues. Get a trash can with a lid instead of beating your cat.|`|4eUext7Xaa	Shut the bathroom door. That's what I did. I had to always have it shut. Now he doesn't even go in there. But I guess that isn't an option if his food or litter box is in there.|`|MV7zHs7yaa	haha.. thats sweet.. do you put your cat in time out?  seriously though get a trashcan that has a lid
7sPa32GSaa	IF he seems alert and healthy, I wouldn't worry about it.  Just make sure to keep an eye on him, give him access to plenty of water, and he should be fine.  I wouldn't worry unless he seems sickly.  Two days isn't too long to go without food, I would just worry about him being a little dehydrated.  Again, if he seems alert and not lethargic, he's probably fine.|`|rsTLGYaZaa	TO tell you the truth i believe it is perfectly fine.  I am absolutely sure that a hamster and any kind of rodent can last 3 or 4 days without food or water.  Don't worry it is not a big deal|`|Xq6EWoLdaa	Yeah! should be fine!<br>  Just get some hamster food! and give them some carrots, more cucumber, bananas or some monkey nuts! just to be on the safe side!|`|xRpZ9nmfaa	well if he doesnt seem weaker than usual he'll be fine if he does just keep givnig him food or water and if he hasnt improved in a couple days take him to the vet|`|tOFmJXCuaa	Your hamster will be fine. Give it time to rest and recover. Hamsters can go up to a week without food and water. Just do not do this too often though.|`|zMXDolD9aa	I'd say it's OK. Aslong as it didn't seem too distressed or anything and if it had something to eat before, it should be fine. You could probably do with some proper hamster feed though. Just make sure you don't forget in future!|`|aKEK24o4aa	he should be fine, just pay close attention, make sure he eats, drinks and plays, he'll be back to normal in no time.   If he seems down or not active, then maybe go see the vet but if he's eating, then no worries

7sPa32GSaa	Just love her like a cat and take care of her like the vet told you.  My friend has a cat with FIP that is a couple of years old and is doing fine and healthy.  She just makes sure she takes care of him and gives him lots of love.|`|zpwJR60baa	Hi, Sorry to hear about your kitten.  There really are no easy answer.  Did the vet done the extensive test to make sure it is FIP?  Have the kitten start acting up?  The best is to pray, and be there when you have to put him to sleep.<br>  <br>  Note:  If you do decide to get another FIP, clean your house thoroughly, and wait at least 30 days..<br>  <br>  Here is a link to FIP...|`|VDP3pNCPaa	There are two types.  The wet type and the dry type.  Wet FIP is particularly devastating.  Sadly, there really is no way forward;  simply try and work with your vet to lessen the problems.<br>  <br>  When the quality of his life no longer seems there, then we are called upon to do the most difficult thing ever, and that is to give him release.|`|X6PDtlq4aa	I'm so sorry to hear about your kitten. It's so sad a thing. Whatever you do, do not let your cat outside. I'm sorry it may seem insensitive but his disease is a serious epidemic among all cats. Keep him away from all other healthy cats as the disease is airborne. Pamper the hell out of your kitty, you may want to give him Bach's Rescue Remedy- a few drops in his water dish every once in awhile will calm him. It's a natural stress reliever and is harmless on animals. Take pictures and enjoy your time with him.|`|kNYDHZqAaa	I'm sorry to hear that :( Did your vet give you any advice? I think the best you can do is make her feel loved!

AA10049109	Your snake is in serious danger of becoming a chronic regurger.  Any time a snake regurgitates, you should wait at least 10 days before offering food again.  The food item that is offered should be much, much smaller than the one they regurged.  After it's eaten, no handling, no stress at all. Do not handle her except to put her back in her viv.  Wait at least 7 days before again feeding a much smaller item than normal.  I also use grapefruit seed extract in the water to help them gain back their stomach acids and it's also a natural antibiotic.  2-3 drops per 8 oz. of water.  With frozen/thawed food items, I make cuts down the back of the mouse before feeding. This allows easier digestion of the food.  You can also try nutribac powder on the mouse once you do start feeding.  Powder the back half of the animal and feed as usual. You can get nutribac on Kathy Love's website, www.cornutopia.com  Make sure you do not use the grapefruit seed extract when feeding the nutribac as the gfse will kill the probiotics in the nutribac.  I would get this animal checked by a vet and perhaps have a fecal done to rule out parasites.  You might also want to get some bloodwork done to check out any infections.  Multiple regurge is a very serious problem that can lead to death. You need to get this under control right away. Double check your temperatures to make sure they aren't too high.  2 days is pretty quick and can be too high a heat.  4 days is too low.  You should have thermostat on your heatsource with the probe from it at substrate level under the warm side hide. You should have multiple hides for the animal to go in and fresh clean water.  If you have other reptiles, I would make sure this one is quarantined away from them for safety in case this is from a disease that is spreadable.|`|3IUMh4Igaa	Has the temp changed in the room she is in, if it has it may have effected her. Also, you may want to try smaller food items for a while. and make sure there is nothing in the area to stress her out. <br>  <br>  The thing is, if after 4 days it is only half digested, it is most likely too big or your heat, not a stress problem.|`|EDOxXdcoaa	When snakes regurgitate their food, it's no different than us vomiting. The esophagus is irritated so subsequent meals may add to the problem. How long are you waiting after a regurge to offer food again? If it were me, I'd give her at least a week to recuperate before trying again. When you do offer food again, offer something smaller than usual. If you had been feeding hoppers, for instance, offer a fuzzy instead. If yours is a baby, she's probably taking pinks or fuzzies? Smaller than a pink would be pieces of a pink. If you're using frozen/thawed pinks, just cut them in half and offer that instead of a whole pink. If she keeps that down then work your way back up to her regular sized meals over the next few feedings. If she can't keep the smaller meals down after a recovery period it may be time to have a vet check her out and do a fecal to rule out parasites as the culprit.

My boy cat is fixed and he still "tries" once and a while.  He just gives up really fast.|`|8Raw4M1naa	Its true, one you fix a cat (male or female) it removes their urge to breed. Keep in mind some cats are just naturally cranky and don't like other cats. They may always fuss at one another, but generally after a little while of adjustment they will be ok. Keep them seperate after your male cat gets fixed for a couple days, since he'll feel a little vunerable and sore (and may not want your other cat bothering him).|`|X6PDtlq4aa	It should stop when he's fixed. Your poor female cat will thank you that's for sure! His urges will stop once the testosterone is eliminated! Gross but true... lol.|`|5kjYFb9Taa	Yes, hes trying to mate. Get him fixed and he WILL stop. :)<br>  And its not that expensive at all for Male cats!!<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|pDPSaL37aa	Not necessarily. My 8 year old male cat still tries mounting my 10 year old female cat and she also screams because he bites her neck so hard. I had them both fixed when they were about 4-6 months of age and still to this day he does it every so often. He doesn't do it half as much as he used to, though. With that said, you should definitely still have your cat neutered because of the health benefits. It will also prevent him from wanting to escape to find a mate and adding to the pet overpopulation. Hopefully your cat will in fact stop this behavior, but like I said, most likely it will just subside a bit. If you're lucky, after a while he will stop completely.|`|kNYDHZqAaa	If the problems are related to him trying to mate with her, then I would imagine the behavior will stop once he is fixed.

280d96ad7b5e9ffad03a34a66cac5db0aa	Your homemade diet is by no means "healthier" than a diet that is formulated to be nutritionally complete. Rats require certain amounts of protein, iron, iodine, folic acid, vitamin B12, vitamin E, so on and so forth. Just like people, they need the proper nutrients to be healthy. (I mean, obviously, your rats are going to be perfectly fine living on fruits and such for a couple days. I only mean that this is far from a healthy long-term diet. It's full of sugars and lacks a huge amount of necessary vitamins and proteins.)<br>  <br>  Out of curiosity, why did you mash the berries? There's nothing wrong with doing so, it just seems messier and harder to store than simply giving them the berries whole. (Well, I mean, not whole for the strawberries, but those just need to be cut a few times.)<br>  <br>  I wouldn't bother putting the Cheerios in. They won't do a single thing but lend them more unhealthy, unnecessary sugar. I mean, you could put a few in, but it'll only be detrimental to their health. (Not highly detrimental, of course, nothing's really going to happen to them from a few unhealthy Cheerios, but there just isn't any point in putting them in if you don't have to.)<br>  <br>  Yeah, do add some rolled oats. I wouldn't put it in the mashed fruit mix, though, nor would I add bread to the mix. They'll be soggy, nasty, disintegrating messes with all the juices and such from the fruits. It'll just be gross. I'd store them separately.<br>  <br>  Sure, you can cook the broccoli. But so you know, a lot of rats actually do like frozen food. It's totally up to you and your rats' preference, though. If I were you, I'd only partially thaw them, so that they won't be too limp or soggy.<br>  <br>  Any regular pasta contains grains. Pasta's made of flour, water and/or eggs (there can be additional ingredients). Flour is a powder made of cereal grains, and the vast majority of flour (including plain white flour) is derived from wheat. Anyway, I really wouldn't heat up the pasta. I've never tried to heat up uncooked pasta, but it sounds like a bad idea. I'm sure they'd prefer the pasta at a regular temperature, anyway. Foods like scrambled egg, baby food, etc. are better-suited to be heated. (Oh, wait, did you mean heat up the entire mixture? No. You shouldn't. The sugars in the fruits can become incredibly hot and bubbly, surprisingly fast. That's how I make pie filling, by dumping a bunch of fruit in a pot and simmering it until it's a gooey mess that would easily give you a serious burn.)|`|6b4d4fb2e519a8ffe2f58e1c9e3c4a2baa	Grains are good, and one of the natural food sources of rats, but almost all domestic rats are from common  ancestors, rats that were captured and domesticated by London's rat catcher in the 1800's, therefore scavenging human food is probably instinctual for them so just about anything is o.k. for a short time rats love grains and   fruit and uncooked pasta gives them some tooth exercise!! PS bird food works too|`|MWavQBQVaa	If you have dogs, dog food and biscuits are good as long as they are not high in fat. Also my rats love sweet potatoes and sunflower seeds. Just make sure your not giving them too much fat because that has been linked to tumors!|`|VOIs9Kxqaa	try and add more seeds and grains in there. peanuts are good too. They'll be fine eating that for a few days or two untill you can get rattie food. You can also make homemade food if you like. I use to do that when I bred hamsters. I had a special mix low in sugar (since campbells dwarfs are prone to type 2 diabetes). I'd buy the ingreidents at the bulk barn, and to feed 20 hamsters for a month cost me about $13. plus that way you know everything is safe and human grade. <br>  <br>  Cheerioes are good as a snack, try not to feed them more then 6-7 peices though.

They're vulnerable and kids do not know how to handle or act around them - that could lead to injury, death, or the dog developing aggression (biting) to keep the kids away.<br>  <br>  I would say 15 lbs is the smallest you should go. Short fur is preferable (less for babies to grab and be enthralled with.) No bigger than 30 lbs as an unexercised large dog could easily become hyper enough to hurt an infant or child.<br>  <br>  With that said you should also wait until your youngest is out of the grabbing stage and is capable of following direction from you - otherwise you'll be running around trying to prevent incidents like the child grabbing tails or ears.

qEp9fxU9aa	All freeze dried shrimp can clog the fish's intestinal track due to them being dry and the shells have hardened.  You need to vary the diet and since these are freeze dried I hope you are hydrating them before feeding your fish.  The Shrimp are great for your Polleni though add about 25% vegetable matter to the diet.  Shelled peas, spirulina, par boiled zuchini are all nice.  Also add some fresh shrimp, krill, plankton, earthworms, beef heart, non-oily salt water fish, etc.  Preditory fish should eat once every 2-3 days at a level where their stomach is noticable enlarged though not rediculously so.  Grazers should eat several times a day in small portions.  In Captivity it doesn't seem to matter as much though make sure you keep up on the water changes or you'll have problems with Polleni.  Do you have the large spot or small spot variety?  Do you have a large aquarium because they easily get over 1'.  I don't recommend anything smaller than a 75 gallon for up to 2 Polleni.  Enjoy.  These are great Madagascar fish and are fascinating to breed.  Their eggs come out just like frog eggs.

AA10029366	I go with the "if it isn't broke..." philosophy on dog food. I have spent many years on and off trying desperately to prove to myself that feeding a higher "esteemed", more expensive food makes a difference in my dogs' coat, weight, condition, and performance.<br>  <br>  I always seem to fail miserably. I have been feeding a 2-star food for years, and doing feeding trials with higher-rated foods for years...and I always come back to the 2-star food.<br>  <br>  Consider this: Nobody I know of who works their dogs in the field (mushing, hunting, herding) feeds a "5-star" food. The top long distance mushers in the world feed foods dogfoodanalysis.com deems 1- or 2-star (Eagle Pack Power, Eukanuba, Blackwood, etc.) When racing, these dogs burn 240 calories per pound (roughly 9600 calories) per day! They are world class athletes. And many of them are running 1000 mile races at 8-9 years old!<br>  <br>  I think that says a lot more about the food than a star rating on a website.|`|AA11026827	If their dog does fine on it, then it's fine.  I give my two cents and recommendations when a dog ISN'T doing fine, and yet the owners don't know why or are being stubborn (that's when I break out the website lol).  <br>  <br>  A big part too is what is being supplemented with the food.  If people are giving their dogs marrow bones, that helps with the diet, and isn't figured into the food.<br>  <br>  Dogfoodanalysis analyzes the amounts of what necessary nutrients are in the food.  It doesn't figure in the extra stuff that an owner may or may not be feeding the dog.  If a dog does fine on it, then it's not a problem, but the owner also has to realize that the additional food and treats they are giving has an effect too.  Not saying that they have to change, just saying it might not be just the food.<br>  <br>  I go with what works.  My dog does well on the high quality food that the breeder fed, and doesn't do well on lower quality food (I've tried him on it before).

There is a huge amount of variety to choose from, and it's unlikely that there isn't a "good" food that they can work with. Foods should contain no artificial sweeteners, preservatives or flavors; no synthetic vitamin K; no corn and not "too many" grains in the first ingredients; no meat or poultry by-products; no added sweeteners; no gluten meals; names all ingredients; has disclosed the manufacturing location; and contains adequate animal protein (preferably as the first ingredient). In almost all cases, the dog will improve on such a high-quality diet. (There might be a few months, tops, of shakiness. Transitions between any foods can upset a dog's stomach.)

I would first consider who is doing the rating before I'd give them any credence.  Or maybe I'd just review a few analyses and see if I agreed with them.  <br>  <br>  Mainly I'd analyze my dog's food myself.  I'd learn from a reputable source what a dog should be eating, then I'd try to find a dog food that matches that.<br>  <br>  My opinion is that we aren't necessarily qualified to say that our pets are doing better on one food or another.  Oh obvious stuff, sure, but we don't know what might be going on internally.<br>  <br>  Consider this - back in the day, women used to take arsenic or maybe it was cyanide because it did wonderful things for their skin.  And yet they were ingesting poison.<br>  <br>  So I think it's perfectly possible for pet food to have a similar effect.  Perhaps the ingredients are complete crap but they've added some oils that produce a healthy coat.  If your dog is in generally good health to start with, how could you accurately judge his health at that point?|`|3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	No.  I think it is very important that people find what works best for THEIR dog.<br>  <br>  BUT...I'm always a big fan of posting that link because not everyone has a chance to know about or try different foods of higher quality.  It doesn't hurt to at least encourage them to *look* at the ingredient lists, etc.|`|WiycCxpzaa	I go with the ingredients and how well my dogs do on the food. I prefer food that doesn't give them gas, for my sake and theirs, so I feed them a higher quality healthier food. But I still pay attention to cost, my dogs eat the Costco brand Kirklands dog food. Good price and better than Purina or Pedigree|`|fOLO4TNhaa	Nope. I have tried Wellness and Candiea and all that High quality foods. My dogs just do not do well on them. But then i tried Nutro Ultra Holistic! and my dogs do fantastic on it! i will never change there dog food do to what a website says. They are my dogs and i do what i want with my dogs. I want what is best for my dogs and what is best is Nutro. Nutro Ultra has done wonders for them! Taz has a weight problem, Nutro Ultra has stopped that. Taco on wellness and candiea lost a LOT of weight. Nutro got him to a great weight. Precious coat wasn't doing to well but since i have switched her coat is beautiful! I don't care what a website or any stranger online says. There my dogs and i will do what is best for them, MY WAY.|`|vrVVQgqwaa	i don't think the rating system is all that great, it all depends on what works for your dog, every one raves about iams and pro health and science diet but my dogs cant eat the foods. what ever works for your dog and they thrive is all that  counts.|`|Z9zzNYNCaa	Not being a "feed-snob",I don't give a ratzazz how feeds are "rated".<br>  I've been doing fine w/the feed I've been using for 40 years.|`|iXijnCxOaa	You do what's best for your dogs... ta heck with the naysayers!<br>  <br>  And yes, some people's dogs do quite well on lower rated foods.|`|2G6b5y8Taa	no whatever your dog is happy with is what you should feed.some people it does matter to its all a matter of opinion|`|AA11457471	I'd stay with the highest rated food that works for your dog.<br>  The most important thing is to avoid corn, wheat, soy, BHA & BHT. You can't do that with the lowest rated foods.<br>  Also, unless you try a better food, you'll never know if/ how much better your dog will do on it.<br>  I cannot afford the best but I invest in the best I can afford.|`|be58a957ec05b08ab61416f8ea457867aa	Ultimately, no. But I would be shocked if a dog (already with no health issues) was healthier and more robust eating something like Alpo than eating a premium-quality food such as Canidae or Wysong. It is true that different dogs digest and metabolize foods differently. Evo may be a good food but my dog didn't like it very much and had loose stools from it. So I just found high-quality foods that worked for her. If she hadn't eaten the 4- or 5-star foods I would have fed her the best of the rest that she would eat and thrive on.|`|XEbe4Votaa	I have yet to find a dog who isn't obviously healthier when switched to a higher quality food from a very low quality food.  (ie. a 1 or 2 rating, etc)  That doesn't mean they don't exist, but I do think it is pretty rare in the general "pet populous".  <br>  This does not mean all dogs should be on EVO, or whatever else is rated as a top food.  I personally have a dog who I have had to switch to a little bit more rice in his diet because his body was simply having a hard time with such rich food.  If I switch that same dog to a low quality food, I promise you - people who know him will notice within weeks.  (I have actually tried it, just out of curiosity.)<br>  <br>  The simple fact is you cannot say a dog would not do better on a higher quality food until you actually try the higher quality food.  It's the only way.  This is one if the reasons I keep my pets on a rotation (particularly the ones on dry food) and pay attention to how they react to various foods.  I constantly find things that work, and things that aren't so great.|`|qioH81tiaa	The only criteria for dog food - how well your dog does on it.  Personally, I have SEEN the improvement in my dog with a change to a better food.  And, since feeding raw can actually be cheaper than a good quality food, in addition to the control I have over the source of that food, I'm switching to raw.<br>  <br>  Anyone who believes quality counts for nothing is blinded by the marketing propaganda, in my opinion.  But I will never castigate anyone for what they choose to feed, as long as their dog is healthy.|`|P8Q39vA4aa	I feed what works for MY dogs and MY dogs only. My family has been feeding whats supposedly low class food for almost 30 years. Starting with my dalmatian whose life was saved by nutros. I stopped feeding nutros because my dogs now don't like it. I moved on the Eukenuba they did excellent, I stopped because my male got tired of it and would not eat. Now for more then 5 years I have been feeding Purina Pro Plan brands, first performance now weight management and puppy. All my litters were fed purina pro plan puppy or eukenuba weaning food at first. Some people say oh it stunts growth, i will tell you this i have a male from my first weim litter that i show, hes right below standard about an inch below. He was fed pro plan originally and is now on kirkland. He is a big boy. All my dogs do excellent on pro plan, great stools, impeccable coats, and they are thriving. <br>  <br>  My only grain sensitive dog is on taste of the wild but does she look and thrive any better then my other ones no, she is allergic to grain and she would chew her feet raw so we got her on a no grain diet. <br>  <br>  Dogfoodanalyis is full of it. I hate that site and no one should cite it. Its run by a guy who is not a nutritionist at all.<br>  <br>  I believe in feed what works for your dog. If its the supposed higher rated so be it, but if its the supposed lower rated also so be it. YOu should not have to change just because some poorly run site says so.|`|kWwgWSSgaa	I feed the best food for the individual dog, which may not necessarily attract a high rating.<br>  <br>  I tried Orijen & Solid Gold, but they didn't agree with my Dobermann b*tch. However, with Pro Plan, generally held to be the scourge of the kibble world, she is bright eyed, with a glossy coat & very active.<br>  <br>  My male Dobermann is thriving on Arden Grange, a mid range kibble.<br>  <br>  {I may well change to a raw food diet later, but for the time being both are fine and dandy just as they are}
f06Sy0dfaa	Maybe not at home, BUT, pet shops make little treats for dogs specifically for a dog's bad breath. Where I'm from they call them "yip-yaps". :)|`|TqslFEwQaa	You should go to zellers and ask them|`|d76b933acafc2fee8fc3c072d2e15141aa	they make dog breath mints -sell them at the dog asile in grocery store|`|a6779150ee307fd979ff5c54c79e3cabaa	Tic Tacs|`|cSOwqXKxaa	If your dog is on a good diet (raw or best quality hard kibble) them she shouldn't have smelly breath at all. Unless she ate something unusual or gross, your dog should have non-offensive breath.<br>  <br>  However, if you've been feeding your dog a junk food, like IAMS/Eukenuba, Pedigree, Purina, or grocery brands, then she probably has gum disease. And if your dog is old then she definitely has gum disease.  You should take her to the vet as soon as possible, as gum disease will lead to heart disease and removal of all of her teeth if you don't do what you can now.|`|yyf5N7Ogaa	Dogs have bad breath because they ate something funky or because they have tooth problems. Masking the problem in either case doesn't do any good. <br>  <br>  If he is getting into the garbage or something similar, keep it away from him. If he has tooth problems, make an appointment to take him to the Vet and have his teeth cleaned.|`|inA6ZLeAaa	Yes, you need to brushe her teeth, but if you cannot you need to give her large hard bones to chew on and that way she will use her back teeth to chew on the bone and it will help clean those teeth.

Pm8nsCGZaa	I think driving a horse before riding is excellent.  I do it with all my horses, when they are 6 months +.  They know all the commands when you get on and then you add leg/mouth /head pressure.  Makes it a piece of cake for training.<br>  I recommend it, when starting a youngster or even re-training a horse.  Be sure you drive with a surcingle or saddle and keep the long lines off the ground.<br>  I know you are not asking for info on how to, but here's some good  basis for it. <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_2121699_train-horse-ground-drive.html?ref=fuel&utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=ssp&utm_campaign=yssp_art" rel="nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/how_2121699_train-ho...</a><br>  <br>  !*!*!*  Are you talking driving as pulling a cart?  lol  Just saw another answer and thought..hmmm is this what you mean?<br>  If you mean driving with a cart..I think Arabs are good looking under harness.  It does take awhile to get them where they are safe and would take a professional to do it right..it can take 6 or more months depending on the horse.|`|XJ9oSR2daa	If the horse meets my criteria, you bet.<br>  <br>  I have seen some phenomenal driving arabs.|`|AA11570905	I don't know why not.  Any horse should be capable of pulling a cart.  I trained my little donkey to pull a cart - he was real easy though.  Be sure he is comfortable at each stage of training before you go on to the next stage.  There are no shortcuts to a well trained, confident, safe horse.  I've heard it said though that driving your horse is the most dangerous thing you can do with him.  I believe it too after seeing some of the carnage from carriage accidents.|`|ecf159d9c2d48432e189d0cac81882e2aa	As long as it's done correctly.<br>  It takes a long time to get a horse safe to drive.<br>  <br>  I am currently training my riding instructor's Belgian x Quarter Horse x Standardbred mare to drive.

Do you intend to do it on your own? If so, I would advise against it. A poorly started horse in driving can be ruined forever unlike a riding horse. If they are scared because of a cart accident or something like that, you are far more likely to be hurt seriously than astride. Get help.
13xTQ5lsaa	The white cottony stuff is probably saprolegnia - a fungus.  It is common in tanks and is often lethal if it infects fish.  That doesn't mean that it killed the fish, though - in most tanks, saprolegnia forms on decaying fish and food.  If fish are healthy, they are usually fairly resistant to it - but if they get stressed, they can succumb quickly.  Check your water parameters and quality - if ammonia, nitrites, or nitrates are high - or there is LOTS of saprolegnia in the tank from overfeeding - fish will succumb to the disease.  Remove the carcass of the dead fish if you already haven't.  Also, if you haven't already, you may want to lower the temp back down -warmer water doesn't hold as much oxygen as cooler water which could also stress your fish (if ich is still a problem - it is not necessary to keep the water temp high - you'll just have to treat longer because the ich cycle is slower in cooler temps.)  If you notice any cottony stuff on live fish - you'll need to treat with a fungus medication (and possibly some anti-bacterials for secondary infections).  The sooner you catch it, the better chance you have of saving the fish.<br>  <br>  Another possibility for a white-cottony substance is columnaris - a bacteria that looks a lot like a fungus.  It can be very difficult to treat and catching it early is critical.  A lot of anti-fungal medicines include treatments for columnaris as well.<br>  <br>  I wish you luck!|`|C8P2Ph97aa	appears that you are overstocked.  I have a saltwater tank, but have read that you can something like 1 inch of fish per 2 gallons of water.  do the research on that.

If tiger catfish are small cory size then I would say you have to kick up your water changes.  You should be changing at least 50% every other week.  If tiger catfish are 4-5" or larger then I would say you have clearly overstocked your aquairum and need a larger one.  You still need to do the water changes no matter what size your aqurium is though  you'll always be in trouble if you are overstocked.|`|bDPVRtCNaa	Ich appears as salt-like markings all over the fish.

RloOJ43haa	Plow reining is also called direct reining. In essence, to turn left, you pull on the left rein. <br>  <br>  It means that the horse is loping under saddle but is not well balanced in the gait and comes unbalanced easily.|`|meoRbjgCaa	Plow reining is when you take the reins in both hands with direct contact on each side of the bit with each hand.  Most horses are plow reined before they learn to neck rein. This is often used to teach them to give to the bridle (particularly laterally) and collect.<br>  <br>  A horse who is working on their balance at the lope most likely has not been trained for a very long time and their muscles are still adjusting to the collection required in a comfortable rounded lope. As opposed to a veteran horse who has been doing it for years and is accurately muscled enough to where it is like second nature to carry the collected lope.<br>  <br>  It sounds like these horses have not been under saddle for a very long time and/or their training has just never been completed.  I'm not sure exactly what your looking for in a horse, these terms may suggest a "project" horse who requires finishing. If this is not what your are looking for I would suggest acquiring a finished horse whose training has been taken past the point of plow reining and already has an established balanced lope.  Good luck!|`|V7Y9ldTUaa	I am a hunter jumper but i will take a guess at the plow reining. I think it is if you were to teach a horse to pull a cart, you would work on the ground behind them with riens on each side of thier body as if to simualate if they were being driven, or hooked up to a plow. That is my guess. <br>  <br>  Working on balance at the lope just means that the horse is not 100% comfortable on his feet at the lope. Maybe he leans into his corners and doesnt carry himself well. He is still developing a good lope and is not finished yet.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|PWankIUpaa	Plow reined is the pulling with force the reins to one side or the other . It is commonly used in English riding when finessed. You also should use your legs to turn a horse left or right. Plow reigning when done poorly is very hard on the horse and will cause him to balk and be off balance . There is a real ART to English riding which is my preference. <br>  <br>  Western riding is fun too and my horses were always trained ot drive as well. I loved fine harness classes and Silver Saddles Classes.<br>  <br>  An old breeder friend use to own the most beautiful Silver Saddle when he showed his Andalusian  named Gannadore in Parade classes. <br>  <br>  That beautiful Silver  horse with that beautifully worked silver saddle and him working to perfection and then to see this horse turn around and work so beautifully in gated classes was the best memories that I have from my earlier life.|`|hEXb1unraa	Plow reining is an old term used to mean direct reining......because when you drove a horse or used  a "plow" it reined by pulling left rein meant going left, and pulling right rein meant going right.|`|mKWwz1uUaa	Plow rein is when you pull left they go left and vis versa, you can train to neck rein most young horse start this way, but can easily be trained to neck rein.  The other sorry I've never heard of myself either.|`|pEbAaUaWaa	I would be super careful about getting into a horse that has learned to "plow" rein. They tend to be very ill manored and they have a hard time with change. I would actually have the present owner of the horse show you how they trained the horse, and actually have them do a diminstration of the ground work to show you if the horse is well manored because-i am sure you have heard this a million times- but if the horse has no respect for the handeler on the ground then you are pretty well out of luck when it comes to getting in the saddle.<br>    Good luck|`|QpElKY8Kaa	"Plow reined" is two handed riding.  Left hand on left rein, right hand on right rein, as in a non-neck reined horse.  (Direct reined)   <br>  <br>  Horses used agriculturally are trained to voice rather than physically pulling on the reins (lines).  Gee is the command for right, Haw is for Left.|`|5kUxkun3aa	Would plow reined not just be long reined.<br>  <br>  <br>  edit......just searched it nothing complected. oh and it's done in the saddle.

jyGTlpzTaa	Most people dont pay attention to no pets rules anyway. I know I dont ;) Poor rich people, having to pay to keep their properties in good condition. Kids can do damage to properties too, but you dont see anywhere near the same amount of landlords banning kids from their properties.<br>  <br>  I think it would be much more fair if landlords specified that only caged pets were allowed, because they wont be roaming free to do damage. Not like having a dog or cat, but better than nothing.<br>  <br>  Also for those who moan about landlords having to replace stuff, that is what we pay deposits for...so they can refuse to give you it back if the property or interior is damaged in anyway.

Noise, odor, they can get loose, etc.  Some landlords don't want to deal with the hassle.  I would just tell your landlord to shove-off by moving out and finding a place that does allow pets and verbally let your landlord know that is the reason you  are moving out.  Maybe talk to them and see if you can put down a pet deposit.|`|1StA2Bklaa	I haven't but a friend of mine did.  It felt like the landlord was rubbing it in her face!  Like, haha I have a pet and you don't.  It's like they are really trying to maintain their authority by showing you what they have and what you can't have.  <br>  Doesn't seem fair to me.|`|AA10394958	the guy is the landlord, he can set the rules he wants even if it it seems unfair.|`|njgHAiBiaa	Tenants told me they would take care of their cats - they ended up letting their cats poop and pee in the dirt basement (the unit was located in Muskoka where dirt basements are common in heritage homes).  I had to shovel out the cat poop, in this very unventilated basement.  They also left cat litter in the sink.  Burned once, never again, so probably other landlords have had similar experiences.|`|Bw18seFqaa	landlords OWN the property and can do what they want.<br>  <br>  They have a right to protect their property and investment..  including not allowing tenants to have pets.  People who rent often do not care if their pets are destructive.. they dont have to pay to replace the carpeting and woodwork.  Pets can do thousands of dollars worth of damage, and the landlord is the one stuck paying for it when that tenant moves out.<br>  <br>  The landlord isnt likely going to let his own pets destroy things.<br>  <br>  <br>  It may not seem fair that a landlord has pets, but the tennant doesnt, but its also not fair when the landlord has to pay for the damage done by other's pets.<br>  <br>  Want pets?  get your own place, or find houseing that is pet-friendly.
AA10029366	Are you going to start breeding Shibas, too? Do you still breed Sams?<br>  <br>  The way I look at it, you are a breeder of one breed, and owner/collector of 3. How does that make you irresponsible with the one breed you actually breed?<br>  <br>  Frankly, if you bred a litter of all 3 here and there you still wouldn't be irresponsible -- the working/showing/testing is there. But I don't know if you even qualify for that sort of sordid speculation.<br>  <br>  I breed (show, work) Siberians, own/show Dachshunds, and am *seriously* thinking about getting a Swedish Vallhund to show. Does that make me irresponsible, or just nuts?|`|4rwouQHOaa	Animal artworks you bad bad breeder. You know that owning more than one breed makes you a puppymill. Shame on you for even thinking about having three different types of breeds. I might just go and faint now. <br>  <br>  - End sarcasm.<br>  <br>  Add; Tony said it best, in my opinion anyways.|`|kWwgWSSgaa	Destined for the hall of shame.........<br>  <br>  Anyone who breeds after gaining extensive knowledge of their chosen breeds, breeds with health, stability function & the breed standard in mind...should be positively avoided! <br>  <br>  Hmmm, well I would buy a pup from such a plainly *irresponsible* breeder.|`|ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	I know of good breeders that have three breeds.  Heck, the previous president of the Canadian Kennel club has bred (that I know of) Borzoi (the breed he's known for), Skye Terriers, and French Bulldogs.  I think he had a Standard Poodle, too.<br>  <br>  My only concern with *breeding* multiple breeds is that it's hard enough to REALLY learn a breed, let alone two, especially if the breeds are very different.  If I were wanting to buy one, I'd want to get one from someone who has Bassets as their primary breed, not a "sideline".<br>  <br>  As far as *owning* different breeds, I don't see why you can't have as many different breeds as you like, even mutts.|`|x8Vgu6acaa	Responsible breeding is based on quality.  Showing, working and health testing is how you determine quality. It also includes finding quality homes for your puppies and being willing to be responible for them for the rest of their lives if those homes don't work out.   If you are doing these things then you will continue to be a responsible breeder.<br>  <br>  The above criteria, is extremely time consuming and expensive.  That is the reason that most responsible breeders only have 1 or two breeds.  But, if someone can keep the quality up with more breeds then the number of breeds does not eject them from the responsible breeders club.|`|d5781f30069ecf14d7c481d2dc40aec7aa	This is not an answer but a related question (you may start my bludgeoning now) <br>  Let me preface by saying I am not a breeder. My Dog is spayed. I have no intention of breeding. <br>  <br>  Since the Shiba will be male and your partner's isn't the burden of knowing that breed on your partner? Also, once you get past the health testing and titles isn't most of the breeding burden on the ***** and her owner rather than your partner and the stud?|`|Os6VjLH0aa	I don't think so! "Bad breeder" is usually reserved for people that not only breed more than one breed, but also do no testing or showing and don't bother to pick the right mate for the dog being bred, but, pick the closest one and breed the same pair over and over regardless of quality.<br>  You sound like a conscientious breeder to me!|`|Bw18seFqaa	Most reputable breeders only have 1 or 2 breeds.<br>  <br>  However its possible to have more breeds and do it responsibly... I dont know many who do tho, its just hard to focus on more than one or two breeds.  <br>  <br>  Most breeders that I know with mutliple breeds do not actually breed often (for example in the 6 years you've had Berners, you've only had 2 litters)..  they tend to focus more on showing and working their dogs, doing research, educating others on the breed(s), etc.|`|HgMFrllLaa	Best of luck :)))<br>  Decent person/breeder will remain one despite the circumstances :)|`|AA11026827	No, you wouldn't be.  You actually do things with your dogs, and you would register them with legitimate registries.  Adding breeds doesn't make you a bad breeder automatically, changing your standards does, and it doesn't sound like you're about to do that.<br>  <br>  I know a breeder who breeds GSD.  They also had rat terriers that ran around and helped with rodent control (60 acres of land).  On a whim, they were bred, just to try something else out, and because they wanted more ratters.<br>  <br>  If there's a purpose in mind, and you're not sacrificing your standards and morals, I see no problem with it.|`|eDySIDPQaa	You can be a responsible breeder if you have 2 different breeds.<br>  <br>  Most reputable breeders today, have 2 breeds, some 3, it depends if they show and if family members show as well...having 2 different breeds does not make you a bad breeder....<br>  <br>  Bad breeders are puppy mills, BYB, they have lots of breeds and do it for the money, not for the breed standards or love of the dog, but for the money only.<br>  <br>  that is the difference between a reputable breeder and a sorry no good breeder.<br>  <br>  No, your  not a bad breeder, if you are breeding to improve the breed standard and not just for the money...|`|AA12128656	i hardly think number of breeds is the only criteria that people should be basing you on. how long is your wait list? you pre-sell, right?<br>  <br>  plus a litter every 2.5 years isn't much. just as long as you're still taking good care, health teating, preselling, etc, what's the big deal?<br>  <br>  now if you set up a website and start shipping dogs all over, i will change my mind.|`|qioH81tiaa	Well, yes, of course, since the criteria for breeders seems to be the number of breeds they have, if they have a website, if they ship puppies and if they take Paypal.<br>  <br>  Not if they health test, show/work their dogs, support the buyers of their puppies, have a great puppy contract, etc. etc. etc.<br>  <br>  Anyone that dismisses you simply because you have 3 breeds isn't someone you'd sell a puppy to anyway.
3a1d98e5d06e33a288cfd5d40b0c4470aa	For crying out loud, this is a pup you are dealing with. He is a young dog who is trying to find his way in a human pack. No one has defined any boundaries for him and because he is a member of the entire family, there probably will not be any boundaries. <br>  <br>  There is nothing wrong with your dog's behaviour and he is not stressed or in a state. He shows you affection as dogs do. He may bark at you or your younger brother, just because he is a young dog. Your younger brother may be a little nervous and which is why the dog barked. Tell your brother to stroke him and show some affection. Just talk to the dog or get a toy.<br>  <br>  Dogs do not really live with a guilt complex like humans do. LOL Just give it time and discuss with the family how you plan to interrelate with the dog as a family and individually. Make a plan, so he can bond with each person.|`|1H0vYaJxaa	It sounds as if the animal has claimed you as its owner. And when anyone whom could be considered a threat (such as you not giving him your fullest attention) he will act out. As far as peeing... Well it is a dog and that is what they do. It doesn't mater how much you train them some dogs are not always house broken.|`|81675c7bcc2aa81478472216e01229f7aa	It sounds like he is reacting out of stress.  He may not like to be locked in your room.  I would try crate training.  And he is marking - that's why he's peeing everywhere.<br>  <br>  Is he neutered?|`|SpcYCBndaa	he crazy|`|wz9szz3Gaa	Since he spends his time with you mostly he has taken on the role of Alpha which makes him want to defend you from any harm. He looks at your brother as a threat to you. Simple fix ask your brother to acknowledge him try petting him more and then the threat should go away. Good luck!
40EotGSlaa	Well, maybe he doesnt want to hurt you, so he controlls it by biting other things, i reckon you have a VERRY clever dog!|`|0yFk2qCmaa	<a href="http://takingforyou.uk.to" rel="nofollow">http://takingforyou.uk.to</a><br>  A very informative website you can also get much information in website|`|OxFsslN8aa	Dogs can't use their paws to hold things the way humans use their hands - so a dog uses it's mouth.  Your dog tries to hold you in place so that you will play with him or pay attention to him.
HgMFrllLaa	While it's true that a direct "eye contact" can mean a challenge. Your dog is asking for your attention :)<br>  The pack leader stuff gets way too much attention in these days :)|`|P2yRAWiJaa	Staring is uncomfortable for most dogs. Some see it as a sign of aggression. If yours is looking away he is probably submitting to you...just not right away.<br>  <br>  As for the biting/holding, you've trained him to "let go" when you tell him to.|`|4444d48004267fc3c148eb176ef253d8aa	Not necessarily.  Some dogs may not respond much to eye contact, but may be presenting other dominant behaviors.  It may be best to read about dog training.  Look for books at the library by Brian Kilcommons or the Koehler Method of Dog Training.|`|p7swtBYzaa	Probably means that the poor dog is used to your acting like a fool.<br>  <br>  Please take a group obedience class with your dog and learn how to train him properly - you need help.|`|KxjUim7yaa	A dog looking away is submissive. A dog that holds your gaze then averts his eyes is considering . If you go to take something and say "give" or "drop it" and he does right away, that is submissive. Anything else he is considering if you are really alpha.

Even though some breeds are more dog aggressive, that doesn't effect how they get along as long as their socialized as puppies|`|OZHJW5jXaa	hi yes i think they will be fine as long as you socialise them . i own a male springer spaniel 5 years , female bulldog 2 years and a 5 month old female american akita and they all get along fine . but the akita can be stubborn and they need a firm but fair owner  as do all dogs . <br>  hope this helps and good luck with your new dogs.|`|mnufOa6eaa	YES! Between me and my mom we have 5 different breeds of dog and they ALL get along except for the occasional spat. As well, a male and female pairing is better(at times but not as a rule) as both can be dominant.

Next curry the horse and brush it very carefully . This lets you observe the head for eye matter which could indicate and illness then look for slashes on the legs and body or neck to see if he has any cuts. When he is all nice and shiny then make a decision to bathe or not. my old horses loved a bath. When all dry curry again to make sure he was dry and slowly place a blanket or pad on his back . Use the proper  pad or blanket to fit the saddle. When the saddle is on start your work out easily , mussels get sore from not having a proper warn up.

pDPSaL37aa	First of all, make sure she has no injuries. If she does, look for an avian vet in your area. She may be traumatized for the time being. Put a towel over half of her cage during the day and completely over her cage at night and make sure it stays quiet in your room for the next 4 days. She should get over it. This happened to my birds years ago when my cat jumped on top of the cage. They were perfectly fine after a while.

E3v91Vz4aa	The dog run down a lane over 4 hurdles (jumps) to a spring loaded box(flyball box).

Both of them love it.  I think my border collie likes it better than my yorkie.  I also enjoy it or I wouldn't be doing it.<br>  <br>  One can teach a dog to do it by themselves if they know what you are doing but it is always better if someone show you first. If you want to teach it correctly, there is more to it than just jumping over some jumps and catching a ball.<br>  <br>  Probably better if I point to you some reference:<br>  <br>  FLYBALL RACING, THE DOG SPORT FOR EVERYONE is a good book to refer to.<br>  <a href="http://www.dogwise.com/ItemDetails.cfmID=DTA155&AffiliateID=45071&Method=3" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogwise.com/ItemDetails.cfmID...</a><br>  <br>  One start with foundation work:  Very important for dog's drive and speed.

The cost of building a shoot probably only run you about $80|`|AA10229248	I have a dog in flyball and it's way more than just teaching your dog to run, jump and catch a ball. If you're serious about it you need to find a club in your area and sign up for classes. <br>  <br>  If you just set up a lane (not "thingy") and make your dog jump the hurdles without teaching him how to properly trigger the box, you could seriously injure your dog and/or cuase it to fear the box. <br>  <br>  A dog also has to learn how to properly pass other dogs on the team as well as stay in their own lane when another dog is running in the next lane. <br>  <br>  Classes will help teach you how to get a solid recall from your dog, work on social passing, teach your dog how to enjoy the sport, and keep him safe and healthy while competing.|`|ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	I did flyball way back when the ball actually got launched into the air and the dog had to catch it.<br>  <br>  He loved it, he was ball crazy.<br>  <br>  See if there is a trainer in the area giving flyball classes, or a flyball group that takes beginners.

AA10049109	A  lot of it depends upon your personality.  Bully breeds can be quite dominant and end up having aggression problems if you don't handle them properly.  They are generally high energy dogs and require discipline and exercise to keep them balanced.  They are not for everyone...part of the reason there are so many problems with the breed in general. Not the dog's fault, but the owners.  If you're a person that exercises his dogs regularly with disciplined walks, not just throwing a ball around the yard, and keeps their dogs disciplined and calm, then I'd say go for the bully.  If not, a greyhound might be a better choice.|`|Mnkuxy8yaa	pitbull.<br>  Greyhounds have very little body fat and really shouldn't be kept outdoors.

It may be too far gone, but I would maybe consider contacting your local shelter to see if they have any advice.  How I would go about doing it:<br>  <br>  1) have a cage that opens from the side so you don't have to reach your whole hand in there to let it come to you<br>  <br>  2) find out what it's favorite treats are<br>  <br>  3) ONLY offer it those treats by your hand.  don't dump it in the cage. either he takes it from your hand or he doesn't get it.  he'll learn to associate delicious food with humans<br>  <br>  4) try to coax him out of the cage with the treat.  use the treat as a reward after you touch him, pet him, hold him, etc. so he thinks "hey, humans touching me means I get treats i want more!"<br>  <br>  Just what I would try.  I haven't had a hamster (but have had rats) and don't know how intelligent they are, but it seems like the most logical way to go about it.  Good luck!|`|pdmAHTGdaa	For taming, start slow by putting your hand in the cage. Let it get comfortable with the hand maybe for a couple days. Then take out the food bowl and put the food in your hand (make sure it's hungry) and let it take the food from your hand. Then once it's completely ok with letting you have your hand in its cage, stroke it with your hand and let it get used to that. Just work your way up. Pretty soon start handling it. If you want, you can scoop it up with a container. Once it's in your hand, it won't bite. I had a very very very vicious hamster that bit everyone and everything but once she was in your hand she was fine!|`|oNHtVHzsaa	you should definetly take it to the vet first to get it checked out and make sure it's not ill at all. i would wait a few days before trying to handle it. let it get used to it's surrondings, and understand that it is not going to get hurt. you may want to try w/ something that has your scent on it, but is not your hand. then if the hamster lunges at you, it won't hurt you. just give it a few days to warm up and it will start to get better. good luck and hope this helped.|`|zdBInQReaa	Some hamsters are just cage aggressive.

However, it's much less common. In any event, you should get into the habit of bloat prevention right now, sooner rather than later. <br>  <br>  There should not be any exercising before and especially after eating. Establish now that the dog is expected to be quiet and relaxed for at least a half hour before and one hour after eating. Many owners crate the dog after meals to ensure that they're calm. (Of course, that means you must teach the dog to enjoy the crate. The entire point is avoiding stress.)<br>  <br>  For a handy compilation of bloat info, you might want to read this article:<br>  <a href="http://www.globalspan.net/bloat.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.globalspan.net/bloat.htm</a>|`|s76aC4G8aa	He can get bloat at any time, it's not restricted to just adults, any large deep chested dog can be prone to this.  My advice is always wait 1-2 hours after eating before exercising and 1 hour after exercising before feeding. Keep Mylanta Gas on hand this will reduce the amount of gas build up in your dogs stomach if he does get bloat.  However, if you feed small meals twice a day and wait before and after exercising to feed then you will be ok.<br>  <br>  vigorous exercise is anything where the dog does a lot of running or is taken on a long hike or prolonged walk.<br>  <br>  Just follow those rules and you won't have to worry.|`|49ec8e0944023c0f5c20e37484f16366aa	Bloat can be confusing, so many theories, things to watch out for.  Yet some dogs bloat no matter what precautions are taken.  You can find a lot of data & statistics online, a lot of it contradictory. One year raised food bowls are recommended, the next year a study says raised bowls can contribute to bloat, etc.<br>  <br>  Generally though, males have a higher incidence of bloat than female.  The chances go higher with age in some respects because ligaments supporting the stomach can loosen with age.<br>  Running, jumping, high level activity especially on a full stomach, or allowing huge amounts of water following that activity, has been linked possibly to bloat.<br>  <br>  All you can do is read all you can from credible sources, and take any precautions that you feel are valid.  Good luck.<br>  <br>  add:  Probably the most important thing is to be able to recognize the signs of bloat and take the dog to the vet immediately.
4aAhEK9daa	Whoa - someone is selling you an eight week old PERSIAN?  Then turn and run the other way!  Reputable breeders do NOT sell their kittens until they're at least 10 weeks old - more often 12 weeks old.  And you do NOT want to buy a Persian from a backyard breeder as backyard breeders don't test for PKD.<br>  <br>  PKD - Polycystic Kidney Disease - is an early onset form of kidney disease that Persians are genetically predisposed to.  Reputable breeders test their cats and never breed PKD+ animals - backyard breeders don't - which means PKD kittens.  A PKD positive cat can go into renal failure - and DIE - as early as four years old.<br>  <br>  As for what they eat - they should be fed a healthy food high in meat-based protein and with little to no grain.  What really do you know about caring for Persians?  I won't type it all here but this is an answer I gave to someone else <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090205200931AAEQM6X&r=w&pa=AptqD2bwHTHc7eWFZaUzvOVAJSykcub2PBI825J6CaDzCQ--&paid=voted">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>  Please do NOT get a Persian impulsively - and from a bad breeder.|`|uBFhKXgHaa	A high quality one would be good.<br>  <br>  Not all pet food is made equally. A lot of it is full of corn, by-products, dyes, unhealthy preservatives, filler grains and all sorts of nasty stuff. A lot of pet food companies are perfectly happy to the dump cheap leftovers and things that aren't safe for human consumption (from human food processing plants) into their foods. Will it kill your cat? No, it has to be nutritionally complete and safe to even be marketed. Is it healthy? Not by a long shot.<br>  <br>  Corn is a low quality ingredient you never want to see in your pet food. Corn and low quality grains are two of the biggest culprits when it comes to food allergies in our pets.<br>  <br>  Thankfully, there are some excellent cat foods being made these days that include organic, human grade ingredients rather than trash not fit for human consumption.<br>  <br>  Examples of low quality foods to avoid: Anything you can find in a grocery store will be low end, Purina, Iams, Eukanuba, Science Diet, Royal Canin, Whiskas, Fancy Feast, Friskies, Meow Mix.<br>  <br>  Examples of high quality foods to look for: Innova, Wellness, Solid Gold, Felidae, Fromm Four Star, Merrick, GO Natural, Nature's Variety Prairie, Nature's Logic, Artemis Fresh Mix, Timber Wolf Organics.<br>  <br>  Although the high quality foods are more expensive, you're getting what you're paying for. Less filler material and higher quality ingredients means more concentrated nutrients... this means you typically need to feed far less of the high quality food than you would of the low quality one. Which also means less poop!<br>  <br>  Seriously on a budget? Two of the most affordable of the higher quality foods would be Chicken Soup for the Cat Lover's Soul and Felidae.<br>  <br>  Before following your vet's food recommendation, keep in mind that vets get /very/ little nutritional training during their schooling. Besides that, what training they /do/ get is usually sponsored or taught by... you guessed it, the crappy pet food companies! They also often get kickbacks from the companies for pushing these products at their clinics (Science Diet, Royal Canin etc.)<br>  <br>  A great option is to go with an entirely grain-free diet. Diets high in grain/carbohydrates have been attributed to problems with diabetes in cats. Cats are obligate carnivores, so why should there be grain in their diet? Many of the high quality foods now put out grain-free formulas. Some good grain-free diets include: Innova EVO, Wellness CORE, Blue Wilderness, Nature's Variety Instinct, Orijen, Horizon Legacy, Fromm Surf & Turf, Now!, GO Natural Grain Free, Sold Gold Indigo Moon, Ziwipeak, and Taste of the Wild.<br>  <br>  Some pretty decent foods can even be found in common pet stores. Petsmart carries Blue Buffalo products (such as the excellent grain free diet Blue Wilderness). Petco carries Wellness, Solid Gold, Natural Balance, Eagle Pack Holistic Select, Blue Buffalo, Castor & Pollux Organix, Pinnacle, and Halo. <br>  <br>  If you can't find a food, most of the high quality cat food brands have websites with store locators on them that will help you find the store closest to you which supplies their products. Simply type the cat food brand's name into Google, go to their website, and type your zip code into their store locator.<br>  <br>  Another option, if you can't find anywhere around you that sells good foods, is to order your pet food online. Here's an excellent place to do so: <a href="http://www.petfooddirect.com/store/" rel="nofollow">http://www.petfooddirect.com/store/</a><br>  <br>  Remember that foods should be switched gradually (mixing the new slowly in with the old over the period of about week or so), especially when switching to a higher quality one, so as not to upset tummies. For example:<br>  Days 1 & 2: 75% old food, 25% new food<br>  Days 3 & 4: 50% old food, 50% new food<br>  Days 5 & 6: 25% old food, 75% new food<br>  Day 7: 0% old food, 100% new food<br>  <br>  Another option for feeding cats is to feed raw. This is something that should be thoroughly researched before being attempted:<br>  <a href="http://www.rawfedcats.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.rawfedcats.org/</a> (Raw Fed Cats)<br>  <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/rawdogs/profile/" rel="nofollow">http://community.livejournal.com/rawdogs...</a> (Raw Dogs Livejournal Community [not just for dogs despite the name!], excellent raw feeding information on the profile page and overall helpful community for raw feeding questions)<br>  <a href="http://www.rawfed.com/myths/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.rawfed.com/myths/index.html</a> (Myths About Raw Feeding)<br>  <br>  Now the question is, do you feed wet or dry? Wet is the correct answer. The reason is, in the wild, cats normally get most of their water content directly from their prey items and drink very little. Domestic cats are no different, and because of the fact that they are designed to take in water with their meal, they have a very low thirst drive. Cats often just don't drink enough. This leads to urinary tract infections and crystals. The bit about dry food being better for teeth is a myth and has not been proven in the least (cats barely even chew their dry food and, really, does a pretzel clean /your/ teeth? Cats should have their teeth brushed with cat toothbrushes and cat toothpaste at least a few times a week as well as see the vet for dental cleanings when necessary /regardless/ of what they are being fed). Canned/wet food is better because it more closely mimics the cat's natural diet. More on why canned food is best:<br>  <a href="http://www.catinfo.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.catinfo.org/</a>  (Excellent cat nutrition information by a vet)<br>  <a href="http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?action=library&act=show&item=whycatsneedcannedfood" rel="nofollow">http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?ac...</a> (Why Cats Need Canned Food)<br>  <a href="http://cats.about.com/cs/catfood/a/canned_food.htm" rel="nofollow">http://cats.about.com/cs/catfood/a/canne...</a> (Canned Cat Food: Can Your Cat Afford to Live Without it?)<br>  <a href="http://www.felinefuture.com/nutrition/bpo_ch4.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.felinefuture.com/nutrition/bp...</a> (The Dry Food Crisis)<br>  <a href="http://maxshouse.com/feline_nutrition.htm" rel="nofollow">http://maxshouse.com/feline_nutrition.ht...</a> (Max's House: Feline Nutrition)<br>  <br>  Another option to get cats to drink more would be a cat fountain. Cats tend to like to drink from running water and cat fountains see to that need, encouraging cats to take in more water.<br>  <br>  Also remember that freefeeding (leaving food down) is the fast lane to feline obesity. Make sure to have scheduled feeding times loosely based on the feeding guidelines on your cat's food. Adult cats are typically fed two meals a day.<br>  <br>  More:<br>  <a href="http://www.dogfoodanalysis.com/dog_food_reviews/" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogfoodanalysis.com/dog_food_...</a> (Dog food reviews.

58410e61549a3fe40d177cf7e71fc875aa	Hock fusion can be a spontaneous reaction to osteoarthritis in the hock joint (the bones eventually fuse themselves), or it can be brought about by introducing chemicals in to the joint, to speed the process up, or even performed by drilling holes in to the bones to encourage new bone formation. It is only ever performed in the lower joints of the hock.<br>  <br>  There are four joints in the hock. Bone spavin is a fancy term for osteoarthritis of the bottom two hock joints. Ninety percent of the range of motion in the hock comes from the top joint. In bone spavin, the affected joints are the bottom two joints, which are flat joints. They do not need to flex in order for the horse to move normally. If the joints fuse, the pain resolves completely.<br>  <br>  Fortunately, treatment of this problem is very successful. Treatment involves one of four choices. The first option is simply to warm the horse up on a loose rein for 15-20 minutes, prior to strenuous exercise, and to give bute (an aspirin like drug for horses) as needed. More often these horses are treated with joint injections. One can inject these horses with a drug like hylaronic acid, which is anti-inflammatory as well as helpful in re-establishing normal joint fluid. Other drugs used for joint injections are corticosteroids. Corticosteroids are more powerful anti-inflammatory drugs than hylaronic acid. However, corticosteroids will cause the cartilage that lines the joint surface to become brittle. This will hasten the fusing of the joints (which is good in the lower hock joints), but will require the joints to be injected more often then if hylaronic acid is used. <br>  <br>  If a horse becomes unresponsive to joint injections two alternatives remain. Both are attempts to cause complete fusion of the lower two joints in the hock. As stated above, these are the joints are causing the pain. However, these joints only contribute a very small part of to the range of motion in the hock. If the joints are fused, either naturally or through medical intervention, the pain caused by the bone spavin is eliminated.<br>  <br>  One method of causing the fusion, called arthrodesis, is surgical. The horse is placed under general anesthesia. Using a surgical drill, the cartilage in the affected joints is literally drilled off. This causes the joint to heal bone to bone resulting in fusion.<br>  <br>  Within the past five years an alternative to surgery has been developed. This method uses a chemical agent to erode the joint surface leading to fusion. The hock is injected with the chemical MIA. The horse will be very painful for 4 to 16 hours. This painful period is managed with intravenous medication. For the next two weeks, the horse will be very sound. Over the following month it will regress somewhat. At one practice where 38 cases were treated in this way, 75% (29 patients) responded to treatment to the point where they were back performing their desired activity. Of the remaining 25%, three more cases responded when a surgical arthrodesis (described above) was done following the chemical treatment.<br>  <br>  By the sound of it, your horse is indeed lame, but nobody can diagnose without seeing the animal. Really, you need to get your vet out to evaluate the problem.|`|RgDdC8vbaa	My horse was just raidographed (x-ray) for hock fusion, im not gonna make this long and confusing, its where the cartilage wears away and the bone fuse together, its  permanent once the bones fuse, your horse may have problems with collection, turns, or even plain riding. You need to see a vet to be able to tell if it is, but if it is you can have surgery to speed up the process by about 6 months to a year, or get injections some can help to speed along the process as well, the surgery is not cheap, and the injections are any where from 200 to 400 depending. It will take a long time to completely fuse about 3 to 4 years depending on your horse, how much you ride, how far along the horse is and what treatments you get, I dont have the money to pay for treatments so i am taking the bute coarse, i give my horse bute about a hour before i ride, and it last 8 hours, and i give it at least 2 times a week when my horse is being work if not once a week, like any drug you dont want to over do it. you can still ride just be carefull not to over do anything or your horse can become lame, and you should probably avoid joint strenuous work like jumping or speed events until fusion is complete then things should be kosher depending on what joint it is. It isnt overly painful they just get sore and have bad days
MstjbpVJaa	There are two things that could be responsible for your birds behaviour<br>  <br>  1 Depending on how old they are ,they could be coming into breeding condition and if in a Cage then they are confined to a small area and unable to go about their natural mating procedure.this will cause them frustration.(You need a bigger cage or better still an Aviary.)with a large nest box.<br>  <br>  2,Once again how old are they?if they are not over 2 years then they will not be showing their true sex colours and you could possibly have two males.<br>  <br>  The male will have a black to  purple ring round it's neck the female will not have this.<br>  <br>  These are just a couple of factors come back with anymore info please.<br>  <br>  In over 40years of breeding Ring neck and mutations I have never experienced,the hens or the C*cks killing each other<br>  I had aviaries with two pair to an aviary,as they prefer to breed in company,as they are a sociable bird. your birds are getting frustrated either separate them for a while or get an Aviary.<br>  <br>  You could also try fitting a nest box to the cage but this would need to be at least 12,ins square by at least 24 ,ins deep.<br>  this will only be possible if you cage has two doors,or if you devise some whay|`|0B4plcLEaa	How old is your female? Is she close to maturity (2 years)?  Ringnecks can be really funny acting  when they reach sexual maturity. Sometimes the female will reach maturity before the male. The male will normally become "rung out" (gaining their rings and reaching sexual maturity) between 18- 36 months. If the female is the one to do this first and the male has no intrest in breeding she will sometimes attack and they can kill the males. My friend and I run a breeding business together. We have several pairs of different species of birds (and pets too!!). We have Irn pairs, I also have kept one as a pet. We have lost two males from hens attacking them because they were ready to breed and the males were not. My advice would be to get another cage and set them side by side. They can still see each other and have time out of the cage to play together under supervision. If you keep them in the same cage the female may eventually hurt him badly or kill him.

DpT9qJ6Naa	I would go with M/F combo--yes, spay and neuter both.  You can also use the canine personality Profile if you have an adult dog and are looking for a second dog to add to your "pack".  Answer the questions on the "profile" and see what type of personality your current dog possess.<br>  <br>  NEVER pick two alpha dogs.  The less dominate the dogs the more inclined they will be to let you be the "alpha"--thus you should have less behavioral problems.|`|QLopvWKDaa	I have heard that the best success would be with opposite sex, then two males and NEVER two female! Although, I am sure that stating that will bring many comments about how wrong that is!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|pc7ZjexJaa	its harder to have 2 females than 2 males or a female and a male|`|KxjUim7yaa	A m/f combo is better than a m/m or a f/f. Neuter and spay both.|`|1StA2Bklaa	Well, do you already have one at home and getting another?  It depends on how dominate the one you have at home is.  If you are bringing a puppy into the mix, usually they do fine and gender doesn't matter.  We have 3 huskies, 2 girls and 1 boy.  The older female had a problem with the puppy (female) for the first week and got over it.  Usually huskies are really good with other huskies (usually).<br>  Can you do a "play date/introduction" with them before adopting?  That helps to see how they may get along.  Huskies are "pack" dogs so, usually the more the better for them.|`|kGGlxvkXaa	it depends on personalities but yes they should get along|`|AA10229248	Worst fight I've ever had on my hands was between two female huskies. Generally it's a good idea to have two (spayed/neutered) dogs of the opposite sex. That's not to say two females or two males can't get along. I've had fosters of both sexes at the same time that got along and I have two males huskies that are best buddies. But if you want to save yourself some headaches, consider getting two dogs of the opposite sex.|`|AA10029366	If both were spayed or neutered, two of the same gender would likely be fine. I always recommend getting a dog of the opposite gender to someone looking for a second dog, just to be safe.<br>  <br>  But especially once you remove the hormones, Siberians tend to do fine in same-sex groups.
a2cjwMKcaa	It depends how your water company treats the water.<br>  <br>  If they use plain chlorine and the original water was fairly clean then letting it sit for 24 hours will allow any chlorine residue to evaporate.<br>  <br>  BUT, if your water is treated with Chloramine, that doesn't evaporate like pure chlorine does. so you MUST use water treatement. A dirty water source will also form chloramine when treated with chlorine, so you must use water condtioner on that as well.<br>  <br>  If you dont KNOW, put off your water change for a couple of days, or use some bottled water to do a partial water change.<br>  <br>  Ian|`|eyKx05LKaa	Leaving water sit for 24 hours will remove chlorine, however, it will not remove chloramine which may be in your tap water and is also toxic to fish.  Also, the water may be too cold after sitting at room temperature and could shock your fish if the temperature doesn't match the temperature you have your aquarium set at.  <br>  <br>  The best method is to use a conditioner which removes both chlorine and choramine.  I would wait to do a water change until you have transporation to buy a conditioner.  You may do more harm than good if you try letting your water sit.  Can you find a friend to drive you to the store?|`|wnnudNp5aa	The easiest way to dechlorify water is to get a ride to your pet store and buy a bottle of dechlorifier. They come with names such as Start Right and Aqua-safe. Just follow the directions on the bottle. Let the water warm up to room temperature before using.<br>  The alternative is to let water sit in a bucket for at least 24 hours. The chlorine will dissipate on it's own that way.<br>  Boiling water or buying purified water is totally unnecessary. Aging water will not hurt it.|`|AA11901352	Unfortunately letting water sit out for a few days will NOT dechlor the water.  If that was the case chlorene would need to be added to pools and water supplies every other day and it is not.  It takes weeks.  Also, it isn't just the chlorene but also the chloramates as well as more than 160 other chemicals that are in the tap water you need to treat for.  Letting water sit for 3 days will also make it go "flat".  In short will contain no oxygen and basically start to stagnate.<br>  <br>  Boiling water concentrates the heavy metals and the chloramates and other chemicals and can prove deadly to some fish if used.<br>  <br>  There is NO way to dechlor or make the water safe for your fish other than filtering it (like with a pur or britta or some other form) or using a dechlor.<br>  <br>  I would suggest not doing a water change until you can get to the store or see if someone can pick you up a bottle the next time they are at the store.<br>  <br>  Sorry|`|0NSax0u9aa	You can use the water if you leave it out for 24-48 hours in an open container.|`|pcvcMePXaa	get someone else to go for you theres really no other way besides using dechlorinater   so either that or kill your fish|`|9Xt3UpB1aa	You either need bottled water or a declorifier for tap water, you cannot boil it and get the chlorine out.<br>  <br>  Get a ride from someone and get to the store.

yQiC58bHaa	It's really all based on the shelter you volunteer at. Where I volunteer, anyone under 18 has to either have a parent with them at all times, or have gone through the Kids Care program, which you can start at 11, to become I volunteer. <br>  <br>  They may start you off with some basic things, such as cleaning. Sweeping the hallways, mopping floors, taking out trash, cleaning litter boxes, picking up poop, etc. The may also have to help feed, but many shelters prefer to have their vets do that (if they have their own) since some animals need medications or special food. <br>  <br>  You could also be asked to help out with filing and such. Updating websites if they have one, filling out paper work, answering phones, etc. But shelters will usually have trained staff to do that. <br>  <br>  If you're working with the cats there's not much to do. Pet them, play with them, brush them. It's up to you. If the cats all roam freely in one room (as they do where I volunteer) then just sit down and let them come to you. I wouldn't try picking them up, unless you know for sure they don't mind. I've seen many a visitor get scratched because they picked up cats that didn't enjoy being held. <br>  <br>  If you're working with the dogs, you'll probably be able to take them for walks. However, I know some shelters will only let the person over 18 walk the dog. If you are allowed to walk a dog, I would still only recommend taking one out if you're planning on staying with your dad, as some dogs can be aggressive. If the dogs are together in a kennel, or the staff says they can go out together, then by all means, do so. There's also some walking etiquete I've picked up. Never approach someone with another dog if you're walking one yourself. Like I said before, some dogs don't like others. ALWAYS pick up any poop your dog leaves behind. It's very annoying to have to step over the piles that other people have left. I'd also recommend getting to know a little about the dog before taking them out for a walk; finding out their temperments, how strong they are, if there are other dogs they can go out with, etc. <br>  <br>  There are also a few other things that I've found very helpful. <br>  <br>  Get a good night's sleep the night before. You're going to be very busy, and it'd be terrible to fall asleep on the job. ;)<br>  <br>  Bring a water bottle! You're going to get pretty thirsty. Some places have water fountains, but better to be safe than sorry. <br>  <br>  Wear long pants. A lot of dogs like to jump up on people, and claws hurt on bare skin. As for shirts, pretty much anything's fine, but make sure it has sleeves. Whatever you wear, make sure it's something you don't mind getting dirty!<br>  <br>  Tennis shoes are your best bet, but hiking shoes work just fine. If there's snow or mud outside, I'd say you'd be better off with winter boots or rain boots. <br>  <br>  If it's cold outside and you're going to be walking dogs, bundle up! Long underwear, while not the most fashion-forward, is a life saver. Put it on under your jeans, or even snow pants if you need. If you don't have long johns, then flannels are a pretty good substitute. Wear plenty of layers all over; feet, legs, chest, hands, etc. Hats are a must in cold weather. <br>  <br>  I'd also bring a small drawstring bag or something of the sort. In it you can put your water bottle, a camera if you want, extra socks in case yours get wet, an extra pair of gloves, and anything else you think you may need. <br>  <br>  That's all I can think of at the moment. If you have any other questions, feel free to e-mail me!|`|2eJcaeOPaa	the shelter i volunteer at had me just walking dogs at first i've been there for 18mths now and i get to do everything from cleaning feeding cuddling the dogs going vets all sorts i'ts the greatest place to work i hope you enjoy it as much as i do and i think its so great someone your age is willing to give up there time|`|BL2NfTafaa	Perfect idea. I knew you had to be 18 at most shelters, but I did not know that some would let you volunteer with an adult. Awesome that you have a parent that is willing to do that with you. You must have many animal lovers in your family!|`|ZVP7348Naa	u have sex with them|`|F27az9NEaa	It depends on the facility itself.<br>  But a basic list of things you could be doing is shredding newspaper, filling water bowls, playing/socializing with cats/dogs, greeting people, helping answering phones, bathing dogs, & cleaning kennels.<br>  You may even be able to help out if the shelter has different events during different Holidays (such as decorating, coming up with designs).<br>  <br>  As for preparing, be sure to get a good nights rest (as I'm sure you and your father will have a lot of work to do), and be sure to dress comfortably. Where clothes that you don't mind getting dirty, avoid wearing jewelry, and no open-toe shoes. You may want to bring an extra lead with you, as some shelters run out--and it's good to have your own.<br>  Different shelters/rescues have different policies on how things are done. You may be limited in things you can do, but with your father's supervision I'm sure you'll enjoy it.<br>  Good Luck to you both|`|be58a957ec05b08ab61416f8ea457867aa	Good for you! It's nice to see someone so eager and excited to help out.<br>  <br>  Different shelters will have different policies so your best bet is to contact the shelter where you will be volunteering directly to find out what they will likely have you do. In general, though, you can expect that they will ask you to play with and/or pet cats; perhaps help with simple cleaning such as washing water bowls and scooping litter boxes; walk dogs; bathe or brush calm dogs or puppies; scoop poop if dogs are walked in a communal area and stool isn't picked up immediately; office help such as filing or data entry in the computer. Each shelter should have its own procedures for how these things are done. For instance, washing water bowls may mean filling a sink with water and soap and soaking then rinsing in one shelter but individually dunking each bowl in bleach water and then rinsing and drying in a different shelter.

AA10859773	Don't bother with foods that claim to have ingredients to help the skin.  You're better off adding those items yourself.  Other than that you're doing quite well.<br>  <br>  My advice is to make sure she's eating wet (canned) food rather than dry.  If you do this, you can even add some extra water to mix in with the food and that'll help a great deal.<br>  <br>  You can also look into evening primrose, borage or black currant oils, all of which are sources of omega 6 oils.  Use just a drop of that type of oil, and you can also consider adding omega 6 fish oils.|`|EdB0ghKwaa	One of my cats is also a bit overweight, and the vet said this was why she had dandruff, as she can't reach the base of her tail to clean properly.  <br>  <br>  I have used Vetzyme Moult & Coat Nutritional Oil, which I add to her dried food, and also Dermoscent, which comes in pipettes and you put them on the back of the neck like flea drops.

2Ku4DuvCaa	There is something that you should be aware of about both talking and going outside. First, the talking. Just because a parrot species is known for it's talking ability does not mean that your individual parrot of that species will necessarily learn to talk. I've met African Greys that never said a word, but mimicked some pretty cool sounds. <br>  <br>  The second is going outside. Right now at my vet's office, there's a bulletin board with about eight different "lost parrot" posters. Some of which actually state the owner's surprise that their parrot got away from them because the parrot's wings were clipped. Taking a parrot outside without a harness of some kind is always risky. Even if you clip their wings, when properly motivated you would be surprised how far they can still fly. <br>  <br>  If you've had plenty of good experience with birds, then you probably already know these things. However, in my experience it's best not to leave such important things unsaid.<br>  <br>  Someone suggested an African Grey and called it an "easy" parrot. While theirs might be the exception, I've only met a tiny handful of Greys that qualify as "easy!" While it might be the right bird for you, keep in mind that the large parrots are never easy. They can and will bite whether their hand tame or not, they're messy, they live for a very long time, and they're a huge commitment. <br>  <br>  That said, I've got some suggestions for you! A very sociable bird that I've had some experience with is a Rose Breasted Cockatoo. They're on the smaller side of the cockatoo family, so their cages don't have to eat your living room. In my experience they're quieter than most of the cockatoos, can learn to say a few things, and are very sweet.<br>  <br>  Another parrot you might consider are one of the mini macaws! While I've never met a Hahn's or Noble macaw that could talk, I'm often told that they can learn. Hahn's and Noble macaws are roughly the size of a sun conure with longer tails, and I've never met one that I didn't instantly fall in love with! They're adorable and playful birds that have the spunk of the full sized macaws in a smaller package. There's also the military and severe macaws who I've known to be talkers. While very sweet and fun loving, they can also be temperamental at times. They need a lot of toys and a lot of socialization from you.<br>  <br>  If you're alright with a parrot the size of a conure, you may also check out the wide world of conures. Remember that conures can be VERY loud despite their size so they're not always good for apartment dwellers (you never did mention your living conditions, so I thought I should mention this), but they are often very playful and cuddly birds. <br>  <br>  Another bird about the size of conures are Senegals and Meyer's parrots. I personally have a Senegal, and he's probably the cutest and sweetest little thing ever. Senegals are known to be very mellow and fairly quiet (though they can be loud if they want), and also very gentle. While I've received a few playful carried away nips from him, even when he's displayed dissatisfaction with what was going on around him, he's never tried to bite anyone. He's very hand tame, and much like many of the other Senegals and Meyer's parrots that I've ever met.<br>  <br>  Now, since you say that you're a first time owner, I cannot stress enough how important it is for you to do your own research on any species that you might be interested in. Parrots are not easy pets, and the larger they get the more difficult they can become. They are a huge commitment, and a decision that cannot be taken lightly. <br>  <br>  You must be aware of your parrots caging needs, dietary needs, veterinary needs, and social needs. You must be absolutely sure that you can meet these needs BEFORE bringing your parrot home. Do your research, and you should be just fine. ^_^ <br>  <br>  Best of luck to you!|`|pH1Qz6lAaa	Hi, you should get a Quaker Parrot. I almost got one. They are about medium size. Sorry and no offense, but if you want a bird that goes outside without training your will loose your bird. I suggest a Quaker before getting an Eclectus because Ekkies are really hard to take care of because they need 80% of veggies for their diet because they have long intestines.  You have to train your bird to go outside, or put a harness on your bird. And a Quaker is the best medium sized talking bird. All large birds are harder to take care of than medium-small sized birds. I suggest you get a quaker before an ekkie.|`|YhH0PNupaa	A chicken!!|`|wrxd8M84aa	Cockatiel.|`|ner3pemNaa	It depends on your price range and what you want<br>  <br>  Best looking big bird Hyacinth Macaw very rare and around 12,000-30,000<br>  Most Playful bird- Cockatoos - $800-$2500<br>  Most talkative- African Greys<br>  Most funnies- Conures and Caiques.<br>  <br>  We have a cockatoo and he is very very playful and loves to come out and chase the dogs and scratch his head on peoples feet however he only says Its ok.

She's probably scared too.It's huge and strange and she's little and unfamiliar with the territory.You know she hates it.<br>  You should try spending your off time playing & relaxing in the back yard with her. Just being back there with her as much as possible would have to help.|`|AA12128656	well. first, life is all hunky dory for your dog. she lives in the house, where you live. then, all of a sudden, you move, and she's kicked out to the backyard all by herself. that's not as entertaining or stable for a dog as you might want to think. and of course she can't hold it for 8 hours while you're at work, she's a dachshund PUP.<br>  <br>  what you need to do is NOT leave the dog out all day alone. DO understand that some of her eliminating in the house is from boredom and having no one to let her out.  NEVER EVER leave a dog outside all by itself all day- NOT EVEN a big one, nevermind a little one that could be carried off by a hawk, or easily stolen!  gee.... isn't this nice... i'm in a crate, but now i have a better view? this isn't how a dog thinks. you took her safe place and put it outside.... not so safe anymore!<br>  <br>  you need to section off a room or two of the house for her, not let her have free run. if you want to make sure she can get out to potty, build a COVERED kennel with the dog door leading into the house. show her how to use it, and then she'll be more likely not to have to "go" in the house. otherwise, you'll either have to have someone come to let her out at lunchtime, or have a pee pad down. her bladder is about the size of a third of your fist. not so big...<br>  <br>  1. she's not "slow" to understand crate training, you're not doing it right.<br>  2. she is not going to get used to the backyard if you just throw her out there by herself, that's no fun! dogs want to be where their masters are!|`|ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	Of course she hates it out there.

No you stick to one method - you take her out when she goes you reward, you stay out there until she goes, you take her out after every meal after she has had a nap and after play.  You stick to it and be consistent.  You watch her all the time for signs she wants to go and you take her outside.<br>  <br>  Just chucking her out in the back yard is going to teach her nothing.  <br>  <br>  If you let her in the house as soon as you are home - how do you know all she does is sit and whine?<br>  <br>  EDIt  So stick with what you were doing - the move may well of upset her, crate her when you are not home that at least keeps the problem in one place.<br>  <br>  Try looking for a DAP diffuser to help her over her anxiety.  It could well be to do with her experience with her breeder - she may have been kept outside and is therefore afraid.<br>  <br>  I would never ever leave a dog outside of any breed.<br>  <br>  2 months really is nothing so please give her a chance and take her back into your home.  Time and patience will sort it.
D1beU6MPaa	I have a couple of dogs that do not get along. And from what you are saying you have already done the right thing. Separate them. I have a Pyrenees that is the alpha dog and we have to keep him completely away from the other dogs. If we didn't, we would  have a blood bath on our hands. This is not something that can be trained out of them, it is their instinct. You must continue to keep them separated. I know all to well how frustrating it can be, but I have had dogs all of my life and I can tell you that it is not going to ever be any better. Once they have the dominate attitude, it does not go away. Good luck to you, I am in the same boat with you.<br>  <br>  ADD: Neutering them may help, but I doubt it will cure the problem.|`|ZTaFYgwbaa	if they are not neutered they will fight to the death|`|P2yRAWiJaa	Sounds like your older dog may have had deep seated dog-aggression issues that were brought to the forefront when the young female arrived.

Have them drag their leashes around the house so that you can quickly stop any unwanted behavior.  <br>  <br>  Remember - dogs don't respect leaders who are frustrated or angry; they see that as a weakness.<br>  <br>  I agree that if the dogs are neutered the aggression should lessen.|`|pRxzPiSbaa	call the dog whisperer.|`|AA10878326	First of all, you need to get control of the rottie mix before it hurts someone.

The chemical stays in their brains for a few days, during which time, they are more likely to fight again.<br>  <br>  If you keep them penned up, you may need to set something up that prevents them from seeing each other.  I put a piece of plywood between my dogs' pens.  While in their pens, your dogs could be giving each other the evil eye, which will lead to a fight.<br>  <br>  They also say adding melatonin can help dissapate the chemical.  My dog weighs 27lbs and I give him 5 MG per day.  You might try 5 MG per meal.
EJpiaCMQaa	Female cockatiels can lay eggs with or without a male present.  Of course the egg will be unfertilized if there was no breeding.  It's not a problem for a pet bird to lay one egg, so don't get stressed about it.  The problem occurs when or if the bird becomes a chronic egg layer.  If this starts occuring, a visit to the vet is in order.  Otherwise, don't worry about it.  You and your cockatiel will be just fine.  I've had several female budgies during the years, and two of them produced eggs.  The first egg was never a problem.|`|l2kQZQkwaa	female birds lay eggs. don't get stressed. if it isn't fertilized, it will just sit on the bottom of the cage until you take it out.
UIM8X38Oaa	I have one like that.<br>  He eats everything in sight.<br>  <br>  You do need to stop him from doing the nibbling because it will eventually turn into biting.  When he turns his head towards you push it away and tell him no.  <br>  <br>  Make sure he is giving you your space when you are leading him make his stay behind you so he cannot nibble.<br>  <br>  Good Luck,<br>  Jenny|`|RloOJ43haa	You should not let your horse get his mouth on you in any way. The horse is not allowed to put is mouth on anything that isn't food. So, if you are letting him mouth your coat - stop. While you are walking around, he should be looking forward where he is going, not at you. Anytime he tries to get his mouth close to you, correct him with the lead rope. If he gets his lips to you, yell 'NO.' If that doesn't stop him, then put your fist or elbow up between you and him. You don not have to hit him, but he will hit himself if he tires to get you.|`|u1HahCoqaa	....I don't know about everyone else, but I have noticed that when horses do this they usually need salt. Give them a free choice salt block, and they usually stop.......Horses need salt, and usually just hay doesnt provide enough of it. Does he have a free choice salt block available?|`|gDh1t1Yyaa	It's a habit lmao.<br>  They probably think you've got a treat in your pocket. :) <br>  xxxxx|`|WxACyBbgaa	What the heck is wrong with DUDUDU ? have they lost their mind? LOL|`|xzJi0bcSaa	It sounds more like a behavior issue than your coat being good to eat. When your horse starts to nibble on you, give him a smack and say no in a firm voice. If you give treats, feed them in a pan rather than your hands for now. If you dont feel like giving him a smack, you can push his face away from your jacket. I would start this asap because nibbling can lead to biting and thats not good.<br>  <br>  Edit: I used to work in a place like that, when the horse reaches over to nibble, push his face away and say no. I used to work with the horses at the place I worked at so I could fix the problems with no rider and that might be something to bring up to the manager or whoever.|`|tWTJ4CSIaa	Your horse is being mouthy and rude.  I won't tolerate that kind of behaviour from my horses because it is disrespectful and simply rude.  You need to be very consistant in telling your horse that it is NOT OK to chew on you.  At some point he may even develop into biting at you, which becomes dangerous.  <br>  <br>  Every time he cheews on your clothing, push his head away and say NO very firmly.  If he comes back, push him away again and smack his chest.  Then ask him to back up.  What you need to do is remove him from your personal space and tell him NO.  You may have to do this 10 or 15 times before he gives up but if you are consistant, he will stop for good.  Every single time he gets mouthy, push him away, say NO, and smack his chest until he leaves you alone.  <br>  <br>  Also to prevent mouthy horses, only feed him treats when he is being polite, as soon as he is demanding, the treats go away. <br>  <br>  Good Luck and be consistant!|`|WPGU48Kuaa	You seem to have a serious respect issue here.  It has absolutely nothing to do with treats in your pocket, but that the horse is allowed to get in your space.  If this horse acted this way to his or her pasture buddies, he/she would get a warning, then discipline.  Respect on the ground and around your horses is an ABSOLUTE MUST to ensure your safety!  Look for Clinton Anderson's "Gaining Respect and Control on the Ground" DVD.  This is of utmost importance.  Do not let yourself get hurt!|`|Is26eHnVaa	do not let your horse get away with that. it will not hurt your horse if u bop them on the nose or jerk on the lead rope. this is a starting of a bad habit. you need to correct the horse every time this happens are it will continue to happen. <br>  <br>  i had a weanling that i thought was the cutest thing when he would nibble on my sleeve. When he got to be a 16.2 3 year old it was not cute anymore. i let the bad habit start and it got worse and worse. my trainer told be to smack him with the rope or bop him on the nose. after awhile of this he got the idea and he leave me alone.|`|BiUNuyfFaa	Check with the vet and dentist to make sure nothings wrong. <br>  <br>  I would get a stud chain. Put the chain on and instead of tying him/her up hold the lead line. Then when your horse turns to nibble or bite yank the chain and at the same time slap it on the muzzle. (slap the horse like you are slapping a babies bottom not hard enough to hurt but a good warning) However always reward good behavior.|`|j6NULSo6aa	lol my horse when im tacking him up sometimes if i put my hand infront of his mouth he licks it but not just once....he can go for hours just licking my hand|`|shKh9mnUaa	In my opinion it mite just be affection.|`|euFLT8eCaa	That makes two of us, I love the taste of a nice coat with some A1 sauce.|`|yY6Aj1xpaa	You need to keep your horse "out of your space"...by that I mean keep him away from you if you have him haltered.   If haltered, shake that lead rope at him, and back him out of your space.  Make him stay out of "your" area.....If he's out of your "area" he can't lick,  nuzzle or bite  you.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://gentlenaturalhorseman.blogspot.com/2009/01/clinton-anderson-video-clip-on-leading.html" rel="nofollow">http://gentlenaturalhorseman.blogspot.co...</a><br>  <br>  By the way, the Clinton Anderson method works......... I have a big AQHA gelding who would love to be a pocket pony if allowed....and I've used this method on him .. with good success.  Any treats given to your horse should be placed in a feeder....never give a treat to your horse with just your hand. Will only encourage him to want to nuzzle you.  <br>  <br>  Since these aren't your horses, other handlers are creating the problem of allowing these horses to  nuzzle and mouth coat sleeves.  I'm not one to ever encourage striking a horse in the face or muzzle for nuzzling and mouthing coats and sleeves.  I just don't allow them into "my" space in the first place. Can you imagine trying to show a halter horse and having it trying to mouth your shirt sleeve or jacket?  Best not to allow this to happen in the first place!!     <br>  <br>  Geez, the trolls are upset...check the thumbs down; poor deprived children.|`|XXPgh3FTaa	it sounds like you fed your horsey to many hand treats.... bad idea..<br>  <br>  Feeding your horse from your palm may be fun but it can create bad biting which can turn into a horror to settle.  Anything from palm feeding to simply rubbign its nose can give the horse a bad idea.  I use to do it and i paid for it when my horse nibbled on me and even bit pretty hard.<br>  <br>  Make sure he knows he is in your space, your the leader in the herd.  Make sure you push him away as many times as it takes for him to get the picture, don't hit him though maybe a quick jab with your elbow when your leading him but don't hit him.
XTlJROHdaa	I have four male rabbits, and three of them spray.  Usually, males housed where there are no other rabbits do not spray as much because they do not feel the need to mark their territory.  Neutering is not a bad idea, but do be aware of the anesthesia risks with rabbits.  Given a big enough cage and no "competition," it is likely that he will not spray outside of the cage even if he is not neutered.  If he is going to spray, they usually start around 6-8 months--probably closer to six months in a smaller breed like the lionhead.|`|nNGrfHdTaa	Ive got a 2 year old Male rabbit,<br>  He started spraying at around The 2 year Mark,<br>  But We got Him neutered  And The problem vanished =]|`|HlOxEvwDaa	well i came across a bird who pooped on me... dose that count??|`|xJ0HJKlXaa	almost all male rabbits i know spray. mine doesn't though :) so, probably like, 9 out of 10 will spray. i think you can try to avoid spraying by playing with him a lot as a baby, and mabey by keeping him near female rabbits. i think that was part of the reason mine never sprayed.  they usually start spraying after about 6 months of age.|`|kYAIt9fzaa	male rabbits that are not neutered will most likely spray urine. they can't help it, it's their hormones that want them to mark their territory.  Neutering really is the best thing that you can do for your pet rabbit. take a look at www.rabbit.org....
FJjBHjcWaa	Solution 1:<br>  I'm not judging anyone, but heres an idea. Talk to your fiance about understanding that you love your dog and if you two are going to be together for the rest of your lives, he/she should learn to accept that as a fact and not flip out when you want to spend time with her.<br>  Solution 2: <br>  If you know that your dog is constantly craving attention, then you can probably guess that she won't be happy in a basement all the time with limited human interaction. Dogs CAN get depressed, and you should take her mental health into consideration. If a few chew toys and blankets is going to be her new family, maybe you should consider finding a more fitting family who will love her and give her all the attention she wants, maybe even one with kids ( depending on your chihuahua's personality ). I know it's hard to give a pet you love and consider part of the family to a new group of strangers, or friends, but if it's what's best for her, it needs to be an option.<br>  Solution 3: <br>  Get her a buddy! Dogs don't mind being left alone all day AS MUCH if they have a cell mate (haha). I used to have to lock up my dog Boon in a pen all day while I was at school and he was so sad all the time. I then had to dogsit my best friends pug for a week, and she stayed in the pen with him. They hit it off in no time! He was so happy after that! My friend later gave me that pug, Taco, and they are an inseparable bunch out there in that pen. If you're afraid of breeding, buy another girl, or have a boy fixed. Depending on your dog's personality, she might enjoy a friend, and, who knows. You might fall in love with another dog!|`|jyGTlpzTaa	Dogs are pack animals that require company, either in the form of humans or in the form of other dogs. What you are doing is cruel.|`|IcH5gMICaa	Tell your fiance you had the dog before you met him and the dog stays and as long as you are paying the rent and taking care of the dog, he should love you and accept that the dog is your companion and you don't want to give her away.  That's what I did.<br>  <br>  Only I was a bit harder about it.  I paid all the rent and he complained about my weenie dog and I said, "The dog stays or you complain and you go.  I've had the dog longer and I know she's loyal to me no matter what"  Take That!|`|6gshK9A1aa	get a crate for her, make her sleep in there at night and whenever you go to work. put it in the house and train her so she just goes to sleep.|`|SccU9zdNaa	Not to sound harsh, since i don't know your fiance, but if he is going to be that cruel to animals and all, how is he going to treat you, or the things you love?<br>  <br>  But since you will probably decide to keep him, my opinion is you should probably try to find him a good home. If the dog is going to be kept in a basement, you might as well put him into a puppy farm. Its not fair that just because your man doesn't like him that the dog should be punished. He will be much happier in a new house with peoples attention/love/ and places to move. he isn't going to be happy stuck in a cold dark room by himself.<br>  It maybe difficult to think about giving her up, but just think about how happier she would be, and try putting yourself in her place. It would be much more loving and compassionate to make sure that she will be as happy as possible. and that won't be in a basement.<br>  <br>  It sounds like a hard dilemma. try talking to your man about it. good luck with her, your future, and your baby!|`|f06Sy0dfaa	You need to have a talk with your fiance and come to an agreement, locking a chihuahua up in a basement is mean. Chihuahuas are very sociable creatures. I have one myself. I don't think you should get rid of her, that with her being your first pet ever, and that you've had her so long... Stand your ground and say your NOT getting rid of her. Most guys will eventually give up. You can put her in the bathroom with a baby gate so she could see you guys. I do that with mine until I get home from work, then I take her out and play with her until it's bed time. She sleeps with me... now about where she sleeps, maybe get her a little dog bed. Even my little chihuahua, if I decide not to let her on my bed, she goes to find my pile of clothes, and sleeps on them. So, try discussing and coming to an agreement about where to put her for the time being. :)|`|otsuH97Jaa	Honestly hearing a story like that breaks my heart. Keeping a dog in the basement is just awful. You should have never had a dog if you knew it was possible that you'd be moving into a new house in which your fiance wouldn't want it around. The dog is a living creature and shouldn't be confined to a lonely area. Dogs don't ever just sit and play with toys alone, especially small dogs. If you have any heart you'd adopt the dog out to another family. If your child made a mess would you lock IT downstairs? No. I doubt it. Give it a home where someone will actually love it. And think a big decision like that through next time.|`|YjbIBsCmaa	I think that is too much time alone..in the basement. Have you considered buying a pet gate and just blocking off portions of the house? Your fiance seems mean, why would you have a pet if you locked them in the basement all the time. What's the reasoning for that?|`|ZmejnqrYaa	My opinion and I am married and my wife has a little dog too and I don't care if her dog runs out and about. <br>  <br>  1) Does your dog pee and poop everywhere when let out? If the answer is yes then I would suggest that you keep it in the basement or get rid of it or try to train your dog not to do that mess. If your answer is no then I don't see a problem with your dog being able to be out whenever you are home and at night when you guys are sleeping. If you ask me your fiance is just being a jerk on this matter.<br>  <br>  2) And this is my opinion and my opinion only. If you feel like the dog is causing trouble in your relationship because your dog is just a terrible pet because he/she pees all over the place and rips everything up and you don't have enough time to train him/her then I would give him up but if that is not the case then I see it as your fiance as being a jerk and trying to be controlling or it could be that your fiance is just a little bit nervous about letting your dog wonder around because he is worried about it messing up the house. Which is understandable but you could try and show your fiance that your dog will not mess up the house. Maybe then he will be cool with him roaming around the house.
RFM2Cb1Zaa	1.) I would say talk quietly and if you know the horse put your hand on the hindquarters and walk a small circle round them so they know your there, otherwise go a safe distance away.<br>  2.)

I do not want to be kicked! Let the Horse Know where you are alt all times! Keep in physical contact with your horse unless you getting him out of pasture. A hand on the back on the withers and to the side of the flank is most reassuring in my own experience. I do not think I would ever walk directly behind a horse but I would stand at the flank.<br>  <br>  2 This depends on the horse. An old morgan i use to own would buddy up with another horse in pasture . When turned out alone he was always happier but often with other horses he would get with another horse and be friends . If he saw that horse out he would nicker at him or follow it if in another pasture but I really kept this horse in his own pasture because he felt more secure and was easier to catch.<br>  <br>  3  I have seen  do all of the last  three from time to time . Cribbing is the worse to deal with and snapping at folks who come to visit. This has an easy remedy. Put a plastic milk bottle hung from a string above his head and let him butt it around. Also if you keep your horse stalled all the time be sure to  spend several hours a day with the horse . If you can't do this then give it up. It is kinder !
5TM9P8tsaa	*When my husband and I first got married and moved into our new home, we had a mommy skunk who was raising her own one baby kitten, and a baby skunk. The neighbors told us that the mommy cat lost all her kittens but one, and the mother skunk got killed so she took in the baby skunk. We let them live under the house till full grown. A farmer told us to place moth balls under the house. They can not smell themselves and leaves. IT did the trick. Now I live out in the country and have one living under my shed. I leave him a bowl of cat food. Every morning the little guy comes out and eats and drinks. He returns every morning. I can always smell him under there. The smell is not bothering me anymore. IT is bad when he gets spooked and sprays outside.

I've never been sprayed, but I don't move them far before opening the cage and releasing them.<br>   <br>  I'd definitely consider the valium both inhumane and risky for YOU. Human medications given to animals may have unpredictable effects, and getting the dosage right is problematical. For Example, Travis the chimp who bit the woman's face off recently was agitated, so his owner gave him a cup of tea with Xanax in it. Coincidence?

I would recommend proffessinally having them removed.|`|r9KPc4ghaa	Some may deem this as inhumane, but it really is a safe way to get the skunk out without getting sprayed.  Set a live trap and get a can of cat food and crush up a valium and mix it in.  Check the trap often until you catch the skunk and it has been sedated.

Some keep their longer outer coat but they will shed the under coat yearly or bi-annually;  Any long coat dog will require grooming-- Short coated dogs shed more than long hair dogs  but are a "wash and go" type dog--so keep this in mind as You look at different breeds.<br>  <br>  A good diet and a brushing once or twice  a week is usually enough to prevent excessive shedding.<br>  <br>  Next look at activity levels--is your grandmother active? Does she like to take walks?  Can she see well and move(walk) easily?  A very active puppy may not be good for an older person who has limited mobility.  <br>  <br>  Consider adopting and adult dog --one that is neutered/spayed and maybe already house broke.  Many breed rescue have lots of wonderful older dogs looking for homes.  Sometimes the best dog possible many be waiting in your local animal shelter.<br>  <br>  Personally, I like Pugs, Standard Dachshunds, and Toy Fox terriers as smaller house dogs if you want short hair and no grooming. Pomeranian and Havenese are great little house dogs if you can keep them groomed and not let them mat.<br>  <br>  I bought a toy fox terrier for my grandmother and for almost 11 years they kept each other active and on a daily schedule.  I own one  myself (Jerry Lee) and he is the light of our lives.  They are small (usually under 6 lbs ) smart, people oriented little dogs. They are great little watchdogs and the perfect size to ride in your shopping cart!  They can be very active--so some ball throwing and fetching may be necessary!|`|C5YBD3F1aa	Rat Terriers are small, active, intelligent dogs that don't shed much.

It is always better to get a female but she would have to be spade.  <br>  All short haired dogs shed hair and some a lot of hair.  We had toy poodles while growing up and they do not shed their hair at all. They also are very smart dogs and are easy to train.  I had a peek-a-poodle with mostly poodle in her and she was a very loving, quiet, easy to train pet and did not shed since she had more poodle in her. She also was an all white dog and stayed clean longer then a lot of pets do.<br>  All dogs have maintenance, like having to groom them and take them to the vet and house break them.  They all need to be bathed at least every two weeks.  The nice thing about a white poodle is that they do not have the doggie order like a lot of dogs will get when they are not bathed often. And.. if you have any allergies then the poodle is the dog for you.  <br>  Any pet you get try to make sure they have pink skin and not dark skin.  They tend to have more doggie odor when they are dark skinned.  And.. try to get a female because they are easier to train.  I would say a toy poodle would be your best bet, but the yorkie does not shed much, but they do tend to have eye problems and anise problems. <br>  If you do not want to spend a lot of money then I would say a peek-a-poodle is the way to go.  Just make sure the dog has the poodle fur.|`|rsTLGYaZaa	A good small dog would probably be a papillon although they bark when they get alarmed.  They love people.  Also a welsh corgi.

They are super intelligent, but maybe not for someone who is looking for a low-maintenance pet.  Shelters often have mixed breeds who are exactly what you are looking for.  Take your grandmother to your local shelter and let her look at the small dogs.  Sometimes they even have purebreds up for adoption.
rsTLGYaZaa	First you place your hand on his back and grab the excessive amount of skin that a mother bunny uses to pick them up by the scruff.

You never know and it may make your case stronger!If you can prove they did it, I would go after getting them to be responsible for paying all the vet bills, Animal Abuse, and see if there is anything else you can charge them for.

In some areas the laws regarding dogs are tighter but everywhere in the us it would be considered destruction of property.|`|HgMFrllLaa	I wasn't gonna respond to this and had erased several of my very emotionaly charged answers.<br>  Anyway, personally I'd hire the BEST lawyer I could afford and sue them for their fvcking kids.

Take pictures of your dog, take pictures of the fence, take pictures of the area the fluid landed, take pictures where the dog vomited, take pictures of the bottle, take pictures of anything that has to do with the incident because without proof you're no different than a person begging for money on the street.  Go to the hospital and get as much paperwork as possible on the treatment of your dog including bills.  If it's not too late, file a police report against your neighbour if you don't fear any retaliation.  The more proof you have on your side the stronger your case will be in the court of law.  Make haste not waste.|`|mnufOa6eaa	Where do you live? Depending on where you live you can take them to court as what they did is animal abuse. They knowing tried to harm your dog.<br>  <br>  Some countries have strong laws for animal abuse, some don't. Some states have laws, some don't. I'd say talk to a lawyer or attorney and see what they say. But I think you'd have a case.|`|ZLS6NBQLaa	I'm no law expert, but you should probably talk to a lawyer or a friend with some knowledge of how to deal with this. This is blatant animal cruelty.

If you have the bottle, you are almost 100% sure to get a conviction.  Yes, you should take them to court and you will win if you can prove it.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	Not sure - you might want to seek legal counsel to see if you have enough to take them to court.  Most would say unless you saw the neighbor throw the bottle of antifreeze in your yard and it got all over the dog and made him sick, you cannot say for sure they were the ones to do it.<br>  <br>  Unless you would test the bottle for fingerprints and match it to them.|`|bIaywrBCaa	What the neighbors did is animal cruelty.

Documentation is key in situations like this.  Also keep all documentation from the vet (bills, vet notes, pictures....).<br>  <br>  Then, if you can prove that it was your neighbors that did it (I hope you still have the bottle as evidence), then you have a good case.<br>  <br>  *My parents had neighbors like this (actually, they are STILL neighbors).  About 20 years ago, they went outside one morning to find their Dalmatian laying on the ground.  They rushed him to the vet to find that both his front legs had been severely broken.  They had to have him put down it was so bad.  The vet said there was no way that this happened naturally.  He suspected someone beat the dog with a baseball bat or tire iron.  We just KNEW it was the neighbor (for lots of reasons).  We filed a police report and wanted to sue him, but unfortunately, we had no proof that he did it.  Just assumptions.  To this day, we still believe he did it.  We just can't prove it.
jyGTlpzTaa	You will find websites more reliable than individuals, people will give you answers on here that are often quite wrong.<br>  <br>  Degus are not smelly animals, no.<br>  <br>  YES they need dust baths, sand costs about ￡1.20 a bag and will last you ages, any shallow tray (not plastic) will do as a bath. You can buy chinchilla dust in pet shops, do NOT buy bird sand or any other sort of dust or sand.<br>  <br>  Any animal can bite, if that is what you are getting at. With handling degus will not bite but often they dont become very tame.<br>  <br>  Degus should be kept in the company of other degus.<br>  <br>  Yes, they stay up at night.<br>  <br>  No, you cannot feed them kale, they evolved to eat a very frugal diet and kale will make them ill.|`|VOIs9Kxqaa	they themselves dont smell, but their waste does so you'd have to clean it every 4 days or so. But other then that, no they don't have body odour like a ferret or a sugar glider. <br>  they don't NEED dust baths but they enjoy them. You can buy the sand at basically any petstore( if they don't have it, just ask them if they can order it for you). They're not really cuddly but they do like to come out and run around. I can't stress this one enough though, its IMPORTANT that you have atleast 2! I usually reccommend 3 incase one gets sick they'res still two to keep eachother company and its less stressful then introducing a new one. Theyre pretty flexiable on when they're up, but I've noticed dawn and dusk seem to be they're prime hours.<br>  not too sure about the Kale.
L0mVDp5Yaa	Degus are very social animals and can become very tame if handled from an early age. However, they do best if kept with other degus because of their social nature. They are playful and curious. Without social interaction and opportunity for exercise, they can be aggressive and neurotic. Degus are diurnal (active during the day<br>  <br>  Degus should have a solid surface exercise wheel (11 inches is a good size) in their cage. Thick branches can be added to the cage and will offer both exercise (climbing) and chewing opportunities. Thick cotton ropes can also be used for climbing toys. Using heavy ceramic dishes is a good idea (chew proof), and a water bottle with a sipper tube can be used for water. You may need to get a chew guard for the water bottle.<br>  <br>  Like chinchillas, degus need regular dust baths to keep their skin and coat in good condition. Provide a shallow bowl with an inch or two of chinchilla bath dust (sand) a couple of times a week (leave in the cage for a half hour or so).<br>  <br>  Since degus are such determined chewers, it is vital to provide them with lots of opportunities to chew. A variety of wood blocks and chews as well as branches can be provided. Willow balls and toys made for rabbits are great for degus, and cotton rope and wood toys designed for large parrots are also a good choice. A mineral or salt block designed for rodents can be attached to the cage<br>  <br>  Body is about 5-7 inches long; the tail is another 5-6 inches.

It's a good sign that he is still eating, so I wouldn't worry about going to the vet immediatley. His little body is trying to recover from the eye infection, and just like humans the body's recovery process requires alot of sleep and liquids. He might also be a little dehydrated, which would be the reason for only peeing once today. If he isn't drinking water regularly you can get some in a dropper and squeeze some into the side of his mouth. Make sure his head is up if you do this to avoid choking. I think it will be ok to wait and see how he feels in the morning.

2CbfO4jWaa	advice for breeding rats for snake food.......................DONT DO IT!hahahahaha f@#kers STINK!|`|XTDeAfTqaa	A 30 gallon tank will be fine. You'll need cedar chips and a water bottle. They'll eat just about anything but keep them well fed or they may eat their young.<br>  All you need is a Male and a Female and you are good to go!|`|Q4pUDkyHaa	I need to know how many snakes you have, what size they are, and how many snakes you're going to get, and how big they will be.<br>  Also, are you going to breed the snakes?<br>  Anyway, if you got snakes that are big enough to eat day old rats, I recommend doing rats rather than mice, as mice tend to stink, and are more trouble than they're worth, unless you need the tiny babies for hatchling snakes. <br>  I recommend getting 2 related males that have been raised together, and keep them in a big tank. Put a female rat in there until she shows some swelling in the belly (2-2 1/2 weeks), then put her in a 10 gallon tank of her own with her own food and water. She will start nesting and during this period she really needs to be alone.<br>  When she 'pops' the litter will usually be around 10 babies. (usually more, but plan on 10.)<br>  Feed what you need and put the rest in the freezer, don't get overrun.<br>  When you took her out of the big tank, you just add another female to the tank with the males in it, and she will be preggo by now.<br>  I do 6 females and 2 males to a 55 gallon tank, and when they show signs I move them to their own 10 gallon tank. (Yes, I have six 10 gallon tanks.)<br>  I keep them in groups of 6.<br>  I have 26 rats. 2 males, and 24 females.<br>  I have 10 tanks in all, six 10 gallon tanks, 1 'swap' tank to keep critters in while I'm switching tanks (It's a 20L or 29, can't remember which.), and three 55 gallon tanks.<br>  The 6 tanks are for mommies with babies.<br>  The 55s are a breeder tank, a holding area, and a vacation tank.<br>  The breeder tank has the 2 males in it. Most people recommend 1 male to a tank, but I use 2 because at some point the tank will be empty, and it's not good for males to be left alone too long, they get aggressive.<br>  The vacation tank is where the mommies go after they are done in the 10 gallon tanks.<br>  They stay in there 1 cycle-2 1/2 -3 weeks.<br>  Then they go to the holding area, you can keep females in here longer than that if you get too many babies, or if you need more babies, you can move them up to the breeding cage faster.<br>  This is called cycle breeding and it sounds like a lot of work, but it's the easiest way to get a consistent number of babies in a given week or month.<br>  This gets me 60 babies every 30 days. This may be overkill for you, adjust the number of females so you get the amount of babies you need. Get a nice big holder tank, and you can speed up or slow down as you see fit. If you try to run cycles over 3 weeks you'll crash and have more than 6 litters. You can foster off some babies, and put the right sized ones in the freezer. Some females work in pairs, raising each others babies, but not all rats will do this, they really do much better on their own. remember, 2 1/2 weeks in the breeder cage, and the females need their own space.

fFzfPqjBaa	Bury it.|`|pDPSaL37aa	I'm sorry to hear about this. Put on some rubber/latex gloves or use a plastic bag and take it out. Then clean the nest thoroughly before putting it back into the cage. It's not healthy for your other birds to be around a dead carcass. After you've done that, it's up to you whether you want to bury it in your backyard or just throw it away. If there are other eggs in there, pick them up and hold them up to the light. If you see a red vein going through it, it's fertile and will probably hatch. If not, throw it away or else the parents will be laying on it nonstop and the mother will most likely become weak from not leaving the nest to eat and drink. There are different foods to give to breeding birds. You should look into it if you want future chicks to be healthy.|`|BG0z9rYOaa	I have bred finches so assume my info may help.  I also had a dead chick so I waited until night when it was dark and quiet.  The hen left the nest as I put my hand in the cage and I used tweezers to remove the dead chick.  Leave all other eggs well alone and she should return.  Hope this helps.

Is26eHnVaa	there is nothing against turning out in a blanket if the weather is not wet. but it will more than likely get muddy and torn. they do make turn-out blankets. i suggest getting one of those. I use them for my show horses. they are a bit more durable than your normal stall blanket.|`|RloOJ43haa	Only if your stable blanket has leg straps so that it stays in place if she rolls.|`|ZB0VuKh8aa	It shouldn't be a problem as long as she doesn't get wet! After my mare had ripped her second turnout rug to bits this winter, I had no alternative but to turn her out in her stable rug. Fortunately I also had a waterproof sheet so I put this on top if the weather was wet. Has worked out fine.|`|zc0qQHmXaa	If the mare goes out alone, or with a buddy that is in no way destructive, I don't see why not.  However, if she's hard on her blankets at all (biting at them, rolling on rocks, etc) It will tear in a second.  But even if you went to a local tack shop and bought a cheap-o blanket, the denier would probably be the same.<br>  (Stable blankets are usually 600D, same as the cheapest turnouts)|`|FtEkredUaa	Don't use a stable rug for turnout. <br>  My horse gets the rubbing as well so i put a stretch vest underneath her rug which you can get from the tack shops. They are very cheap to buy and easy to put on. Its a cheaper way instead of buying a new turnout rug. Also on your rug maybe try loosing it? But i find the stretch vest very good :)|`|gDh1t1Yyaa	I used to put a stable blanket underneath my horses rainmac. It prevented rubbing, and it kept him nice and snug :)<br>  xxx|`|j6NULSo6aa	right|`|BiUNuyfFaa	I wouldn't. You should go to a horse thrift shop and get a cheap turnout blanket.|`|WPGU48Kuaa	Most horses do not require blankets to keep warm and more often than not, they do more harm then good.  The horses natural coat wi meant to protect from rain, snow and even wind.  Rubbing is a concern with blankets for sure.  If you do not turn them out in bad weather, a blanket is not helping at all.....your horse is out of rain, snow and wind.  However, if you must blanket, a stable blanket is prone to tearing much easier than a turnout blanket and it's better to be safe than sorry when it comes to the weather.....you don't want your horse to stand in a wet blankie do you? :-)

jyGTlpzTaa	What do you mean by mean? If you mean, do they bite, then yes, they bite. It can take a long time to train ferrets out of biting, they can be very stubborn little creatures...one of my three 9 month ferrets still bites on occasion.<br>  <br>  And yes, ferrets are hard to care for. They are expensive to keep and buy...the caging and toys are expensive and they need vaccination, spaying is necessary to keep health problems at bay in females. As they get older they cost a fortune to treat at the vet, I just spent ￡70 for my lot ($140) the other day in ROUTINE vet care. Emergency vet care can cost many ￡1000's. Whilst this doesnt mean you have to be loaded to keep them, it can mean making many sacrifices for their sake. Ferrest are accident prone, figure on paying out a big vet bill at some point.<br>  <br>  They will also take up about four and a half hours a day of your time, four for playing with them and letting them roam about (this is NECESSARY for their mental well being), and a half hour cleaning up after them. They need a lot of training, litter training, anti bite training, to come when called, and as I said ferret training takes a long time.<br>  <br>  Also, you shouldnt get ONE ferret, they need the company of other ferrets, so two or more is a must.|`|2fdee6b1fd597a29209ecfad9dc8b598aa	Ferrets are only truly aggressive when they have had an abusive or neglectful owner.<br>  Ferrets are very high maintenance pets, so if you are looking for an easy pet (those are few and far between, though), ferrets are definitely not for you.<br>  Some basics (by no stretch does this cover everything you need to know.  Research on your own is always very important, and should be done before *and* after getting any pet):<br>  Ferrets need a diet high in meat protein and fat (this is where they get their energy).  Raw and natural diets are best, but good kibbles can be found here: <a href="http://www.mdferretpaws.org/care/food_treats.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mdferretpaws.org/care/food_tr...</a><br>  They need spacious multi-level cages (Martin's cages and Ferret Nation models are the only ones I recommend)<br>  They do best with 2 or more (3, in my experience, is the best ferret number).<br>  They need a lot of mental stimulation.  These guys are smart and can get bored easily.<br>  They need a lot of out of cage time.  The rough guidelines are 6 hours for one ferret, and 4 hours for two or more.  However, that last, in my opinion, is much too low.<br>  The cage and play are should be cleaned *at least* once a day.  Twice is better.  Ferret laundry should be done weekly.  Ferret baths should be infrequent (at most every 3-4 months).<br>  Two good litters are Yesterday's News and CareFresh Ultra-White.<br>  Toys can be cheap things you find around the house.  Just make sure they have no small/dangling pieces, that they aren't made from rubber, soft plastic or foam, and that they have no small holes in which the ferret could get its head stuck and choke or rupture its esophageous.<br>  They need a ferret savvy vet (on a schedule similar to dogs and cats, barring emergencies)<br>  You also should be familiar with symptoms for common diseases/ailments.<br>  Nail trimming and ear cleaning should be done once a week or every two weeks depending on the fert.  Take this time to check for signs of illness or abnormalities.<br>  To discipline: scruff (grasp the loose, thick skin above the shoulderblades), hiss (long, low 'heh sound), give a light shake, and then say no.  To restrain, simply scruff.|`|q0rLBQo2aa	NO ferrets! My son did the ferret thing as a teen, and even though he is now a grown man who makes his living running a private zoo and exotic animal business, he won't keep or deal in ferrets. Cobras, yes. Ferrets, no.|`|e9d744730c1945534ece9c6d73f61f0eaa	I think they are great pets. They have a musky smell to them, but you can put stuff in their water that helps with that smell. Also if you were to bathe them often, the smell wouldn't be as bad.<br>  <br>  We used to have 2 ferrets. Ours were very playful and fun. One liked being held and pet more than the other, but both were very nice. Neither of ours would bite to be mean. The online time I was ever bit by them was when they would be playing and they would kinda nip at you.<br>  <br>  Ferrets are like little cats. I like them MUCH better though. I heard that if you are allergic to cats, that you will be allergic to ferrets. Ferrets are usually pretty clean meaning that they will naturally defecate in the same place, and usually in a corner kind of out of the way, which is good for cleaning the cage.<br>  <br>  Just make sure they have water and a bowl of food and they will do just fine.|`|mL0BjDQWaa	Hii okay with ferrets the thing is once you have had one you will always want more. They can be a complete pain and you have got to be strong kind of thing with them. If you get scared when they bit you of pull your hand away it will hurt more and they wont learn but if from the start you blow there faces and say "NO" when they do it they will be fine i trained my second ferrets with in weeks using this method. <br>  The smell... well at first they stink and the smell is a really weird smell but after a couple of weeks you get use to the smell but i would still reccomend using a ferret deodrant or small animal one. It keeps the smell down and other people wont smell it.<br>  Litter training- i would reccomend it so things dont get messy. If you litter train them in a hutch or whatever just clean the litter tray everyday and refill it with cat litter or something simular. <br>  dont disinfect it though because if you do your ferrets will stop using the tray. <br>  If you want them to live outside i would reccomend getting two or some ferrets and filling there cage with toys and warm bedding. If they are inside it is easier if there are two ferrets because they are less hard work but harded to nip train. <br>  You have to get them out for at least 2 hours a day its only fair. in this time play with them like chacing games and like tug or war and things. <br>  Ferrets are great pets just make sure you get them from some one who hasnt been using them for working if they have it is really hard to train them. They arent really that expensive but can become ill so keep some money a side just in case. My ferrets costs me about ￡10 a month and thats for toys, litter and food.<br>  Hope this helps :) xx|`|nNGrfHdTaa	Hello x<br>  <br>  I would STRONGLY advise You Doin some proper Research Into ferrets,<br>  But If u are a 1st time pet owner i wouldnt recomend A ferret.<br>  But if You are experienced in Rodents them Ferrets are very Freindly animals,<br>  They can be hard to care for But As i said i would Research Alot more before Considering buying one,<br>  xxx|`|bttrB0Rfaa	<a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=ferret">http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=ferret</a><br>  <br>  this link is to a search page full of Ferret sites.<br>  <br>  the couple I've known (friends pets) were really sweet & fun.|`|9PQRHwnaaa	yes u should get a ferret bu my dad said he new a girl and he walked into her house and it smelled so bad because she had one|`|SpcYCBndaa	nope|`|F3LBgfvwaa	Some are mean so you need to buy from a reputable place (like a shelter) where the ferrets are socialized and trained. Ferrets are much more high maintenance than other animals. They are messy and need a lot of attention and they are more expensive and they are prone to certain illnesses. Do a lot of research before you get one.

But i am positive that they will be able to!|`|TqslFEwQaa	yes because mi9ce are rodents and i have a hamster and it crack seeds open on its own|`|g0Zz2vf1aa	I do believe so.
stCyrS4Eaa	Stop asking all these questions. Everything should have been asked before you bred them. This is showing your irresponsibility. This is why there are so many dogs in shelters. Do you have appointments for their dew claws, shots, etc.?|`|ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	You allowed your b*tch to have pups, therefore you are a breeder - just not a good one, but rather an irresponsible and unknowledgable backyard breeder.|`|bPdqwkpPaa	If you bred your dogs, that makes you a Backyard Breeder.  They are responsible for OVER 50% of the dogs in shelters.<br>  <br>  I don't know what else you want us to say.  You called us cruel for telling you the truth and you keep denying you are a breeder.  You can't spell "weaning" correctly, even though you've been corrected numerous times now.  <br>  <br>  Perhaps rather than trying to convince everyone that you aren't a breeder (even though it's obvious you are), you should be asking us how to get a mentor.  <br>  <br>  Tell you what, I'll answer it now.  <a href="http://www.pugs.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.pugs.org</a>  Find a responsible breeder on there.  E-mail her, tell her you messed up and bred your dog without thinking, and that you need her help. Have her walk you through the next steps and have her help you write a sales contract witha return clause and spay/neuter requirements.  Then, get your dog fixed.|`|KxjUim7yaa	I used to show and breed Pugs. They really are like other dogs. I used to start feeding canned food at 4 weeks, or when they started getting teeth. I also used Esbilac with some Gerber baby rice cereal as a soupy mush. I didn't use much to start. I offered it twice a day . As the mom weaned them I increased to 3 times a day, and at weaning to 4 times a day. They get very messy with the mush. You have to wipe them clear with a warm washcloth. The handling also helps with socialization. They get familiar with being picked up. The mom will decide the weaning time.|`|P2yRAWiJaa	If you have a litter, you are a breeder. From the sound of it you are a poor breeder (byb).  You know nothing about the breed. They aren't that "different" from other dogs either. At 4 weeks you can start giving soft food in addition to mothers milk. By 6 weeks they should be fully weaned and only eating solid food mixed with soft.<br>  <br>  Apparently your "friend" didn't help you to much. I hope you only sell these pups for the price of their vaccines.|`|Bw18seFqaa	if you bred your dog once, that makes you a breeder..   not having a mentor or doing research before hand makes you a back yard breeder.<br>  <br>  They are NOT different from other breeds of dogs..  they should have begun weaning about a week or so ago..  start giving them puppy mush..  soak some kibbles in warm water, then mush them up..  offer this to the pups a few times a day in a shallow bowl.<br>  <br>  You will gradually increase the texture of the foods.. soaked, but not mushed kibble, then only slightly soaked.. and eventually offering hard puppy kibbles.|`|MSKS4h1Iaa	You claim not to be a breeder, and yet you bred your dog? Guess what that makes you? And a very irresponsible one at that. <br>  <br>  Before carelessly breeding your pet quality pug, you should have done every bit of research on it, years in advance. You should have gained a mentor, done health testing on your b.tch, shown her to her championship, and had all knowledge you could have before breeding. <br>  <br>  I don't understand your question. Pugs are different than other dogs? Of course they are; they're their own breed. <br>  <br>  Or your pugs are different from other pugs? If so, you should not have bred since they don't fit the pug standard.
AA11992723	I agree, theres no way you could get a puppy OR adult to be 10 hours in a crate (6 hours every day is maximum with proper exercise before and after crating), unless perhaps it is a senior dog but even seniors need special care for issues like urine incontinence, arthritis (so they can't be cramped up), etc.<br>  <br>  So therefore no dog can be right for your situation UNLESS you took the dog to dog daycare a few times a week AND for the other days hired a dog walker for at least 1 hour walk.<br>  <br>  How would you and your husband even have the energy after a 10 hour work day? Would you be willing to play/walk your puppy before and after work? Even with a dog walker, that dog is going to be itching for stimulation, for something for his mind and body, and if not given it, he will be destructive, aloof, neurotic and even aggressive. Not to mention physically, a dogs bladder esp a puppy can not be forced to hold it so long or it will lead to bladder infections and kidney disease(which has no cure)<br>  <br>  <br>  p.s. I think a cat or two (for company) would not be a bad idea if you and your husband are looking for a companion who will snuggle with you before/after work and make you laugh with cute antics, and occationally want to play. There are so many cats in shelters, that have every and any temperment and age you could ask for. might be something you would want to look into. Cats are independent compared to dogs true, but that doens't mean they are less affectionate, it just means that some will refuse to learn tricks or obey your commands.|`|F27az9NEaa	Leaving a pup in a cage for 10 hours every day is not a good idea; if you have someone come in everyday and socialize, take the pup out for a potty break, and exercise with the pup-that may be different. But I wouldn't suggest it.<br>  Perhaps get an older cat?<br>  Puppies require lots of time and training, which if you do not have, will be unfair to both you and the dog. Especially beagles. They are an energetic breed that likes to be with their family and needs proper mental and physical stimuli or they may become destructive.<br>  I would either look into an older dog, an older cat, or not getting a pet at all. They need/deserve your time, and if you and your husband are too busy, it may just be best to opt out and wait for better timing.|`|49ec8e0944023c0f5c20e37484f16366aa	Unless you have a week or two of vacation time when the puppy first comes home, maybe not.  It's important to get him settled in & on a schedule, & to make time for socialization & training.   An 8 week old puppy has little bladder/bowel control the first few weeks, they usually need to go out every few hours to make housetraining successful.  10 hours in a crate for a puppy is too long, someone would have to let him out at least once or twice during that time for potty breaks.|`|5rfnEQnGaa	This is way too long to leave a young puppy shut in a crate. Try getting an older, less energetic dog., Beagles are not sedate so perhaps a rescue or another more sedate breed.  ALso see if a neighbour or good friend can go in and take the dog out mid-day, or employ a dog walker.|`|KxjUim7yaa	No dog should be in a cage 10 hours. 5 hours is the limit. A puppy need to potty ever 1-2 hours. I don't think a puppy is right for you.|`|P2yRAWiJaa	If someone can come home a few times during the day to play with the pup and let him go potty I'd say go for it. :)<br>  <br>  There are dog sitters, walkers and boarding kennels that can help.|`|kvHqnR5Haa	I am gone 11 hours a day and I have a puppy but he does not stay at home alone.  He is with my mom or my sister every day (sometimes he will be in his kennel for the first 4 hours but someone always picks him up within 4 hours).  <br>  <br>  If you have somebody that can watch it during the day or come spend a few hours with it while you are working, then I would say yes, but if you are going to keep him home alone for 10 hours a day then I would say no.  Not only would you feel guilty, dogs deserves better than to be left that frequently.|`|VOIs9Kxqaa	if you can afford it you can. I know most people are probably saying don't get a dog, but I mean if you have a dog walker or negihbours letting your dog out or taking it for walks its not that big of a deal. whats important is that you MAKE time to spend with your dog. <br>  also, if you get a puppy and your not around that often, it could take longer to house train...as oppose to an adult dog who already is house trained. just thought I'd mention that since shelters are usually over run with dogs who are already trained, well behaved, fixed, etc.|`|nNGrfHdTaa	Hey x<br>  <br>  No i would Suggest Not buying a puppy At this point in time.<br>  It would be Very unfair to leave a  Puppy of any kind By itself For Hours on end,<br>  Maybe a Cat would be More Suitable because they just come and go as they please,<br>  If you Still do want a puppy Maybe Buy it When u get time off,<br>  Like in the holidays Ect Ect,<br>  So U can train it,<br>  Then Leave it out the Cage if your prepared to.<br>  <br>  G,luck xx|`|b0tWdr2Faa	No. It is cruel to leave your puppy at home for that amount of time everyday. I am not saying it to be mean at all because I know, puppies are lovely, but your dog may Develop toilet problems, behavioral problems (such as barking and scratching and ripping!) because he/she is just bored! I have three dogs one of which is a very big urinate, on Absolutely everything! That is on the floor. Believe me it is not a habit you want a dog to get into ha ha. :)|`|aGJmiOMMaa	I was in the same position with my first puppy. I took 2 weeks off work when he first came home so we could bond and I could start training him. After that I came home every day for lunch to take him on a long walk, feed him and play. Puppies sleep a lot - so I found this schedule worked perfectly. I did this schedule for a little over a year. After that he was trained and was allowed to roam free in the house. He had his toys, food, water and his bed. He's been a very happy dog. So it can be done - but you need to be very devoted to giving your puppy every spare second.|`|2eJcaeOPaa	i think an older settled dog would be better suited for you there are plenty in shelters (hint)<br>  10 hours is a long time is there no one to call round to let the dog out for a wee?|`|U4JNn07waa	I would say no from personal experience I did the same thing and now my 3year old dog has separation anxiety and acts up alot from not getting enough exercise..If I had it to do over I would not have gotten her|`|HgMFrllLaa	Give up!!! Don't even think about it.<br>  Mature dog? Perhaps, but never a pup.|`|7sPa32GSaa	Possibly.  I say no puppy should have to sit in a cage for 10 hours, but that doesn't mean you can't get a beagle.  I think you should look into "doggy day care" in your area and see if there is someone willing to "babysit" your puppy while you are at work.  With the economy in the toilet, you may even be able to find a friend or family member to babysit while you are at work.  <br>  <br>  Another option may be to skip the puppy and look into adopting an adult dog. I doubt they will adopt out a dog if you tell them it needs to be in the crate for 10 hours, but there may be more "doggy day care" options or you may be able to keep the dog in a garage/basement while you are at work instead.  <br>  <br>  Keeping an animal caged up for 10 hours would definitely suck for that animal, but there are other options out there.  Definitely check out if there are doggy day cares in your area.  My coworker takes her dog to it occasionally and it has a blast.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|00ffa92320953b7b22bb9e4f9d3522f3aa	I say go for it, I have 2 dogs, a bull-mastiff border collie (7 yrs) and a puggle (2yrs). My larger dog I got already trained from my sister and she was use to being home during the day, but the puggle I got as a puppy, I took a few extra days off work to be with her and work on potty training, bought the puppy playpen and also paper trained her, got her training classes the whole thing. It did take a little longer cuz I wasn't home all day long every day (gone 8-9 hrs M-F), but she caught on fast.  She has a crate now, but will go in on her own to sleep sometimes, but I don't need to lock her in it.  Now they pretty much just sleep and play with each other during the day, they are not destructive, but I never allowed them to be (bitter apple spray works wonders and consistency when training). They have plenty of toys and bones to play with, we play when I get home and go for walks at night and the dog park on the weekends. I wouldn't change a thing. And they are happy!|`|xPPmqNQvaa	Hi~<br>  No I wouldn't get a puppy or an older dog. Ten hours is too long for any kind of dog to be caged.<br>  It wouldn't be fair to the dog or you.<br>  You would have a mess to deal with once you got home and your dog would not be living a healthy life. It's very possible the dog could suffer  metal problems.<br>  Just wait til your life isn't so hectic. When you can devote time and training to your pet. He will love you for it!|`|kGGlxvkXaa	a beagle NO WAY if you have neighbors it will drive them crazy. No dog should be left in a cage for that long unless you want to pick up a lot of poop and pee. Get an older dog if you want a dog|`|rQgW7EaLaa	if you guys are getting one but are never home your puppy might not be so friendly and will never get to know you but i would just reasearch and see what you can find!|`|0NP0PPByaa	you should not get a puppy because they like plenty of atention and do not like being left alone.|`|e5f99598def46add50fd1da4d4a0f0c8aa	since you work so often, i wouldnt recomend it.<br>  im sorry :(

It has been bred in the bred to retrieve.  I have seen some good labs who do Frisbees well.  The best frisbee dogs are border collies.  I have seen some great collies as well.  I live in N. Alabama and have seen many great "heelers" as well.  I do believe the "proper" nome for the heeler breed is Australian Cattle dog. Many dogs can do this if trained the right way.
px27V5N9aa	First, I find it very odd that someone would actually state that Saline is bad.  Saline is a known for it's healing properties.  We readily put it in our eyes, ears, noses, in our bloodstreams, etc.  Very perplexed over that statement made by Barefoot.<br>  <br>  As for your grandfather, I am very sorry he has this and the family is in this difficult situation.  Be strong, you'll get through it.<br>  I also suggest the KY jelly or the cheaper Walmart type brand of Personal Lubricant.  Water soluble so is not harmful to the tissue if left behind (think of our gyn exams, no one flushes us out afterwards and if they did it would be with saline most likely )<br>  <br>  You could also use ALOE VERA gel which I believe is the same color as Excalibur :)<br>  Here is a quick write up I found of it's uses so you know it doesn't have to be rinsed<br>  "Indicated for:<br>  Digestive tract irritations such as colitis, ulcers and irritable bowel syndrome, cleansing stomach, liver, kidneys, spleen, bladder and colon, arthritis, asthma, bladder and kidney infections, cancer, constipation, diverticular disorders, haemorrhoids, heartburn, heart disease, HIV, immune stimulation, indigestion, insomnia, kidney disease, leg cramps, leukemia, skin health, stomach distress, tumours, vaginitis, vaginal douche, viruses, white blood cell production and general health tonic."|`|u1HahCoqaa	Just take out the Excalibur and replace it with water or something similar looking but harmless.|`|DLl7qEWTaa	Leaving any cleaner on skin is not good. Try putting plain water in a clean bottle and let him use this new cleaner everyday. This might help we have had to do stuff like this with our Granny. Good luck|`|B6zl0AJDaa	Take a used bottle and recreate the label to say NEW formula!  Then fill it with water and let him use away!  If you want help creating the new label, I'll offer my assistance.|`|Pm8nsCGZaa	About a quart of warm water and a drop or two of Dove laundry soap.  It cleans and rinses easily.  Excalibur is NOT that great!  I would not even use it.<br>  If your grampa insists on cleaning, which can be done too much... use plain water.  If you clean it too much you will remove all the oils, and then you are asking for dry skin and possible infections.  <br>  The sheath really only needs well cleaned about every 6 months.  Just check for beans and pull off the flaky skin is all that needs done, evey month or so. Then a good cleaning every 6 months.  Good luck  :-)<br>  *!*!*!   KY Jelly works well too, no need for water and will basically dry up with no residue left over.|`|cSqx1DxKaa	Sorry about your grandpa - mine was the same way.  (Well, he didn't have horses, but - you get the idea).<br>  <br>  I disagree heartily with Barefoot's "saline is bad" statement.  Saline would be my first choice, as it's essentially just salt water.  Aloe vera gel is another good idea, as it's harmless and soothing when applied to the skin.  Best of all, it looks and feels pretty much exactly like Excalibur.  You can buy a bottle of aloe vera gel at a health food store.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|TTLIp8Beaa	i use baby oil mixed with warm water (just a little of each)<br>  it does the job and it doesn't hurt the horse as far as i know. (it's never caused me any problems)<br>  i don't know about leaving any kind of cleaner in the sheath though. that sounds like an infection waiting to happen to me. <br>  and also, sheaths should only be cleaned every 6-12 months.|`|AA11498082	Agree with American...fill the bottles with saline solution.  Make sure all of the bottles are full, so grandpa doesn't order more.<br>  <br>  Dementia is a very difficult situation to deal with, did the art for that T-shirt.  Bless your heart and the very patient gelding as well.<br>  <br>  White light and blessings.|`|0SS4dzykaa	Someone gave a great idea... fill the excalabur bottle with water and a dot of soap. Then advise him that all the other gelding and mares could equally use a cleaning :-)<br>  <br>  wow.. could he come to my barn too?|`|xzJi0bcSaa	Maybe he shouldnt be unsupervised with the horses, it could be dangerous for him. Just a thought, other than that, the other suggestions sound great.|`|LOH6UVh7aa	Hi TexasNascarGirl<br>  I am very sorry. I hope things get better. I would make home made saline solution. Then tell him it is soap.   I wouldn't use any oil base because it will collect dirt if not rinsed very well.  Just food for thought. Good luck!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ***********edit*******<br>  Buck~~   GREAT idea!!  Aloe.  I would try that if it was me!

JnyPoQLIaa	I'm sorry to say that there is no such thing a a cheap turtle. But if you are looking for one that with not get really big then i would have to say a musk turtle would be your best bet. they stay small reaching a maximum size of 13cm.  unlike other turtles that can reach 8 inches easily.  Although they not normally suggested for beginners, but that is because they are a little on the aggressive side and don't play well with others.  However they can be great pets, my little buddy has been with me for more than 10 years.  Through that time he and have formed a bond with one another.  Whenever i set foot into the room he sort of acts like a little puppy dog that craves my attention.  because of that bond i can pick him up and handle him without fear of ever being bitten.  I should say however that this took a lot of time to get to this point, and all animals have different personalities so there are no guaranties.  <br>  <br>  If you want to know what it would take to care for a little musk turtle then here is a list of the basics that you will need:<br>  <br>  At least a 30gal.-long tank <br>  <br>  Filtration system, I recommend an under gravel filter with a power head <br>  <br>  Sub-strait, typical fish tank gravel works just fine fill the gravel up to about 1/4 inch<br>  <br>  A submersible tank heater, to keep the tank water at a constant 75 to 80 degrees <br>  <br>  Musk turtles also need a place that they crawl up onto and bask so get them a floating log or a rock that sticks out of the water <br>  <br>  Lighting, a florecent light bulb will work just fine unless you are not heating the tank then you should use a sun lamp <br>  when it comes to feeding feed your turtle a reletive protion of food once a day <br>  <br>  No matter what turtle you choose I strongly recomend that you do research and talk other people who have had a lot of experience. Remember even though they are small, all turtles carry with them a lot of responseability<br>  So Good luck<br>  <br>  And finally change the tank water and clean tank and gravel atleast every three weeks|`|2YIxnXXyaa	I suggest a map turtle or a musk/mud turtle.<br>  These don't get much bigger than 5 inches in length.  So that'd be about a 50 gallon tank.  I would get a 100 gallon tank though just because it's more roomy.<br>  You'll still end up spending about 300-400 bucks.<br>  So maybe a turtle isn't the pet for you.<br>  <br>  It will need a good filter<br>  A UVB light<br>  A basking area that should be about ten degrees warmer than the water, so about 88-90 degrees<br>  A water heater set to 70-80 degrees<br>  some river rock on the bottom of the tank, about one or two layers (anything smaller I don't suggest because your turtle could swallow one on accident and that could end badly-maybe even death)<br>  A filter-this is VERY important.  Aquatic turtles are easily suseptible to getting Salmonella because they're dirty.  They eat and are sloppy, usually their food falls out of their mouth leaving crumbs everywhere, and they feces in their water.  The filter needs to be working well because dirty water can give your turtle Salmonella, and could be deadly to your turtle and possibly even you.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you want something cheap, I don't suggest a turtle for you.<br>  Or a clean once a week.<br>  Get a rat.|`|4SQx8smEaa	There is no such thing as a cheap little turtle....|`|3IUMh4Igaa	Your set up for any turtle or tortoise will not be cheap. The maintenance for a water turtle is not the easiest. But if you get a land turtle or tortoise, it is pretty easy. Also they really don't like to be handled much. So you might want to get a different animal that would suite your needs better.|`|EDOxXdcoaa	Unfortunately, there is no "cheap" turtle. All of them require spacious enclosures, adequate filtration, basking lamp(s), and full spectrum UVB lighting.|`|Q4pUDkyHaa	I recommend something inflatable or stuffed.<br>  Turtles are hard work and a big commitment. Also they don't like being picked up.|`|i5AsfCuJaa	HAHAHAHA wouldn't we all but unfortunately there's no such thing|`|f4da67d78496875ebabbba2de441fdc7aa	All aquatic turtles need 10 gallons of water per *INCH* of shell. No species of turtle gets less than 4 inches long so you're sort of out of luck.<br>  <br>  You might want to try newts or african clawed (aquatic) frogs if you don't want something that will get over 4".<br>  <br>  There are only a very small number of turtle species that will stay small regardless of the size of the tank. In any case it is illegal to sell or give away any turtle under 4" according to federal law...unfortuneately it is not enforced very well and the little babies that are sold are almost always red eared sliders (RES) that grow to as much as 18".  If a turtle has red stripes near its ears it is a RES and will grow huge no matter what the person selling it will tell you.<br>  <br>  Usually mud, musk, and map turtles stay around 6", a few rarely get more than 4" and not all are for beginners. Martin's World Exotics carry a couple species that stay around 4" and I was extremely pleased and impressed with the turtle I ordered from them a while back. Kingsnake.com also has a number of turtle classifieds although quality can be iffy with some of the people. DON'T go to Turtle Sale as I haven't heard of anyone who has had anything but negative things to say about the quality of the animals (they often die within a day or two or linger painfully).<br>  <br>  ***No turtle or other animal will grow only to the size of it's container-that only works for goldfish and even then it doesn't work very well. The only way to keep a turtle small is to starve it...in which case whoever does so should be arrested for animal cruelty.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  If you still want a turtle, go to Walmart and get a couple of those big plastic tubs-they're pretty popular and very cheap (under $20 for the largest). Just don't get the ones with wheels...there are far too many reports of them cracking easily...that's a LOT of water that ends up on the floor. You'll still need the sheilded heater and filters that are rated for 2-3x the capacity of the container. You don't need to use any substrate and anything smaller than the turtles' heads can be swallowed and slowly kill them unless it's sand. I've found that bare bottoms are the easiest anyway to keep clean.<br>  <br>  You do need a filter even if you're cleaning the tank weekly, turtles are extremely messy and dirty.  Without a filter daily cleaning is needed.<br>  <br>  Turtles of any species need 10 gallons of water per INCH of shell length. Even the smallest turtles need a 55 gallon tank (you can't fill a tank fully with turtles or they will get injured climbing out from either the water or basking spot and fall to the floor). This doesn't include the space taken up by the "land"-one of those floating docks seems to work best and doesn't take up any swimming room. Most aquatic turtles only need a basking spot large enough for them to be completely out of the water-no other land needed. A cheap alternative to a large aquarium are those plastic storage tubs (the ones with wheels crack too easily). My 12 month old (I know when he hatched) *male* RES has a shell that is nearly 6" long and already needs 60 gallons of water. Females can get as large as 16 inches long-in just the shell. Bigger tanks are also easier to take care of.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Aquatic turtles, while they won't get dehydrated for several days really should be in the water constantly except for basking. There is no benefit to keeping it out of the water. The turtles are not comfortable out of the water because their instincts tell them that they are in danger and are safe only if they are in the water.|`|11RFLpViaa	First, turtles dont like to be picked up or messed with. It upsets them and can cause them to stop eating. They are the kind of pet that you just watch. Of course you have to take them out to clean your tank, but they are not happy about it. Also, tank cleaning and care for a turtle is a pain. My boss gave me a red eared slider for my birthday with all the equipment. The tank is heavy and hard to clean; the turtle had shell rot and it was a pain to get him well; filters, heat lamps, thermometers, water heater, something comfortable for him to bask on.....Maybe you should get a puppy.|`|e5f99598def46add50fd1da4d4a0f0c8aa	there isnt any cheap turtle out there. you have to buy a heat lamp, uvb lamp, big tank, food etc.<br>  they are pretty costly.<br>  you always have to have a couple hundred dollars on hand because if there is a need for an emergency vet check.<br>  they can be expenssive :/<br>  if you want a cheap animal, a turtle is not it :( im sorry)<br>  maybe you can save up? :D<br>  good luck!!
NcIgkRFNaa	I remember when I first got my turtle, I couldn't believe how many hours during the day he would sleep.<br>  <br>  Turtles love sleep, but you want to make sure that your turtle is not trying to hibernate.  Most turtles are programmed to enter a deep sleep at least once a year to consume their nutrients for a few months.  Keep your turtle awake; touch him and play with him gently to prevent him from slipping into hibernation.  Only turtles in excellent health (not that I'm doubting your ability to care for your beloved pet) should hibernate, otherwise they wake up lacking the vitamins they need to stay healthy.<br>  <br>  Yes, turtles sleep, but keep him from hibernating.
145RUNQHaa	I had two schipperkes as a child so i have fond memories of this breed.you really are choosing a wonderful breed and i'm sure your puppy will be fine with the other dogs especially if you socialize them from a young age it will be really good for your pup to mix with the others.the two i had both had different personalities altogether one was docile and very patient while the other one was a bit more bossy but they were both very affectionate and enjoyed nothing better than a cuddle.they can be quite territorial and can be trusted to let you know of an intruder which is a bonus as it gives you peace of mind at night they have quite an annoying bark but i think a lot of small dogs do!they can be a bit distant with strangers and don't make much of a fuss of people they don't know they are definately what you would call a one man dog and they will be faithful and adore you.hope you enjoy your schipperke like i did mine they are just adorable i'm sure they'll get on great with the other dogs.x|`|Z9zzNYNCaa	They *are* "small dogs"!<br>  ALL dogs need TRAINING to become civilized!!!!<br>  Dogs don't have or make "friends".|`|Jr5l59Acaa	Be prepared to separate.

You need to take her to the vet for a senior profile and exam and diagnostic. No one here can tell you what is wrong and for a senior cat it is serious so do not just ignore it. You really do need to take her to the vet.|`|14e4610723b5f7453ddc2705c59f75feaa	She could have gotten hurt, of course, but she could also be sick.  It's always best to take cats to the vet to find out.  When a cat, especially, changes their behavior, it's often because something is wrong.

I'd take her to the vet.  My old cat had arthritis so she would walk with a bit of a limp in the cold weather.  I say suck it up and pay the cash to have your cat checked up at the vet.

If you are not sure whether this is minor or not, you can take your dog to a walk in clinic or make an appointment with your vet. He may need antibiotics for this.

Get someone who knows what to look for to go with if you have never bought a horse before and ride it more than once (go back a few times). You can check the local papers, equine.com, dreamhorse.com,equinenow.com, horsefinder.com etc.  just type in horses for sale in Pennsylvania, that will bring up more sites.  If you havent ridden in a while, maybe go for a little older horse. I like to recommend 6 year olds and up because they are usually past the "young and stupid" age, they are young enough to last a while and old enough to start more demanding events such as gaming or jumping. Good luck!|`|8OJZYB3Taa	Lol your best bet would be to look at deamhorse.com or craigslist.com you can find tons of horses here. I agree with the top oster about the age and breed.

And, take your male to another vet.<br>  <br>  Good luck and sorry this happened!|`|K0uTjeWiaa	File a lawsuit for the price of the surgery in small claims caught.

Did he not check the gender of the cat before he put it under? Did he not consult his surgical charts beforehand? Did they not even make the effort to LOOK? <br>  <br>  Furthermore, can the vet provide proof that the male cat needed hernia surgery so you know he's not lying to you to cover his mistake? Sadly, doctors will often lie to avoid being sued. <br>  <br>  The prices of surgery vary so much around where I live, I wish I could help you on the average price. When my oldest cat was fixed, it was $150. When my youngest cat was fixed, it was $350 and I used the same doctor both times. However, I think $1400 sounds a little excessive for animal surgery. Unless the cat was HUGE, that seems suspicious. <br>  <br>  Have you called other veterinarians (trustworthy ones) and ask their opinion on the situation? <br>  <br>  I'd definitely follow the advice the above answerers mentioned - the BBB and small claims court. This vet does not deserve to get away with a mistake like this - what if he were to make a mistake that cost an animal life in the future?|`|MTr14Obbaa	Call the board of ethics for the state veterinary association.

My dog had the same kind of hernia and it was only $30 to fix it.  Of course, they did it at the same time that they neutered him, so that could have reduced the cost somewhat.  You should always read consent forms carefully before you sign them.  If you signed one that said they could do whatever was necessary, then they are not liable for the cost of the female's surgery.  I always check the box that says they need to call me unless the situation is life-threatening before they do anything.  And by the way, I have taken as many as eight cats to the vet at one time before, so it is not your fault for taking two.  They should have been able to tell them apart.|`|cj31x3UMaa	Last hernia surgery I paid for (~5 years ago) was the same charge as a spay, less than $100 including exam, FeLV testing & shots.<br>  <br>  FTR - in the USA there is a state veterinary board for filing complaints.<br>  <br>  I would assume that you signed a slip authorizing hernia surgery on the MALE.

Sponges and clamps get left inside patients, people get the wrong foot amputated...the list goes on and on.<br>  <br>  Maybe your cat did need the hernia surgery, and the whole thing IS a godsend.  I wonder if your vet preserved any evidence of that beyond his own word.  <br>  <br>  Even if the surgery was needed, he made an inexcusable mistake, and pointing out honestly that the surgery was actually needed is a self-serving and disgraceful excuse for an excuse.  <br>  <br>  You must report this to the state board - it's not just about you and your cats anymore.  And you really should take this guy to small claims court.  Believe me, he has insurance...that's what it is there for.

Now, my next group, I have a boy, who buries stuff if it offends his dainty little nose and even tries to bury his food and water dishes!!  Weird cat, and he does try to steal food when we're not looking.  His name...Mischief Trouble.  Nuff said, ya think? :D  But try putting a towel underneath the dishes, this way if Trouble does do it again, you don't have to put too much effort in the cleaning.

I have almost thirty total right now (I do rescue work and adopt them out), but one of my personal cats does the exact same thing with the water.  Even with a heavy bowl, she "digs" the water out and still makes a mess.  The best solution I have found is to put a puppy house training pad under the bowl to catch the water.  As for the litter box thing, most of the only run like crazy if it hurts them to use the litter box.  If it is after she pees, she may have a urinary tract infection, which can be cleared up by antibiotics.  If it is when she poops, try some hairball remedy because she could be constipated.  Since the kittens are one year old and you don't have any more by now, I would assume that you have had them spayed and neutered.  Please do so if you have not already.|`|MqOq21Luaa	I have a cat that used to do that as well. So, I got a dog dish so it would be more difficult to turn over. However, they still managed to get it over!<br>  So, finally a got a new water bowl, one that has the upside down jug and pours into a bowl, and put it in the kitchen instead of their room (yes, my cats have their own room). Well, my cat didn't like that at all....so after a few months of having it there, and not drinking much because of the dislike of the new location, i moved the regular water bowl back in to their room and voila! No more upside water bowl. <br>  <br>  To save you from all this, just get one that is really stable and super heavy.
F2JEvYX7aa	She is a mutt and there is no telling how big or small she will be. GET YOUR DOG SPAYED ASAP. There is no reason at all to breed a mutt. Don't you see all the dogs and puppies in shelters, why in the world would you add to that. Not only is it stupid but you are putting your dogs life in danger and it is expensive to have the pups.|`|p7swtBYzaa	Please --- get her spayed asap - why would you breed a mix when the breed rescues are full of homeless dachshunds and chihuahua, let alone mixes.<br>  We turn away dogs in need constantly because we don't have foster homes for them.   Spay your dog, let her be a loved pet - there's no reason to breed her, none at all.   You sure won't make any money on it, if that's what you're doing and you will endanger her because little dogs like that (especially chihuahuas and chi mixes) often need C-sections, expensive proposition.<br>  <br>  She stays in heat about 3 weeks, same as any other breed.<br>  <br>  She will not grow more after 10 months, so the size she is should be the size she will always be - she might put on some weight, but she won't grow.<br>  <br>  Again - spay her please.|`|49ec8e0944023c0f5c20e37484f16366aa	Because she is a mixed breed, it's very difficult to predict her adult size.  Males of most breeds will be slightly bigger than females of the same breed.<br>  <br>  <br>  Regarding breeding her, it's not only a question of possibly making money selling the puppies.  It's important to have the breeding pair health-tested and genetic-tested, to make sure any disorders that are in their makeup are not passed on to the puppies.  Your female may carry a gene for an eye disease like PRA, but show no symptomss of it now.  The male, likewise.  However the puppies, carrying both their genetic makeup, may show signs of that disease at a very early age.   Genetic testing is expensive, but the responsible thing to do.  This is why so many people caution those who want to breed their dogs.  There are just so many steps involved--people are looking out for the well-being of the future litter.<br>  <br>  Shelters are full of mixed breed puppies that are euthanized every day.|`|11eff3f79a9e15abe0c3be3ee9640961aa	Since your pet is a mixed breed it would depend on what breed your pet is more like.  If your pet has the appearance of a dachshund characteristics then naturally the pet would have a much larger body and elongated with short legs like the dachshund is.   But if your pet has the characteristics of the chihuahua then the pet would be very small in stature.  <br>  I usually check out the pets feet to tell how big they might get.  The tinier the feed the smaller the dog.<br>  If your pet does take after the chihuahua and you are planning on having a litter  then you do not want to get a dachshund for your stud dog, especially if your pet is very small in size.  Make sure you use a stud chihuahua because your pet will not be able to deliver large pups.|`|Bw18seFqaa	Chihuahuas are up to 6 pds.<br>  <br>  Mini Dachshunds are under 12 pds<br>  <br>  Standard dachshunds are 16-36 pds..<br>  <br>  so a mix can be anywhere between those sizes...   at 10 months, she wont get much bigger than what she is now.<br>  <br>  ALL dogs are in heat for approx 21 days, and can bleed for the entire time..  there's no difference regardless of size.<br>  <br>  <br>  She does NOT need to have a litter.  She is a mixed breed dog...  she has nothing to contribute to future generations..  breeding should only be done to improove and preserve a breed.. this is done by showing and prooving that a dog fits the breed standard, and also genetic health tests, as well as years of research and guidance from an experienced mentor.<br>  <br>  SPAY your dog.  All you would succeed in doing by breeding her is contributing to the over population problem.<br>  <br>  Spaying is healthier, it will prevent certain types of cancers and deadly uterine infections.  There are no health benefits behind letting her have a litter.. infact, pregnancy and whelping have serious risks, including death..  even experienced breeders loose their dogs when breeding them!|`|P2yRAWiJaa	First things first - get your dog SPAYED asap!!!  No heat cycles or bleeding to worry about and no unwanted mutt litters. :)<br>  <br>  Second, this kind of mix can be as small as a chi (6 lbs) or as large as a dachshund (10 - 15 lbs).  Go to akc.org and look into each breed. You'll get a better idea of how yours will look and act.|`|FtOur7ozaa	To Becky D, rescue member, ??

You sure won't make any money on it" if you are imply that people only breed mixed breeds just for money get same damn help and open your eyes if you were just going to say some useless crap like that then you shouldn't have even commented in the first place and for you information i have a Dachshund and Chihuahua mix too and they are good mix and for your information they will contribute to future generation unlike your useless self saying crap like that so if you weren't even really going to answer her simple question to answer at all oh and people anyways she never said she was going to sell them!!|`|zGdwCWUHaa	ok who was the mom chi or doxie she mineature or standard doxie mixed with she should not even be in heat she shoul be spayed because shes a mutt she should not even be breed i do know it all depends on the dog on how long they are in heat. i'm thinking under 15pounds.|`|kGGlxvkXaa	i have a dachshund and chihuahua not mixed but purebred.

LxqJ138Uaa	Most common house plants are poisonous to them, they might not mess with them but live food in your tank might and then when the reptile eats the live food it will become toxic to them. <br>  <br>  Bamboo would be safe. <br>  <br>  If you have ever been to home depot, they have these small succulents that grow on wood, that would be good and safe to use but they are adapted and live better in dry environments (not tropical, but you can still use them, see how it goes.<br>  <br>  Pothos although technically non toxic they do contain noticable levels of oxalate crystals. These crystals cause pain when eaten and it is debatable if they should be used with omnivourous species. <br>  <br>  The best thing to do is to get non-toxic plants from pet stores or online because they usually provide plants that are safe to use. You can use non-toxic Ivy.<br>  <br>  Using hibiscus plants are nutritious if eaten and are a great plant. you would need to trim appropriately to fit in the tank.<br>  <br>  Make sure the plant is pesticide free. Ask the nursery if they use pesticides. Do not take chances even miniscule pesticide ingestion will result in death. Wash the new plants in the shower with a soapy washrag thoroughly. I advise washing because it gets off pesticide and also small insects and their eggs.

The onlt time you can put your hand in is to put down new food and change the water, this should be done as quickly as possible!|`|q0vKbocHaa	yep. they eat the weak so the younger have a better chance of survival|`|TUFoB5RMaa	hopefully no, but avoid touching her and disturbing her for the next 2 weeks. avoid cleaning the cage for the first 3 weeks or else the female hamster could panic and kill the hamster babies. If it is really necessary to 'clean' a cage area while the mother hamster is nursing her babies, you should only use a small piece of tissue to 'clean' the cage but avoid touching the nest area. Provide additional bread soaked in milk in a small food bowl as this will provided extra proteins both for the mother and baby hamsters. The cage should be placed in a quiet room and out of noises since noises can cause the mother hamster stress.|`|9Xt3UpB1aa	Sadly yes. In the wild, a mother will kill off the weaker ones and eat them to keep the nest clean, and other animals from smell the dead ones. This goes for rats, hamsters, bunnies, ect.<br>  <br>  Also if she does not have enough milk for all of them, she will kill some off to make sure the rest have enough.|`|4mCfTNdkaa	this actually happened to me once too...the mom ate the babies and the dad too so to answer your question yes they can|`|078c9269781f249b467d399b49c9e6b1aa	i don't think it would but then again I could be wrong because hogs eat there young.

AQsiugSpaa	Hi there,<br>  <br>  Take a moment to think about your statement that there are no alternatives to declawing.It is just not correct. It is not the only option. If you really disapprove of the practice which is banned in 25 countries ( wonder why?) you would spend more time convincing your friend that there are options to declawing, since folks who live in those other countries have found them. You might also ask your friend if she has ever cut one of her nails too deeply and to remember how painful it was. This is just a fraction of the pain which a cat must endure post surgery and in some cases, permanently.<br>  <br>  To name a few:<br>  1. Learn to clip nails and do it every two weeks for front, and 4 weeks for hind claws.<br>  2. Offer the cat really attractive cat posts and trees to claw on. They must be high enough for a cat to fully stretch out otherwise cats won't use them. They use them to stretch their muscles .. especially after naps. Carpeted ones are generally useless if that is the only material that is used. Sisal posts and sisal covered trees are magnets to cats. The cardboard scratchers are fabulous as well and very cheap.<br>  3. Put scratching posts in every room of the house. Make sure that their texture does not in any way resemble the furniture.<br>  4. Buy slip covers for treasured furniture and remove it for company.. and if the cat is still attracted, confine the cat in another room when the covers are off. You can get plastic corner shields for furniture.. Cat Fancy magazine advertises this product.<br>  5. Try soft paws.<br>  6.The backs of carpet samples are very attractive to cats to scratch on. The material used on the backing is magnetic, and they are very inexpensive.<br>  7.If all of these options fail, rehome the cat if the furniture is more important.<br>  Here are two excellent resource links to share with your friend..<br>  <a href="http://www.clickertraining.com/node/217" rel="nofollow">http://www.clickertraining.com/node/217</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pet-dog-cat-supply-store.com/shop/cat-scratch-posts.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.pet-dog-cat-supply-store.com/...</a><br>  <br>  Declawing at any age is an abomination, in my opinion.Veterinarians who suggest this procedure are doing so to enjoy the huge fees which declaw surgery brings into their practice.

There are things called soft paws that you "glue" onto a cats claws that make them not scratch.  Buy the cat scratching posts and spend the time to teach them to use it.  Declawing is a cop out, and shows that the owners don't actually care about their pet, just their stuff.  I know its not you , but there is never a necessity to do this unless its a medical emergency (and I have only read of very few of those).  Your friend is making excuses and the cat is the one that is going to suffer incredible pain because of it.<br>  <br>  A declawed cat will be more violent, vicious, and will bite.  I won't even go into the physical detriments of it because I have sung this song 100 times.  DO NOT DECLAW.<br>  <br>  Woooo Amanda!!!  Keep fighting the good fight girlfriend :)<br>  <br>  Kgen, there are problems with declawing that go further than their attitude.  Cats extend their claws and use that leverage to stretch and exercise their back, neck, arm and shoulder muscles, and without the ability to use their claws to secure themselves, are unable to stretch and exercise these parts and wind up being prone to arthritis (almost 100%).  Its so much more than just walking and scratching, its problems that go so much deeper.|`|5f477cf9f429c86fcdfa05dc5d148aa0aa	why would she want to mutalate her cat?

The cat's owner may sometimes find himself the victim, just when he thinks his cat is enjoying a petting session.<br>  Cats Need the Exercise Their Claws and Toes Provide<br>  Watch a cat stretch, whether horizontally on a carpet or vertically with a tall scratching post. He will grab the carpet or sisal with his claws, using the resistance to pull and stretch his muscles. Cats' claws actually play a large and positive role in their amazing muscle tone and agility. <br>  Altered Gait May Lead to Later Joint Problems<br>  Domestic cats are digitigrade, meaning they walk on their toes. Walking with an altered gait because of the lack of the first digit of the toes can affect all the joints of the leg, resulting later in arthritis of the hip and other joints. Jean Hofve, DVM describes this joint deterioration more fully, in her article, "A Rational Look at Declawing." <br>  Cats Need to Be Cats for Their Entire "Nine Lives" <br>  Honestly, if a cat could speak human language, do you really think, given a choice, he'd say, "Sure thing. Cut off part of my toes?" His claws and toes are an integral part of making a cat a cat. Would you honestly want him to be anything less, especially since there are humane alternatives? It's your decision, but please take your cat's needs into serious consideration before making such a drastic and permanent choice.|`|uBFhKXgHaa	It is NOT the only option. It is /never/ the only option.<br>  <br>  Do you realize what goes into declawing? It's not a simple removal of the claws but a full blown amputation of healthy toes. Declawing a cat means removing the entire first joint/bone of each toe. It'd be like cutting our fingers off at the first knuckle. Declawing causes extreme pain to the cat and often problems down the line (litter box issues from associating the litter box with pain after surgery, personality changes/biting/and skittishness from having their first line of defense removed, arthritis from having to learn a new way of carrying their weight etc.). I hear people say all the time "better declawed than in a shelter", but in actuality many declawed cats end up in shelters anyway because of the behavioral problems many experience after being declawed.<br>  <br>  Did you know it's illegal and considered inhumane mutilation in most countries outside the U.S.? I've personally observed a declaw surgery at a vet and it's not a pretty sight to watch a vet take guillotine nail clippers and lop off parts of toes... very barbaric looking (laser removal has less healing time and pain, but really isn't that much better in the long run). Please don't let your friend put her furniture over her cat's well being, it's just selfish. Declawing has no benefits to the cat, only the owner. There are numerous alternatives including scratching posts and surfaces, sticky tape, deterrent sprays, Soft Paws nail caps, and nail trimming.

I get so angry when I see these questions especially when it is being referred to as an answer to preserving furniture.  Why oh why do people insist on having cats when as soon as they purchase furniture the cat has to be mutilated.  Does no person ever think of the implications of owning a cat or any other animal for that matter?  Cats have claws for a very good reason, the main one being defence.  It is not only the physical effects that your friend should be considering but also the psychological effects as well,  It is well documented that declawing can be the trigger to serious bad behavioural problems include soiling and bad tempered behaviour. Please urge your friend to reconsider what she is going to do to this poor little thing, and what the consequences will be.  Ok so the furniture will remain in pristine condition but the poor little cats trust in her owner will have been totally destroyed all for the sake of a nice sofa - what sort of world do some people live in|`|G032Flc3aa	After reading all the replies you already have had I'm sure you now know that declawing is NOT the only option and indeed should not even be an option, I don't know what you people will do when the ban comes in..you'll HAVE to learn how to train and care for your cats properly then!<br>  If your friend is still unconvinced then show her this link <a href="http://groups.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=groups.groupProfile&groupID=103362652" rel="nofollow">http://groups.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuse...</a> or print it off including the photos and MAKE HER study it, also this site <a href="http://www.janskids.com/Declaw.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.janskids.com/Declaw.html</a> and click on the link to the kittens page<br>  <br>  Keight7x if you are really contemplating having this major traumatic operation done to an 11 year old cat you need to be reported to animal protection and your cat taken off you.

The surgery is basically an American trend, and is considered inhumane and is illegal in many countries, (England, Scotland, Wales, Italy, France, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Norway, Sweden, Netherlands, Northern Ireland, Ireland, Denmark, Finland, Slovenia, Portugal, Belgium, Brazil, Australia, New Zealand, Yugoslavia and Japan).  If that doesn’t impact your opinion about declawing, maybe this website will help you decide: <a href="http://community-2.webtv.net/stopdeclaw/declawpics/" rel="nofollow">http://community-2.webtv.net/stopdeclaw/...</a> <br>  <br>  I believe that people who have their cats declawed are uneducated.  It is not very difficult to train your cat to use a scratching post.  The surgery is not simply a trimming of the claws, it’s an amputation of the distal phalanx, including bones, ligaments, and tendons! To remove the claw, the bone, nerve, joint capsule, collateral ligaments, and the extensor and flexor tendons must all be amputated.  If you were to make a comparison, it would be like having the last joint of each of our fingers chopped off.  So of course it is a painful surgery, with a painful recovery.  There are often many complications in the healing process, including infection often from litter box use, resulting in a life-long aversion to the litter box.  Other declawed cats that can no longer mark with their claws, will mark with urine instead, resulting in inappropriate elimination problems.  <br>  <br>  Many cats who have been declawed are traumatized and become withdrawn, nervous, fearful and/or aggressive.  Cats who went through the painful surgery are more prone to resort to biting when they feel threatened.  Since cats have emotional feelings, (just like we do) they can resent you if you decided to get them declawed.  All of these things can cause depression and ultimately lead to an overweight cat.<br>  <br>  If a cat who has been declawed accidentally escapes, he/she would be in great danger.  A cat needs it's claws to defend itself, as well as to escape by climbing.  The constant state of stress, caused by a feeling of defenselessness may make some declawed cats more prone to disease.  Also they cannot stretch their back and shoulder muscles like they do naturally when they dig their claws into a scratching post.  <br>  <br>  One popular alternative is Soft Paws.  They are lightweight vinyl nail caps that you glue on the cat's front claws.  They're great for households with small children and are extremely useful for people who are away from home all day and can't exercise the watchfulness necessary to train a cat to use a scratching post.  Soft Paws are easy to apply and last about four to six weeks.  They come in clear or colors--which are really fun.<br>  <br>  Most common types of damage are scratched furniture, ripped carpets and shredded wallpaper.  You want to eliminate the problem before it occurs.  Buy or build a stable, tall scratching-post, right from the start.  Here are some tips to do it right: If your cat is scratching your furniture or rugs, here is some advice on training them to use a scratching post:<br>  - The post should be at least two feet high, covered with sisal-rope, (mine like the carpeted ones)<br>  - Get more than one, especially when you have a multi-cat household <br>  - Place the post close to the furniture or other areas which are most at risk <br>  - Introduce a new scratching-post with some catnip sprinkled on its surface.  Cats love that and it’s more attractive to them <br>  - If your cat starts scratching the "wrong" object, say "NO" and gently carry your cat to the desired post.  Demonstrate how to use it by scratching the post with your own nails.  If the cat doesn‘t catch on after trying this repeatedly for a few days, gently pick up his paws rub them along the post.<br>  - Never force your cat.  When it starts scratching the post by itself, make sure you use verbal praise with a rewarding treat and plenty of affection.  The cat needs to know that using the scratching post results in positive things such as affection, playing and treats.<br>  - When you have a kitten, start early with the "pawing at post" technique <br>  - Invest in what’s called a “cat tree” which acts also as a leisure area for your cat.  Different textures and heights make it more interesting, you perhaps want to build it yourself <br>  - Try some repellent like pepper-dust or some commercial products on your furniture to keep your cat off these areas<br>  - Be persistent and don't give up too soon<br>  <br>  Use cat claw trimmers and only take off a tiny bit at the end of the nail. Some people say to do it every other week. I think it‘s safer to cut off less than you are told, and to do it more often, (like once a week). Never use trimmers that are made for humans or dogs, because you are more likely to hurt her that way. You can ask your vet or groomer to show you the proper way to do it. Here's a website that shows you how:  <br>  <a href="http://www.catscratching.com/htmls/article.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.catscratching.com/htmls/artic...</a>|`|gU34xa9vaa	I just want to add that I agree with all the people who have replied already and told you how cruel declawing a cat is. <br>  To the person who had 3 done and said they are fine after the pain has passed..WRONG ..they are never fine again, they are crippled for life and are almost certain to develop some behavioural problems fairly soon, and back troubles in later life, because they can not walk any more as cats should walk.<br>  As for the person planning to declaw an 11 year old, that is very cruel, it is cruel enough at any age but for any person to arrange to take an older cats toes and claws away and put it through the risk of aneasthetic going wrong and the pain and confusion the poor cat will suffer, is beyond belief !! Also any vet agreeing to do this is not fit to be anywhere near anyone's animal !<br>  Please everyone who thinks mutilating an animal is acceptable, think again,look up the recommended web sites and read up on it and unless you have a heart of stone, you'll then know how very wrong it is ! <br>  A true story .....<br>  I'm ashamed to admit that I had it done to a cat that I had. When I saw her poor, mangled little paws after the fact I vowed to never do that again. What was left of her digits was limp, useless skin that she had to walk on. It was horrible.<br>  I lost her to leukemia about a year ago. Her short life was spent tottering around uncertainly on nubs where toes should have been. Please don't make the same mistake I made in regard to de-clawing.<br>  <br>  (Thanks to S for allowing me to print this)|`|huEWXxmLaa	It's never an only option, how about in countries where declawing is already banned ? No one even thinks of wishing they could get their cats toes amputated,we go out and buy a good sturdy scratching post and train our cats to use it. It's that  easy !!<br>  The people who say their declawed cats are fine, hmmmmm, yes the poor things have survived the trauma of the operation which is the worst pain a cat can endure by the way,hmmm, they may not have developed behavioural problems ...yet ......but when older they'll be very lucky to esape the back problems which declawing  causes. <br>  Still I suppose if any of those things happen,those people who think its OK to take such very necessary parts from an animal, will just get a vet to take the poor cat's life from it and and then get another cat to mutilate ........until the problems begin again .......|`|UpU5eep9aa	But of course it isn't the only option, in the first place as someone has already stated there is no evidence to believe that the cat is even going to shred the furniture, secondly there is a lot that your friend can do to teach her cat kindly that it may not scratch the furniture and of course she must buy scratching posts, toys, catnip and devote a lot of time and patience to her cat.  This declawing of cats should never be an option and indeed isn't in the more modern and enlightened countries of the world where people either don't have a cat if they place furniture higher on the scale of importance or they teach their cat not to scratch the furniture or they buy cheaper furniture because the home belongs to the cat as well as the human and love is more important than possessions. <br>  If as you say you don't approve of declawing then it is your moral duty to ensure this cat is spared this barbaric and almost medieval procedure|`|EdB0ghKwaa	Please don't de-claw, it is cruel and not neccessary!  I use double sided tape on furniture I don't want scratched; cats hate the sticky feeling on their paws.  Another solution is to use Feliway spray (not sure if available outside UK? Have a look at www.feliway.uk.com), which is a pheromone spray that calms the cat and makes them think they have already marked the item.  I have used both on occasions, and have found this to work.<br>  <br>  Also, a cat who scratches furniture is either bored, or needs to sharpen it's claws.  Does your friends cat have a scratching post?  If so, when the cat tries to scratch the furniture, direct it to the scratch post.  Make sure the cat has plenty of toys to play with as well, so it doesnt use furniture as toys!!!|`|wx1WVpP5aa	<a href="http://community-2.webtv.net/stopdeclaw/declawpics/" rel="nofollow">http://community-2.webtv.net/stopdeclaw/...</a><br>  <br>  Ifyou are not convinced by all your replies, look at the above and get your friend to look at it too.Would she like to think of her cat like that ???|`|P5CLeokmaa	I couldn't get them declawed, just keep a rolled up newspaper.<br>  <br>  I think what they do is keep in badage?|`|YCvgjLdnaa	you should really get you friend to give the cat to a a family member or friend, i mean doesn't the cat mean more than the furniture?! if not then they dont deserve the cat. they should have reasearched the pros and cons of having a cat before buying and that way they would know that yes cats do scratch furniture but if they didnt like that they shouldnt have bought her so the poor cat would not have to be declawed. its irresponsible and shouldnt be done unless a medical condition or a proper reason other than didnt reasearch properly and now want to take part of the cats life away. thats what cats do - catch prey, climing fences, running etc. and they are taking that away from them.<br>  however because, if she is going through with it anyway, she should do the right thing and that is the ONLY reason why i will help her. you can get a cat declawed after 1, people say the best way is laser declawing this is a site for after care in steps -<a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_2057680_care-newly-declawed-cat.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/how_2057680_care-new...</a> and you should be asking a vet i mean my god. first off they take her in without reasearching about cats and how the do scratch furniture then they want to take away her life before shes even had a chance to live it and then when doing the horrible thing they dont even ask the vet for proper advise, we are people who offer the best advise we can, but most arent vets and you should really get your friend to read what these people on y.a. are saying because its true. this person really shouldnt own a cat. and i know you are against it and its not your fault.<br>  i know you will not choose me as best answer and i know i will probably get thumbs down but i just think that saying this is more important than a few points taking off my score. i love cats and so please do anything to stop your friend. i am not having a go at you, just your friend, but if she goes through with it please make sure she does it the right way. thankyou so much and sorry its so long.|`|vBIwaQ0qaa	De-clawing is like pulling our finger nails out. Don't let this person do that to her cat. The older the cat is the more of a hard time it will have dealing with the pain.<br>  <br>  When I was working at the shelter we had a couple come in one day to surrender their cat to us. Why? Because they had all 4 paws de-clawed at the same time. He was only 2 years old. They said he was the sweetest nicest cat before they had him de-clawed. After the surgery they said he turned out to be so vicious they couldn't even get near him with out him attacking. Sadly, he had to be Euthanized as we couldn't place him in anyone's home. <br>  <br>  Tell your friend to get a good size scratching post, spray it with cat nip spray, put some treats at the very top and show the cat how to go up the pole. I used this method when I had 6 cats that were inside all of the time. It worked wonders ; )  They could get a small log as well and do the same thing as the cat post. A squirt gun or water pistol is ideal for situations like this. Every time your friend sees the cat head for the furniture have your friend squirt the cat and yell real loud. The cat will eventually get to the point where all he has to do is see the squirt gun and will take off, fast. There are also repellents that are sold in most pet stores. They have a very pungent odor but won't harm the cat. It will keep the cat away from any areas  that he isn't supposed to be in. Only thing with the repellent is it has to be sprayed every 24 hours or it will lose it's scent and the cat will be back on the furniture.<br>  <br>  Please, don't consider de-clawing. It's so  painful for them to have to go threw. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps.

If you are really curious (and dont have plans on your tax return) there is a program out there that all you do is take a cheek swab of your dog then send it into a company and about two weeks later they send you a certificate telling you what the different breeds are that your dog possesses. My mother did it for her dog that we thought was a boxer/pit mix, boy were we wrong! He had bulldog, st. Bernard, Schnauzer, and like two more breeds in his ancestry.

Call the vet and ask what it might be, explain briefly but with detail (if that makes sense) and have the vet give you a "well it might be..." Don't let the vet say "oh, well bring him in and I'll take a look" demand that he tells you what it could possibly be (your not asking for a diagnosis which they cant do over the phone, but it will give you a base for internet research) do your research on what it could possibly be and if it is possible (I don't know how good your vet is) but ask for a scale of what it could be based on the symptoms like "it could be just stress (as a spectrum low) or it could be something more serious like...(a spectrum high). Then make your decision based off all that.|`|ssuo801naa	He's not freaked out. Heavy and shallow breathing has nothing to do with his mood and most animals will get your attention in any way they can if something is wrong so I suspect that is why he has been meowing. You need to call your vet today and tell them his symptoms and get an appointment. It could be a variety of things, but it sounds like respiratory illness. Some of the specific respiratory illnesses  a cat could get are very serious and could be fatal and shallow breathing is a symptom of a few of those. Don't assume he just has the cat version of a cold. <br>  <br>  I hope your kitty gets better!
TQ47vny4aa	It depends on what was wrong with your dog. Most people will not spend the money on their pets to keep them healthy.

M9o5WpOqaa	Hi Amanda! I have been thru the dreaded Mycoplasma more times than I care to remember...It's a NASTY disease!<br>  <br>  Sneezing is common in rats,but excessive sneezing should be a warning sign of pending illness.<br>  Could they possibly be allergic to the shavings you are using?

If the inner ear becomes involved, head tilt (wry neck) and rolling may occur. <br>  <br>  As the disease progresses, it will enter the lungs and cause Pneumonia,which is fatal to them.<br>  I have lost 3 rattie boys due to this,though the Dr.put them on very strong antibiotics immediately.If you can catch it in time,you can nip the symptoms in the bud and hopefully it will not progress into anything worse.<br>  I am not aware of any 'allergy' medication you can give them,but if they do pay a visit to the vet,he/she will most likely prescribe a Baytril/Doxycyline (generic Vibramycin) combo.<br>  Best of luck to you and your precious little rattie-loves!<br>  Source(s):<br>  experienced rat owner and lover!<br>  12 minutes ago - Edit - Delete|`|hC4Z8HIbaa	Sneezing *can* be a sign of mycplasmosis (myco), but that does not mean it *is* myco. Sneezing is also a sign of an upper respiratory infection and pneumonia. The only way to stop this is to see a vet, who will prescribe some oral antibiotics. Pneumonia and a URI can be treated and not come back, but if a rat has myco, it is most times a recurring situation. (If you don't alewady know, rats have mycoplasma bacteria in their lungs, and an increase in the bacteria is said to be myco.) A rat with myco will need lifelong medications to keep the myco flareups under control.<br>  <br>  If you want to read up more on myco and other respiratory illnesses, check out the forum below.

GdBG4PGYaa	Well, it pretty much has to be a mixed breed. Only because it bears traits of different breeds and not just one.<br>  <br>  Your cat is beautiful! It probably has some Maine Coon in it. You can tell by the long coat, the broad chest, and the big eyes. "Real" Maine Coons have tufts on their ears, and are very big! Usually they are laid back.<br>  <br>  Her breed is DLH aka Domestic Long Hair. Domestic Short/Long Hair just mean "mixed breed" or in the UK "moggie".<br>  <br>  Her coloring is either Dilute Calico and White, or Blue and White Calico.<br>  <br>  I hope I helped!

It is so cute!|`|RN1wGlWWaa	Kinda looks like a blue-silver patched tabby Maine Coon type.|`|4aAhEK9daa	Is it just me or does this cat almost look rabbit-like?  Something very different in the face!  Maybe it's the pink nose and those huge ears?<br>  <br>  Unless you have papers to prove otherwise odds are your cat is no particular breed - just like over 97% of the cats on this entire planet.  Those ears are bizarre.  I'm going to post your pics to my cat show friends and see if they see any particular breeds in there.<br>  <br>  Can I ask where you live?  Are you in the States or elsewhere?  I've never seen a cat with large ears that are round at the tips like that.|`|Rw7gi86Naa	I agree with prettypaws46. <br>  <br>  Most cats we own are mixed breed domestic cats, not purebreds. If your cat has some similar features as a purebred cat which you've seen, it doesn't necessarily mean your cat is that breed. For instance, a shorthair cat that was born in America is not necessarily an American Shorthair cat. Just as not every black cat is a Bombay, and not every gray cat is a Chartreux. Also terms like calico, tortoise shell, tabby, and tuxedo are words used to describe the color and pattern; they are not breeds. <br>  <br>  A domestic shorthaired cat (DSH) is a cat fancy term used to describe a shorthaired cat that does not have a pedigree or belong to a recognized cat breed. The domestic shorthair should not be confused with the American Shorthair, which is a Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) recognized breed.<br>  Domestic shorthaired cats are characterized by a wide range of coloring and typically 'revert to type' after a few generations, which means they express their coats as a tabby. This can be any color or combination of colors. They also exhibit a wide range of physical characteristics and, as a result, domestic shorthaired cats in different countries tend to look different in body shape and size, as they are working from differing gene pools. DSH cats in Asia tend to have a build similar to a purebred Siamese cat or Tonkinese cat, while European and American varieties have a thicker, heavier build.|`|hm8QR95Kaa	Not sure but thats a beautiful cat.|`|SLSX6QQsaa	omg he does look like a bunny!

WivKzesjaa	It may be an impossible thing to do. Guppies aren't very smart creatures. Supposedly most fish have a very short memory. I saw on Mythbusters that they proved this wrong by making goldfish do what you want your guppies to do, but goldfish are smarter than tiny guppies.<br>  <br>  I would say instead of just a hoop in the tank, make a wall with a hole in it. Only put the food on one side of the tank, so they have to go through the hole. Then you can move on to more/harder tasks. <br>  <br>  If you're afraid of killing them, put food on one side, giving them the opportunity to swim through, and then put food on the first side a while later for the ones that didn't make it.|`|Jkt3UkTBaa	Guppies are one of the stupidest type of freshwater fish, just look at them!!

hC4Z8HIbaa	I know of two possible rat mixes that are made out of (not always everyday) human foods. One Is called Suebee's mix. The website for the mix is listed below. ***Please note that Suebee's mix is not intended to replace quality lab blocks, but instead to supplement them.*** You should still buy the lab blocks (not seed mixes. Stay away from seed mixes), but you wouldn't need to buy them as often because the rats would have something else to eat. The other is called Molasses mix. I've never made it, but some people think it stinks and makes their rats stink. It also has some uncommon ingredients. But it is more nutritionally complete than Suebee's mix and (I think) does not need to be fed with lab blocks. Also, instead of lab blocks, you can feed your rat a high quality dog food (not something like Iams or Beneful). It may or may not be cheaper than rat food. You can also order rat food online if it you can't always make it to a pet store (pet stores rarely carry good food anyway). The website I have listed below actually offers a 40 lb bag of food for $20 and cheap shipping, which adds up to less than $1/lb, and it's one of the best rat foods made. If you only have 2 or 3 rats (never one), you can always freeze the extra food until you need to use it so it doesn't go bad.<br>  <br>  If you are seriously contemplating becoming a rat owner, I suggest taking a look at the last website below. It is an online forum I am a member of. It has loads of great information for all current and potential rat owners.|`|280d96ad7b5e9ffad03a34a66cac5db0aa	Yes, there are different possibilities. I only know one that doesn't require a trip to the pet store for anything, though. (There's a diet called Suebee's Diet that is adequate, but it calls for high-quality dog kibble.)

273vsUezaa	They really aren't as hard on dogs as some people make them out to be.<br>  <br>  I love my dogs, and I did end up using a shock collar for a black lab of mine. I tested it on myself, and it shocked the hell out of me, but then again I always hate being shocked lol. <br>  <br>  My dog didn't act as if it really hurt him, moreso that it interrupted his barking session with something unexpected. <br>  <br>  <br>  That being said, I think I could have remedied the solution without the collar, but the shock collar was definitely "okay for dogs"  :)|`|DpT9qJ6Naa	OK--your dog is acting up because he needs to be trained.  That takes time and effort--so using a shock collar is not going to fix anything--it's just going to confuse to dog because he will not know what he has done Wong!<br>  <br>  Look for a reputable trainer in your area that will work with you.  Get the dog TRAINED properly, first.<br>  <br>  Shock collars ar used as a last resort to correct only the worst of behaviors when Control of the dog is needed.  Zapping your boy because he has his head in the garbage can or because he is lifting his leg on the furniture is not a "worst" behavior!<br>  <br>  Please be an advocate for your dog--ask your parents to find a trainer.  Help your dog to become a good canine citizen.|`|S9ZNGhqyaa	I use a shock collar on my dog only as a last resort.  He has only been shocked once, and he hated it, so now if he barks, we just let him see it and he stops.|`|HgMFrllLaa	With all due respect. You are a bunch of morons, and I pity the poor dog. BTW, "getting into mischief" is NOT a reason for a shock collar.|`|0mkvtTxBaa	if you want your dog to feel hurt then its ok|`|AA12128656	a shock collar, or electronic collar, is NOT a cure-all. in fact, with improper use, it can kill your dog, or weaken his heart enough to lead to an untimely demise.<br>  <br>  your mom shouldn't be pissed at the dog. she should be mad at herself and your dad. PREVENTION and CORRECTION are the ways to train a dog.<br>  <br>  if she INSISTS on using it, YOU INSIST that she get some PROPER instruction on how to use it from a PROFESSIONAL, not just from reading the instruction manual in the box.<br>  <br>  so, to appease mom, how about just making it LOOK like he's wearing it (or return it, they're expensive!) and PROPERLY training the dog?!?!|`|iVQULHqYaa	Shock collars can be a training aid. However they are not for amateurs. If your dog has had little training and if you are not an experience trainer, a shock collar is cruel. Timing is vital and your dog must know commands before you use this.<br>  <br>  Your dog did not understand the English language when he came to you. If you have not taught him to understand, a shock collar is not going to help. It will confuse him.|`|cY8DgJv5aa	Personally, I think they should be a last resort.  I don't like the idea of shocking an animal for something they do naturally.  Almost ALL behaviors can be corrected by training.  Its not the poor dogs fault that no one has trained him appropriately.  I'd think some simple training would be much a much better alternative than the shock collar.  It would also be an effective way to permanently fix the problem.  Shock collars only fix the problem for that very instant.  The minute you take it off, they go right back to barking.|`|qioH81tiaa	Not in your situation, no.<br>  <br>  They are training tools, and, to be humane and effective,  must be used properly.<br>  <br>  They are NOT a replacement for inadequate training and exercise.  <br>  <br>  Tell your dad to exercise and train the dog instead or taking the lazy and ineffective way out.|`|xEyyFrPhaa	i would NEVER use a shock collar on any of my dogs, take him to training classs or find a good dog trainer in your area.<br>  <br>  <br>  or watch the dog whisperer, he has some useful tips on training dogs.|`|P4WJD6Cpaa	There are better ways of getting your pet to obey than using that.

SMdzufBxaa	I had a hamster, iyes it is bad for them. <br>  The reason why is that there ears are small, the vibrations and the frequency of the music, can make the disoriented and confused, can make the also hostile and may aggravate them and you may end up getting bit, there bites aren't very painful. <br>  <br>  But yes it's not very good for any sort of loud! music, ask them if they can keep it down. It's less likely to cause aggravation, and other problems with the hamster.|`|uxwSd0KLaa	Yes really bad|`|77NzfiVkaa	If he's known it all his life he will be fine.

Any LOCAL pet store that sells plants should have this type of gravel.  I have this in all of my aquariums though you do not want to actually use sand.  It will compact and create oxygen free areas that make acid and you'll get cynobacteria.  It's all bad.  If you happen to have and are going to keep a full aquarium of sand stirrers then you could possibly make the argument that your aquarium won't crash and burn though these sand stirrers will be just as happy in tiny gravel so I would just start there.

If where the eye was doesn't look infected then the fish will be absolutely fine.|`|tMlwcim8aa	Fish with only one eye do pretty well, considering they don't have diseases. The only problem is his range of sight is reduced by 50%, so he'll have to turn around more to see his environment, other than that, this should present no complications, unless it gets infected. I suggest you monitor his behavior, and make sure to make frequent water changes, once every week, and the first one or two inches off the top, to keep the water quality good, so it won't get infected.
0SS4dzykaa	There are lots of insurance companies who insure horse businesses like yours (carriage rides, pony rides, wedding or Trainers, Clinicians policy, etc.)  Just make sure you ask for a Commercial Policy.

nFcl0BOsaa	I highly recommend replacing your regular shower head with a hand-held shower -- much easier to rinse the dog. A shampoo made for dogs is best for his skin. If you will have difficulty keeping it out of his eyes, buy a tearless kind. First I arrange my supplies, including towels, nearby. Then I place my large dog's front paws on the edge of the bathtub and then he hops in by himself. Wet him down, lather him up, and rinse very well. (Residue from shampoo can cause flaking and itching.) Let him shake himself off in the bathtub, and then get him out and towel-dry well. I finish up by blow-drying. My dogs don't mind it at all; in fact, they will try to crowd each other out of the way to be closest to me with the dryer.<br>  <br>  Edit: Try holding his ear to delay him from shaking off.|`|eulWfKOfaa	Yes, you have to use a special dog shampoo. Is he afraid of water? And is this his first time? You have to get him used to the bathtub alone first, by giving him treats when he is calm. and even feed him a meal in there so he can associate the tub with good things. Then you can slowly let the warm water in the tub and splash him gently first. Then if he is nice and calm, you can start to bathe him.<br>  Be careful and don't get water/shampoo into his EYES and EARS!<br>  <br>  Good luck and have fun!|`|uNRvZWifaa	they have the wipes and different things that don't involve water that you can use. If he seriously need a bath keep your hand on his scruff so he doesn't jump out and soothe him so he feels comfortable and bathe him in the tub.|`|C9djEwkfaa	put him in the bath tub and give him a bath and yes he is going to shake all over it could get messy ... also you have to use doggy shampoo go to any place that sells pet stuff and get some .. i give my boxers a bath at home ..they will shake and probably get water all over.. best thing i figured out is have lots of towels around and put a towel over him before he jumps out cuz mine usually shake off as soon as they hit the ground ..|`|stCyrS4Eaa	I am not sure if this is a new concept, or that I just drove past one and noticed the other day. My local car wash has a separate dog wash station. It is enclosed like the car wash & all manual. There is a dispenser for dog shampoo and light hand held jet for your dog. What a wonderful addition. I can't wait to use it! Maybe you can check your area for the same thing.<br>  <br>  "People will soon be able to stop by Big Dog and wash not only their cars, but also their dogs. <br>  <br>  Before animal rights activists get up in arms, owners will not be sending their dogs through the automatic wash. A separate, dog-friendly, self-help wash station will be created next door, at the animal hospital Sheldon and his wife are planning to build on the front of Big Dog's large lot." <br>  <br>  Here is a link for this one.

XevKV6XOaa	I don't think there's anything wrong with him. Unless his breathing is laboured or he has a wheezy chest then you have nothing to worry about. I have 6 rats 3 females and 3 desexed males all ranging in age from 6 months to 1 1/2 years that all live together and some sneeze more than other. I have one in particular that sneezes at everything. But the amount of times you say your lil guy is sneezing is nothing compared to mine so im pretty sure he's fine. Rats can have allergies to things especially things like room deodoriser, body spray anythign sprayed in the air is not good for them no matter how small. If you ever notice too much porphrin ( don't know how to spell it lol) which is the red stuff that looks like blood coming from his eyes or nose then there's something wrong.  A little bit is normal but if it is in excess then i would question if he was sick, it may also be harder to tell is his face is a darker colour as opposed to being white. So unless his chest is rattly or he is lethargic and wont eat then i dont think there's anythign wrong with him.|`|280d96ad7b5e9ffad03a34a66cac5db0aa	Yes, it's a good idea to get him off the CareFresh. Many owners are unsatisfied with it due to how dusty it can be. You can try CareFresh Ultra, aspen or fleece liners.<br>  <br>  Anyway, I'd be quite concerned about such a noise, especially because he was just sitting there while doing it. I think a vet appointment and a thorough inspection is in order. Better safe than sorry.<br>  <br>  So you know, if the other rat does have a respiratory infection, keeping it in another room isn't going to do anything. Airbourne infections can infiltrate the entire house, so the other rats have already been exposed. Plus, your friend would have to take a shower, blose her nose, sanitize her hand and change her clothes every single time she visited a potentially sick rat to keep from spreading the infection. That's why quarantines should be done in a completely separate air-source, like a different building.|`|3BVDSwgNaa	I have 7 ratties and use Sun Seed bedding, the dust level is non existant and it has baking soda for odor control.  My boys sneezed alot with anything else but now I never hear it.<br>  <br>  The noise you are describing sounds like what my boys do when they are extremely happy, it is like a chortling sound.  My hub is a nurse and he listened to their lungs with a stethoscope and they were clear. They only seem to do it when they are on my shoulder. My short hair tickles their backs and I swear it's like laughter. <br>  <br>  If you are really concerned, take him to a vet for a checkup.|`|GksOStrsaa	Ummm... Are you sure he's not just bruxing? Cuz that is completely normal. It shows that your rat loves you. I wouldn't be to worried about the sneezing. My girls did that too when they were younger.|`|duIQeYWOaa	honestly, you are coming across as a bit overconsciouss, but then again rats are sensitive critters. if you truly believe it, the condition ur describing is likely a respiratory infection, very common. the vet should prescribe a simple liquid antibiotic, i forget the name... but really, if the vet feels its uneccessary, it probably ok to trust her judgment. i had a little one that would squeak excessivley and attack/ lick lips. i named it squeakers... they really do just have their personalities..goodluck

EJpiaCMQaa	The female sounds like she's hormonal to me.  Throwing out all the chippings on the bottom of the cage is a sure sign.  Some birds will also shred their newspapers.  Pet birds, such as ringneck parakeets, can become aggressive during this time.  She seems ready to mate, so I hope the two will mate soon.  This could greatly reduce or stop the aggression.  If they don't mate, they may have to be separated if the female gets too aggressive and keeps fighting.  You don't want the male to get hurt.  Keep a close eye on the two and put in a nest box to encourage mating.  Hope that works out for you.

jyGTlpzTaa	You can make double decker C*C cages, if you cant build out try building up! Also lots of tunnels and hiding places and chew toys. Try different ways of feeding hay like the "boredom breaker Hay N Hide" tunnels which are made of hay, and hay cookies. <br>  <br>  A good variety of fruits and veggies is important. Your piggie can have the following: Apple, pear, berries, peach (not too much fruit though, it can make their tummies runny), as for veg, all leafy greens are good except plain lettuce and iceberg lettuce...so romaine, rocket, spinach, kale, endive, lollo rosso, bok choi, watercress, all good. Also you can feed carrot, celery (not too much of this it is mostly water not that rich in vitamins), broccoli, radish, chicory, bell pepper basically anything that is not onion, citrus fruit, or iceberg lettuce.<br>  <br>  Vitamin C is the most important for your piggie...you should feed a high quality guinea pig pellet (not a coarse mix or muesli type, they tend to feed pickily with these)l such as Science Selective or Supa Guinea Excel in the UK, not sure about the US but Oxbow are good. All guinea foods will contain vitamin C but it is also found in the treat veggies you give.

Most health care plans for dogs and cats cover accidents, not illnesses, and I’m not aware of any company that will cover a preexisting condition.   <br>  <br>  Diagnosing a dog is often more difficult than diagnosing a human because the dog can’t talk and tell the vet where it hurts, so comprehensive care policies tend to be expensive.<br>  <br>  By all means get the blood work done ASAP.  It may be less expensive to have your vet treat the condition than buy insurance.  <br>  Whatever you do, don’t get involved in insurance fraud.  It’s a felony and insurance companies are quick to file charges.  If you move to another state and change your dog’s name, you might get away with it, but it’s not worth the risk.<br>  <br>  A common cause of seizures in dogs is pesticides and herbicides.  Keep them out of your house.  If you have your lawn treated, make sure your dog doesn’t eat the grass.

Suddenly he begins to run from the group, flying over the green grass, his legs carrying him faster and faster.<br>  <br>  You have been spotted, and when you and your special friend finally meet, you cling together in joyous reunion, never to be parted again. The happy kisses rain upon your face; your hands again caress the beloved head, and you look once more into the trusting eyes of your pet, so long gone from your life but never absent from your heart.<br>  <br>  Then you cross Rainbow Bridge together.... <br>  <br>  <br>  God bless =)|`|afec6d005fb7698534de7994ff84613caa	As its been said, talk to the vet.  But also think about the cat.  How do you see it with life?  Does it seem happy, or just sad most of the time?  I know its rough, and sad to think about putting down a cat, cause animals don't stay a pet for long, they become FAMILY!  I have my 3 'children' and I honestly don't know what I'm going to do when they die.  I'll probably be heartbroken, but I want them to be happy too.  Just think about the cat's quality of life and talk to the vet.  Thank you for taking in the cat, you're a good person!|`|fc5e4f4741642787d64f7d84cccb7b94aa	I would ask the vet if removing the rest of her teeth would give her a better quality of life.<br>  If her mouth is that bad it could be effecting everything you are talking about.<br>  It's a risk to put her under at this age and the vet would know what's best.<br>  If her teeth are removed she will be fine eating.  I had all my dogs teeth taken out due to infection (they were falling out) of the blood they were so bad.<br>  The dog could eat anything since the jaw bones are so strong so chewing food wouldn't be a problem plus you could just give her moist for the rest of her life.<br>  Talk to the vet.<br>  Good luck and you sound like a wonderful home for a cat in need.<br>  Kath|`|VQ4IgCmuaa	this is a hard decision for any pet owner. you have to ask yourself is her quality of life good? is she suffering. id also talk to your vet to see his/her opinion. do whats best for the cat even though it maybe hard.
v6siQIVjaa	it is like they are hamsters they just want to get out to play but if you are going to let her out clip her wings and put her in a secure room|`|20ccea7fa7f3ddbfe3a11c22cf8097ddaa	Any bird will try to escape if he thinks he can. Yours evidenly thinks he can go behind the food dish and get out.<br>  <br>  why is my parakeet wedging his head between his cage and food bowl?<br>  <br>   My answer is because his head fits. You have to be watchful of danger spots in your cage like too wide a bar spacing. If your bird's head fits in tight places you have to be aware he could slip and strangle or injure himself. Perhaps you could get one of those plastic screw on dishes that fits flat against the bars.|`|rQgW7EaLaa	maybe it wants to have some time out of the cage to fly around mine did the same thing and it helped it!!:)
