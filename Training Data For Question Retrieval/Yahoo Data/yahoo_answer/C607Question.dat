His best friend blabbed so his girlfriend( Ex friend) who hates me, she made up a really bad fake answer that would get me in huge trouble (with boyfriend), and it was completely off topic to the question also. Pretty much she said that i had sex with someone, now she's telling all her little friends the non truth and there telling other people! What should i do?

20090202103920AAgLYBr	Family & Relationships;Friends	I feel like i've lost my friends...?	I had a bit of an argument with one of my two best friends a few weeks ago over something rquite silly. Anyway, i didnt think i was in thw rong in any way, but i apologised anyway because i didnt want to lose her. Plus it ould be unfair on our other best mate because she would be stuck in the middle. We sorted it out and now we are friends again (ish).   The thing is, i've always felt a little bit left out. I feel like they are closer to each other than any of them are with me, even though one of them has been my best friend for nearly 13 years. They go out together all the time and dont invite me, and i know for a fact that if i did that to one of them they would be angry. But i sort of let people walk all over me and if i am upset with someone i dont let them know about it because i dont like to cause trouble, so i think the reason they think they can do this to me is because they know i wont say anything to them.   They are planning a night out on St. Patricks night, and talk about it in front of me all the time but wont invite me.    I just feel so left out, especially sicne i had this argument with one of them, like i get the feeling they dont want me around anymore, and it hurts because i've been friends with them for so long, and i dont know what i will do if we dont sort this out soon :(   Please give any useful advice you can... Thankyou.
20090202103914AAhAN4T	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	He told me he loves me. ut does he mean it?!?	Th guy i sit next to in my chemistry class is a total PLAYER. When he's with me it's like he's a totally different person. He makes me laugh. Comforts me and helps me with the work. As soon as the school bell rings It's like I don't know him and he's back to his own world..Chattingup every girl in sght loud mouthing etc..   Then one day in class he put his arm round me and said " I love you baby. And we are meant to be together." I was hapz but the thing is does he mean it!?
20090202103932AAtx5Xg	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I dont know what to do?	I know this is a really long question, but id really appreciate your help      Theres a guy, that i really like, i think i love him, i used to see him alot, but now not so often      I feel like i have a special connection with him, he understands me perfectly, and im always at such ease with him and i can just be myself. He always listens so attentively, and he has an amazing ability to make me fell bettter when i'm sad. With a few words he can change tears to laughter.    when he's gone i feel like part of me is missing      Sometimes i think that we were made for eachother - like soulmates. There was a stage when I thought that he definitly felt the same way, he took every opportunty possible to be with me and his face lit up when he saw me      Ok - so heres the problem -  shortly after i became close to him, he got a girlfriend, he's pretty serious with her now and i often wonder if they'l ever break-up. I don't think she loves him the way i do, its driving me crazy. It kills me to think that someday they could end up married, I don't know how I could endure that.       I think about him everyday and it often brings me to tears, i really don't know what to do. It hurts so much   What can i do?

I have feelings, thoughts, opinions, and heart. every guy I meet and date, is unfaithful and dishonest. guys always treat me nice in the beginning and once they know I'm hooked, they don't care about my feelings. once they finish using me or keep using me, they just leave me like a piece of trash. I am someone who is looking for real love. If I become a mean person, guys would love me?

20090202105446AAANpVw	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What would you do about this STUPID situation?	what would you do if you were talking to someone you met online, you both were 100% honest and you feel such a great connection BUT every time you plan to meet, the plans fall through.      this person devotes tons of time to talking with you and knows that because of their busy schedule, it makes having ANY kind of relationship hard and they're constantly reminded by family that they need to learn and make more time for the people they love. however, you've never said anything like that bc you know it discourages them. this person knows it hurts you and has been apologetic and even sad themselves that things fall through.      people around you are getting annoyed, but you totally trust this person and have high hopes of meeting them extremely soon because it's been almost three months of talking every day. you've also talked to four siblings of this person. EVERYTHING makes perfect sense. this person even mentioned like, why would they waste their time making things up and what not. it's just they don't have a lot of free time, or their family somehow messes things up.      what would you do?

Ugh, the reason why I ask, is cause' my friend (who's a girl) and I made a bet and the terms were that the loser will have to be the winner's slave for a week.   Well I lost, so now I have to my friend's slave. So i thought she'd make me do chores or something. But then! she mentioned to me that she knows how much I hate feet and is going to make my week "so incredibly humiliating and disgusting, AND unforgetful!" She added that since she "owns" me for the week that she has the right to volunteer some friends of hers. Ok so anyway, she mentioned how during my first day as her slave, she was going to have three of her girlfriends come over and use me. What does she mean use?? she said something about her not going to take a shower at all..DOES THAT MEAN WHAT I THINK IT MEANS?!?       would any of you girls actually make a guy do this? I mean if so, and my friend actually DOES make me do whatever she has planned then I'll be a sav' n do it...but we'll see I guess

For our fourth date, he is coming over my place and I’m cooking him dinner (we’re both kind of broke right now). I think he already likes me, but is cooking a yummy dish a bonus?

20090202105610AA1CuY1	Family & Relationships;Friends	Am I asking too much out of him? Am I trying to hard? Do I care too much??? HELP!!!?	I've been friends with a good friend of mine for a year. In that year a lot of things have happened, both for the good and the bad. He is someone I have considered to be my best friend! When we first became friends, he would always make time for us to hang out, we would go have dinner, go to the movies, or just go and talk, slowly we got closer and began hanging out more. He would call me and text me and want to hang out pretty much every other day. Then his girlfriend went on vacation for the summer, and we started hanging out even more. During the summer, we would hang out talking for hours, going to lunch or dinner, going to the movies or the drive in. Just hanging out, and we grew really close. Later his girlfriend who I have never met, decides to randomly send me a really wierd message telling me to leave her boyfriend alone the he was hers. I replied back nicely being like what are you talking about. She replied back talking crap to me, and I replied back telling her who is she to judge me, she replied back saying that I was judging her and she started saying more crap to me. I got upset and without thinking much of it, replied back telling her to F**k Off B*tch. I told my friend what I had said and although he told me he wish I hadn't said that, he was cool with it. The next day he stopped talking to me for 4 1/2 weeks because his girlfriend made him. We were later able to work things out and talk things through, but things have never really been the same. Before the fight, if we ever had an argument he would always want to talk and fix things, if he knew something was wrong, he would get me to talk to him about it. But after the fight, all we would do is argue about stupid things. Then we went for about a 3 month period where things were going really well, we were talking more like before, we weren't arguing, things were good. I went on vacation for a week, and that whole week he was constantly texting me and calling me, and couldn't wait till I was back. The first day I was back he was wanting to hang out and we hung out the whole day. Things were really good. But then for some reason he just started pushing me away again. Not sure why. I've talked to him about it, and he says nothing is wrong he just doesn't have time. Before he used to make time for us, now its like he never makes time. He gets upset with me because I get upset about the fact that he isn't making any time to hang out. I understand he has his own life and he has a girlfriend, but am I really asking for too much for him to make time. At least talk on the phone or text message me. Something! We work every weekend together like we always have, but I want a friendship outside of work too. Is that too much to ask for??? One thing that I found out about recently is that he had made a promise with me not to drink, I later found out he was drinking behind my back and lying to me about it. He later admitted it, but now I don't trust him completely about it, and he gets upset when I ask him if hes been drinking. Another thing that just came up, is we made a promise to not have sex, and he broke that promise too, he told me he didn't want to but his girlfriend wanted to, so he couldn't just tell her no. I somewhat think that him losing his virginity is part of the problem, thats when he started pushing me away. He wants me to be cool about him having sex, even though I'm not. What am I supposed to do, just go about it as if nothing happened and its ok for him to be doing that? I don't know! Do I care too much??? Am I asking to much from him??? I really think things would be different if his girlfriend were not in the picture, but it doesn't seem like that will happen.      FYI, he has been with his girlfriend for 3 years almost off and on. He has also cheated on her, but has never told her completly.      He is 17, I'm 21!      He also has told me he doesn't think much of friendships anymore because he's been hurt in the past!      WHAT DOES EVERYONE THINK ABOUT WHAT I'M ASKING????

20090202105117AAutYkQ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should I do? Please help!?	Me and my boyfriend of 1 year was arguing last night I was calming my self down in my room and he told me that he was going to go down stairs to be away from me at like 1:30 in the morning, like 10 mins later I heard someone beep outside and him getting in a car. He didn't say goodbye or anything, We argue everyday almost and I don't know how to act around him without him getting soo mad where he is questioning our relationship. Even the little things make him super mad, and sometimes I have no clue what I did wrong. We have a strong sexual relationship and that is the only thing we don't argue about... I need to know what to do. I Love him and he is my life. I would hate to have to loose him...   Any Advice?
20090202105154AAz7M3D	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Male/Men advice please xX?	If you went out with someone a few times then decided it wouldn't be a good idea to take things further, how would you act around the girl?   I mean, if it were me with a guy, I would be polite to him, but not overly friendly incase I gave him the wrong message or make him hope something might happen in the future.      If you give someone an excuse not to be with them, but then are still very friendly, tell them your problems, and even sometimes give them that look (you know - stare into their eyes a bit longer than you should) why would you do that??!!   Is it because you genuinely like them?   Or is it an ego thing - you want them to like you but don't want to commit?   Thanks xX
20090202105231AAXGwI3	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	A question for the women and a true answer would be great!?	I need to hear what you think about my situation. Its always good to see another persons point of view. And i will make sure to read everyone's answers.      My question is this:      I am single. I have been single for just a little over a year now. I have had some girlfriends that are just amazing in every factor. Great personalites, beauty, great future.       But..      the problem was that since i was 18 i moved out on my own because my parents moved away. And i always wanted my girl to be with me some nights at my place but they still lived at home or went away to college and could never come over and stay the night. But at the way i was living my age at 18 i was growing up faster than my friends. I picked up a full time job at a Corporate America Bank and had  a part time job on the side. And was going to college at the same time. I had to stop college for the time being. So now that im 21 i have been single for awhile. I went the route of just having fun after my last gf and meeting new people and doing my own thing. But i did have quite a bit of one night stands. I was never and will never be an A** hole to any of the women. But it seems to me that now its just a fling for me. I do not gain any feelings and im always honest up front with every girl where i stood. And i every women i hooked up with was over my age. I have a problem talking to women my age a lot of the time.       I get the urge to want to get a relationship again but not sure if i am ready for it. I always enjoyed going out with my girl to dinner or whatever she wanted. Or just kicking it at my place or her place and just be simple and watch a movie. And i def miss having that luxury, but other times the freedom is great as well. And a lot of people say that im still young and to live the life now and someone will come along later. But I have met some great single women who i did not hook up with that i just pass by knowing they would want to date. I am not able to decide what to do. Im at a stand still.       What do you think i should do?

20090202105259AA42d81	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why do so many girls want to go out with me?	I have been asked out by so many "popular, good-looking" girls at my high school and I have no idea why. I am average height, avrage build, I'm not a jock, I'm not popular, not particularly funny, I'm pretty quiet, have acne and am not particularly handsome. I'm okay with all of this, I'm honestly just confused ( pleases don't think I'm a self-loathing person haha). There is one girl in particular that likes me who is basically perfect. She is pretty tall, flawless skin, perfect teeth, best outgoing personality ever, totally fit, great hair, contagiuos smile, really smart, incredibly polite and classy--- once again perfect in every way. However, I don't think she's ever had a boyfriend and I don't know anybody in our school who like her in that way. How is this possible???? Why do girls like me and guys DONT like her? It doesn't make any sense. Anyways the only thing stopping me from asking her out is the fact that I feel like she's too good for me. Has this ever happenede to anybody else out there? What did u do to overcome this feeling of inferiority?

I'm currently trying to find a job and I desperately need a car. My boyfriend is going to iraq next month so I need to get a car really soon. The problem is that I have no idea how to go about getting a car. I dont have credit and I dont have a job but I'm hoping that will chance with in the next two to three weeks because I have some interviews. Anyways how do you get loans for cars what do you need ? I'm kind of freaked out because my parents are helping me out in anyway shape or form and i'm kind of new to this dealing with things on my own. I know that must sound sad but it's true.

20090202105657AATAnYU	Family & Relationships;Friends	Why will no one talk to me in class?	Okay so I started my new semester of grade 10. To begin I ended up being late cause I went to the wrong class (stupid I know) and then I was late so everyone looked at me and then I had to sit at the back because there were no seats. Now nobody talks to me they all already have there little cliques and they just do not talk to me...I am super nice I am a little shy to be honest but seriously not even a hello? They are all super pretty and preppy too so it is just like GOD! I am not to worried about this though because I skate and so I have lots of friends at skating.      But my question is how on earth am I supposed to survive this semester with people that don't even talk or like me. And no I don't think being friends with them is an option because when I smiled at a girl she like rolled her eyes and started to laugh with her friends.       Thanks in advance guys!!!  =))

20090202111121AA4ebMV	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What Do I Do About My Exes Drug Problem?Short?	My ex-boyfriend of a year I believe is addicted to crack cocaine. Need I mind you, he isn't poor trash from the sticks. He's been to the best schools and currently attends a very prestigious university.      We haven't talked much as we usually have. He called me last night about how "horny" he was. That really pissed me off to say the least but a good friend of his told me today that he has been dabbling into drugs.       Last night he took an E pill and he's been using cocaine on-and-off for four months.      This hurts me so much. I was suspicious in the beginning, when we first met, that he has used drugs. He had told me he used pot in his high school years but haven't we all?      I really want to help my good friend/ex-boyfriend so badly. Even though we've faded a little I don't want to see him go down this path. What do I do? I don't want to pry into his life and have him resent me for it.      Advice?
20090202111152AADdbXi	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	GUYS: how long does it take to get over an ex who hurt yo?	I am dating a guy who liked me first when we met 8 years ago. I wasn't feeling it at the time. He started dating another girl for a few months but the break up was bad. Now, after all these years, we are dating, but when anyone brings up his ex, he doesn't shrug it off without some sort of emotion (usually anger). He has saved all her emails (last one being 6 months ago) but won't respond.      How long does it take to get over an ex? She was his first everything....don't know if that makes a difference,
20090202110332AAuB4mS	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Should I see a psychiatrist? ?	Right now I'm a 21 year old college student. My major is International Economics/Business, and I'm not really that happy with it. Yeah, I am semi-interested in it, but it's not what I want I want to do with my life. The problem is, I don't really know what I do want to do. I just don't know that I'm not doing what I want to be doing. Honestly, I don't get enjoyment out of many activities. Part of me actually wants to drop out of college, but I only have a year left, so it's not an option. I just don't know what I want to do. I feel that even if I do get a great job...so what? I'm going to be a wage-slave my whole life and then die. We're all going to die, so what's the point. But it's sort of reassuring that we're all going to die, because it leaves us more freedom to do whatever the hell we want.   Another issue is that I've never been in a relationship, which doesn't bother me so much. I also have no desire for sex. So perhaps I'm asexual. I think society puts way too much emphasis on relationships. People think that if they don't have someone they are incomplete or a loser. Why can't people just be happy alone? Why can't people be happy with themselves? I think there's more to life than relationships and love. What's with society's obsession over love. Because when it comes down to it, if you're not happy with yourself, and don't love yourself, you're not gong to be happy in a relationship. Relationships are not a cure to make yourself happy.   Between school and relationships, I'm just at a very confused point in my life. Society's typical path of good career, marriage, white picket fence, kids is not for me..   On top of everything, I have an extremely overbearing mother who won't stop telling me what jobs to apply for and what to do with my life.
20090202110720AAxgB4m	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys or girls help me!!?	Sorry so long...   Me and my bf have been together for awhile. Our relationship is really long distance. Him in Ohio me in Kansas. Back in December we/he decided I would move, with my 6 yr old, out there in Feb. So the first week of January I put in my notice at my job, a week later they fired me. Because of that I moved out of the house I shared with my room mate and I'm living with my mom.    Now less than a week before I move he doesn't want to do it. His reason is because he is having complications with his house he owns, he got behind on payments from us flying out to each other. The wise choice would be me get out there so I can get a job and helped since I am part of the reason that this happened. But instead he insists I stay here and he will find ways for us to see each other.        My question is should I break up with him? I mean I don't want to break up, I love him with all my heart but he really screwed me over on this. I told him that we would end up breaking up over this, because of everything that happened to me. Job and house. How do I forgive someone for this? Am I being selfish? Please help me!!

20090202111037AA1Uwra	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	His taking revenge on me, it does not make any sense. But still, what should I do. What would you do?	1. We never talked to each other yet, please don't be annoyed. We had an ignorance immaturity fight in between. So I started ignoring him but still cared for him though  2. He cared for me when I started ignoring him and time to time I showed him I still care for him. But then when he wanted to sort out everything by talking (our first conversation together), I refused to do so. Reason is because I thought he would keep hurting me again as before. I am very sensitive girl.  3. Then we were going to have a big break from school, I was shy to talk to him so was he. I thought e-mail would be the best thing to do so, and gave my ad to his friends to give him. Then I received no mail about it.  4. When school started I again ignored him badly. Then I wanted to talk to him and sort things out, he refuses to do so by saying "he has a new girlfriend to his friend to tell me" Which is a lie.  5. He ignores me when I show him my true feelings for him, he is hurting me and I can't stand that. I want to talk to him and sort things out, but then he wants to continue play games and refuse to talk to him.    What should I do? Please help me dear friends. Thanks and take care.

He has conveyed his liking for me in the past, but, I wasn't sure . he then dated his old friend for about 2 months and broke off with her afterwards.    he then, started chasing me again. There is intense chemistry between us, but, no communication has yet started.      Now, I feel confused about this guy. He is taking a lot of long weekends off. I have a feeling that he must have started dating someone else again. But, he still carries on showing interest in me.      What is your opinion? is he really trust-worthy?

20090202110323AAQOqHk	Family & Relationships;Friends	My neighbor has fallen for me, help!?	My husband, myself, and my son have lived in our home for just over a year and a half. In this time we've grown close to our neighbors - but several months ago the fellow broke up with his girlfriend, and she's moved away.     Since we've been here, both my husband and I have talked to him on the phone frequently (to chat) and other friendly things like picnic, parties, etc.     I've noticed lately that he seemed to be calling me up to chat more so when my husband hasn't been here, and today he finally told me that he's basically fallen in love with me and he wishes that I was single because he'd be so happy if I were with him.     I don't want to tell my husband, and I also don't want to speak to this person anymore for obvious reasons.     How can I diffuse this situation without things turning ugly or hurting anyone's feelings?

20090202110104AAA3kgA	Family & Relationships;Family	My fiance's uncle is threatening, forcing, and controlling me, what do I do?	I just recently had problems with my family because of the person I chose to marry and I was stuck with no choice but to move in with my fiance and his uncle and aunt. I mistakenly promised him that I won't talk to or ever communicate to my family in a year until this coming December. Well, a while ago I thought of this and I was thinking that this is way too long to talk to family so I told him, and he said nope, I need to keep my word no matter what. He said that as long as I am living with him I have to listen to what he says, but that he doesn't care what I do once I move out into an apartment. He has forced me to change my cell number so family can't get a hold of me, he has forced me to not respond to any e-mail that they send me, and he has threatened me that if anything happens to my fiance from my family's side that I will get hurt 3 times more. He said that if I have contact with my family again and not tell him, I will be kicked out. To me, that's not love or care as he says he has. I am living in fear, I am trapped, controlled, and forced to do things against my will. My family wonders why I don't call, respond to e-mails, and why I changed my number. This makes me look like some evil family member. It's so hard because this is not me doing this, and I hope that when I decide to talk with them they will talk to me. And my fiance's uncle said that if I do break the promise and talk to my family before December comes, that we are finished, as in he will never talk to me again, and I won't be invited to his home anymore, and this is a controlling mechanism, and that means that I can't see his wife and kids which I really like. So he basically put me on the spot that if I talk to family he is gone, but I would sacrifice him over my family. My family comes first, besides he never treated me like family, I was always treated horrible by him. And I can't move back with my family cause last time I went it caused a huge fight, so me and my fiance are getting an apartment within 2 months from now. At least I will live with no fear, happier, and feel free. My fiance and I are compromising as to when it's best to start talking to my family again, and his uncle won't even respect that. Me and my fiance have decided to start talking to my family in August, after our wedding is over so then we know our wedding won't be destroyed, we don't want to take a chance. To me, as long as my future husband and I agree and talk truthfully, and as long as I tell his uncle what I want to do and how I feel, he has no business with what I do or say to family, especially since I won't be living there this coming March(Thank God) :) Because right now I am very  unhappy, I cry just about everyday and I can't really function like I should, and this is all because of his uncles controlling, threatening, and forcing me to do things against my will. All I want to do right now is at least respond to e-mails, and since I am threatened and forced I can't and my family think that I am being coldhearted. I wish that you know how bad it feels. This is not me doing this, I need prayers that once I do talk to my family they will talk back and not ignore me. My father has already left again because problems arised, and he was never there for me anyways. I am so lucky to have a future husband that respects me, that is willing to compromise even if he doesn't agree, and love me, and work with me on this. Do you think that it's worth it to wait the extra 4 months so I can keep the relationship good with my fiance's uncle, or just stick with my family, and sacrificing for them? Let me know. My fiance is against how his uncle is acting, and we both can't wait to move out. :) I miss my family so bad and it hurts. I was going to go back home that same day that a bad argument happened but his uncle said come live with us, but ever since I stayed there I was and am controlled. I made a mistake in coming to live with them, I should of went back to family that day. But I know deep down in my family's hearts and mine, that when I do talk to them again, they will take me back in and forgive me, they know the hardships that I am going through, and how miserable I look, and that they feel bad for me, as said in the e-mail that my aunt sent me that my uncle said is all a lie and that they hate me. His uncle keeps on admiting that my uncle called him, being worried about me, asking where I am, and on top of it saying that he wishes that me and my fiance are dead. Do you think that is believable? And this hurts that my uncle can't call me but can call my fiance's uncle, and on top of it my fiance's uncle is telling my uncle what to do such as, don't contact anymore, don't e-mail anymore, and that I promised not to talk with them for a year(till december of this year). But I change my mind, and I am going to talk with them sooner when me and my fiance have the apartment, and we both compromise. It's none of my fiance's uncles business with me, my fiance, or m

20090202112929AAkArMw	Family & Relationships;Family	My mother posted my pregnant bride photos on her facebook - how should I deal with this?	My husband and I got married just over a week ago in the Bahamas.  We wanted it to be very private, casual, and discrete, because I am six months pregnant.  We wanted to get married earlier but couldn't because of my job (long story).  We were engaged for 14 months though and very committed to getting married.      Anyway we didn't really want to make a big fuss about the wedding and wanted to do it in private away from very judgmental friends and family members.  So, we went to elope in the Bahamas.  My husband's mother, however, decided to come along at the last minute, and once she decided to come, my mother insisted upon coming too.  We didn't feel like we could tell our mothers not to attend our wedding, so we didn't explain to them that we just wanted it between the two of us.      Anyway, I didn't even notice this during the ceremony because I was so caught up with staring into my new husband's eyes, but my mother took incredible amounts of photos, as did my new mother-in-law.  The day my mother returned, she had pregnant bride photos all over her facebook.  When I say this I mean that somehow, her photos made me look hugely pregnant.  I did not want any pregnant bride photos at all, and certainly not plastered all over facebook for all our friends and family to see.  I asked my mother to remove the pregnant bride photos, and she removed four out of the eighteen she had posted.  The ones left still clearly showed that I was pregnant.  She also put on photos where I had my eyes closed or had a funny expression on my face.  We did not want our wedding to be portrayed in this way.      My question is - how do I explain to my mother forcefully enough that I want her to remove the offending photos?

20090202113127AAvA6nC	Family & Relationships;Friends	We were friends, and now he doesn't talk to me....?	I have a friend. I first asked him to come to my end of the school year party. Once school started back up, we talked more. Then he asked me for advice in asking out a girl. [I have no experiance wat so ever.!] So i gave him as much advice as I could from tv shows and that kind of stuff. He adventually asked her out. And She Laughed and said no! I was so mad at her. We still talked after that. But about a month and maybe a month and a half ago he started to not talk to me! Is he mad at me???? My friends and every one I ask say he likes me, but just recently he sent me about 4 texts saying "Do you know who i like?" Blah blah blah. And I said yeah, blah blah blah. Then he didn't talk to me. But at school, all he does is mearly glance at me in the halls, but doesn't say anything. Awhile back I asked if he was mad at me, and he said no, but he still doesn't talk to me.... Does he hate me????

20090202113029AAIXu8o	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Couple question about sex?	My boyfriend asked me if I would have sex for him tonight, and I was wondering if I should. I've never done it before, but I heard it feels really good. I have masturbated with him before, and let him masturbate me. (when we masturbate together, we get naked, go on the bed, and masturbate next to each other, and sometimes for each other.) Since we have already seen each other naked, he wants to move onto the next step. I have the pills, and he has a condom. I also have vaginal condoms I could use. He was feeling really horny this afternoon, and kept touching my boobs. I don't know if I should, because I heard sometimes guys only date girls for sex. I think I am mature enough, and I am like REALLY horny for him tonight as well, but I don't know if he's the person I should do it with. Or if I should just let him masturbate me tonight, or feel me up. Also, what's the best way (position) to get an orgasm in? One time he gave me an orgasm by masturbating me for me, and one time I let him finger me in the pool. I also don't know if all this sexual behaviour is good. He is my first boyfriend I have dated for 4 months. The first night I met him, I let him touch my boobs. Then on our next date, I caught him masturbating and having an arrection, so I think he is really attracted to me. How do I tell if he really likes me, or if he is just a perv? And should I perform for him?
20090202112627AADvb4Y	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I was talking to this guy and then...?	So me and this guy had been talking and we hung out a few times, and I was thinking that he liked me. But then I looked at his myspace yesterday and saw that he had commented this girl asking "were u at the mall yesterday cus I thought I saw you" she then responded "No I wasnt there" And it bugged me because thats what he first said to me when he first started talking to me. So I started thinking this might be one of his pick up lines or something? Am I wrong?
20090202112634AAC6n0f	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My love story was perfect...until now!?	Okay so this is some serious problems. Alright so i was engaged to this guy but he got sent far away and things started to get a little rough. Well he called one day and cancelled our wedding plans for june without any explanation. Now phone conversations are usually taken the wrong way and well i took this one as a break up. So when he didnt call for the rest of the weekend i knew it was over. So i started hanging out with friends and ended up meeting this really great guy who in a way reminds me of how my "fiance" was when he was here. Well my "fiance" finally called and explained that he didnt want a june wedding that he wanted to be engaged a bit longer that he didnt wanna break up and never once even thought that. I never said anything about the other guy and well just kinda went on with him wanting to engaged. Well this whole past week and weekend went by and still no call from my "fiance" until this morning. He left me a voicemail saying how much he missed me and loved me and all that stuff. I just dont know what to do anymore. Im like ripping my hair out from stressing out so much. I love my "fiance" with all my heart but the other guy...   I feel like im in the notebook except the "other guy" is my Noah. Except this love story doesnt have an ending yet because i dont know what to do.   Keep in mind that Im leaving in 3 weeks from where the "other guy" is and might not ever see him again unless he really is my noah. And my "fiance" is coming home in June to see me. I dont know wat to do. I love my fiance and i really like the other guy. Please dont judge this is hard enough as it is. Just some positive advice please.      Note: The fiance and i only talk on weekends now bcuz time differences are not on our side and i cannot call to where he is. And the other guy doesnt know about my fiance so dont blame him for being with "another mans girl"      I really wanna be with my fiance. I love him. But im afraid if i tell him i'll lose him bcuz everyone in his past has hurt him and i promised i wouldnt and i did. Im like in tears saying this right now. I dont know what to do to keep him. I dont wanna lose him. Ahhhhhh Help me.

ANSWER?   if your girlfriend has a past of cheating on you, whether it be drunk or sober, and you stopped talking to her for 5 months, and during these 5 months you got involved with a classy girl that has self respect and would never cheat and was very traditional and you developed feelings with her, but then this classy girl got busy with her job and you two sort of lost contact for a while, so the cheating ex gf came back into the picture and you remebered how much you loved her      would you give the cheating ex girlfriend another try to work things out since you loved her, or stick with the classy girl who you did have feelings for her to see if it could develop into something worthwhile?

I have been seeing a guy for a while who i met in the summer and ive had tarot readings and they all say hes genuine and he cares about me and they describe him to a t my problem is i don't feel he makes an effort i could see us having future id ont think he can.      He has been honest with me about the fact he is bi polar    we get on well if he has an episode i will let him know im here for him    and that i care yet if i go on a downer of have a bad day he says nothing.      I compliment him and i get accused of being a liar the only compliment ive had is that im fit.   A few weeks ago during an episode he told me that he didnt do girlfriends and didnt want one which hurt me.      We do hold hands and kiss in public which is good.      Sometimes he ignores me and doesnt bother to reply yet we were meant to see each other today but couldn't to weather and he seemed gutted and disappointed.      I told him yesterday that i cared about him and all he said back was it snowing. Its hard cos he goes hot and cold on me i never know where i stand he rejects me and i want to feel affection which he can give.      I said a few weeks ago that i was never going to get married and he said but you would marry me wouldn't you ?   i just end up feeling confused and never knowing where i stand Sometimes i feel he doesn't care or is it just he cant show it

Hello,   I am 18 and have been dating my boyfriend for over two years now. I really do love him, and know he cares about me as well. However, we've never told each other "i love you". It bothers me because i would regret it if something happened to him and i never told him how i felt. My question is, under these circumstances, do you think it is okay for the girl to say i love you first? Im concerned because he keeps his emotions to himself and im worried that if i say it to him he will be put off and it might make thing in our relationship ackward. Also, I really only want to hear the words back from him if he truly means it, which is why i have not said it yet. Let me know what you guys think... thanks!

20090202112809AAD9JHD	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Need advice about boyfriend?	My boyfriend and I have been together 3 years. I moved in with him last spring, basically by giving him an ultimatum He wasn't ready to do it but I did. Anyways, I have learned a lot about him since this has happened. I have found that he does NOT shower every day. The last time he showered was January 25. It has been one week! He hasn't even changed his underwear! I am disgusted and don't even want him to touch me because all I think about is his lack of showering. He doesn't even care about how he looks anymore. He hasn't shaved in weeks.    Another thing is that he gets so drunk that he can't even function. He can barely hold keep his eyes open and speak clearly. He is a sloppy drunk.      He usually wants to hang out with a younger crowd. There are often high school kids at the house drinking throughout the week. He is 30 years old! When will it end?      I am thinking about breaking up with him and moving out. This is not what I want. I just don't want to lose the group of friends we hang out with, although most of them are friends of mine from high school.      Am I making the right choice? I don't think he will ever change.

20090202112905AALp1Qs	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What draws the line between being confident and arrogant?	some say confidence is more a personality thing.  such as you believe you have good personality.  where as arrogance is more of a narcissistic behavior that typically focuses on physical beauty.     just want to hear different opinions on this matter.  seems as if there is a thin line between the two terms at times.

I have liked him for a good 3 months now. We talk all the time on msn and we see each other sometimes because my dad and his dad run a football team together.      while speaking on msn he told me he would kiss me but doesnt really want to get with me. he didnt say why but im guessing its because of age difference, he's 3 years older than me. we are like best mates too even though we dont see each other that much       ive never had a relationship witha anyone and only ever kissed one boy at a disco that i never even knew!   what should i do?!      thank you so much..   please could you give detailed answers...      lucy x
20090202113132AAhd4Wk	Family & Relationships;Family	How can someone who lives with one parent go to court and try to change the custody agreement ?	Hi, I am a 17 year old who lives with his mom. My parents were divorced a long time ago . And the custody agreement was I was allowed to see my Dad every other weekend. Well now my Dad is moving to Hawaii and I would like to go with him for a month or so, but my Mom is not allowing it. Both my mom  and my dad do well finacially and both are good caring parents. But i would like to be able to Go with my father . Him leaving obviously doesn't allow me much time unless I fly to go see him. When I ask my Mom If i can go she laughs and says no. I asked why she said she doesn't need a reason. How could I change the custody agreement so Legally I would be allowed to spend time with Him. He wants me to go with him this week coming up. Schooling is not an issue because I do online schooling so I can do it anywhere in the U.S. What do I do. I know the court weighs my opinion in the case. But How would I go about this?
20090202113142AAeo0zt	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Phone calls from the middle of nowhere?	At the risk of sounding paranoid:      For the last 4-5months, I've been getting phone calls on my cell phone from phone numbers I don't recognize. When I do a reverse look up of the phone numbers on the Internet, they're always from somewhere in the middle of nowhere, miles away from any city. The phone calls have come from what appear to be residences in Alabama, Michigan, Illinois, among other states. I don't call the numbers back because I'm concerned that it's my ex being disruptive.       Any insights into why people in the middle of nowhere are calling my cell phone? (Wasn't sure how to categorize this...)

Je déteste cette intolérance de la part des fran?ais (moi qui les aime bien d'habitude) à nous traiter d'imbéciles, de fades, d'idiotes, c'est vraiment lourd.      Un exemple: quand un homme dit préférer les brunes, on lui colle un pouce en haut. Quand un homme dit préférer une blonde, pouce en bas O_o

20070408005106AAk3SoB	Family & Relationships;Family	What to do about a mom that seems not to like my as much as my sisters?	Okay heres the problem: I live with my mom, my dad, and my 3 sisters which 2 of then are older than me by 5 and 4 years and the the other one is my baby sister whos 4 years old. I'm the 3rd child and it's very hard on me..My mom is very overprotective that she won't let me get my eyebrows done or go anywhere unless she is there. She seems to judge all of my friends just by looking at them when they say bye to me at school. I can't wear makeup, get contacts, or stay a minute after school unless it has to do with school activities. Now when I asked her again if I could go to a Bat Mitzvah she keeps on saying no. I tell her to give me a reason and all she says is no. We end up screaming at each other and my whole family goes to her side complaining I scream to much. My dad does noting and my sister saids she's going to slap me if I don't shut up. I really don't like my family some times and especially when my baby sister rubs it in my face that she's better! What do I do I'm sick of it!

20070529185440AAUTdN6	Family & Relationships;Family	This is for any parents with kids in their 20s, or ppl with experinece in this area, please help me!!!?	My boyfriend and I want to get married, we're 21 and 22. We've thought of just about everything, we're thinking that we'll get married next year after he graduates from college and has a full time job; we know that we'd live in an apartment for a while; with us being married, I'd get financial aid(I don't get it now b/c my parents make too much money); we don't want to have kids until we've paid off our college loans(we're thinking even longer, like 30); and since we're both Diabetic, we'd get health insurance settled first because that's almost as important as our financial problems.    I guess my question is, If your child came to you with all this information and proof that they're not just jumping into it head first and put some thought into it, would you have any objections? What would they be? What would you say to your child? Do you have any experience with this situation? What happened?

20080507062929AA8yUuV	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Pourquoi ce culte de l'acte sexuel?	Par exemple, l'acharnement que les gens mettent à distinguer entre "baiser" et "faire l'amour", surtout chez les filles? Le sentimentalisme n'est pas mon fort, pourtant je ne le blame pas. Ce que je voudrais savoir, c'est pourquoi ce besoin de justifier sans arrêt, à chaque fois qu'elles changent de partenaire, qu'elles y mettent du coeur et de l'ame, afin de dire finalement, me semble-t-il, qu'elles ne sont pas n'importe qui? Personnellement, je pense que si c'est le cas, on n'aurait pas besoin de le spécifier, on se ficherait de tout ce que les autres puissent en penser. C'est d'ailleurs mon cas...       Merci des pensées sincères.       Rubrique: amour de soi.

I know it was bad for me to swear but, my dad sometimes swear too, and my mom. Does he have any right to lecture me about not swearing? He said "where did you learn that foul language?" Obviously I learned it from him and my mom. Sometimes when he drives he swears, and whenever mom's mad she swears too, but I come I am not allow to swear? It doesn't mean I want to swear. I don't want to swear, but I am just confused.

J'ai une relation intime avec une jeune fille depuis maintenant 2 semaines, tout ce passe bien, elle est assez libérée, bon bien sur, je ne compte pas en faire ma femme, je veux juste m'amuser un peu, mais je voulais garder un souvenir.      Sans lui dire, j'ai donc filmer nos ébats à l'aide d'une caméra habilement dissimulée (c'est pas la première fois que je le fais, donc j'arrive a bien placer la caméra mainteant). Il y a quelques jours, un pote vient me rendre visite et je lui montre la vidéo.      Ma copine l'a appris (surement ce salaud qui lui a dit, on ne peut pas compter sur nos amis...) et me fais la gueule depuis... Trouvez vous cela normal, après tout on à fait ce film un peu tous les deux ensembles non? Pensez vous que je doive la menacer de le mettre sur internet si elle veut me quitter? Merci pour vos conseils.

Mais voilà hier j'ai appris que ce n'etait pas moi qui lui donne ces envies mais il avait déjà toutes ces envies avant de me connaitre. Alors je me sens un peu dé?ue, j'ai l'impression d'être un objet qui lui sert à relaiser ses fantasmes, même si lui me dit que c moi qui lui donne envie de les realiser. Il ne comprend pas que je sois dé?ue... Et vous??? Qu'en pensez vous??? Est-ce que cela est normal??? Et est-ce quand même de l'amour??? Merci mes amis.

He is the hottest, sweetest, sexiest guy I think I've dated. During this short period, we've been spending a lot of time together (dates, sleep overs, etc.) when I'm not with him, he's all I'm thinking about.  Am I'm just infatuated by new romance or could I really be in love?  And, is it too soon to reveal how I feel to him?  I don't want to scare him away.

Like, I don't know what a good looking guy looks like because I am not gay, but I am good looking.  We are all smart.  Why would we be single?  I mean, I know I am not usually one to initiate things with girls.  But, still, why would this be the case?  The only friend I know with a girl friend has average looks and is not as smart as the other guys.  I know that there is more to it than being smart and good looking.  But, I am also a very nice person and a great listener.  Why don't girls hit on me?  I mean, I don't care from week to week, but sooner or latter I am going to be 35 and still single if I don't change something!  What am I missing?

I don't know what to think.

My ex-boyfriend dumped me one year ago & we only dated for shotr while. We never had sex cz he knew I'm saving myself for marriage. He would still contact me on msn even though HE ended it. 2 months ago he called me & planned a whole thing, a movie. Two days later he picked me up, we saw the movie, then he drove me home. I asked him why he wanted to see me after all this time, he said "I wanna see u every once in awhile". I felt like the date was rushed so when i got home, I went on msn & said bye forever to him, he said sorry but I logged out. I went on msn a week later to apologize & he seemed very happy & fine & said he wasn't mad at all. Then he went on a trip. When he came back, i asked him on msn how it was. Then 2 weeks ago I said hi to him again. He hasn't said hi to me on msn since out li' meetup.Is he ignoring me & did I scare him off? What's going through his mind now? He's 26 while I'm 21.

20090204180305AArgLjk	Family & Relationships;Friends	I accidentally hurt my friend. (physically) and i think she's still holding the grudge.?	At school, me and my friend are in the same gym class. We've playing hockey, (boys play separately) anyways all the girls are super competitive (including me, kinda) but my friend isn't really. Today we played on opposing teams. When it was my turn to be center, she was defense. When the puck came in my direction i was about to hit it toward the goal, but she tried to stop me, and our hockey sticks clashed really hard, and I accidentally hit her right above her ankle with the hockey stick. i apologized as soon as I found out. (she had a blueish bruise) I still got the point cause the puck made it into the goal, but I felt really bad. well, i apologized a few times and she said she was fine, but I think that she thinks that I did it on purpose, and she's holding a grudge. (she wouldn't really talk to me for the rest of the day)

20090204145550AAKK2iQ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does he have a crush on me?	I've thought for a while one of my friends has a crush on me, but I'm not completely sure. My boyfriend had a birthday a couple of months ago and I went shopping with his friend, who's also my friend and he advised that I could get some sexy lingerie and wrap it up and give it to him as a present and then later in the evening I could wear it for my bf. He even went to Victoria's Secret  and helped me pick out something for the occasion.   Then last night, I got in a fight with my bf and I txt him "we got in a fight, i guess i have to talk to him, I don't want to go to bed so upset at him" and he txt me back "go put that outfit on" and I said "no, he doesn't want to even talk to me" and he replied "you should do it, that'll sure make him speechless"       I was really mot expecting that from him, so now I'm starting to think that he does have a crush on me. Am I paranoid? Any thoughts?

Ok there is this girl (isn't there always!) and shes very flirtatious with me (and only me). Things that you expect from someone trying to get your attention.

20090204174917AAThtab	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does the guy always have to make first move?	Seems that girls want you to chase them rather them them chase after guys. Girls may want to ask a guy out but are usually too scared or are waiting for the guy to make a move. If the guy does not make the first move the girl might mistake this for disinterest and then she will never ask him out for fear of rejection. So I think that guys will probably always be the ones to make the first move rather than the girl.

20090204142228AAXFuvo	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Did I handle this situation well?	Ok,   This morning, I asked this guy named Gary* if he could sit next to me in Algebra later on and help me with the work, he sad "Sure, why not"    (So he sometimes hangs out with this girl named Linda*)  So at the lunch table I reminded Gary if he was going to sit next to me in Algebra and assist me with my work and he assured me once again.        So...............by the time we got to Algebra class Linda started whining  and pleading talking about "No...Gary, sit next to me,...."    [Keep in mind where I sit is two empty seats next to me,  so I proposed that Gary could sit in the middle and Linda and I could sit   side by side him and everyone's satisfied]    Right...........? :)    WRONG  :(    Linda kept whining and saying that she doesn't want to sit "over there" where I sit at.    I plead with her, "LINDA,.....you have a passing grade in this class and I have an F, could you please be more reasonable?! "    She just pouted and started acting immature, so I pleaded with   Gary and he just started acting like an innocent little kid  and started making baby whines and whined to me "I don't know".    And sat right back to Linda,      Ok, I said skip it,  and just forgot about it, But mostly got angry    But it's weird, how can people just not have feelings for each other,  shouldn't people want to help others?!?    I mean, I'm in the Eleventh grade for god sake's, it sounds as if I presented a kiddie scenario for you guys!    [But, people have warned me that Gary is a *****, but I didn't think it was THAT bad..........]      What do you guys suggest I do, should I confront both Gary and Linda, about my feelings..........?, or just say "**** IT " & leave it alone and switch classes or something........    But did I handle it well, considering I have a BAD attitude......

20090204154124AAhaGtf	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why do girls always fall for the wrong guy?	Like, there's this one guy, he's a very good friend, he's always been there for me and he's smart, nice, etc.  He's what you would call the 'good guy'.   Then there's this other guy.  He makes me smile and such, but he's a bit of a troublemaker and is what you would call the 'bad guy'.   I know that the second guy will probably be bad for me and end up hurting me, but yet I still like him.  I don't find myself attracted to the good guy, I just like him as a friend.  And I kindof hate that.   Does anyone feel the same way, or have any opinions about this?  I don't know if it's just me...

20090204164458AAXTwZK	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why didn't she talk to me? Do you think she likes me?	There is a girl who I like and who likes me back. I saw from the way she flirts by looking at me and smiling at me. She doesn't look at any other guy like that and she was flirting with me while she was dancing. But she didn't talk to me really. I said hi to her one time, and she responded by saying hi in a very low voice. What does this mean? Is it normal for teen girls to flirt with their crushes but to ignore them. She didn't talk to me once, but she looked at me a lot. I really want to know why she showed this behavior towards me if she likes me!

But now im falling in love with her, after i got to know her more i am really in love with her. but the thing is she has or had a bf we never talked about him when we talk. but the last time we talked about him she said that there having some problems. so my question is how do i asked her whats the deal with him and her? without sounding like i want to be more than friends? well i want to but if she says that they are together i still want to be friends with her.

20090204172203AAzKXzw	Family & Relationships;Friends	Is this girl stalking me?	There's this girl in high school who I see a lot of lately. She's always near where I am and she makes eye contact with me a lot. but while all the above is true, so is the fact that she just happens to hang out near where I do (she's been hanging out there for 2 years) and she never really tries to talk to me.     When she does she stampers and refuses to look me in the eye. That's kinda annoying. She's the smart type and she talks to everyone else normally enough not to mention that she seemed pretty cool with me before.     during lunch I had a friend of my watch her to see if she was watching me. My friends say that she glanced my way occasionally. She always seems to hang out after school alone and she says that her ride picks her up late.     However as my friend seems to like pointing out, she never attempts to follow me or call me. Plus she's always gone by the time I come from basketball practice. What do I do? Am I being over paranoid?

20090204182122AAzN3WB	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is this an ok way to ask this girl out?	At the beginning of my second term in college I started a speech class. There was this really hot girl in their...I basically stared at her the entire time when I gave my speech. The course is almost over and we have two classes left. Two classes ago she started to sit next to me. I guess I've flirted with her while she's there and she seems like she's flirting back...I've never been great at asking girls out so I plan to just give her my number on the last day...is this a cool idea? if it is how should I approach it?
20090204180736AAppkP6	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	He's REALLY pissing me off! What to do?	So an old aquaintance texted me a few weeks ago and we've been talking ever since.     A couple weeks ago, he called me and asked if I wanted "to meet up for coffee or something at like 7", I said sure. He said he'd call me/text me the next day with details. He never did. He did this same exact thing 1 week ago, for a second time.    Yesterday he again asked the same thing, and he even suggested a time again (7:00), but said he'd call me today with details. He just texted me "hey" at 6:00, and I'm kind of pissed that he waited all day. Why is he doing this- forgetting plans and doing things last minute?    I know what you're thinking- "why don't YOU just call/text him?!" but it's the principle of the thing and I don't want to seem desperate or clingy or something.     Well, he needs to know that I'm not on call 24/7, so I want to tell him that I'm busy tonight. Is this too bitchy or unreasonable?

20070209200916AAsvm8O	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What is up with this girl?	she is new at school and we talk once. We talk about our school history and religion. She told me she lives with her grandmother and she goes to this big church. She told me she used to go to private school and she had to wear a dress and she didn't like it. So she now goes to the public school. She also said that our class feels like it's summer school. Are conversation ended when are 10 min break was over and back to work. I was leaving early right when break was over. She told me she was leaving in 2 hours. Anyways She said she was a loser and she walk back to class and I told her no your not. And that was it we both walk away and headed in different directions. I thought the conversation was going good, but she was doing most of the talking. Why do you think she called her self a loser for? She sound kinda serious when she called her self a loser. Maybe she thought I was bored with our conversation. Next day in class I was doing my work and this girl ask for a piece of gum and the girl im interested was sittin behind me and she ask for a piece too. I gave both of them a piece and the girl i'm interested said i'm sorry for bothering you and I said that's alright. I was going to say something than she puts her head down and goes back to work. She didn't have any friends when she was new now she has 4-5 friends, but 1 that's really her true friend which he's gay btw. Anyways when she walks past me she won't even look at me. I hate when a girl ignores you like that. I'm not gonna talk to her unless she looks at me because to me that just seems like she doesn't want anything to do with me. In a way I kinda like her. What's up with her?

20090204160236AAdvM7k	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I really like this guy but idk what to do!!?	Okay...last year I have gone on the tennis team at my school and there was this cute guy that I really like. We were really good friends and we would talk and have fun together. This year all of that changed.   I started talking a lot to his best friend. I also talked to his brother. They both like me. And so he and his best friend hanged out and they tell me they wish I was with them. I was surprised and so I tried talking to him but he ignores me. He saw me at school that day and winked and said hi to me and then on msn he wouldnt answer me. He told me that he will delete me if i didnt stop talking to him. What the hell is wrong with him?!?! I really like him but I don't know what to do!! He also flirts a lot with me before he started ignoring me.   P.S He has a gf but she moved to Venezuela.

In 1st grade, John and i went to the same elemantary school. In 2nd gr, we played this game called "Boys vs. Girls"idk as 2nd graders we made this up. It was me vs. him in tag. We were lik friends. l had a crush on him. Then for 3rd grade, he went to a private school. For 4th grade i happened to go there to. I remember the 1st day of school, he looked at me lik "omg wat're u doin here." So he became popular and lets just say im not.   Anyway im about to list a couple of things he's done plz number ur answers for each answer. then give an overall all anyalysis.    1. we were in church one day and he was in front of me. he stretches then turns around . he sees me then quickly turns back around.  2. our desks are arranged in groups of two. my friend sits next to me. when he goes to sharpen his pencil, he drags his hand over her desk then stops when my desk is there.   3. my friend eats pretzels for snack. so he eats some of hers sometimes. so wen she forgets her snack one day, she take ssome of my snack, -no big deal. so she offers him some of mine. he doesnt want any.    These are just a couple. ill post more if i remember. plz answer/    This is how you would answer:   1.(add coment)    2. (add coment)    3.

20090204174018AAjOHzf	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Can u fall in love with someone online?	I dont think u can.      my reasons:   they could be someone else entirely      they could pretend to be a better person then they are.      you can lie easily online      you cant actually see them      opposing reason:      people could be more of themselves online and not feel intimated to open up like you are when you are face to face with someone.      meet more people      easier to communicate      video messages      -what do you think?
20090204181334AAGgbGi	Family & Relationships;Friends	What do i do about annoying friends?	so i used to be best friends with this group of girls. but they were all bitches and hoes so i sorda separated my self and found some other friends. They are all so nice to me and are alot of fun. they are good friends but one of them seems to cause alot of drama. she is so annoying too! like everything we talk about with her is about her and her problems and she is a really big gossip and a bad secret kepper. other then that she is super nice and really funny! we have tried to tell her we dont like her gossip and like that she annoys us some times. we have said it nicely and we have screamed at her nothing works. I am scared if i tell her i don't want to be her friend then she will make stuff up about me and cause a lot of drama. and then ill be losing more of my friends. I left my old friends to get away from all the back stabbing and drama.    am i being a bad friend for telling her she is annoying? how can i get her to stop gossiping and talking about her self all the time?       thank you so much!

20090204180021AAGjP6n	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does this girl seem intersted in me?	I'm in college and there's this girl that sits by me. To me she is the prettiest girl i have ever seen and its funny because i have only felt about this with one girl in my life. I can say i like her even if i don't know her, i even had a dream about her. The first day i saw here we were sitting across the classroom and would just glance at each other for a second and look away we never caught eyes but i knew she was looking at me. The second was that i was coming into class she was looking at me and then when i looked at her in her eyes she looked away but later that day i was walking to my desk and she was just looking down. I talked to her for a second asking her a simple question she did give a one word answer which i heard wasn't a good thing but the next time i answereda question she seemed liked she got a little bit elaborate in her question and she was smiling which i don't know if it was a funny question or ot because it was just about a grade but i was smiling also which i do all the time and she kinda giggled. She sits right next to me and another thing that puzzles me is that she can sit anywhere on that row and she deideds to sit where she would think i would sit, and i was thinking about one da sitting down before she did and see if she will still sit there.and today we were leaving class at the same time which she seemed to take her time to walk out the door with me, and when we were finally got out i didn't eve talk to her ad she seemed to walk with me until we got to the end of the hallway and she just went her own way cuz i guess she thought i wasn't going to talk to her. and she does seem to glance at me once in a while during class i think but she is looking but i can see her looking my way. and she tends to shake her leg at times. I just want to know if i should talk to her or something?

20090204172014AAPohtX	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Another one of those guy problems... help?	okay... well..   There is this guy I have like for...uhh... maybe... 3 years now?   (ever since he was in 8th and I was in 6th; im in 8th now and hes in 10th)   He rides my bus and everything.. we talk.. sometimes... and we are friends.. he always says he loves me.. all the time (but he does it to pretty much everyone else to)   and he use to ask if I wanted to hold hands and I always said no cause he had a girlfriend (and i figured he was kidding anyways)      well, him and his on-and-off girlfriend finally broke up, for good.   and he started talking to me more and everything..      Then over christmas brake he started going out with someone from my class... someone I dislike..      so I talked to him.. and I still don't know why I did this.. but I confessed that I like him and everything..   he said he was sorry cause he was already dating her and stuff and I said i understand, but I don't want this to ruin our friendship and he said it wouldn't...      but when we got back to school he stopped talking to me...   and the whole "I love yous"   But then she broke his heart after 2 months or so..   and I know he still loves her..      well today he said he loved me again.. for like the first time in forever...   and he said bye to me after I got off the bus... and something about myspace.. i dont know..   but could this mean he is starting to like me to?   cause his friends are being nicer to me now.. and saying hi and bye...      but I'm a really shy girl.. I dont talk that much.. at all.. and I know it bugs him cause he says it does..      and I really like him... but I dont know what to do..   should I move on or what?

20061112211133AALmo8b	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	So what happened?	i had sex with a friend. we were friends with benefits for a few weeks, but he said i was getting too close. now, admittedly, i do like him as more than a friend. but i would never push him into something. we are friends again, but had some adjustment aurguments because of the intimacy we once shared. i asked him if the sex was bad or something, and he said 'no, the sex was great, but i only think of you as a friend.' i said 'i know that, i never asked for promises, just a date when you're ready.'       now he doesn't want to touch me or hug me or anything.  i asked him what the other girls he is talking to have that i don't and he said he had more in common with them because they have children, like he does.  he said 'i do love you as a friend, even like a sister...' which seriously freaked me out.      i never thought a GUY would go akward in these situations.       was the sex bad for him, and he is just lying? or did he think he could devlop some feelings and decided to back off? or did he just lose interest because of these other girls?

20080520030601AAVOVPO	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Suis-je trop exigente ?	Bonjour à tous !      Ca fait maintenant 2 ans et demi que je suis avec mon copain et un an que j'habite chez lui (enfin chez ses parents). J'ai tout quitté pour lui (famille, boulot, copains), car on habiter à 300km l'un de l'autre. Au début tout était rose maintenant il sort un soir sur 2 voir ses copains (il rentre à 3-4h du mat') et sinon il passe sa soirée sur l'ordi (jusqu'à 2h) pour jouer à counter-strike, parler à ses copinEs via msn, ou matter quelques sites ... de je ne sais quoi ! Au final pas de sorties en amoureux, et je me couche toute seule tout le temps. On est ensemble de 20h à 23h tous les jours car je reste à coté de lui pendant qu'il joue :/      Suis-je vraiment trop exigente ou est-ce lui qui est immature comme je le pense ?      Je sent que je vais péter un cable dans pas longtemps et pourtant je l'aime :-(      Merci à tous   bisous

Les filles, connaissez-vous ce sentiment lorsque vous voyez un chaton ou un chiot, à la TV ou en vrai, et qu'il vous vient une irrésistible envie de les prendre dans vos bras pour leur faire un calin? Vous les trouvez tellement craquant que vous avez envie de les toucher, vous connaissez ?a?      Et bien, c'est exactement ce que ressentent les hommes lorsqu'ils voient une jolie femme (c'est ce que m'a avoué mon copain hier soir).   Il m'a dit que les hommes ont des pulsions irrésistibles et que dès qu'ils voient une belle paire de fesses ou de seins, ou encore une femme avec des beaux yeux, ils ne peuvent pas s'empêcher d'avoir du désir pour elle et d'avoir envie d'elle et de la toucher. Il m'a dit que tous les hommes sont fait pareils et que ceux qui disent le contraire sont des menteurs qui ne veulent pas blesser leur partenaire, mais qu'en fait les hommes passent leur temps à désirer d'autres femmes que la leur.      Bon j'apprends rien de nouveau, mais le fait qu'il m'ait dit ?a m'a déprimé du coup...j'ai comme le sentiment d'être trahie...c'est dur de se dire qu'il peut ressentir du désir pour n'importe qui d'autre que moi...      Qu'en pensez-vous, est-ce vrai selon vous?   Messieurs, êtes-vous d'accord avec ?a?   Les filles, qu'en pensez-vous?

Puis à 18 ans j'ai rencontré quelqu'un dont je suis tombée follement amoureuse, avec qui sexuellement c'est devenu très bien, mais j'ai découvert qu'il ne me respectait pas et couchait avec d'autres filles.   Par la suite, j'ai continué à le voir juste pour le sexe car je ne peux pas faire l'amour avec quelqu'un d'autre, je n'ai confiance en personne, je n'imagine pas que l'on puisse m'aimer, et je n'imagine pas que quelqu'un d'autre que lui pourra me trouver jolie.

And he always goes to the same clubs i go to once he hears me saying im going, knows my schedule and passes me in the hallway, and always sits across from me on the bus.  I though he liked me because he's always flirting, agreeing w/ my opinion, and sticking up for me.  Like today on the bus this kid was yelling at me for not inviting him to a party I had and he turned around and said, "well I wouldn't invite you either!  Leave her alone! Seriously man!"  And since the kid was a freshman he shut up. =] He always passes me in the hall and smiles and goes out of his way to talk to me.  Plus today I was wearing a skirt and a low cut shirt and he couldn't stop staring at me.  He was looking at my boobs, butt or legs the whole time.  Do you think he's just a perv and doesn't like me for my personality but for my looks? [I have pretty big boobs, and a toned butt and thighs from cheerleading, soccer, and lax] But, the problem is he is a senior and I am a sophomore.  Would he ever like me?  Do you think he does?????  Or does he just like looking at me????

20081115082722AAWhOIy	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	So now what do I do? Please HELP!!!?	My husband and I were together for 7 years. We recently separated.   I am pretty torn up about it, but he said that maybe a few months apart would help us gain some prospective on our relationship. We both agreed that we would not see other people while we were separated. I have the kids and am staying with a friend but I can't stay here very long, since my friend is strapped for cash and I have to commute my daughter 20 minutes for school.  I've spent the past 5 years raising our two daughters 5 & 3. Now I have to get a job, find an apartment and pay for childcare. In my area I would need at least 12.50 an hour to be able to afford it and that's only if my husband agrees to pay half of the childcare expenses. But I only have a GED and no formal education above that. I dropped out when I had my oldest daughter and then got my GED only a few weeks ago.   My husband and I are separated but not legally, so is there anyway I could get any assistance? My husband says he'll pay my car payment since he got it for me a year ago as a surprise gift. But he hasn't said anything about helping with the kids other than to see them whenever he can. So what am I supposed to do now?   He works two jobs as a firefighter and paramedic, but doesn't make much. So i feel bad asking him for money. He controlled all the money when we were together, I was never even on his bank accounts. I'd really like to do this on my own but I have no idea how to go about it! Please help!

(meaning he needs to help them) he says it is not for or out of love it is just to help them. he says i have no reason to be upset or mad. but i think it is very serious. it is not short process. it could take years. (3, 4 years even!! ?) they have to take pictures together, make joint accounts.... And now he just told me that the person he has to marry to 'help' is the same person who introduced him to the person who helped HIM get HIS papers. he says he 'owes' them had it not been for them he would not be here. It seems like a noble act yes, but do I have to deal with all that comes with it? all these things that he has to do that will 'prove' that they are really married. Makes me sick to my stomach. He accuses me of ‘not trusting him’ and that’s why I feel this way and if I trusted him I wouldn’t care. i can't help but feel so helpless and hurt. i love him, but i cant be put through this type of turmoil. should i just leave and get on with my life?

20090204132306AAmxpSQ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	About ex-bf, is this weird?	Me and this guy met online. He replied to my personal posting. After dating for a year and half we broke up. Now he asks me to email back  his original reply to my posting, because he wants to "reply to other personal postings", because "that one works". But to me I think it's very weird and it hurts a bit. Even though we met online but I still think it's a unique chance not like sending 100 resumes to job postings. Do you think this is weird?

20090204141135AAFB41m	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Looking for impossible perfection?	Do you think there is a future with us? Here are his pros and cons. We have been together for over 4 years.       Pros - he is unconditionally loving, extraordinarily trustful, nice, sweet, sensitive, talks about his feelings, takes care of me, gives great back rubs, wonderful cook, supportive, has a good job, my best friend, spoils me.      Cons - Different way of living life (me=planner, him=take life as it comes), doesn't motivate me to do things together, VERY hard to get him to try new things, isn't as "outdoorsey" as I am, he is very dependent and clingy, he needs WAY more attention than I can give to him, we have religious differences, we are incompatible in the bedroom.      I just wonder if i'd be happier with someone else, or if i'm looking for perfetion. Can find someone your compatible with after 30? Thoughts on everything?

He's in my gym class and he was paired up with this more outgoing girl and they seem to have a connection too. I like him. Should I wait for him, ask him how he feels, or just move on? I have no idea. He's driving me crazy. Since the quarter ended I don't have art with him anymore and I barely talk to him anymore. I like him so much and can't stand to see him talk to other girls.

20090204152215AAaHvP5	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What's wrong in this relationship?	I was in a long distance relationship with a guy for nearly 4 years when, early this year, out of nowhere he told me he thought we already broke up. I just went to see him late last year and, up to one week after I left he left, said he missed me and so on. Then out of nowhere, around 2 weeks after we met, he said he's going overseas, and when he came back he didn't contacted me.       I contacted him and he said that he thought we were broken up. He later on confessed that he is seeing another girl. How could this be, as I just went from seeing him and he lovingly looks after me almost all of the time? He always said that he's sure that he would never find someone as good as I am, but how come he decided to left me like this? How long can a guy love another woman? He said guys could not love just one woman, is this right?   Last, I had a habit of talking on the phone for a long time (like around one hour, but never reached two) and he said he hated it, but I didn't realised about it. Could it be the reason why he decides about this?      What can I do to forget him faster?       Thank you for your answers.

We used to text each other all the time and I secretly liked her, but I never told anyone. Once, she texted me and said she liked me and I was so cute and I asked her out. She said she liked this other guy too who I don't know, so she didn't want a boyfriend and I said alright. We promised not to tell anyone what had happened between us. After that, she never texted me first like she did before i askedd her out. I would always be the one to text her first, but she always responded. She seems to have acted different after I asked her out.Every timee I see her, she acts like we are best friends and she hugs me.

20090204155056AA6MURO	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Advice with Girls plz?	alright..Hes some back round info: I'm a sophomore in highschool I'm tall( not ridiculously tall), musclebound ( got an 8-pack, pecs, whole 9--yards), and good looking ( i don't mean to sound cocky, even though i probably do) but I'm pretty shy. There is this girl right she is drop dead gorgeous and really nice, we really don' t hang out much, outside of school, but we have common friends. I like her a lot like when i see her like i forget to breath, my hearts skips a beat, i know it sounds corny, but its true, I've talked to her a couple times, and i think she likes me back, or at least attracted to me, when we see each other in the halls she gives me the whole look up down thing, or we just make eye contact and smile, and say high to each other. However she has a boyfriend who is a senior, and he is a real asshole, and doesn't treat her the way she should be treated. I have no problem waiting for them to break up ( They have before, but got back together like a week later), and i know to give her some time once they do.        Can anyone give me any advice, or some conversation starters to help me with talking to her more, and getting to know her better?    Thanks in advance

I know I'm shy and I'm willing to step out of my shell so he can see how good of a person I am...does somebody have some advice for me?

20090204161603AAMWUvM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Are most guys jerks like him?	Ok so my bf and i have recently broken up. The reason he gave me for the break up was that things have sorta changed, and i am too short for him. We dated a few months back for 3 months andthen we got back together and dated for one and apparently he grew a little when we were apart. He said when he was shorter we looked good together but now he feels he doesnt belong next to me. I guess the only reason we broke up was because of my height. I mean i am a little short but im a dancer, i love hockey, i have a really good sense of humor, im smart and my friends say im cute. I guess my confidence has taken a blow since then and now i am super self conscious. Are there still guys out there that are not so superficial and do not care about their image with a girl they have feelings for?

20090204161639AATfHmv	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I like him so much, but he has a girlfriend! What should I do?	I recently started talking to this guy, and he is absolutely amazing. He has just about every attribute that I could possibly look for in someone. However, he has a girlfriend! I don't know though....he's told me that he likes me a lot and has sent me text messages saying things like:   - You are attractive to me in every aspect, no matter what.   - You make me happy all the time by simply talking to me. You're pretty amazing.   - I love laying next to you and just talking. I could do that forever.   - I wish you were with me all the time. It's crazy.   We've also had a few...dirty conversations, late at night. I know if I was his girlfriend I wouldn't appreciate him saying these things to another girl...but I really, really like him. I'm not sure if I should ask if he plans on ending things with her, or if I should avoid the topic all together. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated. Thanks! :)
20090204161707AAUfLYC	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I am not sure what to do, any advice for me, anybody!!!!!?	I had been talking to a guy, we liked each other a lot, talked to each other everyday, which would involve flirting, silly fun from time to time.  We had a date, weekend together, and had a blast with each other, it did happen we made out.  But we had fun cooking, talking, watching movies together, and playing card games.  I got back home, we talked and he feels we will never be a couple b/c he likes me a lot but doesn't have romantic feelings for me, and if we did hook up, he wasn't sure if he was ready for being around my son.  He says he still likes me a lot but as a person, which is cool! He wants to be friends and hang out still. But we talk on the phone and he wants to talk like everyday, it is like he is just breathing in my ear.  I asked him about it the first time, and he said he is scared I hate him and mad at him.  I am not sure if I should just tell I don't think we can be friends or try to make it work as friends.  ( I just get the impression like he is not that interested in the conversation, but yet he calls to talk and still be friends)
20090204161748AASca0S	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My gf might have been looking at porn...what do i do?	I happened to walk up to my gf room and i hit the browser on her phone and hit the back button and it went to some lesbian porn site. I asked her what it was about and she got all defensive and said she knew nothing about it and that it must have been an advertisement. I know it was a website and not an ad! then later she told me some guy in her study hall was messing with her phone today and that must be where it came from but she never lets anyone use her phone. Plus...she always jokes about how her and her best friend are going to go lesbian and i know she's joking or at least i think i do but when i see this it makes me wonder. Anyway it ended in a fight cause she got mad at me for wonder why it was on there. What do i do?! i'm kinda lost...

20090204162444AAjDK52	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	He might not REALLY mean yes...?	So there's this guy I like, and he's cute, adorable, sweet, funny, you get the picture.    The thing is, he's just TOO sweet.     I've known him for over 5 years, I see/talk to him almost every day, and we're practically best friends. I'm pretty sure I can predict what he's about to say/do. ;)    So anyway, I'm going to ask him out. (I've decided on that.)  And I know he's going to say yes. It's not because I'm over-confident, it's because that's the kind of guy he is.    The thing is, I'm not sure if he'll really /mean/ yes. I'm afraid he'll just say it so it wouldn't be all awkward, and I won't feel bad.      Is there anything special I should say to make sure he'll mean what he says?  Or should I not ask him at all?    Any other advice is appreciated.    Thanks. =]

She in in grade eleven and I am in grade twelve.  We go way back.  We used to do karate together when we were like...nine or ten and she came to my high school when I was in grade ten.      We were always on good terms and we even taugh a karate class together a couple of years ago.  We are both in the same French class and are both in school play together.      I really like this girl and want to ask her to prom/semi-formal, but I don't know how she feels about me.  I've already asked her if she's going to semi and she's not sure because tickets are pretty pricy.  I got permission from my mom to buy a semi ticket for a date if I wanted to.      How should I ask this girl out in a cool way that wouldn't be awkward or anything.  Should I also offer to buy her a ticket?      Thanks

20090204173636AA5gfnW	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What does he mean?Im so confused. I need boys help and girls help really fast?	Okay. heres the problem. I have huge crush on this guy (lets just call him bob incase he sees this. he has a yahoo too and im sure he online now) . He is soooo cute but hes a bit shorter then me. We are both brazilians and met at Deerfield beach mall one day when he was hanging out with my friend nikki.DFM mall is the middle school hangout p lace btw. He is in my team in school so we have the same teachers but different periods. I always thought he was cute. So one day we had to switch up classes for a benchmark test. I and alot of other ppl didnt have to take it so we didnt. I soon found myself sitting next to him. So that day we spent all school time talkng. We were listening to my ipod and texting ppl we didnt know in class and acting goofy cause we were allowed to at this day. so anyways we got along pretty well and we exchanged numbers at the end. after that he texted me a couple times during class but i never answered cause i knew he never had service in class so i figured there was no point in texting back.Like two months passed and we barely spoke except this one time he asked me for a hug. Then 2 weeks ago, i meet up with him in detention but we only said hi and laughed behind the teacher's back while she was on the phone. That day i realized how much i liked him. We have quite alot in common but we make quite a bad couple.I figured that since we barely spoke and he would never find out i liked him i told my friend to tell him i like him while i pretended to not notice and just walk down the hallway with my friends.He just said "Omg." but in a shocked sarcastic way. We have alot of mutual friends but I just dont know. So i was texting my friend who is like his older sister and i told her i liked him. She called him up and told him and she told me that he said he would give me  a chance. The second she told me that i got a bad feeling.   I personally cant stand when a guy says he will give you a chance. its as if he is doing you a fovor or like he thinks too much of himself. even though i know he doesnt. I just really dont know what to do. I dont want him to feel like he is making a sacrafice by going out with me. Help

But do girls do that with a guy they like?   Because there's this guy I like ad he totally lead me on, then told me we should just be friends. That was about 2 months ago, and I still can't go more than like 20 minutes without thinking about him. He was also my first kiss, so I guess that could've maybe made me like him a lot more.      So, should I just leave him alone like I've been doing?   Or should I keep going after him?      Thanks!!
20090204173932AAsFhdK	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	New guy. Hot. Sluts. I like him.. what can I do?	There is a new kid at my school and hes just gorgeous. I only saw the back of his head so I HAD to see his face.. i ran up to him in the lunch line and pretended i was going to get a lunch. He turned my way and our eyes met, i felt like i was struck by lightning and i couldn't tear myself away and he couldn't either. I did at last when my friend screamed TARA! I saw that he was alone and i was going to ask if he wants to sit with me.. but a slutty girl that slept with multiple guys came up to him with her boobs hanging out and asked him to join her.. he had no friends so what is he going to say?? now he sits with the sluttiest girls. He is in none of my classes and I want to get to know him. I don't know what to do, he is so nice but im worried hes going to go for someone else.. since EVERY GIRL LIKES HIM. I try to be posistive but its hard. I was going to write him a note or give him a crush can( a valentines day thing.. u give then a pop with a note attached to it, along with your name) but many many many girls are going to do the same thing.. i dont know what to do!!! i like him so much and i am willing to fight for him. anyone have any ideas?

20090204191343AAhsSxc	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I tell my best friend I'm in love with her?	I've posted this question before, but I still want to get more points of view on it. We became really good friends over a 3 year period, then I moved to another state for 8 years, but we've kept in touch. I get along with her better than most of my guy friends. I just moved back to where she lives last week, and of course, I'm staying with her. Yes, we did have no strings attatched sex many years ago, a few times actually, but we agreed early on that we should stop due to the fear of jeopordizing our friendship. About a year went by and we had sex again, but that was it. Now 8 years after that, we've not laid a finger on eachother- until the other night. We were drinking, and we ended up making out a bunch of times, then we cuddled on the couch and watched a movie and she fell asleep in my arms. We haven't said a word about it since, which is hard for me because I've actually been in love with her since I moved out of state. I didn't realize it until I was gone and she wasn't around me all the time. I just don't know if I should tell her and risk a really good friendship, or not tell her and carry the burden of never knowing. Any help is much appreciated. I really hope she doesn't see this!

20090204191607AA0iAoV	Family & Relationships;Family	What should I do about my life?	I'm 13 years old. Everyone at my school thinks I am a happy kid. They think I am funny and weird. I say random things like "Rawr", or "Grr.". I HATE school. I really hate it. I have a hard time paying attention. My grades are: C, A, A, B, A,. I am almost always in my room and I barely leave my house. And I have mood-swings.      When I get home I am home-alone for about 2 hours.  I live with my mom. Then when my mom gets home from her work she smokes marijuana like everyday. Sometimes it makes my pants smell. It really makes me angry when she smokes, and I don't like inviting my friends over because of it. My parents have never been married and are not together. My dad was an alcoholic, I think he said he stopped drinking. He called me once about a week ago saying he was drunk and we couldn't go out and eat like he said we would. I think he drink occasionally and he currently has a job.       I have been feeling lonely, and I have been wanting to throw things. I just recently cried for no reason also.    And when I was just born, my dad was an alcoholic and my mom was still smoking.       I am very unsure of what I should do about all these conflicts. Should I move with my grandparents? How can I express my anger? And I told my mom to stop smoking, but she said "I CAN SPEND MY MONEY ON ANYTHING I WANT.". Or should I move with my dad?

He knew i was younger than him but i don't think it really crossed his mind to much.   Then one day someone asked what grade i was in so i said 8 and then he asked him and he said 11.   and ever since then he hasn't really been interested in texting me and just not really like he used to be and now he just isn't answering nothing. So what do i do??
20090204194540AAfpVSo	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I rly need to know or get over this guy: does he like me?	Here's the scoop:   1. He teases me, but not too harshly   2. I see him looking at me a lot, and my friend has noticed it too.   3. Some girls in my grade said that if I asked him out he would say yes. (They are friends with him)   6. He talks to me sometimes and asks me questions about me   7. He knows a lot about me, and I know a lot about him, but we aren't rly friends    8. He gets kinda awkward around me scince he found out I liked him. He still flirts with me but not so publicly (I thought maybe he liked me but was embaressed about it)   9. When we talk he looks into my eyes, away, then in again.   10. When I'm close to him, he talks to every girl around me and glances at me, but he doesn't talk to many girls when I'm not in hearing distance

Last night I went to hang out with my boyfriend and I saw some of my guy friends so I went up to my guy friends and I was talking to them and when I said bye to them and looked back at my boyfriend he looked pi$$ed.And he said "are you done?" and I said "yeah,what's wrong" and he said "nothing" and then I said "I'm sorry,I don't get to see them that often" and then he said " what about me?I don't get to see you that often either."And I told him that I was sorry and that I would make it up to him.And he kissed me and we did our usual goodbye and all and he said that he loves me,but I could sense that he was jealous so as soon as I got to school I found my guy friends and I told them we can't be friends anymore and they didn't seem to mind.So,they might not have really cared that I was friends with them or not.And tonight I'm going to tell my boyfriend that I have no more guy friends so he can have ALL of my time and then I tell him that I'm sorry.Do you think I did the right thing?

Ever since valentines day my ex and I have been getting closer and closer. On valentines day we kissed, but only for a little bit, just a peck here and there.

20070509000922AA7cxpV	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do you let go of a relationship when you are still in love with them?	My boyfriend and I have been together 2 years and I broke off out relationship today because he smothers me. We work together, he moved closer so we could be together and he wants to get married. I want to get married too but not right now. I am only 20 and hes 19. I think I should experience life before all this happens. So we mutually agreed to seperate for a little while to see if our relationship could be saved. We have had a lot of rocky patches in the last 18 months. I would love nothing more than to call him up and take him back but I know I need to stop giving in. So what I am really asking is; what is a good way to move on from a relationship when you both still love eachother so much and you didnt end on bad terms? Because I hope we can get back together later when we are ready for marriage and kids.. and he wishes the same.

20070520174523AAM29Hh	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I have been dating this guy I really like for 5 months now. He is commitment phobic. Am I wasting my time?	This guy I have been dating has been in 2 long term relationships and has been cheated on both times. He has been very hurt and has a tough time trusting. I have never given him any reason not to trust me. He has met some of my friends and my mother but  I still have not met any of his friends or family.  I only see him 1 -2 times a week. And when we get together we never make a plan until the night before.  He went out to the bar with his friend and never asks me to go out. And sometimes he doesn't even tell me he went out. A friend tells me they see him. He has all the signs of being comittment phobic.  I feel I have been very patient and never pushy.  I have spoken to him about some of these things.  He has tried to make some changes but I just feel he is not ready to be in a relationship.  I tried to break it off with him before and he insists things are going to get better.  Should I wait for him and continue being patient or should I let him go until he works out his issues?

20070822023932AAkDJhC	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Internet Dating, when to take the profile down and how to broach the subject????	So I've met a guy through internet dating. We've been seeing each other for about 5 weeks, talking or texting every day.  We get along great, he's my type and I can see myself seeing him for a while, though I'm not sure he is long term material. He is definately interested in me, he is extremely complimentary to me and a complete gentleman. Our friendship has progressed this last week and we did the deed.  This in itself doesn't bother me as this is how long I would wait in a 'normal' relationship (please don't tell me to wait till marriage, I'm a big girl!!!).  The issue that confuses is me is that I have taken down my profile (admittedly this was about 3 weeks ago, which he knows about), yet he hasn't taken his down and i know he has had activity on there, he bought up the subject and said he can't take it down until he has used his 'stamps'.:   Do I have a right to ask him what his intentions are in this relationship?   Can I ask him to take his profile down?   Opinions anyone?????

I went to watch the rugby with a friend on Sat as the guy im seeing was at work.When the game was over she asked me to phone a friend and makes plans to meet as she likes his friend.I did it and they came along. There were these guys at the place hitting on me and they were freaking me out so i asked my friend to act like my bf (with boundaries though) so they would leave me alone. But after a while i realised that he must have feelings for me cause of how he was acting. I told him that i had a guy and couldnt do anything. when we left he phoned me for over an hour telling me how much he likes me and wants to be with me and asked if we could meet the following weekend to talk. I said ok. Then yesterday he was like i think ur amazing but i wouldnt wanna be more than friends (i dont care cause i have my guy and wouldnt have left him). I care about my friend and this really hurt. My other friend who was there on sat says that he likes me but is most probably embarrested? what do u think?
20070626053430AAh4jpZ	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Do people not look for commitment anymore?	I look around, and it sort of sickens me how i see people get together, but its almost certain to end soon. I hate how some of my male mates want to 'score' and how i see that even females in my college not want anything to do with commitment if they're in a relationship, else they'd rather have nothing.    Its sad. Call me an idealist but i loved the sweet thoughts of finding someone special, or at least treat like their relationships may unravel that someone. Yknow, high school sweethearts,etc.    Im an attractive fellow, but its sad that people think im some 'playa' and when i show them im not, they dont seem too interested in the fact that i want a real relationship.    Ive come to the conclusion that love no longer exists or that people no longer like that concept.

My parents are paying for everything for the wedding, My fiance's parents are divorced & aren't paying for anything, He & I are paying the grooms portion. So, when I went to word my wedding invitations I was worried whether or not I should put my parents names & his parents names or not, and since his parents are divorced but his mother hasn't reverted to her maiden name, I don't want to announce them as Mr. & Mrs. because I feel they would be upset. His mothers phone is cut off & his father & I don't really get along, his in the marines & is in a place where I can't call him to ask him.

We know each other pretty well and my friend got a new boyfriend is December even though she is still married with 3 kids. she lives with her parents.      Anyways whenever she's with him and she's talking to me she says weird things. Like she called and asked if I wanted to go with her to "pick up her son" and I was like WTF who is this? She always refers to him by name, but suddenly she can't.      Then if she's talking to him on the phone and we're together she says, "oh I'm with my friend." She NEVER SAYS THAT! She always uses my first name with everyone else.      This is driving me crazy. Why does she do that?

20090202115608AAalTAM	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What would be the best way to go about this...?	My bf has been trying to get me to have a 3some with him & another woman for a while now. At first I wasn't into it because I haven't done it before so I told him now, but now I'm curious to try it at least once. He wants me to pick the woman. He has however expressed an interest in one of my friends, but we keep going and back and forth about her because of her complicated personality and we're not sure if she's into it. We all run in the same social circle, have all the same friends and are at the same parties at least a couple of times a month. I told him that it would probably be best if we went outside of the circle because it could cause problems if we tried it in the circle. Like say I bring it up to her and she isn't into it then I'll probably lose a friend or she'll go back and tell everyone and then they'll be looking at us funny or if she is into it, she may try to see him behind my back without me there & that would be against the rules and could ruin the friendship. So is it a good decision not to involve a friend especially one that runs in the same circle as us? If so where would be a good place to meet people who are into this sort of thing?
20090202113908AAVi9Wm	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys: What can I do to make this plan even hotter?	Ok, so I live with my bf of 6 years. We both work insane hours and tonight I will finally get to spend some time with him. I will be home from work first, and plan on making him his favourite dinner. I will be wearing my housecoat, as if I just got out of the shower but underneath will have some sexy lingerie on. After we eat, I will lead him to our bedroom and suggest we watch a movie in bed, which I am sure he will want to do (we always watch movies in the evenings). I will then put in this p0rn that I burned, take off my housecoat and away we go!      Does anyone have any suggestions for what else I could add, or what I could change to make it a really fun night? I need some male perspectives here, because my idea of a romantic evening is different than his, I am sure.       Don't be shy, what else could I do?

He is mean to me, meaning he is more of a smart*ss to me now, for no reason. I have tried to ignore him to get him to stop, but he keeps on bothering me.

20090202121926AAupVVf	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why am I in college and I can't meet girls?  What is a good way to meet more, I'm not shy or ugly?	My school is very small, 1700 kids maybe.  There isn't many opportunities to meet girls even though I'm not even shy.  I don't like going out on dates cause I think they are a waste of money, that's why if I do get into dating mode, if a girl doesn't sleep with me by the 3rd date I dump them, and if they insist I take them out to an expensive restaurant and pay for them, I tell them they have to have sex with me.  It is how I save money cause a lot of women like to be gold-digging girlfriends nowadays.      So far now my biggest success comes from picking up women in bars.  I do it by searching through the trash in the back of my bank and finding the statements with the biggest amounts of cash on them, then take them home and make copies, then bring those copies out to bars and approach the hottest women, right my number on them, and say call me.  I almost always get called back cause they see the massive amounts of cash I make, proving that women love money.      I am just looking for a relationship where I can get a beautiful woman with a great personality who isn't after me for my money, cause the media portrays jewish people like me as being rich when Im not that rich.        So how do I solve my problems?  And don't bother calling me shallow or a jerk, you women go for the money and you know it.  Also you lie directly to me, either by acting like some chaste victorian virgin when who knows how many guys or girls you've had sex with, or you act all uptight and stuckup to prove like you're so much better than me and act like you're so important, when really you're just lying to yourself.         I am just looking for objective answers to my dilemma, thanks.

My bf and I are in a long distance relationship and talk to each other quite alot on the phone. However, I am almost always the one who initiates the calls, the times we can talk, buying the calling cards because it's long distance, etc. We always have a great time talking and he professes his love for me and says how much he misses me but when I mention these other things he just says "Oh I'm a guy and we don't think about stuff like that" or "I forget a lot of stuff" or "I am really lazy"....Is this really how guys are in a relationship and I am being selfish to feel like this or should I be kinda p i s s e d ? I mean it's a lot of effort for me to feel like I am always the responsible one and doing all the thinking and planning ahead. What does he mean by this behavior or is he really just lazy and thoughtless sometimes? Advice please?

My daughters father didn't see her until she was about 3 months old. Then it was off and on when it was convenient for him, roughly about every six months or once a year. Now he calls when he sees fit. He'll tell her hell call tomorrow but then he may not call for another 5 days. He has promised her a Christmas present but then its next week next week next week. Well I'm getting fed up, he owes more then $5000 in back child support and has the nerve to tell me how I should raise my daughter. She is almost seven now and I can tell she wants a relationship with him but she hurts and I am tired of it. I just was wondering if here is any type of order that can be issued on him that would make it so there is no contact but he still has to pay child support. I cannot see my daughter hurt anymore.

I'm also afraid that I'd hurt him and he's misunderstand. One minute I want toget away, one minute I want to hug him.    Has anybody else been through this? Is this normal?

We're just planning on going somewhere at the weekend, but where could we go? We go into town (we live in a small place, 'town' is the local 'high street') and then walk back to mine along the promenade. But we only have a friendly chat, nothing else... We also play badminton together each weekend. What could we do other than go to the cinema or something?      I've fallen for him madly, but the problem is, he's one of those people who goes out with people he doesn't really know. The relationships last for about 2 weeks, then he never speaks to them again. I don't want to be one of those people, but I can't help falling for him. :-(      Anything to say?   The main question is anywhere to go for a casual 'date' though?
20090202122734AAl0h4l	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is my boyfriend addicted to sex?	He's horny when he wakes up (i know that's normal) to when he falls asleep, constantly. I feel like no matter how much I try to satisfy him it's never enough! If i have sex with him, he will want it again within 20 mins.       Even when we've just done it like three times he wants a ********.    We've had sex 8 times in one day and he was still horny the next morning. Everytime he cums he says he feels like he needs to again, and i know he watches a LOT of porn. I even found he had been watching it on my laptop when he was on his own in my house for an hour. I tried to explain that watching it so much makes me feel inadequate, like i cant satisfy him, but he just doesn't get it.       I feel like I have to perform all the time cos he has conditioned himself to think this is normal. Even when he knows he will see me within a couple of hours, he will still watch porn and still be demanding when he is with me!!       I do enjoy sex, but I never get the chance to start wanting it cos its just expected all the time. He even told me the other day that he thinks we should have sex more, bear in mind it is already 2-3+ times a day, as well as the porn he watches when he's not with me.       I know I am influenced by my past as this is my second long-term relationship, and in my first I was cheated on but if I don't give him what he wants, I feel like it will leave him looking elsewhere.      Just want to hear someone elses opinion on this as when I try to bring it up he can get moody!! Just want to know how normal this is??

20090202115927AAhrMwx	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	PLEASE is he starting to change his mind about me?	My bf and I have a wonderful relationship and have been together for 2 1/2 years. I'm 20 and he's 22. He proposed to me in the 1st 6 months, didn't go well we bother weren't ready so...we both decided to tell the other when we felt "that" committed again, it really didn't take me long, I've known he was the one for a while. He hasn't returned those feelings. Although it pained me to have my strong feelings not returned I decided not to dwell on it and just enjoy our love.       I've been doing this for the past year and it's done wonders, I'm just letting him be a young guy and figuring eventually he'll see he doesn't want to be w/ anyone else but me. So whenever I'd ask if he thought I was the one he'd said I don't know, same answer to any question like that. But recently he's started acting different, even more loving to me than he was before.       He's started saying things he NEVER says to me. He only tells me things he actually means, so it makes sense he hasn't been saying them. But in just the past few weeks he's started holding me close and telling me I have no idea how lucky he is to have me. He even told me that he'd never leave me... I was shocked to hear it I had to ask "really?" he thought for a moment, "I guess I could happen, but probably not."       And just again this morning when we woke up he pulled me close and told me how much he loved me and that he never wanted to leave me. I don't want to get married til the time is right but it would mean everything to me just to have him know I'm the one for him just as he is for me...       Does it sound like he might be getting closer to the idea of that kind of commitment? Should I just let it happen and eventually he'll come out w/ it? I dunno, maybe this is nothing, but he's never said those things before and it really makes me wonder. I'd just love to hear what a person looking at this from the outside thinks...       Detailed answers appreciated!

Next, bachelor party...I completely hate the idea.  I don't like strippers or strip clubs.  I don't like anything like that and I'm so worried that they're going to take him to a strip club or even if they go to a bar they're going to announce it and skanky girls will be all over him and I just fear that the most.  All I'm picturing in my head is these sluts rubbing all up on him and body shots etc. it makes me not even want to get married.  Its so disgusting...HELP!      (Before anyone says it, I'm not going to be doing anything like that.  I have made it VERY CLEAR, I don't even want to drink.  I just want to go dancing with my friends.  No guys no nothing just me, my friends, sisters and mother.)         ANY OTHER TIPS ON PLANNING AND ANYTHING ELSE WOULD BE GREAT TOO.
20090202114341AA3Gt9y	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guy Randomly Texted Messaged me? ?	This guy who I've never really been real friends and only had sex once, gave out my number. It was really random because I haven't spoken to the guy in over a month and I get this text message saying "Hi brad wanted 2 hook us up." I told the guy I wasn't interested in hooking up or what ever he is looking for, he isn't going to find here. The random guy said " No I'm not looking to hook up, I just wanted to meet new people and I asked brad if he knew anyone and he said you were cool." I can't imagine a guy, that I wasn't really friends with, saying that I was a cool person to talk too. I mean yeah we were friends before but he only wanted sex and so we just did it and he left ( I really don't want to explain it all). This random guy keeps continuing to say that he isn't wanting to hook up and is only looking for friends. So how I really doubt it but what do you guys think? Why did this guy hand out my number?

My problem is I do not have a wedding dress yet (yea I know this sucks) so is there any stores you know of who could possibly help me get a dress by then? I called alfred angelo and they said they would try but no guarantees. Are there any other stores who have dresses ready that I could by the same day and walk out with if by some chance the dress would fit me? Any ideas or opinions would be appreciated. Thanks.   Oh yeah I live in Texas close to Austin.

20090202122729AA0yS34	Family & Relationships;Friends	We are becoming very good friends, tell me some things about you that only best friends know.?	Here are some things about me...      I play the guitar and have taken cello lessons.   I play chess better than average.   I love movies   I'm a pretty good cook   I love to read   Addicted to the internet   Used to drink, but supporting my wife that cannot drink so I don't.   I will be there for you if you really needed me to.   Love Indian food   I have no friends from High School   I know people at work (same work place for 26 years) no friends outside of work.   People have told me that I would be a good writer, have written some poems and a short story, and am currently working on a poem about cancer.   Often times I feel lonely, especially when I am walking around in the city.   I lived downtown for 3 years in the heart of it, just a block from the market where they sell fish and flowers.   I only have one friend and he will be moving soon.  He is my friend because we have both had troubled childhoods.   I have completed some college courses, have about 35 credits to go for a BA in business.  But somethings came up and I had to stop.      I am older but feel younger.  I have a bike but only go out when it is warm.        What about you?  Tell me what you are like,  imagine we are becoming great friends.

Funny how most of the idiotic comments like 'love you long time' come from white girls. Personally I just think they're racist and jealous. I know myself, I've got loads of white female friends and quite a few white ex-gf's and they're all the same. So guys what is it that makes them so beautiful? And when I say beauty, I don't just mean physically, I mean beautiful on the inside aswell.

He is extremely affectionate during and after sex. He loves to hug, kiss and hold hands. It kinda threw me off guard a bit. I asked him is he always like this and he said yes. He said he loves hugs, kisses and romance. Last time we were together we went out to lunch and watched movies all day at his apartment. When I wanted to leave earlier he begged me to stay. We talk on the phone everyday for like 4 hours. I discussed this with the one of my female friends and she feels being that affectionate can cause problems and stir up feelings.

20090202122451AA6GdOq	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I feel sort of lonely but i don't really want to go out with anyone?	female/15:  i went out with someone over the summer and dumped them because we got too close emotionally which is bad for me since i'm not suppose to be going out and it can never get too serious since i have to constantly hide it from my parents and sort of see what times i can see them personally.  anyways i dumped the person and their still completely in love with me but we stayed friends (don't ask how, it just happened).  and i don't miss really being "in love" but i miss just having  someone hold me in their arms and kissing and stuff, and i found myself thinking of my ex in that way but i don't even like him anymore.  then again i've been thinking of a few people that way, and i know if i ask my ex to be with me he will but the problem is he'll be emotionally attached.  i want a relationship with no emotional ties but im not easy or anything i don't have sex, i just want someone near me without the need to be around me ALL the time.  is that bad? what should i do?

So i was walking home with my friend, whom i convinced to go running with me, and on the way she called one of her friends. When we got to the fork where i go right and she goes left, she stopped at the corner and kept talking on the phone (i also stopped when she stopped). Then she hung up and called someone else. And they talked for for like 15 minutes, and all the while she was staying right around the corner. But as soon as she was done talking on the phone (we'd been standing there for like 30 minutes), she said bye and left.      So what was her whole point in doing that?

The exact same ring for his is $199 at Kays.      I called Kays customer service and they said that the jewelery is the same quality, Jared's is just the "high end" and offer different warranties and different vendors use them that dont use Kays.  but i dont know if she was just saying that so that we would just Kays over Jareds, ya know?      so my question is, does anyone have any opinions of either?  do you know if one is better than the other?  i'm not looking for diamonds here, just a white gold band, and his Tungsten band...      suggestions?

20090202122608AAqhO6y	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why guys should break up with there girlfriends before big holidays?	Guys these are rules to live by!!      Why guys should break up with there girlfriends before the big holidays Tom Leykis has showed me the light!! ?   I'm 19 and been listening to Tom Leykis show and he explains how not to spend NO MORE THEN $40 dollars on a date which is good and not having a girlfriend, the reason, easy you don't have to spend $100's of dollars stressing to buy her a Christmas gift, valentines gift or birthday gift she wont appreciate anyways,don't buy her anything. Don't call her, don't text her, no card, no smoke signal, no anything.. Save your money and buy an Xbox, or go on a trip with your boys to meet girls but don't have a girlfriend. My girl nags the hell outta me and i think from listening to tom leykis I'm going to dump her *** Wednesday because i don't want to spend thanksgiving with her family.. Women think they are just going to sit and look all pretty and expect men to just hand them like 100 gifts or something well the holidays are coming up so break up and save your cash for you, who thinks this is a good idea?? I'm going to break up with my girlfriend at the end of the week i don't care if she cries or not!! I do plan on going out with her valentines day but during dinner I'm going to go to the restroom and slip out the back door and go home and leave her at the restaurant!! I'm sick of her, then I'm going to text her on the way home say, hoped you enjoyed dinner, I'm done with you!! What a good plan. who agrees??

20090202114910AANMYkB	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Please criticize my actions- be harsh if you like, I think I could be making matters worse...?	Two of my friends who had been dating for 4 years just broke up.  The breakup was realllllly ugly and involved the police (he got extremely drunk, came home and woke her up, then slapped her around a bit- she called the cops and he got hauled off- the next morning he thought he was arrested at the bar and had no memory of hitting her).  That was a week and a half ago.  NOW he's devastated (and so he should be).  She's relieved its over (she had put up with this for at least 3 of the 4 years they dated) and utterly refuses to even return his phone calls (except for one slip).  He is not allowed to contact her due to a restraining order.      I (his AND her best friend) have been endowed with the wonderful task of being "stuck in the middle"- when I fully support the choices of one person over the other.      SO:  after the first day, he was calling me and telling me what had gone down.  He was scared that he was going to have to spend more time in jail- and his last ex (who was living off her child support benefits- no job) wouldn't be able to take care of their son...  He begged me to contact her and try to convince her to drop any charges against him...  I begrudgingly talked to her just to find out what she had in store for him- and found there was no need to even bother.  She was going to ask the case worker that "they go easy on him" for this reason- but that they let the restraining order stand (in other words, no charges were dropped- the minimum punishment will probably be considered for him, but he is still going to catch hell for it).  This provided him with some sense of relief- but now that he's had his cake- he wants to eat it too.        In spite of his restraining order, he's been calling her- leaving messages on her myspace- begging me to call her- etc...  whatever he can do to show her that he wants her back and is willing to beg.  Last Thursday she even called him back and told him that things "could only be temporary" if he just cleaned up his act (she lied so he’d leave her alone).  He saw through this- and is now threatening to kill himself (after all that talk about being worried about his kid...).  While I'm fairly certain he's just after attention- I know he's in really bad shape emotionally, and don't trust him.  I visit him and try to keep his mind off things, but it really doesn't help him too much.  I don't really feel sorry for him either- he deserved what he got after what he did, and I don't coddle him by telling him that it was okay.      Meanwhile- SHE went out and got her own apartment, cleaned up her appearance, ALSO quit habitually drinking (she and I got drunk together last Saturday, but she used to drink daily), and is currently looking for another job.  She moved directly forward and got her life together immediately.  We've hung out a few times since the breakup and went to a concert with some friends last Saturday.  She spent the night on my couch...  I don't know if someone from the bar we were at mentioned something to him or what, but the next day it was 20 questions:  who did she come back with, was she trying to find other guys at the bar, did she get too drunk, etc...  There was no suspicion of us (neither one of us would do that to him or risk our own friendship with eachother or my own relationship with MY girlfriend- for something so stupid, and he knows this).  We still get along as if nothing happened (although I have to say she seems  a LOT happier), but now I’m starting to worry about my own conduct.        Oh- and just so you know we’re dealing with 2 adults and not 2 teenagers (no offense, but these two are old enough to have better expected of them-  he’s 27 she’s 21)      For the questions:      Am I helping or hurting matters by allowing him to vent to me and maintaining that small amount of contact between them?        Am I hurting her by warning her that he is doing particularly bad and may start pestering her again- basically to give her a heads up on a guilt trip?        Am I being a jerk and a lousy friend by being realistic and unsympathetic with him when discussing matters (things like- I’m not going to judge you, but you DID do this to yourself and this isn’t the first time it’s ever happened- or don’t be surprised when she doesn’t take you back, you were warned the last time this happened)- or for simply not wanting them to get back together at all?      The most baffling question I have out of this whole situation:      Why is he so much more concerned that she’s going to “bring a dude home from the bar and have sex with him” than that she’s going to send him to jail?  Really?  What gives?

20090205105529AAPF0sp	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why do women take so much from their male bosses, instead of their husbands?	Isn't that kind of backwards. I mean, I hear bosses have a bad day and take it out on their subordinates (usually female). Women come to work and try to make it pleasant as possible because they need their job. Why don't women try to make it pleasant as possible for their husband, when they have a bad day? Don't they need their husbands, more? Even if some don't, shouldn't they? Or should they just come home and vent, no matter how the husband day went.

I won't go deep into details, but I recently got out form a severe depression with a help of a girl, who later just dumped me, because we were in a rebound relationship. She got back to her ex... I love her, although and I move on... But the problem is that, i don't have a support, cause all my real friends got busy and don't even call me (when I call them, they say, they are not available) and in some ridiculously fantastic way my virtual friends from social sites don't even reply me. None of them... I feel terribly, because playing on the guitar, listening to good music and going out to take some photos doesn't make me feel good... Now what the hell I am supposed to do right now??????????
20090205104633AAWvIjU	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Concerned and confused?	I have a friend who has accepted a marriage proposal to a man who has 4 children of his own. He has been divorced for a little more than a year and his ex-wife moved out of state so he has physical custody. This man has a good career and is financially secure which is a plus.      She is a youth coordinator at church and is a full time grade-school teacher and has been one for over 10 years.       My concern is this, my friend has been married twice before and two of her children are from both of her previous marriages. Her last marriage lasted less than 6 years and now she has met this guy and has suddenly fell head of heals.       I have met the man she is planning on marrying and I honestly can say that I don't know what she sees in him. They have have a long distance relationship and she visits when she doesn't have her kids on the weekend. This has been going on for less than a year. By the way, both his and her children are under the age of 10.      My question is this: What can I do to support her? I feel like she is making a blind decision on a man she hardly knows and hasn't had a taste of what he may or may not be like once they are married.       I also don't want to hurt my friends feelings because she is very fond of this man and seems to need the emotional security. However, I do believe in the end she will find herself trapped and unhappy.       I have met this man and I feel that she could do so much better. To me, this man seems fake in his intentions and is only trying to bate my friend in for his personal gain.       They say that love is blind and I truly believe that she loves him, but I have a gut feeling that she is jumping into it way too fast before she has given herself a chance to know him better.      What are the chances that this is going to work out for her this time?

I'm not even sure if he likes me but things seem to be going well.  my plan was to lay low and let him make some moves, but I totally blew that and went with my impulse.

But actually, you wasn't mad.. but you could tell they say it to upset you on purpose.     I have this so-called friend, she always add comments, and then say "sorry, if i upset you" ... but i wasn't even upset.    It's like.. why say it? .. if u think it will upset me? ..    & she doesn't say it in a nice way.    She says: "Sorry, But that pic of you is scary. Its your eyes thats scary, Best change it"    My reply: I put that pic up purposely to scare u   Just kidding =]    Her reply: Im sorry, if i offended you, or upset you.

She told me he is a friend of a friend so she does not know him well herself.We got introduced thru the phone and he later called me and we talked for a while.We exchanged pictures and emails. He told me that he is coming to NY to meet me and that is sweet and lovely. The personality of the guy is very weird.He told me he dates ONLY very slim and very sexy beautiful woman. He talks about appearances so much and how very important it is for him. I think of myself im beautiful but i had a child few months ago and gain bit of weight so i dont know how he will take that. He told me that i should not use any lipstick when im meeting him because it is complete turn off for him and he told me the dress code, i was thinking wtf, we are two adults meeting and im not his kid that he is dictating to me. He told me the way i should do my hair and the whole situation is extremely funny to me. This man who is dictating so much and talks about people looks everytime does not happen to be attractive at all. Im confused what should i do. what would u do if u were in my place. and yeah he says many ladies are running after him and that is another funny thing.      im 25 and he is 41

20090202120453AA2jQKm	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Please, please answer! I need answers, and no one will?!?!?	I'm sorry this is long, but please read it?      Ok well, My fiance, Patrick, who is 26, is very understanding with my emotions. He can read me very well, and he almost always knows what to do depending on what mood I'm in. I also have depression (Not serious) and he always understands that when I'm moody and upset or lonely. However, he can hardly understand his own emotions. He's going through a tough time right now (His best friend is in the hospital with extreme depression after trying to kill himself twice, and Patrick deals with minor depression himself,) and he just doesn't get his feelings... He doesn't know what to do with himself when he's upset... he just zones out and sits there trying to understand it...      I mean, he's a singer/guitarist, and he writes his own lyrics. I'm his vocal coach, so I'll look over his music with him (which has deep emotion in it... He writes it all based on his current mood,) and ask him what a certain line means, and he'll answer, "...I don't know, actually..." when at the time he wrote it, it made perfect sense to him. I'll ask him "Well what were you feeling when you wrote it?" and he'll answer "I don't remember," or "I don't know." I love him to death, but it's so frustrating!       Ladies, are your men like this? Do they ever figure out their feelings?! Are most men like this? Or is it just my fiance? What am I supposed to do with him? He nearly kills himself trying to make me happy :) I appreciate it so much, and try to help him too, but sometimes he seems to push away the help and just sits with a confused look on his face... I mean, I'll walk into the living room and he'll just be sitting there staring off... All I can seem to do at those times is just give him a hug and tell him I'm there for him. I don't know what else to do!

Se cuenta que en el Siglo pasado, un Turista Americano fue a la Ciudad de El Cairo, Egipto, con la finalidad de visitar a un famoso Sabio.    El Turista se sorprendió al ver que el Sabio vivía en un cuartito muy simple y lleno de libros. Las únicas piezas de mobiliario eran una cama, una mesa y un banco. ?Dónde están sus muebles? preguntó el Turista. Y el Sabio, rápidamente, también preguntó: ?Y dónde están los suyos...?    ?Los míos?, se sorprendió el Turista.    ?Pero si yo estoy aquí solamente de paso!    Yo también... concluyó el Sabio.   'La vida en la tierra es solamente temporal... sin embargo, algunos viven como si fueran a quedarse aquí eternamente y se olvidan de ser felices'. 'El valor de las cosas y los momentos no está en el tiempo que duran, sino en la intensidad con que se viven. Por eso existen momentos maravillosos, inolvidables, cosas inexplicables y personas incomparables.'

20080430185819AA8Er0Z	Family & Relationships;Friends	Overbearing Boss who is a Friend...?	I work for a lady who was my friend before I started working for her.  Now I have been working for her and her daughter for the past 4 years or so and I feel like she is taking advantage of me in many ways.  She made me feel guilty because I had to have surgery and had to miss a week of work.  She called me the day after and said she never did what doctors tell her to do and she expected me to get in my car and drive a fifty mile round trip to work and work at least eight hours.  I really care about this family,  but it is coming to the point of me having to decide what I need to do about what is best for me.  I really don't have the option to quit,  because it is really hard to find a job that pays as well as this job.  I really need help dealing with her and letting her know how I am feeling.  All advice is greatly appreciated!

And you know, he's the first guy I've actually really liked, and my feelings for him are so strong.      Now though, since I rarley see him, I'm afraid he's going to not want to see me or talk to me. He never calls or texts me or any of that.I'm always the one that does everything first. It's always been like that.And whenever he doesn't do anything, I'll always make up excuses to make myself feel better about why he hasn't called.      But we talked about marriage and kids and everything. And to me, it was just so serious. And it's hard to let him go because I really really like him and I don't know if he cares or not.   Why? What is it that's wrong with me? I know I'm a pretty girl. I'm not bragging. But why doesn't he like me? Why doesn't he want to spend time with me? Am I not pretty enough for him?

However, my aunt is getting married, and is having a traditional "American"-styled wedding, and asked me to be a bridesmaid.       Of course, I said yes!  But now, I have just a small question (and I probably shouldn't be wasting my points, but who cares).      For the actual reception, do I have to bring a "date" or a friend to walk down the aisle with, or does the groom take care of all this?      Thanks, guys!

20090202113701AA8ycKm	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My so called best friend?	I have been friends with this girl for 34 years. We are now 40 and both divorced. I started seeing a guy who I worked with for 5 years. We became close friends after he got divorced from his wife. He also became friends with my best friend - the 3 of us hung out together a number of times. The problem I am having with my friend is that when we get together she is all over my guy! I hosted a superbowl party yesterday and seating was limited. She actually went over and sat in his chair with him! He was uncomfortable and moved over to where I was sitting. He told me he can't understand why she is doing this and that she has to know it's upsetting to me. This is not the first time this has happened. How do I deal with this? Do I ignore it? Do I let him deal with it? What would you do? Why do you think she is doing this?

20090202113826AAWVUco	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Help me please!!!! 2year relationship problem please take time ti read and help me?	hi i'm 21 and i have been dating this girl for 2years and one month about. she dumped me the 23 of january right when i was on my way to see her (she goes to a different school thats about an hour away from where i live) we have had some problems for the last couple month and i have been a real jerk to her. she would get jealous and mad that my family has accepted my brothers gf's and thier family better then they have accepted her family. my brothers relationship are only a few month old and my parents are a lot nicer to there relationship then mine. not my gf fault because she was nothing but nice to them its just my parents are unfair with me i guess (i'm the youngest). ok so we used to argue a little and i would always over react and make things bigger than they needed to be i would hang up on her and disrespect her at times by asking things she couldn't do such as come over and spend time at my house or come out everyday with me (she has a very family oriented rising , she is Hispanic and catholic so going to a boys house and sex is a big noo noo but we have had sex for a while now and she does come over she is 20 by the way) so i wasn't really nice to her and one day for thanksgiving she thought i went with my parents to my brothers gf's house for dinner and got mad at me and made me drive to see her when i was home the whole time. i got so angry at her that we met half way from each other when she still lived near by and parked in a parking lot to talk. she got in my car and then we started talking she wouldn't believe me and was mad that i turned my phone off when i was home because i got annoyed at her i know it was childish but i wanted peace and i was mad that i couldn't get to see her. even though i finally did to argue. so we were in my car and i got soo mad at her that i got out and tried throwing her out of my car (i know its horrible i was so ashamed of my self and still am) after that issue things went back to semi normal she was on the fence with me but i apologized and things were getting better even though we still argued, maybe a little too much still. then Christmas and New Years came along and i threw a fit because i would not be able to see her those days (i had gotten her a really nice romantic gift and wanted to make it a special night you know) and so we argued again because i wasn't allowed at her house because we argued so much and her parents caught her crying once and knew it was because of me. right before school started her parents allowed me in their house again and we were happy once again but then she went to school and then just over a week ago when i planned to see her and bring her flowers we had a small argument because i called her asking when her parents would leave and i could arrive wanting to spend the most time with her at all. so she picked up the phone with an attitude and said " i told you i would call you when i was in my room" so i said " but bebe i just wanted to know when it was your parents are leaving " and i got upset and hung up on her (stupid me right) and so then she calls me when she gets to her room and dumps me saying that she can't take it anymore that she is miserable and yet she still loves me and says i need to change and then maybe we can work again. well its been a week or so and since that day i have changed i had an epiphany it hit me the next day but i realized that i used to think she would never leave me because she loved me so much and well i was dead wrong she did leave me to protect herself and our relationship. so she doesn't believe me and says its impossible to change so fast and very rare that if i did it would last long but i truly have changed i love this girl so much she has changed me to become a better person every day she helps me to better myself and what she doesn't know is that if it wasn't for her i would end up a beach bum just going from party to party probably doing drugs and ending up in jail with a dui. she is the best thing that ever happened to me and as cheesy as it sounds she does complete me and makes me a whole person. i have seen her since we broke up and we had a wonderful day together and she still say she misses me and loves me but only after i do or ask her basically so i don't know what to do. i know i try to communicate with her to much but its only because i miss her and love her so much and also because her neighbor a shitty friend of mine i guess is kissing her now. he basically found out and took advantage of her and she knows it and is just happy i guess that someone wants her or something idk. i just miss her so much please give me some advice to help me through this.

20090202113840AAbZVyb	Family & Relationships;Family	How do I get used to living away from home? ?	Hi, i'm 18 and have recently moved out from home to university. I'm doing a nursing course, and I know this is what I want as I've done various placements etc etc. So I don't want to back out of my course.   However, I'm finding it really difficult being away from home. I'm really close to my family and miss them all the time. I feel really lonely and i'm finding it hard to get settled. I have loads of friends here but can't seem to fix this problem..  Sorry for the life story, but i'm not really the type of person who shares problems.   Anyway, my question: Is there anything I can do to make myself feel better and stop craving home? Thanks.

Why guys should break up with there girlfriends before the big holidays Tom Leykis has showed me the light!! ?   I'm 19 and been listening to Tom Leykis show and he explains how not to spend NO MORE THEN $40 dollars on a date which is good and not having a girlfriend, the reason, easy you don't have to spend $100's of dollars stressing to buy her a Christmas gift, valentines gift or birthday gift she wont appreciate anyways,don't buy her anything. Don't call her, don't text her, no card, no smoke signal, no anything.. Save your money and buy an Xbox, or go on a trip with your boys to meet girls but don't have a girlfriend. My girl nags the hell outta me and i think from listening to tom leykis I'm going to dump her *** Wednesday because i don't want to spend thanksgiving with her family.. Women think they are just going to sit and look all pretty and expect men to just hand them like 100 gifts or something well the holidays are coming up so break up and save your cash for you, who thinks this is a good idea?? I'm going to break up with my girlfriend at the end of the week i don't care if she cries or not!! I do plan on going out with her valentines day but during dinner I'm going to go to the restroom and slip out the back door and go home and leave her at the restaurant!! I'm sick of her, then I'm going to text her on the way home say, hoped you enjoyed dinner, I'm done with you!! What a good plan. who agrees??

20090202114715AA0fOLn	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Please can someone help me, its a lot but im in so much pain?	My Girlfriend of 6 months asked me to take a break around 2 months ago. Around a week later she was dating someone else. She asked me to stay friends with her, had me buy her things, and told me she still loved me. Then she decided she was going to start spending every moment with him, and go as far as ignoring me for 3-4days completely. Then beg for me to forgive her after.       Finally I told her I wasnt going to put up with it asked her to come over to talk, she brought her new boyfriend with her. I freaked out so much I didnt know what to do, so I told her to take him home and come back alone. Instead when I called her boyfriends roomate answers the phone tells me she wants nothing to do with me, and I should just leave her alone because hes blocking my number from her phone. I told him to tell her I was killing myself and bye. I did try, ended up in the hospital...she laughed.       Mind you me still being completely in love with her I still tried being friends with her, she had me buy her more and more things, and then just stopped caring. Started stopping talking to me for 3-4days again, and now this time I finally call and ask her mother where shes been and she tells me, she moved in with her new boyfriend of almost 3 months, and there's no possible way I can contact her...I've tried just forge ting about her, but I honestly love her more then anything, I realize that shes treated me horribly by screaming and treating me like **** amongst everything else. I just dont know what to do.

20090202115207AAjdMUF	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Are these signs she likes me?	There's a girl in my class (we're both HS seniors) and we've known each other for a while. She's been flirting/showing interest in me for a little while (we have a running joke that we're going to "get married" at the end of the year and she has told me, "You should go to   so we can see each other more often"). To make a long story short, I invited her to my house the other day and her eyes opened up really wide and she said rather loudly, "Oh my gosh-  just asked me on a date!". At this point everybody in homeroom heard her say this and the teacher started singing "Goodbye  " and it was near the end of the period so the only thing she could say was, "when can I come over?" and I said, "anytime, just call before you get there".      I'm pretty sure this is a good sign (ie. she likes me) but I just want to make sure.

20090202115951AAPdLVB	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does my boyfriend actually love me, or am i just here to pass time?	i'm sorry for how long this question is, i just need a lot of help.   anything is appreciated.      but me and my boyfriend have been dating for about sixteen months (seventeen in about a week) and for the last seven or eight months of our relationship i've been feeling like he doesnt love me like he says he does.   the first eight or so months of our relationship, he was so sweet. he would compliment me, try hard to make me happy, and he was almost your picture-perfect boyfriend. then he suddenly started to pick fights with me, and he started not wanting to talk to me as much anymore. hes changed so much, hes went from the perfect boyfriend to a complete jerk.   he also likes to make plans with me, and blow me off half the time for his friends or skating.   i think it has something to do with one of his exgirlfriends and i'll tell you why.   this certain ex of his and him were best friends after they broke up, and now they don't talk much because of me. i think its because she doesn't like him having any other girl but him, but anyways. a month ago he told me he wanted to work at hardees, which is where she worked at the time, and i think its because she worked there.   now she works at pizza hut, and now he wants to apply there and not work at hardees.   this makes me feel like i'm not good enough, and like this ex of his is better than me; and i have to compete with her.   he also talks to her on the phone a lot, and when she wont talk to him he comments her myspace asking if shes mad at him.   they're also planning on going out to dinner together (which let me add, hes never brought me out to dinner in the almost seventeen months we've been together) and he doesnt understand how this hurts me.   i dont know, its seems to me that he treats her more like a girlfriend than he does me.      is this normal?   does he actually love me, or does he want his ex back?

I'm not really even sure if I like her like that. I mean I want to hang out with her but I wouldn't want to have sex with her---which I do know she is doing with her new boyfriend---and I'm not even sure I would want to kiss her. i just wanted to hang out with her. And she agreed to have lunch with me next week but I don't know what I want anymore and I don't know what to do. But I do think about her a lot and I seem to always be wishing she would just text me or something. I'm 19 years old and still haven't had a girlfriend so it's kinda lame. Any advice?

She moved away when we were young and I completely lost contact with her, but I've recently learned I'll be moving across country to the same city she lives in.  We've been talking online through myspace, exchanged numbers, etc. and I realize I want to date her.  We have so much in common, and it's so natural when we're talking.  We naturally talk, flirt and relate to each other on many levels.      I'm just a little worried that I'm either in/approaching the friend zone.  I plan on visiting her in a month, but in the mean time I'm not sure where I stand, how much to keep talking to her, etc.  There's another guy who also wants to date her that's visiting her on valentine's day weekend, but she described him as a "friend"/complicated.  What should I do?  Do I still have a shot?

20090202120749AAKEhOy	Family & Relationships;Family	Is it okay for moms to get out every now and then without the dad getting upset about it?	Sometimes I just need a break from my three kids.  My fiance acts like it is a problem if I ask him to watch them for me for a little bit. One of my kids are in school, the other two are 4 and 2 and they are with me all day.  I can not go anywhere without them.  He could help out, but he just doesn't.  If I tell him I want to go somewhere alone, he thinks I'm out cheating on him or something (which is crazy).  I love him and my family, but sometimes I would just love to go do the laundry  or go to Walmart or something by myself without the children.    My oldest daughter is a cheerleader and one morning I went to her game by myself and he called and sent text messages asking when I would be back.  I was only gone for the length of the game...about one hour.   I really don't have a question, I just want to make sure I'm not the only mom that needs to get away for enough time to regain my sanity a little bit :)

Ok so im 17 I will be 18 in 8 months anyway my dad has a girlfriend that has not ever been with a guy that has children and when she got into this relationship with my dad he told her that I was his neice and she believed him then he told her that I was his daughter and she was pissed and my mom lives in California so she was trying to convince my dad to get me to move in with my mom and he was trying to get me to but I didnt so anyway the other day my dad put a pair of her underwear on the drier and I scopped them up with my clothes and I have a pair just like them so I thought they were mine anyway I started my period in them on accident I didnt know that I was going to start and she found them and the sec I walk in the house tonight she starts yelling at me calling me a dirty croch b # @ % ^ because I had my period and she saying stuff like go wash ur nasty period infested pussy cuz I dont want it near me your a sick as **** and by the way this lady is 45 years old.

20090202121120AAdIDe6	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I had an abortion but still feel guilty, Any way to relate or suggestions to feel a little better?	I had an abortion about 9 months ago and the reason was me and my husband just had our daughter and she was 6 months old when we found out i was pregnant again. Yes i was on the pill and he was using protection as well yes its possible to still get pregnant. So we talked it over for 1 week and decided 1 we would be able to afford another child, 2 he was going away for 8 months to work over seas with a computer entertainment company. So i would be trying to juggle all these things at once and we felt the smart choice not really the choice we wanted to make was to have an abortion. He was talking to me the other night he has been back now for 3 weeks and told me he kinda regrets the choice we made but also knows it was the best choice for us at that time of our life's. I told him we can have another child now if we wanted and he said i love you but i can't have another child right now not till i can feel 100% with my self that choice was needed beyond a doubt. How can i help him and my self get over this feeling.      Ps. I don't need people who are narrow minded about abortions posting there comments, i need people who have been there or who can relate mine and my husbands feelings,
20090202121351AAAszx7	Family & Relationships;Family	I nanny for my brother and his wife. I have been their nanny for a while now and they are expecting their 3rd?	baby next month. They tend to kind of rip me off a bit and are very tight with what they pay me and I gave up my career to stay home with their children and can not afford my essential bills. They said they planned to give me a raise but I know it won't be as much as I am looking for considering the ages of the three children. How should I let them know? Should I tell them how much I want? What would you do?
20090202121926AAdWDQn	Family & Relationships;Friends	Should i transfer schools?	In my grade it is awful(im in 8th) the drama is unbearable and i cant stand it i hate school because of it. These five girls who used to be my really good friends formed this group and they boss everyone around, talk about everyone, steel boyfriends things like that but the problem is if your not at least friends with them your nothing in my grade. I was i guess you could say in the "popular crowd" intil last year when that group formed then it was only those five that are "popular now" Its not that i dont mind not being popular because i dont, as long as i have friends i dont care but all my friends hang around the 5 now and try to get in it and i cant hang out with any of them, without having to hear how much they want to be in the "five" even though they talk about them. My mom teaches in the elementary(sepreate building then the middle/hight school building so i wouldnt be in the same school as her) and her and my dad always joke around and say how i should go there, but last night my dad told me to htink about it because he thinks i might like it. and for the first time im actually considereing it.I know some girls there so i wouldnt be that bad. And we would still live in the same place(becase my brother still would go to the same school) so i could see my old friends(the nice ones) on weekends and stuff. So should i transfer?

20090202121605AA3kCqb	Family & Relationships;Family	How to get custody of my husbands little sister?	We live in texas and have 2 small children of our own. My husband and I both have college degrees and stable jobs and own our own home. We feel it's best if his little sister came in lived with us due to the lack of supervising, and also the lack of interest or effort my husbands mother puts into dealing with her. Also her mother suffers from chronic depression. She's 9 years old. Also we live in a much better school district, which we believe she needs because she is failing all of her classes. To top everything off her mother doesn't throw anything away her house is so full of stuff u can barely move around in the rooms and she has 6 refrigerators full of food some rotting. What do we have to do to have CPS investigate and what are our chances of getting custody?
20090202121706AAzbcyT	Family & Relationships;Family	Does my mother hate me?	I just don't get it please tell me...Ok my mom is always made at me I can't do anything right in her book. I have Diabetes so that sometimes interferes with my school/personal life, so I have to leave class a lot to make sure i don't fall on the ground dead. So it's the same thing at home I'm only 14 so my blood sugar goes outta whack a lot. So I can't get everything done also I know that she loves my sisters more than me, she's always doing things with them. Also Isn't a "B" or even a "C" an okay grade? Not in her book, my sisters all get "A's", so what!? I still have an okay GPA right? Nope my moms has grounded me from all things electronic so I can only go on this after school before she gets home. So sorry If i cant see your welcomed interest in my question. also she has threatened that if by the next end-of-quarter report card is a 3.2 or lower, i get sent to a boarding school. So thanks to all that will help me with this. I'll try 2 check back as soon as possible.

Anyhow my room mate explained to him that I am afraid of getting hurt, after many disappointments. Then he said 'I think you're playing a game'. What did he mean?

20090202122241AAIGgcW	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you think this is right.?	okay so i have a boyfriend, and he's very controlling.   it makes me so mad, but i can't leave him.    anyways he's against piercings and tattoos and like weird hair and stuff like that. but i love all of that stuff. so first i wanted to put blue pieces in my hair but he threw a fit about the whole thing.   and made me promise i wouldn't do it.   so i did because he wouldn't talk to me unless i promised. which is very immature. anyways then i decided i wanted to pierce me lip and so i went behind his back and did it. i didn't tell him until i already did it because i knew he'd argue over it. i thought if it was already done there was not much he could do.    but now it's causing problems and i've had it for a month already.   i don't wanna take it out. and i know i'm not taking it out i feel it's the one thing he can't control me over.   so what i'm wondering is if you guys think i'm the one with the problems of him.?   please help....   thanks.

20090202122657AAXEnYB	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Have I Found My Twin Flame?	At the young age of 14 my family decided to take a vacation to Las Vegas. On our first night on the strip we went to the Rio Hotel, which has a Mardi grau theme. I was at the top level talking with a Face Mask that floated in the sky. The Mask asked me where I was from and my age. Shortly after speaking with the mask I had a tap on my back. I turned around and saw a gorgeous guy! Tall, Dark and Dimples that would make you melt. We chatted for a while and figured out we were both from Cincinnati Ohio and the same age. We exchanged e-mail address and decided we would chat more when we returned home. Upon returning home we e-mailed a few times but nothing ever developed.       Years past and I was in college and ran into him in a class. We chatted and ended up going on a date. We had a good time but didn’t really have a spark. He was more into just dating, he was defiantly a ladies man to say the least. I myself  had put some weight on in college and was not very secure about myself. A few weeks past and we lost touch again.       After College I got a huge hold of myself, got in shape and started looking great. With looking better I developed a better self-esteem and started to form my true self. In September I had just returned home from Miami FL. I was looking great, feeling great and decided to go out with the girls. I was at a local bar near my hometown. I was having a great time dancing on the dance floor. I heard my name announced to come up to the DJ Booth. I ran up and there he was! We had this immediate electricity. Chatted the rest of the night.. The next day he gave me a call and we decided to go out. We had the best time on our date. I felt this immediate attraction with him. This attraction defiantly never happened in the past. Five Months have past and we are two peas in a pod! Everyday we find something that we share or have in common. We have this bond I cannot even describe! People meet as and immediate say he is the male version of me! Is all of this a coincidence or have I found my twin flame??

20081209140233AAVi8Xy	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My boyfriend of 3 yrs is confusing me. Where has the love gone and what can we do?	My boyfriend (25) and I (23) have been dating for a little over 3 years. I just started my doctoral program, which is very time consuming. He has been working for a year and is happy with his job. He has made it very clear that he wants to get married, but I am not so enthusiastic about such a huge commitment. I don't feel that we have the time or money to devote to marriage right now and I want some time after school to be independent and enjoy my career. He recently shared some ambivalent feelings toward our relationship. He doesn't want to wait for me to finish school to get married, but he doesn't want to lose me as a girlfriend. I have similar feelings of ambivalence towards the relationship. I like having him in my life, because he's so supportive, however; I have had thoughts about breaking off the relationship because I don't feel like I have enough time to devote to him. I feel like we've both lost our individuality by being together the last 3 years. Do you think we should try harder to make and effort to improve our relationship? (I have the next month off from classes to focus on the relationship.) Or should we just face the facts and accept that maybe my immediate desire for a career doesn't mesh with his immediate desire for a family?

20090205072132AA7b7UT	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I even Bother?	My live in g/f has been living with me for 2 yrs now. She pays very little of the bills. Well I had a little bad luck recently(things on my house needed repaired) which left me short on paying bills. She still hasn't been paying anything but she goes out and buys new shoes and new clothes and expensive makeup. Last night she had got a bonus check from work for 140 dollars. I asked if I could have 100 to pay the light bill down. She said she needed to go cash the check and she'd be back and give me some money. 3hrs later she returned with a new cell phone and 50 dollars left. She said I could have the 50 but I would have to give her 20 back Friday for gas for her car. I got upset and told her to keep it all then. She then got mad and said 50 is better than nothing. Then she asked me to say I was sorry for getting upset. Should I tell her i''m sorry? What did i do wrong?

We where together this time for 5 months. This time i get her pregnant and we have an abortion. After the 3 week checkup from the abortion she left me, and she got me to buy her a new phone and then dumped me. She also told me she cheated on me that week, and that she hates me and that she just used me. Her family is pretty much all shes got.

20090205080658AAlQNI4	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ladies, what do you do when you surely feel that the guy is courting you?	Do you play hard to get? How do you act towards him? Do you change?      I am asking because I'm in this situation where there's this lady that I like but I haven't told her directly yet that "I like her". I only gave hints like I told her twice casually that "I'm glad that we are out together", or that "I miss her", or "It's unfortunate coz I will not be seeing her later" when she's not available. I think that should give her the message that I like her. But I think right now she is playing hard to get more. I can't say that she's trying to dump me since she seems glad (i think) or she still replies to my messages (text and IM). Its just that I can't understand her actions. Wish I can read women's mind.      So ladies I hope you can share to me what you usually do when you surely feel that the guy likes you and is courting you. I hope you can provide 2 sets of answers. One is towards a guy that you like, and second is towards a guy you do NOT like. I want to assess where I stand.      Thanks a lot and I hope you luck on your love life

20090205100458AAHP60l	Family & Relationships;Family	My Mum and Dad divorced!?	3 years ago my Mum and Dad divorced after a long painful procedure, it went on for almost 2 years before they decided to go their seperate ways and ever since things have never been the same, I know they never will be and I need to move on and get over it, but no matter how hard I try to get on with my life I really can't. I don't know what to do or where to go, I still see my dad a couple of times a week when he comes to see us and although we don't have the greatest relationship I miss him so bad. It seems so stupid but I'm just always upset and I'm always crying and I don't know why, it seems so stupid that almost 3 years down the line and still I can't get over it. Every single thing I do is influenced by the position I'm in and I'm so sick of being unhappy, nobody understands what I'm going through cause none of my friends have experienced the same thing and I feel completely lost, am I dwelling on the whole thing and should I forget about everything, or am I being realistic?
20090205100544AASeL2k	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you think she's forgiven me?	Basically we used to be workfriends and we've known each other for 3 months. Before she used to stare at me, broke the ice by chatting to me, asks me questions and asked for my number and email address. When she approached me the first time i wasn't that friendly and she was kinda disappointed. I did apologize to her saying ''I'm sorry i haven't chatted to you in a while'', and that was when she asked for my number and email address. She called me on the weekend and asked me ''What do you think of me?'' I said ''you're chatty''. Then she said ''We can keep each other company'' and next week she said ''We should go out sometime?''. I kinda of messed up cause i kept asking her ''When you do want to link up?'' about 3 times and she kept saying ''We are friends nothing more''. 1 month later i said ''What do you think about the friendship?'' and she wanted to speak about something else but i didn't and i ended up upsetting her. Now she is still angry with me because she hasn't chatted to me in a while, called me, she can't even look at me sometimes and she's deleted me on msn.       I was on break yesterday and i caught her looking at me and when i caught her she looked somewhere else. It was almost home time and she walked up to me looking at me and said ''How are you DJ'' i said ''i'm fine!'' then she looking through a magazine and i asked her ''Have i done something to upset you?'' she said ''No, not really!''. We chatted for a bit then she went back to her workfriends. When she approached me she was standing really close to me and maintained good eye contact.       When i'm on holiday she does ask for me, gave me a sad look once, gives me glances and she likes me cause she asked for my number etc.         Do you think she's still angry with me?      Would it be a good idea to ask for her number and email address?      When she stood next to me did she wanted me to chat to her?      Do you think she likes me?      Help me out plz!

20090205100949AAvsXDu	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Harder to make friends after married?	I don't understand why it's more difficult to make friends when you are married. Just because I'm married doesn't mean I don't know how to have fun or have a good time. I've always been responsible about how I choose to have fun, long before I got married so I guess that's probably a turn off. And before I was married as well I'd make sure plans wouldn't conflict with what I already had scheduled, and it wasn't always what I had scheduled with my husband (who was my bf in the past).      I'll meet really cool girls and be acquainted with them after a while and think "wow, she seems really cool! maybe we could hang out..." only to find out they are turned off by the fact that I'm married even though the way I was didn't bother them before! What am I doing, emitting an awful smell?      I like to go out and dance, go out to dinner/social drinks, movies, concerts, clubs, social events, etc. yet somehow that's all null and void because I am married? What exactly is it about married people that is so repulsive?

20090205104616AAoJ87U	Family & Relationships;Friends	What should i do about someone copying me? kinda long... sorry?	okay, i used to be best friends with this girl, then we had a major fallout involving her going after this guy she knew i liked and was also one of our best friends. she just did stuff like kiss him in front of me and has now been fingered by him and tossed him off etc, claiming that  she now liked him as well. and that's not the first guy she's 'shared' my feelings for. since she started going out with him, she turned our whole group of friends into people who tell me to my face that they hate me.  But i don't care about him now, i've realised he's just a dick with no balls.  but now me and this girl, i'll call her Ellie (not her real name) she keeps copying me. i started reading the Darren Shan Saga while we were friends, and a few weeks after we fell out, she brought the whole saga and claimed to love them, just because i do. i started wearing eye liner, so did she. so i stopped, she stopped too. i wore black nail varnish a few weeks ago and now she's wearing it too.  there's also stuff like the music i listen to, she has the same school bag as me, etc. and stuff like if i say i like something, or don't like something, she agrees with me. it's really bugging me and i can't stand to be near her. i don't think i just think she's copying me because i'm paranoid, some of my friends have noticed it too.  i can't get away from her because we have classes together, our parents are friends, and we're both going on the same school trip next week, and she refuses to take the hint that i REALLY don't like her. so, knowing 'ellie' she'll want to share my room, sit next to me on the bus, ferry and hang around with me the whole time. even when i'm in the calmest of moods i've sworn to myself i'll end up pushing her off the ferry or into the way of a moving truck or something.   so, what i'm asking is, what the hell should i do about her? i've never been in this situation before and she's taking it too far. it's driving me crazy. help?

20090205110308AAxOKXB	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How do you work on a reconnection with an ex-wife/husband?	My wife and I have been divorced for less then 6months. We had couple of months that I didn't talk to her because I thought what others told me was good to follow in giving her time. However when I found that she might be getting married because I was ignoring her and made her feel abandoned a friend told me this and I told the friend to tell her how I really felt. Well after the friend told me to call her and tell her myself i did. We have been talking since. However now she is carrying the guys child (1 month preg) and he is ignoring her. I am still wanting to work on trust issues that we have from when we were married for 10 years if she is willing. She is going to go to counseling but is trying to decide if she wants to be with the new guy who is ignoring her but the father of the child and told her that they couldn't be together because she tells everyone everything. Or if she wants to work on being with me after being married 10 years and then divorced because I was angry because of  affairs. Our families do not appear to want us to be together. I still love her with all my heart and want to be with her but I am confused how to get the reconnection. She feels a strong sexual connection with this guy and not to me (possible due to my weight-which I am working on I have lost 50lbs so far). Does anyone have GOOD advice for either of us? We are talking and seeing each other and going to counseling?

It'll sound very strange, but I'm far from being in love with him. I just think he has an interesting face (not quite conventionally handsome, but very unique) and I'd only like to become friends with him. I explained the feeling to my friends but they couldn't understand it and still thought it was love.    Anyway the feeling is very strong but it's neither love nor lust.      Now do you guys think it's possible to be interested in the opposite sex without wanting to be in a relationship with the person? Keep in mind you barely know the person.

20090205110713AAKUBCs	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Trying to figure her out?	am i reading too much into this or do i have a reason to...my girlfriend always talks about another guy...how she sings with him, dances with him, talks about him all the time...the other guy's girlfriend feels the same as i do- i giv her all my love and she says she gives me all her love, yet she says i am jealous about her friend...she doesnt understand that she is ALWAYS talking about him...anybody know how or what i am feeling?
20090205110656AAnfrYH	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What is wrong with my husband?	Okay, I just asked about if you would deal with a husband like mine. Well, I am confused about whether he is on drugs or is cheating or both. He leaves the house several times a day. For instance, he'll get off of work at 8 am but won't come home until 11:30 am. then he'll rest for about 3 house and be gone again aroun 3 p.m or 4 p.m. Then he'll come back and leave again around 7 p.m and come back home at 9:30.       It is like he is meeting up with someone or doing something illegal. He said he was divorcing me because he can't deal with me anymore. He got mad when I wouldn't give him $500 of my tax return so he could "catch up on his car payments."       He rarely bathes, has extreme mood swings, told me that he was cheating (but he said that as a joke only because I brought it up--that is what he said),  he gets offended everytime I talk about one of his low life friends (they smoke weed, cheat and beat on their women),  and will try to kill you if you mention one negative thing about his momma.       He said he was moving home with his mom.       He yells at me and the kids all the time, wants to be in control, is never wrong no matter what the argument is, will pack up to move out at the drop of a hat, hasn't acknowledged me as his wife or celebrated our anniversary since we have been married (we got married in January of 2007, he doesn't wear his ring, and he doesn't go ANYWHERE with me in public).       What is wrong with him????
20090205110749AAWyAN0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I have a crush n the person everyone has a crush on?	My crush, who is also my friend, is the person almost everyone has a crush on. What should I do?
20090205110822AAOcXzP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Really need some advise what should i do 10 point for the best answer?	i really like this girl and i asked her out by text 3 weeks ago on saturday (i had my reasons of asking her out by text, she replyed saying i really like you as a mate and enjoy you company because we are mates and think its best if it stays that way, and that she feels she doesnt have to act up infront of me is that ok i replyed saying its completly ok. anyway i have accepted it and have moved on and want to remain very good freinds with her ( we were very good freinds before i asked her out) anyway since i asked her out she had been texting me less, anyway i invided her down to mine 2 weeks ago on a thursday and she came and everythink seemed the same and she and we got on, however both of us didnt mention me asking her out which im not sure if i should, anyway she brought some ps2 games of ebay and i said i had a ps2 game i had somewere but coudnt find anyway she left and the next day i was down my brothers and found the game and said i would pop it down for her she replyed saying shes going out so to pop it though the letter box. i couldnt because i was almost home by this time and said that i might be able to do it 2moro night as going out 2moro night so can pop it around then. anyway the next day both her other 2 games arrived and i sent her a text telling her i might be able to bring thm down that night at about 6 if not id give them 2 her when i see her next, which i couldnt in the end, that same night she invited me down to hers on the monday, which i said yes, but ended up getting the games to her on sunday as left them with her mum. anyway i went around hers on monday and a freind of both are (james) was also there everythink was alright to begin with although not once had she said thanks for me bringing the games down to her and she owed me a few pounds on the games as she went over by a few pounds, anyway i was getting quite a few texts from a new freind who id started dating, and after a while she said lets go upstairs and for me to bring my laptop, (james also brought his upstairs) anyway after a while she said who am i texting i said oww just someone i know, (i didnt want to tell her as id asked her out 2 weeks ago and didnt want to say oww someone im dating) anyway me and rich were on are laptops and i gave her and james a thing they asked me to download for them anyway james said thanks and again she said nothing and didnt say thanks, anyway i started to watch a bit of lost (new season 5 yeaaaa) after she asked me about the text messages she got real funny and said to both me and james "youve both put me of getting laptops because i dont want to turn out like you two". then she tunrned around to me and said why did you come around mine if all you gonna do is watch lost, you could have done that at your house, then she followed by saying oww looks like james is the only one having fun here it all was aimed at me she then said shes going of to do some cleaning and stomped out the room. i mean whats going on she invited me down to her and ended up playing grand theft auto while i watched and i didnt get a go and then she says bring up my laptop upstairs and didnt invite me and james to do anythink or come up with some thinks to do i mean she is the host, and she didnt even ask me if i would like somethink to drink or eat (i always ask her if she would like somethink to drink) and then she turns around and says those things to me, what did i do to her, is she funny because i asked her out, is it because i had lots of texts when i was around hers this time which i never used to before i asked her out and then she asked who am i texting. why would she get funny over this, she did seem to get angry when after i said i was texting someone i know. im soo confused because i just want to be freinds with her now. what should i do now, i have to say the truth i still would like to be more than friends with her but ive got over it and just want to be friends and now she is actin like this its kinda upset me. anyway on last wensdays i go to this photography coarse, last wensday after the monday when i whent over hers on the way back from the course she was talking to me like normal and didnt mention the monday however when we got back to her house she didnt invite me which she always does on wensdays and said i dont know when ill see you text me and ill see if im free. since then i havent seen her and its now thursday 8 days since the photography course, and she hasnt text me, ive text her a few times and asked whats she up to she has replyed, but has never sent me a text first, last friday i said if she would like to meet up on sunday which she couldnt but said i we could meet up monday, anyway i came down with food poisoning on saturday and still felt a little rough on the saturday and sent her a text saying couldnt do monday as has food poising how about tuesday she replyed saying cant meeting ova friends tuesday soz. since then i havent text her and she hasnt text me and its now thursday, why do you

20090205111144AA3yNO6	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I Just Bow Out Gracefully Now...?	We're just sleeping together & really aren't that close on any other level. We probably only call each other once a week for hook ups & then we hang out together at parties that our friends have.  However, he's saying he can tell I'm about to become problem because I'm starting to act mad and he may have to ease off of me. He told me to stop drinking grey goose because he feels it's contributing to my lack of self control. I don't want to feel humiliated if he decides to blow me off.  My friends said, he's not going to leave me alone because he likes the hook up. She said that he's just trying to maintain control of the situation by telling me what he thinks is about to happen. She said that I however should cut off all contact with him & not talk to him at all at parties & see how he'll quickly eat his words, but she said to stop being his booty call.    Do you think he'll blow me? He didn't say I was a problem now, he just said that he thinks I'm about to become one. Should I just bow out gracefully now because obviously he's becoming the problem?

So there's this guy, and i know he likes me. one of my guy friends told me he wanted to ask me out, but didn't have the courage (this was over half a year ago).      i thought that was cute, he's not the best-looking guy in the world but i thought i'd give him a chance, so i was nice to him and hung around him and stuff. and then things just got out of hand..      he started following me around ALL the time, flirting really badly with me all of the time, and it was just.. ugh.      so i may of messed up, because i didn't want to send him the wrong message, so i sort of ignored him and was quite unresponsive. he probably thought i was playing hard to get or something, cause he kept following me around and just wont take a hint ):      and now he does this thing, where for a while he'll follow me, then for a weeks my best friend, then me, then my friend. she said the same thing to me about him, that he's just way over the top      and i just don't know what to do. he's the type of guy that if you confront him about it, he'll just laugh and deny it and be an ***. the majority of the time he's very immature and there's no way i would ever like him in that way.      any help on what i should do?

20090412155551AADM0xi	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I cheated on my boyfriend of 2 years?	I don't know why I did it so before you answer with calling me names or telling me I don't deserve my boyfriend or love, please hear me through. First of all, I never, ever dreamed of cheating on my boyfriend. I won't say "it just happened" because it didn't. I made choices I regret now and I'm going to deal with the consequences. The thing is, I don't actually feel guilty yet as it hasn't hit me. It's been 3 days since it happened and I don't know what to do with myself. I know I shouldn't have done it but this whole thing has opened my eyes and put things into perspective for me. I'm young (18) and I've been committed for so long now. I think I want to "be free" for a while and enjoy my university years without having someone attached to my hip. For the last few weeks, I've felt different towards my boyfriend, like he's more of my friend than a lover and even when we exchange "I Love You's" they just feel empty to me. I don't know if I've fallen out of love with him (is that possible?) and if I did, what do I do now? Do I end it automatically or do I give it some time to see if it will revive itself?

Everything changed when we moved in together and he is totally different. He always wants to know where i am going, who i am with & how long im gonna be out. We live in New Jersey & i have to travel into New York for work. He has this idea that i am cheating on him which i am not, im not that type of person at all. He is part of a very rough crowd and i hate them. I try my hardest to stay away from them.He has a very short fuse & gets pissed with me alot but always says he loves me so much, i dont know if i believe it though. Alot of my friends live in NY so i go there on some nights out with them. The other night when he came home i was on my way out with friends and he grabbed my arm and just kept staring at me & never said anything, i told him i was just going out with my friend eventually he let me go, i got terrified & knew i needed to get away from him. I know he has a tendency to be violent as i have seen him beat a guy just for bumping into me. He shouts at me if i want to go somewhere with out him, even if the place doesn't involve him he wants to be there. Im not his property and he is starting to scare me, im only 25 i don't need to be scared. Im doing everything i can to not fall pregnant for him. Please help me with advice.   Thanks alot :)

20061210153431AADlU6Q	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I just give up on love?  Or am I overreacting?	It has been 2 years since I broke up with my last girlfriend, I had to find out the hard way she never loved me and was with me just for the $$$$ and drained my account in the process.  I am a 23 yr old college student attending Community College and still living at home, so I kinda feel like a loser.  Eventually I will be moving out of the country next year to Germany where I used to live.  My question is should I just give up on ever finding love?  The more I think about it the more I cry(yes cry) and the more I realize that every girl I meet is either in a relationship with a jerk or just leads me on.  I haven't been on a date in 2 years, that's not normal.  I get comments all the time oh you are attractive and handsome, oh there ar eplenty of fish in the sea, and my favorite let love find you.  I am afriad of being alone for the rest of my life and never marrying while my friends will all live happily ever after.  It's like waiting for a train that'll never come.  What should I do?

20090205114958AAwJpVD	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	This is the 3rd time, what would you do?	I have been married for almost 2 years and have been together for 3 and 1/2 years.    1. After a year of being together and 6 months living together, I found where he had contacted his old flame from high school via MySpace. This lead to very dirty txt messaging. When I found out, he stopped talking to her (I know because the phone bill is under my name).    2. In June, I was 8 months pregnant and found out he was dirty txt/pic messaging a girl he use to work with. I found out and he stopped. However, he told me he del the private pix she sent him, but, I later found out he simply forwarded them to his e-mail.   3. A few days ago I found out he was searching for girl #2 on MySpace (which he did not find).       Each time he says he is sorry, cries and swear he won't do it again. His excuess is "I **** up sometime. I don't to it on purpose' Every day I wonder if he is up to no good. I don't belive he has cheated (we work opposite shifts, so when he is not working he is taking care of our 7 month old).       Added details: He was married before age 19-23. Towards the end of his marraige, she rufused to have sex with him, yet he swears he never cheated. He also LOVES porn. Each day he ususally masterbates at least once and we make love as well.       Other then the issues above, everything is perfect. He completes me and is a wonderful husband and father, If you were in my shoes, what would you do?
20090205114607AAheK9A	Family & Relationships;Family	What do i do with this cousin of mine?	Ok long story short:      -Mom died when i was 9 and was left with a 3 year old brother to take care of.      -Relatives hated my dad for some reason and blamed him for my mom's dead (not true) and said nasty things about him. They treated me like garbage, i was ignored. Jealous of me because i was academically better and financially better off.      -I took my dads side but realisz that heis emotionally cold to me and i felt ignored by everyone. Felt like an alien, felt like i was hated, felt like i deserve nothing. I got ignored by everyone. and i know they dont like me. Why? I dont know.      Ok so that was the story, now this cousin of mine ( i dont know about her intentions) calls me and tells me what all these relatives talk about me, she tells me a lot of hurtful things like "she can never miss her mother" "what does she think of herself, she doesnt deserve anything". They even tell her to not talk to me as i am bad.   She keeps on telling me all this. I feel maybe she wants to hurt me, make me feel bad. I would never do that to anyone, i would never tell such hurtful things being said about someone to that person. I cry evernight, they talk such things about me, i never did anything bad for them.      What do i do with this 'cousin'?what are her intentions?

I have known this girl for many years..when I first met her she was a total *****..but we started to hang out because she got married to my husbands good friend.Now we have to be neighbors(military).She can't drive because she got her license taken away,so I taxi her *** around ALL the time.I even sit and wait in my car while she runs errands.Every once in a while she says thanks, and never offers gas money.I sometimes change the time I leave my house to help fit her needs,just because I can.She has this kind of blunt, sassy attitude and I am more outgoing/friendly to everyone.But lately she has started to snap at me.The other day I wanted to hang out for an extra 20 min.or so to talk to my other friends and she said she was tired and DEMANDed that I take her home right then.I made her wait for ONCE and she chose not to say one word to me all the way home.Since then she has been giving me the cold shoulder.But I just KNOW she will come crawling over her next time she needs something.

20090205112059AArljCZ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ladies: Are most men single because women don't.......?	Whenever I am around women (female lifeguards, female friends, women at parties, etc), they often smile and maintain eye contact with me. Not to sound conceited but I caught a few looking at my eyes and my chest and below my waist. However, most are in relationships, taken, or married.       The downside is, why do they continue to do this even when they’re in relationships? Why do they often check me out?They never seem to look at me as dating potential. This explains why I’m single but took the effort to ask them out. Can someone explain this type of behavior? What is the point of my existence around them?       Are they looking for a physical relationship?

I have had him locked up but they always let him bond out and then it makes it worse on me. How can I be sure he will stay in jail? That's the only way I can press charges. I am disabled with a plate in my head and one amputated leg. The Drs. already told him one more hit to the head and I could die. But this is the first time he has hit me in 3 years. I thought it was over but I guess it is not. WHat do I do? Please help me ... I know I am stupid to stay here but I  have no income and nowhere to live. I have 2 kids and I don't want them to see their Dad in jail...I just pray and pray that it won't happen again. He only does this when he eats Xanax. I have told everyone I know NOT to sell them to him so I don't know where he got these. But I'd appreciate advice. But I feel bad enough so please don't tell me how dumb I am...I already know that.

20090205112816AApHR7a	Family & Relationships;Friends	How to turn my self into the man she ever wanted after a "break"?	Its was going to be 2 years on 4-11-09. she wanted a break, a break from me living with her at her parents (we lived upstairs). i don't understand but then i do. We have so much together at her house up stairs. we have soooo many amazing memories that could never be duplicated ever! We met in highschool ( most of the memories happened there.) now where in college ( 2 different colleges) and she gets mad at me so easily. i did everything a dream boyfriend would do. breakfast in bed, movie nights, games, make her laugh, i cleaned and cooked all the time and gave her massges.  : (      When we first started dating its was  amazing! No problems. I had a job, lived with my ma, she lived with her parents. she ran track after school, then would come over my house and hang out and there was never a moment i didn't see her beautiful smile.     I need my confidence back, fast. If i don't turn back into the person she loved and wanted to live her life with, iam toast.     I left an "I LOVE YOU!" on her facebook  and she deleted it. she told me that her friends(at college) would think she is an idiot cause she is on a break. Then she took down her status on her facebook as well.       But i usually don't ever think negative, actually never until now. When we argued, it was always right before bed, and that would crush my Intimate plans. when i woke up, know matter how dark the morning was i was making sure that she was happy. breakfast in bed, massage,  take the dog out, warm up the bathroom. and so much more. but to here she just thought i forgot about that argument.    This is a sidenote:  I was the one making the decision for the first 7 months of our amazing relationship! then i moved in with her family and she took the pants. I know this is were it all started, just this was my first girlfriend ever and i knew she was the one because i could be my self around her and then i moved in and i was restricted. I was happy being with her i didnt even think about leaving. and then next thing you know time flew by and now iam back at home with ma in college going to work and now all i think about is Jessica Lynn S.     I keep getting these god awful moments in my head of her having sex on OUR bed with a another guy(from her college).  While she lays there, on her back accepting it, she looks at the picture of me and her on the night stand next to our bed.     I have nightmares about this stuff!   I get this crazy thoughts  and i cant get them to go away! Its been 2 days since i moved out! I pray to God  to make everything better. but i have to do something about it!  I don't know how much longer i am going to last......    Where should i start? Should i talk to someone to get some help?  please
20090205112935AAYQ5oj	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My boyfriend has a lot of guy friends and I'm jealous..help?	Me and my boyfriend have been dating for 2 1/2 years and we are perfectly fine.. it's just that our families are different.. for example, I have 3 brothers I constantly watch. I go to class during day, babysit in the middle of the day, then work all night..and he's an only child, doesn't have a job and gets everything paid for. then when I'm [finally] done with all my business, my boyfriend is out with his buddies having a good time.      Not necessarily drinking or partying just out with his guys. I have a lot of "acquaintances" but I don't have any real, solid friends I can call when I get done with my job.. you know? I come home alone and then I call my boyfriend and he's like "well i'll hang out with you later I'm with my friends"      then when I don't work, and actually have time, he's with his friends again. I feel alone. I don't really like girls anyway because they annoy me but I'd just like to have time with my boyfriend without him texting on his phone or answering calls, or my little brothers bothering us..      it's really depressing!

Anyway, I asked Jenny why she was acting this way and she suddenly shouted "How do you think it feels being the less pretty, less talented, less intelligent one?"    It really upset me because she did it so people would compliment her more, like "Oh Jenny, you're much prettier!" that sort of thing.   Well, we sorted it out (sort of) but she now tries to put me down, for instance, this morning she was sitting next to me and was just pointing out everything wrong with me, all the insecurities!   I don't want to break friends with her, but is there any way I can make her act more like a friend?    And I've never tried to make her feel smaller or less important than me by the way, just so you know.

20090205113249AAPYlR7	Family & Relationships;Friends	My friend added pics of me on her facebook and I don't like that?	My friend, who I've just met and still don't know that well yet, put a couple of my pics from her party on her facebook.      I am always camera shy because I think I am not photogenic, and when I saw my picture today, I felt so sick because I looked hidious and now I know all her friends, people I dont know, might have seen it.   I am very self concious when it comes to my looks and photos. This is really upsetting me.      What do you suggest I do?   I'd send her a msg and tell her to delete them, but I dont want to sound mean or give off a bad vibe.   This is so upsetting.      I hate facebook, and I hate cameras every more.

20090205115615AAB9L2x	Family & Relationships;Family	Extremely, extremely nosy sister?	My sister will try to read my mail, walk in on me when I'm changing clothes, stare at me while I'm doing laundry to see everything that I'm washing (even underwear), look in my closet to see what type of hair products I buy (and then buy the same ones but say she bought them first), if she finds anything in my car, she will give me the third degree about how, when, and where I got it.      However, things haven't always been this way.  It didn't really start until she graduated high school and I was in the tenth grade.  She started college and began to stop studying.  She was failing.  Meanwhile, I continued to receive straight-A's in high school.  She would demand to see my report card and then hide hers, etc.  When I graduated, I had to attend the same college and we decided to turn things around and study together.  However, when it was time to study, she would play computer games and I would do all of the studying.  During the tests, she would either fail or cheat from me.  She continued to snoop and barge in while I'm changing clothes (we had no locks).  I knew that it was on purpose, because I would say "if you need anything from the room, get it now, because I will be dressing in a few minutes."  She would then sit there and pretend not to need anything.  When I start dressing, then she would barge in and pretend that she needs something.      She's the oldest, and I now have my undergraduate degree while she is still working on hers.  Every time that I achieve something that she can't "beat" me to or copy then her attitude gets worse in other areas.  In addition, she always refers to me as "the baby" or "baby waby", or other toddler kinds of names.      What does this mean?  Why is she so competitive and nosy?
20090205115807AAO7Ez8	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can i win him back as my boyfriend? I really love him?	So, I love Tommy more then anything in the world. I would do anything for him and as i said in the last question, i don't want to ever hurt him. He's been telling me he loves me, he misses me and that he keeps falling in love with me each time we spend time together. The last time we spent together was at his grandma's funeral and seeing him cry the way he did, it made me realize a lot of stuff. I would never ever hurt him though and I never thought i would ever love someone as much as him. When he had his arm around me, i really felt like he was hoping for us to be together again. When he told his family that we were boyfriend and girlfriend again, I was kinda shocked but glad he said that. It just still hurts when his ex girlfriend Sheryl calls him when we are trying to spend time together. I would do anything for him to stop talking to her though, cause she is just trouble and i don't think he actually sees that. I know when i was there Tuesday she was just making me mad and everything. I know i do love Tommy and I really think he does love me. I mean, if u really love someone you can tell and i can tell. My mom even said she thinks he is the right person for me, and i feel the same way about him. so...what should i do to be with him again? he told me he was going to ask me something on  Valentine's Day and im wondering if its what im hoping for. tell me what you think :)

20090412150407AAIDe62	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What do you think Partying or Marriage?	My boyfriend has been wanting to get married for over a year now, I keep telling him no, the reason is I LOVE to PARTY.. I know maybe that is selfish of me but I am a very independent woman that needs no man. I have a very well paid job and nothing I have is cheap. But that's besides the point. I do love him but I can live without. He is a great man he is a U.S. Marine so he fights for our country. We both are P.R. living her in the wonderful United States. We have 2 daughters together and he has been on 3 tours with his unit to Iraq. But I can't help it I love to party I love going out and getting drunk with my friends. So my question is to you ladies and gentlemen. Do you think I should marry him or wait till I am ready to settle down???

(at least i do) the problem is she has never gotten there. -_- she said it feels great when we do, and there were times we felt that she got almost lost but she's not fully satisfied for sure.      i kinda think it's because i don't last long enough. the thing is i can last long when i control the pace; slowing down, stopping or pulling it our for a sec. but she said she's totally turned off everytime i slow down or stop. she wants me to keep moving as fast as i can without stoping! i was wondering...is it really possible for a guy to move like hell for a long time without stoping? should i start working out or something? -_-

I would figure if she really wanted to call me she would get my number from her friend. She's a pretty girl, one that is not single for long, and i dont want to  miss my shot.

20061010004120AAhhUfk	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How Do I Maintain a Friendship With a Former Lover?	I had a brief fling with a co-worker whom I eventually fell in love with. She got scared (her words,) and she rejected me. Now, we are friends. Unfortunately, I feel those same feelings returning.  She has said that I am perfect for her, but yet she recoils from me. Her mother tries to convince her that I am worthy, but to no avail. She gets anxiety and retreats into her shell if talk of romance begins.       How can I maintain a friendship with this woman without these feelings getting in the way? Or, is this even possible?

20061112224206AAQIRu0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What is this guy thinking, interested or not?	I introduced myself to a guy that I'm interested who goes to my school who seems to always have a blank unreadable face, but every once in a while he'll make a joke and crack a smile and its easy to tell when he's confused about something I'm saying but I'm having hard time telling if he's interested in me.  I'm pretty sure he doesnt have a girlfriend.  He's started to call out "hey hows it going" to get my attention if he sees me somewhere even when I dont see him or if i attempt to just smile and walk by and then we keep making small talk but I can't tell what his motives are.  He also has come up behind me in the library a couple of times to make make small talk.  Why doesnt he have any facial expressions!  And he hasn't really asked me any questions about myself even though I asked him some and I use his name when I say hi and now I'm not even sure if he remembers mine, because when he tries to get my attention its by calling stuff out rather than using my name.  What's his motive?

This girl i like has suddendly given me the silent treatment, and im to a point where im not going to take it now. The last 3 weeks have been great, weve been to several movies, heaps of lunches, cofees and the odd dinner her and there. We share laughs all the time, and also the girl likes to touch me alot, and also hit me aswell hahah, we talk heaps at work,and also after work etc...I dont know how, but recently she's been avoiding me, and not texting, or talking as much anymore, seems as though shes trying to limit conversation/contact etc. I dont know what has happened, but the past few days shes being acting very wierd. I think its for the best that i let her go, and be done with the silent treatment,i dont deserve itfor doing nothing wrong. The reason i hadnt asked her out after 3 weeks is cause she came out of a relationship with her ex not solong ago. Whats the easiestway to forget heR?, and i dont even know what happened, but im done with it!

20061124030513AAfQiSR	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ladies, I am at a loss, I  desperatly need your opinion here please..?	Here it is in a nutshell, me and my gf have been together coming up on a year, but have known each other for 2 yrs as we work together.  We have lived together for 8 months and she is the one for me, We had talked many times of marriage and she always said yes.  Well since I was young I always drank and that was a problem that rubbed off on the relationship in a bad way, We had a fight and I vowed then to stop drinking, not for just us, but for me, over 1 month later and dont even want to drink.  Well after that fight we had a bad weekend, nothing major just alot happened and she wanted me out, I decided that I wanted her in my life forever and proposed (I know not ideal timing).  She was confused and has said that she needs time to figure herself out. She has a child from another person and I find that she is looking at houses where he lives, but the day before she looked she spent with me kissing me and telling me she loved me.  What do I do? Wait? She is not up to talking now.

What should I do? Should I stay or should I go?
20061127190130AAXPIzS	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What About Dating?	I am 16 and never been kissed and never have had a boyfriend. I am a firm believer in that I don't have to date right now but I am open to some suggestions in my perception of dating.   I think that dating is serious and that you have to be attracted to AND like the person's personality. I think he has to have some certain qualities. But, am I being too picky? Is dating more of a getting to know thing and he doesn't have to be perfect and you don't have to be attracted to him?    See, in my school, there is a lot of immature and icky guys and I am not really interested in any of them and the ones I am interested in, there are a lot of girls after them.    Basically, is dating a serious thing in the choosing? They have to have a certain personality, but do you have to be attracted to them? And if you like someone a lot of girls like, do you try "go for him" or give up because there are more fish in the sea. It is just that if I don't go for "them" then I would wait till I meet new guys.
20061127200532AAGWQIA	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I ask her out???	I met a      on my friend's bus. She knew my name and she was a complete stranger to me. We saw eachother in the hall. She sais "Hi Tyler!" I just say "Hi." This goes on for a couple of weeks. Then the talent show tryouts are here. She tries out and i find that she plays the piano buitifly. I also play the piano. After she tries out, she returns to her seat. I look behind me and catches her staring at me. It hit me the next day that i like her. I think she might like me as well. I tell my best friend to say "I think Tyler likes you" and he tells her " Tyler told me to tell you he likes you." He said after he told her she blushed. I want to ask her out but don't know how to approch her. I'm really good at putting words into notes but that isn't as sencere as telling her face-to-face.

20061201132421AAsgKSV	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should I do?	Today I saw my guy friend at work, whom I have a crush on. I told him a few days ago that it was best that i didn't talk to him or email him since i have feelings for him. He already has a gf and I also told him it was better that we just said hi and bye. I feel that I can't be a close friend to him, because I know I like him as more than a friend. Yesterday, he seemed nervous or confused and he barely said hi and didn't say bye.But the day before yesterday and today he seemed fine. Later on, he teased me and then we started talking and I told him how I was feeling about him. He told me that he was flattered, but he's true to his gf, and wants me think of him as my brother or relative. How can I get past having romantic feelings for him?

Why was he so jealous about two friends hugging??He knows we're not lez, b/c I am dating his friend.

20061220112524AAIbXmG	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Should he take HER to the concert (relationship advice question)?	My husband and I are getting divorced. He began seeing other women during a time when we were not speaking and things were horrible between us. During this time, he bought tickets to a concert on New Year's Eve and decided to take one of the women he was seeing.  Since then, we have tried to make things work; sometimes we get along but most times we don't, but we still care about each other a great deal and have agreed to go to counseling to see if outside help can help us solve our problems.        My question is: Should he still take this other woman to the concert? My husband knows I really want to go to this concert too. I think it would be good for us and ring in the New Year on the right foot.  He thinks he should still take the other woman because he already asked her and we are not back together. I feel like he should take me, I don't want to see him there with another woman if I go with friends, I'd feel like he's choosing her over me. Am I being unreasonable?

She's in only one of my classes, so I don't get much (If any) time to talk to her (doesn't mean we don't know each other, our school is extremely small, only around 80 something people in the the 9th grade alone). I'm not sure if she likes me; we usually say hi to each other in the hall if no one else is there, she's usually the one to talk to me, and the last time I spoke with her she called me by a nickname I never really was called by (a shortened version of my real name), but I don't think so (of course I'm allways a guy who expects the worst). In addition to this we're almost exact opposites, she's really social, I'm not as much (I'm not Anti-social), she sings and I hate my own voice, I love Metal and she doesn't (least I really don't think so), the only useful thing we have in common would be some of our friends (oh the Irony).

20070103172819AA2JWjU	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My boyfriend hates my sister... ?	My boyfriend of 1 year and 3 months has decided, suddenly, that he "hates" my sister. He says that when they first met last year, she was nice and friendly. But the past few times she has completely ignored him and given him "weird looks." The weird looks aren't true, but she is rather quiet- she just got diagnosed with ovarian cancer and can't have children (her one dream). So now she's very depressed, doesn't want to talk/ meet anyone, and wants to stay at her house and not visit mine.     Is my boyfriend being ridiculous? Shouldn't he cut her some slack for her bad mood? The only thing she has done is not talk to him. I think she is doing remarkably well in her situation.

20070103111028AAykfuV	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do I continue waiting for a proposal or just move on?	My boyfriend and I have been dating off and on for 6 years, living together for the last year.  I was married once before and he's been married twice.  We're doing okay, except that I want to get married.  I think that we're sending a bad message to the kids (6 between us) that's it's okay to live with someone without any commitment.  He doesn't want to because he doesn't want to get divorced again.  For his first marriage, he was 21 and she was 18.  For the second, he was 30 and she was 18.  I say that since I'm 35 and he's 33, we should be mature enough to make a decent effort at making it work.  When we talked about moving in together, I said that I wouldn't live with someone forever, I needed to be married.  He claims that the conversation never happened.  I feel I'm pretty much stuck with him because what other man will want a 35 year old woman with 4 daughters, so I had better just stick with what I have.  Am I being too picky?

20070118133622AAaY0wK	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What?  What is her problem?	Ok, so my EX GF and I went out to dinner earlier this week, she had some news for me.  She told me that she has met someone, and while they are not an "official couple" she is only spending time with him.  I just sat there, listning and waiting for her to finish.   Now, lastnight we talked again, and just making idle conversation she asked me what I was doing with my weekend.  I told her that some friends and I were going to go out.  Jokingly she asked me if there was going to be a girl there, to which I answerd "yeah, Amber is goign to go".  At this news she flipped out, accused me of cheating on her with this girl all along.        Why is it alright for her to date again, but not for me?      Is she just mad that I have "gotten over her" so quick, when it seems that she has done the same?      The only reason that we are still "being friends" is because we have a daughter together, so we are going to be in eachothers lives forever.  No reason to hate eachother, or hold grudges.
