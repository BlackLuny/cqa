SOfbIOzUaa	After the 2 months you can cancel the policy but if you have plates on the car I wonder how that sits with the state of California? I know that the plates in CA go with the vehicle and not with the owner. In many if not most other states you can turn in your plates when you drop your insurance.  You need to check with the Dept of motor vehicles about all this.  Of course if you have a loan on the vehicle you will need to carry insurance to protect the lending institutions interest in the vehicle. also check with the insurance company to see if they have a provision for insuring a vehicle that is in storage and not being driven with comprehensive insurance only. You don't need collision or liability if you aren't driving it.|`|AA11424005	I think you should consider renting a car for the two months.  You can get insurance with the rented vehicle.  Check the LA area for companies who will rent by the month.  It might cost you $800 to $1,000.  No one will sell you insurance for the short term.  If you buy a car, you may need to keep collision and comprehensive insurance on it to protect your investment.  Liability insurance is usually necessary in most states for licensed vehicles.  If you do buy a car, it is better to let someone drive it occasionally to keep moving parts lubricated.|`|oKFAt7Lsaa	You may be able to Freeze your insurance policy for a few months but im dont think you can buy 2 months cover.
SOfbIOzUaa	If you want to keep your engine warm use an engine heater like a block heater etc.    You could even use a heat lamp bulb in a clamp style utility light and shine that on your oil pan. It doesn't need to be on all night just an hour before you plan on starting up the vehicle.  If you are in an extremely frigid area and are concerned with your battery freezing then simply put a 60 watt light bulb close to the battery.    I don't think a simple blanket would make a lot of difference but it could depending on how long since you last ran the car, how windy it is, how cold it is and how effective the blanket is. After all, covering plants does protect them from frost in the fall. They do however make electric engine compartment blankets such as are found at this site http://www.powerblanket.com/equipment_wa...  I just don't have any personal experience with them. I do like that some are 12 volt models. I'd be concerned with drawing too much power from the battery without the engine running. Have to read up on them some more.
Ty32khkaaa	There are 2 causes that usually cause this. One is the rubber seal is sticking to the door or door jamb, depending on the make and model. If that is the case all you need to do is clean and oil the rubber seal. Use a light coat of Armor All and that should do it. The other cause is the latch mechanism. If that is the case all you need to do is use carb cleaner to get the old grease out (degreser works too) then oil it a little so you can work it a little bit, and spray some white lithium grease to keep it lubed up.|`|AA10331789	Also spray "silicone spray" on all the rubber door and door jam gaskets.

If you shifted smoothly into 3rd gear and rev it up to 4k-4.5k, then your clutch will wear down normally.    But if you run your car on 3rd gear while at 4000-4500 RPM constantly, you stress your transmission gears.  However, the stress may not be as serious as having your RPM at redline along 7000+ RPM.    http://hondacivicrepairs.com/stick-shift...    Good luck!
XLXncQu9aa	Yes.  If they hit someone in the process of going to another emergency they are required to stop since it is deemed a dire situation.

gFHTcIc8aa	As engine block temperature rises, parts begin to expand.  Most blocks are made of Aluminum, which is a metal which will expand more rapidly with a change in temperature.  The head will expand, causing area between head and block to increase to the point where gasket no longer fills this gap.This will make you engine more susceptible to leaking "blown head gasket".  The oil inside your engine serves 2 purposes: lubricate moving parts & remove heat from engine.  Higher temps will cause the oil to remove less heat, and worse, less lubrication to bearings & inside engine cylinder bore.  This will cause temperature to rise faster and accelerate wear on moving parts.  At very high temps, lubrication will be gone on bearings and inside cylinder bores, causing the engine to seize.  If your engine is moving full force, a rod make be ejected from the engine "blown rod"|`|c48nm70gaa	If you'd have told us a "close" temperature and time at that heat  you are referring to we all could give a good estimation of all if any damage done. Always include the year make and model of the car. That way we can conclude some senarios from the design of the motor.    Remember that you've got three seperate heat sinks in a typical gasoline motor. The cooling system, the motor oil in the crankcase and the air blowing around the oil pan and engine exterior.    With a 15 lb. radiator pressure cap pure water or a 50/50 mix of antifreeze and water will boil @ 263 Farenheit. A typical temperature needle on a car or truck has numbers that go to 260 degrees. Other not so lucky gages have a needle with no numbers and a red blotch at the end. The real loser gages arent a gage at all but an iluminated (no warning) "idiot" light much like most an oil pressure warning light.    I recently had a personal experiance with an emergency overheating problem I'll share yith you: The car in question is a 99 Pontiac Grand Prix with a 3800 motor.     I was driving up route 14 out of Watkins Glen this past summer when all of a sudden the windshield fogged over. The temperature immediately started to climb from 195 to 210. I turned the heater temperature switch on high with the blower motor on to attempt to cool the coolant as much as possible. When I reached my destination in Dundee NY 15 miles away the temperature had risen to 260 degrees. It was apparent that there was a hole in the heater core so when the motor cooled, I removed the now stuck closed thermostat and refilled the cooling system with pure cold water. I had to drive 25 miles home that evening so instead of twisting the radiator cap fully back on I clossed it one notch so the system would build little or no pressure. My plan was not to force water out of the crappy heater core. The plan worked. I returened home and replaced the heater core and no damage had been done to the cast iron block or cylinder heads, plastic intake manifold or any associated parts.    In your case I would have to know the temperature and the amount of time at that temperature to properly gage and opinion. Sadly, if coolant is totally missing in a cooling system no gage in the world will read the temperature as gages rely on Bi Metal electronic or direct reading thermometers must contact the coolant for an accurate reading.    When coolant temperatures raise past 260 the oil temperature raises higher and that's where things get shakey. As you know pistons are either cast aluminum, Hypereuctectic (aluminum/silicon) or forged aluminum. Any aluminum piston has a higher expansion and contraction rate than cast iron cylinder liners in an aluminum block or an all cast iron block. Car and truck engine manufactures have figured very exacting piston to cylinder-wall clearances for each type of piston. Typical skirt clearances are 0025-.003 for cast and .0045 for forged pistons Things also get sticky in the areas of piston ring end gaps and ring cleariance in the piston ring land area. What happens is the heat causes the rings to expand in the ring as well as the partially dirty grooves tighten the rings. When this happens the face of the rings get hot scoring the cylinder walls. The motor oil temperatire is already too hot to aid protection of the added friction. The top of the piston is always the hottest. It depends entirely on the skirt to cool it by sliding freely on the motor oil and the regulated temperature of the cylinderwalls. Further cooling is done when the intake valve opens drawing cool outside air and atomized fuel droplets.    The oil pump is forcing overheated multi-viscosity oil through the oil galleries. The crankshaft followed by the rod bearings are the first to be oiled. The rotation of the crankshaft and rod bearings create more heat. Overheated oil is then is fed to the camshaft bearings and associated valve train gear depending on design. Finally the hot oil reaches the top of the cylinder head through the valve train where it lubricates the valve guide to valve stem which is another very close tolerance measurement (.015) intake (.017) exhaust, just an example. Another problem may encounter the valves themselves the stems may score in the valve guides an warp sticking a valve open or the head of the valve may overheat and not contact the valve seat properly. In some cases the seats actually fall out of the cylinder head.    The onboard computer "thinks" that the motor is hot and happy so it reduses the fuel mixture causing more damage. Catalytic converters present more heated back-pressure directly on the heads of the specially made valve seats and exhaust valves. Some motors, Toyota in particular have terribly hot cylinder head cooling passage designs for emisssions purposes. This is why they figure they had all the slidging and gumming complaints a few years ago.     This is where a fully synythetic motor oil shines, It doesn't vaporise as easily as the flash to fire poin|`|QWN8KNCPaa	it will probably knacker your engine eventually,cease the engine and blow valves and gasget head|`|N6zo8Zo3aa	usually you will blow a head gasket if not it is a miracle.|`|WbVE1cXKaa	Engines consist of some finely sized components that fit together with very tight tolerance.  Because these things are metal, they will expand and change size if heated too much.  Differential expansion can cause these things to freeze into place (they get stuck, basically) and things connected may break as well under the effort of trying to continue normal movement.  Also, gaskets may blow as they get torn under the expansion and so forth.    You can basically ruin the engine if you run it outside its ideal temperature range.    If your engine overheated, say, because you blew a hose in your coolant system, and you stopped right away, you may not have done any serious damage.  But if you kept going anyway, there is a good possibility that you messed up the engine but good.    An engine rebuild or total replacement is not cheap, and that is what you risk by running it to extreme temperatures.|`|uMKuOlFNaa	Thsi is why the engine has water ports and uses a fan- It keeps it at a regulated temp.

Engine consists of many parts like pistons, piston rings, valves, cylinder head and crank case etc. When you allow the entire engine to over heat... first the small parts do expand at a faster rate than those of bigger parts like cylinder head... Therefore piston and rings expand at a faster rate than the block hence your engine will come to hault after certain time... means engine will seiz..         Its consequences...         1) As the heat increases in the cylinder, the NOX formation is more there by a big blow to the environment.          2) Mainely once the engine seizes... then you will have to buy new piston, rings, and liners... for wich you have to pay a lot.. and also for the service carried out.          3) At that time if you are on a important mission.. then its all gone... because you will be stuck some where in the middle of the road... loss of time...           4) It may lead to some accident if it happens in the middle lane of the road...            Hope I cleared all your doubts..            Take care...

(down, Up, down, up)|`|Ty32khkaaa	Internal combustion gasoline engines run on a mixture of gasoline and air.  The ideal mixture is 14.7 parts of  air to one part of gasoline (by weight.)  Since gas weighs much more than air, we are talking about a whole lot of air and a tiny bit of gas.   One part of gas that is completely vaporized into 14.7 parts of air can produce tremendous power when ignited inside an engine.    Let's see how the modern engine uses that energy to make the wheels turn.    Air enters the engine through the air cleaner and proceeds to the throttle plate. You control the amount of air that passes through the throttle plate and into the engine with the gas pedal.  It is then distributed through a series of passages called the intake manifold, to each cylinder.  At some point after the air cleaner, depending on the engine, fuel is added to the air-stream by either a fuel injection system or, in older vehicles, by the carburetor.    Once the fuel is vaporized into the air stream, the mixture is drawn into each cylinder as that cylinder begins its intake stroke.  When the piston reaches the bottom of  the cylinder, the intake valve closes and the piston begins moving up in the cylinder compressing the charge.  When  the piston reaches the top, the spark plug ignites the fuel-air mixture causing a powerful expansion of the gas, which pushes the piston back down with great force against the crankshaft, just like a bicycle rider pushing against the pedals to make the bike go.    Let's take a closer look at this process.    Engine Types     The majority of engines in motor vehicles today are four-stroke, spark-ignition internal combustion engines.  The exceptions like the diesel and rotary engines will not be covered in this article.  There are several engine types which are identified by the number of cylinders and the way the cylinders are laid out.  Motor vehicles will have from 3 to 12 cylinders which are arranged in the engine block in several configurations. The most popular of them are shown on the left.  In-line engines have their cylinders arranged in a row.   3, 4, 5 and 6 cylinder engines commonly use this arrangement. The "V" arrangement uses two banks of cylinders side-by-side and is commonly used in V-6, V-8, V-10 and V-12  configurations. Flat engines use two opposing banks of cylinders and are less common than the other two designs.  They are used in engines from Subaru and Porsche in 4 and 6 cylinder arrangements as well as in the old VW beetles with 4 cylinders.  Flat engines are also used in some Ferraris with 12 cylinders    Most engine blocks are made of cast iron or cast aluminum..    Each cylinder contains a piston that travels up and down inside the cylinder bore.  All the pistons in the engine are connected through individual connecting rods to a common crankshaft.      The crankshaft is located below the cylinders on an in-line engine, at the base of the V on a V-type engine and between the cylinder banks on a flat engine. As the pistons move up and down, they turn the crankshaft just like your legs pump up and down to turn the crank that is connected to the pedals of a bicycle.   A cylinder head is bolted to the top of each bank of cylinders to seal the individual cylinders and contain the combustion process that takes place inside the cylinder.  Most cylinder heads are made of cast aluminum or cast iron.  The cylinder head contains at least one intake valve and one exhaust valve for each cylinder. This allows the air-fuel mixture to enter the cylinder and the burned exhaust gas to exit the cylinder.  Engines have at least two valves per cylinder, one intake valve and one exhaust valve. Many newer engines are using multiple intake and exhaust valves per cylinder for increased engine power and efficiency.   These engines are sometimes named for the number of valves that they have such as "24 Valve V6" which indicates a V-6 engine with four valves per cylinder.  Modern engine designs can use anywhere from 2 to 5 valves per cylinder.  The valves are opened and closed by means of a camshaft. A camshaft is a rotating shaft that has individual lobes for each valve.  The lobe is a "bump" on one side of the shaft that pushes against a valve lifter moving it up and down. When the lobe pushes against the lifter, the lifter in turn pushes the valve open.  When the lobe rotates away from the lifter, the valve is closed by a spring that is attached to the valve.   A common configuration is to have one camshaft located in the engine block with the lifters connecting to the valves through a series of linkages.  The camshaft must be synchronized with the crankshaft so that the camshaft makes one revolution for every two revolutions of the crankshaft.  In most engines, this is done by a "Timing Chain" (similar to a bicycle chain) that connects the camshaft with the crankshaft. Newer engines have the camshaft located in the cylinder head directly over the valves.  This design is more efficient but it is more costly to man|`|I3CNklLKaa	Stroke 1 - Induction - Suck - the piston (going down) sucks in an atomised mist of petrol  Stroke 2 - Compression - Squeeze - the piston (going back up) pressurises the petrol and air mix  Stroke 3 - Ignition - Bang - at or near to the top of the piston's travel the spark plug ignites the compressed petrol/air mix and the bang forces the piston down the cylinder  Stroke 4 - Exhaust - Blow - on it's return back up the cylinder the piston expels the exhaust gases.

If you sell it privately, that new buyer (or the bank they're getting a loan from) is going to want the title. You're gonna have to get it free and clear before you sell it privately. If you don't have the cash on hand to pay it off, there's not really going to be a way to sell it privately.

qbzen2XYaa	I dont know laws, But just a guess here....     Your corporation can buy the car, and own it, it doesnt matter where the car gets registered.  Thats just like you can personally Call up a car Dealership in Virginia and order a car, while you live in MD, there is nothing stopping you for from doing that.  There is no law that states you must buy a car from the state you live in.    So Since you live in MD, you will just have to register the car in MD, get it inspected there.  They still physically own it, But since the car will be stored in MD you will need to get it registered there.  I do know alot of states have laws about that.  When you register it in MD, you will just have to pay the Taxes to MD and such.    Most states have a law that requires you to register vehicles if you are going to be in that state longer than 6 months (which would be more than half a year therefore giving that state the credit for the registration and taxes etc).  Insurance purposes might also make it difficult to have a car registered in Florida, But garaged in Maryland.  Just a thought.
OcSVkKsEaa	check the brake fluid to see if its alittle low.|`|AA10331789	You need to drive right away to your auto parts store and have your battery and alternator charging checked. Buy a new battery there if yours is older than 4 years. Any red dash light is an urgent message to immediately stop and see what it's telling you by reading about the dash warning lights in your car's owner's manual. See what that light means. Sometimes you even need to have the car towed, but in this case it may be a battery/ alternator problem which is less critical than engine overheating or loss of engine oil pressure or a brake problem.|`|RP6Xmvxsaa	its grounded you better check it to technician|`|Ty32khkaaa	brakes are important, adn something is causing that light to come on. It is more than likely the switch on the e-brake is in need of adjusting, but you might want to get your brakes checked.|`|oKFAt7Lsaa	The brake fluid will be low. the sensor triggers when you accelerate due to the wave created in the master cylinder.Top up your brake fluid and see if this solves the problem. When your brake shoes wear a little the shoes move and this causes the cylinder to move also which causes the brake fluid level to drop, this is normal and may not mean that you have a leak in your brake fluid system however a leak would also cause this problem.|`|uMKuOlFNaa	Check your brake fluid.|`|1cd1d4256f60f00a77846dd0f7701fc5aa	get it checked out dumby|`|eH5IGNFXaa	sounds like master cylinder low on fluid. check fluid level first|`|z9vXZLTtaa	you have a fluid sensor in the brake fluid resivor check to make shure you have the proper level of brake fluid then take it and have your rear wheel cylinders checked out and your front pads to make shure your pads arnt to low and its causeing the fluid to get to low in the resivor chances are tho you prolly just have low front brake pads and its cuaseing the fluid to get to low.

The courts take the view that it is the driver's responsibility to ensure that he/she is covered. They are also unimpressed with the frequently-trotted out excuse "I didn't receive a letter", usually employed by those who take out a policy to get the paperwork and then fail to maintain payments.  I'm sure that's not the case for your mum, but that is the view taken.|`|AA10820533	I agree with others.  She is responsible.  Who ever has the insurance should have known anyway.

My wife and I travel on Amtrak every year on the Coast Starlight from San Jose, CA to Seattle, WA.      I have one word!    Booze!    We head up to the parlor car and purchase a bottle or two of wine, and a couple of glasses then head back to our berth and its very shortly Nighty-Night time.    Our trip is about 30+ hours from our location.  So its always an overnight trip for us.  Being the train gets into San Jose in the PM hours, getting on the train then heading up to get some good wine, makes getting to sleep in an unfamiliar place easier.      Once I have the buzz, I just let that feeling creep over my body, and I am out like a light for near 10 hours.  By the time I wake up, its breakfast time, and I am pretty well rested.  The spend the rest of the time relaxing and taking pictures of the landscape.  By the time night rolls in again, we are almost to our destination.  So its rinse and repeat when we get off the train.    I don't mean to sound like a drunk, far from it.  I just have an issue with trying to sleep in unfamiliar surroundings.  I call it Strange House Syndrome.  I have always been like that, since I was a small boy.  After about three days in the same room or house, I am OK and can finally get an "un-medicated" sleep.      I hate it because regardless of where I go, my first three days are spent in a haze unless I get a little buzzed before bedtime those first three nights.      You might try a little nip of something before trying to get some rest.      Its just a suggestion.    Good Luck and Happy Rails!

uBQpnu1qaa	Try getting an online insurance quote It's free and quick to do. http://www.goodinternetdeals.com/Auto-In...|`|t5ToQzN3aa	The rough guide I used was that if you make 1 claim in 3 years then the money you lost on your bonus was about equal to the cost of the protection (most insurers have a higher excess for protected bonus).    However if you are unlucky enough to have to make 2 claims then the savings are substantial.    As a broker I cannot recommend a client NOT to have protection if they are considering their options because of this fact.|`|eTTkAv9Yaa	Look around, mine was renewed on the 21st and only cost me 20 to protect it, shop around.|`|AA12279950	I've got the full ten year's no claims and I keep it protected.  Yes - it's well worth it!|`|4RUaH1XHaa	Phone your insurance company and ask but 80 sounds a little dear but it is only a 4ne call.|`|qhPQvwzGaa	yeah it's worth it if you have an accident you will lose  2years of your bonus with most uk insurers, that could cost you a lot more than 80 when you renew the next year,      also most companies allow you 2 claims then it will reduce your bonus regardless of the protection|`|iFVgcqhGaa	It all depends if you have a fault accident in the next 12 months.    If you dont it will have cost you 80.  If you do, you will probably save well over 80.  Its taken you 4 years to get to your bonus level.  One minor accident and you are down to 2 years bonus.  Another one and you have lost the lot.    You can sometimes loose your bonus even if the accident isnt your fault say, you come back to your parked car and someone has hit it and driven off.  Insurers pay out for your repairs but have no one to recover from.    You should expect to pay about 10% extra to protect your bonus so if your premium is 800 then 80 is probably about right although some higher rated vehicles and Pickups may be more.  If not, you should shop around for a better deal.
WHDQ068iaa	i work at a chevrolet dealership outside of chicago and when gas prices we at $4/gallon we didn't see any drop in sales.  we specialize in full size suv's such as suburban, tahoe, & denali's.  we sell 65-75 per month and never skipped a beat!  people who want the vehicle's don't care what the gas prices are.  i'm not saying my situation is the same everywhere, but just letting you know my experience.      bottom line- the people who can afford them and want them are going to buy them regardless of gas prices.|`|LamVaAETaa	My Father owns a Chevrolet Dealership; And contrary to the above posters response our sales Of Tahoe's,Suburban's,Avalanche's,& Silverado pickup trucks took a huge plunge.

It hurt the large SUV and truck market.  Have you ever watched the news?  Where have you been?  It hasn't recovered since then either.  Sold a few more trucks and SUV's, but it still isn't good.    We sold more CARS when gas was 4.00 per gallon.  I wouldn't have a Prius or a Corolla left on the lot if it were 4.00 per gallon.  Quite frankly, I wish it would go back up.  It would cost me 20.00 more per week in gas, but I would sell A LOT more cars.    From your friendly Toyota Salesperson :)

JLayHNZCaa	Could be a loose nut on the windshield wiper transmission or it could now be bad.       It is always worth repeating:  in the winter, before you turn on your wipers, make sure they are not frozen to the windshield with the ice and snow, make sure you clear the area so the wipers can return to their normal resting spot.  Not doing this can ruin the windshield wiper transmission and cost you a few buck ($125.00 or so for the parts plus install if you can't do it) and make it difficult to drive in bad or rainy weather.

Gc8ORtMuaa	Okay, ignore most of the answers so far that are recommending American tyre fitters. It would be a bit of a drive to the USA just to get some tyres!    It's best to avoid the fast-fit chains as, contrary to what they would like you to think, they are often the most expensive (although if you get the right tyre on a special offer they can be ok).    Franchised dealers can be hit or miss for price, some are very good value, and some charge extortionate prices.    Most independent garages fit tyres, and you should get them at a reasonable price, although you may well have to get them ordered in as they often don't carry a huge stock.    www.blackcircles.com is a good site to try. They use a network of approved independent garages. You order and pay for the tyres online, then choose your nearest garage and they deliver the tyres to them. You go there, and get them fitted.    If you are looking for quotes, make sure they are all-inclusive. Things that will sometimes be charged for on top of the quoted price of the tyre are:    Fitting  Valve replacement  Wheel balancing  Disposal of old tyres    ... and lastly VAT.|`|3SwJy3B7aa	ebay just try to find one with reasonable shipping|`|kRRq5rhbaa	if aggressive tyres then www.mudhutoffroad.com. 7 STRATFORD ROAD, WHADDON, MILTON KEYNES, MK17 0ND.      this is where i got mine from and i use them for offroading. they the best!! gets me in and out of any bog hole. reasonable price to|`|550e4912823fee98e745442e7bdab33faa	Sams Club  Pep Boys  Tire Discounters  NTB|`|AXNkmdbKaa	Pep Boyz.|`|Ty32khkaaa	Sams Club|`|kdS3Iyeeaa	buy from the interenet by searching on the google with the keyword best tyers price for 4x4|`|O9ymY67iaa	01902 722 089.

AA10441938	no creo hayun programa como esto. pero ses possible. si sabes un digame por favor.
XLXncQu9aa	Here are the steps to take if your car loses control or fishtails.     * At the first sign that your rear tires have broken free and are providing no traction, take your foot off of the accelerator. This will automatically reduce your speed and often times will be all you need to do to regain control of your vehicle.     * Without over-reacting, slowly turn the steering wheel in the direction that the rear end is moving. For instance, if the rear end of the car is fishtailing to the left, steer to the left.     * Try not to overcompensate with steering. If the car's rear end begins to fishtail to the other side, slowly steer in that direction.     * It is common for the rear end to fishtail to the left and right multiple times. Stay calm and continue to steer in the direction of the rear end until the car's path straightens out.     * If necessary, stop the vehicle after it has righted itself and collect your thoughts. If you suspect that your vehicle has hit something, put the vehicle in Park, turn off the engine and inspect the vehicle for damage.|`|5FVyVS9vaa	Back off the gas and don't touch the brakes.|`|DCP2GJDZaa	Braking reduces traction as well as acceleration. it also depends on what surface your on, on a slippery surface accelerating or braking will cause you to lose grip on your front tires as well and when you lose that there is nothing you can do. just let off the gas and steer to correct whichever way its sliding. Make sure you always wear a seatbelt incase it goes wrong though|`|wpgRMjgraa	Ideally, your efforts against fishtailing should be focused on preventing a slide to begin with by simply driving slowly and avoiding sudden braking, acceleration or turns.    ABS (antilock brakes) do not work well fishtailing, and often will lock up your wheels regardless. Sliding wheels are uncontrollable, that is, steering input will not change the vehicle's direction if the wheels are sliding.    Turn your wheels in the direction that the rear of your car is sliding. It helps to look with your eyes where you want the car to go, and turn the steering wheel in that direction.     It is easy to steer too far, causing the car to slide in the other direction. If this happens (called over-correcting), you'll need to turn in the opposite direction.|`|MVZ6Mpa1aa	When you hit centre hit the gas and that will pull it out of the fishtail!  or  take your foot off the pedal and hold the wheel loosely in your hands until it stops fishtailing.|`|oKFAt7Lsaa	accelerate !!|`|z9vXZLTtaa	deffinitly dont hit the brakes let off the gas and let the vechicle  slow down and if you have to brake do it very lighlychances are it will regain its traction and youll be fine.|`|3kmZOaYqaa	You need to counter steer. Which ever side the back of your car goes to, that is the way you want to turn your wheel. When you feel it straighten out, straighten the wheel.|`|0OF2cwjQaa	Steer in the direction of the skid.  DO NOT apply the brakes.  If your car is front wheel drive, ACCELERATE.  Believe it or not, it will pull you out of the skid.      I live in Montreal, and drive like a maniac in the snow. I fishtail on a daily basis so I speak from experience!|`|XixWPZZsaa	This will depend on whether the car is Front or Rear Wheel Drive.   In either case - DO NOT hit the brakes, dont even touch them until you are fully recovered.    Front Wheel Drive: Easier for a novice. It may sound a bit scary, but you will need to hammer the throttle while you are countersteeing (somebody here said, take off the foot from accelerator and slowly turn the wheel, you need to turn the wheel to opposite lock fast). In a front wheel drive when you hammer the throttle - it will pull the front out of the skid. While you are throttling and applying opposite lock, slowly return the wheel to the straight position. While doing this the fishtail will slowly reduce and go away completely. Throttling is key here.    Rear Wheel Drive: More tricky and might fail you unless you practice this in safe conditions. If you rear wheel drive car starts to lose traction in any situation, you cannot let go off the accelerator. If you do, your rear wheels will keep catching traction and send the rear end violently to the opposite direction - you will continue to fishtail in a violent manner. First thing is to turn the wheel to the opposite lock like in the first scenario, while you are doing so you have to feather the throttle (lightly balance it so the rear wheels will keep spinning, but not too much to turn the car completely around - hence the term feathering the throttle). Once you catch the slide, you will have to do several countersteering maneuvers by turning the wheel from opposite lock to straight and then quickly back to opposite lock - only with every other counter-manuever you will turn to the lock less and less. This will slowly straighten the car out. Once its almost straight, lift the throttle so the wheels catch full traction - you are back in control...but if you did everything right you were always in control anyway.
JLayHNZCaa	Nope, most hand brakes are made to be engaged without pushing in the button.  The button is for releasing the dog that keeps it locked into the ratchet locking it in place, not for when you engage it.|`|kgk3Yz9Naa	nope,not really....driving instructors dont like to hear it clicking on during the test...the clicking is simply a spring loaded metal catch jumping over metal teeth on the handbrake...no damage will occur|`|QGuxbItCaa	Not an opinion...I do it all the time. Car is 6 years old and the HB works fine.|`|jqaFMtVgaa	You probably won't find a link or reference, but, there is no way you can hurt the parking brake system by engaging it without pushing the button.  The button is actually a "release", and it's purpose is to keep the handle locked up, until you press the button to release the brake. It doesn't do anything on the way up except hold a position.|`|Ty32khkaaa	All the button does is keep the handle from going down, and releasing the brake. Not an opinion by the way, I have been working on cars for 19 years. Pulling the brake is stupid though. All it does is engage the rear brakes. One day you will pull it too hard and start spinning. If you want to verify it follow the cable to the rear brakes.|`|24ebc8edf978e269550ad9d8827de8dcaa	The button is only there to provide a release for the tooth mechanism that is there to prevent the handbrake simply being jolted loose.    It plays no other part in the use of the handbrake at all.    If you never push the button in while applying the handbrake it will make very little if any real difference, you only need to push the button in when releasing the brake.    That said, it is considered good practice to push the button in simply because if you don't then there is going to be some wear on the ratchet mechanism...you can hear it as the teeth clock over each other when you apply the handbrake without the button.    It's doubtful though that such wear would ever be enough to create a real problem.

(Take off the air filter from the carb and hold you hand over the round bit till it starts) You can also spray "easy start" directly into the carb.

0Wvyh3EBaa	I have a 2004 wrangler with 30 inch tires with no lift.  No rubbing it came stock with them.  I put a set of M.T.'s that dished the wheels out and still no rubbing with offroading.  Now 31's are only .5 inches up and .5 inches down over my size so i dont think you will have a problem.  Now if you put sway bar dsconnects on the jeep or plan for serious offroading then lift a liitle but for now let it ride. Ride sally ride!|`|JKQhSGEEaa	they should jeeps sit up higher anyways. i got 31's on my totally stock dakota and there is room to spare|`|z9vXZLTtaa	yea they should fit just fine might have a slight rub if you have the wheel turned while going over rough terrain but otherwise you should be just fine|`|I8f9AAEIaa	Since you didn't bother to mention what model jeep.....probably not w/o alot of rubbing on some jeeps, like a wrangler.  A cherokee and older grand, they will rub alot while turning. A liberty, noway!  Since we can't see you, or your jeep, info really helps get a valid answer~Dan
kgk3Yz9Naa	you've answered that yourself....petrol wont ignite under pressure so it needs a spark|`|AA10496601	Well diesel has a much higher energy count then gasoline, so it is much easier to get diesel to react with air without a spark.    Gasoline could still react without spark but you would need to a compression ratio in the upper 1:30  range, which would cause a pre-detonation in the next stroke, basically making a big boom...    bah, stupid people and there thumbs down, please look at the work Rudolf Diesel did with testing...  diesel has huge energy co-efficient compared to petrol...|`|Ty32khkaaa	Explosions are caused by heat and pressure. Gas uses more heat and less pressure, and diesel uses more pressure and less heat. Either way it makes an explosion.|`|AA12094894	Petrol is more volatile than diesel. If petrol were used in the same way as diesel (using high compression) it would run too hot and cause pre-ignition. Thus it would not run for long.|`|nY1nq9hCaa	Petrol is a highly combustible fuel, it can ignite on the faintest spark or flame, it does not require high levels of heat.  In petrol engines the chamber is a mix of fuel and air to get the desired effect.  Petrol engines are generally used for speed.    Diesel, when you try light a fire with it it generally does not make a difference to your efforts compared to what petrol can do.  It requires heat and that's why diesel engines have glow plugs to heat the air from the inlet to make the diesel in the chamber ignite.  Diesel engines use injectors to spray the diesel to ignite.  Diesel engines are generally used for power to pull and push things.    It is just that these fuels are made and processed differently which makes them work differently too.  Diesel was invented first.|`|LCIaikPlaa	A diesel engine is essentially a compression-ignition engine. Air rises in temperature when compressed - the diesel fuel is added to give combustion.|`|z9vXZLTtaa	gas engines use a spark to run just as a diesel uses heat and high pressure to detonate

This is based off a 12 volt American car system.  I would check with the manufacturer of the unit you want to install to just make sure.
AA12261615	i own a repair shop,and i,ll try and explain this,turbo chargers use direct exhaust to run back through the engine to help produce horse power,,they do this with heat and force,,bad for the engine,,because heat is the one thing you want to get away from an engine,,as for super chargers they use a pulley system and force air through the engine using rpm,s of the engine to do this ,,the faster your going when they are used the more power and speed you get from it,,they use fresh air always to do this with,this,,never using hot air insures a cooler running engine,,which can produce more rpm,s and a higher horse power at any speed or almost at any point of the throttle,,this is what give a super charger its advantages over any other kind of systems,,try this with a quick shot of nitrous,and you can easily see a speed of 160 or better from an average looking car,,i own a 71 dodge challenger that is super charged,,and i have seen it on 158 mph ,a few times now, and it gets pretty light  too,,but a super charger is the best for any performance engine,,no matter what it is,,good luck i hope this help,s.,,have a good x-mas.|`|ce472995c1d318543b44830b71555b28aa	only thing that I have to say is when you are thinking of a turbo, it is pressurizing your air intake from and including your carb or throttle body, all the way into the engine,  a super charger will not pressurize your throttle body or carb due to the fact that it is mounted between your Throttle body/carb and your intake manifold.  Turbos blows air into your engine, Super Chargers suck air into the engine.  As to what my opinion is as to what is better, it really depends on make of the car, and space, also take into consideration existing set up, EFI will usually always be turbo'd, carburated will usually be supercharged, however this is always subject to change with different kits available.  Also for the record, they do manufacture turbos that use a compressor type unit that is belt driven and not exhaust.  If you like take off power for the strip or legal street racing, super charger is the way to go,  if you want high end or high rev power, do the turbo...  In any case, you need to make sure everything is well balanced and works together on the engine, watch your boost on either system and make sure your cam is compatible with the system you choose|`|942276b959c4ddcd57174f3502d4f99baa	turbos work off the exhaust spinning blades to induce more air into the intake, hence them taking longer to activate. super chargers are belt driven and push more air into the intake as soon as the carb is opened up.|`|AA11049265	Turbochargers are powered by exhaust gas while superchargers are belt driven.  Both pressurize intake air allowing for more fuel to be burned. Turbos take a little longer to spin up but can reach higher rpm's.  Superchargers are directly connected to the engine rpm so their buildup follows the engines. Turbos also require more cooling since they get very hot from the exhaust gas.
AA11013915	Pretty easy - you can buy every single part off the shelf (including bodyshells), so if money's no object, you can effectively build a new car.<br>  <br>  They do rust like buggery, though, so be prepared for LOTS of bodywork needing attention, and take care with keeping everything properly aligned when you start replacing big chunks - try and do small sections at a time.<br>  <br>  As for modifying, you can do almost anything to them. Buy a couple of the Mini magazines for ideas, and to have a good root through the adverts to gauge spares prices.<br>  <br>  As with any project, start with the best car you can afford. Unless it's something really rare like an early cooper, dogs are complete money pits.

Go to your local post office and ask for a driving licences application form (free, they should give you a brown envelope). Inside the envelope there should be a form which has details on what to do when your license is lost/stolen.

This is only good for UK residents. Sorry man :P|`|fKn5ah0eaa	1. Report it stolen to the police    2. Get yourself an international Drivers Permit which will allow you to drive again. This can be done from any Post Office or online    Hope that helps|`|ym9bT5lmaa	Report loss to police. You will be given an 'incident number'. Obtain a replacement US licence from the DMV who issued your last one. To obtain a UK licence, you must pass a theory and practical test in that order. The procedure can take a few months. It is doubtful that a UK insurer will want to add you to her policy since you do not hold a UK licence.

uMKuOlFNaa	When you run out of gas, Chevrolet is hell on burning up fuel pumps   I don't think you got any trash in the pump (from the bottom of the tank) becasse it's a 2006. have someone go to the fuel tank and listen for the "hum" of the fuel pump, while you switch the key on (don't try to crank it, just turn the key on) You'll here the pump if it's working..   most  electric fuel pumps are cooled by the gas. I'd think you'd have to run it   dry ALOT before you'd burn it up though, I'd think most people would cut  the car off when the engine quit, but hey I've seen people driving down  the interstate on the rim when the tire went flat so anything's possible.|`|HUluAQM3aa	The owner's manual has to have some insight into this situation.  How in the heck does a car not start up after running dry of fuel?  Why would a "special" procedure be needed?  Companies build cars that do this..really???    Add more gas.  Tanks have flat bottoms and fuel pump pick up is not on the bottom of the tank, just slightly above it to avoid possible ingestion of moisture/water which is more dense than fuel.    Good luck with your Malibu.
gEw83TRTaa	The answer is in the language of the ad.      "No credit applications will be refused!" -- anyone can APPLY.  Your *application* cannot be refused    "Everyone gets approved to buy a car" - which is true.  With enough down payment, and co-signers, etc - anyone can buy a car.  You may need 90% down... but you can get approved.  You are *approved* to BUY a car, not finance it.    Banks will give an approval call on just about anyone.  You may not be able to meet the conditions of their approval.  So the bank my say "We will approve Mr. Jones with 75% cash down, and a co-signer with 700+ score" -- there is your approval.  If you cant get the cash or the co-x, then its not the dealer or bank's fault.  You were approved.    There are many other twists like this, but those are a couple of the most common.|`|YbH74WGkaa	Who would have ever thought it possible? A car dealership acually lied!

Often they use phrases as no application refused or in the small print they add a phrase such as with the appropriate down payment which could be 50% or more.  In these hard economic times, it has become increasingly more difficult to obtain financing if your empirica score is under 650.      I would suggest going to lending tree.com and placing an application.  They specialize in getting you the lowest rate possible on a pre approved loan.  Then you know what payment you are approved for prior to looking for a vehicle.    I hope this helps you!|`|Nl2U569eaa	definitely pay attention to the advertising language. If you weren't approved then you must have bad credit. In that case i would suggest either paying cash for your car or if you're really desperate then going to a buy here pay here like JDBuyrider. But, be aware, their % rates are higher because of the risk they take financing people with bad credit.|`|2ee9ba3f8fa52a8c3bd583c6f12f11b8aa	You should demand they give you a free car, or else you're going to call the cops.
78e4081014f25f2f27e0302c168080c5aa	P1538 is for the Intake Manifold Runner Control Stuck Open.  On these engines there are vacuum or electric motor controlled actuators that open vanes in the intake when the throttle is opened so far , to lengthen or shorten the intake runners.  The actuators are located under the upper intake on both banks of the engine.  Either the actuator is not working or the vanes are stuck open in the intake due to carbon buildup, I have seen both problems occur, it could be one or the other.  I have also seen actuator rod bushings missing or broken cause this code as well.  You need to take it in to the dealer or a competent local shop to check the operation of the intake manifold runner controls, (IMRC), to determine if it is a problem with one of the actuators, bushing missing, or the lower manifold assembly itself.|`|nAK8bm91aa	Chiltons auto manual|`|55a7c9ee13be4af0516d03c798a92a60aa	1998 ford windstar codes   could try   1998 ford windstar repair manual PDF  type that into search box

nY1nq9hCaa	The garage man is wrong to say its a common mistake.  The only way you can be assured that there is nothing wrong is to get in contact with the DVLA.  Make sure you have a copy of it just in case for your records.     With the MOT test now, garages that do a MOT have to do additional checks like logging on to the DVLA site and making sure the car colour and serial numbers match to the ones that the DVLA have.  They will not grant a MOT if the car should be blue and they see silver in front of them (unless they don't care), they are two different distinctive colours.      Cars can come in many colours some may say they are blue but the car looks more blue green etc but blue and silver are very different.|`|nRzNSAu2aa	dvla would be good to phone they would type in the reg and all the info will come up, same with insurance companies.  it is common, especially with ford, check it with the plate under your bonnet (normally on the front panel) it should be the second one up on the left hand side.    *edit* um hawkeye8, im quite clearly not a man as you can tell from the avatar, some girls are capable of being level 3 qualified sprayers and knowing about cars.|`|ItpzEOFhaa	phone dvla they can check the records the numbers on the log book|`|55a7c9ee13be4af0516d03c798a92a60aa	sure does matter its a log book where they keep whats done to car they dont care about color and 95% of cars people dont have them  is not a i have to have thing really just do care like people who dont ahve book ask dealer fro one that says sliver dont matter really  log book is a log of things that gets done to one car and when its done you can make one with a note book|`|YwdsP4c2aa	Would be best to contact the DVLA, it's the sort of anomaly that would be difficult to explain to the police if you got a producer.

Your friend the mechanic should look all along both cars and look for any excuse to negotiate the price down.  How much to negotiate the car down all depends what you find wrong with the car.

I would go for the blue civic, only b/c the price is $1000 less, and you could use the leftover cash for you tax title and tags. Good way to spend the 9gs.  The prices are fair considering the amount of mileage for a 4yr old car.  The most important thing is the maintenance, like the poster above said, their '96 is at 270k and running.

AA10137828	It is simple to replace.     The old glass is held in tightly though. It is best to break it out with a hammer which means use caution, gloves and eye protection. New glass inserts can be ordered by most any auto parts store. Silicone sealant is a good way to re-glue them back in place. Cost will range from 10 bucks and up for the glass, and around 3-5 bucks for the silicone.    It would probably be about as cheap if you let the glass shop replace just the glass portion. The last one I did (about 8 years ago) cost 7 bucks for the glass cutting. I put it in myself, but they would have done the whole job for 20 bucks.     If this the mirror that is on the windshield, and not the door mounted ones, don't even bother! just get another at a salvage yard, probably around 5 bucks!|`|8468bdfd89a4b2535048ee892787ee1aaa	While it is not rocket science to remove and replace a rear-view mirror, it can get tricky based on the car.

qlO6UZZyaa	How could their car be "totally damaged"' and yours not even a scratch?  Worse case scenario, they sped off to go to the Emergency Room at the Hospital.

kgk3Yz9Naa	english please....  more info needed.  EDIT BELLOW...oh,now i see.  some car engines in the UK use the same bottom end on both petrol and diesel engines...just different piston crown design and a full diesel head...|`|E0j6mhqhaa	It's easier converting a diesel engine to gas than the other way around.  In the late 70's, Chrysler used a 1.7 liter Volkswagen diesel engine converted to gas in their Horizons and Omnis.  The lower end was the same, but with different pistons and a completely different cylinder head.    Diesel engines normally have heavier built crankshafts and connecting rods.  With in line 6 cylinder engines ag engines, gasoline engines often had 4 main bearings on the crankshaft while the diesel version used a 7 main bearing crank.    The GM 350 was a piece of crap because the light gasoline engine block flexed during operation, something you certainly don't want happening.|`|AA10346371	Changing an Otto cycle engine to a Diesel engine never works.  These are similar designs, but not interchangeable.    General Motors attempted this in the early 1980s when they converted their 350 Cubic Inch gasoline engine to a Diesel engine.  It failed miserably.  The engine block and crank case was plenty strong enough for a gasoline engine.  But when converted to diesel there were ongoing problems with failing cylinder head gaskets and connecting rods.  The engine could not handle the increased compression and combustion cycle when converted to Diesel.    If the many engineers at General Motors could not pull this off, there is no way a private individual could.    You would need to figure out a way to triple the compression ratio and have the engine still hold together.  You would need to completely change the fuel system as these work completely different.  The carburetor from a gasoline engine will not work.  You would need to install some sort of fuel injection.  There are no throttle plates in a Diesel engine.  The engine is regulated by the amount of fuel added to the engine.  The amount of air is constant.    You would need to replace camshaft.  The grind used for a gasoline engine is all wrong for a Diesel engine.    You would need to replace the ignition system and add a glow plug otherwise you would never get it started.    You would need to install a larger electric starter.  An electric starter for a gasoline engine does not have enough torque to spin a Diesel engine fast enough to start.  You would never be able to kick start a Diesel engine because of the high compression.    You would need to install a larger battery and charging system to operate the more powerful starter.  You may want to consider 2 batteries and a 24 volt electrical system, at least for the starter.    Because of all of these obstacles you don't see Diesel motorcycles.|`|KaQLLLXfaa	Yes in a bullet motor cycle you can put a Greaves Lombardini Diesel engine which is used for generator.It is air-cooled and gives a mileage of 85-90km/lt of Diesel.To start, a motion has to be given with the kick and it starts. The engine does have a little 'tik-tock' sound and the highest speed is limited to 90km/hr.  This was also done in Sooraj Automobiles for a motorcycle named 'Sooraj' in the 80s'.People opted to buy a military  junk Royal En-field motorcycle and get it fitted with a Diesel engine.

The "vehicle coverage" with another driver is intended to cover an out-of-the-ordinary situation where the car is driven by another licensed driver.  It is NOT intended to cover the situation as you would like it to be.    No, as long as you have insurance coverage, it NORMALLY covers you for any car you drive.  But you said that you had been dropped, implying that you didn't have ANY insurance coverage.  You even said it had been cancelled, which is what the insurance company does, not "dropped" which is what the policyholder does.  Your Mom needs to be careful, if you live with her, and thus have what insurance companies consider "ready access" to the car she gets insurance coverage for.  If she doesn't add you to the policy SHE could get in trouble.  You also need to check with state law where you live, as some states REQUIRE EVERY licensed driver to have insurance, even if they don't have a car.

Jock|`|X16keVc1aa	Simple answer :-  A digital voltmeter.    The solar panel only gives out a very small charge. It probably will not give enough out to charge a battery from flat. It is ideal though for leaving in  your car on the dash panel if you park up for some time (more than a week).  To check the output from the solar panel with a digital voltmeter you first connect the voltmeter to the battery and note the reading (it will probably be about 11.5 volts). You now connect the solar panel and you should see a small increase in voltage. Do not expect to get 13 volts straight away it may take a few hours of sun to build up the voltage.  DO NOT PUT THE WIRES FROM THE SOLAR PANEL TOGETHER _ IT WILL DAMAGE THE PANEL>|`|wANiHkJraa	use an amp meter, this will tell you if anything is being produced, failing that turn it on and touch the 2 connectors together and see if they spark (not the best method but a solution)
f038db3294ca7b44e88aa5770e91bbdbaa	Well, you can't charge someone with negligence unless it's in conjunction with accidental death. You can sue them in court for negligence, which is what I recommend. Unless a judge declares you not at fault no insurer is going to declare you as such when the accident involves a pedestrian.|`|e4fUoOpmaa	Notify your insurance company immediately.  On the subject of post-accidental injury claims, I'm not sure he will be able to file them since he was standing in the road outside of a crosswalk listening to headphones.  My point is that the was being negligent.  I wouldn't worry to much about it.  He was negligent, but so were you, so neither one of you are entitled to sue each other.

Secondly, What does it matter that he had headphones on his head? Who even knows if they were turned on or not? You still hit a person standing on the median.     Thirdly, yes he can make a claim for injuries.

WO68RZdIaa	If the design of the intersection prevents drivers from seeing the crossing guard when they go to stop traffic, it would be best if they use the walk button to assist them if one is available & it works.    But- a person that is directing traffic does have precedence over the traffic signal & they can stop traffic as needed regardless of what the traffic signals are showing. Even if you had a green light, if the crossing guard steps out to stop traffic, the traffic signal is then invalid & the crossing guard is now a stop light/sign & failure to obey can result in many states the same fine and penalty as running a stop light/sign.     For that intersection, you are just going to have to be extra careful and possibly make a suggestion to the school board about your recommendations. It could be very possible that the crossing guard, being on foot, doesn't know that there is limited visibility in that intersection when in a vehicle in the lane that you were in that day.|`|wpgRMjgraa	Yes they should pay attention to the lights but what I do at all school zone areas is I drive slower than the recommended speed limit just in case because you never know what to expect........|`|AA10026511	ARE YOU SURE YOU HAD A GREEN left arrow could it had turn red  as you started your turn? the pedestions always have the right of way|`|Wk4k7Q5Qaa	IF there was a walk sign mounted and it was red the school traffic guard should not have stepped onto the road. If there is a pedestrian light they have to obey that light and do not really have the right of way. Many pedestrians think they have the right of way all the time, but they have rules also and must obey them. If this happens again go to the school office and report to the principal and tell him or her of your experience and they should check to see if the crossing guard is not putting any of the children in any risk. The Crossing guard must make sure that the traffic can safely stop and has already stopped , before allowing children to walk . The safety of the children comes first for the crossing guard and everything else is secondary.|`|OnWMvip2aa	the peds Always have the rigth of way and the guard has the rigth of way tire and figth it and you will not win it will be your fault and stoping and looking all over would help at that intersection if people get mad do not worrie it is better that this dose not happen a again so look really look

gnonlDpiaa	Your going to want to use a 2 channel or mono amp to power subwoofers. How many speakers it can drive depends on what ohms the amp can run stable as well as how many ohms the speakers are.   If you have 8 ohm speakers, and a mono amp that's 2 ohm stable, you can run 4 sub woofers on that amp. The more sub woofers you add, the less the damping factor of your amp will effect them. The damping factor controls the cone movement of the speaker, effecting sound quality|`|TdiZFnbAaa	The power of the amp should always be higher than the capacity of the sub woofer for instance a 400w sub should be pushed by a 600w amp it won't get hot fast and should maintain steady bass over periods of play! Two channel amps allow you to set different output (sound) levels to each individual woofer or speaker, its been known to use 1 two channel amp to power woofer and door speakers, but it has to pack a punch (amp)|`|M8uwjGQ4aa	the ammount of subs an amp can power is soley based on the rms rating of the amp and subwoofers     lets say we have 1x 1000w rms amp  and 10x 100 rms subs    the amp can perfectly power all 10 subwoofers as long as they are installed correctly and the impedence is correct

You've got a lot to choose from, which admittedly can add to the confusion.    While the A4 had a really impressive turning radius, so does the BMW.  The A4 felt and drove like a solid car.  So did the BMW.  Pricewise I think they're more or less on a par, although with the different BMW models you'll see a wider range.    I personally think the BMW is more fun to drive.      Reliability - I know that Consumer Reports gives most BMW 3-series a good rating.  I'm not sure about the A4 although I think it's decent as well.|`|4Y2mxvnfaa	I would suggest he take a test drive of both and see which one turns him on more.

The two are not always compatible. Contrary to all the old wives tales and the advertising by the additives makers, they are not needed and some are down right harmful. Most car manufacturers advise against using them.|`|k55p1pKraa	All you have done is cleaned the lifters to a piont that it isn't slick anymore, just replace your oil with fresh oil & add a can of stp oil treatment to it and it should slick   & prime the lifters back up,  the tapping may never go away of one of the rocker arms have loosen off.I've heard lifter noise in engine  & they have lasted for ever.|`|BgwTxzEFaa	Diagnostic computers do not diagnose mechanical parts.  The lifters have no sensors on them to diagnose. Engine diagnostics are used to diagnose OBD problems or performance issues, not noise problems.    By adding the oil additive you change the viscosity of the oil and in doing so, you alter the oiling efficiency of the motor.    Get rid of the additive, and just use a good quality oil.    If your lifters are making noise, oil additives are not going to do much to help it.  The lifter tap is caused by a wearing out of the lifters and rockers that causes a gap between them.  The oil is not going to fix that gap.  Sometimes lifters can be adjusted, but often the top end of the motor just has to be rebuilt if it becomes a serious issue.    Also, some vehicles have hydraulic lifters, and messing with your oil viscosity will make things much worse.|`|FJefmjNIaa	RISLONE is to clean off any varnish on hydraulic lifters that might be causing them to stick.   If it does'nt work,the noise is caused by wear.  In that case you need an oil THICKENER,the best would be LUCAS Heavy duty Engine oil stabilizer,esp. the synthetic!  I love it.!!  P.S. The RISLONE has THINNED the oil.!

yBc0HJifaa	I can not imagine that companies, public or private, consider and expect to be bailed out. Now the porn industry?  I will tell all of you that the government is not just giving the money away. This is a type of government take over. If I was Ford I would risk finding another way also.   I currently own a Ford Truck and like it. I have had it three years. Ford makes great trucks that are sturdy and reliable. I have owned many Ford trucks from a 1951, and many during the '70's. I have also owned several Ford cars.   The problem is that Ford, to me, is not making the quality vehicles that it can. They produce a vehicle and stick with it long after they should have killed it off.   Compare a Ford Taurus or Tempo to a Camry.   In the past when a company came out with a popular vehicle other companies tried to find one to compete. This led to the Camero, Mustang, and others.   What has Ford, Chevy, or Chrysler produced that really competed with the Nissan Altima, Toyota Camry, and others? They should have been aggressively producing vehicles that look great, gets fantastic fuel mileage, and at a price to beat the competition. Of course this free trade that is the "great hope" that can be the straw that breaks the camel's back.   I understand that Ford is willing to risk failure to keep from being taken over by Big Brother. Chrysler took a bail-out and was sold to another country.   I do think it is cool not to take a bail-out ----but---  we have the technology for vehicles to look great, be driver friendly, get far better fuel mileage than they do, and be affordable.   Will Ford offer a better deal? Higher standards? I don't know. Why have they fought to make computer diagnostics complicated? Before they have to fold I am sure they will take a bail-out.    I am just like everyone else. I am not rich and try to survive as best as I can and provide for my family. Would I buy a Ford to help them survive so they can sell to a foriegn company? Will I buy a Ford knowing I can get a better deal, more quality, and a better price from someone else? I don't think many would say yes.   I just found out England has a congestion tax. If you can't afford to pay it I guess you walk.    Where does it end with toll roads going up and private companies buying our highways? How much will the average person be willing to pay to travel from Fl. to Ca.? Someone with a big truck pays high fuel taxes and still must pay about $100.00 to travel from NJ. to IL.   Our new President states he intends to cut taxes. This is a great thing but since we are trillions in debt how can we afford this? What can we expect? Where is it heading? Who  will end up paying?    He gets the votes for an 800+billion package with plenty of pork barreling. Since, for some reason, a line item veto will not happen it is government as usual.    Ford, if you are reading, give us quality, affordable price that beats the competition, fuel milage, some style, and we will have no choice but to buy a Ford, right?   There are a lot of questions in my answer but for those willing to explore they are also answers.|`|dCuWCbRkaa	I continue to have faith in Ford, and GM and Chrysler for the sake of this question.  My uncle lost his job this past summer at Ford, so I am really supporting him and other people who are at risk of losing their jobs.  Lots of people bash the Big Three for making products inferior to the Japanese companies.  I really find this stupid because because these people just say what they hear everyone else say because they don't want to be the minority.  It's now an unfortunate stereotype that if you want your car to last until the Apocalypse you'll buy a Toyota and not an American car.  I hate seeing people buy something other than a Ford, GM, or Chrysler, but if they are going to buy a Toyota, I hope that at least they compared American models and just liked some features about the Toyota.  I hate it when people say, "I'm a college student so I need my car to last, so I'm not buying an American car."  Hey people - did you know that the American Ford Fusion ranked higher than the Accord and Camry in reliability?    Another thing that bothers me is that people still don't want to support one of the few true American companies left, is that they think that since car companies share all the same parts from the same suppliers, there's no harm done buying a Japanese car.  If the parts are exactly the same, then why not buy an American car and support YOUR OWN economy instead of an economy half way around the world?  The UAW workers that assemble those parts are not greedy or lazy either.  The salary or hourly rate that they get has been that way for years.  The Unions HELP the workers and give them benefits.  That's why the money figures seem so high, because benefits are factored in.    My family purchased a used Ford Freestyle last fall.  Sure, it was used, so it didn't support Ford directly, but it took a car off of a Ford dealership's lot, so it kept them in business to be able to weather the storm and perhaps buy a new vehicle to take its spot.  I wish people would do their research and see that Ford's quality and reliability have gone WAAAAY up in the last few years, and that their vehicles will last just as long if not longer than a Toyota or Honda.|`|I1Usqh1Raa	Eric above hit the nail on the head. The problem with Ford is the quality of their product.    Lets compare two huge car companies: Ford and Hyundai. In the past 15 years, Hyundai has gone from a company that built cars of laughable quality, to a company that now exceeds Toyota, Honda, and Lexus in quality according to JD Power! Their new Genesis luxury sedan was just named North American Car of the Year at the Detroit Auto Show, and it beat the Lexus LS430 in a head to head comparison according to Car and Driver magazine. Hyundai went from the Excel to the Genesis in 15 short years.    By comparison, what has Ford (and GM even moreso) done in that same period of time? Rested on the "sympathy" of American buyers, expected that we will "buy American" regardless of the quality of the product. I mean, Americans are stupid, but we're not THAT stupid.    How Hyundai did it, I don't know. But they did do it. They focused on quality AND cost consciousness. And they achieved it. Ford... not so much.|`|WrELuqkKaa	I live in aus. And a ford supporter always had fords and always will. People should buy more.|`|HUluAQM3aa	Their morals are not in question at the moment, but the quality of their product overall.    Ford has not manufactured a product in North America I would consider yet.  Their history and durability demonstrate some issues still need to be resolved.|`|78e4081014f25f2f27e0302c168080c5aa	I think the people who put Ford down on this question have not purchased a Ford in the past few years.  My warranty repairs for Ford products since 2005 have gone down a considerable amount.  Ford's quality has improved over the last four years by a great deal.  You buy a Ford now, you will not need to return for repairs in the future as you did under Nasser's lead.  The vehicles are well built with quality parts, not to the lowest bidder as before, priced with the rest of the market and has a warranty that competes with the Hondas and Toyotas.  Chances are that American workers built that Honda, or Toyota you purchased instead.  Guess what, the PCM for that Honda and Toyota came off the same assembly line that the PCM for the Ford did.  The same workers made it.  The oxygen sensors that went into the Toyota and the Ford, Chrysler, etc, truck came off of the assembly line right here in my hometown, (yes, the factory is 6 miles from my home).  The auto industry is not that diversified, parts come together to make a product, and common products are used between vehicle lines.  You think Honda makes their own electrical parts? nope, might be made in Mexico on the same assembly line as Ford or Chrysler harnesses.  If the foreign cars where so wonderful then the Honda dealership wouldn't need a service department right?  They never break down, but they have one don't they, because they do break down, all vehicles break down, some people are too narrow minded to see that, so they can spend 5K more on a vehicle that doesn't give then any better service than a US brand vehicle, even though they have the same parts inside.  I am glad that Ford does not need any assistance at the moment, it makes me feel good that my company made better business decisions than the others did.  And if the foreign pushers really want to make themselves feel bad, they can look up Toyota's losses in the US this year.  The vehicle quality is not the reason for the losses, it's the state of the economy.  If given the choice between feeding my family and buying a vehicle, I will feed my family every time.  Yes, I support Ford, they have been signing my paycheck for the past decade, I will stick with that, and there are lots of new products that haven't hit the market yet, wait till you see what Ford has for the future.|`|55a7c9ee13be4af0516d03c798a92a60aa	been driving a ford for 23 years and 300,000 miles guess i wil stick with the one i got its still running lasy four cars ive had ford first was 64 ford had a 60 and a 67 and 68 69 70 70 71 72 76 77 79 80 89 89 98 still  working on the 98|`|7a9hq9w8aa	I would never buy a new car when I can wait one year and buy a used one for half price. That's why you can't sell new cars. I've been told it costs Ford 2400 bucks to make a new mustang. If that's true it's the reason Ford is in trouble. Why would anyone support a company that marks up so much? Quit being greedy and we might buy more cars.
bqLvWpcZaa	I disagree with the previous post.  Parts for the W124 ( '86-'95 E-Class ) are actually relatively cheap, even from Benz dealers ( there are always some exceptions of course but for the most part, they're not bad... )  Also, Benz does not just stick to the mandated time for keeping older parts available for discontinued models.  You can still buy parts for Benz models from the 70's and even the 60's.  Many parts will be special order from Germany for those 30 and 40 year old cars, but they are still available.    Just keep in mind that this car is close to 20 years old.  Even though the W124 chassis is a solid design and very robust design, things will eventually break and fail.  Make sure that the previous owner(s) have maintained this car properly throughout the years and to have it inspected by a trusted shop or technician prior to purchase.|`|mwu6aJuyaa	Cars that were expensive new, have expensive parts in them. If you replace a part with a new part, guess what, it will be a new expensive part. That's why alot of really expensive cars drop in value so much once the warrenty is up.

The clutch, fluid damper, differential, suspension, etc to nothing to add any power at all.    One part of the puzzle that you do not include is the boost setting for your turbocharger.    As a very rough guess I would estimate you are gaining about 100 horse power from the turbocharger.  Maybe a little less as I see no mention of any sort of intercooler.    As a rough guess, I would estimate this engine is putting out about 250 horse power at the crankshaft.  You lose about 20% of your power from parasitic drag from your drive-line components.    I would estimate about 200 horse power at the wheels.  This is a very rough guess.  The only way to know for sure is by putting the vehicle on a chassis dyno.  But be warned.  Many people are very dissipointed as the actual power measured at the wheels is far less than you may think.|`|qxSlQoRAaa	Dude, just put it on a dyno. who the hell knows.|`|84dQOYpUaa	450+ depending on boost psi

51d9e39c71aaaed7424c9ac49e9069c5aa	I think that you are referring to the bowl vents.   I suspect that they stick up to eliminate the possibility of any fuel splashing over from the fuel bowls - unlikely, but I suppose it might be possible on an extremely rough road.|`|NbCBk3mqaa	vents|`|AA10346371	Fuel bowl vent tubes|`|TE9uGU4laa	vaccum pump tubes for the inflow of fuel and air mixture|`|zOIgzIy4aa	it sounds like a vacuum tube. probably a vacuum hose goes to it.

bkpa5OHtaa	You should also consider that such a car may be expensive to insure. Check your insurance rates before buying one, for example here - autoinsurance.undonet.com|`|jzh9PHm0aa	They are good suv's but the only problem is the gas.  Right now it is at a good price but you never know when it may go back up then it will cost you like 80+ to fill it.  Also make sure you check out other prices to make sure your getting a good deal.|`|NXwzuv3Paa	depends on your price range. do you like a large vehicle? do you need a large vehicle?|`|AA10871748	only you know if you can afford 340 for 3 years and the warranty should cover anything Major make sure you ask what it covers
5nSMfLd8aa	there are different sizes. depends on the model of the car.|`|808f8239addd67976faf828dba2a4992aa	Need to know if it's 5 hole or four hole, what manufacture the car is. lug studs can be 3/8 or 1/2 or 3/4 inch in diameter and the distance between the lugs will also be different depending on the rim size, a !6 inch rim will normally have a wider lug pattern compared to a 14 inch rim. So give us more information.

cc2b0d76cac98fbf61e197db52fde3caaa	low on brake fluid due to the pads wearing down and the calipers require more fluid to operate correctly and that reduces your fluid in the brake reservoir and it's kicking the sensor to tell you to check your brake system out, any way, just check the brake fluid level in the master cylinder and fill it up if it's down some.|`|6Buv3OEZaa	Definately seems like a brake fluid issue.  Could be low brake fluid, but you could also have a busted brake line under your car...check for a fluid puddle on your driveway or wherever you park your car.|`|TE9uGU4laa	check the brake fluid level check wires at the switch at the hand brake if not on the switch on the brake pedal itself it wont be a expensive job|`|t00QAsfJaa	break fluid or master cyclinder.to early i think for the cylinder to be out on your car so probably break fluid or new break pads|`|84dQOYpUaa	your master cylinder has a vacuum leak.  if you push the brake does the rpms rise a bit?  if so you have a leak, have a shop check all the break lines too|`|a919ffaf7b39c58d58f4680cb8cc3324aa	Well since you are about out of brake fluid yeah, this could be a very expensive problem.  It will be even more expensive when you get in the car, start driving then put your foot down only to find out the pedal goes to the floor and you don't slow down.      That moment is probably closer than you think.    Take it in IMMEDIATELY to get checked out.|`|zOIgzIy4aa	it could be different things like maybe the master cylinder is low or bad. maybe you have a brake line, hose or wheel cylinder leaking. better have someone you can trust to look at it. you can,t fool around with stuff when it comes to your safety.|`|uMKuOlFNaa	Check your brake fluid. If it is not low, then your master cylinder is going out. I am not too sure about the price (don't know where you live etc.) It's not extremely high around these parts..|`|HUluAQM3aa	Brake fluid reservoirs has level sensors.  I'll bet yours is low, add fresh brake fluid according to the type specified by Ford printed in your owner's manual.    What other critical fluids do you need to check now?  :)|`|qK1w972yaa	Once your breaks wear down to a point..Your break light will stay on...You need a break job...about $40.00 if you can get a friend to do it..At a shop...could be $150.00 just in labor..
IICFEIE0aa	Well from what I can see of the rust , and now that I know what kind of vehicle you have I would say between $200-$1000. Now if you take it to a body show , they can actually see it and give you a Free yes Free estimate|`|8468bdfd89a4b2535048ee892787ee1aaa	It is hard to estimate this without seeing the car and the area needed for repair.  I would recommend that you go to a reputable auto body shop for an estimate.|`|AN1EpGMqaa	I've done auto body repair for many years.When that rust reaches the inside edges especially there is nothing that can be done permanently.Even the best job is going to be temporary and expensive.Typically,it will cost several hundred dollars to buy a year's time.|`|uMKuOlFNaa	I'll do it for say... 10k Bring it by tomorrow, k?
bp59GQ0yaa	It is not illegal but if you are likely to be causing a problem for those getting in and out of the drive then it is pretty stupid.  Mainly because it is putting your car at risk of getting scratched/dented.|`|AA11908567	I don't think so, because if you think about it a garage in a lane is much narrower, and cars have no problem with this.|`|wpgRMjgraa	Depends where you live because in some states it is illegal to block a person from getting into or out of a driveway.|`|g2QUNwZzaa	its not illegal where i live...i've backed into 2 cars too...both times i took off tho|`|l6rSKl46aa	your fine. but if private property say good bye to your car|`|9ko5WUFkaa	Not illegal - however there is a stupid law in some places that it's illegal to back out of your driveway, you're meant to back into it ( I found out this the hard way - from the cops.  If the idiot hadn't of parked opposite my driveway on a narrow street I'd had never hit his car.  I got an $50 fine for backing out...)|`|eTTkAv9Yaa	Yes, if there is a dropped kerb you cannot park opposite, nor opposite a T junction for safety reasons.    This cannot be the only parking option, just the only one you / they are bothered to take.|`|8PO93dFZaa	no way i do it all the time|`|f8e72c6f0fb6056040e7f9fa1c5247aaaa	It's not illegal, but it's generally courteous to try not to.|`|HO5lWoNDaa	no this is not illegal just very inconsiderate    Infact if a driverway does not have a lowered kirb you can even part across it!|`|MPCfQuT5aa	No it is not illegal, unless there are yellow lines or other parking restrictions.|`|unBDeZ8Caa	No  its not illegal,only if you are blocking someones driveway.|`|vEv2YwWdaa	NO.  If the road is two cars wide, there should be no problem getting out of the drive way.  Unless you drive a bus.  As for the person that has hit cars and driven away.  I hope you get caught.  That is leaving the scene of an accident and causing damage.  You will be arrested.  If you do not get caught.  Karma is a *****.  Only a scum bag, driving a piece of crap car with little to no insurance would do that.  Have some class.|`|2e4136dce9654275a96b53a0c5bb55ffaa	No it's not illegal. Why would it be? If you can't pull out of your driveway without hitting a car parked on the OTHER side of the road, you shouldn't have a license to begin with.|`|yNvyuBSnaa	Im not sure its illegal but its just common sense. Im sure if you called and told them its your car and if they have a problem getting in or out just come and see you.|`|838a01bb0df6225499d20e0502eaf376aa	It's going to depend on the statutes in your city. It's not illegal where I live, but I think it's not very smart (as indicated by the idiot below who has run into two different cars and then driven off). If you have another option, take it. If not, cross your fingers. I live close to the high school stadium and twice have called the police to tow vehicles away when people going to the homecoming game have parked at the end of my driveway on my side of the road making it impossible for me to get out of my driveway.
IuF26BFSaa	well if you run both subs on the mono, then you can bridge it if the amp is bridgeable. if your peak wattage is 600, then you need a mono amp with 300 rms. i have mine bridged right now to a 2 channel so it is basically acting as a mono. i think that it gives more watts to the sub because the watts arent being split up. hope i helped!|`|YQ1Q7XeEaa	Really depends on the Amp.  Some can handle the in-series hook up better than others.    High end audio stores can probably make a couple of recommendations.|`|n5xNul6Yaa	(2) 4 ohm SVC subs wired in parallel to a mono amp is preferred over a two channel stereo amp with each of the subs wired to its own channel in regards to "bang for your buck".  A Class D mono amp is more efficient and will be less taxing on your electrical system.|`|T8AtmgETaa	well it depends on the amp. some amp can handle 2 subs being a mono amp and other can't. try it and c if ur amp shut off or not if it work with powering the 2 subs then i would keep the amp!

d9157449b4296a78a2d93140eae05e2baa	DO NOT trust it - DO NOT send info - it's a "419/Nigerian" advance fee scam/fraud, or a phishing (to do an identity theft) email. just delete the junk email.    From Toyota:  http://www.toyota.com/help/privacy.html    Information about Phishing Scams    There have been noticeable increases in the number of suspicious e-mails claiming that the e-mail recipient has won a Toyota lottery or other promotion. Sometimes the e-mail claims that the recipient has won a new Toyota Prius. In order to claim the prize, the e-mail asks that personal information (i.e. Full Name, Address, Nationality, Age, Gender, Occupation, Phone/Fax, and/or Country of Residence) be sent to a Hotmail or Yahoo e-mail address. Samples of these hoax e-mails can be found at the following web site: http://www.hoax-slayer.com/toyota-car-pr...  Note that these examples of the "phishing" hoax e-mails were not prepared by Toyota, all information and names contained in the hoax e-mails are fictitious, and any similarity to the names of actual people, including Toyota personnel, is entirely coincidental.    This type of e-mail solicitation is known commonly as a "phishing" scam, with the primary objective being to obtain one's personal information. This information can then be utilized to steal a person's identity. For example, a "Toyota Lottery" phishing scam is often sent from Chinese (.cn), German (.de) or British (.co.uk) addresses but can originate from anywhere and look very official even to the most savvy of Internet users. Neither Toyota nor any other reputable business will ever ask you for personal information through an unsolicited e-mail. Recipients of suspicious e-mail like this should delete the message from their in-box and, if possible, update their e-mail filter settings to block e-mails from the e-mail address being used. The Federal Trade Commission (http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/edcams/sp... and the Antiphishing workgroup ( http://www.antiphishing.org/ ) are also good sources of information about these types of security threats and how they may be reported to the authorities.      and also from Toyota GB:  http://www.toyota.co.uk/cgi-bin/toyota/b...  (You can also get the legitimate phone number of Toyota GB here to ask them directly, rather than the suspicious number in the email...)    Internet Scams  As a major international company Toyota's name is sometimes used by internet scammers to give credibilty to their activities, at the moment we are aware of two scams which are in no way associated with Toyota either in the UK or globally:     Toyota Lotto scam/The Toyota Lottery is in no way associated with Toyota either in the UK or globally. We advise all recipients of this email to ignore it, not to reply to this or any similar emails and to definitely not send any money or bank details to the senders. Yahoo have been informed of the situation and we hope that this will be resolved in the near future.     Scam recruitment emails It has been brought to our attention that various individuals and organisations are contacting people and/or operating internet sites that purport to provide employment opportunities within Toyota companies. Some such individuals and organisations advise job seekers that they must submit a processing or work permit fee in order to secure an offer of employment.     These are not legitimate Toyota offers. Please note that Toyota companies do not seek fees for securing a position as an employee. Therefore you should assume that such individuals and organisations are not providing bona fide offers.     Toyota, as well as any of its affiliates, disclaims all responsibility with respect to any expense, loss and/or damage of any kind, which might have occurred in connection with any e-job application and/or recruitment procedure.        (I've gotten the international lottery spam email more times than I can count... Sometimes Toyota, sometimes BMW, sometimes cash...)|`|3FKMMoXkaa	YES IT IS I GET IT ALL THE TIME DELETE IT DONT SEND THEM ANYTHING.|`|lYE34CVTaa	Spam! The first thing I always look at is where it is from, that is what I did on this. E-mails from the UK are most likely going to be spam unless you actually know someone from there then it would probably just be a personal e-mail not a winnng notice. If these were real, I would have sooooo much money. I have won the UK lottery so many times. LOL Never send information to these people.|`|55a7c9ee13be4af0516d03c798a92a60aa	wel if you give out all your info then im sure they will get a new credit card in your name do you live in the uk have you sign up for any prize or give aways peopel just dont win things without giving name  sorry scam|`|hah4QjZKaa	If you have to ask, it is best to simply hit the delete button.    How many times does one receive a prize notification for a contest you never entered?  Totally bogus.|`|AA11452643	Absolutely. If it sounds too good to be true it is usually because it is. One should be aware of any "giveaway", prize or lottery email coming from a different country.    I forward mine to the FBI and my state Attorney General.|`|iqWfufpUaa	Do not respond!  Hit the spam button and send them far away!  I have gotten more of these then I care to admit.    Do not give out any personal information - just hit the spam or delete button and send it far away!    It is all a con job to get your money.  There is never a legitimate sweepstake/lottery involved.
91365d1a40ff3d8ae08da3542098d99baa	check your timing|`|51d9e39c71aaaed7424c9ac49e9069c5aa	First, go over everything that you moved out of the way, tied up, twisted or disconnected and make sure everything is where it should be - and tight. Carefully check for any plugs or connectors that might have been missed. Don't laugh - it's easy to not notice a disconnected plug or wire hanging down the backside or hiding among the other wiring. If you find no concerns - you then have to determine if it's a fuel or ignition problem.  If it's getting spark, check the fuel pressure. If it's not, you've narrowed it down to an ignition concern.|`|X2ED3OrRaa	"I HATE THIS MOTOR"!!!!!  HELLUVA PERFORMER,.........GOOD FIGHT TO WORK ON!!!

People say Audis are reliable cars but bear in mind by 10 years old it'll only be as good as the maintenance it's had, and Audi parts cost big money! If you can satisfy yourself it's in decent nick then fair enough, if you really want an A3 that much, but I wouldn't spend that money on a 10 year old Audi.|`|AKHywxwlaa	yes|`|XVMxuADtaa	Yes.    But remember the car is almost 10 years old and will want work done at some point.    Being a quality brand of car, parts will be more expensive than say for a Focus or Astra but... you will buy them less frequently.    Set a bit of money aside for a rainy day and you won't go wrong.    But above everything have the car looked at by someone who knows cars and can help you to see the bad points of the car that you will miss because you fell in love with the car...|`|KsPoM07oaa	if general driving is what you will be using it for, get a vauxhall astra, i have one and i love it to pieces,|`|3IXDx9nhaa	I don't know a lot about cars but I do know that if you buy and expensive brand car that servicing and parts will cost you heaps more than more than more popular makes.

r1D9P4Vyaa	Ok to me it sounds like the alternator, A cars engine needs at least 9-volts to run. Anything under that it will die.Here is a cheap yet effective way you can test this yor self. Get the car started, (with nothing else on) when running, remove the negative battery cable, the engine should say running, if it dies the alternator has no output. Replace the alt. if it stays running then its your battery. Good luck! hope this saves you some $$$$$|`|TnIsuYqYaa	Have your alternator checked to see if its putting out charge,it sounds like your alternator has worn out and its not charging the battery.The headlights drain all the power from the battery thats why your car keeps dying|`|CnGR2xeoaa	It's your alternator. While the engine is running it gets its juice form the alternator and the battery charges. The battery is only used when the car is being started.  If the alternator is not working the engine will run off the battery.When you turn on your lights the extra burden on the battery causes a shortage of power to the engine and it dies.  Whatever you do, don't try testing the alternator by disconnecting the battery while the engine is running, someone will probably tell you to try this. If your alternator is working and you disconnect your battery while the engine is running you'll cause a spike in the alternator and cause it to fail then you'll have two problems.  Once your alternator is changed you should check the charge on your battery, bad batteries and faulty alternators go hand in hand.|`|Ty32khkaaa	You have a short, or a bad connection. Check for loose connectors.
ajnGHNr8aa	Check on the passenger side firewall area (between the engine and passenger compartment under the hold). There should be a metal post that has a red positive cable coming from it to the battery. Make sure this is tight and not burnt looking. If it is then replace it. This was a big problem for these vehicles, especially the police package vehicles. If this is ok, then you may have a fuel pressure problem.|`|B0WsLzUnaa	If it has an electric fuel pump, in the tank its time for a new one.
d9ECb7N8aa	88-98 (and 99 fullsize SUV) will be a direct fit. you could get some nice leather factory seats from a '95+ rig for fairly cheap. If you want heated, look in the first model Denali for the heated captain's. All you would need to do is the wiring for the heating elements.    The '99+ new body style seats will not be as easy of a swap. The brackets will need to be modified to follow the floor pan of the older truck, and I think you may need to pop some new holes as well. Keep in mind about differences in seatbelts (B-pillar mounted versus in seat mounted).|`|AXNkmdbKaa	I installed a full power white leather 60/40 1972 Buick Riveria seat in my 90 Silverado and it fit very well.
siHN027laa	Sailor has a good answer. If you're on the West Coast, try marine newspaper (it's free) The Log (on-line www.thelog.com) or one of the marine publications, Latitude 38, etc.    Don't forget eBay... I just bought a 8'6" Hypalon, NIB, RIB for under $1,100.   Had a problem with registration but eventually got that straightened out with the manufacturer. It's well built, solid, with seat, oars, patch kit and bellows. Solid transom that's and extension of the ridgid floor. Not bad for the $$$$/    Check out the Posting Boards at the marine stores in your area. Many stores have a big board where folks staple or pin little notices of what they have for sale.|`|qNDh5U0Haa	Craigslist is probably a good place to start.
kgk3Yz9Naa	i normally double check part numbers with my local car shop...if the part numbers are the same then they will fit...you could always search the local breakers yards.|`|4d1ed0b771143afc8f21cd1ebe05d5c4aa	The 145 was based on the Fiat Tipo platform, so some parts will be shared with other Tipo-platform vehicles. These include:  Alfa Romeo 146  Alfa-Romeo 155  Fiat Tipo  Fiat Tempra  Lancia Dedra  Lancia Delta (2nd generation, never sold in UK)    However, the driveshafts will depend on the age and engine type of the 145. Early 145 and 146 versions used the 4-cyl boxer engine derived from that used in the Alfasud, which placed the gearbox in a different position, so the driveshafts will be unique.The last 145 and 146 versions had a wider track, so again the driveshaft will be unique. In between the driveshafts may be common across similarly-powered models (so a Tipo 2.0 16v may use the same driveshafts as a 145 2.0, but a Tipo 1.4 will not).

uMKuOlFNaa	So she hit you in the side and not in the rear? It may very well fall back on you.. the only reason I say this is, she will claim your vehicle was out of control, spinning erratically and thus causing the accident.   Good luck with that.|`|WO68RZdIaa	One thing that no one has looked at. Once all of the facts are in and both insurance companies have talked, the blame can very well be equally placed on both you and the car that hit you, 50/50, due to your actions had started the chain of events that  led up to the other car hitting yours.    Not knowing the full story & having information from the other driver, not knowing what the speeds were that each of the cars were traveling, including the one in front of you that started to cause you to slide & other information- it is hard to say with any certainty that you, the first car, or the car that collided with your car was in fact at fault.    Based strictly on your statements above only- you were most likely traveling too fast for conditions & following too closely, which is why you lost control when the car in front of you abruptly turned. Also the car behind you may very well have also been traveling too fast for conditions & following too closely, which caused them to lose control in this situation- and that will cause both insurance companies to equally blame both drivers for the collision.|`|8GDBr2U9aa	You are at fault. It is your responsibility to stay in full control of your vehicle. The fact that is was slowing is irrelevant. You were either driving too fast for conditions, following too close, or both.|`|OgvkF5mvaa	gonna b her fault shouldnt have folllowed so close when u take ur driver tst or w.e they say on BAD CONDITIONS U should b atleast 2 car lenghts behind the other 1  1st it was snowing and icy  2nd she hit U  3rd U dint want insurence would have been cheaper on her to take it to maaco and get the dent removed  4th Both ur insurence gonna go up thanks to her  5th try calling her and tell her to call her insurence comp and she can take car of ur damage  finally if her car wass even a broken light she should get it fixed on her own     Sorry bout ur luck dude  I got ina wrecked messed u here front bumper she was 1/2 of her car in middle of the road and my car slided for bout 40 feet i was going fast got winter tires with good grip she got my info and everything shw was to call insurence but it was her moms car moms insurence she just got back her license after being suspended so she decided not to and all i got was a scrath on my 97ffront civic bumper lol hers was a 05 mountaner or w.e its called messed her sh1t up good  moral of story not ur fault she shouldnt have been driving to fast to not slow down in time|`|oKFAt7Lsaa	So she when you braked she, rather than go into you, overtook on your left and was at this time in the lane for on coming cars - you swerved right and left and a collision occurred.  She is in the wrong - as no damage to your vehicle both owners should pay for own damage.|`|uI4Dspi4aa	Its "ify"    Most likely they will say 50/50 due to the weather conditions. They will probably say she braked and lost control because you braked.|`|dyIyJqauaa	So, this is my answer.  You may share the fault with the other party  IE:.  "driving too fast for conditions".  She did right by involving the insurance companies.  Do not ever try to settle these things on your own.  try it sometime and you may regret it.  So. Brakes not breaks.   so?|`|BtqWVHk5aa	I would say that it's her fault. Legally, if anyone drives into the back of you it's their fault, even if you stop suddenly. Even though she collided with the side of your car rather than the rear, I would have thought the same principal applies. It was here responsibility to drive far enough behind you to be able to stop without hitting you, and she should have accounted for the weather conditions. You'll probably have to pay the excess on your insurance policy, but this should be repaid to you once the claim is settled, and it shouldn't affect your no-claims bonus if she is deemed responsible.|`|3NoQuoWuaa	The fault lies with the lady that hit your car. She was traveling too close for conditions. Assuming the police were not called and there is no police report, and providing you do not report it to your insurance company, your record should remain clean. Understand one thing. You have a period of time defined as "as soon as practical" to report the claim to your insurance company. She has two years (in most jurisdictions) in which to file suite against you claiming outrageous injuries and substantial damage to her car resulting from your negligence. At this point, you want your insurance carrier to defend you. Wisdom dictates to report it to your insurance company making no claim for damages. This is to protect your interest in your policy.r
dLMJrANiaa	Check to make sure you are actually getting spark.  Remove spark plug boot and insert a phillips head screwdriver.  Place the screwdriver next to something grounded (cylinder head) and have some1 kick it over. If no spark, suspect that the kill switch is shorted somewhere & not allowing the coil to spark. Many ways to check that problem.  The loud, high pitched blast out the muffler is cause by all the fuel you are dumping into the cylinder that is not being combusted and finding it's way out of the exhaust port. If the bike backfires, you are probably getting some spark.  The other guy is right also, this could be just a timing issue. I don't know how those bikes are timed though.  Good luck!|`|u0PHhZOSaa	el oh el... sounds like to me your  bike is flooded. take the the exhaust off and empty all the gas out of it and check in side the cylinder again by looking in thur the exhaust port. also clean you carb too. if not check you kill switch and all your ignition wires. good luck.|`|DOw7gdOAaa	You have tryed preety much everything just take it to a mechanic|`|YoLa0aE8aa	Hmmmm this is a stumper i have a Suzuki but mine only stalls once every hundred rides.

de641317a0696a8d53df9d1538305a2baa	As a bus driver, you should have a rulebook or a set of rules to go by. You needed to study them to get that special school bus license. What do the rules say?    I have an 8 year old and I would NEVER want him to be left alone.  He does know where the spare key is in order to get into the house, but with snow on the ground, he wouldn't be able to get it.    Here in CT, any elementary school child (not middle school-aged) must be met at bus by an adult.  If not, the bus driver beeps. If no one meets the bus then, the bus driver is to drive the child back to the school and bring them to the office.    For your own peace of mind (and the CYA method of employment), find out exactly what needs to happen in those types of scenarios to be better prepared for next time.

ybVzFAhHaa	If the carb has never been rebuilt its about time to. Over time the gaskets wear out and you start getting leaks as well dirt and sand in the bowls. Depending on how much time and experience you have you can do it yourself or take it to a shop. Try to run some fuel cleaner through first but that probaby wont help much if it is as bad as you say. Best thing to do is take the carbs off and take them apart on a clean cloth. Clean every part of the carb with carb cleaner and let them dry. Go to a local shop and buy a carb rebuild kit. This won't be very expensive but it will make all the difference. Make sure you pay attention to the steps you take taking it apart so you can reverse the order when putting it back together. The two things you should invest in are a carb rebuild kit which will include all new gaskets and a repair manual which will have all of the diagrams you need. All together this shouldn't cost you any more than 50 to 80 bucks. Before you do anything with the carbs check your spark plugs if you havn't done so yet. Good luck!

Ever.  4) Once you wire the funds to the fake escrow account, the "seller" then empties out that account and runs.   5) If you are taken by this scam, you have less than a one percent chance of getting your funds back.

OR maybe this is a "body" car.  Sometimes when a person has died in a car and it sat for a while the stench will never come out of the car and should be sent to the junkyard.  When you get it most definitely have it checked out by a mechanic.  The best way to tell if a car has been wrecked and repainted is to open the door and compare the paint on the inside trim to the paint on the outside.  If it differs at all then it has been wrecked.  Good luck.  Maybe it will turn out to be a good deal.    Oh wait...will he be shipping it from over seas?  Yeah, that's not a good idea.  I was thinking he was over seas and the car was here.  Someone in the military does NOT take their car over seas with them when they are deployed.  This is most likely a scam.  Do not do this.

ifNr13kfaa	Well it depends on how functional you want the thing to be.  A typical Nighthawk stealth aircraft can only functionally fit 2 people if I'm correct, and it costs nearly $40 million to produce due to the devices insides.  If you're making a giant model you can prolly bring it down to a hundred thousand likely...If your trying to make a functional one, you'll need the basic aircraft (meaning $40 million), modify the the interior to fit 4 people, meaning your either going to have to make the cockpit longer (you'd be limiting flight capabilities) or make it broader (in which you'd have to fully modify the damned intake [which would be a *****]).  Honest to God mate, building a flyable F-117 Nighthawk is idiocy.  The second that thing takes off, your getting shot down unless you have clear consent from air control, government, and anything else that might be controlling skies.    So again lets break this down.    $40 million for basic aircraft  Excess $5 to $10 million for modifications.    And don't even try modifying the engine and weight or you can screw up stability and kill yourself.  The aerodynamics of the aircraft require months and months of testing to match up with the output of the engines.    :::Edit:::    Now that I think about it, you could convert the bomb's bay, but then again, the issue of money is still applicable here...|`|2dxsDdBvaa	Play the lottery !!! unless you got that 500 million....|`|0CkFC43raa	how close to exact are you looking for? if you want an aircraft that bears a passing resemblance to the F117, you can save a lot of money because you can make the plane smaller with far fewer systems. you also don't need the weapons bays and you don't need the stealth materials. in this case your biggest expenses will be the engines, which will cost you a pretty penny, and the flight control system as you will need one that will compensate for the inefficiencies of the planes aerodynamics. you should have the help of an aircraft designer though to help with the structure of the plane, but figure when all is said and done, you will probably have upwards of $2 million invested in the aircraft.|`|c34895fb3078ed6b839d8ec9443a9ab2aa	My question is "Why"?  The Stinkbug is not the most efficient design vis-a-vis aerodynamics and fuel.  It was a deliberate engineering decision to trade off efficiency for radar evasion-don't see why you'd need or want this.  The faceted design is going to cost you some serious change-you'll have to build the machine tools to create them-not a standard fuselage/wing profile.  Stinkbug's a single-seater, and no there's no room in the weapons bay for a single person, let alone 2-3.|`|SLNd60cCaa	3.2 billion(american billion) is the avarge cost of developing a comercial jet, if its milatary then many many more.  good luck with that, if you make one, i will buy one=]
78e4081014f25f2f27e0302c168080c5aa	The 2010 Fusion Hybrid actually rates at 35 mpg, and there are no redesigns on the 2010 Taurus, it is still the same, don't where you seen that at, but I just got my booklet from Ford this week.  I was hoping to see the new Ford Fiesta this year, and had hoped they would get it out, but it was not included in this years models.  The Fiesta has been pushed ahead for economy reasons, and I can't figure out why it wasn't brought out sooner, a subcompact would have helped Ford in the market much sooner than when they decided to produce it.  The Raptor F150, is one mean 4x4 machine from SVT, I do wish they would have added a supercharged 5.4 liter to the package, that would have been sweet.  The arrival that I am waiting for though, is the new 2010 Fusion Sport.  I love the Fusion, it drives and handles like a dream, but this year, they stuffed the 3.5 liter from the Taurus into it making 263 hp.  It should be extremely fun to drive, the old 3.0 liter was great in this car, and they even bumped it up another 19 horsepower for 2010, but the 3.5 should make the Fusion a little monster.  I can't wait till we get one in, I have alerady asked about buying one for myself.  Ford has done better in the European market than in the US market lately, which gives it more capitol to throw around than GM and Chrysler.  I hope that Ford continues to do better than the other two, my job depends on it.  If any auto manufacturer goes out of business in the US, it will not be good.  Parts suppliers may provide parts for all major manufacturers, a shortage for one will be ashortage for all.  American car companies are not the only ones suffering here at the moment.  ALL auto manufacturers in the US are showing substantial losses from the poor economy, foreign companies included.  Doesn't matter how many miles per gallon you can get if you don't have a job and can't afford gas or a car payment.  I would rather feed my family than drive a new truck, can't say I blame people for not buying a new vehicle.|`|hDAoKmjPaa	ford is and always well be on top, have you seen the new 150 raptor that truck is kick as$ for a stock truck|`|2ee9ba3f8fa52a8c3bd583c6f12f11b8aa	They had some good stuff on display at the Detroit auto show.

0TVenxJyaa	Your 'stang is most likely equipped with Ford's C-4 automatic transmission. In order for it to upshift automatically it needs to have throttle plate position input.  This is the job of the vacumn modulator located externally in the rear of the trans. There is a vacumn hose attached to the part, the other end goes to the intake manifold. This hose (line) must be intact, if it is then the modulator itself is leaking, however this will manifest itself with billows of exhaust smoke out the tailpipe as ATF is sucked thru the vacumn line, into the intake, and burned in the cylinders.  You may of overlooked reconnecting this line or connected it to the wrong source, it needs to be connected to a manifold vacumn supply, i.e. anywhere below the carburetor throttle plate.  If you drive the car long and far enough, it will upshift, but very harshly and late as governor pressure within the trans. takes over.  Look for a steel line with sections of rubber tubing on each end running down to the transmission and up to the manifold/carb. area  Don't confuse the cooler lines with this vacumn line however.  Hope this helps|`|yBc0HJifaa	kalanika that gave the correct and best answer. Tony L was good but I am sure a '66 has a kick down rod and not cable.

ktMefP0oaa	your fan should come on (electric) to cool your radiator and compensate for the extra drag on your engine, raise your hood and start your van, look at fan, then turn your A/C on, fan should come on immediately, if you have two fans only one will come on when A/C is turned on, the other is temp controlled and works with a electric thermostat. If your fan does not come on when A/C is activated, unplug your fan and run a neg and pos wire to the fan connector and ensure fans are operational, doesn't really matter which wire goes on what side the fan will just turn in opposite direction, will not hurt anything but will show motor is good or not, if it is, change the A/C fan relay, should be in a fuse box on left side (drivers side) under the hood.

A 5th gear allows the motor go spin slower at high speed. This makes cruising at high speed more comfortable, and also gives you better fuel consumption.      You would think there'd be less wear on the engine when it's turning slower, so it would last longer.  But if you look at motorcycle stats, there doesn't seem to be a correlation between engine life and 'piston travel per mile'.|`|pckuIRhsaa	Two engines can have the same max rpm and have different torque curves, A 4 speed tranny will normally be matched to an engine with a broader toque curve and a 5 speed to one with a narrow curve. Narrow curves usually deliver faster acceleration and broad curves are more for cruisers and more relaxed riding.|`|5s6iZ7OVaa	You need some gramatical help.    Each gear has a different ratio, so when climbing higher in the gear box the smaller gearing makes for a higher speed.

You lose in terms of traction because you have less contact surface, but at the same time, that reduction in area is good for fuel efficiency.    As for being dangerous, it is not.  I would say that if it drives okay for you and you're not constantly losing traction or having issues with going around corners, then keep the tires and change next time.|`|mwu6aJuyaa	The difference in these tires is in the width and the sidewall height. I'll start with the sidewall height. If your sidewall is shorter you will have A. a smaller overall diameter and therefor your speedometer will not be accurate because it's based on the 60 not the 55. And it will also effect how the car feels when you make quick manoeuvres. A taller sidewall will have more flex and allow more sway in the tire than a shorter more ridged sidewall. The shorter wall makes the car feel more responsive.    This website has a tire comparison calculator, you might be interested in trying out.  http://home.netcom.com/~sgalaba/tiresize...    The biggest issue is the width of the tire. Your current 195's are not as wide as the 215's. This creates a smaller contact patch. The suspension, tire pressure and weight distribution of the car were all designed for tires rated at a width of 215. This will effect your overall performance. The wider tire, having a better contact patch will also get your better grip in corners and allow you to stop faster.    I should say that your current tires wont cause any real harm and should still be safe. I would recommend going back to your wider tires if your financially able to do so.

However, you need the licence to drive it, and without a licence a person will never qualify for insurance discounts, it will always be top base rate.<br>  I had a neighbour lady who never drove in her life, but maintained a car, licenced and insured, until she passed at 80 years old.

tnkp8n2Zaa	 estephen is right. i use a heat gun and a roller, some dynamat products have come a long way from the old thick and heavy asphalt based sheets that smelled bad and gave up too soon. make sure you clean the metal well especially in door panels which may have waxy coatings.<br>  there are other deadening materials that are mineral based that are cheaper and easier to use cascade is on at close to half price and dont forget sprays for hard to reach areas. a local automotive supply company even has sheets of material for $2.oo a foot that i use for not so crucial areas.<br>  anyway hot days are best and i have even used my oven to evenly heat the sheets along with a gun but the dyna pro should be easier hen the original|`|dh0ht13Daa	Ofourse you should use a heat gun.  If you want the stuff to look good after you put it on and actually stay put.  You need to use a heat gun and a roller.  Just remember dont hold the heat gun in one spot for to long, because that stuff will melt and trust me its messy.

AA11914369	Can you?  Of course you can.  You can also sue the local police force for allowing him to drive without insurance.  You can sue the bank that loaned him the money to buy it.  You can sue me if you want to.  But just because you can, doesn't mean you will prevail, or even that you should.    If you are a responsible person, you will have "Uninsured Motorist" coverage on your own insurance police, who will take care of your losses and sue the guilty party for the return of what they paid out.  If not, and he didn't buy the car with cash, the bank that financed him would seem to have the deepest pockets, and an obligation to insist on insurance to protect themselves from loss.    But no, why would the dealer be liable?  I would bet they can produce a paper signed by the seller that states "I have insurance".    Step one before you look for someone to sue is to send the person that hit you a bill for your damages.|`|8GDBr2U9aa	No. Only if the vehicle still belongs to the dealer. File a claim against your uninsured motorist coverage and your insurance company will go after them.|`|87408768d47de156f32bf8650a530f1caa	I would doubt it.  Call Sam Bernstein.

Once the buyer signed papers and drove the car off the lot, it is their problem and their responsibility.|`|HYnFU39Naa	The only way the dealer would be liable is if the dealer, knowingly sold the car to a person with no insurance if your state requires it. But if the person had insurance at the time when they bought it and it expired, then it's not the dealers obligation to make sure you keep insurance.
X2ED3OrRaa	If this is what you need then I would say ,YES!   Before any money, get all the insure you can, written and otherwise.  get all the guarantee's in writing.   Buying 'used' is always a gamble so do all you can to protest your interest!    On the other hand, get your mechanic's advice and help.

S9QyF6NQaa	wire then through a relay switch which is tired in to an ignition hot circuit.  this was when the cars ignition is off the relay will turn the lights off, and the relay will turn on the lights whenever you turn on the ignition, i good circuit to use for ignition hot would probably be the headlights, radio, or blower motor.|`|zotCYH89aa	Two answers above are sort of right but wrong unless I am misreading them, he still cannot power these lights from an existing circuit on the car (unless he finds an unused circuit from some option his car did not come with.) as it will overload it.   What you CAN do (assuming he wants control manually whether they are off or on) is use a SECOND relay inline with the trigger signal before his existing relay that is itself only energized when the car's ignition is in the run position. As all that relay will be powering is the signal to his existing relay then he CAN tap into any switched circuit in the car without worry.   Call it a "dependent" gate in his current circuit, he can switch on the fog lights as he likes but the signal to that relay will only reach it to trigger it on if the additional relay is latched by ITS signal that the car's ignition is in the run position. Shut the car off, that relay opens, and then that first relay also loses its signal and the lights go off.    I believe the scheme with the high/low beams may be flawed as the low beams stay on when the high beams come on.|`|w4kdTalPaa	Legally the fog lights should work with the low beam headlights and go off when you turn on the high beams. So to be legal you want to splice into the low beam headlight power wire then they will turn on and off with the headlamps. Or you can locate a fuse in the fuse block that is only powered while the vehicle is running. You will need a simple test light to do this. Once you locate the proper fuse you can splice your fog lamps to it.
kjAWsDwLaa	Yes, you'll have to visit the dealer, since the codes and programming are specific to the vehicle.  As I remember, it cost us about $95 for all of that for a Ford a few years ago.  You might Google "auto remote keyless entry" or similar wording and see if there is an alternative.|`|WPYjdsA4aa	your Nissan dealer should have one

9zsj3HBlaa	Well, First Take Off Your Battery Cables, And Clean The Terminals, If That Doesn't Work Make Sure The Cables Are Secure, If That Don't Work, Follow The Cables From The Battery To The Starter, Making Sure There Are No Breaks In Them Causing Wire To Metal Contact.  If All That Fails, Simply Take Off The Starter, And Take It To A Dealer, Shop, Car Parts Store, And They Will Tell You If Something Is Wrong With It At No Costs.  JMHO. -Vic.|`|AjOfc8HPaa	if its having trouble it could be the starter but also something else like a control module even an alarm ... my suggestion is either take it to a shop have them figure it out and if you can take it home replace it yourself that would at least save you on labor or diagnose the vehicle yourself. without the proper tools though it will be difficult also you will need to buy the book so you know what the specifications are on the vehicle and what information the vehicle needs to start... sorry i could not be of more help|`|AA10665978	Check the terminals they might be tight enough for the lights to come on but not for the starter to kick,also check all those other wires connected to the terminals|`|R4dXZhW6aa	Did you have any problems before you changed the battery, overlook the work you have done.|`|b7c27e08f889b290ffeccaad96efaf6baa	Sounds like you have a bad relay.
E9KyCM6baa	Have the CV joints checked.  A clue that they may be bad is if you find grease on the back side of your tire or inside the wheel well.  You have four CV joints.  One on each end of your front axles.  When the rubber boots around the CV (or Constant Velocity) joints get worn and crack they allow the grease inside to spin out of them.  If they are not attended too soon enough then all the grease escapes, the cracks in the boots get bigger, and this allows water and dirt to enter the CV joint.  That causes the joint to wear and get sloppy.  What you are feeling is the axle being allowed to spin off center and at high speeds which can create a lot of vibration.  At low speeds in turns the CV joint is wobbling enough, putting pressure against your effort to steer, to make the wheel feel like it's about to pop off.  You can possibly damage wheel bearings this way, and may cause some aligment issues, but if you stopped driving it soon enough then you should just be looking at a new front axle.  Though it's just the joints at the end of the axles that are bad, it's usually a lot more cost effective and saves time to replace the whole axle.  Even if you only have this problem on one side I'd recommend haveing both axles replaced.  That's unless the other side had been done recently.  Once they are done though, you'll be good to go for a long time after.|`|S9jyc95jaa	While I'm not familiar with Ford Escorts or any problems or recalls they may have had, most often if there's a shimmy in the car, it's your front end alignment.  You may also need to have your tires rotated.  Judging from what you've said, worst case scenario is that it could be a ball joint or a suspension problem.  I would suggest you have the car looked at by a licensed mechanic.  It's kind of hard to diagnose these things over the Internet.|`|T6y2zIO1aa	Whatever you do, do not check the link Sdgfgh K posted. It is a trap.<br>  Take your car to a repair shop for a diagnoses.<br>  |`|JCaAqF1vaa	Yes, you need a new CV joint or there is suspension or steering gear damage, There may be other damage due to the continued driving. The repair can cost between $500 and $1000. |`|AA10665978	Get the tires checked or have someone check the cv joints they cost about $90 each plus labor
E9KyCM6baa	What do you mean you hear it when the car is off?<br>  <br>  If the sound changes at all when you push the clutch then it might be the throwout bearing.  It's a bearing that rides against the clutch pressure plate.
