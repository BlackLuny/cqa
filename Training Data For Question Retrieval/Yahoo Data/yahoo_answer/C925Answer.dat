HhaadKixaa	Sometimes good people make bad financial decisions. Chapter 13 may be for you, You can declare bankruptcy but still pay back in payments manageable between your income and what the judge see's fit for you. When we filed a Chapter 13 I was like what did we do?? bcs now Im stuck paying back part of this 80k I was in debt for. Defeating the purpose of a bankruptcy.So i left my Job temporarily and we converted to chapter 7 and were done. Debt behind us. If your husband loses his job you may be able to qualify for chapter 7 because there are income qualifications that your attorney can go over with you to see if you can meet. As far as you credit is concerned its not as big a deal as you think. You have credit card offers in the mail with 3 months after you file..lol. With the bankruptcy rate at nearly 4 mill a year i doubt the lenders in a few years will look to harshly upon your credit history.|`|OA3Mgsuaaa	Ignore spam like above.<br>  If you discharge your debts, it will be a long time before you can buy a home. However, its going to be a long time with 70k of debt too. You need to contact your lenders, and see if you can arrange lower interest payments in lieu of filing.|`|12VQ4ETcaa	If you declare bankruptcy, you won't be able to do it again for 10 years.<br>  <br>  You should make some calls and see if you can get a consolidation loan, or if your creditors will consider adjusting your interest rate.  If you have been making payments on time, you should have some leverage here.<br>  <br>  You shouldn't even consider buying a house until your finances are stable and you have significant savings.  Owning a house often means your mortgage payment is higher than what you used to pay for rent, plus you are responsible for upkeep and repairs.  You'll also have to pay water, sewer, garbage, and property tax.  It costs a lot more than people usually expect.|`|LK3PJVD3aa	You need to contact an unbiased credit help firm. Consumer Credit Counseling Services is a legit organization that can help you determine your best options. Bankruptcy is a big deal and not to be taken lightly.|`|S1O84P7caa	If you really don’t want to file bankruptcy one of the best ways that I have heard to start paying off your debt is to begin with your highest interest rate bill and pay it as much as possible every month while paying the minimum on all your others, when paid off then move to the next highest, and so on. I would under no circumstances consolidate your loans it will not help you pay them off faster. If you go into credit counseling it will look almost as bad on your credit as a bankruptcy. Always verify what you hear before you take the most obvious answer. <br>  <br>  As far as buying a house I would not do that unless you feel that your jobs are secure or that will be another problem that you may be getting yourself into. Try finding an owner financed home or a lease option from a for sale buy owner, if you cant pay the loan wont be in your name so you can walk without credit issues. Just try not to put to much down because you will lose it. <br>  Start going to some REIA (real-estate investment association) meetings in your area look it up on Google.  <br>  You will find a lot of opportunities by associating with the realtors, mortgage brokers and investors who have creative ideas. <br>  Good luck.

12VQ4ETcaa	Usually you would take a job in a warehouse and they would train you to use the forklift.  According to OSHA, it is the employer's responsibility to develop a safety training program.<br>  <br>  The pay would most likely depend on where you work.  You can also operate forklifts on construction sites.|`|fbdad2836b12a55aac5a35bcb551f09caa	Forklift operators are certified at the facility, rather than getting specific training. Even if a person was a forklift operator for 20 years at another company, by OSHA requirements, they have to be certified at each new facility. <br>  <br>  As far as the range of pay, that would vary from one company to another. Your best option is to get hired in a factory as a general laborer and then watch for an opportunity to move into a forklift driver position. Since they typically pay slightly higher than most general laborer positions, most of the time, the supervisors will pick an experienced worker to move into an available position.
GkSCipsHaa	Yes. Whether you can file for a chapter 7 (discharge) or are required to file a chapter 13 (repayment plan) depends primarily on your income.  If you are below the median income, a chapter 7 can wipe out the judgments against you.|`|GtBOQPKqaa	Once you declare bankruptcy, ALL actions, from lawsuits to wage garnishments, are "stayed," that is, prohibited from going forward. You didn't mention whether it was from one credit card company, or more than one, but that doesn't matter; all would be told, "stick it in your ear" with a bankruptcy petition.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind, though, that if you file under Chapter 13, which provides for reorganization, and you do not adhere to the plan as provided by the bankruptcy court trustee, any of your creditors could file a motion to vacate the stay, which would allow them to go forward with their legal action as originally filed, whether it's an eviction, wage garnishment, or lawsuit.<br>  <br>  At the time my friend and his wife filed for bankruptcy protection recently, one of his creditors, a credit card company, had a garnishment of his wages for about $300 per month. The bankruptcy stayed that, and in an interesting twist, even led to a REVERSAL of the latest garnishment! Once their bankruptcy has been discharged, all garnishments, lawsuits, etc., are discharged as well.<br>  <br>  When I declared bankruptcy a few years ago, the day I filed saw the arrival of a lawsuit brought by one of my creditors for some $8,000 in unpaid credit card bills. That suit ceased to be an issue with the discharge of my bankruptcy.<br>  <br>  The bottom line, though, is that once your bankruptcy has been discharged, the garnishments from those creditors are over - for good.|`|NcFWcO3Laa	Bankruptcy is a little more difficult today than it was a few years ago.  The judge will probably require you reorganize your finances and pay back at least a portion of your debt based on your current income.  The judge can release the garnishment,<br>  <br>  It is no longer the policy of bankruptcy court to let the debtor just totally walk away from their obligations, especially if your income hasn't changed, a divorce, loss of job, or illness etc.|`|HhaadKixaa	Yes, when my husband and I filed we had several judgments on us.

In the case of pension income, it is generally valued to a multiple of 20 when calculationg the lifetime allowance. In Sir Fred's case, if we ONLY take the income part of his pension, which is - cough - ￡693,000 - cough, cough, cough -  into account (no-one seems to be talking about the tax free lump sum that he gets up front when he retires, which is also likely to be obscenely huge), this benefit would be valued as ￡13,860,000. That's 8.4 times the current lifetime allowance!<br>  <br>  However Sir Fred will be OK because of "transitional protection", which exempt these disgustingly huge pensions from being subject to the new penalty tax charges, as long as you register for it by April this year.

Turbo tax (and several other software programs) had a minor flaw this year when they first came out. These flaws have been fixed with the updates that you can download. These flaws don't cause errors on your tax return, they just caused concern and confusion for people like you who saw their refund amount drop.<br>  <br>  What these software programs did is they started out by assuming that you did not receive the stimulus money last year, and therefore that you would be entitled to claim the recovery rebate credit, which is your 2nd chance to claim the stimulus. Then when it asked you if you already received it, and you put in the amount, it subtracted that from the credit and it made it look like your refund went down. <br>  <br>  The recovery rebate credit is on the 2008 tax forms as a 2nd chance for people to claim the stimulus if they didn't receive the full amount last year. Nobody gets the money twice so turbo tax hasn't cheated you out of anything. Its just that it assumed you hadn't received the stimulus yet, then changed that assumption when you put in that you already got it.|`|MvC6n3DWaa	There is a flaw in Turbo Tax where it is deducting the stimulus payment incorerctly.

You just are not eligible to receive any more than you qualify for.  The amount you received last year is used this year only to determine if you received all you were eligible for last year.  In many cases taxpayers did not receive any or all of the stimulus last year due to having too much income, too little tax liability or claiming a new child this year.  <br>  <br>  Therefore, you are receiving the refund you are due.<br>  <br>  Laura H – H&R Block – Senior Tax Advisor 5 <br>  **This advice was prepared based on our understanding of the tax law in effect at the time it was written as it applies to the facts that you provided.|`|ug00j0S8aa	Turbo Tax calculated your refund as though you received no rebate last year (2007 taxes in 2008).

He HAS to cross the exterior of her property to access your apartment.   He is certainly subject to trepassing laws.<br>  <br>  She sounds a little off, but so do you.

You will have to identify your group and prove discrimination.<br>  <br>  You sue in small claims for unlawful eviction, but you will lose that one.

In VA the landlord can restrict all those things you mentioned including not allowing you to have sex in your apartment, but it has to be expressed in writing in the contract or rental agreement.  It could be something implied like "no immoral behavior"...that would stand up in court.

91XVWCWWaa	The bank has approved to accept a lower amount than the actual original loan that is what a short sale is.  Your offer is higher than they anticipated so you have a better chance at purchasing the home.  It doesn't go quicker because the bank would have to accept the short sale before the process can start.  My question is, did you have a home inspection done so that you know what you are getting?  Not only does the inspector find things that might be wrong (lender not legally responsible for repairs) but can tell you whether the house is really worth what your offering.  If it is not appraised correctly the loan will not go through.  Do you have enough money for the Earnest Deposit?  There are alot more questions here that you may want to be asking.

At that point it move upward and upward.  just kidding<br>  <br>  NO ONE knows.<br>  <br>  One thing that seems apparent to me, from last summer to this week; each time a government official (be it W, O, or Democrat leadership) came before a crowd of cameras, they spoke of greater government intervention into more phases of our personal and businesse lives.  With each announcement, the market moved DOWN.  <br>  <br>  The election of Obama was not a CHANGE from Bush, it was an acceleration in the wrong direction.<br>  <br>  It is hard to imagine any dramatic recovery while  the current government continues to not only interfere with the private sector but to demonize business and business leaders. <br>  <br>  If you will take a long view for your investing, then you might want to consider dollar cost averaging into the market as you might do with your 401(k).|`|Ch9TedMcaa	I doubt anyone knows for sure.|`|444pPdy5aa	Jim Cramer says 5320<br>  <br>  I say 5600|`|AcgDcQG0aa	A lot of people who are loosing their jobs now probably are taking some of their money out of mutual funds and other investments in the stock market.  <br>  <br>  And a lot of baby boomers who are getting close to retirement probably are pulling their investments out of the stock market too due to the risks involved.<br>  <br>  Many pension funds are underfunded now.  And many of them might be selling their stock market investments in order to pay pension benefits to retirees.<br>  <br>  And many of the rich investment bankers and hedge funds who used to borrow a lot of money and buy like crazy a lot of stocks can't borrow and buy like they used to.<br>  <br>  It's hard to say how low Dow will go.

The Dow probably will stay low for a long time.|`|dJnRFpWWaa	No one has a crystal ball, but certainly when GE is trading at $7.50 and reputable analysts believe the stock is worth $12 in the worst case scenario (but won't rate it a BUY because they are worried about what short sellers can and have done to the stock,) then you have to believe that the bottom is nearing. <br>  <br>  The financial component of the Dow has been seriously compromised by unrestrained short sellers. At some point long-term investors will overcome their fears, but in the meantime the market is ruled by traders and especially short sellers and the SEC has made it impossible for companies to protect the value of their stock.<br>  <br>  If you ever see any movement by the SEC to reinstate the uptick rule and/or to adopt mark-to-model accounting, then a bottom will be reached shortly thereafter. If not, then the short sellers will continue to drive down the value of the bank stocks and long-term investors will remain invested in T-bills and the economy will remain in free fall and the bottom in the stock market will not be reached for a long time.|`|809fe92a5e8a388fd9915476812d008caa	I will echo the answers of those above: nobody knows.

Im not sure this will work but it could.  Now she has a FHA loan.  She could then streamline the loan and add your husband to the loan (no credit qualifications), this can normally be done in a couple months.  Now the mom and your husband is on the loan.  Now you husband proves that he has made the payment by himself for 6 months while on title.  He can then streamline and she can be removed from the loan.  Once again no credit required other then good house payments.<br>  <br>  Its possible but it takes steps.|`|N7G26k4Iaa	Most likely not as you and your husband have bad credit.|`|23SkYEw5aa	Sure, buy it from the mother.  <br>   <br>  Or she can deed the house to him, but she would lose ownership and still owe the mortgage, NOT A SMART IDEA on her part.|`|AA10263406	"She does have a joint bank account together with my husband that she deposits our monthly payment to and pays the house."

Leave the situation as it is, and thank his mom every day for giving you guys a place to live. <br>  <br>  I'm hoping that was a typo. If you have been paying for the property, and can prove it, and she wants to sell, go to a bank and speak with a loan officer about using the proof of payment as part of your application.

I think if you look into different areas - even like Florida - in regards of real estate values, you need to see what makes those areas special and why would people like to live there.<br>  For Example Florida will always have the "nice weather and beach feature" what people like, other areas are offering other desirable features like good job market, good infrastructure, skiing, big City and others.<br>  You might need to do some studies for certain areas and then think why do people would like to live there - see which area gets the most "plus" points, this will be most likely the area which holds their values best.|`|tdQTZPI7aa	Bergan county NJ.

Check around for the best rates as they vary for children accounts -- some institutions offer special "small" savers accounts.  Savings bonds are also an easy way to set aside money for children and if they are titled correctly, they may be cashed for education without any income taxes due on the interest.  Interest is generally taxable to the children; however, unless the amounts are significant, there usually are no taxes due.

H17L1WW4aa	The second mortgage will foreclose against the home.  The first mortgage has first right of the home, but since its the same back I think they will let them buy themselves out.  If the second was with another bank they might be a little more reserved, but since they have the first and second they will look at it like you are not paying the first.<br>  <br>  Try and figure it out because the bank has the first 2 positions so they look at it as a first mortgage either way.|`|49740c9daeea677fc86801fb2b3f41deaa	Yes, it will be foreclosed, there is no difference.

Your question is way to broad.  Also Fannie or Freddie can hold a mortgage that isnt conventional (conventional only dictates how its underwritten)

ThW5skBOaa	Why cant they refinance? Rates are at a low rate. Is there house worth less then what they owe? Also the stimulus is for reasons like this so they need to look it to a second mortgage or refinance. Also if they walk away they will be foreclosed on. I have been thru this already last year but my house was in wonderful condition, and it sold for $120,000 and I owed $159,000 and appraised for $250,000 before the market went bad.<br>  They may end up still having to pay some of the mortgage even after they sell because they may not get enough for the house to clear you from owing.<br>  They really need to look into all their options first.|`|zHmZkMStaa	They're out of luck - unless they had house insurance, and it's a covered repair?

dRezbY31aa	The ADHD is a waiver with BCBS in my state. This means they will accept the application but will not cover any treatment or any conditions resulting from the ADHD. Depression is also a possible waiver. They will need to get your doctor records prior to issuing the policy, which can take several weeks. Depending on your records both conditions together may result in a decline. This is why you needed to contact a local agent that works with BCBS as well as all of the other major companies in your area. The agent can do this work prior to the application and can follow up with the application as it goes through the underwriting process. There is no extra charge using an agent.<br>  <br>  For your mom, unless she is over age 65 she will only get Medicare if she contacts social security and gets approved for disability.

You are allowed to keep the old health insurance  for at least 6 months if you make the COBRA payments.

A personal loan is of course possible, but more difficult because you have no collateral.  <br>  Equity lines also will have a lower interest rate.  If he was rejected on the home equity, then he will most likely be rejected on the personal loan.  The new debt would increase his debt to income ratio and Frannie and Freddie's guidelines are more strict due to the subprime bubble burst.

To work there you have to have basic tax knowledge.  Block and its competitors have classes from which they hire the best students. In my state, California, this would qualify you to take the California Tax Education Council exam and be licensed to prepare returns for compensation.  Oregon and Maryland have similar laws.  Competence is not required in other states.  Farther up the food chain, you could become an Enrolled Agent, a tax specialist licensed by the Treasury Department to represent taxpayers with the same authority as an attorney or CPA. (That's me.)  To get this designation, you have to pass a difficult examination or work for IRS for at least five years in a professional capacity.  To be a certified public accountant, you will most likely be a college graduate with an accounting major and work under the supervision of a CPA then take a comprehensive exam that covers the gamut of accounting subjects.|`|AA10481903	You will need a college degree in Accounting.

xwPI2e9raa	The way you have describe the fee for a machine tells me one thing, you contacted either a bank or a 3rd party processor. I have been in the industry for 10 years. The fees to accepting credit cards, are not high by any means. What I mean by that is it depends on were you shop. It sounds like the company you contacted was going to charge you a month fee or lease to use the terminal. That is a joke and the biggest sucker bet in the industry. Years ago that was how things were done. Today you should buy the terminal(usually no more than $100-200 or get one for free when you open an account, just like a cell phone. I will explain below the pros and cons to merchant services and PayPal. <br>  <br>  When it comes to credit card processing there are 2 way to go about this. The first is through pay-pal or a like company.These are what we call in the industry 3rd party payment processors. These types of companies are good only if you are a small company, usually from home and if you are doing under a $1000.00 a month. The pros to this can of account is that it is an easy setup and simple to use. The cons are that it is web based, you as the business owner have no real protection against chargebacks(when a customer dispute a charge) pay-pal is always going to be on the customers side and not yours. Also it takes 4-5 days to receive your money. The last item is human nature, most people think if you use paypal your not a real company. <br>  <br>  The 2nd options is opening a merchant account. This is meant for business owners that are doing over $1000 a month. These types of account is for retail locations, over the phone orders and ecommerce. This system is very fast, run a card and within seconds the customer is either approved or decline and then on to the next one. The pros are that you are protected against chargebacks, you receive your money in1-2 days and you have complete control over you account. The cons are it may cost a little more upfront for equipment but most companies can offer inexpensive equipment or possible free.<br>  <br>  Hope that this helped. If you need any more info or can not find a company that is willing to give you a fair price please don't hesitate to email. address is in my profile|`|pd16sn5vaa	Yes and no. They person would have to pay using paypal. Paypal can link credit and debit cards to an account. So, in essence, paypal would be taking the money from a card and giving it to you. You, as an LLC, wouldn't be able to process credit cards.

5e4e7e69ebfb2ce16276f743ee45219eaa	Just as with a rental apartment there's a wide variety of commercial rental situations.  In the space we leased over 5 years ago we basically talked to the landlord about what our business was going to be and set up the lease.  We have an additional location that just opened a month ago and it was a completely different ordeal.  We had to provide business and personal financial statements and jump through all sorts of hoops, that least spent 2-3 months just being jostled back and forth between our lawyer and theirs.  <br>  <br>  Both our locations are in strip malls and are triple-net.  This basically means that in addition to our base monthly rent we also pay our spaces portion of property taxes, insurance, and CAM (common area maintenance).  And of course all of our utilities are our responsibility.  Our newest space was gray-shell when we took possession (basically, gravel floor, no plumbing, no electrical, no drywall shell) and we received an allowance from the landlord that went towards our renovations.  Other spaces that already have walls, electrical, and plumbing would probably come with little to no owner allowance (otherwise known as TI or tenant improvement).  <br>  <br>  I can't speak at all to grants as I have no experience with them.

And there are the gargantuan banks such as Citigroup that are considered too big to fail, but they have essentially failed, too.<br>  <br>  The FDIC likely will become insolvent and its member banks are already planning to pay another premium to re-capitalize it.  That probably won't be enough, so the taxpayers will end up re-capitalizing the FDIC.<br>  <br>  I believe our money will remain safe because the federal government is obligated to stand behind the federal deposit insurance program.  Ultimately, it will be we taxpayers on the hook, but the government cannot allow depositors to lose their money.  Chaos would reign and the entire financial system would collapse if they did.  They won't.|`|kYVSmZy3aa	not much I get to cash in my tax lean's on the bank's.<br>   i get too fire the ceo.  go to more stable banking practice's.|`|rNIFQKF9aa	That's what everyone is wondering there are a few options <br>  they can be taken over by the government and find out what banks are healthy and what banks are not healthy <br>  the other thing is the government bailing them out helping them with their debt or buying their volatile assets (foreclosed homes)<br>  Or the bank could just go under your money is federally insured up to a certain amount but the bank goes bankrupt|`|6f7ff04812eee3a8cc7904414cf99907aa	If so many banks fail that it overwhelms the FDIC.

nyrXBf6kaa	I'm so sorry that you're in this situation, some landlords really don't care, & all they want from you is money & they never expect you to actually complain.<br>  <br>  Honestly what I would do is see if I could get a free consult with a local lawyer who specializes in tenant/landlord cases. You should write down all the questions you can think of, & ask him/her. See if they can tell you exactly which laws are in your favor, & then write them down & write a certified letter (something that they have to sign to receive) to your landlord explaining to him/her that these are the laws & he/she must obey or you will not only break your lease & leave immediately but you will also sue for damages. You should send at least 2 certified letters, because that is proof that you sent & the landlord received complaints from you.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs3.asp?ActID=2605&ChapAct=765%26nbsp%3BILCS%26nbsp%3B742%2F&ChapterID=62&ChapterName=PROPERTY&ActName=Residential+Tenants%27+Right+to+Repair+Act." rel="nofollow">http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilc...</a><br>  <br>  I was reading this page, & it sounds like what you need to read more about yourself. It states: "If the landlord fails to make the repair within 14 days after being notified by the tenant as provided above or more promptly as conditions require in the case of an emergency ... Emergencies include conditions that will cause irreparable harm to the apartment or any fixture attached to the apartment if not immediately repaired or any condition that poses an immediate threat to the health or safety of any occupant of the dwelling or any common area."<br>  <br>  It then states: "After submitting to the landlord a paid bill from an appropriate tradesman or supplier unrelated to the tenant, the tenant may deduct from his or her rent the amount of the bill, not to exceed the limits specified by this Section and not to exceed the reasonable price then customarily charged for the repair."<br>  <br>  You should really consult a lawyer for more accurate answers, & that will also be proof to the courts (if it has to go to court), that you didn't know what to do & consulted legal help.<br>  <br>  Also that page I gave a link to above you should read it completely, because there are exceptions & other things you should look into.<br>  <br>  Sorry I wrote so much, good luck & take care... Here are some links that also might be helpful to you.<br>  <br>  PS- sometimes just telling your landlord that you consulted with a lawyer might make them "wake up" & do their job. good luck!|`|PDHCOrOSaa	YES!  You absolutely have the right.  Infact...just tell him your moving.  If he has the nerve to bring you to court then bring everything you said you had as evidence and he might end up paying YOU something.|`|WTf0caplaa	I suggest you re-read the lease to determine the exact wording of your terms of agreement.<br>  <br>  Having said that, the typical lease agreement states that the landlord must maintain a certain standard of living for the tenants. So even though he's making an effort, you are suffering for an undue amount of time.|`|VWILDaYPaa	you can file a lawsuit. putting tape on a hole isnt fixing it and thats basiccly what hes doing.|`|4E2BoVptaa	Your situation sounds similar to one that I was in at one point. You can call and complain to the health department. They will come an inspect the house. This usually includes mold test, wall stability test, etc. If it has been leaking that much, there will be damage to be seen. They will also ask you for records of complaint to your landlord and any photos. They have the right to deem the apartment unfit until repair. This will legally break your lease.<br>  <br>  I had to do this when pipes kept breaking in the floor of the house that my husband and I were renting. The landlord would come put pipe tape on them and two days later my kitchen would have water spots on the floor again. I called the health department. It didn't cost me anything. They came out within a week and a half. I would out of my lease by the end of the month.<br>  <br>  It's worth a call. They investigate unfit living conditions. Possibly mold in your walls is a danger to your health. Water coming from the room can damage property. It's worth a call. You deserve better.<br>  <br>  You could call a lawyer and that would work too. But, that can be expensive and get heated. I would try to report them to the health dept. first.|`|XxUsLqXRaa	As the summer heats up, all that moisture is just going to turn into mold and mildew.  Regardless of whether or not he fixes the roof, I'd be planning a move in the near future if I were you.  He has made attempts to fix the problem, but whether or not those were honest attempts or just temporary band aids to pacify you for a while longer is up to you to decide.  It never hurts to ask the guy if he'll let you out of the lease.  It may be worth his while to get you out of there so he isn't quite as pressured to fix the leaks.|`|xZigibGYaa	first, i think you should ask him straight out, considering the circumstances.  you should also read the tenant/landlord rights online for your state.<br>  <br>  good luck.  no good tenant should have to go through that.

Ns6I7MmBaa	Note that there is typically a balance transfer free of 3-4%.  And if you do not have a teaser balance transfer interest rate for the card you are transferring to, it is considered a cash advance at usually higher interest rate than purchases.<br>  <br>  Usually you cannot transfer balances between credit cards from the same bank.<br>  <br>  Banks are cutting credit limits and increasing interest rates for people who habitually only make minimum payments, so make an effort to pay it down faster than that.  You may not find the same balance transfer offer next time around.

AA10154955	The skinny of a short sale.<br>  <br>  A short sale is any home that is LISTED for less than the owner owns on the home. (It has nothing to do with being approved by the lender, as that would then be a lender approved short sale)<br>  <br>  Example. Current owner bought a home for $200,000 in Arizona. They put down 10% and took out a loan (mortgage) for the remaining $180,000<br>  <br>   The market goes down and they list the house for $150,000 ($30k less than they owe). This is a short sale. <br>  <br>  The bank that holds the mortgage must APPROVE the deal, as they will lose the $30k. Others are correct that it can take some more time than normal, but find a good Realtor to help you as many short sales are approved by the bank meaning they are ready to close.|`|9b9f75545eba3c982f4a21bb3a585952aa	The problem with short sales is that the sale is contingent on the bank's approval, NOT the sellers.  It is extremely common for a bank to take 2-3 months in order to decide if they will accept your offer or not.  When looking at a short sale home, ask if the listing price is the bank's price or the "wish price" from the seller.  The answer can save you tons of trouble!|`|91XVWCWWaa	A short sale means that the lender is allowing the seller to sell the property for less than the amount of the original loan. What your talking about may not be necessarily a short sale property just because the asking price is low.  For the buyer, short sales have some restrictions that other properties don't but all around they are not bad.|`|AA10567651	depends on who your buying the house from check the company out and there history.<br>  2nd how important is it for you to move. will your income increase drastically because of this move? how is the house condition? these and questions like these are ones you should be asking....<br>  <br>  3rd Good luck.

HXroj7lNaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  Sorry, but your question is some what confusing. What I can make out of it, is that, you have high risk appetite and you are looking for a long term investment option, possibly to act as your retirement plan.<br>  <br>  So, if you want to invest some amount with long term perspective, don’t invest that entire amount in one go. Start investing in small proportion of that amount regularly and at frequent intervals, just like your SIP investments. <br>  <br>  1) If you have the appetite for risk, then it makes sense to start investing in "A" group large cap equities, now. Buy your chosen equity on dips. <br>  <br>  2) Consider investing in Equity Diversified Mutual Funds. Prefer mutual fund that invests in large cap stocks.<br>  <br>  Regards<br>  <br>  Manish<br>  <a href="http://personalmoney.in" rel="nofollow">http://personalmoney.in</a>

r0clhYvmaa	If you are almost positive you would not take the job, and you have an ideal plan, then you must mean you are afraid of burning bridges by not going to the interview or having them think you are not interested in working there. There is nothing wrong with cancelling an interview. It would be professional to ring in the morning and officially lodge your withdrawal.  That is considered an acceptable thing to do as peoples plans change, (rather than just not turn up), and would therefore not burn any bridges. You could apply for new jobs there anytime in the future without guilt. They won't remember you cancelled before and it won't matter anyway.|`|qAFLEZpnaa	If you don't want to go you don't have to go.<br>  It's all about you.<br>  Employers and others don't give a phuck about you.
tJxM0FJRaa	Been there - done that!  :-)<br>  <br>  Where you are located does impact this answer so I will be general.  First, if you go into foreclosure I assume that means that there is no equity left in your house correct?  If that is the case, you then need to read your loan documents (not fun but necessary).  For the first lender, you need to see if they will foreclose with the second there or can you possibly give them the property?  <br>  <br>  For the second lender - you need to see what your guarantee says?  That will give you some information.  Also, ask them to show you your signed deed of trust and promissory note, they've been having issues with that lately.  If you have a lot of available assets, it is likely that the second will try to get something from you.  If you don't (and with the current climate) you might be ok.  But never agree to anything until it's in writing and sign NOTHING without having an attorney say you are ok.  It's worth spending that money!<br>  <br>  WAMU is EXTREMELY difficult to deal with.  The right hand doesn't know what the left one is doing.  And they take forever to do anything and lose documentation all the time.  I sent the same things in 4 times before they acknowledged they had received them.  If you haven't called them look on the back of your statement and give them a call.  At least see what they have to say on your situation.<br>  <br>  This was very general - but I hope that it helped.|`|JI7NQ9TNaa	You need specific information here---and since you might be in another state, that's hard to answer.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|wOBZEFXFaa	They can come after you for the deficency once the home is sold. Unless you personally guaranteed the loan (through recourse) the bank's lein is on the collateral (the home) not you personally. They might make some noise, but in the end bankruptcy would get rid of them if it came down to it.
d39f3dbe21f2274aab83dceb86482ed2aa	I agree with Trouble.  For any future tenants, you should put a no smoking clause in the lease, and also a no pets clause if you are worried about pet odors.  As part of this clause, I would specify that the tenant must pay $1,000 (or whatever an appropriate amount is) for professional cleanup costs if they violate it.  Although the smokers might lie, you may be able to catch them when you meet with them from their tobacco stench.  Most smokers are drug addicts who can't control themselves, so they or their clothing will probably smell from tobacco.  If you're not sure, ask them to let you smell their coat or ask them to empty their pockets, handbags, etc.  If they are non-smokers they shouldn't object and will appreciate the thorough job you are doing to not rent to lowlifes.  If they are able to get away with lying, perhaps you'll have a better case for eviction and/or damages, since they'll be breaking the lease.|`|jTHJhy2laa	You can deduct from the security deposit,unless you already returned it to her.You will need to replace the curtains and repaint the walls,since washing didn't do anything.If there is carpeting you will have to replace it as well.I had the same problem after I quit smoking.I could still smell the smoke and it made me crave cigarettes.Once I cleaned and painted and replaced the curtains and rugs it stopped.It cost me a years worth of cigarette money to fix the problem.|`|vCePK8gMaa	Smoke odor is damage. You can charge whatever it costs to get rid of the odor. A judge would be hard pressed to award you lost rent.<br>  <br>  A tenant is not required to disclose that they are a smoker unless asked. Even then, they'll lie to get in the rental.|`|1YdeUn1Caa	That's what a deposit is for. Cleaning, first and last months rent. You should have got that money already. If you didn't, that's bad business on your part.|`|91XVWCWWaa	In California you have the right to keep the deposit for replacement of any damages.  You will have to replace the carpet, and paint over the walls because this is where the odors have been trapped.  A good airing out and vanilla drops in the new paint should be enough.  The curtains will have to also be replaced and quite possibly the floor.  With that extensive damage you can take her to small claims but don't be surprised if you get the judgment and not the money as this is usually what happens.  It can go against the tenants credit as well.........|`|0qfT1eNfaa	Well depending on where you live, If you did not put in the lease Non smokers, I don;'t think you can do anything about it other then holding back the deposit they put up for cleaning. But you could check with an attorney and find out what your rights are.|`|SZvJVM2yaa	if you have had that in a contract with the tenants stating they cant smoke in the house and they did then yes you can if not you cant yet tenants do not have to disclose that they are smokers|`|sxtWUg5saa	The one thing that you could possibly sue her for is if she did it or let it happen after you told her that she couldn't do that.|`|9c7d64a28e8acf14270f5aa9f8e3e1e0aa	No, you cannot.<br>  <br>  That is called normal wear and tear.  I have personally, never experienced this problem as a landlord.  You also cannot legally ban your tenants from smoking in the units.  She is not required to disclose she is a smoker either.<br>  <br>  You also cannot charge someone that uses curry in cooking, to remove the odor from the house.  Smoking cigarettes is no different.<br>  <br>  My suggestion is that the ventilation is probably not sufficient in the unit to "change out" the air.<br>  <br>  All you can do is paint and replace the carpet and pad...if it's hardwoods, vinyl or tile, then you are using the wrong cleaner.<br>  <br>  Those that are telling you that you can keep the security deposit, don't understand the legalities.  Cigarette smoke is not considered damage.|`|77700ae60cac2abd41d7a7f8bd98336aaa	Unless there was a "No Smoking" clause in her lease there is nothing you can do. If there was and she smoked you can hold her responsible for any damages caused from the smoking.It may take repainting. I doubt you can sue for months it's vacant because of it, you need to do what it takes to get rid of the smell. Rent or buy an air purifier
Azh7udWmaa	I'd say the one on your checks, but you should probably check with your bank.  All the employers I know that do direct deposit ask simply for a voided check, I've never heard one ask for a deposit slip.|`|PxoKseAiaa	Use the ones on your checks.|`|Ns6I7MmBaa	Deposit slips have an internal routing number.  I found that out when I tried to use a deposit slip to set up split direct deposit to 2 accounts for my paycheck.  You have to use the external routing number on checks for anything outside the bank.
CqLDEvduaa	You should definitely mention it, anything that could make you stand out from the crowd is a big plus when it comes to getting a job.<br>  Lots of people may build their own PCs but lots do not, it's just one more thing you're capable of doing and can impress your potential employer with. I can't see how any harm could come from mentioning it.|`|UnlqJgXIaa	You can slip it in--It shows that you understand the hardware end of it as well|`|vWFz82heaa	Use that experience if it ties into the tech job. If it is a help desk that requires hardware/software troubleshooting. Then knowing how a PC works would definitely be a job skill to play up.<br>  If it is not on your resume, make sure you can slip it into why you are a good fit for the job because that skill will come in use. <br>  Sometime, it will be an interest or hobby of your interviewer, which will help break the ice, and they will remember you better. <br>  <br>  Like if you built your own gaming machine, and the tech job is at a gaming company. That will be brownie points for you.|`|X3YtZ9Fsaa	it depends, if you just put all the componets into the tower it isnt too wonderfull, but if you wired the motherboard and fabricated all the cards then say it

dc388b2eb23692bc6ba6dd6d72b063d5aa	Nope, this 8k will have nothing to do with the mortgage or interest. This 8k credit will from your regular old FEDERAL INCOME TAX that you have to pay on your income every year. <br>  <br>  So if you make enough money in 2009 to owe more than 8k in federal taxes, then you are gaining the full benefit of this tax credit. I figure that you probably need to earn 75k or more to get that. If you make less than that, you still get a tax credit but not the maximum 8k.|`|AA10154955	How is the amount of the tax credit determined?<br>  The tax credit is equal to 10 percent of the home’s purchase price up to a maximum of $8,000.<br>  <br>  Are there any income limits for claiming the tax credit?<br>  The tax credit amount is reduced for buyers with a modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) of more than $75,000 for single taxpayers and $150,000 for married taxpayers filing a joint return. The tax credit amount is reduced to zero for taxpayers with MAGI of more than $95,000 (single) or $170,000 (married) and is reduced proportionally for taxpayers with MAGIs between these amounts.<br>  <br>  I read that the tax credit is "refundable." What does that mean?<br>  The fact that the credit is refundable means that the home buyer credit can be claimed even if the taxpayer has little or no federal income tax liability to offset. Typically this involves the government sending the taxpayer a check for a portion or even all of the amount of the refundable tax credit.<br>  <br>  For example, if a qualified home buyer expected, notwithstanding the tax credit, federal income tax liability of $5,000 and had tax withholding of $4,000 for the year, then without the tax credit the taxpayer would owe the IRS $1,000 on April 15th. Suppose now that the taxpayer qualified for the $8,000 home buyer tax credit. As a result, the taxpayer would receive a check for $7,000 ($8,000 minus the $1,000 owed).|`|7lPrSH3Taa	My realitor told my husband and I that if you buy a house before December 1, 2009 you will get back up to $8,000.

Usually customers consider putting money in insurance as wastage and one of reason is that there is no instant gratification of usage.<br>  <br>  In-fact on the contrary we buy insurance when we do not need it immediately. Like buying a fire and earthquake damage insurance just when you are stepping inside your crisp new home or a pension plan at the age of 30 when you are young or then buying a death or disability cover when we are hale & hearty. So what is insurance all about?<br>  <br>  Insurance is the only security against all the uncertainities in life and replaces the material loss (not emotional) but helps restore the emotion attached with the loss). <br>  <br>  Let's look at investment of Rs.2500/- per annum a little differently. Your dream bikes are covered against any damage everyday for just Rs.6.85/-. Is that too much for your passion of bikes where you have put in Rs.86,000/- ?<br>  <br>  Go zooom around carefree because you have secured your beauties.<br>  Also, do you have enough life insurance for your own self? Roads can be dangerous !
DorePwVOaa	When you fill out the FAFSA, they will definitely ask how much money you have in the back at the time you fill out the form. It should not affect your aid if you have less than $3,000 in the bank. If you manage to save up more than $3,000 when that time comes, you might consider starting a retirement account to put some of the money into. Retirement accounts (such as IRAs) are not asked about on the FAFSA, and are a great way to save for the future. With a Roth IRA, you can even take your contributions (but not your earnings) out at any time after five years of opening the Roth. <br>  <br>  If you have more than $3,000 in the bank, they will expect you to put 35% of it toward school.|`|2PDBxlYDaa	You can put your savings on FAFSA but remember savings are for emergencies so you can't be expected to use savings for college.

If you was to stop now and get back in when things pick back up you will miss out on the best buys in a very long time.<br>    In a 401k your buying a group of stocks instead of just one so there is far less chance of losing all of your money "unless you was to sell at the bottom of a bear market". This might not be the very bottom but it sure isn't the top either. I'm in a 401k at my work but we are only working one day a week and I can't put the money into it that I would like to. I have been rebalancing by selling shares that are doing better and buying shares that are hit very hard. When the economy recovers the shares that I loaded up on at cheap prices will make my money jump in value. Many of America's extremely wealthy families became that way during the great depression. They had money to buy those dirt cheap stocks and when the recovery came they made out.<br>    Just remember when everyone else wants to sell you buy and when everyone wants to buy you sell. I don't have any government bonds but I wish that I did, they are way up in the last 2 years. When the economy recovers and my stocks value goes up the government bonds will fall in value, then I will start to sell shares here and there and buy some, but not before. Buy low and sell high. At your age I don't think that you have too much to worry about. I can't tell you what to move because I don't know what you have but you should be looking for rebalancing opportunity's. Good luck|`|Ch9TedMcaa	80% equities<br>  <br>  20% bonds|`|AA11562326	Good for you, planning for the future!<br>  <br>  Unless you quit your job, I don't think you can move your 401k money somewhere else, although maybe your company offers several options for where to put it.  If so, I'd put it into some stock fund based on the worldwide market, as you never know what country will be in the lead when you retire.  You have at least 30 years to retirement, probably, so when you get other investing ideas along the way, you can make other decisions.  If you were closer to retirement, I'd say put it into something much more conservative.|`|6f7ff04812eee3a8cc7904414cf99907aa	Gold coins

A four year degree is almost mandatory for any white collar job, so look farther down the road to see where you want to be 10 years later. If you want to run your own business, then you should get a business degree / entrepreneurship program. If not 4 then a 2 year AA.<br>  Get yourself into a apprenticeship program out of High School if you can, and go to a JC for a AA at the same time, or get into an AA skilled trade program at the JC.

2jNQhT7laa	I actually don't know the answer, but I just wanted to comment that the above answers don't make sense. Technically, lots of things, including reproduced photographs and artwork, could be considered "replicas," and people sell (and buy) them all the time because they're cheaper than buying original artwork. People can't afford to buy originals of everything.<br>  <br>  I don't understand why eBay would remove it if you specify it's a replica and simply charge less for it. It's not like you're trying to bilk somebody. Some people would probably buy replicas for cheap simply as commemorative items or what have you.|`|AA10305589	The word"replica" is an attempt to put a pretty face on the ugly truth that such items are counterfeits.

d3WiJVk6aa	Usually if you're trying to buy property, the banks would expect you to be able to prove you can pay the loan before they will give you the money.  If you're self employed that may be more of a challenge because you would not necessarily have a steady regular paycheck.  <br>  <br>  If you are self employed, be prepared to show not only how much money you have, how well you pay your bills, and how much money you already owe, but also a long and complete history of reliable income.  <br>  <br>  Remember also that investment involves risks, and any company willing to take that risk with you is going to expect you to be responsible for the money you owe even if the investment doesn't pay off as well or as quickly as you originally hoped.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure what "privileges" full-time employees get that a self-employed person would not have access to in terms of buying property, other than possibly an easier time proving their income.|`|R81SYPkuaa	Yes you should be ale to get a loan in theory but you will have to provide proof of earnings over a period of time and demonstrate your ability to repay the loan, there are possibilities but in the present climate you may experience difficulties and any loans mortgages will be loaded with high interest rates or you may have to pay a fee or buy a policy through a broker. good luck|`|mdzIjOqaaa	This question makes no sense. A bank does not judge you by how many hours per week you work. If you are self employed and have an income of 100k per year then you will be able to get a loan just the same as someone who works for someone else and makes 100k per year. And if you are self employed why aren't you working full time do you have something against money. Also owning investment property is not a privilege"full timers" get. I have never been offered an apartment building along with my 4 weeks vacation.|`|YxiqI903aa	Short answer: No.<br>  <br>  Self employed means that you work at your own pace.

They are selling you something in exchange for at least 4 years of your life. I personally recommend that you finish your degree which is not that far off.

You maybe shipped off straight from boot camp to Iraq or Afghanistan, there are no promises made to you when you join - it's in the fine print.<br>  Get good grades, get a PT job, Financial Aide to help you live off campus. With the degree, see if you can qualify for officer training or go directly to test for the Academy or FBI. BTW, knowing a foreign language is a big bonus like Spanish, Russian, Farsi as well as having  financial intelligence training.<br>  Go talk with some soldiers on leave, scout out some Academies, talk with some agents or law enforcement program coordinators. Get yourself a bigger picture so you can make an informed decision that will impact these critical years for development, both personal and professional. Good luck with your career.

The Seller Realtor will generally split this with the Realtor that brings the buyer.

So if the house sells for $300,000, the real estate agent will get $18,000 of that from the seller.  You will still pay $300,000.<br>  <br>  You should be aware that the real estate agent is working for the seller and not for you, since the seller is the one paying the commission.  Their interest is to sell the house for as much money as possible in order to maximize their commission, so from a financial point of view, they are only trying to help the seller, not you as the buyer.  Even so, they might be very willing to try to get the seller to reduce the price, because 6% of a smaller amount is a lot better than 6% of nothing if the house doesn't sell, not to mention the time they are spending trying to sell the house.

5586ad15a09ab2f36457c1e8042071f2aa	One word: LAWYER. You are in deep here and you could be in for some jail time and a fine for fraud (that tax break you took which was not yours to take, only half was) in addition to going into foreclosure because of the defaulted loan. The problem is what you SIGNED to get the loan, you CO-SIGNED even though your friend paid everything. Since you signed, you obligated yourself to repay the loan alongside your friend. HE did not default, YOU BOTH defaulted equally. Sorry, but there is no getting out of the obligation YOU signed on for. I think you did not understand WHAT you were signing, which is no fault of anyone other than yourself. You should have had a lawyer read the contract and explain your obligations in layman terms. No use crying over spilled milk. You get to live with the consequences of your mistake in trusting your friend, who ended up putting YOU, as a cosigner, on the hook for the loan he failed to repay. YOU, are part of the reason we are in the financial bind we are in these days, you did not understand what you were getting yourself in for, and now the bottom has fallen out and you are going to end up in foreclosure because you screwed up. That screw up is going to hurt your credit for a long time and there is no "getting out" of your obligations. There is no do-over, no way to UNDO what is happening to you. You may have bankruptcy in your immediate future. Like I said, one word: lawyer. Look on the bright side, you MAY be eligible for some of the bailout money solid citizens like ME can NOT get even though we are hanging on by a thread financially... The only way to get bailout money is to be in serious financial trouble. You screwed up, so you get my tax dollars to bail you out and I get zip, nada, nothing, only because I am NOT in financial trouble, though just barely breaking even in my case.

Third, you will have to jump through hoops to just get started on the damage that was done to your credit. Do you realize this affects your credit for years to come? This is something that can't be easily undone and you have now ended up paying for what he has done and because his name isn't on anything (please go back and check on the contract, deed, promissory note, deed, etc)he is getting away scot free.....

vWFz82heaa	I think you are asking about having a company be more transparent about its financial records. The fault lies in letting companies select their own auditors as in the case of Enron, there should be a blind system where company's are audited on a rotating basis from various firms. This way, any complicity in faking the financials are harder with another set of eyes looking at the books. Then the government should themselves do spot checking of the auditors work on a random basis, as well as pulling in statistic from export/import records, and cross check earnings from records of foreign sources.|`|pVpN9Kbuaa	Its all about corruption.

I think every thing should well planned from the day if permission is given to establish a company there should be some instructions which can do favour to investors when company get collapse even if we think about Ramalinga Raju we can't blame him alone because why this Income Tax officials are appointed for. if common man approaches bank for aloan they will 101 questions and blindly going on releasing funds to companies like this.

AA11355554	Hmm.  First, the problems.  It will be incredibly difficult, if not impossible to get someone to invest in you if a)you don't have personal experience in the industry / business you want to start, b)you aren't significantly personally financially invested (at least 25% of the startup costs), and c)don't have some business experience in a fiscal management role (sorry if I'm mistaken here, I'm saying that based on your "direction" comment).  The saying that most small businesses fail in the first year is no joke...<br>  <br>  Finding someone in India to invest will be especially hard, assuming you don't live there and have some contacts, someone who might know someone kind of thing.  I'm ignoring the obvious question of why you need to find someone in India, I'm sure you have a reason.  My advice will apply anywhere.  Starting from zero, your best bet will be to do a web search, looking for "angel" investors that operate in the investment range you need.  Also look for investment banks to talk to (who will not be interested in giving you money) that will know investors that might talk to you.  An SBA loan in the states isn't what it seems; the government isn't interested in helping people start businesses, you have to qualify just like for any loan, and banks don't want to give money to people who need it.  Quite the reverse, and especially these days when credit is frog's butt tight.<br>  <br>  In your initial contact with potential investors, you will of course have to disclose enough information about your proposal to pique their interest.  You're correct to be somewhat concerned about giving away too much, but honestly, the chance that someone with money to invest will be interested in stealing your idea is slim.  The advantage to holding things a bit close to the vest is that it helps to assure them of your professionalism.  When the time comes to "drop your pants", and give them the whole story, be ready to give them a "Confidentiality Disclosure Agreement" or CDA.  You can download one off the internet, just make sure that it appears to protect you.  I say "appears" because it's only as good as your legal fund to defend your position.  But it will give some people pause, and again, a professional will expect it.<br>  <br>  Before you talk to any investor, get your story straight.  Have a cohesive story in pocket to tell them that takes no more than two minutes at first blush.  If you can't hook them enough to start asking you questions in that time, you're done.  They have better things to do. (Know the answer to any potential question, one "I don't know" can kill a deal.)   In particular, they will want to know immediately how much you need, how much you personally are putting up, an overview of the opportunity (and you must express it as an opportunity), what equity in the business you are giving them for their investment, and a no BS projection of how long it will take to get their money back.  Most investors want a 10X return in three years.  Or less.  And a revenue stream after that.<br>  <br>  I'm trying to be honest about your chances, and at first blush, I would say they are slim.  Many small businesses are started with "friends and family" money, which I think is probably your best bet.  You still should be prepared with everything I suggested for your pitch to them.  Treat them on a professional level, everyone works hard for their money.  Also, be prepared for the possibility that you will lose their money, love, and trust.  Many relationships have ended over less than losing someone's money.<br>  <br>  Best of luck, being your own boss has great rewards, but it's hard work, and not the slightest glamorous.|`|hvp9tTjZaa	Get a lawyer to lock the idea down before you do a damn thing.

LEARN YOUR LENDER POLICIES<br>  <br>  Become knowledgeable and familiar with your lender’s loan modification policies. For rate modifications, know if the lender will accept an application before the rate becomes adjustable or increases. Some lenders require a borrower to be delinquent for at least three months before they even accept an application for loan modification. Lenders often have different policies for borrowers who can no longer pay due to job loss or health issues.<br>  <br>  2. GET YOUR LENDERS LOAN MODIFICATION PACKAGE BEFORE YOU START NEGOTIATING<br>  <br>  Before calling and giving all your information, ask for a written loan modification package from your lender. If they are willing to send you an application, you will see what information they need and what their policies are. You will then have time to reflect on your answers and not be pressured into answering over the telephone. Additionally, when lenders have their own unique forms, any applications which are not submitted on those forms will fall to the bottom of the pile and face delay in processing.<br>  <br>  3. KEEP YOUR COOL<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that you are dealing with a department staffed with people who are swamped with calls from irate borrowers, each with the same sad story. These employees become callous to the plights of the borrowers. Furthermore, their employer, the lender, changes the policies and procedures almost daily. In addition, the employees are worried that they will lose their jobs when the lender makes additional job cuts. They may be calling their own mortgage company’s loan modification department next week. You are stressed, and so is the person on the other end of the telephone.<br>  <br>  4. DOCUMENT EVERY COMMUNICATION MADE<br>  <br>  Keep a log of every telephone call or letter made, and every telephone call or letter received. Include emails and faxes in your log. Make certain that your log contains dates, times, names, and titles. This information may be necessary to document what has been promised by the lender.<br>  <br>  5. CREATE AN ACCURATE AND DETAILED EXPENSE REPORT<br>  <br>  Lenders base their decisions on your monthly budget which includes your income and expenses. They are not interested in your hardship story, only in learning whether the hardship is over. They are interested in knowing exactly how you are going to make your monthly payments. They want to see a sensible, realistic, and reasonable monthly budget. For example:<br>  <br>  a. If you are applying for a rate modification, your lender will want to see that you have a negative residual income. This shows that you cannot afford a rate increase. You will also need to that you have discharged all possible expenses that are considered “excess” or “luxury living.” You must provide evidence that you have done all you can to lower your monthly expenses. They do not want to see expenses for multiple cell phones, premium cable television, designer clothes, or extravagant dining and entertainment expenses. They want to see that your car payment matches a frugal lifestyle, meaning you do not drive a new Hummer.<br>  <br>  b. A string applicant will have a monthly budget with a residual income about 25% greater than the monthly mortgage payment. This means that if your mortgage payment is $2,000 per month, you have an income of $2,500. These numbers must be verified by your bank statement or other documentation.<br>  <br>  c. If you lose your source of income due to unemployment or medical reasons, the lender will want to know whether such loss is permanent or temporary. If temporary, the lender will need to be assured that your income will return in the near future. A permanent loss of income will result in denial of your loan modification.<br>  <br>  6. HAVE A GOOD FAITH DEPOSIT<br>  <br>  I saved this point for last, because most borrowers do not understand its importance, and I want to make sure that it gets attention. Imagine being the lender and a borrower who has missed several months of payments calls you. That borrower tells you that he has not been able to make any payments because the adjustable rate kicked in and the payment was too high. This borrower filled out all the application forms and has begged for a loan modification. The borrower has explained that he can pay a certain amount, but not the whole amount. You immediately think to yourself, “Well then, why has this borrower not made any payment at all?” More to the point, you wonder what this borrower has done with the money he would have used to make the mortgage payments had the rate not increased. Can you see the problem here? This borrower better have the mortgage payments in his savings account and be ready to tender that amount to the lender as a good faith deposit. Failure to do so will likely result in a denial of the loan modification.<br>  <br>  In summary, lenders will modify loans only if the borrower can convince them that it is in the lender’s best financial inter|`|5xo44b90aa	It is harder to prove income, if you are self employed, than if you were working for someone.

Bw1h5xAcaa	How would your employer find out if you had one unless you voluntarily told them? <br>  <br>  If the employer drug tests you and you fail you won't get the job. . . and having the card will not exempt you from that.|`|UwEEHuRcaa	Depends what the job is.|`|ReaxXaBiaa	No, not in the least. First off, it's illegal to fire someone for taking medication as long as its not impairing your job performance (and sometimes even if it is). <br>  <br>  Second, they're never going to know unless you tell them or your medical ID card slips out. Getting a card does not go on your 'record', even if you get one registered by the county health department. It would be an invasion of privacy and against state law (CA at least) for your employee to fire you because of a MMJ card.|`|wvDh3PdFaa	in the philippines we dont have such card . we are prohibited to use it . so if your seeking a job inthe philippines  for sure the company  will not going to hire  you.|`|OF7ZHq19aa	not if you have the proof that you kneed it

AA11639059	Well, it isn't a Ponzi scheme, Social Security is. <br>  <br>  The market is an aggregate. People make decisions about their money, the company they work for, the companies they want to own a piece of because of the business they do, or think they do, or think they are going to do. Millions and millions of independant decisions are being made, sometimes arriving at the same conclusions at the same time as a lot of other people. They use all kinds of information and search for what they need according to their reasons.<br>  <br>  A course in chemistry came to mind, it was mostly mathematics that we were dealing with in measurements and such, and when I missed some questions I was positive I had right I saw my professor. He would look at my multiple choice answer for a given question and tell me what mistake I made in the process. His understanding of common mistakes supplied him with likely answers to populate the question distractors. In the stock market, and a lot of other things, those of us who have some notions, real or imaginary, of what should be can commonly see where "the herd" made mistakes. Sometimes we are right, but sometimes the people in the crowd are doing exactly what they feel is best for them at the moment.<br>  <br>  If you disagree with them, then don't do what they are doing. Pretty simple to me.|`|I1VivZxfaa	I don't understand how your rant relates to your question.

L4rlu2BDaa	You can spend what ever you have on the card, if you have ￡7.99 then your free to spend every penny of the ￡7.99 where ever and how ever you like. Be careful though some shops, usually small off licences and Corner shops have a limit to the amount you need to spend before using a card. Most of the time its ￡5. Supermarkets and large retails stores don't usually imply these kinds of limits. Tesco for example you can use your card to buy a pack of gum if you so wished!|`|KuWLNfYbaa	A loaf of bread and a chunk of cheese,but go steady if it has to last till Friday and hide it from the mice|`|PxoKseAiaa	Nope<br>  Unless you do not exceed that 10 that is left on your card.

Speak to an officer, not a teller.<br>  Or is that supposition?<br>  <br>  Not much you can do until the error is corrected.<br>  <br>  This is one of the hazards using a debit card..  It takes more time to make adjustments than a credit card.<br>  <br>  I use a debit also, but never for "online" purchases.  Only credit card.|`|PxoKseAiaa	Next time you are at the pump, look at it, there will be right there in black and white that they will put a HOLD on funds that may be above the purchase.  Most gas stations will only put a hold of $50 on your card.  The charge should be put back on your card for you to use by Thursday.  Tough lesson to learn, but this is how gas stations make sure you have enough in your account to pump a tank of gas.|`|GtBKqfgMaa	If it was a pending charge then you still should be ok to pay for other things and not go overdraft.|`|a6779150ee307fd979ff5c54c79e3cabaa	Its usually just a dollar. Are you sure it was 99 dollars|`|Pur8Ghc8aa	Having worked at a gas station at a grocery store, it seems like it's dependent on what type and what bank of card you're using.<br>  <br>  I use a debit card from Wells Fargo.  When used as a debit, it doesn't do any kind of preauthorization.  As a credit, it would just do $1.<br>  <br>  A friend had a reloadable/prepaid credit card, and her's charged I believe $75 (our max gas amount).  <br>  <br>  It would be nice if stations had a sign or something letting customers know what's going on.  To prevent this, use it as a debit, pay cash, or pay inside.|`|niGAKJT4aa	sorry, but they do that now.  it used to be that you only had to have .01 in your bank account and you could fill up and stiff the gas stations, but they changed the rules when gas got so expensive.  the only thing you can do is use cash.|`|fwrfIxIaaa	they should have given u warning about the authorization charge... i havent even heard of such a thing.. i suggest cash from now on|`|N1qKXDs2aa	i've never heard of that before. i use my debit card to buy gas as well but when they ask for debit/credit at the pump i always select credit.<br>  maybe it had something to do with that....
AA11976220	Most systems will work only for short periods of time. Over long periods you will lose money.In trading it only take a  cold short streak to leave you in ruin.This system is doomed to fail in a poor market.|`|AA11639059	I was just looking at that earlier this week.<br>  <br>  No, I haven't used it.

If you can figure out what the whizkid now adult is doing then maybe you will do okay when he is off sick or has grown bored with what he is doing. <br>  <br>  Getting it right before three or four hundred paying participants is an ego rush, but pretty soon every job becomes work and excellent work becomes mediocre. But, if you buy in, enjoy while you can.

AA11550366	Under Veda guidelines there are 2 different defaults you may be listed with - "Payment Default: The account must be 60 days or more overdue and the debtor/debtors must have been sent a written notice advising of the overdue payment, and requesting payment of the amount outstanding.<br>  Scheme of Arrangement: Where you have entered into a formal, written scheme of arrangement with the customer and the arrangement has commenced."<br>  Some companies will work with you as long as they can see light at the end of the tunnel others will black mark you as soon as possible. Best to write to the company to see what option is best for you and them...and keep all copies of your correspondence!
oU9rI4woaa	AD&D coverage is normally sold alongside a group life policy.  If the person dies in an accident or is in a serious, dismembering accident, the policy pays a benefit.  When it is inforce with a group life policy, it becomes a 'double indemnity' policy, because it pays two benefits, the life insurance and the AD&D.<br>  <br>  All you need to quote is employee, DOB, sex, and amount of coverage requested (flat amount or multiple of salary).|`|OCVFrgeXaa	No idea.

Unless of course the companies getting these so-called "bail-outs" can commit to creating jobs for those people who no longer have jobs due to the dip in our economy.

yDP9xHNnaa	Yes, you could be self employed as a nanny.  It does not matter if you have one client or fifty.  You will be responsible for all your taxes, insurance and other items beyond what you mentioned.  You may want to consider setting up an LLC (Limited Liability Company) just in case some one sues you there would be some protection against them taking all of your personal assets.|`|v20ATgHZaa	THis could qualify as self employment I believe especially if you are contracting with several families.  Typically if you worked full time for one family only you would be more likely to be their empoyee.
PxoKseAiaa	I think you are leaving out some info that may be pertinent to your question.  Is this a short sale, a foreclosure or a house you are buying from the seller in the normal way?<br>  <br>  A housing inspection takes from 2 to 4 hours and above.  It depends on how big the house is and how long it takes the guy to look over everything.  <br>  <br>  When you make an offer on a house, you usually specify a closing date or an escrow term.  Most are about 30 days.  Most people after their offer is accepted get an inspection within 7 days.  If all goes well with the inspection and the funding on your loan, you should be able to move into your new place within 30 days of your offer.  <br>  <br>  No, you cannot move in before you close escrow and sign all your loan documents.  You get your keys at the closing table typically after you sign a mountain of paper!
aBRDy1q4aa	It has been 6 weeks since I efiled and I recieved my cp05 letter ON Wednesday.  If I were you, I would not do anything until they ask.    You could cause yourself even further delays if your return is still in review when they recieve your amendment.  I dont even know why my return is in review, I filed the same as I have for years and years.
ujAzSfCzaa	You should probably take it, there are no strings attached.  However go into the local Wells Fargo real estate department and talk face-to-face with a loan officer.
hCqoJ4nTaa	An easy way to file your Tax Return online is this website <a href="http://www.filelate.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.filelate.com</a>  It is actually less expensive than other online tax companies and if you complete more than one tax return they will give you coupon code for a discount. I have used this online services before its pretty easy <br>  <br>  If you'd rather fill out the forms by hand, you can download the 2006 tax forms from the IRS website: <a href="http://www.irs.gov/formspubs/article/0,,..." rel="nofollow">http://www.irs.gov/formspubs/article/0,,...</a><br>  <br>  Good Luck :-)|`|rBAk0BRiaa	Turbotax online has free filing. If your tax situation is fairly straight forward you should definitely try online tax filing.  In fact if your tax situation is similar to last years - it would be an absolute waste to pay that kinda money again this year. <br>  <br>  Now here is my lecture :<br>  <br>  Most people stay away from online filing because they think their tax return is complicated - when in reality its NOT. <br>  <br>  In fact I will put all the falling situations as an easy tax return - even though it scares many people. <br>  <br>  -  Multiple W2s  <br>  -  Itemized deductions (Schedule A)<br>  -  Business income as sole proprietorship (Schedule C) <br>  -  Schedule D (Investment income)<br>  -  Charitable contributions (cash or stuff you donate)<br>  -  Others : Child tax credit, Hybrid vehicle credit<br>   <br>  Some people get petrified when they hear a term like 'depreciation'. Believe me, all the major tax programs out there are incredibly good at calcuating this and even filling the tax forms automatically for you. The questions it asks for figuring out depreciation are very simple  like  "When did you buy the item", What was its cost, How long did you own it etc. etc.<br>  <br>  So go ahead and use the tax program.  In fact most accountants also use similar programs in their offices (so they don't make errors themselves!!)<br>  <br>  Visit this website and read reviews of all the major online tax companies (including turbotax)|`|59744c9a78f602ddb3bfdccb3f3baa25aa	I would try to do it yourself first, SE forms are not really that complicated if you keep good records.|`|28b037c9067df2ec28f25fbd2bab84e3aa	Accountants are generally the most expensive way to get your taxes done, and not worth the cost for all except a small number of high income people with unuasually complex returns.  You could find a competent tax preparer pretty easily who would do the return for probably around half that and do just as good a job.  Or, if you're willing to put in the effort, do it yourself for free.|`|KxxkOPeTaa	Ricko -<br>  <br>  It all depends on what type of service you are looking to receive. If you are good with numbers and navigating the IRS forms, then you can try one of the tax software packages. But some people just don't like to even think of numbers so one of the chains (JH or HR, etc) could help you out. Depending on how complicated your return is, you could be charged $300 or more and people usually say the service is hit-or-miss. You may get a really good tax professional who has been working there for years or you may get someone who just took one of their "quick study" courses and is doing taxes to earn a few bucks. Either way, the company will stand by the return.<br>  <br>  You can also hire a CPA - there are many CPA’s online that you can use. Plus, CPA's are probably the most knowledgeable in terms of tax law and regulations and during this time of year, many charge extremely competitive rates - sometimes better than HR / JH or the software packages.  In fact, the one I use (linked below) each year only charges around $50 for my return – it’s really a great deals compared to the other guys.
3DGMkjrPaa	Actually, when you take out a simple interest auto loan, you pay more principal than interest for the 1st half of the loan. If you only have 1 year left, then even though you will save some money on interest, it won't be as much as you think. You can click on my profile and go to the Auto Evaluator's website and look at the resources page. I have a graph to show you how a simple interest loan is compounded.<br>  <br>  Also, a good place to check is...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://autoloan.lowratetoday.com/" rel="nofollow">http://autoloan.lowratetoday.com/</a><br>  <br>  Best of luck to you.|`|Anl1DxH4aa	It might really save you a lot of running around to just get a car loan quote online to see what todays rates are.  You might be pleasantly happy.  Also if your credit is not good, a lot of online loaners are more willing to help people.<br>  <br>  What I most often tell folks is that an internet quote at <a href="http://autoloan.saverightnow.info" rel="nofollow">http://autoloan.saverightnow.info</a> is the way to go.|`|0LLekEuXaa	Go ahead and pay the load that way you dont have debt later on in life, and your credit wont sink either.|`|C02lxopxaa	if u have the money pay it off|`|y4SUDnpaaa	It's usually a bad choice to add the existing loan on the car you are trading in to the new car loan. When your drive off the car lot you are already upside down.....because of the old balance being added to the new loan you owe more than the car is worth.   I would definitely pay off the car loan first.
Ch9TedMcaa	Here you go.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.geinterestplus.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.geinterestplus.com/</a>|`|AA10259042	No, it is not as easy to buy bonds as stocks. Most bonds are not traded on an exchange.  Instead they are sold from dealer inventory.  Assuming that GE sells its bonds through an IPO, you will need to contact your stock broker and ask if he is going to participate in the IPO.  If so, you might be allowed to enter an order.  If not you might also be able to buy them in the after market after the IPO.  The minimum is usually $1,000. Some do have a smaller minimum.  With municipals the minimum is usually $5,000.  You can ask your broker to find you some GE bonds.  Brokers sell bonds by marking them up and selling them on a yield to maturity basis. If they are callable, you will also need to know the yield to call.  It can be considerably less. <br>  <br>  My broker is currently quoting GE Capital 6% due 2012 at 91 to yield 9.259%. GE Capital is not GE though. It is a subsidiary.  He is also quoting a minimum purchase of 1 bond which would wind up costing $910 plus accrued interest.  He has quite a few GE Capital issues in inventory currently going out to 2017 and yielding 9.39% for the 2017 issue. He also has a few smaller bits and pieces in smaller quantities yielding 9.5%.  These are issues with only a few thousand in inventory.|`|9M19YxzKaa	It would be appropriate to contact you bank in this regard and speak to the manager or dealing executive.

gXJdryRNaa	It is refreshing to see someone want to set a budget.  As a child my family always had a budget and our mom showed us how to do it.<br>  <br>  You can use Excel, Word, or simply write it out on paper.<br>  <br>  You will need 12 different budget sheets ~ 1 for each month.<br>  <br>  Start at the top and state which month it is.<br>  <br>  EX:<br>  <br>  March 2009<br>  <br>  Next, list your paycheck dates as INCOMING.<br>  <br>  EX:  3rd<br>        10th<br>        17th, etc.<br>  <br>  Add up your incoming amounts and total it.<br>  <br>  Under that list all your expenses.  Rent (allot the $600 in case your roomie bails on you), utilities (gas, electric, land line phone, cable, etc) separately in a column.  Put in a budgeted amount, say $50 a month for electric and in the next column put actual amount.<br>  Next list your credit cards, separately one by one.  Then list doctor bills.<br>  <br>  Also, include a section for automobile, groceries, contributions or charity, entertainment (includes movies, restaurants etc.) and miscellaneous.<br>  <br>  For example:<br>  <br>  <br>  Incoming:<br>  <br>  October 3rd - $1635.00<br>  October 10th - 1635.00<br>  October 17th - 1635.00<br>  <br>  Outgoing:                       Budgeted         Actual<br>  <br>  Rent/Mortgage<br>  Gas<br>  Electric<br>  Cable<br>  Phone - landline<br>  Phone - Cell<br>  Visa -<br>  MC - <br>  Visa - <br>  Dr. Johnson<br>  Dr. Jackson<br>  <br>  Miscellaneous (all extra)<br>  Charity<br>  Groceries<br>  Automobile<br>  Entertainment<br>  <br>  In the budgeted amounts, estimate what you think the bill will be.  When the bill comes put the actual amount in the actual column.  The next month you will be able to adjust.<br>  <br>  Keep track of all your expenses from dry cleaning to music purchases.<br>  <br>  This will help you track your money and see where you actually spend it.  <br>  <br>  Also, balance  your checkbook at the end of every month and write all receipts into your checkbook as soon as you receive them (for debit cards)   This will help ensure that you don't overdraw your account.<br>  <br>  Do not rely on your roomie to cough up the expenses.  Split the expenses by having some of the utilities in your name and some in theirs.  Have both names on the lease which will help keep your roomie in place.  Harder to leave when there is a lease with their name on it.<br>  <br>  Good luck and have fun.|`|0rpS2b97aa	Buy Dave Ramsey's book|`|EgZZjm6zaa	All I can tell you is to write everything down; bills, gas, transportation, food, and ETC. vs. how much your income is. Try to pay for everything you NEED first. Then set a side money for things you WANT like clothes, shoes, whatever. Always try in save money even if it's 20 dollars from your income bi weekly. I would try getting a saving account and don't touch the money you save unless it a real emergency. Set small goal and before u know it you have a lot of money saved up. I would also try saving for expense items you want as well as emergency money but, keep them separate. it' takes a lot of will power. I know this because I have the same spending problem but having SECURITY is more important to me. Just find a reason why U want to save. I hope this can help u....|`|AA11877260	The utilities at least electric and gas will vary from month to month (you may use more heat/lights in winter less in summer etc. Ask your landlord what the average utility bills are but budget a little more than that because they do vary. Cable and internet varies...we pay $99/month for cable and internet together...shop around there are some good deals especially for new accounts. You need to make a list of EVERY expense you have; including food (groceries and eating out), toiletries, doctor expenses etc...and base your budget on that. Then figure out how much $ you have to spend on extra stuff...I usually take out that amount in cash at the beginning of the month and then once its gone-- its GONE...meaning don't spend any more or you'll go over budget...and don't forget to set aside money to save for an emergency even if it is only $20 a week its really important to do. Once you write it all down you may be surprised how much your lifestyle actually costs.

oxL8MEKPaa	It depends on if you are independent or captive.<br>  Basically it goes like this.<br>  On Monday & Tuesday, or everyday if you want. In the morning you start making phones calls to set appointments. You keep calling for as long as you can stand it. Then you take a break or lunch or go shopping or do customer servive, etc. Then you start making calls to get appointments again. You try to keep making calls for as long as you can take it. The more calls the more appointments, the more $$$$$. And btw it can be alot of $$$. Try to set at least 10 appointments a week. Average is 1 appointment for every 10 phone calls made. Then you run appointments the rest of the week. You can work as much as you want. You make your own schedule. It is not a 9-5 job, unless you make it that way. you are your own boss pretty much.<br>  What company are you going to be working for to start out? There different companies that offer different compensation etc. As you become more experienced you can make more money depending on the company(s) that you contract with. You can go "advanced" pay or "as earned" pay, or both(the best). Different companies offer different contracts. Some are good like 95% - 250%, some are not so good, offering less than 95%. Do research and find out your different options and routes. The difference can mean an yearly income of " 50k" or "250k", or more, it;s up to you. What city are you in?|`|kyY0gvlqaa	Since you are just starting out, during the first 60 to 90 days you will be asked to put together a list of people you know, that you can approach to discuss insurance and or financial planning (if you are series 6 and 63) licensed.  You will be expected to be in the office from 9:00 am to 5:00pm training on the companies product portfolio, learning how to interview a prospect and you will be expected to make calls to set appts. for interviews with either people you know or some prospects that you obtain through insurance marketing efforts.  Typically you will be working long hours in the beginning of your career because you will be learning the business as well as prospecting for sales.  It is that way, because when you are new, it  is important to have a consistent work day so that you become disciplined in making the calls,  If you don't treat it like a full time job, you will not make a lot of money.  Most people who succeed in this line of business,<br>  (1 out10), are the people who are disciplined and prospect for new business all day and night

CDqKAIEAaa	Take a deep breath, Seeking Answers, and develop<br>  a plan.  Firstly, you will not be subpoenaed, rather,<br>  you will be notified if/when a complaint has been<br>  filed against you.<br>  <br>  The law firm, of which you speak, is a debt collector,<br>  and it is unlikely that they actually own the debt you<br>  owe to another creditor.  Instead, they are trying to<br>  collect on it, for a fee. They probably have no legal<br>  standing, but you have to challenge that fact,<br>  otherwise, they will get it by default if you do not<br>  respond timely, [to a complaint].<br>  <br>  You mention six months, so your opportunity to<br>  challenge the debt within 30 days of first being<br>  contacted by the law firm has passed.<br>  <br>  Do not believe, but make it your business to know<br>  if a suit has been filed against you, for you only<br>  have 30 days in whcih to repsoned in order to<br>  preserve your rights.<br>  <br>  You should have been served by a process server<br>  to notify you of the lawsuit, if one has been filed.<br>  The day of service starts the clock ticking against<br>  you to respond with 30 days after service.<br>  <br>  I cannot tell you how to file a response, which is<br>  not too difficult, but requires too much explanation<br>  here.  However, what you want to do is demand<br>  from whomever is suing you proof of the debt, that<br>  the one suing is actually the "holder in due course."<br>  <br>  Holder in due course is the party owning the actual <br>  debt.  This law firm has no legal interest in the debt,<br>  in all likelihood, and if no legal interest can be proven,<br>  they have no standing to sue, and the case gets<br>  dismissed, but the onus is on you to make the <br>  challenge.<br>  <br>  Actually, you have more control than you think, if<br>  you have not yet been served, and your biggest<br>  gun is challenging holder in due course status,<br>  as mentioned.  Again, once challenged, the party<br>  suing you must provide proof that they actually<br>  purchased the debt from the original creditor, or<br>  have proof of lawful assignment of the debt.  An<br>  assignment give them rights as a holder in due <br>  course.  Most debt collectors never get either.<br>  <br>  Break it down into steps and  proceed accordingly.<br>  I know this is not a full answer, for that would take<br>  hours, at a minimum, but it should get you started<br>  in knowing how to protect yourself.<br>  <br>  Kind regards.

You see a bud product, and you've seen 9 of their commercials (not like a coors light 'look how cold our beer is' ad, but something that, whether taste is involved or not, it sticks on your short term memory) in the last 3 hours, so you have an "ah what the hell" attitude, which leads to a purchase...precisely their strategy...just a thought from a guy currently drinking a bud light.

However if someone called and changed your information, you are the bill holder, your name is on the account, and legally and policy wise they are not allowed to give out or change any information on the account without verifying your identity.<br>  <br>  Now if the supervisor wasn't helpful, go higher.

It is part of their agreement to send the bill, but your bill is due about the same time every month.  The person at fault for the account getting so far behind is your fiance's.  After not receiving a bill by the time the payment was due the first time, he should have been calling them to find out what was wrong. <br>  <br>  Keep pushing, keep calling, keep harassing them until you get your answers.

Aren't conversations recorded for a reason?<br>  <br>  When I did not receive my FPL bill the one month and was sent the next month's bill with the threat of turning off my service, I called.  Very frustrating, they do NOT care if the mail was not delivered, that does not matter at all.  Since it was only the one month I missed they weren't very rude but not helpful or concerned....or how about happy I want to give them my money and on time, they could try being that.  I didn't have my roommate's social security number to pay right away(account was in his name) so I had to run out to a check cashing store and pay that way.  <br>  I wanted to include the link for Howard but my web or wsvn.com is not loading, strangely.<br>  Sadly it sounds like a case where you would have to just keep calling and dealing with these rude people until they cave, give them their own treatment also.  I don't think I have the strength to sit through that.  Good luck and I am sorry they are sticking you with the stress of not even knowing who made the change on top of it all.  Did they at least tell you what information is required to make the change?  I cannot recall if they needed my social or not when I shut down my service with them, I don't recall them asking for it.
3mAgM405aa	It's a very limited survey opportunity which relies heavily on not being tricked into signing up for so-called free offerings, i.e., magazine subscriptions and the like because it's very easy to be charged for these subscriptions when you really do not want to accept their offers--only the payment for answering their surveys. Should your recordkeeping not be sufficient, you will be bombarded with endless so-called freebie offerings. And there's the added bonus if you are able to bring in other new candidates to this program. So, if you do not want to keep strict track of such offerings and do not have others to recommend, then the overall pay per hour for all your survey taking may prove to be of little value for all your efforts.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Pjm9pg7iaa	You are given 'tasks" to do in return for earnings.

RqQDKEVHaa	You're way overcomplicating the issue with "Most of the time if not paid with rent, or half of it, it does toward your next months rent." Huh?<br>  <br>  It works like this: You have to bring yourself current. So, if you don't fully bring yourself current, then you're still in default and late fees continue. That's not fees on top of fees; that's just the continuing fee.<br>  <br>  For example, in your case, you owe $15 on the 6th. If you don't pay that, you owe $17 on the 7th, $19 on the 8th, $21 on the 9th, and so on.<br>  <br>  Let's say your rent is $300. You make a payment of $315 on the 7th. Problem: By the 7th, you actually owe $317. As a result, on the 7th, you still haven't paid the full rent ($300 plus $17 in late fees). So, the late fees keep running at $2 a day. So by the end of the month, even though you paid $315 on the 7th, you now owe an additional $46 or so.<br>  <br>  If you wait until you pay the next month's rent, you'd then owe $300 for the new month plus $46 for the late fees from the month before. So you'd have to pay $346 on the first to wipe out the already-running late fees, or else those fees will just keep going.<br>  <br>  Put another way, there's no way to "stop" the accumulation of late fees except by paying off the entire amount. You can't pay $300 on the 7th, then pay $300 plus the $4 late fee on the first of the next month.<br>  <br>  Again, it's not a fee on top of a late fee. It's just the continuation of the same late fee for a rent that isn't fully paid.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|QPKgc1xJaa	If you have been living there for 4 years and they treat you that way your landlord is not kind hearted.|`|yZDw2lBFaa	They should set a limit on how high it can go.

y3ncYsS1aa	Hi <br>  <br>  A agency with a Life Insurance company is like running your own business and you do the business to make 'extra' money hence you earn basis your input. Let me explain various slabs or the broad structure:- <br>   <br>  1- FYC- First year commission is the payout an advisor/agent receives basis the amount of premium he/she logs with the insurer. This ranges from less then 10% to more then 40% of the premium logged in depending on the product category- Traditional, Health, ULIP etc. and is different from companiy to company.<br>  <br>  2. Renewal Comission- This comission is paid on when the customer repays premium in the second year and then thereafter till the PPT (premium paying term) of the plan. This makes life insurance agency a unique profession where you solicit business once but earn for years thereafter on the same sale/solicitation.<br>  <br>  3.Monthly Bonus- Subject to your achieving certain sales slab of new business in a month certain Insurance companies pay out extra incentive on the the incentive earned on FYP.<br>  <br>  4. Quartrly Bonus- Subject to achieving certain sales slabs of new business in three months certain companies payout extra bonus over and above FYP and monthly bonus.<br>  <br>  5. Yearly bonus- Subject to acieving certain sales slabs of new business in 12 months certain companies payout extra bonus over and above FYP, monthly and quartrly bonus.<br>  <br>  So like Sachin Tendulkar - You will receive attractive prize money every time you hit a four or sixer and a big booty for scoring a century, and a bigger booty for double century. <br>  <br>  6. MDRT- This year as a advisor if you do a business till 31st Dec'09 of Rs.3,358,400/- you qualify for a all paid foreign trip which is organised for top performers by Million Doller Round Table' conference. <br>  <br>  7. Be rest assured small expenses like fuel, telephone etc. will gradually get paid for /reimbursed if you have shown commitment.<br>  <br>  8. Every insurance commpany would offer you a opening as Sales Manager or Unit Manager subject to achieving targets in the range of 7-10 lakh in six to 12 months (differs from insurer to insurer). which has a starting salary range of Rs.3 to 4.5 Lakh plus incentives. Your profile would change to a recruiter and then you will have to prospect and build your team of advisors.<br>  <br>  So which path you wish to take- Enterpreneur or Manager ?|`|sTCZNrREaa	I think usually insurance agents don't get a fixed salary as in most insurance companies world wide.

If this is the first time you've ever been assessed a late fee you should call Capitol One and tell them the circumstances, they may waive the late fee for one time only.

Visit the below site to get 100% free work at home jobs:<br>  <a href="http://www.wahor.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.wahor.net</a>|`|3mAgM405aa	This off-line typing opportunity only applies to the U.S., Canada and Europe.<br>  <br>  If you are an accomplished typist - word processor and have recently visited your local 4-year university librarian, you can apply as a "certified" graduate typist, earning between $1.50 to $2.00 per page for typing a master or doctoral thesis. The librarian will ask the following questions in order to qualify you as a "certified" typist:<br>  <br>  (1) Are you familiar and have a working knowledge of Microsoft Word?<br>  <br>  (2) Are you able to set up section breaks along with appropriate placement of auto page numbering in the footer/header?<br>  <br>  (3) Are you familiar with setting up a scheme with emphasis on the proper use of auto numbering, such as 1., 1.1, (a), (i), etc.?<br>  <br>  (4) Do you have access to a scanner with built-in OCR sofware?<br>  <br>  (5) Do you have access to a high-speed laser quality printer?<br>  <br>  If you answer all the above questions in the affirmative, the librarian will provide you with a sample of the typing format template (i.e., margin settings, font selection, page set up, etc.) in order to complete these projects. <br>  <br>  The librarian will then place your name on a list of "certified" graduate typists. This "certified' list will be given to various department heads so that any graduate student seeking your services can easily contact you directly from this list.<br>  <br>  An average weekend income is about $300-$400 for two days of work.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|0F33OS8Haa	First of all, decide what you want to do at home in order to earn money using your pc/laptop. There are many ways of finding out. <br>  <br>  If you are stump on getting ideas, go to google.com and look up "work at home ideas and jobs", "telecommute jobs", or whatever you think would help your search. <br>  <br>  Make a few different resumes for jobs that you like to apply for. Some have it where there are applications online but always be prepare to have your resume on your pc just in case. Most of the time, they ask that on some job sites. It's better if you have it handy in case the employer requires it and/or just wanted to show off what experience you have. <br>  <br>  Check your email everyday to know if you might get the job that you want. In case you didn't, keep doing that over and over until you land one that you wanted to do. <br>  <br>  Another step to do while waiting is to post your resume online at places, which is why i stated it's important to have your resume handy, is because you have the option to post it at places. For example, craigslist have it where you can post your resume under "resume". <br>  <br>  If they said that they will contact you, make it accessible for them to do that. It's very important since you don't want to waste their time. They would have other candidates lining up. If you get the job, congrats.|`|B6EVKaFPaa	The first thing you need to decide is whether you're looking for a job or a business.<br>  <br>  There are several "jobs" out there but unless you manage to find a telecommuting job with a company, the jobs don't pay too well. Most of the work you do will be dependent upon what work is available. Jobs such as ChaCha, can be a lot of fun, but again--limited in the amount of money you can earn.<br>  <br>  A business can possibly have better income, but it all depends on you. The amount of income you earn will be dependent on you and not what work is available. Most of the companies will have a fee to pay for the starter kit. The cost can range. Some companies require inventory, so the starter kit is higher. I joined Scentsy and am having a great time with them. The starter kit for them was only $99.<br>  <br>  The best thing you can do is to follow your passion. If you're doing something you love, then it is definitely worth it. Do your research and ask a lot of questions.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  Lisa|`|v8b1psohaa	<a href="http://extra-money-now.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://extra-money-now.blogspot.com/</a><br>  <br>  This is a great way to make some extra money online.

An independent branch operates independently like a subsidiary except that it doesn't have a share capital structure. Instead, it is initially funded by the head office. Eventually thru its sales and other revenue generating activities, it may become independent, and a profit centre in its own right.
Ch9TedMcaa	ebay|`|rZIbcWFsaa	sell your virginity!!|`|QwQUdAbBaa	There are a few ways to earn money on the internet.<br>  1.A website selling products which is a pain and very very difficult to get enough exposure to make it worthwhile. You would probably sell about the same amount of stuff if you had a store on the moon. Ok. Maybe a little more stuff. But the fees, unhappy customers, returns, site maintenance, bank fees for cc processing, etc. SUCKS. Not to mention all the SEO and Google headaches you have to deal with. Forget about it. Been there, done that. No thanks!<br>  <br>  2. Have a website that is riviting and gets thousands of visitors each day. Then have Google ads on the pages where viewers click and you get paid for the clicks. Good luck developing this method. It is very difficult to do. People do it and make money but the time involved is lengthy and it may fail after you spent a butload of money, time, and a lot of energy. Enough said.<br>  <br>  3. Blogging - Type until your fingers are nothing more than mere nubs. Add Google ads and post the blog on every blog site known to man and wait forever. Maybe you will make $5.00 after 5 months. If you know exactly what you are doing, you may be able to make a modest living at it. I don't know anyone that does it except for people who have become an absolute authority in some subject. It is tough. You will soon lose all your hair and start writing things like "All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy" one hundred thousand times and post it on all your blogs. Soon after that, you will think chasing your beloved family members around the house with an axe seems like a great way to pass the time. Maybe it won't get to that. But you get the idea.<br>  <br>  4. You can be an affiliate marketer which can be very lucrative if you are willing to devote your time and effort in to it. You will definitely need a little money to start off with. If you can muster up $500 you can start making money at it. Definitely sign up for a site that will show you how to do it step by step otherwise you will be throwing your money away and not making much in return. Make sure you dont sign up with a scam site. The site below is The Best out there. They have about 50 how-to videos and a quick money blueprint that can get you making money the first day if you like. It does cost to join, of course. They can't give away this wealth of information for free. The alternative is to try, fail, research, try, fail again, etc, etc. Until you just give up. Which is most people do. Let's face it, if it was easy, everyone would do it, right? Go with someone who has done all the failing, spending, research and then succeeding and now knows exactly how to make a lot of money online. Then all you have to do is follow what they do. I am signed up and am damn glad I did it. I have been with the club for about 4 weeks and am making more money already than I did with my website that I had for 1 1/2 years. It is awesome!<br>  I'm going to get pretty rich off this business! Hell yeah! <br>  Good Luck - Hope this helps.|`|K3GqL95iaa	Do you have the knowledge; which can give to you the abilities of the sureties of itself; for giving surity to you; about the following; in the  forms of the knowledge of self; <br>  <br>  a) creation of the destiny of self, by self through the work of self; <br>  <br>  b) construction of .prospects of growth, development and progress of self through the actions of self; <br>  <br>  c) causes of happiness, satisfaction and pleasantness in the senses, mind and body of self through the activities of self; and finally;<br>  <br>   d) reasons of self to continue to work; i.e to continue to gain the help of  excellence and perfection of the intelligence of the higher nature of self ( of that of good luck) in the work, actions, and activities of self.  <br>  <br>  IF YOU DO NOT; THEN BE SURRE THAT U SHALL FAILINGLY WORK HARD; AND SHALL CONTINUE TO DO SO; LIKE A BEARER OF BURDEN, UNEDUCATED, LOWLEY PERSON, AND WITH ANIMAL INSTINCTS ONLY; I.E OF THOSE OF LUST, GREED AND SELF INTEREST ONLY; AND FINALLY WITH THE POWERS OF ATTRACTION OF THE MATERIAL NATURE OF MONEY, MATERIAL GOODS, MACHINES, MEDICINES, AND KINDNESS OF MAN IN THE MIND OF SELF ONLY .|`|4WVbjbWxaa	blogging<br>  <br>  affiliate marketing<br>  <br>  building websites<br>  <br>  clickbank<br>  <br>  cj|`|EVsMabkKaa	I AM GETTING PAID FROM THIS SITE FOR NEARLY ONE YEAR<br>  <br>  EARN $20,$30,$50 PART TIME EASILY WITH PROOF.<br>  <br>  Minimum payout $75 Via Alert pay,check OR pay pal.<br>   <br>  <a href="http://infocean.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://infocean.blogspot.com</a>|`|8c7e3988677bf2c6b10c6ab0551a11bbaa	I want to tell you about this great site I found.

You will indicate that you are claiming the credit for 2008 even though you have purchased in 2009.  Then you will file an amended tax return for the extra $500 after the IRS's software will allow the extra amounts.  This way you will already have most of the money coming.

lnFCbFcxaa	Hi Love,<br>  <br>  There are plenty of ways to promote your business online, and if you are willing to put in the time required, your budget should not be a problem.<br>  <br>  If you have not done so already, make sure you have your own website. Even if you are on an extremely limited budget, I would strongly recommend endeavoring to afford this.  Depending on how tight your budget is there are always alternatives. Google for example allows you to create your own website for free, however you will not have much flexibility with your URL (a possible solution here is creating a domain name and setting up domain forwarding and domain masking. While there is a cost associated with this, it is very minimal). <br>  TIP: If you are trying to save some money, when creating your domain or website, google search promotion codes or vouchers for the hosting company you have chosen and you should be able to keep a little extra cash in your back pocket. <br>  <br>  Now for the advertising. To begin with you could try posting in Forums on subjects based around your product or service. Try doing a google search for forum's based around your business and see what comes up. Remember with forum's the key is to provide as much value as you can, and to not just directly advertise your website. Have a link to your website in your signature along with a call to action (if you do not ask people to click on your link, chances are they won't). The more value you add to the online community, the more clicks you will receive.<br>  <br>  Another possible free source of advertising is to submit Articles. Google search Advertising Directories and see what comes up. A good place to start is a website called EzineArticles. If your not sure how to write an article, look at what is popular and successful and try to copy what they do. How do they write their articles? How do they structure it? What is it that makes their article stand out? Remember it is all about how much value you can add, but you still want to leave your potential customer hungry and wanting more!<br>  TIP: Always continue to educate yourself. If you are on a budget, search through some of the other articles and you might even find some handy tips on advertising your business. However having said that, make sure you are careful who you take advise from. Sometimes the most costly advice is free.<br>  <br>  And lastly, you do not have to advertise your business solely online. There is a lot of competition online so do not forget about the offline world as well. Maybe to begin with, go to your local library and read some books on Sales and Marketing (I would recommend this regardless of where you chose to advertise). I have found one of the more successful forms of offline advertising to be Drop Cards. These are basically just business cards, small enough to fit your customers pocket, with a little advertisement on each one. You can drop them in peoples mailboxes or place them on car windscreens.  If you can try, to target places where people are already looking for a product or service that you are offering. You want to be as targeted as you can with your marketing to ensure you get the most out of your budget. If you can reach people who are in the market for what you are offering, all the better for you and your bank account.<br>  TIP: If you are on a budget, have a look at a website called VistaPrint, or google for similar sites. Business supply websites like this can sometimes have promotions that offer free basic business cards (a good cost effective way to create your drop cards).|`|f8keqLlkaa	put it on the net|`|iORKgGG2aa	you should make a free web page or promote it on myspace that's a great way to start|`|7WRMpSVXaa	buisness cards,coasters,polo shirts,tee shirts,ect|`|HiS1zhXUaa	what i would do is make up flyer's and go to some grocery stores and put them on the cars in the parking lots and see what kind of response u might get.....

qWytoOMmaa	If you are a tipped employee, then I assume your base wage is the minimum tip wage.  If you performed services based on tips, then the only split you should be concerned about is for your support (runners, bartenders, etc.).  If the complete story is what you tell, then your manager made a bad management decision - and "cut off his nose to save his face".  Additionally, you may have legal standing as you actually performed the work.  Here's why:<br>  <br>  1. The manager did not recognize that you were in essence taking on extra duties to keep his paying customers happy - and paying.<br>  <br>  2. The manager didn't have control of the floor and make sure that everything was covered while he pulled service from a section.<br>  <br>  3. The manager and your coworker are sending you a clear message:  customer service is not #1, and they ultimately would be willing to sacrifice service and reputation.<br>  <br>  4. Your manager has created a "territorial" environment for his waitstaff.  An example of how this plays out from the customer side:<br>  <br>  I come in, don't get the service I expect and ask you for help.  You, who are assigned to a different section say to me, let me find your waiter.  You come back and tell me he is in a meeting and you walk away to serve your customers.  I walk out with my money in hand, never to return.  And I'll tell a minimum of 10 people to never set foot in the establishment again.<br>  <br>  Feel free to take this to your manager if you feel it will be helpful.  Many a restaurant has gone out of business for poor service.|`|AA10842045	That is wrong. You served the table you should of been able to keep the tip.

QVomyNJEaa	My condolences.  You don't "short-sell" a house to the bank.  Banks are in the business of servicing loans, not acquiring property.  A short sale involves a 3rd party buyer of a distressed property (that has not yet gone into for closure) who negotiates terms of sale directly with the bank.  As the other poster said, getting into that position will definitely affect your credit, but not as bad as a foreclosure.  <br>  <br>  Some other options: Maybe you could renegotiate your current loan with the bank so that you could stay there.  Or, maybe you could rent out all or part of the house to offset your mortgage payments.<br>  <br>  Good luck,<br>  -Matt at AberdeenBuildingConsulting.com|`|RqQDKEVHaa	Check with a Realtor to make sure that you're actually "upside down"--that you owe more than it's worth.<br>  <br>  If that's the case, then a short sale is the most likely scenario. You could ask the lender for a loan modification--often involving reducing the interest rate, or stretching out the mortgage payments. Try that first, but be prepared for a short sale.<br>  <br>  As a previous answer correctly states, you don't "short-sell" the property to the bank. You find a willing buyer to purchase it for whatever little you can get. That agreement is contingent upon the bank's approval; the bank has to say OK to receiving less of a payoff than you owe.<br>  <br>  Check with a good Realtor and a lawyer.|`|rnfxNYx3aa	Jake just broke the rules for posting here with his advertisement so how or why would you trust someone who is not trustworthy in their way of doing things.<br>  <br>  Remember just letting the house do anything will ruin your credit record for perhaps even getting an Apt. to live in.  Are the payments already late?<br>  <br>  IF the bank will allow a short sale you could try that or the deed in lieu but the down side is the credit reporting for your future.<br>  <br>  Sorry for your loss but please beware the woods are full of Loan Modification frauds right now and I mean coming out the woodwork.

They employ people.<br>  <br>  Only a teeny, tiny, portion of the world population has the leadership skills necessary in order to organize the talents and labor of people into something that provides for the community as a whole.  Without these people, others, even if they are smart, even if they have important skills, cannot and do not organize themselves to work together and provide for a whole.<br>  <br>  Without large corporations, there are no jobs and there are no products, services or even basic resources like food.  Literally, the system YOU take for granted by which you go to "work" (and lets be realistic here...when was the last time you personally engaged in anything resembling back breaking labor for your daily bread...never?) get a paycheck and then go down to the local grocery store to buy food....does not exist.  In order to survive, you need to spend all day, every day, tilling the soil.  If you are lucky, you will make enough to survive.  Lots of people won't be so lucky and starve to death.<br>  <br>  Poverty and homelessness are the losers who are so bad that they can't even survive in this environment created by corporations where they give you everything and ask for very little in return.  Impoverished countries are this phenomenon on a large scale.  Entire populations who can't even do the minimum to get by.  They survive on the charity of others....specifically, the ones making everything.|`|9Kax4Kekaa	Of course, you slave for the rich man or you starve to death.  As Tom Morello said - "America touts itself as the land of the free, but the number one freedom that you and I have is the freedom to enter into a subservient role in the workplace. Once you exercise this freedom you've lost all control over what you do, what is produced, and how it is produced. And in the end, the product doesn't belong to you. The only way you can avoid bosses and jobs is if you don't care about making a living. Which leads to the second freedom: the freedom to starve."
r0clhYvmaa	All the ones aforementioned above obviously (har har, oh the irony).<br>  <br>  Any job with zero training provided to handle the tasks you are told to do, and where no one talks to you. Especially where management stands in front of gathered staff, requests suggestions, then as you respond with one they squash it immediately, then of course no one else speaks up. That was my local department store in 1974, but now my daughter works there and it's so organised.
