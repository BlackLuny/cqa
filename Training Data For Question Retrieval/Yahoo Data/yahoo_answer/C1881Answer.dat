qu68Y2Ilaa	First of all I would advise you not to use the ideal of using an index page to save other pages. As your site grows you can easy loose control and layout of your pages.<br>  <br>  A good practice is to creat a page that represents the design and layout of the website you want. Now since each page will have different infomation, mark this area as the content area. Save your page as a Template by Clicking File>>Save as Template. Then make those content areas editable. Once you have done this you can start generating pages from the template. An changes you make to the template will apply through the pages you have generated from it.<br>  <br>  Even if you have 1000 pages and you realise that you forgot to add a certain button or you simply wish to make a change to your design, you will only need to make a change to the template and once you click save, all the 1000 pages wioll be updated with the new change.<br>  <br>  The ideal of saving other pages from the index will not allow you to do this as you will have edit each page on its on. CAN YOU DO THAT WITH 1000 PAGES? Definately not.<br>  <br>  Hope you get it. Check out DWS3 Help for more details on how to produce a template for your site pages.|`|WSiDcyTsaa	if you setup a external style sheet with say:<br>  <br>  "<LINK REL=StyleSheet HREF="style.css" TYPE="text/css" MEDIA=screen>"<br>  <br>  Type code on every page.

NpZukuuraa	Pc is not maintenance-free devices. It’s not as simple as just power them up and go. Every pc, over time, will require routine maintenance to optimize pc performance and to avoid registry processing errors.<br>  <br>  The registry is a directory of system settings and options. As modifications are made to the pc configuration in the framework of hardware and software additions or upgrades, the registry is altered. Sometimes these alterations may clash with the current system.<br>  <br>  As time goes by, registry changes accumulate. There is significant risk of incompatibilities between the file processing. These issues translate into performance drawback that typically explodes overtime. To avoid the damage, it is necessary to cleanup registry file.<br>  <br>  Manual repair and maintenance of the registry is an extremely complex task that only the most technically inclined should take on or you run the risk of losing critical data and personal information or even worse end up with a computer that doesn't work at all. With the proper software, however, registry repair becomes a relatively stress free task that will improve your PC's performance without going round the twist and losing one's mind.<br>  <br>  Symptoms a pc registry repair is needed<br>  <br>  Performance issues that indicate the need for pc registry repair typically worsen and become more frequent over time. Once a registry repair is applied, however, there is a noticeable improvement in performance.<br>  <br>  Common issues that indicate a need for windows registry repair include (but are not limited to):<br>  <br>  You are having slow computer problems.<br>  Windows setting change unexpectedly.<br>  Shut down is slow and usually with error message.<br>  Anti-virus and spyware software didn't repair the issues.<br>  There are crashes and continuous computer freezes.<br>  The computer starts slow.<br>  Rebooting the computer is becoming a consistent problem.<br>  Errors specifically pinpoint a problem.<br>  There is an inability to properly add and remove software on PC.<br>  There is the "Blue Screen of Death.".<br>  The computer is experiencing lengthened response times.<br>  Computer internet is slow.<br>  Program launches are delayed.<br>  <br>  If you are experiencing a good portion of the problems above, there is definitely the need for an XP registry repair. The best registry software we reviewed is registry Easy due to the large number of repair and optimizer features compare to the price. It offers free scans to help you detect the extent of the problems.

Das Logo ist offiziell lila, kann aber bei dunklem Hintergrund auch wei? sein (siehe Fu?ball-WM).<br>  <br>  Als Yahoo! ans Netz ging, wurde damals jedoch die Farbe Rot für das Logo gew?hlt, weil es besser auffiel.

Ich würde C++ oder Java vorschlagen.|`|d5bc7cb69fb4a70494ffd6a8af071d4caa	Je nach dem, was du machen m?chtest.<br>  C und C++ sind die solidestete Grundlage, damit kann man alles machen, wer C und/oder C++ kann, der kann alles andere auch schnell lernen (nachdem man 2 Jahre lang C und C++ gelernt und erfahren hat).<br>  Interesse-halber sollte jeder einmal etwas Assembler programmieren, allein um zu sehen, wie gut wir es heute mit unseren Hochsprachen haben :-))<br>  M?chtest du Arbeiten im Office-Bereich automatisieren und vereinfachen, dann lerne VBA. Hier gibt es den Makro-Rekorder, dem machst du einfach vor, was das Programm machen soll und überbearbeitest den erzeugten Code hinterher.<br>  M?chtest du Web-Anwendungen schreiben, dann fang mit Java-Script an, damit siehst du schnell Erfolge.<br>  Perl ist sehr einfach zu lernen, sehr m?chtig und wie fast alle Sprachen, an C angelehnt. Damit kannst du schnell tolle Serverprogramme schreiben. B?se Zungen sagen, das es die einzige "Write-Only-Sprache" ist, in Anspielung auf die so vielf?ltigen Art und Weisen ein Problem mit Perl l?sen zu k?nnen.<br>  Wem Perl als Server-Sprache zu schwer ist, der lernt PHP.<br>  Phyton soll auch sehr, sehr sch?n sein!<br>  Wer objektorientiert Programmieren lernen will, findet in Smaltalk die Mutter aller Objektorientierten Sprachen.

Warum? Weil du dann wenigstens etwas lernst was du auch im Beruf anwenden kannst.|`|29b2b5a034bc72283fd3bea1399df943aa	Ganz klar, Ruby. Mit Ruby kann man nicht nur Spiele und Programme, sondern auch Webseiten programmieren mit dem Ruby on Rails Framework, da hast du also schonmal auf einem Schlag zwei gro?e Anwendungsm?glichkeiten. Ruby ist sehr einfach zu lernen, selbst wenn man nicht Ruby programmieren kann, kann man verstehen was ein Programm macht da sich der Text fast wie normales englisch lesen l?sst. Ruby ist eine High Level Sprache, das heisst für Spiele Engines ist sie nicht zu gebrauchen da Ruby da zu langsam w?re, aber für Spiele scripting wird Ruby ?fter benutzt, genau wie Lua und Python. Zu Empfehlen ist da das Buch "Learn to Program": <a href="http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/fr_ltp/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/fr...</a> von den Pragmatic Programmers. Es ist sehr billig und sowohl für Kinder als auch Erwachsene gedacht, da Ruby sehr einfach zu lernen ist.|`|3c9c222205501043ac96382f5dd54211aa	Hi<br>  ich habe vor 2 Jahren mit dem Programmieren angefangen(mit12!).<br>  Ich habe es da mit Blitzbasic versucht und war recht erfreut, wie einfach die Porgrammiersprache ist. <br>  Das Buch hei?

Angefangen von 2D über GUI(Windows Fenster, Schalter, usw.) bis hin zu Datenaustausch übers Netzwer und 3D Programmierung. ich habe alles in 2 Tagen gelernt.<br>  Ich kann es nur emfehlen.<br>  <br>  Felix|`|AA10000585	Diese Frage hat ein hohes Diskussionspotential, und kann u.U. sehr emotional werden, doch, ich m?chte Perl als Einsteigersprache vorschlagen.<br>  <br>  Die Erfolgserlebnisse sind am Anfang sehr motivierend, die n?tige Software ist im Prinzip kostenlos (ist aber bei vielen Programmiersprachen so), die Web-Community sehr hilfreich und, letztendlich, Perl bietet einige Vereinfachungen, die C++ oder Java vielleicht etwas kompliziert für den Anf?nger machen.<br>  <br>  Falls der Einsteiger auf den Geschmack kommt, so kann er oder sie Perl vertiefen und auch C++/Java ausprobieren. Letztere sind  im Berufsleben sehr wichtig.<br>  <br>  Ich empfehle "Learning Perl" vom O'Reilly-Verlag. Das Buch ist auch auf Deutsch erschienen.|`|43e20e701ea2f53a23c57240ea930e8eaa	Hmm Profiprogrammierer würden jetzt laut loslachen, aber ich fand BASIC als Beginner recht einfach zu erlernen. Leider gibts es bei BASIC unz?hlig viele "Dialekte", die beihnahe immer nicht miteinander kompatibel sind, aber m.E. ist BASIC der Klassiker. Als Alternative kann man auch C oder C++ zuerst lernen. Ist halt Geschmackssache.|`|98d0733abe0dc15e4c23c43c056016a4aa	Ich sags mal so.<br>  PHP ist um einiges leichter zu erlernen als Java oder C++.<br>  Allerdings stellt sich ja die Frage was Du mit Deinen erlernten Programmierkenntnissen anstellen willst?<br>  <br>  Wenn Du das ganze anst?ndig lernen m?chtest dann würde ich mit Java anfangen. Denn wenn Du da fit bist dann ist PHP kein Problem  für Dich. Kannst Du jedoch PHP gilt der Umkehrschlu? nicht!|`|ab7b8a5ffc653937cfe3e0ef726b969eaa	Als Einsteiger kann ich nur Visual Basic 6 empfehlen.

Also, you will need a 128mb or 256mb graphics card if you want all the features like Aero Glass.

I will take it you are younger than your brother even though you think you are old enough or as old as your brother.  One thing to remember is that your parents are there to look out for your best interests.  My Space has gotten some bad press lately.  Your parents have most likely heard this.  So in your best interest they have said NO to you.  You should give your parents a break and let them have this one.  If you like to ask them again for the other space then fine.  It is your right to ask.  It is their right and responsibility to again say no.  <br>  <br>  It is hard for you to understand or see the reasons they do things for and against your wishes.  They are only parents and they don't have a crystal ball to see the future, only their gut feelings.  So chill out a little.  <br>  <br>  Have them check the site with you.  Discuss it with them on how you will or can use the site.  That way they will understand you and you show them you are more responsible at your age.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|965b3a6ab47ae85ad3806474e77dd5bbaa	have fun i had the same trouble with parents when i asked to get myspace and they said the same thing so i did it any way an got into alot of trouble!

AA11618776	From about $40 or $50 for your basic home networking router, up to over 2 Million dollars for a moderately loaded Cisco CRS-1 router used by the big Internet Service Providers.  Pretty big price range!  Not sure if you meant just for home networking, in that case, the ceiling is probably more like $200 based on what features and new technologies like 802.11n are offered.

AA10053754	Actually no, but you have a chance to protect yourself:<br>  1. You turn off java (not javascript) for the browser<br>  2. Have a decent antivirus program installed with auto protection enabled. You can also scan the exe file before running.<br>  3. Have Windows Defender and another anti malware application installed. Make sure that autoprotection for Windows Defender is on.<br>  <br>  Then you wouldn't need to worry about "dangerous" applications.<br>  <br>  Here are some tips:<br>  Usually, real keygens are zipped with .nfo files. So check if the zip/rar file for the keygen includes any additional files. You can also open the nfo file with notepad to get more info about the keygen. Note that none of the respected groups would try to install malware into your system.<br>  <br>  If there is only a single file in zip/rar named "keygen.exe" or similar, it is probably fake. (To check this without running the file, download other keygens for other software from the same site. If two or more files are the same, then never use that site again.)<br>  <br>  If in case you get infected, shut down your computer and start in safe mode. Then clean using the "anti" applications.|`|6550b30f9666274461a0ce1fb9acdd51aa	no

5876631d814e82e1fd966805215a3fdeaa	Well in cold fusion its comparatively easier to do all the stuff than in PHP.<br>  but its easiest when u use asp.net 2.0 using visual studion 2005<br>  hope that helps<br>  Lax|`|AA11450657	I've worked with both, and I almost always recommend the PHP/MySQL solution to clients and manage to convince them to turn around, even when ColdFusion is their first choice. That said, there are definitely reasons to consider ColdFusion, but it depends on what the plans are for the site. First, the pro-PHP argument...<br>  <br>  ColdFusion costs money, and so does the server it sits on. You'll need IIS and ColdFusion servers. Expect to lay out a few grand just for software if you want the hardware on your location instead of outsourcing. Then, when the site gets really popular and you want a server farm to handle the extra load, you'll be out another few grand PER SERVER, just for the software. Now compare that to a LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) solution, where all the software is free.<br>  <br>  In terms of features and the learning curve, both languages are initially similar because they both embed code directly in the HTML via tags. The similarities stop as the applications grow more complex. PHP definitely has more features, and more add-in modules available. The DANGER of PHP is that it's almost too easy. It's easy to find someone who can throw a program together. Getting a software engineer who knows how to design extensible, robust, easy-to-maintain code, that's another story. A great many of my clients come to me not with new products they want me to design, but with existing "almost finished" projects that are abandoned by the student they hired dirt-cheap because the code became hopelessly mangled and confusing. You DEFINTELY need to go into a PHP project (and any project, for that matter) with some specifications and a PLAN.<br>  <br>  For those reading this who are considering hiring a PHP programmer, ask the potential candidate about Unit Testing, Design Patterns, MVC (Model-View-Controller), and in-code documentation. If they don't know these terms, move on. If you've got an IN HOUSE programmer who doesn't know these terms, it's time for a training program.<br>  <br>  Okay, where was I? Ah yes, reasons to use ColdFusion... The one primary reason to use ColdFusion (or Java/JSP) is if you've got a dynamic Flash site that needs to get information passed to it from the server. For example, in-site chat, instant messaging, multi-player games, collaborative business applications, there are quite a lot of possibilities. Currently, Adobe/Macromedia Flash support is for ColdFusion (hey, it's their baby after all) and to a lesser extent, JSP. PHP is left out in the cold, unless you're ready to program your own PHP interface to work with your Flash applications (which is something I'm working on myself at the moment).|`|AA10240093	I would do your next site with Coldfusion and MySQL. This is a very good combination in my experience. Coldfusion syntax is easy to learn and manage. (it sounds like you're already doing great things with it!) You shouldn't have a hard time finding people that know Coldfusion in the future.. People who know PHP can easily pick up Coldfusion. Also, Coldfusion can interact with PHP if you ever need too.

Why make matters worse by blowing off like this in your posting???   You have identified a person and set them up for ridicule.  There are rules to this site, regardless of the many violations.

Just make certain that you are not the one violating and you should be (but aren't necessarily guaranteed to be) safe.  <br>  <br>  Personally, I don't see that all your *****'s should be considered obscene.

AA10312136	A fatal error is any error that the compiler / linker /assembler has designated, internally or by an input switch, to stop creation of output files on.  In other words, it is "fatal" to the process.  These are usually big boo-boos.  <br>  <br>  In this case, I have little information to base an answer on.  It would have been nice to know what version of the compiler, where the file was downloaded from and what it is touted to do and by who.  <br>  <br>  At a guess from what I see (including the error verbatim was very smart!), the code alignment is wrong and set at 1.  Probably this relates to boundary alignments, which enter into the complex world of Windows file format options, such as PE(Packed Executable) files.  I would hazard a guess that one of the following two things is happening.<br>  <br>  1).  Your version of Borland Turbo C / C++ is too old to have facilities to handle this type of boundary alignment as the library and header files need.<br>  <br>  2).  Your compiler is capable to handle this type of file alignment, but the automatic or default settings ( which are usually set to allow most compilations to be as painless as possible!) have been accidentally or intentionally changed to something non-compatible with the current project.<br>  <br>  I hope that this gives some idea of the problems roots.  When in doubt, investigate the documentation thoroughly.  All advice is free and damn well worth it!

ATI is good but I have no real experience with them. Nvidia geforce gs 7900 is much better for your gaming needs than the ATI card you have listed. Please note that Nvidia cards also have a higher compatablility rating than ATI cards currently. As for playing Oblivion, you would be better off with an even better card than what you've listed here. <br>  <br>  It would be helpful if you posted your computer specs for all to see otherwise the best video card in the world will do you no good if your pc cant handle it. Also, custom built computers are more of my specialty than store bought pre built ones.

Since php needs to be parsed before it is sent to the browser, it is faster to use straight html for the aspects of content and design that won't be changed.<br>  <br>  Use php without sql for things that will change, but don't need to be stored in the database, such as forms processing.<br>  <br>  When SQL is used that adds a further step in the processing of the page, and requires more time, so that should only be used when there isn't a faster way to accomplish the same thing.<br>  <br>  Webmonkey.com offers some good tutorials on the subject of php and sql, and devshed.com is another very good resource.<br>  <br>  Depending on what you are trying to accomplish, there may be a way to adapt work that others have done. opensourcecms.com is a great website that offers a way to preview a wide variety of open source content management systems based on php-sql.|`|AA10057642	U should use some sort of portal eg.

44229c4087ce69700bdae78fe0ac22bcaa	You may have already heard about what cookies are and where are they used. If you haven’t, here is a short definition:<br>  "computer cookies are small text files, which various web sites store on your computer in order to get specific information from it. Cookies are often being used for easier access to different web sites (these cookies usually save your login information or private details)."<br>  In this case, there is no need to be afraid of these small files because they are only capable of helping you and saving your time.<br>  <br>  As usually, there is another side of the coin. Yes, there are many harmless and helpful cookies, but, in parallel with that, various harmful cookies are being used by different Internet companies. These are also known as “tracking cookies?? or “third-party cookies?? and are able to compromise your privacy in many ways. For example, a company may enable their web site to store a special file onto your computer; this file will keep track on your activities, like web sites you visit, products you purchase or even forms you fill. Although it is unusual for such harmful cookies to steal information you enter into special fields, they are still able to become a reason of various problems. In fact, with the help of tracking cookies major companies may find out a lot of confidential information about you. For example, if you have filled several forms and posted your CV on different web sites, this tracking cookie may make it possible for its owners to know your IP address, your real name and address. All in all, your main “trump card?? (privacy) will simply fall by the wayside.<br>  <br>  Yes, tracking cookies are a real threat for your stability, but there is always a good way of protecting yourself against them. A few years ago Federal Trade Commission became really concerned about how major companies use cookies for tracking. This forced companies to come to the agreement, which helps users in protecting themselves from third-party cookies.<br>  <br>  The best way of protecting your privacy is having several opt-out cookies installed.

xHaRiX4Paa	The best way that i have found to build a website is through Webstarts. It has a unique drag and drop interface that makes it extremely easy to use.<br>  Here is the link.<br>  <a href="http://www.Webstarts.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.Webstarts.com/</a>|`|aJAOsvo2aa	if you are testing out painting a simple webpage, free hosting sites like pages.google.com, geocities.yahoo.com may be satisfying your  current needs. These free service usually comes with a handy WYSIWYG tool for users to draw up the webpages.  However, these free hosts are generally not as flexible as a full string hosting account and usually does not allow more complex coding (i.e. only HTML pages, no suport for PHP/ASP/Perl/CGI or  database support). Also, you may not allow to use your own domain name for your website depending on the free host's policy.<br>  <br>  A shared hosting account (i.e. many domains/accounts sharing one server) usually allows users to FTP upload/download, which is essential for webmaster to put up their webpages, usually webmaster will be using a website development program such as Macromedia Dreamweaver to develop the website in the PC, then upload the completed website using FTP protocol to the shared hosting account. Generally, shared hosting account will have more resources (i.e diskspace,bandwidth, email address) and support for programming languages like PHP/ASP etc., and support for databases like MySQL/MSSQL etc.<br>  <br>  <br>  For the start, you may want to try out the free host just to have a feel of building a simple website and slowly move to getting a shared hosting account if you feel like developing a more complex website.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|ebbae048944966f9a8ff16d1836afee5aa	If you intend to create more than 1 website, go for multiple web hosting where you could handle your websites in one account. <br>  <br>  Visit Following webhosting which is quite good. <br>  <br>  Hostmonster <a href="http://snipurl.com/1512d" rel="nofollow">http://snipurl.com/1512d</a><br>  <br>  They offer hosting of "unlimited domains" and you will get massive webspace of 200000 MB (200 GB ).

Many people have suggested deleting cookies, history, adjusting privacy settings, etc. <br>  <br>  None of this has helped.

I can access my profile page, the "myspace.com/"insert user ID here". But I can't log on or see any of my friends pages. I downloaded the MySpace IM and I was able to look at the bulletins page and replay to posters. So if alot of your friends post bulletins you might want to try that. Or at least contact one to get the word out for you. I thought I was the only one! All my other friends can access MySpace!! :( Good luck to you!<br>  <br>  <br>  Try using www.unipeak.com That worked for me. It's just slow as hell.

It was shut down legally for aiding and abetting copyright violattions.<br>  <br>  Now, for your problem, please uninstall Limewire.

If it only says it when you visit a certain website, than more than likely that website has been hacked and the hacker changed the coding to make it say that when you go to the site. You're computer may not be in any danger, but just be careful about returning to that site, as long as it's been hacked. If your IE browser says it all the time (no matter where you go), then I would run a virus scan/spyware scan. Also, look into Mozilla Firefox. It's an alternate browser. I use it and love it.|`|f6115061fd0f4e9e80462b3b0ffef101aa	While I haven't heard of this one before, I just did a quick look through a Yahoo search and found out it's a new virus and you have lots of company.

Rather, it is a question of what those who own the copyright to the material are willing to accept. YouTube does not have much of a choice when it comes to the removal of copyright material if they wish to avoid an argument with the authorities.  Though I do not think YouTube is technically breaking the law (the individual who posted the music is), they have a reputation to uphold.<br>  <br>  Think of it this way, making the music available on YouTube does not pay the people whose effort goes into producing it. Because nobody pays to access it, the artists will not earn anything. The net effect, therefore, is practically the same as if the music were pirated or just given away, and just as illegal as a result.<br>  <br>  Long story short, unless the legal situation shifts dramatically or YouTube somehow strikes a deal with music publishers they are unlikely to allow the posting of copyright material in the future.|`|TcfbqVVKaa	Its not youtube's fault about copyright.

Btv7Dn5xaa	I really don't like webs.com firstly. Just to get that out of my system.<br>  <br>  (before you read it:  a CMS is a content management system - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_man...</a><br>  <br>  There are plenty of content management systems out there.  You say you want to be able to edit the code once you learn - with forums this will be very difficult.  Skills in HTML and JavaScript are not really up to the job when it comes to forums.  Most good forums nowadays are programmed in PHP.  So for your forum a CMS will be imperative.<br>  There are many coders out there who will do a good price on forum coding which can be edited with a CMS.<br>  <br>  I think that if you are going to make a website, then learn, then edit - thats a bad idea.  Get some fundamental knowledge of the languages and apply them as you learn, (you can have your blog and forum completed from the start though).  The best way to learn web development for free is:<br>  <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.w3schools.com/</a><br>  <br>  A blog will be easy to maintain.  I would recommend getting someone to code a wordpress site and then using the wordpress CMS.  It is literally a matter of hours to code a wordpress site.  When I had mine coded I found a designer called Richard Hedges who really did a good job.  You can find his site here:<br>  <a href="http://www.richard-hedges.com/portfolio/" rel="nofollow">http://www.richard-hedges.com/portfolio/</a><br>  (I understand it is his new site, his portfolio has only been partly transferred).<br>  <br>  Also if you are looking for designers and coders try:<br>  <a href="http://www.getafreelancer.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.getafreelancer.com/</a><br>  You can post your project on there and many skilled people will bid for it.  The prices will be small as it is very competitive for the designers on there.<br>  <br>  I hope this helped,<br>  Ben.

The resolution tells the computer how many pixels should be printed per inch, and is referred to DPI or dots per inch.<br>  <br>  Most images have a default resolution of 72 dpi because that was what the typical resolution of a computer monitor was and most images are not made to be printed.<br>  <br>  Paint, Works, and many other basic programs either ignore the resolution or don't read it properly, or the image itself my not have a valid dpi setting, so the print size is hard to determine.<br>  <br>  Better paint programs give you the option to change the DPI of the image so that it will print the correct size, but keep in mind that changing the dpi doesn't affect the image at all.  It only tells the program printing the image how big to scale it.<br>  <br>  The only true SIZE of a digital image is the pixel count.  DPI and print size are just relative sizes that don't mean very much.<br>  <br>  As far as print quality, any thing under 150 dpi is going to look bad.  Magazines typically use 300 dpi for thier printing.  So if you have an image that is 450x300 pixels, you can print it at 3in x 2in and still have a decent looking picture.  Anything larger than 3x2 would look bad (it would be pixelated -- look like a bunch of squares...)<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!

gPzLD9gmaa	First try rebooting the computer and see if that helps. If you are still experiencing problems afterwards, update and scan your computer with your security products such as antivirus and antispyware applications. If you computer comes up clean after running your resident security products, you may want to consider running a System File Checker (SFC). This can be run in Safe Mode should you prefer. To get into Safe Mode either hold down or tap the F8 key repeatedly while the computer is starting up. To run SFC, close all applications such as Office, Messenger, Email, etc, and go to:<br>  <br>  - Start<br>  - Run<br>  - Type in sfc /scannow (include the space before the " / ")<br>  <br>  What SFC does is that it attempts to fix or replace critical operating system files. Sometimes this can be done without the installation disk, however it may prompt you for the appropriate operating system installation disk. If that is the case, then you know that you definitely have file corruption or something missing. Insert the disk if prompted. Also you should run SFC using the Administrator account.<br>  <br>  If you have the Vista operating system, the steps are a bit different due to the UAC. See the link below.<br>  <a href="http://vistasupport.mvps.org/system_file_checker.htm" rel="nofollow">http://vistasupport.mvps.org/system_file...</a><br>  <br>  Don't surf, play games or do anything while SFC runs. After it is completed, reboot your computer.<br>  <br>  One of the major culprits in missing or corrupt operating system files is running a registry cleaner or optimizer. They can flag important shared files for deletion or cleanup. Another cause is malware.<br>  <br>  NOTE: Before running any registry cleaner or editing the registry, always ensure you back it up first. If the registry cleaner you are using doesn't have that function, you can do it manually. <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/322756" rel="nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/322756</a>|`|d515506f6e02bb40beca71f11df22852aa	My Internet Explorer hasn't worked for years, it just does nothing.

Having a very large screen is definitely the most important part of your computer (I have a Dell 24" widescreen LCD) - more important than the processor or hard drive or anything else. Doing web development is not very computationally intensive, so practically any computer made in the last several years will work just fine. Having a large workspace really improves productivity. It can get very tedious to have 20+  windows open (multiple instances of Notepad, Firefox, IE, Visual Studio, Fireworks, Photoshop, etc.), and having a large monitor nearly solves that.<br>  <br>  Just don't listen to anyone who says you have to have a Mac, or anything else for that matter.

AA11275222	If ur using a Dial Up then the connection speed is really slow and the ISP is really bad. If ur on Broadband tell ur ISP the problem. I think its just a network related issue and they will fix it once the problem is reported.|`|VtR9Vow8aa	Without knowing more information.. I am going to assume you're being connected wirelessly.. And that the wireless connection you're using is just baaarely in range.   You could inherriantly have a super-weak connection.   In which case. You need to find a stronger connection someplace.
AA10035003	so the befcmu10 is a modem/router?<br>  then you'll have to call in the MAC ( it's on the bottom of the router modem ) to Charter so they can update thier server to "see" you modem, once the MAC number is registered ( typically 15 minutes ) you be back on their network|`|yHI6rfeUaa	I assume that your router worked with the previous cable modem and all you did was change the modem.<br>  <br>  I further assume that you have a dynamic IP.<br>  <br>  The ISP needs to know of the modem change because they usually link their service to the specific modem.  This may be a major part of your problem.<br>  <br>  However, the router needs to communicate with the modem and this may be an issue.  Power down both modem and router; then turn modem on; after about 0.5 minutes turn on router and see if things work.  This should rule out all the potential problems on your end before calling the ISP.  Be sure to tell the ISP you did the reboot.|`|55a490094301f48b76f5da8f784a4237aa	once you correct the connection no need to change back to old modem...

The smart thing to do is to dump Windows and get a good, secure, open source operating system like Kubuntu at www.kubuntu.org.  Mac also works.|`|AA10182911	the best protection is to keep it off of the net.<br>  <br>  but since i know you don't want to do that here is the next best thing.<br>  <br>  get a router even if you don't plan to network two or more computers. routers have their own ip number which hides your computer's ip number from hackers and they have a builtin firewall. this is firewall will stop stuff before it gets on your computer.<br>  <br>  also get a two-way software firewall like zonealarm. a two-way firewall also stops programs with spyware in them from reporting back to the author of that software. the problem with just using a software firewall is it can only deal with stuff after it gets on your computer.<br>  <br>  best scenario is to use both firewalls together<br>  <br>  if you have program that won't work with these on you can still use it. in the firewalls is an exceptions list. go in there and click the app you want to use and the firewall will let it work.

Also make sure that the emails that you are sending aren't too large, sometimes those large messages will get stuck in an ISP's incoming mail server, and won't pass through to the person you are sending to. Also, when replying to emails, try to delete all the useless information such as who sent it to you, the subject, and the timestamps.

Find your target market audience and get your site optimized to that market.  It take some time to get the rank and placement but if you are in it for the long haul this should not really be an issue.  There are other methods that you can utilize while you are continually updating your key words for SEO...Linkbacks within your target market are also another way to increase traffic.  There are some tools that several web hosting companies offer for submissions to the major search engines but direct submission would not be necessary if you are doing SEO.

You're better off to jump right into it so you won't have to 'unlearn' anything.|`|MinPTTUoaa	ASP.Net is a full featured programming language while classic ASP was more of a hybrid web tool set. To use and write ASP.Net is going to have a longer learning curve, but one that does not require you to know classic ASP.<br>  <br>  Knowing Classic ASP may actually confuse you more if you try to learn it first before ASP.Net. But overall, just be prepared for a major shift in thinking when you start building full applications with ASP.Net vs what you have so far. I've tried to teach new continuing education students programming concepts when all they understood was how to use tools (such as Livewire etc) and they were blown away because they were expecting point-and-click development just like with the other tools they used.|`|AA11098916	ASP stands for Active Server Pages. ASP webforms execute server side scripts to perform various tasks. You can embed Javascript into your ASP pages to use some useful features of client side scripting. ASP.NET in particular is very powerful in the sense that it does not use a scripting language like Javascript or vbscript as a code behind (like classic ASP) but it uses a full blown OO languages like VB.NET or C# as a code beside class.
MinPTTUoaa	Generally, a browser prints what is shown on the page. If you want to control printing some other way, you will generally need to take some further programming steps but even that may not work. <br>  <br>  In it's effort to prevent spammers from taking control of your PC, the browser makers require the user to take some action to print. So when you try to run the print commands you may just pop up the print dialog no matter what you try.<br>  <br>  The general guideline would be for the user to view or open the document and then take the steps to print the document. You might help by causing the print dialog to appear, but the user is most often going to have to complete the task.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

It's daft but easy to miss something.<br>  <br>  what do you mean by "link light"<br>  <br>  If the link light  is the ethernet connectivity light, test it with  someone elses known working PC - DCHP should automatically negotiate a connection in second or two, in which case you're PC's broke and you're in a world of pain. if this doesn't work, swap out the ethernet cable. If this doesn't work. you've got a broken router/modem. <br>  <br>  If the "Link" light is the DSL status light it can only be a few things. make sure every socket has a microfilter placed on it. unplug all the phones in the house and swap out the microfilters to make sure a dodgy one isn't causing problems.<br>  <br>  unscrew the faceplate of your NTE5 master socket and plug the router directly into the test socket beneath. If this works your home phone cabling is knackered.<br>  <br>  Do you have a crackly or hissing phoneline? your PSTN line is faulty and you will need to talk to your telephone provider to get it fixed. ADSL won't work on a bad line<br>  <br>  If the DSL light still doesn't come on and you've got a known working router and a known working microfilter plugged into the test socket, then either your line is dodgy or the ADSL provision order at the exchange was carried out incorrectly. you will have to get talk-talk to convince BT to fix it. talk talk will make you do all (or most of) these tests before they attempt to convince BT to fix the problem, as otherwise it would be rejected out of hand.

MinPTTUoaa	To add onto the previous answer, script is not only used in building web applications. It can be used in many different applications to automate routine tasks.<br>  <br>  It is common in web pages as a means for a web page to peform logical analysis of the data input by the user, but it is by no means limited to web pages.<br>  <br>  Also, when I think of script, I think of small bits of independent code vs. a full program which is an entire set of code to complete some action. So when you think of script, you are generally adding it to an existing application such as a web page, Microsoft Excel, etc. You only add the script to enhance the full features of that application.|`|8EiUf4HTaa	A script is usually a file that contains the code to do something. This file is read at runtime, interpreted and then executed.

Limewire and Ares are both tools to illegally download files (music, videos, programs, photos, etc.) I suggest you take this question off.

And lol, it's not illegal to post this question. Technically the music that you download is illegal to download. But, it's not a law that is enforced. As for programs like Frostwire and Ares, they're just tools.<br>  <br>  It's the files people put up for access that can be dangerous. Just don't download anything that looks weird or seems like it has a file size bigger than it should, or songs that are 1 second long. >.<<br>  <br>  Watch out for yourself and you'll have no problems.
rzT96KWQaa	You would still have everything from before you deactivated, friends and pictures included.<br>  <br>  The only thing that's happened to me every time I deactivated and then reactivated was that my groups disappeared, but they eventually come back.
pUzJiMUcaa	You're about to step into the wilderness...<br>  <br>  HTML and CSS are not programming languages, and although they may have prepped you a bit for idea of syntax, you have a lot to learn to move on.<br>  <br>  Your best bet is going to be to study up some basic programming fundamentals first. A great place to start with that is MIT...they offer their lecture materials for free for a lot of courses, including intro to computer science and programming. Here's a link:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Electrical-Engineering-and-Computer-Science/index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Electrical-Eng...</a><br>  <br>  Once you've learned that, start practicing with some simple javascript to get used to it.<br>  <br>  PHP and MySql work hand in hand, and while you can do a quite a bit with PHP without SQL, you'll need it if you plan on implementing it anywhere.<br>  <br>  (I say SQL, because really you need to work on learning the basics of SQL. MySql is a Database Management System, and while learning the finer points of it will help you, you need to learn the language to do anything.)<br>  <br>  I would stay away from doing freelance straight away, make that more of a long term goal. You need to be able to learn and work at your own pace, and freelancing is a LOT of stress (especially on a learner...). I tried it in college, and honestly, I'm embarrassed now at the quality of work I put out. If you do any "live" work, get some hosting space, and put up a site to play around with it. Center it around another hobby (I did this too..had a video game site up for years that taught me half of what I know).<br>  <br>  Programming is an intense discipline, don't underestimate it. Get connected to the community, ask for help (stackoverflow.com is a site you should get to know while you're learning...you'll get much better help there than you will on Y!A). <br>  <br>  Most importantly: Don't fake it. If you start thinking "Man, this is a drag...I don't know if this programming racket is for me...", Bail out. <br>  <br>  Programmers are born, not made.|`|9eae15fd25d6b9552deee228486e0aaaaa	I would suggest the MySQL and PHP over the Javascript since they are a bit more practical.  Javascript can be used later down the line, but for the complete backend, MySQL and PHP are much more functional, thus should be learnt first.

As long as you were not using one of their computers you should be fine.|`|m8C8MU2Maa	Don't worry about it.  A one time deal isn't enough to take on the trouble of tracking down the device that accessed the porn.  Every device has a unique MAC address that can be traced but you would have to be connected to the wireless network or they would have to confiscate the device and inspect.  Just stay off the wireless unless you have permission.|`|H3qYfp6Paa	No, Wifi routers only remembers the name of the device that connected to it. But a router can't memorize what website the divice went to.|`|cNZbaEDEaa	You have nothing to worry about.<br>  <br>  If you were using one their PC's and had logged in with your username, then they could see what PC was used and who was using it at the time.<br>  <br>  As you connected with your own device, they have no idea who it belongs to and you cannot be traced.|`|sJj6DxLeaa	idk if they can track it im sure they can't but if the teacher gave ur friend the password then im sure u wont get in trouble|`|Pv4Z88wPaa	in short...YES.  Every device that connects to the internet has  unique identifier call a MAC address (media access control).  This is hardcoded on the device itself.  When the device connects to the internet it registers it's MAC address with the switch.  The MAC address then gets associated with an IP address that is used on the internet.<br>  <br>  The switch remembers MAC addresses but unless someone was watching the exact time the "innocent" surfing was being done there is little chance they can find out who it was.  Plus they would have to ask you for your device to get the MAC address from it.  You are probably pretty safe.<br>  <br>  BUT DON'T DO IT AGAIN.  They can start tracking software for future occurrences.

En el primer caso (digital) podés decirle "si enciendo y apago dos veces, quiere decir que podés venir; si lo hago tres veces, entonces no"; en cambio, si disponés de un dimmer podés decir "si pongo la luz suavecita podés venir; si la enciendo bien fuerte no aparezcas."<br>  <br>  Como se desprende, el análisis de una se?al digital implica un marco de referencia mucho menor.

AA10146029	i mean ram will give you a fps boost but nothing significant. i would get 3GB like as you said 3GB almost = 4GB for diff price. btw. cpu usage is for cpu. pysical memory is ram. if thats high then get more ram, if its the cpu usage, then dont work with so many things at once<br>  <br>  goodluck|`|bKOiANR2aa	Vista 32 bit will not show the full 4 gigs because it can only handle 4gigs and some is used up by other hardware. If upgrade to 64bit it will show all of the 4gigs. I don't know what games you are playing or how many programs you are running but 2gigs is usually enough. But since ram is cheap right now you could upgrade to 4 gigs and you will see better performance.<br>  <br>  here is a good place to check prices and reviews on RAM<br>  <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Store/Category.aspx?Category=17&name=Memory" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Store/Category.asp...</a>

b64dba29891f746bddcabade2144ec27aa	I don't think you can on the non-Intel based macs.  I could be wrong because I'm not a mac guy, but am involved in vmware and the like.  I went to the top two vendors which do have a mac product and it looks like you need an Intel-based mac.  There may be some older version buried on their site that might work, but right off, it looks like the answer is no.  Below are the top two vendors and a podcast about it.<br>  <br>  PS: VMware is the way to go if you can do it.  They have a free machine to vm converter that works like a charm.  I used it on my machine and I can run it from a flash drive anywhere I can install vmware player (windows, mac, linux).<br>  <br>  PS: What the guy below said is all true except if you go to system requirements here:<br>  <a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/system_requirements.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/sy...</a><br>  it says: "An Intel-based Mac "|`|VN9MG1h5aa	Your in luck.  If you have used VMware Server for Windows, you just need to load VMware Server for the Mac, it's called Fusion.<br>  <br>  I haven't checked if it is out in general distribution or not yet, but it was close last I checked.<br>  <br>  You can use many tools to "create" your image of the Windows server as well.  One tool in particular that I have had much success with is called Acronis? True Image 9.1 Workstation, since it is a workstation.  If it is a server, then use the Server version.  They allow a 15 day trial, but it is well worth the purchase.<br>  <br>  From there you should be able to use the VMware converter tool to actually "Convert" the image to a running, workable VM.

Avast! offers free anti-virus protection to home users.  You can download it at <a href="http://www.avast.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.avast.com</a>   <br>  <br>  However, you will want to uninstall Norton before you install Avast! and you may (emphasis on may) run into a problem at this point.  Norton's install is "dirty".  It leaves files on your PC after it's uninstalled that may cause Avast! not to work correctly.  To uninstall Norton completely, you'll need their Removal Tool.  You can get that at <a href="http://service1.symantec.com/Support/tsgeninfo.nsf/docid/2005033108162039?OpenDocument" rel="nofollow">http://service1.symantec.com/Support/tsg...</a><br>  <br>  Just select your version of Norton and follow the instructions.  Once it's finished you can then install Avast! and it should work perfectly.<br>  <br>  That takes care of the anti-virus problem and may speed up your computer some.  (Norton has a reputation for slowing down your PC.)<br>  <br>  The best way I know of to speed up your PC is to buy a registry cleaner.  I know that you don't have a lot of money, but if the speed of your PC is REALLY important to you, you may want to make the investment.<br>  <br>  There are 2 registry cleaner titles that I really like.  The first is Registry Mechanic and it sells for $18.99 at <a href="http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=3701095&CatId=311" rel="nofollow">http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/...</a><br>  <br>  The second is Registry Fix and it sells for $37 at <a href="http://www.registryfix.com/purchase/" rel="nofollow">http://www.registryfix.com/purchase/</a><br>  <br>  Either one will clean up your PC's registry (that it must scan everytime you open a new program and most files) and make the PC run faster.<br>  <br>  Whew!  This was a LONG one!  Good luck!

Adware or advertising-supported software is any software package which automatically plays, displays, or downloads advertisements to a computer after the software is installed on it or while the application is being used. Some types of adware are also spyware and can be classified as privacy-invasive software. Spyware is computer software that is installed surreptitiously on a personal computer to intercept or take partial control over the user's interaction with the computer, without the user's informed consent.<br>  <br>  So basically, it scans ur computer for adware and spyware which is important because most anti viruses dont cover anti spyware unless you buy the complete suite. <br>  <br>  Goodluck!|`|5jMNBO2naa	when your browse<br>  your browser ( if it not firefox ) might or will pick up malware and other ad spying cookies and what not, those are stored on your computer<br>  <br>  in addition to adaware ( from lavasoft )<br>  you need spybot ( from safer networking )<br>  and AVG for viral threats<br>  <br>  |`|36q3g8syaa	Ad-aware stops spyware from being installed on your system by malicious websites, and can clean up things already installed on your computer.

Anti-virus and anti-spyware are not the same thing, but these features are typically bundled in modern products.

While it installs just untick the boxes as some you dont want.<br>  <br>  run the cleaner in windows/applications but dont tick the bottom 11 boxes in the Windows Tab.<br>  run the registry cleaner as well, when it asks to back up the registry , allow it to do it, then clean the registry.<br>  <br>  Also ccleaner will remove the  program entry that you may have difficulty with in add/remove, or the uninstall doesn't work.<br>  Just ensure you tick the one program and not the whole computer to delete, if you use this feature.<br>  <br>  Superantispyware (1 hour)<br>  ===============<br>  <a href="http://www.superantispyware.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.superantispyware.com</a><br>  Has a stop homepage from being altered which is good<br>  Can reset windows defaults in various parts<br>  <br>  Download and run superantispyware.

It might of been a virus or some other program that interfered or cambered with Dr. Watson to cause you problems because it's integrated with the OS. I'm surprised you were actually able to take it off without windows completely dying. Maybe the service you used just disabled it by going to system properties, not remove it.

7PDYQhOMaa	Just don't put any magnetic stuff around the system. You may find some stuff around the system if you look closely. Putting magnetic stuff around the system wrecks the motion of the computer and effects how it runs etc. <br>  <br>  Thats it from me<br>  <br>  Former Computer Technician <br>  <br>  Email me if you have questions<br>  <br>  Computertechnician@ymail.com|`|AA10146029	basically, unless you gave the computer peices a hug, ull be ok. but i would use gloves, not be on carpet, and there are anti grounding straps. you strap it to ur finger and bsaically what it does is saftey to YOU not the parts. theres been times that static electricitt will enter ur body and stop ur heart. not to scare you but the chances are really really REALLY rare. but yeah as said before, i put my new graphics card in with bare hands and it works fine. |`|0fCxkr41aa	Static can kill parts, but if you are working with off the shelf boards, it's really hard to do. If you are changing out a CPU or handling individual chips, the chances of causing damage increases tremendously, but just handling the board is pretty safe.<br>  In your case I would be checking your connections and verifying that your power supply is really the one your mobo wants to see|`|0GtonJONaa	you will not necessarily feel the zap. I have done a course on this and was shocked to see the damage to an intergrated chip under a microscope 1000X magnification (picture Hiroshima after the nuclear blast). If you are going to handle them two fingers by the corners, this goes for motherboards, RAM, grapics cards or buy an antistatic mat and wrist strap. You can only test them by plugging them in and seeing that they work, because you will not see physical damage.|`|kcKc0U2Jaa	They are most likely dead, next time, make sure you touch a piece of metal somewhere on the computer to get rid of any static electricity.<br>  Also, you shouldn't feel the static shock, it will transfer to the parts without any warning.|`|WjR56BF4aa	there is possibility. it is recommended to unplug main power cord before any kind of computer activity. |`|AA10091850	You shouldn't have a problem.

SBMKrMGjaa	 Hi to put any file on a CD first you must download the freeware to a specific folder or desk top to make it easy to remember. Then you must have burning software (eg Nero). you open your burning software import the the freeware file to the burner software & burn the CD. Depending on your burning SOFTWARE it should promt you as you go through the burn process. If you don't already have a burner you could download it as freeware I have heard Nero is a good burning software programme & is completely free. I will add the the direct address (url) below for free Nero 9 download page.  Once you have down loaded the software on a CD you can then re-install the programme on the new PC, When you install the setup on the new PC you then click on the new icon & finish installing the new programme, the only way you will have a problem is if this programme needs access to the internet to function properly(PC should advise of this if needed), other than that it should all work perfect. Hope this helps good luck. |`|AA10146029	try putting it on a USB stick. very cheap and useful. found at all electronic stores
2VYaWd7kaa	Almost all computers are the same underneath,  they are just packaged in different boxes and all have the same Operating systems.  <br>  <br>  Now comes bonus addons some brands have printers, webcam packages with there laptops.    I don't like buying retail for the reasons you can not upgrade.  look at the potential a laptop has to future proof the machine latter on down the road.  <br>  <br>  Dell's are not all that bad, the reason for the bad press is that more people own them, if you look at complaints per items sold they are all about the same.|`|cHjHXjRraa	All my PC's are Dells.

Good luck.|`|AA10146029	well, dell overall in a good company dont get me wrong, but the absolute WORST part of dell is its customer service. not to be racist, but i cant understand a word that the indians are saying (the number transfers you to india) besides that, its a very good brand but for school, try going with HP, Sony, or Gateway. those are brands best for laptops. if you want a desktop, then dell or HP<br>  <br>  these are my personal opinons soo|`|drqw3sdzaa	It is good we have two of them.|`|2rN7zZ8waa	Dell is bad. OMG I had sooo many problems with my Dell. I had to replace the battery, because the battery life is HORRIBLE. I had to replace the charger 2 times because it breaks easily.

I just bought a 14.1inch HP from Best Buy and I absolutely love it. It has a built in camera and everything. The price was really good too. Hope that help. |`|sd302xBNaa	You'll get a different answer for each brand. Everyone has their own opinion and experiences and there will always be good and bad no matter what you chose. Best advice I can give is to get a warranty no matter what brand you chose although, HP and Dell are pretty good.|`|KcIHQEOiaa	Why would anyone buy a dell? They have the worst customer service! <br>  <br>  Don't believe me? Try calling their customer support line.

True your socket 939 won't support the upcoming phenom, but really you can't go wrong buying a better video card if you are a gamer.<br>  <br>   That 6600GT is outdated. If your going to wait, but want to see performance gains now... I would upgrade that. It wouldn't hurt because you could still use the new card on your next machine. I wouldn't buy anything slower than a 7600GT(note:8600GT is slower!).<br>  <br>   If you don't want to wait. I would suggest the e6750 and save yourself $80 or more. Not to many programs will take advantage of 4 cores. But keep in mind. You won't see much of a video performance change at all with that old card. You'd need to buy a new one anyway.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps. OH, and use the ORB at futuremark.com to find what you want. It is a very valuable tool for builders. Just be careful to watch clock speeds and such so you know you are looking at legitimate stock performance.

Vista is a resource hog, and if you buy a laptop with it, it's battery life will suffer dramatically. If you do end up getting something with Vista, make sure it has at least 1 gigabyte of RAM, vista uses a lot of RAM to run. Also get something with a dual core processor of at least 1.9GHz. This will make a huge performance difference and she'll be able to run pretty much any programs she wants.<br>  <br>  You can go to dell.com, pick a laptop, and completely customize it for your daughter.

It's really hard to determine what caused the problem though, your best solution is going to be doing a full system restore.  It may be a pain but there's no telling what the update messed up and even if you think you got the problem fixed there could be other affects from it as well.  I would back all my data up since you can get in through safe mode and once everything is saved, just run the system restore.  You'll be back up and running in no time and be careful on what you let Windows download, any kind of driver for the hardware I wouldn't let Windows download because I've had to many problems like what you have happen to me when I let those download.

HAJXcZUiaa	Pros: They are very useful for holding tons of information that you dont need to store on your PC.<br>  <br>  Easy-to-use (hooking up to pc etc) and lightweight. (able to go with you anywhere)<br>  <br>  Transfers files fast if you have hi-speed USB ports.<br>  <br>  Sometimes they can be expensive but if you look around you will find a great deal.<br>  <br>  Cons: Poor manufacturing could involve corrupted files while transfering. (Try and find one from a company you recognize)<br>  <br>  Dont overpay for crappy external hard drives. <br>  <br>  Some are easy to break.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.<br>  <br>  Trevor|`|i6jrxysqaa	external hard drives are kind of dumb if you have the space inside your computer. if there's no room for another HD, then go with external, but if you have an open slot for an internal, get that.
AA10177120	You need to learn the basics of Perl syntax, how to use a hash, etc. before you can write this program.  Try this for starters:<br>  <br>  use strict;<br>  use warnings;<br>  use Data::Dumper;<br>  my %hiCount;<br>  for (1..6000)<br>  {<br>  $hiCount{1 + int(rand(6))}++;<br>  }<br>  print Dumper(\%hiCount);|`|KbuhVDE2aa	try this to generate numbers:<br>  <br>  use strict;<br>  ## this generates $limit rolls.<br>  my $limit = 6000;<br>  srand(3477);<br>  my $idx;<br>  for($idx = 0; $idx < $limit; ++$idx) {<br>   print int(rand(6) + 1) . "\n";<br>  }<br>  
AA10177120	Well the first problem is you forgot these two lines at the top of your program:<br>  <br>  use strict;<br>  use warnings;<br>  <br>  Your second problem is the statement $_**2; doesn't do anything because you didn't tell Perl what to do with the calculated value.  Try this:<br>  <br>  $_ = $_ ** 2;<br>  <br>  However, that's going to introduce a third problem, namely that the contents of @num will be changed and when you use @num later on in your program, you might get unexpected results.<br>  Make these changes and ask again when you get stuck.
hnEKlm7Aaa	To get a digit at a time from a number, you can do a mod by the base of the number system.  For example,<br>  <br>  $onesDigit = $number % 10 <br>  <br>  will return the number in ones place, if you apply this fact in a loop, you can get at all the digits(I will print them out, but you can store them or do whatever with them):<br>  <br>  while($number > 0) { <br>  # pop off the last digit<br>     $digit = $number % 10;<br>  # shift our number to the right(by dividing)<br>     $number = $number / 10;<br>  # process the digit however needed<br>     print $digit;<br>  }<br>  <br>  Remember that we are popping off numbers from the right.  The above code would produce(if $number = 1234):<br>  <br>  4321<br>  <br>  You will probably want that stored in an array of some sort, or do whatever else you need to with it(I'm not exactly clear as to what you're describing the assignment to be).<br>  <br>  Hope it helps<br>  
f1beDbKIaa	You're going to have to go through the hash - every element, and pick the ones you want.  % is the modulus or remainder operator.  Of course all your examples are odd.<br>  <br>  #!/usr/local/bin/perl<br>  #use strict;<br>  #use warnings;<br>  <br>  %players = ("David Beckham" => 23,<br>  "Pele" => 2,<br>  "Zinedine Zidane" => 5,<br>  "Diego Maradona" => 16,<br>  "Luis Figo" => 7);<br>  <br>  foreach $key (sort keys %players) {<br>   if ($players{$key} % 2 == 0) {<br>    print "$key = $players{$key}\n";<br>   }<br>  }<br>  |`|AA10177120	1. There's no such thing as PERL.  The programming language is Perl.<br>  2. Remove the # in front of use strict and use warnings.<br>  3. Is it the case that you are REQUIRED to bastardize your hash into an array (for homework)?  Or is it the case that you just don't understand what a hash is, and how to use it?<br>  <br>  Here is the bastardized array version:<br>  <br>  while (@players)<br>  {<br>  my $name = shift @players;<br>  my $number = shift @players;<br>  # Do whatever you want with them<br>  }

RDJYpamJaa	The default for HDD is C: drive.  Your options would be to reformat your hard drive if you dont care about losing all info from your drives.<br>  If you wish to reformat. Back-up any information on a usb drive/cd-rom/dvd-rom.  Insert your Windows XP cd.  When re-booting, open your BIOS, either "Del" F8, F1, or F12.  Set your boot priority to your cd drive and save and exit.  When the computer restarts, it will say press any key to run from cd. so press any key.  It will load a bunch of processes and then will ask you to agree to the EULA so press F8<br>  Next delete your partition by pressing the stated keys. once deleted create a new partition and DO NOT change the set numbers for your partition size, this is set by your computer, unless you are an advanced user, use the default setting.  Choose an NTSC (quick) format and proceed to follow the instructions on your computer.<br>  For any further questions/help feel free to contact me via e-mail|`|drqw3sdzaa	are you sure drive d: is not cd drive if it is not if it is partition then do the followings<br>  right click on my computer click on manage click on disk management when you see the partitions  right click on d: then click delete when that is done you end up with un allocated space now right click on c: then click expand volume when that is done you now have one partition on your computer partition c:  with windows and all the programs on .

kYANUuI8aa	A new laptop will come with an RJ45 Ethernet connection so I think the installation went wrong - try again.  Anyway the Ethernet connection on the laptop looks like a large telephone point at the rear of the laptop.  Perhaps the installation asks for the cable to be connected - a cable with the same connections on both ends should have been supplied.  Good luck.<br>  <br>  wdw|`|rgrXEFuaaa	Lol they have to be the easiest thing to install ever. You should have a slot on the side of the laptop where the card goes in. <br>  <br>  As for price they're are quite a few brands. I think the best is belkin, or netgear. Just type in 'Belkin ethernet card' into a search engine. They should cost around ￡10-￡20<br>  <br>  You will get a cd which you just put in and it will give you basic instructions. It is very easy trust me.

FBQZ06vraa	I haven't worked with Word Form Fields in years, but I think you have to write some Visual Basic code and tie it to the Exit property for the drop-down field.  The code would tweak the other field, via its Bookmark name (also a property),  to have the right value. You'll have to investigate exactly how to do that based on the type of the second field.  I suspect it will be something like "Field2.value = "Rep's Name""<br>  <br>  To see the properties for a Form Field, right-click on it and select Properties.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

Ojo, en álgebra, para multiplicar dos matrices, en la primera tomas los renglones y multiplicas cada uno por cada una de las columnas del otro vector.

20cfad276d2f2f74d4d5633616985126aa	Word wants to make a copy of whatever you open in the same folder where the original was. You might try: copy the doc over to your hard drive, THEN right-click --> Properties or Attributes. Be sure and check Archive to On. What other systems call  Read/Write, MS calls Archive meaning that it can record to media. Whenever we burn a CD in MS, the Windows changes that Attribute because the file is unwritable back to the CD. The fuzziness comes from how the property is named Archive (instead of Read/Write).<br>  <br>  If it still won't open, have your friend redo Save the same file as an RTF file format. Word keeps a whole history of the document for "Undo" when it is saved as a .doc file.|`|acL1vUh2aa	this normally happens for several reasons. electricity was gone while typing and the file was not properly/totally recovered. you may be trying to open the file using different typing software version (maybe he used ms word 2007 and u r using msword xp). mabye the file or pc was infected by virus before burning the cd. maybe the cd was not properly created or maybe the cd has scratch.

Press and hold the power button for about 5-10 seconds. Nothing will happen but it will completly discharge. Then, with your battery still out, plug in the charger and turn on. If it turns on, turn it off and plug the battery back in try to turn again. If it doesn't turn, you have a faulty battery. If it does, no issues...just remember that procedure as you will probably have to do it again down the road (shouldn't be a continued problem but does come up every now and then on Dell laptops).<br>  <br>  Good luck!

Stick to something people are familiar with.<br>  This one comes highly reccommended...........<br>  GOOD LUCK|`|mn1FJZ4daa	You could start by checking out some of the better virus protectors sites, or revert back to right before installing the Adobe if most of the files are in there (did you get it from a warez site?) If you did you might as well just reformat your pc to save time. Unless you know the name of the virus or viruses no tool will help you. Another thing you could try is getting a trial of something strong like black ice,Trend Micro also has a great product,Along with McAfee do as many as it takes if there is to much work at stake to loose.  Reformatting would really be the best if you have more than a few infected files ,you don't want it reactivated because you missed something thats for sure.Good luck|`|qXsmUrNGaa	Actually this worm makes a copy of it in every folder you PC goes in. So well your AV will not be able to clean it out totally. So you have to disable it first from the Task Manager. The from remove it from Startup. Then scan your whole PC and delete all the files reported affected. Then Restart and Rescan your PC and again delete the files reported affected. I think it will do. And if it don't why don't you chuck your PC through the Window.

IE is not a safe browser. you should use a more secure browser to protect your PC from virus.<br>  <br>  i recommand you to use firefox with Google toolbar. firefox can block any any popup and disable any virus and adware, spyware on webpage, so, firefox is much safer than IE browser. as you know, most of virus spread throught internet and webpage.<br>  <br>  besides, firefox is much smaller than IE, so it run faster than IE.<br>  <br>  download firefox for free, Just have a try:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.securebrowser.info/firefox/" rel="nofollow">http://www.securebrowser.info/firefox/</a><br>  <br>  Good Luck !!!|`|2tsLhOiMaa	Norton - Is a system hog and doesn't remove some stuff that it finds because it doesn't know how to or what it is for sure. Same as AVG and some others (McAfee).<br>  <br>  However, You can (listen people) CAN use more then one AV on the SAME computer as long as it does not use boot sectors to attach itself to your computer. This is what causes some crashes and AV's to shut the other one down because they both cannot run on the boot sectors at the same time. Research pays off.<br>  <br>  This is a personal exp and well as doing research.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|EF5375UBaa	I understand that Norton uses a lot of your RAM to operate and slows down your PC I am using Trend Micro and it fixed the slowness I was having although like most anit-virus programs it takes a while to run when you start your computer slowing the start up but most ppl leave their Pc on all the time these days|`|XSHsIeJtaa	I don't recommend Norton Antivirus, I used to have a Compaq computer in my room and it came with Norton Antivirus.  I thought Antivirus was good, I used it every day, until later on my computer started acting up so my uncle scanned it with this other thing and then there were so many viruses on my computer that Antivirus didn't catch, so then the computer crashed completely and then I lost that computer, now I have an HP in my room and it also came with Antivirus, but I deleted it and put another one called McAffee, thanks to that one I lasted now almost 2 years with this computer.  Now I use a different one called XoftSpySE because that one found more viruses than McAffee, it found 472 on my computer, so if I were to recommend a program that keeps your computer safe, I would definitely go with XoftSpySE.|`|xT2LB31Qaa	Norton products are memory hogs and will eventually slow your computer to a halt.  I would recommend AVG (www.grisoft.com).  It is free and IT WORKS!  Norton will be hard to clean from your computer but there are ways to get it done.|`|8OI6h037aa	No. I do not recommend Norton. It slows down your computer.<br>  <br>  Get avast! It works much better.|`|2FAXWV6faa	I use McAfee and i think norton is very good. Ksapersky and Trend Micro are also OK .

ba61e49db406a01601fe046bc7d3ec5eaa	Flash is a great program and can be a lot of fun to use. Once you get started you will quickly find out that you can make some cool stuff right away. However, the program is very deep and can get VERY complex depending on what your trying to do. This is because Flash has a programming language that it uses called Action Script. It is possible to make tons of things without learning Action Script as well as using other peoples code but it certainly helps to learn some of it if you want to make advanced applications like games. Don't let this intimidate you though, just start slow and don't expect to be making a video game or a very advanced and animation heavy website right away.<br>  <br>  The best thing you can do is search the internet for some good tutorials. There are tons of step by step ones with pictures and ocassionally even a video walkthrough. For some great tutorials on how to make all kinds of things in Flash see:<br>  <a href="http://www.flashkit.com/tutorials/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flashkit.com/tutorials/</a><br>  <br>  If you don't mind spending a little money, I would recommend going to a bookstore and purchasing a book like "Adobe Flash CS3 Professional Classroom in a Book".  This series is really great because it starts at the basics and works its way up. It comes with a CD with all the project files on it as well so you can see how things work and how yours is supposed to turn out.<br>  <br>  I should also mention that while you can use flash to create your artwork, it's not really geared towards this and it really helps to have another program to work with. You would use this program to create all your artwork, save it, and then import it into Flash for use in your projects.<br>  <br>  The best is Adobe Photoshop, you can get a 30 day trial at adobe.com if you want to try it. Not only is it the best because it is the program of choice in the graphic design industry but also because its powerful, has tons of plugin's available, and an enormous wealth of tutorials on the internet. If you go this way, these are my favorite tutorial sites:<br>  <a href="http://www.good-tutorials.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.good-tutorials.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.photoshopcafe.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.photoshopcafe.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.spoono.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.spoono.com</a><br>  Also search amazon.com for "Photoshop classroom in a book" to get something similar to the one I recommended for flash.<br>  <br>  <br>   If you want something a little cheaper I would recommend Corel Paint Shop Pro. It is available here:<br>  <a href="http://www.corel.com/servlet/Satellite/us/en/Content/1152796555406" rel="nofollow">http://www.corel.com/servlet/Satellite/u...</a><br>  While it's not popular among professionals, it is a good choice for hobbyist's and amateurs. You should be able to find tutorials for this program as well if you do a web search.<br>  <br>  Finally there is a program called "The Gimp" which is 100% free. It tries to imitate Photoshop in a lot of ways, and while it is not as advanced and doesn't have many of the great features of Photoshop it is still a great option for many people. You can get it here:<br>  <a href="http://gimp-win.sourceforge.net/stable.html" rel="nofollow">http://gimp-win.sourceforge.net/stable.h...</a><br>  If you want to try this, make sure to download both the "The GIMP for Windows" and also "GTK+ 2 Runtime Environment" or else it won't work. Tutorials are also available via web search. <br>  <br>  That's really the best advice I can give you. Be patient and stick with it, it can be a very rewarding program to learn even if it's just for fun.<br>  <br>  Good luck and have fun!|`|AA12001365	Adobe Flash Versions usually come up with tutorials to get you started and it'll introduce you to all of the tools.Just check it out,it should be either in the file you stored or should be in the start menu.Have Fun.

You have to hide yourself from the general public which prevents meeting possible friends.<br>  The best way to go about this is to delete her and make your myspace private.

QLg6r1fRaa	You can embed an audio file using the embed tag. Normally this shows visible player controls but you can always hide them by setting the height and width to 1 pixel so they are virtually insible like this:<br>  <br>  <embed width="1" height="1" src="myaudio.mp3"></embed><br>  <br>  where myaudio.mp3 is the full URL of your audio file.<br>  <br>  The next problem is to make sure this keeps playing during your slideshow. If your slideshow loads a new HTML page every slide then you can't do it cross-browser although the bgsound HTML tag will play for internet explorer. The sound will restart every page in these cases.<br>  <br>  So really, assuming you have a contained slideshow on one HTML page(best method anyway) use the above embed technique.<br>  <br>  Give it a try and let us know please.

If you are not sure how to do this correctly take it to any repair shop and they can do it for you, for the cost of one arm, one leg, and the big toe on your other foot.

It would be in your interest to take a small computer repair course if you want to work on your own computer. It will pay off in the long run.

You can go to the free site <a href="http://www.theresumebuilder.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.theresumebuilder.com/</a> and make your own  in about 10 minutes. Or you can look at a bunch of sample CVs/Resumes and maybe adapt them to what you have to offer.<br>  If you are still a student you can google for student CV help. I have a site but am not sure right now where. I will check for it. Also, for students there are some nice discounts for CV writing. Remember, if you are still quite young you can still list your high school on the CV, once you have some jobs and internships to offer, then not anymore.

ELXbfUVQaa	Hello, I'm sure that you can get it faster without having to buy anything. What is your internet connection type? If you have high speed but it shared with other people that that could be the problem because someone might be hogging all the bandwidth.<br>  <br>  Do you have anti-virus software installed? If not install the free one from AVG and then check your machine for viruses. Windows Defender from Microsoft is also free and can check for problems, it's the second link I listed. <br>  <br>  Sounds like your advanced since you knew how to defrag your computer so if you wanted to look at the details of what happens when you turn on your computer or open your browser there are two good programs that will show that info. AutoRuns from Microsoft and InfoFind from Omnicognic (direct links below). AutoRuns will allow you to remove the most startup files while InfoFind will show the most and allow you to filter through the list. Both can be downloaded for free.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, post what type of connection you’re using and keep positive this can be fixed without having to purchase something!

n98eNyGfaa	In many instances you can accomplish the same task using either a stored procedure or a function. Both functions and stored procedures can be custom defined and part of any application. Functions, on the other hand, are designed to send their output to a query or T-SQL statement. For example, User Defined Functions (UDFs) can run an executable file from SQL SELECT or an action query, while Stored Procedures (SPROC) use EXECUTE or EXEC to run. Both are instantiated using CREATE FUNCTION.<br>  <br>  To decide between using one of the two, keep in mind the fundamental difference between them: stored procedures are designed to return its output to the application. A UDF returns table variables, while a SPROC can't return a table variable although it can create a table. Another significant difference between them is that UDFs can't change the server environment or your operating system environment, while a SPROC can. Operationally, when T-SQL encounters an error the function stops, while T-SQL will ignore an error in a SPROC and proceed to the next statement in your code (provided you've included error handling support). You'll also find that although a SPROC can be used in an XML FOR clause, a UDF cannot be.<br>  <br>  If you have an operation such as a query with a FROM clause that requires a rowset be drawn from a table or set of tables, then a function will be your appropriate choice. However, when you want to use that same rowset in your application the better choice would be a stored procedure.<br>  <br>  There's quite a bit of debate about the performance benefits of UDFs vs. SPROCs. You might be tempted to believe that stored procedures add more overhead to your server than a UDF. Depending upon how your write your code and the type of data you're processing, this might not be the case. It's always a good idea to text your data in important or time-consuming operations by trying both types of methods on them.|`|psk4aPvuaa	A procedure is a specified series of actions, acts or operations which have to be executed in the same manner in order to always obtain the same result under the same circumstances<br>  <br>  A stored procedure is a subroutine available to applications accessing a relational database system.

AA11848792	I am more of a Microsoft person, so Zune is the best to me. Itunes came out a while ago and the software might be better now, but Zune is now making a lot of changes to their system and it is going good. They have many of the things Itunes has.

If it says insert disk, or you don't see any files/folders then your drive is probably dead. You should try getting a new Optical Drive. <br>  <br>  Also, have you tried the Device Manager to identify this DVD-ROM? <br>  <br>  If it's QSI DVD-ROM SDR-083, that's a ROM drive, not a re-writer.

Click yes when it asks to confirm if you wish to delete the key.<br>     5. Restart Windows.<br>  <br>  In the case that you’ve deleted both the upper and lower filters and also removed the device through device manager and you still are unable to read CDs or DVDs, this may indicate that your drive is bad and or your motherboard is bad.<br>  <br>  If your computer is relatively new, I would think that it is a drive problem.  If your computer is relatively old, then I would think it may be a bad motherboard.<br>  <br>  A good way to check if your drive is still good is to “boot” from it.

Ok the people are right your hard drive is backed-up. Ok you need to erase the hard drive of your computer (WAIT DO NOT STOP READING YET! I have done this and helps ALOT!!!!) Ok first if you have anything important on your computer store it on rewritable discs (NOT PROGRAM DISCS). These Cds can copy files, documents, pictures, anything that you want to keep. Once you have successfully copied them double-check they are stored on to it (IT IS VERY IMPORTANT YOU DO THIS STEP). After that turn off your computer and wait 3-5 minutes (you don't have to but it is just to take you and your computer a break, BUT you still have to turn it off). Ok then when that's done turn on your computer and on the top-right or top-left you'll see something like boot settings anyways it is the F12 key (it is that on every computer). Then you'll know what to do from there and if you don't then just ask a computer programmer or expert and they will know exactly what to do!<br>  <br>   <br>              HOPE I HELPED!!!!!!!!!!!!

First of all don't be "tempted" or what to those who only copy and paste infos about antivirus.. anyway, i'm one of the guys who is so much interested to know which is which to be the best anti virus.. honestly, i've downloaded a lot of them, TRIALS, DEMOS, AND free anti virus.. even though those "never heard" antivirus.. so i would compare each of them :<br>  <br>  AVAST 4! HOME EDITION - this one is a free software.. this antivirus has cool graphics and also have some voice recordings(you'll find out) that makes it unique. Of course it can detect viruses and it can delete and eliminate viruses. In terms of loading, its quite slow when you're using a slow or old computer.. you shuould be using at least with high memory of disk space.<br>  <br>  AVG - a lot says that AVG is the best.. lol.. they would say because they are not yet victimized by those antivirus that are new nowadays.. of course, technology is growing, so expect that virus nowadays are not that easy to remove or even detect. AVG for me could detect and eliminate virus, quite fast in scanning, but couldnt detect specific viruses and other virus with file name "exe", those softwares that you would think that that is not a virus, but probably, it would be a virus when you delete them and would come back again when you refresh your pc. So it's up to you to test this antivirus.<br>  <br>  AVIRA ANTIVIR FREE EDITION - before, i said that it was so effective.. yah, it's very effective but only in detecting but not in removing.. so what would you choose, to detect only or to remove only? neither... of course it could delete viruses, but not all, so probably its not the best!! and you would say that sometimes, it detects false programs, meaning, programs that are not virus are still being detected, and of course, your step is to delete that.. but if that's an important file?anyway, just test it if it could delete some specific viruses.. ^^, what's good with this is that it can detect viruses instantly at download.com(don't you know that most of the files in that website contains virus) now you know..<br>  <br>  BITDEFENDER 10 - poor one.. i dont see any interest features with this antivirus, it couldnt even detect some common viruses, it only last for me for a day, and i uninstall it because, i dont see any intersting features with it.. that's my opinion, its for you to find out. Avira is better in detection but bit defender couldnt detect some, so at least you see the comparison between. UNfortunately, avira is sometime false.<br>  <br>  CLAMWIN - hmm, i would say that it's a very poor antivirus, even though you could transfer it with other pc..that';s the only feature i've found in clamwin. its for you to find out if it could detect or delete viruses.. and it's so slow to scan..<br>  <br>  KASPERSKY - hmm, kaspersky is somewhat good, but couldn't detect some virus too, it could eliminate but it not all. another thing, it's somewhat slow when scanning.. A lot of processes are running while scanning so it may also slow down your pc.<br>  <br>  MCAFEE- compared to Avira, avira is still better in DETECTING viruses, before, while im using MCAFEE< it only detect 29 virus, but when i;m using AVIRA< about 300 virus was detected, and what as ive said, "maybe" some of them are not true, BUT MAYBE all of them are true, but you dont have the 100% guarantee that your pc is free from virus.. one more, it also has many processes hat wud slow down your pc.!<br>  <br>  PANDA - panda is quite better because it could also dtect spyware not only virus, and could also eliminate virus, and fast in scanning your FULL DRIVE, very fast.. but what is bad is that, you need to pay after 30 day trial.. of course, they would not offer you free but for me, as of now, i would rate it 7.5 out of 10.. try it if you want.. your pc may also be slow because it has some processes that slows down pc..PANDA is Effective in deleting Autorun.inf ...Try if you like to..Panda is effective, but not that effective.<br>  <br>  RISING ANTIVIRUS - the best antivirus in terms of its cool designs, its like new tech design, but unfortunately, its too slow to scan your pc!! very!!, i can finish a full scan in my pc because it takes so much time.. but it could detect some viruses, so its up to you to try if it is effective even though its slow! ^^<br>  <br>  NORTON - dont believe.. yah, it may be an anti virus but one time, it would also be a PRO virus, because, NORTON also produces virus(sometimes, but not at all).. so for me, I would not take the risk, even though its not true.. <br>  <br>  NOD32 - gud in detecting, fast in detecting if viruses attack your pc, but sometimes, like AVG, it couldnt detect specific viruses or "SOFTWARE VIRUSES", which is for me, the hardest virus to delete in PC..<br>  <br>  NOOB KILLER - this one, it could REALLY delete SPECIFIC VIRUSES such as Ravmon.exe, jaymyka, vundo, etc.. It's made from philippines,in my country.. haha.. anyway, it could only DELETE and 100% DELETE only SPECIFIC VRUSES, so dont use it if you dont have that kind of virus.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  |`|cCW2FTUIaa	avg   <a href="http://free.avg.com/" rel="nofollow">http://free.avg.com/</a>

Put that in and run it, see if it can diagnose what's going on.<br>  <br>  It sounds like it may just be a setting in the mouse that needs to be adjusted (which you can do with the software installed) but it could also be that the mouse is defective.<br>  <br>  If you can't get it working then I would recommend that you go to the Logitech website and email customer service for some help.  I had to do that a few months ago because my G7 started acting loopy and they were fantastic to deal with.  They did not make me jump through a million hoops, they simply had me email them a copy of the receipt, then they overnight couriered me a brand new one.  Excellent customer service I must say.  The mouse was 2.5 years old and I had no idea until they told me so that it was under a 3 year warranty, they could have kept that information to themselves but did not.<br>  <br>  So my point is that if it isn't a setting issue then just contact them and they will help you resolve the issue or immediately replace the mouse for you.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.

Even in America it is completely legal to use bit torrent.  If the protocol is used illegally then it becomes a crime (IE infringing on copyright).  Think of like a gun, used correctly its legal but used illegally and then that's where the crime lies.  As long as the content your linking to is legal then your golden.

In fact, I think it likely that CD-RW drives will replace CD-R drives as prices come down and the technology matures. The reason is simple: the CD-RW drives don't cost a lot more than CD-R drives, they have the ability to write CD-R disks just like CD-R drives do, but they also can write CD-RW media. Therefore, they have more capabilities and really, no drawbacks compared to CD-R, other than a small amount of cost.<br>  <br>  The media is a different matter. I do not think that it is likely that CD-RW disks will replace CD-R disks, for several reasons:<br>  <br>      * Cost: CD-RW media is significantly more expensive than CD-R media. In time the cost of the two types of media may approach each other, but for now they are far enough apart that this is a factor.<br>      * Compatibility: CD-R disks are compatible with most existing audio CD and CD-R players. CD-RW disks are not. This is a major factor, because a big part of the allure of CD-R is compatibility with existing CD players.<br>      * Permanence: Many of the applications of CD-R actually have the non-rewriteability of the disk is a requirement. For software distribution, historical archiving, and similar applications, the creator of the disk normally doesn't want it to be erasable.<br>  <br>  For these reasons, CD-RW is often said to "complement" CD-R, instead of replacing it. Since the drives support both media, users have a choice of which they wish to use. One common application is the use of a CD-RW disk for testing out the creation of a disk. Since it is rewriteable the disk isn't wasted in the event that the user omits a file by accident or whatever. The disk can be developed using a single CD-RW, and once perfected, burned onto regular CD-R, greatly reducing the number of "coasters" created by accident.<br>  <br>  It should also be noted that both CD-R and CD-RW are still just becoming reasonably commonplace on the market, and DVD is gaining quickly behind them. As DVD advances it is quite likely that many buyers will skip both recordable CD formats in favor of DVD-RAM, the rewriteable version of DVD. Only time will tell on this score, of course.|`|VMXtW6lnaa	Data-use either<br>  Music-use cd-r
DjGEJfaPaa	Kaspersky is the best all-round anti-virus program. NOD32 is just as good if not better, it runs faster and has less software conflicts but may be more difficult to use.<br>  <br>  Recent tests prove Kaspersky and NOD32 are better than the best sellers Norton and McAfee (av-comparatives.org). Norton is notoriously bloated and takes forever to perform full systems scans.<br>  <br>  Trend Micro Antivirus is a viable alternative if you're having a lot of trouble with software conflicts. Trend Micro rounds out the top three. BitDefender is very good as well, but gives a high number of false alarms. <br>  <br>  The most popular free anti-virus programs (AVG and Avast) have poor detection rates (82.82%, 87.46% respectively). If you want a free anti-virus Avira has higher detection rates than AVG or Avast! (94.26%).|`|W8D3Ki5eaa	I recommend ESET NOD32 Antivirus <a href="http://www.nod32.com.sg/html/44/42/" rel="nofollow">http://www.nod32.com.sg/html/44/42/</a><br>  <br>  Don't use Kaspersky, slow down your computer!, my friend use  kav5, kav7 also kav9, same problem, computer slow, then I ask him move to NOD32, the problem sovled. NOD32 is a lightweight design software, so it requires less system resources, also run very fast.

I'll have a look and compare the good ones."<br>  <br>  Yahoo AS! only provides detection and protection against spyware. If you need to detect and clean a virus, you'll need a dedicated Anti-Virus program.<br>  <br>  My vote would be for Nod32. It has one of the best on-demand detection rates while also having the best proactive (new "wild" viruses) detection compared to the other major software available. Proactive defense are always ignored, but imo, this is a critical feature for all-around anti-virus protection. AV companies are always playing "catch-up" with viruses. New viruses are created every day, but AV software can only detect them once they analyze a sample and add it to their virus definitions.<br>  <br>  Nod32 is also very "memory friendly" compared to Norton & Mcafee, so it wont slow down your computer. It's geared more towards "computer savy" users, but their new interface is much more "average user friendly".|`|H0gEUeNjaa	Try one of this Kaspersky Internet Security <a href="http://www.kaspersky.com/kis_latest_versions" rel="nofollow">http://www.kaspersky.com/kis_latest_vers...</a> <br>  ESET NOD32 Antivirus Antivirus protection is spelled "NOD32."

Simple layout, which even the most basic of users can navigate. Incredibly fast scanning, with a 90% detection rate. Not as easy on the eyes as other AVs, and you need to know what you're doing to get the more advanced features, but it is definite a candidate:<br>  <a href="http://www.free-av.com/en/download/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.free-av.com/en/download/index...</a><br>  <br>  Personally I use AVG, but only because I go for looks.

There are also FREE reg cleaners offered at Majorgeek.com. <br>  <br>  Thus, I would NOT pay for Regcure, nor even try the freebie version. <br>  <br>  You should also look at MaximumPC's note on RegCure:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.maximumpc.com/article/watchdog/is_regcure_legit" rel="nofollow">http://www.maximumpc.com/article/watchdo...</a>|`|AA10146029	depends. if youve had ur computer is really old or you have many programs, that could be normal. if its brand new with no programs, then obviously thats not normal. see if you can clean  with the scanner and see what happens. but if you gotta pay, some programs add extra stuff for you to say "o no!! this is a problem, let me buy the product"<br>  <br>  the best registry cleaner is CCleaner (formally known as CrapCleaner. its really good and i use it alot. also, if you wanna make ur computer faster and defrag ur registry, use this: auslogics Registry Defrag. it improved my computer speed by like 20%. both stuff are free and downloads are in sources.|`|drqw3sdzaa	and to clean them they want you to buy, don't you get it!!|`|20LnuCejaa	Those are what you call false positives.

It is free and works reliably well.|`|8xJh4JZoaa	hey dont orry thats normal<br>  try ccleanerelse doing defrag reularly is best<br>  any way u were working fine before check <br>  so keep cool and coninue as it is|`|LFJeZH7Saa	Souns like a scam to convice you to buy them, go online google regseeker, download it and ru n auto clean, this will clean everythign up FOR FREE!|`|16da4144ec72014f56f26ffb198e10b3aa	Yes this is fairly normal if you have had your computer for a while. Your computer looks at the registry during start up and shut down (so if there are errors these processes will often take a while), as well as while you run tasks and programs. It can help fix a lot of computer errors if you are experiencing any, and can also help speed up your computer some. However, I would recommend going for a free solution such as Glary Utilities, it is totally free no strings attached no ads, I use it for all of my clients, it has a lot of great free tools one of which is a registry cleaner:<br>  <a href="http://www.glaryutilities.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.glaryutilities.com/</a><br>  <br>  Also, as the other guy mentioned, CCleaner is a GREAT program as well that I also use often:<br>  <a href="http://www.ccleaner.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.ccleaner.com</a><br>  <br>  Glary Utilities has quickly risen to the top of the list of System Utilities on MANY large sites. It can also defrag your registry, fix registry errors, clean up your hard drive (ccleaner is probably better at this one), manage all of the programs that start up with your computer in the background (very helpful), as well as a few other tools that may be helpful to some - all for free.

0KRdh6Dcaa	i have a 250w and i use a video card that requires 400w. It works fine, but when i play cod4 for like 2 or 3 hours my computer shuts down|`|AA10146029	well, first of all, the worst that can happen is failure within the PSU. its like asking 250 men to do the work of 350 men. it overworks it and overtime, will get tired and break. and if you ever think about upgrading in future, why not just get a 600w PSU and call it good? having more than what the card needs is sometimes good because it can work at its full potiental. also, some people think that a 1000w PSU uses all the 1000w at that time. but if you computer is only using 500w, that extra 500w isnt gonna be on youre electricity bill. but be advised, getting a 1000w psu or higher is cutting the limits on how much a AC outlet is used to produce.|`|biF7sad1aa	You'll either draw too much current and the power supply will cut out, or it may work but will get hot and overheat.<br>  A 350W power supply is small by today's standards.

AA10146029	mostly, its people that say that it needs more resources then xp, at least me and my freinds who play video games it drops how the game can perform because vista uses more of the memory and stuff. but other than that, its pretty nice. but with UAC turned off, its a relief. but the other thing i really hate is the DEP. i didnt know how to turn it off so few things i did, vista wouldnt allow it to run because it thought it was a "virus"<br>  <br>  but windows 7 is gonna be like vista, but less memory consuming|`|DcUoZntOaa	i like it also, it just has a few bugs just like all os when they come out. i think it's great! it has very user friendly features!|`|3uuLZrbIaa	Many people's problem is with the release of Windows Vista.

Many people did not like the fact that a bubble kept on popping up saying "Are you sure you want to do this?"  (Despite the fact that it's now fixed).<br>  <br>  Many people also just don't want to change, after being used to XP for so long.<br>  <br>  I prefer Windows Vista over Windows XP, but I don't have the money to purchase Windows Vista, nor do I have a good computer (lol), so XP does good for me.|`|uiUmQzQSaa	I agree.

Go to My Computer-click on your C drive-windows-system 32-drivers-etc-right click where it says hosts- go to properties and right click to make this file read only. When people put spyware on your computer they are getting to this host file and since the file is not read only they can do whatever they want to it!

If so then you have a mismatched speed or module type.<br>  somewhere in this answer is the soltion to your problem.|`|IPYwgB6eaa	Maybe the ram is not compatible with your computer.|`|JtuvhVr3aa	you will find if you take the 512 out the 1gig will work your board will not take the 2 by the sounds.....

FMqmUAjiaa	The "Blue Screen of Death" is a generic term for an operating system error. It could be a number of things. If you have customer support for you computer, they can diagnose the problem, otherwise you will probably need to reinstall your operating system or possibly replace a hard drive. <br>  <br>  Your computer screen issue is probably a magnetic problem. Try to move the computer to another location to see if it changes anything, if not, did you press against it?|`|AA10146029	if anything is too close to screen like speakers, it will cause the magnets to not display right. so move the speakers or anything else with magnets in it away. also, try looking at both plugs on monitor and computer to see if its not loose.|`|AA10989804	Not sure about the tint.<br>  <br>  The Blue Screen of Death happens when something takes places and Windows (Operating System) doesn't know what to do. It could be anything from a bad driver to a broken hard drive. You need to know the code on it.

SE8jSxAGaa	No. <br>  Imagine your hard disk as a filing cabinet. You make a file called hello and delete it the default way, it just removes the hello name from the list, but the folder and the stuff in it is still there. These won't be removed untill you pull the paper out and put it in the shredder.<br>  There is loads of software out there that can sniff out files you delete. <br>  You can use file shredder software that deletes the file and overwrites it 7 or 35 times with random 1's and 0's, but some programs can still find it even after that. <br>  The best, but the most paranoid way to remove files form a computer is to put your laptop in a mircowave, or pull the magnetic disk out of the drive and smash it into little pieces.|`|AA10146029	there are certain ways to get it back, but no, its not gone forever.

And will not stress the video card to their limits.<br>  <br>  As for the processor, you need at least a 2.4Ghz dual core (Pentium D's don't count in this.). It's because since these video cards perform the best in high resolution, having a slow processor would negate the video card since the game will still be too slow in a high resolution gameplay.<br>  <br>  PS. Try looking at the Radeon 4850. Whichever is cheaper buy it. They have similar performance.|`|Nr8xP6Tuaa	As long as the rest of your system is capable of keeping up, you bet it is. Both the radeon 4850 and 9800GTX+ are awesome performing cards for the money (they both win over each other in different bechnmarks, but overall the 4850 is slightly faster and has the advantage of drawing less power and being quieter)<br>  <br>   Unlike waht the other guy says, don't even consider a GTX280 unless you have more money then you know what to do with :P its only a bit faster then the radeon 4870/GTX 260 (core 216) which are both significantly cheaper

The entire reason routers have a reset button is so that you *don't* have to go to the trouble of bruteforcing your way into your own network.<br>  <br>  It shouldn't take you more than 5 minutes to get your router back up and running. You can do it in 60 seconds flat if you can use DHCP. It's really not very much of an inconvenience, so I don't understand why everyone is so resistant to it.

Remember when talking about computer issues, everyone needs to understand that memory and hard drive space are two different things. <br>  <br>  From your question, it sound like you have 512MB of RAM. That has to do with the temporary memory on your computer. Hard drive space is what allows you to store stuff on your computer. The average size is 200GB. That's why you've been able to download video. <br>  <br>  When you approach the limit,  your computer will start running slow. At this point, you need to start deleting stuff you don't need, or get another hard drive.|`|uS8nNpB8aa	Your memory is fine... the thing you need to worry about is the amount of space on your hard drive... under My Computer right click the hard drive icon and then go to properties.

zorYTX59aa	Several times each day, YouTube shuts down a few of their <br>  servers to update stuff. Be patient if YouTube is slow, stuck<br>  or mangled. Transmissions from YouTube to your computer<br>  are done in multiple tiny packets of data and flash at a time. <br>  That's why sometimes you may get any of these scenarios: <br>  bits and pieces of text/thumbnails in weird places; sluggish<br>  loading/buffering; the spinning circle going on forever; or the<br>  player being blank. This problem could fix itself within a few <br>  hours or by the next day.<br>  <br>  If your YouTube continues to behave slow, stuck or strange,<br>  it's very possible that your directories of "temporary internet <br>  files" and RAM (sometimes known as "cache") are close to<br>  the maximum and just cannot take anymore, the end result <br>  being any of the above scenarios or videos that: A) come to <br>  a complete freeze; B) start/stop/start/stop in a choppy way; <br>  or C) never even make it onto your screen.<br>  <br>  "Temporary internet files" are tiny bits of webpages that get <br>  permanently put on your hard-drive. They will remain forever<br>  on your computer, gradually plugging it up like hair stuck in <br>  a sink drain, until you finally get rid of them once and for all. <br>  Thus, exit out of YouTube, then clear your "cache" of all its<br>  "temporary internet files", "cookies" and "history". It is best<br>  if you shutdown and reboot afterwards. You'll be amazed at <br>  how "fresh" and "new" your YouTube will be.<br>  <br>  If you're not sure how to delete your "cache" or if you would<br>  like more "tips" on making YouTube run even better without <br>  having to buy/install a thing, then please click on my avatar <br>  and send me a message -- with your YouTube username or<br>  email address. I will guide you step-by-step in plain English <br>  and with full explanations.<br>  <br>  Note 1: if you have got Google Web Accelerator or software<br>  similar to it....dump it, burn it, trash it, disable it, uninstall it; <br>  -- do everything you can to get rid of it. Not only does GWA<br>  totally conflict with and destroy YouTube, clicking on "Don't<br>  Accelerate This Website" won't help you whatsoever.<br>  <br>  Note 2: longer-running videos require both "Shockwave" and<br>  "Flash" to play smoothly. You don't need anything else.<br>  <br>  Note 3: a strange fix that once worked for me was changing<br>  the website URL from "www.youtube.com" to "youtube.com"<br>  (or you could even try "ca.youtube.com").<br>  <br>  Note 4: depending on the way your account was first set up, <br>  your "video playblack quality" might be telling YouTube that <br>  your internet connection speed is set to either "dynamic" or <br>  "fast" -- which makes YouTube play videos at higher quality. <br>  This in turn eats up a lot of bandwidth, memory and "cache". <br>  If you are "signed-in" on YouTube as you are looking at this<br>  answer, you can actually check your "VPQ" from right here <br>  within Yahoo!Answers by clicking my link just below, which <br>  will take you right to "YOUR VERY OWN" playback setting:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/account#playback/quality" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/account#playback/...</a><br>  Otherwise after you "sign-in", click the 4th black option that<br>  will be on the left side, called "Playback Setup".<br>  <br>  Note 5: nothing about playing YouTube videos has changed <br>  in the past 2 years. If anything, the newer Flash players are <br>  causing many YouTubers a whole lot of grief, especially the<br>  5 versions of Flash 10. It is absolutely farcical that there's a<br>  10.0.525, 10.1.218, 10.2.26, 10.2.54 and 10.12.36. Updates <br>  are typically good for one thing: software/computer conflicts.<br>  I've never strayed away from 9.47, and many flashers swear<br>  by 9.45. Think of them as XP compared to Vista.

I never use them, and I never get a virus(for six years now) Two Anti Virus programs running at once is worse than a virus itself(they can be removed) even if you repaired your computer to a working state, you would still have constant problems.

The micro program setup by windows installer is still running the boot as installation-in-progress.<br>  <br>  The boot sector is the first sector on a floppy disk or it is the first sector of a hard disk partition. It contains vital information about the disk or partition, such as the number of sectors and a micro program.<br>  <br>  When the PC starts up or boot-up, it will attempts to read the boot sector of a disk in drive “A”. If it fails to read drive “A” or because there is no disk, it will attempts to read the boot sector of drive “C”. When a boot sector is attack by virus, it will replace this sector with its own private code and generally will relocate the original boot sector elsewhere on the disk.<br>  <br>  Even a non-bootable floppy disk has executable code in its boot sector. This displays the "not bootable" message when the computer attempts to boot from the disk. Therefore, non-bootable floppies can still contain a virus and infect a PC if it is inserted in drive “A” while the PC is in a bootable stage.<br>  <br>  FDISK /MBR will not change the code in a hard disk boot sector (as opposed to the partition sector).

hXHBm1BSaa	A network cable will not connect to a phone jack. You must have a modem or router connecting your existing machine to the broadband. Either connect to this instead of connecting the pc, or use a router to connect both machines. And be careful, phone voltages are much higher (50v to 90v) than network (3v to 5v).|`|dYQUQGflaa	Most laptops come with an ethernet and a phone jack so you should try the phone jack first.

Since you are asking about phones, I am assuming that you receive your internet via a DSL line (over the phone lines).  In order for the internet signal to be separated out, you need a DSL modem.  Since you have internet, it can be assumed you also have a DSL modem.  That is what should be plugged into the wall and then an ethernet cable runs from the modem to your pc.<br>  <br>  In order to split the signal from the modem you will need either (1) a router or (2) a hub.  The former would allow you to also connect wirelessly (assuming it is a wireless router).  The latter would only allow you to connect via a hard wired cable.  You can pick up a router for under $100.00 and it will allow you to share the internet connection.  Assuming your new laptop has a wireless card in it you would probably find that more convenient.|`|1422614376bd2aaa1c3c2bd0bf16d2deaa	You can connect the Ethernet cable into the free ethernet port of Modem (either ADSL or Cable).

Your phone jack is completely different from an Ethernet port. One is only for phone chords/extensions and one is for high speed internet (which is provided by a company i.e Verizon, optimum). You are probably talking an Ethernet port from a modem or router that you have, in that case yes you can connect it directly. If you are thinking of putting the Ethernet cable straight into an actual phone jack, well it just isn't going to fit. Are you using dial-up? If you are then most laptops have a port for a phone line to use dial up. You will have to check the laptop yourself. All laptops have an Ethernet port and there is no adapter that i have heard of to make a Ethernet cable fit into a phone jack. If you don't already have high speed internet i suggest you get it otherwise you will be stuck with slow (really slow) internet connection from dial up companies (i.e aol). Hope this answers your question.|`|AA11811364	Keep on dreaming...  What you need is an internet service provider to connect you to the internet.

Give your computer more RAM and it will run great.  Virtual memory is very slow.  What virtual memory is, ok by default windows reserves part of your hard disk for virtual memory.  most of the time it is 1 1/2 times the RAM in your computer.

If it isn't, you'll need to buy a wireless router.|`|laofAjTAaa	comcast should have given you the connection details - you then need to connect to the router you kept accessing the admin console then enter the credentials and information, then this will simply replace the modem you got from comcast|`|yHI6rfeUaa	I laugh at the statement "I need an answer where I don't need to buy anything and simple".  What if you needed other components and it was a bit more difficult?  Don't ever restrict the answer beyond what is needed as it only makes you look foolish.<br>  <br>  In your case, luck is most likely on your side.<br>  <br>  Now we need to do some checking because there are variables that must be determined if we want to succeed.<br>  <br>  We assume that you have a dynamic public IP address.  If you have a static, you should have told us that.<br>  <br>  We do not know if ComCast is providing you a modem that is strictly a modem or if it is a modem / router / switch integrated into one box or if it is a modem / router / switch / wireless integrated in one box.<br>  <br>  If it is strictly a modem and they hand off an Ethernet signal, you will have a public IP address.  Open command prompt (start, run - type cmd in the box and hit enter).  At the > prompt type in "ipconfig" without quotes and hit enter.  You will be given the IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway.  Write these down.  <br>  <br>  If the IP is in the format 10.x.10.x where x usually is a 1 or if it is in the format 192.168.a.b where a is usually 1 or 0 and b is any number from 1 - 254,, you have a modem / router and probably a modem / router / 4 port LAN switch.  If this is the case, check and see if there is also a wireless access point integrated into this by calling comcast.  If it is a modem / router / switch / wireless you do not need your wireless router - just configure the Com Cast device as they direct in their directions.<br>  <br>  If it is a router / modem / switch without wireless you can plug your router into the circuit by linking a modem LAN port into your router WAN port provided the router's LAN port is not on the same subnet as is the Com Cast modem.  Before plugging it in, turn on router, connect it to your pc via a wired link and in Command Prompt, enter "ipconfig" and hit enter.  If the first 3 sets of numbers in the IP address do not match the first 3 of the IP address from above, then you are in luck.  Connect router, power down router, modem, and pc and then reboot all.  You should be working.  If however the IP address has the same first 3 sets of numbers, you MUST change the subnet of the LAN side on your router.  Log into the router via wired connection and change it as your manual states.<br>  <br>  If you fail to do the proper work as indicated above, you may have a conflict and service failure.  Things are not always the same as turning on a light switch and sometimes some research and configuration is needed.|`|iwIrQ4ncaa	what kind of router do you have??<br>  as someone has stated earlier, if it is a wireless router, then nothing is needed, just plug your router into your modem and BOOM..........you're good to go.<br>  if not, you'll have to buy a wireless router, either a 802.11 B/G or N|`|0GtonJONaa	if router compatible connect:internet>modem>router>pc's|`|AA10295089	Pour taco sauce on them
IGJGUfjNaa	There a several reasons why your computer is freezing. First question is when was the last time you cleaned your registry. Having a corrupted registry can cause a whole host of errors and problems. Freezing up is one of them. If you have a lot of unnecessary registry keys that are hogging up your computer resources. Your computer is bound to choke. Scan your registry with a good registry cleaner. If you pull up more than 20 errors or duplication, clean your registry.<br>  <br>  2. Depending on your RAM specs and your computer usage. This could also be a the issue. Having an insufficient amount of free space does not allow your RAM to function properly. If you are using a lot of RAM by net surfing or other activities without enough empty space your will get freezes. You don't need to buy new RAM but you should increase your free space by removing unnecessary data and perhaps increasing your virtual memory. The below link will show you how. <br>  <br>  3. Spyware could be the culprit, so do a scan and see if your computer is infected.   <br>  <br>  4. Another area is a hardware drivers. This could be the problem if new hardware has been added to the system. So, the drivers should still be up to date. So try the first two suggestion and see if you can get your computer to stop freezing.<br>  Check your drivers. <br>  <br>  5. Lastly, check the dust buildup on the fan to make sure you system is cooling properly<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.delete-computer-history.com/fix-computer-freezes.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.delete-computer-history.com/f...</a>|`|VPCl2C9daa	could be dodgy ram, take out the ram and then put it back in, this will be enough to reseat the contacts.

Then read the php and mysql manuals. and the W3schools is the best site for examples.

I would be tempted to do the following anyway just to be sure.<br>  <br>  Many viruses hide in folder, programs and files that are been used by the computer so Anti virus programs either cannot detect then or if they do they cannot delete them. Sounds like you could have a mixture of a virus and malware. Firstly you need to download Malwarebytes antimalware and TR (Trojan Remover) from the web (google them). Run both these in normal mode and delete anything found. Then restart the computer in safe mode (as the computer is starting keep tapping the F8 key) select start in safe mode and wait till it loads. Now run each of the programs in this order (NOT TOGETHER) TR and delete anything it finds, Malwarebytes and again delete what it finds, the run your Anti virus  and again delete what it finds. This should now leave you with a clean computer. By the way all the programs above are free, just google them. Hope this helps. Good luck. If you need further help then get back to me.|`|YOFh92Fqaa	Scan with the avira then download spybot search and destroy. Then do a scan. Spybot is a free anti -spyware program. Do a scan with that.

nFLz0PEAaa	<br>  <br>  FIRST STEP: <br>  When you open your laptop for the first time, a wizard-like program will lead you through the setting up of your account and registration, so don't think that you'll do all of that on your own.<br>  <br>  Internet:<br>  Go wireless, since it's a laptop, that only makes sense. If you have wireless at your home, there should be a little wireless switch on your laptop, that you should switch on. Then whe you get settled, you should locate networks, find the one that your home owns, and get the code/password, from whoever bought the wireless router. Make sure you save that one onto your laptop, so you don't have to constantly put in their password.I suggest you make sure your laptop is wireless accessible at first. but there are public places like Starbucks and college campuses  that provide free wireless, but i believe you need to get their code/password first.<br>  <br>  Microsoft: <br>  You will have to purchase Microsoft Office (Which include Word, PowerPoint, Excel, adn whatever one you want), you pick which type, I do not recomment XP, but 2003 is probably the most compatible, and probably the cheapest. Just follow the wizard to install the programs. If your laptop comes with it, there should be a microsoft sticker located underneath the laptop with a product key number. If you have MS Office installed, but the product key doesn't work, that means that it is just a trial, and you should buy MS Office-- Buying it implies buying a product key. I recommend purchasing it on Amazon, that's what I did with my laptop.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped.<br>  <br>  Mimi|`|UaAd2Mlaaa	GET A WIRELESS ROUTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  LINKSYS is the best!!!<br>  you dont always hafta plug it in it usually lasts 2 hours roaming<br>  you should order microsoft office while ordering the laptop you should be able to get it installed for you by the company<br>  if you cant get linksys get a wireless card for your cell phone company you'll have internet everywhere|`|GekytTPcaa	To answer your question, you can go to Wal-Mart, Best Buy or any store that sells computers and supplies to get Microsoft word, Excel, and Power Point.

For your internet problem you can go through your phone company and get the plug in for internet. I don't know what it costs but I don't think it would be wery much.

(You know, you memory stick thing?) Except it is attached directly to the CPU to make it all work together much faster.<br>  <br>  RAM Consists of BILLIONS of tiny "switches" on means one, off means 0.

fMtIEMNPaa	I assume you're running some version of Windows. I'll tell you how to do it in XP, but it should be pretty much the same for Vista and maybe 2000, NT, and 98. First off, try turning your monitor off and then on. If this doesn't fix it, try to calibrate the monitor. It should have an auto calibration feature. Mess around with the buttons/wheels on the monitor. <br>  <br>  If this doesn't fix it, try going to the desktop on the computer. Right click the desktop and click Properties. Click on the settings tab. See the slider labeled "Screen Resolution" or similar? Try adjusting that. It might be a menu or even buttons. If the screen goes black after you change it (and hit apply) don't do anything. There is a menu that says basically "Do you like it the way it is? If you don't do anything, it will go back how it was before". So, if the screen goes black, wait for 10 or 20 seconds to go back. Eventually one of the settings should work.|`|AA10146029	try changing back the resolution. on the screen, there should be a button that resets or autosets the screen. maybe ur screen doesnt have autoset so when you changed resolution, it stayed on screen. but yeah, look for a button on the monitor. if theres more than a few, try experimenting with them.<br>  <br>  goodluck|`|qTyQx37saa	right click------>goto properties-------->display settings------->adjust resolution. adjust colors to highest 32 bit.<br>  <br>  |`|nNGPsWbKaa	Well i know that my laptop use to have Sims2 but didnt have enough ram and it did the SAME THING.

These files tell the computer or laptop how to operate the software installed on the system. If any of these files get messed up, the computer is not sure what to do and this will really slow down the computer. The other scenario is where you download other software, screensavers, pictures, videos, or even music, and this will somehow change the settings on a registry file. When this happens, the original program that needs that file now has the wrong instructions in it.

RjwyRrxtaa	If your computer always restart, There are some reason:<br>  I. It's Hot in There<br>  Sometimes this can be caused by an overheating situation. Itunes, RealPlayer, Windows Media player,etc. require a lot of processing power to decompress and decode music files, which can cause the processor or hard drive to get hot.<br>  Memory Fails Me...<br>  If you determine that overheating is not the problem, the most likely suspect is bad memory.<br>  II. Don't Do Me Any Favors<br>  There's a setting buried in Windows XP that tells your computer to restart when a system error occurs. you turn off that option, you may solve your automatic reboot problem. <br>  1) Click Start, then open Control Panel<br>  2) Click Performance and Maintenance<br>  3) Click System <br>  4) Click on the Advanced Tab<br>  5) Click Settings in the Startup and Recovery section<br>  6) Uncheck Automatically Restart in the System failure section <br>  Note that this may prevent the system from restarting, but it can also mask the true problem.<br>  The most common cause of computer restarting is a corrupt registry. <br>  Most likely your registry is bloated and overstuffed with an assortment of useless pieces of data. The operating system while running your computer has to pick its way through all this excess material. There will be bits of programs which were not completely uninstalled, parts of programs which were never completely installed, fragments of miscellaneous data, useless drivers, and a multitude of other bits and pieces.<br>  The answer is to clean your registry and remove all the material which is not needed.<br>  <a href="http://toptenantispyware.com/Clean_Up_Center.htm" rel="nofollow">http://toptenantispyware.com/Clean_Up_Ce...</a><br>  Get the best one, and completely clean your windows registry with a few clicks of the mouse.<br>  <br>  III.

2SSA9e9Naa	If nothing has to be done more than once, then yes.<br>  <br>  If it something has to be repeated then you will have to use a loop. Either the classic for, while, etc. type of loop, or use recursive calls among functions to repeat something. Doing recursion is a type of looping but probably not directly what you were thinking of with this question.|`|hXHBm1BSaa	Yes, but it is hard work, and normally makes the program too slow for sensible use. You would need to manually need to write enough lines of code to test every possible condition, sometimes this could be thousands.|`|AIvUIn1baa	Depends.  Loops add processing time to a program, but usually they are needed.  If you look up "Big O notation," you will find that as the data source for processing increases in size, the processing time of loops can be troublesome.<br>  <br>  But it can be done.  Example:  Six times six can be written as a loop that adds 6 six times.  This will be more inefficient than writing a single statement that multiplies by 6.  If you have a solid formula that eliminates a loop, you should use it.  But not all loops can be removed.|`|9oUjkn8gaa	In some cases you can get a simple formula to replace a loop. But not all the times!|`|Pm6rM9e2aa	why?<br>  <br>  use lots of goto:  in your codes if you don't like loops/cycles :)|`|2tOItAXJaa	It depends on what you need to do in your program!  <br>  <br>  In actuality no!|`|GVD4DOMeaa	Well, yes, you can create a program without using loops, but you are very limited in what you can make - loops are necessary for some things, and very useful in general programming.<br>  <br>  Also, as far as I am aware, I can't think of any programming languages which do not have the option for loops (if that was what you were asking)<br>  <br>  Hope that helps|`|bSmYRsQKaa	off course YES

naQIUdX0aa	1. The corresponding WAP for each specific client.<br>  2. Based entirely on the information provided the corresponding WAP for the specific client. This is definitely a practical design in many ways though.<br>  <br>  3.I don't really understand what this is asking considering the use of NAT which will take care of local to wan address translation.<br>  <br>  4. The servers addresses should either be excluded from the DHCP range or added as reservations.<br>  <br>  5. In the given scenario the corresponding WAP.<br>  <br>  6. This can be derived from the DNS servers provided by the ISP on the WAPs or by finding a third parties DNS server.<br>  <br>  7. The only way that this is possible is to add a switch to one of the WAPs.<br>  <br>  8. This can be done by ensuring that their DHCP scopes don't overlap one another.<br>  <br>  I am uncertain as to the reason why this particular design was chosen but conceptually it would lead to numerous headaches as far as management. Here is what I would suggest.<br>  <br>  1. A single Router to handle all three internet lines that exist onsite.<br>  2. 3 24-port switches to handle all necessary wired connections.<br>  3. The 3 wireless access points for wireless access.<br>  4. Disable DHCP on the wireless access points and let one of the servers handle DHCP.<br>  <br>  Network layout.<br>  <br>  ISP lines connect to the router, the router connects a primary switch, servers connect to the primary switch as well as the WAPs.
t5sYXwSqaa	Try any of these free antivirus AVG, Avira, Avast or Comodo. You can download by googling any.<br>  <br>  Many viruses hide in folder, programs and files that are been used by the computer so Anti virus programs either cannot detect then or if they do they cannot delete them. Sounds like you have a mixture of a virus and malware. Firstly you need to download Malwarebytes antimalware and TR (Trojan Remover). Run both these in normal mode and delete anything found. Then restart the computer in safe mode (as the computer is starting keep tapping the F8 key) select start in safe mode and wait till it loads. Now run each of the programs in this order (NOT TOGETHER) TR and delete anything it finds, Malwarebytes and again delete what it finds, the run your Anti virus and again delete what it finds. This should now leave you with a clean computer. By the way all the programs above are free, just google them. Hope this helps. Good luck.

Well because you have 2 borrowed bits.<br>  <br>  if you make a table like this:<br>  128  64  32  16  8  4  2  1  <br>  you borrow the 2 bits <br>    *     *<br>  128  64  32  16  8  4  2  1  <br>  <br>  128 + 64 = 192<br>  <br>  Why 256? Well because you can get up to 256 usable hosts.<br>  <br>  meaning your IP ranges will be like this<br>  <br>  192.25.128.0<br>  192.25.128.64<br>  see the magic number? Now the address before the other subnet (first subnet is 0, second is 64, 3d subnet is 128 and so on) is your broadcast address for that range of valid hosts. The valid hosts are just the numbers in between your subnet address and your broadcast address<br>  <br>  Example:<br>  192.25.128.0 | 192.25.128.1 - 192.25.128.62 | 192.25.128.63<br>  192.25.128.64 | 192.25.128.65 - 192.25.128.126 | 192.25.128.127<br>  192.25.128.128<br>  <br>  and so  on and so on until you hit 192.25.128.255 which is your final broadcast address.<br>  <br>  The valid address you can use are the ones in the range inside the | |<br>  <br>  Subnetting is essential for networking.<br>  <br>  Here you got some useful links:<br>  <br>  www.learntosubnet.com<br>  <a href="http://www.jrksoftware.com/subnetting.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.jrksoftware.com/subnetting.ht...</a><br>  <a href="http://subnettingquestions.com/" rel="nofollow">http://subnettingquestions.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subnetwork" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subnetwork</a>

kAi14kKxaa	It speeds up almost everything.<br>  <br>  Traditionally hard drives would need to spin up and the hard drive head would also need to move to access the data stored on the drive.<br>  Since SSD contains no moving parts, copying/storing data becomes much faster, meaning that applications can be opened faster, and when booting up it takes less time for the OS to pre-load all the resources. <br>  <br>  How much faster it is compared to the normal 5400RPM drive depends on the quality of the SSD. On average the read/write speeds are 2x faster.<br>  <br>  However right now SSD drives are extremely expensive (a 64GB SSD would set you back at least $300 when for the same cost you could get a 1 terabyte drive) it's not really worth the upgrade.

2d1281aa57d4a1706e1d2a23da968188aa	According to the pictures and official specs from Fujitsu/Siemens, the D1740 motherboard doesn't have a dedicated video slot (either AGP or PCI-Express). That motherboard has only PCI slots, which severely limits your choices.  Most graphics cards available in PCI are old, obsolete models like the Radeon 9200 series and GeForce FX 5200/5500 cards, which are crap.  Even the best PCI graphics cards are very slow compared to cheap $50 AGP or PCI-E cards.<br>  <br>  However, the best cards available for PCI-only systems are:<br>  <br>  Radeon X1550<br>  <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814161227" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...</a><br>  <br>  Radeon HD 2400<br>  <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814131082" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...</a><br>  <br>  GeForce 8500GT<br>  <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814187059" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...</a><br>  <br>  GeForce 9400GT<br>  <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814187057" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...</a><br>  <br>  Look for one of those... No other PCI cards are worth buying these days.|`|PMrTleDJaa	Well there are two highly common types of graphic cards.  PCI and PCIexpress.  PCI express is the newer type of graphic card slot.  It all depends on if your motherboard can handle the card and if your PSU (power supply unit) can support its needed connectors.  May I suggest asking some computer stores If your motherboard is an older one that is practically obsolete.

8boZSkEeaa	Well, aside from costs, the service has much higher latency (delay time) for data packets, so this could be an issue if you are into online gaming.<br>  <br>  Sometimes I find them to be problematic when connecting too, necessitating a computer reboot to resolve the issue. You don't usually have this issue with DSL.<br>  <br>  It is very good having the freedom to have internet anywhere you go though. Here in SA, we have some issues with internet in the office that I can't be bother to explain here, but my HSDPA connection 'saves the day' a couple of times a week.<br>  <br>  Here is a paste from an online source:<br>  <br>  Mobile broadband pros<br>  ? You can access the internet on the go wherever there’s a 3G signal – great for people who travel for business or leisure.<br>  <br>  ? Several providers offer pay-as-you-go options, so you don’t need to sign up to a monthly direct debit agreement.<br>  <br>  ? For low or infrequent internet users, pay-as-you-go mobile broadband can be a cheap, tie-in-free way to access the internet.<br>  <br>  ? Mobile broadband isn’t reliant on you having a home phone line, so there is no need to pay line rental.<br>  <br>  ? It’s a good option for people who may not need their own broadband service all year round – such as students or people in short-term lets.<br>  <br>  ? If you have a mobile phone service with the mobile broadband provider, it may offer discounts on the mobile broadband service.<br>  <br>  Mobile broadband cons<br>  ? With like-for-like usage, mobile broadband is more expensive than most fixed-line broadband.<br>  <br>  ? Mobile broadband speeds, usage caps and fair usage limits are fairly low compared to fixed line broadband.<br>  <br>  ? At the time of our user test, we found some customer service centres didn’t seem to be fully set up to deal quickly with mobile broadband queries and problems.<br>  <br>  ? Costs for exceeding usage limits and using mobile broadband overseas are prohibitive.<br>  <br>  ? Though you can use it on the go – on a train for example – the 3G signal can be sporadic.<br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...|`|1422614376bd2aaa1c3c2bd0bf16d2deaa	The pros will be that u will become complete wire free and can access the internet on moving (on laptop off course).<br>  The first bad thing with 3G service is higher cost packages. Even if u settle for a unlimited type connection than it will most probably cost you 5 times costlier then the DSL way.<br>  Second bad news is the costlier HSDPA modems.<br>  And last but not least is the slow latency.|`|jI6jOvjlaa	It can become really expensive ( USB modem) unless you get a good package but then you may as well get a fixed broadband as the packages are pay monthly.

With that said, see #2 below.<br>  <br>  Yes, EZ Antivirus is compatible with Windows Vista. It says so on their website.<br>  <br>  There are two possible reasons you're getting error:<br>  <br>  1) You do not have Administrator rights, therefore can't install new software, or<br>  <br>  2) Your computer is already infected with a virus which is preventing you from completing the install. I'm not familiar with this particular piece of software, but it may allow you to boot directly to the CD in order remove any viruses at that point.

ffqsWfZtaa	This feature is on newer laptops only, they put it on to prevent hard disk damage.<br>  <br>  A laptop drive can take a few G's shock when spinning ok but when stopped it can take hundreds of G's, enough to reduce maost laptops to a pile of broken plastic. so if the drive is stopped you could throw the laptop off a skyscraper, it would smash but your data would be safe.<br>  <br>  A laptop drive spins at 5400 rpm usually, the data heads fly a few microns above this surface, to much shock and the heads will touch the disk, damaging the heads and the disk surface and your data.<br>  <br>  Usually there is an option to set the protection sensetivity so you can reduce it a bit but I wouldn't turn it off. <br>  <br>  If you need to operate while jumping about you could get a solid state disk (not cheap yet).|`|GSE1JqAwaa	I'm not sure what will happen to your computer if you remove the file. But Hard drives a fragile pieces of equipment, and if your job is putting shock onto the hard drive like that, leave it alone and allow it to do its pausing thing. lol.<br>  <br>  But with out the ability to stop the hard drive and put it into "safe mode", you can actually start to damage the hard drive. Say if your doing something on there, defraging for the heck of it, and the disk is spinning, and there's a shock to the computer and it continues to spin, the read/write heads may actually damage the surface of the disk, or the heads themselves may get damaged.

I do have 2 though.<br>  <br>  #1 you could format your hard drive and reinstall the operating system.<br>  <br>  #2 right click on the desktop and click create shortcut. In the shortcut box type "shutdown -s" then click next or finish or whatever you need to do to finish it. If it works right you can double click it and it WILL shutdown your computer in 30 seconds.
kWxhWET7aa	One of the chief software project managers at Microsoft wrote a book called The Art of Project Management. In this book, he said that the best way to handle problematic programmers was to politely but firmly, and repeatedly if need remind them of who your are as project administrator. But, at the same time, you have to keep both of your ears as well as your entire mind open to their ideas. Just because you can put together an incredible design for an app doesn't mean you know ANYTHING about programming. The ultimate goal is to maintain a trusting friendly, but at the same time well understood Administrator / Programmer relationship.|`|uYMcGIKmaa	I think more information would be helpful, as far as what type of data you are referring to. Internal data (variables), External data (xml files, or databases), etc...<br>  <br>  First off, I think that establishing some coding guideliness can go a long way to ensure that data is handled correctly, and also that code is written / maintained properly as well.

t5sYXwSqaa	Am I correct in thinking you are running Vista on only 1GB. I am surprised it appears to be running as well as it is as 2GB seems to be about the min to run Vista. I would certainly upgrade to 2GB and higher if you can. Returning to your problem you say you turned UAC off that may have allowed higher privileges for Malware/Spyware and this would certainly slow your computer down. It may also be that by turning off the UCA you have given higher privileges to other programs that before had only a low level privilege. You can certainly run programs like Malwarebytes Antimalware (Free just Google it) and this should get rid of this problem. If you want to be absolutely sure run the same program in Safe Mode. I would turn the UCA back on but you will have to reassign the priority values again. Hope this helps

AA11622701	During a normal boot up, your computer will usually come up in a native "DOS" mode for displaying the manufacturer's logo, then go to a very low resolution screen for displaying the Windows logo, switch to a higher resolution to initially display the cursor and log on screen, then finally switch to the resolution that the person log in has as their preference.  So just with a normal log in you can go switch resolution several times.<br>  <br>  Almost any time you play a game, you switch resolutions for the game, then back to the preferred resolution when you exist.<br>  <br>  So most people will change resolutions multiple times in a normal day.

They are designed to do that.|`|1422614376bd2aaa1c3c2bd0bf16d2deaa	More resolution means more clarity and smooth view.<br>  Explain to your parents that on higher resolution they will get the best quality and view. If they have problem in higher resolution for small fonts and small screen icon then change the dpi settings of your desktop. Use different login for different user for using different settings for the desktop. <br>  Changing the resolution frequently can damage your monitor and graphics card (inside the PC and most probably on motherboard).|`|BsiGEZCWaa	No you can change resolution all day long, and it will probably not matter. I think LCDs might work better with this than an old one, but i own 9 computers and I have never broken a screen by changing resolutions.

fcae0285fd282f1f65104e24f38e8b60aa	depends. some softwares do good than other in zooming. But eventually all of them loose clarity. Its to do how the image file was created in the first place and what sort of compression was used.|`|AA12398411	Yeah, get iPhoto|`|581a2a1aebc45f18403518de3aacabd2aa	It depends on how far you are trying to zoom in, and the type of format the picture was loaded to the computer in.  If it was loaded with high resolution, you will be able to get nice results with microsoft pictures 7.0 or higher.  If the image was loaded with low resolution, then it will be very difficult to zoom in more than one or two clicks without losing resolution.  Is there a camera shop that you frequent that could help you determine how far in you can go? They might help you free of charge.  Good Luck!|`|AA10711189	Use Microsoft Magnifier for zoomin upto 16X. these is the best available solution. Programs->Accessories->Accessebility|`|AA11244961	I would think not unless the picture itself was taken with great clarity.  Pictures normally become pixellated because the quality of the photo is not extremely high.|`|AA11298105	Doubtful.  becasue the picture is made up of a set number of pixels.  once you zoom in digitally, you lose pixels.  If you get a high megapixel camera, this will not be as bad because no matter how much you zoom in, you will still have a lot of pixels.  this is why higher megapixel cameras, can produce huge prints - 8x10 and up at high quality.<br>  <br>  This is why Optical zoom is so much more important than digital zoom.  You do not lose quality using optical zoom.<br>  <br>  There are editing programs that help with quality as you zoom in.  Adobe Photoshop products are probably the best.  quality will still be lost but these programs can try to fix the sharpness and other qualities to provide a clearer picture.
