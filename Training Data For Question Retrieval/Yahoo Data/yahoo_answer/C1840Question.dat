I am working on a system where a user can update content in the database, to be shown on a webpage.      I have a table for users, and a table for the content of the website.

I need this to happen:  When a user logs into the system to edit their content, I want to secretly set their authorization code as a session variable along with their username and password.   When they go to the update form, the query executed is as follows:   "UPDATE Texts SET Text=$Text WHERE authorization_code=$_SESSION['authorizat...

In other words, the content is not being changed.      I think the problem may be in the registering the authorization code session secretly.  This is how I have it working, well... the lack thereof, now:   $stip=username=$_SESSION['username'];   $query="SELECT authorization_code FROM Texts WHERE $stip;   $result=mysql_query($query);   $_SESSION['authorization_code'] = $result      If you need more details, PLEASE TELL ME! I am on a deadline and I have no idea what to do!    THANK YOU VERY MUCH!!!!  Any and all help is appreciated.

You can post things, but I also wanted to make it more than just a forum, so I made it fun. There are 5 different teams you could be on, and you can choose which one you want to be on. There are contests for everyone to be in, and at the end, the "community" chooses a winner, and whoever wins gets a certain amount of points for their team. There is also a lot of other stuff you can do, but that's just a summary.      Anyway, what do you think? Does it sound interesting to you?       http://archuleta.conforums.com

So myspace users -- you may have noticed that when you want to customize your profile now, it won't let you customize it the old way.  I don't want the 2.0 version, but I wanted to change my current 1.0 version, but it won't let me customize it any more so I can't get rid of the stupid theme since it's not done with html graphics so I can't erase it and putting in other layout codes won't override it.

I set up a test ip on the server so I can do testing on some changes to my website.  I created a new ip and made it a subdomain of the main url.  but the links arent working   include_once( $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] ."lib/zorebo_common.php" );      There are several pages of code that have this include statement.  I need to tell the server that I moved the pages to another ip address so where do I do that?  I got this answer last time:   Most likely, the problem is that the server is not properly configured to report the true file path. Thus, $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] is giving a bad path to the file.

20090222213049AAN6Bwd	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	Which laptop combo would you choose? Losing hair over this!?	This is my current laptop. We'll call this LAPTOP A:  http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?...       This is potential laptop I may buy. We'll call this LAPTOP B:  http://www.newegg.com/product/product.as...       With my budget, my option is to either keep LAPTOP A, and buy an LCD HDTV (Samsung LN40650A), which supports 120hz and is GREAT for gaming and bluray watching which is what I'll mostly use this for. Getting for about $1200.      My 2nd option, is to buy LAPTOP B, and settle for a 32 inch Sony HDTV (32XBR6) which I'm getting for about $750. This is only 60hz refresh rate, and not as good as the other TV for gaming and bluray, and I do enjoy the automotion feature. HOWEVER, this nicer laptop has HDMI output, but my current laptop doesn't. *This is important for me because I want to run mkv files straight off my laptop and HDMI output to the HDTV, rather than having to sit there and convert the mkv files for a format that my PS3 can use.*      Sorry, I know this may have gotten a bit confusing, but what would YOU do? On one hand I get a nicer TV + 120hz for bluray and gaming, but NOT HDMI output.. on the other hand I get a 60hz decent TV but a nicer laptop. What d'y'all think?

20090222220519AA3plPq	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	My Fujitsu C1320D laptop won't turn on :(?	I left it on, on my bed, and fell asleep next to it. Woke up the next mroning, it was off, and not responding when I pressed the power button.       When I pull out the power plug and plug it back in a little batter icon flashes on the little screen above the keyboard, but that's about all the response I get.      Could this be a virus? Overheating?       This is my fourth year with it now. Did it just kick the bucket without saying goodbye?         I run it w/ the battery in but the battery's long been useless (doesn't charge up anymore). Dunno if this is relevant, just throwing it out there.         Help?

20060915203858AAOu4Ud	Computers & Internet;Internet	I'm looking for a comprehensive, step by step guide to backing up my files & data to removable media?	I'm running XP Pro on one PC and XP home edition on the other-they are networked. I've lost data more than once due to crashes. When I try to back up my files using the backup wizard, I never see (or it never shows me) the option to backup anywhere but to the drive itself or to a floppy (31/2in).That won't work, and neither will a CD Rom. Not enough space on either. What am I doing wrong- I don't want to lose any more data. Saving to the hard disc on the same pc is useless.  I've successfully saved the system files boot to a a floppy, (boot disk?) and that's as far as I seem to get. My goal is to save  Outlook, My documents, etc. as a backup, but on removable or external media-where I can restore it once the pc is back on line after a crash. Thanks-gc

20070530055001AA1b2yn	Computers & Internet;Internet;Other - Internet	In Australia, who's the best and cheapest Broadband/ADSL internet provider??	I'm currently with Telstra and they charge too much and the lower rate plans have too little downloads, it's pretty annoying, cos that means I have to pay more and I have heaps of extra downloads left over that I don't use.       I'm on the computer pretty much everyday, but I don't download much. I watch a lot of videos on YouTube, and download about 2 or 3 albums every week, apart from that I look at websites with a fair few pics. So, about 1 GB a month of downloads is good I guess.      CHEERS :)

Alomejor algun@ ya lo conoce, pero si no aqui os lo muestro.   Se trata de la web esfacil.net que te manda emails de publicidad y por cada uno que abras te va acumulando dinero.   Si te quieres registrar y empezar a ganar dinero entra desde aqui:      ATENCION A LOS EMAILS QUE OS MANDEN LOS TENEIS QUE ABRIR Y DARLE A CONFIRMAR, SI NO NO OS DAN DINERO.       http://www.es-facil.com/ganar/alta?Id=64...       No es ninguna estafa ya que tienes que pensar que lo unico que ellos hacen es que te mandan los emails de publicidad que previamente diversas empresas les han ordenado,   lo unico que hacen es darte a ti una parte de lo que ganan.      Para que ganes dinero tienes que abrir tu tambien los emails que te manden (atencion, selecciona todos los campos de interes al registrarte, asi te mandan mas)   Publicita esto tambien por emule, ares, lphant, etc... y pon tu ID en lugar de la mia; asi todos salimos ganando.      Saludos!!

Hola que tal, busco un buen programa,  que además fácil de usar preferentemente sean freeware (o GNU de perdida) y que soporte formato AVI, MPEG, etc para quemar una película en DVD y que lo pueda leer mi  reproductor LG para ver por la tele.   Bueno pues esto lo puede hacer el Nero Vision, ya lo sé, pero resulta que como uso Windows Vista me empezo a dar muchos problemas hasta que de plano el programa no quiso quemar nada y mejor lo desinstalé. Además, el paquete completo de nero trae chorrrocientos mil otros programillas que no uso y que ocupan mucho espacio.      Ya me cansé de probar cuanto programa encontré: DeepBurner, Totally Free Burner, jetbee,free disc burner, DVD flick y el que creo que tiene más potencial de todos el InfraRecorder, que no funcionó porque no soporta el quemador de mi laptop ( HL-DT-ST DVD+-RW GSA-T21N A102  en una Dell Inspiron 1525 ).   Ahora bien, aunque el Free Easy Burner de koyote software y el Burnaware free aceptan archivos AVI, el reproductor para tele no los acepta, y si antes convierto el archivo a .VOB pues tampoco porque el reproductor lo lee como mp3/wma o jepg y aun así no lee nada.      Porfavor alguien digame que tengo que hacer para quemar una película y verla en un reproductor que no sea el de una computadora.   Seguramente estoy haciendo algo mal o simplemente no hay un programa que fácil y rapidamente sea capaz de pasar a dvd cualquier archivo que no sea iso, vob, etc      Gracias.

After beginning to do all my initial installations, I am seeing that there is a D Drive and a C Drive. I personally have never seen this, but I just continued my installation process regardless.      However, what I am noticing is that my C drive is being used very minimally, and my D Drive is where everything is going on. I have about 90% free space in my C Drive, and about 5-10% free space in my D Drive.      Is there a way I can "switch" to start saving on the C drive? Is there a way to move files from the D drive to the C drive? What is the difference? Is the D drive just an added drive for added space, or is it a little more serious? Is my computer at risk for anything right now?      Thanks!

I have my desktop PC on a desk that is hooked up to my good speakers. About 20 feet away is a bar where I have my laptop. I want to be able to browse and play mp3s through my laptop that are stored on the desktop. I know you can do remote desktop or free online services that have remote desktop but I assume if I clicked on a file it would just play through my laptop correct? Even if I just had it on shared hard drives it would stream it instead of just playing it on the host.      Note that both PC's are on a wireless connection, and I could even get a crossover cable between the 2 if I wanted.
20080224151919AARVpNR	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Desktops	Pirates of the caribbean online crash problem?	Whenever I get off of a ship I see the loading screen and hear the sails but get disconnected from the server. I contacted their customer support and I was told the file ati2dvag.dll (they said it was my video card driver) needed to be the 2006 issue (it is currently the 2005 issue they said) And that is after having completely removed the ATI drivers from my system with the utility and manually. I also got the latest release of drivers for my video card.      So my question is why is the ati2dvag.dll file still showing up as the 2005 version (even after deleting it manually and reinstalling the latest drivers) and if possible how can I get a 2006 version. I am usually fairly self sufficient with stuff like this, but this has me scratching my head.      System specs:   Microsoft Windows XP   Professional   Version 2002   SP2      Registered to me   (string of numbers)      Computer:   AMD Athlon(tm) xp 2800+   2.08Ghz, 1.00GB ram      Video card is an ATI Sapphire Radeon 9600 Atlantis 256MB AGP8x

Hi, i've been having a problem with my laptop, its an alienware sentia m3450, its 2 years old but the battery on it its like 7 months old, so heres the thing, i fully charge the battery while having the laptop turned on, then when at 100% charged, i disconnect the power to use the laptop with battery power only, then when it goes down to like 80-85% charge left, it turns off, just like that, no alarms go off or warnings of critical battery or anything....   Theres also no heat problems, the laptop is always at a cool temperature so that leaves me very confused because i cannot use the laptop without having it connected to ac power...      If you know anything that could be done i'd really appreciate it      Thanks again         -fred

Went a little farther and looked at his Bios... it's not recognizing what kind of computer it is (HP DV6325us) and the UUID is showing all 0's also.  I tried a BIOS flash to a new bios and also to an old bios and still the same results.  Everything on the computer works great except for the NIC.  The system is running Vista Home with no modification as of yet.  Just to slow down the answer train, here's what I know the issue is not.     It's not the ARP table   The nic DOES work   The BIOS (tried 3 of them)      Any supersavy HP users found an answer to this... and I can't send it into HP, I'm deployed to Iraq and the shipping would be a nightmare.
