RaXCko4saa	the school has many benefits for the children more than education and get certificate , it helps children to build their communication skills, learn them how to be in a group , how to respect the different opinions and to meet and to deal with different characters.  in addition, the students know the importance and the meaning of time. they learn that every activity has it's time and that there is time for playing and time for studying . besides, the activites show their talents by being in the team of sport or music  or workshop of theater acting. School forms social person who can integrate into the society when s/he will work easily.  on the other hand, the online schools help student to get their certificates but they suffer of being alone and don't have opportunity to make friendship which is very important in their early age. so, they will be so serious but they have lack of self confidence because they don't practise social life. education is not every thing because we could learn by reading in books but being among friends and colleagues from the same age is an opportunity that we can never make up. in addition, being among other students helps in opening their minds because, in the class each student says his/her point of view, makes a specific presentation ,so, they learn from each other , which create of them well educated person , and flexible to the other opinions. moreover, some people and employers don't trust the certificates of online school, they think that these students are lesser competant than classroom students.|`|0Z5vabO5aa	Pros to online - students can work at their own pace, there isn't the pressure of competing with others in the room, it is a move in the direction of our technological future    Pros to classroom - students can work together in cooperative learning groups, teachers can verify that students are doing their own work, teachers are on site to provide immediate help|`|qh9EOXKOaa	I go to cyber school and it's awesome   Cyber School:  Pros- Takes 3-4 hours a day, You can work at you own pace, More One on One attention with the teachers, It fits into your schedule, You don't have to get up early, You don't have to go to bed early  Cons- You don't really talk to your teachers you IM, Have to be very responsible, Organized    Public School:  Pros-Your face to face with the teachers, They answer you questions faster, You get to interact with other people  Cons- You have to get up early, Go to bed early, Takes up 8 hours of your day|`|EmyPhT11aa	pros for online  you can concentrate better because there is no one to distract  you can set up your own work enviorment to fit your own needs    online cons  not having any social activity    classroom cons  you might not like the way the school is set up and can get stressed from finding classrooms  people can distract you    classroom pros  social activiy

Most state schools are less than what you can borrow from the federal goverment in Stafford loans in your name only without the parents help.  Stop thinking of them as a resource and go at it on your own, 21 is a good time to cut the purse strings.    Get a job or two... working around 30 hours a week to cover your living expenses and keep attending school full time.    If it were easy, everyone would do it and no one would need it.

6EOcwRkAaa	First, is the classroom or home setting?  "Fiddling with a hat" makes me think it is a home setting.     First, look at homework- make sure child is capable of doing the work and that it is not too much (rule of thumb: 10 min for each grade level ie. 4th grade no more than 40 min.) You want to make sure child is not going to be frustrated or feel overloaded.      Then, get a timer that shows the countdown. Kids love to 'beat the timer' - we use it for everything!  Divide homework into reasonable chunks of time- Maybe start with 5 min and work your way up to no more than 15 min. Then allow a break - maybe 10 min of video games. Then back to homework.  Be encouraging - find things to brag on - "love the way you put your video game up when the timer went off."     At first, don't worry about the quality of work (unless way below normal).  Talk with teacher and explain your focus is on time management to make sure he/she is also on-board.  As your child improves in completing work, then slowly start working on the quality.     Good luck!|`|mYhuGonfaa	Are you a teacher? You must understand that, first of all, she/he is a child! Set boundaries and stay on top of them.

727db85c0f71b3166d409ebf38b6ee35aa	In as much as your teacher is asking you to compare apples and oranges, you might want to consider turning the tables on him.  Your teacher gave you the assignment in a wholly misguided attempt to get you interested in this Saxon classic by having you equate it with a particularly unfortunate aspect of American popular culture.  You might want to think about pointing out that there are almost no valid similarities between Beowulf and American action film genre, and that such a comparison denegrates the former and inappropriately elevates the latter.  In fact, you might point out that at least three attempts have been made to turn Beowulf into an action movie in the last five years, and in each attempt, serious violence had to be done to the structure and plot of the saga in order to make it sufficiently entertaining as an action film.    For starters, the only thing the two have in common is that graphic violence occurs in both.  However, in Beowulf, the violence has purpose and is part of the overall message being subliminally communicated by the tale.  Everyone in the tale seems a pagan, but the characters do seem to possess virtues associated with Germanic Christian literary tradition.  Given that the Beowulf Saga was first recorded by Christian monks in the 12th century, one does have to wonder what the point of recording it was if not to reinforce Christian values over those of the pagans.  The violence in an action film is, on the other hand, almost always gratuitous and simply meant to entertain.     The Beowulf saga is probably a part of a larger oral tradition, and the tale is meant to inspire as well as to entertain.  The purpose of an action film is simply to get enough "butts in the seats" that the film makes money.  In other words, the action film is a mere commercial venture with no value, literary or otherwise, beyond short term profitability.  No values are being extoled and no virtues are being celebrated in an action movie, generally speaking.  On the other hand, the whole point of a story like Beowulf is to extol and celebrate particular virtues such as honor, courage and sacrifice.  (Although some might regard films like Saving Private Ryan as "action films", I do not, preferring to view films like that as part of an entirely different "war" sub-genre that is much more akin to the Beowulf tradition.)    The Beowulf Saga tells us rather a great deal about the pagan Scandinavian world view and about lord-vassal relationships in norse warrior society.  American action films tell us next to nothing other than that Americans, like the Romans before them, like to watch gratuitous violence.    Anyway, you get the idea.  Beowulf stands on it's own entirely, and will be being read and understood a thousand years from now.  I doubt the same can be said of Rambo and Conan the Barbarian.|`|pD2MtL9Oaa	Not sure what your essay is supposed to be about, but action movies with similar themes would be:    Conan the Barbarian  King Arthur  The Dark Knight (the new Batman movie - this could actually be a pretty cool comparison)  Highlander    or, you could watch one of the recent versions of Beowulf.  There are at least a couple out there.|`|f7jICJo2aa	Get the movies out on DVD and watch them, else don't write the essay ..    a 3D animation version ..  http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0442933/  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9qpqyO_d...

3OoCiOkAaa	You had  a relationship - albeit toxic. There was a relationship , emotion, affection and feelings.      The strongest thing in the world are feelings, that's why they are so dangerous.        Your relationship was not symbiotic. It was slightly parasitic, this meant he fed off you. You simply became used to it.      You could only really be a parent to this young man as that was your true role if you remove the love, sex  and lust.      Children do not stay with their parents forever unless you are Norman Bates, so he has simply matured and sought another life.      But like all parents the kids still need to turn up when they need mummy and daddy. As mummy and daddy are the only two people that will give unconditional love.      You are not his parent so this is harder on you than if you were his biological parents as you are not getting anything back.      You are grieving because you have lost a lover and a child. He is no longer your lover or partner, but he will use you like a kid uses a parent.      You have to decide if you can maintain such a relationship with another adult as you will have all the responsibility of a parent without reward.       You will have every desire to take him back and nurture him if things go wrong. But as soon as he is mended he will leave you- you are a parent.      While there is an age gap I don't think that is the problem. I think he is a childish adult and you are parental adult. Almost like a mammy who is a surrogate parent, but your only reward is seeing him happy. But you get nothing yourself.      I would try to be brave and let him go. He will always need you as I know adults who act like babies well into their sixties. They are narcissistic and pre-occupied with their own needs.      The first step is to recognise you are not his parents and even if he cries for help. Be aware it is physical, financial and emotional help he wants. Not a relationship.       If you want to help him altruistically do so. But you really don't want to be a surrogate parent let him find someone else- he will.      Baby -type adults are incredibly disloyal and believe everyone is put on the earth to help them. They do not have empathy and he sadly does not possess the ability to view the world from your perspective.      I am afraid you have to make the decision on your future relationship with him.|`|2JJLYSAKaa	I am sorry that this happened.

Then you've got 4 years of med school, followed by a minimum of 3 years of residency - the first year of residency is called the internship - more time is required if you want to specialize in something, either extending your residency or called a fellowship.

It was the most amazing time of my life!  I have made my best friends there and have contacts all over the world.  I have found that Italians were the most welcoming people in Europe.  If you needed any help at all they would literally take you by the hand and lead you where to go.  They want to teach you their language and want to learn yours in return.  They are genuinely excited to talk to you.  You will get home sick.  But not until you have been there for a few months and by that time you will have friends to support you.  But honestly coming back to the States was a bigger culture shock than going to Italy was.    This will be the grandest and most exciting adventure you will ever go on.  Enjoy every minute of it.  Eat too much amazing food.  Travel to every country on the weekends even though you can't afford it.  Laugh off ignorant comments about being American. Embrace your new culture and don't fight it.  Go out even if you feel like being alone.  And most importantly keep a travel journal so when you are back home and want to reflect on the most amazing time of your life you can read and reminisce.     Good Luck.  You will be great!
3OoCiOkAaa	A cliche is a popular phrase which has now lost it's original meaning through overuse and distortion.      Ironically , y ou have distorted the cliche as the phrase is   "I can't catch my breath".      This means I am finding it hard to breath.      This is the reason cliches are frowned upon in English Grammar as so may people end up speaking rubbish, mispronouncing or completely losing the meaning.       It is better for most people to say what they mean instead of using a tired saying which they have re-worded.      The weather  be "so cold that you could almost touch your breath".  That would be metaphor.    But" I can't touch my breath" is a silly as saying" I can't fight my gorilla".  It's  just  bonkers.|`|fnXN6cKSaa	That is NOT a cliche!

That said, just sticking to being normal in living your life is not necessarily the best way of leading a satisfying, happy, useful life, for oneself or for society.  Also, when conditions are not normal, we may need people with qualities that are not normal to find the solutions.

AA12044809	The first thing you have to do is to learn how to smoke like Humphry Bogart and James Cagney and be able to talk and move like Jack Web in Dragnet and then you have to have a hat that you can pull down or lift up over your forhead and then you have to have a room with a wooden table in it and say three or four chairs that you can sit the person your interrogating in and then you have to have the ability to turn the lights out in the room and have one of those lamps that you can shine into the person's face and if want to have the real effect you need a shoulder holster and a gun so when you take your coat off you look kind of studly and remember your room should have a one way mirror so you can look inside the room with your friends and make comments about the person sitting at the table and optional items could be what they call a blackjack and brass knuckles to beat the prisoner with and lots of black coffee that you can throw into his face when he passes out but one of the hardest things to do in being an iterrogator is getting a lineup setup so you can pick the person out first that your going to interrogate and you didn't even mention that but I suppose you could just rent a couple of rooms somewhere and get you a secretary that just likes to sit and file her nails and start your own busines called 'Professional Interrogators Incorporated' and your motto could be 'We get it all out of em' and then once you get a sign made for your business visit all the law enforcement agencies and let them know your a professional interrogator and you can interrogate robbers, killers, juvinile delenquints, drug users, muggers, liers, cheaters, grandma's and grandpa's, moonshiners, horse theives, girls, little kids, and terrorists and then go back to your office and shave and talk to your secretary and wait for the phone to ring.

AA10165376	The first permanent photograph was made in 1814 by Joseph Nicphore Nipce using a sliding wooden box camera made by Charles and Vincent Chevalier in Paris. Nipce built on a discovery by Johann Heinrich Schultz (1724): a silver and chalk mixture darkens under exposure to light. While this was the introduction of photography, the history of the camera can be traced back much further. Photographic cameras were a development of the camera obscura, a device dating back to the Book of Optics (1021) of the Iraqi Arab scientist Ibn al-Haytham (Alhacen),[1] which uses a pinhole or lens to project an image of the scene outside onto a viewing surface.    Before the invention of photographic lapel processes there was no way to preserve the images produced by these cameras apart from manually tracing them. The earliest cameras were room-sized, with space for one or more people inside; these gradually evolved into more and more compact models such as that by Nipce's time portable handheld cameras suitable for photography were readily available. The first camera that was small and portable enough to be practical for photography was built by Johann Zahn in 1685, though it would be almost 150 years before such an application was possible.|`|NcMIUbJ6aa	its really old now|`|ZddXPpF1aa	thsi site has it all-http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_...|`|q2qwydOVaa	eyes

Jn7bt3JTaa	The scream of the banshee of Ireland dear.    Banshee or 'Bean-sidhe' is Irish for faerie woman - ban (bean), meaning a woman, and shee ( sidhe), meaning faerie. The banshee can appear in one of three guises: a young woman, a stately matron or a raddled old hag. These represent the triple aspects of the Celtic goddess of war and death, namely Badhbh, Macha and Mor-Rioghain.  She usually wears either a grey, hooded cloak or the winding sheet or grave robe of the unshriven dead. She may also appear as a washer-woman, and is seen apparently washing the blood stained clothes of those who are about to die. In this guise she is known as the bean-nighe or washing woman. She always has long flowing hair and eyes red from crying.    When someone is about to die, the Banshee appears at the family's home during the night and weeps and wails. Sometimes, the Banshee cries for several nights in a row. Her sharp, cries and wails are also called 'keen'. The wail of a banshee pierces the night, it's notes rising and falling like the waves of the sea, it always announces a mortal's death.    She is solitary woman fairy, mourning and forewarning those only of the best families in Ireland, those with most ancient Celtic lineages, whose names begin with 'Mac/Mc' or 'O'. According to tradition, the banshee can only cry for five major Irish families: the O'Neills, the O'Briens, the O'Connors, the O'Gradys and the Kavanaghs. Intermarriage has since extended this select list.    Each Banshee has her own mortal family and out of love she follows the old race across the ocean to distant lands. Her wails or keen can be heard in America and England, wherever the true Irish have settled.    When a member of the beloved race is dying, she paces the dark hills about his house. She sharply contrasts against the night's blackness, her white figure emerges with silver-grey hair streaming to the ground and a grey-white cloak of a cobweb texture clinging to her tall thin body. Her face is pale, her eyes red with centuries of crying.    She is also know as White Lady of Sorrow and Lady of Death. Unseen, banshees attend the funerals of the beloved dead. Although, sometimes she can be heard wailing, her voice blending in with the mournful cries of others.|`|2LrB58M7aa	His neighbors arguing and getting a divorce.|`|HehSzTs9aa	the sound of plastic turd dropping on the floor

Why not make your own twist on a classic like the Witch's point of view from Hansel and Gretel.  Those little brats were eating her house.  She was trying to be a nice neighbor and invited them in for dinner and those evil children stuffed her in the oven before she had a chance to explain why she was trying to fatten them up.  After all they were skin in bones when they arrived and she couldn't very well send them home in their condition or the poor wolf that needed a rest after walking for miles and stopped at grandmother's house and she left without ever talking to him and when Little Red Riding hood arrived he was so tired and all the little girl did was talk, talk, talk, and ask a million questions about his eyes, nose and mouth.

It is a parody of the gingerbread man, however, it is meant for an age where things like the phrase "stinky cheese" are still funny.     A great way to throw the story into a lesson, is to promote healthy eating. Do the story and bring in slices of cheese you have cut with gingerbread man cookie cutters, and let the kids decorate them while you tell the story. The utilities are typically the cheese men on top of lettuce and sandwich bread with diced up vegetables and nuts, using ranch dressing with some fun "rotten" green food coloring mixed in as the "glue" (place it in diner-style ketchup bottles and limit one bottle per table so the sharing promotes more careful usage)    It would also help to order a foam cheese head from the Green Bay Packer's fan website and wear it while you read.

In Kikongo their ethnonym is usually given as Besikongo, singular Mwisikongo, though Bakongo is linguistically possible and gaining popularity. In the late 20th century they numbered about 10,220,000.    [edit] History     Kongo people's bowl in the National Museum of African Art, Washington, DCThe Kongo people probably arrived in the region of the mouth of the Congo River before 500 BCE, as part of the larger Bantu migration. They were already working iron in the region and practicing agriculture by that time. By the late fourteenth century they were living in a number of kingdoms, including the Kingdom of Kongo, Ngoyo, Vungu, Kakongo and others stretching on both sides of the Congo River. During the sixteenth century yet another powerful Bakongo kingdom, Loango, developed and controlled much of the coast north of the Congo River. In 1483 the Portuguese arrived on the coast, and the Bakongo of the Kingdom of Kongo began diplomatic relations which included sending Bakongo nobles to visit the royal court in Portugal in 1485. Bakongo leaders were quickly converted by Christian missionaries and assumed Portuguese court manners, and after an initial confrontation between those who supported the new religion and those who rejected it, the party following King Afonso I triumphed and Kongo became a Christian kingdom. In 1568 Bakongo peoples were invaded by the Jagas (Yaka), and the Bakongo were forced to look to the Portuguese for help, which ultimately allowed the Portuguese to establish acolony in Angola on Kongo's territory, in 1575. In the aftermath of the Battle of Mbwila, 1665, in which a Portuguese-led army from Angola defeated that of Kongo, and the civil war that followed, the Kingdom of Kongo never regained its former power. In the ensuing years the Bakongo alternately fought for and against the Portuguese, eventually being colonized in 1885. The Bakongo political party in Democratic Republic of the Congo Abako played an important part in national independence in 1960.    In its prime, the Kingdom exacted taxes, forced labor, and collected fines from its citizens in order to prosper. At times, enslaved peoples, ivory, and copper were traded to the Europeans on the coast. The important harbors were Soyo and Mpinda. When the Kongo Kingdom was at its political apex in the 16th and 17th centuries, the King, who was elected from among a noble class of descendants of former kings, bana Kongo (plural of mwana Kongo), reigned supreme. He was chosen by a group of electors, usually the holders of important offices or governors of provinces. The activities of the court were supported by an extensive system of civil servants, and the court itself usually consisted of numerous relatives of the King. The villages were often governed by lesser relatives of the King who were responsible to him. All members of government were invested with their power under the auspices of a ritual specialist, and frequently a Catholic priest.      [edit] Language  Most of them speak Kikongo, which is divided into many dialects that are not sometimes mutually intelligible, but they also speak Portuguese as their first or second language in Angola and French in the Republic of the Congo and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Others still speak Lingala a common Lingua Franca in Western Congo, or Kikongo ya Leta (also called Kituba in Congo), a creole form of Kikongo spoken widely in the Republic of the Congo, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Angola.      [edit] Agriculture  The Bakongo cultivate cassava, bananas, maize, sweet potatoes, peanuts (groundnuts), beans, and taro. Cash crops are coffee, cacao, urena, bananas, and palm oil. Fishing and hunting are still practiced by some groups, but many Bakongo live, work and trade in towns.      [edit] Religion  Traditional Kongo religion believed heavily on the concept of the dead, as most of the inhabitants of the other world are held to have once lived in this world. Only Nzambi Mpungu, the name for the high god, is usually held to have existed outside the world and to have created it. Other categories of the dead include bakulu or ancestors, the souls of the recently departed, and in some cases, more powerful beings held to be the souls of the long departed. There are also supernatural beings who are guardians of particular places and territories, sometimes held to be the soul of the founder, and there are those who inhabit and are captured in minkisi (singular nkisi), or charms, whose operation is the closest to magic. The value of these supernatural operations is generally held to be in the intentions of the worker, rather than the other world having spirits or souls that are intrisically good or bad.    Following the conversion of Nzinga Nkuwu in 1491 most of the inh
SsB7aRExaa	"to revenge oneself on a friend for stealing some money"       This is proper English, but it might be better to use the word, "avenge", instead of "revenge" in this case.        "to revenge a friend for stealing some money"      This is not proper English. It makes no sense.        "The young lady who came to Bob to revenge for her mother could have killed him in cold blood"       This is not correct.  Again, it does not make sense.  If I understand what you are trying to say, it would be better worded one of these ways:    "The young lady who came to Bob to seek revenge for her mother could have killed him in cold blood"   (Awkward, but it does make sense, at least.)    "The young lady came to Bob, seeking revenge for her mother's murder.  She could have killed him in cold blood."   (Better, but still a bit awkward.  I think it's the best I can do for you without having more information about the story.)    I hope you find this helpful!  :)|`|3hg2j8sSaa	The first sentence has too many words and that muddles up the meaning. The second one is better.    Take out the word "for" in the last sentence. "The young lady who came to Bob to revenge her mother could have killed him in cold blood."|`|7j8VqylNaa	In English, one either "avenges" oneself or "gets revenge" on someone.  The two phrases have similar meaning; they just depend on whether you're applying them to the subject or object of the phrase.    In your case, you would say   "to get revenge on a friend for stealing some money"  or more commonly  "to get revenge because one's friend stole some money"|`|b6063ab6904ab13b2dc2b1a2d39b4c1aaa	to revenge oneself on a friend for stealing some money  to revenge a friend for stealing some money    These sentences are not clear.  Are you trying to say that you want to take revenge on your friend because he or she stole money from you?  If so, then say:    TAKE revenge on a friend for stealing some money.    If you want to help out a friend who had some money stolen FROM him or her, then say:    AVENGE a friend who had some money stolen.    The last sentence should read:  The young lady, who came to Bob to avenge her mother, could have killed him in cold blood.    Basically you are confusing REVENGE and AVENGE and they are not interchangeable.|`|TEE4sJscaa	Sorry, but none of your sentences make much sense. I have reworded both of them for you below.    1)My friend stole some money from me, so I beat him.                            or:   2)To avenge her mother, the young lady could have killed Bob. Instead, She quickly came to her senses and decided not to kill someone in cold blood.

xYvzED5Waa	No, the answer is no because when you take the SAT test and how much score that you earn you will get how much score that you will earn. However, the websites collegeboard only help you the opportunity to go in and to register or you may practice the test on the collegeboard websites if you want. Certainly, collegeboard can help you applying for a college and help you send your score that how much you earn to college. Then, if you make a higher score on the SAT 1 test you can go in the collegeboard.com and send that score to the college you want to attend or enroll. Also, if your score are lower than a 450 or below that you cannot send to college that you want to attend or enroll because the score is below or lower that college not accept it. The collegeboard will not give you more score or any credit for that so don't think to try to send your score to a college if your score are lower or below. I hope you think before you do something or send your score to college but if it higher than 450 like 600, 700, or 800 you may send to college that you want to attend or enroll because your score in SAT 1 is higher and they will accept you and they might sent you an email or a letter in the envelope. Then, make sure you type an email or address in the box so they will know and to contact with you. Also, TOEFL is the same with SAT test too so if you thinking to send a score to any college think before you do because they alway accept high scores only.

KuWfLKGiaa	Language is always in a state of flux.  That said, the tendency to miss out characters, exemplified in recent years by email & texting shortcuts is not simply a modern phenomena - it has always been appropriate when in a rush / limited by message length. (If not a text, then a small piece of paper - C U was used as shorthand way before mobile 'phones & texting)  Spelling mistakes are generally down to laziness IMHO(!) - especially when there is a pushy pencil reminding you from the side of the screen.  The lack of editing skills does no-one any credit - we are all fallible, making mistakes - but being unconcerned with correcting such, personally does frustrate my sensibilities of being careful in what I communicate.  So no - I don't believe it to be a new trend - just society being more & more in a rush - and less & less concerned about the actual message.  I am always amazed on Yahoo answers, that I often have to clarify what the questioner means (denote not define for example), before I answer their intended question (my perception of what they actually meant) - I put this down to the age of the participants - and the lack of education - although this last bit sounds tremendously pretentious & patronising.  Personally I still have to check my spelling - if in doubt..  Rant over - being chilled about it is also a fair solution!|`|3OoCiOkAaa	I'm dyslexia-  I have trouble spelling and often make mistakes.    I have a MSc degree. I went back to school to improve my English skills because I am writing  a book.     While people often state on the YA , Youtube or Myspace, abbreviations  are just  text speak. It is not true. My dyslexic standard English was far better than 17- 25 year olds  who were considered within the normal range.      Many of English students  couldn't delineate between text language and correct grammatical  English.     Three English teachers stated  while they don't mind language changing, they were concerned at the literacy rates. The standard has dropped.      On English papers students are allowed round 10 spelling mistakes before they get penalised.      There is nothing wrong with writing bc for because. But you have to know the correct spelling . I have seen becos, becors, becoss, becuss,   becas.     The word dis is used  ( excessively) for disrespectful but when people have to write it. I understand why they say dis. I have seen dissrspekfull on more than a dozen occasions.    Some people struggle with "with" an write "wit".    Someone on youtube castigated me for  the word "massive"  He called me every poor expletive under the sun. Because the word was   "masif ". Even with my poorest dyslexia I was never so humongously   dunce.         My advice is -you should know what the abbreviation stands for and don't use it as a ploy to mask poor English.      In the words of my English teacher many individuals are struggling because they are unaware it is not correct English. They can neither spell or recognise the real words. They are now speaking English as a second language.|`|lcj1AKt1aa	I see it all the time but I do not tell them about it because I feel that they would be offended.  I corrected one person who was saying that he wanted a place that only educated whites were living after showing a youtube video of people dancing.  I had to respond because his question had a lot of mistakes. In terms of texting yes they do it to save characters.  Even on IM on msn it is done.|`|TEE4sJscaa	Cutting characters from words is a type of internet slang. It is normally typed by immature people.|`|2SJ4gVytaa	Well, to err is human... I suppose...|`|N7rQ9luraa	I used to be quite good at spelling, but  about six years ago I started to learn Italian, (I'm still trying.  Just ask my family ;-)  )  Since then my spelling has deteriorated a bit because I get English and Italian mixed up.   OF COURSE, I'm also getting old.    I don't cut characters as they seem to change every time I turn around.  I'll stick to using the spellchecker!

'Friend' could tell the 'girl' her secret however when they argue and fall out 'girl' might try to get her own back and could start spreading the secret so that it eventually comes with terrible consequences, either the 6th former is expelled or the teacher sacked, depending on the storyline.

GEfUTyi8aa	"She was going to go out today, but remembered it was cold."    this is the correct use of the comma.    with reference to your question about it being a complete sentence after a comma... no.. that is for semicolon use.... for example:  She was going to go outside today; the trees were all frosty and white and beautiful.    And never rely on Microsoft word to do your spelling, grammar and puncuation.. it overlooks many things, especially comma use.  Always proof read yourself and if you dont know, get a grammar and punctuation book to learn the rules...|`|Nbl74N2Kaa	yea no, get rid of the first comma and your good. and if you ever have any questions like this i suggest you type it in microsoft word and just do the grammer check, it'll fix it for you|`|77nibaOaaa	Same as above, but you should also put a comma on the end and extend the sentence further.|`|JFbWyKKDaa	no comma between out and today... it's called a comma splice.

IqiSKYKvaa	1. So whatever she sells, she gets 1% of the price, in this case she receives 1% of a $120 000 home. So 1% = 0.01, and 0.01 (120 000) is $1200.     2. To find the discount rate, you'd first have to subtract the sale price from the regular price. In this case, the sale price is 12 and the regular price is 16, and 16-12 is 4. The difference is 4, and 4 is worth a certain fraction, or discount rate, of 16. To find the discount rate, you divide 4 by 16, which gives you 1/4, which is 25%.    3. Kim starts out with $325, and to earn $22.75 she has a certain interest rate. So this interest rate times whatever she put in gives her the amount she earns in interest. To find the rate, divide 22.75 by 325, which is 0.07, which is 7%.    Hope I helped clarify the problems ^^|`|QxNP2Ng7aa	1. 1% of 120000 = 0.01 x 120 000 = $1200  2. $4 discount from $16, so it is 4/16 = 1/4 = 25% discount from original  3. 325/22.75 = 14.3% p.a.? i'm not sure about this one    there you go.|`|iYBvVUgyaa	1) 120,000 x .01 = $1200  2) (16-12)/16 then x100 to get percent = 25%  3) Question a little bit wierd but i believe its 7%

L7BSLB6faa	AP/IB just is not that big a deal from my perspective as a teacher.  They can be excellent programs, but it sounds to me you are interested in learning regardless of the school and so long as you apply yourself and learn, either school could be a good place.  And as far as sports go, you could go to either and look to excel on the team with the challenges, or be lost on the team with the "greatness."  Or if you are good enough, then you could make an impact on either team.  In both schools you can take more challenging classes whether or not they are AP.  A lot of the AP classes are just a way for the school to "look good" without actually being a good learning experience.|`|iJrCZxy8aa	school B for sure. As long as your comfortable right?

Zbn8A7Geaa	My daughter brought home a decorated paper cup with a marigold in it.  They had planted seeds and let them grow in class.  They had decorated the cups themselves (they were the larger cups) with various cut outs and markers and such.  I have that flower's descendants still in my garden!       A single envelope of marigold seeds would do for a whole class.  You'd only need to plant two in each cup.   And they'd have time to at least to sprout before mother's day if you do them very early next week.  The important thing of course, is making the cup beautiful.      OR one year, the teacher took polaroids of each individual child and the child then created a 8 1/2 x 11 construction paper card with their photo in the middle and the rest decorated with cut outs and markers.  I still have that one too.    This one takes more work from the teacher, but one year, the teacher had them make up little construction paper booklets -- she had cut out the paper into squares, hole punched them in one corner and tied them together thru that hole with yarn.  Inside, the teacher had written questions that she asked the child about time with their mother. Like " what is my favorite thing to do with Mom," or "why is my mom special", things of that nature.  Then she wrote down exactly what they said, no editing or cleaning up the grammar....just exactly what they said.  And then the kids decorated the booklet themselves with different kinds of art supplies.  I still have that one too!  Apparently I make a pretty good grilled cheese sandwich!   And my reading to her at night was her favorite thing to do.   That little booklet is one of my most treasured things.    With my son, one thing that I have that I just love is they created a construction paper card with the child's handprint done in fingerpaint.  They decorated around it of course, but the main thing was the handprint.   Inside the teacher had glued a poem she'd printed off from somewhere about how the child will love the mother even more when he's grown up, but here's my handprint so you'll always remember how small I was.    And then of course the kids got the fun of decorating the card.    There are lots of things you can have them do even though the children in your class are young.   Just remember to put the date somewhere on the project, so the Mom's will always be able to look back and see exactly what date something was made.  Believe me, you can't go wrong with a project like this -- the Moms are going to love whatever you do.  And the kids will have a ball gluing macaroni, construction cut outs, or whatever art supplies you use.|`|1b771d8c5ecb7cf9ea18297c6a0bf6f7aa	Wow, I loooove the cherry blossom project with the popcorn.

Put the popcorn and some of the powdered   pink paint in a plastic bag and shake.   These will be your blossoms.    Pour the pink popcorn onto a tray.  Put   white craft glue on a paper plate and let   the kids dip the popcorn into the glue and   then stick to their tree brances to make   their Cherry Blossom Tree.    You can glue a piece of cardboard or cardstock   to the back to stiffen the picture.    Viola!  Your Cherry Blossom Tree|`|mBfQt9KQaa	Like surojabu said, the handprint idea is nice. I did this as a child and my parents still have it.    The poem was slightly different though, it went something like this:    This is my hand,  So very small,  for you to hang upon the wall.  For you to watch as the years go by,  How I grow,  My hand and I.     ---------------------  Another idea...I've noticed at bargain shops that you can buy little blank canvases for art for a couple of dollars. So if you had a small budget to spend, you could buy a little canvas for each child to paint for their mum.     Then you could make cards with the children...they could do a drawing of their mum and you could ask them what they love about their mum, and you could scribe their words onto the card.|`|XS38jvVFaa	Find a great handprint poem at the following address:    http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...

Jahrh. neben dem Karneval grossen Unterhaltungswert in der oberen Gesellschaftsschicht. Sie dienten auch der Zgellosigkeit und nahmen oft orgiastische Zge an. Auch im Alltag, besonders Nachts war es z.B. in Italien blich, Gesichtsmasken zu tragen, um nicht erkannt zu werden, wenn man zur Geliebten oder gar jemanden heimtckisch ermorden wollte.

Der Mensch, der die sch?nste Maske hatte, stand im Mittelpunkt und war reizvoll in jeder Hinsicht.

First of all, you need to be of Mexican, Central or South American origin. Next, you simply cross the incredibly pourous border that exists between the U.S. and Mexico at any number of unguarded crossings. Next, you steal a U.S. citizen's social security number and present it to the company in the U.S. that you want to work at. If you are at least as crafty as any one of the millions of people who have already done this you should be able to remain gainfully employed for years. Also, make sure that you have children both quickly and in large numbers. WHY?! Because every one of them would be legal citizens of the U.S. with all rights and priviledges and make deporting you a VERY remote possibility (should you ever get found out). While you're in the U.S., illegally, you might want to give back to those who are primarily responsible for having made all this possible for you and vote a straight line ticket for any and all Democratic candidates during the election seasons.|`|AA10478980	The field of engineering is always looking for employees.

You might want to send out resumes to companies in the areas or citties that you would like to work.  You will also have to get a work visa and eventually what is called a green card (though it is not green in color).  You will have to check with your government and with an American Embassy on how to gain permission to work in the U.S.

Many are made up words, but they are pronouncable, e.g. radar, ANZAC, NATO, NASA, unlike your LDCSSTV.    Unless you are perhaps looking for a sentence where the words start with those letters in sequence?

ed2a26ffbcbe73ef0a7e9ff4df12f078aa	I believe it is just a matter of anglicizing the Chinese pronunciation in settling upon the proper English phonetic spelling of an updated pronunciation.      Mao Tse-tung became Mao Zedong because those who authoritatively determine the phonetic English spelling of Chinese words must have noted changes in the Chinese' own pronunciation of Mao's name and then reworked the English phonetic spelling to conform.    Similarly the change from Peking to Beijing.  There are countless additional examples.|`|hxDlBpaYaa	for some reason, the spelling changes through different history books, but the pronounciation remains the same. Even within a span of years they will spell it differently. Some are literal letter translations while others are americanized.

Syn2excFaa	I saw how they covered them on the discovery channel with out dirt. They would use many layers of resin that would dry up and turn into a very durable foam.

Or you could just truck in rocks and dirt from the nearest new mine/foundation/quarry.
7ZX3Ibz4aa	One of the ways I have always kept track of what a number is (either negative or positive is by changing the signs first.......so    6 - 7(x-3)=-1   becomes 6 + negative 7(x + negative 3)    that becomes 6 + negative 7x + 21 = -1    Change the signs first to make the subtracted numbers negative and the step becomes addition.  This way you wont make a mistake when using the distributive property.    Hope that helped.  Good luck.|`|a5KCRbVraa	its because.. you multiplied -7 and -3. which is both negative. any number with like signs when multiplied results in a positive sign. :) you can do it. hehe|`|AA10152451	This is something a lot of people struggle with. Forget about the 6  part for a second and only take the - 7(x-3). I do realize that it's not really a negative but when you do the distributive property you kinda treat it as such.    So you multiple the first part first. -7 times x is -7x.  Now multiple the -7 times -3. That's 21... a positive 21, so it's like +21.  -7x + 21

4507QKRdaa	Having integrity is something that defines a person.  If a person says what he/she says they will do, this is integrity.  If a person lives up to committments, that is integrity.    The importance of integrity in public life is that society operates more smoothly.  For example, if there is no integrity, you can not write checks at stores due to the high risk of them bouncing, which translates to lost revenue or higher costs of doing business for stores.  Without integrity, it is more difficult to borrow money for a home or car.  Withough integrity, the government has to step in and pass very expensive laws such as the Sarbanes-Oxley act that costs businesses billions of dollars per year just to show that they are acting appropriately.  Without integrity, lawyers make more money and everything costs more for us because those fees get rolled into the goods and services we use every day.    In the book "The Speed of Trust" by Stephen M.R. Covey, not to be confused with Stephen Covey, it makes a very good case for this.  It basically says that lack of integrity and trust in others slows life down and makes it more expensive.  He also tells a story of how Warren Buffet did a very large business deal based on a handshake and it only took a few months to close the deal because they had a great deal of trust between them.  This trust saved many months and millions of dollars in fees of all kinds for Mr. Buffet and the business partner.|`|Y6ZxIHk3aa	Hi, one point you could include could discuss how in our public lives we are expected to conform to certain social norms, whether we agree or not. And it is important that we have integrity so that we will stand by what we believe instead of being a follower. i.e. The 2008 Election, Gay Marriages, Global Warming, ect..

As meninas de antigamente, e acredito que hoje ainda fazem assim, usavam esse mtodo para ver se determinado menino gostariam delas ou n?o,  um jogo de sorte no amor.  Gincana = Fun Fair.  Figurante = Extra (parece estranho, mas  isso mesmo) Co-star, como disse algum ai, n?o  figurante e sim coadjuvante. Um ator secundrio,  geralmente um ator coadjuvante, o primeiro  o astro principal. Um figurante geralmente n?o  t?o importante assim, s aparece eventualmente na rua (de uma cidade cenogrfica claro), como algum transeunte, por exemplo.  Acabamento = finishing touches      Agora, se voc quer saber como  Mal ou Bem-me-quer em ingls no sentido de dizer as palavras para cada ptala arrancada, ai : , Want me well, Want me bad. Melhor do que isso s no Michaellis e olhe l, se bem que tem um excelente dicionrio ingls/portugus/ingls, do qual n?o lembro agora o nome, que acho que ali voc ir achar o que quer. Vou tentar descobrir o tal dicionrio e quando apareceres por aqui novamente e eu te ver e  responder, te dou o toque do dicionrio.  Ueba!, descobri o nome do Dicionrio;  Webster.

Search for "Cwalk" or crip walking.|`|AA11767734	The Crip Walk, or C-Walk, is a dance that originated in the early 1970s in Compton, a poor suburb of Los Angeles, California, (popularly referenced in rap lyrics). What began as a symbolic dance in the early 1980s in South Central Los Angeles, soon became a staple of hip-hop dance in the late 1990sOriginally, members of the Crips would use nimble movements of their feet to spell out their names or other Crips words (sometimes spelling out Bloods, the name of their rival gang, and then crossing it out). Many Crip gangs also use the C-Walk to celebrate the initiation of a new member. It is also believed that the C-walk was used as a warning, for example in the build-up to a robbery: The lookout would stand outside of the store and act as surveillance, while the robbers would await the signalthe C-walk. Typically performed to West Coast gangsta rap and G-funk, the C-Walk first hit the mainstream when rapper Ice-T performed it on stage in front of cameras in the late '80s. Later, rapper WC would follow suit and add to its popularity; however, he clearly let the public know that this was not a dance, as "gangstas don't dance", and that it was only meant to show love to other Crip members.1 The C-Walk was censored in the video of Snoop Dogg's hit single "Drop It Like It's Hot".|`|AA10279623	It's a dance that people from the gang know as The Crips do.|`|aBg6UiGuaa	it means some one that is nnot able to walk.|`|sc16ytKxaa	it's a dance..    try looking up for  'crip walk' in wiki.. they have the whole article there.|`|f738171932ab54aad5c064b188a63e40aa	Tha Crip walk is is step [or dance] tha crips do.

L7BSLB6faa	Read aloud to him.  Every day.  Once you discover what appeals to him, read more of the same kind, or re-read the favorites.  But mostly right now, just read aloud to him and make it fun.  Show him how much fun reading can be.  Also, it sounds like it might be appropriate for some extra help at school for him regarding the speech.  And ten hours of sleep for a six year old is just fine.|`|3iypYSWkaa	Hooked on Phonics, I used it to teach both my kids how to read. They entered Kindergarten reading at a third grade level.

Then read each word and make him say it after you and then explain to him after every sentence what it means.|`|AA11065140	Well, let's start by assuming he's not stupid!  I certainly hope that no one in your home is saying that in front of him!!!    It sounds to me as if he needs to see a specialist.  I'll start by recommending a speech therapist.  If he has trouble pronouncing the basic sounds, he'll need a particular type of training, that's specific to the nature of his malfunctioning speech patterns.  Chances are, you cannot fix this at home, and you should ask the school if they can recommend where to get started in finding a specialist who can help.    My next recommendation is to have him tested for dyslexia and/or ADD/ADHD.  You should take him at his word that he doesn't know how.  If you haven't been able to teach him, then there's potentially a medical reason why he's not learning.  Also, "I'm tired" often translates directly to "I really don't get it and your frustration exhausts me!".  If he has a medical problem, then it's really not going to be possible for you to teach him - really, none of you have the qualifications to do it, so there's no point in all of you being frustrated over it.    Other than that, I can only suggest the "sound-it-out" method, that most of us used to learn how to read.  Working on this with him may help you identify problems.  For example, if he knows that the letter S sounds like "ssss", but still doesn't see the letter S in one of the words, there's a significant possibility that he's dyslexic.  But that's really the most effective way for any of us to learn to read...we start by understanding each letter of the alphabet, and knowing the sound that each makes.  From there, we can start to string words together.

Academic  5. International  6. Classic (19th and 18th Centuries)  7. Anything goes    Just a few examples I'm sure you can find many other commonalities to group them together.|`|UyITmoH7aa	Satire (not to be confused with allegory) is usually an (graphic but not always) interpretation of something using a medium such as a comic, novel, poster, ect.    In other words, it is usually something that makes fun of something else, such as a topic in politics, or a recent event, usually through images but not always.    Examples of satire are George Orwell's novel "Animal Farm" and Huxley's "Brave New World". These novels can also be referred to as "allegory" (which you can search up on dictionary.com if you don't know what it means.) Newspaper comics are also examples of satire.    So basically, satire is something that makes fun of a recent event.

Hope I helped xx|`|GLOBmh0Baa	You could do all three sciences if you really wanted, but I wouldn't reccomend taking more than two, because it can be hard to keep up with all the work. Again, you don't need to take geography and history, just one or the other. If you want to go to university, it is necessary to take French. If not, then it's your choice if you want to take it or not. It is a good idea to take ICT,as these skills are worth having. Good luck :)|`|W8EhdMVtaa	do ict i am doing it now at college and the course im on will give me the equivalent of 4 a levels, its worth it better than anything else i have done|`|1UsdeqwRaa	IT or ICT is good to couple with science courses as it will help you use computers to model scientific problems in later "A" levels and degree courses. Maths and English are also essential!!  Keeping to all science base options means that you may be limited to science based degree courses.

il0aaYsdaa	Supposedly highlighting is one of the worst ways to study (random fact).   Anyway, that's what I would have done.  Make sure you're not getting too hung up on memorizing vocab (I find highlighting makes me do this) and that you're understanding the concepts.  Once you understand the concepts the vocab will come more naturally to you.  Try it out for this test and see what happens.      Another trick I've tried is making note cards.  On one side you have the concept you're studying and on the other side you have important facts about that concept.    Good Luck on your test!|`|GEfUTyi8aa	Yes, very good..... it will help yo focus and believe it or not your mind will use the color to remember the information....|`|gB5LP70Laa	yeah thats good especially if your'e a visual learner.  try googling it and checking wat sort of learner u are|`|crZg76Hpaa	I use a pink hilighter. It makes stuff stand out more than yellow. But what I do when I make my notes is I hilight all the important things, go back and summarize each hilighted point onto a point form list on my laptop. It's much more effective for studying than from the books again because then you have to re-read the style the author writes in and put it into your words when you could have already done that.

There will be a difference if you are looking for average beginning salary or average overall salary, because every district has different steps in their payscale.

pD2MtL9Oaa	Force = mass x acceleration    The mass of the sledgehammer (or whatever you're using to break the concrete) is constant.  Therefore, to increase the force of your hit, you need the hammer to be moving quickly (i.e. high acceleration).  If it's moving slowly, you will have less force and be less successful in breaking the concrete.|`|sQXSKaO3aa	Basically you are trying to break the molecules apart. If you put the pressure on slowly the molecules of the concrete can shift around to be able to "take" the force. If you hit it quickly then they don't have time to move or mold, they have to break. Another way to think about it is that the kinetic energy is placed on those few molecules instead of being able to spread out slowly through the material.

In the modern flag, the coat of arms are greatly simplified as compared to previous variants. Each of the four quadrants represent one of the four kingdoms that were merged to form a unified Spain at the end of the 15th century. Namely, the kingdoms are: Castile, represented by the castle, Len, represented by the lion, Aragon, represented by the vertical alternating red and yellow stripes (four red stripes, five yellow stripes), and Navarre, represented by the linked chains. Also the moorish kingdom of Granada is represented by the pomegranate fruit in the bottom of the coat of arms. The two columns with the "plus ultra" ensign (meaning "further" in Latin) represent Spanish discovery and colonization of America, the columns being the mythological Pillars of Hercules (of the Strait of Gibraltar, gateway to the Atlantic Ocean). The "Plus Ultra" phrase replaced the former "Non Plus Ultra" (something like "No further from here") before the discovery of America, since Spain was considered "the Westernmost point" on Earth (thus, "no further from here)"(Wikipedia)|`|5172370a6954c16f7258c394936166dfaa	They only put it on when i moved out here ! i think it's the Spanish version of the RED CARPET TREATMENT ?

Usa tcnicas como leer rpidamente el tema para estimar el tiempo necesario para el estudio, hacer un anlisis (identifica los elementos principales que constituyen el tema que estudias) usar el subrayado y haz un resumen (si te gustan tus libros no lo hagas, o hazlo con un lpiz), haz una sntesis (o sea recrea en tu mente lo estudiado) de  lo que recuerdas y plasmalo a ver que comprensin tienes de lo que has ledo, y repasa slo lo olvidado.  Importante debes repasar todo lo visto en clase el mismo da, si lo dejas para ms adelante olvidars mucho de lo visto; de la informacin que tengo es que pasado un da despus de la clase en el aula perdemos como el 50% de lo que nos ense?an (si no lo registramos y lo repasamos ese mismo da o en el da subsiguiente); esto explica porque estudiar unos das antes de un examen no sirve porque no puedes revertir las horas de clases y sin estudio en unos pocos minutos.

oXacJTGqaa	During my finals, I remember times when I used to get so scared and nervous that I found it hard to go to sleep. All the negativity in behaviour added up to nothing. Being extra nervous didn't help me do extra better because I wasted time on those silly emotions. Precious time that I could have spent on resting or studying in a relaxed manner.    My suggestion is to try and study for a period of time (say an hour straight) then take a 10 minute break doing something very different from studies (eg watching a music video or eating and drinking something) then go back to studying after that. Knowledge absorbed while relaxed is stored longer than while stressed, in my opinion.    Studying is important, the correct way. Health is more important because a healthy person can gain more knowledge and retain it for longer (unhealthy people tend to die younger, putting God's will aside that is).|`|c4768ac32f93f9156e70e132e4ec3c91aa	I get this feeling sometimes as well.

Se farai bene il tuo lavoro la scuola sar una sorta di seconda casa.  Non voglio scendere in dettagli troppo personali, ma anche io lavoravo in un'azienda, guadagnavo tanto ma c'era qualcosa che mi mancava.   Ho mollato tutto e mi sono iscritta alla S.S.I.S. con mille dubbi.  Dopo tanti sacrifici sono diventata un'insegnante, faccio molte supplenze, ed ho delle soddisfazioni enormi.

Cq4leO0Saa	I'm not sure what you're asking exactly.    But I've spent some time in Australia, and I can tell you that Australians are pretty animated. When they talk, they use hand gestures.     They say things like "Good on ya," which means "way to go." And they often say "No worries," or "No worries, mate." This means, "Don't worry about it."    They smile a lot--a kind of nonverbal communication--and most seem to enjoy life.    "No worries" can also be sort of a mantra for their way of life.

And the magazine racks.  These books will in turn help you generate even more ideas as how to key-word them for your favorite search engine.|`|IIzsFgZoaa	Well, go look then...|`|0fb23a9ce88e8a89360c731cb0f6df50aa	I would do an image search on the internet.

AA11017928	Please resubmit the question without abbreviations.      What country is this this?    Did you spell "Rupublic Act" correctly?  Please link or tell us what the act says/does.    Now,  in the USA, State of Florida:  The property office (PO) notifies the 'land owner of record;' as well as all entities holding any liens or mortgages on the property; by mail, that taxes are due.    If not paid by a certain deadline, the PO publishes in the designated 'legal newspaper' for the county that a 'tax certificate' will be auctioned on a certain date.    The tax certificate is sold to the LOWEST bidder.  (The bids start at 18% and go DOWN.)    After two (2) years, the owner of the tax certificate asks the PO to auction the property to pay for the tax certificate - including accrued interest.    The high bidder of the auction gets a clear title to the land and the owner of the tax certificate gets his principal and accrued interest.  Any remaining money is held for the previous owner to ask for.    Usually at the auction, those lien holders and mortgage holders will bid AT LEAST the amount owed them.

bb5e7e2013f001f52c989dc5d8402748aa	Declare Speech-Language Pathology as your major.  If your school does not offer that for undergrad, talk to your counselor about related fields you can major in instead (such as education, health, etc).      The governments Occupational Outlook Handbook is a great starting place for information about the field (including education, salary, work settings and more)!    Just type each career in the search box on their website. Here is the link:http://www.bls.gov/OCO/    The website even includes links to the field's professional organization website; :)|`|xU9Nu15Jaa	You have to have science subject in your class XII for joining a degree in Speech and hearing sciences. Some universities accept without maths in the major and some demand maths subject. Biology is a must as you are dealing with paramedical/allied health studies.  You can find a full review of the scope for this subject in the following link.  http://www.indiastudychannel.com/resourc...
bb5e7e2013f001f52c989dc5d8402748aa	The U.S. government's Occupational Outlook Handbook is a great starting place for information  (including education, salary, work settings and more)!    Just type each career in the search box on their website. Here is the link:http://www.bls.gov/OCO/    The website even includes links to the U.S. field's professional organization website.    HOWEVER, I do not know if things are the same in Canada.  Sorry :(    So here are some answers based on my experience in the U.S.  1. It takes 4 years to get a Bachelor's Degree and a few places will still let you work as an SLP with a Bachelor's.  However, most require a Master's degree which will take an additional 2 years (6 years total).  2. My schools looked for students to have Speech Pathology courses in undergrad (If you didn't you just had to take them later).  Also courses on child development, special education, geriatric populations, math , science, the evolution of language, language development, linguistics, etc.  Take as many SLP related courses as you can manage.  3. I doubt the Master's in SLP could be considered similar to medical school.  As SLPs, we learn a little about the body overall but we focus on the head and neck.  Doctors have to know about the whole body.  4. A person in Speech can go on to get a PhD  5. Grad school cost greatly depend on where you go.  Besides tuition there are lots of hidden expenses, such as buying an appropriate wardrobe, books, relocating for your internship if necessary, buying lab coats, toys, and other materials.  I think grad programs can range from 10-30+ thousand per year.    Good luck :)

XblE1K9eaa	Ok firstly, you have done a great thing and you shouldnt be ashamed or embarrased about the way things have spun round.  Remember you are the decent person!    I would say, in my experience, the best way to stop rumors and lies and stuff is just to play along with it.  Nearly all of the time people will continue to tease you about something that they may well know is a lie only because they get a reaction.  If you didnt provide them with a reaction then they won't continue to do it.    so next time they try and tease you about it just say "yeah, sure" or "yeah, whatever you say mate" and hopefully they'll realise you dont really care and stop it.  (if you were a boy i would recommend a your mumma joke but eh its ok either way :D)  Hope this helps!|`|wxXCqVj4aa	You could say yes, I have a crush on him because he is better than the rest of you, all are losers so low that you would pick on a special needs kid.|`|MLLCn4weaa	I expect most people will know that you don't actually have a crush on him.  You've told everyone that you don't and leave it at that.  The more you rise to it, the more they'll do it.    You did the right thing.  They're the losers.  Just say next time that you're fed up of talking about it, and you're not going to talk about it anymore as it's just boring.|`|QgbD4lEPaa	WOW well done for standing up to that boy! We need more people like you in the world!    Just ignore the boys who are saying that you have a crush on him. i know its hard but if they see its getting to you they'll do it more!    Good luck with them and well done again for standing up for the boy who is getting picked on :)    xxx  |`|n5G5IIbOaa	Try not to get to worked up about it, the more you do the more they'll be satisfied.

(:  and I'm 13 and year 9 and know what its like to have stupid rumour's made. Well done for sticking up for that boy in class... you did the right thing telling the boys to back off him - its not right people picking on someone for something that like a special need that cannot be changed.   Its quite immature that them boys are spreading these rumour's about you crushing on the other boy; teachers just tell you to ignore them. But if I were in your shoes i'd be quite annoyed and fustrated.  You really can't let it get to you though. Show them boys that you're the sensible one who doesn't care about what they're saying in some respects it is true that if you ignore them it they won't bother carrying on the rumour. Or you can do what I would do and smack them. LOL. only kidding - well i would.. but i get tempered easily. All I can say is that I hope these boys grow up and that it doesn't get to you too much.    Good luck with it all! x x x
AA11017928	A. The study of man must be anthropology, but one who hates mankind is a misanthopist (please note that mis is the begining of the underlined word). A creature that resembles man is called an  anthropoid. (oid is the end of the underlined word).      B. If you draw something away from someone's reputation, you detract from it; but if you draw someone's attention away, you attract them. To draw away a small portion from a larger whole is to extract but a noun meaning something that draws people tomgether is an attraction (again please note that an is the begining of the word)  
AA11017928	You really need to use the 'scientific method' here.  You also need to explain what you want to learn from this.  There are probably over 300 tests that can be done on water.    Do you want to know which beaches have water that is considered 'safe' to swim?  Do you want to know which beaches have any endangered species using it for procreation?  Do you want to know which beaches can be used for extracting salt?    Remember, when writing the report, use correct English and grammar ... not the text-messaging language.    There must be hundreds of reports already done and published in which water for beaches was analyzed.  They were done by universities, public health departments, as well as state and federal environmental agencies.  As the librarian at your PUBLIC LIBRARY to do 'a comprehensive literature search'  on the subject for you.    Lastly, if your report is done well, get it peer-reviewed.  Then, after acceptance by those people, submit copies to:  the Library of Congress, your state's environmental organizations, environmental advocacy organizations, and several organizations at the federal level interested in the information.  This will prevent it from being in what is considered 'gray literature.'  It will also establish you as a published author.  
AA11017928	If digestion were to take place in one location, it would have to do it in 'batch' mode.  This means as food is ingested it would have to have a place to be stored while the previous batch is being worked on by the bacteria.  Can you think of the problems associated with this method?    [ Go and watch Krispy Kreme make its donuts ... on a continuous method, not a batch method.  This method allows the employees time to work with each donut ... by adding a filler or topping, as well as hand-packaging.  Imagine what it would be like if the employees had, say 500 donuts, dumped on them at one time!    You can also visit a vehicle assembly plant or Burger King to see the continuous method.]    In the 'canal' mode, the bacteria works on incoming food and digests it all during the TIME in the canal.  When all of the food is (hopefully) digested, the wastes from the bacteria's WORK is then discharged through two methods ... the urinary tract and the rectum.    When the bacteria in the canal is killed (because you ingested, breathed, or otherwise had a 'killer' enter your body) then the food is not digested properly causing food, water, and perhaps some waste exit as described above.    Visit a wastewater treatment plant and watch the processes there.  All of the liquid waste is handled/treated on a continuous basis; not a batch method.  The solids that result are collected and may be handled by one or both methods.    Now, try to imagine a teacher doing the continuous method in giving a test to his/her students.  Each student has a time-limit, and each student starts at a different time.  It's not practical or feasible.    By the way, the school system probably does both.  Students are 'batched' into one grade for a year; but during the year the students (in batches)  are moving through a text book.  At the end of the year, they should have completed the text book and are ready for the next batch (grade.)    Good Luck!

81ZqCu42aa	I had a similar situation like you when I was in elementary school. I'm also asian and I was born in a state where there is a few asians living there. There are mostly whites, blacks, and hispanics in the state where I was born. I remembered I get bullied all the time from 1st - 4th grade because I was the only asian in the class and in the whole entire school. It was a white school and I get bullied there all the time. Whenever I walk down the hallway they would call be chinese boy just because I am Asian. You should get out of the school and go to another school because it is not good to be a school where there are all white kids. Also, kids in middle school are just stupid. They just like to bully people for no reason. Just wait until you get to high school, it will be so much better than now. Looks and appearance got nothing to do with it. Those kids are just stupid. Just remember that there is nothing wrong with you. It's just them!|`|kdfQmu40aa	Ughh I know what you mean! I'm asian, and kids repeatedly call me "chink" and "asian *****" "asian smart ***". But not only that, but kids just hate me because I'm kind of too quiet and "weird". Ever since elementary school, kids have bullied me over and over again. When I have done nothing wrong to them. I even had to change schools because one group of girls just wouldn't leave me alone.    I think you need to learn to not take anything they say seriously. Because they are the ones who are not going to get a good education and go to a good college and have a successful life. Those popular girls only bully people to feel better about themselves. So you should know that they are far from perfect, that they are all losers with no life. They like to bully us because of our race and personalities, but they are the ones who are going to pay later on. I just pity them. I look down on them and think I am better because at least I am not obsessed with other kids and especially GIRLS and go out of my way to bully them like they do.|`|evwy9vWcaa	OK well obviously they're not picking on you because you're ugly. You are beautiful. I'm thinking its probably because they're either jealous of you or because they're racist. If you suspect that it is the former, then be flattered. I know it hurts to be bullied but is the "popular group" really worth caring about anyway? If you suspect that it is the latter, it needs to be addressed. Tell your principal or a teacher that you trust. Or tell your parents what is going on. An adult should help you. If you don't want them to use your name when it is addressed, specify that.

Good luck!    ;-)|`|u9JfOcylaa	Well I think that you should take At a minimum: chemistry, biology and math.   If you can take physics in high school, do it.   If you can, take AP (Advanced Placement) or college dual enrollment courses in the sciences.   A good foundation in high school can be tremendously helpful in doing well when you take these topics again in college.Also vaulenteer at a local dentristy. If your school has a career center that practices dental asst. do it!! =]  Try to get advanced math classes. Take a class or two of science of math so you can be ahead.Challegeing your self looks good =]  Be positive and good luck!|`|1f3izdThaa	I'm currently a dental student here in the US, and as far as I'm aware, there's three ways to get into dental school, two of which are applicable to you, so I'll only mention the two that you'd be concerned about.  The last one is about people who want to change careers and are done with college so we won't talk about that.    1. do well in college.  It doesn't generally matter if you go to a good college or a not so well known one as long as you do well.  Of course, you're better off if you go to a good college, such as Harvard, Stanford, UCLA, USC, etc, but it's definitely more important that you have a high GPA in a Biology (or other science major) as well as high DAT (Dental Admissions Test) scores, which is something you would take your third or fourth year of college.    During your college years, it's important to get involved with some volunteer and research opportunities, and especially job shadowing dentists and possibly participating in some free dental clinics or working in a dental office if at all possible.    2.  your other option is to get accepted into a program directly out of high school like the San Francisco, California based University of the Pacific's 2+3, 3+3, or 4+3 program, meaning, if it's the 2+3 program, you go to their undergraduate college for two years, taking specific classes that they ask you to, and making specific grades, and as long as you pass the interview (which almost everyone does), you're accepted into their dental school.  The 3+3 and 4+3 just means you spend 3 years at their undergraduate school or four years at their undergraduate school.  The last "3" in the 2+3, 3+3, and 4+3 just means that you spend 3 years in the dental program to get your license.  That part doesn't change, only the amount of years you spend in undergraduate college.  This program is relatively competitive, but not nearly as competitive as trying to get into dental school after going to college.  This is DEFINITELY the route I'd take had I known I wanted to be a dentist in high school.  If you're REALLY interested, come visit the school and call the school and let them know you're interested in doing the advanced program and ask them what they want from you in high school in order to be accepted.    If you're interested, here's the website i found about this program:  http://www.dental.pacific.edu/Academic_P...    I'm not really sure whether or not other dental schools offer this program, but a good website to just browse through and check out is www.adea.org
deMhIes4aa	Never been to boarding school..but you can make it fun.  Why would you want to label yourself to one of those cliques? Jeezs..people are not classified like that. A 'gothy' girl may like pink things too...but because shes considered goth, cant express that without getting disapproving looks from stuck up preps.   My whole point is, be who you are, dress the way you want to...dont label yourself and stick to one. This is a chance to reinvent yourself, show a side of yourself that noone knows back home, be you for once! Dont miss the opportunity, and good luck!! ^^    xoxomel
bOGrxATaaa	Well, you might need to do a little editing but...here goes nothing.      I believe that males and females should not have separate schools. Establishing separate schools would be a bad idea for many reasons.  First off, building separate schools would cost a fortune to the United States because of our economy. With all the cuts we're making, there is no way we can afford to build new schools!    On the other hand, males and females do not learn different. The only things separating us is our sexuality. By saying that new schools will be built to split-up the males and females would be an United States sexist act.     That is why I think, schools should not separate males and females in schools.|`|dqI9KWNDaa	how else are they gunna get laid|`|W1XZ4kAVaa	I Don't think so because then that could some of guys and girls to become you know

In a previous generation, in many towns, bullying and hazing were very accepted.  It was considered a right of passage for younger ones coming up, and it was dished out to all.  In the process, the bullied ones became comrades.  It was awful, but it was how things were.    Today, there are too many newcomers, and there is too much societal baggage to condone or allow bullying and hazing of any sort.  Though I hate bullying, I worry that the end of bullying and even fighting will lead to a "peace, love, and understanding" mentality that simply will not be capable of dealing with the dangerous elements of society that school kids will encounter later in life.

In society back in the elizabethan era, the Nurse is lower down in the hierarchy due to her job and gender (although she does stand out, as her power is larger than any average wet nurse at the time). The Friar is higher in society as he is a leader of the Church in Verona where inhabitants seeks advice from him. Religion was taken seriously back then too, and don't forget...he's a man!

TOPJybbsaa	The MBA degree was originally created because engineers working for companies were promoted to managerial positions, and often they did not know how to manage, although they were good engineers. Companies needed managers who could understand what the engineers were saying, and managers without engineering degrees often did not understand the engineers and their needs. Business schools responded by creating the MBA degree. It is a general degree designed to train student to enter any area of management.     Most MBA programs accept students with any undergraduate degree. You take courses in accounting, finance, marketing, economics, management, statistics, policy, and others. MBA programs prefer students whose undergraduate degree is not business related. The MBA is in contrast to the MS degree which concentrates on courses in a single field and trains students to reach higher levels of knowledge in their specialty so that they can serve as better staff and researchers, with no intention of becoming high level managers.    MS programs typically require an undergraduate degree in the field in which you want the MS. For an MS in accounting you need an accounting degree, not a degree in history, or music. For an MS in Music you need a music degree, not a degree in finance.     Although MBA programs may offer concentrations in specific fields in the second year, the emphasis in all MBA programs is on a broad range of courses. The specialization may amount to 2-3 elective courses in a field in the second year of the MBA program. Students who want to concentrate in a specific field and train for a staff position should seek an MS degree rather than an MBA.    Consult the Official MBA Guide. It's a comprehensive free public service with more than 2,000 MBA programs listed worldwide. It allows you to search for programs by location (US, Europe, Far East, etc.), by concentration (finance, marketing, aviation management, health management, accounting, etc.), by type of program (full-time, distance learning, part-time, etc), and by listing your own criteria and preferences to get a list of universities that satisfy your needs. You can use the Guide to contact schools of your choice, examine their data, visit their web site, and send them pre applications.

Mathematics is very broadly divided into foundations, algebra, analysis, geometry, and applied mathematics, which includes theoretical computer science.    The meanings of mathematics    Mathematics is used to communicate information about a wide range of different subjects. Here are three broad categories:        * Mathematics describes the real world: many areas of mathematics originated with attempts to describe and solve real world phenomena - from measuring farms (geometry) to falling apples (calculus) to gambling (probability). Mathematics is widely used in modern physics and engineering, and has been hugely successful in helping us to understand more about the universe around us from its largest scales (physical cosmology) to its smallest (quantum mechanics). Indeed, the very success of mathematics in this respect has been a source of puzzlement for some philosophers (see The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences by Eugene Wigner).        * Mathematics describes abstract structures: on the other hand, there are areas of pure mathematics which deal with abstract structures, which have no known physical counterparts at all. However, it is difficult to give any categorical examples here, as even the most abstract structures can be co-opted as models in some branch of physics (see Calabi-Yau spaces and string theory).        * Mathematics describes mathematics: mathematics can be used reflexively to describe itselfthis is an area of mathematics called metamathematics.    Mathematics can communicate a range of meanings that is as wide as (although different from) that of a natural language. As German mathematician R.L.E. Schwarzenberger says:        My own attitude, which I share with many of my colleagues, is simply that mathematics is a language. Like English, or Latin, or Chinese, there are certain concepts for which mathematics is particularly well suited: it would be as foolish to attempt to write a love poem in the language of mathematics as to prove the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra using the English language. - Schwarzenberger (2000)
U0WXua8Maa	USMLE scores are the single most important criteria to get a residency in USA. With the amount of competition presently scores higher than 90 to 95 percentile is needed for Internal Medicine residency.    Family Practice needs almost like passing on first attempt with average scores going above 80 to 85 and in some 90 too.    Psychiatry needs scores reasonable enough in 80's, But the standards have raised now and they need like minimum 6 months of hands on experience.    Looking at the present trend 2 attempts already in Step 1 is very bad. If you have patience to do hands on experience and research with publications. You might have chance. or else its hardly possible.    Possibly it will be long wait to get a residency with failed attempts and no green card or citizenship.

Some MBA programmes, however, will accept students without a Bachelors degree and you sort of earn it while earning your masters.     A good MBA or BBA should give you a good overview of the business world and how things work, from a management perspective. You'll learn about hiring/firing staff, accounting and finance, operations management, project management, and so on.

So someone just starting at 75 would have to teach many less years than someone starting at the age of 25.

2sGHClGgaa	Here's a website that shows how to do a lot of different types of math problems. May help.|`|pD2MtL9Oaa	The most general help that I can give is:    1. Convert your mixed numbers entirely to fractions before starting the problem.  i.e. 1 and 5/8 would convert to 13/8    2. If the denominators are the same, just add the numerators and then you can convert your answer back to a mixed number.    3. If the denominators are different, you need to figure out the lowest common denominator and then convert the problem to one that uses equivalent fractions of the lowest common denominator.    For example, let's take 1 and 5/8 + 3 and 9/16.  First let's make them both fractions; 1 and 5/8 become 13/8 (because 1 = 8/8 and 8/8 + 5/8 = 13/8), 3 and 9/16 becomes 57/16.  Next, we need to get the denominators to be the same.  The easiest way to do this here is to make both denominators 16.  You already have 57/16, so we can convert 13/8 to 26/16 (16 is 8x2, so you multiply 13 by 2 to get the equivalent numerator).    Now that they have the same denominator, you just add the numerators.  57+26 = 83 which gives us 83/16.  Now we just divide to get our mixed number back 5 and 3/16.    Sorry, if that was hard to follow.  Fractions are kind of difficult to walk through on YA|`|JnXmSLDfaa	I wouldn't dream of making remarks, any thing that somebody doesn't know is a valid question.

AA10176626	The answer is "yes", and the Student Loan Interest Deduction is described in Chapter 4 of IRS Publication 970. If I don't provide a link to that publication at the bottom of this answer, it's because Yahoo! is still acting up today when you try to post a hyperlink.    Here's what the introduction to the chapter says:    "Generally, personal interest you pay, other than certain mortgage interest, is not deductible on your tax return. However, if your modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) is less than $70,000 ($145,000 if filing a joint return) there is a special deduction allowed for paying interest on a student loan (also known as an education loan) used for higher education."    Since this IS the IRS, after all, you can trust that there is a long list of rules and regulations describing who is able to take advantage of this deduction, and how much you can take. I'd strongly recommend that you review Chapter 4 carefully, and/or discuss the appropriate treatment of your student loan interest with a knowledgeable tax advisor or accountant.    Good luck - I hope this helped!    (No luck with the link - Google "IRS Publication 970", and you'll have no problem finding it)

AA10176626	Mrs. MJ:    Yes, the entire refund is subject to garnishment- BUT there is a way for your husband to prevent that from happening, and get his share of the refund.    Under normal circumstances, when a couple files a joint return, the IRS applies a legal standard called "joint and several liability" to the couple's tax situation. In non-legal terms, this simply means that the husband and wife are both liable for any taxes owed, regardless of which of the two is actually responsible for them.     That's the general rule, but the IRS does allow some exceptions. The trick is that they don't happen automatically - you have to apply for them. In this case, your husband will need to file IRS Form 8379, which is used to make the claim that he is an "injured spouse".    Here's how the IRS describes an injured spouse:    "Are You an Injured Spouse?    You may be an injured spouse if you file a joint tax return and  all or part of your portion of the overpayment was, or is  expected to be, applied (offset) to your spouses legally  enforceable past-due federal tax, state income tax, child or  spousal support, or a federal nontax debt, such as a student  loan."    That sounds to me like it describes your husband's situation.     Visit the link below, which will take you to a PDF version of Form 8379, which you can print and file. Instructions are included, which explain, for example, that you'll need to make a notation on the top of your joint return, and you will need to file this 8379 at the same time as your tax return for this year (and every year that the government continues to withhold your share of the refund).    I hope that information helps you - it should save your husband some money and some grief. Good luck!    Sorry: Yahoo is having problems accepting answers with links in them today - google IRS publication 8379, and you'll find a link to the tax form.|`|yp8NtB0faa	yes he will.  becuz u are married, they will take it out of his tax refund|`|cQklLbL1aa	If you file a joint tax return and you owe a student loan, and if the government garnishes your retun for you loan, whatever you and your husband are to get back, the government will take whatever they need to  satisfy what you owe. Since it will be a joint return, they can take whatever it takes to satisfy what you owe. If you file jointly, the government can garnish both of you for what you owe on your student loan, if they so desire..|`|asX2hxFXaa	Yes, if you file jointly, it probably will be.    You two need to stop having so much withheld.  That is, if you have no refund, there is no refund to be garnished.  It's not that hard to project what your taxes will be, so minimize the withholdings and plan to owe a little instead.

Psychologist, social worker, drug/marriage/family councilling, etc. etc,    I have a B.A. and I don't really think a B.Sc. or a B.A. is better... it just depends what you want to do with it when you graduate... With a degree in chemistry and health, teaching would be a good option because you can teach chemistry, health, gym, and kinesiology with that degree. You could also talk to the guidance office at your school. They always have tons of suggestions about what to do with your degree. Also, at the university I went to you could get a psychoogy degree as a Bachelor of Science or a Bachelor of Arts... You had to take the science psychology courses that dealt with the composition of the brain, medicine, and neurology to get your Bachelor of Science whereas with the Bachelor of Arts psychology degree you didn't take as many science courses and you focused more on behaviour and such.

71yXXY3eaa	There are plenty of points you could use but I will give you a main one:    Humanity is a collection of individuals who are not all the same.  Humanity is not as much a chorus of all female sopranos as an entire orchestra of many different instruments that serve different functions towards making the orchestra sound good.  Each instrument sounds best when it is played in accordance with its natural sound.  If one tried to play a cello like a violin, he might be able to, but playing the cello the natural way is best.

I recommend you google it, check out opposing views, for instance there is a book out by some guy that is allmost titled that, then I would google 'womens societal roles', feminist views on female roles, christian views on female roles,   then I would question who is defining 'natural',  and who came up with that definition....because it sounds like a Biblical interpretation of 'natural' as the Bible being the sole basis for it... which is not the same as 'natural', just changed Bible 'natural' ..... which may not be 'natural', at all.... see?  then I would add a part on the fact that the bible was changed and reinterpreted by men who wanted to control women, and it doesnt have much to do with 'God'..... and that there are thousands of different interpretations of the Bible, God, etc.....|`|2SJ4gVytaa	Check these links:  http://www.teachit.co.uk/attachments/3mi...  http://www.123helpme.com/search.asp?text...  http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs...

It doesn't pay that well, especially if you only get a B.S.  Getting a graduate degree in it is better for both earning more and getting a job doing research.  If you only want to do it for the whales and dolphins then your options are also limited, as that seems to be what everyone else in marine biology wants to do too and it's very competitive (I'm in it for the marine invertebrates).    What I tell people is that even if I'm not getting paid as much as everyone else, at least I love my job/education and I'm not stuck in a cubicle.    It's up to you.  If you love it than go for it!  If you think you would be happier getting more money and not having your dream job then do that.|`|vN42z811aa	I would generally choose Accounting, its alot more money i would probably be more enjoyable.

AA10176626	Olivia:    This would depend on how efficient the Human Resources department is at this particular company.     Theoretically, it's possible that a company would keep a database of every single person who ever filled out an application. In that kind of set up, if an employee tried to create an entry for your new application, the system would notice that there is an existing entry with the same name and social security number, and the employee would receive some kind of notification of that.    Is it likely that a large company keeps track of every person who ever applied? Probably not.    On the other hand, your situation is a little different. You're not just a former applicant - you're a former employee. The chances are much greater that this company tracks the names and social security numbers of all former employees - especially, I'm afraid, of those employees who left on bad terms.     Certainly not in your case, I'm sure, but sometimes bad separations lead to further problems (law suits or whatever), and so it's good corporate practice for a company to keep good records of who used to work there, when they worked there, whether they were good employees, and what the circumstances were of their departure.    My advice, if you really want the job, and you want to limit the potential for an uncomfortable discovery - answer the question accurately, but make sure you tell the hiring manager what happened the last time you worked there. If it's horrible, they won't want to hire you, anyway. If it was a misunderstanding, or a personality conflict, or even if you're just older and wiser, chances are that the hiring manager will understand. At the very least, they'll appreciate your honesty.    Good luck!

BUT don't believe it when people say it is the most wonderful job in the world.  Yes, it certainly has its moments and can be wonderful, but along with that is much hard work and lots of pressure. It depends a lot on your class, parents of the children in your class, other teachers/support staff you work with, and the support and expectations from your senior management team and head teacher. Good luck!
lx5DnQLKaa	If you want to be a doctor you should definitely study Triple Award Science. You study the separate sciences - Biology, Chemistry and Physics, so are able to study each one in more depth. This will increase your knowledge in Science much more than Geography will, and Triple Award Science is much more suited and helpful to someone who wants to be a doctor, plus looks good on your record as it's considered a very hard subject. Geography is not a very suitable subject for an aspiring doctor to be honest, there's no science involved at all.    I am currently in Year 11 and study Triple Award Science, and it is hard, i'm not going to lie. The coursework is quite challenging, especially Physics. But, as cheesy as it sounds, if you listen to what you are being taught in the lessons, make notes and make sure you understand the concepts and formulae you are being taught, plus revise well, you should get through it. I think that you should speak to your teachers and see what your grades are like, to see if you can keep up with the workload. I'm an average student  Bs and As, and I have not seriously struggled so bad that I wished I hadn't taken the subject. However, if you feel you honestly could not keep up, you can choose to take Double Award. Don't take Additional, it's what most people take as their compulsory science, and doesn't show that you have an interest in Science at all.     Not many people study Triple Award Science, it's usually people like you who want careers in Science. And even then, most people just take Additional or Double Award. Triple Award will give you an advantage, as you even study extra modules, that borderline on AS work.     I think you should consider what Geography and Triple Award Science will offer you. In fact, i'm surprised you can't take both. Usually, you choose between a Science or a college course. Sorry for rambling! But hope this helped =]|`|j6y1sQuvaa	triple science.

Feel free to adapt for your needs.      R rating permission   Some current films such Saving Private Ryan have an MPAA rating of R: "Restricted, Under 17 Requires Accompanying Parent Or Adult Guardian." These films may contain some adult material.

lBRud4y5aa	Gravity overcoming buoyancy. Tanks are flooded with sea water and it won't float. Also hydroplanes swivel to bring the leading edge down and the propulsion from the screws pushes the vessel down.    Jet taking off is due to lift over the wing surfaces. The air travelling over the top surface has to travel further than the air below the wing for the same forward speed. This is due to the section shape of the wing. The air on the top of the wing creates lower pressure because the molecules are forced by the air's movement. This creates lift. The engine merely pushes the aircraft forward in horizontal flight. May jets can fly vertically of course if they have sufficient engine thrust to overcome gravitational pull. Hope some of this helps.

That's 366, and each page from now on has 3 digits, so divide by 3 getting 122 more pages after page 99.  So that's 121 pages after page 100 making 221 pages in the book.

8quTABk6aa	Recidivism rates are quite high; in fact, non-violent criminals in the justice system often come out more screwed-up than when they went in.    I imagine most people can be rehabilitated; I don't think many are.    Prisons can be more effective with legislative changes.  Drug-use, prostiution and gambling should not be crimes that warrant jail time.  If you took all the drug users out of jail, you could keep the violent criminals in for a much longer period.  Further, the cost savings from this could allow for wide spread treatment programs.|`|gHRbi3c5aa	What are the chances that a person serving time in prison will commit another crime?    There's every possibility because crime is as much an issue of the psychological, emotional, social and financial as well as one of rebellion and boredom.    Can a person be rehabilitated if they commit a crime that warrants 10 years of prison or more?    There's every chance - especially if the programme is one that meets all of the above needs. There is a chance that te prisoner may have become institutionalised but that can be catered for too - -  in fact, very easily.    How can US prisons be more effective?  sorry - UK citizen so can't answer that    If you were leading a country, what would your prison be like?  Wouldn't have prisons as such but units to address behaviour in terms of understanding (see answer to your first question). Punishment would be to bring redress to the victim's life - so that would be different for different crimes and people. Difficult to set up but easier, cheaper and more effective than a prison system that already includes social workers, psychologists, psychiatrists, medical staff, churches, probation officers - to name but a few. With all these people on board the focus should be on making redress work for the victim and the perpetrator (now, aren't you glad you asked!)

Ftkr9jqYaa	Inspiration refers to an unconscious burst of creativity in an artistic, musical, or other intellectual endeavor such as the invention of a new scientific theory. Literally, the word means "breathed upon," and it has its origins in both Hellenism and Hebraism in the West. Ancient Greek thinkers such as Homer and Hesiod believed that inspiration came from Gods such as the oracle of Delphi. In Hebrew poetics, inspiration is similarly a divine matter. In the Book of Amos, 3:8 the prophet speaks of being overwhelmed by God's voice and compelled to speak. In Christianity, inspiration is a gift of the Holy Spirit. Similarly, in the Ancient Norse religions, inspiration derives from the Gods.    The word inspiration comes by way of the Latin and the King James version of the Bible c.1303, "immediate influence of God or a god," especially that under which the holy books were written, from O.Fr. inspiration, from L.L. inspirationem (nom. inspiratio), from L. inspiratus, pp. of inspirare "inspire, inflame, blow into," from in-"in" + spirare "to breathe" (see spirit). Inspire in this sense is c.1340, from O.Fr. enspirer, from L. inspirare, a loan-transl. of Gk. pnein in the Bible. General sense of "influence or animate with an idea or purpose" is from 1390. Inspirational is 1839 as "influenced by inspiration;" 1884 as "tending to inspire."    If one has a title, such as "Sir" or "Prince" or "Doctor," one can promote the positive connotations of the title to motivate others to follow his leadership.  Sometimes, the positive attributes associated with a title will inspire followers to perform with greater morale and productivity than would be the case if the leader had no title.

Your current GPA is a failing GPA in grad school, no matter how good you are at programming.  If you really want to get a masters, you have to pull it up significantly.  If you can't, well, there's always that job offer you got.|`|AA10023710	What I do strongly recommend you do is work for a couple of years, either doing the job you were offered, or a different one. Use that time to explore career options, and explore which grad degree you might want. Keep in touch with your professors at your current university, so that when the time comes for you to apply to grad programs, you can use them as references.     Not only will working for a bit give you more direction and persepective on career possibilities/grad school options, it will also make you a stronger candidate for grad school. This is especially true because your overall GPA is a 2.54. That's not strong enough for a lot of grad programs, so you'll need to make sure your application is very strong in other ways to overcome that. Working, gaining experience can be one way to do that. Having very strong professor recommendations is another.     You absolutely are going to be able to find a grad program that will allow you to combine all your talents - music, drawing, and computer engineering. One example may be for you to get your grad degree in computer science/user interface design. There are other options as well, but give yourself a bit of time to explore them.     Keep in mind that your first job out of school is simply that - your first job. It probably won't be ideal - it won't give you everything that you need - but it will be a good first step.|`|f9uBsiosaa	Just work and pay off debt then go back to school.|`|JGWU0TTdaa	quite impressive. don,t fear you will never lose talents, you will only get better, I wish I knew how to program, Maybe I should invent another language, only I would know.

tX4RNX1faa	here is how I see it and it is semantics.  Creativity is limited by the size of the Imagination and the Imagination is only allowed to grow through reading which is how writers touch the fabric of creativity allowing the brain to visualize what's written in such varying detail by definition where no two readers will see a books virtues exactly the same yet we take what we see on the screens (tv and theaters) as done. No further thought needed. To learn is to grasp hold and understand something that is unknown to you to do so without creativity is what a military state would teach or a clone be born with. Promote reading it is the key to a most varying life.|`|mYhuGonfaa	Creativity in teaching or learning?    In teaching, it's all about creativity in the form of differentiated instruction. Meaning that not every child learns in the exact same way so we must be creative in our approach to teaching and be sure to reach each and every child's learning needs.    Creativity in the learner is necessary because they can take information and use their creativity to understand it at a deeper level. It's one thing to know the answer to a question or have trivial knowledge, but it's a whole other thing to have wisdom and know how to apply your knowledge to become a productive person.    Hope that made sense and answered your question.|`|d6349f62c822e9e2c0bbfe6dd63591b9aa	Creativity during prime developmental periods encourages children to not only learn the subject matter but how to learn the subject matter creating multiple new synapes rather than straight line absorption of facts.  As for people in general, we are less able to burn new synapses as we tend to 'repeat' the familiar.  We stop seeing.  Doing thing slightly differently, even if it's adjusting which sock you put on first, helps your mind 'expand'.  It fights boredom, and indifference which might promote your interest in learning.|`|yYYY4F5Taa	In creativity, one uses one's own mental capacity to bring out something new.When you teach a child how to make something, say a flower, he becomes aware of colours,flower parts, petal shapes, how plants grow,use of flowers etc.That is learning.When a child makes a small table in carpentry, he learns length,width, allignment,measuring etc.And the most important thing is a child will not destroy what he himself  has made.

3wAkbWqSaa	here are some:     It sometimes happens, even in the best of families, that a baby is born.  This is not necessarily cause for alarm.  The important thing is to keep your wits about you and borrow some money.  ~Elinor Goulding Smith      A baby is an angel whose wings decrease as his legs increase.  ~Author Unknown      Babies are always more trouble than you thought - and more wonderful.  ~Charles Osgood      Families with babies and families without babies are sorry for each other.  ~Ed Howe      People who say they sleep like a baby usually don't have one.  ~Leo J. Burke      Babies are such a nice way to start people.  ~Don Herrold      Every baby needs a lap.  ~Henry Robin      Getting down on all fours and imitating a rhinoceros stops babies from crying.  (Put an empty cigarette pack on your nose for a horn and make loud "snort" noises.)  I don't know why parents don't do this more often.  Usually it makes the kid laugh.  Sometimes it sends him into shock.  Either way it quiets him down.  If you're a parent, acting like a rhino has another advantage.  Keep it up until the kid is a teenager and he definitely won't have his friends hanging around your house all the time.  ~P.J. O'Rourke      When babies look beyond you and giggle, maybe they're seeing angels.  ~Quoted in The Angels' Little Instruction Book by Eileen Elias Freeman, 1994      Adam and Eve had many advantages, but the principal one was that they escaped teething.  ~Mark Twain, Pudd'nhead Wilson, 1894      A baby is a blank cheque made payable to the human race.  ~Barbara Christine Seifert      One of the most obvious results of having a baby around the house is to turn two good people into complete idiots who probably wouldn't have been much worse than mere imbeciles without it.  ~Georges Courteline, La Philosophie de Georges Courteline      ...a little child, born yesterday,  A thing on mother's milk and kisses fed...  ~"Hymn to Mercury" (one of the Homeric Hymns), translated from Greek by Percy Bysshe Shelley      God's interest in the human race is nowhere better evinced than in obstetrics.  ~Martin H.

LVPNuEsLaa	First of all, relax.  It is never too late.  I graduated in the 50% percentile of my high school class (worse grade than you) and then got kicked out of college for poor scholarship.    I got my ... head ... together, went back, and am now doing just what I wanted to do.  I go for my Ph.D. at a top-10 school this fall.  It just took me longer.    First of all: TALK TO YOUR PARENTS!!  Negotiate on a week-to-week basis rather than marking periods.  Offer to show your homework though the week in return for some being un-grounded on the weekends.    Second: RELAX!!  You are only a sophomore, you have plenty of time to work on college.  Colleges care much more about who you are as a senior than as a sophomore.    Third: SEE A COUNSELOR!! There are alternatives to the meds, and other things you can be doing.

It is really simple stay after school to make up the work you missed or preformed badly on and ask for assistance and extra credit to improve your grades. For this last semester ease up on extra curricular stuff so you have more time to study and approach your school work as a job. Make a schedule and follow it. Talk to your school counselor and get help in learning how to balance and plan your schedule. As to your medical treatment ask your parents if you can see a Dietitian - you may be able to improve your health by eliminating foods that aggravate your condition and see enough improvement you can safely stay off the meds and improve your over all well being. With hard work and determination anything is possible just keep your Sunny Side UP!|`|i7OFOo7faa	w00t:  The study of quantity starts with numbers, first the familiar natural numbers and integers ("whole numbers") and arithmetical operations on them, which are characterized in arithmetic. The deeper properties of integers are studied in number theory, whence such popular results as Fermat's Last Theorem. Number theory also holds two widely considered unsolved problems: the twin prime conjecture and Goldbach's conjecture.    As the number system is further developed, the integers are recognized as a subset of the rational numbers ("fractions"). These, in turn, are contained within the real numbers, which are used to represent continuous quantities. Real numbers are generalized to complex numbers. These are the first steps of a hierarchy of numbers that goes on to include quarternions and octonions. Consideration of the natural numbers also leads to the transfinite numbers, which formalize the concept of counting to infinity. Another area of study is size, which leads to the cardinal numbers and then to another conception of infinity: the aleph numbers, which allow meaningful comparison of the size of infinitely large sets.|`|qq7h7A4Oaa	SHAME ON YOU!!!!

vlCWp7sSaa	No, your resume needs to sound professional and as if you're a great candidate for a job. Plus you don't say how the job ended in there you just put the end date and your responsibilities. If they bring it up in the interview just say that you are seeking new opportunities and you feel that - that place didn't challenge you enough.|`|UEDSFuHnaa	It depends on whether the skills you can demonstrate from that job offer anything to the job you are applying for.  If you do not add it to your resume then it may lead the new company to ask questions about what you were doing during this time and then why you left it off your CV.  The company you are applying to can only contact your old employer for a reference with your permission and you don't normally have to give that until after you have been offered the job.  Your old employer is then only meant to provide facts about your employment and shouldn't use it as an opportunity to write derogatory comments about you.    Good luck finding a new job!
2HETgiwgaa	Try the links below - they're for Immigration New Zealand's website pages about living (the first one) and studying (the second one) in New Zealand.    It sounds you're already pretty well qualified, but there's a points process for qualifying to live in New Zealand - and I'd suggest you have a look at how many you already qualify for, look at the information about skills shortages, and line that up with the courses available - you may have to have a good look around the sites to get everything you need, but it should be there. If not, you can contact them throught the website (click on the online help link) if you have any questions.    If you are finding it to complicated to put it altogether, there are immigration consultants - but take care in choosing one if you choose to do that.      Good luck

Sozc3MyFaa	A lab science can be geology, marine biology, ornithology (birds) etc--any science class with a physical lab attached to the lecture portion.  In the catalog you will see this as Lec: MWF 1-2 LAB W 2-5 or something like that. Then the class must be considered a science (but other things besides chem, physics & reg bio are sciences, as I stated at first).|`|oLI2SJ08aa	A lab science means that there's a laboratory component to the class.

5qN7acCZaa	Wilfred Owen, Siegfried Sassoon and Rupert Brooke were all poets who went to war.  They were established as poets when they signed up and so it was only natural for them to continue to write about life on the front lines.  This gave the reader at home a realistic view of the horrors of war as never before.  This enabled others to follow suit in later conflicts.    I don't think there was a particular year, but most of these works were not published until after the deaths of the poets.  Surely, it was only when they were published, and in the public domain that things began to change...?|`|e871c3bc7828a54588e8b88635cfba63aa	I think it started in World War I with poets like Wilfred Owen.

Sozc3MyFaa	John's genotype is dominant; his wife's is recessive (small letters); and JOE has 2 recessives and 1 dominant.  Therefore in order the be recessive, the wife HAS to be abd/abd.  Now you have 2 pieces of the puzzle: the wife and the son and can work backward to John. In order the get the 2 recessives to Joe, BOTH parents must have a genotype that is recessive for the a & d alleles. AND, since the wife has to be abd/abd; JOHN must have the dominant B.  SO, JOHN must have a combo like this: aBd/A(b or B--this we can not tell)D, if they are inherited separately (not in threes).  He gives the a & d and the B; the wife the a,b, d.

Sozc3MyFaa	A is always dominant over O; so the others are incorrect that the mother could be AA; the father MUST be AO as well (it says a COUPLE with types A correct?).  If mom or dad were AA, there would always be AO as the genotype and the phenotype of a AO is A.  The only way to get a OO genotype which is the same as the phenotype here is the have 1 recessive O in each parent.    AO x AO =  possibles of AO or OO or AA.  It just happens that all three are OO   if one was a AA, then AO x AA would be AA, AO (no O type at all)|`|32ac678fb32061f1ae71fda812cb7afdaa	genotypes for the mother could be AA or AO and the father has to be OO since o is recessive. its chance|`|iYBvVUgyaa	does this assume that O is dominant?|`|kUN5DUZHaa	well the possible genotypes for the mother could be AA or AO and the father has to be OO since o is recessive. Therefore the possibilities for the children when the mother has the genotype AA and the father has OO is AO, AO, AO, and AO. All the same so the mother couldn't possibly have the genotype AO, because then all her children would have the A blood type. Therefore she has to be AO and since the father is OO the possibilities are AO, OO, AO and OO.

Triple science counts as 3 separate gcse's; biology, chemistry and physics.    You should think about what you mostly enjoy. In history there are lots of essay writing but if you enjoy the subject you should choose that.    Triple science is hard work but its more practical based. If your not sure and its available to you, you could think about double science because that is a bit less work and you mix the 3 science subjects in together.    But yeah think about what is of interest to you :)    hope i helped|`|60cwSqE9aa	What is your dream job? If you'd like to be a doctor, take triple science.

If you'd like to be a teacher, with your specialist subject English, Geography, French and (of course) History, take history but if you want to teach a science or maths, take triple science.    These are just examples. If you want to leave school immediately after GCSEs, it probably doesn't matter, even if you want to be a laboratory technician. Take your preferred option.
Sozc3MyFaa	They are the exact same thing--its just what the state calls them--for example in California, they are called LVNs not LPNs; in other states they are called LPNs.  So you do not need to decide anything; whatever school is near you will decide what they are called.
rpqHLJGGaa	Heteronym   A heteronym is a word that is spelled and sounds the same but has different meanings. An example of this is the word 'lick'. You can lick an ice cream (eating using only your tongue) or lick someone in a fight (defeat the person physically). Not to be confused with the term homonym. Homonyms sound the same but are not always spelled the same way. A good example of this are the words 'bear' and 'bare'. Bear (the animal) and bare (lacking decoration or to undress) are spelled differently, yet have different definitions.       Ambiguous   The word ambiguous identifies words or concepts that have two or more potential meanings. However, it differs from Heteronym in that the meaning is not clear due to a missing context. For example the word "saw" in the following phrase is ambigous:|`|1m9cWAEhaa	homonym|`|AA11510511	Ambiguous.|`|Ld1vLH8Kaa	Double entendre|`|ttT7W77gaa	innuendo,like the queen song|`|faddb3c58c57bc112ff5dec44a742ff8aa	Amphibolous,  or a homonym.|`|AA11966816	In what context - if you mean when someone says something that can be taken two ways then double entendre BUT if you mean a word that sounds the same but means different things then it`s a homonym.|`|hKlpfQBLaa	Complicated.   x|`|fa38e842848a4d4d0e66c24701940524aa	I think you're referring to the "double entendre."|`|Jaaasoolaa	homophones|`|6658d999f026bd18f37982abe4eaf199aa	similie

Ftkr9jqYaa	Non-signatory or nonsignatory refers to a party that has not signed the relevant contract(s).  Therefore, non-signatory income is income derived by a party who is not a direct participant in the contractual agreement, such as a temporary employee or subcontractor.    For example, a building owner agrees to pay a landscaper to maintain and esthetically beautify his lawns and gardens.  The building owner and landscaper are both signatories to a contract.  The landscaper hires groundskeepers to mow the lawn and plant flowers.  The groundskeepers are nonsignatories to the contract, whose non-signatory income is paid by the landscaper.    Example  2.  A vacationer and a boat owner sign a $5,000 contract requiring the vacationer to pay the boat owner in return for the boat owner taking his family on a two-day cruise of islands in the Florida Keys.  The boat owner hires a cook to prepare gourmet meals.  The cook is a non-signatory to the contract, so her reimbursement constitutes non-signatory income.

Put about half towards more courses, and put the other half into a high-interest vehicle that can lock it in for a few months, and then go in the Summer. This would work great if you could find about 30 people whom might be interested in a Package Tour (most Unis have Travel Clubs). When I was in High School, I had the opportunity to take a ten day tour to Hong Kong and Mainland China for about $2000 during Spring Break as part of a package tour. We had 2 under the cut-off, but the agent stated that he would still give us the package rate (especially since we were to be meeting with a BC Girl's School at Vancouver International). I never went...much to my regret, because a parent in another School Division whined about how SHE couldn't afford to send her kids out of the City, so why should anyone else? If it weren't for the fact we were departing Thursday Evening and returning Monday Morning, we could have done it, but because School Time would have been missed, we had to skip it. :(  You *might* have to put it off until late next semester...but 'luck! :D|`|Qr14YyFSaa	How about a little bit of both? You could travel to someplace besides Europe (maybe somewhere in Asia?) that is not as expensive and then put some money towards school. If you don't mind staying in hostels and traveling cheaply then that would definitely be an option. There was this guy that went around the world dancing (his videos are on youtube) and he also has a website. Europe is really expensive so I would save that for when you are older. Just a suggestion. However, if you want to stay in nice places I would go to Europe.

1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	First, keep in mind that there really aren't any jobs in astronomy or astrophysics if you don't have a PhD in the field - so plan to get one.  That's about 8-12 years of college, but if you really like the subject the last few years are a lot more fun than the first few (when you start actually doing research).     Take all the math and lab science you can while in high school - bio, chem, and especially physics.  You'll want to major in physics in college.  Astronomy, math, and computer science courses will be useful/required, but physics is essential for getting into grad school for astronomy or astrophysics.  If you can take calculus before you go to college, you'll save yourself about a year of work - because you need calculus to take the intro physics courses at the physics major level.  Not that you'll knock a year off your program, but you'll have more time to take the upper-level courses.|`|AA10691226	Focus on making A's in all the basics--literature, the sciences, mathematics, history and geography.

Now that's a tough one.    Why would someone want to stay in school and graduate, go on to college, get a degree and actually get a job making real money and being financially responsible?  That's just plain silly, isn't it?  Now, all smart-assiness (not a real word, but it gets my point across) aside, you work with college grads wherever it is you work (and I can figure out it's not a great place since you point out that they work there).  The only reason they are working there is because the economy sucks, and I can guarantee that once things pick up and people are hiring again, they are going to be out of there and you will be stuck.  Why?  Because they have the EDUCATION to go somewhere else and make a better life for themselves.  Once they do, they will be working their white collar jobs, pulling in decent money, buying houses, while you are still in that same place, making minimum wage or only slightly better, struggling  to make ends meet.  I have experience: I dropped out of school and couldn't get a job doing anything other than fast food.  I went back to college, got a degree, now I am making twice what I did at the restaurant, bought my own home and am 100% financially responsible for myself and my family.    EDIT:  OH PARDON ME!  Ok, so you work for a graphic design company making 6 figures with no diploma or GED.  Whose daddy do you know?  Let's say that you actually do work at such a place making that salary.  What happens if you get laid off?  Where are you going to find another job making that kind of money with no diploma?  When people with Masters degrees are flipping burgers, you are gonna be screwed.|`|MPvYodKdaa	The answers above have already mentioned the key points why dropping may be a bad thing, but really, school just isn't for everyone and society needs to learn and accept that.

Each classroom makes t-shirts (kids design and sign) and kids buy them for small profit. Bake sale, car wash. Kids get sponsors to donate money for how many laps they walk around the football field   Carnival-type games: some I thought were a bit unusual- 1) they set up a dog kennel fence for the "jail" You pay $1 to "arrest" someone, they have to pay $1 for "bond". They have coloring books, etc in the jail to make it fun. 2)Car Smash-  someone donates a junk car and you pay $5 to have 1 minute to smash it with a sledge hammer- googles and gloves are provided.     Also, hosting a big sporting event tv viewing (to bad SuperBowl is over) Usually school has projection tv- get lots of seating - donates snacks & drinks and charge admission     I know lots of people who would rather just give money than to buy the trinkets/gift wrap/magazines etc. Good luck!

You can start with Master's research (Thesis) in Genetic Engineering, and expand that research for your Ph.D. Some schools even have Genetic Engineering under Chemical Engineering. ( like here http://www.coe.neu.edu/gse/sc_che_cd.htm... )
FZKFLTyLaa	After 4 readings, I still find this question vague almost to the point of being unanswerable.

Good luck, those are hard to find. Just play the song WITH the drum track, why is that such a big problem? Everyone does it. Also, be more specific with your questions.

KfkmB4X2aa	http://jobsearch.about.com/od/resumes/p/...    You don't have to make work experience the focus, but it should be on there. If you're not satisfied with putting your office job on there, have you done any volunteer work?    Or try this one:  "A functional resume focuses on your skills and experience, rather than on your chronological work history. It is used most often by people who are changing careers or who have gaps in their employment history."

WSMEJgWVaa	What do you want to be?  That's the important question.  If you are a fighter pilot, you might die young, with or without glory.  The up side to that would be getting an adrenaline rush.  But you can play simulated pc games and achieve almost the same thing.  A doctor, on the other hand, would probably make you feel good about yourself.  The secretaries would all want to marry you and you would make lots of money.  The danger is maybe contracting a deadly disease from a patient.  Also, I guess they have to pay high insurance premiums against malpractice suits.  I think if you are good at math, chemistry and biology, you ought to study medicine.  But that is only my opinion.  Good luck with whatever you choose to be.|`|G1P4mPL0aa	This is up to you, random people can not choose your future for you. Think about it, what are you best at?

MuKNUlSraa	I strongly suggest that you consider taking AP Physics and AP Calculus, as they are considered to be the most challenging high school courses, and thus impressive to any admissions officer in any university Biochemistry doesn't seem so bad either, but then again, it would only give you an honors credit. However, it is all up to you, what classe you like, and what you can handle.|`|Z69OX0Gxaa	um those are really sucky choices. take it easy your senior year. take home ec.|`|hEFthejvaa	are you in high school? anyways, ap classes are fine if you're up for the challenge but remember senior year is supposed to be the year that you relax on classes & concentrate more on applying for schools.  if you have doubts that you will get at least a B of the ap classes then don't bother.  P.S. ap stats is easier than ap calculus. i took ap stats although it's boring all you do most of the time is use your calculator.
433571011989f7699b6947635139e845aa	The follow up can provide information that can help with finding more ways for the school to support and help your kids.  It may confirm the school and kids are doing fine and nothing else is needed.  It may say things are going great, but they may recomend more accomodations or supports that will do even more for your kids.  Getting input from someone not directly linked to the school system is never a bad idea.  As you've done so far, you can choose what suggestions to follow and what ones to leave to the side, but the information can prove helpful, especially when the time comes for new IEP's .  The school can't "punish" you or your kids if you choose not to have the recommended follow up, but it may make things a bit tougher later on if you feel they need more accomodations or want to change things in thier IEP's or behavioral programs.  Really, you have very little to loose in this situation and the possibility of gaining more services from the schools for the kids.|`|ORonhAuvaa	I would say, "Why waste the time?" If you don't follow the recommendations and they are doing well anyway, why bother? As their parent, you don't have to take them for the evaluation. Since these evaluations cost money to the school district, you may be missing out on something that could help in the future though.|`|EYU5ZZkgaa	Because the school is not paying for it, nothing at all will happen. I would urge the school to pay for it - if it is necessary, this is their job. Schools often take advantage of parents who don't know any better, but by law, it is their job to provide FAPE - a Free and Appropriate Public Education for all students. If this evaluation is necessary for your children s success, the school must provide this for free. They also must, by law evaluate your children for free if you give them written notice, with in 90 days. This is the law, visit http://www.wrightslaw.com/ for more information regarding special education and the law.    The situation is different if your children are in a private system. because of 504, the school must accommodate them for any disabilities they may have, but are not required to identify or evaluate them, in which case - you pay.    Like I said, not a lot will happen if you don't have a subsequent evaluation, but some things may NOT happen. Your children s progress may slow, because their needs change, especially if it has been more than three years. A child's brain is constantly growing and changing, and it is very easy to see how one learns from these evaluations. With out them, the school may no longer be providing the right type of education.    If you are outside the states, let me know where you are, I might still be able to help, as I am not from the states either.    I hope your five year old is in speech therapy for his speech delay. And where as your seven year old may not need another psycho-educational assessment, I would have s/he see a psychologist to work on self esteem and confidence building activities, as well as talking about emotions and how to handle them. The reason I say this, is because children with learning disabilities tend to have issues in these areas, and as the school material gets harder, the issues may become more intense. Also emotional and self esteem disorders can also impact learning, and will make it even harder for your child to reach his or her full potential.    If you are dissatisfied with your previous psychologist, definitely find another.    Good luck. If you have any more questions fell free to email me.
2da2605ab6af912e4a2d7b47fa41d3f2aa	Hi Lee,    Yes, you can. I did my first at Bath uni and my masters at Portsmouth.    As long as the admissions tutor or Programme Director for the PhD are happy with your research proposal. I cannot see why not unless places are limited.    Good luck.|`|AA11916936	theoretically, yes, it depends on if your existing qualifications are enough to get you on a PhD at Cambridge. To clarify, you don't have to have done an MSc to do a PhD, and you don't have to have done them at Cambridge, it will come down to if you have the right quals to embark on the PhD you have applied for.

MuKNUlSraa	Ok , I just finished reading this, and the first impression that I got, was that you were completely innocent. So here is my advice, why don't you try to show the dean what you have written in here, to make it more believable, and not like your just making it all up. He will understand, because it shows your willingness to be honest and professional, (as you mentioned earlier), as well as your hesitation to create trouble.

I believe that Anesthesiologists will be the longest and ER docs will be the shortest.  But I do not have exact numbers.
shVgCizBaa	Dear John letter    The term "Dear John letter" refers to a letter written by a woman to her husband or boyfriend to inform him their relationship is over, usually because she has found another man. Dear John Letters are often written out of an inability or unwillingness to inform the man in person.       Origins  While the exact origins of the phrase are unknown, it is commonly believed to have been coined by Americans during World War II. Large numbers of American troops were stationed overseas for many months or years, and as time passed many of their wives or girlfriends decided to begin a relationship with a new man rather than wait for their old one to return.    As letters to servicemen from wives or girlfriends back home would typically contain affectionate language, a serviceman receiving a note beginning with a curt "Dear John" (as opposed to the expected "Dear Johnny", "My dearest John", or simply "Darling", for example) would instantly be aware of the letter's purpose.    A writer in the Democrat and Chronicle of Rochester, NY, summed it up in August 1945:    "Dear John," the letter began. "I have found someone else whom I think the world of. I think the only way out is for us to get a divorce," it said. They usually began like that, those letters that told of infidelity on the part of the wives of servicemen... The men called them "Dear Johns".    There are a number of theories on why the name John is used rather than any other. John was a common name in America at the time the term was coined. John is also the name used in many other terms that refer to an anonymous man or men, such as "John Doe" or "John Smith".    A signature is often referred to as a John Hancock. "When Johnny comes marching home" was a popular song during the war. Further, there existed prior to World War II a radio program starring Irene Rich which was presented as a letter written by a gossipy female character to her never-identified romantic interest. It was both titled and opened with the words "Dear John", and may have contributed to the genesis of the term.    Women as well have come to be subjected to such impersonal break-up letters; these are referred to as "Dear Jane" letters.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dear_John_l...|`|ip5EWw7uaa	What soldiers received when their gf had found someone new at home.|`|HaVPD1qfaa	Girls breaking up with their soldier boyfriends|`|AWm2zhyLaa	from women sending letters to their boyfriend away in the military to break up with them.

But yes, your sentence is grammatically correct, although it works better the other way.|`|t79pLOCUaa	Seems fine to me.|`|TWKIuTEyaa	The sentence contains a contraction ('what's')    If you are writing direct speech (reporting what is actually said) then it is grammatically correct.    If you are not then it is incorrect. You should write 'What is your intention in saying that?'    Contractions are not correct in formal writing.

07331e407d1b62a62ce26132877e535baa	LOLLYGAG: . . . . to "lollygag" is to dawdle, fool around, and just generally do everything except what you should be doing. As a verb, "lollygag" (or "lallygag") dates back to around 1869, and a noun form, meaning "nonsense" or "foolishness," showed up a bit earlier, around 1862.   Unfortunately, the origin of "lollygag" is unknown, but there are clues from which we may, perhaps, be able to extrapolate the roots of "lollygag." ("Extrapolate" in this context, by the way, is a fancy word for "guess.")   First up in the batting order of possible "lollygag" clues is "loll," which is a very old word originally meaning "to droop or dangle." We use "loll" today to mean to relax or pass time idly, the sort of behavior that vacations are designed to encourage. There seems to be a plausible connection between this "utterly relaxed" meaning of "loll" and the "wasting time" sense of "lollygag."   Another bit of evidence might be found in the fact that "to loll" also means to let your tongue hang out, and that "lolly" is an English slang term for tongue (quite possibly the source of the name of our friend the lollipop, by the way). Perhaps "lollygagging" arose from the perception that lazy lollygaggers were adept at exercising only one muscle -- their tongues.|`|bdf63ca83c8092368975c9b64f0d0448aa	hehe it's a country word..meaning to take your time..or waste time..i don't really know the orgin just been using it ALL my life|`|AA10958400	http://www.wordorigins.org/|`|AA11110297	To waste time by puttering aimlessly; dawdle    www.answers.com   origin is unknown

Con mas razon tener chorizos era tener que comer y tener guardados mucho ms y mucho mucho mas tener chorizos de sobra para atar un perro (con lo rico que son).
5967d2200af4036338c16013bbe85492aa	Opina la Real Academia Espa?ola    Segn el Esbozo de una Nueva Gramtica de la Lengua Espa?ola, ?imprimir? pertenece al grupo de los verbos que poseen un doble participio: uno regular, ?imprimido? y otro irregular, ?impreso?.    ?Junto a algunos de los participios fuertes (impreso, en este caso), hay un participio dbil, en general de creacin romance?, se?ala el Esbozo y ejemplifica con los verbos, ?provisto y proveer; preso y prendido; frito y fredo; impreso e imprimido?.    En algunos casos, el participio dbil elimina al fuerte, como arrepentido a repiso o bien lo relega a la condicin de adjetivo, como el caso de abstrado a abstracto; concluido a concluso y convencido a convicto.    En el caso de ?imprimir?, la Real Academia Espa?ola establece que ambos participios se pueden usar indistintamente en la formacin de los tiempos compuestos, si bien la forma ?impreso? parece gozar hoy de cierta preferencia.    Son, por lo tanto y segn la RAE, igualmente correctas las frases ? He impreso el documento? y ? He imprimido el documento?.

zgTsCicNaa	According to book Dictionary of Word and Phrase Origins (1988), author William Morris writes that Stanley Woodward actually took the term from fellow New York Tribune sportswriter Caswell Adams. Morris writes that during the 1930s, the Fordham University football team was running roughshod over all its opponents. One day in the sports room at the Tribune, the merits of Fordham's football team were being compared to Princeton and Columbia. Adams remarked disparagingly of the latter two, saying they were "only Ivy League." Woodward, the sports editor of the Tribune, picked up the term and printed the next day.    Note though that in the above quote Woodward used the term ivy college, not ivy league as Adams is said to have used, so there is a discrepancy in this theory, although it seems certain the term ivy college and shortly later Ivy League acquired its name from the sports world.    The first known instance of the term Ivy League being used appeared in the Christian Science Monitor on February 7, 1935 Several sports-writers and other journalists used the term shortly later to refer to the older colleges, those along the northeastern seaboard of the United States, chiefly the nine institutions with origins dating from the colonial era, together with the United States Military Academy (West Point), the United States Naval Academy, and a few others. These schools were known for their long-standing traditions in intercollegiate athletics, often being the first schools to participate in such activities. However, at this time, none of these institutions would make efforts to form an athletic league.     The Ivy League's name derives from the ivy plants, symbolic of their age, that cover many of these institutions' historic buildings. The Ivy League universities are also called the "Ancient Eight" or simply the Ivies.    A common folk etymology attributes the name to the Roman numerals for four (IV), asserting that there was such a sports league originally with four members. The Morris Dictionary of Word and Phrase Origins helped to perpetuate this belief. The supposed "IV League" was formed over a century ago and consisted of Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and a 4th school that varies depending on who is telling the story.    However, representatives from four schools, Rutgers, Princeton, Yale and Columbia met at the Fifth Avenue Hotel in Manhattan on October 19, 1873 to establish a set of rules governing their intercollegiate athletic competition, and particularly to codify the new game of college football (which at the time, largely resembled what is currently called rugby). Though invited, Harvard chose not to attend. While no formal organization or conference was established, the results of this meeting governed athletic events between these schools well into the twentieth century.    ?|`|BJERgbM5aa	In the contex that you ask, there is no relation between poison ivy and ivy.  The colleges are nicknamed ivy league because:  Ivy represents perpetual growth.  If you will notice the older brick buildings of all the "ivy league" schools, they all have extensive amounts of ivy growing up and around them.  They're green, lush, and signifies intellectual growth. Enough said.

The first book is very long and about people and their struggles during the Civil War.  The heroine is 'Scarett O'Hara.'      The second book is a childhood favorite published in my day by 'Golden Books.'  You could write in your book report how a little engine who kept saying, 'I think I Can' over and over again when he ws tryhing to climb a hill succeeded eventually and link that with Scarlett O'Hara who never gave up on her homestead 'Tara,' or her pursuit of 'Ashley Wilkes' in spite of the fact that 'Rett Butler' was in reality more suited to her.     Look it up on the Internet, buy the Cliff Notes for 'Gone With The Wind,' as it is a long book.  Don't just go by the movie, the teacher will know as ther are things in the book that were left out in the movie.  Don't panic, simply keep in mind that this is not brain surgery, and you don't have to reinvent the wheel or make a new receipe for bread, you simply have to slice it.

You can find the requirements for your state at:  http://nrckids.org/STATES/states.htm    Generally, if you have a degree in early childhood education or a related field, you would not need a CDA.  A CDA is usually a way of getting great early childhood training "on the job".  Some community colleges will even allow you to apply your CDA toward an Associate's Degree.    In my case, I have a BS in Elementary Education and was able to take just a few more classes specific to early childhood/program management to get my certification.

JGpirCtLaa	NO!  You have to wash your clothes more often.  It costs MORE b/c you have to buy regular clothes & uniforms.  Idk why people think it costs less, these people must be wearing or dressing their kids in uniforms every day of their lives. They do need normal clothes for after school & weekends & winter, summer, spring break.  It takes away freedom of expression.  They're UGLY!  Everyone looks the same.  In America, we're supposed to be known for being different, everyone being different. But we're turning it around so that all kids are the same? What kind of message does that send to kids? It sends the message that everyone is supposed to look alike, that everyone is supposed to act alike, that we are basically supposed to be robots with no thought or personality.    I hate pointless rules, so I personally would do everything in my power to piss the school off. I would wear it too tight, too high, too low cut, wear tons of accessories to cover it. =) So no. Kids will rebel. And hate the school, instead of wanting to go and get an education.|`|xpiGWrdMaa	Well since students are killing each other over tennis shoes then it seems like the appropriate thing to do.|`|eQaApazjaa	i mean it depends. if its a private school then i guess because after all ur paying the school for an education so they should like have the right to require uniforms or not.     otherwise no...clothes makes a person unique..even though uniforms can save a family a lot of money && its easier in the morning it still gets annoying. imagine having to wear the same uniform day after day for a few years? thats annoying. and u cant stand out and be urself in a uniform.    i think its ok to require a student to wear like the schools colors for example a polo or a skirt but everything else should be allowed|`|ot8tImmcaa	no the only thing they need is a dress code. no one wants to look like another person everyday|`|sAqPjKszaa	A uniform stops a person from being unique and creative.  No one likes a uniform even if it's a nice one because they will look like everybody else.|`|AA11042354	Individuality:    Supressing individuality is the most commonly cited objection to school uniforms. Educators argue that an academic program encouraging students to pursue individual thought is much more important than what they wear. They inhibit creativity and self-expression, forcing students to conform.    Causes Discipline Problems:    Some students reject any rules. Forcing them to wear school uniforms only aggravates their rebelious spirit. They alter their school uniform by tightening, widening, shortening, or lengthening them, and teachers are given the impossible task of policing the students on a daily basis.    Little or No Relationship to Academics:    Opponents insist that their is no credible evidence that school uniforms improve school discipline or promote higher academic acheivement. The principal argument is that some great students are terrible dressers. Dress does not necessarily improve learning.|`|0e41a4749e1ba186aebb9d38fb66cf58aa	YES YES YES YES YES YES!!!!!!!!!!!!

lH9yrpeyaa	Well...  Middle age art usually depicted religious themes that tended to not be in correct proportion...  Northern Renassiance art, like in Italy, tended to have more secular based themes, that used humanist themes in them. For example, one theme of humanism is the belief in the dignity of man, so they would tend to put more emphasis on the human emotion/faces.  Another theme was education and civic virtue.. these themes would be shown through objects in the paintings such as books/fancy clothes..  Some important paintings are:  Raphael's School of Athens, as well as his self portrait.  Also the bronze statue of david by... donatello.    Speaking of the David.  Donatello created the first free standing bronze statue since Antiquity (ancient Rome). I guess this skill was somehow lost, but with the Renaissance and rebirth of Greek/Roman values, it was rediscovered.  Another version of David was done by Michaelangelo (I'm pretty sure) but was made of marble.    The Last Supper was done by um... Da Vinci?? i guess they would differ dependening on their depictions of Christ, or how one was painted in a nunnery then removed... sorry. not to sure.    The Medici family was a banker family with huge amounts of wealth.  They were patrons of the arts, meaning they employed painters to paint paintings for them.    Martin Luther objected indulgences led to the Reformation b/c it showed the umm.. wrongs of the Catholic Church. He gained supporters and created his own protestant religion- Lutheranism.  Henry the 8th wanted an annlument to his marriage.. pope wouldn't grant it because of some spiritual reason, so henry issued the Act of Supremacy, breaking england from the catholic church and establishing england's offiical religion- Anglican.    Themes of Renassiance art.. dignity of man, civic virtue, education..    And for more information on the arts, try googling "Olgas Art Gallery" or somethign like that. I know they have tons of pictures with descriptions of them and in al types of periods of history.|`|1e5523b91684d9e2d724ebb0f10a647aaa	Try your textbooks, they were assigned to you for a reason.

What is most important to remember is that you don't need to know, at least not now. Most people change careers at many times during their lives anyway, so don't think of it as "what do I want to do for the rest of my life?" Think of it as 'What am I interested in right now?"     Go to a four year school that emphasizes the liberal arts. The variety of classes will help you find out what you're interested in and give you the opportunity  to participate in extracurriculars that will help you define your interests. Ultimately, the jobs you end up in may not have anything to do with your degree anyway. This is a fact of life nowadays, but not a bad one. The modern workforce is surprisingly flexible, allowing people to change careers as they change interests.

AA11519518	This "company" looks highly dubious. A search for the domain name lcnrnurse.com currently finds but a single hit: Your question on Yahoo answers!

We can conclude that this "college" appears to have no offices of their own!    A search for "LONDON COLLEGE OF NURSING & RESEARCH" doesn't find any hits on this company.    A colleague of mine made a few phone calls and neither the BMA, the Royal College of Nursing, nor the Nursing and Midwifery Council have ever heard of them.    A Google search for "Sir Henry Trotman", listed as their vice chancellor on their website, yields no results. This name is also used in their domain registration.     Incidentally, their website was only created late last year (25 Nov 2005) and was only registered for a single year. It is not a .uk web address, which is a little unusual for a UK company or institution.    I have been informed that they demand a prepayment of 300 (appr. US$500) to the following bank account from job applicants:    LCNR BANK ACCOUNT DETAILS    NAME OF THE ACCOUNT: - 'LCNR'  INTERNATIONAL BANK ACCOUNT NUMBER (IBAN) NO: -GB14MIDL40252771781464.  BRANCH IDENTIFIER CODE: - MIDLGB2104V   SWIFT CODE: - MIDLGB22.  NAME OF THE BANK:'HSBC'  SORT CODE: -40-25-27.  ACCOUNT NO: - 71781464.  BRANCH: - ILFORD, ESSEX, U.K.    Note that the bank account is in the name of a four character acronym, not a full company name with "Ltd" or "Plc" to indicate a limited liability company. The Bank account is in Essex, while the company is supposed to be based in Buckinghamshire. This makes no sense at all.    I definitely would not recommend sending any money to them unless you can still confirm that this is a real company. From my research it appears that it is not. It looks like a scam.

Good Luck!!!|`|AA10759102	was a period in United States history, 18631877, that resolved the issues of the American Civil War when both the Confederacy and its system of slavery were destroyed. The period of Reconstruction addressed the return of the southern states that had seceded, the status of ex-Confederate leaders, and the integration of the African-American Freedmen into the legal, political, economic and social system. Violent controversy arose over how to accomplish those tasks. Reconstruction began as soon as the Union armies conquered significant stretches of Confederate territory in 1862.[1]    Republican leaders agreed that slavery and the Slave Power had to be permanently destroyed, and all forms of Confederate nationalism had to be suppressed. Moderates said this could be easily accomplished as soon as Confederate armies surrendered and the southern states repealed secession and ratified the 13th Amendment  all of which happened by September 1865.    President Abraham Lincoln was the leader of the moderate Republicans and wanted to speed up Reconstruction and reunite the nation as soon as possible. Lincoln formally began Reconstruction in late 1863 with his Ten percent plan, which went into operation in several states but which Radicals opposed. Lincoln vetoed the Radical plan, the Wade-Davis Act of 1864. The opposing faction of Radical Republicans were much more skeptical of southern intentions and demanded far more stringent federal action. Congressman Thaddeus Stevens and Senator Charles Sumner led the Radical Republicans. After Lincoln's assassination, President Andrew Johnson switched from the Radical to the moderate camp. He too favored voting rights for veterans of the United States Colored Troops. By 1866, however, Johnson, with no party affiliation, broke with the moderate Republicans and aligned himself more with the Democrats who opposed equality and the Fourteenth Amendment. Radicals attacked the policies of Johnson, especially his veto of the Civil Rights Bill for the Freedmen.    The election of 1866 decisively changed the balance of power, giving the Radicals control of Congress and enough votes to overcome Johnson's vetoes and even to try to impeach him. Johnson was acquitted by one vote, but remained almost powerless regarding Reconstruction policy. Radicals used the Army to take over the South and give the vote to black men, and took the vote away from an estimated 10,000 or 15,000 white men who had been Confederate officials or senior officers. The Radical stage lasted for varying lengths in the different states, where a Republican coalition of Freedmen, Scalawags and Carpetbaggers took control and promoted modernization through railroads and public schools. They were charged with corruption by their opponents, the conservativeDemocratic coalition, calling themselves "Redeemers" after 1870. Violence sponsored by the Ku Klux Klan was overcome by federal intervention.    By 1877, however, Redeemers regained control of every state, and President Rutherford Hayes withdrew federal troops, causing the collapse of the remaining three Republican state governments. The 13th, 14th and 15th amendments were permanent legacies. Bitterness from the heated partisanship of the era lasted well into the 20th century.|`|42e664f6ea292376ef511acf0e23c461aa	Reconstruction isn't exactly considered a sucess in US History.

Frankly, I don't see anything wrong with the sentence. using "nor" in that context is perfectly acceptable to me.     Remember, the grammar checker in Word is basing it's error on perhaps a common usage based on a specific set of words or terms being in the sentence. You can safely ignore it.    Just for fun, however, try changing the first sentence from "I will never forget the debates" to "I will forget neither the debates" as see what Word says about that. My guess is that it passes.

Only because doing so will help you figure out if you really like them, and if you do enjoy it you then have contacts which will help out in your future if you want to get a job in that area.    With a job in software engineering or geology I'm very sure you'll be able to afford all the make-up you want. Plus if any of your mates work in the other stores they should be able to score you some stuff too ;)    Whatever you choose, I hope you have fun :)
AA10276327	A Child in Need of Services (CHINS) matter is a court case in which the Juvenile Court tries to help parents and school officials deal with troubled youth.    Are you sure you don't mean "filed" instead of fined?    http://masslegalhelp.org/children-and-fa...
MiDYJ8tMaa	Yes, it is correct. The part set off by commas is called a parenthetical expression. It stands by itself and does not influence the rest of the sentence.     There's nothing wrong with having a conjunction as the first word of a sentence. That frequently happens when clauses are used in inverted order as is the case here.     There are differences in Australian/Canadian/UK grammar and punctuation, but they rarely cause any problems. You've hit on spelling differences - honor/honour, stabilise/stabilize, defense/defence.    A couple of others come to mind:     US always treats collective nouns (team, jury, staff) as singular. Others will treat as either singular or plural - plural when the members are acting individually - The staff are at lunch.    US always puts commas and periods (or 'full stops', another difference) inside quotation marks. Others put inside if part of the quote; otherwise outside.     There are really no major differences.|`|TWKIuTEyaa	I think there is very little, if any, difference between US/UK/Australian punctuation and grammar. Their main differences lie in spelling.    'Skate' is correct, as the sentence subject is Patricia.    However, you may be pleased to know that the sentence is not grammatically correct. It begins with 'because' which, along with 'and', 'so' and 'but' , cannot be used to begin sentences (if one is being strictly grammatical).    The sentence should begin with 'As she she enjoys the exercise....' if it is to be correct.|`|K5uoaetaaa	Patricia is the subject of the sentence, so skates is correct.  Can't answer the second part as I am English.|`|x2iP0tKraa	There is no difference between Australian and American grammar as far as the usage of punctuation is concerned.    The easy way to determine verb form is to remove the dependent clause from the sentence and read it that way:    "Because she enjoys the exercise, Patricia [...] skates every Friday morning."    The "along with several of her friends" adds information to the sentence but does not alter its meaning in any way.  It is therefore a dependent clause, and does not affect its overall verb form or tense.    Patricia skates.|`|Ze25ovEiaa	Skates sounds right to me..   Not sure if there's much difference between AUS and US punctuation and grammar though, sorry|`|JSunIpPRaa	How you would figure this out is to remove what is in between the commas. so the subject and verb are 'Patricia skates.' 'Along with several of her friends' is a prepositional phrase, which can never be the subject of a sentence.
pdbc4souaa	That is five questions in one sentence. I believe that ties the Y!A record. Would you be so kind to give us a general topic?  Some icy rock in the research universe where we can start?    P lease understand that our motivation here is that elusive, random and worthless ten points plus that phrase from the psych lab [functional autonomy] that means the rat will eventually run the maze whether he gets the reward or not.    I could simplify the structure of that sentence, but I am following your lead.
dDZ42kDKaa	I had the same experience in university. I never completely overcame it, but I learned what worked for me. I realized there are certain times of the day when I'm more productive (in my case, midnight to 4 AM) and times when I can't focus on anything (around dinner time.) So I planned my day so I was awake and studying during my productive time and I was out and social during my unfocused time.    It might also help to figure out what's distracting you. I'm all about my computer, so I turned off my computer when I was studying. When I was living in residence, I went to the library to study - most libraries have little study carrels far away from any computers, if that's what distracts you - and when I lived on my own, I studied in the living room (my computer was in my bedroom.) If it's your phone that's distracting, turn it off (or unplug it if you're old-school) and put it in a different room or under a pillow if it's still tempting.    Another thing - there's no rule that says you have to do all your studying in one big chunk. If you tell yourself "I'm going to do homework for 3 hours," you're not going to want to do it. So maybe break it up - 15 minutes of homework, then 5 minutes of MSN, then half an hour of homework, a 10-minute walk, and so on. A timer can be helpful if you break it up like this - you'll be surprised how quickly 15 minutes of reading can go by.    Also, university textbooks are generally written by people who live in some alternate universe where everyone is absolutely fascinated with what they're writing about, so they don't have to make it interesting for people to read it. Unfortunately, this means that their work is the driest of dry reading. Try breaking it up into chunks and experiment with different ways of absorbing the information - I'm very visual, so I did a lot of highlighting, and I used to read a chunk of information, paraphrase it in one sentence and write it down. If you're a more auditory learner, maybe paraphrase it out loud? Find a way of absorbing the information that works with your learning style, because odds are you aren't going to gain much from just reading the readings.    In class, leave as many distractions as you can at home or in your backpack. You don't need to have your phone in your pocket, because you'll probably end up texting someone as your prof tells you the one super-crucial thing about the exam. If you tend to fall asleep in class (I did,) try sitting in the front - I worked harder at staying awake when I knew that the prof would see me if I slept. I didn't want to hurt their feelings, so I stayed more alert during classes.    Anyway, that's all I can think of off the top of my head. Best of luck!|`|AjqO1aJgaa	Because you choose to be.

(also the girl could be afraid she mistook a girl for a boy... two earrings = girl, one = boy).|`|a20KcBqdaa	erm, for the first question, in church we pass around a COLLECTION plate, not a correction plate. basically it is to give money to the church, because they do not get much money from any other means. i dont know why this cartoon had CORRECTION plate i'm afraid. sorry.<br>  <br>  as for the earrings, well i dont really understand it either. one earing on a guy is meant to look 'cool'. i dont know why. two earrings, i suppose, makes a guy look too feminine. i dont like the idea of getting my ears pierced in the first place anyway.<br>  <br>  hope this helped.|`|YvzcVxuFaa	I'm not really sure about the first one but for the girl worrying that the boy is wearing 2 earings she could be worried he is hoomosexual or bi-sexual, i've heard that guys who wear 2 earings or wear it in the wrong ear that it can mean a guy is homosexual / bi-sexual|`|iQ7ubBAfaa	in churches, a COLLECTION plate is passed around so people can donate money to the running of the church<br>  <br>  the person has mis-heard the name of the COLLECTION plate, thinking it a CORRECTION plate, which implies you have to pay for making mistakes|`|a7d02bc09dd11ed5071621f15c650041aa	The first one is a sort of play on words.

That's kind of outdated though, because now lots of men have both ears pierced.|`|RtrqOqosaa	in church, people pass out COLLECTION PLATES and they are used to collect money..... so since he thought it was a correction plate, he thought people were making mistakes....<br>  please vote as best answer!! :) thanks!|`|fULZei1haa	In church, we pass a COLLECTION plate, which is an offering.  people are expected to put money in it to help fund the church and it's ministries.  I would guess that by calling it a correction plate, they are referring to how the church is always telling people they are making mistakes?<br>  <br>  Sometimes, if someone wears 2 earings, that could mean they are gay.  But lots of guys have two earings just because they like it, so it is really just a stereotype.|`|qKA05EQTaa	They were just showing how children see things "kids say the darndest things" the child may have been thinking when you pay in the plate it corrects your sins maybee. children mispronounce things all the time and see things different than adults do, they may not understand adult things. my daughter used to call a bikini a zuchini  and tell me she wanted to play the game in the bathroom (tampon machine) we just laugh at what kids say. they are funny*<br>  maybee wearing 2 earrings means you are gay , i always though that the left ear meant the man was gay. i am kinda stumped on that one|`|TBbhmZEwaa	the kid think that the collection plate (a plate that is passed around to gather money donations) is called a correction plate.<br>  two earrings means bisexual, or someone who likes members of both sexes. I hope that this helps!|`|NnFltKgsaa	From the mouths of babes is the lesson here. the Collection plate is given around for tithes or payment to the church. the reference here is comparing the correction plate to the confessional, no matter what you do wrong or against the church a little money and absolution with a hail mary or two and record is cleared,|`|AA11401784	The correction plate is the child misinterpreting the name. It's actually the collection plate - they are take a collection of donations to the church funds.

Probably, she thought that two earrings indicated that he might be a homosexual.<br>  <br>  - Stuart|`|Kf7l3aYuaa	The collection plate.  The boy is referring to the collection plate and when people put money in the are tithing ten percent of their income in the hope they will be forgiven their sins by God.  So, it seems to me that the people are the ones making the mistakes.<br>  <br>  It is extremely unusual for men to where two earrings; women do that and she is worried about it because of the possibility the man is homosexual.|`|oubC3TCOaa	-You meant a COLLECTION PLATE?<br>  That is used for the church members to place their money. It's like a money basket so then the owner of the church can later use it to pay the church's bills. Such as maintenance, light, water or rights.<br>  <br>  -Maybe the girl was worried because guys are not supposed to wear two earrings, or else they will be considered gay.<br>  If the guy was wearing one earring, it is considered "acceptable".|`|n9vByQgdaa	Its supposed to be collection plate, its where people donate money to the church.<br>  <br>  Also the 2 earrings thing: When a boy wheres 2 earrings it signifies that hes homosexual, although this isn't always true.

TNTFomKeaa	College isn't like high school. You are much more independent. You choose what courses you want to take - you will have to take some GE's, but mostly it is up to you. You will have a lot more free time that you will have to manage yourself for study, sports, relaxation etc. You are responsible for your own studies - either you do it or you don't. It's your problem, not your teacher's. <br>  Classes can be from 50 minutes to several hours long. It depends on the subject. I take literature which ranges from 50 minutes to 1hour and a half, but if you have labs or things like that they might go on for much longer.<br>  You might have to run to your next class if you plan two back to back, but you plan your own schedule, so you might have several hours in between. I would expect to have about 12-16 hours in class a week, although this depends on your major. The rest of the time you study independently, reading, doing research etc.<br>  There are usually on campus dining facilities, and if you live in dorms you will probably be expected to eat some of your meals there. But there is a lot of choice. You will probably also have a food court - my campus had Subway, Burger King, Tapioca Express, Royal India, Panda Express, Rubios... It's up to you. You can always go home and cook, or eat off campus if you prefer. It also depends on how you planned your schedule. You eat lunch when you have free time. There's no set mealtime. Of course, this is all part of the college experience and challenge. You are looking after yourself without your parents around. Perhaps you've heard of the "freshman fifteen"? This is the average weight gain of the college freshman who eats as much junk food as they like when their parents don't stop them. Best to bring a cookbook to college with you, and educate yourself about healthy choices.<br>  The teachers, at least in my experience, were great. They want you to succeed - apart from anything else, it looks good for them if you do well. They have office hours every week, which you should use to go and talk to them about the classwork and any difficulties your having. I also found it useful to run paper ideas by them, that kind of thing as well. If people say their teacher is mean, they usually mean that they didn't do the work and the teacher wouldn't give them a free ride. College instructors in general are tough but fair. Do the work and you will be fine. If you have a problem, ask sooner rather than later and they will definitely help you. <br>  I wouldn't say the homework is particularly hard or easy. It's challenging, for sure, but it's also interesting and what you want to do. You did pick this major, after all. Some subjects won't have homework, but you will have to study for exams. Other subjects won't have exams but you will have a lot of papers to write. Get a planner and write down all your deadlines at the beginning of the quarter so that you can get organized. Plan ahead to get the work done, and leave time to ask for help if you need it. Learn to use the library right away. The librarian is your new best friend, and he/she can really help you impress your teachers.<br>  Normally you take three to five classes each semester/quarter, and each class meets two or three times a week. This varies with school, major and how many credits the class is worth, of course. I had class for 1-3 hours each day on average. Then you should spend twice as much time studying for each class as you actually spend in class. This means doing assigned reading, reading around your subject, taking notes from your reading, reviewing notes from class, going to office hours and reviews, revising important material... If you're not sure how you should be spending this time for a particular class, ask your teacher right away. They will tell you what to do to get an A in their class, and they will think you're smart for asking the question rather than doing nothing and failing the class.<br>  You'll probably want to fit some sport and recreation into your timetable as well. Most colleges have amazing facilities and classes you can take at subsidized prices. This is a fantastic opportunity to try something new and meet new friends as well as to maybe compete in your favorite sport. You can also avoid the dreaded freshman fifteen!<br>  Why not go to some college open days? You can look around the campus and talk to students that are already there, and find out about their experiences. This will also give you some ideas what to look for when the time comes to apply for college yourself.<br>  I hope this helps, and good luck!|`|lNsr26oIaa	College is not much like High School. You have more freedom in college...and more responsibility. <br>  <br>  At my college, MWF classes are usually 1 hr and 15 minutes. TTH classes are usually 1 hr 45 mins with a short break in the middle of class. The time between class depends on what courses you are taking. You choose that with your advisor according to your program. But, we get at least 15 minutes between each class. <br>  <br>  How many classes you take in a day and how many hours depends on what you are taking. Usually you take 4-5 classes each semester or quarter. My average week- on MWF I go to one class 9-10:45. On Tues and Thurs, I have a class at 10-11:45, 12:30-1:45 and 5:30-6:45. The night class is unusual. <br>  <br>  You can eat on campus or off campus. <br>  <br>  Some teachers are really cool. Some are complete jerks. Some care a great deal, some don't care. That's not much different from HS. I like my college professors more than most of my HS teachers, though. <br>  <br>  The homework is probably less than in High School. Its not too difficult if you go to class and listen. <br>  <br>  My average class size is 12-25. Some are smaller. I was in one class with just two students. In your freshman year, there are large auditorium classes with 100 or more people. I've never heard of 600+ people, but there may well be that many at a much larger university than mine. <br>  <br>  You should ask your parents to take you to a local university this summer for a tour. Its never to early to start checking things out. They may let you sit in on a class if you ask ahead of time.|`|dQmPttFfaa	im in high school (senior) and i have heard that college is nothing like high school, your more independent and the classes are like 1 to 2 hours long. the teachers dont really care about you and there are alot of students in one class approx. 600 to 1000 students per class. but dont get scared because you can find friends that can help you.|`|AA11926698	College is nothing like high school.. I am a sophomore in college.  The class lengths just depend on the class itsself..For Example this semester I am taking 4 classes.  I have Bio Lab on Monday from 9 - 12.   Then Tuesday  and ThursdayI have  Eng 9 - 10.30 then sociopsych from 10.30 to 12  then Bio lecture from 1-2.30 and Developmental psych online. I dont have class on Wednesday or Friday so its nice.  the teachers usually let u out 15 minutes before class ends to let you get to your next class.  The teachers are pretty good in my opinion.  and no they are not mean at all.  IMO they are nicer than high school teachers.  The homework isnt hard but really in my classes my only grades are our 4 tests. I mean you have homework but in my classes they dont really take it up.  If you have any more questions feel free to ask.

Once a member, then identify a new community service project and run that activity.  Write your own news article on that project and submit it to your local newspaper.  With all the cut-back in staffing at newspapers, you are very likely to get your article published.  <br>  <br>  Say you are a member of Kiwanis.  Then submit the same article to Kiwanis International for publication in their magazine where other clubs might read and copy what you have started.<br>  <br>  Kiwanis. Rotary, and other service or civic organizations provide scholarships for college.  You might qualify for one.<br>  <br>  Doing this type of service project shows you have the ability to identify "community needs", solicit resources, gather community support, and pull off the project.  You also documented these activities so it would be aduplicability project - something that other people could use to benefit from your experience. All of which makes you to be seen as a civic minded leader.<br>  <br>  Also, companies like Kohl's and Best Buy provide scholarships to people under the age of 21 (Kohl's as young as 13), based upon that person's civic involvement.  Best Buy requires a one page essay on "What I Have Learn by Doing Civic Activities" - for up to $25,000 in scholarships.

It doesn't pay much, but it would be great fun and show leadership as well as your ability to work in a team with different people. <br>  Talk to a careers counselor at your school if you're still not sure. I hope this helped!|`|80e9b302f1ee300cac6fea79c460458faa	Would depend in part - on what you plan on majoring in.<br>  <br>  Like if you want to be a pharmacist, then go to a drug store and apply for a job.  Some of them will set you up for summer work programs and even help pay your tuition.  Of course, they would expect you to consider them as a possible employer when you get out.<br>  <br>  Try to find a company that you would like to work for after you get out of college.  Send them a nice letter telling of your plan and asking for a entry level summer job there.  If you get on, you may learn some interesting facts about your planned occupation.<br>  <br>  Many of the people I went to college with, did not work in the field of their major.  Some found out, they just didn't like the work.  If you can get on before college - great.  If not, also work with the college on any internships they might know of - in these, you might work in your field for an employer during the summer.  If you still love the work - great!  If you don't like the work, you still have time to change your college major before graduation.|`|qH2mTITnaa	well it depends on if you're a boy or a girl and what you want to study in college. if you're undecided on that or a girl or boy id say go into grounds keeping, work at a golf coarse or even just a restaurant|`|ZNe6B9TQaa	Any thing you can get!

Obama swoops in.... stops the war in Iraq... mends relationships with Iran and Pakistan to the point they give up Bin Laden....  then he flies off to Isreal and creates peace with the Palestinians and Isrealies..... everyone has a group hug.... he then goes back home... saves the big three through financial discipline courses..... confiscates their big corporate jets and uses them for himself.... then he stops dealing with China and India and forces Americans to buy local...which means walmart folds..... then the small guys come back and its back to family values....... you could really have fun with this.... use your imagination.... and in the end George Bush goes to a very hot tropical island where he has to live off the land because nobody wants him anywhere.....he is in exile for destroying America and with international tribunals... he has nowhere to hide..|`|umgrxflFaa	Ok i have a idea that might be good if its ok to make it a sort of comical thing :)<br>  Maybe the hero could be one of those sort of failing ones, that everyone sort of likes because they can laugh at him, but he doesnt really save the day, but another guy does.

hKP5sQewaa	The Human, it Evolved over time from Natural selection. <br>  This change occurred because they moved to a different area, and climate change, which caused there surroundings to change, which caused lots of us to die, at one point they think there were only 10 000 people alive, which would be enough to put us on the endangered species, So only the best lived. Only the ones that had what it took to live lived, so they had offspring which also had the genes of the successful survivors, this is evolution, over time it causes us to change. The Human body is far from perfect, but over time the human body has evolved from what it can.<br>  <br>  They descirbe it here, they describe how the human body is not perfect, and if you were to design us, you wouldn't design us the way we are now! But it shows how evolution has shaped out body's into the way it is now. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnCJqDa1us&feature=channel" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnCJqDa1...</a>|`|EZyHOht7aa	Humans.<br>  Animals.<br>  Plants.<br>  The layers of the earth.<br>  Planets.<br>  Basically everything.|`|FIXKYCIGaa	Religion.  The main faiths we know today only date back at most a few thousands years:  Judaism 4.000, Christianity 2.000, Islam 1.400.  However the concept of religion is much older going back at least 50.000 years.  No one knows the details but archeologists have found burial sights that suggest the belief in an afterlife.  They could have had multiple gods like the Greeks or the Romans.  The idea of a monotheistic god is one that developed, evolved, over time.

AA11735935	Questioning before accepting is a matter of checking how well the theory (or hypothesis, which is just a trial explanation) fits what we observe.  For example, a grammar (which is a description of the structure) should be able to produce grammatical utterances without producing ungrammatical ones.  An theory of economy should describe how people consume.  A theory should also have some predictive value.<br>  <br>  We base future decisions on the basis of our understanding of past happenings.  If we base our future actions on unquestioned, possibly invalid ways of thinking, we are risking getting ourselves into a very large whole from which we will have to dig ourselves out.|`|AA11988503	First of all, a theory is just a theory.

CEOFjMNyaa	You don't need to be a California resident to apply to a UC school or Cal State school. The UC system (with exception to Berkeley) all run on quarters and mid year transfers are rare. If by "next year" you mean 2009-2010 school year, the application date has already passed for UC schools. (November of the year before is when applications can be turned in via online form). If you are looking to go to a California school 2010-2011, then look into a UC school! <br>  <br>  Like other people have said before, you won't quality for in state tuition (so total school expenses will be around 40,000) since you aren't considered a "permanent" resident. I believe you'd quality as a resident after living here for 2 years? (I'm not sure) you'd then qualify for in state tuition (total school expenses including housing is around 20,000). <br>  <br>  Unless you have your eye set on a specific UC school, I would attend a private school that you get into, considering it's about the same price.<br>  <br>  USC is a private school and has a separate application process and doesn't have anything to do with the UC system. I am unsure of their application deadline.|`|U9bQgfY9aa	USC is a private school and its rules are not the same. As for the UC schools, you would likely NOT qualify for in state tuition rates.

2ea2a326e38ed3138fb39ac98c13e431aa	Yep.  That basically is it in a nutshell.  A "college" is one institute.  A university is a collection of colleges.  This is mainly for administrative and organizational purposes.  Colleges are typically smaller.  For example, one of the larger colleges in my area is Robert Morris College.  Even that is divided into different schools or institutes based on subject area.  Universities, such as State schools, have colleges: College of Education, College of Business, etc.  This division provides Deans, advisers, degree programs, and other divisions that are beneficial to larger schools.
