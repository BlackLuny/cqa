YYAu9lFDaa	the skin around the piercing is healing which is that white skin you're talking about... there's no harm in taking it off. just be careful not to touch your piercing or the area around it too much.|`|WIhev8ioaa	I'm pretty sure it will go away on its own, just don't touch it or anything|`|j1bHdQBSaa	You should probably get something for chapped lips or anything like that.

BcJpPMPFaa	Ok, here is my idea.  Go the rihanna look. Its classy and edgy, and really really cute.  heres a pic : http://media.photobucket.com/image/rihan...    and another http://media.photobucket.com/image/rihan...    Just use some friz serum while your hair is damp, blow dry it, straighten it, use some mouse(a very small amount), and run it through your straightened hair LIGHTLY. Let the mouse dry, and comb it, This should leav it shiny.  Tada!    It would suit your face and hair really well.    *Edit: I know your hair isn't as long as hers, so it will look a bit different, but it shoudl style have the same effect.    **Edit: I had another idea. What if you went the Jeniffer Hudson look  Heres a pic : http://media.photobucket.com/image/jenni...    Do the same as the rihanna loo,, but when you are done, instead of adding mouse, use sculpting gel to make the little wings. And while straightening it, flip the straightener out a little bit    Heres another pic : http://media.photobucket.com/image/jenni...|`|TWW5DGttaa	Hair accessories would look cute. You could straighten it and take your right front bangs and pull it back in a cute jeweled clip or a flower. Curls would look good too. Focus on doing something with your side part and bangs there's a lot of ways to frame your face with it. Just play with it a little Good Luck!|`|d0e1b5b2af884d02c8c1a86fcdf900caaa	I would get ahold of a very small curling iron and do tight little curls all over your head. I think you'd look good with curls.|`|enokoZ6Uaa	I think you should get some extensions added for fullness and then have your extensions cut into an asymmetrical bob with a big bang. You will to Fabulous! You don't have to get permanent extensions but please avoid bonding( the glue will kill your hair follicles) try a technique called meta links or just have about three or four tracks sewn in!
AA11552535	Well  it hard to get rid off..  but there is method to prevent it or prevent the smell  get good deodrants...  Roll ons...  Consult an doctor if in case of a lot....    when seating wash it/wipe it.. just under ur arms...keeps u refreshed too..    good luck|`|wP9MfpDgaa	i have the same problem. i have used over the counter prescription like strength deodorants like certain dri which worked well. its very strong to be bought in the store and can be applied every 1-3 days.  the only thing i didnt like was that if i didnt use it it seemed like sweat came pouring out.  now i am using dry idea, found in shoppers, and i like it.  if your sweating is VERY severe you can get botox injections in  your pits to ease the sweating.|`|9Rmd1IVVaa	I'm pretty sure you can't do that,  unless you can somehow find a way of preventing yourself from getting hot...  But it's not that hard to control,  the first most important thing is to wear deoderant (hehe my favorite deoderant is Secret Platnium Vanilla Try) It won't really stop you from sweating,  but it will disguise the scent.  You can find sports bras that have special absorbant facbric around the underarms, and i think that would help.|`|j2yLjm6Naa	You really can't stop or prevent sweat you can prevent the stench by using deoderant. Also sweating is good for your body it releases all the toxins from your body.
9bcCsZbPaa	you would have to open the pictures in adobe photoshop or some programe like that and chnage the transparency of the pictures so they can be visable behind each other.

HY5K4Yrraa	I think that's absolutely crazy! Her hair is pink...so what? She's expressing herself by dying her hair, lots of people do it and why on earth should the school system be allowed to dictate what colour a persons hair should be! i'm aware my view may not be shared with everyone but i just think their reaction was extreme and unwarranted!|`|FIALhwlKaa	Does the director have a problem? Boy, in my daughters class its in now to have pink hair... the must send half the class home.   IT`S RIDICULOUS!!!|`|5c48a3d3646aac3d075adfdfcbebb73daa	No she should not have been kicked out. People should be allowed to have any hair color they want. Schools and even business's should not be allowed to dictate to you how you wear your hair. People should be allowed to express themselves and embrace their individuality. ;)|`|yo0qnedIaa	Thats really gay.

SPjrPGzZaa	It Depends. Is your hair hair lots of split ends? Dry? Unmanageable? You should ask yourself these questions. My hair was very long, like down past my waist. But my hair was so thick and unmanageable, I decided to cut it. I am think of regrowing my hair but from here til it is long again, I have to be 10times more care full and letting my hair growing while still keeping it healthy. So I would for now say no, but if you are having trouble with it yes:)    Hope this helps|`|WuK9QiDMaa	I think that the shorter styles are more classy....But this is your hair...not ours.....Are you willing to take years to grow it back?

xnPjfYrvaa	One thing that helps me a lot with pimples, and the dark spots after you pop them, is Toner.  I don't even use soap anymore.  My skin is smooth and brighter.  It also isn't as dry.      I just apply the Toner until I see no more traces of anything on the cottonball.  Then (depending on your skin type) apply moisturizer.  I have had 3 pimples in the last two weeks that only lasted like a day or two.  It has helped fade the dark spots too.    Its Neutrogena Alcohol Free Toner.  It comes in a blue bottle.|`|Ljues4IHaa	Use Proactiv!!:O I didn't have a single pimple since i've started using it! It's amazingg :)!|`|mYeq5AvFaa	do nothing they go away
pA4GHLXcaa	You wont stay like that forever!!!  14 is not a common age to get married.  You do not stop growing until 18.  14 thats very odd..|`|Kn1PSmN1aa	no.|`|ZmU6ZNhBaa	I dont think 14 is the age to get married i mean like your not mature enough yet when your 14 you started high school and even though your all grown up and stuff but inside your still a child and still should be given the choice to be free and not get chained into a marriage!|`|yTGhMW4Uaa	yeh I was engaged to my girlfriend when I was 14 but we broke up.|`|tU5NJVL3aa	I also agree it's too young, but you said ENGAGED -- that doesn't mean married... could be years before they actually do the ceremony.  In this country in most states the earliest that can happen is when she's 16 (with parents permission), but hopefully they'll wait even longer.  Personally I think most aren't truly ready until after 24, 25 or so.|`|z3QsWmzpaa	you wont look like your 12 forever   and your mate shouldnt be engaged at this age shes got her whole life a head of her dont you have to be 18 to get married anyways   at 14 your not all grown up your still just a child (well a young teenager)|`|woF0nJg9aa	Yes, I think here in the United States 14 year olds should not even be thinking about marriage. I'm sure there are other cultures out there who think 14 is an ok "mature" age to get hitched, but my opinion is....baaaaadddd idea. It's almost gross to think about 14 year olds being married. It definitely depends on where you live and what your culture has taught and allowed. I know where I live, you are considered a legal adult at the age of 18 and if you chose to be married you could do so at that age.     Don't be too worried about how young you look and feel, darlin, you are young. Don't try and grow up too fast, trust me, it comes sooner than later, and pretty soon your wishing you were young again. Think of it as a blessing, because when your in your 40's you'll look like your in your 30's and feel young, and you will be sooooo freaking happy your skin is fresh. I hear it all the time from the gals I work with...they get botox so that they look young. Hahaha, we want it all, don't we. We want to be and treated older when we're young, and we want to look younger when we're old. We want straight hair if curly, and the other way around.|`|5AkHM1mwaa	14 is not a good age to get maried. Maybe 200 years ago in Romeo and Juliet time that was a good age. Nowadays most people think 25 even to be to young to get married. At 14 we're still immature and haven't really developped fully. You're friend should ask herself if she is willing to stay with her fiance for the rest of her life. After all that's what marriage is. And you shouldn't even be thinking of mariage now.|`|JkhB79V2aa	hey,  yeah I totally think 14 is 2 young. B/c honestly it takes some ppl longer to mature. Also when your 14 you practically still a child. It's a lot of responsibility and it's a serious thing that shouldn't be taken lightly.  And I m sure you won't b the same forever. YOu will get more mature looking. Don't worry  Hope I helped  Jesus loves ya,  :)|`|b3453bfc6bcd9a621fa739d9ba1f4bb0aa	well in some cultures it's considered mature to get married at 14 even 12 ( that the youngest age i have heard) but it's just her culture.    now as for you don't worry about maturing to quickly. i didn't mature out of my young always joking around and being silliness until the 10th grade. and i'm in the 11th. it's just apart of being yong. enjoy it because before you know time will fly past and you'll find yourself applying for college and then, your really feel mature.|`|mYeq5AvFaa	14 is fu(king young....|`|NbAGauDmaa	It is okay if the couple are in love and the guy is financially stable. But i don't support forced marriages as some cultures have.|`|shAfupiEaa	hell to the no. tell her to stop. before she ruins her life.|`|Bz77lASCaa	14 IS WAY TO YOUNG TO GET MARRIED. Some people in other countries get married at the age of 12, but thats tradition.. not really out of love. If your 14, you should really barely be kissing, unless you've had a boyfriend for a while. Is she really ready to take on the challenge of having a husband and being married?    Boyfriend- Yes  Husband- No|`|QB6cCK1caa	WHAT?! 14 is not an adult age, you wont be adult until your 17,18, 19. Those girls saying that 14 is old enough are just trying to GROW UP! 14 is one the first years that you just become a teenager, 14 is your first year of HIGH SCHOOL! your friends/ those girls dont know what theyre talking about! I dont plan on getting married until around 27!|`|ROYjj99oaa	I'm some religions or traditions its ok to be married at the age of 14, like the mormons, a male can marry as many girls as he wants as old as he wants them to be, as long as he can provide to support them. don't you worry about growing up, your not  ready for the responsibilities of marriage yet, just enjoy life while you still can, I'm a junior in high school, and I already know I miss being a kid.|`|FHi0v36eaa	I think 14 is way too young to even consider getting married. Wait til you are about 18 when the law says you are old enough. By that time she will be mature enough. I had a friend when we were 14 that said she was engaged to her bf. We all tried to talk her out of it, but of course she didn't see what was wrong with the situation. He did drugs and wasn't really the greatest bf to her, but she insisted they were meant to be together. Well it didn't last long and they never got married.     I wouldn't worry about thinking you are immature, you are still growing. Trust me, you sound like you are on the right track. 14 isn't all grown up, you still have lots to learn. Just be yourself and have fun with being young. You won't be young forever.|`|pwlgAnb3aa	no, absolutely not.  when i was 16 i was in a relationship with a guy adn i swore up adn down we were going to get married, however things change way too quickly when you are yuong and needlss to sya, we aren't together anymore.  you may have stopped growing physically, however, mentally and emotionally you have not. it is definitely too young to be marrying at 14.|`|DkwgogXZaa	no its not|`|igrdohopaa	Hell no!|`|db545bc62ac973f7f9d4710ea59879d7aa	14 i s NOT  an age toi be married hello YOU CANT EVEN DRIVE      and being little and looking younger is not a problem|`|oYSsVM0Aaa	In some cultures but not normally in north american culture.

(:|`|XpKY04Tnaa	Girls marrying at the age of 14 was common in the before the birth control era started in the 1960's. See the 1950's and earlier. It was normal for girls from conservative and rural areas of country to marry at 13. This tended to change in the 1960's with the availability of birth control. Today it's almost unheard of except for a few ultra right-wing religious sects.
FklngtvCaa	Depends on wether or not I actually like it.  I've had a Cover Girl one since October when it  went on sale and it's about 3/4 of the way full. I'm  gonna have to throw it out since it's probably expired  but if it's a good foundation, it'll take much longer than  that.|`|AA11945637	no joke- for years as it is the rare occasion that I use any|`|KH9HROrSaa	3 months.  from a 1 oz bottle|`|LRTZO7dDaa	3 months|`|4ebfc96012aef4fc15dc59c42ecac5a7aa	It really depends on how often I go out.  Between 4 and 6 months on average.    :)|`|r4i7xPnMaa	Three months seems about right. It may last longer if you use less, obviously. I go back and forth from powder to liquid foundation, so mine usually lasts closer to 4 and a half months.    Regardless, it isn't a wise idea to use the same bottle of liquid foundation for more than about six months, as it does expire. Foundation in a pump dispenser will last a little longer, because it is less exposed to air than bottle foundation. I usually write the month that I bought the foundation on the bottom of the bottle with a permanent marker (example, a bottle of foundation I bought yesterday would have '01/09' on the bottom). I find it's a bit easier to keep track of it that way.|`|OrGQ4iBVaa	if you put on just the right amount, for a while.|`|XGlyB56Faa	3 months if i use it 5 days a week it depends i guess,|`|Ig35GCyMaa	Like year haha because i never use it, and thats about the time i need to get a new one cause its sooo old|`|4f9cddee7672c7afa29d97cbadae8f22aa	Christian Dior Forever Extreme Wear 1oz bottle - 3 to 4 months (probably more like 3 months if I used it every single day).|`|DiQ0fIdlaa	for me it last about a month because i use it a lot. it could last 3 months but it starts getting really cakie and it starts making my skin oily ad stuff because it gets old.|`|SOyU4rp0aa	Depending on how much full coverage make-up you use, you may go through make-up quicker than someone else. Generally, foundation will usually last between a month and a half and three months. Foundation can be kept for up to a year though before it is technically 'bad' and you should go buy a new one.    Hope that helped! :)|`|V4yxJ67saa	For me, usually about 3 months....but rarely longer than that.  I work long days, with meetings/dinner/drinks with clients afterwards in the evenings & i normally reapply my makeup before i go to these :)    The contents of my cosmetics bag are never more than 6 months old    x

Anyone who is 18 and below will tell you the boyish looks, and those older will tell you that they prefer rugged hard features. During my teens I found boyish looks to be adorable and much better, such as Taylor Hanson, and Nick from Back Street Boys etc. But now that I am in my mid 20s I like muscular men like Daniel Craig, Vin Diesel etc.|`|kNzKFVWpaa	rugged, manly all the way|`|NbAGauDmaa	Rugged|`|vJRMmgd6aa	definitly rugged!  i dont want to date someone that looks like a little boy! i want someone that looks like a man!

SOyU4rp0aa	Basically, after creating an account, you click on the checkout link and just follow it through with what it says. Normally, it will make you put in a card number as a form of payment or it will bill you. When using a card to pay on most websites it will either not save the information to your computer at all, or it will ask if you would like to. That way your cc  isn't just sitting around online for whoever else uses your computer.     Also, the address will be where you want the items sent and the billing address is where you would like the bill sent. In most cases, that is the same address. If you're already paying for it online, they would use the billing address to send the invoice.    So basically, unless someone outside of your home is paying for the items you are purchasing and would like the invoice/bill sent to their home, you will put your own address on there and the package and the invoice will be sent to the same address. :)|`|6XIXmnIWaa	well  u have to have some sort of credit card or bank card first just sign up u have to give ur details card number and everything  adress is your home adress where u live and then billing adress is if you want the parcel to come to the same place or something like that|`|o1QViLtBaa	If you're buying online you have to have a credit card/debit card or a paypal account (I think they take that).  If you registered with them I think they have your information and they need an address and billing address to get your products to you.    If you're buying it online and don't give them an address how do you think you'll eventually get the product?  They don't store your credit card information but they DO store your address and things of that matter.
n1SVl991aa	Since you bleach your hair, I'm sure you are already aware it's bad for your hair.. But it does NOT make your hair grow slower.  It's kinda the same as when people say trimming your hair makes it grow faster.. that is not true. Your hair grows from root to end, so the ends of your hair have nothing to do with growth. What it does is cuts all of the split ends so it looks healthier, that's it.  Same thing with bleaching your roots.. The new hair that will be growing under it has been untouched by the bleach and doesn't affect the speed at which your hair will grow.    Since you are wanting to grow your hair longer, I suggest taking Prenatal vitamins. They are perfectly safe for people who aren't pregnant, they are just packed with lots of vitamins that can help speed up your hair growth (not by a dramatic amount though, it will still take a long time) But it also makes your hair grow stronger and healthier, which is really good, obviously. I take one a day.    Also, do not wash your hair everyday. It really isn't good for it, the MOST you should wash your hair is every other day. I only wash mine every 3-4 days (twice a week) and that's all it needs.. It keeps it clean without "over cleaning" it.    Another thing, try to avoid using things that can stress out your hair as much as possible. Instead of blowdrying it, just let it air dry. But if you absolutely have to blowdry it, don't use heat, or use a low heat, because that stresses out your hair. It will take longer, but it's worth having healthier hair!    Curling irons and flat irons are horrible for hair, but I do use my flat iron everyday. I use a low heat setting, and when I use it, I don't let it touch the ends of my hair; I take it off before it touches the ends because it can split them.    Tip: I also bleach my hair, and I deep condition it once a week and it's in very good condition. Just throwing that out there..EVERYONE that bleaches their hair, or just dyes it reguraly should deep condition at home at least once a week.|`|hiH6j2lZaa	I am a licensed cosmetologist and bleaching does not make your hair grow slower. Your "roots" that your hair grow from are under your scalp and they are healthy, they have not been touched by the bleach at all. Your hair will be damaged by bleach, but will not grow any slower. best of luck!|`|WuK9QiDMaa	Bleaching Kills your hair  PERIOD!! Cut out all the bleach and go natural!
hiH6j2lZaa	I am a licensed cosmeteologist and when a client wants bright red hair, here is what I do. Go to Sallys, they offer a line of bright red color for dark hair only. It is by Loreal. I use it personally. Follow the instructions and then wash your hair with a red shampoo and conditioner that can also be found at Sallys, best of luck!|`|0parZMOGaa	i used to use loral castings in mahogany when my hair was lightish brown, and my hair went that colour. depending on how light your hair is it will most likely go that colour, and i think it wont be streaky it will just have different tones where it is darker but it should blend in. good luck x
NbAGauDmaa	No way. I pay tons of money to get a weave that long|`|ZmU6ZNhBaa	NO WAY your hair must be gorgeous! Its a girls beauty and you should keep it.

ba3adde12f054008eb9115531e07a39eaa	nope u dont, just wait till your face feels normal...like dry not oily from the lotion    the lotion actually is what is mainly helping i think, because it does something to the pores to make it so you won't break out more|`|4Dc44BC5aa	No, the lotion is the last step and you keep it on so your face doesn't get dried out.
r4i7xPnMaa	Your best bet would be to head to a MAC counter (not a freestanding store) on a weekend and try to get a makeover. It's best if you call in advance and ask for an appointment, because that way you'll have a guaranteed spot. There is a $50 fee for makeovers, but it is redeemable in products. So basically, you have to buy at least fifty dollars worth of stuff. It sounds like a lot, but some MAC products are pretty expensive, so fifty bucks is about enough for a foundation, a bottle of fix+ spray and an eyeshadow. Or if you totally hate the makeup, invest in the brushes. Totally worth it.    If you tell your MAC artist that you're looking for some of the basics, she (or he) will help you pick out a great foundation, along with some nice eyeshadows, blushes, and lippies, that will compliment your features. Just make sure they know you're looking for basic components, stuff that you can use for an everyday look.    That said, here are some of my favorite MAC products:    Studio fix powder plus foundation. I have terribly oily combination skin, and I was always afraid to wear powder foundation, because it made me look chalky. This stuff is fantastic, and does a great job of controlling the oil on my face. After I've applied it, I set it with  Fix + spray. This is hands down my favorite MAC product. It sets my makeup beautifully, and completely takes away the chalky look. There are seriously about 20 different uses for this stuff. Ask your MAC artist about it. You'll be really glad you did.  MAC brushes are definitely a worthwhile investment. They're pretty expensive (it's a good idea to check prices of the things you might be interested in at maccosmetics.com before heading to the MAC counter, because they don't put price tags on anything.) but they're worth it. They are super high quality, and if you take care of them properly, they'll last you for a very very long time, and even if you decide to branch out to other brands of makeup, the brushes are still useful. Common brushes include the 217, 224, 239, 150, 190, and 187.    The eyeshadows are nice, fantastic pigmentation and GREAT color payoff, but there are tons and tons of MAC drugstore dupes available for half the price (google "mac dupes" and you'll find loads of them), so unless it's a color that you absolutely cannot find anywhere else, I think it would be a better idea to spend your money on other things. Same goes for lipglosses and blushes.    Oh, and if you do decide to go for a makeover, ASK YOUR ARTIST FOR A FACE CHART. This is the most important thing you can do. They'll show you how they did your makeup step by step and make a list of all the products that they used, so even if you can't buy everything that day, you'll still have it listed in case you want to go back and pick it up at a later date.    Hope this helps! Good luck!|`|dVnr5EtBaa	i rreeallllyy love the lipglass. its amazing.|`|CSlhFaejaa	My fav stuffs from them are their brushes, pigments and lipglosses.. They are amazing .. If this is the first time you using or buying MAC .. Its good if you go for their collections first. Where they will have their popular colors for certain looks and palletized it.

They're my favorites when starting out!  Also, get a paintpot for a base or a really quick brightener for the eyes..either soft ochre, rubenesque, or bare study!  Their lipgloss in Love Nectar is everyone's favorite.   Bare slimshine is the best too! it's half lipstick/lipgloss in one!  For lipstick, I love Viva Glam V...it suits everyone!    Also, get Vanilla pigment! I got a sample size of it, and fell in love! After I finish my sample, I'm definetely buy a full size jar.

I  would leave the links to some super cute clothes, but the copy and paste feature isn't working on this latop. hope i helped!|`|r1SG2ebIaa	shirts or tank tops are good casual alternitives to just t-shirts, or you could try skirts and leggings with dolly shoes or boots. you need to find what your comfortable wearing and go with that, pick a few basic items that you just have to have, and then match things to it.|`|0mBJWiydaa	Actually a lot of v-neck semi-loose fitting tees are in!    If you want you could add a vest to add some definition to your waist. You always want to give your self a shape so that the tunic loose fitting style doesn't look frumpy.    Definitely add some cool flats or a chic pair of converse. If your really ambitious you could try some gladiator sandals for the spring.

r4i7xPnMaa	To figure out which colors you should get, it's a good idea to determine if your skin has warm, neutral, or cool undertones. You can figure this out by either asking someone at a makeup counter (They don't charge for this, and it's the most accurate way to go) or by checking out a page like this:  http://www.beautysecrets101.com/warm-or-...    Once you've figured that out, the easiest way to figure out coloring is to google "makeup for warm undertones" (or cool or neutral undertones... depending on whichever you have.) You'll find a bunch of sites like this one:   http://makeup.lovetoknow.com/Undertones  That will give you color suggestions.    Just don't fall into the trap of thinking that you have to have high end makeup in order for it to be any good. Just because websites may suggest a blush like NARS Orgasm, which retails for about $35, doesn't mean you must have that exact one. There are tons of drugstore duplicates available out there, just don't be afraid to look. Google is a great tool for finding makeup bargains. Besides, if you're just starting out with makeup, you probably don't want to jump straight into the higher end stuff.    As far as eyeshadows and stuff go, I totally recommend Coastal Scents 88 color palette, which retails at their website (www.coastalscents.com) for $22. It's got TONS and tons of really amazing vibrant colors with excellent pigmentation, so you can get a little experience with the colors that do work for you, as well as having new colors to try out whenever you feel like you're ready. Along with that, I recommend an eyeshadow primer like L'Oreal De-Crease ($7 at any drugstore) that will help your eyeshadows stay vibrant without creasing all day.    Hope this helps! Good luck!|`|FklngtvCaa	You can ask us on Yahoo! Answers ;)  Or try:  - Go to a makeup counter and ask  - Use Almay Intense i-Color for your eyes  - Find out if you have warm or cool undertones  - Wear lip and blush colors that are similar to the  shade you naturally blush (peach, pink, or even just  bronzer)|`|QvhPJAKyaa	try out the testers in superdrug or boots or somewhere.  or in some bigger places like debenhams, they have people that do your makeup for you and test it out and they can help you see what suits you and what doesnt :) x|`|9Ycuoysjaa	Go to a big boots store or somewhere like selfridges where they have make-up counters, the advisers there will help you choose which colours and which ones are best for your skin type.|`|IhhvG1Cnaa	Brunettes - Brown, gold, cream, dark grey (smokey colors). Also green, green suits everyone :)    Blonde - Gold, blue, pink, lilac and again green. For blondes really one word... Pastel!    Redheads - Gold, light browns, creams and again green :) xxxx|`|o0Luxonpaa	Go to Boots and they will give you a make over with some cosmetics you like to see how they look on you.|`|CSlhFaejaa	Go for all ! Try everything ! You will never know until you try ... After trying different looks and colors, ask peeps for their comment or what do they think ?

yKcLkGa9aa	With your skin tone - I suggest hazel (FreshLooks).  Think Nicole Ritchie.  Although you describe your skin tone as darker than hers I think they would look amazing on you.  And, that color would look natural against your darker skin tone unlike blue, grey or violet.    Ask your eye doctor to give you samples of the different colors you are considering.  You want to be sure the color(s) you chose will even be noticible before spending the money on them.|`|AA10314304	violet looks too fakey.

UByvC54Xaa	I used the backcombing method with a little help fro a metal lice comb. I did it myself. It was going to cost me $360 australian money to go to a salon.     The process is easy. hold the end of one of the sections firmly. using your lice comb, comb back towards the scalp. Whilst doing this let a few hairs get pushed all the way back to the scalp (not too many at once or you will get gaps). eventually, the hair will matt up. Works best on clean, washed hair.      If you want neat, prefessional looking dreads, you section the hair with bands to begin with. start at the base of your neck and create a brickwork pattern. thin dreads? sections should be between 1/2 to 3/4 of an inch squares. Fatter dreads? go up to 1 & 1/2 inch squares. Want a natural look, forget sectioning and just grab and comb. They look normal early on in this method, but dreads are not instant. they have 3 phases and require a fair bit of maintenance over the first few months.    I have a 6 page word doc that I typed up with info to help people wanting dreads using the backcombing method. Should you like a copy, email me holeandcorgan@hotmail.com There is too much info to list on here!|`|WuK9QiDMaa	Please don't get dreads..you cannot wash them properly and they make people look like they're homeless.They start to stink after awhile and the ONLY way to get them out is to cut the hair off.Needless to sya you better like extremely short uneven hair after the dreads come out!|`|7xkwE3X9aa	I want to get dreads when I'm older.. the only thing is I relate them to pot-smoking people and I don't smoke,ha.

5NShLkTkaa	Birthmarks should be covered in the sun or in tanning beds.They should not be exposed to too much ultra violet light.  Perhaps if you tan everything else it will make your birthmark not stand out quite so much. Be careful, though, OK?|`|FplTPoAyaa	No. It usually darkens the birthmark as well, therefore making it just as noticeable as without a tan.|`|xqfbtYkHaa	It depends on where the birthmark is, and how dark it is, what type of skin you have, etc. For example, My friend who is hispanic has a birthmark on her leg. By the middle of summer, u couldnt see it anymore. I have a birthmark on my leg, it got darker

L6w8YmoOaa	i'd give up at that point.|`|gqopFVeyaa	Tongue rings are relatively easy piercings, but here is what they need, anatomically:    1. the jewelry needs to sit far enough back that when resting, it does not rub the backs of your teeth (gums or enamel) as that would cause wear. [this is the mouth damage you can avoid- any cracks or anything is because you play with it, not because of the placement]  2. the bar should not intersect the big vein in your tongue. to avoid, it is possibly to pierce a bit off center  3. the frenulum must not be too far forwards, or the center piercing is not possible. [this can be treated with a small, voluntary 'surgery' in which the web is cut down a bit]    If your mouth does not suit this, then there is really nothing you can do. However, since the tongue web is your problem, you should know that you can get a less common different tongue piercing style called "venoms". These are two side-by-side tongue piercings, which therefore avoid the tongue web. They can be the same depth back as the regular, so that the tooth or gum problems are not common. However, this does mean a longer swelling period, and if you are not careful you can bite it more easily as they are closer to your teeth.     Overall, you are limited to a. try again as it was pierced originally. Sideways won't hurt anything. b. Get your tongue web trimmed. c. Get venoms. d. Live without it.|`|de51b5e493e082150f1a18485eb83857aa	do it againnn|`|ZaVPaDGhaa	My advice it to not bother doing it again. I have a few reasons:  I had my tounge pierced for 8 years, and in that time i chipped about 4 of my teeth. As much as i tried not to bite down on the ball, it would happen by accident when i was eating, or chewing gum. I broke one of my teeth very badly and suffer for it now.  2nd reason - not all people have the proper kind of mouth for it. You are probably one of those people. Its just the way it is and unless you want to have a speech impediment, then dont do it.  I know its cool and sexy, but you can do other things, like an eyebrow (love that!), or nipple ring.  If you dont take this advice, the only other i can give you is to get the type of jewlery that is softer and bends (I forget what its called, but the piercer will be able to tell you) and also get a smaller barbell, so it sits tight on your tounge.  by the way, my hole is still open and i havent put anything in it for about 5 years now.|`|AA11693215	Fist i off why would you pierce your tongue??? oh well to each their own.

BGNdKvXzaa	Men all over the world do no instantly nor in time fall in love with these "playmate-type-of-women". Their power of attraction may be extremely strong and addictive, but men do not fall in love with THAT.      What you are talking about is lust.  Many men, particularly young men who do not know any better, are more swayed by these women, but older, more knowledgeable men take them for what they are.  We know that many women like they are expect men to pay for their company.  And for that reason alone, most mature men would no longer be stupid enough to take them seriously. Besides, just because a woman looks good does not mean she will treat you good. Looks says nothing about character.    Is it safe to say that they are very pretty.  But if you had oodles and oodles of plastic surgery, and a makeup assistant constantly hovering over you, you'd look just as they look.    Now I have no qualms with physical beauty, and in my younger years could be manipulated by it as well.  But ladies should not compare themselves with models, porno stars, or Playboy Playmates. Scrape off the tons of makeup, eliminate the silicone or saline, and then tell me what you have.  Just take a look at those before and after photos.  You'll be in for a surprise.|`|JaDnYs54aa	oh goodness no  beauty is skin deep. more men are attracted to personality more than ****. most guys thinks its a joke now, and not to mention with technology most of those playmates really dont even look like that.    guys who are soooo in love with those girls are in love with a computer generated girl, not a real girl.|`|rYWeCH0saa	EWWWWy.  of course not.  They're nasty.|`|kwkOaDDlaa	Are you kidding??? I think they look like men dressed as women. Its not coz their pretty men gorpe at them....work it out!!!

I always thought Anna Nicole Smith was gorgeous|`|SD0dIDCKaa	Ew, no.  They are basically the same person.|`|yKcLkGa9aa	I believe that beauty comes in as many forms as there are people.  What one finds breath-takingly beautiful some may find very unattractive.  Everyone knows the women in those mags are airbrushed to perfection, however, they do represent the majority's definition of beautiful.  That's why you don't see plain, plump, old, thinning haired, flat chested women gracing these mags.|`|8cf66894663c74e69b5ed17db7228d97aa	Things get banned because the women are naked-they could be ugly and there would be men who would still look. No, some are pretty but there are so many lovely women out there that aren't in crude nudity photos|`|KH9HROrSaa	HELL no.    bleach blonde hair? orange skin? multiple plastic surgeries? nope..|`|ALidyPnXaa	Men aren't attracted to them because of their beauty.

0KYv2LRkaa	well keep one style but add different clothes when you feel like its time for a change    like one day you might look boho with a flowy top & nice sandals but then wear pants/skirt/shorts thats not that style so its still you & you have a style not just trying to find your real self in clothes    but if you still want change your style a lot change it ever couple of seasons like spring/summer  winter/fall  because that doesnt seem like changing alot but it is!|`|x8QlEZhAaa	Maybe stick to a certain style like wild, preppy, sporty, girly.

The vitamin D will prevent internal cancer and prevent melanoma.  Yes, prevent!  Moderate UV will save your life.    Outdoor tanning, wear a bathing suit, unless nude beach.    Indoor tanning, I go nude (no tan lines).  I wear something called "The Manly" because I don't want my thing to get too dark.  There are all kinds of things you can wear while tanning, including The Tannie for your hair, Nail Savers so your acrylic nails don't yellow, nipple pedals if your nipples get too dark.    And of course, always wear your eye protection!
pwlgAnb3aa	I like to dress up, and be fun. However, because people at my school constantly ask me "wow, why are you so dressed up?" I've learned to dress it down.  I like to wear straight leg jeans and a plain solid color t-shirt. Add a sweater, scarf, of some cute necklaces and bangles so you can still add a little "umph." Also, I LOVE heels. This plain, yet cute look can handle heels without being too dressy.   If you're going for a more classic look, go with jeans, a nice top, and some flats (or boots).  Layering is also a fun dress-down look. Vests are in, so work it. Plus, it is winter, so you can add many layers and not have to worry about getting too hot.  You could also try dressing it down a little by putting your hair half or all the way back. Make it cute and add a bow!     Hope this helped!

PBuYKm8Aaa	Tattoos are tricky, because every place is different....and some tattoo artist give you a discount for have boobs. lol. [i've gotten that all 6 times]    Piercings are also tricky, but A tid bit easier to price. When i had my lip pierced it was $50. It doesn't hurt, but you need to take good care of it for the first 3 weeks with a product called h2ocean or noncented soaps. The swelling and redness go away within the 1st 3 days to a week. Do not change the jewelry until your piercing is entirely healed. You're piercer is going to pierce it with a hoop because it allows the lip to swell without irritating you. Make sure you do not get a stud until you're healed because it can cut through your lip and scaring it. [been there it sucks]. The best place that I have found is to get it on either side...not the center cuz it looks tacky. Also, avoid getting them directly on your lip. It looks bad, it can rip out easier, and its unhealthy. The piercer will show you a good location for the piercing.|`|AA12032352	This is gonna vary soooo much....you need to go to the shop that would do the work....they are the only ones who know what it will cost!|`|jpVxAKbRaa	u look pretty, its enough|`|vhirRGEAaa	u look fine|`|Hze3daQXaa	u should know that
hiH6j2lZaa	I am a licensed cosmetologist. It is a wise tale. It will smell like beer and feel the same. I would get a good conditioning treatment, like at Sallys and use that instead. Save the beer for drinking.|`|HhmhSBpgaa	No it does not make it softer or smell like alcohol.

i1JVe24Oaa	Don't use lotions, they are full of stuff that might not exactly help.     Get some vaseline - from the pharmacy, for example. Cover your hands with vaseline and leave it on for night (you have to wear gloves). Trust me, it helps.|`|GiHOnv54aa	elizabeth arden 8 hour cream hand cream  i heard it's good but i've never tried it  i use vaseline hand lotion and i think it's good  keeps your hands really soft  X|`|Gew6pZhbaa	Vaseline Healthy Hand and Nail, or Olay Quench. You have to be consistant though, put it on ALL the time. That's the only way I've been able to keep my hands soft is putting lotion on them all day.|`|wqsuO0lsaa	I worked at Macy's, I've tried them all.  THE BEST HAND CREAM IN THE WORLD IS "MAKE A DIFFERENCE" BY ORIGINS.    It smells like heaven (kind of vanilla & fresh apricot) but the fact is... it makes a difference!  It's like a silky protective glove and it's JUST FOR HANDS.  Will cost ya a little under $20 and it's worth every penny.  Plus, they will do your makeup/facial give you a hand massage with the cream and even free samples!  I would know!  ;)|`|VtZN0ov0aa	Norweigan formula hand cream. (:|`|HeRIwZRLaa	E45. i swear by it, its for hands and body and it works really well, try it.|`|9Rmd1IVVaa	Mary Kay Satin hands stuff is really good,  I love it.  You want to get the Extra emollient night cream, The buffer cream stuff (I forgot what it's called sorry...),  the cleansing gel, and the hand cream.   It works FANTASTIC,  I used to have the same problem as you, and I was really self-concious about it,  but I got that stuff,  and it makes your hands really soft and moisterized,  and it protects your hands from becoming future dryness, and damage from the sun and etc.     Also,  you should have a nice mini bottle of lotion (something that smells niice) to keep with you in your purse or something,  just in case. I like those nice little things from bath & body works    Put on moisterizer right after the shower,  because that's when the dryness starts.  For this I like using Vaseline Deep conditoning moisterizer,  it evens your skin  tone,  and has vitamin e,  and really moisterizes well.     Also, wear gloves when it's cold,  skin always drys out in the cold.    Hope this helps =DD|`|DJqDAKmDaa	try CAUDALIE's hand cream from Sephora!!! it smells great and your hand will be super smooth!|`|ab2f66e8a13e1ac5cc285faefb061f12aa	At night coat your hands in Vaseline then wrap them in clean cotton socks after 3 nights you will have super soft and smooth hands.

c98c60d71dbb85f0335e5c7fc391ddd3aa	trust your friend.Cooking oil is one of the best split end remedies.My sister did this about a month ago and it did wonders for her hair.|`|Kf1G4urwaa	noooooo dont do ittt|`|oOqSpBmbaa	I do it sometimes, it washes out grand (for me, my hair tends to be exceptionally dry though). It doesn't make a huge difference to be honest, so I just tend to stick to good old Herbal Essences :D|`|I6zQeNGzaa	Trust me , I have long hair (almost tailbone legnth) and I have to especially careful about split ends.  If you want to use an oil my recommendation is pure Camellia Oil.  It's the BEST.  If you have dry damaged hair with split ends,you can use the Camellia Oil as a deep conditioner by applying to your hair at night (concetrating on the ends of your hair especially) and then shampooing out the next day.   You can also use it as a hot oil treatment if you dont prefer to sleep in it. You put a few drops of the oil into 1/2 cup of hot water and massage into hair. Towel wrap your hair and leave the oil in for 30 minutes and then you wash out.   I use it regularly. After every shower, I just apply a few drops to my damp hair and comb it through then dry as usual. About once a month, I'll do the deep conditioning treatment.   I dont know where you can find the oil outside of the internet because it's imported from Japan. I get mine off of Amazon.com and the brand I buy is Oshima Tsubaki. GREAT STUFF!|`|mVNMgaQBaa	all you need to do is get a really good conditioner and it will make your hair easier, but make sure you dont wash it too often thats just as bad|`|hiH6j2lZaa	I am a licensed That's an old wise tale.

ohsxAbeuaa	mac has THE best lashes. depends what look your going for, if you just want your lashes to look like you have alot (look full) get individuals and only apply from the middle all the way to the end, every other gap. hope that makes sense. but if you want big long eyelashes go with the ones sold in pairs. ask a person at mac what your looking for there great for help :)      ps: NEVER throw them away you can use them over and over till there abused.|`|Kt84kDvEaa	Individual lashes give the most natural look. They thicken and lengthen without that thin black strip that lash sets give. They are also easier to apply, however, they take longer to apply.

wqsuO0lsaa	awe you are so cute!  The truth is you are getting breakouts once a month because of hormones.  It still happens to me and I'm 27 (also blesseds with clear skin!)    I would recommend a free radical busting syrum to protect those heathty skin cells.  Free radicals are found in smoke/pollution and just general muck that we soak up like a sponge.    The best one by far is A PERFECT WORLD by Origins.  They have a whole skin care line made with Silver White Tea tips.  It smells like heaven (fresh apricot and vanilla) and it makes my skin glow.  If I can't have my origins my skin punishes me and says "give me my perfect world" or else! hehehe.  It's expensive but not as expensive as the other crap at Macys like Este Lauder or Clinique.  Sure those lines are 1000 times better than drug store products.  But ORIGINS is all about natural products and the general ZEN experience of putting the finest ingredients on your face.     No I don't work for them.. anymore!  hehe, just love love love em!  Good Luck!|`|UJi083kZaa	Make sure you use lotion at least once a day.  I use cetaphil face lotion.  My derm recommended it.  No need to spend lots on lotion.  Many have just added perfumes, etc. which won't help.      I personally use duac gel for large breakouts and differin gel every day.  You can put lotion over the top of both of them.  Differin keeps your pores from getting clogged.  Duac gel kills bacteria on breakouts.  Both are prescription so you will need to see your family doc to get them.   Otherwise use over the counter meds that contain benzol peroxide for breakouts .  Maybe even using Neutrogena facewash with salic acid would help as well.       Skin can break out for several reasons: too dry skin, too oily skin, if you are touching your face alot (maybe from cell phone), irritants in your face products, or your pores may get clogged from the makeup you are using.    It's all trial and error.  and it may even be from your hormones (which it may be since it is once a month for you).  Some people swear by birth control. . .  The ones higher in estrogen, if you don't get headaches, are usually best for acne.

BGNdKvXzaa	You, like me and thousands of others, are attracted to the fetishness of nylons, high heels (black preferred), as well black stockings and garter belts if I may add a few. There is something visceral about them, because no one I know of was taught that these things were appealing.    You need not worry or be uncomfortable about your interests. it is normal, and perhaps healthy to admit such an attraction.  And to be polite, when in mixed company do not stare at women so outfitted, nor look at magazines promoting or showcasing such articles.    And for Pete's sake, do not start wearing them yourself.
rtx0YQDJaa	correction: tongue splitting is often NOT permanent seeing as the tongue is a muscle and it will try to fuse back together and most likely it will close up a little bit after some time. people avoid this by either cauterizing or suturing the split.|`|QnSKaBcjaa	yuck|`|P53btYb6aa	Remember that tongue splitting IS permanent.

lNucas6Daa	I've been on Weight Watchers since October 28, 2008, and I've lost 21 pounds so far.    At the start of my diet, and before, I never considered my face and cheeks to be fat.  But now that I look at pictures of me from then, and pictures of me from now, its really dramatic how the weight loss has altered the chubby appearance of my face.  My face still has fat in it, but not nearly as much as before.    If the rest of your body is also chubby, a diet will surely help to slim every part of your body, including your face.    Good luck!|`|5NShLkTkaa	Some of the sweetest faces I have ever seen are chubby.|`|9Rmd1IVVaa	Hmmm....   If used correctly,  bronzer can help make your face look thinner.    You could try putting on some foundation a just a bit darker then your natural skin tone,  and then try taking a peach of something, and sliding it down your nose... It might look pretty.    Like someone said before,  when you lose weight your face looks more thinner and your features all stand out more (cheekbones, chin, etc.) Just don't go starving yourself just so you can have a thinner cheeks....

Well aside from those sexy showers with my man |`|tFVyfvS3aa	with my third child i was in the hospital for 8 days before they took him emergency c-section i was laid up in bed all that time with only a small sponge bath ..would not even let me eat..i felt like **** in every way possible...i normally have to bath at least once and depending on the day sometimes twice. As my boys have gotten older so has their stench..lol altough they have always bathed everyday it is even more important now.|`|ojj5XKyBaa	almost 3 days. I had the flu too. I insisted on bathing even though i was sick so my condition got worse. I really had to take a few days not bathing. But on the third day I couldn't stand it anymore. Gross. Sticky feeling, icky hair -- I started getting dandruff! That was the last straw--I boiled myself two kettles of water, added it to the bath and just hoped that the flu wouldn't rage on.    Hooray for warm water. It didn't make my flu worse. I don't know why exactly, I just had the layman's understanding that cold water would have made things worse. Guess I was lucky.|`|URyN1emKaa	whats bathing???????|`|XXw7DUDRaa	i have gone 7 weeks without showering. i do not find it at all gross.    i find your last question to be false.|`|b3453bfc6bcd9a621fa739d9ba1f4bb0aa	the longest i've gone was a week. i was at this wildlife camp thing. lemmie tell you i was so happy when i got home. i didn't say hi to anyone i just went upstairs and took a shower. it was gross.|`|0t8Kzrvkaa	36 hours or so.  I am used to bathing twice daily, but I got into trouble and had to stay overnight in jail.  Then I hitched a ride home on the bus.  I was cold, yet sweaty and my hair felt like a mop-head.    My son does have to bathe more because he is 12 and stinks like onions.  His Dad isn't teaching him right at his house, but he's clean at mine.|`|yKcLkGa9aa	I've actually gone about 20+ days without a real shower a few times!  After the 3rd week I guess I lost count.  The reason ... I was in the Army, stationed in Germany - we were in the early stages of a conflict and were deployed to a border country.  We had to use either a big pot and some soap in our tent or the ice cold river to wash up but a shower just wasn't an option.|`|pwlgAnb3aa	two days, i was sick.  and i totally agree on everything you said.|`|iXz80uW9aa	HaHa yeah, i was also in the army and we had a month long field problem .... it sucks, baby wipes only go so far. you get sick, but you get used to it. That shower back is better then sex !|`|h9y9xN4Naa	i thnk 15 days... am vry lazyy in takn showers.|`|HeRIwZRLaa	2 days and i hated even that.  maybe more when i was younger but i dont really remember.
i4b0xzSWaa	u should try zyproex|`|LXxxAzIqaa	Get a dermatologists to prescribe something for you. They give the best treatment out there that is right for your skin.|`|HeRIwZRLaa	make sure you eat health, drink loads of water and wash your face everyday.   there are no good creams to stop this but you can get meds from your GP.
ONQpHeycaa	I know at Victoria's Secret, when I got fitted, it was free.  And no, they didn't expect me to buy a bra that same day...I didn't buy one lol.  And underwear shopping can be annoying...just try getting someone's help at an underwear store to ask what size panty you should be wearing, they're pretty good at helping with those things.  Good luck :)|`|NQRXKTgRaa	You can try them on in the stores. Just don't take your undies off when you try on panties. Wear a nude bikini undie when you want to go try on panties.  Go to victoria's secret for a bra fitting. It's free. If you don't want to buy it, just have some thick skin and say no thanks or I want to try some more before I decide. Buying underwear is easy.|`|NoZAofgOaa	http://www2.victoriassecret.com/collecti...        http://www2.victoriassecret.com/collecti...      http://www2.victoriassecret.com/collecti...      http://www.007b.com/bra-fitting.php|`|Qztghhpuaa	do it online|`|k5zdt7MMaa	I'm pretty sure that you are correct with the 14-16 size for underwear.  And yes, fittings are free and they won't make you buy a bra. They can't obligate you to buy something if you don't want to.|`|l07U1NiWaa	go shopping with friends, its always better when your with people than when your alone doing stuff like this.  itll be a lot less embarrassing when your around people that know you , trust me.|`|QnnmJEuraa	this is weird. just buy some freakin underwear|`|EjdOItfEaa	Why wear undie's?? Go free!! I do and I love it I hate undie's =0) and shopping for them..Just try it.|`|BTkUHEdzaa	try a thong again... those always work  boy cut are really comfortable too|`|5HTylrjGaa	I would try another store. Some stores have panty liners that you can put on underwear so that you can try them on. If nothing fits right chances are that you're just choosing a size too big or too small. Underwear sizes don't really go with actual dress sizes. I wear a size 2 but my underwear is a size 5.     As for bra fitting, try this http://www.007b.com/bra-fitting.php. There are also some other tips you can find online, such as if your bra strap is riding up, you need a smaller size (like 36 -> 34), but make sure you increase it by 1 cup size if you do that.|`|QAfhyMCVaa	Your 17 and never worn a bra? If you go into victorias secret i know they do free fittings. As for the underwear thing, just go and buy them its not that big of a deal everyone buys them lol|`|r1SG2ebIaa	Bra fitting is normally free - depending on the shop, and you dont have to buy the bra, as for the underwear, just find a cheap pack to take home and try on and if there fine then go back and buy some more, i like the girlboxer style, most underwear takes a while to get used to wearing, so go crazy buy abit of everything, take one pack of each style from somehwere like primark, and then u havent spent loads, and when you know what styles you like go out and buy some better looking stuff|`|0c7ff2733514381d048fdc22049ffd46aa	get over it.|`|UsUOZMLoaa	I don't know if you live in america or if wherever you live you have an old navy but i recommend that you should go there for underware. they have really comfortable and cute ones that are kind of sheerish on the butt part and they have lace around the outside they are very cute. and as for bra fittings i suggest victoria's secret. i don't think it cost and i don't think you are expected to buy that day. goooood luck :)|`|t52KOxw7aa	Aw, hun! I feel for you, I used to find underwear shopping so uncomfortable too.    I would recommend that you buy a couple packs of inexpensive underwear in lots of different styles and from a size 14 - 18 so you can experiment and see what works best for you. Cotton, breatheable, everyday stuff, not lacey, sexy stuff. We're looking for comfort here, not a striptease!    Yes, most bra fittings are free. I recommend you go somewhere like Marks & Spencer to get measured for the first time. And no, they don't expect you to buy a bra the same day! They'll take your measurements, and make you a few recommendations, but it's not like you're entering into a contract to buy the bras they recommend!    Good luck. x|`|PF1MSmauaa	First, get fitted. There is no obligation to buy.    Second, shop online. Find a brand you like and stick to it.    Third, when you find something you like, always order more than you need so you don't have to go through the process too often.    Good luck.
BlYigFk7aa	NO DONT!!!! TRUST ME I DID ONE OF THOSE THINGS POINTLESS AND THEY CHARGE U LIKE A DOLLAR FOR EVERTIME THEY TEXT YOU, WHICH IS LIKE EVERYDAY TELLING YOU TO DO THESE THINGS, SO I WOULDN'T REPLY AND U SHOULD TRY TO GET WHOSEVER SENDING YOU THOSE TEXT CANCELLED BECAUSE THEY CHARGED ME A DOLLAR A DAY AND THAT ADDS UP|`|l07U1NiWaa	its fake.|`|FklngtvCaa	Don't do it, they're all scams.

lK7RSKTUaa	use a diffuser and flip you heard over when you use it. also try root lifer Aussie make a good one|`|8ACdEaC5aa	instead of scrunching it put curling cream in it!|`|wL7v53Unaa	You could put some rollers the size of the curl you want in the front of your hair,then after its dry brush it out or run your fingers through it and it will be a bigger wave|`|QAfhyMCVaa	o man I have that same problem! I'm gonna check back to see the other answers|`|coIIoUd6aa	like your bangs??  the best way to make your bangs fall over your face like that is too blow dry them right infront of your face like you had front bangs. and then straighten them with a little bit of a curvee and they should go perfect !|`|jZUSCoafaa	Stick your finger in a light socket.
r1SG2ebIaa	as its a short dress you can wear heels, although dolly shoes maybe more comfortable, u could try some of them roman sandal things too, i had to wear flat shoes under my prom dress cuz my dress was too short for me to wear heels, i ended up wearing so really uncomfortable flat sandals which kinda sucked cuz i was sitting down alot and ended up taking them off. a stilletto heel would look best i think but make sure ther comfortable ones or u wont enjoy your night as much as you could do or ul end up walking around in bare feet (which hurt when other people wear heels and not look where they put their feet) or wear wellies and make a statment|`|NQRXKTgRaa	http://apps.facebook.com/fashionbookmark...|`|xqfbtYkHaa	Tht dress is ugly. no offence|`|YoY8fyqzaa	http://i3.ebayimg.com/03/i/001/00/be/87a...    http://www.shoewawa.com/caovilla-rosette...    I think the second pair would go better with your dress, but that all depends on whether you want a flower on your foot.  Could be somewhat uncomfortable.|`|t52KOxw7aa	This is sort of like what I wore to my formal last year! I opted for nude shoes, to make my legs look even longer. (I'm tall too, 5'11"!)    I wouldn't really recommend any colour other than nude with a white dress, and you'll need to get a good tan so you don't get washed out by it too!  The shoes I wore had a 5" heel, a platform, a tapered stiletto heel and a pointed toe.    Like these, just not red and patent: -     http://www.faith.co.uk/productdetails.as...    Hope this helps. Have fun at your prom. x|`|Vb5eRM0Qaa	http://www.charlotterusse.com/product/in...    http://www.charlotterusse.com/product/in...|`|Fc0KEzYFaa	I don't think you should wear anything.  Be naked.  :D
lHCZUPm2aa	Ok, well, my first suggestion would be to avoid anything uber trendy. You will regret going overboard "scene" and this whole phase will be something you cringe at in the future. Try something a little more classic.    As we can't see your picture, I have no idea what your hair length, type, or texture is. So, I'm just going to answer you as if it's straight and average. If it's on the longer side, try keeping it long on the top/front so you get long sweeping bangs, and then add lots of layers into the back and sides. If it's way too short for that, go for a pixie cut. Just make sure it works with your face shape. Good luck!|`|RZ4l6s65aa	private photobucket|`|2aN5xcvVaa	you can frost the tips!  or use a comb and some gel, and spike it alittle.
9Rmd1IVVaa	Right now your chances seem pretty good.  Eat plenty of greens...  I think it depends on how old you are whether or not you'll keep growing.  Try to stay away from heels as much as possible,  because wearing them stunts your growth.|`|HeRIwZRLaa	depends on your genes, are you family tall... mum, dad, brothers and sisters.   if they are tall then you will be tall. around the same height|`|SCTMtrjhaa	Well it depends on you age.    Guys- stop growing at 18  Girls stop growing at 16    So if you are under 16 than yes, your growth plates still have more growing to do. If you are over 16, your growth plates are done growinG!|`|3OeE8kMQaa	Ummmm... you answered your own question it's difficult to decipher... The average runway model is 5'9" and weigh about 110lbs, and have an BMI of about 16... it's a ridiculous standard and for most extremely unhealthy even deadly.|`|P53btYb6aa	It would help to know how old you are.  You stop growing, in height at about 16 or 17|`|QAfhyMCVaa	Depends how old you are. People can still grow in their 20's|`|aU32ilTwaa	If your younger than 16 then yes you are likely to grow more. If you are inbetween 16 and 18 you might but not a lot.
QAfhyMCVaa	thats tough one i think it depends on how the hair looks on the guy|`|HhmhSBpgaa	That is all personal opinion. It is how you carry yourself and your confidence that carries off a style.|`|1M9w6gdnaa	I think the buzz cut|`|ksvpQOOPaa	somewhere inbetween. longish bt not as long as shoulders.|`|3jD57QwNaa	dude it depends. if you have hair that looks really good long flaunt it, because some girls will LOVE IT.  to me short hair is too formal and cant do much with, and long hair tends to be really needy.   In the middle is perfect, for me it is.   its not too needy and when there's a formal event it does not throw off your "look".   it can look good for all situations.|`|VdjmrwMZaa	surfer hair...  or big spiky yokes goin on|`|1TTKHz0haa	SHORT|`|x8Ji7sDXaa	it all depends on the girl. but i definetly don't like a buzz cut or should length, so somewhere in between for me.|`|xrZafbh1aa	In between, but more on the short side.
r4i7xPnMaa	It's not really unhealthy, provided you take care of your eyebrows afterward (aloe vera gel for the win!), and don't do it more than twice a month. I used to know a girl that got it done every week, and that seemed like it could be overkill, as the skin around your eyes is pretty sensitive.  Try for every other week, and just keep a pair of tweezers around to pluck out any pesky hairs that spring up in between waxings.    Good luck!|`|03ec65bf77c70de35e61bf195676e487aa	It certainly hasn't hurt me and I've done it for years.|`|7QZvIab6aa	yup..  why wouldn't it be healthy??...  makes u gorgeous duh!!:]|`|lNqSx1znaa	I've been doing it for years, and I've never had a problem. My girlfriend does threading instead--that's an option.|`|60668e20144a7d7b9a1bd023ec2a40fcaa	Nobody said being pretty was easy or painless- suck it up and let 'em rip those straggly eyebrow hairs out!|`|ZRhWkSIiaa	Yup just go to a salon and get it done....easy to mess it up if u do it  yourself.|`|zFvmW0EAaa	no its full of cholesterol and fat|`|f0a65c9a2c03d345ba6be884d69e7908aa	gets you laid.  Sex is exercise so yes it is healthy|`|zWX5GDehaa	I don't recommend it. Try tweasing.|`|d53GV2W0aa	as long as you're not allergic to the wax|`|8XqzxKz9aa	As in it could kill you someday? I think not. The only thing I can think of that may effect you is if your allergic to the wax.|`|TUdTYTefaa	over time, waxing can cause your skin to droop a little from being stretched by pulling the wax.  I recommend threading.  It may not be as fast as waxing, but i think the end result is better and gives a cleaner look.
AA10236815	artistry essentials balancing lotion with spf 15.     http://aorihuela.qbeautyzone.com/|`|igrdohopaa	Olay (= or maybe lubriderm|`|DJqDAKmDaa	honestly.. for the winter I would deffinitely recommend CLINIQUE Moister Surge. It comes in a jar, and the gel is pink! It's really really really good! Go to any Macy's, Boston's, or Saks. Ask for a trial version or to try some on. They're usually good with that! Otherwise another really great moisturizer is called "Hope in the Jar" I believe by Makeup Forever. You can find this at Ulta or Sephora or online! Both these products are a little pricey, but a little goes a long way and you will not REGRET the products, they are worth every penny. Not only that you notice the smoothness of your skin and when applying foundation on, it'll feel very smooth!|`|hVKYVJ89aa	Simple's Hydrating Light Moisturiser|`|2U27BgmKaa	I use a mixture of Dermalogica Barrier Repair and Dermalogica Skin Smoothing Cream. If you like Cate Blanchett, Victoria Beckham, Katie Holmes, Vivica A. Fox, and Isla Fischer's skin, they all use Dermalogica. It's the most amazing line ever! I actually spend less in the long run since I use so little, even if I'm spending more at one time. They also do a face mapping so that you can determine your skin type and perfect products (they have a lot!). Here's there website if you'd like to check it out. Good luck!  http://www.dermalogica.com/us/index.html...|`|MjKOBQQqaa	The best moisturizer to use is a deep moisturizing serum.    The layer of skin underneath the top layer that is visible is also dry.    Typical moisturizers will only be able to moisturize the visible layer of skin alone. As a result your skin will still feel dry and stiff.    Deep moisturizing serums are designed to treat underneath the skin where it provides moisture to the visible layer of skin as well as the layers underneath it.    In order to get smooth, hydrated skin choose deep moisturizing serums along with normal moisturizers.|`|HeRIwZRLaa	E45. cream, its really good. :)|`|f6CwdB2haa	i guess ponds white beauty....garnier n lakme strawberry one!|`|ZAhiAlScaa	i Absolutely adore the Regenerating Green Tea Firming Cream, its so moisturizing and firming, and smells just Fabulous!

z8p0jtoBaa	The Chi flat irons are spendy, but AMAZING!|`|9zHKn4Bdaa	I'd recommend a Chi flat iron. They are really the best money can buy. They keep the hair shaft smooth and the cuticle closed which in effect will keep your hair shiny and smooth.|`|hiH6j2lZaa	I am a licensed cosmetologist. The best brand of strightners is defintly the Chi. The others dont last long and dont get to the heat you need. I would just a heat spray, like Heat Therapy by Paul MItchell to use on your hair. I would suggest spraying the product on after shampooing and conditioning, blow dry then straighten it. I do it every day and my hair is very health. The key to healthy hair is a heat therapy product,
iN6ZgpNgaa	Just be yourself.  If you put on a show at first and it slowly disappears then what are you gonna tell him.  I bet your pretty.  Good luck.|`|0t8Kzrvkaa	Tell him yes you want to go out with him.  The famous black dress that shows off your curves works best.  Wear your hair down on your shoulders, accent with a necklace and earrings, and for make-up be more daring.  Perfume- apply on wrist and rub wrist on sides of neck.  I can't tell you what to say, but don't overdo the flirting or he'll think you're cheap.  Tilt your chin up off to the side and give him a sexy look every now and then.  He'll think your high-class and he's gonna want to see that sexiness in the bedroom (when the time is right).  You just want to show him what he could have if he plays the game right.  You'll know whether he is interested in you almost immediately.  Good luck!!!|`|4SfTsbDeaa	Just Make eye contact, and compliment him, wear eyeliner, and just walkpast him every now and then, make any small conversation.    Trust me, got me with my Girlfriend|`|HeRIwZRLaa	You dont need to make yourself look nice to make him notice you, if he likes you he will notice you whatever your wearing or look like.   Be yourself around him, talk to him and when you know he likes you then flirt.

Kt84kDvEaa	She's looks rather natural. Here's what I recommend:    1) Get a tan. She is a tan girl.  2) Fill in your eyebrows with a pencil that is one shade darker than your hair color. Also let them grow a bit thicker.  3) Invest in a GOOD foundation. I think the MAC mineralize collection or MAC studio fix. She has beautiful sking and these are great for getting "celebrity skin".  4) LIGHT brown eyeshadow on the eyelids and highlight the brow bone with a pearly color.  5) Black eyeliner on top and bottom lids. Curl lashes and apply black mascara.  6) No blush. Buy some bronzer. Apply it to the apples of the cheeks and a SMALL AMOUNT to the chin, forehead, and, bridge of the nose.  7)Nude lipgloss.|`|kUZvraXVaa	The link to photos is forbidden. Cannot see the pics
2aN5xcvVaa	Don't wash your hair Saturday night!  before you go to bed put in a hairspray, or a voluming spray.  Do the same sunday morning  with a shiny spray ! :)|`|sm9NNdeqaa	it depends on how you sleep, you'll probably be fine you might just have to touch it up with a curling iron on sunday.. and maybe use an anti frizz product. i use john frieda finishing creme and you put it on dry hair and it gets rid of all the frizz it works really well [:|`|8ACdEaC5aa	as long as you dont wash it and dont sleep hard on it i think it will look fine
AA11381060	ebay is a very popular site and jewellry goes well on there, it would probably be your best bet. with the bid system u may even get more than your reserve. as chris suggested though make sure u get a valuation from a reputable jeweller first.    failing ebay, try your local paper or the free ads such as gumtree etc.    hope u get a good price.|`|xdyM3IVmaa	That's a problem with diamonds... they have absolutely NO resale value whatsoever. Best bet? List it in your paper or ebay or craigslist, hopefully someone who doesnt know any better will pay you what you want.|`|AA11230878	Visit different jewellers in your area and get an average price then place it on eBay with a minimum figure. Be sure to give a full description, ring size carat size etc which helps the buyer.  Good Luck|`|rsFWSelnaa	send it to me i will give you 10|`|Gew6pZhbaa	Ebay, the newspaper, or local treasure hunts.

fvre0o9laa	Not really, but there are a few tricks.  You'll want to use chlorine resistant nylon-lycra for women's suits, and any of a number of different fabrics for men's suits... supplex is popular for trunk styles, nylon-lycra for speedo styles.     Good book, complete with thorough instructions and a good basic women's pattern:  Kwik Sew's Swim and Action Wear: http://kwiksew.com/Catalog/Book_Swim.cfm  It'll teach you to sew, fit and redesign women's suits.  Another source for information: http://www.patternschool.com    Important things:     1) chlorine-resistant fabric and elastics unless you know the suit is never going into a commercial pool or hot tub.    2) spread the fabric on paper (something about newsprint is fine) and pin it to the paper, on grain.  Pin your pattern to fabric + backing paper, and cut all three layers to get an accurate cut.    3) instead of using lining, consider using two layers of the outer fabric -- it seems to double the life of the suit compared to using swimming suit lining.|`|TbV9RHd7aa	My mom once told me that my grandma used to sew swimsuits. It looks like it is impossible to do that but it can be done.    I can give u an advice about that : Even if you work hard to sew swimsuits they won't be just like you want them. To sew swimsuits you sholud have specific sawing machines { u should be very good at using them } My mom showed me a pair of swimsuits that my grandma had sew , and they didn't look that good.    If u think u are a specialist at sewing swimsuits ,do it.   If u don't , give up. [ or U can just practise it for fun ]|`|Kbgc6x5raa	not at all. at least i don't think so. it's easy for me. look on the tags of some of the bathing suits you already have and then use the material that it says that those suits are made of. the most important part about it is that you get thick thread since chlorine and other chemicals will make it weaker to a point.  hope i helped.

KNDCJbREaa	Most of the worlds stock of natural pearls has already been gleaned from the sea;  Today, the natural pearl ( pearls which are no cultured) market is an exclusive market, marked by rare new discoveries, it is bolstered by the return to the market place of notable and sometimes historic privately held pearls.     For example, La Peregrina, a pear shaped white occidental pearl, from its sixteenth century discovery off the coast of Panama, through its possession by adventurers and European sovereigns to the present owner, the royal icon of American beauty, Elizabeth Taylor.  Richard Burton bought this historic pearl from Sothebys Auction House in 1969 for $37,000: the cost of a nice house in San Francisco at the time.     International auction houses around the world have been realizing increasingly higher prices for natural pearl necklaces and natural pearls in gold jewelry.  With prices moving easily into the millions of dollars, natural pearls are confirming their stature as the rarest of gems.( Fameo  sold  8mm round black natural South Sea pearl pendant for 43.000 GBP in 2008 - custom order )     Any natural gem quality pearl of any substantial size is truly the rarest of gems and collectors continue to realize their inherent and market value.    You can check prices of natural ( not cultured) Abalone  and Freshwater pearls at Multicolour.com|`|396d560ed84812cb1c44b3498e3939c7aa	If by "uncultured pearl" pearl you mean natural pearl, then it will be a collectors'  very expensive item. Cost would depend on the size, color and luster of the pearl. Could be anything between few hundred to few thousands dollars.|`|hKlApSxAaa	It would cost about 30.

1sfYOZNbaa	you can get body spray from victorias secret. its smells really good and its like $10 and you get a lot more that you do in perfume|`|lnUrm4sGaa	well if you have a tj hughes in your area you can get perfumes like britney spears stuff like that for 5.00 to 8.00|`|KaQ2h8LOaa	well if it smells then wth if it gud then buy although it cheap!!|`|rMKEFgYdaa	Don't bother buying the cheap stuff because it doesn't last as long as the good expsive perfume it costs more for a reason. Expensive perfume has less alchol in it so the frangrence lasts longer and is a better quality   Juicy couture is a great smelling perfume  Baby phat it one of the cheaper nice perfumes  Prada perfume is amazing but 100$ a bottle   Vera wang is also nice.  Also ralph lauren perfume is nice  Go to shopper drugmart and you will find all different types of perfume   Burberry is good too.|`|9FyxeA1Zaa	No matter what anyone says or thinks you never get the quality out of a fragrence unless your willing to pay the price tag     Personally i dont mind spending 30 - 50 on a nice bottle of eau de toilette     Save your pennys and get something worth it! :D For the time being just have go round getting some testers and see whats on the market :P
kv42U6yraa	It's actually not that difficult. Here are a few tips:     1 Put on a thin line of eyeliner. You can do any color, as long as you got the simular color in eyeshadow (like if you wanna do brown eyeliner, you should have brown eyeshadow). Put in your top eyelids in as thin of a line as possible and a quarter of the way from your outer eye on the bottom.     2 After applying eyeliner, take a smugding brush (or a eyeshadow brush with a pointed tip) and rub it in the eyeshadow. Smugde the eyeliner with it very gently.     3 For a deeper affect, make either the eyeliner thicker or apply more eyeshadow. Black would have the most affect.     4 Apply lots of mascara on your top and bottom lashes and a lighter shadow the eyeliner/eyeshadow on your eyelids.|`|6UKd0Gedaa	youtube it!|`|zUZRPmYAaa	grey eye shadow, right on the lid, and powder black (not liquid underneath)|`|SCTMtrjhaa	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KwS_0pCL...|`|l69tjl0paa	Here you go, taught by the pros!!!

Use a light (skin toned) colour all over the eye- lashes to brow.  2. Use a black eyeliner and use just above the lashes- doesnt matter too much if its a bit messy.  3. Use a cotton bud with a dark eyeshadow on it and go over the eyeliner- making it smudgy.  4. Line under the bottom lashes with a pencil eyeliner and smudge using a clean cotton bud.  5. Use a middle toned eyeshadow (an in-between colour of the ones using) and go over the lid of your eye and just up to the brow bone or just above the crease- which ever you like better.  6. Blend or smudge the middle colour upwards into the lighter colour- just the top edge of the middle colour so you still have colour on your lid.  7. Use mascara- and dont forget eyelash curler first- apply mascara to the bottom aswell-if you want.|`|zyTLj0jXaa	wasnt that popular like 3 years ago..|`|6S8BaJkuaa	The key to the perfect smoky eye is proper blending.

kv42U6yraa	With me, I'm very creative and I like to enhance my featers (like the color of my eyes) with make-up. I do make sure it 1) looks good on me 2) I don't wear to little or it and 3) wear it for the right occasions. I actually only wear make-up a few times every couple of weeks, not every day. I don't wear it because I think I'm ugly or because I really need it. I wear it because it's fun to put on... and because my boyfriend loves my flavored lipgloss!|`|TIDqJgdSaa	i just started wearing eyeliner..  i didnt wear before cause i was scared my parents wouldnt like me wearing it..  until she told me she doesnt mind it :)  so know i wear eye liner..  and i want new make - up that will make me look good.. but havnt found any yet..  =/|`|AaYEgDwWaa	I wear it to Enhace my natural beauty. and I love it, and I wear it to also express my self ;)|`|ohsxAbeuaa	people who wear make up isn't because they have a low self esteem.your face is like a blank canvas and you get to apply as much or as little make-up as you want. its how you want to look not what others want you to look like. plus make up helps highlight your best features.like i have big eyes and a little bit of eyeliner helps pop them out. && everyone deserves to feel beautiful with or without make up.|`|EE8hw8Agaa	I wear makeup because its a way of expression for me,just like hair or style it can be easily changed to reflect your mood and feelings. Like "hey today im feeling sexy" or "im laid back today" iv always loved dressing up and makeup completes that. I dont wear it because i think im ugly without it,i am beautiful with it on or off,its just something i enjoy.|`|7QZvIab6aa	I wear make up because it makes me feel good about myself..and because I love doing make up not because I think I'm ugly without it..|`|Qgg6i6K7aa	I wear make up because I want to look diffrent when I go out.   Everyday the same look is not always good, change is great.|`|vlCWp7sSaa	I don't wear make up because I'm too lazy to apply it. Then I'm too lazy to remove it so then it ends up dripping down my face when I take a shower. lol. People are surprised just to see me wear like mascara. I used to wear foundation all the time but I got tired of buying it. I also tend to rub my eyes and itch my face a lot so it ends up coming off.    I think people wear makeup because they think it makes them "look better" but too much makeup looks dirty in my opinion. I think I read something about less is better.|`|QnSKaBcjaa	I wear a little and sometimes for the right occasion ill go heavier on the eye makeup. I dont wear face makeup.

Lipstick,mascara,eye shadow I dont do.  because my skin is buetiful with no cover ups and i have even clear skin.  So i have no need for the color.  Colorful eyes shadow I think is tacky looking.  And i dont like lipstick either.  But lip gloss all the way!|`|z8p0jtoBaa	Women (and men) have been wearing "make-up" since time began. It was once used to show level in class, along with hair color. Since then we have turned it into a materialistic view on being "beautiful" and whatnot.     Lets face it, none of the stars got famous for their inner beauty. We are all so shallow, including myself, that we are only concerned on what we look like and portray ourselves on the outside.    I wear make-up because I'm not comfortable with myself to NOT wear it. I'd rather spend money and time and make myself look better, and then I feel better when I look better. If that makes sense? We all have our insecurities, some people are ok with who they are, most of us aren't.    So the beauty industry rakes in millions of dollars every year. Please America, spend money on being beautiful!|`|Nd7rj4nnaa	personally, i don't need to wear makeup.. i do because i feel like it's a form of art, there are so many amazing things you can do with it and i think that itself is amazing. i look beautiful with or without makeup      although i always wear mascara because i loveee long eye lashes!|`|o1QViLtBaa	I don't wear make up every day but when I do it's because I want to spice up my look.  The foundation I do where, when I decide to fully do myself up, is a beautiful natural finish with SPF.  For the most part my make up routine consists of vibrant eye shadow and some gloss with a with a bit of mascara.  I don't do blush or bronzer or the extra stuff a lot of people do.    Most days all I do is wash/moisturize my face and apply my eye shadow.

EuwGku8vaa	I'm a relatively short guy (since you wanted us to answer.. Lol ;) ) and i think you look fine.. :) hope that helped! Peace!|`|r1D9P4Vyaa	Yes, you are better then ok, you look great! I love the long dark hair, you also have very pretty blue eyes!  The only thing I would change in that pic is crack a slight smile. I would say, 8 out of 10, 10 is very hard to get in my eyes!  Good Luck Girl!|`|ro3X9fs3aa	just dont be so weird and u will have a bf ur pretty|`|vJRMmgd6aa	wow you have beautiful eyes!!!!|`|gXxEsWcxaa	you are a verrrryy pretty girl!! (:  I love your eyes!!|`|6b6ff719959d29a5aa770465d592c901aa	Nice eyes. What do you have against tall guys, huh ?? Why cant I see and ans. ??|`|L2GigGU0aa	Wow. You have very black hair. I like it.   Your eyes are pretty. I would date you for your eyes alone.|`|klr6XhU6aa	u look good|`|6yIgck1Jaa	Yer quite pretty.   Ya you have a chance your eyes are gorgeous im jealous lol  Your hair is pretty dark thts why people think tht|`|kg0ig2Edaa	Do i have a chance of having a boyfriend? Are you serious?    If those are your natural eyes (Not contacts) then you have stunning eyes alone. Face is also pretty.     And as shallow as it sounds it also comes down to height weight etc..  For every guy there is a girl who will think hes the best looking guy alive and for every girl there is a guy who thinks she is the most beautiful female ever.    You are lucky as there will be loads of guys who will want to go out with you. Sure some may not say so or ask but they will be aware of you make no mistake.     I also think you will really grow into your face as it were and become even more attractive as time goes on.|`|d9d7dbffacb9c5256ef7afd69e6023b6aa	You look perfectly fine.    Most girls with really black hair dyed it, and so most everyone thinks all black hair is fake, unless you are Asian or Middle Eastern.    Short = cute for a whole lot of guys     You could be basketball shaped and still have a boyfriend, as long as you are little.
ovkS3dW3aa	Yes; I think it would be a great hairstyle for your beautiful long hair!!  Try to edge it up a bit by making the layers a little more pronunced! Im sure youll look gorgeous!!|`|14c85dc8b02a634af90573028da45e82aa	your hair looks the same as the picture just a little more flipped...yeah it'll look great!|`|A9RwFu6maa	You have the perfect hair for it..just make sure the stylist give you some well cut layers..it will look great|`|dnl0F7aTaa	It'll look beautiful on you!|`|mcomAA2eaa	yeah it would, it's already a little like that. (:|`|TuBzc1R5aa	yep, it will deff fit you!|`|EE8hw8Agaa	Oh I think it would look great! Your very fortunate to have naturally non-frizzy straight hair,so you should pull the layers off with minimal work.|`|QnSKaBcjaa	yes it would look great and yes you are gorgeous but didn't you just ask this the other day?

Yuk.|`|mU2eMSi3aa	The golden belt on her forehead is the best!  ha ha|`|M3Xmqlt8aa	I have no desire for that, it probably and would not fit me for one thing, LMAO and that belt on the head looks like somebody was long hours in the LSD to think it up. It goes to show people with money are not always sensible LOL|`|HZN6UFxyaa	NO!!!|`|MEPn7M7gaa	No, it looks like it was made with shoe laces or something :s.|`|yte0BzXKaa	It looks like some form of torture machine.|`|3sifr0MXaa	The model has no breasts.  I would wear it if I had as good of an azz as she does.  But I am sluttttie like that...
PBuYKm8Aaa	If it doesnt hurt wait a few days. I had my monroe pierced twice and it did this. Dark red can bee blood under the skin. If you're worried about it go back to the piercer and voice your concerns.|`|FS9ibKB5aa	no its not normal. its most likley infected. or you could be having an allergic reaction to the metal. you need to go see your body piercer asap.|`|01yBLHvWaa	darkish reddish? well it can be either infected or just the swelling around the piercing is making your skin tight and causing it to become red.    i would have to see it to know for sure. but since i cant i would recommend maybe going back to the piercer. are you rinsing the inside of your mouth with oral medication? NOT LISTERINE. & putting bactine spray around it? NOT ALCOHOL. hope this helps a little.
F5R3TJEQaa	yes you can its about how you brush it|`|p3GZERIsaa	Yep , just brush it differently... into the middle then put some sections to the side|`|QTZw8rwfaa	i gues so  if you part your bangs in the middle  works 4 me::P  also let hair dry natrually
MzZ1xenkaa	just wear them  i mean  how bad can it be   hahaha|`|AA11560862	If the shoes are too small, they can cut off your circulation, so if you really like those boots, don't wear them often.|`|ca7oHPHZaa	probably very bad|`|5jsMY4RIaa	return the boots! you're going to end up with horrible blisters and swollen feet sice the blood supply will be cut off.|`|igrdohopaa	If they're uncomfortable, return them!|`|QEqGukjZaa	very bad|`|36ukxyZPaa	Very bad.    Small shoes rot your brain, and make you infertile.      Its true.|`|AA10458195	My sister is 22 years older than I. She has terrible looking feet. My Dad said, it's because she always stuffed her feet into shoes that were  too small.  Her toes are twisted and hurt her if she stands or walks much.  I would not wear too small shoes no matter what.|`|eoOmeeJoaa	Very, Very Painful!
ZjYLTdovaa	well i don't think that you plan on keeping this polish on forever. personally i change my nail color each week and right now i have on a flourescent orange red thing that looks kind of ridiculous and last week i had a pretty well done french tip. so if you're feeling white nails this week, do those white nails girl!|`|RkimYgEtaa	I don't find it tacky or trendy ; I just wouldn't do it. If you are getting it done - do it professionaly or else it will look like you put white out on your nails... that's tacky !    If you have any questions about this or anything; contact me at;  curleynicole@ymail.com    Much love.|`|dkMceLYhaa	well my friend colored her nail white than she added little black dots which looked cool|`|xpZsYckoaa	i think its tacky|`|AA11560862	It depends on how smoothly it comes on. If the nail plosh looks like it's drying out or has no shine, so tacky. If the nail polish comes on nice and shiny, then trendy. Just don't forget to put on a clear coat after your while polish, to make the shine nice.|`|sWIDnaKDaa	i think personaly it is trendy my nails are white with pink pokidots i love them...hope i helped   lindsey b
yzxxYlPyaa	You have been thinking of shaving your head for so long now that if you really want to do it you don't have to ask your mother. It's easy to get 10 or 12 bucks. Pretend you go see a friend or something like that, stop at the first barber shop you'll find on your way and the man will be happy to shave your long shaggy hair. Once you get back home mother might scream for a few minutes but it won't last more than a half hour and everything will be back to normal.|`|hCI6HFEnaa	Tell your mom it's emotionally affecting you or something.    Or that you have headlice. Yeah.    Or better, GET headlice.|`|In9smecNaa	just do it?

db177321e144fc6c8411beb4480c3ae8aa	I wasn't aware you could have a tattoo put there....I'd say it's unwise because your mouth is obviously very vulnerable to infection - having ink injected inside of it is going to be risky and you're not going to be able to speak properly for days.      I know you don't care that no one will see it, but you wont be able to see it either!  Point?|`|q7I1Ek3kaa	I myself almost got a inner lip tattoo but 1 i had not money for any type of tatto..and 2 my boyfriend said he didn't like any types of tattoos at all so i said **** it......................mostly cuz i didn't have the money for it haha     BUT unlike everyone else here i think a lip tattoo is an excellent idea.  Its a tattoo that you wont regret when your 70 bECAUSEEEEEE of the fact that nobody can see it unless you show it.    Also I wanted to get one and put "**** off" or "i love you there" I thought the second one would be really sexy. but you have to consider a few things...1 is the inside of your bottom lip sexy? cuz sometimes there are veins poking out and the inside of the lip can just look nasty. 2. sometimes the tattoo wears off really easily some have even been rumored to wear off withing 2 weeks! It is because the mouth is always wet ...it just wears away...but I've also heard it can last a couple of years or more..depends on your mouth! 3. But I also have to think..I was wondering myself..if i pay for this tattoo I would like it to stay..and i dont think its worth the money if its just going to wear off...    But yes i think the inner lip tattoo is a very sexy very intimate and very private tattoo that is a great idea...    and there are pics of girls where they put the peace sign with their fingers pressed against their lower lip and then they just pull their lip down slightly and u can see that tattoo and its soooo hot. especially when you have a tongue ring with that..idk just looks sexy to me.     No girl homo.    Hope I could help you!|`|QnSKaBcjaa	why do people do that? no one can see it and when you get a glimpse of something dark in someones mouth it looks pretty gross|`|zvN64drnaa	yes.. idk if there is any risks but i wouldnt do it for shyt|`|5jsMY4RIaa	why would you do that?? no one would be able to see it unless you showed them the inside of your mouth. Plus I've heard that inner lip tattoos can get infected really easily since there are so many bacteria in your mouth.|`|dcNmRPGPaa	I've not seen an inner lip tattoo that hasn't worn off. those never last. too much moisture. don't waste your money.|`|AqyKqm75aa	no.|`|MXdIWxpOaa	it can get infected realy easily   also no afence but what is the point of gettin it done no one is goin to see it unless you show them its juts a waste of money to be honest  but if you wont it done then go for it its your decision|`|ZUdDbnnkaa	what is the point of the inner lip tattoo..   people can't even see it in the first place   and second its painFULLLL|`|01yBLHvWaa	i have one. it doesnt get infected BUT it does take a little longer to heal than most piercings because you cant put the A&D ointment on it (obviously)    also.. in time it will start to fade. because all the saliva & bacteria in your mouth will start to make it some what become lighter after a while. i mean i still LOVE mine. but its all on how you look at it.|`|yQdlquOHaa	I think it is a GREAT idea!  I have 3 stars on my left foot and a 4leaf clover on my right hip and i got both for reasons that were important to me.  I think everyone should do their own thing and be happy.. just dont do something you may regret later!  :)|`|ASSqyNDYaa	its not necessarily a bad idea but let me paint the picture here: it will fade away within 3 months-(THAT'S A FACT) you'll be paying for something that only you know its there.( why have a tattoo and not show it off) and you'll be wasting money for something that isn't really worth it. and i heard it hurts like hell! lol good luck

f4c9b396151517d48d609bd10ec49688aa	Hi, I love M.A.C Cosmetics too!  I feel like you would definitely need a high school diploma, but while you work on the diploma, see if you can get a job behind the counter at M.A.C or a store that carries M.A.C. products.  This will give you experience with the products, so you will have more to offer if you want to work at a higher level with M.A.C. after high school.  Good luck!
wmKKH0Otaa	THAT WEB SITE WAS DISGUSTING I WAS SHOCKED MYSELF!|`|ZkeoRyy3aa	yes mid late 20's....it begins.|`|3wvlYbD7aa	Welcome to real life.  The breasts you see in movies and magazines are fake.  Either air-brushed or surgically enhanced.  Real women don't look like that, and if they do, then they are extremely lucky.  The majority of breasts are uneven and misshapen.    I'm very sorry your fantasy of breasts was shattered.  If you continue to look for perfection, you'll be looking for a very long time.|`|E6A8MKZwaa	Haha, yes, welcome to reality.  There's things you can do to take care of your breasts, like massages and exercises, that help them stay/get rounder and perkier and more beautiful, but a lot of it is genetics and just how are bodies are.  Very few women actually look like air brushed models that we're told we're supposed to look like.    *sigh* Now if only the men could get a grip on reality so they would know not to expect those perfect airbrushed models when they get married.  We are all very deceived by the media.  It makes it very hard to be content and confident.|`|dAIL4ZImaa	What do you mean is this real... these are as real as it can get. That's a werid question if this was real or not.
g5jhXcssaa	It felt like a part of me was getting put in the right place, it was always supposed to be there.  I was really nervous, obviously because no matter how many people you ask you have no idea how it's going to feel for you, but after I was really excited, even though it feels really gross.  I just wanted to keep looking at it :)|`|4OL8VRzNaa	If you really want it you should get it. Some people are so excited that they dont even feel pain. But when you older some of your opinions will change because it can fade away in your skin or leave marks|`|U7Hez33caa	I Was 13 When I Got My First One, So I was Very Excited Before Getting It And After When I Realized It Didn't Hurt As Bad As I Imagined.. Now I Have Six And Still Adding On!|`|IrqIcx34aa	I was nervous because I don't like pain. I also was nervous because I traveled a long distance to get mine from some guy I met on the internet. I also got it for free because it is in memory of my son. I got it on my left arm ( upper ). It didn't hurt at ALL. I was very surprised. I felt a sense of pride actually when I walked out of the tat shop.|`|C4bxnKDXaa	Yes it does actually...they do feel like they were missing from my boddy and after I got them it kind of made me feel like more of myself|`|rff71wi4aa	no i didn't feel like the tattoo was a part of me.    and i was not nervous intell i sat down in the chair but after the first time they hit me with the needle i was fine    and it felt great knowing i had a new tat|`|f7l9byFGaa	I was extremely nervous with my 1st tattoo.  Once I got it and walked out I felt great and thought it was the greatest thing in the world.  Honestly, now I regret it because I wish I would have gotten something different.|`|uARQSXomaa	Let me tell you about the first one:    Several friends had decided to get tattoos and I had drawn up the flash for mine. I think I was seventeen at the time, and it didn't really feel like it was supposed to be. It felt like a really big deal, but it wasn't the ink so much as the act of getting it that seemed significant. I was extremely conscious that this was a moment of coming of age.    I thought the flash I'd drawn was really cool, and it looked awfully big. I was really nervous. I thought it was going to hurt a lot. (It didn't hurt nearly as much as I expected -- in fact I remember being a little disappointed, thinking that such a life-altering experience should have hurt more).    After it was done, I was worried how my parents would respond. I actually tried to hide it from them, but eventually slipped up and let my mom see me with just a white t-shirt on - she could see through it...     I was surprised at the reactions I got from my friends. Some seemed surprised that I had done it.    Sometimes I was surprised when I would catch a glimpse of the ink in the mirror, but eventually it became part of my body-image, so that I expected it.    In retrospect the ink from that first tat is way too small. Its a little indistinct, and not nearly as cool as I thought it was. I still have it and while I have added new ink elsewhere, I have never covered the first one. It reminds me of what it was like getting it, and that sometimes I need to think through things a little more thoroughly ... if I had I still would've gotten it ... but it would have either been in a different spot or it would've been a lot bigger.|`|YIplumj8aa	When I know what I want tattooed, the location for it always just comes to me - like that's where it belongs.  And before (the days leading up to and including the process) I am always very excited.  During the process, sometimes it's painful but sometimes it's an adrenaline rush and you don't even remember most of the time you spent just sitting there or laying there.  After it's healed, it's like "tada"!  It's a sort of satisfaction, like here is what the newest form of myself looks like.  And I always feel more complete; like I'm slowly getting to where I need to be.  It's a wonderful feeling!|`|AA12149303	I have 8 tats and I love them all. They are unique to me and I'm not ashamed of one!|`|wP480B6Waa	My tattoo is of my sons name on my ankle and after I had it done it felt just natural to have it there. I was very nervous to get it since it was my first tattoo and I did feel sick while I was getting it sinc eI guess you are supposed to eat before you get one done.     I was so excited though afterwards that everythign else didn't matter. Although after I had it done then the fear of ink poisoning came into my mind but that didn't happen which I didn't think it would have.|`|JC9F4C2Taa	I don't really get nervous before getting a tattoo. I get anxious. I just want it to be over. I want to look down and see the new peice of art work I have added to my collection. Its not really painful, just after awhile the area is irritated, & when they go back in to shade or add color it can be very sensitive.|`|hldaLhKkaa	I like both of mine. It was only novel to me for a few wks, then they just became part of me. Now I would feel naked w/o them!|`|PBuYKm8Aaa	All my tattoos mean something to me... even though they may look silly to others i have a story behind each and every one.     1st tattoo- I got a star on my lower back when i was only 13 years old. I was so excited, because the star i choose means protection and hope. And at that point i needed it. I was scared about how it would feel or how i would react to the pain.    2nd- My brother had passed when i was 15 so i had a rose and a cross on tattooed on my ankle for him. I was very excited and proud of myself.    3rd and 4th- I had a green dino tattooed on my left forearm when i was 17 and the little mermaid tattooed on my right when i was 18. I never get to see my sisters so i had them draw pictures for me. [of course the tattoos are better looking than the drawings, but its the concept that counts lol] At this point it became like a drug to me. I get excited when i modify my body. It makes me feel more and more whole.    My 5th and most recent tattoo is of a bright green music note that is on my tragis. [the thingy on ya earrrr]...pretty much on my  face...but i swear it looks good. lol. I was the most excited about this. It signifies my lifes work of being a hip hop and hip hop pointe dancer. Music is everything to me.      I couldnt imagine being me with out my tattoos.|`|AA10817618	When I was getting it done, it didn't feel real to be honest it's special to me, it's got middle name, which was my grandmother first name, and it's her signature on my shoulder it's very special. I want another tattoo, it's been a few years since my first one but I'm still planning it out. I was nervous a little bit, and during I was afraid I would start crying or move when I wasn't supposed to.  I felt good, proud to have a special and personal tattoo on me. It stung for a while when it was first being done, then I got used to it the buzzing is actually calming to me, other people hate it but I didn't mind.|`|V7EJdsF1aa	my first one was an impulse, no time to think and i loved it. but after awhile i wanted something bigger so thats when yesterday i went and got it bigger i knew i was getting it and i had time to freak out a little but i wasn't that bad. i enjoyed myself and i love it!
zzkmdusEaa	You are a doll! You have the prettiest blue eyes and great figure, but the gauges aren't doing it for me, those aren't my cup of tea and in my taste I would say size them down but hey if you like them then don't worry about what others think. You definitely have alot going on for you though and rate pretty high in my books.|`|mvAgLB9laa	Very interesting look, I love it!! Second picture the best your feet look so hot and I would want to c*m on them..|`|QnSKaBcjaa	you have a very intresting look. you are pretty. id give you a 7.5 or 8. i like your hair alot.  are those contacts or your real eye color?|`|MdJ2JVoDaa	ewww if you were going to get gauges then you should of gotten black ones and you should size them down too.|`|vCIZM7gtaa	It is such a shame to see a beautiful girl ruin her looks by getting a piercing on their nose with makers them look like a bull and getting them silly things in their ears which makes them look like an elf. I am 17, and female, and I really don't see any point.|`|o9XAcB4Taa	Size down your gauges definitely   I can't actually tell what your face looks like|`|6487bd61ef059cac042d49119a814a4aaa	If you were going for scary. You got it just right.  Too bad cuz you probably were pretty before you started mutilating yourself.|`|WyRZhqi4aa	I dig your look.  I don't understand why people consider piercing/tattooing ways to ruin somebody's beauty. They're prettier than spray-on tans and highlights.|`|eHflURByaa	Whaaaaaaaat the hell are these things in your ears ??????  I'm very traditional and I never saw something like this  EEEEEEEW|`|AHzSxpF0aa	I think you are gorgeous.|`|YFH5uqi2aa	You are seriously gorguous!!! your eyes are really pretty and your hair is too!! But the gauges...not so much i think you should size them down!!!! that is the only thing i dont like, the rest of yourself is pretty!|`|ORh0POkiaa	gauges are gross and they smell really bad.i don't personally like the bull piercing or the lip ring plus it's bad for like growing bacteria .i think yu should get your nose pierced and your eyebrow would go with your style.you have very pretty eyes 10|`|rtucR0Vhaa	What the in the world is that thing in your ears?!|`|VmSKQ40Caa	You looked great in the first two pictures, but I wanted to see you without sunglasses to judge you better, then when I finally hit the last picture, you show your nice eyes, but the picture was just taken poorly...I need you to upload another picture without your sunglasses on, from slightly farther away for me to judge you better.|`|gdGDvWTDaa	ewwwwwwwwww. im sorry but gauges are grosss      your pretty, but your style kinda creeps me out :o|`|IVF4lyJdaa	Your gorgous. I love your tatoos they def suit you, but i dont know about the gauges. You have this look to you where id see you with a cute diamond nose stud, cool a s   s tattoos and like a monroe or eyebrow pericing im not sure about the nose one you have now. You look too old for the peircings you have. but thats just my opinion, if they make you happy keep em.
oK0dVX6eaa	Proactive has worked great for me!!!! I live by it now, if it worked for you then go back to what you know. I have been using it for about 3 years and the only time I get a break out is when it's close to that time of month and then it's only a small one that will surface. So again I say if you have used it and know that it works why bother with the experimenting? Go ahead and get what works to you can feel better about the situation.     Proactive for me took longer than the 60 day guarantee, I tried it twice before I finally stuck with it. If I hadn't seen any results in the first two months I was ready to go and get my money back! But my one of my friends (also a faithful user) said it will take longer than that just keep it up and you 'll see.....and she was right:-)|`|AA11106727	I really don't recommend Proactiv, the toner is okay,  but it doesn't give you a glow like they say, It dried my skin out really bad. I'm 16 and I don't have sensitive skin, but I was walking around with a scaly fish face.  Totally embarrassing!    You might want to use Skin ID    Good luck!|`|ZjYLTdovaa	Acne Free!    It works better than proactive and skinID just sounds ... like it wont work out properly.

Why would you ask someone else what to put on your body. I have several tattoos and I don't regret any of them because I never let anyone else have anything to do with the decision of getting them. They all have special meaning to me.|`|nBWhSex3aa	there are a lot of cool things you get: koi fish, some latin, dragonfly's, lily pads but if your friend doesn't know what he wants then he shouldn't be trying to think one up. A tattoo is something meaningful to yourself and if your on Y!A asking what to get then its not time for a tattoo just yet|`|DpvXEd3Naa	Dragons|`|wziUVyVoaa	He could get his initials on the backs of his biceps. I've always thought that was cool. Like if his name were Adam Oxford, he could get "A" in old english letters on the back of his left arm, and "O" in old english letters on the back of his right arm. When people would be behind him, they'd see AO. I also like the idea of having either your parents names or your grandparents names on top of eachother, with the chinese symbol for love in between them. Like if your grandparents names were Tom and Louise, the name Tom on top, the Chinese symbol for love, and the name Louise on bottom. A tattoo I've been considering is something personal. I support our troops, but I am strongly against the IDEA of war. I've been contemplating getting a tattoo of a large peace sign, with the colors red white and blue in the 3 spaces, showing that I supported our country, but disagree with war. Tattoos are personal but I can understand looking for inspiration =). I saw a tattoo of Freddy Kreuger on some guy I met once, and I was immediately attracted because of that tattoo haha. Maybe he could get his last name in old english letters across the top of his back? Or maybe his initials on one side of his chest?|`|e2990eb46d523c3852908ba44a7cff02aa	a penis on your face?|`|b6rjAVFAaa	get a tribal sleeve that goes all the way up your arm and cups your left peck or boob perfectlyl. suuper sweet|`|x5ygIz3oaa	get like a fav quote or design|`|bldzLsmkaa	well it depends on what this guy likes does he want like writing or dragons,or skullz or his fam. crest ... wut?|`|4gytoih8aa	a big star on the chest,|`|if9ep7p0aa	your asking ppl what you should permanently draw   on your self???......  ........    a lil butterfly ...lol...|`|L1WjY5Xqaa	Try researching other tattoo designs through tattoo magazines.

ZjYLTdovaa	set a time limit for yourself: if in 2 months you are still undecided about breast implants that set the decision off for another year. you'll feel so different in a year! circle the date on your calendar and everything.    there are plenty of risks with surgery and not to mention the money you'd be forking out. and on top of that your breasts could come out looking incredibly funky. and then you'd have to have more surgery to fix it ... its all vrey unnecesary. get a push up bra in teh mean time and laugh at those girls with the big saggy titties (cuz you know they're saggy ...)    besides guys really like that whole .. flat chested thing sometimes. and more often guys are really put off by the stiff plasticness of fake boobies. only pervy nasty guys are into that sort of thing ...|`|D0SB7xdsaa	from a guy: don't do it unless it really, really bugs you.

My mom had a double mastectomy and was going to get fakes put in but the doctor says they have to be redone in 5-10 years and that's in all cases.

Most are relatively minor though, although like any surgery, there is the risk of serious infection. The main risk depends on the type of implant. It's quite possible for scar tissue to form around the implant, and for them to go all hard, and painful. This happened to me.     Just make sure you go to a good surgeon, and have proper aftercare.|`|ahS4TuSEaa	If you get pregnant, your breasts will grow and you will get curves.  I knew a woman from work who was a stick and when she got pregnant, I think she was just as happy about the changes to her body as she was about having the baby.  Having kids at your age also reduces the chances of getting breast cancer.|`|5pgVIlLFaa	Instead of working on your cup size you should work on your self esteem. I'm sure you are a very pretty girl. Besides, you can always tell when a girl has fake boobs so you won't be foolin anyone.  Be who you are.|`|CX6zADrjaa	I'm a guy, so from a guys perspective, no it's not worth it.    In my opinion, it's much better to be confident with yourself and be true to yourself then base what you do on other ppl's opinions, i think if a girl does that it's pathetic, god gave us our bodies and we should be happy with them. that's just my honest opinion. focus on something other then looks cause looks fade, if you want someone to see you for who you are, getting implants will distract them from that. and they'll like you for a false reason.    best of luck with ur choice. (:|`|tA8T4QYFaa	They can greatly enhance your self esteem, you can wear more attractive fashions, look good in a bathing suit, etc. You will receive more attention than you might have been used to.    There are risks of infection, eventually they'll have to be replaced (10+ years).    Cost is around $5K unless you do additional things like nipple reduction.    If you get C's you'll be very happy with the results.|`|ofd2upYSaa	they're not worth it. you can almost always tell when someone has implants.  i'm not much bigger than you and i know how you feel.

Embrace the style of your body, you can wear the high fashion stuff with that sort of frame and carry it off.

If it is to get more attention from guys I would say so. If its just to make your self feel better, umm idk if it would be worth the money. Either way, you should love your self for who you are. Oh, and you should really do your research on who to do it. you don't want someone who is going to leave them crooked or one bigger than the other. that will make you more self conscious.|`|VL0FwgaOaa	It all comes down to what makes you feel comfortable, not what anyone else thinks. I think people like Kate Hudson for example or Gwen Stefanie.. they both have small frames and are small and they are both confident and gorgeous. You can tell they aren't ashamed. I think a lot of women in magazines and on tv have implants or have their boobs air brushed or pushed up to the max and it makes girls with smaller boobs feel insecure. A lot of guys really do like smaller, natural boobs. Some guys like fake, some like massive... everyone is different, so it's ok for you to be different as well! :) I do know a few people that have had implants and it has majorly boosted their confidence, but then I have heard horror storys about girls that wish they never would of because the doctor did an awful job. Think about it really hard before you do it and make sure that you really can't be happy with your body the way that it is before you do it. The best of luck to you with your decision!

zDFvK2O2aa	Some people seem to always look like they're refreshed and ready to seize the day; others have bags under their eyes that could dwarf some of the luggage that comes out of JFK airport. These dark circles or bags are formed by fat and fluid that settles into the area, and there are a number of reasons they appear, including genetics, aging, fluid retention, and allergies. Moreover, they can appear darker under the eyes because the skin under the eyes is especially thin; this thin skin sits on top of areas that are dark red or purple in color; and the area is more likely to become puffy, casting shadows that make the bags look even more pronounced.    Hope this helps :D|`|jjeYCrYzaa	If you become to tired or you don't drink enough you can get bags under your eyes.

For example, I find a figure like Christina Hendricks to be very beautiful.|`|4PQOiSfZaa	Hourglass figure is considered to be more appealing, but it's not the ideal body shape. Most women aren't hourglass shapes. Most women are more rectangular in shape. But women with hourglass body shapes produce more estrogen and are more fertile compared to the rest.|`|qLfiyRLAaa	i have no clue y?????|`|0G1fOjpWaa	I wish I had an hourglass figure but I haven't, my waist isn't small enough or my bust big enough!:)lol. An hourglass figure is still considered the ideal because it represents fertility and health in a female. To have an hourglass figure you need to have your waist 10 inches or more smaller than your hip and bust measurements. I personally don't know anyone with that kind of figure though. There was a study done on this in the uk and only 8% of women were hourglasses, 45% were rectangular shaped, 25% were spoon/pear shaped and the rest were  cone shaped.|`|yfZ5YSp4aa	I would KILL for an hourglass figure!

Z2f5Ka6jaa	Here in the U.S. we usually tip our hairstylists about 20% of the bill. (I always tend to tip more than that).  Yeah I think 10 and maybe a nice thank-you card would be really great.  It's hard to find a good stylist.|`|Vhq3GURQaa	The rules are generally, if the owner of a salon does you (hair, nails whatever) it is not obligatory to tip at all. It is your discretion. Otherwise when an employee does it, 15 to 20 % of the cost of the hairstyle (don't include the shampoo in the tip unless she did that also). Shampoo girl usually gets $2.00 US If she is an employee, make sure you slip her your phone number in case at some point she moves to another salon. Don't make it obvious to the owner though.|`|PeNTl6KOaa	hmmm it wud be a bit wierd going in and giving her a 10    wait 6 weeks to get it done again, then give her like a 5|`|7ddRIZxIaa	haha lucky you!  last hair cut i had was terrible  get her a thankyou card and a bunch of flowers or something, i would be pleasantly surprised with that ;)|`|elY5vkVyaa	If you have a regular hairdresser then tip her 10-15% so that you'll get the VIP treatment every time. At 16 years old you probably don't have much money so just tip what you can, I'm sure she'll appreciate the gesture.|`|VNm1GIHLaa	Keep your money for next time.|`|kpzOShYyaa	just pop into make a new appointment for your 6 month trim or however often you have it, and if you see her casually say i love my hair btw thankyou, and offer her about 5 depending how much money you have,dont pay her loads because you did pay her the reccomended price but if you want to give her at the most 10. and just say thankyou so much and be nice and she will continue to make your hair nice :)|`|W89Q30J7aa	On average you tip 10% of the final cost, dont go in tomorrow, book in for a 6week trim and tip extra :)|`|jez0O0bXaa	15- 20 percent is normal tipping for any service.  Think of it this way a stylist isn't just another person just serving you (like a Waitress) she is giving you her undivided attention, listening  to you, giving you advice and making you beautiful. Good stylists are hard to find.  Going back to tip her will be a great compliment and no age doesn't have anything to do with it. I would give at least 20% remember she has your hair in her hands. lol|`|UCj6TyVNaa	most of my clients tip 20%.  And believe me we notice who the good tippers are!  so if you are that happy with your hair give her what you think she deserves.  I always tip 25% when im very happy with someones customer service, sometimes more.  When im not that pleased i usually tip 10-15%.|`|qFkWbpaiaa	i always see it as if they dont do a good job then no tip if they do round up eg 66 cut = 70 all together, they are getting paid alot to do their job well and ofcourse if they are exceptional tip but if you got anything less then they are not doing their job

yhEDUN6qaa	It's really quick and the pain doesn't last. When you go to get it done wear something kind of lose that won't rub against your new piercing. It will take 3-4 months to fully heal. You need to wash it everyday with a antibacterial soap and get all/any crusting off. Dry it completely or else it will get smelly/infected. And for any piercing follow the LITHA rule: Leave It The Hell Alone :) Good luck!|`|ZRhWkSIiaa	I thought it would be bad but it wasn't..it was over really fast.  They usually give you a piece of paper that tells u how to care for it.  Like certain soaps..like Neutrogena.  Just keep it clean and you'll be fine.  You'll be happy you did when you see how cute it looks!|`|GIs1jMhHaa	You'll be fine, it all depends on your level of pain tolerance. It didn't bother me at all, and I was real nervous. It can be really hard to keep clean, they'll go over it with you.|`|a503b666151ed0372de7a61b9a0a5dd4aa	got my belly button pierced in september of 08, what you will want to do is put sea salt in a cup of warm water and hold it over your belly button and swish it 2 or 3 times a day and you will probably get something called h2ocean which is purified salt water and you can spray that on there several times a day. You have to wait 6 months to change it out but it can take 6 months to a year to heal completely. It will probably be very tender for the first week. I have to admit that the pinch hurt pretty bad and then it was stinging for a while. Definitely my most painful piercing but not unbearable

But for you, and I am thinking you have never colored before, why don't you go for some high-lights? This would camouflage the grays that are coming in and you get to experience some blond too. You could even add some low-lights ever so subtly around your face, just a few.|`|1Z5f82lqaa	according to Alester Crowley "do what thou wilt will be the whole of the law, love under will." ... does that help, btw the answer where Hot Donna on the 70's show was red headed and then dyed her hair blond was the best answer.|`|Zk9zH5Feaa	Sure!!

It's appropriate for kids and teens but I think once you hit your twenties it's time to leave the leggings behind.|`|gdGDvWTDaa	no.. it just shows a little bit too much i think.|`|ZP1pLgpxaa	Oh jeez. That IS trashy.    Sorry to break it to you.     It looks cheap as hell and you ALWAYS get visible panty lines, unless you like thongs, in which case it just adds to the trashy-ness of the outfit, if you can even call it an outfit.    Edit: Thick black leggings? Even the thickest I've seen are too thin to wear as pants.    This isn't a NEW style either. In fact, it's just another 80's trend that was revived, but it was revived in a more classy way, to be used UNDER other clothes. But of course, some people don't understand that it's not a clothing item to wear alone.    Edit 2: Leggings have no structure, no pockets, no support, they are essentially underwear.     Wearing a bikini has no comparison to wearing leggings out at the mall, or out anywhere else. It doesn't make it proper attire because it's less revealing than a bikini. Bathing suits are appropriate for the beach, summer days when you'll be near a body of water or a pool.|`|Fw0Zwds7aa	Its cute like this:  http://blah.burrp.com/wp-content/uploads...    But if the top dosn't go past your minge then it looks a bit 80's!
8Y4LUH3zaa	Ok everyone is saying it hurts. I did not think it hurt at all. It all depends on the person. If its done right it shouldnt really swell at all. I got mine done over the summer, and about 20 mins later i was at rib fest eating ribs. My tongue didnt swell at all. It just depends on you, and your tolerance to pain. Dont let the other people on here scare you.|`|JZrgnhr9aa	Yes.|`|aXB3DjtZaa	Yes it does but what stinks about it is its really hard to eat at first. You have no clue how much u use your tongue till it's in pain. But if u like person then get it done the pain will go away.|`|yhEDUN6qaa	Yes. But the pain of actually getting it pierced isn't so bad. I have two piercings in mine. I got them done at the same time and it still didn't hurt all that bad. What does hurt though is when it's healing. When you wake in the morning it's kind of swollen and uncomfortable. That goes away after like a week. Using diluted mouthwash or the spray that the piercer gives you usually makes it go away.|`|bMr7g2pUaa	Hell Ya|`|DuAjK9uHaa	The actual piercing did not hurt me that bad especially because my adrenalin was pumping but afterward my tongue swelled and hurt for about 3 days.  I couldn't really eat or talk but as soon as the swelling went down I was completely fine.|`|uQfk8p7Laa	all piercings hurt it just depends on your body plus your pain tolerance as well. some get after pain and some don't, some swell and some don't it just depends really!      Comfortable: 3 days to 2 weeks    Healing Time: 6 months    Rinse frequently with warm salty water.    Ask for your piercer's mobile phone number.    Avoid putting anything dirty in your mouth and refrain from kissing and oral sex during the healing phase.    Cold foods are best at first (e.g. ice-cream, milk shakes).    Do not play with the jewelry against your teeth or press it into your gums.    Never leave your jewelry out for more than a few hours during the first 6 months - the piercing may close.    Take vitamin C and zinc to maximise your healing.    To minimise swelling in the first few days, suck on ice-cubes and antibacterial/anti-inflammatory throat lozenges, and try not to talk too much  Warning  Never leave your piercing without jewelry for more than a few hours during the first 6 months! Even after this time a fully healed piercing may shrink, making it difficult to re-insert the jewelry.|`|sgr01OCkaa	the most painful part for me was when they pull the needle out and put the 'earring' in. The needle going through itself is a strange sensation, almost like a hot poker but it is over before you know it. It might bleed also, which is gross. Once its all done it doesn't hurt so much unless you accidentally knock or bite the bar and when you eat. Be prepared to eat slowly and carefully for at least a week and your tongue will swell up a bit.|`|TdGbIDH8aa	Well it's a little sore the day afterwards but when you get it done it's just a little bit of a sting  Just clean it with listerine mouthwash and You will be cool  just eat soup and potatoes XD|`|8E2EU1Cqaa	don't do it because my mum is a nurse and she always gets people in a and e with people that have had thier tongue done and goes wrong and had to have a triangle cut out of thier tongue because they cant do anything about it and then they hav a fork tongue for the rest of thier life heres a pic if you don't no what a fork toungne is     http://www.ishiboo.com/~nirva/Mods/tongu...|`|SHCFMLFbaa	The actual piercing does not hurt. Just a little pinch. But the after-effect...hurts like hell. Your tounge swells for 2 days. I could barley eat, talk or do anything. I ended up taking mine out about 2 months afterward because it  never healed correctly. Not worth it.|`|F5R3TJEQaa	does it hurt to get your tongue pierced? Like Hell|`|xnBnbYBgaa	it feels like a bee sting without the burn. it doesnt last long either.
mzNLfY4Caa	Woah. It is soo hard finding one online.     This is my suggestion:  http://www.gojane.com/19149-a-line-halte...   Look at the white one. Try looking for something to cover your shoulders.     Where I live there are many hispanic stores that sell dresses, and that is where everyone gets their confirmation and first communion dresses.     If you're small enough, go to any department store and try to fit in the largest "girl" sizes. They usually have dresses that cover up very nicely.     Good Luck!

It's very earthy and the tones compliment each other well. Or if you want a little more edgy, pink and brown always look better than you'd think. Just try to avoid too much black/brown. Pair the dark pants with a bright top.|`|am4v7hcGaa	Brown is a neutral colour, so any non-neutral (black, olive green, beige, grey, etc.) colour will go with brown.  I like turquoise, teal, emerald green, or bright pinks with brown.    Please, just don't pair brown up with beige.  You end up looking like caca!

O71xlcG3aa	i heard pure cocoa butter helps, try a scar lightner or vaseline twice a day and extra thick at night!|`|C8zrNMRjaa	i hear that that cocoa shay butter stuff works well.|`|ASSqyNDYaa	well you can't get rid of stretch marks cuz they're basically scars. stretch marks happen when your skin breaks underneath the layers of skin. if you scratch them alot it makes it worse because you're basically causing the skin to tear underneath. try moisturizer like vaseline to keep them from tearing and possibly getting bigger. as for getting rid of them, i have no answer.|`|oP2gnhBLaa	i have them too...sorryyy|`|DAbx7mq9aa	go to cvs pharmacy or Walgreen's and get stretchmarks creams.
QUDnGS8Raa	If your going to exfoliate you need to moisturize also. Think of it this way when you exfoliate your skin your basically sanding down the surface area and leaving your skin exposed. Your body in order to recover from this is producing oils on your skin to protect it. Try an oil free moisturizer after you exfoliate but only do it once a week, let your skin heal. I personally have a exfoliate pad that i switch off with St. Ives facial scrub (That uses oatmeal) but only once a week! When it seems that im getting little break outs and dryer skin i use a facial mask that dries in 5-10 min and you wash it off. If that's still not enough or im in a different climate that's drying out my skin ill use an oil free moisturizer. Also always rinse with medium to cold water to close your pores after wards. Hope this helps!|`|1O1ZyEhpaa	You can exfoliate twice a week thats what i do. Exfoliating doesnt rid you of breakouts it just smooths the skins texture and evens it out. Are you using a moisturizer after you exfoliate? How often do you cleanse your skin, you should cleanse twice a day once when you wake up and before you go to sleep
ALh5R37jaa	Yeah i know a lot of girls, including me that love that look on guys.  Make sure they aren't TOO tight though.  And also the "skater boy" look is pretty hot.

xmfPoJIeaa	hey. well i wouldnt of recommended doing this in the first place. but as long as you are aware of everything that can go wrong, then its at your own risk. i would just make sure that you started off with jewelry that wont give you an infection (surgical steel is ideal) and you continue to clean it regularly then you should be ok. if you are concerned about any infections go see your piercer and ask them to take a look at it, and if needed buy some proper jewelry to put in there so that they heal up nicely. but other than that, lobe piercings are easy to take care of. keep cleaning them twice a day for the next 2 weeks and you should be good.|`|ozwLZwXeaa	What a brave girl you are to do your own ears.  It sounds like you are doing all the right things to keep infection away and keep up a good routine of cleaning and turning.          Let your Mother know what you did.  She probably will be upset with you for awhile. As long as you keep your new piercing clean and it doesn't get infected I think your Mom will see how pretty you look.  You should never do things like that without Mom's permission tho because Mom's are just like that about protecting our children.        It sounds like you are taking all precautions that are necessary to keep it clean so just go let your Mother know what you did and how sweet it looks now.  She will freak out a minute but she loves you and it will be ok.|`|bAYVSfdJaa	A lighter & peroxide may clean, but they can't sterilize - only an autoclave on that.  Also, no you're not supposed to turn earrings and NEVER clean them with peroxide.      No, you did not do it properly - you didn't sterilize the needle, you used the wrong type of needle, you didn't sterilize the earring, and you did it in a less than an ideal environment.      Care tips? Do sea salt soaks to clean them (1/4 tsp of sea salt to a cup of warm water, and soak your piercings for several minutes twice a day).  Expect white or clear puss - if it starts turning yellow or green, go to a doctor asap (but do not remove the jewelry - removing an infected piercing just traps the infection).     I have no tips for you showing your mom.  Just promise to pay for the doctors visit if/when they get infected from you going against your moms wishes.|`|tJspe0xoaa	I'm sure you know this already but if the ache doesn't go away rather quickly like say another hour or so or if it starts to get green and pus like obviously remove them. As far as your mom goes, say your sorry about 20 times, and make sure you use the line " I don't know what came over me." LOL Good Luck|`|P53btYb6aa	Don't use peroxide and alcohol to clean them, it will dry them out pretty bad.I would get some Claires solution,or use sea salt soaks on them.  You can get sea salt from a grocery store and mix it yourself.  And, I hope you have real earrings in, not ones with nickel.|`|ZcQ5Fcetaa	sorry to say but it is a bit of a silly thing to do..

5Um59Muhaa	1) Brush your hair a lot  2) If you can, wear it in a ponytail a lot  3) Massage your head everyday for 3-10 minutes  4) If you  can, use Beautiful lengths shampoo and conditioner  5) Avoid blow drying, curling, or straightening your hair a lot    5) If it's available, eat 1 teaspoon of brewer's yeast, or nutrition yeast, available at the organic section of Fred Meyers. It doesn't taste very good, though, so mixing it with things like juice will help.

4vqzkIr4aa	When I read this couldn't help but to laugh...    First, vasolene is NOT bad to put on new work and is a must when doing a piece. It is if you use too much it can clock your pores. But if it is the only thing you have at the moment there is nothing wrong with using it as long as it is used VERY sparingly. There are much better alternatives than vasolene. I always suggest A&D.    Secondly, if you insist on doing this at home and attempting to teach yourself you need to start with how to tune a machine. If you bought one of these cheap tattoo kits from ebay they are cheap for a reason. They suck and are cheap Japanese knock-offs and should not be used to actually tattoo unless they are completely reworked and tuned. Not only are the machines crap the ink is even worse that comes with them. You need to know the proper armature to coil spacing for your stroke length (basic rule of thumb - nickel space for color packing - dime space for line work). Then of course you have to know what voltage is needed for that machine to make the needle grouping being used able to penetrate to the proper depth and to do so repeatedly.    I will not clock this area with info but if you want some advise to keep from scarring yourself and damaging someone else drop me a line.    Edit:  Never ever use neosporin or anything with aloe on a new piece. Do some people use these with good results, yes, just like some people shoot themselves in the head and live. If you were to use these it may come out ok but most likely will not come out as good as possible. Both of these help to speed up healing and you do not want to speed the healing process of a new tattoo. A tattoo is not to be treated like a typical cut. The healing process is completely different and after care should be kept separated from any normal cut healing procedures you know.|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	wow...self pwn    vasaline should NEVER go on a tattoo unless it is right after it is done to keep the bandage from sticking and it should be washed off within two hours. dont get me wrong here i know it goes on WHILE the tattoo is getting done as well, but after its washed off when you take the bandages off, that should be the last you ever put it on       and tattoos are supposed to peal.  if yours peel and theres no color underneath, then the ink wasnt put in deep enough.    you shouldnt be tattooing yourself in the first place.  theres a reason there are professionals.  and if you want to learn to tattoo, go to a shop and ask what it would take to be an apprentice|`|dcNmRPGPaa	aloe vera always works for me...|`|01yBLHvWaa	well you shouldn't be tattooing yourself unprofessionally number one.  number two ALL TATTOOS will peel in the healing process, there is no stopping it.  number three vaseline is BAD for tattoos, you need A&D ointment.|`|LPEWAoWCaa	Put neosporin on them and don't pick at them either|`|ASSqyNDYaa	VASELINE SHOULD NEVER BE USED ON TATTOOS!!!!!

(tattoo goo works great and it helps it from fading).  if your tats peal, then you arent making them deep enough.( you need to get the ink past the first 3 layers of skin)    hope this helps!

Then get some hair mousse and run your fingers through your hair to give it more volume. Just remember to hair spray it to keep it in place.   If that's too compliacted, just try loosely curling it and then apply mousse and spray.  Hope this helps .x.
i4b0xzSWaa	NAW ITS JUST A SCAM, I TRIED FOR ABOUT 2 MONTHS AND IT DIDNT REALLY MAKE A BIG CHANGE ON MY HAIR. BUT THEN I STARTED TO TAKE BIOTIN VITAMINS AND THEY WORK!!!!!!!! YOU CAN GO TO A REGULAR DRUG STORE IT BUY IT FOR ABOUT 5$.ITS ALOT BETTER THAN BUYING 40$VITAMINS|`|XG4TAjcCaa	Well, i haven't taken those kinds of vitamins. But they contain bitoin, and i took biotin for about a month and a half and it didn't do anything.    However, I stopped taking them because they were synthetic. Be carefull you don't get synthetic vitamins, read the label before you buy them, because those don't usually work and can sometimes be harmfull.|`|jez0O0bXaa	No guarantee how much but Biotin is great for hair nails & skin.|`|hiH6j2lZaa	Healthy Hair Vitamins do work, although they are different on how much it is going to grow on everyone. I am a licensed cosmetologist, I have a lot of clients that take them and the hair is very healthy and it grows.|`|z8p0jtoBaa	It depends, your hair usually grows about 1/4inch/month. These vitamins could help, but why waste money on them when you can just eat healthy, and take care of your hair!
NFAfG3YWaa	DONT SHAVE...not a good idea...then you continuously have to do it every couple of days because the hair comes back dark..  honestly...longest lasting without laser is waxing..it hurts but its worth it|`|gjs1GXdTaa	Try that new pad thing, it is like sandpaper.See them on tv for $19.95|`|gLXzVbm8aa	just bleach it sally has those bleaching products and there is extra strenght tooo|`|AA12032352	Why wouldn't you wax? That is honestly the best option if you have dark hair on your face.    Are you sure it is noticeable, everyone has hair on their face, most people's is very fine and light colored so you don't notice it. If you do have dark or thick hair you need to either wax, pluck, or bleach it.    NEVER SHAVE....that will cause it to come back darker and thicker.|`|oXXFo2ATaa	almost, EVERYONE has hair on there face.   are you a girl?|`|ZcQ5Fcetaa	o-m-god! i understand.. it has happened to me too and i have Black hair! r u a sikh by any chance because it would be so offensive to wax if ur not meant to.. i would just use moisturiser it works for me somehow... if only girls could be as free as boys... but afterall i dont wanna disown my religion....|`|21zVSMTJaa	used a good scrubber,,and don't bleach take a natural bleach mix hot milk with lemon juice and apply on the face every night it not only lighten the colour of your hair it also give your face glow and make it wrinkle free...and wash ur face with gram floor..

XuxZPdNdaa	I would just go to a wig store and try on all sorts of different color wigs for free... just act like you plan to buy and don't buy anything... haha...     Dark colors are generally harder to remove, so don't dye unless you know you want it.      I've personally use Revlon, Fructise, etc... over the counter stuff you can get at Target or CVS and stuff, works just fine, no damages to my hair... of course, varies depending on type of hair you have.|`|HwrmAgzuaa	colour pulse!    http://images.google.ca/images?sourceid=...    It gives you a gorgeous colour that only lasts for anywhere between 4-10 washes|`|GGqh73iWaa	Use colour mousse, they come in all sorts of colours and only last about 5 washes. I use them sometimes if ive got a night out and just fancy a change. Wella do them or Alberto V05.|`|jez0O0bXaa	Go to Sally's best and cheapest, they can answer your questions.  You shouldn't have damage but going dark can stay longer in your hair more like permanent.
lIpjuMTHaa	Not at all, in fact they are back in. Christian Loboutin just came out with some fierce ones, and trust me, if hes doing it... its in.

k0ROELduaa	I used to have the same problem and found that there is no reason to use expensive products. I always wash my face in the morning and at night, but I also make sure to use Clearasil Blackhead Scrub before I go to bed. There is even a cheaper off-brand product like this.    I would also invest in a bottle of facial moisturizer to prevent wrinkles and to keep your skin smooth. Equate Beauty Lotion (off-brand product) works awesome. It doesn't leave my skin oily or too dry.|`|YwHl37Hgaa	Yes it works even clay masks used regularly helps pull out trapped oil and dead skin.Check out  http://useinfo-blackhead.blogspot.com/ for more useful tips to control blackheads.|`|S730dpLfaa	Rachel, if you're serious,read this blog before taking any action  http://ihateblackheads.wordpress.com  Thanks to this blog, it helped me a lot to find the best teeth whitening method.  Hope this helps|`|ZcJgYpE6aa	No,it doesn't work.  Regular facials is the best thing.  If you want to do it cheaply yourself, steam your face first (or do it while having a bath),and squeeze................  Then apply an astringent tonic,or a facial mask for oily skin.  Good luck.
rChJHiSMaa	OK, so. I know my fashion. Get some long footless leggins and some nice big chunky high heels. Get a black huge leather bag, them black circle ear-rings from clairs and and huge chunky black beed necklace.  Have a grest party!     P.S- don't listen to ani1 who ses u cnt wear it as a dress. You can as long as it is with leggins|`|MwvA8v17aa	bold beaded necklace & bangles    answer mine? *please click on me and go to my most recent question because posting link doesnt work* thanks!|`|kPmzj4Rcaa	I'd suggest shiny leggins, with black heels, lots of bangles, cute clutch, and necklaces |`|ZUcQAqRUaa	Wear some cute leggings or tights, some heels and a couple of chunky necklaces :]|`|QBNRbODBaa	Hm...it looks like a sweatshirt, not a dress. I'm thinkin you should wear something different.|`|505kdpepaa	I personally would wear it with:-    http://www.topshop.com/webapp/wcs/stores...    http://www.topshop.com/webapp/wcs/stores...    http://www.missselfridge.com/webapp/wcs/...    http://www.office.co.uk/womens/office/wi...    Grey is gorgeous with bright pink, and purple too. If you want to tone it down, try black. Accessorize with gold though, silver is too stark with grey.    EDIT If you've got it in black, then surely it doesn't matter what colour you put with it?|`|bwEwtlFlaa	Wear skinny jeans, knee boots, and a square scarf tied cowboy style with the tassels hanging from them to add a fun little detail. Or if you want to wear this as a dress throw on a longer scarf tie it loosely about halfway down, and let it drape this will allow you to add color to your outfit. Pair this with a over sized bag and you choice of earrings depending on your hairstyle.....Personally i think you can put any type of color with the black but with grey try a red, yellow, or  green some thing that will make the outfit pop!
kIblsxJQaa	Boots or Tesco or Superdrug or Savers

BvjPU3wkaa	1. Rimmel. Lasting Finish foundation is one of the best you can find in drugstores, it's incredibly long lasting and super inexpensive.       2. Concealers are tricky because it really does depend on what you are looking for your concealer to accomplish.  If you are looking to cover blemishes, I would suggest either L'Oreal Infallible concealer or Rimmel's Hide the Blemish.  If you are looking to cover dark circles you should opt for something with light reflective particles.  Rimmel's Recover is a great one.    3. I would go with L'Oreal H.I.P or NYX.  Both are super pigmented and will last on your face throughout the entire day.    4. The Lasting Finish foundation also has a matching primer that you can purchase as well.  It's more of a cream base rather than the typical silicon based primers on the market.  Again it's cheap and does an incredible job evening everything out.|`|2U27BgmKaa	1. If you want your foundation to last, then you need to use a primer. Rimmel and Sally Hansen have one, but I prefer Stila. Rimmel will definitely do the trick if you're looking to pinch a few pennies. A really good liquid foundation on a smaller budget is Almay or Olay. If you're looking to spend a bit more (it will stay on longer, and you'll spend less in the long run, but more at one time) Stila Illuminating foundation, or Urban Decay. Keep using a powder over top! Prime, color, and set. You need to do those three steps if you want to keep your makeup on all day. It really doesn't take as long as people think. :)  2. The best conclealer is Urban Decay 24/7. The whole 24/7 line (concealer, eyeliner, and lip liner) is amazing for long wear. You let it set for two minutes, and you can rub as hard as you like spray water, wipe with a tissue, and it will not come off! I would suggest spending a bit more since you really want something to stay on.  3. Same with your foundation, you need to use an eyeshadow Primer. Urban Decay Primer Potion is amazing it's $16 for one or $26 for two and one bottle will last you 8 months (just remove the plastic top when you're running low and you'll have another two month's worth! You can also use the Primer Potion in the new color of Sin so that you don't have to buy a different shadow as a highlighter. A really good black eyeshadow that will stay on is either MaxFactor or Urban Decay Zero.  4. Well, I already covered that in the first answer! ;)    All these lines are available in the UK and should be about the same price as they are here when you factor in the exchange rate (for a quick look, take the prices I gave and add about 7 dollars on to see what it will cost in pounds). Good luck!|`|FeMJDEcIaa	well   1. L'Oreal Cashmere Perfect    i dont really use 2-3 BUT  check out your local beauty supply place,   most of them are having sales right now|`|efjzNh6Yaa	Not really sure what I would recommend to you. There are so many products out there so what I end up doing is starting with the less expensive and trying out a few different ones.The review site is pretty good at http://www.brandsmakeup.com visit and see what everyone recommends.|`|wL7v53Unaa	1.Estee lauder double wear is a good foundation.It stays the same as it looked when you put it on until you take it off.Its matte and a medium to high coverage foundation so if you want something lighter i wouldn't recommend it.It costs around 22 for a small bottle but it lasts for ages and costs less than buying cheaper foundations more often so in the long run it saves you money.  2.Double wear concealer is good too but i find that when i use this foundation i don't need to use any.  3.Can't help with that one  4.I use rimmel recover perfect skin primer and it works really well.It comes in three formula's brightening,healthy glow and anti-redness.I ve used the brightening and the healthy glow one.The brightening makes your skin look really healthy and is good under the eye are especially if you're tired and the healthy glow one does practically the same the only difference is it make you look a bit tanned if you're wearing it on its own and not with foundation-which you can do with them and they cost around 5 for a tube.
hiH6j2lZaa	I am a licensed cosmetologist. I would suggest the Garnier Fructis. I use and love it and my hair id very healthy. Or you can try Tressme, it works will!|`|IodpgIk7aa	i think pantene makes a shampoo and conditioner for relaxed hair. it's in a brown bottle|`|1O1ZyEhpaa	I think conditioner is a main component to healthy hair especially relaxed hair. There is no specific brand that will guarantee your hair healthy and length. I use dominican brands like Salerm 21, Miss Keys, Aphogee etc. To make is thicker you use a conditioner that has biotin in it but as far as growth that relies on you. I recommend deep conditioning your hair at least once a week|`|2LTumLwNaa	Pantene!|`|L2pkns9maa	Umm... i have relaxed hair too, i would say garnier.|`|FrWhdRL1aa	Pantene!|`|9cc44c00f731b9967a15e31fc2e1c0cdaa	Suave.  Sleek.  and cut 1.5 inches every 3 months.|`|gJ94xxqkaa	PANTENE
yWRTrnR2aa	Is your hair dark, medium, or light brown?    If it's medium or light brown you can use a semi- or demi-permanent dye.  Semi- permanent and demi-permanent dyes, wont damage your hair and will fade out slowly (so you won't have to worry about roots growing out a different color).    But if your hair is dark brown then you will have to lighten it, and that is very damaging.|`|jnG8sOzWaa	maybe not the first time but if you keep redoing it, then eventually, yes it will damage it|`|gjs1GXdTaa	You will get some damage but nothing that cannot be controlled. Use a good conditioner,limit your thermal appliances and only do it as needed. Which,you will need to do about every 6 weeks depending on how fast your hair grows.|`|zDf186Xyaa	buy your mum some box of chocaltes, im sure you will get past her, or do the dishes. I think your hair roots will get very weak if you dye your hair.|`|zxaqL885aa	yes it damages your hair. and yes you will have to keep redying it if you don't want roots.|`|dt5oSNQ5aa	I think it damages your hair if you don't dye it regularly, just like a relaxer.  If you take care of your hair, I don't think it will damage it. It may also depend on what kind of dye you use.  I don't know how you will get away with colored hair from your mom unless if she's color blind. Good Luck with that : )|`|O7LYxbKlaa	It might damage it slightly but with a conditioning treatment it will be as good as new.  You will have to do root touch ups but nothing major.  I would get it done professionally but im sure you could do it at home if you really wanted to.  Good Luck!!  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~...|`|QnSKaBcjaa	it will damage it if you lighten it at all because you need bleach to acheive that. Will your mom let you do a temporary color?|`|QTxdNavKaa	Just leave your hair alone - dying it isn't natural and it's promoting shallow fakism.|`|kNFH5lKnaa	Yeah Dyeing your hair, is that you using Chemicals to kill your hair.  if you bleach it, you will notice your hair will feel much more different than soft or silky.  But if you want to keep it soft when you already have hair colored, you only need conditioner.|`|e240JvCraa	if u dont bleach it b4 u die it!  it wont!|`|YuZ8QHMLaa	If you dye your hair with real henna then it will not damage your hair.    You can get real henna suitable for hair dyeing from lush, or lush.co.uk|`|OCgZACJqaa	I have been dyeing my hair for years now, and apart from the colour, sometimes not being the same on the box, I have had no problems., in fact my hair is in a better condition after dyeing it.    The main things you have to do is the following.    Use a semi-permanent dye.  This will wash out gradually over a few weeks.  But if you use a permanent dye you can be stuck with it until it grows out.     Always do a patch test before you use it on your hair.    There are wash in / wash out colourants so you can have a different colour for the week-end then wash it out for school.    I would start off with the wash in/wash out colourant as a beginning to see if you like it, then you won't give your mum a heart attack.|`|p3GZERIsaa	Yep.|`|hiH6j2lZaa	I am a licensed cosmetologist, Excessive coloring your hair will damage it and yes, if you color it once, it will need to be touched up every month as the roots grow in.|`|wCIHZ8MRaa	i'm 16, have brown hair and dyed mine the same color ur describing and I've never had a problem and my hair's texture never changed or anything. all I know about the dye my hairdresser uses is it's "semi permanent" And I get it re-done about every 4 months. Hope I helped |`|XvaaaadYaa	All hair colouring has the potential to damage hair, i would recommend getting something thats free of amonia or other harsh chemicals.  hope this helped|`|PCiFAnbKaa	Im almost 14 ive been dying my hair since the 5th grade.Yes you do have to keep re-dying it.But yeah it kinda does damage your hair but if you use the right products you can make it better.=]|`|i7uGl7DDaa	yes it will damage, but thats only if you use it alot  your supose to dye your hair like 3 times a year i think it is,  and you will probally need 2 bottles of hair dye and your hair is long and thick :)  good luck:D|`|ElpxHG33aa	it really depends on the type of dye you use. theres lots of potential for dyes to damage your hair, but it depends on your specific hair, and the composition of the dye.  funny, you can use koolaid to dye your hair temporarily if you really want, and thats harmless.|`|c3svN3Evaa	if too often, yes it does|`|RZ4l6s65aa	yes it will dry it out  you will only have to re-dye it if you want to keep the colour and then if you do you can have touch ups at the roots|`|6eOIigalaa	Yeah its good for it but it wont fall out and go makey all of a sudden  I'v ben trying different colours for about 5years now   as long as you use good quality dye and  colour safe shampoo it wont be as bad  but its not good for your hair no      you could get the henna dye from Lush  Thats the best one to do cause its not nearly as bad  Ask in the store for what colours there are and how long its lasts ect|`|yjcAH16paa	Yes dying your hair will damage it. And yes you will have to keep dying it. expecially with thick hair, the color wont turn out right and you most likly wont like it. I suggest listening to your mom.|`|aYIDzvhyaa	Yeah it will probably damage your hair,  Not alot though because youre not drastically changing it.  But it will a little bit.  You'll have to keep dying the roots about every 4-5 weeks.  And use special shampoo and conditioner so it wont fade and look ugly.    Oh and also since its your first time, you should go to a salon.  It's much safer.    Hope it turns out great :D|`|gM4exZNEaa	Yes, it does damage your hair a bit, but it takes a lot of dye to really muck up your hair. If you just want to dye it every so often, its not a biggie! But if youre dying it weekly or monthly then theres a problem.    Also, your mum may not want you to because of the financial implications. You dye your hair, but when it grows back its the same colour as it used to be as you probably know, so you get roots going. Which arent pretty. So people often end up getting their hair re-dyed to cover the roots. So it gets pretty expensive after a while.|`|mAt9he0Zaa	not at first bu if you do it alot it makes your hair go like straw.|`|3jD57QwNaa	yeah dying your hair can damage it. and remember that if you die it and don't like it it  will be very difficult if not impossible to get back to your natural hair color.      I dk how your mom is, but w/ my parents getting around one never went over well.  just advice i'm not trying to offend anyone.|`|jez0O0bXaa	Not if done right, not by a friend but someone who knows what they are doing. Highlighting or bleaching will damage it but using the right after care products is important. Just changing couple of levels or a same level color should be fine. You may have to keep retouching your new growth unless it fades close to your natural color.  You should work with your mom to make it a bonding thing with her, need her to guide you in making good grown up decisions as in the proper way to get your hair done.  You should have a choice in your hair and what you've chosen is totally reasonable.  I always let my daughter do this now she's a cosmetologist like me. Good luck!|`|7VY5LcX8aa	The simple answer to this is yes. It will damage it and you must make sure you use a dye that will not react badly by giving you a reaction or something.  Your best bet is to see a hairdresser and ask them to check the condition of your hair and see what they recommend. If you dye it yourself, make sure you choose the correct colour, mine's gone wrong before :) hehe.  Once you've died it, use colour protection shampoo and conditioner aswell to keep it there, this should also keep your hair in the best possible condition.   Hope this helps .x.|`|zGFmdCATaa	Yes as there is potential that it will react badly with your root canals
3JkZPMvYaa	you could slice up either a potato or cucumber put them in the fridge to  get all cold then put them over your eyes for 15 mins it really works|`|cSHi57VKaa	put metal spoons in the freezer *or fridge eithr way* 4 about lik oh mayb 5 minutes? *relly depends on comfort level* and then put them ovr ur eyes. u can also try some kinda of cream 2 reduce puffiness and also, try 2 get sum sleep!|`|2LAKDPc7aa	h|`|O0ZAi9RRaa	Please don't laugh or thumbs-down me but..... use hemmoroid cream.

Congrats on the new baby!|`|2U27BgmKaa	Not even joking. Potatoes! Put on in the fridge, and make a slice that will fit over you eye (like you do for a cucumber). Then take the chilled potato slice and leave it over your eye for 5 minutes. For a once a week treatment, leave them on for 10-15 minutes. Do a test. Put a chilled slice over one eye, and leave the other one alone. Then look in the mirror and you will see the difference! It's so cheap and easy and it's a great fix. I use it when I haven't gotten enough sleep due to homework or alcohol. If it doesn't work as well as you wanted, try Studio Gear's Affirmation Eye Gel. Works wonders even if it's not as cheap as a potato. I believe it's about $28. Good luck!|`|9Rmd1IVVaa	There are many creams meant to put under your eyes to help that...  other then that, you can try sleeping with your head propped up on some pillows,  when you sleep like that it helps you get rid of bags.  I'd look for a good anti-aging face moisterizer because it should  smooth any lines under your eyes.  Avoid any tugging, pulling, or massaging or the bags under your eyes,  and when you wash your face,  be careful with the towel around that area,  because if your pulling at it,  then skin will become looser and more wrinkle prone.      Tips: Look for face creams with green tea or cucumber extracts, it will help awaken the skin that is "bagging"...|`|9b6a8961ce7af38976562cea05a7c157aa	I have bad eye bags as well.   Go to a dermatologist. They will definitely help.
jez0O0bXaa	Try Nioxxin products they have a great system and will help also use volumizing styling products.|`|Z2f5Ka6jaa	I know how you feel! I'm 26 and feel like my hair has been getting thin too (my husband says I'm nuts). Do you take a really good multivitamin? I'm not talking about Centrim or whatever. Go to your local healthfood store and ask them to recommend a really good multivitamin.  Vitol One Per Day is an excellent multivitamin - but it's a really big pill.  You can find it at www.usorganic.com.  Look into taking Biotin and Gelain, that helps with hair strength/skin/etc.    You might just have thin hair! There are really good products to help with volumizing up your hair.  My hair has nice texture, but it's not super thick, but with the right product it looks thick! I loooove Big Sexy Hair Root Pump (not root pump plus!). Sometimes you have to just deal with the cards you were dealt. Maybe getting your haircut in a shorter style, like Rhianna's bob style, will help your hair look thicker too.  Good luck ;)

8ZmjIYORaa	I hope this is a best answer, as i've spent quite a long time on this..    Basically,    1) Get some eye shadow first, get some purple, and gold, and mix them both together, and some gold on the top but smudge it. (There is a brush for eye shadow, use your fingers they're easier).       2) Get some light eyeliner (dry, not liquid) and just add some on the top of your eye, and smudge it, by using a smudger.    3) Wear some blush first. A pretty pale brush, and powdered. Then add some good (not very pale), foundation onto it, to soothe your face.    4) Find some really good quality lip-gloss, like sparkly REALLY light Pink, or just some clear, and make sure it sparkles.    Hope I helped :)    If you want the hair, guestbook me :)|`|WfBgOWctaa	put on some powder foundation  mascara  blend 2 or 3 colors of eye shadow  sparkly lip gloss  and very light on blush|`|XIEO3RIAaa	Have a clean face    I would then put on a natural looking foundation and start doing the eyes.    So some mascara very lightly applied. Then put the eye shadow(looks like a darkish blue/grey) on the eyelids and taking a shimmer type/silvery eye shadow apply it around the edges and under the eyebrow as well as around the tear duct to open them up.   Then apply a slightly pink lip gloss and I dont think there is any blusher.|`|kv42U6yraa	You want a somewhat deep smokey purple eyeshadow and smooth it on over your eyelids and browbones (she goes pretty close to her eyebrows). Then use lots of black mascara!    Try a find a sheer reddish-pink lipgloss, which is what she looks like  she is wearing. That is all there is to it!|`|6mBrJ2EGaa	1. first lets do the eyes, get some purple and gold and kinda mix themtogether and smudge some gold on the top.      2. Get some light eyeliner, and put it on your eye lids apply it with a smudger    3. for blush a nice pale blush, and powdered. Then add some good (not very pale) foundation onto it to smooth on your face.    4. Find some good quality lipgloss, like sparkly REALLY light Pink, or just some clear and make sure it sparkles, I live covergirl because it doesnt irritate my lips! good luck girlie!|`|GJbziTG2aa	lol no idea  BUT I SAW THIS LAST NIGHT!
3PWjDpFsaa	I don't live in South Jersey but if your boyfriend has back problems, look for a Registered Massage Therapist who has done it for at least a year.  They are usually found in chiropractors offices.  Make sure they are registered massage therapists as they have a lot of education and know about tendons and muscle groups.      I have back and shoulder problems, and I have found relief from deep tissue massage therapy.  The massage therapists first discusses with me what that problem is and then mainly works on that area and after wards I feel wonderful.    There is also aromatherapy massages which are a lighter touch and they use nice smelling oils.  These are not necessarily registered massage therapists but provide a nice massage and this is okay if he doesn't have back problems but just wants a relaxing massage.      There are many spas that provide massages.  I know you will find one in your area.    Good luck,    Michelle,  http://www.mydeeptissuemassage.net
yhEDUN6qaa	You can re-pierce it. When I had to re-pierce mine it hurt a little more than the first time because scar tissue makes the skin a little tougher.|`|okeqhoLPaa	yep you can, it just may not sit as pretty as before,|`|KOzYvMPsaa	Yes, my ring fell out almost 2 years ago and I recently got it re-pierced. It hurts a lot more the second time around as there is a lot of scar tissue left, but it is possible. Your piercer just has to ensure that she pierces behind the scar tissue where the skin is okay. Good luck!|`|yLFijrytaa	yea you could|`|YtSGbYqEaa	yeah you can re pierce it|`|ztug2gLjaa	I had mine pierced twice.  It does hurt alittle bit more cause now your going through scar tissue.  I had mine done for 8 years and I even had it in when I was pregnant.  I took it out but every other day I'd put it in for about an hour or so, so it wouldn't close!|`|ENJ0bY48aa	My first piercing ripped out.  When I had it redone, the piercer was able to do it under the scar tissue.  This made it a lot more stable and made the healing process better.  It actually hurt less than the first time around!|`|tJspe0xoaa	I did the same thing. I had my navel pierced. When I got pregnant I took it out. Once I lost the baby weight I got it re pierced no problem. I then had a 2nd child but I haven't been to get it re pierced again.

a6f6d298cb34928f1e4c04a38c3beb6aaa	Use a clarifying shampoo this will strip any impurities from the hair. Just make sure you use a really good conditioner after because it will take all of the oil out of hair literally.     Medium styles try getting some funky layers or try razor cutting your ends to give it a textured look. You can also roller set it if you are looking for volume or use velcro rollers while your hair is dry to give it body.

bCjmjnqgaa	haha i'm a pro at this stuff.     In like middle school, everyone wore those addidas flipflops with socks and like our school sweats! It was like all the rage. I did it too. Sometimes I did it cause I had swim practice too.     Right now I have a 'lazy outfit' on. I'm wearing Brown Terry Pants by Juicy Couture. You can get similar ones by Victorias Secret though for a bit cheaper. If its extra cold I put footless leggings underneath. With a Henley shirt on from Abercrombie (like the one in the Aeropostale Link you posted) with grey tank underneath its from H&M. Henleys are great for this comfy look cause you usually need to layer with them, so its warm & comfortable.   Normally I wear like a thin hoodie or a cardigan, which i get from H&M or JCrew. Right now I havent got shoes on but I normally would put like uggs or moccasins on. A lot of my friends also have those ugg slipper things. Sometimes I wear flats with this. It isn't terribly cold out right now, so if i go get a cuppa coffee like i most likely will. I'll throw on a thin grey hoodie, a scarf, some gloves and a jacket similar to the one in your first link mine isn't columbia brand its Puma i believe (but i got it at the Addidas store) Columbia does have warm stuff though.   Honestly the key for me is layering. I get cold easily. But i hate to wear thick sweaters and stuff that I feel suffocates me. So I wear thin layers that I can take off easily or wear comfortably.   If I'm just around the house I tend to just throw a sweatshirt on.     I do try to look a little put together and not like I just rolled out of bed. I throw some jewlery on. Or make my hair look decent and makeup. Not over done or anything. Just casual.    All the links you put up are good. You have the right idea. I have similar things on right now and feel like i have the 'lazy look' downpact.|`|RKMxAKDIaa	get one of those cute fealty tracksuit type things and some ugg boots they look so cute with ugg boots!    http://images.asia.ru/img/alibaba/photo/...|`|QBNRbODBaa	--What about warm-ups?

1xGHakvMaa	ADVICE :  dont get them.    i know you probably really want them.  and theyre OK.  BUT.    DOWNSIDE:  - become immune to heat after about 4 weeks  - MAJOR SPLIT ENDS  - hair falls out    UPSIDE:  - they are nice  - hair longer/thicker  - will curl and straighten     advice if you want some extensions is get the clip in human hair.  those are the ones i have and theyre the best because theyre not glued in and wont mess up your real hair and theyre the only ones that you can use heat on. mine cost 75 (around $150). 18inch Human Clip in Hair Extensions. you wash them every 2 months so that they dont dry out and use a good heat protector and hair serum on them.  i got mine from an actual extension shop in my town but i suppose you could buy them over the internet and rent a colour wheel.    hope this helped (: x|`|ku5NPnkfaa	You shouldnt get hair extensions they look dumb.

Don't get synthetic ones..otherwise you can't style them with heat.    Get clip in ones!! They're the best and i only take like 5 mins to put mine it...and ya can take them out whenever!!    wash and condition them...do it ONLY when necessary i'd say...because if you wash them TOO often it will start to thin out and the hair will start to come out of the clips...    =)|`|yVuJkdXCaa	Hey, well i live in the UK and most hair shops sell them and even shops like New Look And International sell them :P, or if its real ones you can get them at Sally's',   If you are going for the fake hair one that you get in new look etc they are about 2.50-5 Or if you are looking for real hair one which are better they tend to range from 20-60 but the 60 are by like Paris Hilton etc. It is better getting the real hair ones because you can straighten them, curl them, style them like you would so to your normal hair :), But fake ones are just as good but it is good to wash them with Luke warm water once in a while, if you are planning to use them a lot real hair is best, but if not the fake ones are cheap and cheerful.  BTW, Clip in ones are better because they don't ruin you hair and they are so quick and easy to put in.

However, you should buy hair that is 100% real and has clips already. The length depends on the price. I have 22" and they cost me $250 for 5 strands (3 two clippers) and (2 thee clippers). If you go with 100% human hair then it will cost you a nice penny. If it is real than you wash it like you wash your own hair, but do not do it with them on your head. If you wear them everyday then you should wash them once a week. You can even dye them if you like. Good luck!|`|EyoIFatRaa	I have some hair extentions.

They are about 20 for a packet but depending on how many sets you need on average about 2/3. You take care of them by buying the special shampoo and conditioner which goes with that type of hair extension. Also you can blow dry, curl and straighten them. http://www.sallyexpress.com/viewCategory...    But that's if you want the clip in hair extensions.     If you want proper hair extensions they you would have to go salon but that would on average cost about 200. Lauren conrad uses the new type of hair extensions which are the tape in ones as they don't damage your hair like the glue in ones.     The clip in extensions however are just as good and also you have the option of wearing your hair short or long.     People at Sally's are really helpful therefore they would give you the colour and how many packets etc that are correct for your hair and hair type.|`|Fen0ldZIaa	i buy from a hair shop in my town but you can buy on the internet if thats not available..    you can get human hair extentions for around 30-40 but that also depends on how much you need/lengh etc..

hVKYVJ89aa	i like to stay natural but i still love my makeup too, you just have to remember to use it minimally and not go overboard, less is more!    i use:  foundation,  concealer, (where its needed)  a little bronzer,  blush,  eyeliner   mascara  lip balm    i sometimes get my eyelashes tinted, so then i skip out mascara, you just dont need it when your lashes r already black, full and thick! i would recommend that definitely. it lasts 4-6 weeks.|`|TdGbIDH8aa	Eyeliner and Eyeshadow|`|Fsq9qvkqaa	This might sound like a lot, but I use everything sparingly for a natural look:    1.

Tyr4ZT6qaa	blow dry your bangs  point the hair dryer straight downwards  and start drying  then switch the side of the part and keep doing it  alternating sides  this will help keep them the way you want them  also make sure not to over- straighten them :)    hope this helps|`|pFS2LZGKaa	I think it looks good and a swept side bang can be annoying you always have it in your face, but i think it looks really cute

mUed9bXYaa	ive got a scar on my right cheek where i was mugged by some crack-head with a switchblade... it really doesnt look nice but thankfully it wasnt a bad cut so its starting to clear up    its not that i live in a bad area its that i didnt have taxi money to get home so i had to walk through a bad neighbourhood... i guess i was a bit stupid under-estimating how much i'd need but at least i'm still alive =)|`|8KWxpsPQaa	to keep well away   a sign that they are always fighting and gettin into trouble    or they been attacked   depends what they look like in person|`|ReIgRaPuaa	it depends. if your gross and unshaven and have a huge gash on your face, i'm most likely going to walk in the opposing direction.    however, if your a nice looking person, then a scar doesn't mean much. i know a guy who's really hot and he has a pretty big scar on his forehead. girls don't seem to mind it much, they fall all over him.     scars don't necessarily mean your a gang member crazy drug addicted psycho freak. who knows how you got the scar? maybe you were saving a baby from a burning building or pulling a woman out of her smashed car or some other heroic type thing.      basically what i'm saying is, you just gotta know who to work it.|`|fBoaYJKzaa	My current partner has some scars on his face from where he got into a fight when he was younger.  Fortunately he's not the fighting type and was just in the wrong place at the wrong time when it happened so I don't need to be worried about him scrapping at the time now.    I'd say yes to scars, as long as they don't come with a load of baggage.|`|IlxKKg46aa	Hmm.  I dont mind if they have a few :) But a face full of them, maybe not ;) my favourite is on my ex had through his eyebrow, it made him look sexy :) or one on his lip, where he got cut :P  I dont take much notice  though.|`|X7DDlR1caa	there's nothing wrong with scars, and even if a man did have them on their face it might just be a accident, people can't help it either way!

atbAakXuaa	No,well cared for hair is not unhealthy or unhygienic.|`|h6NqNzHAaa	Absolutely not. People with very long hair are usually quite proud of it and take meticulous care of it.|`|pFS2LZGKaa	No, if you get a nice hair cut it wont look unhygienic and it also depends on the texture of your hair.   Any lenght of hair can look unhygienic if you don't take care of it|`|KOzYvMPsaa	NO! I disagree with this completely. I have very long hair. It covers about 3/4 of my back and I am extremely proud of it. I have healthier hair than anyone of my friends who have short hair. I take care of my hair religiously and am always getting compliments on my hair. More so, I do hair modeling and the price people pay to take pictures of my hair is astonishing because it is real and think and healthy- very rare. I do not understand how it can be unhygienic as I wash it just as often if not more than someone with shorter hair. I find your question stupid and offensive. More so, it hold no logic in it at all "unhygienic"?? If someone can grow their hair long and not have to cut off all the dead ends it means they are doing something right at taking care of it. And those people are very fortunate because many cannot grow their hair past a certain length.|`|i5eUB0DIaa	you can tell if it is clean or not. if its clean on a guy, then he is gay but itleast its clean. if its dirty on a guy, then you can tell and he is a lazy *** and proally gay.     girls ont he other hand, anything down to the their shoulders and maybe a little more is hawt and they usually do take good care of it.|`|7utXmQQ6aa	I have had very long hair most of my life and I am not cutting it even though I am getting a little "long in the tooth" (horse person expression).  I have found that most people who don't like long hair it is because they can't grow theirs long or they are too lazy to take care of it.  Most men prefer long hair.  Short hair tends to get oily a lot quicker than long hair.  It really depends on how well a person takes care of their hair and people with longer hair do take pride in it so we tend to take good care of it.|`|ajERJKJOaa	yes. it is harder to clean and more bacteria and dirt catches on compared to shoulder length or short hair.|`|jez0O0bXaa	Not if it's clean, ends trimmed often and the proper products used for that hair type.  Personally on a anyone I think it's sexy.|`|Hcdh1pllaa	no...if there aren't split ends, and if it is not greasy, then absolutely not

N687m1EOaa	Idea one::Classic black shirt is always great, maybe a v neck or scoop neck. With dark wash skinny flare jeans and low red heels or even flats. You could put it together with a nice red bag and some silver hoops (not too big though!)    Idea two::Button up shirt like a baby blue color or navy blue with a white cami top underneath and some basic blue jeans, possibly straight legs, with white sneakers. A short pearl necklace would look great with it too.     Idea three::Baby doll shirt, (showing a little cleavage, but not too much!) either a pink or purple color, with a white cardigan to go over it. Topped off with either light wash straight jeans or a dark wash like in idea one. For an accessory i would go with, a matching headband of either purple or pink, whatever color your top is and a small white handbag.    I hope i could help, just remember im going off of the first impression, i don't know your body type or what kind of date it is, so i tried :) good luck!|`|qXoqyrGIaa	hmm i like it when girls wear skirts that arent too short but are a little above the knees and it shows the guy that you are feminine and not to slutty.The boy also likes it and lets him kind of know your into somebody so it get them interested in you|`|NLXhW9rBaa	Guys love dresses because they show your feminine side.

9dr0BZIbaa	Everyone suffers from pimples, but the best thing to do is leave it alone.  Dirty bacteria from your hands can get into your skin when popping a zit.  As well, popping can cause permanent scarring.  You still have a few days to get rid of the pimple, so try to maintain a healthy beauty regimen.  Make sure to wash your face in the morning and the night, so pimple-causing bacteria will be wiped off.  Soap is good, but make sure to use a really good cleanser every three days or so.  As well, toner makes a difference by unclogging your pores and cleaning out any dirt.  After washing your face, moisturize with an oil-free lotion.  Also try to eat healthy foods, such as bright fruits and vegetables.  Another thing to try is toothpaste, which will dry up the pimple.  If you must pop the zit, wash your hands and squeeze it with one finger on each side.  This prevents bacteria from getting in the skin.|`|ivlOxlG6aa	Leave it. If you pop it, it hurts and it could scar. So cover it up as best as you can (hat, bandaid, other stuff)|`|bZjuP1Bqaa	I always pop mine and put stridex on it and it's gone the next day|`|yhkEyVXLaa	To be frank, you should leave it alone.  It you force it along to pop it will just come back or even leave a scar type thing on your head.  You can try going to your local drugstore or walmart/target to see if there is anything you can put on it, just don't pop it.  If it is a white head right now, give it a couple/few more day to see if it will pop on its own.  Just wash your face twice a day and don't touch your face with your hands.  If it comes off while you are washing your face it should be ok, just don't force it yourself.  Hope this helps.|`|xzNr2RmIaa	Saturday is a ways away.  I say leave it.|`|6BWINZAdaa	pop it put on some peroxide & If you have differin put that on after it dries if not use neosporine( however you spell it)|`|nntQUfl1aa	leave it alone. it will just get redder if u pop it. just use cover up.|`|G965la4uaa	DO NOT touch it with your fingers because you have dirt on your fingers which could make it worst! put some toothpaste or acne cream on it after doing the following: take a wet towel with really hot water- dont boil the water tho because that is too hot and press down on the zit with the towel!    Also, popping it can leave scars and cause more to come and cause black heads! ew and it will be gross!|`|RKC36n9Naa	well they tell you not to pop it because it will scar. but honestly if you go to the dermatologist, they will just pop it for you... so you might as well try it yourself. just don't force it too hard, it should come out easily, if it doesn't than stop trying. the size should go down by the next day, but there will be lots of redness and it WILL look worse before it gets better. fortunately that's what makeup is good for. good luck. and if you do pop it don't pick at it, that will cause scarring.|`|hkBVXjTQaa	pop it and then put zit medicine on it|`|fIb6zHXxaa	LEAVE it, don't pop it. Wait until it develops first, and then pop it. So I guess, wait until Friday? Avoid touching it as well, it gathers up a whole lot of dirt there. If you pop it before it's mature, it'll leave scarring.|`|AA12116896	Leave it alone!! You can get a scar...|`|h9TEL6zHaa	If it does have a head it should go away by itself by Saturday.  If you pop it will turn red and even more swollen, scab up or worse may come back if all of the pus is not removed.      Follow the link and near the bottom it lists several ways to treat a problem pimple.    Ice is mentioned!    Good luck - and DON'T pick it :-)|`|XYrwAb1haa	I'd just leave it alone. It could leave a scar.|`|kD9576LTaa	depending on what it looks like, pop it. but if it looks like it will scar. dnt! put spot treatment on it, i have this one by clean and clear and it works wonders. i saw improvements over night. im not jk. and try some foundation. and concealer. believe me some good make up will hide that bad boy|`|D4NOrqM7aa	take a warm but not hot shower. dont wash ur face during the shower.  after the shower, take 2 q-tips and place on either side of the mountain=] squeeze until ALL the puss comes out (squeeze until you see the tiniest bit of blood). then quickly apply some salicylic acid (if you have some, if u dont apply a dab of honey). this will shrink the zit, reduce the swelling, and heal it up quick!  every night put a dab of honey on it. it will heal it up without a scar and leave your skin nice and smooth!    good luckerzzz
mY19PPlIaa	Well strech marks are caused by the skin stretching too quick. So I think its probably due to puberty and his body growing way too quickly and therefore his skin stretched more then it had room too and teared causing stretch marks. People also get these if they gain weight too quickly.  He could rub some bio-oil on  his marks to help fade them away a bit but they will permantely be there.|`|yo0qnedIaa	Is he over weight?  If not, has he been over weight at a time?  Another cause of strechmarks is from growing so fast.    I wouldnt be concerned. Its normal.|`|0udjgaoBaa	He must have lost a lot of weight...stretch marks are stretching of the skin.|`|i5eUB0DIaa	he jerks off to much. no lie.
ORROhT8paa	I think you should wait until your side bangs grow out. But... your choice!  =)|`|RvEnbEJcaa	get a parting brush and part your hair in the middle then comb the hair equally to either side of your head.|`|045475039e7707704e953cb92ce34514aa	After you wash your hair, part it in the middle. Then, blow dry each side starting from your roots and go upwards with a brush and as you get towards the ends, flip it out toward your ears. (use ur hands if you want even of course).    And then if you need to straighten it, just straighten the parts on a low heat setting and do it lightly.
hldaLhKkaa	Prettiest in my opinion is bottom right, and the two less fortunate looking ones top middle take the cake on being the least attractive ones.|`|KWko8dPCaa	the bottom right side is prettiest|`|blzFIxcUaa	Top right is pretty.Every one else is ok.|`|BJ7WUkhVaa	one on the right but both are pretty|`|SN0PQRGLaa	prettiest are the bottom right and the one above her|`|ZP1pLgpxaa	None of them.    All too young and fugly.|`|LAbQy9d4aa	No one O_o  Nice uglies party xD|`|BGNdKvXzaa	It is bad enough when people want to be rated, or compared with others regarding beauty.  But I really think it is cruel and disgusting that you want to know who is the worst looking out of the group.  If that is supposed to make your associate feel better in life, or help in her self-esteem, then I'm Santa Claus.|`|5JpZXy0saa	the bond is the prettiest everyone else looks the same|`|ajERJKJOaa	everyone is not really pretty...|`|6yIgck1Jaa	personally your all cute.

Thats horrible.    You obviously think you are the prettiest and are fishing for compliments.    Not one of those girls is ugly and I am not just saying that. Each one has something,    The girl at the back, far left, with the scarf is totally beautiful but I imagine she gets overlooked but she has a lovely face and will be really quite something when she is older if she knows how to work it!! x

But is your hair thicker or thinner, I have bangs with thick hair so i keep them wispy, but blunt heavy bangs makes thinner hair appear thicker, go for it you have a nice face and it will draw attention to your eyes!|`|F62pnlczaa	Yeah the modern look will suit you from what I can see in your picture. If not ask your hairdresser. If it all goes wrong it will grow back, learn from mistakes :)|`|cYET537Saa	im not really a fan of heavy bangs....but i actually think that they would look really cute on you|`|LlOzTmgzaa	i think that would look great on you!|`|446e84c620b50fc369761fcbf9a90563aa	I think it would great on you!

AA12203920	well I think its cute, think 50's poodles skirts...also black polka dots on pink very preppy    I mean everything goes with black so its not like the best color combo ever or something...|`|LREo3Tjpaa	yea they do but don't to it to much or you'll like you are trying to be punk or something|`|hEAuWYYjaa	yea they are a great contrast to wear|`|KYtHPGNyaa	yeah and there my favorite colors |`|qYPCkscTaa	Yeah, they're ok.|`|taMKteLVaa	yeahh.|`|RBnjDwyvaa	of course basically n e thing matches black but def they r so cute together they should get married|`|XUSETlMmaa	yes! especially with the pink and black low top jordans [ the 8's]|`|lY9k9ywIaa	i think hot pink and navy are the trend now|`|vhr9KVmqaa	depends on the clothes and shade of pink... but i wouldn't, its kinda punk|`|o6fTVw97aa	Pink and black is the most gorgeous color combo you could possibly wear. I adore it, and am always on the lookout for accessories that combine the two!
vZDzI1Eoaa	you can curl the long straight ones, and apply a bit more mascara to the short ones.    i wouldnt worry about it, people probably dont notice the difference    hope i helped!
AGbusTqGaa	If it doesn't stick to a magnet its fake|`|dxeb0BfBaa	look for a stamp on it, little tiny numbers, on rings its on the inside, same with silver. its REALLY tiny though so its kind of hard to see.|`|uRHVCvNPaa	gold is soft, but has other metals added to it give give it strenght. Thats why 10K is stronger then 14K,18K, 22K or 24K.Look to see if its marked anywhere.If it looks kinda like brass its fake. If its tarnished its most likely gold over sterling silver.|`|aHnjBlh6aa	if after wearing it your skin turns green..|`|7S5EgDFVaa	Real gold jewelry will have a marking on the inside that will say 10K or 14K.|`|jrB6z23Yaa	get it verified from  a jeweller.

kSHwAHbeaa	Just do yourself a favor and don't do it. Classy ladies don't.|`|TgU9P6pdaa	Um yes.|`|YgPYv4OPaa	theres no length restriction on tongue piercings :]  so of course you could get it done , !|`|bZjuP1Bqaa	I guess..|`|RyOWcmlvaa	i dont see why not ..|`|VHka0aHFaa	it depends cause i have a small tongue and got it done.It hard to say you have to have it looked at to make sure your veins aren't to close, but make sure you get it done by some one who knows what their doing, . If you have a small tongue its easier to hit the veins you have in them. if you hit one of those veins you can go paralyzed|`|FwalxbCRaa	If you can touch the bottom of your lip then yes you can get it done.

AA10849332	this is a no brainer...NEEDLE      guns cannot fit properly into your nose...which will make for a crooked piercing  even if you CAN get the gun in your nose, the jewelry type used in a gun is wrong.    no reputable studio will pierce you with a gun anyway. your nose is cartilage and guns are known to shatter cartilage.|`|S1yS9dKPaa	A needle is better. If you go to an actual piercer they use a hollowed out needle. This creates a hole in your nose instead of making room for the piercing. In the long run it will heal faster.|`|a503b666151ed0372de7a61b9a0a5dd4aa	omg definitely a needle, a gun can not be cleaned very well, and can shatter the cartilage in your nose. A needle is quicker and can be cleaned properly|`|b0faac3ed1304e5273874f6a9b472c45aa	probably a gun because it has a stopper on the back so that the needle doesnt go too far|`|DtG4zpM2aa	Needle.   Guns should only ever be used to pierce ear lobes, and nothing else.  I had my nose pierced with a needle about 6 years ago and never had any problems with it.|`|d4cmjFsJaa	A needle hands down. A gun has the potential to cause a keloid, which is an overgrowth that can occurs where you are pierced when the skin heals. They don't happen all the time, but I've seen them happen more often with guns.
9rz9XJdQaa	the most painful spots are along your rib cage & the inside of your arm (tricep area).    I have one on the top of my foot. Didn't hurt very much (not more than any other normal tattoo).    You can handle it, mine was fairly small and it only took about 30 minutes. I was definitely scared that it would hurt since i've heard all the rumours (that since it was closer to the bone and there was less skin that it would hurt more) but they were not true.     I consider myself to have a very low pain tolerance.|`|JUviY9hoaa	My most painful one was the one in the center of my back, just below my neck. Parts of it run up my neck and a good portion of it was right on my spine.|`|euZRbiA2aa	Got the inside of my belly button done.Its a back tribal sun that goes around and inside it.Only tattoo that made my eyes water and i have over 40 .|`|F6FXBXPNaa	I've had one done on the bottom of my stomach and it hurt soooooo bad!  But I must say, I have several tattoos on different parts of my body and the one on my stomach and back were the worst for me.  I guess it all depends on the person....Your pain tolerance and where your sweet spot is (the spot on your body that is more sensitive)...good luck with the foot tattoo |`|PQw92IGHaa	I got my first tattoo on my foot..on the inside portion of it below my ankle bone and it wasn't bad at all.  However, talk to your tattoo artist about the placement because of shoes etc. it makes it more likely to fade.  Across my rib cage hurt the most!|`|EE8hw8Agaa	My rib cage and back of neck hurt the worst,the feet weren't as bad as i expected honestly. Totally worth it!|`|tfTQ6Cuuaa	On my upper back, in the center...when he hit that little knobby part at the base of your neck...omg...it sent like electric currents down my arms and spine, it wasn't bad enough for me not to continue but I had to take a break at that point.|`|4ck9ojBWaa	Probably some tattoo that is really big, i do not think color matters.
bT9SXnYQaa	Using salon quality shampoo and conditioner.|`|Oo3PC1yQaa	All I know is that protecting your hair will keep it so that the color doesn't fade as fast. Like use special shampoo(for color treated hair) and before you go in the sun use some special leave in conditioner.|`|c98c60d71dbb85f0335e5c7fc391ddd3aa	i have a sister who uses shaving cream in her hair to make dye last longer

S4soZUFCaa	Sunblock increases the time before you get burned. 20spf lets you stay in the sun 20 times longer before you burn. Sunblock doesn't change whether you tan or burn, if you never burn you'll start tanning after 5 times the time you usually tan in with spf5.|`|x3aKiYg1aa	As long as it is not the white titanium dioxide then yes. Sunblock protects you from the UVA/UVB rays. It doesn't stop the skin from darkening which is how the body protects itself from the sun.|`|AA11452643	Yes, besides being limited with regard to protection, it also washes off in the pool, etc.<br>  <br>  Nothing will protect absolutely from the sun.<br>  <br>  Kumusta ka?

xjazE0xmaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  That's a pave setting (pronounced "pah-vay").  And it's very good for the lifestyle you describe.  <br>  <br>  Here is an overview of the eight most popular setting styles (including pave) with a chart that includes a "lifestyle" rating (for people like you said are "rough on their rings").  Below the chart is a little more information about each of the settings, info on how it's made, advantages, and disadvantages.  That way you can learn more about pave settings while also seeing the other options available.<br>  <br>  Personally, I think pave is pretty, but it only ranked a "very good" on keeping the diamonds in place, while three or four of the other settings scored better there.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.
VkzmH1GKaa	Same here everyone has it, wants it or cuts it. it does look good on some people but not everyone. saw an extreme version that was new, the entire back and sides were shaved to the scalp with the wings left. How about the reverseshort front angled backwards?|`|1Zbu0Z8vaa	ewww<br>  like eww<br>  lol
vZ4NXlBmaa	if you don't know  and you have to ask either of these questions  you shouldn't be getting a tattoo  definitely not this weekend or anytime soon    that's insane  and leads me to believe you're not mature enough for the decision yet      pick something out yourself.....wait until you're 18+ and mature enough, and if you still want it, go for it      good luck|`|Q0T1WZgzaa	my next tatoo will be "Your Name" and im putting it on my right cheek.    I always thought that would be funny as hell.|`|HLmd17r9aa	You could do a shape, like a heart or a star, with half of it coloured like an English flag, and half with a Jamaican flag. You could also get a word like "Pride" or Faith" and have them in bubble letters with the same effect of colouring the letters some looking like one flag, some like the other.    Another option would be taking ideas to a shop and having them draw something up for you/    Good luck!|`|ASSqyNDYaa	i think thats a cool idea with both flags. you should definetely do that. i would say the upper back area because u cherish those things highly.|`|wziUVyVoaa	I'm actually getting the chinese symbol for family put on the back of my rigth shoulder this weekend. I think if you put both flags on top of each other with the chinese symbol for unity, love, or family on it, that would be very very pretty.    EDIT -  Whoa whoa whoa. The heart idea above me is awesome.

Anything you put on where your highlights are will fade because the bleach took out the color pigment.

The beauty of this is it lengthens and separates  all your eyelashes to give definition. A couple of coats and your eyes look great for the daytime. Add another coat for evening glamour.    They have brought out a new colour called Carbon which the blackest of black which adds more definition to your lashes.    I have used dozens of different mascaras and always come back to this one..    Next on my list to try is Maybelline Colossal, Clinique Long and Pretty Lashes and Givenchy Phenomenon Eyes, which have all had great reviews.|`|8UycoN7kaa	Definately Rimmel Sexy Curves, Maybelline Colossal, or Bourjois Clubbing Volume :)|`|TKVQ2TXRaa	I say LashBlast Volume mascara.

4lTsTliJaa	it depends on how old they are, the condition of the shirts, and how much your particular store needs clothes right now.  they're mostly buying summer things this time of year.<br>  and if you don't like the price, you don't have to sell them.
KDdAH7Kwaa	It doesn't really matter which line of products but buy a strong mouse.  when you get out of the shower apply the mousse to DAMP hair, but it in a sloppy bun, and leave it in while you sleep.  When you wake up in the morning it should be dry and just take out the bun.  If you notice it isn't dry, next time blow dry it a little before you go to sleep

EBrfolf7aa	Moisturizer. It sounds stupid but the reason your face is producing so much oil is because it needs it.

9QnJt1IFaa	If theres a Hollister store close by you, I would just go in and show them.. If you have the receipt you will be able to get a full refund, if not, you should be able to get a in-store credit. If that doesnt work out, zippers are really cheap to fix. Good luck, and Hollister is awesome no matter what anyone says. Im sure its a cute jacket :)|`|AA11159067	A customer actually came into the store I work at a few days with this problem, and we let her return it. However, if you return now, if you don't have a receipt for it, we can only give you store credit for the current selling price which is $40.00 So if you have a receipt you can return it for store credit, because they probally won't have any more of the coats left.

cDn9bhcGaa	Shadesticks are quite versatile - and fairly easy to work with.  The one thing you need to be careful with is if you are doing anything overly precise - something the size of a Fluidline Liner (aka something with a much finer tip) would work better in these cases.    As for what colours to recommend - this is something that is IMPOSSIBLE to say, as we (the users of Answers) know NOTHING about you!    These would vary widely with your personal style, personal preference - and even what sort of look you want (as well as your mood).  And there are different colours for different occasions - an "evening" or "elegant" look would be VERY different than an "every day" or "clubby" look...    Pro Palettes (both in the 4 and 15 pan sizes) are available at ALL M.A.C stores - as are the Eye Shadows to fit them.  If all you have is a counter in a department store (rather than a standalone store), you might have to order these online instead ;););)|`|AaYEgDwWaa	you can get the pallette of MAC PRO.COM (I belive)   I lvoe mac and im started my collection alredy :)    I want skecth soooo bad lol next on my MAC TO GET LLIST LOL   I dont care for the shade stick cause it could break and then your *** out lol. so I'm going to stick with Pant pots and this is what I have     Cult Of cherry lipglass: cherry blossom FIRST MAC PRODUCT EVER  Cult of cherry Quad: boyfriend got it for me for my B-DAY  Shadowy lady   Mac Studio Fix Powder   Mac e/s Humid   Stars n rockets   Beauty marked   Mac Paint pot in soft orher   and I think that's it sooo far   Im gooing to the mall and I want 2 lipstick(in up the amp, and snob)   (2 e/s in gesso and i think i want handwritten or skecth) lol|`|DF22BQ3yaa	You should email a professional directly from their site. They can help you with this.|`|MDOO7vEMaa	I personally think that NAO (Never accept ordinary) is superior to MAC. It is a makeup brand offered by Quixtar. (I was involved in their business plan, and quit cause it was stupid, but continue to love the makeup!) It lasts a LONG time (I have had eye shadows for 2 years that i use OFTEN and i cant see the bottom yet!) They have everything that MAC has but is better quality, and lasts longer. Since NAO does not advertise (because they have the crazies doing their multi-level marketing scheme) so they can spend MORE money on research and development. If you do check it out, look at Artistry, too. Its a classier, more conservative and classic brand of make-up from the same web site. You should look into it, because then your make-up collection will be more unique than everyone else's!|`|as9RDbJaaa	I don't recommend mac shadesticks compared to nyx jumbo eye pencils. Shadesticks aren't going to go on your skin creamy unless you warm it up between your hands but, nyx jumbo eye pencils are always creamy and very pigmented. From what I have heard shadesticks are a waste of money. Eyeshadows i recommend are shale, passionate, stars n rockets, sushi flower, definitely vanilla, and sketch. Yes, freelanding mac stores, individual mac stores do sell empty palettes but, they don't sell eyeshadow refills the ones in the pan, you would have to depot those yourself and buy magnets. If you don't know how to depot there are tons of ways on the internet on how to do it and on how to also press pigments, and loose eyeshadows. Also you can purchase mac pro products thru phone or store, just not on the website and you won't get the pro discount you would have to pay full price. You can also purchase a palette thru phone whereas theywill ship it to you.    P.S Always check your makeup on cosmeticsdatabase.com to see if it has hazardous ingriedients before you buy or use it.

jKBDXgvZaa	Hair generally grows 1.25cm a month but this varies from person to person. So October is 9 months away so theoretically your hair should grow 11.25cm by then (approx. 4.5"). So if your hair really does grow very fast and you trim the bare minimum off during your 4month trim, you might be able to have it that length - but I think you'd need to grow about 20cm to match the photo from shoulder length hair...    You can always use hair extensions (glue or clip ons) if it doesn't reach that length in time :)|`|AA11910088	Absolutely Gena because no1 you are using a good product the tail shampoo and you are massaging your scalp so you know what to do and I'm amazed because some people dont know that they should message thier scalp so continue doing what you've been doing. I'm sure it will be there in no time and take some Biotin it really helps the hair.

6BWINZAdaa	Haha, watch commercials. There is not "wrong" way to shampoo you hair. Make sure the shampoo is evenly distributed & washed out entirely.|`|y1jRV0I4aa	Not when it's shampoo!    Take a small amount in a hand, rub both hands together and gently massage your scalp with it. Rinse, then continue with conditioner.     Depending on how much hair you have...conditioner might not even be needed.    You could always get a anti- dandruff shampoo because even if you don't have dandruff it's more healthy for your head.

lU8e0VQFaa	Most people have no idea what a keloid actually is, so unless they said they had it surgically removed they did NOT have a keloid, they do not just go away on their own, if anything they will get much much worse. It's possible you have a keloid, in which case that sucks, it's also possible it's a hypertorpic scaring (what most people confuse with keloids) which should go away after a while. Since you say it doesn't hurt then it's probably not infected, btw you should NOT be moving the earring around, that just damages the internal healing and prolongs the time needed to fully heal. Soap/Iodine are NOT NOT NOT proper for cleaning a healing piercing, you need to be using a warm sea salt soak. Orange Dial antibacterial soap can be used but it's really not required. I would go to a proper piercing shop and ask them what they think it is.|`|25ff5bc6369c61bbadbebeec3dc43ec0aa	You probably have a keloid. It can be caused by friction and constant movement and bumping of the ring. I tend to get these whenever i get cartilage piercings and they are fairly simple to get rid of. First i would do warm salt water soaks on that ear 1-2 a day. If that doesn't seem to work you can try tea tree oil, just a lil amount once a day will help dry out the skin. Hope this helps. If all else fails and your still not sure like i always say, check back with your piercer that's what they are there for.|`|151a2324f725c86d3034e4abc62c1c5caa	its NOT a keloid if u burst it and it bleeds or have pus  anyway i got one of those, mine bled. stayed for a month or so.  and is gone again jus like that, mine hurt at first tho. hmm.    its not infected. if its infected, it wud b reddish and skin will be peeling.    i din do anything to heal mine, actually, i din do anything to help my piercings heal faster
IO5NDDzJaa	Brown eyeliner would look good on you. The trick to making eyeliner subtle is a thin line. When your drawing your thin line you could try resting your pinky finger on your cheek to steady your hand so you won't mess up your eyeliner. Another technique to be successful in the art of eyeliner (lol) is to pull gently on your top eye lid with your ring finger or pinky. When I say pull on your eyelid I mean pulling it gently from the outer corner of your lid. You could also try putting eyeliner on your waterline and don't worry it wont hurt at all, it just makes my eyes watery. >.  You could try using eyeshadow too as eyeliner since it's not as bold as a pencil liner. But if want to keep it subtle do not wear liquid liner because the colour is very bold.    Oh and only wearing eyeliner on your top lid is not weird at all, in my opinion it is much subtle then wearing it on your bottom lashline or both. Hoped that helped! :)|`|6c7bdede6b91677231422742c57c31bcaa	Hazely-green eyes, you can get away with anything pastel in the green or brown colors, even a subtle gold, or bronze. Wal-Greens has many colors to choose from.  The secret to eye-liner is to have Q-tips on hand when you do it! With your pointy finger pull the eye lid toward the ear and just draw a line along the eye-lash line. If it is too thick use the Q-tip to take out some of the thickness. Make sure the Q-tip is dampened with water. Max-Factor also makes a Brunette mascara.|`|t4BpFdmdaa	Oh i felt the same, then i just pulled my lid down and did it really sowly..there was a pokey feeling. but then i was better at it. ask ur mom or just look in the mirror and try. dont be afraid. nothing will happen!    good luck    ps : not its not weird putting in on ur top lid.|`|zQQd2wPRaa	No, in the 40s/50s, putting everything on the top lid was fashionable.  You need to go to the makeup counter in the mall and ask them to help you-let them show you and talk you through it. Yes, brown seems like a better color.|`|AA11850523	use smashbox cake eyeline with the application brush  its so simple anyone can apply it without making a mistake ,   or poking yourself in the eye, or puling on the delicate skin    http://www.qvc.com/qic/qvcapp.aspx/view....|`|GIqACtxvaa	I always wear it on the top lid.  If I'm going more dramatic or for an evening look, I wear on top and bottom.  But for sure on your lid.  A little black mascara and glossy lips and you'll have a quick 5min face!   As you get more and more comfortable you can keep adding new items to your regime, such as blush and shadows.  Try new things you'll get the hang of it.     I have the same coloring as you and I always go for brown rather than black, its just much more natural while still doing its job - enhancing your eyes.

Lots of Luck and Have Fun!!!!  :)|`|ZjYLTdovaa	bold look: black  (ppl typically wear this color anyway)  subtle look: brown/dark brown    application: tilt your head back and that should give you the straight line you need to draw straight across. if you cant visualize what im saying then keep your head back and pull the lid with the ring finger (to minimize future wrinkles) and draw. practice makes perfect.|`|Ogu8kZGxaa	I use black eyeliner but go with what ever works well with you skin tone and putting it on top and bottom makes ur eyes pop but its scary at first when applying eyeliner but it takes practice, if your applying to the bottom lid pull your bottom lid down and go from the outer of your eyelid to the inner with ur eyeliner, use the retractable eyeliner!|`|LnJjgxMPaa	I'm not sure what color would work on you, but most of the big cosmetic websites have online help with that based on eye and hair color.  I'm a bit accident-prone myself was afraid/uninterested in wearing make up for years until college.  My taught me my technique and while it's not perfect, it gets the job done.  I start on the upper lid with a uniform line as close to my lash as I can get.  The line on my upper lid is usually a little thicker than the lower.  I start in the corner near my nose and slowly move across.  The key to lining the lower eye is to pull the skin down(yeah it looks gross) and start at the corner near the nose and draw a thin line.  If you're using a pencil, make sure it's sharp, so the line's thin and uniform.  Otherwise, unless you're going for a smokey eye, it's going to look sloppy and smudgy and quite racoonish.  Don't forget to "close" the lines off at the corner of your eye.  When my friend taught me to do mine, she said I wasn't doing that and it looked horrible.  lol.|`|pDamQpDHaa	the typical color of eyeliner is BLACK...   Dont try and use color into you get better.     Most ppl just wear eyeliner on the bottom alone sum just where it on the top. BUt i prefer both so my eyes can POP.    When doing the TOP u is grab close to the outside corner of my eye and put it in the way towards my hairline. Then from there i dont have to worry about my skin moving with the pencil. start from the outside and work r way into the nose.    When doing the bottom>> pull  the bottom lid down to the side. and start on the outside corner again as well and work you way into towards the nose.     Hope this helps
f4A8qMl3aa	go strapless... you don't want to look like those 60 year old women in sweatshirts who don't wear bras when they go out shopping at the scooter store.<br>  <br>  and if there's an accident... you'll be topless in front of the whole dance floor|`|j5k0VRbPaa	wear a bra|`|xxSGhywoaa	If you don't have too, it's only for a couple of hours, it's not going to hurt anything by not wearing one. Besides who wants to go out and spend more money on a stupid dance that only lasts for two hours and then you get stuck with a dress and heels that you'll never where again.|`|wqchA8B7aa	Bra. Don't go to a dance without a bra! You'll be a jiggly!|`|OsuvvU68aa	I think you should get a convertible bra (that you wear both with and without the strap) with underwire and a little padding. It will help make you look bigger and avoid the deer in the headlight problem if it gets chilly, if you know what I mean.|`|dL4x119gaa	depends on the message you're tryin to send<br>  <br>  i used to be a high school dude.<br>  <br>  the way they think, bra less means easy access and that you plan on allowing easy access...|`|oojO4WAraa	Wear a bra.  You can also use that strapless bra under tank tops this summer.|`|IB2V5t1Oaa	Wear a strapless one. You will feel more comfortable... trust me!|`|Fa6eAG6Taa	PLEASE WEAR A BRA!|`|80A6iHoGaa	use a strap less bra|`|LQqTQYYZaa	Bra; I mean you don't want your tities swingin around in the dance floor right? or do u?|`|UADLdXBtaa	I guess it depends if the dress has any kind of built in support like some spaghetti strap tank tops do. If it does then you are probably ok to go without but personally I would feel naked without any kind of support. A strapless bra is a good thing for any girl to have in her wardrobe and as soon as you have one you will think of tons of things you can wear it with so you might as well just buy one.|`|u9MWpkvNaa	I think it depends on how comfortable you are without one.  If you don't mind a little extra movement and (gasp!) poking out a bit in the chest area then go for it.  It's all about comfort, mentally and physically. If you don't wear one, you may want to consider taping the sides of your dress to yourself so you don't pop out.  All that dancing...you know. lol.|`|PhTKb3JUaa	You can get bras where the straps can be change around.  All you need is one that fits like a halter bathing suit.  Usually the tags show the ways they can be worn.<br>  You could resort to Band-aids for coverage, too if necessary.|`|EiX4L2xQaa	I would say you are safe to go without one but you can get these self adhesive ones that up lift you breast|`|oYmZUO8Caa	Is the halter padded? If not, wear a bra. It's worth it.|`|vEVtXftTaa	Go without!  It's much better than having to hike up a strapless bra all night.|`|vWRk0gViaa	Bra!

I just got one the other day from La Senza, and you can wear it so many different ways. It would also be useful for summer tops, so it's not like you would be wasting your money :)|`|Jteqao3zaa	depends, you're young and have smaller boobs so as long as the material of the dress isn't super thin go without.  a halter dress should hold em up fine.  if the material is thin just use band aids on your nipples.|`|fjvgaNydaa	If you feel uncomfortable not wearing one, try to find one that won't show in the dress. Otherwise, honestly, I think you would be fine without one.|`|8Ypkfr7jaa	Whatever will make you more comfortable. If you think going braless is okay, and since you said you're small, I guess no one would notice anyway.|`|UojyaVglaa	if your going to be dancing wear a bra. you don't want them to be bouncing out of your dress.|`|cec99146a72c0490860d8ff53310073eaa	Definitely wear a bra!|`|kvIDcbBiaa	They have these stick-on, bra-cup like things at Vicky Secrets that are supposed to be used w/ low cut dresses, strapless dresses..etc.  I forgot what they were called though...I'd get those.|`|bC8r2YTCaa	bra.... u will feel self conscious  the whole time go with a strapless or one of those sticky ones u can use for the night|`|zbqL749iaa	Wear a strapless one.|`|UnqAjpVOaa	Don't worry, you will be fine not wearing one|`|vbbiIEBBaa	I never wear a bra|`|NFOUfN18aa	bra|`|Om5rY23Waa	Honestly I wouldn't waste the time going to get one. But either way I am sure your boyfriend will think you look beautiful|`|F5oNaxMvaa	yea go wit one..<br>  get something that will support you..|`|7XSMjgroaa	Depending on your dress, if there isn't much support for what you do have or someone could easily tell that you don't have a bra on, then I'd suggest going out and buying a strapless bra. Try on your dress without a bra and ask your mom or friends and see what they think. If they couldn't tell you weren't wearing a bra, then you'll be good to go|`|UE07ucqWaa	try and do whatever is most comfortable for you - if your comfortable with no bra and you're pretty confident that it wont slip then do that.<br>  <br>  if you want to wear a bra find a strapless one - or if you find them uncomfortable then try and find a bra that come with clear straps|`|MSoOUmxTaa	There are plenty of types that you can wear that wont be vissable. I suggest getting one that is REALLY tight with no straps rather then wearing none at all. If your dress falls, the bra will totally save you from the embarresment of being nude. Plus it will cause like friction and help hold the top up better. In conclusion, I WOULD! <br>  <br>  (plus i always feel nasty without one. but you may be diff!)|`|3i27kZvNaa	it depends how low cut the dress is, if mit covers enough that u cant see the bra, then wear the bra..but if u would be able to see the wall, use boob glue that holds the dress tight to u so no one can see down ur shirt.|`|6fAsMB76aa	u know whats going to happen ur going to be dancing and ur shirt is going to fall down and ur going to flash every single lil boy in the gym and that would just be to embarrassing. wear a bra|`|64925c6c4ac9688871211ffac6800560aa	I would say no bra just because its a halter dress.If you don't feel comfortable with out one then I'd buy a bra that transforms into three different bras- strapless, halter, and regular.|`|rN3gJwg1aa	id always say bra unless there totally no difference between the two choices, just having a bra on makes me more comfortable also they make your boobs look bigger and have more clevage!<br>  good luckk=]|`|Q6osLdosaa	if you have nice perkier Brest than don't ware a Bra <br>  but if there saggy ware a bra <br>  if you don't ware a bra your boyfriend will enjoy it|`|04hIdBbYaa	i would only go without a bra if you Absolutely cant wear the dress with out one. I just think if feels awkward if you go to a dance with out a bra cuz it feels weird|`|pcCfHYeSaa	Wear a strapless bra, definitely. Dancing with no bra is not a good idea. It will also be wayyyyy more comfortable. <br>  <br>  Have fun at the dance!|`|B1Ls5Dpgaa	Get an interchangeable halter-neck bra. You don't want to be self-conscious all night long! You want to enjoy it!<br>  <br>  Have a fab time!<br>  x|`|lzye9Dbiaa	no bra its hotter xD jk bra because ur dress can fall off and that would be kinda embarrassing :\|`|Iuy8RryRaa	bra would be best. every body hates a girl without a bra.|`|dCuVApgNaa	Strapless|`|03rggPF2aa	go without one, it'll be much easier. some dresses even look better if you don't wear one. and your boyfriend wouldn't mind watching them bounce.|`|q7SQ6Tgfaa	dont wear one too uncomfortable

ZXESjmLlaa	As far as I know, following kinds of jewelry will turn your skin green.<br>  1. Copper Jewelry. <br>  2. Gold plated cheapy jewelry<br>  3.

Real jewelry with much soap scum.|`|5j0qSHXjaa	Fake jewls, real jewls aren't suppose to turn green or turn you green unless it has alot of soap scum in it|`|iTpH8oOpaa	I hear that lots of gold plated cheapy jewelry does.

I will never forget it.    My best friend and I were at church and she had asked me to walk with her to go and talk with the music director to see about joining the church choir. As we waiting for him to finish talking with another woman. My best friend. Looks at me and says OH NO! and turns bright red.    I noticed that she was looking around the church to make sure no one was looking but it was hard for us not to be noticed due to we were standing in front of the church. My best friend turns on her heels and runs off towards to exit.    As I followed I am yelling Whats wrong? She is laughing so hard to the point she cant talk. We end up in the baby changing room were she shuts the door behind us and says. Amy my panties are falling down. We both bust out lol. Then she smiles as she says Good thing I wore pants today.    As we walked back into the church she looked at me and said Note to self when you loose weight you dont just change your dress size you also have to change your underwear size as well We both fell out LOL|`|oPn8itQiaa	I'm going to throw my cousin under the bus on this one.    Back when he was in high school, he was in 4H and showed dairy cattle at the county fair.  The typical showman's uniform is white pants & shirt.  One time he got dressed in a hurry and grabbed his heifer's halter and made his way to the show ring.  Those of us that were doing the prep work followed along to see how he did, and quickly noticed that he had bright blue underwear on, which were quite visable through his white jeans.  Sucked to be him!  lol      Dana...don't tease us like that!  If you've got a good cheerleading story, you GOTTA share it!!!!!!!!! lmao!|`|jN98MkiVaa	Me and my cousin went to laguna beach for the weekend and when we were walking out and down the street almost close to the strip with a bunch of our friends something feel out of my cousins skirt it was her extra underwear that was stuck to her skirt she rushed and picked them up and put it in her CLEAR plastic purse!!!!!!!! Which her under wear were bright BLUE!!!!!!!!!!! Everyone saw even pedestrians. We stilk make funn of her for it!|`|6CpRaLSAaa	It was when i first started wearing women's underwear. they were black hi-cut briefs with a lace waist band and my shirt was pulling out of my jeans every time i sat down. i went to bend over in all places at a wal-mart looking for more panties and the lady who worked there cleared her throat and said well that solves who you are buying for, and i also notice that nice line in back known as a panty line and then she laughed and asked if i wanted a matching bra? it was embarrassing but also so cool that she accepted it. i walked out of there with shorts, bras, panties and a swimsuit (one-piece). so it is ok we all wear different things under our clothes and i am glad i have the freedom to do so. i love my blue, red, purple etc panties.|`|YeWuK0hXaa	omg omg omg     okay so one time in tlike 7th grade me and like 3 other friends went out to the store shed during gym to get the volleyballs.    the 8th grade guys were playing football out on the field across from the shed.    haha so anyway we were walking out to get them (and of course we were in our gym uniforms), and as we  were walking out my friend went up to one of the other girls and shanked her----  in front of all the 8th grade boys!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    haha it doesnt sound too good but it was hilarious.  haha and her underwear was like bright pink with flowers on it.    hhhhhhhhaaaaaaaaaaaha      ("

If you want your hair to look nice, you can pull half back with a clip. It looks cute and gets your hair out of your face. You could also try a high pony with your hair scrunched. Also, instead of wearing a sweatshirt, you could layer some tanks with a cute zip up over them. I hope these work for you!  Good luck,  tegs|`|3Dhacs6caa	i wondered the same thing...kinda. i wanted 2 know how to look cute while wearing uniforms.

79PXzdhfaa	Normally around 6-8 weeks but since you did it yourself I would give a couple extra to make sure it's fully healed before you start putting new jewellery in that could trigger and infection. =]|`|Qxk1V55Zaa	well anywhere from 4 to 8 weeks.. i have known peoples who have healed in a month and others took forever lol but.. it can range from there.. it just depends if you take care of it. and how much you play with it ..so.. don't play with it.. wash ur hands before you touch it if you have to touch it .and etc etc and it should be good to go in like.. 5-6 weeks|`|7erigI6Maa	Well i have done piercings myself no biggie.1st of all make sure you used the right piercing for the rea you pierced and keep it clean.Do not use alcohol or peroxide this will dry it up and make it take longer.I suggest Neosporin on the outside and clean like 3 times a day.I did and it healed great.Took like 4 weeks to heal but then again every1 is diff.Take good care of it and do not touch it with dirty hands you will get an infection
pDamQpDHaa	I am assuming that you are african american.   You can do your hair own your own its not always neccassary to go to the salon.   If you wash and condition your hair really good.  For example these are the steps i do:  1- wash hair.. rinse... pat dry  2- put a conditioner on it (perferrably a deep conditioner) and put a thin plastic cap on sit under the dryer for about 15 mns. if no dryer use a blow dryer until you arms get tired/  3- rinse out conditioner... pat dry   4- slick down edges and slides and entire head with mousse/ setting lotion/ foam wrap... whatever you have and sit under dryer til dry...     4.1- or - slick hair all the way back back and dry with blow dryer... try to keep edges flat and slicked down   5- when dry flat iron hair piece by piece what you get to the sides use very very very small pieces and crank the heat up      5.1- if need be you could also use a hot comb. they hace ones that you plug in and that you can put on the stove but i wouldnt recommend that one. But with hotcombs this allows you the get close to your scalp but you got to be VERY careful to to touch your scalp bc it will burn up.    Hope this helps!!!|`|djhCah5Maa	You can either blow dry it straight with a brush or use a flatiron.  I have also seen straightening kits at Walgreens.  Is your hair thick?  Maybe it also needs to be thinned out, so it has less volume.  It is hard to make it straight, if you have tons of hair.|`|wJ45gsyZaa	either a flattening iron, or get it a little thinned out. Thinning it won't take away from the length at all, it'll just help make growing it out a smoother transition..|`|6X4vNAHTaa	a flat iron they are like a gift from god!|`|6c7bdede6b91677231422742c57c31bcaa	Or........You could wear a hat for a while after you shampoo, to keep it flat. Or use a curling iron and curl that spot the opposite way.|`|ZjYLTdovaa	i think you're asian!    the best thing i can suggest is to wash your hair before you go to sleep and while its wet wrap a band or scarf around your head so the sides lie flat underneath. then gel them down during the day! they'll eventually grow out enough so that they'll fall straight down. this will take some patience tho.    but you might want to consider growing it out on just the top. or maybe that wont look goo on you? consider other styles as well =]
LREo3Tjpaa	They should I would not see why not. I've see prom dresses at Plato's closet before, I would wait until it gets closer to prom season and then take it up there you may get more money out of it. If you paid that much and are wanting quiet a bit for it I would not take it to Platos closet, I'd sell it on ebay or something.|`|F6TSGd7Iaa	do they take prom dresses at all?    ill take it from you :]|`|5b73ZOhkaa	Yeah it's nice! but i dont know about Plato's|`|bCjmjnqgaa	They might. ive never been there.   You could try higher end thrift stores or consignment places if they have them in your city.  I say that just because you said you paid 400 dollars for it, and from what I hear people get back pennies at platos closet.That would be really frustrating to get 50 dollars for a 400 dollar dress and then see them selling it for more.   If you dont care about the money, then donate it.   I usually feel better about donating my stuff than selling it to beacons closet/ platos closet/ or other similar places just because getting 10 dollars back on an 120 dollar shirt irritates me.

Check out the blog of this girl Xenia (also in the band Doe Deere, and has her own makeup line LimeCrimeMakeup.com). She has your coloring and wears lots of different looks in all colors! If some are over the top, you can tone them down but I think she looks gorgeous in all of them. (these are all the posts under her 'makeup tutorials' category, so just scroll down for different looks and photoshoots) http://www.doedeereblogazine.com/article...    Also try checking out MAC's new collection Blonde Brunette Redhead.

Most stores will do this as part of a sales pitch, so be ready for the hard sell.  The purpose of this is to find out what color foundation is best for you, and then experiment with colors in eyes.  I find that brown is great on almost everyone, but red would look good with plum or olive colors.

Sr1kywKFaa	That really depends on you. I'd ask your mom when these started happening, just to get an idea. I had to shave my underarms at 10, but didn't shave my legs until I was 14. As for makeup, my mom started putting it on me when I was a freshman in high school. I didn't wear tampons until about 16 because my mother wouldn't buy them!

Wearing Make-Up - Depends how much you're talking about. I wore foundation from a young age and the I started wearing mascara when I was about 12 or 13.  Shaving Underarms - When I was 14 because I never had hair under my arms up until then.  Tampons - Haven't started using them yet because I haven't started my period.  If you want to know when to start doing all these things, it's just basically when you're reading. There's no point shaving if you don't have hair and start wearing make-up when you have the confidence to.

SjYvZsrOaa	apparently Sunlight dish detergent was used years ago to remove perm from one's hair. Try it, it doesn't do damage to your hair. I have the thinnest hair every, and it came out the same healthiness. But be sure to boost your hair after with a good conditioner and shampoo. And, after doing this, start using a leave in Condition or defrizzing serum to counter attack any damage that has been done by the perm.|`|HXeFTkynaa	Continue using conditioner (or use more of it at the ends).  I guess the only way is to go for rebonding but i'm only afraid it will harm or damage your hair. If i were you i will wait for it to grow longer and trim the ends often. This way you will lose the fluffiness.    That's just me though. Hope it works :)

Washing your hair daily, will dry out your hair.|`|yXGlmUqlaa	the reason your hair gets so oily everyday is because you wash it everyday.    natural oils get released and because you wash them away everyday they keep replenishing themselves. best thing to do it not wash it everyday and get your hair used to not being washed everyday.    i don't know if this makes sense and i know it's not a technical way of explaining it but oh well.    if your hair stil gets really oily ask your hairdresser. she might be able to recommend a good shampoo    Edit: i also just remembered. my boyfriends hair used to be oily like yours and his mom bought him herbal essences in the green bottle, sorry i don't know what it's called, and now it's not oily|`|jez0O0bXaa	Make sure you're not using a moisturizing shampoo/conditioner.  Use some thing more volumizing.  If you can don't condition every day or use a very light one.  Nothing wrong with doing it every day just your hair type good news as you get older it will stop and you won't have that overly dry hair look.|`|AdGcqzwXaa	no, i wash my hair everyday with shampoo and conditioner and i have healthy hair, its not bad to do that|`|HXeFTkynaa	You should go and look for a shampoo that is solely meant for oily scalp. (maybe you can try this brand- shiseido)    http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/SENSCIENCE-SPECIAL...    It's pretty good. :)    You might want to consult your hair stylist for help or tips to improve your hair condition. And never apply conditioner to your scalp (in case that is the reason to your oily hair)    By the way. There is absolutely no harm in washing your hair everyday as it clears off the dust and dirt your hair collects in the day.    Good luck!|`|tJ68uyKRaa	If your hair gets greasy everyday it wont harm your hair by shampooing it everyday.|`|mqlzkJ54aa	Everyone is different.  If you hair is in good shape and it's not dryed out.. then wash it daily.  Most people wash their hair every other day or so because their hair is dry and they need the extra moisture that the natural oils give..  Like my hair gets dry so it's better to not style and wash my hair daily.  I do every other day.|`|SjYvZsrOaa	Try washing it with only conditioner every other day. Or, try rubbing in baby powder on your roots, to mask the oil, if you don't have dark hair, on the days that you don't wash.|`|yr1685V1aa	do nt was t evry day but wash it evry 2 days thats helthyer for it :)hope i halpt|`|tDZMJue9aa	my son washes his everyday and doesnt use conditioner because his head already makes more than enough oil, he also has semi long hair...around his shoulder area in the back...

YxFZod9iaa	I think getting a tattoo on your neck that says "east coast" will be a bad idea. I don't think that is unique at all. I have seen many people (at least where I'm from) with their gang affiliation such as east side, east coast etc on there neck. I would hate for you to be labeled if that is not what you are going for. I'm sure you are more unique than this. Take some time and think it over. Remember this is permanent.

mZZ2l13vaa	Well, my only real advise is to not buy crappy makeup.    some makeup might be a little more expensive but its worth it.    make sure to clean your face very well, wash it at least two times a day and make sure not to sleep with your makeup on, it makes you brake out.    Try going for natural colors, and you never need a lot on. sometimes less is better then more. Experionce with difrent colors and shades, fine stuff that looks good with your skin. try to fine eye makeup that  bring out your eyes.    for lip stick you should always remeber to blot, and then after that you can but on a shade of lip gloss too to make your lips shimmer.

C0HZ8ZB4aa	Ok, this is coming from a parent and a tattoo lover - you won't change her mind. When somebody feels that strongly about something, she is set. I love tattoos, have tattoos, yet the thought of my son getting tattoos when he is older makes me feel sick. Bizarre, I know. I look at his skin and think that he's so perfect the way he is, the thought of him modifying it and hurting himself and leaving permanent marks on himself upsets me so much. Very hypocritical, I know! My dad hates my tattoos, but it is only since having my son that I've been able to see where he's coming from. I would imagine this is the reason behind your mum's dislike for what you're doing, and no matter how hard you try, you aren't going to get her thinking like you do, because she views you in a different light to how you view yourself.     But the fact of the matter is that you are now an adult. Your mum made her choices in life, and now it's your turn to make yours. If your mum is unhappy about it, then that's unfortunate, but you don't need her permission. If you are living with her and paying no rent, then you do have more of a problem, because it could be argued that you need to respect her wishes when she's supporting you. So perhaps hold off until you have moved out of the home. You have a long life ahead of you, there's really no rush (although I know what it's like to be impatient!). And that way, she will have no hold over you at all, and although your body mods will still hurt her feelings, you will minimise the hurt as best as you can because you won't be under her nose every day to remind her of it.|`|WYa3UY6Gaa	Your 20....... If you don't like your mom's opinions on your tattoo's/piercings. Move out...you are in her home, and you should respect her wishes or leave.|`|EE8hw8Agaa	I feel your pain.Im 19 and live with my Aunt,every time she sees something new she acts like i absolutely broke her heart or did it to hurt her. Iv talked to her about how they make me feel/how i feel naked without them. I try to describe it like someone denying her the right to get dressed in the morning,cut her hair how she likes,or chose her own shade of lipstick. In the end there is  really nothing you can do to change her mind,but hopefully she will see its something you need to do. One more thing,I suggest you heavily research/think about scarification before you decide to do it,it can have soooo many things go wrong an often look like just a blob :(

They just get weighed down :(|`|UbXVjcm7aa	I've been wearing mascara for like 15 years now and still can't find a good one. I've tried them all I swear the best I've come across is Maybeline Lash Discovery it has a really tiny brush so you can maneuver it better and it doesn't clump but I'm still on the hunt for a really good one!|`|FT18CiZBaa	well for those standards i really like collossal it defffffffffffff gives u the full effect :)|`|n3akm5u6aa	clear mascara natural|`|Sr1kywKFaa	Good mascara is tough to find. For me, I like Max Factor, which I never had a problem with, until I started wearing contact lenses. Another good one is Fiberwig, a Japanese mascara that's only at Sephora. I think you might want to invest in Sephora's Lash Stash, which is a set of like 8 different mascaras. That way, you can try and see which one is best for you.|`|AA10552781	SMOKEY LASH MASCARA by MAKE UP FOREVER.    Hope that helped.    Good Luck.|`|isqbDHTtaa	Try one of the 2 step mascaras, they can be a little time consuming but if you have short eyelashes like me they really add length and volume.    Iv found loreal beauty tubes to be one of the best and it looks the same after a long night out as it did when u left home!|`|rcV7Cmq8aa	Maybeline is best|`|ehOMbrR9aa	I have finally found my favorite mascara and I recommend it to everyone!     Avon Super Full Mascara.      It's AMAZING.  It doesn't clump and it really does make my lashes look full and long.  Definitely try it out, it usually goes on sale too in the Avon Catalog so it's not that expensive!|`|Jt7cW9wraa	my favourite is CoverGirl Lash Blast  :)|`|WiIvrl8Naa	the most popular is Diorshow but I love Loreal Voluminous Mascara, but you can't put on but 1 or 2 coats or else it looks awful, but it makes your lashes look and beautiful, I love it, it really all depends on how long and thick your eyelashes are as to how many coats you should put on and what kind of mascara would look/work right on you, so do a little searching on google and experiment with different kinds until you can find something you like, good luck and have fun

ZoJqQD9zaa	15|`|djFYf3qUaa	you look...............hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...  15?|`|Ps5rsLyeaa	You look about 13/14 years old and your eyes are very green.. thats a pretty feature =] But be careful about who sees your pictures just advice =]|`|gDEFlWnOaa	You look 12 in the first pic and about 14 in the last... I love your eyes.|`|LkMeHaWsaa	you look about 12|`|BsifmqzPaa	I really like your nose, it's cute :]  and your eyes are pretty.    and you look amazing with blunt bangs.  I'd say you look 14 or 15|`|pSNex1a1aa	12/13? 13 more likely. bit hard to tell because of the brightness of the photo|`|hRV18njLaa	Eyes are the best feature ^.^    Erm, Blunt fringe looks the bestest obvi!    No, you do not look like an eight year old. Who ever said that is probably short, fat, ugly or just mean. (who did say it btw? it wasnt me was it? :L:L:L)    I like the comment about the makeup up there ^ somewhere.    Try wearing more? Just a suggestion :D|`|cLVZT3ASaa	You do look mighty young.  You have a pretty smile.|`|266l7JpGaa	I was able to view the pictures :)    I think you're very pretty, and it almost does look like you're really young, but I don't think its your face that's making you look so young, I believe its your hairstyle. Believe it or not, it really makes a difference. I suggest that you make your hair wave with side fringe and part your hair to the side. This style is kind of the best style for all face types and has an awesome way of making a person look more mature. Try also not to put hairbands in your hair unless your hair is in an updo, this also decreases your age visually.    Another idea is to possibly put on a bit of makeup. If you're underage, its probably best to ask your parents before you do, but if not, I'd say go for it. A bit of eyeliner, smokey eye, lip gloss and blush will go a long way and make you look more "mature", and not "older".    To answer you question on your best feature? I'd say your eyes. Really play those up to wow the public!    If you need any tips on how to make your hair wavy, or do any other neat things with it or your makeup, check out "PURSEBUZZ" on YouTube. I love her videos and she goes through the instructions very clearly and simply.|`|u7o75zipaa	Umm, 13/14ish?  Your eyes are your best feature.  And I think you look good with a blunt fringe. Your hair is a good contrast to your eyes.    :)|`|aleWoJufaa	You look around 14.

2Urd6VLqaa	Usually when someone is talking about "facial hair" they are referring to beards, mustaches and go-tees.    But, in all consideration, eyebrows are hair that grow on your face. So they are probably facial hair.    ?|`|368008361e77a77ceeb8c70a92a3c2b8aa	no.....facial hair usually means beards & moustache's....!|`|p3GZERIsaa	Yep.

YES|`|N9ciNltLaa	Well. It IS hair. on your face. I guess so?    edit-  i don't really know lol. It's just that the definition of facial hair is - hair on the face (especially on the face of a man).

It's just not unwanted facial hair.|`|qjb81dNwaa	yes and no?|`|C2UYbZsUaa	Depends what you think facial hair is?    e.g Beards   LOL|`|SUo3vEMwaa	no they arent but should|`|W0A39Ysjaa	NO duhh! lmfao!!! haha|`|tM1wHAfYaa	HAHA!!!! ummm i think sooooo.... hmm xD|`|UqnDPieSaa	hahahahaha yepp yepp      :DD    ?
CGFsccDXaa	Vinegar can be used as a clarifying shampoo for your scalp if you have too much dandruff or product buildup. If you use too much, or use it all over your hair - yes it can dry it out (just like a normal clarifying shampoo). It can hurt a colour treatment, but there are ways to get around it. Say, if you have brown hair, use apple cider vinegar! :)|`|LlC99CYqaa	vinegar is acidic , but i haven't tried it . i would be careful though since it's very acidic (:
d51dd7fd8f2fc17781c971e474fb25b5aa	egh. oil could possibly dry it out or infect it... neasporin... or something... try not to go around the time your period is due... the pain and red factor are much higher then!|`|NrOFHq19aa	that happens to me too, but  iwent to this really nice spa once, and they put baby powder on and it really helps.|`|ESWeS3Qkaa	um mm you should try deja vu nails and spa if you live in ohio new albany if you dont you could use cotten with oil or soy milk on the cotten ball|`|IWbFqtQ3aa	Find some place that does threading, instead of waxing.

388cf0eaa7a2668947f521c57a657534aa	i would think a quick dip in isopropyl alcohol would do the trick. after that, just let it dry on it's own and then maybe wipe off the top layer if it looks like it has been used.     that should keep anything from spreading.   also, here's a quick video that may give you more information  http://www.wonderhowto.com/how-to/video/...|`|QgEADHzgaa	why on earth would you buy lipstick from EBAY?!?!    i wouldn't even try it, find your lipstick somewhere else. it doesn't even sound like something you could sanitize, sorry.|`|as9RDbJaaa	Go on Youtube  and search Pinkiecharm.

C0HZ8ZB4aa	You could have something simple like a star (it's rare that I ever recommend star designs but I think it would work for the purpose you're describing!). You could have an ankh symbol for eternal life. Or perhaps a little white dove, a generic symbol for peace but would be a nice way of remembering.|`|H3PcFertaa	I am sorry for your loss.

e1434520b7d6b7db2b483084c9ad434aaa	Mixing brands is fine. In fact sometimes you need to rotate products around in case they build up. Oh and I think you meant DevaCurl. Good products, but just so you know those are like $14 each.    If you want to run out and pick something up locally, I recommend trying the following products:  - Drugstore: L'oreal out of bed weightless texturizer (black tub, use under gel), LA Looks or Herbal essences gels, Suave naturals or vo5 conditioners, L'oreal vive pro hydra gloss or nutri gloss for curly hair, red Cream of Nature shampoo  - Organic/specialty store (like whole foods): Giovanni Direct Leave in condish, G conditioners, G tea tree shampoo, Aubrey Organics Honeysuckle Rose or White Camellia Conditioners, AO B-5 Design gel    These are all good things I have used, but be sure to tinker around with amounts and how you use any products. For hair type specific products check out these forums:  http://www.naturallycurly.com/curltalk/  There you can find others with the same hair type and try out some of their favorite products. However, the most popular ones are usually only available online.    Here are some basic tips for curly hair that you might find helpful:  *Try to find a stylist who knows how to work with curly hair. You can find reviews by region here: http://www.naturallycurly.com/curlsalons  *Don't shampoo every day.  *Comb conditioner through hair in the shower.  *Apply styling products to dripping wet hair. Scrunch or twirl hair to achieve desired shape.  *Use styling products suited for your hair type. Dont know yours? http://www.naturallycurly.com/hair-types  *Avoid terrycloth towels on hair; use linen, paper towels, or t-shirts instead.  *Air dry or use a diffuser with your blowdryer.  *Don't touch (or brush!) your hair while its drying.  *Once completely dry scrunch out any crunchy texture.    Lastly, it has made my hair so much better since I started the curly girl method! I used to almost never wear it down (it was a frizz/poof ball), but now I have pretty, shiny curls. ~:) Its pretty radicalno sulfates (shampoo) or siliconesbut its so great for curly hair. Give it a shot and check it out:  http://www.wikihow.com/Follow-the-Curly-...  http://www.ylcf.org/gotcurl/ (outdated product recs!)    Some other great curly care sites:   http://www.youtube.com/user/jessicurl  http://livecurlylivefree.com/home.htm|`|c3164fd5294e4ea808a10ca45286eae8aa	once i have started using head and shoulders intensive care it rly helped get my frizz out and have softer hair. it says its for dandruff people but dandruff or not it works well and if you cant see dandruff thers dandruff all right! its 4.50 dollars. pantenes rly good also. i currently use suave lavender conditioner, head and shoulders intensive care, and dove thearpy. its a great combo. makes your hair smell good and seem more healthy. try it! hope i helped.|`|091246dcc7536aaf28ae7d9ad3351c75aa	I have naturally frizzy hair and I think using the more expensive shampoo & conditioners work better, even though they cost more...

LYdxypciaa	Hiya Lauren,  Unfortunately I don't use it but i picked up this comment on it for you;  "MAC'S Fawntastic Cream color base is unbelievably smooth and non-greasy. It can be used for cheeks- doesn't accentuate pores. (They have sadly for me discontinued my favorite color - fuschia perfect that I use for rouge). For eyeshadow I use as base and alone and love the natural look and ease of use and easy spreadability."   Come on Lolly Dolly thats gotta get best answer? :D|`|L67GTLROaa	try looking on website|`|Uotb9Ygsaa	well try getting friends that use mac makeup lol jokes ilu lauren x
2Urd6VLqaa	Try investing in an eyelash curler.  But if you are broke (like me) you can curl them with a spoon.  Watch this video for instructions:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L61XiKV_f...    ?|`|AjWd3fSvaa	eyelash curler!|`|QKV0VYXQaa	Really simple- eyelash curlers! Easy to use with great effects, you can pick them up for about2 from boots! Couldn't live without mine!|`|N687m1EOaa	Get a length mascara that has a comb brush instead of the usual fat one, i suggest something by maybeline. When you apply it kind of move the brush side to side and comb up your eyelashes, it is annoying to do, and may take a little bit longer then normal, but it works :]|`|MDOO7vEMaa	Everyone is going to say 'eye lash curlers' and it is true, but you have to WARM it up with a BLOW DRYER before you use it. It REALLY helps and make my lashes stick straight up! Be careful not to get it too hot or you will burn that area under your eye-brows. (that hurts, that skin is very soft, so test the heat of the curler on your inner wrist first.) I learned this from Tyra, she has some great tips. maybe check out her website. I have never been there but she has given me great tips from watching the show so I bet her site is chock full of GREAT tips. She is a model, she would know, right? LOL|`|as9RDbJaaa	LASHBLAST Mascara!|`|DDBwqwnxaa	EYE LASH CURLER!|`|rPk2goGxaa	use an eyelash curler  http://media.photobucket.com/image/eyela...  like this one, you can buy that at any convenience store for like 2 dollars|`|S7bgGIDvaa	Use an eyelash curler, and honesty form my own experience in addition to search online the volume mascara does not really work, the best thing there is would be to use the eyelash curler.

xaaZSbnVaa	The one side thing, being the right side of your ear pierced, only applies to guys.

i1JVe24Oaa	if you really want to use makeup, natural mascara+ eyeshadow and a little bit of lip gloss is more than fine.     do not use foundation, it's not good for your skin and let's be honest - you don't have wrinkles or hangovers to hide, do you|`|NSKLYneEaa	yea it's ok. that's the age i started to wear makeup but don't wear too much|`|17b8d68d2416136c4c415502cc901eeaaa	just go to a makeup store and look to see what foundation best matches your skin tone. if you're just getting started wearing makeup, you'll have to just play around with different colors of eye shadow and such until you find one that works best for you.|`|iKK89z2Eaa	a little bit of bronzer, not too much dont make yourself look orange and make sure you even it out    brown eye liner on your bottom eye lid, not black if you have fair skin and light hair    brown mascara only on the top though     get an eyelash curler if your eye lashes arent naturally curled    some lip gloss    a light brown eye shadow for only the top    good luck! if you have any questions how to apply the makeup let me know!|`|h3Ubar0Zaa	haha   i have all the same things as you  i have ivory skin  blue eyes  and brownish dirty blonish hair      anyways  dnt go over the top you kno?  a little is ok.    now are you asking what to put on?|`|AA11554649	i think that at your age you should not worry about make up, but if you really want to then i would say only a little bit of light brown eye liner and some brownish-black mascara|`|KSMU64ssaa	Beige and white shimmer eyeshadow. (Not too sparkly!!) Some mascara, and lip gloss. Beautiful.|`|MK5Ddtiiaa	I guess so.|`|bkij4JnKaa	I recommend only wearing brown mascara, light blush and a little lip gloss.

I'm 14 and pretty much the same as you, and eyeliner can look too severe if you don't put it on right. A little bronzer, & a little lip gloss. oh and if you get foundation make sure it matches your skin!!!!! Hope this helped!|`|l6ipfYD9aa	yes y not|`|AuZQLtxSaa	yea you would probably look fine. if you say your skin is on the pale side you should find a blush that compliments you.  You should try out different eye shadows on in the mirror and then you should decide which one you feel comfortable with.  They way you look is totally up to you and you should feel comfortable about how you look.... some really great places to get make up are Walgreen's and CVS that's where i always get mine! Have FUN!

PCVJg5ieaa	You can, it's not so much that it would hurt (although you will have to walk on the scab for the next week and so the Tattoo will become distorted and walking on it will hurt), but you know how ticklish the bottom of your feet are.  Imagine constant moving pens upon that very sensitive area.  It would drive me batty.  I have one tattoo that comes close to the armpit, and it was almost unbearable.      There will be some pain, but not much because the bottom of your foot is pretty well callused: it will be much more the annoying that it would cause and possible after-effects.|`|vZ4NXlBmaa	This doesn't require "tattoo expertise"  it requires the ability to use a simple Search Bar      yes, you can....but that's one area of the body that doesn't take ink very well  mostly because of how much stress you'll be putting on the new tattoo|`|EE8hw8Agaa	Don't do it. My feet are covered,and where the tattoo went down towards the sides are completely faded,just like the skin on the sides of your hands it doesn't hold ink well at all! You could get it touched up,but it fades so quickly there is really no point. As for the pain,the top of my foot hurt the worst(but not horrible) and the sides the least,but again,i dont suggest it at all!|`|2f05f1797218d6d460cdf8e06af0c251aa	yes you can....and it would hurt like a ************* bit*ch|`|jeqpSdtkaa	a bottom of the foot tattoo would just be like tattooing your palm.   painful and annoying.  you would have to get it touched up sooo many times.  but I'm not going to stop you.  I think a tattoo on the bottom of your foot would be a good experience.  at least you can say you've done it!|`|6lmFyr2maa	well most tattooist wont do a tattoo on the bottom of your foot but there are bound to be some places that will, and if they do they're probably a bit dodgy.    nobody bothers to get tattoos on the bottom of the feet though because its a nightmare to keep still when being inked... just think of how bad it will tickle...... as for the pain... it will hurt A LOT!!!!    plus the arch of the foot doesnt always stay clear of the ground too so its really not worth it. the tattoo will get ruined.     xxx|`|C0HZ8ZB4aa	Tattoos on the arch of the foot always rub off. There is a lot of friction between that part of your skin and the floor and shoes and clothes and they last a very short time. You don't have to believe me and you can go out and get it done, but I promise you in next to no time you'll realise I'm right. So unless you have the money and patience to keep getting it touched up repeatedly, I wouldn't waste your time.|`|WYa3UY6Gaa	You can, but it's a bad idea. Foot tattoo's need to be touched up tons of times as it is. If you had one on the bottom of your foot it would not be there very long at all. Think it's what you walk on lol constantly rubbing. It would be hell to heal. I suggest not.

sOdTqo9Zaa	I think I know why you are getting the spots. Do you lean your chin on your hands? Perhaps at your desk with your elbows on it? The oils on your hands clog your pores and cause spots.

Theres two different ways you could go to the doctors and ask them about this roll on gel called "panoxyl gel/cream" it's really good and it works quite fast! Or tea tree oil that helps to, it stings though so your best going for the first one! x|`|bxOzbSv4aa	I use DUAC i got it from my doctor, when you go just ask for that its good but don't put it all over your face because it dries it up alot so just dab it on your spots.    i also have clearasil skin perfecting wash and that helps your spots and it also has moisturiser in it so its kind of a 3 in 1 wash, you use it twice a day.    And like someone said toothpaste, its good to dry spots up with if you cant get any Duac and then wash it off in the morning.

You will have to lighten your hair, for blond highlights. If you'd like to do it yourself and your hair isn't that dark DONT bleach it. Go to Sally's beauty supply, and ask one of the employees to help you find the "Clairol Professional Complements line" and look at the color swatches that they have and choose the color of blonde that your hair normally turns after you bleach it. It's safer than bleach.|`|DaFIrZVxaa	Depending on what you use to color it.|`|V6CftKitaa	usually it does. 99.98% of the time anyways

I'm basing that on male instinct. the second one is a school girlish look.|`|TorFeZHpaa	I think both straight and curly looks fabulous on you:)   You should definitely keep it long...and I would stick with highlights. But, if you really wanna dye it, I would go with darker. Darker highlights would look nice too:)
u6c5bTbVaa	To do this, you would need the closest colours to the eyshadow you see in the picture. (A turquoise colour, deep blue, a shimmery purple, white).    (I usually put on the eyeliner first, but you could do it in any order since it doesn't matter.)    Apply a nice layer of black eyeliner on the bottom water line. Make sure to make the ends meet with the layer on the top lid. For the top lid, you'll need to draw a light outline of how thick you want the eyeliner to be. Once you find how thick you'd like that layer to be, you can fill it in.    You'll need a thin point brush for the purple. Apply it carefully and lightly next the the water line on the bottom lid, and try to get the wing affect. You may have to practice making it look nice if you've never done it before.    Then, apply the deep blue above the eyeliner on the top lid, and make it swerve around the corner of the eye like in the picture. Take the turquoise colour and apply it around the eyeliner and blue, making it meet up with the purple flick.    Take the thin point brush again (while clean) and carefully apply a soft layer of white just above the crease on your top lid, without touching the turquoise. Don't make it go too far out to the left corner, mainly just toward the right.    Annnd, I think the person's eye is very pretty. It reminds me of my mom's eyes since she has forest green eyes and brown specks all over them. It's pretty cool, and I wish I had them.|`|Vhq3GURQaa	The trouble with lining the inner eye (bottom lid) is that you will get black eye goobers in the corner of your eye that are unappealing. When people talk to you all they can look at is the gunk in your eye. I agree with above the lining looks too trashy for any one who isn't a make up model or at a big night time extravaganza.|`|Twq7efhQaa	First of all i think that this eye make up is really pretty and I have defo done something similar with my own make up.    You will need an eye liner pencil, liquid eyeliner, concealer, purple eyeshadow, blue eyeshowdow, mascara and eyelash curlers.    To start off with put concealer underneath your eyes and blend down to your cheek bones giving you a raidiant look, then also put some on ur eyelids up to your brow line.      use the eyeline pencil to pencil in a line on the inside of your lid being careful not to poke yourself in the eye and get a small brush to blend.  For the next part you need a really steady hand. Take the liduid eyeline and start from the inner part of your eye and draw a line right the way across, as close to your eyelash line as possible.  If you want you can have the outer edges flicking out to make your eyes look wider.      Then take a smal brush and brush lightly the blue eyeshow on the top of the eye lid - very lightly as it does look like a deep blue colour  - but add more if you wish it to be a deeper shade.  Then any blue eye showdow that when over the top of the eye liner touch up.      Then take another small brush and use the purple eyeshadow to make a line under the eye lid dusting it out to the corners.     Use the eyelash curlers first at the base of your eye lashes and then mid way.  Give your lashes a good two coats of mascara and your all done !!|`|hOVzviFIaa	I hate eye make-up like that. I love the colors, but by rimming the skin between your eyelashes and your eyeball with black eyeliner is not only bad for your eyes, it looks really trashy.    My opinion|`|L6b2BFG8aa	Yeah that's cute. I would use a colored eye pencil. Cover girl makes cute, inexpensive ones. I recommend revlon color stay eyeliner. Do the teal on top first, then do the black eyeliner, then do the pink on the bottom then the mascara. The key is to start from the inside corner of you eye (by your nose) first then go outward. It might take some practice to get your lines straight but keep trying!|`|UEA4Uli9aa	I think it is very pretty and it makes me happy actually.     Pick out shades of pink/light purple and blue you like and put the purple/pink on top and the blue on bottom very lightly.   Then outline your eye closest to your lash line with black eyeliner (I use  maybeline unstoppable).   Do the same on the inside of the bottom(for contrast) or near the lash line whichever you prefer.  Then use black mascara on top and bottom (i use maybeline collasal) and WALA!   :D|`|T18Z2sGRaa	Just so you know, the pigment of this persons face has been airbrushed smooth.     She has a dark blue on the top layer, purple at the bottom. Black liner thick above the eye and also IN the upper and lower eye lid. Black mascara.     Hope that helps.|`|sGmMbLLoaa	well, that is mainly eyeliner...you take black eyeliner and put it on the inner bottom, and inner and outer top of your eye lid...then you find those pinks/blues/purples that are on her eye in eyeshadow, and with a very thin shadow brush you smudge on heavily really close to ur eye, don't be afraid to let the colors touch each other.  In the corner of the eye you do the same thing.((:|`|AA11514103	you can use eyeliner but be careful eye liner's can give you eye infections  make sure you get colors that show up well on you skin tone go  the best thing to do is go bright  i do the make up is pretty|`|Y1dhkvsnaa	Oh thats reaal cute, but it depends on your skin type.

3DDgXmXVaa	Well, one thing about getting that "emo" look is dark eyes I believe.  If you really want good help, just go to a cosmetic store and ask for help. If u dont want to, ill try my best to help:    First of all blush is amazing! most women are afraid of it though cause its kinda tricky to put on. Finding your color depends on your skin tone. Just dab some on a brush and stroke it back towards the ears in that direction.    If you're new to makeup, I would firs go with pencil eyeliners. Theyre easier than liquid or brush on. Just apply some to your waterline(the inside line of your lower lid where its kinda watery) and even a little under your bottom lashes. For mascara, just brush one or two coats on, try to wipe the brush off first so it doesnt get too clumpy on your eyes. A thing I like to do is get a lash comb and comb the lashes after application so it isnt clumpy looking.    a Wedge is a wedge shaped sponge that you use for applying liquid foundation to your face.    A big powder brush is for foundation. There are many different sizes of eye brushes for eyeshadow. Angle brushes are for powder eyeliners. Blush brush-for blush. Concealer brush, for packing on concealer over blemish areas.    You have to know how to properly apply makeup so it looks natural, not like you got beat up! Dont go above the crease of your lid with the color. Just gently brush it outward. MAC has phenomenal eye colors. You can really try anything. I use a lot of CoverGirl.  Hope this helps!|`|H2TvQ80Aaa	aww sweetie ok here ill teach you everything!     ok eyeshadow: is a powder or cream or loose powder comes in all those forms is what you put in your eye lid all the way up to your eye crease(thats where your eyelid stop and your brow bone begins)  mascara: that is what you put on your eyelashes  Eyeliner: you line the inner rims of your eyes with this also the outer put just very thin ontop   a wedge: is like a spongy little thing you put foundation on with     Tip dont put the black on alot especially on the bottom then you will look like a racoon k     hope i helped :)  Crissie|`|kV5IRgpfaa	Blush is for your cheeks to give them a nice glow, but if your emo, that's not the look you will want to be going for. By "black powder" I assume you mean eyeshadow. Apply some very close to your eye lashes, then get a small eyeshadow brush (the tip will be about 1/2" wide), and blend the eyeshadow upward to get smokey eyes instead of the "I just got beat up look". Emo people use lots of black eyeliner (liquid is best) and a pale colored compact powder. No lipstick or blush.
0S92MwtJaa	glasses make a guy look smarter   therefore more outgoing   :)'|`|G4wDlSh7aa	just depends on the guy.  i think guys with glasses are hot.  :D|`|sK9kDAtLaa	sexy. more outgoing|`|VN8kBnuRaa	Well I have only dated one man who wore glasses, and actually i am dating him now.  Honestly, its hard me to to judge someone by glasses, but I do believe they have a more less outgoing look, but don't worry.  They are only glasses. They DON'T define who you are.|`|sZhTwzh4aa	i've always liked glasses...it doesn't make you look more or less outgoing, per se, but it does give your face something..else. it looks really cool. =)|`|f6A6UM2taa	honeslty i dont think glasses would make anyone look more outgoing. if ur outgoing ur outgoing not matter what ya wearing!|`|x6PNkSxbaa	i think they look more cute but then again it depends on the guy|`|9D3i9s5eaa	depends|`|v3v3TH3Aaa	i think look less outgoing  but i also think glasses on guys are really cute  haha|`|3jUHw9yWaa	Neither.

I don't think they can make you look more or less outgoing... maybe smarter.|`|2QS8j9aOaa	it depends if he's wearing the glasses when hes going out. Or if he's too afraid to wear them and is staying in. Just kidding. A guy who looks intelligent can look sexy. Its how you feel and how you feel in them, if you have confidence it shows and you feel good and that shows on the outside too.|`|Svrbzx8Xaa	i think it depends on the guy like everyone else said  but it also depends on what the glasses look like   because some make people look less outgoing and others dont  imo|`|VVJyaQdCaa	more outgoing!|`|Kjee66zMaa	it depends on the guy i guess|`|yzVi3JaZaa	Ummmm...they dont do much for me, I doesnt make them look outgoing or less outgoing, I dont usually pay much notice :P|`|30GBdziuaa	*thinks*  idk... most guys i know wear contacts...    i guess it makes them look less outgoing|`|vrHwx5dsaa	sometime more sexy.  depends on the guy and the glasses|`|AA11315390	i think glasses have anything to with that..it depends on the guy|`|IwTsime2aa	It depends on how they look but really i like glasses and contacts|`|WJIFvW7uaa	To me glasses don't make the man.|`|2fzjIuTIaa	it depends in how he looks, i actually havent seen a gut wear glasses in a while in my school they all went to contcts...so i really dnt kno.|`|gFovKKQlaa	sexy   hot  handsome  rich  outgoing  anything sexy    and it also depends how the guy looks   fat?  short?  big head?|`|uuB06LSuaa	depends|`|tvTVbZLGaa	what difference does it make? the loser party people make fun of the geeks yet they now make it a trend to wear glasses even when they dont need them because it "looks cool." so in the end, it doesnt matter, it only matter how YOU specifically look in them, if u look like a total idiot, then just dont wear them. it easy, just look in the mirror buddy...|`|AA10927793	depends on the glasses and the guy|`|HE3xA5rRaa	It really depends on the type of glasses, who's the designer. Some glasses displays sexiness, some projects intellectual, then other send a signal or geek. So you have to try them out yourself or simply post a pic of you in the glasses..lol|`|Uz6WWLqMaa	depends on the guy & the glasses.  but most often less outgoing. with glasses it's hard to see a guys eyes so it looks like their cowering behind them.
WaYhJC8Taa	try dark eyeshadows. grey or charcol with black eyelinner. just layer your eyeshadows to get the smokey look.
sVtiLg6Eaa	Yes,they are jealous. Not all of them of course,just the sad "little" pathetic ones. I am tall too and for years I felt bad sitting up straight in a movie theater at the risk of blocking the people from behind me. I've actually heard people mumble behind me that they wouldn't have a good view of the screen because of my height. Mind you these are people that came in AFTER me and had plenty of choices of seats. That was the day I sat up completely straight because of that mumbling. They moved and I was happy.  At the recent (well a couple of months ago) lighting of the Christmas tree in Rockefeller Center,someone actually pulled on the back of my jacket by the neck because I was too tall for them!  Oh,and if they every ask "How's the weather up there?"  Simply say "It's raining"    and    spit!    lol    P.S. The link is to the video "Short People" Give it a listen if you haven't heard it.|`|O0S189PQaa	yea cuz tall people ownnnn    actually i wish i was shorter=[  [maybe]]|`|C8zrNMRjaa	i dont think people do that. most people who are too tall or too short wish they were just average height.|`|ZoJqQD9zaa	yes i hate it when short people do that  they are just jealous b/c they just wish they were tall    tall people are beautiful   thats why you have to be tall to be a model|`|hOVzviFIaa	ughhh, people make fun of others to make them upset and when you get upset you are giving them what they want.   Everyone wants to be different than what they are, but you just can't you were born the way you were, so accept it|`|Ps5rsLyeaa	That does not happen to me oddly... =(  I get people hiding behind me when other people try to chase them but that is pretty much it... I am only 5'8 but most of the people in my class are short... though the boys are pretty average if not taller than me... anyways when those people make those comments to you... i think you should ignore them... because taller people really do have alot of advantages .... they can be models which shorter people cannot ... and you get alot of compliments too because people think its a beautiful height. And short people also are beautiful too height should not define a person.|`|ajeMVARraa	Fat people do it to skinny people, and think that because they're fat that it's not rude. The same with short people. But if the turn it around and you make fun of them for being fat or short, it's like, the sin of sins... I usually tell the fat person that. I'm just like, "You may not think it's a problem, but imagine if I made the same comments to you about your weight. So shut up."|`|ZAixkOhsaa	omg i hate that! i so wanna be short :( im dating a guy 3 years older than me and hes only an inch taller than me i hate it its sooo embarasing. i dont like being all tall and clunky i wanna be short and petite lol|`|Anh2pwceaa	I agree i noticed that too and it makes me feel kinda bad :(|`|rcV7Cmq8aa	hah no way. thy r short n dont wanna let feel the same by others so just for their ownself. ok so let thm enjoy lol|`|vtOnGsQQaa	I never heard of anything like that in my life..|`|W9wAVpg1aa	SAME! ugh its so annoying, im only 14 so im still growing but im already 5'8" and i love it, its so much better than being short, just remember, short people get fatter faster:)|`|39wcLSoPaa	well i'm a short person,but i don't make fun of tall people. In fact there is a tall girl in my class everyone calls her dinosaur i stick up for her even though she starts some rumors about me. It's all about forgiveness. I can see how that bugs you though.|`|LM4vwHEyaa	i agree 100%!  people should feel comfortable with whatever they were given.  for example, i am 5'2 and i love my height b/c i think it suits my personality and body type. im quite skinny, and short and i love it!  but i also love tall people, so i don't understand why people don't accept what they have and move on, b/c it's not like you can change it.|`|eHflURByaa	I'm the same but with fat people making fun of skinny people
aba0oAKwaa	i don't live there but here is a way to find good hair people.  Dominican hair salons help allot my mom who is african american has been going to one they don't use that many products and her hair is long silky and smooth.  She doesn't get perms any more and her african american hair looks the best in maryland.  Type in  Dominican hairdresser in Birmingham AL on google and you are sure to find a good salon
dDQLlVF3aa	hey the chick that gave you a snide remark is rude. I'm 5'3 and I modeled in magazines and for local talent scouts for many years until I got pregnant and had a kid. It has nothing to do with height unless you want to model clothing for a designer on a runway somewhere. Find a local talent scout and hire a photographer. Take at lease 20-30 head shot and full body shots, then schedule an appointment with the talent agency and there you go, you've made your first move. remember it takes patience, not everyone will make it. And with the attitude of SOME PEOPLE, they'll never make it either. Just try that's all you can do!|`|Anh2pwceaa	get taller|`|fVurmB5yaa	5'6 is too short....hopefully you'll grow more  remember to eat your veggtables!!!|`|1nV16XyTaa	you need to apply to an angencie.    But make sure its all safe.  Any angency that asks you to pay is always either unsafe or a rip off,never pay them.    Look out for any model scouting competions happening in your area and go to them.  Or fashion shows.    Look in magazines as they may have angencys in there :)    hope i helped        EDIT: also the person above me is talkin crap.Even people with disabilities can model now and height isnt such an issue as the modeling worlds changing alot and there looking for different,not just skinny and tall.|`|VGhmc0dOaa	1) are you 5'9" or taller?  2) are you super slim with long legs and a shapely striking figure?  3) would you still look absolutely amazing in a horrible dress?  4) does every single person you meet tell you you're gorgeous?  5) do you find people staring at you in the street because you're so unusually amazingly pretty?    If the answer is no to any of them, then no you couldn't model.  You can't just be tall, pretty, and slim to be a model. Think about how many tall, slim, pretty girls there are in the world. It takes a lot more to be a model. You need to be unusual and quirky looking. You need to be versatile and have an expressive face. You're face needs to be perfectly symmetrical and your features all need to be perfect and in proportion. Your figure needs to be very striking and you need to be able to look good in ANYTHING (even a binbag). The primary purpose of models is to sell things, so absolutely everything and anything needs to look good on them, otherwise you can't get signed. so think carefully and if you think you tick all the boxes then go ahead and do it. But modeling is a tough industry and the chances of you actually becoming a model are against you.    Edit: by the way you say you don't want to be a runway model BUT you cannot just pick and choose. Any good agency wants a girl who can do everything. If you want to make a full time successful career out of modeling you cannot just be able to do one type of modeling.|`|eaUxXaYqaa	grow taller. I'm tall; 5"10 , skinny, people call me naturally beautiful, gorgeous with makeup and 15. do the math on who's going to become a model first.ME or you. you have to be taller.|`|5dDNqwlzaa	Well, you're still very young.  Your height so far is very good, but you're too young to tell if you are going to grow any taller.      I would either look into a local agency, you are still very young...  Call around and make some appointments.      If nothing happens, wait a couple more years.  If you grow a couple more inches that you're in great shape and I would call some local agencies again...  You don't want to put too much time or effort into modeling right now.  It's very competitive and you will waste a ton of money.  Just stick to local agencies-- Start off small and grow bigger-- any larger agency is usually located in a major city in which you would have to travel at expenses you have to pay.    Good Luck!
wJ45gsyZaa	no no no no no no no no.  I definitely would not recommend that!! when starting your dreads you want your hair to be totally clean, with no product at all. after your finished a dread, put a bit of dread wax or dreadlock gel on it. And you know your dreads are going to stick out for the first while right? Ideally, I'd say wait 'til your hair's a bit longer, but I understand the itch for dreads, they're pretty rad.  Happy dreading!
yWRTrnR2aa	The hair that grows out will be your natural hair color.|`|bBqPja7eaa	Hahahaha, it wouldn't grow out the bleach or blond color, which I think you're already a blond.|`|2f05f1797218d6d460cdf8e06af0c251aa	it grows back you natural color and texture no matter what you do to your hair|`|rcV7Cmq8aa	new colour|`|8ubEisCpaa	i know for sure if u bleach it ur natural hair color will come out and its not too pretty l0l thats what going on with me rite now but i cut it and im trying to to grow the bleachout that i have underneath...and im not too sure about ur eybrows i think they;ll also b ur natural|`|fPT1MI1Uaa	It will go back to your natural colour cause i have had it done before and i have had it for nearly a year and its starting to come out!
JUkzrgVWaa	I'm not sure if I'd encourage you to trust someone who returns a direct answer to this type of question.   I've always made it a point to never tell my daughters they are "pretty" or "beautiful"; instead, I've always said "Your hair looks great" or "that outfit looks nice on you". If they had a disfiguring accident tomorrow, I would not want them to think they are any less valuable to the world around them because they don't fit within some superficial mold of "beauty". I want them to know their appearance is only one component of who they are, and not what is truly valuable about their lives. I never, ever tell them they are pretty. I completely understand how important their appearance is to them, but I believe they now know the pursuit of physical beauty is, while a natural occurrence of growing up, not really "up there" on the scale of things which are really important. And, as with so many people in our particular society, it only gives you a false sense of security, and people ultimately don't cherish it. I see so many people searching desperately for real relationships in their lives, not relationships built on conditional settings.  Good luck!|`|AGaT3BDMaa	2nd by far!|`|zdMlBTATaa	second|`|qqR0Pua5aa	why would you compete with your sister? thats mean.|`|QdXvBOL7aa	they both look exactly the same. except one looks older, and the other looks younger. i think youth is prettier.|`|VSzF36Ywaa	They're the same person?  2nd.|`|jKA8SovQaa	it doesn't matter who's prettier  everyone has a pretty qauilty ;D.  i think their both pretty and not ugly.  i wish people would think before asking  a question that is obvious       :D|`|eaUxXaYqaa	second one fer sure|`|AZbsr92raa	the first one|`|LkMeHaWsaa	first because its better quality|`|aZBeF0xtaa	deff the 1st she has better hair they both look about the same tho if u ask me ! both very pretty
ijeninncaa	Tie it up in a really high ponytail and just cut the end off in a staight line about 2 inches down. It gets rid of the split ends but at the same time layers it slightly.  x|`|R8yKGv18aa	You can fix it to a point but you'd be better off just cutting it and being more careful next time.    Try infusium 23 it works great. Also mane and tail.|`|catdkhW1aa	You have to cut it but just cut the ends and don't go excessive on shampoo and hair Appliances. Also, hake care of your hair and use conditioner You can always grow it back.
sWvDZZ6Aaa	you could try to get like a brown rinse on it|`|Tpxxlx6haa	No, Just Put Your Hair Up In A Pony Tail. Until Your Hair Is As Long As Your Shoulder, Then It Will be back To Its Normal colour.|`|SLSX6QQsaa	I did this, and I just went to Sally's beauty supply, picked out a dye one shade darker than my own but with a NEUTRAL base, then dyed my hair at home.  By using a neutral base you are allowing the colors to blend better. Get a permanent dye. Also, get one shade darker because its going to fade out of the lighter hair.  Adding color TO your hair generally isn't damaging, its lightening that damages it.  So pick out something gentle, but permanent. The employees there will help you.  You could also use a rinse but unfortunately this is going to be a lot of upkeep and will turn your pillow colors.
TrA0pwIraa	hey hun, i currently am going back and forth between 2 concealers right now and they are both amazing. i have to wake up at 6am for work (and i am not a morning person) and i always have the darkest bags under my eyes but with either of there products i find that they seem to disapear....    firstly there is maybellines mineral power concealer     and my other favorite is benefits erase paste    they are both really great at making you look like you just woke up from the best sleep of your life hehe!! hope this helped|`|elifTnkkaa	M.A.C !!      http://www.maccosmetics.com/product/spp....    its is only about $15 and it is very very good!!|`|A7ovwP94aa	Here are some concealers that have had good reviews for hiding eye bags and shadows. Buy a shade lighter than your skin tone.

BTW- dont use MAC. it looks really bad! (personal experience)|`|uR5aNpHGaa	mac is usually good  but when you apply it you should put a little on the top of your hand and rub it around a little  itll make it less goey and itll look more natural  then take your finger tip and softly dab it under your eye  thats the best way to use it

(Plus, models have to be at least 5'8)|`|kIGOGKXYaa	Sorry to tell you this but height DOES matter. That's just the way it is, in the modeling world they are going to sugar coat it for you. Agencies want girls who are versatile meaning they can do print and runway. And in order to do runway you have to be atleast 5'10".   You can still be a model, you are just going to have to try harder than most girls who are the appropriate height for runway.  Don't give up if that's what you want to do. It's just going to take a lot of faith in yourself. And knowing that you know you have what it takes.  Good luck!  |`|BboRJcX5aa	you loook sooo pretty. but from that close up you look alittle chunky. but i still think your really pretty :)|`|hHCdXq0Naa	You're exceptionally pretty, and have beautiful coloring:) ...  Actually, I'm also 5'4" and worked for several years as a model for PETITE clothing!  I also did photo work, especially for small cars (they don't look as small when a shorter model is used).   You might not have as much work, and it won't be "high fashion", but there's definitely a market for shorter models|`|AGaT3BDMaa	Yeah.. You are really pretty. but wayyy to short and ur face is round. Mayeb liek cataloge or something|`|Q5FYrU9vaa	hmm i think you can btw i love the multicolors in your eyes. very pretty|`|RLK401pgaa	why would i care what kind of camera you have??    i think you could be a model in magazines, but your too short. maybe you'll get taller...|`|ZoJqQD9zaa	5'4-----thats not gonna work out in the modeling world  and even if you were taller i dont think so  sorry hun|`|q5TchS9jaa	No|`|y3F4dfEmaa	you can not tell  anything by those pictures|`|Anh2pwceaa	your real pretty but you're too short sorry :(|`|AC525SR3aa	Your a little short, but you have a beautiful face.|`|9lXivaJMaa	I think your beautiful and you have gorgeous blue eyes that stand out really well  But modeling agencies are VICIOUS and they'll probably scrutinize you for being 5'4|`|rXInAcURaa	sorry but no.    your a very pretty girl, but you would have to grow another 5 inches, you have to have a skinny, lanky build.|`|aD7PaNs5aa	if you wanna model, don't give up! it's fun to dream. good luck!|`|hwHJ1vzCaa	You don't have to be tall to be a model.

VHtY62Jcaa	Put a thick layer of Vaseline on your lips. Leave it on for 15 minutes while you let an toothbrush (that you don't plan on using again) soak in hot water. After the 15 minutes are up use the tooth brush to scrub off the Vaseline in a circular motion. You lips may feel weird when you done just put a little more Vaseline on them. :)|`|yXGlmUqlaa	i don't know. i put vaseline on my lips every night before bed and i barely every have to apply chapstick during the day, only once in a while in the winter. i never have cracked or dried lips. maybe you're putting too many different products on them? just try one at a time.    maybe blistex?|`|bT9SXnYQaa	Worser is not a word.    Don't lick your lips  try drinking a lot of water  or  go to a dermatologist.|`|2Urd6VLqaa	Try exfoliating them.  Just apply a generous amount of vaseline on them, and then scrubbing with a toothbrush (obviously not one you brush your teeth with!)|`|qsETZIEIaa	i would try Burt's bees. moisturizer and chap stick it works wonder on skin and works really well. I also recently read that a mixture on plain honey and some salt in the honey exfoliates skin really well, so try that.|`|QuokZhuqaa	Well you can start exfoliate them using a toothbrush after you coated you lips with olive oil and sugar or Vaseline and sugar but you always need to exfoliate first then moisturize    (:|`|WZBB5QURaa	don't lick you're lips at all, that just makes it worse  drink lots of water  keep applying something to your lips  and if that still doesn't work, then go see  a dermatologist and they will give you something  special just for you, that you can use|`|440bc9fc52f071a2327870a6bd744e8faa	DO NOT PUT VASELINE ON YOUR LIPS-  studies and research has shown that though vaseline does help cure chapped lips temporarily, in the long run, it actually makes them even worse. So does Burt's Bees. I would recommend Carmex, but new studies show links to cancer.    Try This-   For the next couple of days, every morning, wake up and brush your lips. Yes, your lips. Lip Smackers has this Liquid lipgloss in watermelon- buy it and apply it to your lips RIGHT AFTER brushing them. The lipgloss has  Vitamin E and Aloe which will moisturize your lips. Avoid licking your lips. Drink plenty of water. Eat more fish- You dont know it, but it does have a little to do with what you eat. Try eating less fats. You may reapply the lipgloss, but just dont go crazy :D    Good Luck!
QGU7JAIUaa	Most definitely M.A.C products are worth the price. A good lipstick that suits all skin tones is the glaze lipstick in hue and a good blush is the blush cream in lilicent. The other M.A.C products which are a must have are:    Cream colour base in fawntastic  Prep + prime foundation primer  Pigment in vanilla  Strobe liquid  Studio finish concealer    (: x|`|0mAeM1zGaa	I personally think that they are; I own MAC studio fix foundation, MAC bronzer, two eyeshadow and a brown kohl eyeliner. So I have used a wide variety of their products and I have been very happy with them.  I am also really considering buying their concealer and eye paint primer, even though they have high prices I do believe their products are worth it.|`|x88DfLokaa	yeah i use to use the compact all the time.. but i had to stop because i started to break out alot.. because the makeups so thick,. but i love mac and i still use it from time to time but only when im going out. and i know im gonna be out for awhile.. like  party or a wedding or something .. not just every day use.. helps me from breaking out.|`|koA4n8Tzaa	i absolutley love MAC products. They work sooo well!      answer my youtube one please someone|`|BvjPU3wkaa	MAC products are generally pretty good.  However, like any other brand, not everything that they make is fantastic.  Their eyeshadows would be their best product.  The quality, colour and finish selection is outstanding.  They really do powders well.  So the blushes are also fantastic.    Just stay away from the mascaras and you should be good.|`|Br3k7Hagaa	I asked this question too. I think that they will be worth it because of many good reviews, im definatly buying some :)    Check reviews on youtube :)|`|0a115b3a813d3ea64d4f07d95c126639aa	MAC is amazinggggg.  I have a full on collection of their products and love them so much.    Their pigments are to die for.|`|skWN7jWHaa	definitely worth it|`|Yt5H5x58aa	MAC products are usually very good and last a long time,   but they're DEAD expenisve... i wood try another brand, maybe GOSH ? not as expensive, but if your willing to pay for them.. then i gues they're good|`|DTh1rgoqaa	Yes they are, well a lady on youtube uses them and she is a professional make-up artist and she loves the products.  But you should probably try and get a tester before buying, because it's not the same for everyone.|`|sUH902cDaa	I regularly use their bronzer and it is definitely worth the money because it lasts for like 3 months so a lot longer than other products and it comes out great on the skin; so your getting better quality and longer use-really worth it!! Also there lip glosses are great colours and i've got a pink one which i use nearly every weekend and i've had it since september and its still going strong!! people always compliment it too!! xx hope this helps!|`|EShN5zNcaa	MAC products are definitely worth the money. I LOVE their eye products and they have beautiful colors that make up artists use that go well together. There was a video on youtube(sorry, I can't find it anymore!) with a girl using all MAC makeup, and hers looked gorgeous. You really should get it, because it is really worth it.   Hope I helped!|`|MfuUAcNwaa	So worth it.But there eye shadows are the best ever and lip colors.Try there eye shadows there the best.And if you spend 50$ they will do your make for free!!!!|`|K7jq0hkSaa	MAC makeup is incredible! I have the little studio finish concealer and the same foundation as you! :) I would DEFINITELY recommend the powder, I don't actually have it but the lady in the shop used it on me and it was awesome :) I have loads of the lip-glasses as well (i'd recommend them as well! they last soooo long and are miles better than any brand you find in boots or superdrug!) Haha, I could talk for days about how brilliant it is! Yeah, it's expensive but I would say it was totally worth it. ALSO! The eyelash curlers are amaaaaazing! But they were 12, which I thought was a little too much.    Anyway! I went majorly off topic there. I'd get all the products you fancy if I were you :) Like other people have said they last ages. I'd definitely get the studio finish concealer (it was about 9 in debenhams)    I hope this helps! I'm pretty much a MAC addict!

Kv1SKUuEaa	So here is how you make it all go away  Go to Walmart, in the hair removal section, near the Nair -- you will find something called Bikini Zone.  It comes in a tube gel and pads.  Get the pads, wipe the affected areas -- no more pain, swelling, or itching.    Also for those of you who are brave enough to attempt waxing, get something called  NO SCREAM CREAM.  Put it on 30 minutes before your appointment and life is much easier to deal with.  (It's still going to hurt but not like usual, more like waxing your eyebrows instead of the girliest of all places.)|`|QaVerTAfaa	nope, normal. the first time i got one done i had to ice down there for at least 4 days.|`|Ps5rsLyeaa	woww... never going to get that done... =(  and maybe you are sensitive because the person who did the wax for you.. probably knew what she was doing and was experienced... but you never know.. give it a couple more days and if you are still in pain you should go to your doctor but that is a very sensitive area and the pain might be normal especially getting a wax .|`|AC525SR3aa	omg does it really hurt that much?!?!?! I'm scared now.|`|OQS1k0mYaa	everyones tolerance for it is different, when i got it done it didn't bother me at all.for others it can feel like pulling teeth!!   don't  be put off from it though,sometimes it can be down to the beautician that does it aswell,some of them out there can be butchers check around amongst your friends and find out who they use and go to there salons.Experience is the best teacher lol
xhjSPd0uaa	ive got all three of those, in lots of colours! and many more lol im abit obsessed with lip plumpers!    the best by FARRR is TooFaced Lip Injection, i always have this lipgloss i couldnt be without it, it makes such a dramatic difference to my lips.    (i buy it off ebay as its alot cheaper too!!)|`|HY5K4Yrraa	Hey. Well i love the soap and glory one i really think it works well. Also lip plump by benefit is good and you can get from debanams :) good luck :)|`|VHtY62Jcaa	I hear good things about Soap & Glory's lip plumper.  Their products are always good, so I don't see why the plumper would be different.|`|OYLrMZTKaa	Victoria secret and Sally Hansen has good plumpers.|`|WaelOS0Taa	I know!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Go on the superdrugs website or any large superdrugs store and look at the playboy cosmetics range  They have one which is sooooooooooo perfect its freaky!  Its heaven in a tube!  You so have to buy it!|`|sdPA5vg4aa	Too faced lip injection is the best out of those. I also really like a lip plumper from Bath and Body Works, I've forgotten the name but it is so good! It makes my lips feel drunk it tingles so much and does plump.|`|rwqhx24jaa	soap and glory  but its your choice because its whatever looks best on you   x|`|as9RDbJaaa	Sally Hansen Lip Inflation  or  TooFaced Lip Injection    I would recommend Too Faced because,   it makes your lips red and puffy, not plumped.  Also, it feels like red ants running across your lips.  Not a good thing!  But, if you like the tingle TooFaced will work for ya!  But, I have tried, liked, and have heard good reviews   about the Sally Hansen Lip Inflation lip gloss.  Plus, they have awsome shades and colors.|`|qyT15nmXaa	The only one I've tried is soap and glory. It's great for plumping and it makes my lips HUUUGE! The only problem is that it's very sticky. It's good for plumping though.     x
oOfD9HFBaa	no. you only feel some pressure when they pull off the brackets.    its actually a relief to get them off  but your teeth feel really slimey and thin at first  and your gums feel weird  it takes a little while to get used to  but its nice to not have food getting stuck in your teeth :)|`|wQpdot1Raa	Not really, there just feels like loads of pressure for a few seconds then the dentist snaps the bracket off. Its nothing compared to getting them put on in the first place.|`|U9EwARTKaa	yeah dont worry. if you've ever broken a bracket before you know that u can hardly feel it. but i found when i came back to get my retainer it hurt because my teeth had started to seperate from the time they made a retainer for me and from when i picked it up. you'll lick your teeth a lot after you get them takin off|`|MoONItFMaa	it doesn't hurt but it feels really weird and tastes awful and idk at some points it felt like they pulled a tooth out not because of pain but just cuz i was so used to having the bracket on my tooth that it felt like they took away part of my tooth but yeah the worst part is deff the taste and after words ur teeth feel weird and kinda naked but u get used to it|`|PniClUZtaa	no it doesnt ur gunna need to wear a retainer though  OH and let me tell ya  ur gums feel FUNNY they feel all big and weird but they arent|`|CluOhrXWaa	nah it wont hurt a little uncomfy when they take them of but nothing painful goodluck :)|`|gyxMDNpkaa	it doenst hurt but it feels wierd and the process is annoying  and it feels wierd for a couple of hours because your teeth feel huge and slimy.|`|pzIESgGLaa	It doesn't hurt at all!  I remember when my braces were removed, all the orthodontist does is cracks it off with some metal tools. All you feel is a little pressure. Congratulations on getting you're braces off!  Glad I could help! =D|`|Zo9zcNTpaa	no...you may feel a lil different...actually a relief. You are going to love it....not worrying about what you can't eat and stuff getting stuck in them.|`|FwmgQhD3aa	I still have my braces on, but my brother had them, and he said it doesn't hurt. They just rip them off, but it doesn't hurt (He said that so I'm not sure if it really does or not.) He also said it might sound loud and all, but it won't hurt.|`|YR57a1rKaa	hmm... kinda, its not like the most painful thing ever but its not a walk in the park. my teeth were a Little sore for about a day after, but it is sooo worth it.. haha my favorite part it when you lick your teeth and there are slimy|`|vQ9Y2JUWaa	not at all .they take braces off at no time.  and after that it feels so good|`|ae24FseFaa	for me it kind of did since they have to scrap the cement off, but no not that much:)|`|nuscJ92iaa	it doesn't even hurt a lot  might it might hurt a little depending on your braces|`|L6b2BFG8aa	It hurt me only because they had to scrape off all the glue. That was 6 years ago through so maybe they have improved their technique a bit!|`|tv7a1ixiaa	It doesn't hurt, it's just uncomfortable!  And also it will feel weird to have all your teeth in place, but hey, it's SO worth it!  Congrats and good luck!|`|qWc7gsR8aa	if i remember correctly HUGE relief...it shouldn't hurt when they actually take them off, they don't just rip them off, they like melt the glue or somethin and just pop em' off. When they're actually off, it'll just feel different cuz ur not used to it, and ur teeth will be really slippery! (the point is it won't be excruciatingly painful)|`|S7VJ1GDdaa	You will feel really funny after the braces get taken off, but unlike the others who answered your question, I will be truthful. They have to use a grinder to take off the cement (glue) that was holding the brackets on. I have very sensitive teeth, and it felt like I was biting into tin foil the entire time. Other than that, the retainer is a breeze compared to the braces. I would take some tylenol or advil, etc... to relieve the pain from the grinder. Good Luck|`|AA12066742	No way. If you are sensitive ask the dentist to numb  your gums before taking off the wires. He can put a soothing gel on your gums that help prevent pain. He can also give you some Novocain if your extra sensitive.   I am afraid of the  dentist so I know how  you feel. I had to have a tooth pulled and believe me I dreaded going. My dentists put that brown syrupy gel on my teeth first and then applied two shots of Novocaine. I didn't feel a thing. There was no pain before getting the shots.|`|eaUxXaYqaa	not at all hun , all they do is twist off the bracket and then with a sander thingie , they sand all the glue off your teeth but in between sanding pauses take a deep breath because it smells when the dust gets in your nose and then you cant breathe. for your retainer , you'll have a lot of spit in your mouth because your mouth thinks that you eating but that will disappear in like 3 days and you talk with a lisp but my lisp was gone in about a week. hope I helped : )|`|tSlcfCI3aa	actually it doesn't  but your mouth will feel a bit odd  also if you didn't brush very well during the braces process,  you will end up with embarrassing spots on your teeth  i would recommend getting your teeth whitened about a week later|`|ZA11WBR2aa	Not really, it actually feels great when they are off.|`|AA10343094	it feels funny, like a pop. it doesn't hurt. i promise. sounds funny, yes, but does not hurt. you can't choose best answer in a month, you have five days to do it, max.|`|ckdYl9Znaa	it doesnt hurt it just feels like you have a lot of room in your mouth for the first day or so... and your teeth feel really smooth...    it will be voted on by then... so you would have to choose best answer before that...|`|m3iPgBWFaa	IDK GIRL IM GETTIN MINE OFF FEB. 6 I WILL TELL YOU THEN!!|`|6rl0tQnBaa	not at all.. they just twist the bracket off. nothing comes in contact with nerves that will cause any pain so youre safe ;)|`|EkZDP3Oyaa	Um, it's kind of uncomfortable but not really that painful.  It's kind of like it just leaves you sore and the process of getting used to your retainer and starting to wear it only at night can sometimes hurt but it's still just that sore feeling.  They have to remove all the glue from your teeth which they do by using one of those little tools that grinds it off, that can hurt on a sensitive tooth but all you have to do is raise your hand and they will back off.|`|AChxe6ltaa	not at all.. they just twist the bracket off. nothing comes in contact with nerves that will cause any pain so youre safe ;)|`|1RzQ3lK8aa	Takes a while to adjust....|`|UbXVjcm7aa	No it doesn't hurt at all. I was sooo excited to get mine off! The worst part is that nasty hardened glue thats been stuck to your teeth for 2-3 yrs falling in your mouth eww!|`|FNkE6UEWaa	No, I didn't even know they had taken them off already until they told me.
vJIqP6iIaa	the tattoo i designed for myself at age 15, i still like and i plan on getting in my twenties if i still like it.   its vines with crows and tints of purple. gorgeous, plan on getting it on my hip.   maybe you should use condensed vines with some bird you love, or some sport or hobby you enjoy, be creative, look at surrealism so you can get ideas.   Maybe you should put yours on your lower stomach, hip bones and if its awesome and long, why not deal with the pain of a rib tattoo?   good luck! and don't go to the beach with your parents...|`|nDQOwAA3aa	get a kiwi bird or wait is that australia or new zeland|`|Dc8ZVP6yaa	I would suggest a rose with vines. on your shoulder.   wear t-shits all the time lol :D|`|wwFEYeFPaa	ok well it seems like ur doing alot of thinkin so just be sure u really want this cuz as for myself i think tats are sooo cool & I've been with a few of my friends gettin em done & they always try to talk me into gettin one but no negative not for me!..I don't like the whole idea of it being there forever & then my kids later seeing it.. but on the flipside they are still really cool to look at just not for me..But yeah I think a really nice place to get a tat is on ur lower back to the left of right side, its not a tramp stamp its sexy & ur parents won't see it..Whatever u do dont get ur name ( my friend so regrets that one!..lol) ask the artist maybe he has some of his own with ur parents nationality thats a really cool idea cuz its meaningful..if ur into the zodiac ur sign is always real cute..my friend actually got a real neat one for her pisces sign its niice..if not maybe u & ur cousins all have something in common that u can all put meaning something..for instance 5 female cousins of mine each got a pink flamingo on there upper back when my grandmother passed away. We're hispanic & a famlingo in spanish means her  last name "garza" so its really cute & meaningful.
KSMU64ssaa	She wears a lot of the time eyeliner that's just winged out a little bit, mascara. A natural looking eyeshadow (like shroom from MAC) would look good with the liner. For her face, a good matte foundation, a little bronzer for contouring, and lip gloss. Go easy on everything. Her look is very natural and sweet.|`|iKK89z2Eaa	black eye liner, brown eye shadow, black mascara, bronzer just the basics! mmaybe try bringing a picture to someone such as a worker in macys or nordstroms! good luck!|`|1keH3R6paa	Use mark. products.

i4ceTwqLaa	important to use a concealer more than a foundation. The idea is to look flawless without looking like you've put 10 inches of cake icing on your face. I've had skin problems for years, and have gotten pretty good at this. Here's my tips:    First and MOST IMPORTANT: makeup will only look good on a smooth surface. You MUST wash and exfoliate your skin really well. Remove all debris and dried skin flakes. I find a wet face cloth is really all you need to exfoliate the face - just wait until you've been in the shower a few minutes for the moisture to set in.     You MAY pop pimples/blackheads ONLY if they are ready to come out. And only as much as necessary. Masaccering your face is not the idea here.    Then:    I use a thick concealer (lipstick form, not tube with the liquid stuff) a shade lighter than my skin. Dab finely onto the pimples and dab with clean fingertip until ALMOST blended. it's okay if your face has minor polka dots when you're done. I also use concealer on areas (like my nose) where the pores are rather deep or large and smooth a bit over to provide a better surface for the foundation.     Next: Use foundation FIRST over the blemishes. Ensure its blended finely around the edges.     Then, use very light foundation on the "good" areas of your face. This way, the natural good skin will give the illusion that your face is less pimple prone than it is....and will give your make up a much more natural look.    You can finish with a power (I ONLY use over blemishes where I really need the makeup to set. Otherwise, I find it just camoflouges healthy skin too much and makes it look fake).|`|YgPYv4OPaa	maybelline mineral power .    :]|`|mhyL7Qw3aa	I really like Rimmel London's Stay Matte foundation. It covers all of my blemishes and even my under eye circles. You can buy it at any drug store for only $7.|`|4b045bed7aeb597819a17cafdaf98978aa	Mineral powder is good....I definitely prefer to spend more on Bare Minerals rather than Maybelline (I think it goes on a little too heavy).  If you want an actual foundation, I've always been a fan of Clinique Clarifying (in a green tube).  It's just under $20 a tube, but a little goes a long way.  It also covers blemishes well and even seems to help my skin.|`|Ekra9yrhaa	hi go to youtube and type in panacea81, she is very good and she will tell you all you need to know, also she will give you tour on how to apply make-up. she is very good. you can mail her and she will respond.    hhope this helps|`|LxrsG8ifaa	dermablend|`|v4KSyM8vaa	any foundation from the body shop!!      it gives you a nice natural look but not cakey and it covers every single flaw|`|b9sGbUD2aa	I also had that same problem and i have tried many different foundations. The one i am currently using is called TruBlend from Covergirl, it is a whipped foundation and is very light and has great coverage.  I used to use Origins, but you'd have to go to the mall to get it.  Origins works well too, it is a bit more expensive but i think worth it.  Also im not sure of the exact name but i have used one from Rimmel its in a tube and has a purple cap, that foundation also has great coverage and is very smooth.|`|n0A3eMWCaa	Bare Minerals, Available at Sephora for about 36$.  Covers all flaws, makes your skin look PERFECT.  BUT, it doesnt look cake-y. It looks natural! This girl has a couple reviews on different Mineral Makeups. http://ca.youtube.com/user/secretr0cksta...  I would NOT reccomend trying all the kockoff bare minerals, like.. loreal or mabeline. They are just copying BM, and its not nearly as good.  Foundations is not something to cheap out on, it will last a long time, and you dont want to look cake-y or gross!|`|1UMBIatVaa	If it is true physical beauty you are wanting, First make sure you are keeping you face clean. ( I reccomend PROactive...and if it burns your skin, only use is once a week or month depending on the person) Good foundation is hard to get, butanything cheap is bad for you. Check this out:www.Sephora.com/BareEscentuals   ( remember , only true beauty comes for the heart |`|Dv6VaIixaa	i use covergirl liquid coverup.  it's great  pick your skin color and you should get the continuous wear kind, that doesn't come off easy during the day. also get the multi colored highlighter mineral powder by physicians formula cosmetics. it's good for the skin and it doesn't look cakey.|`|OeAWNUQWaa	Ok, here's the thing, foundation alone cannot help make your face look flawless. You would need a variety of cosmetics, such as primer, foundation, and powder. I suggest smashbox photo finish primer, it's rated one of the best sellers at sephora and the stuff works wonders. The reason for a primer is that it fills in imperfections, get's rid of dry patches and event's out your skin's texture so when you do wear foundation it will look flawless. Also, if you're going to be wearing foundation every day, you might as well not buy foundation but a tinted moisturzier. It's amazing. it's helps cover all the imperfections and blemishes but at the same time moisturizes your skin. I use the one by stila. If you really want to look flawless with or without make up, i suggest following these rules;   1. drink 8 glasses of water  2. eat bright vegetables (10 servings= 1/2 cup)   3. get 8 hours of sleep  4. reduce stress  5. consume high antioxidants such as blueberries (their the best)   6.drink a glass of green day on a regular basis   7.follow a simple skin care plan that you will follow every day. aka 1)cleanse, 2) tone 3) moisturize.   8. once a week, scrub your face, then place boiled water in a pan and add a drop of tea tree oil. move your face toward the pan so that your about 20-30 cm away. Then place a towel over head and steam your face. Then follow with a clay mask from lush cosmetics.   9.have fun and smile more.     I know this a long reply, but i've been trying to achieve a flawless face for years and the best way to do it is to make sure your face is perfect without makeup because you don't want to be wearing it 100% of the time and also, foundations that work on me might not work well on you so it's like a lottery to find one that's perfect.|`|da5a6968d5186a061f4986d5447dab0aaa	I have been using Loreal Mineral Powder.

j9jlf24Qaa	He...I'm not one to answer that, actually. I've lived in three different countries and visited a lot more. Still, from what I gather...  a) They don't have the opportunity to go (money, job, house, school, et cetera).  b) They don't WANT to go. To most kids, the idea of living in New York, for example, is fascinating. To their much more practical, down-to-earth parents, it's complicated, and anyway, why New York? Too much pollution, etc. No, really. It's HARD to go live in another country (and for the kids, like me, losing friends is hard, too).  c) Mmm...Actually I LOVE going to other countries so I can't find a reason why somebody WOULDN'T like to go.|`|Xy4kHpteaa	Many people choose to live in all the countries on the planet.

xoLGXkANaa	you could either just blow dry your hair with a round brush, this could keep it quite straight...or...spray some salt water into your hair, get a spray bottle and put about 2 teaspoons of salt and the rest water, spray into your hair and it will give it a natural beach wave look- but this can also dry your hair out so make sure to condition regularly.    You could also practise some cool up dos for you hair or just a simple pony-tail can look cool if others are so used to you having it down.    Good luck (:|`|82UTLirSaa	try boho waves - there is a how-to on my fashion blog, http://london--rose.blogspot.com ?  it will be easy for you as your hair is already naturally wavy, and is really flattering & fashionable.  to avoid scrunchiness when using mouse, make sure ur hair is damp first. and use as little as possible - a little goes a long way.  try a cute plait across the top to complete the look - also a how-to on this on my fashion blog.  hope ive helped x|`|1o6bzLVbaa	use 3 minute miracle by aussie.  it helps.  and try to get magic straight perm, so you don't have to curl it every day.|`|cEcCWrIcaa	cut the cord off|`|h5xSfcT6aa	you are lucky! you have naturally wavy/curly hair! (like me!). i am also a bit like you - have to fuss around with scrunching it, putting sprays on it and it still looking frizzy!    i do straighten mine ocassionally, but balance it out. i wear it curly some days, and put it up some days, with either waves coming down or i straighten just my fringe.  i ve found that wearing an alice band accentuates my curls and gives it more volume. i also put serum on it to make it look more smooth and less frizzy.  just know that you cant straighten it every day, its not healthy. so try new alternatives and you can still straighten occassionally.    also try using a revitalising shampoo or silky shampoo (for when your hairs curly). you could alternate these to get the benefits of both.    xxx|`|cwsYM2F4aa	Hi there.  I  have the exact same problem.  Let me tell you what has worked for me more recently.  This is my new routine:      Wash and condition your hair in the evening before you go to bed.  You should try Sleek & Shine by Garnier Fructis.  It smoothes your hair and help control frizz.  Slightly towel dry your hair, but not too much.  Just enough so that it is still wet but not SOPPING wet.  Use about a nickel size amount of Garnier Fructis Smoothing Milk.  Put it through your hair starting from the ends of your hair up to the roots.  Comb through your hair with a wide-tooth comb and do it gently so you don't break your hair.    Next, get some 3-inch, non-heat, self-gripping rollers (they are available for cheap at Target.  Get some clips, too, if your hair is fine because they will fall out if you don't).  Separate your hair into sections and roll it up using the rollers.    Leave them on overnight, allowing your hair to air-dry.  The next morning, spray or put on some heat protectant in your hair.  Now you can straighten your hair with your straightening iron.  Since your hair is already dry naturally, it will take only a time or two to straighten each section and your hair should have good body from the rollers you left in overnight.  When you are done, lightly spray your hair with Anti-Humidity Hairspray by Garnier.      My straightening time went from about 45 minutes in the morning to only about 10.  And my hair is showing the effects, too.  It's soft and starting to shine again.    Good luck to you!|`|59AiKKuCaa	you must stop starightening your hair, otherwise itll get in really really bad condition, possibly falling out.  buy from boots etc a good hair repair shampoo and conditioner set.  dont wash your hair everyday, that gets rid of nutrients and makes it look dull.  you can buy special vitaimins to make it look healthy.  if your hair is nice naturally then wear it natural.  i used to straigthen my hair loadss and wanted to wear my hair naturally but i never idd because i was afraid of what chavs and peple would say.  but now i wear it naturally bost days and it looks better.  only use straightners once/ twice a week.  buy loreal heat protection, i think it helps you hair and makes it looks straighter so you dont have to straighten it.  i also recommend tressemme heat something. it makes my hair really soft and adds shine. and protects.|`|cYsPx9sSaa	chuck the straighteners out the window|`|VihV4Troaa	don't straighten it for a while. that's the only way. try using biolage hydrating, it works really well.     if you must straighten it, use heat protection.|`|492681182d7c9b1f14276670369e851baa	Stop using straighteners!|`|qak9Kgmbaa	** dont wash ur hair every day   ** Stop straightening it every day  **start using simpler less fragrant shampoo|`|UXI8bWWOaa	I bet your hair is really nice wavy.

But now I am trying to get it in better condition because, like you, I want it to grow. I really miss having straight hair but I'm trying to think of the long term benefits. A lot of the time I have to tie it up in a bun, which I don't like but I need to be disciplined and the longer I go without straightening, the more motivated I feel. to continue. Sometimes I try and embrace my more wavier hair by using a small amount of curling lotion and plaiting it while its still a little wet. It doesn't look as good as straightened hair but I think it look acceptable sometimes.|`|R5pBAyMMaa	What kind of straightener do you use? I also straighten my almost everyday, and have been doing so for about 3 years now, and it's still really healthy. I use a 100% ceramic straightener, not just ceramic coated.

Also on days your not doing anything... just pull it upp. make it a habbit to do that once a week. go ahead and get a trim then start doing this stuff. it has helped me sooooo much cause i used to be in the same crisis you are in!! also if you arent doing anything skip a shower every once in a while,the natural oils are good for your hair. Another good tip, is shower the night before and let it air dry that way the blow dryer isnt frying it also!!! (: good luck. i hope this helps!!!|`|as9RDbJaaa	If you must   straighten your hair  every day, buy a good  thermal heat protective  spray from either  Tresemme or VO5.  Your damaging your  hair though by straightening  it daily. It needs a break.  Get your ends trimmed, the breaking  off is a sign of too much heat.  If you must have your hair straight  get a straightening hair formula or  spray instead of straightening it  everyday because, you are damaging  your hair.|`|UbqFw9dKaa	Don't straighten your hair it is like frying it probably! Even if you do it every day! Let your hair be natural! :-D|`|GQiMXAX3aa	i would cut it some, at least the fried parts at the end. then start using straightening cream, and make sure it says "heat protection" on it. use it right after you towel dry your hair after showering, and then don't touch it. air dry or blow dry, but blow drying your hair is just more heat, so air dry your hair whenever you have time.    you could also try getting a keratin treatment. it will last for about a month, but it's healthy and safe for your hair.|`|g8AVl7Qhaa	If you straighten it every day it can really damage your hair. You need to go to a good hairdressers and buy some heat protection products and some good shampoo and conditioners (ask your hairdresser for advice on what to get). I used to go swimming with my school and my hairdresser noticed my hair was thick and she was really helpful on telling me what i needed and everything. You can't do anything about the length but keep getting it cut won't really help! The only thing is so get hair extensions, but that's cheating! Hope this helps!|`|333z7KVXaa	You could continue straightening and blow-drying your hair, but use special heat protection / condition renewal products on it.    Also, if you're getting the frizzy ends, go to have the ends of your hair trimmed. Try not to apply heat to your hair too much, if possible.  x|`|6VAxpd2raa	well yes you do need it cut .. unfortunatly how highly you have damged it they might have to cut aload off !   but anyway from this point on you use lots and lots of hair protection spray i reccomnd trasseme . cut down on your straighteners but . and after you get outa the bath put some leave in conditioner on the ends this will be great   keepgeting a trim eat right, drink right and your their :D
AaXl3vcCaa	i used to work at a hair salon and i flat iron every day, i love all of the chi products so i would say yes to that, the self absorbed is their hydrating shampoo and i have really long thick hair and it never moisturized enough for me, my favorite shampoo are sleek look by matrix and the hydrating one from kenra

The highlights will make it look much prettier anyways :)  goood luckkkk x|`|6BWINZAdaa	Get layers dont cut off any length. Also, some nice side swept bangs would do a world of good for you.
aba0oAKwaa	grow out your bangs you would look great with long hair think about blond hair if you think that is too gurly and want a skater look medium brown and black highlights with out bangs you could also have it black hair neck short and keep the bangs.i will put a few web sites that mite help.

(:|`|kpeZVNl8aa	You have short hair, so extensions would fit perfectly..    http://i208.photobucket.com/albums/bb212...    I recently got some from Sally's beauty supply,  they were on sale $75.00 but are usually $80.00  They come in 14in, set of 8. I think it's a perfect length.  They're great quality, and easy to put it. So it's well worth it.  I like to get a bunch of colored extensions. ( cheap ) at hot-topic, and  mix it up a bit. Extensions are fun to use and can create the cutest styles!    - The color maybe you should keep it like it is in the third picture,  ' blonde and black ' is always a nice combo.     Best of luck!!|`|Tpxxlx6haa	I like the one you have i think black would be great, like all over :) with short layers ;) look nicex|`|iZX4UHx6aa	i think extensions would look quite nice that you could sometimes wear  hayz x|`|dFHHsjCDaa	keep your hair one color. i'd suggest dark brown. get extensions to make it about shoulder length so it doesnt look too fake. scene hair is out; natural hair is in.
OvsKauavaa	stay blonde like the 3rd pic|`|QvhPJAKyaa	yeah go for it :)  and i think your hair looks better tha color it is. (:|`|uR5aNpHGaa	i like the first haircut the best  i think you should dye your hair a lighter warmer brown rather than a blonde  i think itll go with your skintone better  also you have a round face so you dont want to cut your hair too short because itll make your face look rounder  below are some pictures  but long hair makes your face look thinner so if you want long hair youre lucky your face is round because people with long thin faces cant really have long hair hah
Xu7dJQOEaa	the third style would suit you better|`|t36Dce0Laa	I agree with the person above.|`|vF1XdjZ0aa	yeah i think it would really suit you :) i used to have long hair but now my hair is really thin and i got it cut like those pictures with lots of layers and it looks great, suits me better than long hair, and i have a round face aswell. hope i helped x|`|hOVzviFIaa	Thin hair has more volume the shorter it is. And those cuts look great with a round face like yours. The key thing is to keep the cut just below the chin line. Any shorter and your face will look EXTREMELY wide.    It is hard to get dark hair that light. It is do-able (please let the salon do it though) but it really damages hair. Since your hair is already thin, I would recommend a few lighter highlights.    Good luck :)    Oh and make sure to use mousse and to blow dry the roots for some extra volume
fhyYh3Dzaa	Yeah, I think that would look really good on you. I like those hairstyles a lot when it is longer in the front and shorter in th back.|`|VsAZ4cJNaa	nonono|`|X605sT7oaa	I think that honey blonde would suit you, but I would keep your hair longish. It looks a nice length as it is :)|`|kFXRlJ89aa	I think that type of cut would suit you well! The great thing about this type of cut is that you can layer and get more volume, which is great for all hair types! As far as the honey blonde, I think your hair color suits you! At most I would suggest some high and low lights or just bringing your shade down a color. Ask your colorist, they are always eager to share opinions. I would also bring the picture you like best and be clear on what you want :) Good luck!
kgGtK1rjaa	I put my hair up alot when i am cleaning or playing sports or something. I don't have naturally curly hair or wavy and it does that to. You should try shampoos and conditioners that keep your hair straight. I use a gel that does that. Also you can straighten it with a hair Straightener. Or maybe you need to get it cut or something. yea idk if this helped or not. sorry.
rDsKB0uXaa	use white eye liner|`|DF22BQ3yaa	drink plenty of water. this will go away.|`|mOd7ZZ7Maa	If you're getting enough sleep and eating healthy, there isn't any permanent way to get rid of dark circles. They could be genetic, or have something to do with your ethnicity. You can try using Biore enliven cooling eye gel. That will help with the puffiness.|`|RKC36n9Naa	i have tried countless creams in my lifetime... like you my circles aren't bad, but they are persistent. i heard good things about hylexin, but when i tried it a got no good results. so expensive isn't always better (that one was $100 and complete waste of money)  now i use Cosmedicine's Opt-mologist and it's a lot cheaper and i have the best results ever. i also don't trust drugstore brands for anything... i have wasted a lot more money there on products that do nothing, than at Sephora. i recommend if you are looking at brands from places like Sephora or Macy's request for the free samples... you can save a lot of money in the long run just by trying a product first at home.    also understanding why dark circles form is helpful to. not all are from lack of sleep or stress. sometimes its hereditary, or another common cause is rubbing your eyes too hard. there are tiny capillaries under your skin there, and when you rub your eyes with makeup or creams it can cause them to "leak" so essentially its like a bruise under your skin, even if it doesn't hurt.
DaGVWCYkaa	Make sure that your skin isn't oily before you put on the eyeliner. To prep my eyes, first I use oil-absorbing sheets to dry it up. A light mineral powder next, and then a light brown shadow to make a base. I use L'Oreal HIP eyeliner (the stick, not the cream). It blends well and smudges nicely for smoky eyes, and lasts for hours.|`|qjb81dNwaa	use waterproof! and is your skin greasy? or are your eyes watery? try not putting it as close to your eyes as you normally would. you could just be using a crappy eyeliner!|`|D1itsD38aa	If your face is oily, this might cause the liner to not stick to your face but stick to the oil instead and this is probably why it comes off. Wash your face with some oil cleansing wash like Clean and Clear Morning Burst Facial Cleanser http://www.cleanandclear.com/productDeta... If this doesn't work, try using a liquid liner since it dries after you put it on http://www.prestigecosmetics.com/main.ht... Hope this helps!|`|iUhIEz03aa	maybe your eyes are real moist i have the same problem ive used different kinds of eyeliners n they all come off but the one that works best for me is Lancom eyeliner.|`|HMCIdzwNaa	i use urban decay and it doesn't come off so stop putting on too much or i don't know....

Just like color the length will grow out too.  It isn't the end of the world.  But like I was telling someone else today, go near to your own color and color it a temporary, few weeks kind of color.  You can find those colors exactly where the permanent colors can be found.  If it doesn't work out, remember it will grow back and the color will fade away, someday.  Temp color fades sooner.|`|LM4vwHEyaa	you should get your hair cut exactly how the picture you want is shown. i think it would look really good with your face shape, you should try it out. and if it doesn't work, remember that it's only hair!

Just get bangs that graze the top of your eyebrows instead.|`|sqqbHDOOaa	Yes that haircut would look VERY pretty on you. And a dark chocolate brown would be nice.    Just keep in mind that that haircut would take daily maintaining, y'know, straightening blow-drying and stuff.|`|BDZc91Gzaa	ok well i think if you do a thing like long bangs off to the side i think that you would look awesome!!|`|NmO5Pjhwaa	I think the colour would work for you and the cut is cute. Not to sure about the bangs. I think it would look better if you had just a little fringe not such a drastic bang. I'm thinking the harsh bang would cut your proportions to much, you don't have a huge forehead.

acfd7907edce364d509ad8e43b8f4f0faa	Depending on the severity of your acne situation, it can effect how your makeup results come out. Acne can make foundation and powder seem piled on or flaky. I would suggest clearing up that problem before attempting. Or, just try not to apply much foundation onto the acne itself.     You'll first want a moisturizer for your face. Concealer is to be applied to minor blemishes around the face and dark under eye circles, while foundation should be applied to your entire face, to cover up a face full of blemishes. Don't use concealer on your entire face. It's too thick and it's not meant for that. Apply minimal amounts of makeup. Don't pile it on if it doesn't cover something. Though you don't have a face powder, I would suggest getting one. Foundations and concealers can make your face appear oily. A powder gets rid of the oiliness and smooths out the skin tone. Concealers and foundations can be applied with your fingers, a makeup brush, or a makeup sponge.     As for eyeliner, I wouldn't apply it to your waterline. (The strip of skin above your lower eyelashes) It just makes your eyes appear smaller and it smears all the time. I suggest applying it below your eye, about one third of the way across. This makes your eye appear bigger. It can also be applied on your eyelid, right along your top lash line. Finish with mascara. That should be the easiest to apply. Apply an eyeshadow beforehand if desired.     You can basically use the makeup products you already own. They should work just fine. Don't go and buy a whole bunch of unnecessary items. It will seem expensive and you may not even use them all. I would pick up a thing here and there. First start off with purchasing a face powder. Almost any kind will do. CoverGirl has a cheap one.     Tutorial: (Pencil can be used in place of liquid)  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OB8nfJCOI...|`|gxOdYxX6aa	girls who wear makeup aren't really naturally pretty  stick without makeup  im 17, i don't wear makeup  it's not essential|`|zFKULGWfaa	OK I will help yah calm down!

Mention your skin problem because there are a lot of foundations that are water-based and won't be too hard on your skin. I also use liquid eyeliner as close to the eye on the lid as possible. Also ask for help finding an eyeshadow that is mineral-based. That seems to work best for me. Most people don't realize I wear makeup until I tell them and I am 34! Good luck!|`|NqEw4skBaa	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OB8nfJCOI...|`|o9KJNCLJaa	Alright, well first off you need to get light natural colors, not usually black, but light pink and pale colors, then put it on lightly and usually don't use eye liner in less its very very light.|`|1keH3R6paa	You should go to Sephora and ask the professionals. They work wonders.|`|TdiuwtM5aa	i would suggest you use Noxzema for the acne and some real shea butter well raw shea butter and use light color shades for your skin just a touch up or you may use to much and it will be big blotches on your face just make your self look attractive|`|z090SyuWaa	maybe use a mineral foundation such as max factor or bare essentials im sure there are many brands it just depends on how much you want to spend, mineral powders are much more lighter and you don't get the caked on feel.  i think it looks very natural.  if you want to look natural just apply a little mascara, and a little highlighter to the cheeks  and then maybe a clear gloss  hope this helps and you feel better soon :D|`|uR5aNpHGaa	for skin i know clean and clear has face wash called rapid clear and it works pretty good  also owning a spot treatment is always helpful  but dont use too much because itll dry you out  i would suggest using a mineral powder  foundations can make you look unnatural and theyre more likely to make you break out  almay has a line of eye makeup to inhance your eye colors and they look pretty good and you dont look over done  for lips dont use lip gloss because its sticky and i think it looks fake  if you want to wear some kind of color only go like two shades darker than your natural lip color  dont use any bright reds or pinks or anyweird colors  personally i just use chapstick  i would suggest using softlips it works great and your lips will feel great|`|akAJJfdOaa	Bare Minerals may be a bit expensive, but if you buy the starter kit for about $60 dollars, it will last you about a year. That would only be like $5 dollars a month! You don't want to buy something cheap from the drugstore and not being good quality, so you'll end up wasting your money and probably ruin your complexion. So I suggest you buying something that's a bit expensive, but has the positives of helping your acne (since it doesn't clog pores and is made of minerals) and helping you look natural. When I first bought the kit, I didn't know how to use it but it comes with a How-To DVD that explains a lot. If you don't want to pay full price at Sephora or other makeup department stores, eBay's the best way to go. But be sure you're getting the REAL Bare Minerals I.D. There's a lot of fakes out there. If you don't know your skin color or tone, the makeup stores will definitely help you out with that.

94o3iNDtaa	Boy oh boy do I know what your going through lol. Im very fair, red hair, freckles :o). Tanning beds are death to girls like us. Ive used soo many different self tanning lotion, bronzers etc..  Ive also gotten spray tans from time to time. When it comes to Spray tans I suggest not going into a machine operated one..they come out uneven and when you sweat it comes off on your clothes(not fun when your in a bautiful dress).  So if your not shy go to a well known tanning salon where they have someone that sprays you manually. Pick a light color..I know you want to have color but for us fair ladies darker looks tacky. I got this done 2 days before prom and it looked great the day of!  If you want to try a self tanner..my fav. is Jergans Natural Glow. Just make sure to start using it a few weeks before the event..it takes time..in my opinion its not as good as spray.  Have fun at your social :)|`|sUH902cDaa	bronzing powder for you face would be great to accentuate your facial features and I would definitely recommend a professional spray tan in a salon because they are really great! Not only do you get no streaks as it's applied by someone else but the beautician will also make sure that is specifically suit your skin tone so you'll look naturally tanned :) xx|`|T18Z2sGRaa	I found this page of reviews from others who have used these products. You will need to go into each one, I did find some from fair skin users. Good luck and best wishes on your social!  http://www.reviewcentre.com/search.html?...

no9BzhhLaa	it will burnn your hairr a lot and kill itt. buy remington wet 2 straight. its like 30 or 40 dollars and i like it better than my 200 dollar straigtner..|`|VUNfI7yBaa	I wouldn't. Plus it seems like it would take a long time straitning wet hair. I would blow dry it first. Maybe you should get a new straitner|`|VHtY62Jcaa	I wouldn't say dangerous, but if it isn't made to straighten wet hair then you will probably ruin your hair.|`|gVRma7Mxaa	no but it will destroy your hair so you shouldnt do it|`|UFfJDWONaa	if it says you cant straighten ur wet hair with it..yea.  if it says it can, sure go ahead and see how it does, if it sucks get a refund.  :)|`|l344RtC8aa	yes straightening your hair wet even with an expensive straightener will fry your hair and dry it out. unless it says specifically that you can, it's a bad idea...  hope i helped:):):)|`|bT9SXnYQaa	It'll fry it.    blowdry your hair first|`|TKVQ2TXRaa	It will ruin your hair, especially if it's cheap.  I've done it, I know.  It will be hard to deal with.  If you want to straighten your hair wet, you need a good straightener that is designed for that, :)
3WItFAwlaa	Wearing green clothing would bring out the green rather than the brown undertones.  So would blue.    If you want to try eyeshadow, do this.  Use gold eyeshadow that isnt too sparkly on the main lid area.  Use a mossy green in a V shape on the outer third... at the base of the lash and in the crease.  That will bring out the green and make your eyes look bigger.|`|x88DfLokaa	well i have green eyes and i know when i dyed my hair a little darker my eyes stood out alot.. espeically if i didnt have anny eyeliner on.. cause you could just see the green but  even when i did have dark eyeliner they stood would stand out.. wear color that make your eyes stand out.|`|WuG2DBVIaa	Wearing green will bring the green out in your eyes. Or a bit of green eyeshadow or eyeliner will help too.|`|Sr1kywKFaa	I wear green contacts. To make them look more green, I wear purples. Purple eyeshadow or liner, and a brown mascara. Since its an opposite color to green, it makes the color stand out more.|`|RwY6mk43aa	you can put find light green or dark green eyeliner. and put it on the bottom eyelid=)|`|fVurmB5yaa	I wear green eyeliner on the top and bottome lash line and people say it makes my green eyes stand out, if your eyes change with the color you wear, you should try it!|`|Y3xQzZEWaa	You could try green-ish contacts. Or you could just put a little green eyeliner or eyeshadow on. Just a little bit.
aMZ7IKysaa	Honestly your best bet here would be to go to the shop, pick your artist, and have it customed.  That way you can let their creativity take over, have maximum input, and get exactly what you want.  It can also be tailored to your body shape.  You can't lose doing that.|`|kWiYtpvPaa	http://www.zhippo.com/HartfordCountyHOST...    http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2406/2262...    http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r38/m...    http://img176.imageshack.us/img176/6271/...    http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2291/2180...    google image flower tattoos on side of body... they have kind of alot... those were the only things i could find, but thats based off of google image.. im sure you can find things on tattooing websites.. hope i helpedddd!|`|c4sn6g3xaa	Have you looked in the Amy Brown tatto book?

LM4vwHEyaa	well it depends whether you're going with or without an adult.  if you're going with an adult, it's probably around 16, however if it's without an adult, im assuming around the age of either 18 or 21. i live in canada, so it's 18, but it might be different. also, it depends on where you are getting it done, because they're all different.|`|fna0OfuCaa	In America, you need to be 18 years old to get it without parental consent, but I don't know how old you need to be in England. You should call a piercing studio and ask how old you need to be to get it without parental consent.|`|Q5FYrU9vaa	65... when ur old and saggy ull look awesome with a tounge piercing|`|oKkhJg4Saa	I know in canada you have to be 16 without a parents signature that's when i got mine done and any lower than 16 had to have a parents signature But some places it is 18.

My hair will not grow and i tried everything. When i joined cosmetology i learned that hair that is chemicaly processed and abused with heat just cracks off. The way i got my hair to grow was to stop dying it for awile and get it trimed a tiny bit every 2 weeks. Also brushing your hair increases blood flow in your scalp so the hair folicals will be more nurioshed. And when using heat use a protective spray.|`|i50OzzaDaa	There's like a million questions on hair growth.

jez0O0bXaa	Your colorist should have been able to lift it. try using Prell shampoo or dish soap but it will take a few times. Also try to mix 20 volume developer (Sally's) with shampoo and leave on for 30 minutes. This may take several tries but these are less damaging.  Or find a better colorist.|`|CtHi5L78aa	honestly getting black out is the hardest thing and the hardest on your hair my advice is to start washing your hair with a dish soap like dawn and leaving it in for a bit maybe 20 mins a few times a week to try and lift your color and get a clarifying shampoo and use that for a while to try and fade the black out a little .. then i would see what your stylist can do and ask her about a product called elimniate.. you can get it at professional hair stores and i believe matrix makes it but thats a product that is suppose to lift your hair to the highest level without damaging your hair, i have used it on clients and it works but i would try fading out your black a little first|`|LlC99CYqaa	strip it out with dawn dish soap .
2Urd6VLqaa	Before applying the nail polish make sure your nails are really clean. Try using nail polish remover on them and then rinse them with water.    Also, try investing in a base coat. It should increase the longevity of your polish.    I think the reason you are having problems with your polish peeling in because you are using your hands and nails all day. Taking money in and out of the register with the tips of your fingers will wear down the polish.    ?|`|Bzxxl5v3aa	Clean your nails really good, paint them, then put either a clear coat, or a clear rubber coat over them. The clear rubber coat works good... takes a while to dry tho!!|`|f9sL3WgQaa	You have too much oil in yoru skin, hair and nails and the polish isn't sticking. Try looking at your diet, upping your water content and laying off fatting and greasy foods.|`|hHN93lwuaa	go to a professional nail salon and make them do it|`|60ApQsGOaa	omg you don't need nails to be a cashier. I think it's real gaudy when I see a cahsier with rediculous nails. If you just get a nice manicure WITHOUT NAILS OR PAINT, and just get a clear coat, they look nice, clean and professional and wont chip away cuz there's no paint. just a clear coat.|`|jeCvLt9saa	well buy something else  change the brand you're using, some of them are really crappy|`|9dr0BZIbaa	Make sure to put a base coat on before the colour.  It helps the colour stick better, and it prevents staining your nails.  When putting on the colour, let it fully dry.  Regular nail polish takes thirty minutes to dry.  Finally, put a top coat on top to seal the colour in.|`|YMnTveWuaa	I would recommend a polish remover to take it off.    Peeling it off could scar or gouge the nails.|`|sNIIwHU2aa	Don't paint your nails at all if it is that important to you. Just take care of them.|`|9qkCf6Mlaa	It shouldn't PEEL. If your talking about just chipping try painting the  tips of your nails first then applying like regular. If it's peeling off you have bad nail polish.|`|iBGkSg50aa	You should try to get better quality nail polish. Good luck!|`|DF22BQ3yaa	start from scratch and polish your nails with one layer of clear polish first, apply the colored polish and apply one top coat of clear polish again. This should hold for awhile.    Keep in mind that nail maintainence may be excessive with the kind of job you do because of the constant lifting of things and the movement of your hands.|`|7ROXROUxaa	do you use a base coat? there's some stuff i like called stickey. i think? & you can get it at like sally's or something. then the color coat, then the top coat. but this stuff is good because it helps the color stick to your nails better. i'm not sure what the brand is though.|`|kecpGboNaa	Try a finishing spray. Salons use em but you can get a big can for like $5 at CVS. One spray helps it dry quick and it lasts on me for at least a week and a half. Hope this helps :)|`|nH3HmecDaa	Make sure that your nails are clean and free from oil before you put nail polish. Filing your nails doesn't help and don't put tons of layers on. A base coast, a nailpolish and top coat is good.    Also don't use cheap nailpolish especially the ones which 'dry' in 5 seconds. Choose good brands.|`|nniRZJVZaa	Dont file your nail.|`|PbESq4Cyaa	cool|`|GyX6Oar8aa	that simple all you need is a clear coat put it on and just start wiph it off witth an old rag or  you can use a  nail filer and rub it on your nails and it should start to come off|`|CeEZLjasaa	Ok so maybe you can buy a color you like and paint them on your nails. But you aren't done yet! You have to check when they're dry, put a second coating! This shouldn't peel.     Ho[e I helped! :)
ajeMVARraa	Nope. I look like a supermodel and was blessed with the ideal female body.|`|Y0O6971laa	No; I know normal people don't look like that.   What annoys me is that tey discriminate.

Some people look good really thin, some look good normal or even a little chubby.  i think I look good normal.|`|fhyYh3Dzaa	Yeah, it can be hard to look like to take care of yourself and respect yourself while not getting sucked into  the way that the media says that you should look.

I also like tall woman with no breasts.    I like woman with big meaty thighs.    I love bellys.  A woman with some belly is so nice.    I love those white cottage cheese looking butts.  I really love that.  Stretch marked dark woman are like Tigers.  I love the golden stripes.    White and chubby or brown and skinny.    I like the kind of woman you don't find in magazines.    There are so many types of woman because the same thing is boring after awhile.    I never get along with woman that think they are perfect.  Look at my picture.  I have a big belly and I don't walk.    That is just how I am.

lggL1TFjaa	you can just not get it cut for a while :)|`|xshrKvIRaa	Just wait. Hair grows six inches per year. You can try using Patene Long Lengths products. Also get regular trims to avoid split end damage. Try vitamins too. Waiting is the hardest part!|`|bT9SXnYQaa	There's really nothing you can do..  Except wait.    Maybe eat healthier, and there are supplements for hair/skin/nails.  Try those.|`|UY6mkCk2aa	Garnier length and strenth is pretty good, I use it...and I heard that your roots will grow faster if you put vaseline on them :) but either way ti takes time, so you'll just have to wait :)
kecpGboNaa	I've been told multiple times that the average persons hair grows 6 inches a year. Its proven true for me. If you want your hair to grow, take vitamins. You get healthier hair and nails :)|`|mqlzkJ54aa	Well hair grows about 1/2 an inch a month.. so do the math.  Everyone is a little different.|`|j3DqJ2BBaa	your hair grows half an inch each month . im still growing mine :D|`|zjPhjKY7aa	a very long time :)|`|NMQ7WCE2aa	well my hair grew just below my boobs and that took about 3-4 years|`|YuZ8QHMLaa	On average your hair grows 1/2 an inch a month, so over a year it would grow an average of 6 inches, but apparently you can get various hair growth tablets etc.|`|jpGNV4Qhaa	2 years i went from short short to 5 inches below my shoulder  but i no for fact that ur hair grows 1 milimeter a day|`|TZSMO5vjaa	It took me 7 months  I had my hair shoulder length and then by 7 months it was down to my mid back|`|QKV0VYXQaa	This is a bit of an impossible question as everyones hair has a maximum length, its possible to not even reach it. Rate of growth depends on nutrition and stuff, so just be patient! :D|`|bT9SXnYQaa	Hair grows 1/2 an inch a month.

440bc9fc52f071a2327870a6bd744e8faa	It works for some, doesn't work for others. Though you may be black, your skin is different than another black woman's because everyone has different skin. So the only way you will know if it works for YOU is by trying it. Good luck!    If that doesn't work, try cocoa butter :D
7add460ae24c9452ae87b5a99c5aa756aa	Yes of course they can.  Spider veins have nothing to do with the layers of your skin.|`|bogfZ6Xsaa	As far as I know  yes because I watched an INKED episode where they tattooed over a bunch of back keloids which are built up scar tissue. I think it'll be fine no worries! Hope this helps!
ZLXysKrOaa	Yes. Eggs promote healthy hair and nails because of their high sulphur content and wide array of vitamins and minerals. Many people find their hair growing faster after adding eggs to their diet, especially if they were previously deficient in foods containing sulphur or B12.

I use Max Factor Colour Perfection or Loreal Contour Resist|`|0a115b3a813d3ea64d4f07d95c126639aa	Urban Decay Primer Potion is perfect for what you're describing. I have really oily eyelids and even if I washed my face 5 minutes before putting on my makeup and 15 minutes before walking out the door, my eye makeup would pretty much slide off my face (and it wasn't because I was using cheap makeup, either!).     Anyways, I did my research, and I watched youtube makeup tutorials, and I discovered urban decay primer potion. I went out and bought some, and ever since, it's been a staple in my makeup routine. I put it on every time I put on my makeup like a second nature because it's not a big deal to apply. It only takes like 30 seconds. Even if I don't wear eye makeup that day, I'll put on UDPP because it keeps my eye lids matte and oil free for hours.     All you have to do is open the bottle, (it's a twist bottle, with a wand), and glide the wand over your eyelid and upper and lower lash lines, using as much or as little as you like, (it blends into any skin tone, so there's really no way you can use too much). Rub it in well with your fingers and you're good to go.    http://www.sephora.com/browse/product.jh...  It's 15 bucks, (well worth the price tag as you can get a year's worth of use out of it, no problem) and you can purchase it at Ulta, Sephora, or directly from urbandecay.com.    If you'd rather try something different,   Benefit makes great eye shadow primers, too, as does too faced, mac, and sephora and ulta's store brand makeup lines, and you can even find some at drugstores.     Hit up your local makeup department store, ulta, or sephora and play around a little.|`|fApIJdt7aa	you could try liquid eyeliner|`|MdJ2JVoDaa	go to the bathroom and re apply. Also dont get the wooden pencil kind cause they suck.|`|aYICSwMpaa	Hi    Eyeliner has a habit of doing that!    Why don't you buy a waterproof eyeliner?    It will look perfect :)    X|`|QdXvBOL7aa	mine did that too. so i started using liquid eyeliner.

My friend uses liquid eyeliner and it seems to stay on her eyes for most of the day but i couldnt bare wear that lol i prefer pencil i just have to keep topping it up.|`|7aaoof6yaa	Neutrogena eyeliner works GREAT!...It doesn't run or smudge at all.  and try Too Faced eye primer|`|SHARt1k3aa	Use liquid.  I use the best make up, but I found that Cover Girl, liquid eyeliner is the best.  It's in a small silver and black pen like tube, and it's the best.  You have so control, it has a small brush at the end.  Try it, mine stays on perfect all day long.|`|S0i3rB1Saa	if you use pencil you aught to try and change to liquid, its much more effective once you've got the hang of it. try 'liner clubbing ultra black' by Bourjois. it stays on all through the day :) if you really like pencil though, try smudging it into your lash line - it helps it stay put.|`|pGIADFNxaa	Yeah,eyeliner does that,even if you dont touch your eyes.It tends to melt away.Happens to me too.I find it kinda helps if you touch the tip of the eyeliner to a hot radiator and keep it there for a split second,then immediatly apply it to your eyes.Its hot,so,it stays on your eyes once it dries.|`|hCsAHDjNaa	Ugh I always have that problem too!  I've heard there's stuff at Sephora that you put on before you do your makeup that keeps it perfectly in place, but its sort of expensive? Maybe you could try that, I'm thinking about it.|`|eZiIQajNaa	are you applying it in your eye? The water line?? if its here its cos when blink it goes to your upper lash line, my tip is to colour te top water line and the bottom then you have minimum transfer!!    Is it on the outter eye?? Sounds like your using a kohl pencil which s desined to be soft and smokey, try using a waterproof pencil and stting it with a eyeshadow to stop it moving    Graphblack technakohl pencil is wicked to use both in the eye and out the eye and its waterproof, costs 11.50 from mac and also try setting it wih carbon eyeshadow in the eye works a treat!!! this isnt just for black colours it can be for all coloured eyeliners too    hope this helps    shona x|`|LROAETQCaa	vv|`|ZlVPMsWTaa	Liquid eyeliner will stick all day, but it takes practice to get a straight line. It's good to use if you have oily skin, it won't fade.    As for pencils, you will need to put foundation on your eyelids to make it stick. It also helps if you're wearing eye shadow, it will last longer and won't smudge.    It doesn't matter if you're using a cheap or expensive eyeliner pencil (it's all the same!).|`|9pO3XVxMaa	You get what you pay for.|`|3Phz1nHeaa	I use Mary Kay and I love it.  It stays on all day for.  I think they have products too that you apply to your eyes before you apply makeup so that you eye makeup holds up better through out the day.|`|uuB06LSuaa	try a new eye liner|`|tvTVbZLGaa	all makeup will smear and mess up from all kinds of exposure, plus your face produces oils that and your eyes produces secretions that can easily mess it up over a span of a few hours. you should always take your eyeliner to work and reapply when this occurs, what i do is bring q-tips to clean off the smeared part underneath my eyes and reapply after maybe 4 or 5 hours. it works like a charm! but if u do want to reduce how often u need to reapply, use waterproof eyeliner if they sell that because it is made to be much more durable to moisture.    oh and always use the khol pencil eyeliners or roll up ones, especially in blackest black color..use maybelline or revlon if u want something decently priced that will work well.

Are you gay?  Any way, the shorter your hair, the easier it will be. The roots will turn platinum faster because of the heat of your head.

aU32ilTwaa	Yes, natural light blondes are usually pale. I mean a deep tan and platinum blonde hair doesn't look great together it looks fake. A good example of a woman with dyed blonde hair and pale skin is Drew Barrymore she looks fantastic.|`|kpeZVNl8aa	Most blonds have fairly tan skin, but there's deffinetly alot who don't.   Not knowing exactly what you look like, all I can say is why not?  It's only hair, and you can always redye it.

DfDss68haa	http://motowngirl.com    Also this youtube channel is good for inspiration:  http://www.youtube.com/user/naturalnana|`|A4vkBZRSaa	Check out these styles from Khamit Kinks:    http://www.khamitkinks.com/hairshow3.htm...    Plaits are a great option if you are not skilled in braiding. It lasts long and you can vary the styles from ponytails to left loose. Doing her hair the same way in those tight brushed back ponytails can lead to traction alopecia, so try to vary the styles and choose those that are not as stressful on the hairline.
DiECaXKRaa	Well if you want more of a straight effect then you should use the relaxer, but it will damage you hair because it has more chemicals    the texturiser is safer to use , but it just makes you hair more manageable, not straight xxx|`|DTh1rgoqaa	Relaxer. They have a stronger effect.
elifTnkkaa	This is like the perfect question for me. First of all good thing you're planning to switch to M.A.C!! M.A.C is always the perfect fashion accesory, as it is always been seen in celebrities such as Paris Hilton, Angelina Jolie, etc. M.A.C is also very very popular in the fashion industry. Designers such as Alexander McQueen, Heatherette, even Barbie have teamed up with M.A.C to create special limited edition collections (which you can barely find nowadays :[ ) and M.A.C always has the latest trends in colors. M.A.C is very natural and it is very chic. It has many products for you to choose according to your taste. If you want a natural look or a very dramatic avant garde look M.A.C is there. It has many many colors and it lasts long (according to how much make up you use). It is a bit expensive, but the good thing is that you can find M.A.C at places such as Saks Off Fifth Avenue on a discount price. Hope it helps!    ps. M.A.C is getting a new limited edition collection with Hello Kitty starting February 2009!!|`|MfuUAcNwaa	there foundation really is thick.But you could try mineral make up.Mac is the best around you can't beat it.there eyeshadow are the best around.The lip colors are awesome to.I recommend mac over any make up in the world!|`|W9wAVpg1aa	MAC is one of my favorites but dior, chanel and lancome are pure genius. i love it i spend around $190 on makeup every 3 months:)    its best for quality, color, brand, and healthiness|`|bvdTKTCVaa	Well i have MAC cover up and it works well its smooth and doesnt `melt' in the summer, the MAC eyeshadows are great except the dark ones, you have to be careful because the colours are really vibrant, i would stick to the light colours for eye shadow.  The lip glosses are fabulous if you buy the plush glass, they plump up your lips =)  I would definatly invest in some if i were you|`|y0bcS3OIaa	NO!  Do not use MAC.  MAC is stage makeup and is really bad for skin that is prone to breakouts.  I know this because my friend works for Estee Lauder as a make up artist and they own MAC.  My skin is also oily and acne prone and she suggested that I steer clear of MAC.  I am able to use some products from MAC, including eye shadow and mascara but I stay away from facial products like their foundations, powders, and blushes.      If you are looking for good makeup that is good for your skin, I suggest Bare Minerals.  If you want something a bit heavier, then possibly Stila.  If you go to Sephora or any makeup counter they should be happy to test the products on you to make sure you don't break out.|`|zFKULGWfaa	good on yah   Use Mac!!!!!!!!
368008361e77a77ceeb8c70a92a3c2b8aa	oh no...not at all.  red haired, fair skinned women tend to stay out of the sun more or use very high factor sun creams as they tend to burn easily...and simply because of that - their skin stays younger looking as they age - compared to others.|`|ayGeAonbaa	I am red haired with green eyes and I find if you stay out of the sun as much as you can and wear a sun block it's fine.     Be proud of being red ;)
WYa3UY6Gaa	God saw that he was getting tired  and a cure was not to be;  so he put his arms around him  and whispered, come with me    With tearful eyes, in silence,  we saw him fade away.

90NzgbSsaa	well you should try layering your hair. it still keeps it long but it gives it volume and looks SO different. Also dye it, get some highlights or just different tones of your hair color. Maybe even bangs. Look and find some celebrities hair that you like and go for it.|`|dPGbFd1Faa	wavy hair|`|kmo44Nceaa	Tell your stylist exactly what you just said.  Also figure out what your limits are and let her know what you WONT do, like how short you are willing to go.  Check out the hair magazines.  They are very helpful.  I often circle several examples and bring it in with me.     Consider losing the long hair.  It will grow back. :)|`|6oZwBM6gaa	ok its confusing but here it goes.  1.part your hair in the middle  2.where your line ends, take some of the hair and clip it up(just to hold it) note:only take hair to where you can theres still some on the bottom  3.take 1 strip of hair on each side on the front and tie it back in the place where the hair you tied up was  4.release the hair you clipped up  5.TADAH!!! CUTE HUH?|`|ADkusTVXaa	Why don't you try the wavy look with braids starting at the front and attaching them at the back.    1. Wash hair and towel-dry until slightly damp.    2. Create a center crease, and then comb your hair to get any of the knots or tangles out.    3. Apply heat protection spray before curling your hair.    4. Take 1-inch sections of your hair and with the curling iron, loosely curl.    5. Once finished run your fingers through your hair too loosen any tight curls.    6. Now pick 1-inch strands on each sides of your head closest to your bangs, and create braids.    7. Take each of those braids, and tie them together behind your head with a small black (or your hair colored) elastic.    8. Enjoy!
SCJ9pVycaa	I use Aphogee products. They have shampoos, conditioners, treatments, and moisturizers, and they really do help my hair become more healthy. Olive oil and Mizani products are great too (the Mizani conditioner and shampoo is good), which I will agree that Mizani is expensive, but worth the money.    Try Aphogee, it's a great brand and keeps your hair healthy! Good luck with your hair(:|`|lWobDwmnaa	im biracial too. im black and filipino and the key to taking care of your hair is knowing how to take care of it.  that requires salon care, conditioning, and stuff.  go see a hairstylist and ask her for tips.  your hair is in desperate need of moisture so i recommend a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner. don't shampoo everyday but condition everyday.  you can use leave in condioners too. dont add heat to your hair for a while. just air dry it. and wear it natural. hope this helps.
90NzgbSsaa	well if you have had long hair all your life then cutting it too short is not a good idea. I did and i regret it every day! i think you should cut it if anything at shoulder length. but its a big change. my friend has hair to her hips too and she is very afraid to cut it. she cut 6 inches off and she wishes she hadnt.|`|fna0OfuCaa	This is a greeeat cut I think!     http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u284/...|`|lWyux6nuaa	heres a couple pics i found that sound like they would work for you :D      and no having a longer neck isnt bad dear.    http://www.imageandstylenews.com/wp-cont...      http://trend911.com/wp-content/1withersp...      http://images.askmen.com/imagessexsymbol...    http://i118.photobucket.com/albums/o99/p...|`|AA12148387	No but go for layers in the bob because that will flatter your neck.

It would look great. you`ll look like a cool person random i cant explain it.|`|5e6Dn1yVaa	i think you should cut it. but i would NOT cut it that short @ first. first get a cute cut with layers maybe shoulder length or even past your shoulders maybe right above your chest. & then a month later if you like your hair being that length.. go shorter! shorter hair feels great! mine is right below my shoulders and i used to have loong hair.. love it shorter! it brings out your face way more i think because your not hiding behind all that hair!

NbWFJjvraa	I'm about to have my 6th laser hair removal treatment for my bikini and legs.  (They make you space out the treatments 8 weeks, so I'm coming up on a year that I've been going.)  I can honestly say that I haven't had to shave my legs in 3 months!  It's awesome.  There are some places in my private areas that are a bit resistant, but I would say I have 90% less hair than previously.    Yes, it is expensive, and it's not exactly pleasant, but a good place will give you a prescription for numbing cream.    If it makes you feel better about yourself, I say go for it!  I'm so glad I did it.    (BTW, I had another area done years ago and the removal is PERMANENT----yay*!)|`|rgNP0Qo6aa	Listen up! Your body has dark and light hairs everywhere, you just don't notice the light hairs. When you get laser hair removal it removes the dark hair, but not the light. So you will always have peachfuzz, especially on your back and stomach and chest, ect. But everyone has peachfuzz, it's normal and cute, but it will get rid of the dark hairs, which is what everyone wants Good luck!    Okay... science answer:    You grow in at least 80% of your hair during puberty. When you have laser hair removal the hairs it kills will never grow again. But you still have up to 20% of your normal thickness that will grow in throughout the rest of your life. So people get touch up sessions every 3-5 years after their big 6 treatments. You need about 6 treatments, one each 2 months for a year, because the hair grows in different stages and it can only kill hair in the active growth stage. The laser works by targeting dark color (the hair follicle) and passing through light color (the skin) the hair and skin have to be very different shades of color for the hair to work. The darker and coarser the hair and lighter the skin, the better results you will have.    Okay... Personal Experience:    I've had 2 out of my 6 treatments so far. It HURTS! It's like being poked with a sewing needle over and over, but it's not as painful as a tattoo, and that's not as painful as childbirth, maybe that can put the pain in perspective for you =) I've had my legs, underarms, and bikini area done. When you get your bikini area done they do ALL of it! Including spreading your butt and vaginal lips apart to laser all the cracks... It's sorta awkward. After the 2 treatments I've had so far I've lost about 60% of leg hair, 40% bikini hair, and 25% underarms hair. It's because the underarms hair is the thinnest and the leg hair is the coarsest. But the legs are the most painful. The more it hurts the better it works.  I spent this much for 6 treatments in each area:  Bikini-$750  Underarms-$750  Legs (toes to bikini)-$2,500    Email me if you have any more questions about it!|`|W9wAVpg1aa	umm for the first 2 or three sessions yes, but after that it will be so thin that you wont even know its there|`|Z8gxrfNeaa	do not get laser hair removel its bad for u and cost a lot and its stupied|`|3zBq5AKLaa	no, when you laser it will not grow back at all  if it does it will be very very little    lasering takes a lot of steps, the first time you have it done it will not be a significant difference but after 7 or 8 times there will be no hair left
meK0ziCJaa	I've never heard of that product, but any salon quality product would be advisable. If you have an Ulta cosmetic store near you, try there. They have really knowledgeable staff, and they have coupons online.     I would also advise getting the ends trimmed. That will give your hair an all over healthier appearance.|`|79b3d0f8c17037a2e4a5a3f573d4598faa	hi get ur hair trimmed thats the best condition u cud give ur hair...have u tried aussie...its gud.or olive oil!gud luck|`|8RLv9SvDaa	I've heard that stuff is pretty good. but if you really want a money saver the best all-natural stuff you can use is extra-virgin olive oil. Dampen your hair and slaver some on root to tip then wrap your head in suran wrap to keep in the keep and moisturize even more. Leave it in for about 10 minutes and you're hair will great|`|ESWeS3Qkaa	uh i think you should take a shower in warm water and put shampoo on your head and rub it really good like scratching your head and do it the same way for conditioner oh and if you have lots of dandrift on your hair do the same way as the first one that i said but change shampoo every week|`|EAJ7t2htaa	I have the EXACT same problem as u. I straighten my hair all the time and it damages my hair like crazy and i also color it. I use Aphogee Two Step Protien Treatment, it is frickin AMAZING! It gets rid of your split ends AND makes ur hair glass shiny. But u have to be careful with it because if u do it wrong it can damage ur hair more. Also it is a two step treatment so u have to use a deep conditioner after it, so I use Loreal Nature's therapy mega moiusture treatment and this stuff is AMAZING too!!!! And their both REALLY cheap like 7 bucks each. Also use the Aphogee Shampoo for damage hair before using the two step protien treatment. That also helps damaged hair.     I highly recommend this because it gets rid of the damage and it reconstructs ur hair. I havent cut my hair in 6 months (and i straighten it every day) and it has grown 2 inches, its THAT amazing. Hope i helped!--Hayden
ckdYl9Znaa	take a shower|`|c98c60d71dbb85f0335e5c7fc391ddd3aa	use a thick mixture of flour and water and apply to your hair.Then use a hair dryer to heat it until it hardens.Then wash it out.|`|cnu7y9C7aa	Dawn dish detergent. Its formula is even used to clean up baby penguins and such after oil spills.    Be careful though, it's a bit harsh and will further dry out your scalp (and hair) if you use it too often.    You can use any other dish detergent, too.  Just don't use the stuff made for dish washing machines and stick to liquid, not powder.|`|KSMU64ssaa	Have a bath and soak your whole head for a couple minutes in very warm water. Then shampoo with a moisturizing shampoo twice to make sure the vaseline is all out. Then use a good conditioner. Done!|`|dycC1Lxoaa	NEVER DO THAT!!!!!!! IT DOESN'T DO MUCH BUT DAMMAGE UR HAIR!!!!!!!!! Just get a moisturizing shampoo for $1 (the bottle is really small) at Bath&Body works!!!!|`|SCJ9pVycaa	Dawn dish soap works, but not too much, since it is a harsh detergent.    Using Vaseline can dry your scalp even further. Next time, use an olive oil to keep your scalp and hair moisturized.

aleWoJufaa	No, fashion models are tall and thin.    All types are beautiful!  Tall and thin: http://www.maxitmag.com/images/stories/l...  Thick and curvy: http://www.topnews.in/files/images/KimKa...  Medium: http://www.scarlettjohanssonwatch.com/wp...  Small and petite: http://www.falloutcentral.com/news/wp-co...|`|WxoZrTPlaa	Have you ever heard the saying, "Beauty is in the eye of the beholder?"  That means we all find different things attractive.  Some folks like thick and curvy, some like tall and thin, some like something in between.  But more than anything, most people are drawn to a good personality, humor, warmth, intelligence, sensitivity.|`|MGjMjWwaaa	it's good for the model industry|`|8UyUhlusaa	Most guys like their girls to be petite and smaller than them.  They think it looks wrong if they are walking along with a girl practicaly twice there size!|`|24Xy8qWtaa	No, confidence is beauty.|`|NBOBMQwdaa	Not necesarilly. In fact, it doesn't look very attractive when some very tall models have legs where the knee is the biggest part. I personally think shorter athletic (not too skinny, sturdy, muscular) girls are pretty.|`|ae24FseFaa	not neccessarily..in a way its pretty but being happy and confident is more attractive.|`|O1Sqcc5yaa	Nope.  I like short girls.|`|IjpJanM0aa	Uh no.  Short and thick can be just as pretty.  Or tall and thick can be just a pretty.  You can be pretty no matter what size you are.  Some ppl are just shady and thats all they care about.|`|WZeUrVXFaa	no, short fatness is.|`|IOxAUcwQaa	depends but usually tall and a certain point of skinnyness is hot
oYdsU2ROaa	It's up to you if you want to shave your hair than shave them  but i would recommend you change your shampoo  www.beautyencounter.com/743877011334.h...  Good luck!|`|Z8d9ipxmaa	It's up to you. If you'd prefer it shaved rather than watching it thin, then go for it.     But please don't be self concious... Hair loss is genetic and common in men, it doesn't make your looks any less attractive. Some women like a shaved head lol! You're not weird for loosing hair at 24, some guys just do, it's just genes.     Good luck! =D|`|XewbBwvKaa	naaa....wear a hat!!!|`|ab1c9b81d36c3691f0d575d773009489aa	If you are self-conscious about the thinning, then yeah...it'll probably look just fine if you shave it.  A lot of guys have really short hair anyway.|`|89FgPZ9Waa	Yes, u should. and put on a cap. COOL|`|KTLGIe8yaa	Depends what you look like,  If you have a weird shaped head then don't shave it. If you think it'll look good then go for it.
AA11272456	Oils break down any and every make-up.  Slather your eyes (and your whole face) with Vaseline when you are ready to remove makeup.  Use your fingers or a cotton ball and just work the Vaseline in as if you are massaging your eyes (keep your eyes closed of course).  Wipe off with a cotton ball or a tissue.  I prefer tissue because cotton tends to leave itself behind and little tiny strands of the cotton will end up in your eye and drive you out of your mind.  :)     Using baby oil or Vaseline will remove all make up, condition your eyelashes and moisturize your whole face.  Voila!    Hannah J Paul|`|6zXpA0PNaa	Drench your eyelashes in baby oil. I wouldn't recommend waterproof mascara. There are smudgeproof mascaras that are not waterproof.|`|rU06ORhBaa	try putting some sugar in the water THEN put it on...make sure that eye is closed so nothign goes through...............it's not compeltely waterproof by the way..it'll come off....    ...try seprating them with your hands if THAT doesn't work|`|NWssZ2qGaa	Clinique has a really good eye makeup remover that takes it away, and because it's for eye makeup it doesn't harm you if a little gets in your eyes. I use it and it works great, but there are other brands that have this as well, this is just the one I know works.|`|1zceagC8aa	I've used lots of face cleaners, drug store & department store stuff, and the one that I've found helps more than any others are the Neutrogena Make-Up remover cloths. They don't burn or sting or anything, and they remove even waterproof mascara really painlessly and easily. I'd never clean my face with anything else.|`|koAgWMphaa	you can buy really good makeup removers from places like CVS....i like the oily ones that are like baby oil...they have sensitive ones made just for eyes, too.|`|XI12bYCMaa	inexpinseve petrolium jelly (aka Vaseline) is great! it dusnt irritate or burn your eyes, yay!|`|78588e3257514586ce18e14f16018f9eaa	Eye makeup remover if you have it.  If you don't have it, use baby oil, it works great.  If you don't have baby oil, try oilve oil.|`|eulMjLtPaa	Baby oil, Vaseline on a Q-tip, Pond's makeup remover sheets.|`|Vhq3GURQaa	Use a oil. Bby oil or make up remover . Lightly apply with a cotton pad. Then with clean finger . Rub lashes between thumb and forefinger. Then wipe again. Be gentle. Your eye area is sensitive.|`|6nqSyISTaa	Netrogena Make-Up Remover Wipes - they remove every single type of make-up, mascara included...or if that doesnt work, wet your eyelashes with baby oil.    Hope this helps.|`|UgzaDU8vaa	I use baby wash, not baby oil.  Tear free stuff, it's cheap and good to just cleanse your face too.|`|0mAeM1zGaa	Try taking a really hot steamy shower. This usually works for me, after you get out of the shower use makeup remover cloth and you will get the majority of. Waterproof mascara usually doesn't come off for about up to 3 days. Best of luck.
qLvhoRpsaa	Oh I am sorry to hear about that! I don't know for sure, but I do know that they grow rather slowly compared to our hair. False eyelashes do not have to be expensive to look good or natural. It is more about learning how to do it than paying lots of money for them. I have a friend who uses fake eyelashes on a daily basis. If you did not know her with out her fake lashes, you wouldn't even know they were fake. She buys failry inexpensive lashes, but cuts small strips and places them in the middle to outer area of her eyelash line. It took her some practicing time, but it looks great how she does them now. I would suggest to buy a few packages of cheap eye lashes and see if you can make them work for you.   Good Luck. Peace:)|`|hGAVJPrSaa	About 7-8 weeks.|`|eIwFHVvPaa	IDK i would say 1 month but try fake eyelishes right now|`|FlKrA3nEaa	about 2 months or so. this happened to me before lol.  also about the fake lashes use the indiviual ones...you can custom place them wherever you need it =]

JBQ2hVjwaa	It's fine to base your wardrobe on those colors but don't turn down a great red piece if you love one.  Leave your options open.|`|igrdohopaa	I do too! (=|`|g6u9rrz5aa	haha ^^ those are all my fave colors.|`|VRZKHqbkaa	yeah of course! thats pretty much my whole wardrobe!|`|NWssZ2qGaa	Hey that's what I wear. Though I usually add a nice splash of red to give it some punch. I see no problem with it, and agree that it's classy. Simplicity is always best.|`|kJCzqIyGaa	LOL of course it is okay to wear only those colours|`|ASZ4QiDlaa	It's fine, just as long as you're not afraid to wear other colors.      For example: a few simple red accessories add contrast and variety to a black & white outfit.
ADkusTVXaa	Try this:    1. Jump in the shower and wash your hair with shampoo. Wash out and apply conditioner to ends of hair only. (Optional)    2. Spray your hair with heat protection and then blow dry until completely dry.    3. Turn on curling iron, whilst it is heating up part your hair to the left of your head.    4. Split your hair into medium sized sections and curl each section for 3-4 mins.    5. Once you have curled all of your hair grip your fringe up using and a hair grip and place your hair over the top to hide the grip.     6. To finish spray your hair with a little bit of hairspray.

FlKrA3nEaa	if you used permanent color then it wont go to your natural color it will turn orange (if your hair has red tones in it) or green (if your hair has ashy tones to it)  you could use that and then color over it with your desired color.  remember to always use a lighter color than what you want on the box =]    and it shouldnt cause hair loss unless your hair feels brittle and damaged...then it could break...but you wont lose your hair as in balding unless your allergic. try to do a patch test on your wrist up to 48 hours before you do this.

It's mostly cute, but the whole gray theme was too much for me.   Maybe add some kind of color in the shoes or even the accessories.   But, I have to say that it struck me as slightly boring.   Sorry.   : /     Too matchy matchy, I think.|`|z2v9tw1Saa	i think that looks really pretty. i think its easpecially good for like a wedding or something like that|`|KwvGRvYWaa	WOW that is a really creative and beautiful outfit, if only i was that good on polyvore!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|1fW22CIBaa	omg....   that is so cute i should so try tht  i'll give it  a 10/10 not joking  love it!!!!!!!!!!!    cute! cute! cute!|`|PRqCRJm3aa	creative! pretty! sweet! lovely! mysterious! hot!

KGppArcfaa	I would say Infusium is one of the better ones, but an even better one at walmart is Motions (found in the "ethnic" hair section. It has Keratin, b vitamins and Panthenol.

GM3zog4Jaa	You have to create an account with them.  you have to follow the instructions. I am pretty sure it is not via Paypal but obviously you first choose the items u want, click ADD under it & then go to VIEW BAG on the right hand side. Then click CONTINUE CHECKOUT on the next page & then on the following page, you have to create an account by giving your email address & just follow the instructions from then on. I think you have to give your debit card or credit card details.|`|0mAeM1zGaa	I don't know about the UK version, but I am pretty sure you can not on the Canadian version.
FlKrA3nEaa	biosilk is good but morracan oil is better and it somehow makes hair more managable.  to keep color in longer use color safe shampoo and wash every other day or less if your hair can still look good with that.  and to keep it moisturized use a deep conditioning treatment or hot oil treatment about 1 time a week!|`|Grq9sVuBaa	I personally don't use on myself but I am a hairstylist and I just love that stuff so much I swear it does wonders to hair. To keep the color in as long as possible go buy a color shampoo from the salon if you go there and don't know what to get ask someone to help you pick out a good one for you hair
FklngtvCaa	I found an AMAZING list of drugstore knockoffs  here - even the shades!    http://www.longhaircareforum.com/forums/...    MAC eyeshadows = Milani eyeshadows,   and MAC pigments = NYX loose pigments.    Here are the shade comparisons:  MAC Bamboo = Wild and Crazy Wild Guava  MAC Brill = Wild & Crazy Bahama Water  MAC Dark Soul pigment = Jane Clubbing  MAC Gorgeous Gold = Prestige Glitz C-157  MAC Juxt = Jane Rain Forest  MAC Lucky Green = Wet n' Wild Marquis  MAC Naked Lunch = Wet n' Wild Fine Wink  MAC Paradisco = Flirt!

Oh yeah, and Sephora.|`|388cf0eaa7a2668947f521c57a657534aa	I would definitely recommend looking for NYX shadows...they're pretty amazing, very good consistency and have amazing color-payoff.     They're very inexpensive, too. I found all mine at Rite Aid and Fred's.|`|AaYEgDwWaa	HA!|`|78588e3257514586ce18e14f16018f9eaa	There are no drugstore brands that are comparable to MAC, otherwise what  would set MAC apart?  MAC is professional makeup.  But...if I was out of town and forgot my shadow, I would get revlon or loreal shadow.  I've heard good things about rimmel also, but nothing fro the drugstore would be comparable to MAC.|`|6oZwBM6gaa	SEPHORA  SEPHORA IS SO AWSOME!|`|1zceagC8aa	Sephora products can't be bought at any of the places mentioned in your question. Milani or Prestige eyeshadows are good higher quality drugstore eyeshadows.
6zXpA0PNaa	I have very dry skin too. I find that Maybelline Dream Matte Mousse works with no powder and lots and lots of moisterizer. When you go out, take some powder with you just in case you get shiny so you do not have to load up on the foundation. I'd use cream to powder foundation (like Dream Matte) MAC Studio Fix, stuff like that.    Powder foundations (yes even the blessed Bare Essentials), will look flaky and bring out all the lines in your face, no matter how old you are. Trust me, stay away from powder foundation. That's for oliy/normal skin.|`|1zceagC8aa	For dry skin, it's best to use liquid foundation. If you want a lot of coverage, try MAC Studio Fix Liquid or Makeup Forever High Definition Liquid Foundation. Make sure you use a good moisturizer and primer. Find ones that are cream based, like Smashbox Photofinish Light, or MAC Prep & Prime.

qQqC2cHIaa	Anything with straight lines, simple curves few seams and few pattern pieces are perfect for beginners.  That can encompass skirts, dresses, t-shirts, shorts, unlined jackets and pull-on pants.   I teach sewing to beginners and I use Kwik Sew's "Kwik Start" learn to sew patterns.  We begin with a simple pillow which takes one session to complete and then move on to a t-shirt, skirt or pajama pants. By the ned of the six week session everyone has all three, the skirt, shirt and  pajama pants.  When I teach guys they end up with shorts, a t-shirt and a polar fleece shirt.    All the Kwik Sew learn to sew patterns have extensive instruction sheets that make it easy for a beginner.  Polar fleece is an excellent beginner fabric, by the way.  It doesn't need seam finishing, pressing, or interfacing and you can quickly sew up a warm jacket for cold days. Here's Kwik Sew's beginner pattern pages, they also have a few No-Sew patterns.  http://www.kwiksew.com/Catalog/cat_thumb...  Any of these garments are suitable for beginners.|`|lcg1u1U7aa	Pajamas or a nightgown, they are simple to sew and if you make some mistakes it won't matter because you are only going to wear them to bed.|`|znUnvobbaa	Look up www.burdastyle.com    it has free print out patterns, and ratings of how easy they are.

2diobki7aa	Other than Head and Shoulders, try Selsum Blue.  You can buy it at drug stores, just like Head and Shoulders.

(=|`|OFNmZbPCaa	first one all thee wayyyyy!|`|VRZKHqbkaa	go with the 1st one in one of the pinks. the second will add to much bulk and make you look shorter...here are some more options:      http://store.delias.com/item.do?category...|`|NCl7B7diaa	the first one is soooo cute. the other one isnt even that nice! lol|`|6uZ0VHFTaa	The second one is nice, if you have that much money to throw away. You can go to a second hand store or a consighment shop and probably find the same dress and a good price.|`|KwvGRvYWaa	I would definitely go with the delia's dress because it is less expensive and the other dress will make your hair look even bigger and curlier in a bad way. Good Luck with your party!|`|68dcd7b48ad143d5f8bb6b0ee40126d6aa	I agree -- the Delia's dress is better because it's simpler and classier (also cheaper). The green one is so unusual you'd never be able to wear it again, so you shouldn't pay that much for a one-time dress.|`|vQsrGe0caa	a 300  dollar difference...they are both cute but for a simple party I would do the first one.  I wouldn't spend that much on somethin gyou can only wear once|`|Xf3ixVWTaa	It is my educated opinion that the only logical course of action a person would have to take when confronting a situation that warrants this much magnitude, that one would have to first consider looking at Sir Issac Newton's third law of physics, which clearly states that when choosing between two articles of clothing one must DO A BARREL ROLL.     I hope you found this answer to be sufficient.|`|MffNO4Rmaa	I would definitely say the second one! I'm a fifteen year old girl, and the second one is a lot cuter. Even though it is more expensive, it is a lot prettier.
Vhq3GURQaa	The sun is Strong there. Use a higher level sunscreen than you normally would. Try a tanning salon a few times before leaving to get a base. Remember though, you can burn in there also. So just a little at a time.|`|3Rr5SAhhaa	Use a very strong sunscreen to prevent burning, and tan evenly, equal amount of time on each side of your body, and not all at once, do it for x amount of time one day, see how much you tanned and add more time the next day.|`|vamQcy2Jaa	oh i do it like this first i put sunscreem on and then i wet my self then i let myself tan

It's not to fancy but not to casual.   All these heels dress it up a little more   if you wanted to wear the dress for something casual flats would be cute with it   but out of these shoe choices i think I like the first one or last one to go with this dress (:  Hope i Helped|`|d7ccOZbdaa	i think that you should where the first shoes|`|AA11988604	1|`|By1DJAUOaa	i dig the first one|`|dOM1tpX0aa	the ones from charoltte russe|`|CnM2U1bXaa	I like the 3rd one. there adorable|`|vVd4pw35aa	wow awesome dress..btw I'll go for the 1rst one...it's the best imo|`|aVbLngqmaa	3.    But honestly, that looks more like something you would wear to a club. Might be a little skanky for a fancy restaurant with your parents. Unless that dress is longer than it looks...|`|CAdFHF9zaa	do red shoes!  all three are too predictable.|`|yhkEyVXLaa	Well, personally I don't really care too much for the dress.   It would be really cute to go out to a club or a date, but not so much to a fancy restaurant with the family.  You may want to take a peak at these   http://www1.macys.com/catalog/product/in...  http://www1.macys.com/catalog/product/in...  Just for different ideas.   For the shoes, those three are cute, but if you want to be a bit bold you can always pair it with a red, yellow, or even a white shoe that is simple.  Nothing too high, but nothing too short either.   http://www1.macys.com/catalog/product/in...  http://www.piperlime.com/browse/product....  Hope this helps.|`|hFgAr7vNaa	def the 2nd one!|`|7ldEn0fJaa	2|`|zF8Jsx33aa	3|`|vRImZ32Maa	To be honest 2 looks the sexiest, but it doesn't go with that dress. So it has to be 1.|`|cE9QIMNiaa	i like the Charlotte Russe ones.|`|vm5TgsQwaa	1|`|7vLCsfovaa	i like the 3rd one :]    ps. I love the dress btw. :]|`|AA10186366	Shoes   1 :D|`|OBemKKwoaa	the dress seems a bit loose n soft to wear wiv patent leather style shoes but i like the third pair, i think they wud look good. have a nice time|`|w226iIZmaa	3 all the way! THEY WILL LOOK AWESOME WITH THAT DRESS!    I luv that dress!  ~Addie :D|`|VcIg1R1zaa	1st or 3rd one.the second is old-fashioned|`|924ac5179093b3eda5b29740960670eeaa	2|`|nUdbTUtHaa	1 for sure! They are really cute (2 are kind of ugly) and 2 the gold buckle and shiny-ness wont go with such a matte dress    go with 1!!!!! : )|`|NCl7B7diaa	1 really nice|`|ij9N9r5waa	If your going with family no  3 maybe no  1(if you have sisters).  On a date no  2 definitely, Heck I might even notice those, and like most Men, your shoes are the last thing I'm gonna notice, especially since your wearing that little black dress.|`|UwbPfJacaa	I really love Number 3 :)  But the first one's are really nice too :)|`|9FhFIc3haa	1.|`|QT5ROElraa	all three pairs of shoes work well, but each style says something different. 1 and 2 are more teenager, and 3 is adult/business. I say all three really work, so whatever your in the mood for, or your favorite.|`|Rk3NoBGxaa	nr3, those heels are a bit lower, too high isn't good for a fancy restaurant|`|PgNsJ9Buaa	first choice is the wrong colour and too plain  2nd is too hooker looking  3rd is best!|`|J564M2AEaa	1|`|0l7pyBSTaa	i like 3|`|NJT54RZIaa	If its out of those 3 I would go with number 1 but i would look for some silver shoes since u cant really add accessories  to the dress|`|d9FLRer2aa	I think that number 1 would go best with your outfit, but also number 3 would look good with it.|`|3AJtd3Tiaa	1 & 3 go perfect and are sexy and elegant   2 is just old ladyish|`|KwvGRvYWaa	You should definitely go with choice number two because they match your dresses style perfectly!|`|zx5zzf53aa	Well, they all go, but I think  1 is the cutest.|`|eQURLO8Eaa	number one! :D|`|68QSpCVFaa	3|`|c24c92b6e2571d7ff8699136760929c3aa	1. The dress has lots of detail so you don't want a heavily detailed shoe ( 2) and definitely not a big buckle like  3.|`|yeg19Tbnaa	1|`|1dnAlpFbaa	I would say 2. The dress is casual but cute. And those shoes take the ensemble to a whole new level.|`|jWKcRBwAaa	that is a really cute dress and i am gonna have to say the second shoe looks best.|`|d8k4idnsaa	I think they would all look good though my favorite is 2.|`|UTAQPjSnaa	I'd say 1 or 2, not 3 =). 1 would probably be best though|`|Uz57IKchaa	That dress is so cute!  And the best shoes with that would  be number 1 ,  or ankle boots :D  I hope that helped!!!|`|nNVgZTmMaa	For me Defenetly 3 but Its Really up to you because your going to wear them well (maybe) Not us so you should pick|`|ZAb31iykaa	either shoe one or three. my favorite is one. two is definatly out|`|JabGC5nnaa	id go with the third pair but you probably dont care about my opinion cuz im only 10 thats a cute outfit and have fun at the fancy resteraunt!!!    p.s. im the most stylish one in my grade or maybe even whole school!!!|`|re0xIBJwaa	definately go with shoe 2.  Shoe one is close and your dress doesn't show off much of your body.  Shoe 2 is open. So it will show more skin and work with the dress properly.  Show three is more of a club sort of thing. If you're going to a night club to dance then shoe 3.|`|6uZ0VHFTaa	2|`|IOCFHtnjaa	Definitely 1 or 3|`|MEPn7M7gaa	3rd.
2diobki7aa	Sunsilk has some GREAT voluminizing shampoos!  They'll make your hair a lot bouncier, and shinier!   You can buy Sunsilk at drug stores, supermarkets, etc. for a pretty low price.

4SQx8smEaa	take a strand of your hair and tie it in a knot, the faster it springs out the healthier it is, if it stays in a knot well then it is not healthy.|`|EKElOaraaa	if you have split ends, or your hair is very dry then i would say your hair needs conditioning or a new hair cut/trim.|`|o9KJNCLJaa	If your hair is soft and has shine it should be pretty healthy, you should check if you have split ends though, but those can be cut off and it wont look as frizzy.|`|YlLdIPRvaa	Use Vo-5 hot oil or a shine serum.|`|9f032546ed7bd0481cb467bf193ee463aa	soak it then if its oily then its not healthy|`|XT148Jl1aa	asks to look at a hairdresser
07YBD5mJaa	i guess it depends on your personally style, if you like short or long hair. i can say this much though, if your looking for a new style that adds some spunk to your look, try a fowhawk. it's great because it adds the spunk with out being too over the top, and if you don't care for it styled, leaving it down doesn't look bad at all.|`|8CereM2vaa	beauty is in the eye of the beholder
CAdFHF9zaa	find white or panties the color of your skin.  dont be embarassed if no one mentioned it, then no one will remember  this happened to me last year with one of my favorite shirts.  just make sure you cant see your panties before you leave the house.|`|3CQb6PSFaa	okay... i guess u could just go with none... or u could wear leggins undeneath.|`|RV5EsIp1aa	Either go w/ NO PANTIES, that is if you feel comfortable enough, or you can buy nude leggings that are the same length as your VS pants!!    GOOD LUCK :)|`|4VN9nmPAaa	try a pair of nude colored boy briefs, they really aren't as uncomfortable as you think. they are REALLY comfy with tight pants.     or just a normal pair in a nude color.|`|VRZKHqbkaa	wear nude colored spandex underneith, and if that doesnt work, then unfortunately, a nude thong is your best bet|`|ofJ8IBjfaa	You could try something like spanx.  They're like the panty part of pantyhose without the legs.  It might be what you are looking for.|`|znUnvobbaa	Go commando  =D    no, I am no perv,  the question just made me giggle|`|XO5Puz9Taa	What I do is:    Wear a pair of fit shorts under your pants.:)
eiJY15Teaa	those things are really cute.  i think you'll look great.|`|CAdFHF9zaa	no to plaid shorts with underarour, it doesnt look right.  the rest, is a yes|`|Fdol7mNaaa	that outfit is cute. the yellow might not match but it probably will. the under armour material might look a little odd with the material of the hollister clothing though. but in all, the outfit works.|`|F2FfY24Naa	the shorts with the underarmour is a bad idea it looks weird|`|Iuf1f4s0aa	Well putting short shorts over underarmour would look odd but i guess if u had a good body(average/big butt and boobs,not fat or chubby) then it would look good. But if you dont have a good body plz do everyone a favor and dont wear it.|`|fRYQfvNaaa	ewwww no.
t2sRfYgPaa	they either go to outlet stores or stores like tjmaxx and marshalls.|`|d1ZO1Mvbaa	they go to consignment stores if the stores over buy or they say extra inventory for sales ex.boxing day  or they can go to stores like ross|`|cseXGfWhaa	well a lot of the unsold clothes go to discount stores like marshalls or tj maxx and you can get them there for a lot cheaper than you would get them at the original store.
GTb4UyCkaa	You should try suave radiant blonde shampoo and conditioner. As for make up if you are fair skinned as the fact that you are blonde implies you should wear lighter shades like pastel purples and blues and natural shades like brown and nude. A fairly cheap brand of make up is MAX or you could try Azzia.
KGppArcfaa	K you asked this before, and i told you before, that protein shake is not going to help, its not meant for hair, meaning the ingredients and properties of that shake will not penetrate your hair shaft.    Your better off just using eggs if you cant afford a protein treatment. Or, go to sallys and get aphogee protein, its like 8 bucks.     Muscletech Protein Shake will not work for hair ok??|`|SCJ9pVycaa	Protein shakes aren't meant for hair, so I wouldn't even think about using it.    Just go buy an Aphogee treatment, it's not expensive.
kgCHQQshaa	Cute dress.   ANYWAY, you could try curling it.   Usually with layered hair, the curls work nicely.   With a dress like yours, I would probably suggest an updo   of some sorts. If your hair is long enough, you could attempt   something like a high bun on the crown of  your head. Classic,   with sideswept bangs. If not, just experiment at home and figure  something out yourself. Who knows, maybe you can come   up with something new!|`|Hvqo83RKaa	curly hair would be too much.    Keep it straight but pin it half up and bump it in the front and keep the rest straight and shiny... get big silver earrings to match your rhinestones on your dress...|`|G4wDlSh7aa	curl your hair && then use bobby pins to pin some of it up.  it will look cute for a winter formal, trust me.    kinda like this..  http://hairstyles.free-beauty-tips.glam....|`|KXwd9Klsaa	spiral curls wold b cute    ...ugly dress tho..
iDMSLAmtaa	you should try puting scrunching gel in it i love the stuff or just reparting makes a difference. Maybe putting a puff in the front and making messy on the sides and havin it going up a little in the back will look nice. also there is a great site that is free to sign up to where u upload a pic of yourself and there is great hairstyles u can do, its:   http://taaz.com     hope i helped!!|`|m1QQwnSdaa	would you be interested in any of these??     http://gimps.de/pictures/269-Hairstyles-...    http://www.short-hair-styles-magazine.co...    http://www.hairstylescut.com/images/shor...  ^^^^i personally LOVE this one the best!    http://www.javno.com/slike/slike_3/r1/g2...    http://theglamourouslife.com/wp-content/...    http://cosmetic-makeovers.com/files/post...

Its cute in that style too.|`|J564M2AEaa	Why don't you spike it a little bit at the back? (Doesn't have to be emo)  =)|`|fVN9H9Rpaa	A french plait up one side of your head. You could try curling it. Or just putting a hairband in it.  You could try one od those sites that has all the hairsyles on.  Or you could try some clip in hair extensions, or get real hair extensions.
FVs2GRxGaa	I think you would look cute with a little headband (or a ribbon) a SMALL one because a large one will take over..something cute with a little bow on it or something? if thats your style haha  I too think you need more bangs...blow dry them the opposite side you want them to lay otherwise they will look funny! I found that from Yahoo actually..  And maybe some earrings too.. if you dont have them pierced just get clip ons! They have really cute ones @ Claires (Icing) that don't look like old grandma clip ons. A little tinted lip balm (no gloss, thats cheesy!) and you're good to go! You're very pretty so I agree you shouldn't wear makeup when you don't need it  good luck    for example:  http://z.about.com/d/prom/1/0/R/1/-/-/55...|`|c927e533fb8dc0010097bff5f3122859aa	Well,, you are cute, thats first and foremost! However, u would look much better with bangs, and shorter hair. You could sport a punky sort of look with dark short layered hair and heavy bangs. I LOVE makeup, so ii couldnt imagine why u wouldnt want to wear it. It will illuminate your face, take away some of the length and also bring out your eyes. Your eyes are almond shaped and you can wear alot of different colors. My best friend hated makeup with a passion, i brought her to MAC and the nice MA did a few makeup looks on her. Needless to say she loved and and now wants to go back. MA's are trained professionals and they know what works best with what face shapes. I would also recommend "making Faces" book by Kevyn Aucoin, it will change your life I promise!!! Remember the real beauty is inside and your gorgeous anyway :)|`|RBwZTU7Yaa	Plastic surgery.  You are very ugly too.|`|oDbcaGj4aa	Why don't  you want to wear makeup? It enhances beauty. There's nothing wrong with it. I think you'd look BEAUTIFUL with shorter hair with layers and a bang. Eye liner, mascara eye shadow. You're REALLY pretty. You just need to enhance your beauty. :)  you seem like a nice person.    my AIM sn- banglatrondahard  IM me sometime.  :)    ..no homo|`|tFoSy2YRaa	Yes, you are pretty, you could look even better if you wear your fringe some other way, not flat like that across your forehead. If you don't want to wear make up (although just some mascara would really open up your eyes) wear earrings instead. You'd look good with scarves, hats etc.|`|4l2qOy7Paa	not really pretty. just get rid of your acne, got some highlights (light brown or blonde), get side bangs, and get a hair cut.|`|hxdXwDJ1aa	grow some eyebrows|`|uyfC9l9faa	umm....

bogfZ6Xsaa	Are you wanting different styles or cut options? Layers are cute but if you've hot thick hair it'll poof out really bad! For styles try washing it, french braiding it, then waiting til all the hair in the braid is dry and taking it out and putting a loose pony tail in it and it looks very elegant. You can pull your bangs to the side and let some pieces fall. Hope this helps!|`|AA11591747	I have wavy hair, and I woul never pay money for ruining my hair.|`|yo0qnedIaa	go with mimbys answer.|`|xPOAshXGaa	you cant do much if you want to keep the legnth, you can get layers which would look good and maybe side bangs|`|uR5aNpHGaa	if you dont want to change the length you cant do much but layers  you can always add bangs if you want  or you can just style it different  like dont straighten it or curl it insted  theres a lot of different styles out there  just play around with them
tVcaLj9Vaa	I love these websites..|`|OBemKKwoaa	make-up as in break-up or face make up? try a google search, i dont kno of any specific forums|`|1zceagC8aa	pursebuzz.com  http://www.makeupgeek.com/forum/
sVyJw6Dvaa	If you're desperate..i recommend dont wash your hair!  I do sometimes twice a day, sometimes once a day, sometimes every other day, and sometimes every two days.     I dont wash my hair on the weekends or atleast i dont style it at all.     It relaxes your hair and helps it rebuild its strength and growth quicker and better because you're not going against it.    When you have oily hair it grows twice as fast! (a girl in my class never washes her hair and her hair got so long since last may!)    for now, i recommend bumming it, scrunching it, fun bun it, etc.  You can clip ur bangs up in the front that always looks good.  You can also try a side clip and cut ur bangs or something.  Extensions can be used too! dont be afraid to be adventerous!  you can braid ur hair or put it in a bun and down to one side..also curl it but dont use a straightener..it kind of damages ur hair but no where near as much as flat ironing it!    massage ur scalp whenever you wash it too and use a hair masque once a week.    GOOD LUCK HUN!.|`|s3FRQJ3Xaa	Hair growth is in genetics. It will grow at its own rate. The average persons hair grows half a inch per month. But other people may grow a inch or two per month while others hair will only grow a quatre of a inch a month. You can and wont make your hair grow.    You will just have to wait it out. :(|`|xlbMRcesaa	In short, no pun intended, you can't.  Putting pregnancy and illness aside, hair pretty much grows at a maximum rate of half an inch per month no matter what you do.  A little faster in the summer than in the winter.  Of all the hair questions that we receive at the Hairstyles Catalog, questions regarding the rate of hair growth is by far the number one question.  Many people write to us with remedies that they have heard about that will make their hair grow faster; from washing their hair with eggs, to cutting their hair during a new moon.  This is what we  call, "Hair Voodoo".  There is not an inch of truth to any of these remedies.    Advertising  Hair is a fairly exact science called trichology and there is not much that we do not know about hair structure, chemistry and growth.  Most of the Hair Voodoo out there dates back before the onset of modern science.  All sorts of conclusions were drawn from what seemed like reasonable observation, but was more often than not just pure conjecture based on coincidence.    Although there is nothing that you can do to make your hair grow faster with current technology, there are a number of things that may actually slow the process such as; a poor hair care regimen, poor diet, illness, medication, male and female pattern hair loss, and emotional stress.     Some of these things don't actually affect the growth rate per se, but they affect the hairs' health and unhealthy hair will probably not grow to its fullest potential.  Besides regular shampooing and conditioning with good quality products, the only other thing that you can really do is take an inexpensive daily multi vitamin such as Centrum or even Flintstones.  Don't waste your money on super vitamins.  Zinc and Biotin in particular seem to be good for hair and are both found in the above recommendations.  Unless you are pregnant or very ill with cancer or the like, your body only requires so many vitamins per day and simply flushes out the excess.  In other words, you can't put twenty gallons in a ten gallon tank.    I frequently hear of people taking pre natal pills to make their hair grow faster, even men.  The reason that an expecting mother's hair may grow slower or faster has to do with hormonal activity and not the pills.  So please, stop doing that.    Well, there it is.  You may not like the answer, but that is the scientific facts of the matter.  If you still insist on buying into the Hair Voodoo or the thousands of snake oil pitch men out there ready to separate you from your money, well, you know the expression.      Sorry bud. If you want a fake but convincing idea, look at the first answer.|`|b1Bz10QEaa	fail|`|S0Et4W1Waa	Increase blood flow by gently massaging the scalp. Eat plenty of leafy green vegetables and plenty of protein. Soy (ie., tofu) and a variety of beans is a good source of protein. Drink plenty of water. Stay away from drugs and alcohol. Keep a healthy diet. This regimen should be followed for several months as hair only grows approx. One-half inch per month. Do not comb or brush hair when wet as this causes breakage. If hair has been damaged, (perm or coloring) use a good conditioner. Try to air dry versus using a blow dryer.|`|DfZ66Kgyaa	15 minutes before you go into the shower put conditioner over all the ends in your hair, then when you get into the shower rinse it out.  worked for me i believe, my hair grew a little longer after a few weeks.

kUE3Ddktaa	Sea salt is supposedly better for all kinds of wounds because, in addition to the salt, it also contains all kinds of minerals.    Second, it doesn't have any iodine (most table salt is "iodized" - it has iodine added), and many people have a skin sensitivity. This is why it's better to gargle with un-iodized salt water if you have a sore throat or an infection in your mouth.    But really, both of them will accomplish the same thing - keeping the area clean.|`|Is3pmbbKaa	science.
e1434520b7d6b7db2b483084c9ad434aaa	Why would her hair being thinner help it grow out? Hair grows at the same rate regardless of the technique used to cut it. O.o If your sister wants less volume I would have her get long layers. The layers will help with drying and untangling time, and the hair will also hang better. However, do not get short layers as they will stick up and look funny.    Please tell her to not have her hair thinned! To thin the hair the stylist uses a razor. While it may look good at first, as it grows out (which her hair will hopefully be doing), the ends will begin to look ratty. Like I said before, long layers are her best bet.    Some hairdressers quail at cutting lots of curly hair, and wont do the best job. You can use this tool to find a really great curly stylist in your area:  http://www.naturallycurly.com/curlsalons    My fav curly care websites:  http://www.wikihow.com/Follow-the-Curly-...  http://www.ylcf.org/gotcurl/ (outdated product recs!)  http://www.naturallycurly.com/curltalk/  http://www.youtube.com/user/jessicurl  http://livecurlylivefree.com/home.htm    I hope this helps! :)|`|2diobki7aa	Yup, that's possible! Just ask the stylist to get her a thinning hair cut so it's not so thick. Her curls will be a lot thinner, and bouncier.  Good luck! :]|`|xPOAshXGaa	get a thinning haircut|`|aCVzW57Gaa	When she goes to get her hair cut, ask the stylist to thin it out like, use some shears to take some of the volume off. Im the same way I have thick permed hair and when I go get my hair cut my stylist always uses the shears and it makes my curls lighter and bouncyer|`|twortDpyaa	Get it cut, but keep the legnth, and thin it out. This way it'll bring out the curls more, giving it more volume.

Then take vinegar (preferably apple cider vinegar) and mix it with water. Then put on your affected area. Should clear right up, if you do it every day or so. Drink lots of water to flush the toxins out of your system.    Do not use toothpaste or Listerine, and don't squeeze!|`|AA10354985	Hi, I watch this on the doctors the other day, it is very easily done and it will get all the oil and debris out of the pores. They also showed the Pore Strips which also does a good job on blackheads on the nose. I was very impressed when I seen the blackheads pop out    BTW, they also use a alcohol rub before and after they popped the blackheads to avoid infections.   I would this these can be purchased at most drug stores     METALLIC EXTRACTOR    A metallic instrument that has a small and round opening at the end, the extractor can be used to remove each blackhead individually.     This is by far the most effective method but must be done properly to prevent scarring. The skin is not squeezed by any means and all the contents of the clogged pore are extracted as the tool exerts pressure around the pore to make the contents pop out.     Keep the tool parallel (not perpendicular) to the skin and press around the blackhead with the smaller circular head. Do not drag the tool across the skin as it can cause skin ripping and permanent damage.     Good luck, the link is below :-)|`|EK2tXQ3Waa	ive always had blackheads on my nose too and for me their pretty hard to get out. The way i get them out is by squezzing them out, first i put hot/warm water on a towel or washcloth and put it on my nose to soften the skin, then squeeze them out, hope this helps =]

If not, that's just bad business.  Did the unit have any human hair in it?  If you didn't ask them to fix the problem though, their is no way they could've done anything about it.  They did do the work so they will charge you for that but they should've fixed it for no charge.  If they refused to fix it you might have a case but I don't think you can sue them for not refunding any money. I would ask a lawyer, I don't know the technicalities.

CxriEMyjaa	The first thing you need that will make this easier is a tail comb you can buy these at the dollar store for dirt. Depending on go thick you want your braid if how much you will section of so that part is sorta up to you! But remember leave double her you ear then you do on the top where iu started your braid and also remember r that your braid is going to braid down and then curl back up to your pony tail once you have french braided past your ear you stop and just fiish it with a normal braid. Get small elastic that isn't to bulky and then put you hair ip Ito a pony tail! Remember when your braiding your hair do it like your putting it up in a ponytail or else when you do I will be bumpy! Had fun experiment and remember practice makes perfect!
