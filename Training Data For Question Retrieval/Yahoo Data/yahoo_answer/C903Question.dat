Is now the time or should I be thankful I am getting a dismal 1.85%APY from ING?      It seems to me the government has proven they will not be letting auto-makers and banks go under by providing bailout money. Should we be buying Ford or GM like crazy?       Even Freddie and Fannie. We have already witnessed their bailouts. Why not buy their stocks at 50 cents and sit on it long term? Is it wrong to think these companies will not be back in the $10-$20-$30 dollar range again?       I'm not trying to make a quick dollar, I am looking long term.

My husband's salary is not enough. We spent all of our savings and got  family help but this month if we make our 1390 dollars payment we will have zero dollars for two weeks till my husband gets paid. Countrywide said there is no help for ppl like us. We can't sell, even the houses by us listed didn't sell. We owe more than what the house is worth. Countrywide is probably interested in us foreclosing. It seems like foreclosure is the clue but I don't want to screw up our great credit we worked so hard for and even our house where we had our son and all the beautiful memories! All we want is lower our payment for a year or two till we get back on track. Have you ever heard something like this? Is teh help only for people with variable rates?

20070204183414AAaWcUf	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Cleared eviction?	Hello, I have been renting at the same place for 5 years, but when I first started living here in 2002, the company which I worked for didn't pay me for 2 months.  So I had an eviction on my lease, however, I then started working for another company and paid the rent right way.  The eviction was no longer in effect, and I haven't had any problems ever since.  OK, so I want to move now, but I'm not sure if I'll get approved.  I even have proof from the courthouse, stating that the eviction has been cleared.  I'm a little unsure beacuse I've applied for one place and didn't get it, because of this.  Anybody knows if someone will ever approve me, or if it'll be too hard?? Thanks!!

We live near Atlanta, so we have Hartsfield nearby. I was curious, so I began looking up schools and such on the internet, but I'm a little overwhelmed as I know next to nothing on the subject. So, I have a few questions.    What kind of schooling does he need?    Does he have to major in aviation or aeronautics, and does it have to be a four-year degree?    If he needs a degree, should his schooling come before or after flight school?    Should he start small with local airfields and small planes?    I think that covers everything I want to know. Any additional help or tips would be wonderful. Thank you.

Voilà, je m'explique, j'ai été licenciée en juillet 2006, jusque là tout normal, sauf que j'ai trouvé le licenciement plus qu'abusif. Donc j'ai contacté les prud'hommes, j'ai une avocate, le procès doit avoir lieu au mois de septembre... Il y a 15 jours j'ai re?u les pièces de la partie adverse et bien, ce sont des mails et des courriers que ma chère et tendre collègue adorée a fait dans mon dos pour me dénoncer sur les conneries qu'elle avait fait elle ! En gros, elle fait passer ses boulettes sur mon dos. De plus, les mails sont falsifiés grossièrement. J'étais en prestation de service dans une société mais la société cliente n'a absolument rien contre moi, au contraire, ils sont tristes que je sois partie et mon ancien employeur refuse les attestations de la société cliente. Donc j'aimerais savoir, qu'est ce que je peux faire contre ce nana qui me pourrie la vie depuis mon licenciement et mon embauche (mai 2005) et le pire je n'ai rien vu venir de la part de cette petite arrogante.

20090227035505AA9Wxdc	Business & Finance;Corporations	Sir Fred Goodwin's pension - par for the course ?	It's a funny old world where total failure is rewarded with a ￡650000 a year pension. But in refusing to give up or cut his pension, Sir Fred is only acting in pattern with present big-business culture. The market says you're worth what you can get; markets have nothing to do justice or need. Sir Fred has got his pension perfectly legally under market rules. His case is symptomatic of the whole attitude of big business to money-making. An ethically more sensitive man might feel obliged to give up some of the money but he's only doing what the law and business culture allow. 'It's the system' - truth in a cliche.

20090227043046AAudGEd	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	How do i get out of a joint tenancy agreement?	Hi. I am desperate..I am living in this house where we have a joint tenancy agreement that we sign every year, right.!!.we signed last in october 08, but there have been lots of problems, for a few months, i had always pay my rent on time, and the bills, etc, but the rest of the ttenantsare making the run of the house difficult, by not paying on time,or by ddisappearingjust without paying, etc,etc,,in the past, i have taken care and look for a new replacement for other rooms, since nobody else moved a finger, even though i don't think is just my rresponsibility we have been robed by thiefs braking into the house   two months ago, the thing is, i am tired of problems, scared of living there, etc, i am thinking about moving out and finding a replacement for my room..but i just want to know..lets say..that this flatmate has left without paying the rent,(one flatmate just told us that is living this weekend and the rent is the 8th) but the landord has his deposit, obviously this month rent would be short unless we find a replacemente by the day rent is due..anybody know what would happens if we, the rest of tennants don't pay that rent(by contract we are liable)..i suppose the state agent that runs the house, could take us to court, how long would that take? or i suppose the the state agent could simply tell us to leave the house, which is fine by me..someone has been in a situation like this before? someone knows what would happen? someone knows something about a situation like this? thanks

20090227043609AAwtfUF	Business & Finance;Taxes;United States	Whats really going on with my DD/ IRS refund? Code 152?	It was accepted on 2/5/then my DD was 2/20 then nothing came I called they said there was a error but but it was corrected and released and sent back to processing which changed my DD to 3/6-3/10.I called today 2/27 and why is it Still saying its processing? How long will that take/and will it be done by the new Dd of 3/6? I spoke to the operator and she said there looks to be no other problems its just not done processing. But I used Rapid Tax so I feel there should have been no problems to start that's why I used them instead of doing them myself! Last thing she said was that because the last time I filled taxes was for2002 and now again for2008 they needed to make sure of who I was? Sounds Weird but this is what I was told.

20090227043855AAlFcni	Business & Finance;Credit	Is it possible to get a personal loan to use as a deposit on a house?	I.e. You need a 10% deposit to get a mortgage so are you able to get a loan to do this? I'm on just over ￡40k a year with little out goings (apart from rent) but even saving ￡500 a month it will take 3 or 4 years to get a 20% deposit. I can afford the repayments easily (especially joint with my GF who is non ￡26k). However, it's just the deposit that's the problem!

20081118070144AAj9PJ4	Business & Finance;Other - Business & Finance	I am incompetant at my job?	I was hired for a job at which I was underqualified.  I think they picked me because I would be cheaper than someone with an MBA.      I am totally out of my depth.      The problem is   1.  I really need the job   2. If I quit I suspect they would put someone even worse.  I accepted the low pay because I love the work.  (it is charity related)    For what they are paying they are getting something OK I guess.  No person with the MBA/Legal & IT skills needed would accept the pay, I guess unless they were like me and doing it for the love of it, but I can easily see them just putting a relative in or something which would be    out of the frying pan, into the fire.      What do I do, please.  I don't even know where to start.      Thanks for answers.

My last day there is 4/25.  After my last day, I'll be receiving severance pay for 5 weeks.  So I'll be getting a check every other week, just like I was if I was at work.  I thought it was just gonna be one huge sum but it's not.  Which is better since less taxes will be taken out.  Anyway, my question is can I file for unemployment the day after I leave my job or do I have to wait 'til after the 5 weeks before I can file?  I live in Illinois by the way.  I know each state is probably different.
