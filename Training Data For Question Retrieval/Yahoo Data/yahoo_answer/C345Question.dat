20090128220133AAeb1yv	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	A joke about snooty man and innocent girl.  Do you like it?	A stranger was seated next to a little black girl on the airplane when the stranger turned to her and said, "Let's talk. I've heard that flights go quicker if you strike up a conversation with your fellow passenger."   The little girl, who had just opened her colouring book, closed it slowly and said to the stranger, "What would you like to talk about?""   Oh, I don't know," said the stranger. "Since you are a *****, do you think that so-called President Elect Barak Obama is qualified for the job?" and he smiles.    "OK", she said. 'That could be an interesting topic. But let me ask you a question first. A horse, a cow, and a deer all eat the same stuff â€“ grass yet a deer excretes little pellets, while a cow turns out a flat patty, and a horse produces clumps of dried grass.  Why do you suppose that is?"    The stranger, visibly surprised by the little girl's intelligence, thinks about it and says, "Hmmm, I have no idea."    To which the little girl replies, "Do you really feel qualified to discuss President Barak Obama... when you don't know ****?"

20090128215040AAUwaDg	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	Early 1990 MTV with a black man running dry landscape?	Around 1990/1991 time frame, European MTV channel often played this MTV. The song was pretty popular in Europe at least; this song was more like a disco-like pop song --- I am primarily a soft rock person but I liked MC Hammer's "U can't touch this" and Vanilla Ice's "Ice Ice Baby", that would be about as far as my range is.      I believe the singer is a young female, who is a Columbia University alumni. In fact, while applying to Columbia University (for 1992 fall entrance), its brochure mentioned her name while talking about its people and its neighbourhood.      The MTV is probably done purposely in black/white. The most vivid memory of this MTV is a a black model, good muscle tone, wearing only white sport pants / loose pajama.... then running across dry landscape (could be dessert or dried riverbed kind of landscape), to the beat / rhythm of the music. The running footage was probably played back in slower motion than real time, so maybe like each step would take up 2 seconds of music...      I imagine the music itself would be suitable for disco.      I hope I remember it right, but the opening of the song went like this      da (long) la (short) (pause) (pause) da (long) la (short) (pause) (pause)   Then repeat slightly faster   Repeat above again....    then rest of song      I have tried googling around on and off, trying to see if any singer of that period is a graduate of Columbia university, without any success.       My brain is telling me her first name is Susan, but that could be totally wrong.      I know this is like, eh, 1 in a billion long shot... By any chance, anyone knows this music?  Thanks for any help.

20090128231552AAeqlEh	Entertainment & Music;Comics & Animation	Some Bleach questions?	Alright, so when humans die, they go to Soul Society.  Rukia is a good example of this, as she died as an infant in the human world.  Now here are the questions.        How are people born in Soul Society if you have to die in order to go there?  Hitsugaya was born in Soul Society for example, but characters like Rukia were not.        How are families maintained in Soul Society?  The Kuchiki family, for example, has been a noble family in Soul Society for many years.  Were they all born in Soul Society?  Are they all actually related?        Do you enter Soul Society at the age you died at (I'm assuming you do), but if this is true, how would people's bodies who died of old age survive in Soul Society?  Appearance-wise, would an elderly person look elderly once they go to Soul Society, or any age group for that matter?       I don't expect there to be an explanation for everything Kubo Tite creates, but I was just wondering if these things have been explained or answered.  Thanks!

20090128230341AA5TFtV	Entertainment & Music;Comics & Animation	Zodiac and Robot Wars Anime?	there are these 2 animes i've been trying to think of the name.      Zodiac Anime involved kids who wore zodiac armor, and if i'm correct each one had the ability of the zodiac. i believe it use to come on saturdays but i'm not certain. I don't think its Knights/Warriors of the Zodiac.      Also there is this other one, it reminded me of Gundam Wing/Seed, there are these robots that would go one on one with each other to determine which robot is the better. There wasn't really a war going on line in the Gundam series. Also i think they only took place on land, but i'm not certain. Also i believe one of the robots went from one color to turning gold like it turned Super Saiyan or something. I don't think its Super Robot Wars OG. Its just like Robot Jox, only in anime form.

She decided to kill herself. She heard somewhere   that the best way to kill yourself is by shooting the heart.   She decided to try that, but she didn't know where the heart   was. So, she went to her doctor and asked him where the   heart was. He told her that it was just below her left breast.   Later that night, the old lady was brought into the emergency   room with a bullet wound to her knee.

"Oh, yes: does anyone want to ask me anything?"      A different boy raises his hand and says, "I have three questions:       First, why did you invade Iraq without support from the U.N.?       Second, Why did the recess bell go off 20 minutes early?       And third, where the hell is Billy?"

But he had been president of the United States and not Earth (or at least there's no mention of Nixon having been president of Earth at any time before he wins in that election in Futurama).  Why is that?  Is it just a mistake?  Does this mean that the United States is Earth (through gradually accepting admissions for statehood from every country in the world)?

He gets plastered, and spends the night "dancing with himself". One concert-I believe it was a Deep Purple and Dio lineup- he was at the top of the hill on the yard. He had a beer in each hand. Dio starts to belt out "Holy Diver" and the drunk takes a dive, literally, off the hill...rolling down, knocking into people. Then he gets up, like nothing happened, and starts dancing again. Wow.

I got asked recently to play lead guitar in a concert in a weeks time, although I've never played lead guitar before. I have a few questions which may seem simple to experienced lead guitarists but are way out for me!   1) are pedals necessary? I'm only playing 2 songs   2) before a solo, should I turn my volume up and then down again after or leave it as it is?   3) do I play chords throughout the songs (apart from the solos) or infill with some riffs?   4) I'm playing some classic rock stuff and some alternative rock stuff, would I need a different tonal quality and how would I achieve this?      Sorry if these are simple questions. But I've never really played an electric guitar and it's all alien to me. The technique isn't the question, it's just the set up.   Thanks for your help!
20090225154615AAEkBCs	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	What do you think of my plans?	At present I still have to work for around 70 hrs. weekly to bring home the bigger part of the bacon. Sorry, there is no other solution so far.   But I may well contribute, telling you what I will do for my wife when Iâ€²ll retire from work in the near future. We have made plans already:      I will completely take over the housework: cooking, doing the laundry, cleaning and much more. While she will still have to work for some years.   She will be the head of the household: With her name she will be responsible in the outside world, including the registration of our house,   water supply, electricity, telephone, revenue payment, and bank account (only one account, on her name). We shall have one car only which is on her name, and she will take the driverâ€²s seat.   She likes to wear the pants in the relationship. So I will stay home  24/7, being her male housewife.   Breakfast will be ready when she gets up in the morning, and Iâ€²ll wait for her with lunch ready when she comes back from work in the evening. Iâ€²ll spoil her as much as I can, giving a massage, perhaps painting her nails, doing her hair, and who knows...what may follow?    But she will have the last say in all important decisions.   I will give back to her much of what she has done for me in earlier years.   But I think I could not be described as a "slave", although I am serving, being in the supportive role. One thing is certain: We will both love it when she is in charge. We will examine if it is possible that I take her name in the marriage, correcting the error we have made earlier, doing it the other way, now making a statement to others.

Recently I've been listening to alot of 80s music such as David Bowie, Boy George, Wham, Elton John etc.... And guess what? I find out that each and every one of them is gay!

20090128225615AA9EF8K	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	Rest In Peace Billy Powell?	R.I.P Billy Powell.      As a young man in Jacksonville FL, I was in my senior year of high school at Andrew Jackson HS, the rival of Robert E Lee HS where the boys from Skynyrd met and had gym with coach Leonard Skinner. A friend who was working for the Nassau Country Sheriff had tickets to a concert at Fernandina Beach High School that was reported to feature 38 Special, and Lynyrd Skynyrd. No one believed it as Skynyrd had been a no show previously at a concert at city stadium then known as the Gator Bowl.    Hundreds of kids were milling around the school waiting, and then two buses rolled in carrying both bands and a mad scramble ensued to the ticket office. It seems that this was a fund raiser for a man who was running for sheriff of the county, His name was E.C. VanZant and was a candidate in that race. He was the uncle of Ronnie and Donnie VanZant, the front men for Skynyrd and 38 Special.    What a night. No way could they set up with all of the amps and speakers of a normal concert. But it was unbelievable.      We lost a legend today. According to local reports, it is unsure what will become of the band. From the reports, all members are in shock and grieving the loss of a brother.      Keep Skynyrd in your thoughts and prayers.      Post your thoughts and experiences here.

It was satirized on an episode of Family Guy. In the episode of Family Guy, they made light of the excessive length of this particular TV theme song.       The song goes like this, for example:      "Jen-NIF-er WARD, eating BA-gels with JE-sus."      It would then repeat a number of things that various people spend their time doing.      I REALLY need to know which TV show this song opened up for.      Thanks.

20090129020935AAnkOL6	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Whats the worst bad thing you have ever done?	Mine would be when I was in 9th grade, this kid brought his video camera to school and you know I was stupid an I thought to myself "hmm.." I was like how much do you want for it? an he said some price and I was like ok my friend wants to buy it. Knowing that my friend didnt really want to buy it, off the top of my head I was thinking as long as he doesnt think i want it then whats the problem? He brought it the next day and when he got up the kid next to me helped me get the camera. I put it down my pants lol. He came back an he looked right at me, i said what i didnt do anything? then the bell rang and he kept hassling me an everyones like dude step off, just cause you lost your camera doesnt mean you gotta accuse someone. At this point i was home free, the kid was to much of a wimp to do anything. I brought it home an I realised I had no charger! I looked it up on the internet an they were a freaking fortune! Next day I told him my friend bought a camera but he doesnt have a charger (i cant belive he fell for this) then he was like man somebody stole my camera. For some reason he brought the charger anyways...well this time I took it and it was middle of class so this time he could get me in trouble. I had basketball shorts on an it looked like i had no pockets even tho i did. I stashed it in there! I made a big scene so it looked liek i got something stolen from me too. Walked out of class with a camera and the charger!

The mom has a problem with the homeless kid being there, the dad doesn't. I recall they both like the same girl...but she ends up with the nice kid and I think the homeless one leaves.

20090129011704AAdYO9a	Entertainment & Music;Horoscopes	I dont understand my Cancer Horoscope 2day, can u help me?	Your fantasy of going on an adventure grows larger in scope today. In fact, it could become so inflated that for a moment you actually believe that anything is possible and that you can go absolutely anywhere you please. But then something happens in your immediate environment to remind you that you aren't as free as you wish. Instead of wallowing in discouragement, scale back your vision to a more pragmatic level and then begin to make a plan to realize your dream.      Can u explain this for me?

20090128153236AAGEopV	Entertainment & Music;Movies	I just watched The Shining..(very long with alot of questions)...?	and I'm confused. haha. First of all let me sttart out by saying I'm 15 and never read the book. Ok so first of all, i didnt really like it. I didnt find it scary AT ALL, just incredibly weird and slow moving, and kind of boring. Jack looked crazy from the beginning of the movie so at what point did he actually start to get "crazy"? Also, what does Danny being psychic and his imaginary friend Tony have to do with ANYTHING? I realize "redrum" is "murder" spelled backwards, but how did that fit in exactly? Was the hotel really haunted and the ghosts were taking over Jack's mind, or was Jack just going crazy from being isolated for so long? idk, it just didn't seem scary to me AT ALL. And the whole thing with the picture at the end, what the heck? haha Like, Jack was always meant to be there or something, or he was there in another life? LASTLY...the lady in the bathtub, wow, um,  ok i had no idea what that was for i mean did she really attack Danny and if so why? Also, Jack like, kissed her WTF?! haha please help me I'm so confused!!!!!!         sorry that was so long.

One guy is a Leo, and the other guy is a CANCER. I've know the leo since a few years. When i liked him, he didnt like me and now its kinda vice versa. I been talkin to the Cancer for about 6-7 months now and its going pretty well. Although these guys seem amazing.. they both have equal flaws. I really like the Cancer guy but at times he can be very distant. Also i get a sense of him being secretive. Wehn me and him are talking or hanging out he always makes me laugh and i feel great talking to him. But when he's distant... i also become distant and build up my walls again. The leo guy I've know forever. People always thought we would grow up married together. My friends even think he's my soul mate and I truly do love him. My horoscope is a virgo, wit a gemini rising lol. Although  I wanna be with both guys, apart of me has  a fear of COMMITMENT beacuase im almost 20 and im in college. I really love both these guys. But .... what do you guys think?

I watched the last bit of a movie a while back and I cannot remember for the life of me the characters, the actors, the name of the movie.       From what I remember it was a movie about a man who eventually split up with his wife and fell in love with his housekeeper. She was Spanish and at some point they were separated and when he realized he was in love with her he went to her home and proposed to her in funny broken Spanish in front of her whole family on the stairs?       Any help would be appreciated.

20090128233632AAIoEtc	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	The Meaty Bites Diet ?	I've got 2 dogs. I bought a large bag of Meaty Bites at Big W and was standing in line at the check-out.       A woman behind me asked if I had a dog.       On impulse, I told her that no, I was starting The Meaty Bites Diet again, although I probably shouldn't because I'd ended up in the hospital last time, but that I'd lost 25 kgs before I woke in an intensive care ward with tubes coming out of most of my orifices and IV's in both arms.       I told her that it was essentially a perfect diet and that the way that it works is to load your pants pockets with Meaty Bites and simply eat one or two every time you feel hungry & that the food is nutritionally complete so I was going to try it again.       I have to mention here that practically everyone in the line was by now enthralled with my story, particularly a guy who was behind her.       Horrified, she asked if I'd ended up in the hospital in that condition because I had been poisoned by the food. I told her no, it was because I'd been sitting in the middle of the road licking my **** and a car hit me.       I thought one guy was going to have a heart attack he was laughing so hard as he staggered out the door.       Stupid b#tch...why else would I buy dog food??

20090128235218AAv7shD	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	What happened to the baby?	For weeks a five-year-old child kept telling his kindergarten teacher about the baby sister or brother that was expected at his house.          One day the mother allowed the child to feel the movements of the unborn baby.          The five-year-old was obviously impressed, but made no comment. Moreover, he stopped telling the teacher about the awaiting event.          Finally the teacher sat the child on her lap and said, "Lucas, whatever has become of that baby brother or sister you were expecting at home?"         Lucas burst into tears and confessed, "I think Mommy ate it!"          What do you think happened??
20090129000220AAhrb2l	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	What're y'all sellin' here?	Two businessmen from New York City are sitting down for a break in their soon-to-be opened new store in the deep South. As yet, the store wasn't ready. Only a few shelves are set up and nothing was yet on display.          One says to the other, "I bet any minute now some idiot is going to walk by, look in the window, stick his face in the door, and ask what we're selling."          No sooner were the words out of his mouth when, sure enough, a curious Southern gentleman walks to the window, has a peek, sticks his head in the door and in a Southern drawl asks, "What're y'all sellin' here?"          One of the men replies, "Oh! We're selling idiots here."         Without skipping a beat, the Southerner says, "Well, I see y'all're doing real good, you only got two left!"          Don't mess with Southerners!       Is this a true story?

"You can't afford not to hire me. I can sell anyone, anytime, anything!"         "Well we have two prospects that no one has been able to sell. If you can sell just one, you have a job."         He was gone about two hours, and returned and handed them two checks, one for $25,000.00 and another for $50,000.00.         "How in the world did you do that ?" they asked.         "I told you I'm the worlds best salesman, I can sell anyone, anywhere, anytime!"         "Did you get a urine sample?" they asked him.         "What's that?" he asked.         "Well, if you sell a policy over $20,000.00 the company requires a urine sample. Take these two bottles and go back and get urine samples."         Morris was gone about 6 hours and they were fixing to close when in he walks in with two five gallon buckets, one in each hand. He sets the buckets down, and reaches in his shirt pocket and produces two bottles of urine, and sets them on the desk and says "Here's Mr. Brown's and this one is Mr. Smith's."         "That's good" they said, "but what's in those two buckets?"         "Well, I passed by the Holiday Inn and they were having a state teachers convention, so I stopped and sold them a group policy!"       Is this a good salesman?

Okay, I know this isn't much to go by, but I heard this song over the radio and I'd like to know what the title of the song is. If I remember well, I heard this song first in the 90's, the vocals are airy and emotive just like Jeff Buckley (not sure if it's his song). I could not figure out the lyrics because the words are mumbled, but the refrain sounds something like "Walk through the fire, walk through the fire... (2x)" or "Wade through the fire...". The arrangement is acoustic.    Anyone? It's not Peter Gabriel's "Walk through the fire", or "walk through the fire" by Eric Marienthal. Now I'm not so sure if I even have the right lyrics, but I'm sure it sounds kinda like that if you mumble.

20090129021633AAwetEk	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	I think I'm being followed tell me what you think. Not a joke.?	Okay here is the deal. I caught someone lying in an online publication about me. I put the fool on blast. It was a pretty bad blast because he throws raves and I blew out his past since I've known him forever. He began threatening me and my girlfriend. Telling me I was ****** and I better move on before he does. calling me from behind a restricted number etc. I told him I was going to call the cops. Then I find out he may be involved with something criminally organized. Nothing concrete just a hunch based on who his new friends are. So I decided to publicly apologize to play it on the safe side. When I asked if it was over he purposely left the question open. This was in August.      New Years eve I went outside my apartment to get something out of my car and I noticed a white mid 90s sedan with blacked out windows parked in the parking lot. There was a blue light on the dash, it looked like an LCD screen off of a stereo but it was on top of the dash not in it. When I went down the stairs and was facing the car the blue light was off. I didn't really think anything of it figuring it was an alarm or some ****. So I grab my crap out of the car and head back up the steps. Just as I crest into the cars line of sight I see someone turning off the dome light. I don't think anything of it and head back inside. About 1 1/2 hours later the car is still sitting there so I call the cops. A tow truck shows up just as my girlfriend gets home.....we were weirded out because who sits in their car in a dark parking lot on new years eve and makes sure to turn off any lights so they are not seen?      Next day there is a late 90s black BMW in the parking lot. Again windows totally blacked out. It sat there every night all night until the following Monday (4 days or something like that). It was there again the following friday night. Finally I walked up to the window and peered in, and there was a guy looking like he was asleep. The window was too dark to see if he was faking it or make out any detail. Saturday night he was not there and never returned. This is two weekends in a row that someone is sitting in a parked car outside of our apartment at night.      Yesterday (Wednsday) I'm driving to pick up my girlfriend from work I come up on a red light and pull into the turn lane almost at the last second. All of a sudden the car (a tercel) in front of me does the same thing. I'm thinking what the ****. So I glare at his reflection in the side mirror. He is wearing a beige hoody pulled up with sunglass. and he is staring right back at me. The light turns green and we go around the corner I fall back a little and bust a left hand turn and I don't use my signal on a road he already passed (it lead to my g/f work)I don't really think anything of it.      After we get home about an hour (6:30) later we go walk the dog and in the parking lot next door is two dudes in their early 20s....dressed typically urban. One in a red hoodie the other in a beige hoodie that is pulled up (no sunglasses) They notice me on the balcony across the street and go back to talking. The guy in the beige hoodie is making hard left hand turn gestures with his hands as he talks. We walk the dog around the block and when we come back the two are gone. I don't really think anything of it.      Then we walk the dog for the final time at 8:00pm. No hooded shady people outside as we leave. We walk around the block, as we get halfway down the alley the two dudes in hoodies walk around from the other side of the parking lot planter, where they were sitting, and begin walking through the parking lot towards us. We walked past this planter when we first came out and they were no where in sight. I tell my girlfriend to walk with me away from the guys on the other side of a waist high wall. Then a guy from an apartment we just passed comes out and gets in his car and fiddles with ****. The two hoodie guys then motion back over to the closest side of the planter and sit down. We walk behind them and then come around the planter and walk past them with our back to them. I'm giving them the evil eye the entire time. We head inside. I don't turn on the lights and watch them from the window, about 15 minutes later a car picks them up.      I am seriously freaked out. Couldn't eat my dinner freaked out. I was pretty sure the beige hoodie guy was the same guy from the car. I never saw any features but they both had that long slender face.      Now here is my problem if I go to the cops they will ask why someone would want to follow me, and i'd have to tell them otherwise they would dismiss me. Once they hear my story chances are they would start a investigation. If the dude I blew out really did get involved with something criminal, and I'm pretty sure he did, then I could be seriously ******.....So what do I do?

20090128220720AA0hNJ3	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	If you're under 25, do your parents ever drop hints about wanting grandchildren :/?	I'm only 20 and my mom is already dropping hints about grandchildren every once in awhile.. it's creepy and awkward.. I'm not even in a relationship and I've only just finished being a teenager. AND I should not feel this creepy pressure to have kids just because my parents want to have grandchildren someday, you know? I want to live my own life before devoting so very much of my time and energy to another person. the very notion of even getting pregnant scares me to death right now.      also, why is it that men are encouraged to wait until they are at least around 30 and have had lives of their own to have children, yet generally speaking women are encouraged to have kids as young as possible? even by their own parents? :/ I don't have any great urge to reproduce anytime soon. it's stuff like this that makes me want to roll back the clock even just a couple of years and be 17 and completely carefree again

I mean, that was like what we were into in the 7th grade. YouTube is just for videos. DeviantArt is just for art. I'd like one spot for everything.

20090129031902AAy78Zy	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	Can you please recommend me a song?	I want a song (pop especially) where, at its last chorus, the key changes to a high note (the music and the voice).      That high key chorus is mostly after the part when they sing slow, then there's that beat and the chorus is made much harmonic than the previous ones (high note). Sorry, not a music expert.      Sort of like Backstreet Boys songs and other mainstream pop.       So, yeah, I want that kind of songs. Thank you.       The songs that use my example are:      I Want It That Way - Backstreet Boys   Strong Enough - Cher   Livin' on a Prayer - Bon Jovi    Far Away - Nickelback   Angels Brought Me Here - Guy Sebastian   Jillian - Within Temptation      If you know what I mean...

I've never given nor received any valentines, ever. The whole thing is a bunch of stupid commercialism, and it almost seems like someone purposely designed Valentine's Day with my torment in mind. Everyone else at my high school seems to like it so much and they get all excited about it, then they all wonder why it's the time of the year when I seem to be in my gloomiest and most irritable mood.      Anyone else here hate Valentine's Day as much as I do? What do you suggest we do about it?

20090128220650AAzEuJz	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	POLL: Don't you just hate it when people ask: 'How much does it hurt?'?	Like when I see questions up on Yahooanswers! with people asking how much would a certain/piercing or a tattoo hurt?    Like how much more painful it is to get an ear cartilage piercing than a navel piercing?      Of course, pain can be described through words, and of course everybody has the same tolerance as each other.    (That was sarcasm incase you're a slow one.)      Plus, questions like that is OF COURSE it would hurt unless you're immune to pain. But usually, those things depend on pain tolerance.      Questions like, 'Would it hurt more on ______ OR ______' is more acceptable because it is based on people's opinions rather than "fact". It just irritates me when people ask other to describe "how much" something hurts, because everyone is different!

Ive been basically forced to sight read all the music thats ever been put infront of me. I just learned how to transfer it to the piano.   Now that weve gotten that out of the way,        http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AOK1DpsjB...       Hey! does this sound halfway decent? I recorded it on my iphone (horrible quality) ... Ive never had piano lessons.    Should I take lessons?   Also, please check out my other youtube videos (IF YOU WANT)  http://www.youtube.com/user/iwnabonbrdwa...

20090129025331AAN3nj8	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Any tips on writing poetry..? (Poem inside)?	I posted this in the Poetry section, but I thought maybe in Poll & Surveys I'd get more answers and opinions:)      I used to write poetry alot when I was smaller for I had a great imagination and thought of all kinds of things. Now that I'm older, I look at the paper and I'm blank. I get "writer's block" constantly. It makes me frustrated because I used to be such a good writer (for my age, in my opinion anyway).. and now I can't write if my life depended on it.. yet I have so many things I want to write about. Love, life, happiness, heartbreak, you know.. the usual stuff.      Here is a poem I just wrote last night in a short while, and I think the only reason I finished it was because I had inspiration in front of me (my boyfriend). I know the poem sucks, and it's basically simple, or maybe not..?      He looks so peaceful   With his head on his pillow   While time just passes by   Far away he's dreaming   As I watch him sleeping   In my bed he lyes   I start to wonder   Why he's right here with me   Out of everyone else   He could do better   Lord, He could do better   It's how I've always felt   I sit and I pray   Please don't take him away   I love him with all my heart   If he ever leaves   Then right here I'll be   Dreaming we never apart      So anyways, any tips on writing poetry..? All advice will be appreciated! Thanks:)

My flight was being served by an obviously gay flight attendant, who seemed    to put everyone in a good mood as he served us food and drinks.    As the plane prepared to descend, he came swishing down the aisle and told us    that 'Captain Marvey has asked me to announce that he'll be landing the big scary    plane shortly, so lovely people, if you could just put your trays up, that would be super.'    On his trip back up the aisle, he noticed this well-dressed and rather    Arabic looking woman hadn't moved a muscle.    'Perhaps you didn't hear me over those big brute engines but I asked you to    raise your trazy-poo, so the main man can pitty-pat us on the ground.'    She calmly turned her head and said, 'In my country, I am called a Princess and I take orders from no one.'    To which (I swear) the flight attendant replied, without missing a beat,    'Well, sweet-cheeks,in my country I'm called a Queen, so I outrank you.    "Tray-up, Bi*ch"

I remember, years ago, flicking through the channels late at night (this is on two separate occasions) and eventually settling for a movie, both of which were over halfway through when I joined.     The first one had Jennifer Tilly in it - she'd kidnapped a pregnant woman because she couldn't have children herself.     The second one had John C. McGinley in it - he'd also kidnapped a woman, but I can't remember why, and she eventually escaped from his basement by somehow climbing up through his kitchen cabinets.     Does anyone know what these two movies were? I'd check on imdb or something but I don't precisely know what I'm looking for, and I don't feel like trawling through what I'm sure are two very extensive filmographies.     Thanks in advance!!

20090128221041AAekjdp	Entertainment & Music;Music;Other - Music	Who sings this song? It's driving me crazy!?	There is this song they play occasionally on the radio...it sounds like it's from the seventies. It sounds almost like the Bee Gees and has lyrics that go "good vibrations" or "sweet sensations" or both, I can't remember. It's not the Beach Boys, either! I love the song but ever since I started wondering who sings it, it seems like they will never again play it on the radio and it's driving me crazy not knowing who sings it/the name of it. Please someone help!

20090129031242AAD9d4C	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	In Your Opinion: What makes up the perfect song?	Like if you had all the knowledge in the word on how to write a song      How would you write it?      Me i'd have this epic/evil[ish] (like rebirthing by skillet) tone of  strings as the intro leading into the voice of the singer, where the strings slowly fade into the back (still there but not as loud as the begginning letting the other instruments take over guitar, bass etc (with a piano background) and then the guitar solo, then the lyrics leading to the end of the song and then a full on piano solo at the end (simialar to intermission by panic at the disco or the end of chiqitita by abba for a good at least 40 secs fadding to the end      if that makes any sense =]      but how would you arrange a song?

20090128205238AAXhvIn	Entertainment & Music;Comics & Animation	What were the names of these old animes??? ^^?	Ok, I watched a few Animes when i was young and I want to watch them again (Brings back nice memories ^-^) so here are descriptions of them, as much as i can remember:      1.(show) A girl met a talking cat and got super powers. (sorry can't remember that one well)   2.(show) A girl whose relative (an uncle i think) died and she went to his house and found some cards. She had to go on a journey to collect these cards. (I think they were called the cow cards or something... no pun intended.)   3. I watched a movie, and it was about 2 girls and their father who moved to a rural town to be near a hospital that there mother was at. Then all i can remember is a Big bunny and 2 smaller ones following it around... and a big cat. and the older girl rode in the cat like a car.   4. In this movie, it was about a girl who was a witch. And on her 13th birthday, she had to move out of her house. She and her cat left and went to a city. She started a business there.      Sorry if some of them are not descriptive enough! It was a long time ago...

God, please tell me, why won't I wake up!? When did I fall asleep, when did this utter relapse first occur? My being is crying for understanding, it's crying for you! I need my savior.   But I can't seem to find you, I Still cling on to this human pride, this optimum desire. I know that I need you but the problem is I'm not willing to change.   I'm so lazy, so arrogant! How can you love such a selfish thing as I am?! I want the easy way out, to gain comprehension without working for the knowledge. But aren't we all like that? Isn't that what we all want? We're all sinners in the end, all equal in the grace and love of You. Or at least that's what I want to believe.   Even now I don't want to change the way I've been living even if it is the wrong way to live. I want my freedom, I want my heart.   I want love.   ....Where am I? Who is this holding the pen? Nyljoe? Surely not. But he's somewhere in this body, this Earthly shell.   I must find him.

20090128225402AAUyr3k	Entertainment & Music;Television;Other - Television	Still looking for a childhood show!?	I've been looking for this show a long time. I've seen it when I was little I was anywhere from 5 - 7. And I've seen this back home in russia it was translated. So that would make it 80s-90s. Basically what i remember is the main character has short black hair and glasses he kind of looks like harry potter. He tried to kill a red dragon in the air and he did not know the weakness but he saw that the dragon had a yellow or orange scale and he shot it and the dragon was defeated. He might have been using magic or arrows, not too sure and i think i recall seeing a unicorn in that show aswell. Im pretty sure it was a japanese show. I asked many people and they said it sounds like hobbit or wizards or dragon tales or dragon quest meanwhile those are movies and they nowhere near and they are american. The adventure takes place in old times the colors look something like saint seiya. Thank you! Help would be deeply appreciated!

It's hanging down today, it was hanging down yesterday, it'll be hanging down again tomorrow!'       Furious, Bert yelled, 'AND DO YOU KNOW WHY IT'S HANGING DOWN, MARGARET?'       'Nope', she replied.       'IT'S HANGING DOWN, BECAUSE IT'S LOOKING AT MY NEW BOOTS!!!!'       Without changing her expression, Margaret replied, 'Shoulda bought a hat, Bert. Shoulda bought a hat.'
