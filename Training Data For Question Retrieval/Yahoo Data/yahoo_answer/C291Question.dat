20090222154133AAHxeJn	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	What is going on..I dont understand?	I'm in high school and I like this guy named Shane. He's in my grade and he's in 4 of my classes. I have never spoken to him. In the beginning of the year, at lunch, I had one of my male friends, Brandon, ask Shane if he had a girlfriend. Shane said no. Soon Shane found out that it was me who told Brandon to ask him the gf question. He found out that I liked him. Shane and his friends avoided me. I didn't try to get his attention after that. A couple months ago, I noticed that Shane has been looking at me A LOT inside and outside class and he started to hangout by me and my group of friends at lunch. We're outside at lunch and during the middle of lunch, Shane and his friends come out and stand a couple feet away from me. Whenever I look at him, he turns his head and looks the opposite direction. I told my friends about this and they said he's starting to like me. When I was walking slowly to 6th period yesterday, Shane walked past me. Then a couple of his friends walked next to me. One of them yelled Holy S*** in my face. Then he said "Sorry" in a joking way. After that, they left to catch up with Shane. Now every time I look at Shane, he's not the one who's looking at me, its his friends. What was up with that whole yelling thing?? Why are his friends always glancing at me? They never did that before. Does Shane like me?

And I don't mean just African- American and Caucasion but any mixed raced couple, what do you think?   Is it okay to you?   Do you frown upon them?   DO you question one over the other? (meaning: is it okay for women to date outside of their race or men?)      I just want to know.   I interracial date. I love men, no matter the race. If he has sex appeal..whew, I am all for him. I don't believe love should be limited to a person's race.   Some of my friends are surprised if we are out and a different raced male approach me and I like him and talk it up with him. They don't get it,  so they say. But it's not about the race, it's about that person. Who they are if i would factor in anything it would be their sex appeal over anything unless we're talking on a serious note of their personality and what not....         (Please when answering, try and use the correct race term and not say "Blacks, whites, etcs...I really dislike those terms for any race)      Positive insights and honesty welcomed!   Thanks all!

I was a Miley fan but no i am starting to dislike her for 2 reasons      1.Coz of the stupid things she does (you all know what i mean the pics, the videos...      2. I am jealous...i know i can't believe it either i mean look at this pic of miley's face`  http://celeb9.com/blog/wp-content/upload...  may not be the ugliest person but she is still not pretty. She got the role of Hannah Montana coz of her dad..yeah she auditioned i know but her dad helped her. Not just her he helps to the whole Cyrus Family. Or is it just a coincidence that Miley,Travis and Noah are famous...Braison Cyrus was in an episode of HM too. She can't sing. Yeah she has a strong voice but she doesn't know how to use it. She had to take voice lessons and she still doesn't sound good. Nick left her and she was so desperate to write a song about how much she hates him and she said that she still hates him at a concert. She had to get and older boyfriend and she's too blind to realize that he is using her. I mean you can see it on pics and videos she's smiling he doesn't look happy with her. He was a model and after he and miley started dating he's gonna try singing(they said that on the Miley and Mandy show) And her dad seems like a nice guy but he is still letting her do anything she wants...      idk why but i am so so so jealous of her, she is kinda mean even though she hides it and she still has everything...and guys think she's hot what's so good about her???      Please help me      Thanks

20090222102345AAv6Yh9	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Pierce Brosnan has won the razzie award for worst supporting actor for Mamma Mia?	I haven't seen the movie, so I am asking you, if you have seen the movie version of Mamma Mia, that is a jukebox musical based on the songs of ABBA, if you think that Pierce Brosnan deserves to win the razzie award for worst supporting actor, or even a nomination for it. And I bet that you might think of not seeing Mamma Mia, or that I will sleep better for not seeing, but from the previews that I have even seen and heard, including the review of it from At the Movies with Ebert & Roeper, which Roeper and Chicago Tribune Film Critic Michael Philips, reviewed the movie, and even show a clip of his singing of the song of SOS. But do you think that Pierce Brosnan deserves either, a nomination, or the win for worst supporting actor for Mamma Mia, and why or why not. Even without seeing the movie, that I would say that he deserves the award for worst singer, but I guess that it is a good thing, that there is no category for worst singer.

The pharmacist says the condoms come in packs of 3, 9 or 12 and asks which the young man wants.    "Well," he said, "I've been seeing this girl for a while and she's really hot.

"Once she's had me, she'll want me all the time, so you'd better give me the 12 pack."    The young man makes his purchase and leaves.    Later that evening, he sits down to dinner with his girlfriend and her parents. He asks if he might give the blessing and they agree. He begins the prayer, but continues praying for several minutes.    The girl leans over to him and says, "You never told me that you were such a religious person."    The boy leans over to her and whispers, "You never told me that your father is a pharmacist."

20090222125225AAGEgAo	Entertainment & Music;Music;Other - Music	Hey do you have the Most Wanted (album) by Hilary Duff?	Okay, well i know this is like really late and stuff but i have known this 4 a really long time...Well one day i was listening to it, and i let it play all the way through, and when all the songs were done, i was about to go change the CD (to a diff. one) and before i could get over to my Radio, another song started playing, and i got startled by it because i wasn't expecting it out by it and turned my radio off. A couple of months later (i had forgotten that this had previously happened) i did the exact same thing, only this time, i let the (hidden) song play all the way through.  I then, checked the back of the CD case, and there wasn't a track 14 (all that was on there was 13 tracks) so i went to google, and typed in what i thought the song was called (because, they kept saying "i am") and it took me to a wikipedia page, it didn't show me much, so i decided to type in the album name into the search box, it brought up a page that did help me a lot...i scrolled down, and there was the track lists, and the artist, who wrote it, i looked below track 13 and found that it said that there was a track 14 but the said it was a (remix/)hidden track. then it all made sense to me. But why would they do that? Why make it a hidden track, instead of just a track 14? Also why would the make it where you have to wait a minuet b4 the song starts? well,  sorry this is so long, and sorry this is late, (btw, i have known this 4 awhile, i just never posted it on Y!A)      thnx 4 answering!

There's this girl I used to be best friends with, but I stopped talking to her cause I think she's a *****. She's always talking crap about me to my boyfriend, and it gets me annoyed that she's talking badly about me to MY boyfriend. I told him how frustrated it makes me to know that they talk, and he gave me advice saying "Oh, just lose all contact with her. Block her, don't talk to her."   So today is my birthday, and I get a phone call from her, so I was wondered what she wanted, and I picked up. I figured she was just trying to be nice and wish me a happy birthday, ok, it's not like I'm having a conversation with her, no big deal. Which she did, all she said was "Happy birthday." So I thanked her and hung up.      She just told my boyfriend "I spoke to her on the phone, she sounded like a man." Now my boyfriends pissed at me because I ignored his advice, and enabled her to contact me. He was like "Wtf, does my advice go through one ear and out the other? I care so much, that I don't want you to have any problems, big or small, cause small things can build up, so what's the point of me wasting my breath trying to help you, if you're just gonna ignore what I tell you? Whatever, you want me to care less? Fine, wish granted. I'm not gonna offer you advice unless you desperatley need it."      He's also upset because he's already really mad about work, and this situation is just making it worse.      Wtf, what should I say/do?

I should be in year 11 but because i was being bullied and stuff at school i would pull sickies and stuff. So i ended up missing lots and lots of school and so if i had gone straight into year 11 id of had to do my GCSE without knowing alot so me and my mum agreed that it would be best to go back a year.   Anyhoo   alot of my friends are part of the girls rugby team in my year. This school is in the country (slightly private) it takes like half and hour to get there from where i live and everyone does a sport and is healthy lol. Apparently its the only place in the world that had a McDonald's close down cuz no one would go in there and you can see the building all empty by the road (although i think it might be the only one closed in the UK) lol.   but anyway what was i saying   yh i want to do a sport but im 16 in may and this is 15 and under    do you think they will make an acception for me being in year 10 and not 11?? even though im gonna be 16 soon?   plz help x

Well, she postponed it because 12 chapters of it were leaked online. She feels that whoever leaked it stumped her creativity. She has not said when she will feel up to writing again may it be months or years. She posted the twelve chapters on her site so that no one would feel guilty about reading it (though it is a rough unedited version that i don't reccomend reading).

20090222114631AA21VC6	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	I got caught scratching my balls and butt hole at Olive Garden and got kicked out, what do I do?	I went to Olive Garden yesterday. That place was jam PACKED. I was sitting down in a waiting booth area, waiting to be seated. There were tons of people in the waiting area. All of a sudden, I got a terrible and irresistible itch on my balls and my @$$hole. I would've gone to the restroom to scratch them, but it was packed in there too (there were literally lines outside the stalls) and I didn't want to miss it if I got called up to be seated.      So, I jammed both of my hands in my pants and was giving both itchy spots a real good scratch when some old hag said I was disgusting. Well excuuuuuuuuuussse me, *****. I realized that I was a mess (I was still wearing the clothes I had on the night before when I was at the bar with my girls, and I'm sure that I smelled like the inside of a thousand beer cans), but its not like I ever told her that she had a face that would scare buzzards off a gut truck. WELL, as a matter of fact I DID tell her that. She went up to the manager and told him what I said. He told me to get the hell out of his restaurant or he would call the cops.      I stormed out of the restaurant and went to my truck, still scratching my @$$hole and balls. I tried to do a burn-out in the parking lot to vent my frustration, but my dang ole truck just stalled out and then wouldn't start again so I had the entrance/exit blocked for over 2 hours and man was he pissed-off!!! The tow truck eventually came and took my truck to the repair shop. The manager took me home and told me if I was smart, I would keep my mouth shut, keep my hands out of my pants, and never go out in public again.      After he drove off I flicked him off.      What do I do?

20090222112811AAVlPqI	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Ok I asked a question earlier but I gave the wrong idea to you and im not gonna add a thousand details.?	I asked on wether I should keep my current, DIFFICULT, ENOURMOUS, & MISCHEVIOUS german shepherd dog, Ikea. She's not social with other dogs by the way. Should I keep her or should I give her to my RESPONSIBLE AND CARING  uncle who has experience with dogs, and adopt a new dog, Piggy, a sheltie mix, who isn't as difficult as Ikea. Please don't question my ability to handle dogs! I can trainn them, it's ust a lot harder when theyre getting so huge. Should I keep Ikea and probably get my face chewed off, or should I try and start over with Piggy?

20090222111516AAtAWHE	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Is love necessary in life?	I'm 21 and never been in a relationship, nor desire to be in one. I'm probably asexual. I think society puts way too much emphasis on relationships and finding that special someone. Why can't people just be happy with themselves? People think that being in a relationship will automatically make them happy and solve all their problems. Why is there obsessive interest over relationships?   I'm not really that close to anyone. I only have one or two friends. It's hard for me to get close to people in general...kind of because I don't see why people would want to hang out with me. So I guess in some ways, I have low-self esteem. I don't think I've ever emotionally opened up to another human being..   My question is, am I missing out on what life is all about?      Part of be doesn't believe in love and thinks it's just a silly human emotion. However, that means, every other human emotion is silly as well. So I do realize my thinking is slightly skewed. I also realize that just because I don't believe in love, doesn't mean it's not valid.      I also realize that part of my inability to love probably comes from the inability to love myself. However, it's not like I hate myself either. I do think I have some good qualities, but overall, I'm just don't really care.   I realize that when I get out of college, I'm just going to have a career and ultimately die. Yeah there will be fun times in between..but in the end..we're going to die.

20090222122829AA951f6	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Can anybody cheer me up?	Today is my sixteenth birthday party.   One would presume today should be a fun day.   Thus far, it is not so.      1. I shaved half of my left eyebrow off.    2. Out of the 7 people I invited 2 can't come, for really stupid reasons, too. 'I got grounded for fighting with my parents', who does that in high school? Jesus, I just get torn apart when I use sarcasm.   3. I'm having an Oscars party and I have this impending feeling of doom that my friend bought the same dress as me... Which is upsetting.   4. I'm just so stressed out with everything that's going on right now, I'm supposed to go away in June for a Field Hockey tourni in California but I'm falling behind in school and I haven't been working out. So I'm fat and stupid.   5. Even though I know I shouldn't have watched it because I'm sensitive and this kind of crap just haunts me for days, I watched that video with that little dick and his brother beating up their cat, Rusty.      Can anybody cheer me up?   10 points up for grabs.   :'(

I do not remember the title, but I would love it if I could figure it out.  This is what I remember;  This movie is not animated, but using puppets, like the kind used in Sesame Street.  The main character is a brown male rabbit, and one day he leaves his home with Mama Rabbit to have some adventures or something.  It is a sing-along, and I vaguely remember one of the songs going;  Bibbidy Bobbidy Boo.  He encounters many creatures, but he must be home by dinner.  This movie is NOT Peter Rabbit.  Also, have you heard of We-Sing-Sillyville?

Guys aren't supposed to sit that way. Girls are. Guys are supposed to have their knee out to the side and their ankle on their knee. Albeit it's less comfortable it's what people should do in social settings. Although we have all come to accept homosexuality, accepting transgendered transexual behavior would be outrageous in my opinion

But he says, "You're stupid, you're not going to be able to do anything with your degrees, you're stupid, stupid, stupid!" When I ignore me, he says "You can't even come up with a good comeback!"  Today he called me stupid almost 20 times within 5 minutes for various reasons (such as the grease thing). He just likes to "mess" with me, but sometimes you just can't take it anymore.  Today I came very close to being violent for the first time in my life, and I almost broke a plate over his head.  GRRRR! I am so frusterated. What are some good comebacks? I need help.

20090222122601AAKpGcM	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Looking for movie, can't find the title HELP?	This movie was shown in the past couple of months on Cinemax or HBO..it  was about a sex offender who got out of jail and moved in with his mother, I remember in a scene where they wrote on his sidewalk, ugly things about him. I remember this being the side story because he wasn't a big famous celebrity who played him. The movie had a famous person who obviously played the main character and all I can remember is that at the end of the movie the little girl of the the main character runs away and then they go find her, thinking this convicted sex offender took her..but it wasn't him. He was sitting on a swing at night, I think he had cut his penis off. Apparently he couldn't make it outside of jail..after trying to live a normal life, i.e. dating (his mother kept setting him up and there was on scene where she was helping him post an ad in the classifieds. Does anyone know this movie? I'm wracking my brains here!~

20090222140337AAyWrsl	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	POLL: what do you think of this story pen pal  sent me claims its true?	I live in Belfast, Northern Ireland, in a big house in the suburbs. It is about 100 years old, and as a child I always used to see and hear things such as cupboard doors opening or slamming, or something knocking from under the eaves in my room (which was in the attic).      About two years ago, when I was 14, I was sleeping in my bed when I felt a pressure at the bottom of my bed. I owned a cat at the time so I didn't think anything of it. I tried to move my feet underneath the "cat", but I couldn't move my legs. Alarmed, I opened my eyes to see a middle-aged woman sitting at the bottom of my bed with her head in her hands. I tried to scream, but I felt winded. When she realised I was awake, she got up and rushed to the side of my bed and grabbed my jaw with one of her hands.      I couldn't scream. I just felt so cold. Her face was scrunched up and she looked so angry. I swiped at her hands and tried to get her off me. After about 15 seconds of me struggling, she threw my head down again and ran out the door. I lay under the sheets screaming for my parents for about 20 minutes. They didn't hear me. I lay there until I was brave enough to go downstairs and tell them what happened. They didn't believe me.      Since then, I have never seen the person again, but I moved from the attic downstairs, and I haven't slept in that room since.

20090222145930AAN3hhN	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Would you tell him that you're pregnant?	Let's say that you got pregnant with a boy that was way younger than you and just starting out his life, a man who already has a family, someone you just hooked up with, someone from another country that you hooked up with that one time on vacation, or someone that was no longer around you (like not in the same city, state, or country), would you tell them that you're pregnant?      I personally wouldn't just because I don't know that person and I would blame myself for being irresponsible in the first place.      BTW: This DIDN'T happen to me. I was writing a story and I wanted to know some opinions.      Thank you :3

20090222170012AADvQ0j	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Aren't Children logical and clever.....?	A firefighter was working on the engine outside the station, when he noticed a little girl nearby in a little red wagon with little ladders hung off the sides, and a garden hose tightly coiled in the middle.              The girl was wearing a firefighters helmet. The wagon was being pulled by her dog and her cat.       The firefighter walked over to take a closer look. 'That sure is a nice fire truck,' the firefighter said with admiration.              'Thanks,' the girl replied.       The firefighter looked a little closer. The fireman noticed the girl had tied the wagon to her dog's collar and to the cat's testicles...             'Little partner,' the firefighter said, 'I don't want to tell you how to run your rig, but if you were to tie that rope around the cat's collar, I think you could go faster.'       The little girl replied thoughtfully, 'You're probably right, but   then I wouldn't have a siren.            ~Peace~

20090222165835AAi0dOq	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	R&P: This or That: Melodic Death Metal- Round 3?	Tonight's choices stray away from the mainstream for the most part.       Choice one is a particular favorite track of mine from the band. Coming from the "doomy side" of melodeath, the first choice is Insomnium's 'Mortal Share'.       The second choice is a band fairly new to me, they've grown on me. They have almost a metalcore/power metal vibe to them (in terms of the riffs and the almost atmospheric sound they acheive). Reigning from Italy, the second choice is Disarmonia Mundi's 'Red Clouds'.      Insomnium    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5IpHczLe...

20090222142357AAeI3wb	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	What will you be doing on March 28 this year? EARTH HOUR 2009?	Many countries are participating this year, on March 28, to combat power demand and climate change. Basically, everyone who wants to join in is supposed to TURN OFF ALL OF THE LIGHTS in their house on March 28, for one hour -- from 8:00pm - 9:00pm. Use candles for lighting..      The goal is to show how much we can conserve and save AS A PLANET if we all work together to make this place better for everyone. One hour of no lights around the world will save TONS of electricity, and help others become aware of the demand and find alternative sources of energy (such as wind, solar, hybrid, etc) to power our world.      Even though I don't believe in global warming, (which is one of their main goals), I DO believe in working together and saving energy -- as well as using alternative power sources.      I'm in.. are you?      SPREAD THE WORD!!!      www.earthhour.org

Bleach is well into the main battle atleast into the manga, which looks to be the last great battle in the whole storyline of this anime/manga.   now I think personally that there are some awesome areas of the storyline which have not been explained. the area I'm most interested in seeing more about is hell, closer to the beginning of the bleach series a hollow ends up being taken into hell threw large doors which show a very large sword with a tattoo'd arm holding it piercing into the hollow.   It would be interesting to see how the hirerarchy works there.

20090222135347AA0vOHG	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Would you rather sleep in your car or in a windowless guest house without a bathroom?	Lets say that your parents tell you if you come home late even on weekends you must sleep in your car. They will allow you to put a cott in a windowless guest house that has no restroom inside the guest house.       The oneroom guest house would be heated and would keep out wind and rain.      What would you choose?      Lets say you couldn't afford a hotel?         Your car has a back seat that is very comfortable.      The oneroom guest house has a solid door with a lock.         The cott in the guest house would actually be a single mattress.      Since you would use the guest house your mother would allow you to decorate and paint the inside of the guest house.      For example your mom would allow you to paint the inside of the door and the walls.       Unfortunatley you wouldn't be able to put windows inside.         Would you be afraid to close the door while you would be inside the one room windowless guest house?      The guest house gets warm and toasty with the little heater on.         This guest house is very small. Its about 40 square feet.         The guest house has no holes or windows in it.

20090222144100AAljN5m	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Why do I need to defend myself?	Okay, 1st off, some background info...  I am 35 yrs young and raised my son as a single parent. He is now 17 and I got married 6 months ago.      Yesterday, I dyed my hair neon pink. Yes, I said neon pink. Think Jeffery Starr ( Eyelash curlers & butcher knifes)  Well, my mom went ape-**** and told me to grow up & stop wasting money. My son said I look a fat clown. Neither of them let me explain myself, but why should I ?      Here is my question...  why do I have to defend my personal choices when I am an adult?  The only approval that I need is from my employer ( obviously, I need to stay within certain guidelines for work, I'm not that careless)  My husband has not problem w/ it. but most of all , I like it. I have never been one to follow the leader, I chose to do my own thing.

Ok.... i play piano and i LOVE it and   music is very important in my life, but whenever i try to write a song, i can't put the notes together to make a beautiful melody. I know that writing music requires a certain talent, and i praise anyone who has that ability. I study music and dissect the piece and try to understand how it was put together. I just can't write music and i am starting to lose patience with trying. Many musicians have inspired me. I also think that it might be a problem that i don't like to show my emotions, because i don't like people feeling sorry for me (i haven't had the best of lives, but I won't go into detail) so that is a problem when it comes to lyrics.       Do you have any suggestions that could help me?

There’s some sense to this story, if you’ll just hear me out…      Look, we all wonder if time travel is possible, right? Well, let me tell you something… it is. I’m from the future, actually. I know you probably don’t believe that, but seriously, I’m from the future. It’s a really great thing; getting to see the past, watching events unfold… stuff like that. We know more now than we ever would.      Behind all the fun, though, there’s a more serious aspect. We aren’t supposed to go in our own lifetime, and we are NEVER allowed to contact our past selves. Let me tell you, I’m breaking that rule right now. Yes, kid, you’re talking to yourself. Your future self. I’m going to be executed for this, but you know what? I accept that. I’m preventing something by talking to you that is WORSE than death. I can’t tell you outright what to do, because the filters would catch it. This is the closest I can get, trust me. I can, however, send a little message.      You should probably read the first word of every paragraph, now.

Being the obsessive Bleach fan that I am, and being a fan of the Ulquiorra and Orihime pairing I AM SO CURIOUS TO SEE IF IT'S TRUE!!!!!!!! So if you know, PLEASE, SPILL!!!!!!!

Ok I really do suck at writing but this chorus kept running through my head so I wrote it down so it would quit bothering me haha. anyways I liked it and tried to write something around it.      Wanna tell me how it sounds to you?   you can be as nice or as mean as you want ;)         OK here it is:      the waves crashed over the sand   onto the place where you and I met   they brushed against my feet   the flashbacks came hard and fast   and I could see you once again   those eyes, that smile, your hair; all of it   spinning around in a dizzy haze I sensed you      and that's when the colors all burned together   and everything spun out of control   and in that moment, I swear we were infinite      time spanned forever and nothing seemed real   but those are just memories   nothing is permanent   nothing is stable (you definitely weren't)   but still I sensed you      and that's when the colors all burned together   and everything spun out of control   and in that moment, I swear we were infinite      and when the waves recoiled   it swept the memories away   dragged them out to sea   gone. just you and me            Also this keeps running through my mind. how does this sound?:      tonight we're breaking all the rules   and burning all our bridges   because tonight nothing else matters   and we won't look back         sooo tell me what you think please?   thanks

20090222175245AAn01ur	Entertainment & Music;Television;Other - Television	Top Five TV Characters You Would Want to Date/Marry?	What TV characters (top 5) would you want to date and/or marry?      Before you answer quickly, there are some "rules":      1. The show must be from the last 25 years (1984-present) because I was born in '84 and I don't want classic TV characters from the '60s      2. Don't be shallow.  List reasons outside of looks why you would want to be with that person (include looks, but add other things)      3. The character can be from any genre EXCEPT animation (animated characters cannot be hot or have other traits)      4. They have to be main characters, no one-spot guest roles      5. No TV hosts like Rachael Ray or Kelly Ripa, for example      MY TOP FIVE (I'm a guy so..):      1. Monica Gellar, "Friends": she's hot, she can cook, she's funny, and she's neat (always cleaning that apartment)   2. Sarah Walker, "Chuck": she's hot, she can kick anyone's @$$, she's has a very good job (though dying in the line of duty is always a possibility...)   3. Elliot Reid, "Scrubs": doctors make money, great personality   4. Calleigh Duquesne, "CSI: Miami": attractive, smart, good job   5. Temprance Brennan, "Bones": attractive, smart, good job      Your turn

Ok, so my horoscope(pisces) said that to look out for my dreams this weekend cuz they are trying to tell me something.  But i dont know what they are trying to tell me. Do you think you know?      1st Dream: I was in my old house with this one guy that i really like, (brandon). And while he was there, my whole entire family was there too. they were asking, "who is that?" and i was talking to him like i was his best friend. (not like i was his gf)      2nd Dream:i was at my grandma's house alone with this guy, (edgar). and we were sitting on the couch watching tv.then we got tired so we fell asleep on the couch together. i snuggled next to him, and layed my head on his chest...he didnt mind. then he began to play with my hair.      i like both edgar and brandon a WHOLE lot! in the horoscope, it said that my dreams were trying to tell me a missing clue about something.What do you think the clue is? idk what it is??       p.s. i asked edgar to be my Valentine, but he said no...do you think he said that cuz he was nervous, but he really does like me? is my dream trying to tell me that he really does like me?

20090222150208AAZh8a1	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Should i do it or not?	Volleyball tryouts were last monday and i did not make the team ( i am really surprised about that).

She made this lame excuse, but she asked me, if i want to be a manager of the team (basically helping her out with certain stuff and training with the team, ) Should i accept this offer or not?       Here is the pros and cons:      Pro:   I will get community service hours for it.   I get to play volleyball for free.   I will gain volleyball experience.      Con:   I have to stay after school for 2 hours.   I cant play at games or tournaments.   I am dealing with bossy and stupid people (1/4 of the team)   I have no motivation in training with the team, and it will make me angry ever single time, if i see the volleyball team. (because i did not make the team)      Should i accept this offer or not?

20090222102205AA3GeLM	Entertainment & Music;Movies	I have a big nose...will I ever get to be a movie actress?	I've been told I'm a really good actress and I've played lead roles in a lot of plays now.    I do a lot of ballet also, so I’m quite thin (but also flat chested although this doesn’t bother me too much).       The trouble is I’m ugly and I really hate my big nose so much, it’s really damaged my confidence over the last few years. My family background is Italian, but many people stereotype me as being Jewish just because of my nose and it really upsets me. On stage it doesn't bother me, but when I'm not on stage I feel so self-conscious  -  to the point where I don't even bother trying to talk to guys I don’t know anymore.       It probably doesn't help that I'm really shy but I can’t help feeling so ugly.        I'd love to become a movie actress but I know casting directors won't want me in any of their films because I'm not pretty enough. The trouble is I don't want to change my nose; I want to be a film actress that's different, not the same boring pretty person.      Is there anything I can do to my appearance to make me look better?
