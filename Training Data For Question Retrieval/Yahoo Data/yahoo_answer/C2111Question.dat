20090307124001AArZjM8	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Messenger;Voice Calls	Has anyone tried using Yahoo Messenger Phone for making calls?	I got the service to make phone calls through my computer, but it nearly never connects to the number.  It just rings, than Yahoo voice mails answers.  I've tried calling calling the phone at the nurse station, but it never rang.  When my mother gets online from California (they have only dial internet access in her town), I ask her if the phone rang and she said no.  Am I doing something wrong or is this service just crap. It's prepaid, and according to the customer guidelines, there's no refunds.  It cost me $13, 26% of my income for a month.      I live in a nursing home so I cannot afford a phone and they only provide one phone for all the residents to use, at the nurse's station.  No privacy and 3 minute limit.  Plus no long distance calls, which can be fun if you local friend has an out of town cell phone number.      We are only allowed to spend $50 on personal things, which includes clothing, every time they lose something in the laundry, sodas or snacks.  Outside the meals, we only get water.  Anything else we have to buy from their vending machines.  To get on the internet, I'm piggy backing off a WiFi signal from a nearby business.

20090307145518AA8qWib	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Answers	PLEASE answer this quick! I need serious help!!?	You know that thing where the water goes down into, I think it's called the "traper" or whatever in your shower? How do I remove that?       My water will not drain. Everytime I take a shower, water builds up to the middle of my calf.      So how do i remove it? It's the kind where if you twist it half way, it goes down so water cant escape, and if you twist it back up, it lets the water drain.      I think the trapper has hair stuck in it, so how do I remove it to clean it?

20090225073956AAnmRN4	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Answers	Why does Yahoo Answers have a section on St Patrick's Day?	I was looking up Holiday section because I saw a question on Christmas and was surprised.      You can imagine my shock when I saw St Patrick's Day had it's own section.      I mean they do not have many Holidays listed.      How did St Patrick get its own section?      Surely they should put up other Holidays if St Patrick has its own section.      Surely any question on that day could be answered in the Ireland section or other Holiday.      He is the National Saint of Ireland, not the world.      They are other Holidays that could be included.      I do not see it as fair, even do I think St patrick is great and all.

20090225071037AAGywpK	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Groups	Is there a known issue with Yahoo Groups not sending out Emails for posted messages?	I'm a moderator for a couple of local Yahoo groups and I recently posted the same message to several groups.  I generally get individual Email delivery from these groups.  Although I see the messages listed in the group message list, I only received the message via Email from one of the groups.  I've also gotten confirmation from other members of the groups that although we typically receive Emails from all of the groups when a message is posted to several of them, we only received one copy of the recent Email(s).  I haven't gotten any info from anyone that didn't receive the message ... but if they didn't receive it at all, they wouldn't know that they were missing anything.      Is this a new "feature" of Yahoo (that it somehow knows you're getting the same Email from multiple groups and only sends you one copy)?      Could some folks who are only members of one (or a few) of the groups have not received the Email at all?      Is there anything we can do to notify someone about this (if it's possibly a problem) or work around the situation?      I'd like to either let the folks in my groups know that it's not a problem or that we may need to take extra precautions with communications if the groups may not be sending out Emails for messages posted to the group.

20090307160914AAklw4U	Yahoo! Products;Other - Yahoo! Products	Is Yahoo! Music dead?	I've used yahoo! music for quite a few years now and have loved how easy it was to find new songs. I used the 'my station' radio feature which allowed me to rate songs, albums and artists and depending on my ratings recommended me music.   They have recently changed there radio player so you can now only skip 5 tracks an hour! This is stuiped because I now have to sit through songs I don't like which isn't the reason I use the site.   It also now only allows me to rate the song and not the album and artist.   Finally they have now teamed up with rhapsody which may be great if your inside the US but for people like me who don't we can't even use there music player to find new music as it bring up an error saying I lived out side the US.   It's my understanding that most of the world live outside the US so I don't see why anyone 'outside the US' would continue using yahoo! music's services.   Unable to use there site for the reason I joined a few years back I have now decided to find a new service.   Please say what you think   Thanks
