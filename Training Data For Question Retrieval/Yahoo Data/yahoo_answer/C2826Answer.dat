Sah5tjD8aa	as recently as 1990, we had the greasiest burger you can imagine and large cokes.  But then, I remember seeing King Kong in the early 1950's at a drive in with my parents and sisters.  The only food I remember from that "adventure" was popcorn.  Some things will never change.  Thanks for bringing back these memories!|`|k8HpMaHxaa	We still have one here. With the usual foods...popcorn, burgers, fries, pizza, candy and soda. <br>  <br>  We prefer to Drive In to regular movies. A beer with the movie is nice, and my boyfriend has room to fall asleep after the first 30 minutes, like usual. =]|`|l23e1yIAaa	I go to the Drive in all the time... theres one in Baltimore thats been open for 50+ years and they have a ton of yummy junk food..|`|RQc8fbjbaa	We still have one here!|`|AA11091315	I used to go when I was a kid. Now, they're pretty much extinct here in CA. We used to go to a fast food place or grocery store for snacks and just ate that stuff instead of what they offered at the concession stand.|`|u4liwDhAaa	I do remember drive in movies!  Gosh those were fun.  We have one in our area that still operates.  It's been around for years and years...<br>  <br>  The only food I remember is POPCORN!  Yum...<br>  <br>  Haven't been to the drive in since I was a little kid :+)

There both bad for you. Da.<br>  <br>  But I would have to say Smoking. It gives you lung cancer and can die early|`|3Qv4GRIlaa	smoking I think|`|AA11421521	I don't think it matters they both will kill you. The end result is your heart will stop beating. Now there is a different way of looking at this.<br>  When you smoke there is a possibility that you could take someone with you.When you eat u die alone.<br>  hope that helps!|`|6IYs44b0aa	huh, theyre both pretty bad, smoking can give you lung cancer and bronchitis, but fast food can give you diabetes,heart attack,or you could be extremely obese from it.<br>  <br>  <br>  i would have to say fast food|`|AA11881876	Both will kill you.

Plus you can take vitamins and work out to stay healthy even if you eat fast food.|`|s90jW3rwaa	Good question...I'd say smoking, maybe but depends how often you smoke and stuff like that

9CKrP9Keaa	Is there a difference if they were in a regular restaurant and left 1/2 of their food on the plate.........NO. Second, if the buffet restaurants were losing money you would see them closing. I live in NYC and there are buffets opening up every few weeks. You question shows you didn't give it much thought. As someone said, it's their food, they paid for it.|`|ec2ee9613c6bdc3dcad61f9d849d618eaa	Because it's theirs to waste. They paid, they can choose. With so many options, many people simply want a small taste of everything and wind up wasting the rest. Tis a shame.|`|KlSkJ8tjaa	Some people might take things that they think look good but aren't really or they may want to try it and they find out they don't want it.

3vlfbkVGaa	Don't you know it's Murph's Law that just as soon as you fall in love with an item either at a restaurant or a grocery store, they stop selling it.

Can't find them anymore can you? NO.Infuriating.

It basically just satisfies "hunger" cravings.  But, they've also been known to add chemicals to their food in order to make you hungrier and go back for more.

There are also other healthy options too. <br>  <br>  You can't get around the fact that most of the food is high fat and high calorie.
