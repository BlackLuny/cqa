1F28QvFCaa	If your wife is aware that this guy is in love with her, then I think it's inappropriate for her to exchange emails with him - two reasons, first, she might be (unintentionally) giving him "hope" and secondly, I don't think it's fair to you - ask your wife to think about how she would feel if you were the one emailing a woman who had a crush on you? Their relationship is based on emails right now...but what if he asks her to go for a coffee or a meal? would she refuse?/ I'd ask her to at least cut back on her correspondence with this guy and to understand your jealousy - you're not being unreasonable.|`|ebD1plKNaa	Sounds like a problem to me.    Traditional marriage vows state that you take the other to "have and to hold, to seek for council above all others . . .

Your wife took step one in telling the other guy that she loves you.    Step two should be when she tells him that because of the impropriety of the relationship, she needs to end it (you may need to help her understand this one).      Step three should be when she makes a commitment to you,and herself to not put herself in a situation like that in the future.  Work is work and all correspondence should begin and end there.

TYzNTT7caa	A. Sentence is grammatically all right but not idiomatic: "I asked her how she felt about her husband." ["Talked" is not needed because "asked" implies talked, unless you mean you talked about other matters too; then write "I talked to her and asked her how she feels about her husband."    B. Again, it's grammatical but not quite English, especially out of context. Write: "What happened after pressing the OK button?" ["Did" implies that someone has just said something that the questioner has rejected--e. g., someone claims that a shower of lollipops came from the sky after pressing the OK button (or "ok" button), but you know that is absurd, so you reply, "No. What did come after pressing the OK button?"    C. Write it thus: "Perhaps I will go to watch a movie tonight." "Tonight" is one word. No comma after "perhaps." "Might" and "perhaps" say the same thing; althoughyou might want to express great hesitation and doubtfulness here, these circumstances do not seem to require it.|`|LwywrSRkaa	A.I talked to her and asked her how she felt about her husband.

AA11765949	Basic and Proffessional Interpersonal skills     Basic Interpersonal Communicative Skills (BICS) are language skills needed to interact in social situations, for example, when speaking to a friend on the telephone. BICS refers primarily to context-bound, face-to-face communication, like the language first learned by toddlers and preschoolers, which is used in everyday social interaction.    "Interpersonal skills" refers to mental and communicative algorithms applied during social communications and interactions in order to reach certain effects or results. The term "interpersonal skills" is used often in business contexts to refer to the measure of a person's ability to operate within business organizations through social communication and interactions. Interpersonal skills are how people relate to one another.    As an illustration, it is generally understood that communicating respect for other people or professionals within the workplace will enable one to reduce conflict and increase participation or assistance in obtaining information or completing tasks. For instance, in order to interrupt someone who is currently preoccupied with a task in order to obtain information needed immediately, it is recommended that a professional utilize a deferential approach with language such as, "Excuse me, are you busy? I have an urgent matter to discuss with you if you have the time at the moment". This allows the receiving professional to make their own judgement regarding the importance of their current task versus entering into a discussion with their colleague. While it is generally understood that interrupting someone with an "urgent" request will often take priority, allowing the receiver of the message to independently judge the request and agree to further interaction will likely result in a higher quality interaction. Following these kinds of heuristics to achieve better professional results generally results in a professional being ranked as one with 'good interpersonal skills'. Often these evaluations occur in formal and informal settings.    Having positive interpersonal skills increases the productivity in the organization since the number of conflicts is reduced. In informal situations, it allows communication to be easy and comfortable. People with good interpersonal skills can generally control the feelings that emerge in difficult situations and respond appropriately, instead of being overwhelmed by emotion.|`|bB6TE7Jiaa	In what way ?  do you want a definition or an explanation ?

When it was finally decided that the term "wog" ( a word used by members of the british army during and after World War 1 to describe any person of colour)was racist and unacceptable, the toy was renamed the "Golly".

Benefits:  1) It allows you to count the number of letters Yahoo allows before truncating a "word".  2) You can fit more (real) words onto a line.  3) In a text file or word processor your file will take less disc space.  4) You encourage your readers to use their brains more in order to decipher what you've written.  5) It takes less time to type and so you can write something more quickly.

7ZX3Ibz4aa	1.  You are correct    2.  The medium and large bronchi are wrapped with smooth muscle, which tightens to narrow the airways and relaxes to widen the airways. The walls of all the airways are lined by ciliated epithelial cells with interspersed secretory cells. The secretory cells coat the inner walls of the airways with mucus. All the cilia of the epithelial cells beat in the direction of the trachea and throat. In this way, mucus and trapped particles are continuously moved up and out of the lungs    3.  Inhaling cigarette smoke triggers inflammation throughout the airways of the lung. The inflammatory response is a stereotyped cascade of events; in COPD, it begins with the activation of local macrophages in the lung tissue; in fact, the gradual and progressive accumulation of macrophages throughout the lungs is a characteristic feature of COPD. These macrophages secrete proteasesdestructive enzymes such as elastase. Macrophages also attract neutrophils (polymorphonuclear leukocytes) from the bloodstream. The greater the number of neutrophils that invade the lung tissue, the faster the lung function declines.      I am a Respiratory Therapist (RRT) and use the site below to teach patients about COPD and its effects.

Let's say the first car has wheels with a 100 inch circumference.  This means that every time the wheel turns completely around, the car has traveled 100 inches.    Let's also say that the second car has wheels with a 50 inch circumference.  This means that every time the wheel turns completely around, the car travels 50 inches.    Now, if you get in each car and set the throttle so that they both say they're doing 40 (for example, the number doesn't really matter), you see that the first car travels twice as far as the second car in the same amount of time.  That means, the first car, with the big wheels, is faster.|`|e5886f3a1e14ace870e84a73d3571e0faa	if they are travelling at the same speed one is not going faster than the other.|`|rjac15O0aa	Are the bigger wheels the stock wheels or does the other car have donuts?

DIILQSPXaa	With the fastest growing of the economy and the lack of time, many people have been working in this new way of work.    One good example of telecommuting in our modern society is when a woman have to take care of her little baby but at same time she wants to work. As long there's no one to take care of her baby, doing a telecommuting work at home, she is able to work and take care of her *chield* with no worry.    Many young *bussiness men* start their *carrear* by *saling* their products online just being at home. It is important to mention telecommuting advantages such as low investiment because all you have to do is to buy a computer and have a internet connection at home or wherever you wish to work in.     The schedule is for sure the best point in this type of job. You do not have a specific time to get *sarted*. That means you can work whenever you want as long you want, however, such a lack of commitment requires a lot of determination. If you are not a determinated person or a *responsable* one it is better to look for a regular job.    Finally, I like the idea of freedom that the telecommuting jobs can offer but, as mentioned, it is important to have determination and be serious when working. Things will not go fine as long we mix personal life into work life.    Cheild - child  Bussiness men - bussinessmen  Carrear - career  Saling - selling  Responable - responsible  Sarted - started      :) hope I helped xo

x30SGTCtaa	Hi there.  I know what you mean about finding accurate and 'obvious' information about how to break into a University academic career.  I considered this direction after completeing my degree in Social Science and went on to do an MSc but in Sports Sci, I'm not a lecturer as I've gone down another path again! but I worked in the Uni for a while too and have spoken to alot of lecturers, so hope what I have to say is helpful:  I'd say you're on the right track to become a Lecturer, you've already got teaching experience. You should do the MSc course as you generally need a minimum of a postgrad qualification to teach in Higher Ed.  You can then get info. from the lecturers doing your course. Once you've an MSc under your belt you can apply for Higher Ed jobs it just depends whether they'll give you a go! And their person spec - all jobs are different criteria usually.  But to teach in a University as opposed to a Higher Ed college that does Degrees, it's likely you'll have to work towards a Phd/Doctorate - your MSc course can give you more details on this.  Some Uni lectureships may be willing to pay for a Phd while you teach but this all depends on whether the positions are there and advertised (and school teaching pays more at this stage).  You can do a Phd yourself (some Uni's offer funding) and then apply for Uni lecturing jobs, or chances are if you do a Phd you'll get the contacts you need to get ahead, and you can get lecturing experience while you study, which puts you in good stead.  Also look at www.jobs.ac.uk where all Uni jobs and Postgrad scholarships are.    Hope this is of some help to you?    Wendy|`|4ec5baf736e5e1b4200f6e39ea8eda12aa	Yes MSc will help though Phd would be better.  You would need to be taken-on by a university and so firstly, identify which universities are suitable. Secondly, once you have your MSc seek to obtain a position at any of those uni you selected - you would also be wise to talk with your tutors for the MSc about your aspirations.|`|3ATt7ZE6aa	Hi  I know someone who is doing a PhD in psychology and during this they have to teach at the university as it is what is required and it is away to pay for the course.

Her family, rich silk merchants from Marseilles, was against the marriage, so their engagement was broken off. Years later, she will marry one of Napoleon's marshalls, and end up Queen of Sweden!      After he was named a general, Napoleon could afford a wife, and soon found a beauty, Josephine de Beauharnais. But for all her beauty, Josephine did not produce the boy heir which Napoleon desperately needed, so in 1810, he divorced her, arranging to marry instead the young blonde daughter of the Emperor of Austria, Maria Louisa.

Ealiest forms were dances, rituals, amulets, and myths.     Greek gynecologist Soranus knew that women were fertile during ovulation and promoted the rhythm method. (Unfortunately, he was incorrect in his assumption that ovulation occurred during menstruation, rather than prior to it.)     Spermicide were created out of herbs and oils.   Ground dates, acacia tree bark, and honey together into a paste and apply it with seed wool to the vulva. Acacia ferments into lactic acid, a well-known spermicide, so this may have worked.    Soluble pessaries came into the market in the 1800s  these were quinine or cocoa butter tablets that were inserted into the vagina before intercourse. The first brand, Wife's Friend, was created by W.J. Rendell.     Oral contraceptives have been available for more than 4,000 years. Women in ancient China drank mercury to prevent pregnancy.   Women in India imbibed carrot seeds.  An aboriginal group in Eastern Canada drank a tea brewed with beaver testicles.     In Ancient Greece and Rome, the juice of the silphium plant was a popular and effective form of oral contraceptive, which women took once a month.     Prolonged lactation is another method that has been in use for many thousands of years.    There are pictures of a sheath covering a penis going on a tablet dating 1350-1200BC.    Gabriello Fallopius, the Italian discoverer of the Fallopian tubes developed a linen condom which was popular for many years.     In 1843 Goodyear developed rubber and this led to a big development in the production of condoms.     In the 1930s latex was used for them and then by 1997 polyurethane was used which was stronger and less affected by external conditions such as heat, humidity and spermicides.    Female condoms were also used, they were first available commercially in the early 1900s.    Fredrick Adolph Wilde designed the cap in about 1838. It was a rubber device designed to fit over the cervix.     Sponge soaked in brany (a spermacide) has been used for a long time.    The first contraceptive pill was produced for the general public in 1960.     Contraception by injection was first produced in the 1950s. This was discovered by Dr K Junkman.    ....    There is alot to know.
FmYkUfIDaa	Hi Gemma,                     I am having a little difficulty understanding this question. Perhaps you are asking what the advantage is when someone records something the see or hear in writing?    If we take the situation of witnessing an accident involving two motor vehicles; clearly it would make our testimony more believable if we had recorded the details in writing at the time of the accident.    If we choose not to record the details in writing and just trust our memory it may well be that at a later time we are unable to provide an accurate account because over time we may not remember sufficient details about the accident.     At worst, if we are giving evidence in court, our remembered account may well be challenged by counsel acting for the defendant.    If you watch TV soaps you will frequently see a police officer refer to his/her notes which were taken at the time of an incident.    The advantage with a written record is that it is difficult to refute.    In teaching I know that teachers are always pleased to see students take notes, not necessarily every word the Teacher says, just one-liners or key words so the student doesn't have to trust their memory at a later time when they complete assignments/ or homework.

Dmaahsc3aa	It was referred to as the New Colonies.|`|6DFhlt4daa	US History Encyclopedia: New England Colonies    Settled by Europeans, primarily the English, in the seventeenth century, New England included the Plymouth Colony (1620, absorbed by Massachusetts Bay in 1691), the Massachusetts Bay Colony (1630), Connecticut (1636), New Haven (1640), Rhode Island (1636), and New Hampshire (separated from Massachusetts Bay in 1741). The New England Colonies are best known as the destination for Puritan religious reformers and their followers. Diverse European fishermen, however, had been tapping into the vast resources off Cape Cod since the late 1500s. Religious and economic motivations merged in each New England Colony.    Prompted by just those two motivations, in 1630 approximately one thousand people set sail from England under the auspices of the Puritan-controlled Massachusetts Bay Company. Led by John Winthrop, the Puritan founders of the Massachusetts Bay Colony sought to establish a religious utopia made up of Christians who operated in a strict covenant with God.    Tensions in Massachusetts Baythe product of disagreements over what would constitute a theocratic community and government, relationships with Native Americans, and the role of wealth, status, and land in the colonyresulted early on in a threat of deportation for Roger Williams, a Puritan minister from Salem who openly challenged both church and government policy. In 1635 Williams fled south with a small band of followers to establish Providence, the first settlement in Rhode Island.

The members are generally expected to perform as dancers as well, often executing highly choreographed sequences to their own music. Although there are no distinct traits defining a boy band, one could label a band a "boy band" for following mainstream music trends, changing their appearances to adapt to new fashion trends, having elaborate dance moves, and performing elaborate shows. They can evolve out of church choral or Gospel music groups, but are often put together by talent managers or record producers who audition the groups for appearance, dancing, rapping skills, and singing ability. Boy bands often seem to be prefabricated.    Some do not play musical instruments, and the acts are essentially vocal harmony groups (though there are some exceptions, such as groups like A1, The Moffatts, South 65, Marshall Dyllon, Busted or McFly). Due to this and their general commercial orientation towards a teenybopper, teens, or preteen audience, the term has negative connotations in music journalism.

d3b8d95f3c206880dff89e3a0ed42336aa	No luck needed - it was the dinosaur that came first and the chicken was a result of dinosaur's existence!  Birds came via a mutant gene in dinosaurs - you will note that there were flying dinosaurs which laid eggs, which birds then evolved from.  As regards to which came first the chicken or the chicken egg that is a very basic question and the answer is the chicken. A chicken became a chicken via evolution. As such every egg that the evolving chicken laid was a representation of itself, so not yet a chicken egg.  As years and years go by evolution is only noticeable via what we can see things were way back rather that a day or so at a time as evolution does not happen over night.  Until that chicken was evolved into an actual chicken all the eggs laid were still not yet of a chicken as it would eventually be. The day the chicken that came from the egg of the evolving chicken and it had finally finished its subtle descent into fully formed chickenness was the day the egg that it laid became the next actual chicken!  Not such a difficult question to answer as you think.  I should also point out that the question about which came first the chicken or the egg is not actually about either a chicken or an egg its a way of questioning how all life stared but some people think this is the questioning of a genius! You could equally ask which came first the human or the sperm? If you believe in God, then as God is said to have created things as they are then the chicken would still come first so no luck needed from either side to answer. It is still the chicken if you are refering to a chicken egg but a dinosaur if you are refering to eggs in general.

PCNsRfJPaa	A paradigm is about 20 cents.  A parameter is about six feet.    Those are two really bad jokes.  But funny for those that like bad jokes.    A paradigm is the position from which someone evaluates something.  If you have sore back, and go to a Foot Doctor, his "paradigm" is feet, so he'll tell you have something wrong with your shoes, affecting your back.  If you go to a Back Doctor, his "paradigm" is backs, so he'll ignore your feet and treat your back.  I have an engineering background, so my "paradigm" is engineering.  I approach everything logically, systematically, etc..  Sometimes I can't see the solution because I'm blinded by logic, rather than emotion (like with relationships).  Ask a car maker to design a totally new car....they will start with four wheels because their "paradigm" is that cars have always had four wheels.  They have trouble thinking outside their box, i.e., outside their paradigm.    A parameter is merely the distance around something.  A fence that goes around ones property is actually going around the parameter.  In the military, one would say, "Secure the parameter."  Meaning, guard the line around our area.      The bad jokes above explained.....paradigm (pair of dimes) equals 20 cents.  Parameter (pair of meters) is about six feet.  I told you they were bad.  Engineering humor.    Peace.

jIk2ttH1aa	The IEP is really no big deal.  It's just a meeting with parents and the team to make a plan for an individualized educational plan.  Yeah, there is a lot of paperwork from psych, to send to administation etc.  But it's not overwhelming.    Also, sped teachers vary in hours, but I don't know any that work even close to 70 hours a week.  I think you should become a sped aide/ or tutor which you don't need a degree for and see if it fits you and then go for your teaching degree if you would like to advance.  Or do them both at the same time.  Become an aide and go to school evenings to get your degree.  That way you will be making connections, building resume and putting in lab time towards your degree.   Best wishes~!

1F28QvFCaa	Because nothing can live in it - it has an incredibly high concentration of salt. Google it.|`|6DFhlt4daa	The sea is called "dead" because its high salinity prevents macroscopic aquatic organisms, such as fish and aquatic plants, from living in it, though minuscule quantities of bacteria and microbial fungi are present.    http://www.answers.com/dead%20sea    The medieval travellers brought home many strange legends of the sea and its peculiarities - some absurd, others with a basis of fact. The absence of sea-birds, due to the absence of fish, probably accounts for the story that no birds could fly over it. The absence of vegetation on its shores, due to the scanty rainfall and general want of fresh water - except in the neighbourhood of springs like `Ain Feshkhah and `Ain Jidi, where a luxuriant subtropical vegetation is found - accounts for the story that no plant could live in the poisonous air which broods over the sea. The mists, due to the great heat and excessive evaporation, and the noxious miasmata, especially of the southern region, were exaggerated into the noisome vapours that the "black and stinking" waters ever exhaled. The judgment on Sodom and Gomorrah (which of course they believed to be under the waters of the lake, in accordance with the absurd theory first found in Josephus and still often repeated) blinded these good pilgrims to the ever-fresh beauty of this most lovely lake, whose blue and sparkling waters lie deep between rocks and precipices of unsurpassable grandeur. The play of brilliant colours and of ever-changing contrasts of light and shade on those rugged mountain-sides and on the surface of the sea itself might have been expected to appeal to the most prosaic. The surface of the sea is generally smooth (seldom, however, absolutely inert as the pilgrims represented it), but is frequently raised by the north winds into waves, which, owing to the weight and density of the water, are often of great force.    http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Dead_Sea    The lake contains no life except for a few kinds of microbes; sea fish put into its waters soon die.    The Dead Sea is economically important as a source of potash, bromine, gypsum, salt, and other chemical products, which are extracted inexpensively. The shores of the Dead Sea are of growing importance as a winter health resort. The lake is closely associated with biblical history; the sites of the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah are believed to lie beneath the lake.    http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/refpages/R...|`|Dmaahsc3aa	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Sea  Animals can not live in it due to the salt content in the water........it is good for it's healing qualities though..........You will automatically float in this salty water.|`|QbcnDDxUaa	The Dead Sea (Hebrew: ??? ??????????????, Ym Ha-Mela?, "Sea of Salt"; Arabic: ??????? ????????, al-Ba?r l-Mayyit, "Dead Sea") is a salt lake between Israel and the West Bank to the west, and Jordan to the east. It is 422 metres (1,385 ft) below sea level,[2] and its shores are the lowest point on the surface of the Earth on dry land. The Dead Sea is 378 m (1,240 ft) deep, the deepest hypersaline lake in the world. It is also one of the world's saltiest bodies of water, with 33.7 percent salinity. Only Lake Assal (Djibouti), Garabogazk?l and some hypersaline lakes of the McMurdo Dry Valleys in Antarctica (such as Don Juan Pond and perhaps Lake Vanda) have a higher salinity. It is 8.6 times saltier than the ocean.[3] This salinity makes for a harsh environment where animals cannot flourish, hence its name. The Dead Sea is 67 kilometres (42 mi) long and 18 kilometres (11 mi) wide at its widest point. It lies in the Jordan Rift Valley, and its main tributary is the Jordan River.  The Dead Sea has attracted visitors from around the Mediterranean basin for thousands of years. Biblically, it was a place of refuge for King David. It was one of the world's first health resorts (for Herod the Great), and it has been the supplier of a wide variety of products, from balms for Egyptian mummification to potash for fertilizers. People also use the salt and the minerals from the Dead Sea to create cosmetics and herbal sachets.|`|qahq9VaNaa	because d salinity of d water of dead sea is extreme and no organism can bear such saline extrimity and it dies eventually  hence dead sea is called so|`|xeDisZBgaa	BECAUSE THERE IS SO MUCH SALT IN IT THAT NO SPECIES CAN SURVIVE IN IT.

In times of flood, the salt content of the Dead Sea can drop from its usual 35% salinity to 30% or lower. The Dead Sea temporarily comes to life in the wake of rainy winters. In 1980, after one such rainy winter, the normally dark blue Dead Sea turned red.

7ZX3Ibz4aa	Jewish dietary laws, a kosher kitchen is designed to separate items used for preparation and serving of meat and dairy meals. Ideally, cookware, utensils, bowls, and dishes would be stored in separate drawers and cabinets.     If you buy your meat at a kosher butcher and buy only kosher certified products at the market, the only thing you need to think about is the separation of meat and dairy    Certain animals may not be eaten at all. This restriction includes the flesh, organs, eggs and milk of the forbidden animals.   Of the animals that may be eaten, the birds and mammals must be killed in accordance with Jewish law.   All blood must be drained from the meat or broiled out of it before it is eaten.   Certain parts of permitted animals may not be eaten.   Fruits and vegetables are permitted, but must be inspected for bugs   Meat (the flesh of birds and mammals) cannot be eaten with dairy. Fish, eggs, fruits, vegetables and grains can be eaten with either meat or dairy. (According to some views, fish may not be eaten with meat).   Utensils that have come into contact with meat may not be used with dairy, and vice versa. Utensils that have come into contact with non-kosher food may not be used with kosher food. This applies only where the contact occurred while the food was hot.   Grape products made by non-Jews may not be eaten.     You can read moer about the specific meat that can be eaten at the website below.  Great to see someone wanting to learn.  Good luck.

AA11334027	a.  bullying is often caused from kids wanting to feel superior to other kids. like if a kid is smaller than them, the bully will pick on that kid because he wants to feel larger.  if a kid is bullied, he will do poorly in school.   most likely will be more quiet.   he/she might stay in their room just by themselves.  it depends on if they are being hit, but the kid being bullied might have bruises or cuts.    b.  you can worsen bullying by egging them on. by telling them you want to fight. be contributing to the bullying.    c.  you can stop them by standing up for the kid. if you are the one being  bullied, tell an adult or a supervisor. they can usually stop the situation.  even tell a parent or guardian. the only real way to stop bullying is to not let it get to you. if they see that their bullying is making an affect on you, they will keep it up.

Is it an online or an in-print newsletter?     If each one of these themes is a separate newsletter, you might try devoting just one column or page to the theme with suitable illustrations and maybe some myth busting.    What volunteer duties does your community offer? Are there some suitable for kids?     Does your readership know the story of St. Patrick?

lCtl1L3kaa	I tried that too.  It only worked for me because I ended up as the only candidate with any experience.  I was over qualified, but took the job.  I don't think it was my creative resume.  After a while, I re-wrote it to be more "normal."    You may be a bit right about corporate America having little creativity.  But they're looking for someone who will fit into their organization.  Your creativity can come into play once you're in the door.    I commend your non-conformist attitude, but the key is to be a chameleon.  You can be creative, and still conform to traditional resume writing styles.      It all boils down to:  what do you want, and how can you get it?  If your resume style isn't working, figure out what's more important to you- adhering to your style choice or getting an interview?    If you want the job, think about what they'd like to hear from a candidate, and give it to them.  Get hired, then unleash your creative side.  They have a comfort zone and a pile of resumes that don't make them raise their eyebrows.  You need creativity to make your resume shine and stand out among the rest, but don't over do it.    You need to find some middle ground.  There's lots of middle ground between "boring" and "weird."    I don't know what kinds of jobs you're applying for, nor what your resume looks like, so this is just some generic advice.  I'd be interested to see exactly what you're talking about.|`|R4WX5twzaa	My advice to you is if you want to be a part of corporate America, you'd better get rid of that personality of yours and write a resume. =P No one likes the creative ones!!

The asterisk can denote a wildcard, repetition, notations, multiplication, and footnotes.    The following will give you the ways to use and understand asterisks.    * Omit letters in your sentence. Sometimes when it is necessary to omit certain words--such as obscene or profane words which are unprintable--you can use asterisks to show that letters have been omitted.   * Put in asterisks when you want to reference a source. An asterisk tells the reader to look for the reference source elsewhere. Usually when writing a long paper with multiple references you would use numbers to reference sources, but if you only have one or two sources, you can use asterisks.   * Use asterisks when you are omitting words from a quote; for example, "One nation *** our nation."   * Insert asterisks when making a list. Asterisks can be used in place of other symbols when making a list. There is an example in the resource section.   * Place asterisks in sentences when you want to make a point and italics aren't available.   * Rate movies and restaurants. When used in ratings, you can use multiple asterisks to indicate your preferences. More asterisks mean the more you liked it.   * Write your resume. Use asterisks in your resume instead of bullets, it will make it stand out and give you a better chance of getting your foot in the door.   * Understand the spacing when using asterisks. No space is used in reference sources. Space twice after an asterisk when it is at the end of a sentence. Space once after a single asterisk when it is within a sentence. Space once before and after each asterisk when you use asterisks to show an omission of a paragraph--usually three asterisks are used. When you are using asterisks to show omitted letters you don't use spaces.|`|Ftm7SFHmaa	what sasha said|`|4AbXxowTaa	F word?  Fornication Under Consent of the King|`|WkRlgikIaa	Don't know to which word you are referring, but here are a couple of choices:    "s**t (v.)    O.E. scitan, from P.Gmc. *skit-, from PIE *skheid- "split, divide, separate." Related to shed (v.) on the notion of "separation" from the body (cf. L. excrementum, from excernere "to separate"). It is thus a cousin to science and conscience. The noun is O.E. scitte "purging;" sense of "excrement" dates from 1585, from the verb."    "f**k   a difficult word to trace, in part because it was taboo to the editors of the original OED when the "F" volume was compiled, 1893-97. Written form only attested from early 16c. OED 2nd edition cites 1503, in the form fukkit; earliest appearance of current spelling is 1535 -- "Bischops ... may f**k thair fill and be vnmaryit" [Sir David Lyndesay, "Ane Satyre of the Thrie Estaits"], but presumably it is a much more ancient word than that, simply one that wasn't likely to be written in the kind of texts that have survived from O.E. and M.E. Buck cites proper name John le ****** from 1278. The word apparently is hinted at in a scurrilous 15c. poem, titled "Flen flyys," written in bastard L. and M.E. The relevant line reads:  Non sunt in celi   quia fuccant uuiuys of heli  "They [the monks] are not in heaven because they f**k the wives of Ely." Fuccant is pseudo-L., and in the original it is written in cipher. The earliest examples of the word otherwise are from Scottish, which suggests a Scandinavian origin, perhaps from a word akin to Norw. dial. fukka "copulate," or Swedish dial. focka "copulate, strike, push," and fock "penis." Another theory traces it to M.E. fkye, fike "move restlessly, fidget," which also meant "dally, flirt," and probably is from a general North Sea Gmc. word, cf. M.Du. fokken, Ger. ficken "f**k," earlier "make quick movements to and fro, flick," still earlier "itch, scratch;" the vulgar sense attested from 16c. This would parallel in sense the usual M.E. slang term for "have sexual intercourse," swive, from O.E. swifan "to move lightly over, sweep" (see swivel). Chronology and phonology rule out Shipley's attempt to derive it from M.E. firk "to press hard, beat." As a noun, it dates from 1680. French foutre and Italian fottere look like the Eng. word but are unrelated, derived rather from L. futuere, which is perhaps from PIE base *bhau(t)- "knock, strike off," extended via a figurative use "from the sexual application of violent action" [Shipley; cf. the sexual slang use of bang, etc.]. Popular and Internet derivations from acronyms (and the "pluck yew" fable) are merely ingenious trifling. The O.E. word was h?man, from ham "dwelling, home," with a sense of "take home, co-habit." F**k was outlawed in print in England (by the Obscene Publications Act, 1857) and the U.S. (by the Comstock Act, 1873). The word may have been shunned in print, but it continued in conversation, especially among soldiers during WWI."|`|agNjPmBWaa	which word are you talking about???

Once you have a shortlist do some research on each field that is left. You have to like what you are doing. if you think you should study something that does not motivate you but might make you a lot of money instead, you will most likely fail in that pursuit. Pick something that motivates you on your shortlist. if nothing motivates you on your shortlist, then you may have to deal with a different issue which is lack of motivation. This is usually overcome by being more informed. If you know someone and you aspire to get involved in what they are doing, seek out and ask them what steps they took to get there, and any advice they may have. People are usually very happy to pass on such details when others are interested in them.    Good luck

A legal guardian is someone (usually parent/parents) who take responsibility for your upbringing and looking after you.   However, not all children have parents to care for them so a legal guardian is appointed by law (grandparents or others) to care for them.

A2 is worth more Ucas points  A - 120  B - 100  C - 80  D - 60    whereas AS levels are:  A - 60  B - 50  C - 40  D - 30    But if you have a full Alevel you count ONLY the Alevel points not also the AS points.

If you are doing distance learning you may be doing all the modules at the same time.    Say an A level consists of 6 mdules    3 modules = AS, then you can do the other three to make it A Level    or you can sit all 6 at once leading to A Level|`|vl0HWTDJaa	They're the same value but because it's impossible to have an A2 by itself (you can only take it once you've done the AS), people only talk about points in terms of either an AS or a full A-level (which is double). Some universities take people solely on points but often they say you need at least 3 a-levels or something like that so it would probably be better to take 3 A2s than 2 A2s and another AS unless you know the university don't need that.|`|KpDfWlxVaa	You cant have an A2 without doing the AS first.

AA10464818	NOT TRUE    The government is NOT in the business of giving away free money for the sake of giving away money. There are no grants for paying bills, no grants for paying off credit cards, no grants for getting out of debt and no grants for simply fattening your wallet.    Grants are free, but it means OBLIGATION. You will be obligated to do as the grant sets out to do. Grants have objectives, and your purpose must fit the objective of the grant.    For one, you have to write the grant application and the grant application is not a simple document - you have to explain how your purpose for applying for the grant fits well with the objectives set out by the grant.    There is a stringent review process through a committee. You will compete with other applicants for the grant money, and this grant review committee will evaluate the merits of each proposal. Only those that they feel exemplifies the objective of the grant will be approved.    You can go to the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) http://www.cfda.gov and Grants.gov http://www.grants.gov - these are two sites created by the federal government to provide transparency and information on grants. Browse through the listings and see if you can find any grant that would support your purposes.    Even if you buy books on "how to get grants" or list that supposedly has information on grants -- all of them are mere rehash of what CFDA has, albeit packaged differently.    Note though that these grants generally support non-profit organizations, intermediary lending institutions, and state and local governments. Most of the federal grants are given to specific target groups with specific requirements (e.g. minority business owners involved in transportation related contracts emanating from DOT - Grant 20.905 Disadvantaged Business Enterprises Short Term Lending Program. Individuals especially for personal purposes are not eligible for federal grants.     Grants are also often given to non profit groups or organizations involved in training or other similar activities (grant 59.043 Women's Business Ownership Assistance that are given to those who will create women's business center that will train women entrepreneurs|`|LfrMwwT5aa	try this    http://www.freestuffpromo.com/grants|`|zf50ZMm5aa	There are grants available, but they have nothing to do with Obama or the stimulus package.  In fact, these programs are widely available and the information is free (so don't pay for cds or subscriptions).  Search your city and county website - typically the housing department, community development department and human resources department.    Our website posts the grant programs (free) whenever we find them to help give everyone an idea of the programs that are out there and where to find them.

If you need to be literate and numerate and you aren't you will soon be found out. Just tell the truth about the exams, and the reasons for not taking them.|`|7deb425958c53615415ce326bcbf08e0aa	These days employers photocopy certificates.    If you lie on your CV and you are found out it can be instant dismissal for gross misconduct, even if it is years later.    And don't you think it's unfair that you might be offered a place on the basis of lies instead of someone who has got GCSE's.|`|B1CfeLu9aa	some check - and it's worse to be found out surely!  why not explain to them why you didn't take your gcse's, and then offer to show them your skills and capabilities (perhaps a written or practical test?) also, offer to retake your exams and state you are more than willing to undertake further training and qualifications in the future.  employers state they want qualifications purely as a benchmarking system, but they are also looking for commitment, and enthusiasm. if you can prove yourself in other ways, then they may favour you more highly then others with the 'right' qualifications|`|da59b44452c599e7a03e6a7a72f23754aa	Some of them do check these things so I wouldn't try it if I were you. Why don't you go for the interview and just be honest like you have here? Good numeracy and literacy skills are an asset to any employer.|`|AA10988215	'Must have an educational background' is very vague!  Do they mean GCSE's, A levels, a degree....a PhD?!  I have a feeling this probably means that you must have at least some GCSE's but they may also mean they want you to have a vocational qualification from college.    I'm a little confused as to your question.  It appears as though you are asking should you lie on your CV, but you're also saying you already have an interview, which to me would suggest you have already submitted a CV.  To be honest, lying on your CV is never a good idea and chances are if they are specifying some kind of 'educational background' they will probably ask to see any certificates you claim to have.    If you haven't submitted a CV with lies on it then go to the interview and do your best, you may still get the job.  If you have submitted a CV with lies on it then maybe you should  give up on this particular job-it would be humiliating for you to get caught out.    I sympathise with your situation as I can see you really do want the job but if they do want someone with certificates I think this job won't be one for you.  If not, there will always be others and getting knock-backs are all part of getting a job I'm afraid-I've had a few myself too!    Best of luck to you.

13KBWzBXaa	eji (who won't let anyone add him) :'-(  explained it exactly!     Those who write that it's too complicated to explain or who spout platitudes about how kind and voluntary socialism is, are simply liars.    Socialism, Modern Liberalism, Communitarianism are all wiggle-words for Communism.  Socialism is not Communism-Lite.    If you want to know exactly what Socialism entails, read SOCIALISM by Ludwig von Mises.  Here's a link to the entire book that you can read online for free:  http://www.econlib.org/library/Mises/msS...|`|SYkzZtW7aa	The term socialism has been used to describe positions as far apart as anarchism, Soviet state communism, and social democracy; however, it necessarily implies an opposition to the untrammeled workings of the economic market.The socialist parties that have arisen in most European countries from the late 19th century have generally tended toward social democracy.    (copy & paste from the Apple Dictionary)        ... although I guess an *exact* explanation would fill a book or two. :(    |`|EVwllMNqaa	haha no these answer are so funny.    Ok some countries that have Socialism have it set where you can only buy a house that is in your pay range. So if you made 100,000 a year you can only buy a house in 90,000 to 110,000 dollar range..if you rent the house there is a range for you..same with cars same with everything..but the Government controls range.|`|6bxOT9qJaa	Take money from somebody pot, and spread that money to less fortunate persons, pot.

JR3Ol1VGaa	Because no one viewpoint is going to be completely authoritative.    Every person, regardless of how experienced, intelligent or insightful they are brings their own ideas and biases to any work. If you read only a limited number of sources on a topic, what you learn will be skewed by that person's biases and focus heavily on their own ideas.    Once you have read many books on a topic, you will begin to understand that different viewpoints carry different weight and can provide different perspectives on what you are trying to learn. You will be able to identify the biases and the individual quirks of what you are reading. This is as true of fiction as non-fiction. If you read lots of different kinds of novels you will gain insight into different views.    The point is, that the sum of human knowledge cannot be put into a single book. Human knowledge and experience is about argument and disagreement. Understanding the argument IS understanding the subject matter. If you take any one viewpoint as irrefutable fact, you risk blinding yourself to other opinions which may be just as, if not more valid.|`|8CL8o8K0aa	This will help them to widen their knowledge base.

Also you learn faster while you are younger.|`|DIlNnjf8aa	You're relying on a false assumption about what children used to do. It has never been the norm in the past for children and teenagers to play around.    In previous ages, the work of the parents was connected with the home. Children lived with and worked with their parents on a regular daily basis. They didn't get shipped off to school to learn. They were actual participants in the home economy. Women and girls stayed home and made all kinds of home manufactures, from candles to embroidery and so on. Men and boys worked together on the farm, the ranch, in the store, etc. And in the case of both boys and girls, this was from an early age.    This is still the case in some areas of the world. I was in another country and paid my restaurant bill to the cashier, a 6-year-old. I gave him the money and he promptly gave me the correct amount in change. He already knew his math better than most children several years older.    Today, the work that parents do is removed from the home. The father or the mother goes to some job in a factory. Not only do children not participate, they're not allowed by government rules and insurance regulations.    The problem in a high-tech society is that children need to learn a very great deal before they can even begin. Want to be an economist, a statistican, an engineer? You've got to begin early and learn.    If you don't want to be part of that system, you can work to develop your own lifestyle. Some people still live as I described it above, such as the Amish. And there have been "back to the woods" movements and such. But to get there, you're probably going to have to do all the learning that this society demands, make a pile of money, and then do what you really want. See below for one example:
SBx28SIDaa	You need to keep learning to keep earning. In a tough economy that we are facing, the better educated that you are the more chance that you will be employed.

Like catching snakes. - Marlon Brando    An actor is at most a poet and at least an entertainer. - Marlon Brando    If we are not our brother's keeper, at least let us not be his executioner - Marlon Brando    I have eyes like those of a dead pig. - Marlon Brando    The only thing an actor owes his public is not to bore them. - Marlon Brando    I don't mind that I'm fat. You still get the same money. - Marlon Brando    The only reason I'm in Hollywood is that I don't have the moral courage to refuse the money. - Marlon Brando    He's the kind of guy that when he dies, he's going up to heaven and give God a bad time for making him bald. - Marlon Brando    If you want something from an audience, you give blood to their fantasies.

R5UIMBvcaa	I can't answer for other countries, but in the US one typically needs a bachelor's degree in elementary or early childhood education.  Typically that program includes a well-rounded curriculum in liberal arts, classes in teaching those subjects in elementary school, some psychology, classes in educational theory and methods, and several weeks of supervised student teaching.  This last requirement is usually completed in the last year, and some students have been known to go through all the classwork and then discover at the end that they just don't like teaching!  However, many programs include early hand-on experience in the classroom with young children, so that would-be teachers don't have an unpleasant surprise at the end!     For me (a retired college professor from a family of teachers, including a sister who taught kindergarten for years), the most important quality for anyone planning to teach in elementary or primary school is a love for children.  Both teacher and pupils can suffer real damage if that ingredient isn't there!
AA10297143	Tutoring is usually not for teachers, rather it is for excellent students to make a bit of cash, but if there is not a conflict of interest, I suppose you could do it and charge about $20 an hour.  You can also sign up for summer classes for extra income, or perhaps teach driver's ed on the side as well.

Those salaries are pretty good and teachers have access to a wealth of material to teach.  What you need to do is study the '''educational needs and recomendations''' for 3 year olds and 11 month olds.  That's in all the baby books everywhere.    Home schooling starts when the child is at the age that the child would normally go off to school to start a formal education.  Before that we are all teachers for our children whether we realize it or not.

AA10297143	GED is not the way to go if you can graduate at all.  My brother earned a GED and works himself to death for pennies on the dollar.  You have to have some sort of skill that you can use your hands if you can't use your brain.

You could become a bum and do nothing.  Not a good choice, but a possible one.    You could go to an Academy for firefighting or police.     Or a specialty school for something like art or dancing (slightly different than a trade school, because these are things you CAN take in a traditional college, but you want to specialize in it) some of these specialty schools are really great, some are just ways to getting in, without having the grades to go to a normal college.|`|2646a4e9d6d4e936660d70ff922397f3aa	There are a lot of different kinds of colleges and vocational schools, you could go into a religious order (although they would probably want you to go to college too), or you could commit a crime and end up incarcerated.|`|rLmDiWhFaa	careers.scienceontheweb.net - try their database.

But at the end of the day its your choice and you should take whatever subjects you like the best.|`|P1H02dqgaa	Hi Jessica!    Congratulations on your GCSEs!  Well done!    Well, I guess as to what you should take at A-level largely depends on what you'd like to do within the business arena and if you're considering going onto University.      If you're thinking of going to University to do a general business degree - have a look at some University prospectuses and see if there are any specific subjects that are required to take a course you might be interested in.  I know it'll be a couple of years ahead yet, but it'll give you an idea of possible subject and grade requirements.  Many business courses don't require definitive subjects and ask instead for 3 A-levels at certain grades, so subject choice isn't essential.  But if you want a little grounding in business ideas and theories before you go onto Higher Education, perhaps an Economics, Business Studies or Sociology A-level would be useful.    However, when entering the job market, either straight after A-levels, or laterly after University, there is something worth remembering.  Many people get degrees so in order to stand out from other applicants - you'll need a good quality degree (1st or 2:1) along with additional skills.  Try and get working experience when you can, do voluntary roles that show you working with others, taking on responsibilities, using your own initiative etc.    I'm 35, did GCSEs, A-levels and a degree.  I've worked in business for many years and been responsible for recruiting many employees.  I promise you that there is nothing I learnt in my studies that I could not have learnt by going straight into the job market instead.  That's by no means trying to put you off - infact I encourage further and higher education.  But if it's business you want to work in, and you also want to go to University - then don't limit yourself to simply a Business degree.  A good English Literature degree for example, will stand you in just as good stead (and some employers even prefer it!).    My point is, unless you need to take specific subjects for a specific career - choose what you enjoy the most.  As the work gets harder, it's much better studying things you like doing than trying to trudge through a workload you cannot stand.    I wish someone had told me this when I was your age (and I'm not that old!!), but I got wrapped up with what I thought I should do, what other people thought I should do, career expectations etc etc.  I neglected to consider what I really enjoyed.  So pick what you like to do - experience and other skills will always fill in any gaps in knowledge when you get into the workplace.    All the very best of luck, hon.  Karen
U66CDN2Taa	They essentially mean the same thing, however, the dictionary defines allegiance as the commitment of a subordinate to a superior or of an individual to a group cause.

If you see a school of your choice, you can go to the school and ask for an application form, usually before the summer holidays so you can get your application in before the school term starts.

It's completely normal to feel like you don't fit in. I'm sure you have some friends in school though since almost everyone does in high school. No, just having a GED doesn't automatically qualify you as stupid, but when it comes to getting a good job, graduating from high school and then a four-year college is almost completely necessary nowadays. I think high schoolers are too young and immature (no matter what you think) to realize the value of an education.    Edit: My advice is: stay in school. Look at the economy. It's already extremely difficult to get and keep a good job. Without the proper education, it will be nearly impossible.

If you go after graduation it can be affordable. GRE and TOFEL are mostly after graduation. Becoming space scientist is a long way ahead and getting into NASA still further. Right now you have to complete schooling with Science Maths and English as the main subjects - go for IIT coaching with your +2 level. If you can get into an IIT that will take you nearer to your dream. Even if you can not get into IIT going in for B.Sc from a very good college - HINDU of Delhi Univ or the like and then M.Sc., by the time you reach these levels - you'll be able to see more clearly the options available leading to NASA/ISRO etc. Best of luck.

Have you seen Tom today?    but if you talk about  past time.. did you see tom yesterday? is wha you have to use... seen is the past participle of see.. we only use them in present perfect tense and other perfect tenses. check this website about tenses... esl.about.com|`|zQB0kEmcaa	1st sentence is the past simple and generally does not get used with unfinshed time (today)    2nd sentence: is the present perfect that can be used with unfinished time ( today )|`|ig0miCndaa	both mean the same thing|`|C7aJ9nCqaa	Did and have is same :)  don't think so much

In other words, high school only matters inasmuch as it lets you get into a good college to begin with.  You go to college, do extremely well, and then go to work for a minimum of 5 years before you are allowed into the program.  Basically, what they are looking for is strong evidence of business success (based on your 5 or more years of substantial work experience) and academic capability (based on your grades in college).  They don't look at your high school GPA or whether or not you were in an IB program in high school at all.  Any scholarships you might get to college will look good, but are far less important than how you actually do in college and in your worklife afterward.|`|rLmDiWhFaa	careers.scienceontheweb.net - it has info about getting into this school, tips to apply and grades requirements.|`|7NOYD3fNaa	Study your a@@ off!!

Students usually get a on campus job to support themselves.......but as there is so much depression in US ,u have to b very careful while making ur decisin.........But there r student areas where rent, food, other necessities r very cheaper then the rest part of the city    I'll advice u to to do ur bachelors from ur own country and do the masters from US...By the time u do bachelors economy will be stable.....    But i can give u a rough estimate 1500 dollars will be ur own personal expense for a month..........and ur tution or course money will b a lot(large or very large amount
VnzakYDCaa	Here you have a list of "interesting" debate topics that people could argue about :)|`|TGuyq4sGaa	Abortion. I think is one of the best and its a 2 faced topic that will always be fought over.
2646a4e9d6d4e936660d70ff922397f3aa	According to their website, tuition alone is $36,000 this year, and the total costs (including room and board, etc., are estimated at $58,068.  That is for this year.  Now if you assume that tuition will go up at least 5% per year, and that since you have not yet applied there, I'm assuming that you won't start until at least 2011-12.  That means that your total costs would probably be over $250,000 by the time you graduate.    Not everyone gets scholarships (it is only a small percentage of applicants), nor is there a standard amount for scholarships.  The financial aid office will look at the financial status of each applicant's family and your achievements to see if you are eligible for any forms of financial aid, ranging from grants to work-study to scholarships to loans.  That will be different for each person.    UCLA and UNC are both public schools, so the amounts depend on whether you are considered a resident of each of those states.  UCLA estimates that it will cost a California resident living in the dorms a total of $25,135 and a non-resident a total of $43,623 this year (again, you need to adjust for increasing costs over the next few years.  UNC lists costs for North Carolina residents living in the dorms this year at $16,578, and for non-residents at $34,082.  Again, multiply that by 4 years and adjust the numbers for tuition increases each year.

It just means tell a story about an afternoon without Mom and Dad. Starting from what happened first and ending at the end of the afternoon.

UEdNd3a3aa	you can always go away from the normal traditional speech topics and write a speech on "giving speeches"     use examples like public speaking is the 2nd greatest human fear, next to the fear of spiders or snakes. It is greater than the fear of death.   Go into the different emotions and anxieties people feel when having to get in front of people and speaking, etc.     Another off the wall but super fun topic (I actually did this in Jr. High) " Mops "     I made an off the wall speech from the point of view of a mop. How it often feels mistreated, we try to drown it every time we use it. We compare bad hair days as mop heads, from the point of view of a mop, they think their hair is great, and feel belittled by such comparison. How they are shoved away in dark closets,  and they are actually afraid of the dark. Normally stored with dusty brooms, and they are allergic to dust.  Great fun now with all the tv commercials for new products to replace the mobs. I know I've seen one where the mop is sending telegrams to the owner to take them back.     I was also really shy, and doing something so unconventional made it easier to just get up and be silly. I was so afraid of people laughing at me doing something "normal", so I thought if I did something that I expected them to laugh, gave me the opportunity to laugh too, made a lighter easier atmosphere. Our little speak off was done by classes and then there were 2 people from each class asked to present their speeches to the school and parents. Mine was chosen.     I later did one in high school on a very conventional topic, wasn't nearly as fun, I was so nervous, stumbled all over my words. etc. So ever since, every time I get in front of a group of people to make a speech (which actually occurs quite a bit), I always try to add some humor, just helps to lighten up the mood of the room.|`|BM6veAseaa	When making a good speech it is essential to be prepared, and know your subject well.  Whichever one you feel you have a strong opinion or understanding of should be the topic you choose.  Good luck to you.

lqbAA0Ytaa	A potometer is a device that measures the rate at which a plant draws up water. Since the plant draws up water as it loses it by transpiration, you are able to measure the rate of transpiration. The basic elements of a potometer are:    ? A plant cutting   ? A calibrated pipette to measure water loss   ? A length of clear plastic tubing   ? An air-tight seal between the plant and the water-filled tubing     http://images.google.com/imgres?imgurl=h...              .|`|Dwlzy9Cxaa	To measure the rate transpiration.
AA10276327	The development of the 10-codes began, in 1937, at a time when police radio channels were limited to reduce use of speech on the radio. Credit to the originator goes to Charles "Charlie" Hopper. He was the Communications Director at the Illinois State Police, District 10, located in Pesotum, Illinois. Hopper was involved in radio for many years and saw a need to abbreviate radio transmissions on State Police bands.[2] Experienced radio operators know that the first syllable of a transmission is frequently not going to be understood, but is a necessary part of "tuning in"; hence preceding every code with "ten" allows a better chance of understanding the critical portion. Also the radios of the day were based on vacuum tubes, with a small motor-generator (called a dynamotor) used to generate the high voltage (300-600 volts, depending on the type of radio) needed to operate the transmitter, and the dynamotor took 1/10 to 1/4 of a second to "spin up". The officers were trained to push the microphone button, and wait a moment, then talk, but sometimes they would forget and preceeding every code with "ten-" gave the radio transmitter time to come up to full power.|`|frwlypDWaa	It was invented back in the '30s as part of a longer list of "10 codes" to represent various words. The guy who invented the list was from the 10th district of the Illinois State Police. The "ten" alerted the listener that another number was coming, and to listen carefully. They wanted to minimize the use of police radio frequencies by using codes instead of words and sentences.|`|QTiTDz4yaa	It is only one of MANY "10 codes" that were developed as "short hand" codes when communicating over short wave radio.

Parkinson's disease (also known as Parkinson disease or PD) is a degenerative disorder of the brain (central nervous system) that often impairs motor skills, speech, and other functions.    Parkinson's disease belongs to a group of conditions called movement disorders. It is characterized by muscle rigidity, tremor, a slowing of physical movement (bradykinesia) and, in extreme cases, a loss of physical movement (akinesia). The primary symptoms are the results of decreased stimulation of the motor cortex by the basal ganglia, normally caused by the insufficient formation and action of dopamine, which is produced in the dopaminergic neurons of the brain.

It is characterized by muscle rigidity, tremor, a slowing of physical movement (bradykinesia) and, in extreme cases, a loss of physical movement (akinesia). The primary symptoms are the results of decreased stimulation of the motor cortex by the basal ganglia, normally caused by the insufficient formation and action of dopamine, which is produced in the dopaminergic neurons of the brain. Secondary symptoms may include high level cognitive dysfunction and subtle language problems. PD is both chronic and progressive.    PD is the most common cause of chronic progressive parkinsonism, a term which refers to the syndrome of tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia and postural instability. PD is also called "primary parkinsonism" or "idiopathic PD" (classically meaning having no known cause although many genetic mutations associated with PD have since been discovered). While many forms of parkinsonism are "idiopathic", "secondary" cases may result from toxicity most notably of drugs, head trauma, or other medical disorders. The disease is named after English physician James Parkinson, who made a detailed description of the disease in his essay: "An Essay on the Shaking Palsy" (1817).  this is not my information, it's from this web site: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's...

I offer you this because the same problems arose when I was your age,   I was given this advice by Judge Mathis  the same one that is on TV.  if you just think about the outcome and decide to take hold of your life, all this will be a bore to you and you will never look back. don't give up, many have and you will pass them on the street with a lunch bag in their hands.   good luck and keep on asking yourself those questions.|`|xNFZtF84aa	the best way for you to pass school and still have time to yourself and others. is to began a schedule! it may sound a little lame to you but it really does help.  first you need to identify what things in your day matter the most to you. like tv. or napping.  start color coding you agenda   a simple key like this: red- due tomorrow      yellow- due next week  orange- test    blue- project.      once you have an organized homework system where you keep track of everything you do at school and what needs to be done at home.  a simple change in schedule will help you get back on track. though its fine for you to want to lounge when you get home from a seven hour day in classes.  you also want to remember that it is important that you do well in school!  so try a new change of pace- instead of coming home and sleeping and not doing your work you can sleep for an hour then get up and do your work then go on with your daily schedule.  another way to solve being really tired when you get home is your sleep patterns.  try this; going to bed five minutes earlier each night and getting up five minutes later each day.  start off with five and work your way up to an hour until you see results.     or just turn the tv off pop some energy pills motivate yourself and do your work.  whichever works for you!

mGvSEY6Saa	it depends on what school she goes to, she should be able to resit it as it gives the pupil and the teacher a rough idea of the mark in the final exam, and if she cannot make the final exam she can appeal and use her prelim grade, so your neice should be able to sit it at a later date :)
heIhW2ezaa	Concentration is a process that requires preparation.    Remove or get away from distractions - noise, people, TV, reminders, switch off the mobile etc.    Increase your motivation for doing the thing itself. You're focussing for a reason. Remind yourself that you do actually WANT to focus because of whatever the end result might be - a book read, a letter written and so on.     Reward yourself when you've concentrated on the task. Concentration has to be learned. Be glad for any improvement.     Stop worrying and it'll be easier. (Worrying is also just another distraction).

dae1d378a16dab63f48240cfd27d72f3aa	Trust me.... They know you are growing up.  They LOVE you and want the best for you.  Be happy about that. there are lots of people your age who can't say that.  Your parents know (from experience) how fast life goes after you finish school, Maybe they just want you to enjoy/ appreciate that while you can.      And btw.... they probably have plans to renovate your room and turn it into a den when you go to college,  they just don't want to rush you.    Oh..........so when you go to college your mom will be really alone  right?  I assume she is a single mom??    Well you can't blame her for feeling this way.  It's not that she wants to hold you back.  It's hard for mothers to let their children spread their wings,  they know all about the windows their little birds can crash into.      She will be fine, just understand that your mom will be truely alone and it's going to be tough on her for a while.  Just remember to call her  and come home for regular visits. You will be off making new friends and starting your new life as a college student while your mom has the same life at home,  but now she is alone.  it's hard enough for a couple to send their child off to college. but at least they still have each other.... but as a single mom........  ooooh that's got to be hard.     Just remember that she is feeling this way because she LOVES YOU MORE THAN ANYTHING....
JPm6sD3Laa	Well, before the industrial revolution, life was focused more on farming and making all the things you needed. People made their own clothes and farmed for their food. During the beginning of the industrial revolution, cotton farms became big because of the cotton gin. This made the slave trade big. Then factories started. Little towns turned into big cities because of the factories. People worked in the factories all day. They had horrible conditions and low pay. They then used the little pay they got to buy the food they needed from larger farms. It was the start of a money oriented society. Also, a lot of children and women worked in the factories because you could pay them less.|`|grKtTRYtaa	How much research have you done, or do want someone to write it for you?

71yXXY3eaa	Usually an A for a place like Harvard.    I would not lose heart if you get an A- or B+ because you can compensate for that by doing exceptionally well later on or by doing commendable extracurricular activities or community service.    It also depends on your school.  Grades are not something colleges look at with the same lens at every school.  For example, colleges will know if your high school has extremely high standards for getting A's relative to other high schools and will judge you accordingly.    In the end, the answer to your question is almost impossible to answer because you are a freshman and your entire high school transcript and history is not able to be viewed.|`|lorq6MKmaa	lol an A    You'll need a high ACT/SAT score, lots of AP classes with A's in them, things outside of school,  and of course, passion toward that school.|`|EEAJyi8Aaa	it is a,a+,o

eGI5s8R5aa	As someone who has struggled with weight my entire life, I truly feel for you. It is unfair when you feel singled out or alienated by your peers because of your outward appearance but particularly upsetting when this treatment comes from a professor, mentor, or someone else whom you've been taught to respect. If it is still bothering you this badly, I would talk to him.  I know you said you aren't comfortable doing this but sometimes you have to bite the bullet. Let him know that what he said was hurtful and embarrassing and that pointing out your physical flaws in the presence of your peers was NOT the way to offer his "help".   I think it is particularly important that you do this now and as calmly and professionally as you can manage so as to make an impact on him. He may not truly be aware of how detrimental comments like that can be and if he gets by saying it to you, he may say things like that to others.   You sound like a relatively strong, stable, and intelligent person so while I'm sure his words stung, you will certainly get over them. However, the next person might not be so lucky. . .I hope you will find the courage to confront him.|`|tX4RNX1faa	you contact a lawyer and then the news channels|`|HH6cIYUjaa	That is so horrible. I would listen to your friend and go to the Admins office. Your teacher should be fired for saying that to you. That IS discrimination and you can get him in trouble for that.|`|NBBeIMT9aa	You need to go talk to the administrator. AT least like the vice principal, if not the principal. This teacher is stepping out of bounds, way across lines that are acceptable. Talking to him would not be the right idea. This can't just stay between you and the teacher. You have to get someone with authority invovled.|`|AA12035836	Go ahead and complain him to the admin!  He's not supposed to say such stuff. Moreover, try not to bother about such people as he means nothing to you and has no meaning in your life, either. Try to concentrate on more important things in life such as your career and much more. Take a look at the more important people in your life. Think positive. Dont take whatever that stupid teacher says, so seriously. There's more to life than just being gorgeous and slim. You must be good at other things. Think about them. You are special in your own way.  You must complain him to the admin and just forget about it. Rest will be taken care of itself, i'm sure.  Good luck =D|`|x8k4jCpYaa	According the the current BMI charts most doctors use now and the National Institute of Health, almost everyone in this country is obese...meaning FAT! I am one of them and my family Wii Fit game calls me "obese" every time I step on the pad!  You are obviously sensitive about this issue so it is important that you get it resolved. If you chose to talk to the teacher, do it with a parent/guardian and a school administrator present, don't confront the teacher alone! It may be that the teacher did not intend to hurt your feelings, just isn't very good at expressing a concept, which is sort of sad for a teacher! You refer to other incidents with the same teacher which either means he may have it out for you, or you are simply becoming more sensitive to his comments as a result of not getting earlier conflicts resolved.   At any rate, if you do need help with the weight issue it isn't really the teacher's duty but may be showing a level of concern that you are not taking as help. Don't assume that the teacher was calling you out to make you feel less secure or burn you in front of the other students, and don't assume the other students are on your side, if they laughed about it they are as guilty, or more so, of an insult as the teacher may be! By all means, make sure this gets resolved, you don't need to be worrying about this all through the school year!|`|xpiGWrdMaa	That wasn't very nice. What a d*ck. Kids are so self conscious about their weight as it is and I think that was so insensitive and dangerous to your self image.|`|2646a4e9d6d4e936660d70ff922397f3aa	I'm so sorry.  As someone who has struggled with her weight all of her life, I know how upsetting this can be.  Unfortunately, there are a lot of people out there who think it is their duty to do something about everyone else's weight problems, and will point it out and offer "help". Which, as you know, only tends to make things worse. Is he a diet expert?  Why would he have any authority in setting up a diet for you?    Frankly, this could be dangerous.  It is arrogant to offer help to someone on a perceived problem that they haven't pointed out themselves.  How would he like it if you offered to help him with his dandruff or bad breath?    The thing is that this is not illegal or, most likely, outside of the school rules.  And since he apologized, however awkwardly, you know that he wasn't TRYING to hurt you; he just did.  If you aren't willing to let him know how hurtful this was for you, then there isn't much you can do before next period.  If there is a counselor in school you trust, you could tell that person what happened and, more importantly, how it made you feel.  If not, can you write him a note or an email letting him understand the impact this had on you?|`|mMFJrPbvaa	You should grow up and get thicker skin.  How are your grades?  Maybe thats why he called you what he did.  Are you active like play sports, cheerleading or anything after school?...maybe thats why he called you lazy.

I can just picture you going to the principals office saying so and so called me fat and the principal saying so?...you are.  Administrators have plenty of other things to worry about.  Instead of complaining why not do something for yourself like eating healthy and excercising.  It`s ppl like you that didge ball and gym classes were removed from schools.    Nora-  You think the teacher should be fired for saying something like that?  So you want to contribute to the unemployment and lack of educators?  It`s hard enough finding enough certified teachers.  So if she really is overweight (as she admits) then its not like the teacher is lying, the teacher asked if it was genetic....who knows maybe it has to do with her thyroid or some other medical condition.  Grow Up|`|kZW8xXoKaa	I think the best way to settle this would be to get your parents involved. Tell them the situation then go with them to your school counselor,,.Your school counselor should do what's in Your best interest. If this doesn't help I'd see the Principle.   With or without  parents you should see someone! But having your parents there will show how important these comments are and that the matter is serious.
07e72e078672820ea8f713e14ea295bcaa	Apraxia of speech is a motor speech disorder that prevents kids from consistently moving their face, tongue, lips and jaw into the correct position to make speech sounds or produce syllables or words. Due to this, the child may grope with his/her mouth trying to figure out how to make the correct sounds come out. They are groping for correct placement of the tongue, lips and jaw during speech.     I suppose this could also result in a child putting their whole hand in their mouth as well since they do grope for tongue placement.  My daughter, who has Apraxia, started putting her whole hand in her mouth (or rather trying to), but I believe she was modeling the behavior from a classmate who has down syndrome, who would put his whole hand in his mouth on a regular basis.  He had stretchier skin though, so he could achieve this much easier.  Previously, all facial/mouth  groping by her had been on the outside of her mouth.      Hands in mouth, can also be one of the many symptoms of Rett Syndrome as seen on this website:    http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/...    "Loss of purposeful hand movements; for example, the grasp used to pick up small objects is replaced by repetitive hand motions like hand wringing or constant placement of hands in mouth "    Though, I think that more likely, your child is just trying to get some sensation in their mouth.    Good luck!  Read through the links I have listed below under sources:

What your tolerance for analytical thinking? There are a lot of factors to take into account. But out those three majors, Accounting opens the most doors. On the difficulty level Accounting>Finance>Communication. I will tell you that accounting classes are really soul draining, but that's the reason they get paid a decent amount! The good thing about accounting is that the jobs are alway in demand. If you are really good at dealing with people, as in smooth talking then go for finance and become a financial adviser, they earn six figures easily, but your life will be up and down. In the end...it really depends on what you want out in life.

8YYwdccpaa	Once I worked in a group where people were genuinely happy for the achievements and honors that came to each other. Now I work in a group where people are simply jealous and self-absorbed.    In the first case, I worked harder because I wanted my colleagues to be as proud of me as I was of them. It was great for all of us.     In the second case, I try to avoid most of them and just focus on doing my own thing to the best of my ability. It's sad to be that way, but saves lots of heartache.     Sounds like she's aiming for the second kind of relationships. She is too insecure to have "competition" from you and so she put a lot of effort into finding a way to "prove" she was better. I am quite willing to bet that a lot of people in that room got the message. But did they get the one she intended or are they using their own eyes and minds to learn what was going on? I bet a lot of them felt badly for you and totally understood what she was trying to pull. She just made herself look unprofessional and unattractive.     Stay away from her when you can. Be polite but not out-reaching when you can't. The best revenge is doing your own work well, and it sounds like plenty of people know and respect you at this point.

Choose the European language you like best and do your utmost to learn to speak it. In the end the grammar isn't too important, but making yourself understood is.    If you aren't sure what other subjects to choose, then go for those you like best. Employers will want evidence of ability, so don't choose the "soft options" because they're easiest.

Then - given that    7p  +  6b   =   193     and                     p  +   b    =    28    To find the value of b, eliminate p thus ; multiply equation 2 by 7 gives                              7p  +  7b  =    196    Equation 1  and given              7p   +  6b  =    193.   Equation 2    Subtract equation 2 from equation 1 ;   7p - 7p = 0 ;           7b - 6b = b ;         196 - 193 = 3    Therefore 0  -  b  =  3.   so b = 3.    Now given that b + p = 28                  so   3 + p = 28        therefore       p   =  28 - 3  =  25.

Don't wish for that day, because it is your own death for which you would be wishing.    I don't agree with his perspective.  Perhaps we can not end all suffering, but we certainly can stop driving nails into our own feet.  Much of the pain individuals suffer is self-inflicted.  Learning to deal constructively with our problems may not take away all suffering, but it can certainly ease it some.    For example, his character in "The  Glass Menagerie" suffered from an illness she called "Blue Roses." Her larger suffering, though, came from her shyness and isolation.  She didn't know how to deal with the isolation, and ended the play being hurt badly.  I still had hope that she could go on to live a more open life, perhaps not ending her suffering, but clearly suffering less than she is in the play.|`|WPkk9HFUaa	When reading it, it seems as though the person is trying to say; don't expect your troubles to end suddenly.

Through her efforts, Manitoba became the first Canadian province to give women the right to vote and to run for public office in 1916.  The Government of Canada did likewise that same year.  She was late one of The Famous Five (with Irene Parlby, Henrietta Muir Edwards, Emily Murphy and Louise McKinney) who successfully circulated a petition, in 1927, to clarify that the term "Persons"  in Section 24 of the British North America Act of 1867 should include women and allow them to serve in political office.

0iX8HUVhaa	Understand what a verb is and present tense. If you want to say the infinitive "to have" you would say "avoir." Of course, you will need to learn to conjugate it. For example, "I have" is really "j'ai." You can start with the basic verbs avoir, tre, and learn the conjugations for the major verb endings: -er, -ir and -re.  Learn the other tenses. There is also pass composee (past tense), the future, the subjunctive etc.  Buy a good French/English dictionary. It is best to purchase a large, good quality one. A rule of thumb is that a good French/English dictionary places the French first. You can expect to spend a reasonable amount on this, but it is well worth it.  Read in French. Reading in French will increase your vocabulary and you will be surprised how quickly you will learn by absorbing the words through the context of the reading. As you go along, look up words in the dictionary.  Have conversations in French. You will be amazed at how much you will learn just by talking to someone who speaks the language.  Get into French immersion. This is a great way to learn French properly. In some places, such as Canada, after 3 years in the Immersion program, you will be considered fluent in the language. Whether you are or not, of course, is up to you!  Label your stuff in French. Type/write on one side of the paper the French word for that item and the pronounciation on the other side. Tape it to the item. Now when you use it, you can see what that item is called in French, and if you have a hard time pronouncing, you can just look on the other side.  Pay attention during lessons. It will help you later whether you go into French Immersion or not.  Learn popular French folk songs. You can find the words and music to these online. They will help you to get a feel for both the language and the culture. As for the French, the two are really one and the same thing.  Practice with someone. You can find a pen pal online or you can visit your local chapter of the Alliance Fran?aise. Or, you can probably find someone at your local university or community college who would love to practice with you.  Study every day. This is essential if you want to be successful.  Think in French. Say to yourself "Oh, I see an apple!" Now say it in French - "?. Je vois une pomme". Practice this whenever you get a chance - in the car, at bed, in the bathroom, everywhere.  If you're on the computer a lot, consider buying a learning program, such as Rosetta Stone or Berlitz. A good program has native speakers and pictures. If you wish to learn at little expense, google different free online podcast lessons and listen to them from time to time (every day if possible). But don't spend all your time on it. To learn French efficiently, you need to get out and converse in French.  Understand that learning a language is a full time commitment. If you muck around with it and only learn bits and pieces, you will likely regret this later in life when you actually want to converse in French.  Have a positive attitude. Sometimes, you may be discouraged by remembering why you wanted to speak French in the first place. The reality that 175 million people worldwide speak French is a good motivation. Also, think how few people are monolingual these days - two or more languages is more and more the norm.  Watch the "French in Action" program on your local public broadcasting station.  Subscribe to a French newsletter or magazine. You'll learn pretty fast this way if you continue to read French.  Go to France, Quebec, or somewhere that French is the most prominent language. This is considered the most practical and fastest way to learn the language by many leading experts.  Go to an online translator website and just type in random phrases that you can use daily. Then try to work these daily into your schedule. However, beware these translators as they are often wrong. Double check with your dictionary and your teacher.  Teach French. As you learn new words, say it to non-speaking friends and then say what it means. This, in turn, helps you pronounce and understand French and encourages your friends to learn with you.    Tips    Set aside a time to learn French everyday. 15-30 minutes is better than one big session once a week. You always learn more if you practice a bit every day rather than once a week for two hours.  Invest in a good Bescherelle. This is a book with every verb for quick and easy conjugation. French speakers swear by these.  Try out French crossword puzzles. You can find these online.  Print or buy a French calendar and replace your regular calendar. So whenever you look at the date, you'd quickly learn French numbers, days, and months. And when you write in events, look it up in your dictionary and write in French.  At the store, count how many fruits your putting in the cart in French.  Get your friends/family to learn French with you. It's way more fun than learning by yourself.

This is why change is essential--it allows you to reflect on a period of time when you were using a particular strategy for learning. If you have no point of comparison, it's impossible to assess one learning style. I personally prefer a self-directed learning style, in which I can take my time and learn at my own pace. Otherwise, deadlines and stress make me procrastinate on my work, since it becomes more of a chore and less pleasurable. Learning should be fun and stimulating, rather than forced and dull.

AA11722718	There is no sure shot magic trick to help you score more than 90%. If you have scored in the 80's or above 75% all through the tenth standard, then you stand a fairly good chance. Do not compromise on anything, eat healthy and get a good amount of sleep. And don't take the slightest of the tension no matter what your friends say, because ultimately, it is you who has to study hard and get into a good college. Learn your lessons well, concentrate on the textual questions first and become perfect in them and then go for the extra questions. This is because 75-80% of the paper is comprised of textual questions only. Also, avoid studying in groups, for this can be a source of distraction and disturbance. Cast away the cell phone at least during the board exams, and preferably study alone, in a silent place where you can concentrate better. Set a target for yourself, like completing a lesson by so-and so time without any disturbances or distractions, and then take a short break to refresh yourself. But don't switch on the TV during that break!! Go out for walks every evening and if you stick to your schedule religiously, you should be able to get a good percentage. Also, when your results are out, don't get depressed or disappointed if you haven't got a good percentage.......things like these happen sometimes but ultimately all students are on the same platform when the HSC exams arrive. So don't take tension, and do your best. All the Best!!!!!!

CT4deAlsaa	The further north you go, usually the higher cost of living is - but not always. I live in VA and right now, it is cold! (I'm below Richmond). If you go near Harrisonburg, Va, there is a resort called Massanutten. Alot of snow things going on there. The website is below.    Massachusettes has a nice high cost of living. I have plenty of family up there in Boston & Bridgewater.    New Jersey -  Ehh, I think the living cost is somewhere in between VA's & Mass.'s    I LOVE North Carolina! Go to the right place, you'll have lots of snow. There's a website called Ski North Carolina (see below). It can guide you to different ski resorts, snowmobiling tours, & sledding too! I'm not too sure on the cost of living, although I have over 3/4 of my family there. haha. I think its pretty affordable..    *Most the states you mentioned are Democratic areas! :o)  I'm a Dem, so i'll shhh!  haha)    Good Luck!|`|0aebc3da094dcd85852e8ef94004b113aa	Well let's see...I've lived in some of those states, so I might be able to help out. If you want snow, then count out Virginia. That's where I live now, and it's pretty warm here all the time. Massachusetts has really long winters and lots of snow, but it's kind of expensive to live there. Except maybe in the inner-city of Boston. Count Texas out, as well...it hardly ever snows. And NJ is expenive, I hear.    That leaves Colorado, and Washington. I'm sure it snows a lot in those places, but I'm not familiar with the cost of living.

8CL8o8K0aa	Yes.  Sometimes, may be because of over confidence you might just quickly glance at a questions without focusing on what is really being asked, hence what you think the question is asking for is not really so.

Back in Jamaica, I was in top percent of my class and I was sure (and my parents too) that I would go to High School (HS starts at 7th grade) from the 4th grade but alas, I did not pass even though I felt I did well.    I tried again in the 5th grade and it was the same result. In 6th grade, I had one last chance to take it again and if I failed, I'd have to go to a vocational school.    I took the test for the 3rd time and it felt harder than the previous two times and I believed without a doubt that I did poorly but later, my parents got a letter saying I passed and that half my tuition would be paid because I got a partial scholarship.    Naturally I was shocked and happy  and figured by being too confident before may have played a part in me failing.

You don't concentrate as much since you think it doesn't need thinking about.    Never undermine the tests difficulty. If you think about the questions carefully and not take them easily, your brain will work extra hard to correctly answer the question without any silly mistakes.
GcyKSQFhaa	You need to define love, pertaining to your point.  I know that is hard, but you chose the subject.  This also seems very "James Joyce". Stream-of-conscious works in literature, but not speech, so shape up the: points, crescendo, and finale.  Remember your audience, if this is for a grade, your instructor.  Put in some quotes, I recommend 1st John Chapter 4, or some quote from Shakespeare.
DIlNnjf8aa	Both.    Most people go directly to graduate programs.    But many work for several years before going on to graduate work. Robert Vaughn, the Man from U.N.C.L.E., got his Ph.D in English in his 40s. Grad schools generally give better consideration to older candidates because they know they're serious.    An important consideration, though, is whether you will have established yourself in such a way as to make graduate work impractical. Once you're married, have kids, have purchased a home and so on, it's not going to be so easy, especially when you have to live on a TA's salary.|`|c5UAa65qaa	A lot of people do, at least in academic fields, but if you've got good reasons for taking the time off (and you'll be keeping in touch with your recommenders), it won't make that much difference in terms of your acceptance.  New graduate students vary in age a lot more than undergraduates.|`|9e7e36b4831f960c521d29df4a85412baa	I really think taking time off is excellent.  I waiting for two years before going back for my masters and my education was more enriched due to work experience.|`|A0wT5sfmaa	It is cool that you think you can plan to take exactly 4 years off and then just go back. But it's not that easy...    A lot of things can change the dynamics of your plan.  Such as changes in your life (getting married, having a kid, becoming financially unstable or financially wealthy).    If you get out in the job market and are making good money it will be hard to leave that to go to back to graduate school.  In my experiences in graduate school the better students are the full-time ones and they are subsequently poor and could not support a family or are married to someone to supports them.    It is also important to think about your GRE scores (which some schools require to be taking within 6 years of applying, but this is different for each school and could be shorter) and your letters of recommendation.  Do you think you made a big enough impact on your professors that they will remember you and write a decent letter in 4 years?    Also think about the quality of a student.  For example I have not taken any math courses (i'm a liberal arts girl) since my undergraduate days.  So when I took my GRE after undergrad I scored highly on math and then took it again after grad. school and my verbal went up but my math went down a little because I never use it.  People forget how to do things and be good students and 4 years can have that sort of impact.    Just a few things to think about.  My main reason for going straight through was that I knew if I started getting a large pay check every month I would never go back to school.  So I stuck it out and couldn't be happier about my decision.    Good Luck.
BuSicwDqaa	Try and work out why you did badly, i.e. was it because you didn't ask for help in certain areas, were you having a rough time when you did the exams, try and think if anything was different at the time.    You may work out why you failed.    Also, when revising for the exams, make sure you find a style that suits you to revise. i.e. some people like making posters, comics, some (like me) make websites, some play games such as taboo and hangman. You get the idea.|`|5LR1RZelaa	The school itself puts a lot of pressure on us.  We have to have a B to pass the class.  C is not good enough.  If you get lower than a B twice....you aren't allowed back.

I don't think they will see me pass year nine this year.
AA11656721	Yes, I think you should of reported the matter to someone of authority in the school.  Perhaps don't tell anyone what you have for lunch, and guard your lunch.  If an emergency arises give your lunch to a close, trusted friend, or a teacher.  This is a sad thing that these kids did to you.  Show everyone you are still a strong individual no matter what pranks they do to you.  Don't let them win by doing something that draws a lot of attention to them, like losing your cool.  Messing with someones lunch is so childish and wrong.  Someday they will reap what they have sown.|`|drIeFsxNaa	Well, for one thing, don't be violent next time.

KyHiCSKeaa	THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH GETTING HELP FROM A TUTOR!  Quite honestly, it is smarter than not getting help just because it might hurt your image.  A tutor is really not that different from a teacher; a tutor is just a teacher who is there to help you find what clicks for you and how you can process everything you need to learn.  They are kind of like your personal support system!  Take advantage of that edge!  Good luck!|`|cdd147902e81bc55214600dbc4c6afbfaa	No, nothin wrong with that at all.

2z1h5mfOaa	There are a lot of people out there like you, me included, even if it is something I like, but I get impatient because of the time and effort it takes.    I describe myself as an albatross.  Look at how they take off: they start running, flapping their wings, fly for a second and land again, then start again.  It requires will power to finish something, but if you really really want it, this should give you the motivation to keep going, to keep trying, and eventually you may succeed beyond your dreams...  What I find useful is to first write down a list of priorities: 1 is the most important thing I want to do or achieve, 2 is the next important thing etc.  I add the pro's and contra's to each point, like what benefit would I gain or why it may not be such a good idea . The reasons why it may not be such a good idea may be valid, but some are based on fear or maybe they're not that important to me anyway.  Looking at the pro's and con's I can then make a decision on what really is my priority and motivate myself to continue, even if it may feel like plodding at times, and even if I take a few steps back at times - I can always take a few steps forward...  I am using this now for my new attempt at losing weight...|`|lgXSmCQRaa	I used to be like you. Ive had a guitar since I was 11 but I still cannot play anything. When I was in high school I would take days off all the time, I was late or Id go in late or leave earlier lol. I didnt care a lot but I actually liked learning, it took a teacher to say a few words to me and that gave me confidence in my ability.The next year it was a complete turn around, I was at school everyday, never missed classes, stayed the whole day. I was taking active responsility for my learning because my parents werent that bothered. So I think once you learn how determined you are and your ability, discipline comes naturally at that point.|`|ce9d90af4bd252d25ce81377df2eecc6aa	Concentration is key.. It depends if you enjoy it or not.. as regards to learning the guitar, will thats difficult and you need to stick at learning it for a while. Some things take longer than others to learn, thats got nothing to do with your abilities. Trust me we all struggle with learning and taking on new tasks.. but the more you use your brain the better it will become, it is a muscle after all :)|`|aXTMIoRaaa	try to do the task. and reward yourself at the end. for example you are trying to lse weight, why not try your best. and then when you think you have. treat yourself to a nice dessert!|`|37VHTdXYaa	don't get distracted and think how that's going to benefit you when you want to quit|`|2QFe7onpaa	Tell someone what you are trying to do. Have them ask you periodically how it's going. Being accountable to someone helps me if I'm not motivated or having trouble sticking with something.    Also, set small goals and a reward for yourself when you reach that goal. For instance, weight loss. Say you need to lose 40 lbs. Well don't set your goal that high. Say, ok I'm going to lose 5 lbs. When I do I'm going to treat myself to a manicure. Set a non-food related reward for each goal. Set one for 5, 10, 15, 20, etc until you reach that ultimate goal. Say, ok I'm going to learn 2 songs on the guitar. When you do, buy yourself a new songbook or a couple of nice guitar picks. It helps with motivation.
3eIuXzrAaa	Basically draw two arbitrary (random) rectangles e.g. one rectangle which has dimensions Width = 2 and Height = 4 and another with Width = 3 and Height = 5.    Then draw the golden rectangle which is such that the length is approximately 1,618 times the width of the rectangle. An example of such a rectangle would be a rectangle which has a width of 1 and a length of 1,618.    All you do is decide what width you want and then calculate the length to be 1,618 times the width. So if you want a golden rectangle with width 2 then the length has to be 3,236.    Basically in the task they ask you to find objects in you home like a book or a computer screen and they ask you to measure whether these rectangles are golden. You can check this by taking the longest side of the rectangle and dividing it by the shortest. If the number you get = 1.618 then you have found a golden rectangle (its like oh my GOD you found the golden rectangle ;) just kidding).    Anyways, that's all it is really!!! And the teachers want you to say that the rectangle looks pleasing to the ;)..    If you want extra bonus points, mention the number Fibonacci sequence. This number sequence is somehow related to this golden ratio (golden rectangle "1,618").    Here is the start of the sequence:    1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55 (next number in the sequence is given by the sum of the two previous terms e.g (3 = 2 + 1)  (8 = 5 + 3)...

They'll give you the opportunity to fail, and if you do, it's all because of you.  They also give you the opportunity to succeed.  Despite all the horror stories, I've never met one college professor who wouldn't give extra help to a student who was really trying, and there are all sorts of support systems in place for everything from academics to mental health.    Enjoy college.  This is the only time of your life when you'll be surrounded by people who are all intelligent, and all high-achievers.  The whole campus is set up to meet precisely the needs of people in your age group.  There are more academic and social opportunities in college than anywhere else.      Public school?

Those that inherit the blood of this clan have almost featureless white eyes, which are the focus for many of their dojutsu. Although it is not stated directly in the manga, it is presumed that all members of the Hyuga family possess the Byakugan. It is a common, but not proven belief that the Sharingan is a genetic offshoot of the Byakugan.    Hinata and Neji Hyuga are two main characters who use the Byakugan. A person with the Byakugan has a nearly 360 degree field of vision, except for a small blind spot at the back of the neck above the first thoracic vertebra.[10] Byakugan users can detect anything around them within a small radius, the greater the users skill with the Byakugan, the larger the radius is, which makes them close-range combat experts. The Byakugan also gives the user the ability to see through basically any matter over extremely long distances. A small degree of telescopic vision is also present, as a Byakugan user can focus on a single object at any point within their range of vision. The degree of focus seems to be dependent on the skill of the user. The Byakugan's insight capacity makes it useful for searching, tracking, and identifying targets.[6]    Protection of the Byakugan ability is very important to the Hyuga clan, and has led to the development of an elaborate family hierarchy. Members of the lesser branch house are branded with a cursed seal on their forehead at a young age. Whenever a branch house member dies, the cursed seal will seal the Byakugan ability so that enemies will not be able to discover its secrets.    IGN, a popular multimedia and reviews website, ranks Byakugan in the 3rd spot of the Top Ten Naruto Techniques mentioning the applications for this kind of technique in everyday use are infinite in number.    It's from the show Naruto|`|WVU3ACIIaa	Bakugan is a japanese anime show similar to pokemon or yugi-oh. The toys are all the rage right now and you can play a pretty kewl "marbles" like game with them. there are over 50 different types of bakugan and they each can come in over 6 different attributes ( colors ). In addition each one has the chance to have a different "g-Power" ( which is used in the game to determine a winner ). So you can have 2 of the same type and attribute but with different g-powers. There are also cards that are apart of the game. The two types are Gate cards and ability cards. The Gate cards have a thin piece of metal in them and you lay them down and roll the bakugan at them. if the bakugan lands on it it usually pops open into a figure ( due to a small magnet inside ). The ability cards are played during the game to alter the outcomes.

pD2MtL9Oaa	I think it really depends upon you and your husband.  Marriage is a big step in life and the shift in your lifestyle could have a negative impact upon your school work.  I had two friends who got married in college.  It worked out fine for one of them, but he was a really high achiever.  He ended up graduating with a double major after a total of 5 years of college.  My other friend was not really a great student and ended up leaving after his 4 years a couple of classes short of a degree.  He has made up the classes and gotten his degree since then.    Neither one had a terrible experience, but you need to be aware that you will have to put time into your marriage.  Just because you're married doesn't mean you'll suddenly have all of this free time that you would've devoted to dating.  Now you have a marriage to work on.

Helpful SAT study guides are below.|`|dHjya1Yoaa	Go ahead and keep studying... If you haven't already, get a study guide that has pratice exams in them... and emulate the test as if you are actually taking them... Here are some tips a professor gave me when I was going in retake the math portion of a standardized test that is required to take college credit courses in Texas...     1st, read through the test.. don't answer any questions unless you know them for sure. While you are reading through the test mark the questions that need you to think about them a little bit longer but you still know them... and then mark (with a different set of marks) all the questions that you don't know and you will have to use some major thinking on. When you are finished going through it the first time.. go and do all the questions that only need a little bit of thought and then when you are finished with those go back through a third time and do the ones that need a lot of thought... this also helps save time... and if I remember correctly getting an answer wrong is not penalized just not answering the question as they only count how many correct answers you have... But again that is if they haven't changed the scoring.     When you are done answering your questions go through your answer sheet and make sure you didn't mark a question wrong. But take your time....     As far as the essay is concerned, try to time yourself in writing the required essay... perhaps making a rough outline to keep you on track for your subject... when you have finished writing an essay or two in practice show them to an english teacher or someone you know is good at grammar to proof read it for you and tell you where your trouble spots are... and then keep practicing...     These tips worked for me.. So I hope they will work for you... especially if the SAT hasn't changed too much since I took it.|`|JnXmSLDfaa	Go to a   used book store   and try to find older as well as newer versions of the  SAT books - you can take the books with you when you are on the go and make use of that study time also, not just when sitting in front of a computer.

NBnuL73Eaa	In Greek mythology, Cerberus is the three-headed watchdog who guards the entrance to the lower world, the Hades. It is a child of the giant Typhon and Echidna, a monstrous creature herself, being half woman and half snake.    Originally, the dog was portrayed having fifty or hundred heads but was later pictured with only three heads (and sometimes with the tail of a serpent). Cerberus permitted new spirits to enter the realm of dead, but allowed none of them to leave. Only a few ever managed to sneak past the creature, among which Orpheus, who lulled it to sleep by playing his lyre, and Heracles, who brought it to the land of the living for a while (being the last of his Twelve Labors).    In Roman mythology, the Trojan prince Aeneas and Psyche were able to pacify it with honey cake.       Capture of Cerberus  The final labor that Eurystheus gave to Heracles, was what the weak and cowardly king thought was an impossible task; to capture and bring back alive Cerberus, the guard-dog to the entrance of the underworld. This monstrous dog is usually depicted with two, sometimes three or in some versions fifty heads, and its tail and mane were snakes. Cerberus was the offspring of Typhon and Echidna, his master was the god of the underworld, Hades.    Heracles, to prepare himself for this perilous task made his way to Eleusis, to be an initiate in the Eleusinian Mysteries. This he hoped would cleanse him from the deaths of the centaurs, of which he was responsible, also he might learn how to return from the kingdom of the dead.    From Eleusis Heracles traveled to Taenarum in the Peloponnese, and there found the entrance to the underworld. Heracles asked Athena and Hermes to help him, which they did, Hermes led the uncertain hero down into the dim light of the underworld. Close by the gates of Hades there were two living men chained to the rock, as the hero drew closer he recognized them, Pirithous, king of the Lapiths, and Theseus, the king and hero of Athens. They were being punished by Hades for their attempt to take Persephone back to the face of the earth. Heracles set Theseus free, tearing the chains from the rock, but as he attempted to free Pirithous, the rocks shook as if an earthquake had begun, but it was the wrath of Hades, Heracles moved away leaving Pirithous to his fate. Then the hero came face to face with the Lord of the Underworld. Heracles asked Hades if he could take Cerberus back with him to the land of the living. Hades gave his permission, as long as no weapon was used against the huge creature. (in some versions Heracles shot an arrow into the shoulder of Hades).    To capture the monstrous dog, Heracles gripped Cerberus by the throat and wrestled him with his bare hands, overpowering the ferocious beast, then swinging it across his shoulders carried his prize up to the land of the living and back to the court of the king. As Heracles cast the monster at the feet of Eurystheus. The terrified king trembling with fear, asked Heracles to take the monstrous beast back to the underworld, and if he did he would free the hero of his labors.|`|grKtTRYtaa	How much time have you spent looking for info?

NBBeIMT9aa	think about it... elevation. HIGHLAND! less oxygen concentration...|`|ulJumHilaa	i belive polar..........|`|xACwWEXHaa	The temperate continental climate is controlled more by elevation than by any other factor.    When you go to Colorado in the USA, an interior continental location, you are in what is normally seen as a temperate region, not too hot and not too cold.      If you start on the plains east of Denver, you might have a spring afternoon with a temperature of 78 degrees F.    As you go west into the foot hills, the temperature drops, and it may be only 75 degrees F.  As you go further west into the mountains, the temperature drops a bit more, and from I 70 in one of the little mountain towns, it might be clear and beautiful, but only 70 degrees.  For every 100 feet in elevation increase, you have a significant temperature drop.  When you get to the top of some of the mountains, you are in an area that is so cold year round that the snow never melts and trees do not grow.  (You can actually see from a distance the "tree line" above which the mountain is bare.)      When you drop back out of the mountains in the western part of the state, the temperature goes back up.    The moisture is also affected by the increase in elevation.  As warm wet air cools, it holds less moisture, and the excess falls as rain or even snow.  The land on either side of the mountain may be drier than the mountain top because it is in the "rain shadow" of the mountain,  affecting the climate not only through temperature but also through precipitation.

GEfUTyi8aa	yes, like the person above said.  Buy four different kinds from cheap to more expensive.   grab each end and pull, measure the distance at breakage.... for example you must cut all equal lengths on all pieces... like two feet.  then grab each end and have someone hold a measuring tape in front of you as you pull the wrap at each end and measure the distance at breakage... this will help you to compare the elasticity of each wrap.    Another experiment may be using the same bowl and same amount of water.... put the wrap on the bowl as you would to seal it with plastic wrap, and turn the bowl upside down.... if the water stays in record that.. if the wrap lets go then record that... you can even time it... like for each do ten seconds... then 20 .... etc.   This will tell you which wrap is stickier.    chances are the more expensive brand will be more elastic and stickier.... but maybe not, you have to check.

I would think, though, that you have more than proven your ability with your wonderful GPA.  As someone who used to teach GED classes, I always called GED "high school the hard way."  As opposed to what many people might think, taking the GED is not a walk in the park.  You truly have to PROVE your knowledge, not merely be passed through (as sometimes can happen).   So, congratulations on that and on your college GPA.    My advice to you would be to contact admissions counselors at the colleges in which you are interested and just ask straight up what they think.  Find the admissions offices on the Websites and then just email.  Please don't be hesitant.  You've really done well!  You've had a couple of MAJOR accomplishments.  Good luck!    P.S.  Congratulations to "Little Lulu."  The same words of praise apply to you!|`|AA10023710	Your associates trumps your GED. The 3.92 GPA you have now, and having actually completed the associates, is seriously in your favor. The fact that you have a GED rather than a standard high school diploma will not matter.

e9vUf1Zpaa	I got into Melbourne High and I had the exact same problem- how to worm a passing grade into those selective schools.    There are six components in total:  Numerical Reasoning  Verbal Reasoning  Reading Comprehension  Mathematics (I think)  Analytical Writing  Creative Writing    1: Numerical:  Not much of a problem, make sure you study up on Venn diagrams in worded form a lot.  2: Verbal:  Mainly English related questions.  3: Comprehension  A lot of reading questions, so make sure you read closely and study up on anecdotes and proverbs. Also look up on grammar.  4:Mathematics  See numerical.  5:Analytical:   You will need to put up a very good argument here, because the topics are a little bit hard to deepen in, so try to go fast and do as well as you can.  6: Creative  A very easy essay, all you have to know is the structure of short stories to pass this one.

Then:  1.5x + 2(x+3) is the total cost.  and  2.5(x + x +3) simplified to 2.5(2x +3) is the income from the sale, the difference between the two being the profit of $15.  Therefore, 2.5(2x+3) = 1.5x + 2(x+3) +15  5x + 7.5 = 1.5x + 2x + 6 + 15  5x - 2x - 1.5x = 15 + 6 - 7.5  1.5x = 13.5  3x = 27  x = 9.     NB. Dots are decimal points!|`|AA10152451	You should start by writing this all out.     1.50x  x is how many dozens he started out with     2.00(x+3)  This is the 3 dozen more than the first crate.     x+3+x is the 3 dozen extra plus the first crate  I hope this helps some.

Hveu9il7aa	Highest common factor (hcf) is the largest positive integer that divides both numbers without remainder.  Highest common factor of 120 and 600 is 120:  120=260  =2230   =22215 = 22235       = 222351  600=2300=22150=22275= 222325 =222355  So, highest common factor=22235=120    Lowest common multiple (lcm) of two integers a and b is the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of both a and b. Since it is a multiple, it can be divided by a and b without a remainder.  Lowest common multiple of 120 and 600 is 600:  So, lowest common multiple=2223551=600|`|VhTD7npRaa	hcf=120  Lcm=600    I think so.|`|a485249c3bac339c7f0182433bb64119aa	The HCF is 120, being the highest number that will divide into both.

c3DqvgE4aa	Nationalism refers to an ideology, a sentiment, a form of culture, or a social movement that focuses on the nation.[1] While there is significant debate over the historical origins of nations, nearly all specialists accept that nationalism, at least as an ideology and social movement, is a modern phenomenon originating in Europe.[2] Precisely where and when it emerged is difficult to determine, but its development is closely related to that of the modern state and the push for popular sovereignty that came to a head with the French Revolution in the late 18th century. Since that time, nationalism has become one of the most significant political and social forces in history, perhaps most notably as a cause of both the First and Second World Wars.    As an ideology, nationalism holds that 'the people' in the doctrine of popular sovereignty is the nation, and that as a result only nation-states founded on the principle of national self-determination are legitimate. Since most states are multinational, or at least home to more than one group claiming national status,[3] the pursuit of this principle has often led to conflict, and nationalism is commonly associated with war[4] (both external and domestic), secession, and even genocide in contexts ranging from imperial conquest to struggles for national liberation.    Nationalism does not always lead to violence, however, and it plays an integral role in the daily lives of most people around the world. Flags on buildings, the singing of national anthems in schools and at public events, and cheering for national sports teams are all examples of everyday, 'banal' nationalism that is often unselfconscious.[5] Moreover, some scholars argue that nationalism as a sentiment or form of culture, sometimes described as 'nationality' to avoid the ideology's tarnished reputation, is the social foundation of modern society. Industrialization, democratization, and support for economic redistribution have all been at least partly attributed to the shared social context and solidarity that nationalism provides.[6][7][8]    Nevertheless, nationalism remains a hotly contested subject on which there is little general consensus. The clearest example of opposition to nationalism is cosmopolitanism, with adherents as diverse as liberals, Marxists, and anarchists, but even nationalism's defenders often disagree on its virtues, and it is common for nationalists of one persuasion to disparage the aspirations of others for both principled and strategic reasons. Indeed, the only fact about nationalism that is not in dispute may be that few other social phenomena have had a more enduring impact on the modern world.    Theory    [edit] Background and problems    Specific examples of nationalism are extremely diverse since many types, forms, and origins exist. The theory of nationalism has always been complicated by this background, and by the intrusion of nationalist ideology into the theory. There are also national differences in the theory of nationalism, since people define nationalism on the basis of their local experience. Theory (and media coverage) may overemphasize conflicting nationalist movements, and war - diverting attention from many general theoretical issues; for instance, the characteristics of nation-states.    [edit] Issues    The first studies of nationalism were generally historical accounts of nationalist movements. At the end of the 19th century, Marxists and other socialists (such as Rosa Luxemburg) produced political analyses that were critical of the nationalist movements then active in central and eastern Europe (though a variety of other contemporary socialists and communists, from Lenin (a communist) to Jzef Pi?sudski (a socialist), were more sympathetic to national self-determination)[9]. Most sociological theories of nationalism date from after the Second World War. Some nationalism theory is about issues which concern nationalists themselves, such as who belongs to the nation and who does not, as well as the precise meaning of 'belonging'.    [edit] Origins    Recent general theory has looked at underlying issues, and above all the question of which came first, nations or nationalism. Nationalist activists see themselves as representing a pre-existing nation, and the primordialist theory of nationalism agrees. It sees nations, or at least ethnic groups, as a social reality dating back twenty thousand years. This causes a lot of distress amongst the people of the specified country.    The modernist theories imply that until around 1800, almost no-one had more than local loyalties. National identity and unity were originally imposed from above, by European states, because they were necessary to modernize economy and society. In this theory, nationalist conflicts are an unintended side-effect. For example, Ernest Gellner argued that nations are a by-product of industrialization. Modernization theorists see such things as the printing press and capitalism as neces|`|dDDAbqqhaa	How rudely can you ask a question haha    it's your homework, so do it yourself|`|3FKMMoXkaa	Do it yourself!

The Pell grant and even federal loan amounts you will receive would be the same if you went to a college costing 3,000 a year or a school costing 32,000 a year.  (Which is why community colleges are so popular.  You get the extra grant money after your tuition is paid.  Expensive schools hand you a bill instead of a refund check).    If you are going to go to a school that expensive, you will need to 1. get really great scholarships from the school or 2. have very supportive parents willing to take out PLUS parent loans that they pay back.

kubIYab1aa	A good thesis statement will usually include the following four attributes:    take on a subject upon which reasonable people could disagree   deal with a subject that can be adequately treated given the nature of the assignment   express one main idea   assert your conclusions about a subject   Lets see how to generate a thesis statement for a social policy paper.    Brainstorm the topic.  Lets say that your class focuses upon the problems posed by changes in the dietary habits of Americans. You find that you are interested in the amount of sugar Americans consume.     You start out with a thesis statement like this:    Sugar consumption.    This fragment isnt a thesis statement. Instead, it simply indicates a general subject. Furthermore, your reader doesnt know what you want to say about sugar consumption.    Narrow the topic.  Your readings about the topic, however, have led you to the conclusion that elementary school children are consuming far more sugar than is healthy.    You change your thesis to look like this:    Reducing sugar consumption by elementary school children.    This fragment not only announces your subject, but it focuses on one segment of the population: elementary school children. Furthermore, it raises a subject upon which reasonable people could disagree, because while most people might agree that children consume more sugar than they used to, not everyone would agree on what should be done or who should do it. You should note that this fragment is not a thesis statement because your reader doesnt know your conclusions on the topic.    Take a position on the topic.  After reflecting on the topic a little while longer, you decide that what you really want to say about this topic is that something should be done to reduce the amount of sugar these children consume.    You revise your thesis statement to look like this:    More attention should be paid to the food and beverage choices available to elementary school children.    This statement asserts your position, but the terms more attention and food and beverage choices are vague.    Use specific language.  You decide to explain what you mean about food and beverage choices, so you write:    Experts estimate that half of elementary school children consume nine times the recommended daily allowance of sugar.    This statement is specific, but it isnt a thesis. It merely reports a statistic instead of making an assertion.    Make an assertion based on clearly stated support.  You finally revise your thesis statement one more time to look like this:    Because half of all American elementary school children consume nine times the recommended daily allowance of sugar, schools should be required to replace the beverages in soda machines with healthy alternatives.    Notice how the thesis answers the question, What should be done to reduce sugar consumption by children, and who should do it? When you started thinking about the paper, you may not have had a specific question in mind, but as you became more involved in the topic, your ideas became more specific. Your thesis changed to reflect your new insights.

If you are not 18, then a copy of your transcript or a certificate of completion of degree requirements or some similar evidence that you have completed your high school would suffice or permission to take classes at the JC during the day from your high school counselor/principal. Here in Berkeley there are advanced  Berkeley High students who take Berkeley City College(JC) and even UC Berkeley  classes  in 10th and 11th grades during the regular year and during the school day, so I don't see  that there should be  any problem.  If you are speaking of a 4 year college or university,  it will depend on whether you applied and are admitted for the spring semester or can take  classes through some other means without having to have applied and been admitted as a student and regularly enrolled. I believe the Berkeley High students take courses at UC Berkeley through  concurrent enrollment in university extension. (The High School is only two blocks from the University.)

Some universities will accept you if you really get excellent grades on the sats (I mean like be top 2 percent), but others look at the two.  Don't worry, just have good grades during your senior year, and maybe look for an in-state university as they are a little easier to get in than out of state universities.|`|DlMsJPwUaa	if you have D's and F's they wont take you|`|Z3LL3csEaa	Depends on which university, but you're sure as hell going to have a lot of explaining to do when you apply.|`|xHvuJZaSaa	Hi there :)   Ok. First of all let me tell you bravo! From how you were able to raise your GPA like that, getting into a good university is not such a challenge as you might think. You can actually use this situation to convince them you are a wonderful candidate. If you can show them you are devoted to keep that up, then you are good to go. Another thing is to think about things that makes you special. Anything from what you do as a hobby to special skills you have. (Dont mind if some of these are silly, just make sure you show your good side :) Write all of these down and save it.  Second, I would like to give you some tasks to help you move along.   1. Find out your cumulative GPA.  (If it is at list a 2.5 or so then you might have a chance to get in some colleges or university if you can show them you are still a good candidate some other ways also. Note that not all colleges or universities ask for SATs. Therefore you need to start searching early and find out what they ask for.)  2. Set goals for yourself and write down those goals and why you have those goals. For example: I want to go to college because... (Make short essays and try to be familiar with them. You will need those for  interviews and such.)  2. Write an essay about how your GPA went from 1.8 to a 3.6 and what you have learned from this experience and how you can use it to become successful in anything you devote your heart to. (You will need this essay even after you get into a university)  3. Get someone like your English teacher to help you edit that essay.  2. You need to be good friend with your guidance counselor and or some teachers that can give you good recommendations.  2. Go to www.collegeboard.com   3. After you register on www.collegeboard.com. Check out some potential colleges you might want to go to and their expectations of you before you apply.  4. Study for you SATS and pray you do well  5. See your Guidance counselor regularly to help you with the application process.  6. I'm here if you still have questions :)  One other thing I need to tell you about is that some universities have programs for students that they think might be good potential students but still not sure of. How these programs works is that after the selection process, you take some summer classes designed specifically for that. Then if you pass those classes you will be officially enrolled. Just ask the admission person or visit their website if in any circumstance you ever need that.    These are some state Universities that you might be able to get in if you follow my list: Central State University Ohio, Southern Connecticut State University     Good luck:)

e6cd7adee445aea5f559762dc3723ff4aa	Trust me, every school has someone or some group meant for each other to be friends, or at least good classmates.  Give it some time, try not to "look" like a loner (don't be sad or depressed).  Just be yourself and be calm and interested in what is going on around you, without butting into others' lives.  Eventually, you will meet those people who like the same things as you and everything should be fine.|`|v9XGBDdRaa	Hey dont worry everything will be fine soon.....

Get involved in extra-curricular activities and it might not hurt to start going to an area church and get involved in youth group.  High school was tough and actually painful at times with me being so shy but I managed to deal with it.  If I'd have known better then, I would have gone to the Dr. for some anxiety pills...they do wonders for me now...hope you'll adjust!!!|`|e9vUf1Zpaa	There is a big issue on changing to a school to where no one is readily to be friends to a newcomer.

One short term goal maybe to pass all your exams at the end of the term and improve on your results as the year progresses.  A medium term goal maybe to get into a good university and study in your chosen field, resulting in employment as a ___________. (you fill the blank).  A long term goal may be to have a happy family with your own spouse and children.    You could have an absolute goal too. This could be to live in Heaven for eternity.    Hope this helps.

xJoMSkI5aa	The 1890's were transitional for the U.S.    The United States economy needed foreign markets to sustain itself, the federal government was under pressure to secure its power and prestige in the world community, and Americans yearned to be reassured of their national prowess. As Theodore Roosevelt told a friend in 1897, "I should welcome almost any war, for I think this country needs one." (cited)    Woodrow Wilson tried to keep America out of the war. After WWI, the U.S. was a global power which was involved in the world.    from Shmoop
WvqRJow1aa	1. a(a-3) + 5 = (a-1)^2     a^2 - 3a + 5 = a^2 - 2a + 1 (Using the rule: (a-b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2)     Cancelling off a^2 on both sides:     -3a + 5 = - 2a +1     3a - 2a = 5 - 1     a = 4    2. (7/2)x + 5 = x + (15/2)      7/2 x - x = 15/2 - 5      Multiplying both sides of the equation by 2:      7x - 2x  = 15 - 10      5x = 5        x = 1|`|AA10152451	How to solve them? Yes. I'm not going to solve them for you though.    Multiple a times (a-3). That equals (a^2)- 3a.   So the left side is (a^2)-3a + 5    Solve the right side.  (a-1) times (a-1)  a^2 - 1a - 1a +1  So that's a^2 -2a +1    (a^2)-3a + 5 = a^2 -2a +1  And then get all the a's on one side and everything else on the other and then solve it. That's the first problem. By the way a^2 means a squared.   ---  You have to get the x out of the denominator on the left side, for the second equation, so you would subtract 5 from both sides, and then you are left with 7/2x on the left side. Multiple both sides by 2x.     7/2x +5 = x +15/2  7/2x+5-5= x +15/2 -5  7/2x = x + 15/2 - 5  7 = (x +15/2 - 5)2x  And then keep going from there. I hope this helps!|`|k3l9pJTjaa	for the first one, expand by removing the brackets and find the equation for a .  Second one, take LCM and cross multiply.
ToIsKLKYaa	WOW some of these people make me sad.    Sometimes I cry myself to sleep.    CRY is the verb....  SLEEP is the NOUN.

As a noun, what you are actually saying is 'I cry myself into the state of sleep';  as a verb you are saying 'I cry until I sleep'.  The second does not say that you sleep as a result of crying though, so that means that technically the noun is the better answer.|`|2vTzz2llaa	NOUN you have to look at it in context of the sentence. He or she is speaking of sleep as if it is a destination. It is not being said that he or she is sleeping, merely that that is the place were he or she is going. It is like when someone goes to a happy place. It is definitely a noun.

About the only time we use a laundromat is when we are traveling.  At home we have our own washer and dryer.  Since the laundromat is used for multiple loads we usually spend an hour or two when we go.    In the daytime laundromats are typically filled with bored little children.  At night you are more likely to encounter singles on the prowl for companionship.  Most laundromat patrons are nice people and it's not hard to start a conversation with them.    To me the most interesting aspect of the laundromat would be the people using it--the express service, however, sounds like a good lead paragraph for your  story.
2lQ8DJAcaa	Own lab rat   As a sign of the high regard in which she was held, Marie sat in the front row of the Faraday lecture theatre, alongside the most senior scientist present at that occasion, the former President of the Royal Society and towering figure in the investigation of electricity, Lord Kelvin.      The lecture theatre had to be decontaminated, because of the dangerous level of radiation     Hear Radio 4's A Point of View     In a partially darkened room, Pierre showed how radium emitted a ghostly light. He placed a piece of radium on a photographic plate which had been wrapped in thick layers of newspaper. Removing the paper, Pierre Curie revealed how the clear image of the radium had been transmitted through its wrappings, on to the plate.     Finally, rolling up his sleeve, he showed a livid red area of damaged skin, where he had bound a sample of radium wrapped in a thin layer of rubber to his arm for 10 hours. Marie, he explained, had suggested that this property of burning the skin might make radium a useful treatment for cancer.     As he moved his precious radium samples around, Pierre Curie's fingers fumbled badly. So incapacitated was he by his badly scarred hands and a general feeling of fatigue and debilitation, that he had not been able to tie his dress tie before the lecture. Neither he nor his wife was aware of the lasting damage being caused to their health by repeated handling of radioactive substances. Neither took any precautions when working at close quarters with radium.     So in this case, one of the lasting memories I began with was a real one: years after Pierre's Royal Institution performance, it was found that the effects of his mishandling of his material still lingered on the premises - the lecture theatre had to be decontaminated, because of the dangerous level of radiation.

You should say  Why you want to be a midwife  Why you did your college course  What skills you have gained such as essay writing, analytical thinking, research skills.  Explain how you have learned the value of reflection  Learned how to balance time  Have you done any paid or voluntary work in this field?                    Finish off with the fact that you are reliable and punctual, enthusiastic and how you would love the opportunity to promote natural birth and autonomy for the mother.    The course is very hard work. If it is what you really want to do then it is worth the 'hassle'. Let me know how u get on    Can you not ask at college for help? If you are really struggling you could always email the uni or join a student website such as the 'studentmidwife' one. That gives you the opprtunity to speak to other students|`|x30SGTCtaa	Hi.  Have a look in your college or local library for any books on getting into health courses - they may help you fill your statement in.  I found this one: 'Getting into Nursing and Midwifery' by Janet Higgins published 2000. ISBN0856605476    Also perhaps try your college tutors or careers service, they should be able to guide you on what admission tutors look for.    I'm no expert but: You should get across in your statement WHY you want to be a Midwife, and ANY EXPERIENCE you have of it already - no matter how big or small, all experience is experience, also include anything that you're going to do for expereince if not already done like shadowing a midwife (don't know if they do this?)  Try to get across your enthusiasm and your commitment to the course - you can emphasise this as obviously you're committed seen as you've returned to studies to get the entry qualifications.    Don't worry, there's many in the same boat as you, just get YOU and YOUR experience across simply in the statement and you'll be fine.    Hope it goes well for you.

SLSX6QQsaa	Please save yourself the money and stress, and go to a community college for 2 years, get your Associates degree or fulfill the MACRAO agreement (which basically lets you complete 2 university years without getting a whole Associates degree, but the university has a specific agreement with the community college that varies from school to school).  Then after your first 2 years, go to a university.  I had to wait until age 24 to go to college because until age 24 you have to go based on your parents income even if you live alone, and my parents made too much money.  Community college is cheap enough that I managed to take 1-2 classes a semester by paying out of pocket.  Oh, and its easy to get into a better college once you successfully complete 2 years at community college, even if you were not a straight A high school student.

Try 'are not' and 'will not' and 'cannot'|`|AA12361379	" I taught composition in high school for years and recognize this problem!    Are not" is not any better than "were not."     As you have discovered, looking in the dictionary or a thesaurus will not help you.  It depends on what you are writing about and what you are trying to say as to what verb you might use.  For example:  "George is a first-year teacher " could be changed to "George is struggling as a first year teacher" or "George loves his first year of teaching."  See?  It all depends on what you mean.  "Is struggling" does not count as one of the words to avoid.  "Is"  combined with an action verb is not the same as "is" or "were" standing alone.    Rule:  avoid all "to be" verbs used by themselves.  "To be" verbs include "is, are, was, were, am, being, been."  I may be leaving one out.      I hope this helps.|`|a485249c3bac339c7f0182433bb64119aa	There really aren't any direct replacements that I can think of, but you could change your wording a little further - for example instead of saying 'they were not amused' say 'they did not find it funny'   or  'they were not interested in his offer' could change to 'they treated his offer with disdain' or 'they refused to consider his offer.

ktOqm7cgaa	What we now call "B lack History Month" was originated in 1926 by Dr. Carter Godwin Woodson.  In 1926, it was called  "N egro History Week."     Carter Woodson attended college where he earned a B.A. degree in European history and a Ph.D. in history. As a new graduate, he managed to earn a living as a high school teacher; and later as a professor of history at Howard University. He had a strong desire to document N egro history.  He co-founded and financed the "Association for the Study of N egro Life and History" in 1915.     In 1926, Dr. Woodson was able to offer the Association's name to sponsor the week. He chose the second week in February because it marked the birthdays of Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass. Through Woodsons promotion of the celebration in the "Journal of N egro History" and the creation and distribution of kits for children, "N egro History Week" gained in popularity.     In 1976, "N egro History Week" expanded into "B lack History Month." The month is also sometimes referred to as African-American Heritage Month.  It is recognized officially in several nations including Canada and the UK, and unofficially in others.      In the U.S., it is recognized officially.  In 1975, President Ford issued a Message on the Observance of "B lack History Week" urging all Americans to "recognize the important contribution made to our nation's life and culture by B lack citizens."     In 1976, President Ford issued the first Message on the "Observance of B lack History Month."  In subsequent years, Presidents Ford, Carter and Reagan continued to issue Messages honoring "African-American History Month."     In 1986, Congress passed Public Law 99-244 which designated February 1986 as "National B lack (Afro-American) History Month. This law noted that February 1, 1986 would mark the beginning of the sixtieth annual public and private salute to Black History. The law further called upon to President to issue a proclamation calling on the people of the United States to observe February 1986 as "B lack History Month" with the appropriate ceremonies and activities. President Reagan issued Presidential Proclamation 5443 which proclaimed that the foremost purpose of "B lack History Month" is to make all Americans aware of this struggle for freedom and equal opportunity. This proclamation stated further that this month was a time to celebrate the many achievements of African Americans in every field from science and the arts to politics and religion."    In January 1996, President Clinton issued Presidential Proclamation 6863 for National African-American History Month." The proclamation emphasized the theme for that year, the achievements of black women from Sojourner Truth to Mary McLeod Bethune and Toni Morrison. In February 1996, the Senate passed Senate Resolution 229 commemorating "B lack History Month."    Since 1996, the Presidents have issued annual proclamations for "National African-American History Month."      To honor Dr. Woodson, the national theme for 2008 was Carter G. Woodson and the Origins of Multiculturalism.

Next go to college.. a community college is a better start then a full University.. you can get your basic classes out of the way and sometimes they offer a 'pre-law' study program.    After you grad. from the CC you should have begun to form an idea of exactly what area or areas of law you might like to be in.  (I can not think of ANY Lawyer that tries to take on all forms of legal representation (corporate, criminal, civil, financial, etc..)  find your strengths (and your weakneses and focus on what you need to improve.    Graduate from College and then (or before that shift over to) enrole in a Law program (which can be like getting a masters)..   Here you will learn about law and the concept of legal issues.    Once you graduate (or even before sometimes) you can atake your bar exam.  Its a tough test but it is the 'ticket'.  Learn about the Bar Exam .. it is the final step and knowing when you can take it is important.. because, College notwithstanding.. you get your card and you are a lawyer.    In between these, you need to try to get jobs in legal offices.  Sometimes you will learn more there then at some of the school classes.    From HS its about a 6 to 8 year road.. enjoy the travel but remember to stop and smell the roses from time to time.    good luck    .|`|oJMjEP2Jaa	You can find top listing of such US college courses in this site - careers.scienceontheweb.net

Often it a good idea to use things that one would hav seen before.    This is why TV and Radio ads (ie. Mitsubishi) like to use songs we are familar with.     Here is a event I made up called "Central Park Kiss"    It was six, maybe seven hours ago   That I was watching kids playing in the snow.   They looked so happy and had much fun   As they laughed, screamed jumped and run.     I wanted to join but I was too old   And besides that would have been bold.   So I remained seated and tapped my feet   While my iPod played a funky beat.     A few minutes later a lady arrived   With a little boy by her side   She stooped and gave him a hug   Then he scurried off like a little bug.     I slid down the bench to make some space   And as she came closer, I could make out her face.   She was so pretty and elegant that I started to smile   And quite possible could have been seen for miles.     "Good morning" she said as she proceeded to sit   I responded "Hi! A lovely day isn't it?"   She told me her name and I think its French   And thanked my lucky stars that I choose this bench.     A bus came to pick up the kids   And that exactly what it did.   It was just us two and the birds in the tree   Chirping away happily.     "Well" she said "I have to go"   "I'm getting cold and can't feel my toes"   She got her purse and prepared to go   And fell after two steps into the snow.     "Are you okay" as I rushed to her side   And stepped on my lace and landed on my hide.   We sat up and stared at each other and laughed it up   As the wind blew around a Dixie Cup     "I didn't know you'd fall for me so quick" I said   And she proceeded to throw a snowball at my head.   I thought she throw like a girl   But it connected and knocked me out of this world.     I pushed her over back in the snow   And it totally boost my ego.   I said to her "I'm King of the snow"   "And I'm not letting you up until you say so"     I gazed in her eyes and she into mine   And I felt like a schoolboy in the summer time.   I slowly drew closer to reach for a kiss   And she closed her eyes and pouted her lips.     The time was cold but her lips were warm   And I felt so awesome she's falling for my charm.   "Hey get a room" I heard a few feet away   And she opened her eyes and turned that way.     She put her hands around me and said "Let's give 'em a show"   And we stayed kissing and cuddling up in the snow.|`|b6461d8a8d3d34ce5dac5c4052085372aa	Exciting?

NyyRuaVqaa	Lolita is based off of Victorian children's clothing and the ideals of the Rococo movement. It's about embracing your inner-child, trying to be cute instead of sexy, trying to stand out and be different in a world that is trying to make you conform, (Japan is extremely conformist, much more so than the US or UK. That all of the over-the-top fashions you might see in Harajuku are popular or mainstream in Japan is a myth. People who dress this way are practically shunned from society.) and being a princess. Doesn't every girl want to be a princess?    No one really knows how lolita started, but we know that much.    Hime Gyaru (another Japanese alternative fashion similar to Lolita) was started in very much the same way, only they share the ideals of Gyaru (another Japanese alternative fashion) in that their clothing absolutely must be brand name and ridiculously expensive.    Gyaru fashion was born out of Japan's obsession with brand-name things and the need to be different. (Why did they stick those two together? I don't know.) Gyaru have tanned skin and bleached hair, the opposite of what is considered ideal in Japan.    I really don't know much about other alternative fashions.|`|31BzOE7Laa	Homework
Dh0JX2Onaa	Prepare for the tests one at a time. Begin with the subject in which you have the most difficulty or you may never get to it.    Here are some study suggestions.    1. Have all of your materials ready and in the place that you are going to study.    3. Study when its quiet. No music, no TV, No headphones, no nothing.    4. Do your most difficult subject fist or else you may never get to it.    5. Keep a calendar so that you know when a project is due or a test is going to be given.    6. Vocabulary is very important. Words have different meanings. You need to know the meaning for the subject that you are taking.    7. Study the relationship of things. How is the topic that you studied related to the unit that you are studying?    8. Your textbook has hints for you. Many books have important words or phrases in darkened or colored type, make sure that you know them thoroughly.    The sites below are excellent and will give you many other ideas about studying.    http://www.d.umn.edu/kmc/student/loon/ac...    http://www.studygs.net/    http://www.ucc.vt.edu/stdysk/checklis.ht...    http://www.ucc.vt.edu/stdysk/stdyhlp.htm...    http://www.dartmouth.edu/~acskills/succe...    http://www.dartmouth.edu/~acskills/succe...    http://www.dartmouth.edu/~acskills/succe...    http://www.dartmouth.edu/~acskills/succe...|`|AA10792562	Ten different subjects?

0rF1be2baa	well maths is pretty easy at AS but gets quite a bit harder at A level and if you don't enjoy it it will be even worse. i guess maths would help for getting a place in medicine but when i did my a level i did three things that were relevent to what i wanted to do and 1 fun subject which i was interested in. . it'll be the chemistry biology and psychology that will get you into a place for medicine at uni. so i would probably go for photography at AS level and then drop it at A level|`|hvghGmzAaa	if your for more education i would go with maths.  if you wanna have fun an learn the arts of photography i would do Photography.
fhPGThwfaa	Its better to try for a job after Bachelor's... as u say the current recession is very bad..

f7jICJo2aa	Sit down with someone and engage in a question and answer session, write this down and then remove the questions and expand the answers and voila there's your speech ..|`|TWiOp0xLaa	You say the first one is about personal experiance?  And only a minute long, you could just pick a few of your experiances, and say what you leant about yourself from them. How you became what you are today etc.    And 2nd, only you can pick the topic for that, noone here knows what YOUR passionate about,     Pick something that you have great interest in,     Could be anything from sports to animals, to drawing, or hey even a stamp collection... although i doubt talking about stamps will be too interesting...    But anyways good luck :D.
AAgX0SDcaa	a belief in luck, magical thinking. Some superstitions may have a basis in psychology.

Sozc3MyFaa	This is a real problem with many of these so-called training programs that they forget to tell you--not providing clinicals.  All you can do is start calling everywhere you can--get out the the phone book.  Start with clinical labs/outpatient labs as that is where phlebotomists work and do high volume blood draws (do NOT call them pokes--very unprofessional). You could also try if there are teaching hospitals in your area.  Try asking at your program where others have gone in the past as well.Good luck

K1tur1boaa	At the time the jet left Los Angeles the two planes were only 1600km apart from one another (2100km - 1h*500km/h).   The gap is now closing at 1200km/h (500+700), so they should meet in 1600/1200 hours which is 4/3 = 1.3333333333hrs or 1 hour and and 20 minutes after.   what do we have?   12pm + 1hr + 1hr 20 min = 2:20 pm
