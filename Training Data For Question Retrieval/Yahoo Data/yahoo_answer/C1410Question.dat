20081001092650AARwg1m	Social Science;Psychology	How can I tell if I have anxiety.....?	and how can i tell what kind of anxiety i have.      Well I know I have anxiety im just not sure of the severity.  It has been a problem since I was in kindergarten at least, I am 19 now and I still feel as though..... well i really dont know how to describe it, its not necessarily fear but its not a feeling of comfort. Or maybe it is fear but i am so used to it it doesnt scare me anymore or something.  When I am alone I am paranoid, when I am around people I feel like they are all watching me and judging me all the time.  It isnt just friends or people i just met sometimes I feel this way around family or family friend that i have known forever.   There is a lot more to it.   I get so anxious I get sick.   I have anxiety attacks.   Sometimes when my brothers or others try to talk to me about simple things I get all worked up and start crying, I dont know what to do and I can help it (this is not a daily thing but it happens a lot)      What can I do to stop these feelings?

20081015131752AAMXVBs	Social Science;Sociology	Afraid of so many things?	i'm afraid of many many things, most of these things are adult type of things, and they're really little.      first of all, i'm 16, and the main thing i'm going to talk about is my fear of seeing a sexy scene in a movie with my girlfriend. normally if i were watching a movie and a scene like that came up, i'd either look away or skip it if i could, and the last resort would be closing my eyes. why am i like that? because i want to be 110% dedicated to my girlfriend. i'm not afraid of sex, just the topic when it's between her and i. i don't know why i'm like this at all, but i know it is a bit of an extreme fear because i feel sick if her and i talk about seeing a movie that i know has sexy scenes in it.  it's not just that i'm afraid of her thinking i pay attention to the sexy scenes, i'm also afraid of her seeing one, for the same reason that i think she would not want me to see one.  for example, i wouldn't want to see 300, and i wouldn't want her to see 300, and i definitely wouldn't want us to see it together because of the sexy parts in it.  i know very well that 99% of the world isn't like me in this way, but i need some help , i don't know how to be helped.      thank you for everything you do

20090309212934AAPJmiE	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Why do guys always make it an issue on obese girls, but girls don't do so about obese guys?	i just don't get it why a woman's value is always determined by her beauty and body before herself, unlike men, where women would always look into their personalities first. this also explains why many fat guys can still get hot chicks.       could this happen coz guys are more shallow?      note : not all guys, but many (most, actually) of them
20090309220448AAQ23Sq	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Is it a myth or is it true?	There are a lot of questions tonight where someone says "Guys can be obese/ugly and still get hot chicks," but is that really true?      I think some people aren't very good judges of men's attractiveness (particularly other guys), but I can't think of one couple I know in real life where the guy is a 3 and the woman is a 9.  I'm in my 20s so people haven't really gone down hill yet and the women I know tend to have their act together with decent paying jobs (and no reason to date for money) so maybe the people I know aren't typical.      Do you know a lot of couples where the guy far less attractive than the woman or is this just a male fantasy?

20081120145956AABZK9d	Social Science;Psychology	What's wrong when my moms says she "sees things"?	Lately, my mom has been acting strange.         Anytime we go out somewhere she gets really upset because she says that people are treating her bad and that they’re purposely short changing her.   We went to the library and the librarian said that we owed money, but we didn’t because we had dropped them off on time. But then my mom started saying that she recognizes that librarian and that she’s purposely trying to rip her off. After that when we got in the car, she started crying and saying how ever since we moved to this state, she’s been treated badly.      But it’s not only that. Sometimes my mom will talk about these “black cars” that she claims to see so often. She says that she sees them around town when she’s doing errands, and when I went to do some volunteer work, she said that there was a black car there too.   She thinks that they’re cops watching her, and that they tried to break into her glove compartment to find papers that would incriminate her in some way. Or something like that.   I think she also thinks that they have microphones in our car or house somewhere, but she doesn’t talk about it often.      Sometimes she gets upset when she thinks that my sisters and I are not listening to her. She got mad at me one day because I wasn’t in a good mood, and she was talking about my dad again. My parents are divorced, and my mom hates my dad. But I get tired of always hearing so many complains about my dad, that I was naturally acting annoyed because I was.   We got in a fight about it, and she told me that I have no respect for her because I never listen to what she says.      Often she says that she doesn’t like me very much and I’m a b*tch. She says that I don’t try hard enough in school and that I won’t make it in college.   It’s been seriously upsetting me especially because her attacks have become more personal.                  Whenever I see her get so upset, I get upset myself. I listen to her talk, and it makes me feel sick because I think she may be mentally ill right now.   I've been having a hard time concentrating on my work sometimes because this stuff is always on my mind.      But I guess that my first concern would be about her. I don’t know what to do about the situation, and I don’t know if there is even a way to help her.

20090309213839AAMZFC5	Social Science;Sociology	Age and grammar.  Is there a connection?	Well, I might of already answered my question, but I'd like an explanation.      I use to play World of Warcraft in a regular fashion and some of the older people in my guild, who I didn't know they were as old as they were, had horrible grammar.  For the longest time I use to think they were my age or younger.  Then I found out they had full-time jobs and I was amazed at how their grammar wasn't up to par, but maybe that's because it's a video game      Another incident, online person, this girl, which I didn't know how old she was, was convinced that I was much older than her or the same age.  Then I revealed my age and then she was amazed.  She said she hasn't met someone as intelligent as myself at such an age. (I'm only being honest on what she said, not having an ego.)  She was 18, but I'm only 15      What's the big whoop?

20090309220127AAraXDR	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	What does this mean to you?	So a while back I had a dream four of my friends and I were in some hell like realm and one of them got his arm bit off but we all jumped into some portal and suddenly were in full ski gear on the top of a mountain.  My friends tell me to check out some skiing dog but it turns out to be a skiing polar bear (used his large paws to ski) but no one believes me when I say its a polar bear instead of a dog.  I follow the bear on its run and video tape it doing jumps and flips and such.      I'm thinking this is a sign that it would be possible to teach a polar bear to ski but it sounds crazy, what does it mean/what do i do!?!?!?

My son Carson is 16 years old, lately he’s been doing stuff he wouldn’t do staying out late, drinking, an he stated smoking, an doing drugs, I know he an his girlfriend are having sex an this year he’s been kicked out of 3 very good private schools.

We tried everything to put him on the right track, like took his cell phone away, an his car, his computer, xbox, stopped giving him his $1,500 allowance, buying him cloths, everything he has nothing in the house. But his girlfriend bought him a new cell phone an he uses her car buys him cloths. I don’t know what to do anymore I need some advice? Me an my husband lose sleep over this, when he stay out all night, we wonder if he in a safe place or is he hurt or in jail?
20090309204208AAX09qH	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Can someone please explain my dream?	Ok, so a few nights ago I had a strange dream. But it was different from my other dreams. I was watching people in their worst nightmares. Sometimes I would force them to face their nightmares. (Example-I pushed some guy into a closet, which had a dead body in it.Locked him in and he started screaming bloody murder.)(I bet the dead body came alive)    I'm normally not like that! It's strange! I'm nice, but I can be evil sometimes. (barely) Can someone tell me what my dream meant?    Thanks!

20090309204952AAQVGte	Social Science;Sociology	Overpopulation? an ISSUE a THREAT?	Global Overpopulation, is it a major issue? As the time passes by, many generation of    babies come to life. As the population increases over time, so is the demand for every simple    matter.  However, one of the simple matters that human kind cannot achieve is the wish for the    unlimited capacity on Earth. It is said that the earth population is increasing tremoundously. About    211,00 or more people are added to the world and a population the size of Germany every year.    Increase in population is an issue. The more people there are, the less space we have. The lack    of space means to find new space, and a temporary solution is to make new ones. Which    concludes to cutting down trees and stealing nature from the animals that habitat the area.    Human kind is the root of all the problems occurring in this modern world. Destroying the habitat    of the animals for our increasing population is unfair. It is the cause for the mass extinction of    many exotic animals. To top it off, we are cutting their chances of living by polluting the    enviroment. Just imagine and consider how much trash an individual produces a day. With the    garbage produced in America alone, you could form a line of filled-up garbage trucks and reach    the moon. Each day the earth is deterioating, our mass numbers add up to the weight of the    world. Traffic in the freeway is a noticeable issue. It is a foreshadow, where driving cars may end    up to be biking a bicycle. A perfect example would be China. The country of China is extremely    populated that it has a law that prohibits a couple for having more than two children. If the    multiplication of our population increases, the less likely human race can support itself. The inifite    generations cannot survive by the limited resouces the Earth provides. Overpopulation equals    major tragedies. It is the definition of all the disasters that are happening. The world itself is    already suffering, not just from the enviromental issue but the people in it. People in third world    countries are starving. They are the victims of poverty. The whole earth soon enough will possibly    end up in a poverty state.  In a poverty state, people become corrupt, they will do anything to    survive. Corrupted people means corrupted government. It is hard to maintain peace between    two people if they are corrupted, even more hard for a generation of 211,000 people who are not    satisfied with their lives. Everything is a domino effect and the result of mass overpopulation may    trigger that effect. At the pace we are going through, the vast destruction of trees and plants, the    pollution, and overpopulation, human kind will not last. It is a big threat, an issue that must be    solved.

I think about my ex occasionally not a lot but i dream about him alot, most of the time its not just me and him its like except for once when we kissed in a dream. My relationship with my ex wasnt even that serious, we went out for like 2 or 3 months.
