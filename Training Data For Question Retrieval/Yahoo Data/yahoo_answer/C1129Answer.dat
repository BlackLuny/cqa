IYgiWL3Haa	I know of two dupes but one is really hard to find now. <br>  NYC, the cheapie drugstore brand came out with what they called Chroma Face Glow in 2 colors one was a berry shade and the other more of a bronze. They were identical to the skinfinishes and only 6$ at riteaid! They were limited edition though so they may be hard to find but there might be some left over at your local store.<br>  <br>  Another thing would be Laura Geller Blush and Brighten they are about 30$ but you can sometimes get them cheaper on ebay. You can get them on LauraGeller.com and QVC.com too. They come in pink tones, berry tones, bronze tones pretty much any color you would want and work exactly the same! Check them out!

AA12272513	People who tell you they hurt and don't hurt might help you...but it honestly all depends on your pain tolerance. If you feel pain easily than i'm sure it will hurt for a little while, but its not like it will stay in crucial pain for a week haha. Or if you feel pain only a little it'll be tender for a couple days but it won't completely hurt; it might just be "tender" without total pain only when you hit it. Or, you could take pain easily and you won't feel a thing really. I mean, you might feel it for the split second the person pierces your ear, but after that you won't feel it. When someone pinches me it hurts and is tender after but when i got mine done ( around 7 years old)  i had to ask when she was going to do it...and her answer was she already did it haha. I've had to repierce my earlobe cuz it closed, and it didn't hurt at all. I felt it for five seconds as i was doing it but I wasn't in tears or anything. Hope this helps and sorry my response is so long haha!|`|wPpxsHNGaa	how do u peirce something WITH OUT a needle? they dont hurt. ive had mine peirced a few times. ya it hurts a litl 4 a few seconds but its not very bad. ya it hurt wen i was 7 but not wen i was 12 or 13...i wud think anything besides a needle wud hurt rly bad....|`|WA4JoCEvaa	personaly i dont think it hurts to bad i mean it dose sting a little but if you put ice on it for a while and do it quick it wont be too bad|`|7Hgzm9SSaa	NO WAY IT DOESNT HURT AT ALL IT JUST FEELS LIKE A PINCH I WAS ALSO SCARED WHEN I GOT MY EARS PIERCED I WAS 13 AND I WAS SO LIKE NERVOUS AND THE IT HAPPEND AND IT FELT LIKE A PINCH I SWEAR TRUST ME
FkunZ9q4aa	You need to listen to your friends, honey.  You are NOT fat.|`|d508e71226a169afed7ebfc7e78bbc5baa	You ma'am are considered in some parts of the world as being a goddess, a thing of beauty, someone that should be put up on a pedestal, one that should be made a queen or wife of a prince with lots of maids and gold.  You are also in that fantasy land considered a person that any man in that land would cherish and share their life with.|`|bEypuYJ0aa	you're really tall so that's OK.|`|mqucJZSUaa	how long ago did you start you period?<br>  your young, you still have alot of time. make sure you eat breakfast!<br>  it is a must, you need to be eating three meals, maybe make a rule that after dinner you can't eat.|`|MV0lMuDMaa	Youre perfectly fine.|`|ojwRgCLqaa	Your average. <br>  As long as you eat healthy and exercise that's the best you can do. Everyone has different body types and different genes that their relatives passed down to you. So don't worry about it too much :)|`|OBuzcIDbaa	Don't pay attention to "Branden"...Don't look at numbers. If you are exercising and eating right and feel good, you are probably perfectly fine. 150 lbs. is not too much for someone that is 5'10". Keep doing what you're doing. I'm sure you're a babe!|`|PRaEOK9Maa	You're not fat but you could stand to lose a little weight. I'm an 18 year old male and I'm the same height as you and 10 pounds lighter. I've also always been slim though. People are different and we all have different frame sizes and builds. You obviously have a larger build since you are 5'10 and only 14, so you are gonna weigh more than say a friend who is like 5'5. (Which isn't a bad thing as long as you're at a healthy weight.)<br>  <br>   But as far as what else to do just cut back on carbs and high caolorie foods and don't over eat. It's also important to eat breakfast, skipping it will slow down your metabolism, and make it harder to lose weight.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|c4d63478f0175c245353b6222ab7a81eaa	Your 5 ft 10 and 150 lbs and you think your fat? My question for you is where?|`|SGnwnsAcaa	I don't know... I think i'm fat too. I'm 5'6" and 130. But just keep excercising. And i just started drinking three cups of super-caffinated tea a day. I'm hoping that it will increase my metabolism. Cuz they use green tea in allot of those weight loss suppliments.|`|n3Mk3cvCaa	since you are so tall, your weight to height ratio balance out. in other words you have a normal weight for someone your height. don't try to lose wait, it's unhealthy to lose wait when you're an average weight for your height.|`|5e4fFMf7aa	no, <br>  your not fat.<br>  trust me.<br>  :)<br>  its good your exercising|`|Jy69Dn9Maa	You are in perfect health especially at that height. Don tget an eating disorder please, because it sounds liek you are obsessive exercising.|`|9a3fC9mOaa	If people tell you you aren't fat, then you aren't... If you don't like the way you look, then change it.|`|Vcg2QuDWaa	Change your attitude.  The last thing you'd want is a lack of love and acceptance for yourself.  You are doing enough.  Good Luck!!|`|qV8Vz36Iaa	Please throw your TV and radio out a second story window right now! You are not fat by any scientific or medical standard that I can find. Why do you feel that you are fat? Is it vanity? Is it trying to be perfect? Are you developing an eating disorder? Skinny is not sexy or attractive in any way. You should pay attention to your friends. They do know.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure what you consider to be a healthy diet, but I suggest that you develop a lifestyle that includes: Low-fat, low-refined carb, low-sugar vegan diet. Watch your portions (not too much, not too little). If you are healthy and fit, you should strive to get about one hour of aerobic exercise 5 days per week. When you exercise, watch your heart rate so that you keep your heart rate in a healthy aerobic zone.<br>  <br>  Most people who are 5' 10" would love to weigh 150 pounds. What's most important is how you feel.<br>  <br>  Get 8-9 hours of deep, solid sleep.|`|B95ksbHDaa	You actually sound underweight.  Most 5'2 girls are about 110-125 pounds, if they are healthy.  I know, because I'm 5'2.  So, think about the fact that you are 8 inches taller, and about 25 pounds heavier.  That's about 3 pounds per inch.  Not bad at all.<br>  <br>  To be honest, I'm 5'2 and 150, and I am overweight, by about 20 pounds for my age, chest size, height, etc.  So...don't feel bad.  You need to accept how you are, and love it.  As long as you are living a healthy, happy, energetic life...you are good to go!|`|DxfFItv2aa	omg ur the normail weight for u age ur friends are right. im sure ur other friends think that too. what girl doesnt. its just selfesteem. and confidence. ur fine.|`|gyixPyOsaa	your age really is not a factor in this situation. @ 5'10' you are in the normal weight range. if you google "body mass index" you get this calculator thing and you put in your height and weight and it gives you a number which with yours will be 21.5 and that means of your whole body only 21.5% is fat and at your height you are in the normal range. the normal range for you is 18.5-24.9 and you are right in the middle. so  you are not leaning toward the over weight or the under weight end of it. you are perfect. and 5'10 at fourteen you could be a model girl!|`|l3RG5rtgaa	hmm no. im 14 and 5'6'' and 140. i'm not fat. pounds doesn't matter, i have muscle weight.<br>  there is a physcological thing where u see yourself as you are fatter than you actually are. plus people will think that if they excersize intensly for a week straight and they don't loose any weight they are fat.<br>  <br>  it is good that you are active- if you keep doing that for a while you will be more fit and have a great body. you aren't fat now but its always good be to fit.|`|oYmZUO8Caa	Your weight is fine for your height.|`|ILbgqBLxaa	you are not fat lol im 5 ft 1 and i am 120lbs, but id you want to lose weight just keep doing what you are doing cuz you are on the right track. most of all learn to love you and accept yourself =)|`|9lBe1JGAaa	Your not fat, dont worry about it.|`|00390bee0bdfb56e0334bd2845fadd9aaa	21.5 is your BMI<br>  which falls within the normal range|`|3PYBSFSyaa	You are not fat<br>  Your BMI is normal|`|Dn8i9sIlaa	Girl, if anything you may even be too skinny. 5'10" is tall! your weight is proportionate to your height :) also it sounds like you're overexercising! which is bad for you. everything in moderation k?|`|zlWDgSNZaa	ur tall and it sounds like you work out a lot, its probably muscle|`|SaPB4FPdaa	STAY THE SAME...LOTS OF OTHER GIRLS WOULD WANNA HVE UR WEIGHT!<br>  U R ALREADY SKINNY|`|IcAO0QuBaa	Your 14. You don't need to be worried about your weight. No you don't sound fat to me, for your height your weight is normal.|`|zGFiWSPtaa	Don't eat at restaurants it sucks. I know you eat healthy but here's some more tips:<br>  1. Switch white bread for whole wheat.<br>  2. Try to eat as many veggies and fruits as possible.<br>  3. Drink 2 percent or 1 percent milk or if you can stand it (i hate it) skim milk.<br>  4. When you cook chicken or meat, try to cut out as much fat as possible. Use kitchen scissors and trim almost all fat.<br>  5. Go light on the salad dressings, mayo, butter, oil. All these things seem insignificant but are suuuuppppeeerrrr unhealthy.<br>  6. WATCH YOUR DRINKS!!! People tend to watch their food but tend to forget that the mountain dew they're drinking with the salad kinda cancels out their salad!<br>  7. Not for staying thin, but for staying healthy which is waaaay more important, don't drink diet coke or anything. Instead of sugar, they use chemicals which poison your body.<br>  8. Learn to accept yourself. DON"T BE ANOREXIC. We're not all runway models naturally and as long as you're healthy, you're great.<br>  9. When you have soup, try to go clear instead of creamy thick soups, choose chicken noodle or beef barley instead of broccoli cheddar or something.<br>  10. SKIP DESSERT!!! Those brownies can only do you harm....remember, you don't have to deprive yourself but EVERYTHING IN MODERATION!!! YOu dont HAVE to have ice cream EVERY day!!<br>  11. Cheese should be balanced. Have a sprinkle or two on your salad. DON"T EAT THE WHOLE BAG!!! :P Obviously, NOT the best option.<br>  12. If you know, you're one of those people who eat one chip and have to have the rest, don't eat the first chip!!! It can only lead to more...<br>  13. If temptation is too much to handle at home, throw away all junk and keep fresh yummy healthy snacks instead. If a recovering herion addict is surrounded by heroin, he'd have to be super strong not to smoke it!! Same philosophy applies...<br>  <br>  BE PROUD OF YOU!!! LOVE YOURSELF!!! THIN DOES NOT EQUAL HEALTHY-HEALTHY EQUALS BALANCE, MODERATION, HAPPINESS AND LOVE!! GOOD LUCK! :P|`|OlELtv7Gaa	Maybe you can lose a little more weight but i would not consider you fat!!:]]|`|VTb8FpzHaa	YOu are so young, you don't have to diet, just cut back on the snacking, eat breakfast, and exercise regularly. You probably think your fat because you are really tall for 14. I was tall in middle school, but by the time I got to high school, everyone was taller than me. The taller you are, the skinnier you are and thats probably why you are told you are skinny. You are the only one who knows whats under your shirt. Lots of people tell me im skinny but i know the truth.|`|ad8c759f2edd3af6e7541dd4c05674c3aa	You seem to be doing everything right. I would add more protein to your diet though.|`|4ChLylwFaa	Who cares if you are fat people will accept you for who you are|`|P6H1HAgvaa	be comfortable in your skin. If you are healthy you should be fine.|`|AA10392637	It depends on your bone structure, but I would say you are not fat if your medium to large bone.  If you really think your fat consult your doctor and discuss this issue with him/her or talk to a nutritionist.<br>  If you are eating and exercising then you are probably healthy.  You can go online under Mayo Clinic and check out whether you are overweight or not.|`|l0RpBUCOaa	there is absolutely NO WAY you are fat!!! a celebrity trainer actually said that the the rule he uses for celebrities is 100 lbs for some one 5 feet tall and then an additional 5lbs for every inch. If you try to lose weight you're only going to hurt yourself in the long run. you have a nice celeb thin body. you have nothing to worry about. just be healthy and you're fine!|`|AA10495187	You're doing great, but you should keep a journal to see if you're making any progress in your weight loss.|`|db5f6d9593a678681b66a5729cebb0e3aa	You're not fat.  You do have poor self esteem.<br>  <br>  It's good to have a healthy lifestyle so continue to exercise and eat a balance diet of lean proteins, veggies, and fruits.  Drink lots of water too.<br>  <br>  But do not diet.  Your weight for your height and age is perfectly healthy.|`|YSkRoVxTaa	Im 16 and I'm 5'7" and im 120, so you most be normal haha|`|rEx5MSdQaa	umm,your avrage<br>  just eat when your hungry<br>  i eat in the morning<br>  and when i come back from school<br>  and for meee its like on meal<br>  and i am full the rest of the day...<br>  <br>  <br>  avoid soda,chips,sugar<br>  <br>  try to stay with the goods<br>  i mean yuuu could eat it but just not allot|`|sOkTUYq7aa	weight doesn't determine whether you are fat or not.  You know, most of your weight comes from your bones and muscles..|`|HYZYjV3Qaa	stop asking leading questions, you're pretty much asking people to tell you you're not fat..|`|uMEszNmZaa	You're not fat. Your weight is normal, especially for your height. As long as you exercise weekly and eat healthy like you already are (whole grains, wheat, fruits and veggies, not a bunch of junk foods/soda), then it's fine.|`|qmUbe8bSaa	no way!!

TNXQbg4Saa	put a snap clip in to keep it together. it'll train your hair and it'll go away. where it around the house and when you sleep.|`|vfuM5KtRaa	Part the hair while wet add a bit of hair spray & blow dry.|`|6iCOMx8laa	flat iron|`|kTTK2YoCaa	bobby pins and hairspray...|`|YoSgEUstaa	Well, for my husbands hair, I gel his hair and spike the back so it's less obvious. I use garnier fructis hair gel. It smells nice and is a good price.<br>  <br>  I also have this problem when I part my hair on the side (which I have to do because my hair cut and layered to be parted that way.) I wet it down with water and then spray it lightly with hair spray. I personally use volumax because it smells really nice and it's cheap.<br>  <br>  another thing I do, which if you're into the look may be an easy thing for you, is I part my hair on the side, spray my bangs so they stay, and then I wear a headband (my favorite is white with blue stars... i have a star tattoo theme...) and then I spray the back of my hair with water (it's layered shorter than the rest) and I put a little hair gel in my hands, rub them together, and mess up the back so it's a little spiky/messy on top of the rest of my straight hair. Then I finish off the look with hair spray. It covers up any misbehaving hair.|`|s63bm0Guaa	unfortunately there is no way to actually get rid of it....however, when you blow dry, blow dry the hair back and forth over the cow lick....so if its in your bangs, blow dry moving the hair from left to right over your forehead until its dry. i use this technique all the time in the salon. it will help close the space up.|`|wPpxsHNGaa	well if ur hair is used 2 being styled one way, its gunna take time 4 it 2 react normally in a diferent way. wen i started parting my hair 2 the side i hairsprayed it down and it took a few days to saty that way by itself|`|Tcv3dDqKaa	you really can't "fix" them<br>  go to a hairdresser and try to get a haircut that will help it be less noticeable maybe?|`|rXEVEfqHaa	Cowlicks are impossible to fix. All I can say is a lot of hairspray and a small clip or bobby pin to keep the hair the way you want it.|`|24cUKZDgaa	train it, like for example when you go to bed, sleep on your hair the way you want it. etc.
P5CyGvZuaa	You look scared of something.<br>  <br>  Emo-looking-away-from-the-camera-even though you're taking it of yourself pictures are way overrated.  You're a pretty girl.

Like the other user said it might be rosacea, in which case you should go to your doctor, there are still products out there that you can wear under your makeup to minimze the redness. Although its expensive MAKEUPFOREVER has a color corrector especially formulated for redness, people with rosecea can also use this. Its the green undertone, simply smooth this on your face and apply your regular foudnation over it. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sephora.com/browse/product.jhtml?id=P217906&searchString=hd%20color%20corrector" rel="nofollow">http://www.sephora.com/browse/product.jh...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  You can also try clinique redness relief, it really helps minimize facial redness.

OrKLpzenaa	You don't want to do fake tanners, because no matter what they always look fake. If you don't want to tan, I would definitely embrace you pale skin!! I happen to be a redhead, but my skins not dramatically pale, but its definitely not near a tan and it took me a while to embrace my skin. I had multiple attempts to tan, but its just not my skin type to tan. People with porcelain skin get more compliments than people with dark tans. You can definitely make pale work!!! I'm sure it's not nearly as bad as you think, it's just you being self conscious. I'm sure you look great!|`|rAAHHYEWaa	use tanning lotion and try laying in the sun|`|EKElOaraaa	use fake tanner, or go spray tanning.since you are fair skinned i would stay away from actual sun bathing.|`|m5O8ogFHaa	Im a slight redhead and have the same kind of skin.

0cJjyogqaa	mascara :<br>  A. Wiggle the wand left to right at the base of lashes. It's the mascara placed near the roots, not the tips.. that gives the illusion of length.<br>  B. Pull the wand up and through lashes, wiggling as you go.<br>  C. In this final step, close the eye and place the mascara wand on top of lashes at the base and pull through to remove any clumps.<br>  <br>  eyeliner<br>  Eyeliner should be applied close to the base of the eyelashes. Products vary from cake to liquid liner to pencil. Practice makes perfect in achieving a fine line. Hold your head back and look down into the mirror. The eyelid will be tight and it will be easier to apply the liner. Smudge if necessary.|`|eow59EaEaa	That all depends on what eye shape you have :) If you have large round eyes, you can line the inner rims of your eyes, or you could also line your upper lash line all the way and the bottom about 2/3 the way in. This will elongate your eyes.<br>  <br>  If you have smaller eyes, don't line the inner rims. That will make them appear smaller. Instead, just line the top lash line and extend the tip just a little past your lash line to give the illusion of a larger lid.<br>  <br>  For mascara, just wiggle the brush horizontally from base to tips, applying 2-3 coats for maximum coverage.|`|r4xRkqzdaa	tips:<br>  -eyeliner MUST be worn with mascara... never alone<br>  -you can wear mascara by itself anyday<br>  -use quality, fresh products... never older than 6 months!<br>  <br>  use eyeliner first:<br>  -get as close as you can to the lashline as possible<br>  -use a pencil at first;  liquid liner is too hard<br>  -rest your hand/elbow on the counter<br>  <br>  mascara:<br>  -curl ur dry clean lashes with lash curler<br>  -NEVER pump your mascara wand up and down in the tube- it causes  dry spots and clumps!<br>  -start at the base and wiggle it as you do long strokes up and out

Not to be a b*tch, but you are so angry and bitter you can't even accept people's kind words. Why did you ask this question if you didn't want answers like "oh, everyone has a soulmate!" and "lots of girls like dorky guys!"? The truth is, not that many dorky people get dates in high school unless, by some rare occasion, there is a good looking, un-shallow person out there willing to see their personality instead of their dorkiness. The reason I personally don't think you're all that wonderful is because you don't even give perfect strangers a chance. I consider myself to be attractive, and I like anyone who's nice to me. I especially love nerds, because I actually find them more interesting than the mindless jock-prep-abercrombie guys. I do not enjoy the company of a guy who thinks he's the sh*t. You're not the only one in your situation, so stop feeling sorry for yourself. Getting dates isn't the only thing worth living for, you dumba*s. Good luck getting things in perspective.|`|ExaerfDraa	Dude, the trick is to be confident. Girls dont like guys that do everything they say and be nice to them all the time. You have to be a dick to girls sometimes to get them interested. I used to be nice to my girlfriends and they always walked all over me. I decided to try to be an asshole sometimes and I seem to have better luck. Be confident and an asshole and you will see drastic improvement. Confidence, Confidence, Confidence. You will be turned down many times (all guys are) but there are to many girls out there to just focus on one. At least until you have a connection.  Good luck man, The pimp force is strong with you my son, You must look inside yourself and find your confidence. Dressing like a grown man will help too, bathe, fresh haircut, light cologn, im the **** attitude, stick your chest out and just be honest and tell the girl you think she is the most beautiful woman you have ever laid eyes on. Ask for numbers. You will never get girls unless you talk to them like a MAN.

These are just events in life that occur to make us aware of what is going on around us. Read Carl Jung. I think we are like magnets. If we are constantly thinking negative thoughts, then we attract negatives into our life. Likewise if our thought are positive then we attract wonderful positives into our life.<br>  Now you may ask how do you do this. Well it's rather simple. Sadness, fear, guilt, and anger, are all negative emotions, are they not?<br>  And all of your emotions come after a feeling don't they? And before you have any feeling you have a thought do you not? Who's thoughts are you having? They are your thoughts aren't they. Of course they are! You make them, so you own them. You CONTROL them do you not? Of course you control them. Our thoughts are the only thing in this world that we do truly have control over. This is what free will means. We are free to think what we want. So the next time you begin to have this negative emotion, make a conscious effort and say to yourself. Why am I having these thoughts? I will stop NOW. These are my thought to do with them as I will. I refuse to think this way.<br>  Your thoughts create your world. Change your thoughts and you change your world. See yourself as an intelligent attractive man, and this is what others will see as well!.|`|0vo7tDP5aa	please don't cut yourself. <br>  <br>  you can still easily change. switch up your dress style to something that looks good and is trendy. get a new hair cut. maybe something messy/spiky. change the way you walk around and present yourself. you'll start getting some attention. guaranteed.|`|AA11926074	not really depends on where your at. <br>  you don't need 2 dress like a slut to get attention but look nice to catch a guys attention.

I find that products with fruit in them help my skin glow/clear out also.<br>  However, do NOT over exfoliate your face. You should only exfoliate once a week. If you do it more, it makes your skin more prone to zits and other blemishes.<br>  <br>  I use this facial/hand wash from the organic brand Jason twice a day--once in the morning, and once before I go to bed. It's mild enough so it doesn't dry out my skin, but it also cleanses my face really well.<br>  As for moisturizer, I use Neutrogena once a day since my face can get dried out too.<br>  <br>  hope this helped :)|`|YfsXToJ2aa	everyday i begin washing my face with warming acne and blackhead cleansir. once i wash that off i dry my face and apply neutrogena oil free face lotion. the lotion is awesome because it has no oil so it doesnt leave your face oily,shiny or anything. then i apply makeup. once my day is over i wash my face over again with the neutrogena acne and blackhead cleansir. i dont apply lotion on after though because breaking out may occur so i dont take any chances.<br>  <br>  during the day also i use neutrogena oil absorbing sheets. there amazing they absorb oil if you have any but dont smudge makeup.<br>  <br>  water is a big part of your face. i used to drink pepsi and never drank water and thats when i noticed my face was in seriouse condition acne wise. so water really helps to maintain a gorgeouse face:] hope i helped|`|rduVctOraa	Hi,<br>  <br>  Is this what you are talking about????|`|9QL9Wpo8aa	What works best is to remove all of your makeup first. Then wash your face with a good cleanser, i like clean and clear. Use a toner to clean deep down and get any left over makeup. You should exfoliate once a week to remove dead skin, that will make your skin softer, and get rid of small bumps that aren't quite zits.|`|C6Ozw9draa	toner: apple cider vinegar works well, you can mix it with lemon juice for your sensitive skin<br>  <br>  cleanser: neutregena advanced solutions (beware, the acne control lotion may cause dry skin, apply only where you have acne)<br>  <br>  moisterizer/mask:  twice a week mix 1/4 cup cooked oatmeal with 2 tbs baking powder, apply to face and let sit for 15 mins, then rinse with warm water. This moisterizes your skin, helps take away redness and swelling and gives you that "glow"

I would forbid people to cry for me, and instead would simply have fun. My last week would be awesome.

Monday: I would sit at home listening to music and write letters to everyone that I love and than once again spend time with family and friends. Tuesday: I'd go on a daredevil trip (bungee jumping, sky diving, six flags magic mountain etc with people are brave enough to do it with me since I'm going to die anyways might as well. Wednesday I would maybe go to Disneyland or visit my old schools just to walk down memory lane again. I'd call my old friends just to say hi or something. Thursday: I would go on a eating binge because I love to eat. Friday: I would finally say my goodbyes and drive to a quiet beautiful mountain or beach by myself and just sit there enjoying nature and it's beauty and finally on Saturday: I assume I have until night time.

0ioylgULaa	look into the mirror everyday and tell yourself you are beautiful.<br>  it really works.<br>  think of all the things you like about yourself, for example, you may love your long legs, so show them off and be proud.<br>  :D|`|oL1N64bEaa	I find that low self-esteem stems from a lack of self-awareness.  It seems like you have something you enjoy doing and are confident about in Softball, but you still have confidence issues around others.  Why?<br>  <br>  Certainly, I applaud you for losing that much weight.  Not because that's what other people want, but because its what you want.  Sometimes we hear social-hippies say things like, "You should be happy with who you are."  That's true... but mostly for the "you" inside of you.  If you are not happy with how you look on the outside, it can kill your confidence.  Over time, the "you" inside of you can get lost in that fear.  I bet you feel pretty good about yourself after losing that weight, and that new happiness translates to everything you do.  So, continue that healthy lifestyle, but it may not be everything.<br>  <br>  I would encourage you to think about what things make you happy.  Be aware of them.   Do you tend to be embarrassed about doing these things or talking about them in front of others?  If so, then try not being that way.  Try thinking, if someone was to give you grief about something you like you say, "Its fun.  I like it.  You should too."  Don't think too much about what people think you should be doing.  Think more about what you want to do.  Its your very own life.  If nobody else gets hurt, you should be free to do as you please.<br>  <br>  I want you to be happy with yourself.  Think, "People should be so lucky to have what I have and be like I am."  You don't have to be arrogant, but you can be someone who needs nothing as long as you let yourself be.  Then pass it on to someone else.  You're fine, but maybe other's around you aren't.  Get to know others around you.  Listen to their needs, their problems, and I'm sure your own will pass.<br>  <br>  Have fun and just keep moving forward.|`|qLJnCj0Naa	Just be confident! That's key!<br>   Even if people tell you stuff don't pay attention. What they don't realize is that they have flaws also and that they are in no right to tell you anything. <br>  I suggest you try to get more out there, like try out for the softball team (if you already haven't or if you are not yet in it). Or try to talk more to people.<br>  You should be glad you are that tall, man I wish I was that tall.

But I can understand that some people are attracted to a small frame very lean and fat free.<br>  But considering that she was kinda chubby, I feel that she went completely to the other side, Not healthy because healthy means having muscles. I think she is Definitely using food as a substance she can control (this is a very common occurrence) and it seems possible this is the case given her past with serious hard drugs, addicts like to replace substances and to me it is Obvious that She has, and having a role model like Rachel Zoe could not be a worst thing in her life, yuck.<br>  BUT some people are naturally very thin and I can see beauty in that too.

H3PcFertaa	There should not be a problem. Like said, be sure that you drink orange juice and eat something after giving blood, and about 1hour before you go in for your tattoo. Get a good nights sleep, and be sure to relax and hold still.<br>  You should be just fine.<br>  luck~|`|F9wds6MOaa	Yes. However, you should not give blood for a few weeks AFTER getting a tattoo due to the chance that you have picked up a disease and don't yet know it or can't yet be accurately tested for it. For instance, in the unlikely event that you picked up HIV at a tattoo parlor, then gave blood the next day, you would be transmitting HIV without knowing it. Even when you go through all the proper screening procedures, it takes about two weeks before your body produces enough antibodies for you to test positive for HIV.|`|F89MNQheaa	It should be, I know the reason you cant give blood "after" getting one for 6 months i think is cos of the ink and saftey incase dirty needles etc|`|mB7C2n0Maa	I don't see why not.  Just make sure to drink lots of fluids after you give blood which is what they'll tell you to do anyway.|`|rPAzUwqraa	be sure to get it in a sterile environment|`|6L9jJnchaa	Yeah, as long as it's not the other way around...getting the tattoo and then giving blood, lol.  Just make sure you stay really hydrated.<br>  <br>  THANKS FOR GIVING BLOOD!
rPoKRm8gaa	You might want to wear a thin layer of black eyeliner on the bottom lid, and a bit of mascara. If your in highschool, you might want to try light pink eyeshadow. Hope this helps!|`|yU2WHyvgaa	First, wash your face, brush teeth etc<br>  next, put moisturizer on your face (non oily one)<br>  then, put powder on, same color as your skin<br>  then, light pink eyeshadow or gold, maybe clear mascara<br>  then some light peachy blush<br>  last, chapstick and or lip gloss<br>  i use E.L.F makeup most of the time. It's only one dollar and it is all natural, and doesn't test on animals which is awesome|`|DErBSfZgaa	try going to the natural look.<br>  put on some powder, alittle thin line of dark brown or black eyeliner,<br>  and some nice brown or olive/green eyeshadows.|`|3866f8902aa539f737e362949ec4f25baa	less is more, go to a better department store that has a makeup counter and have a free application done (because of your age you may need a parent with you) but they can be real good suggesting colors and stuff and then you can just write down the color names and try to remember the best you can what they look like and go to Walmart and look for less expensive versions of the colors you are looking for.|`|9D6Y4dYuaa	Hey there! <br>  <br>  It seems like you are in the midst of finding what works best for you.

Apply some concealer to any pimples or under-eye shadows.  To apply the concealer without it looking like you're trying to conceal anything, put the concealer on your fingertip, and pat it onto the areas you want to conceal.  If your face is shiny, apply some pressed powder to the shiny areas.  Apply some light pink blush or shimmery bronzer to the apples of your cheeks for a natural look.  To find the apple of your cheek, smile really wide and apply the blush/bronzer to the part that pops out a bit.To really accentuate your brown eyes, I would suggest using either purple or green eyeliner or eyeshadow.  Apply black mascara.  Groom your eyebrows a bit (just brush them upwards, then run your finger along them).  Some sheer pink or clear lip gloss looks really nice too.  To bring this look to night, apply darker eyeshadow in the crease of your eye, and put on darker lipstick or lip gloss.  Hope I helped!|`|qsVIz4K6aa	If you want a routine i've got one for you.

MbRygPqTaa	No! Clear bars are made of acrylic. Which is not good for infections (i think its porous, which is great for bacteria to hide in)<br>  You should keep the stainless teel or silver bar until the wound heals completely, Then you can change it to any of the great fun obvious or discreete bars out there!<br>  But I find that it is crucial to take good care of your new peircing while it heals, Remember that the tongue is very special because its always moist (bacteria) miniscule food particles can get stuck everywere (Bacteria) and warm (BACTERIA HEAVEN) <br>  <br>  So for 1 week:<br>  FOOD: Avoid Hot sources lol it will hurt soo bad because metal transfers heat really fast, so you will feel the pain inside your tongue! <br>  Avoid: Faty foods like pork or peanuts or fried food. Lactose stimulates mucus production which is not good for internal injuries like a piercing. Spicy food and Acids will also be unpleasant and not be productive for a healthy healing. Controlling the food is the bigest anoyance of the things you have to do to care for your new piercing.<br>  <br>  Alaways always always wash your mouth after you eat. even if you dont normaly do it ;p<br>  <br>  At the very least, for 3 days you have to continually sanitize your muth. Every 30 minutes: Do Gargles with pure water and bakin soda and salt. AND rinse with Mouth Wash Diluted in PURE water. The water has to be purified otherwise the mouth washes antibacterial properties will be used to disinfect your water and no your mouth. And it has to be diluted 1 part mouthwas 4 parts water, otherwise you will over dry it (because you will do it every hour) and a hole other set of bacteria that are normaly in check will burst out of controll and create problems. <br>  If your tongue has a whitish layer on it, this has happened.<br>  <br>  And as an added precausion Ive heard its not good to exercise in ecxes right after you pierce or recieve sunshine, it will really make you sick, but I dont know why so ill leave that up to you.<br>  <br>  I know it sounds like a lot, but you can do it for a week and a sweet piercing!<br>  <br>  Consider that if things go wrong they can go really bad... <br>  An Infection in your Mouth?? EEWW! bad smell, taste (even for you) Your Piercing might get screwed up, because if you get a bad infection the first thing they are going to do is take it out, in which case you lost the piercing money, and that just su suck$. <br>  Its a delicate area just take care of it for 1 tiny week and you will b good forever!<br>  <br>  Mine swolle up to two and a half times its size it was crazy! i couldnt even speak, and still my dad didnt notice till a year later, when I showed it to him! lol<br>  <br>  Oh! and make sure the person who does it knows what they are doing!<br>  There are two vains that run on either side of your tongue, and if they pierce those by accident your tongue will turn black and bloody and it is just a very very bad situation...tattoos and piercings are NOT the same thing.<br>  <br>  ah! and the first bar you get has to be Longer than normal because of the swelling. lol imagine on top of having a hole in your mouth it feeling like you have a pair of tweasers pinching down in the middle because your bar is too tiny...<br>  <br>  Hope You take my advice so you will enjoy your kicka$$ piercing for a long time.<br>  <br>  Let me know if you need clarification or anything else.|`|5591d5b589cf4ab86bc88e9dcd8fc00daa	You have to get a standard ring first until it heals.They put in a special ring so that if your tongue swells, I'll be ok.
naPq2mbtaa	Zit Prevention Plan<br>  <br>  Preventing zits...Steps to stop the eruptions<br>  <br>  Here are some tips on reducing and preventing zits. But remember, even if you practice good hygiene and have healthy eating habits, chances are you'll break out at some point. It's normal.<br>  <br>  1. Wash<br>  <br>  Wash your skin morning and night with a gentle cleanser that cleans your pores without drying your skin (don't use grainy, harsh scrubs since these can actually cause acne). i recommend you use neutragena pink grape fruit oil free acne wash.<br>  <br>  <br>  2. T-zone<br>  <br>  Some areas of your face, like your forehead, nose, and chin (often called the T-zone because it's shaped like the letter T) might be oilier than the rest of your face. So treat it differently: wash it with a non-oily cleanser.<br>  3. Water<br>  <br>  Drink a lot of water. It helps flush away impurities.<br>  4. Foods<br>  <br>  Although foods cannot cause zits, some people find that what they eat affects their skin. So say hello to healthy food, like fresh fruit and veggie snacks and see-you-later to chocolate and greasy foods like french fries and buttered popcorn. If you think you get zits after eating certain foods, keep a list and avoid eating too much of them or eating them at all.<br>  5. Relax!<br>  Anxiety and stress can cause the adrenal glands to make more hormones, which can cause zits to suddenly pop up. You have a lot going on in your life, but try to take time out for a walk or yoga or whatever works for you.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ********* PRODUCT FOR ACNE GOING AWAY FAST***********<br>  also i recommend you buy a bottle of tea tree oil [it works trust me there was a big improvement in my acne the the first time i used it. you can buy it at CVS or Wal Mart or Walgreens. you put it on a cotton ball or cotton pad and put a thin layer of it on your face.

I use St. Ives scrub in the morning [NOT the acne formula, since it makes my skin breakout]. I moisturize with Cerave lotion. Cerave is a gentle, fragrance-free lotion that helps repair damaged skin. It is one of the few moisturizes that doesn't irritate my skin. <br>  <br>  I only use gentle make-up. For example, I use a combination of Neutrogena and Physician's Formula. Like the Cerave, these are the only products that don't irritate my sensitive skin. In addition, Neutrogena has a great line of products for acne-prone skin that I used during breakouts. <br>  <br>  At night I wash my face with Cetaphil moisturizing cleanser and apply a thing layer of Cerave. It's also important to use a moisturizer with an SPF; however, I'm still searching for one that doesn't irritate my skin. As a note, I tried Proactiv as well and had TERRIBLE results with it. <br>  <br>  It's important to find an individualized skin care program through trial and error and stick with it. Good luck! :)|`|OFx8gmw8aa	Go 2 the doctors to go on possibly roaccutane that will really clear up your acne...

Your hands (and feet) go through so much wear and tear that tattoos don't have great longevity on the fingers, toes, sides, and anything underneath.<br>  <br>  Also bear in mind that you will be closing a hell of a lot of doors on yourself in terms of job opportunities.

Wish the world didnt work like that but unfortunatly alot employers think that way.|`|pAsdcjcoaa	Not sure i like her tattoo but it will be hard to get a job with that dont u know!? not unless u dont want a professional job or anything then go for it!! its not like cheryl cole is gonna be applying for jobs isit!<br>  ive heard theres not many places that do them tattoos like her cant remember the reason.|`|JmNaXTjqaa	i wouldnt have thought it would because its tattooed so how could it, ou cant just wash them off|`|F9wds6MOaa	the main problem with getting a tattoo on your pinkie finger is that it's going to be SMALL, and that the fading/blurring on small, detailed tattoos is more noticeable than on larger, simpler tattoos.<br>  tattoos on your hands do blur and fade more than tattoos elsewhere for two reasons: hands have very little fat and they are almost always exposed to the sun. tattoo machines deposit the tattoo ink under the skin, in the fatty layer (called the "dermis") between the epidermis and the bone. since your hands have very little fat, there is not much cushion in which the ink particles can lie (imagine trying to stick a thumb tack in a brick wall as opposed to a cushy bulletin board). this also means that finger tattoos are more painful than tattoos on, say, the fattier part of your arm, or on your leg. foot tattoos are painful for the same reasons.<br>  hand tattoos also fade because the hands, along with the face, are rarely covered by clothing and therefore always exposed to the sun--the main culprit of tattoo fading. many people rub sunblock on their tattoos to protect from fading, but this would be a major pain to do on your hand and would come off as soon as you washed them.|`|9e0c65deddb534befd562aeef9368629aa	I have a tattoo on my finger , i had it done about 2 yrs ago it has faded since ive had it done , but i do wear my wedding ring on that finger aswell , all tats fade after a while so you could always have it touched up thats what im getting done to mine.

I think you shudmaybe add 10 dollars to the real cost it cost you to make it...because its always ebst to be fair to the customer since you are getting 10 dollars of profit. I mean I really do believe 150 is way too much for something thats handmade and beaded...but i think the 15 dollar bracelet you show on that page is not too bad with its pricing...theres a chance I'd like to purchase that ;].

Primero checa que no tengas colitis nerviosa, eso  en serio que te pone una panza de pelota para ejercicios de aerobics. Si tu vejiga se llena, pues también tu panza se incrementa. Es lógico si tomas mucha agua. Por último, la grasa abdominal es la más difícil de bajar.<br>  Si estas siguiendo una dieta, lo mas recomendable es que sea una que te recomiende un nutriólogo. Ellos saben que recomendarte en cada caso, para bajar la grasa difícil. Pero una recomendación que puedo darte es hacer diariamente ejercicio, por veinte minutos. Si no eres una atleta profesional, empieza por caminar diariamente, luego intenta en vez de caminar trotar. Combina estos ejercicios con abdominales,  además de una dieta saludable y verás como se disminuye tu panza!<br>  Suerte!|`|4c4d9ce07d03232e7c45356c18e8fb18aa	ejercicios aerobicos (correr, bici, nadar) y dieta equilibrada baja en grasas, de 5 comidas al dia y 2 a 3 litros de agua|`|58d996374de7af7c70413ec02724903aaa	Primero que todo haste un licuado de la mitad de una pi?a y 1 pepino con abundante agua como para 8 vasos.<br>  Al levantarte tómate uno, sigue la dieta que llevas y pasate el resto del dia tomandote el licuado sin azucar, no lo tomes depues de comida ni cena, por que te hace engordar más.<br>  <br>  En mi pais se usa mucho y las mujeres andan usualmente planitas.|`|HFGvwZ4laa	toma las conchas de 12 naranjas y pones a cosinar en 2 litros de agua esperas que se reduja a un litro yn tomas todos los dias te garantiso en 8 dias ves los resultado pero es amrgo el te tu ves si te lo tomas pero da resultados extraordinarios|`|adb82dd4659ee3f85f5fad28d496add3aa	sube y baja escaleras y olvida el ascensor y el transporte público (a no ser que sean distancias extremas), bebe mucha agua, camina mucho, come sano, sin fritos, mucha fruta y verdura, nada de bebidas con gas, haz ejercicio diariamente,.... no sé qué más aconsejar.|`|0e404a7f28bbab7e06ef879e0204c74eaa	Trata de bajar de peso, no de líquidos.

La panza no baja si no eliminas grasa y haces ejercicio, y hay casos en que no baja si no es con cirugía.

Estaba 2 horas en el gym de lunes a sabado, con un instructor que me decía que tenía que hacer para las diferentes areas del cuerpo.  De cintura era 36 y bajé a 32.  La comida, elimené los dulces, las harinas, las cosas fritas, el arroz.  Las carnes las comía la vapor, muchos vegetales.  Cuando bajé hasta donde quería, comenzé a comer de todo pero en peque?as cantidades y no todos los días.  Debes hacer un buen balance, y eliminar las comidas enlatadas y muy procesadas.  Trata de comer lo mas natural posible y tomar mucha agua.  Ah, tambien elimina por completo la soda, aunque sea de dieta.  No sirven.  Tambien el té rojo y el verde ayudan a desintoxicar el cuerpo, que también eso hace que no rebajes.|`|cb0446753edb12046fc5e62a31667c56aa	NO ES OTRa ke kombinacion  de ejercicio mas dieta..|`|low7Yk8xaa	pues mira come sano haz ejercicios no comas mal como lechugas berduras y todo eso ya veras como aldegazas

Otras por el contrario, necesitan una ayudita, ya sea con la vestimenta, calzado, pelo largo, etc.  Por ejemplo, hay mujeres que con traje o falda lucen mas elegantes que con pantalón.  Otras, no.  Para mi, una mujer elegante y femenina es aquella que camina suelta, sin exagerar.  Que lleva su pelo suelto y bien peinado.  Que su piel luzca limpia.

Ejemplo: si tu cabello es muy rizado debes usar por lo menos seis sobres de gel, aplicandolos uno cada 2 o 3 dias.con esto debes tener paciencia porque en la primera aplicacion el cambio que mas notas es el de color, pero cuando ya llevas unos tres sobres vez un buen cambio en el cabello asi que debes cumplir todas las aplicaciones requeridas para que veas el cambio que quieres,cuando lo apliques no lo enrolles con ganchos dejalo bien estiradito y pidele a alguien que te ayude a cubrirlo con plastico envolvente de estos de cocina y dejalo el tiempo que se indica en el sobre. despues de esto lo puedes repetir unos 3 o 4 meses <br>  despues y hasta mas dependiendo del crecimiento de tu raiz. pero ten en cuenta que tambien debes hidratar tu cabello con ampollas, mascarillas, etc. lo que quiero decir es que tu tambien ayudes un poco a estos tratamientos para que tu cabello se vea además sano.

Q63970Zuaa	En particular hablo claro, es decir soy sincera, en el momento puede dolerle mucho, pero es mejor que duela ahora y no que por lastima entables una relación con una persona que no te gusta, y luego lo trates mal, porque es natural, aunque te esforzaras para aprender a quererlo eso rara vez se logra. Entonces le haces un favor al ser sincera, si esa persona gusta de ti, también debe tener algún tipo de aprecio o cari?o, eso hará que pueda comprenderte mejor. Pero si no lo hace, porque se han dado casos, y se molesta porque me ha pasado, no te sientas mal, tu misma lo haz dicho, no le distes esperanzas, no  tienes que sentirte culpable de ningún modo, además la vida es así, no siempre somos correspondidos, y debemos a prender a no ilusionarnos de la nada. Puedo entender lo mal que te sientes, a mi me ocurrió con mi mejor amigo, y aunque me dolía mucho verlo tan enamorado, no podía darle falsas esperanzas, y hable con total sinceridad, eso si, hay que cuidar un poco la forma en que decimos las cosas, no vaya a ser que lastimemos el doble. Puedes decirle que en verdad lo quieres mucho, pero que no hay química desde el principio y así no funciona, también puedes decirle que se ha creado una bonita amistad, y que sabes, que si vas mas allá con el, se arruinaría, porque tu eres así, o puedes decirle que ahora tu estas algo ilusionada con otra persona y que no hay ojos para mas nadie. Cualquiera de estas cosas va a aclararle la situación, pero hará que no sufra tanto. Y te recuerdo, no te sientas mal, tú no le haz dado esperanzas, así que no te sientas comprometida. Eres buena de corazón y te importa lo que sienta este chico, pero no por ello, vas a estar con alguien que no te causa ninguna atracción, la vida es así. Espero que lo soluciones.|`|0760d0a9cbf00571acfba89f399fac52aa	Ni idea.

AA10954621	I don't know if it's reversible, but I guess it works like a 'permanent' perm. Hair rebonding is the straightening of naturally curly/wavy hair, by breaking down the natural structure using chemicals. It looks pretty good, if you have it done by an experienced professional, but even they would advise you not to, for the obvious reason of destroying your hair shaft (same thing goes for getting a perm!). If your hair's not that curly anyway, you might as well just blow dry them straight. Usually I've seen girls getting their hair straightened when they want to get one of those choppy cuts for straight hair. It makes sense for that reason. But I've even heard of some straight haired girls getting their hair rebonded, which is ridiculous!! Good luck changing your hair style though!|`|fb430344eb4bbdb5c2db22f73dd57422aa	u can try ask the hair dresser. if, i not mistaken . it mean straighten back ur hair n wash ur hair thenur hair will turn back 2 the black n shining colour.|`|AA10430440	its permanent straightenin<br>  no not reversible u have to wait for it to grow out|`|bcca70f6f32b030a89edeebbeb6cc224aa	hair rebonding make frizzy and curly hair straight,it is reversible as it lasts upto 6 months

6YutLOEIaa	Tienes razón, si, es muy importante cultivar lo que hay dentro formarnos como personas eticas, con conciencia social, reconocer al otro como igual y en la medida de lo posible amar a los demás sean como sean. Esto en pocas palabras se llama equilibrio. Para lograr dicho equilibrio es importante también tener un cuerpo saludable y cuidarte, asearte y esmerarte por estar siempre de la mejor manera, porque que sacamos si una persona es extremadamente buena persona pero nadie se le puede acercar porque huele mal o es extremadamente dejado en su aspecto fisico? En resumidas cuentas se debe encontrar el punto medio y dejar de preocuaprse en exceso por cosas que con el tiempo queremos o no cambian o desaparecen (la juventud y la belleza) y es en este momento de la vida donde llegamos a preguntarnos si valió la pena la gran lucha con el espejo y si debimos habernos esforzado más por cultivar nuestra personalidad y esmerarnos un poco más en el contacto con la gente y en la ayuda solidaria|`|R8ZDbV0Kaa	Asi es lo mas bello es lo de adentro porque pueden ser bellos por fuera pero feos por dentro y una persona asi no vale|`|zCXpSYeJaa	Yo creo que cultivar el intelecto es mucho más importante, después si uno que estar contento consigo mismo y mejorar su físico pues bien.

ue70ylH6aa	Hola! El consejo que te dejo es que no tomes ningunas hormonas que dicen hacen crecer el pecho: no solo no hacen crecer como aumentan el riesgo del cancer de mama; hay dos cosas que puedes hacer: una es esperar el despues de un embarazo, pero tanto puede que te quiedes con el pecho mas grande como aun mas peque?o, depende de mujer para mujer, la otra cosa es una operacion y debo decirte que las cosas no son como las pintan por ejemplo un implante de silicona no es para siempre como mucha gente piensa y muchos malos medicos no informan, hay que cambiar las protesis de silicona entre cada 5 a?os (minimo) a cada 12 a?os (maximo) y eso hasta el final de la vida o hasta que te saquen para siempre la silicona y despues se ve muy feo se ve piel y nada mas: eso es lo que te digo de corazon a veces es mejor una quedarse como está o si sigue en frente para algo que lo haga con toda la informacion posible.

16 a?os, la verdad es que lograba suplir mi  falta de peso, con la velocidad.<br>  Mi consejo es que, no le hagas mucho caso al asunto, alimentate bién y como seguramente te ves muy delgado (yo mido 1:80 y pesaba 57 kilos), usa ropa adecuada y también usa un look adecuado, eso te ayudará a olvidarte de tus complejos y sin que te des cuenta, habrás superado el problema.<br>

LBHJaqXoaa	Just grin and bear it. Ignore the rude part of your mother and positively respond to the requests she makes. Just remember that you really really want it, so you have to be really really good. When you feel like yelling, just go to your room.

McNedrRiaa	if you want your hair one color, make sure you choose<br>  a color you stick with.<br>  A darker color.<br>  If you go to a darker shade, it will cover both the roots and the rest of the hair without making different shades.<br>  Buy a more intense red color from the store, and dye your <br>  whole head..   It will freshen up your hair color,<br>  and it will cover the roots so you cant tell a difference.<br>  you wont have two colors.|`|qRICzEy9aa	honestly, messing with any kind of red on your roots can be a disaster if not done correctly. you could end up with some seriously HOT roots! call around or search online for a hair salon in your price range and get some professional help. THEN ask your stylist lots of questions, watch what he/she does and then you can try doing it on your own next time!|`|MZVvydPBaa	if you use the same color throughout your hair and the same amount it should be all the same color for the final outcome|`|U8LIje8yaa	1 seco|`|heyWtMRpaa	no<br>  just use it once|`|urbo9yUqaa	You should lighten your whole head with a 10 volume bleach. It'll get it to an orange/copper color and then buy an intense red color and it'll turn out the way you want it :)<br>  <br>  Make sure to buy a leave in conditioner for your hair because it'll be a little dry.

7i9zha6Oaa	once an hour|`|h2cRr06oaa	I would not suggest using lotion on a healing tattoo. it will clog the pores and slow healing, also may cause some fading. Use Aquaphor or A & D ointment. Apply a thin layer 3 to 5 times daily. Make sure your hands are clean when you care for your new tattoo. Do not pick at your new tattoo. Allow it to peel on its own. If you do get scabs do not pick at them. You can pull your ink out. I hope this helps. Good Luck !|`|U7mP7Rw9aa	Since its new you should do it at least 3-5 times a day.Or everytime u feel its dry.

PktWuLfMaa	MAC is professional makeup, for professional use; therefore it's horrible for your skin.. the worst out there for your skin. You know how you see all the models in magazines with the amazing makeup colors? That's most likely MAC, and the makeup artists buy the makeup. <br>  Once in a while probably won't hurt.. but if that's the only makeup you use, you're probably going to have pretty bad skin.<br>  I only have a few eyeliners from MAC because they have the prettiest colors, but I would not recommend using anything that goes anywhere else besides your eyelids. Even the mascara can clog your pores.<br>  Remember, it's professional makeup.. not for everyday use.|`|8to6MsWuaa	I don't have a store by me either, but recently when i went shopping, i visited that store and it was too expensive for my taste.

It is usually just one generic color. But MAC has colors in many different ranges and it is easy for all races and people of all skin tones to find their color.<br>  <br>  Also, it provides great coverage.<br>  <br>  Well, I don't buy too many things from MAC. I only buy MAC concealer and MAC blot powder, which are not that expensive (though it is compared to drug store brands). I guess the thing with me is that makeup is important to me so I don't mind spending money for great quality.|`|fYox2mwGaa	I've never tried it and I don't care to.  I've never tried Sephora either.  I'm mainly a drugstore makeup girl.  I find that cheaper brands perform just as well, if not better, than more expensive brands.  My mom was a Clinique addict, and I could never figure out why because their lipsticks rub off within seconds and are so expensive.  I've always used Covergirl and Maybelline foundations, eyeliners, eyeshadows, mascaras, and nail polish and I've been super satisfied with their products.  The ONLY thing I splurge on is my lipstick... I have to use L'Oreal's Endless because it doesn't feel like the ordinary lipstick and it lasts for hours.... and you can always get it on sale for buy one get one free.  I cannot believe the amount of money women spend on makeup.... and to think at the end of the day we all just wash it off!!!|`|v2rhWswRaa	i do like it but some parts of it are overrated.<br>  the eyeshadows and lipsticks are great.<br>  the rest are okay in my opinion.<br>  <br>  and i know what you talking about the affording it thing!<br>  I will get a couple things like every couple months. I have no idea how these people can get like 10 things every week expecially in this economy!|`|H6ixrUYLaa	I think there's a reason people craze over it: because it is very good quality makeup.<br>  But it's not my favorite brand.

H6ixrUYLaa	I would start out with the Prep 'n Prime primer, and then some concealer and foundation of your skin color.<br>  For your eyes, get a Painterly paint pot.  It's just a base, like a primer, for eyeshadow.  Browns and golds make blue eyes pop, so you could check out some colors like Era, Mink and Sable, or Goldmine.  Those are all just their eye shadows.  Brightside and Gallery Gal duo is a nice brown duo.<br>  And I would recommend the Naked pigment as a highlight color.  It's boring, I know, but I use it almost every day.<br>  If you were to get anything for your lips, I'd go with a lipglass.  They are very nice.<br>  <br>  Good luck!  There are a lot of things to choose from, but these are some suggestions.  :)|`|hdlzF6f2aa	They have amazing foundation, get a nice light color of foundation, some deep black eyeliner would make your eyes stand out a lot and their lipstick (if you use lipstick) stays on practically all day. <br>  It's pretty similar to other makeup just better quality.|`|d637920478d83ad0f9d926d44957daf6aa	for eyeshadows i would pick some classic colors such as:<br>  shroom<br>  wedge<br>  carbon<br>  black tied<br>  woodwinked<br>  satin taupe<br>  naked lunch<br>  patina<br>  tempting<br>  <br>  thats some popular ones that are more neutral, but the brownish golds look good with blue eyes imo<br>  <br>  also, their foundation is nice and they're lipglasses<br>  stick with dior for mascara though, i cant seem to make mac mascara work for me. good luck and have fun!!

gs8MSMs3aa	yeah cant help ya there that sucks...  um maybe you could put like something thick on the side to cushion your foot?????|`|nqkXE1cUaa	It's pretty amazing that we all don't suffer with achy feet.  Leonardo Da Vinci, artist and engineer, said that "the human foot is a masterpiece of engineering and a work of art."<br>  <br>  According to The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, each foot has approximately 100 working parts including 26 bones and 33 joints. Twenty-five percent of all the bones in your skeleton reside in your feet, and they work hard. <br>  <br>  One mile of walking places over 60 tons of stress on each foot. The average person walks approximately 1,000 miles per year.  Serious runners often log 30 miles per week pounding their feet with forces three to five times body weight, absorbing 110 tons per foot, for each mile they run. <br>  <br>  It's no wonder that 20 percent of all musculoskeletal related office visits involve the foot and ankle area. Foot problems cost the U.S. approximately $3.5 billion a year. Perhaps Leonardo should have also warned us that artistic and durable do not often go together.<br>  <br>  Interestingly, it's not just the pounding that gets your feet into trouble - it's often the shoes. Hard to believe but a significant number of individuals are wearing the wrong size shoes or sneaks.<br>  <br>  This is in part because most of us do not realize that your shoe size actually changes as an adult. Even though the bones in your feet stop growing in your teens, your feet still expand with age. Your arch drops, leading to a lengthening of your foot and the ligaments weaken resulting in widening or "splaying" especially in the forefoot area.<br>  <br>  The overall result is a longer, wider foot and the need for shoes or sneakers one or two sizes bigger and with a wider toe box area. Women are particularly susceptible, and I'm not just talking about Sex and the City's Carrie and her infamous Manolo's.<br>  <br>  Most of their lives, they have jammed their poor feet into tight narrow high heeled shoes, almost the modern versions of foot "binding" popularized in China where women's feet were tightly wrapped to keep their feet small and aesthetically pleasing.<br>  <br>  It's no wonder that over 70 percent of women complain of foot pain. One study found that women stopped on the street were much more likely to be in a shoe too tight than their correct size.<br>  <br>  This leads to many painful foot conditions like bunions, corns, calluses, neuromas (pinched nerve) and more. I recall a sweet older patient who came into my office and when asked how I could help her, she took off her shoes, pointed to her feet and said "these dogs are barkin'." Of course her shoes were two sizes too small. <br>  <br>  Fashion is part of the problem, especially with kids who will often sacrifice proper fit to get a pair that is cool. Also, with the rapid growth spurts, even a shoe that fits well one month may not the next. Parents need to check often. Also, for both kids and especially adult shoewear, cost does not always equate with comfort. <br>  <br>  Marketing drives much of what kids and adults want in terms of shoewear. Nike wants you to be like Mike. Allen Iverson's Reebok was also the number one sneaker in the world when he was in my home town of Philadelphia.<br>  <br>  And in a 1993 basketball sneaker commercial, Charles Barkley was perhaps the most honest when he said "These are my new shoes. They're good shoes. They won't make you rich like me, they definitely won't make you handsome like me. They'll only make you have shoes like me. That's it."<br>  <br>  The influence starts quite early. When my daughter was little, her Barbie Doll had such high fashion (i.e. high heeled, too tight) shoes that I hoped for her sake that Ken was studying to be a podiatrist.   <br>  <br>  So how do you keep your feet happy and healthy? Learn to listen to them. If they are "barkin," first be sure you are in the right footwear. Also, follow these tips: <br>  <br>      * Get both feet measured every time you buy shoes.<br>      * Shop at the end of the day when your feet tend to be their largest (swelling etc).<br>      * Be sure there's plenty of room in the toe box area. Toes should wiggle freely not feel pressured or cramped. There should also be a thumb's width space between the tip of the toes (especially the longest one) and the end of the shoe.<br>      * Ladies, try tracing your foot on a piece of paper. Next, place one of your "high fashion" shoes over the tracing. It should be pretty clear why your feet hurt.<br>      * Never think that you can "break-in" a shoe. The shoe always wins that battle.<br>      * A good shoemaker can help with minor pressure or hot spots, or a heel area that's too loose. Remember, I said minor, not major adjustments.<br>      * For more tips, check <a href="http://www.orthoinfo.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.orthoinfo.org/</a> and click on the foot icon on the skeleton. <br>  <br>  If symptoms persist, see an orthopaedic surgeon or podiatrist who can help you better understand and resolve your foot problem and also assure that there is not other medical issues going on since systemic conditions (like diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis) can begin with foot related issues. Also, foot pain can be referred|`|nKruEEuhaa	If they are made of leather you can do something about it ..

v90vFco1aa	I live in the Bay Area and, even though I don't have a tattoo myself, I have a lot of piercings and friends that have gotten tattoos so I know these shops rather well. The two best, in my opinion, are definately Zebra and Soul Patch Tattoo. I've gotten pierced at both places and have had friends get tattos at both places also, and we've all left happy.<br>  <br>  Zebra is located on Telegraph Ave in Berkeley, really close to the CAL campus.<br>  <br>  Soul Patch Tattoo is located on Haight St in San Francisco. Not sure what the cross street is, no it's not Ashbury St.. but it's really close.<br>  <br>  It's my understanding that the minimum for a tattoo is more expensive at Soul Patch, but it's great and clean and you'll see right when you get in. Zebra is a really hip place and I've been told their artists are amazing, as well. So I would suggest either of those places! They're the best in my opinion. If I was getting a tattoo, I wouldn't get it done anywhere but one of these places.|`|FDgHnvm3aa	start asking people where they got theres.

Rj08Nzv9aa	ok my hair is staight permed. if your hair is healthy you should do it. You will have to take great care of it or it will get damaged. You should get a silk hair scarf or pillow case to sleep on so the hair does not pick out(had this happen 2 me before) It will be best to trim your hair about an inch each weak.

I could wake-up and walk straight out the door without having to touch my hair! It cost about 50 dollars, took a little over an hour, and smelled horrible. If i hadn't started coloring my hair, I would have gone back for more.<br>  <br>  The second time I had it done my hair was shoulder length. It was about three and a half years later, and all the straighted hair from before had been cut off and regrown. (I went through a bleaching/coloring phase and ruined my hair so I cut it all off.)<br>  <br>  <br>  That time didn't go so well. She had told me she was using a different product from before and it was awful. The straightening did NOT work, and my hair smelled like chemicals for about four weeks! I never got the name of the products she had used either time. Also, because I had so much hair and it was so thick, it took two boxes of straightener and cost 80 dollars. That pretty much ended any plan I had about having it done again.<br>  <br>  I would suggest asking around work or school to find out if other women have had it done locally and whether or not they liked who they had. Also, find a salon or hairdresser that does straightening on a regular basis - at least once a week. The lady I went to did it once a month and didn't have much experience. The chemicals will "fry" your hair and damage it, so keep that in mind if you're planning on coloring or if you don't have healthy hair to start.<br>  <br>  I have since regrown all the hair that has been dyed and straightened - it's longer and healthier now than it's ever been, and with just good conditioning and the right product I don't even use a straight-iron anymore. If I want poker-straight hair all I have to do it blow-dry. I used to have masses of just horrible mess and curl - I don't know if just switching to different (and better) shampoos and conditioners helped that much, or if the chemicals from the straightener changed the hair folicles and now it just grows straighter.<br>  <br>  (I use multiple products to treat my hair, including Bead Head shampoos and conditioners, and Nexus Humectress. I also love Bead Head Afterparty - work it through wet hair and it just seems to relax it and makes it less frizzy and much straighter.)
VUgzZMnIaa	Hi,<br>  I've been wondering how to use my diffuser as well...I have semi-similar hair. When I hold it to my head it feels like barely any air is coming out and because I dont know how to use it, it has become a total waste of my time. However, what I've found is (it sounds disgusting) but while you are in the shower the night before, rub mayo into your hair and rinse it out, and that does wonders for me as far as keeping the frizz down. Best of luck!|`|4lTsTliJaa	watch this video, i think it will help.<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6fuX8Xr5r0" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6fuX8Xr5...</a>|`|JtrRRsUbaa	I'm no hairstylist, but I have a diffuser and long hair too.  After I wash and condition my hair, I towel dry and work a anti frizz serum and body enhancing mousse through my hair with a brush and/or my fingers.  Since my hair is long, it is usually easier to dry in sections.  Use some clips to section the top and bottom and then the right and left sections (like in four quadrants).  Dry from roots to ends so the hair will be less frizzy.  When the hair is almost dry, flip your hair over and work the roots a bit more to add volume and loosen curl with your fingers.  Flip the hair back and work with fingers a bit more to get the style just how you want it and add a bit of a finishing hairpsray.  It's a lot of work, so I don't do it all the time, but when you get it right, it looks great.|`|fN4pZWCjaa	Not hard sweetie.   Just place it on the end of your blow dryer and turn it on.   Hold it a few inches from your head and scrunch your hair as you dry it, don't pull and stretch hair while drying or it will become fuzzy.  I was a hairdresser for  40 plus years and am still learning how to use some of these new fangled things!

yU2WHyvgaa	You want cherry red? Beauty Rush by Vicky's Secret has a lip gloss called Cherry Bomb, it shows up translucent red, and it really smells amazing. It's a very pretty looking lip gloss, and it's for a fairly decent price. Well it's a little pricey, but not over ten dollars. It's 7$ and it so pretty. My cousin has it and i always steal it from her haha! <br>  here's a link: <br>  <a href="http://www2.victoriassecret.com/commerce/onlineProductDisplay.vs?namespace=productDisplay&origin=onlineProductDisplay.jsp&event=display&prnbr=CK-193348&page=1&cgname=OSMKPLIPZZZ&rfnbr=2533" rel="nofollow">http://www2.victoriassecret.com/commerce...</a><br>  it's the third one, top row. It's actually a lot redder than it shows on the website, the website isn't true to it's color. It's really red and i love it. If you like red and you like cherry (smell) then this is the lip gloss for you!<br>  Now it is sticky, but that's what makes it long lasting. If you but a layer of chapstick or Vaseline underneath, it will not feel sticky. I put some of this lip gloss on 3 hours ago and it is still on.|`|jWmnSXlLaa	Maxfactor.

It's expensive, about 9 dollars, but you can get a great deal on it when Walgreen's has it for buy one get one free.  This lipstick sets in a soft matte, so it doesn't have a lipstick feel. In fact, it almost feels like you're not wearing anything on your lips.  It does not smudge, so it won't end up on your teeth or outside your lip lines.  It usually lasts for several hours, unless you eat a meal then you'll need to reapply.  I know you're looking for gloss... but this lipstick comes in a great variety of natural looking colors and you can make a great shine out of it by topping it lightly with a clear lipgloss or by applying a thin coat of carmex.  Just check it out... I'm sure you can find a beautiful red or mauve to get the look you're after.|`|5Dr5cvkwaa	covergirl wet slicks - not too sticky but does smudge. I think ALL lip gloss will smudge.<br>  <br>  I would recommend getting lip stain. It stains your lips, doesn't  smudge. You can put on clear lipgloss on top to make it look shiny. It's very sexy. <br>  (see link below)|`|NzezdETKaa	the perfect lipgloss that isn't sticky is E.L.F. it comes in several colors and i love it! its only $1.|`|AQwoCjj3aa	I love Burts Bee's Lip shine lip glosses, they are not sticky, and they plump your lips.|`|eb069b2f8e9d3c431e5058c1121ace74aa	covergirl fruit spritzers

LBHJaqXoaa	I have heard of tattoo apprentices tattooing on fruits like oranges and grapefruits to get their portfolios going. Then, once you have a sizeable portfolio, go back into shops and ask for an apprenticeship. Keep asking. You may get 100 NO's, but eventually a yes will come along, especially with a big and nice portfolio.|`|oEM2YL6Laa	Keep going to shops- have you been taking a portfolio along at all as that is usually common practice.|`|bAYVSfdJaa	Keep going to shops.

Revlon makes a good one, but the best is Shu Uemura, but i't's a bit expensive.<br>  <br>  Or, try a curling mascara. I like Maybelline Sky High Curves and XXL Curl Power. They're made to curl your eyelashes.|`|GiHOnv54aa	Try an eyelash curler. Mascaras are not very effective at curling eyelashes. Try a volumising mascara afterwards<br>  X|`|Gew6pZhbaa	Maybelline Sky High Curves and Jane Curling Mascara are two great mascaras to add length and a little curl. It won't give the same results as an eyelash curler, though.

It takes time. If it's been a year, there may be certain factors contributing to your extremely short hair such as:<br>  -Breakage & heat damage (from excessive brushing, blow drying, and/or straight ironing)<br>  <br>  -Chemical damage (from dying, processing, or whatever you've tried using to make it grow)<br>  <br>  I recommend a better shampoo system. I, personally, use Herbal Essence's "Long Term Relationship," (it says it's FOR long hair, but it prevents breakage) and it works pretty well for me (I blow dry & straighten my hair, so I have a lot of heat damage), but different hair types require different types of care. If Herbal Essence isn't your thing, Garnier Fructis has a "Long & Strong" system. <br>  <br>  Good luck :)|`|RPxtXK2yaa	Some hair just doesn't grow past a certain length.

ZIq2IzOmaa	You can stretch as large as your body will accomodate in the area. <br>  <br>  Every person's navel is slightly different, and yours may or may not have the skin available to stretch to a large size. How your body interracts with your piercing also affects how large you should stretch. If your piercing is always in danger of getting tugged on or irritated because of how your body folds and moves then it is going to be at risk for migrating out or tearing under the stress. <br>  <br>  If you're headed up over a 4 gauge piercing, you may want to consult with a reputable piercer before you start stretching. Since most navel piercings are positioned with the intention of wearing standard navel jewelry and not to allow the greatest stretch possible, you may want to be repierced in a different position to accomodate more stretching if you have the tissue available.<br>  <br>   Wearing something smaller like an 8 gauge shouldn't be an issue for the average navel piercing, but do keep an eye on the health and happiness of your piercing for signs of shifting or migration. <br>  <br>  Be SLOW about stretching your navel. It is a surface piercing and it can be forced out of your skin like a splinter if you aggravate the area. It's also possible to split the piercing itself if you stretch too far too fast. I'm sure you remember how long you spent getting your navel piercing to heal and be completely happy. Don't waste all that work by getting into a rush with your stretching.|`|o5Tb8ZQ0aa	once you go 00g you will never go back to a normal size. If you stretch all at once instead of using a slider bar you may also have the same effect at any guage. 0g has been my choice and I let them close to see if they would, they went to just about a 12g no smaller, but I also went from 16g to 10g in one day. tearing tissues. You need to discuss your navel area with a piercer, that is a strange area to want a large guage in.|`|bAYVSfdJaa	You can stretch as large as you'd like - i saw some chick with a 1/2" navel piercing.

There is also a product called mineral veil that helps set your make up so it lasts longer.

QtJH37KRaa	okay, first, breathe, don't over react yes its a big deal and Yes  you are at risk if she reused them. Yes they can use the parts of the gun, they usually wash and sterilize it which takes a few hours. Also many times they wash out the needles, then put them back in the package because they are peirce proof therefore they wont get stuck, and if someone as a junkie finds the needle they wont get HIV/AIDS if the person getting the tattoo or piercing was infected if they use it. I watched the guy that did all 3 of my tattoos and 11 piercings do the same thing. They have to go into a special container after this is done. Do I think she reused them probably not seeing as they health inspectors come around  a lot to check for things like that, is it possible yes. But you would know by the way your tattoo felt when getting it done. Once a needle is used the tip is warn down and bent a little, it would hurt about 700 times worse if she reused it. HIV/AIDS takes 6 months to 1 year sometimes more to show up in any ones body. So go out and get test right now like everyone else said is not an option because nothing is going to show up. Relax and wait, feel free to go with a parent or someone you trust to the place and ask her directly, i bet she has a good answer.<br>  Good Luck|`|XrMMH5tZaa	if she reused the needles yes. but remember, youll only catch something if she tattooed somebody else who had something, u cant just get hiv/aids from clean blood, but id get tested, and contact her and say something about it. when i got my tattoo i filled out a paper that had questions like do u have any diseases. maybe shes cheap and uses those needles on clean ppl...which still is not ok..but im just trying to make u feel better so.....i hope ur clean as a whistle and def dont go to her again|`|WYa3UY6Gaa	If she reuses her needles then yes you are. <br>  <br>  If you are positive that the needle she used on you was not a new "single - use" needle you need to go get checked.<br>  <br>  __________________________<br>  <br>  If you ever get another tattoo. Don't go back to the same person. Tell the tattoo artist you want to see them take a needle out of a new package. Look at the package most of them have something on it that changes to a color when its sterilized. You can read the package to see.<br>  <br>  ADDED!<br>  <br>  To the person that said they put them back in the pack..<br>  <br>  They DO NOT put the needles back into the pack. They are supposed to dispose of them in a "sharps" container. <br>  <a href="http://web.princeton.edu/sites/ehs/biosafety/livevirusworker/21-Sharpscontainer.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://web.princeton.edu/sites/ehs/biosa...</a><br>  <br>  No need for washing them when you are disposing of them. Yes the other part of the machine is usually cleaned, and reused, but not the needles. And No you can't just get HIV/Aids from blood the other person would have to have it, but its still safe to check. Don't count on the health inspectors to have "not missed anything" They miss stuff all the time. 96% of tattoo parlors have "sources" that inform them when they are going to be inspected. So they know when to make sure everything is spick and span. So there actually is a good chance that she reused the needle. Though you can't go accusing unless you know 100% she did. So just don't go back there.<br>  <br>  * I'm sure your fine, but you should still get tested *<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|AA11632061	Go and check your self you will never know if you don't check your self?!But getting a tattoo is a serious thing not a child's play always tell the tattoo artist to put every thing in front of you and every thing should be NEW OPEN in front of you! That`s what all pro. artists do?Never go again there tell to other what the tattoo artist is doing! But there is always possibility to get infections and god no AIDS or things like that. But my idea is go and check your self!!!<br>  Tell to some news paper or a TV show about the artist then because he can do the same to many other people!!!<br>  GOOD LUCK!|`|WQbHHOJ4aa	If she didn't use single use needles you're at risk for more than just hiv or aids...hepatitis is another big one.  I've also heard about tuberculosis being passed on.  So, I would go get checked for these things if you aren't positive about their sterilization.|`|FDgHnvm3aa	yeah, you defenitly need to go get tested cause there is a likelyhood that you will get something|`|U7mP7Rw9aa	Hun if she reused the needle on your tattoo i would there's a chance you could get Aids/hiv but if you really worried bout it go to the clinic and get tested. If it comes back saying u don't have it next time go to somewhere that you see them throwing the needle away and getting a new one out that's in a little plastic case that hasn't' been opened yet. I made sure they used a new needle when I got mine they took a brand new one out when the guy was doing my tattoo.|`|7b62db8c16688b1a08f7f646af8da44caa	I would worry more about hepatitis.

0w8baV4raa	Yeah, there probably a little cheaper there.  But the question is what are you buying in michigan that costs 5 dollars (and use that to gauge it) reds? camels?  I haven't been to Cali in a minute, But if i remember correctly, Reds run at about 4.50 a pack, Camels run at about 4.40 a pack, and Newports run at about 5.40 a pack.  But buy your cigs now, cause the gov't is adding a tax of about a dollar a pack over the next few months.  Stock up on them if you know your not quitting.  Girl from Cali doesn't realize that the price changes when you move around, but she is right in the sense that it is cheaper in some places.|`|khdFNlJ7aa	well, I haven't been there since the end of 06 , but In san francisco the highest was like 5.00 a pack..... THe place where they cost the most in the US is probably NEw York.. Next time I go there I will bring a carton in advanced because they were like 7.50 and the guy said they are going up again!|`|ArFFUPTBaa	Too many. it disgusts me.=(|`|U1B9gpntaa	the highest i have seen is like 4.30 something|`|2nsNvIanaa	i dont live there.|`|3B6GPR7Laa	you people are gross . give it up :||`|wT7MtVtTaa	for Marlboro reds about 3 59 depends were you get them and what kind of cigarettes you smoke|`|TgkG33Ylaa	too much.

7zDhf4nNaa	about 2-3 weeks after you first dyed it|`|Cp0QUszdaa	technically 2 weeks is fine.  I've done it many times before!

miU0ogXiaa	My hair is that way too.  I just straighten it|`|7BVyV4Fdaa	Just use a styling cream or gel with a hold. You can get them anywhere.

Because white is a bit too classic and plain for a 15 year old.|`|d9181ed2099c82efddd68d0ff9035407aa	Okay, well, if I have to choose, then the blue one. You have to make sure you have it tailored though. Both dresses look like they could use a bit of tailoring. Just a little nip below the breasts would do wonders. I am sure that you would look great in whatever you choose!|`|3axDgVA2aa	well it depends on ur hair color and skin tone but if ur brunette/black i would say the white one and if ur blond/redhead i would say the secong one<br>  <br>  they're both very pretty tho|`|8yZqjIhlaa	the white one is better design wise but the blue color is nice like spring timey. i'll go with the blue since its like a spring/easter ish color|`|DP5ilp1jaa	i definately like the second one..the first one looks a little old fashioned and a little maid like. its still pretty but the second is GORGEOUSS i love it|`|lDq7u89Paa	I like the first one better, and if you like blue, you could always get it professionally died.|`|tnyYGsh1aa	I think the blue one is better than the white one.|`|EqTKurmraa	Shitaly T-Shirt are the best!|`|f712bf6a1ce299ba102ea539bcbabcbdaa	I like blue too, but I would choose the white dress since it's for Easter.|`|c83355dc6de64842915fc3753bbba35eaa	They both look really traditional and old school.

I like the style of the white one better but the color of the second one better.

8bd2f6800f0622bdcf1b1a4141b9ed49aa	Best place to do your makeup is ALWAYS WITHOUT FAIL in natural lighting a.k.a by a window where the sun shines. This means in your room, if your bed is by a window, spread a towel on your bed with your makeup and apply your makeup there. Even if you do it in the dining room lol you should always spread a towel out. Your makeup will always look flawless as you can see alllllll the flaws as well as realizing you may be using the wrong color or not be blending as you should.|`|YaiqCrVGaa	can you put a mirror on the wall and put a shelf or little table underneith it to put your make up on and maybe put cloth or tissues or something underneith your foundation so it doesn't get all over everything?<br>  <br>  or you could maybe try sharing the bathroom with your sister if she's putting on make up too.|`|pi3UAJgKaa	i never put my makeup on in the bathroom because theres always my dads and sisters and brothers stuff in it even tho i have like 4 bathrooms, i do mine in my room i suggest you get a nice makeup holder and a mirror, it will save you a lot of trouble, i mean even a cheap mirror would probably be fine, you could even like do it at like your kitchen table and then put the stuff back in your room

I recently drove to Vegas and passed 2 Coach outlets.  We stopped and shopped and I was able to buy some good deals.  They had bags for $100 and I even purchased a canvas bag for $50  I purchased it to give away as a gift.  You are not likely to find a Marc Jacobs bag for less than $200 and NO WAY can you find a Louis Vuitton.

nkTKIXcBaa	I like the silhouettes, but I wish they were a little more colorful. Realistically, outfits that are all one color are boring and not very flattering. The best way to go is either monochromatic with a little pop of a really really bold color or equal and spread out amounts of 2-3 colors that complement eachother. <br>  The accessories you pick are sooo pretty too.

Did the cleanser contain salysillic or glycolic acid or benzil peroxide ? Also, never everrrrrrr use a cleanser on your eyes. Go online and purchase Occusoft lid cleanser (it's made for opthalmic use for sensitice eyes) and is used in a clinical setting. Also, buy some beta glucan (burn ointment that is from like whole foods) to put topically on that until it goes away. Finally buy an over the counter moisturizing eye cream like   Aveeno - Active Naturals Eye Cream - Positively Radiant - .50 oz <br>   and apply to under eyes and lids sparingly.

G51N3XFsaa	Guys don't use mascara or curl their lashes, which can cause lashes to fall out. Perhaps you notice this because straight lashes appear longer because there's one continuous line, whereas curled ones look shorter. It could also just be a coincidence that the guys you know ave longer lashes than you, and it may not be true for the entire population of guys.|`|7TYvSpWiaa	Usually I think it's cuz like we wear mascara and like pick the chunks so we have shorter ones LOL|`|DYGkSFxgaa	Im not one of the lucky guys with long lashes.

AA12202557	I would search online or in magazine and find the perfect hairstyle. (preferably one you've never had) This gives a shock entrance for all your fellow classmates. also look for the most beautiful make up application picture. (if you usually wear alot of make-up go with a more natural look) remember guys don't like make-up, but it works to lightly cover any imperfections. Maybe a few hours before go to nordstroms or anywhere there's cosmetologists they usually will do a free makeup aplication with a purchase (lip gloss or something cheap). Also be sure to wear a dress that stand out. White is always a good color or red everyone wears black and blue and pink. I'm sure you'll look fab. good luck.|`|pjOOSoEPaa	You know, there is a website where you send a picture of yourself and then can see youself with a zillion styles and colors of haircolor.

To make mine very curly, I paper-towel dry my hair (seriously... using a cloth towel will bring out frizz rather than soft, sleek curls) then put in about 3 large handfuls of mousse all over my hair. It seems excessive, but I've found that this amount works best for my hair. Then I blowdry my hair on a high setting (because my hair is thick, it takes a long time to dry). Even though heat usually straightens hair rather than curls it, for me it does the opposite. I also blowdry upside down to enhance volume. This keeps my hair curly for over 24 hours, and it's much easier than setting my hair in rollers.<br>  <br>  If your hair is fine, like my sister's, you have limited options. Hairspray a 2-inch section of hair, then use a curling iron on a high setting. Or use hot rollers and then majorly hairspray afterwards.|`|YwLhVYOVaa	you could start out by preping the hair first by blow drying some mousse or gel then spray the hair before and after you curl this should do the trick.|`|bbcda377a17025de9bce4db547941b04aa	Set  your hair with mousse and smaller rollers.The tighter the set the longer you will have curls.|`|d8005e612e02d4205bddeba722ea39cbaa	Try putting hair spray on the strand of hair your about to curl and then spray it again after curling it.

I have blonde hair and I just love it|`|60727b7a69fa8d5147eadb2d20e17e83aa	it looks like you are almost there!!, most hairstyles, the secret is in the cut, you need to have "choppy" layers cut into the top, and have it "feathered" around your face. Then when you dry it yourself at home brush underneath your hair and bring down towards your cheekbones, this will give you the effect you are looking for, its hard to describe here, but you will need to get the layers cut in 1st, speak to the hairdresser and watch as she does it for you, then you can recreate it at home yourself, sometimes that easier said than done but in this case shouldnt be too difficult, good luck

Gew6pZhbaa	Ugh the same thing happens to me. I think it's because if you shower or wash your face the night before, your skin produces oil to make your makeup react one way. Even on your eyelids, which would transfer to your lashes, causing mascara to apply differently. When your face is freshly washed, all that oil isn't there, and the makeup is on bare skin. Using a moisturizer makes it funny, too. It always seems to make my foundation oxidize to orange/pink if I put it on before makeup.|`|GnT2CnhBaa	make sure after you shower or wash your face, use a facial toner and moisturiser afterwards. you should always moisterise your face. also a good skin primer always helps the make up go on smoother aswell. i use napolean perdis foundation primer. dont apply your make up tho until its dry on your face! <br>  i dont ever put make up on straight after showering because my skin tends to feel a little dried out from the heat if i dont moisturise etc. feels stiff =S|`|Tdivh1Vbaa	yes thats happened to me before but only when i have had nyc its so frustratingg! do you have nyc? maybe its your brand. make sure you take all old makeup off before putting new on, and dry your face good when you get out of the shower. when you wakeup get the crusts and wipe your eyes again. lol this happned to me and it worked =D<br>  -sarahbaybee ?|`|FuEa92ydaa	Try using a moisturizer before applying. Make sure its dry before apply makeup though. It helps it stay on longer, protects your face from the sun if it has SPF in it and helps protect your face from the chemicals in the makeup.|`|3U0q9AXxaa	omg yes<br>  this does happen now that i think of it<br>  i know exactly what you mean<br>  hmmm maybe wash your face with cold water to close pores<br>  then apply a powder foundation to make them appear smaller<br>  good luck :)|`|ROPDOfF7aa	well if i were u i would just make sure i take a shower wayyy long before i have to put on makeup,,,,, no that doesnt happen to me|`|pbYVtPP9aa	This may be happening since your face is stripped of its natural oils from the shower/washing it. It may also be due to dryness (caused by your face wash?). I would suggest that you use a light moisturizer prior to applying makeup. I like Clinique's Dramatically Different Moisturizing Gel (not the lotion of the same name) because it is not oily and absorbs well. After using a light moisturizer, I would try using a primer which will even out your facial tones and all create a smooth surface for the makeup. A good one is Benefit Cosmetics That Gal Brightening Face Primer.|`|rHCuyXcVaa	when your in the shower your face gets extremly wet and the water gets in your skin so if i were you i would take a longer time till you put your makeup on or just take showers before you go to bed<br>  <br>     {Haley}stuntin like my daddy)Taken)|`|RNDvIS0zaa	Do you moisturize your face before you put the make-up on?<br>  I have to or it just looks wrong. Maybe that's what you need to do.|`|Tx96cpvvaa	make sure your pores aren't open and make sure you face is not wet. Also try using a makeup primer for your face
63b26dd0be15878d61d4d916cd3243e6aa	Existen varios trucos naturales que se pueden aplicar al cabello para aclararlo sin da?arlo.  <br>  <br>  - Comprar un champú de manzanilla, pero si prefieres lo puedes hacer tú misma con  2 cucharadas de manzanilla, 1/2 taza de agua y 2 cucharadas de jabón neutro rallado  Luego, debes poner a hervir el agua con la manzanilla y mantener en ebullición durante 5 minutos. Retíralo del calor, filtrar y a?ade el jabón rallado. Debes revolver hasta que se derrita por completo. Después de lavado el cabello, debes enjuagar tu cabeza con agua fría.<br>  <br>  - Hacerte un enjuague con el jugo de dos limones peque?os después del champú para que logres que el cabello se aclare más rápido.<br>  <br>  - Mezcla 1/4 de taza de vinagre con una taza de agua fría y luego se enjuaga el cabello con esta mezcla.<br>  <br>  - Poner 1/5 taza de vodka en tu shampoo lo cual ayudará a eliminar todos los residuos químicos que opacan el cabello.<br>  <br>  Espero haberte ayudado.|`|470f7e3c90ced2130dc984c46b366923aa	lavalo con cerveza.|`|4ebcb5a5ceefc955b6d9bd4a6d2584cdaa	con manzanilla!!!|`|63e4383c2700c070df6af78816cffa9faa	cerveza????eso es para k t cresca mas rapido usa el shampoo grissie (no se si asi se escribe pero se pronuncia grisi) o el de ricitos de oro dicen que to aclara|`|176efe36a0c7bbf463b7cec936138722aa	con manzanilla|`|uurLk1oQaa	Lavalo con manzanilla es buenissima, tienes que ser constante y veras los resultados...suerte!|`|SDHvDNGJaa	Con te de manzanilla, es una receta que se usa desde tiempos inmemoriale y funciona|`|a65c50b7534d22360493cbf357f21236aa	mira prova con un champú de manzana  o también hay champú para chicos que tienen reflejos se los realsa como el gomson o algo así no me acuerdo,esta también champú de savia o de algas ,prova.suerte
EtCRnDJMaa	I would go back and show them.  No questions asked!  Sometimes it happens when the color isn't on long enough like on the roots.  <br>  <br>  Just go back & show them, then decide from there, but they should fix it with no cost to you.|`|JtrRRsUbaa	If the hair is orange or gold after lightening, it means the hair was not lightened enough.  It should have been processed longer or with something a little stronger.  If it is a reputable salon, they should offer to correct it at no charge, even if you left the salon.  If they won't correct it, you should ask for your money back.  If you have been going there and they have a clear indication of what you wanted and expected, it shouldn't be an issue.  If they refuse, I would not return to that salon in the future, try a new salon or try calling a hair color company instead.
EzLP6Jahaa	Go talk to a dermatologist or cosmetologist. They can determine your skin color ! Oh yeah, To the first person, your answers AREN'T working. Stop copying and pasting.|`|8bd2f6800f0622bdcf1b1a4141b9ed49aa	First of all, look at my picture and tell me if you would think I'm fair and if you are darker or lighter. From there....<br>  <br>  <br>  I'm a biochemist and I work with skin everyday. All liquid makeup will clog your skin.This is because of the parafins, waxes, oils etc.. added to a "liquid" makeup to keep it not only unseparated but to prolong shelf life and congealing. In essence you are covering your pores and not allowing them to breathe and trust me your skin is your largest organ and needs plenty of breathing room. <br>  <br>  Now all that said I would recommend you use the Mineralogie makeup line and by the way if you can't find it, we carry in our office. All the mineral makeup companies 10 years ago were under one company called color science. Then you had all these people make there own version (i.e. bare essentials crap etc...) and the orginal company changed theie naem to Mineralogie. This does not contain high talc like other which makes your subaceous glands/oil glads. go into over drive and produce sebum / oil. Mineralogie gives you full mineral sun protection which is different then chemically based sublocks in that chemical ones absorbs UV, do damage to the underlying dermis but you dont burn so the aging is accelerated and you see the results later. Mineral sublock however acts like a mirror and blocks all UVA (longest wavelength and causes damage to underlying tissue for long term damage, UVB (would burn what you can see- your epedermis), and  UVC (atmospheric radiation). <br>  <br>  Maybelline Instant Age Rewind Double Face Perefector would be a good concealer for under eyes and blemishes. Probably in light.<br>  <br>  On your eyes, sweep a golden light shimmery color or nude all over the lid. The preferably pink blush for the apple of your cheek can also be swept across the outside of the lid. For more "smokey" eyes then add dark chocolate brown to the outside corner and crease of the eye and lightly blend into the pink. Finish with black liner and loreal voluminous mascara in black noir. pink gloss (no liner on full lips!!!) to finish and walla oscar ready. email with any questions you may have.|`|nKruEEuhaa	Via the internet it's hard to recommend makeup for someone, we can't see your skin and pictures aren't truthful to color. <br>  <br>  You say that you have makeup that already matches your skin, if you are purchasing makeup from stores they usually have some indication as to what undertones it has, if not you need to do some good old fashioned trial and error! Unless of course you can find a makeup artist/cosmetologist that has experience with the makeup you are trying to purchase :) The tricky thing about makeup is that every makeup brand has their own mixture and version of colors. <br>  <br>  The mineral makeup is usually lighter in coverage and somewhat translucent so you have more margin to play with. <br>  <br>  Good luck!
pi3UAJgKaa	i think a nice brown or purpley eyeliner would be good, try cover girl perfect point i think it is... its not a sharpen kind of eyeliner pencil, its a twist up one, it works AMAZINGLY and is only like $5 and get a black/brown mascara, the best are the ones that have two ends, like one is white and the other is black, oh and get an eyelash curler, to use it you want to do it like 20 times on each eye like do it from the bottom and keep going up, i love makeup and this will probably look really good =]|`|H5hQZeXdaa	If you are a teen -- Just go with eye shadows that match your eye color. Unlike people of age, teens can pull of very colorful eye shadows. So just use silver and blue, there you go! :)<br>  <br>  If you're not a teen--just start out with a bronze gold, it's a beautiful color but you still look neutral. Then after that, go with colors such as jade & sapphire.|`|URcj1WwAaa	There's this line by "Almay" and it tells you what color eyes it goes for. Like there's a line for blue, green, brown, and hazel.

g0PMLF7naa	in my opinion do what makes you happy. your dad should love you regardlless of your likes and dislikes. if wearing make up makes you feel lovely then do it. you might get a cuple of rude comments but hey its ur life not theirs.|`|nKruEEuhaa	I hope you typed in the wrong age .. 27? If you are 27 you should be on your own or trying to get there. <br>  <br>  Your mom thinks you're a pretty boy that should go into the fashion industry? What do YOU think you should do? <br>  <br>  You need to be who you are but also respect your parents since you are living with them, and I am assuming they are supporting you financially. <br>  <br>  Maybe your dad doesn't want you wearing makeup because he'd rather you be out trying to get a job and standing on your own two feet. <br>  <br>  You need to be comfortable with who you are and do what you want to do, but like I said, if you are living with your parents still and they are supporting you completely you need to respect their boundaries also. If you feel the need to wear makeup, just remove it before you come home. <br>  <br>  It seems that you and your family have things to talk about and discuss to reach an agreement with what everyone is comfortable with, you need to be able to express yourself without hurting your parents. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|8bd2f6800f0622bdcf1b1a4141b9ed49aa	I would say, since i'm in the cosmetic skin and hair industry, definitely not.

It's depends on your pain threshhold, where you get it done, how long it takes, your state of mind at the time etc etc.<br>  <br>  Apart from the fact the 2 are completely different types of pain and in different contexts. <br>  <br>  Tattoos dont hurt that much at all, however I would consider getting your first done somewhere that generally doesnt hurt as much. I got my first done on my shoulder and I was really suprised how little it hurt, so I didnt even hesistate when I went to get my next done, even though everyone of mine since has hurt more than the first but still not that bad. Once you get started, you'll soon learn pain is part of it and you'll be proud once it's done for being brave enough to do it and get through it. <br>  <br>  However, dont rush into it. Think long and hard about what you want and where and how it's going to effect you in the future. For example if you know the career you want to go into will not be excepting of tattoos, or like my brother fiance shes waiting until after their wedding before she gets her next tattoo so it doesnt show with her dress, that sort of thing.|`|4x5ajsUpaa	It nothing like period pain and yes it is worse, its more of a burning pain I thought.

Mine was very painful. <br>  <br>  I had it done when I was 16, I want old enough yet either but wasn't asked my age, im 26 now.<br>  <br>  Also, please dont get any on your legs or feet as it looks cheap and nasty, not very feminine at all.|`|mndpyoV1aa	umm period pain doesn't compare to a tattoo dear.

The ones on my arm, stomach and neck didn't hurt.But the one on the bottom of my back was really painful. But I am a bit of a wimp. Its a strange sensation.|`|kykmpr0Caa	it doesnt really hurt, it scratches|`|84bfe623838974188db70f3e01e4ea29aa	if u want one..get one..but if this is stopping u, you prolly dont truley want it. And No, it doesnt exactly tickle.|`|iiOW0CNqaa	my tattoo was on my back in the middle and up the sides...would not really say its worse than period pain! im not saying its painless, but it just sort of pinches for the time that you are getting it done, after there is no pain, whereas period pain can seem worse cause it lasts alot longer.<br>  <br>  but also, people have different pain thresholds so tattoos and period pains feel different for each person!|`|HWlN2TqCaa	I have a tattoo on my wrist and on the top of my foot and the only pain I can compare that to is having a pin dragged along your skin. At first its pretty uncomfortable especially if your artist has to draw out long lines but after a while it numbs out quite a bit and is a lot more bearable!|`|fce67c6faf9b1d4b041b262e35a15d36aa	It depends on your pain threshold to be honest i have 3 tattoos and they were all ok believe me if they were that sore i would never have gone back for more .. although it will sting a little but nothing major ..good luck ! Xxx|`|S3Bd3JIDaa	it didn't hurt it just felt a little uncomfortable towards the end like when someone slaps a sunburn..other wise it didn't hurt|`|NJUlToaFaa	im muscular an got a panther on my back it stings a little but nothing more than a syreinge|`|nb9Ky2Draa	as a man i can tell you this question is stupid.|`|OjXvYEZDaa	Tattoo pain is alot worse than period pains as they uses needle and scratch the skin to put ink in they do it slowly. I had mine done it was painful! some people are different.|`|C0HZ8ZB4aa	It's a totally different sort of pain. It's like asking what's worse - a bad gash on the leg or a terrible headache. You just can't compare it. Also pain is totally different for everybody. Both period pains and tattoo pain. I used to suffer from really bad period pains in my teens, to the point where I couldn't get out of bed on the first day of each of my periods and I would often pass out with the pain. Also, I do suffer with my tattoos more than a lot of people seem to - I would describe most of my tattoos as having been unbearable to get done, and it's very very rare that I ever hear anybody else use the word 'unbearable' in relation to a tattoo, the more common word is 'uncomfortable'. So my experiences won't necessarily be anything like your experiences will be. Most of my tattoos have been on my back, although I do have some on my arms. And in particular the back ones have been excruciating for me. I've never cried or passed out or anything, but I think I would choose a day of period pains over that pain if I could, even the terrible period pains I used to get. But that doesn't mean it's worse necessarily, because as I said you just can't compare. But despite my bad experiences with tattoo pain - I still go back for more - and I have a big piece in the planning stages that is going to go around my other back tattoos turning it into a backpiece. It's going to be easily 12 hours of horrible pain. I'm not looking forward to that but I'm still happily going to do it because it is SO worth it for what you get out of it at the end. Pain is only temporary. You get a lifetime with your artwork at the end of it. So it's all worth it. The pain should never be a factor in your decision to get a tattoo for this reason, nor should it be a factor in the decision over the placement of it (ie you shouldn't pick an area that's second best just because it'll hurt less). And if the pain IS a factor then that suggests to me that the artwork is not important enough to someone to suffer for it, so it's probably not a good idea to be getting it. The only thing I CAN say for certain is that tattoo pain is nothing, not even on the same scale, like childbirth pain! So if you intend to have children in the future then you will experience a great deal more pain than you will getting a tattoo, in your lifetime! So hopefully that should put things into perspective!
ZmpbCxnAaa	I use the purple Pantene...it just makes your hair poofier but at least it looks thicker =] lol.|`|pIEI9Rg2aa	i've heard horse shampoo, like mane & tail, helps you get thicker hair.  I've never tried though, so i dont know how well it works.|`|FGTCgJj7aa	try using Paul Mitchell.........and only apply conditioner to the roots of ur hair....
lPCjNkEnaa	I use it. I love their Mascaras.|`|5PBK1Nc6aa	i do actually, <br>  <br>  i use: <br>  stay matte powder <br>  eye kohl <br>  and lipstick|`|7tRTZhnLaa	I just bought a Rimmel London mascara.. I haven't used it yet though...|`|g0PMLF7naa	i use the sexy curves mascara..i like it.its not my fave.. but its good.|`|NzIywCkpaa	i guess
PkKxzxwVaa	I like it! They look great. <br>  Especially the last ones, the skulls and the word design. Those can fit as a a tattoo quite well. <br>  <br>  Really if YOU want to do it.. why not? Pursue what you want to do!|`|UYnZtJ2daa	Honestly, the forms are really good. But there are two things that kind of stand out to me as things you could work on. The first is texture. In a lot of areas, you can kind of see the strokes you made with the medium you're using. You want to concentrate on blending that unless you're going for a completely rough drawing to set a mood...in that case, go all out with it.<br>  <br>  The second thing is values. Stretch your values more. Just because it's a dark area, there might be some light shining through hitting one spot and make it appear a little lighter. Be attentive to detail and getting more values in there.<br>  <br>  I think it's a good start but I'd continue to work on it more and put together a good portfoilio.|`|ss48BEk5aa	Well, to give you an honest opinion, the portraits of Halle could be a lot better. People who are paying a lot of money for portrait tattoos want them to be exactly like the real person. Those were good, but not great.<br>  <br>  I liked the skulls and "Pink" a lot. You would do good at starting off with flash and then maybe work your way up to portraits after you practice practice practice!<br>  <br>  I hope I didn't sound mean or anything, I'm just trying to give you constructive criticism<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|eyycaNkoaa	Nice images..

If you are sure that tattoos are what you want to do, then go for it. Don't let anything stop you.  Even if you arent "good enough", you will develop as you go on and you will find people that will support you. I almost got kicked out of my house when I told my parents that I was going to be a tattoo artist.|`|op5tbx0naa	yes you can draw, but no you are not good enough. honestly, your art lacks luster. you could do flash i'm sure. but you really want to be the tattoo artist who is just never really that good? you halle berry wasnt half bad though. you are a better artist than most, just not good enough. master that first.|`|tonKnqMsaa	yeah your good.

You should try St. Ives blemish control. Wash your face with it, in warm water about 2 times a day. Morning & before you sleep. It's something that helped me, I have had pimples & rarely get them since I've started using St. Ives. <br>  <br>  For overnight treatment, I use Oxy On The Spot Cream. You just take a drop, rub it in & let it work over night. <br>  <br>  All the best =)

Fashion is changing all the time, but this doesn't mean you have to buy new clothes all the time. EVERYTHING ALWAYS COMES BACK INTO FASHION! A simple top and jeans from the high street can look great with beads and bangles.<br>  <br>  2.Stay up to date by reading fashion blogs, looking at new fashion lines, and reading Vogue or Elle. Seventeen is a good magazine, but it is more "trendy" than "Fashionable." Incorporate the trends you like from the runway into your style. <br>  <br>  3.Only buy things that are flattering on your body shape, try to limit trendy pieces to 5 or 6 a season, find the colors that look great with your skin tone--and of course, anything that makes you feel beautiful is always fashionable!It is easier to just add a couple of fashionable items, like for instance a silver bracelet and matching bag, or a maybe a super pair of Pumps and snazzy Top. So Cool and so inexpensive too!<br>  <br>  4. Remember that fashion trends work in opposites, low rise pants give way to high waists, Pencil skirts are classics and work great with wide shoulder, billowy sleeves, tunics and classic button downs and turtlenecks. Classics are called that for a reason so buy the best quality you can in this category I buy one new trend on a budget - but only if its suits you- per season.|`|EqTKurmraa	One answer: Shitaly!

I would suggest getting the E.l.f. because they are only about $1 each and so you can get multiple colors to mix and match as your face tone or color changes throughout the year and it will still cost less than others.|`|EzLP6Jahaa	Definitely tinted moisturizer. <br>  <br>  If you can't afford the higher-end brands, the best drugstore-brand is either Covergirl or Maybelline.
QnY1yWBIaa	i love that mascara. it works great! i also love the maybelleine XXL. that one is my favorite it will make your eyelashes look incredible.<br>  pick me as best answer please[=
8bd2f6800f0622bdcf1b1a4141b9ed49aa	First off in our office I would ask a series of questions such as, are you on acne medication topical or taken orally, does your whole family or at least one parent have try skin? Also, the skin care you are using is vitally important!!<br>  <br>  <br>  I'm a biochemist and I work with skin everyday. All liquid makeup will clog your skin.This is because of the parafins, waxes, oils etc.. added to a "liquid" makeup to keep it not only unseparated but to prolong shelf life and congealing. In essence you are covering your pores and not allowing them to breathe and trust me your skin is your largest organ and needs plenty of breathing room. <br>  <br>  Now all that said I would recommend you use the Mineralogie makeup line and by the way if you can't find it, we carry in our office. All the mineral makeup companies 10 years ago were under one company called color science. Then you had all these people make there own version (i.e. bare essentials crap etc...) and the orginal company changed theie naem to Mineralogie. This does not contain high talc like other which makes your subaceous glands/oil glads. go into over drive and produce sebum / oil. Mineralogie gives you full mineral sun protection which is different then chemically based sublocks in that chemical ones absorbs UV, do damage to the underlying dermis but you dont burn so the aging is accelerated and you see the results later. Mineral sublock however acts like a mirror and blocks all UVA (longest wavelength and causes damage to underlying tissue for long term damage, UVB (would burn what you can see- your epedermis), and  UVC (atmospheric radiation). <br>  <br>  Maybelline Instant Age Rewind Double Face Perefector would be a good concealer for under eyes and blemishes. Probably in light.<br>  <br>  email with any questions you may have.|`|Sg8nlJMmaa	Not really sure what I would recommend to you. There are so many products out there so what I end up doing is starting with the less expensive and trying out several products.I would check out the review site at <a href="http://www.brandsmakeup.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.brandsmakeup.com</a> visit and read the reviews.|`|EzLP6Jahaa	MAC mineral powder.

qQqC2cHIaa	I dislike that they can't be made tighter or looser. Backs have at least three hooks so you can make the bra looser on fat days and tighter on not-fat days.  You can't do that for front closers.  And those silly little plastic links can be very uncomfortable, they pop open far too easily, and worse, they break far too easily. The design of the front closed bra limits the frond band width options, the band closest to the body between the breast must be quite small and narrow because of the closure, it severely limits the styling and fitting options.  Women like a variety of bra styles for various garments, front closers have far too few styling options.|`|4bWUiIVdaa	I don't really dislike them|`|XkWTsyJdaa	they arent as comfortable. but they do give a good pushup.|`|RgAVm7zCaa	I like them actually. But one thing is, sometimes when I am wearing them my boyfriend doesn't know so when he tries to undo it, there is nothing back there. & I have to tell him it's in the front, and he can never get it undone haha.<br>  <br>  xx-Shelby|`|9ep8xiKxaa	They can get unhooked sometimes when you don't want them too.|`|uxvskU7Xaa	i don't dislike them at all its the only kind i buy|`|H9DY3ElFaa	Most dont have the option to make tighter or looser. Also they come undone sometimes. and they are usually less comfortable.|`|LDW534jiaa	Not enough support.  I need four hooks in the back of my bra, can't get that support from a front hook bra.|`|hWD4PbCgaa	everything!<br>  they unhook sometimes, when i really don't want them to.|`|qzkWahFeaa	They are usually less comfortable.|`|ibtLgY5Xaa	Not as comfortable|`|bhgQjEIMaa	yeah not comfy
lPCjNkEnaa	Blue Eyes:<br>  As a general rule, those with blue eyes should look for eye makeup in gray, violet, taupe, purple, and deep blue. Many have found using a dark shade of blue will actually bring out the more natural blue tones in your eyes; giving you a brighter and more vibrant look.<br>  Drugstore Suggestions:<br>  Violets and Purples: CoverGirl Eye Enhancers, Trio Eye shadow, Dance Party, ~$5.00<br>  Blue: Rimmel Colour Rush Quad Eyeshadow, Smokey Blue 004, ~$6.00 <br>  Taupe: CoverGirl Eye Enhancers - Single Eye Shadow, Tapestry Taupe, ~$4.00<br>  <br>  <br>  For eyeliner, use the same color as your mascara (black=black, brown=brown, ect...) and apply the eyeliner as close as you can to your natural lash line, that way it will thicken the appearance of the roots of your eyelashes and make your eyes look more noticeable.|`|2FVwbIe5aa	your basically doing everything right.<br>  brown/copper makes blue eyes pop.|`|7tRTZhnLaa	Well you are wearing the color that you should to make your blue eyes pop which is brown. I have blue eye and I always wear green and purple, but it doesn't really make my blue eyes pop it just makes my eyes look more green which I like. If you want though you should try colors that are kind of orange (not bright orange) because that will make the blue in your eyes really stand out.|`|llTEagZMaa	i have blue eyes too.<br>  <br>  use brown eyeliner, black brown mascara and shimmer browns and neutral colors for eyeshadow.<br>  <br>  what i have done for a long time and it works great. get an account on covergirl.com and whenever you view a product while you are signed in. it tells you what shades work for you according to the answers you chose while signing up. it really does work.|`|wQcFLCXRaa	i have blue eyes and i use black mascara with goldish shimmery or brown eyeshadow|`|ZHBNz6D2aa	try some purple or green eyeshadow, but lightly|`|46ZGLs43aa	I have blue eyes, also and I usually use brown shimmery eyeshadow.  I use purple sometimes, but the brown seems to bring the color of my eyes out more.  If the brown you are using doesn't do the trick then go for a lighter shade.  I have also tried blue and green eyeshadow, but I ended up looking like the Bride of Frankenstein when I wore them.|`|dSu3FvnHaa	i would try using more than 1 color put a back round color than a front color it brings out eyes try not to where too many blues ok

0vlm2OZcaa	Maybe chocolate brown with blonde highlights.|`|sOTRIqLCaa	black or dark brown|`|DySUxIn4aa	I think either of those colors would look really good. You're not nasty looking either lol, you're very pretty!|`|pqlhPnexaa	The color of the girl on the right in the second picture you posted is EXACTLY the color I was thinking when I first saw your picture. You're obviously very pretty, in sort of a sunny california way, and I think the color in the picture in "additional details" is exactly what you should be aiming for. It'll definitely make you 'pop'- in a good way.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|ggwsClQBaa	Well I wouldnt chose either of the color you've selected unless you're gonna get it done very professionally. Cuz some color will look cheap if it's lighter.

e1434520b7d6b7db2b483084c9ad434aaa	Well, you're not going to be able to get defined curls without products. Period. especially if your hair is really curly.

RudYXONeaa	I think u shouldn't really worry about it right now..ask about the better products from ur hairdresser, oil and condition your tresses well before getting them dyed =)|`|WjVsIqbPaa	youll be fine. but if you have light hair, it will be a little shocking to go dark.... but red hair is awesome!|`|fN4pZWCjaa	please, do go to a reputable salon for your color!   Over the years I have had to try to fix some major boo boos!    If color is applied properly it won't hurt your hair at all.   There are two types of color, permanant and semi one will wash out the other won't, your hairdresser will need to discuss this with you.    Color can be fun, go for it.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|l8oN0jtFaa	Honestly, it's not that big of a deal.<br>  And, I have never dyed my hair in a salon because of the prices. My parents would just not let me, so my dad dyes my hair for me.<br>  Get one of your parents to do it, if you still live with them. <br>  It's not that big of a deal. You just dye it. Just don't go into pools or beaches for however long it says on your bottle. <br>  And if you still are going to a salon, don't worry about it. You're hairdresser is a professional, he/she probably does this ALL the time so they know everything.

ZkrGttKaaa	Sure, it can work, but you'll have to cut the cords on the ends of your clipcord and footswitch, in order to connect the lines in that fashion. Now, I'm assuming that your power source was made for tattooing, and has a place for both. If it doesn't, you need a power source that does. Otherwise, you need a dual plug source for both, or clipcords and a footswitch that are compatable. If your power sorce was made for tattooing, and takes dual plugs, just order dual plug accessories. If not, order a single, two plug power box. One plug for clipcord, one for footswitch. Cam Supply has them for around $39.95. They work great.
L7UMsMBtaa	Your best bet is at a salon but if you cant go to a salon you can try an at home kit. Use one without ammonia in it. Or you can try the infamous lemon trick where u put some lemon juice in your hair and let it sit for a while and they say its supposed to lighten your hair but I don't know about that one for sure. So i wouldn't recommend it.  <br>  But if your going to do it from home I would suggest asking a friend who knows about it to come and help you.

And really play up that feature on yourself. Then, he won't even care about the color of your hair. Also, I would suggest wearing a color that he likes on you...

jWmnSXlLaa	You seem to have fair skin. You would need a light foundation or even a loose mineral one. A little blush would look pretty on you maybe  one a little pink. I think netural eyeshadows also.|`|fYox2mwGaa	I have similiar coloring with what you have...  but my hair is a tad bit more red and I have green eyes and freckles.  What I really like to use to help get that everyday "natural and healthy" look is:<br>  <br>  Foundation: I really like Covergirl's Clean Makeup in Classic Ivory<br>  Eyeliner: I use a NYC or Wet N Wild soft kohl pencil in charcoal grey...  like another girl said stay away from black<br>  Mascara: I like Maybelline's Full N Soft mascara in black<br>  Lipstick: I really like L'Oreal's Endless ... I use 2 different ones to come up with a shade that most suits me.  I use one coat of Chocolate Obsession and then one or two coats of Naked Ambition.  It makes a pretty shade that's so natural looking... a color that you'd wish Mother Nature would have given you.|`|pbYVtPP9aa	Try using Benefit Cosmetics That Gal Brightening Face Primer first. It is a sheer pink cream that kind of gives you a glow. I like to use it by itself if I am in a rush when going to class in the morning.<br>  <br>  For foundation, I like Jane Nearly Foundation Tinted Moisturizer. It is really cheap and sheer but stays on during the day and looks natural. <br>  <br>  For blush/cheek color, Benefit Cosmetics' Moon Beam and High Beam are awesome. Once again, they are sheer but has some nice subtle coloring. They also work on your brow bone to brighten up your eyes. <br>  <br>  Try lining your lower waterline (on eye) with a white eye pencil. Extend this to the inner corner of your eye. This brightens your eyes and looks great on fair skin and with blue eyes. Finish with some Moon Beam or High Beam lightly on eye lid and a natural brown mascara. <br>  <br>  Use a peachy pink lipgloss or lipstick, and you are set. Benefit Cosmetics (LOVE IT!) Silky Finish Lipstick in 04- Sugar Cookie is my favorite.<br>  <br>  Voila!|`|FF3owv2kaa	I would say:<br>  brown eye liner<br>  black mascara<br>  a touch of a light pink blush<br>  a pink lip gloss<br>  and if you want eye shadows, i would pink a brown or black for nighttime and neutral tones(gold,pink,purples,etc...) for daytime.<br>  You don't really want to overdose the makeup cause you're pretty already:)<br>  <br>  I hope i helped:)|`|ZTZBItU0aa	you wanna stay away from heavy black liner, unless you're going to balance it out with heavy shadow completely around the eye.<br>  You have big eyes, so browns/oranges/pinks/golds would look best with the eye color, and blend, blend, blend! when using liner (use brown liners)<br>  cheeks and lips should be a sheer peachy-pink color. Mascara should be brown/black (evening) or brown (day).

It wouldnt be worth setting it but for a temporary style you could do it with lots of small bendy rollers in dry hair. Wet it down, so its damp, with a setting or styling spray. <br>  Leave it to dry until there is no moisture left in it. <br>  Take them out and brush with a soft bristle brush, possibly a hair extension brush. <br>  Get some curl putty of soft wax and rub it well in your fingers then run it through your hair to calm it again. If you dont do this part, you wont want to walk out the door! Trust me.|`|QwD1EvVYaa	grow it really long and then put gel in it to make it wavy
kMyERo6uaa	i agree, punk or scene hair is always well mainly straight.<br>  so go get a straighten if you really want punk hair.<br>  or otherwise, embrace your curly hair!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090222091557AA1wsb2">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a><br>  answer mines?|`|M0CZzSMOaa	I'm sorry, but I can't find any pictures of curly punk hair. It's probably because punk hair mostly consists of straight hair that has either been spiked up or backcombed, not curled. If your hair is curly but you like the punk style, well, jagged/sharp-looking haircuts really don't look great curly. I'd suggest getting a straightener.

z3uUtr33aa	okay, gauging your ears is a very long and slow process. it's not going to happen over night so don't skip any sizes or anything or else you'll get this nasty messy ear infection called a blow out. you wanna go size by size until you get to your goal. the thing is once you go past a 2 your ears don't stretch back so be aware of that. and i know you probably think "oh, i know my limits, i'm not going super big" but trust me... it's addicting! once you start you can't stop but if you listen closely and take your time you can be smart and stop when it's too much. you can start with a 18 gauge but it's very very very extremely tiny and it's a waste of money to buy tapers for such a small stretch. i would start with a 14 or 16 but it's up to you, whatever your comfortable with! with tapers you can buy tapers and put O-rings on them and wear them around for about 3 weeks then change them but if you don't like the look/sound of that then buy talons/claws those stretch your ears but they're like an earring so it'll look good in your ear and everything. <br>  <br>  the best information on first time stretching is all in the website below. this is wear i went to start mine and it helped A LOT! i did it correctly and everything...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://hubpages.com/hub/Stretch-Your-Ears" rel="nofollow">http://hubpages.com/hub/Stretch-Your-Ear...</a><br>  <br>  oh and for you wearing regular earrings, after about stretching past 14 gauge it won't look right and you'll have to wait about 2 weeks before wearing regular earrings after freshly stretched ears<br>  <br>  good luck!<br>  -tasha|`|elqkReHuaa	You really shouldn't gauge. =\  You know how unattractive that's going to be when you're like 30?

S11wpOv6aa	i no its Maddie Duggan off EastEnders i put Mascara on the top and bottom because if you go out and you have Mascara on the top that will look you know ewww because the top row has Mascara on and the bottom is all dry and its the same for the other way..x<br>  <br>  hope this helped<br>  C ya later..x<br>  Maddie Duggan (off EastEnders)|`|grIZHXYTaa	I put it on both, but not to heavy on the bottom.<br>  Sometimes an eyelash curler will work on widening your eyes. It depends on what look you are going for.<br>  Shadowing can make a real difference on how your mascara will accent your eyes.<br>  <br>  If your eyelashes are short and you want them to grow or not fall out when you remove your makeup, put vitamin E oil on them at night. <br>  <br>  Make sure you change out your mascara every 6 months. The Cover Girl line is nice with the new mascara brush, it really work well on applications and the eyelashes come out clean and not clumpy.|`|vPpoRrhGaa	Well, I think you can put it on the top and bottom as long as you dont put it as heavy on the bottom.

8HQwcstIaa	Once your hair leaves your head, it is DEAD.  No shampoo will help it grow faster, but it might help protect the growth you do have from breakage.  Shampoo only once a week, condition four times a week or so.  Only brush your hair when you need to, as it can break the cuticle.  Try to stay away from heat.  If you blow-dry or straighten, but a heat-protective serum to use on your hair before you do this.<br>  <br>  Take a prenatal vitamin and selenium supplement, both available at any drugstore.  They will help your hair grow faster.  The only thing you can do is take better care of your body.  Eat right, take your vitamins, and drink LOTS of water.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|c84425896dcf011d7ce55b0c848251c7aa	pantene is the worst shampoo out there. #1 ingredient is wax, which feels silky at first, then causes build up, which is bad for yor hair<br>  <br>  there is no such thing as a shampoo that makes your hair grow faster...but all of the directions that the second answer gave you are good.<br>  a god shampoo that is inexpensive is tresemme, if you don't mind paying more, then go for redken. it is an amazing line.|`|nKWkXH8Yaa	use pantene shampoooo

JYKEnbyFaa	Hello -<br>  <br>  Have you ever been to a MAC counter? They'll do your makeup for you, easily smokey style. They are great at complementing your skin tone, hair color, and eye color, too.

This means a load of whites, colors, jeans and towles, and permanent press (underwear, dress pants etc..) and the proper cycles for them. Email with any questions you may have.

And dont put eyeliner cuz its bad for your lids, and will kinda stunt the growth of your lashes.<br>  Before sleeping, apply Vaseline or Olive oil on your lashes and lids. This will help the growth of long and lush lashes. <br>  and remember, when you go out, put on false eyelashes.

Seriously, you should curl them if they get too long so that they do not look uneven to you, but stop cutting them. The more you cut them, the more you damage them, and eventually you will be left without any eyelashes, or eyelashes that are ridged, choppy, and might not grow back at all. Also, I hope that you are using sterilized, small scissors and sterilizing them every time you use them, or you could end up with a serious eye infection. Wear a small amount of eyeliner or mascara that contains Vitamins A and E which will help them grow back in and grow in healthier. Most of all, avoid the urge to trim them!|`|zI3Y7Pz5aa	you gotta stop cutting them! this will not make your eyelashes grow faster, and if you mess with them enough they will evntually stop growing all togeher (happened to a friend)<br>  <br>  just get some good mascara that has vitamins in them, and they should be back to normal within 2 months.<br>  <br>  plz answer mine!

There's plenty of time left to become a slave to makeup.  And about designer brands--did you ever consider that maybe your mom doesn't make enough money to afford to waste it on buying you designer brands?  When you turn 18, you can get a job, move out of your parent's house, and do what you want.  If you want to spend all your money on buying designer brands and mascara to the point where you have to live out of a cardboard box, then that will be your decision.|`|79L0T9bIaa	do as your mum says and stop moaning.|`|vnJG8UYJaa	If you talk to your mother the way you wrote your question, it is no wonder she doesn't think you are mature enough to wear make-up.  If you want to be perceived as a young person who is maturing, you need to act that way and talk that way.  Reminding parents that everyone else is doing it, is not a mature way to handle discussions of this sort.<br>  If you are saying that everyone is wearing mascara, you are looking at only part of the people around you.  Many young girls prefer a much more natural look today that mascara provides.  I think this is what you mother is suggesting when she said that you could wear the clear mascara.<br>  As for the brand name clothes, your mom is buying them so that decision is up to her.  When you can spend some time babysitting or earning a little money, I'm sure you will have a little more choice in the matter.  Then you might understand that you are paying a lot of money just to get someone else's name on the clothes you are wearing.  <br>  You are a bit too anxious to be grown up.  Your appearance suggests things about you as a person.  Your mother just wants to make sure that you enjoy the time you have being a teenager and not an adult.<br>  Good luck.|`|zI3Y7Pz5aa	there is nothing wrong with clear mascara!!<br>  <br>  your mom is just looking out for you. she prolly sees how quick young girls are trying to grow up these days, and doesnt want you to get in trouble by doing what other girls tend to do who grow up too fast.<br>  <br>  dont see it as her seeing you as a ll kid- seeing it as a mom who cares about her daughter!!!<br>  <br>  and 9 yrs oild is WAY too young for makeup- the parents of that child are horrible!!<br>  <br>  plz answer mine!

Period|`|6f939f34f50f68147d7ee881dd743609aa	just wear it anyways|`|8bd2f6800f0622bdcf1b1a4141b9ed49aa	Ok first off your makeup must always be age appropriate and I've seen wayyyyy to may girls your age wearing mascara including my niece, not applying it properly and winding up with emo looking raccoon eyes. I've always told our clients to start their kids with clear mascara around 12. Now my question is, do you even need mascara? For example if you have dark lashes, and you curled them and applied a coat of clear it looks 10x better than black clumpy mascara. That said if you are a blonde I understand the need for color. Tell your mom that a good compromise would be using dark brown mascara as it looks more natural and that you'll even let her watch you apply it the first time. Everything in a mother daughter relationship is a learning cycle. I really wished I hadn't worn as much makeup as I did at your age. I look back now and my God I looked like a clown lol. once again that said, age appropriate is brown mascara, (NO LINER!!), very light gold shimmery or nude eye shadow and that's it with clear pink gloss. It's pretty, highlights your features and doesn't make you look like you're trying to be older which actually winds up giving an impression to some people that I'm sure you can figure out. Email with any questions you may have.|`|6jTHZrPfaa	ohh i know what you mean and it seems everyone else has misunderstood. i am also 13 and my mum always nags me about wearing too much make up. Personally, i would just buy myself some mascara and wear it if i wear you. I know it's bad but... stick up to her. ignore her rules and do what you like but make sure you don't wear much and if she notices, explain how it's not fair and all your friends wear it and so you should be able too.<br>  hope i helped xxxxx|`|CqldGgFCaa	um so? i couldnt wear mascara till the end of the 7th grade i didnt wear like much make up at all the only reason she even lets me wear so much now is becaus my friend got me this huge box of makeup from ulta for my birthday but the first half of 8th grade all i wore was mascara and eyeliner its not the end of the worldits not like youll never wear it|`|XYT7jvBdaa	Your mom has a rule. Follow it. Don't be a little twit just because girls younger than you are wearing mascara. Don't like it? Find a job and move out. And since you're only 13, that's not gonna happen. So live with it.|`|BqQiqUfLaa	well that 9 year old is heading right for botox at 20<br>  curl your lashes and wear clear mascara<br>  your mom is smart. you probably apply it like this:<br>  <a href="http://askamakeupguru.com/blog/uploaded/clumpy%20lahes.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://askamakeupguru.com/blog/uploaded/...</a>|`|NqTi3sOtaa	mascara doesnt make you look that much better anyway. So dont worry about it. You sound like a brat. Really whiney. Get over it. loose the attitude.|`|49Ifnktsaa	you're only 13<br>  shut up foo! boys at that age'll like you no matter what!|`|nKruEEuhaa	First of all, if you can't spell designers correctly, you shouldn't be worried about using them. :) <br>  You are only 13, you have plenty of time to use makeup and perfect application. <br>  From what it seems, you are allowed to wear other forms of makeup just not mascara? Well then instead of trying to fight with her about it, why not try to ask for makeup tips, then you can see what she thinks is reasonable and appropriate for you. If she is helping you maybe it will lessen her fear of you over doing it and looking like a tramp. And lets face it, you're 13! more likely than not, you aren't applying your makeup as well as someone with more experience and age.. of course there are still ladies who are older and don't know how to apply makeup. <br>  <br>  I hope you try to work things out with your mom, don't fight or whine about it, and don't wear it behind her back because the only thing that you will be wearing is the disappointment your mom feels for you disobeying her.|`|gWuukQceaa	Wow, calm down. Don't be such a baby about it. I see why your mother doesn't let you, you're too immature. They're are a lot worst things in the world then no mascara. Show her you are mature, don't whine, yell, cry, scream, stuff that you're doing right now. Make a compromise, say you keep your grades high and then she'll let you o maybe only 3 times a week or sometimes. Remember mascara can ruin your eyelashes. You don't need designer brands. Clear mascara has the same effect. Seriously, you sicken me about how inconsiderate and immature you're acting.|`|Ue9xrUkbaa	Ok. So you started this question like a brat, and ended it like a brat. I see no reason why someone should actually help you. If you go behind her back she will find out. <br>  <br>  And girl, you don't have to be like everyone else. <br>  <br>  And maybe she doesn't want you to look like you think that you are better then everyone else with loads of crappy makeup. God. You bug the crap outta me. <br>  <br>  So girl. If you bug your mom about this then she will stand her ground even more. She won't want to give in if she feels you can't be an adult about it. So girl, you just have to wait. Don't be persistent in asking because this is one fight you can't win that way.<br>  <br>  And you seriously need to worry more about other people then your eyelashes and clothes.|`|MBwjx3CDaa	Because 13 year olds ARE children for heavens sakes.<br>  Move out when you're sixteen I just dare you, and we'll see how much you care about your retarded mascara problem when you have to worry about feeding yourself, paying your bills, deciding on eating over certain bills, and working, on your feet, for 40 or more hours a week to earn enough money to pay your rent and your power/water if you're lucky.<br>  <br>  All of those things, your mom (and dad, if applicable) do for you anyways and you want to complain about not being allowed to wear mascara? And you're trying to convince us that you're not a child? Good luck at that.|`|ZA4uU5axaa	>.> Hehe you're the opposite of my friend, she's 14, and hates makeup. Her mom forces her to wear it, personally I see no differnce with or without, it just gets in the way. Anyways if you listen to your parents, they like you better, and but you more stuff ;)|`|s940xWIraa	I say, earn some of your own money, and buy some mascara with that. Put it on a t school, your mom will never have to know. I know how you feel about it. And with the designer brands, you can earn your own money for that too, thats what I do.|`|FyRSaI2vaa	trust me, its not the end of the world. im 13 and i don't wear mascara. its not that big of a deal. just listen to your mom. she has a good reason. and about the designer clothes, she might not make enough to buy you designer since some of it is really expensive. you'll live|`|aHWQ3Rq8aa	OK, so what exactly are you asking?  But trust me, it's not the end of the world because your mom won't let you wear makeup.  She probably has good reasoning behind her rule.  Don't worry about it.|`|pkgMHyVWaa	Uhmmmm, i started wearing mascara at the age of 13, but later on in the age of 13. Give it time.<br>  <br>  She'll come around.<br>  That's how my mom did <br>  :)|`|21MMPGOXaa	Whats the question? Or are you just complaining?
zwvDITr5aa	I love the product!!  It works fabulous on my lashes.|`|iVRtP7FVaa	It probably works too.<br>  But why do you want such long lashes if you have long lashes to begin with?
WiIUEObTaa	there is no pain. the sound of the needle is associated with dentist needle. no pain at all. plus if their was , women have much higher pain threshold than males. even if there was you would not notice. no need to worry.|`|mX0qaX3Eaa	You shouldn't be thinking of getting a tattoo if you know this little about the process.|`|IbrsGV5daa	it does hurt<br>  but i depends were your geting it<br>  if you get somewere clos to bone like your ankle it hurts alot more than getting one on your arm or something<br>  yes they do use a needle<br>  you wont scream you will probably just flinch<br>  but make sure you get a tatoo somewere were you can hide it<br>  also make sure the needle is sterilized|`|AA10441869	It is not dreadfully painful. The location of the tattoo is important , over a bony area it can be. But still not enough to cry about. Yes the device they use has tiny needles which vibrate quickly. After wards you will feel like you have a minor sunburn. Be sure to discuss with the artist how to care for your new art.|`|2An1XVQxaa	yes,but a fake one wouldn't ha ha <br>  it feels like a bumblebee attacking your skin!<br>  yes they use a needle<br>  about 30 minutes it takes<br>  it hurts a lot you will scream!!!!!!!!!!ice cream|`|4cd000d6f79b5642fde7df2f56049e31aa	its like being pinched it doesnt hurt|`|TWZIeOaMaa	of course it hurts, a needle is going in and out of you thousands of times a minute. does it hurt so bad you shouldn't get one? no.<br>  <br>  here is the best description i think of the pain: it is like having a bad sunburn, and someone sticks their finger into your skin and slowly drags it down your sunburn. lol. it isn't horrible though, i just grimaced and said damn it a lot. lol.<br>  <br>  yes they use a needle, it is not like a syringe, the kid doctors use, it is actually several needles bonded together connected to a machine.<br>  <br>  a small tattoo should only take a few minutes. <br>  <br>  you probably wont scream, but it depends where you get it. try not to scream though, it will irritate the artist and other people around you, which causes a bad working environment.<br>  <br>  <br>  have fun, and DON'T FORGET TO BREATHE. breathe deliberately and take large breaths - if you don't, you could easily pass out.|`|B61c0AnXaa	It depends on where you get it.  I have 6 and my ankle was the worst spot because there isn't any meat there.  It stings alot and then feels like a sunburn for a couple of days afterwards.  The pain obviously wasn't to bad or I wouldn't have got more than one.|`|25a903128a710f9935672e9f69763d85aa	Yes it hurts. Imagine  hundreds of tiny needles injections all in the same area repeated repeated repeated and you cannot move.|`|FL2nfCSXaa	yes it hurts, yes they do use a needle and it doesnt matter the size,it still hurts.|`|u7Vp848Oaa	not as much as everyone says. (but if you have a low pain tolerance think it hurts like your arm is getting chopped off, so it will be a pleasant surprise when it doesn't) ;)|`|EqrpIU68aa	never had one but its a machine thts sticking a needle in and out of ur skin really quick. Just thinking about the needle gives me shivers lol|`|yID88A1Vaa	ya its a needle piercing your skin its like getting tons of little cuts in a not really that pretty design|`|yFKQFeeJaa	yes.|`|op5tbx0naa	if you are worried about it hurting, and seriously do not know if they use needles or not, then you shouldn't bother. don't get one. tattoos are a lifestyle, an artform.|`|aXeS3hOzaa	i've never had one<br>  but someone said it hurts reallyyy bad<br>  and yes they use a needle<br>  you might scream
0vlm2OZcaa	Yes it would look cute especially if it were like Victorian lace. The one from the picture looks nice too. Off white.|`|8Z7tF9wuaa	yeah itd look cute.|`|YTasscmKaa	Yeah, that will look nice.|`|5c680deb7617ed5aaf5b3b8e39eea1adaa	I think white would look fine and those stockings are incredibly sexy!|`|pLcUFBl2aa	Sure! But the hat looks like a chef hat btw.|`|nyQMDwWYaa	Yup!!|`|cYuWbvSKaa	yeah...sure!|`|oA066Stbaa	definitely. that outfit is cute and the black just ruins it. white stockings would look great with it, and btw that outfit is cute i love the bag and hat.|`|ndsFDeIAaa	i think white looks better actually, i own wayy to much black white would stand out more..<br>  depending on what look your going for|`|UgrzCkMIaa	naaw. that would make the outfit look completley flat and boring. spice it up, add the black!!|`|RMq1cKBNaa	No, don't wear any stockings.|`|TRSAev5waa	yep..it would.<br>  <br>  cute outfit btw|`|htx3jtoJaa	maybe but then it's sooo matchy matchy
xEl1z6SFaa	I don't have any of her Betsy Johnson collection, but I have 5 Betsyville bags. I think that they are colorful and cute, with out being to weird or anything. I think that they are sort of reasonably priced too. <br>  I love her and hope she continues to do great work alot more in Bestyville.|`|0vlm2OZcaa	Her clothes are a bit wild but I like them.|`|AA11346983	i like some of her clothes. her dresses are cute.|`|AOkucu5haa	Not my style.|`|GJOuRcqOaa	i love besey johnson i have her bags thats where i go to get all my dresses<br>  she is amazing<br>  and betseyville is absolutely amazing she has got to be my favorite designer :)|`|dyrupu1Xaa	edgy, but overrated.|`|J8LASik0aa	I do too! I love her designs.|`|AA11671462	yea i like it.|`|fia9gMHpaa	IDK|`|pIDd2y8Xaa	she's amazing.
Drg3bLjUaa	hmmm...I am not so sure...I think it may be difficult to blend the blusher out ..... try building up the colour xx|`|YhbYPzoaaa	i would imagine so but spray it with like a hairspray bottle filled with water so its light moisture.|`|8n3NvYQwaa	yes but  you have to watch for clumping...|`|lwnH4Es3aa	you should try it just to see but it prob wont blend very well|`|OOtme2jkaa	i didnt kno about that..<br>  if it doesnt work i <br>  would just say u get a darker blush|`|Yue2YKTnaa	yeah it will be a little darker
icznZFjmaa	Actually, it depends on how much you put on.. You said it looks natural, so it doesn't seem like you put on a lot of each thing.<br>  <br>  i put on just this clinique cream, pink blush, eye shadow, few coats of mascara and eyeliner, and it doesn't look like to much either.<br>  <br>  i think you're fine with the quantity of make up you're using.|`|GBBRH9y0aa	It really depends on how much you put on of each...If you put a ton of foundation and powder on, it would look cakey, but I'm sure it looks good and natural.|`|TIAbvBkpaa	i think you're fine.

lPCjNkEnaa	Yes, clear skin is the secret to good foundation. If you have non-blemished skin then your foundation will go on smoother and if you're skin isn't very blotchy then it will be easier to have a perfect finish.|`|OOtme2jkaa	you need the right kind of make-up.<br>  people like mac but if u cant afford it like me<br>  then use something cheaper that works..<br>  i use trublend by covergirl and it works great!!|`|rcqi6sSfaa	clear skin is not teh secret to a perfect foundation<br>  <br>  it may help to have clear skin and non-oily<br>  <br>  but if your not perfect (even if u r)<br>  <br>  i recomend using bareminerals.   it does not come off when u have an oily face it stays on allll day<br>  <br>  doesnt run<br>  <br>  its a powder, controls oil, and feels and looks amazing<br>  <br>  :)|`|CCA0mTgsaa	GET RICHER TO HAVE BEST SKIN IN WORLD|`|wYTDwWnEaa	ya
Dkk5HwbEaa	Using eye shadow that accentuates blue.  Use blues (especially) purple, greens, blues with pink, and a nice eyeliner (not too thick or dark).<br>  <br>  Also, wearing colors that match your eyes in blue tones.|`|Drg3bLjUaa	I too have blue eyes and I find green/brown/lilacs eyeshadow with a little mascara helps my eyes pop|`|tJnAJDb3aa	i have light brown eyes and they are beautifull in the light, they look hazel and i use eyeliner to make them stand out more then i want, firstly i use foundation on the bottom so that the eyeliner doesnt smudge or come off, next i get a white eyeliner and apply it on my waterliner and lastly i use black eyeliner lightly to give it more of a dramatic look.<br>  hope this helps and hope this is what your looking for|`|OH799dHGaa	eyeliner under the eye i have blue eyes and i do that|`|qAYgq4DBaa	eyeliner under your eyes, and also on the top!!!!!|`|J8LASik0aa	Silver eyeliner! Not too much though!
C0HZ8ZB4aa	I quite like it how it is. Is it going on the chest or back? Sometimes simpler is better; I like the rays too, and I think if you added too much else it would detract from the effect of them. If you get it and feel it needs a bit more then you can always have more done to it at a later date - sometimes it's easier to tell when it's on the skin! Good luck!<br>  <br>  Edit: mm actually what screaming said about the rose is true - I hadn't noticed that - the middle of it is a side profile and the edges are a birds eye view. I would get that redrawn. But as for the detail, my opinion stays the same, but it's up to you of course!|`|WiIUEObTaa	very nice. would a braid on both sides of skull work. on screen the mismatch of long braid throws Definition off. possible short braid. both sides. no offence it is a great great choice. thank you|`|lfNUHpcEaa	If you are doing this shoulder to shoulder you need to add more detail with the skull & the wings.

I would try Estee Lauder, they do some really good cream ones.. but if that isn't your type, then try tge Flawless Finish.. that seems to work too(:<br>  <br>  As far as Chanel goes, I'm not sure if they have any cream foundations.|`|tESdl7gbaa	don't go for dream matte mousse whatever you do, if anything it just accentuates the dry skin.|`|qx9zPNU6aa	i use Mac studio fix fluid and it does not give me a cakey effect as long as you apply the right amount|`|l6bpyjqZaa	try BOBBI BROWN  its amazing :D ask for the foundation sitck!|`|u7o75zipaa	Why do you need a designer one?<br>  <br>  I love Rimmel products. They're pretty cheap, but they're really good. I especially like the Lasting Finish Liquid Foundation, and the Lasting Finish Mineral Powders. <br>  Other than Rimmel, Vichy have some great foundations. They give a really nice coverage.|`|Yue2YKTnaa	try St Ives Apricot scrub<br>  that's going to make your skin soft and smooth all day and put Vaseline on your face after for better facial skin <br>  and then apply any foundation that fits you best<br>  i recommend maybelline dream matte mousse foundation

7PbJWEo1aa	how about you do lots of different designs in Henna until you can decide.<br>  <br>  I personally would never get a tattoo done because they look awful on old people and go all saggy and yuck.

Get some ideas from some tattoo galleries and magazines, like www.bmeink.com and then think long and hard about it before you go and get it done! It's supposed to hurt a lot around the ankle, so make sure you eat plenty before you go for it and only go to a tattooist who has a good reputation and  good source of previous works you can see. You can usually take a rough idea into a tattooist and they can sit with you and adapt it to something you might like, since they've got loads of experience of different designs and are arty types! Good luck x|`|KNdddHIjaa	I was going to have an ankle bracelet done last year, I am not very tall (5ft 1ins) and the tattooist said that it would make my ankle look chunky, he drew it on to show how it would look, and he was right, so I had a daisy chain across the top my foot, going up passed the ankle bone and a little bit up to the calf, I can add on to this, On my other ankle I have got a butterfly, and this year I will add flowers on my foot and around the butterfly.<br>  <br>  Have a go at drawing different designs, try going around the back of your ankle and flowing down on to your foot.<br>  <br>  Best of luck, hope you find a design you love.|`|WaLzp8mlaa	My friend Carly has got rosary beads around her ankle and she is not religious at all, I love flower Tattoo's around the ankle area, <br>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/duanecmoody/1093420697/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/photos/duanecmoody...</a><br>  <br>  Some of my friends have stars,music quotes and tribal designs around there ankle area.<br>  Here are some links that might give you some more ideas,<br>  <a href="http://aboutfacesentertainers.com/images/henna/boardman_m/boardman_m2_sm.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://aboutfacesentertainers.com/images...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://media.photobucket.com/image/ankle%20tattoos/xThatsxSoxHxCx/Tattoos/AnkleTattoo.jpg?o=13" rel="nofollow">http://media.photobucket.com/image/ankle...</a><br>  <br>  No matter what Idea you pick I'm sure you'll love your Tat.<br>  <br>  Melody|`|YRb5ah2Gaa	I saw a girl with musical notes going up her foot, and I thought it looked beautiful.

KkTJf8kWaa	Mimi on Drew Carey!!!|`|IduItEH9aa	I agree 100%.  Makeup can make a person look very elegant but, if it's not applied well (too much, wrong colors, etc.) it can really be horrible.|`|hkzGYQD4aa	If the make-up looks natural, then yes. But I agree with you, people who wear too much make-up look really fake. <br>  <br>  =]|`|8q82dLS8aa	If done right, yes<br>  <br>  If done wrong, like WAY to much or the wrong shades or something, no<br>  <br>  Make-up is made to enhance a girl's beauty, so you have to be naturally beautiful first.<br>  <br>  Makeup can't create beauty, it just enhances it.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps! :)|`|tRmtmRQZaa	To me makeup is just to enchance your features.even if you dont wear makeup you still look beautiful.but the people who wear too much make up just go overboard and think they are ugly.they dont need all that makeup,their beautiful the way they are.|`|AA11510511	No.  <br>  <br>  Some females where too much make up, and look ridiculous for it.  Others look a lot better without any make up at all.|`|LoO9LptJaa	i can't decide if i look better with makeup or not! i think it depends on the day for me =] haha|`|pGIADFNxaa	Well,it depends on the person,really.If the person is not very good looking,then yes,maybe,if it's done right and not too much make-up is piled on.If the person has natural beauty then,nope,they don't need any make up at all :) Also,if you have alot of spots,and try covering them up  by piling on concealer and foundation,that'll just make them look worse.People with clear skin don't really need any make up.|`|gXrwqoTGaa	Sometimes. Some people don't need makeup so just look the same. But when done right it makes average looking people look gorgeous. Just look at the celebrities and how they look without makeup. However if done wrong the person ends up looking horrible and like an ugly prostitute.|`|70a43707807dc9900f19f111a38b3d42aa	Yeah it depends on the person I think and their face.<br>  some people truly look better without it b/c they are so pretty naturally and/or their face doesn't take makeup so well (doesn't sit well on their skin, etc.)|`|s4FEJiNHaa	I think it just depends on the individual woman.  Some do look better if the makeup isn't overdone.  Others, I think, look better with no makeup at all.|`|G51N3XFsaa	Not always, because there are women who use the wrong shades for their complexion and those that apply too much, both of which can be unflattering.|`|pgmXNpuOaa	No i dont....I personally think kim kardashian looks gorgeous without make up and looks so much younger.|`|Yue2YKTnaa	i look better with it<br>  some said i look better with make-up|`|YWaUaPaSaa	Only if it is natural or really pretty|`|yydPZxjeaa	you're so right<br>  clumpy mascara scares me even if on the most beautiful girl<br>  foundation lines are like Evidence at a crime scene. messy and sloppy work.<br>  and then the difference of a girls face with or without makeup can be completely misleading.<br>  if you don"t recognize the person with and without, then its way too much<br>  i think you should have a makeup mentor.<br>  look for someone who has nice skin, similar to yours.<br>  and then look for what you think looks gorgeous, don't follow trends<br>  1 men don't want you to take too long to get ready<br>  2 make up can give you acne<br>  3 what will happen if you cry? be aware of days when you know tears will be evident. raccoon eyes are not pretty<br>  4 do not cover just enhance<br>  5 don't use make up to boost confidence<br>  6 be okay with going out without any<br>  7 have fun with it|`|bEggkHpraa	I think that people really need to be careful with their make-up because you need to do what looks good on you. If you can pull off a lot of make-up then sure that's great, if you cant then thats fine too. and i agree, some people just don't need to wear so much make-up because it doesn't look good. But people who can look stunning without makeup are really lucky!!|`|kG9MtTuDaa	If a person uses the right kind of make up the right way it can really enhance the great features they already have. Usually light make up just to make the skin look healthier or clearer, or to make your eye color pop does that. <br>  <br>  But when people just cake it on, or OVER USE things like eyeliner or cover up, blush, and lipstick or lip gloss it looks really gross. reminds me of a clown.|`|nxroDXsQaa	All women need a little make-up even if they have flawless features.  The point of make up is to enhance the good features you have to bring out the beauty that you possess.  Some of us do need it for coverage, but it doesn't mean that we need to wear a lot of make-up.  It's using it correctly.|`|KELBedyiaa	I think it depends on your definition of better.  <br>  <br>  Personally (though I do wear it at times) I think makeup is just one more way women try to blend in.  It makes us fake.<br>  <br>  Although I do know that wearing very light (Natural looking) makeup can be very flattering. <br>  <br>  But seriously, who's lips are really blood red?  Or orange? Or Brown?  Where did we get the crazy idea that THAT is better than being real.|`|Z2uYisnAaa	If they put on just enough and not too much I think it can improve someones looks. Especially eyeliner and Mascara, some people's skin doesnt need foundation. But I agree when people wear too much makeup it just makes them look a million times worse.|`|ArKT9O7Maa	If people wear a lot of makeup, I think they just look cheap and desperate.  However, if they just wear a bit of make up here and there to make themselves look more even, I think it's fine.|`|PrOeRK2Eaa	no, not always<br>  some ppl do it over the top and it doesnt look good<br>  some ppl need a little or just the right amount<br>  some pple look better bare-natural|`|8Cnqdn62aa	Well at first it makes them look nice but after a while of wearing make up it messes up your skin and makes you look bad|`|RR4oRK4Paa	If it is done correctly.. YES!!! Mascara is a wonder!!! but foundation and such.. is not good!|`|J8LASik0aa	When its done natural, it might. But I hate when people wear too much eyeliner. Yuck.|`|fjOMthF1aa	I prefer natural beauty...|`|JppKTOPnaa	It looks nice at the club, but when you wake up the next morning it looks horrible. Night of the living dead!|`|u1GzFtCBaa	no i think some people look better without and i hate when people wear too much|`|hahwsMd7aa	yes|`|h0rWnvx1aa	Make up is good to wear to make yourself look better, but if you put to much on it would really make you look bad. So wear some make up if you want but just remember to not get carried away with it and put to much on.|`|36ZKn2bMaa	not allways if the person makes it too gaudy then its bad and if there just isn't quite enough it can be bad. some people are just beautiful without it.|`|yQF4yldxaa	it depends on how much makeup you wear but i had an ex who said he didn't like me with make up but others do so just ask and remember you cant please everyone|`|T6Ev1Kejaa	yes depending on the amount of makeup|`|mX34bDWtaa	no, too much is never good

kCdISEGqaa	I'm going to be completely honest with you, tattoo inks are completely unregulated, and the FDA does not test or approve them.  Manufacturers are not required to list ingredients on their products, so honestly, we don't really know what is contained in the inks themselves.  Some people have reactions to the inks but often times, they don't know why they had the reaction.  They can't trace the reaction to a certain ingredient.  I've never known of anyone with a peanut allergy to have a reaction to tattoo ink, but, that's not to say it can't happen.  I don't know how to answer your question, sorry.|`|CNB7WITFaa	go to the doctor and see that would be the best thing to do.|`|Q3DKaSyPaa	You'd have to go to a parlor and ask what kind of ink they use. From there do online search to find the ingredients.<br>  <br>  Make sure to get to know the tattoo artist and let him know. Maybe he knows another alternative.|`|FDgHnvm3aa	The chance that something will happen is so ridiculously low that its not something to worry about.

But if you wear them with something like jeans that you can't even see the heels then maybe no one will even notice.  Or try wearing a cute wedge sandal or something that will give you the height but still look casual.|`|IGAx1FgEaa	yeah....... i luv heels i wear them every chance i get.... it also depends on how long are your classes n stuff..... some ppl i no bring a pair of flip flops and put those on in class, then when they change classes they put their heels back on.... but me personally, i can handle wearing heels all day long.... just depends on how comfortable you are wearing them|`|yeK9KSP1aa	well personally i wouldnt wear heels cause i am a giant anyways hahaha<br>  bt i dn't think you should because you wear them at prom nd school, i think shoes for prom should just stay for that moment in time|`|A6dpeGUtaa	Heels are not appropriate for school. It doesn't matter if you're short lol, most guys like short girls. I'm 6'1" and my gf is 4'11". It's not a big deal.<br>  <br>   I wouldn't wear them if I were you.|`|qNOeBcvraa	heels are hot. i would wear thm 24/7. but im a mom of two little 1s so i gotta b flexable. but  i wear them at least twice a week. go for it heels are so girly!|`|lXGtDNZzaa	i think it will be fine.<br>  <br>  heels make everyone's legs look great<br>  <br>  just make sure that they're comfortable, since wearing them all day could become detrimental to your health.<br>  <br>  :D|`|411c9e50db3e6aa419765275e1da7d4aaa	people won't really care. but don't wear it often because it's not good for your spine and whatnot.<br>  <br>  and it'll make you taller!|`|QKFMbJqlaa	yea|`|hoEtmkTHaa	Practically speaking, wearing high heels to school, where you'll be walking all over the place is not a good idea.  Your feet will hurt and be blistered at the end of the day.  Chances are, with heels that high, you will have trouble walking correctly the next day.  <br>  <br>  But they sure will look cute.|`|5x3NQJBQaa	to "Marie <3"<br>  she sadi she was a JUNIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL, not in junior high school, big difference<br>  <br>  yeah, i say go for it.  if you want to be taller why not?<br>  if you dont like it the first day you dont have to wear them again.|`|D3bLcWNsaa	You should just wear just regular shoes cause you dont want to break your ankles walking down the stairs. Heels might be to formal for school.|`|CKpxVeucaa	yeah, people do it at my school all the time.|`|8iR6XOD7aa	yeah do it. maybe have a friend do it too|`|govpgOhqaa	hahaha. to the answer who said something about junior high.<br>  she's a junior IN high school. as in 11th grade. xD<br>  but if they're casual enough, then sure, you can wear them. but typically shoes you wear to prom are too dressy to wewar out regularly. i probably wouldn't wear them, but i also don't know how casual they are.<br>  if you like them then just go ahead and wear them, who cares what people say.
47ddda29b6896ce72acab50c6bef43fdaa	It's just part of the healing process. The tattoo artist should have told you this would happen. DO NOT PICK THE INK OFF OR SCRATCH YOUR TATTOO!!!|`|itiJVgRsaa	Don't use lotion.......! USe A & D ointment only it works and that's what i put on all my tats. don't scratch it though you'll ruin it.|`|AA10783670	its fine, it's starting to heal. you will get a very light scab too
ll5lS1wmaa	Yes. It's going to look like that for a little while but whatever you do, do NOT pick at or peel it.|`|N6frEVbiaa	yup. completely normal. do not pick it!!|`|MFWEkkd9aa	Don't worry about it my love, but whatever you do, DON'T PICK!!!!<br>  <br>  Take care you, Lulu x|`|ab2c491e6bca420e2c45c21f91d16208aa	yep keep applying your cream and don't pick,rub or itch.|`|lfNUHpcEaa	The cracking IS NOT NORMAL !! its funny how some people are giving you advise from only having 2-or 5 tattoos. The cracking was caused from having too much ointment on the tattoo which caused is to start scabbing, When you apply the ointment on your new tattoo you have to rub the ointment in for a few min then use a moist paper towel to get the excess off the tattoo if not scabbing will happen which can cause you to loose some color..It should peel like a sunburn and you may go through this stage a couple of times. As everyone has said DON'T PICK !! If you loses any color you can have it fixed====================  ( A reply to the disagreements),,,I see people have given me 2 thumbs down so what i have to say is that ;If the tattoo is very fresh and it has cracks in it  this means that the tattooist cut him with the needles which is caused by going over the same spot too much. If the tat is not like that then it got a scab on it which is caused by leaving too much ointment on which kept the pores open and seeped then hardened to form a scab that cracked which may bleed . So either way this is not normal|`|AA11185595	Yes but you must use a moisturiser for maybe a week after you got it, me, I used the cream for the first month and my Tat still has the colour after 12 years.Don't pick or scratch at this stage either|`|8Cnqdn62aa	Yea it supposed to do that for the first two to three weeks.  DO NOT pick or scratch at it.|`|OjXvYEZDaa	Yes its normal, skin would cracking and looks like flakes, just leave it alone, it will be very itchy but don't scratch,rub or pick it, just put cream on like E45 or vaseline when u feel itchy, and don't soak tattoo in water if ur going for bath for a week keep it nice and dry till it heals completely|`|C0HZ8ZB4aa	Yeah, quite normal. How fresh is the tattoo? If the cracks are still there after 2 or 3 weeks then it's likely you'll need a touch up, but that's not the end of the world and it should be free.
s1BsUSJVaa	Ahaha yes, you can still use the lip gloss. The tubes shouldn't have expiration dates on them anyway, because they don't go bad like food, unless if you opened up a tube of gloss and didn't touch it for 20 years. Then it would probably smell weird and have an odd texture. Thankfully that's not the case, so there's no need to worry. =]|`|fqIE566Caa	It should be fine as it's been kept in a cool place. However, try and stick to using a lipbrush which you wash regulary to avoid spreading germs and such. If you wash your brush regulary (after each use) then you should find it'll last longer.|`|qE3ySuMbaa	Omg. Its lip gloss!! Its fine...jeez|`|IChOlztKaa	sure use it.. the worst that could happen is die. but you would have to eat it before that happends.|`|JhJXKRkOaa	lip gloss lasts along time, your lip gloss is alright.|`|OOtme2jkaa	yeah its ohkay..<br>  the bad ones usually make ur lips dry or chapped!|`|lMOudbdTaa	yes its fine to use<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  can u please answer mine<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ar0ovb5xj4Eq454KBK.Nq30Oxgt.;_ylv=3?qid=20090222162956AAObXEL">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|FWSyKLDjaa	Yea, it's still fine to use.|`|45e970b2e25dcf51734629fdc5f7a11baa	yes its good to use.

In the UK she would probably be bullied by people called 'chavs' which is harsh I'm sorry. This would probably make her shy. She sounds like my friend Abi. She would be seen as a tomboy too, that's where I agree with others, this would also probably make her be bullied.

She's still experimenting with the direction she might go and she may simply be a very, very well rounded young woman who doesn't feel that she needs to follow everyone else.<br>  <br>  When I was a kid, I enjoyed dressing and acting one way one day and something else another.  That's just how my crowd was and it was a very healthy thing to do.  We (about ten of us) explored life by blending in with different crowds to see what we wanted from life.  The result was that our college experiences were not wasted on this exploration and we all did well.<br>  <br>  It is not necessary to pick how you want to be labeled.  I do not care for labels like that and I'm still something of a mystery to my friends.  I'm constantly invited to parties and have a very rich life.

FEVQisMGaa	First of all I'm a dude. Totally straight. The lesbian pr0n of my hard drive should prove that I liek teh womenz.<br>  <br>  Onward:<br>  <br>  You have a dev art page...<br>  That tells me you're an "artist," or at least "artistic" whether you like the word or not.<br>  <br>  So from one artistically minded person to another, I would suggest golden tones. But to further elucidate...<br>  <br>  You have brown eyes, and you have brown/dark hair, and you have a light complexion.<br>  <br>  Assessment = color.<br>  <br>  The advantage to brown is that it works in any way, with any color combination. This is because brown (or at least in Color Theory) is the result of blending all the colors.<br>  <br>  To make the brown tones pop, you are going to need something from the warmer ends of the color spectrum. Reds, oranges, and yellows. Because brown is considered "dark," using warm tones is logical because they're complementary.<br>  <br>  But if you want to make them pop with the use of cooler tones like blues, purples, and greens. Those color tones should be in the pastel/white range.<br>  <br>  Another alternative is to go for a natural tone--again going "golden" by using yellows and oranges. Or to use pink tones and creams (which are on the warm end of the spectrum).<br>  <br>  You should take advantage of your light/fair complexion.<br>  <br>  EDIT: This is strictly related to color tones around the eyes in relation to your hair color. I'm considering the entire package, not just the face. You have to factor your hair color into this.<br>  <br>  And as a dude, I think girls who wear as little make up as possible is attractive. Or girls who wear natural tones for the lips.<br>  <br>  EDIT: This one is pretty unorthodox...<br>  <br>  How about gray?<br>  <br>  Dun-dun-duunnn...<br>  <br>  EDIT: The show Supernatural is awesome.|`|2sdirM5Aaa	I would use a liner that isn't real dark, maybe just a light brown for under the eye. For the bottom of the lid, I would use a darker but bright either bronze colored eye shadow that has some shimmer to it; or just sweep your whole eye with a light dusting of a cream color. Use a good quality brown mascara only on the top lashes. <br>  Hope this helps!<br>  <br>  [The links included are just some idea of what colors to use, NOT actual brands to buy.]|`|8t6zDfzqaa	Lavender , light brown colors etc.|`|hahwsMd7aa	brown eyeshadow|`|OOtme2jkaa	my eyes are like yours n i use <br>  yellow with orange<br>  purple with white or vanilla<br>  teal with vanilla<br>  pink with vanilla<br>  dark pink with vanilla<br>  green with vanilla or yellowish or orangish|`|i01egybJaa	Dark brown, or maybe dark blue.

Get about 15 feet away from the camera and then have the photographer zoom in on your face not just your nose and we'll get a better idea. This would give the same perspective as a lens known as a portrait lens which roughly corresponds to a 90 to 135mm lens on a 35mm camera.<br>  <br>  Also a side shot of your face would be a big help.<br>  <br>  Anyway you appear to be good looking regardless of your nose.

GItWq2mGaa	IN USE<br>  I choose to apply the mousse using a foundation brush, and this is the method I would recommend. Using a blending wedge or sponge I feel would apply too much product, and fingers would not achieve as natural, air-brushed a finish.<br>  <br>  I find that very little is needed, I dab my brush extremely lightly so that I can just about see some product on the bristles, and blend outwards from my nose over problem patches. I only apply to areas where I want to reduce redness, blend over a concealer and even out skin tone.<br>  <br>  I would say this is a medium-coverage mousse. While it covers my redness extremely well, I can still just about see actual blemishes a little under concealer and the mousse. That said, this is more than likely down to the actual texture of them.<br>  <br>  The mousse is really easy to remove using my normal cleanser and toner, and does not irritate my sensitive skin.<br>  <br>  VERDICT<br>  I have been wearing the mousse every day since I bought it just over a week ago, and am very impressed so far. It blends seamlessly and does not look cakey when well blended into the skin. I would recommend this foundation more for people wanting to cover problem areas rather than the entire face - I do think it could tend to look a little orange/cakey/unnatural then. The beauty of the mousse is how well it blends with your natural skin tone, but you of course need some visible for it to work!<br>  <br>  I was a bit worried that the mousse would run out really quickly due to its formula and the fact that it is essentially full of air, but it actually feels quite springy in the pot and as you only need a very small amount, I've only made very small dents in the pot with my brush. Again I do wholeheartedly recommend using a brush with this for an airbrushed finish and minimal wastage of product.|`|ZgAyvTqRaa	I use this product everyday, I really like it. I actually put on a liquid foudation first, the maybelline instant age rewind cream foundation. Im only 22 so using it has nothing to do with the "age rewind," but I really like it. I then put on the dream matte mouse as a finish, it really makes my skin look flawless. Just apply with your fingertip, lightly. I also use the maybelline blush mousse, also a great finish with the other two products. I would recommend trying the dream matte.|`|GBBRH9y0aa	I actually love it, its very creamy and flawless looking.

Do NOT get fake nails. Just the white polish). You don't want your nails to clash too much, and with black and white pretty much any color would look weird. For the rest of your makeup, stick with neutral shades. Black eyeliner, maybe some pale ivory eyeshadow. You can definitely go with red lips if your dress is black and white, or any other shade of lipstick that looks good on you. A nice rose pink would be lovely too. Just keep the eyes more natural if you opt for red. Avoid shades of brown for the eyes as it will clash with the black of your dress. The shoes... well... they should go with the main color of your dress. If it is mostly white, go for white shoes. If it is mostly black, go for black. And for your hair, try to get some white freesias in there : P they smell like pepper though ( which I love).. but I had them in my hair for my prom, they don't wilt too fast, especially if you give them a good coating of hairspray first. Hope this helps.|`|AA11440731	It depends on which color of your dress is more dominate than the other. If black is more dominant, do white shoes. if white is, do black ones to pop the color out a bit more.<br>  <br>  Put a midnight blue on your nails, or maybe a dark purple. <br>  Your makeup should be a smokey eye, maybe silver, but don't be too matchy to the extreme.|`|H2tkkWyPaa	I would say probably black shoes would be best.  I think for nails you could go with a classic french manicure or do a bright color, since your dress is black and white.  For makeup, I would say something like this would probably look good.<a href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3270/2430213120_6b8f3aca19_m.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3270/2430...</a> <br>  or this<br>  <a href="http://www.movingmakeup.com.au/images/nicole1.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.movingmakeup.com.au/images/ni...</a>|`|RNYGEf5Vaa	Okay! Love these questions.<br>  <br>  <br>  1. Shoes-get black, because white shoes get dirty too fast. <br>  2. You should get French nails.<br>  3. Maybe you should try to do a, "smokey eye". like dark colors but not too dark. And maybe like a shiny light pink color would do good. <br>  Well hope these tips worked. :D|`|aS81Ckdcaa	black shoes<br>  and<br>  acrylics or french manicure|`|5OUGmDVbaa	your shoes should be black and your nails a totally different colour<br>  <br>  your makeup depends on ur eyes and hair|`|MNa3e8Mdaa	you should wear black shoes and a french manicure for nails. and do either light make up are kindadark. you dont want to look emo with really dark make up .. unless you are then go right ahead!!!

oA066Stbaa	i use garneir and neutrogena. i use neutrogena oil free acne wash, becuase i don't have acnes but it helps prevent it from coming. then i apply toner and then moisturize. make sure it has SPF! i do this 2-3 time a a day. other times i use garneir fresh it comes in a green bottle. i have two kits with different brands. i have the cleanser.toner, and moisturizer for neutrogena and grarnier so it's cool to see the different effects. and everyonce in a while i make a mask for my self works great.like 1 every 2 weeks or 1 a month, or sometimes 1 a week. drink loads of water. alos people find this hard to believe but one of the huge causes of acne is the bacteria found on your pillow case so wash it very frequently. ALWAYS ALWAYS clean off make up before u go to bed. with the routine above. and always wear moisturizer with spf under your make up. eat lots more veggies too, green veggies are the best, like letteuce, spinach and green peppers. a great way to open and clean pores it too steam your face which opens the pores the either put on a mask or wsh your face with exfoliating scrub or cleanser to clean it out. i recommend neutrogena the wave cause the thing that vibrates helps clean out the pores the after put some ice on your face to close the pores and make sure bacteria dosen't get in, then put some sliced cucumbers on your face to really refresh it and make it soft. aloe vera works great for smooth and soft face as well. here are some masks that are for different types of skin:<br>  For oily skin use some plain Milk, rub it on and let dry, then rinse with warm water. It absorbs oil wonderfully!<br>  <br>  For Normal/combination skin mix one egg and 1/2 cup cooked instant oatmeal and a teaspoon olive oil until smooth. Spread on your face and leave 15 min then rinse.<br>  <br>  For dry skin, mix one egg yolk, one teaspoon honey and a teaspoon olive oil and some vitamin E oil if you have it. Smooth on and leave on for 15 min. , rinse in warm water and pat dry. If your skin is a bit dry you can put a dab or two of either olive oil, or any other light oil, or plain crisco if you want something heavier, on your moist skin after washing it.<br>  or check out this site it has tones of easy homemade masks:<br>  <a href="http://www.wittyliving.com/recipes/facial-mask-recipes.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.wittyliving.com/recipes/facia...</a><br>  btw i really recommend neutrogena it works great especially is u have oily skin the oil free acne wash will be perfect. it's gentel yet efective and you won't get rashes. i use it and even though i don't have acne it helps prevent them especially cause i'm always so stressed cause high school is hard.|`|v0FlUan0aa	i use netrogena face wash scrub. and i moisturize with merlot natural grape seed moisturizer|`|NYBo35zjaa	Drink lots of water, eat green leafy vegs.

hMtvuxqZaa	Loreal's Telescopic because it defines and elongates your lashes more. The Maybelline one isn't too bad either but I found it quite clumpy.|`|tJnAJDb3aa	Maybellines keep its hold for very long, it is a good brand for eyes, espically eyeliner. it stays on till it is taken off..thats all i can say, try rimmel or chanel they work grate for me<br>  good luck and hope you choose the right one that your looking for
3ece80164c2739cc39f908768c919b69aa	The color you are looking for is difficult to find, and may even have been discontinued by the manufacturer. The first thing that I would do is go to Maybelline's web site, and contact them, ask them if they still make the color, and if so, where it can be found in your area. That will give you a straight up answer as to whether or not the product's color has been discontinued, or is only available in limited areas. <br>  <br>  If you find out that the color has been discontinued, go to the following web site, which specializes in discontinued shades of makeup by multiple brands. Also, you can check E-bay, but make sure that the products you buy are not past their expiration date. Makeup past it's expiration date can grow fungus, mold, and other types of bacteria. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.blujay.com/?page=profile&profile_username=artsmile" rel="nofollow">http://www.blujay.com/?page=profile&prof...</a><br>  <br>  Good luck in your search!

lfNUHpcEaa	You can use Ivory soap because it is a all natural soap with a natural pH balance. What ever you use just make sure you rinse off the Tattoo very well and pat it dry. If the two was the only 2 to choose from I would choose the Dove because it has moisturizers in the soap.90% of soaps have some kine of fragrance in them.The Dial some times irritates the tattoos.One that I like to use is Oil of Olay,very mild,some fragrance,has moisturizers.|`|nb9Ky2Draa	agreed. stay away from fragrances. i use dove, but there is not 100% right or wrong. everyone has their way.|`|TyeuvRJzaa	Use Alcohol or babyOil.|`|A0nRQHDCaa	You want something that is antibacterial, the scent of the soap doesn't really matter just the scent of the lotion you use because you are letting the lotion soak into your skin and scented lotions have extra crap in it.

vv2uk9hHaa	Think of it this way.. you know those Nutricap capsules people take for their hair? That's shock-full of silica. It won't hurt you. It's pretty inert. I'd be way more worried about oxybenzone, that "wonderful" sunscreen that gets absorbed in your cells through the skin and causes DNA strand breaks when exposed to sunlight. But I have to say that the whole HD line isn't all that great.  I think it makes my skin looks worse than my mineral foundation. Definitely not worth the high price.
VN2wyTnFaa	Honestly, YouTube is amazing. There are tons of professional makeup artists on YouTube that do tutorials, that give reviews of products, that give tips, and tricks and all sorts of things, so you should definitely start there. You don't really need to go to beauty school to become a makeup artist unless you want to work in a salon, then you'd have to go for you esthetician's license. Hope that helped a little, good luck!

WiIUEObTaa	ancient was the evil eye myth. this nonsense lost in history. know it is the all seeing eye of your world. small religious symbolism. non offencive. very good choice. sure beats the boring non - Original fad artwork. very good choice.|`|C0HZ8ZB4aa	I don't know if there is a particular meaning behind getting the human eye tattooed or not. However, not everything that people get tattooed necessarily has symbolism behind it. Perhaps people get an eye because they want an eye. Perhaps it has some symbolism to various individuals without having a common meaning. All of my tattoos so far have some sort of symbolic meaning to me, yet none of them are typical symbols that will have any meaning for anyone else. So if it means something to you, or even if it doesn't but you just like the look of it, then get it. It doesn't matter if there's a widely recognized meaning (and if none of us have heard of it then it can't be that widely recognized anyway) behind it or not. Those meanings are just something some other human made up once upon a time.

rxmubcdwaa	you should go to a doctor!!! i dont think thats normall<br>  <br>  (not to be mean)|`|v42fQPyPaa	make some one take the highlighters away from you and hide them where you aren't going to hide them.|`|cgWKL4mfaa	are you serios??? well if you are, you should really see a doctor, or a hypnotist. Hope i helped!|`|TOYeE0iraa	stop buying highlighters! just drop them and step away! have self control!|`|zEoRcL91aa	Very 80's! Adam Ant used to do that:)
ll5lS1wmaa	Sounds like an infection. She should call the person who did her tattoo and ask for instructions on how to care for it, or she can just call her doctor and get antibiotics.|`|C0HZ8ZB4aa	Okay, do you have a photo you can put up so we can see? It's hard to give a diagnosis with that information. By blisters - do you mean scabs on the tattoo? If so, that is totally normal. Itching is normal too. And if she got it at the end of the week, then it could be still a bit painful now. If you mean literally blisters - then I would get her to a doctors asap. Sounds like the area is either infected or she's having a reaction to the ink.|`|ss48BEk5aa	Well if it's not oozing yellowish/ greenish fluid, it's not infected. Something similar happened to me and it was just a bad reaction to A&D Diaper rash cream. Ever since then I have only used H2Ocean on new tattoos. Some people use what is called "Tattoo Goo" You can usually purchase such products from Tattoo shops, Hot Topic, Some local boutiques may have it.|`|lfNUHpcEaa	With out seeing the tattoo its hard to say but if the rash is around the the tattoo this usually means that she is having a reaction to the ointment(over medicating the tattoo) if the rash was on the tattoo this would mean she is having a reaction to the Tattoo ink. Dont panic go wash off the tattoo and go see a doctor!!|`|MFWEkkd9aa	She definatrely should go to the Doctors and get some antibiotics.<br>  <br>  Take care you, Lulu x
kCdISEGqaa	Worse than a bee sting, but not as bad as being kicked in the face with soccer cleats.  Hope that helps!|`|OjXvYEZDaa	I would say bony is more painful as I had my tattoo done on my ankle when needle went on my bony bit I felt want to stop! but I can't as I had to keep very still. black ink is more sorer than colouring|`|WYa3UY6Gaa	( usually ) its more painful on boney areas|`|8Cnqdn62aa	Well I just went with my friend to get a tattoo and in my opinion its best to get it where you have the most meat at because where ever there is bone its going to hurt extremely bad.<br>  My friend was a guy who weight lifts everyday and he was in pain when they hit bone.|`|CNB7WITFaa	don't get a tramp stamp! lol jk but if you rele want to get one, try to get it on the fat. the bony parts of your body will hurt like soooo bad. TRUST ME!!!!!!!|`|FDgHnvm3aa	i have some on my thigh, and it didnt hurt at all|`|7b62db8c16688b1a08f7f646af8da44caa	worse than childbirth.  less than a papercut.  worse than a broken heart.  less than stubbing your toe on the coffee table while stumbling to the bathroom in the middle of the night.  worse than a mosquito bite.  less than a bee sting.<br>  <br>  all descriptions of tattoo pain are accurate... for the person getting the tattoo.  get one and you will have your own opinions.<br>  <br>  for me, bony areas were nothing (feet, back of neck, wrist).  meatier area (calf) was what hurt me the most.|`|S3Bd3JIDaa	in my opinion they are not painful at all. The only ones that make you flinch a little is under the arm and on the ribs.|`|qI6IYt02aa	The more fat and muscle the better
OOtme2jkaa	mac!!|`|ITJtxINpaa	MAC paint pots are definitely better, but Stila is still good.|`|M3pufPlnaa	MAC is better in quality, but Stila is still good! :)

YTDbHwhcaa	do light pink with black and purple lines going across eachother with the purple sparkles over it <br>  its cute|`|5T32VHavaa	I think it would be cute if you did hot pink with maybe a black paw print or a green plant drawn on or something :)|`|4yFDVPhQaa	I LOVE checkers. Like black or white with any other color. It looks sooooo cute.|`|UJbKH9yWaa	try palm trees, thats wat i always get|`|iFORmz1Waa	french manicure type, except in colour, is one of the easiest<br>  eg use hot pink instead of clear and black instead of white<br>  :]|`|Wa9Zr4HHaa	Depends what for. Hot pink is fun. Dark colors are more sophisticated. I really like purple.|`|ut2vvEu5aa	if you want something easy you could do white with black spots or the other way around|`|AA12174734	look it up on youtube ive seen some great but easy ones|`|AsQkzj3daa	my friend had a zebra design, and i ?d it!!! it would look good (black+white btw:)|`|AILK0BTiaa	simple black is nice :o)
jQBM2AGkaa	It's not true that you don't sag if you don't wear one; if you have bigger breasts, they will succumb to gravity a lot quicker without support. I wear my bra all the time unless I'm sleeping. Personally, I think bras make everyone's boobs look better anyway!|`|AsQkzj3daa	its bad to wear a bra too much or not a lot. you should take it off for night but wear it throughout the day|`|dXDroPtfaa	You start to sag if you don't wear one at all.<br>  <br>  I'd say wear one during the day-and take it off at night.<br>  <br>  Answer mine?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Avz5zNr_wc1V.dFAtH7M8ojsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090222113517AAMrzkN">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  Thanks.|`|pIDd2y8Xaa	whether you're awake or asleep, you need to be supported. underwire when you're awake, sports bra when you're asleep.|`|cYuWbvSKaa	You're suppose to wear it more otherwise you'll have saggy boobs! LOL!|`|I5ccK5Qfaa	Take it off when you go to bed.|`|Q7kNtNSRaa	more i think|`|g6lvm8eUaa	none of those other answers are true. You don't sag if you don't wear one, you don't get cancer from wearing it too much. Bras are only meant for you to feel comfortable in your clothes. They have nothing to do with health. Personally, I wear one during the day just because i like how it looks, and I don't wear it too sleep because it can be uncomfortable. The answer is, whatever you feel comfortable doing.|`|s1jUa8eOaa	Different people will tell you different things. Personally, I wear a bra all the time because I feel more comfortable in it, plus I don't want to sag. I've heard it's healthier if you don't wear one, though.|`|mzDS1dnoaa	Healthier? Do whatever is more comfortable, but wearing a bra will not prevent sagging, you can google the causes.|`|ApSDmyttaa	less often its causes breast cancer when you where bras for too long.
rcqi6sSfaa	i googled it and yes there already is a "glamourize" brand<br>  <br>  but you could use<br>  <br>  "sweet treats"<br>  <br>  no one has that one yet<br>  <br>  or you could try naming it<br>  <br>  "FANTABULOUS"<br>  <br>  LoL thtd b a kewl name|`|FU6hZlp1aa	nope im pretty sure its not taken =] good luck!!|`|G1gOfGoUaa	you could google it|`|gqJoae2Uaa	i dont think so|`|oA066Stbaa	no i don't think so. i never heard of it|`|yQF4yldxaa	i like that nameiand no it hasnt been taken i luv it i would buy that just for the name|`|sE2RH0A7aa	that's a dumb name..|`|UgvLTFmSaa	Idnt think it;s taken.

It's funky, but I'm not sure of the actual, proper style.

You're supposed to know what you want before you plan a tattoo.<br>  <br>  If you have to ask people who dont know you, never met you, have no idea what you like or dislike, and dont know whats important or meaningful to you ---- You're not ready for your first tattoo.|`|7b62db8c16688b1a08f7f646af8da44caa	Don't get one until you find a piece of art that you can't live without rather than just something you can live with.<br>  <br>  Do you have a skilled tattoo artist picked out and booked to put this tattoo on you yet?  I would think about those two things before you actually get tattooed.|`|SmPdl2RPaa	A lady playing a guitar I got that tattoo.|`|iMaYLGECaa	erm a coy fish or a dragon they always turn out amazing|`|HS03dAwRaa	don't imagin it when you are 70 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|sOTRIqLCaa	a geisha ?

0LEFco9xaa	Just a suggestion but I don't know what kind of wings but if its angel wings you could do some sort of night thing with the starts and maybe in corporate a moon and instead of getting nautical stars you could color the stars in sliver or blue or some color that represents night. But its whatever you like and want. Just an idea. Good luck.|`|FDgHnvm3aa	Yes, an artist will be able to do the color. you could also add some more like curvy design to tie them in.

5n3Wm0LGaa	I used to wear foundation every day.<br>  <br>  Then, I quit wearing it in the summer, I lived a a VERY humid area so it would just slime off ( ick)  so just in the winter.<br>  <br>  Then, I moved to florida. So I hardly EVER wear it now. I've put it on maybe twice in the last 2 years.<br>  <br>  Odd though-now that I'm older, I need it more. But when I get a tan in the summer, I can do without.<br>  <br>  <br>  I have very sensitive skin, too. especially my eyes. The only foundation that ever broke be out was the hyper allergenic brand , almay.( go figure)<br>  <br>  I wear eye makeup every day.<br>  <br>  I wear MaryKay now They can match up your color perfect. It doesn't clog your pores and covers really well.|`|5Dr5cvkwaa	i now wear foundation every day i go to work or if I got out at night but not on weekends if i don't go out with friends. I never really wore foundation until i hit age 30. <br>  <br>  I do wear Clinique (supermoisture makeup) - love it!|`|Gew6pZhbaa	I wish I didn't have to, but I do use powder foundation on a daily basis. I had acne for years, and after I got rid of it, it left me with redness and dark spots. I feel so self conscious without it.|`|dq16ybzgaa	I wear it everyday. I use boots foundation (it's a UK brand). I have used Clinique foundation and thought it was really good - Clinique Superfit Makeup|`|F57mAkXZaa	try a tinted moisturizer.  it wont be as heavy and will moisturize your dry eczema.  i have it too :(<br>  i currently use mac face and body and i love it!  sheer coverage with moisture.|`|CdBoe8XSaa	yep, everyday|`|c7cJm5oAaa	Yes but only when I wear makeup. Like when I go out, but not for school because i am homeschooled.|`|5LGIrOjVaa	Nope i dont use it|`|vzr1qfQ9aa	I wear powder mineral foundation on a day to day basis, and when I am going out (for a party or a night on the town) I wear a mousse mineral makeup. <br>  <br>  I love mineral makeup, so light and perfect for where I live (Tropical North Queensland , Australia), it is very humid here and most other foundations will just sweat off, but not mineral.|`|qE3ySuMbaa	No...I don't. It makes you look fake. Like a barbie. A lot  of girls at my school wear a bunch and always have it caked on their faces and it doesn't look cute at all. U shouldn't wear it. Most guys like natrual beauty better...or at least they should. =)|`|FT18CiZBaa	yeah i use foundation everyday i use neutrogena's healthy skin enhancer foundation then set it with covergirl loose poweder<br>  <br>  my mom uses clinique foundation she has been using it ever since and she doesnt seem to have a problem with with it  :)|`|CvahPOtNaa	umm..<br>  <br>  nope!<br>  it damages your skin and shows very easily|`|AA11151792	nah i ususally cant be bovered with it|`|7lsU5bcoaa	I wear foundation everyday..

znngp3E0aa	Well, it does hurt. It's not an unbearable pain, but it's more than a pinch. What I do for all of my piercings is go to the piercing parlor really excited like, "Yay! I get my belly button pierced today!" If you do that, then you're definitely more focused on the look of the piercing and not the pain. Oh, and I always close my eyes. :D<br>  <br>  <br>  And it is so worth it!|`|xmo6kILPaa	Okay..To be honest..Mine hurt like a b****!! The guy who did it was really good and professional..also the place was really clean... but i reckon it's just me..I was shaking and swearing and my mum had to hold down my legs to stop me kicking the man lol...I was 13 when i had it done and still am..but after all of that I was and still am soo happy with my belly piercing and it's so fun buying all the bellie bars adn getting compliments from people :) Hope this helped and did'nt scare you as it really looks AMAZING at the end :D xxx|`|1Thb8v1yaa	piercers would rather pierce bigger people than twigs. <br>  to be honest. <br>  <br>  and it reall doesnt hurt that much. people say its a "pinch" and i know thats said a lot but it really is..<br>  <br>  go in and expect it to really hurt...and ull be surprised by how little it actually does. =] its mostly mental.|`|sNr9Od89aa	it hurts a lot when you get it and for about 2 weeks after. the most pain (the actual piercing) is only for two seconds. but beware, it gets really sore and gets infected easily.<br>  good luck on your diet plan and piercing! i hope you do well!|`|81bd6d1d0c0eef55c6c7c2a1f1f1a3ccaa	Piercers prefer bigger women to pierce.  Don't lose weight beforehand.<br>  <br>  The piercing hurts like hell; it was easily the most painful one I've ever had done (and over the years, I had 11 done).<br>  <br>  Think very carefully before getting it done; the navel piercing takes around two years to heal properly, and along the way, you will suffer regular low grade infections.
g6lvm8eUaa	1st one. Straight bangs are good for your face shape. <br>  <br>  Also, your eyes are definitely your best feature!|`|h3VqVwbQaa	I think with the fringe is better, and I think your lips are your best feature.|`|2lzWOi8vaa	fringe.<br>  and your best feature is definately your eyes. they're gorgeous!|`|pVaZty4Maa	i like the second one|`|X3HzsRD4aa	I like it with fringe, because it compliments your face structure.  I think your best features are your eyes and your lips. I also like your nose. Hell, I think your gorgeous all over. I am most definitely jealous. [:|`|zQiDbp7aaa	you look a lot better with side bangs:)|`|SKtQSElAaa	fringe and eyes|`|UyHLvhloaa	The first picture is so much better :) it looks really good one you! and the best feature I'd say is your eyes.
0vlm2OZcaa	You can wear your purple tights and cardigan with your black flats. Also fix your hair on a high side ponytail and if you have bangs, comb it to the side. You can also add a thin headband for effect.|`|nyQMDwWYaa	You should wear the black flats with the purple tights, the shirt, and the cardigan.|`|Ngpy7oOraa	you need to go shoe shopping.|`|A5D62Ycbaa	I think that it maybe a bit too summery at the moment but that depends on the cardigan that you're thinking of too.  I'd say your black boots would be better than your flats and do your hair all messy.  Really not sure about the white tunic though.  Sorry!|`|lENHCv2Waa	Hopefully u can find your other white flat cuz that would look the best but I think the flats with stars would look the best out of the others because the white of the stars would pull the whole outfit together.
YHcOS0Sfaa	heyy. ok my least favorite would have to be New York Color (N.Y.C) Lash Precise.

KwBF3WvGaa	Well if your family and your boyfriend says that your body looks good then I won't bother, but you probably want a celeb body and I am sorry but they pay to have their body to look like that. Enjoy your little body right now while you got it because one day it won't look like that any more and you may have more curves then you can count. So just stay put. Oh there are outfits out there that gives you a tinier waste.|`|d637920478d83ad0f9d926d44957daf6aa	im not sure how you would create curves if your hips/butt dont project out much further than your waist. i would say measure yourself bust-waist-hips then you basically want your waist to be significantly smaller than your bust and hips to have curves. you could do sit ups and just regular exercise for your whole body.|`|lDFYfMz8aa	easily, strength training. go to a gym or if you can't afford that do crunches at home. when you target the muscle area it should help tone you and add a figure. you don't need to loose weight because 125 lbs, seems fine, just do leg squats, crunches or push ups in the morning or evening, every day. dancing will also help too.|`|86fc0a36ed445f3acb8c37c8c987f35baa	You are probably just perfect as you are!  But you could try some of the body shapers with add-ons to make to look a little different for a special occasion.  Remember the models DO NOT LOOK LIKE THAT IN REAL LIFE - it's all air brushing, darling!

F57mAkXZaa	i just started using mac face and body for foundation and it is moist and light so i love it. i think it is about $30<br>  <br>  their eyeshadows are all $15 and worth every cent.<br>  <br>  i LOVE the lipglass and it comes in so many colors!  its about $15 as well i think.  <br>  <br>  i love all their products...you really can't go wrong with any of them.<br>  <br>  check the website for exact prices.<br>  <br>  www.maccosmetics.com
dM1jwSGyaa	sure, you can do nails at home. you'd save $20 a month anyways if you gave up nails, because it would be $50 a month vs. $30 a month. but are we talking about a tanning bed? because you should know better than to do that. there are MANY hazards when it comes to tanning beds. it's better to use bronzer and/or self-tanner.<br>  <br>  hope i helped!|`|bu6BhCnpaa	good choice!<br>  <br>  i look at girls with acrylic nails and its jsut so prissy...mainly becuase you cant do much with them.  tanning actually maeks you look prettier overall versus your hands...<br>  <br>  just keep in mind tanning is not especially good for you...and neither is breathing all that nails stuff...<br>  <br>  i go every 3 months or so to get my toes done...thats it...an im pretty hahh|`|NoMajXUCaa	don't tan... it will RUIN your skin in the end... you should totally keep the nails... get a REAL tan from the SUN if you want to be tan... keep your skin while u can...|`|S1bUkpZ8aa	well i personally think you shouldn't do the tanning and keep the nails for a one reason:<br>  <br>  acrylics wont give you wrinkles, skin caner, leathery skin when you are older<br>  <br>  but if you still wish to tan, then yes i would say definitely give up the acrylics. Tanning will probably make them yellow or orange|`|CvahPOtNaa	ummmmm....<br>  <br>  <br>  yahh forget the acrylics because you are losing more money there than the tan!<br>  ALso a tan looks way better too! so good luckk|`|VtJ5kRgIaa	tanning turns your acrylics yellow.. soo ya.. consider that.

G51N3XFsaa	No. Even laser hair removal will take 10 treatments before the removal is permanent. Just tough it out, and it will be worth it in the long run.|`|6lG6RqC2aa	Yes, its called chemotherapy.|`|MZVvydPBaa	no, but some treatments such as waxing can prevent hair from growing back as quickly as they would with shaving|`|C9r0buA8aa	i dont believe so|`|Lfha91fsaa	nope

THAT ****.<br>  <br>  really? haha :pp<br>  <br>  "From the top of the pole I watch her go down" it's about dancing.|`|RkimYgEtaa	It's about a stripper, she's on a pole and the guy loves it and makes him horny and he pays her for oral sex and she gets oral sex from him too. Hahaha, not sure... <br>  <br>  If you have any questions about this or anything, contact me at;<br>  curleynicole@ymail.com<br>  <br>  Much love.|`|bu6BhCnpaa	its ACTUALLY about a stripper on a pole...doing a pole dance...that is what the "you spin my head right round right round...when you go down when you go down down" part is about...sliding down the pole...<br>  <br>  i know tha tbeicas eof the other lyrics...<br>  <br>  From the top of the pole I watch her go down<br>  She got me throwin my money around<br>  Ain't nothin more beautiful to be found<br>  It's goin down down.<br>  <br>  basically its talking abotu how much money the guy has and how he can pay her to dance...and strip|`|Yx7dBnHIaa	it's about like a girl pole dancing.part of the song goes "from the top of the pole i watcher her go down, she got me throwing my money around.. watching there asses go down.. down. downn" so i'mm guessing thats what it means|`|Pvp36CRyaa	it means he's getting really excited and can't control himself when she gives him a b*ow job.<br>  <br>  "you spin my head right round, right round, when you go down, when you go down down"|`|CvahPOtNaa	uummm..<br>  <br>  as far as i knew it was about dancing?? maybe your friend is kidding|`|wNtBzGGYaa	Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh i thought it was dancing too. hahaha idk maybe your friends wrong.|`|ncFKreBsaa	idk but i just love the song
KwBF3WvGaa	My mom owned a beauty salon and that was a good time. Keep doing what you are doing for a couple more times so you won't get burned. The goggles with out straps are a good idea! Oh and if you want to get a little tanning tattoo is to get little stickers and put on your body. Those are really cute! People who tan consistently get skin problems.|`|kj507W26aa	You can alternate with a bronzer and using a bronzing bed to deepen your color since you are fair skin. You need to develop your base color first before staying in there for 15 -20 minutes each time.   Dont go more than 6-8 minutes because you will be redder than red and hurting in the next 3 -4 days. <br>  The goggles without straps are ok if you can hold them with your eyes. I would buy some with a strap and keep them in your car.<br>  Use the fan, so you wont overheat and feel like passing out. <br>  <br>  I tan, but Im olive skinned.   AND I DONT AND HAVE NEVER TANNED MY FACE!  Maybe thats why I dont have any wrinkles. I wear heavy sunscreen and cover my face with 4 towels and wear my goggles.|`|iAphlpqKaa	its good that you only went in for 8 min. the goggles are perfect for tanning you don't want to get strap marks.<br>  <br>   the only thing i would suggest is putting sunscreen with a low SPF on your chest area because it is always prone to burn easier there.<br>  <br>   i would go in for 8 min again tomorrow and slowly increase your time as you go more often..<br>  <br>  also if you were too warm turn the fan on, but the heat can sometimes make it more comfortable too.. just depends on the person|`|zuUUs2pmaa	Ok Im not going to comment on the cancer thing but I have tanned for a few years on and off just for special events like proms and such. But your experience seems normal just make sure you go to a place that has a cleaner in the room that you can apply to the bed before you get in and then clean before you leave.  and It is fine if the goggles dont have straps, I actually prefer them not too, but also dont get in the tanning bed with contacts in. So your experience was over all normal :)|`|hTtoTbvjaa	dont go back.<br>  take it from someone who IF i could do it over, i never would have stepped foot in one.  they are filthy nasty and can cause cancer.  sorry, i have nothing positive to say about tanning beds.

FDgarm4Zaa	if you go to the doctor, they can usually give you a prescription or something that can get rid of scars.|`|3WeAfZNraa	bio oil works for me<br>  <br>  you can get it on ebay or at walgreens.|`|V01NA68zaa	Do not use bio oil on your face! It contains petroleum based oil, really bad for your skin.<br>  Check out this cream, it's very effective
A5wb4vXYaa	Try 'The Firminator' It's by Soap & Glory and it's really good stuff! I had stretch marks and cellulite on my thighs and butt as well, and although it states that it takes 56 days to completely work and I've only been doing it  for around 2 weeks, I can already see a difference!<br>  <br>  Have a look here: <a href="http://style.sky.com/Beauty/Top_Tens/The_Firminator_Gel/Top_Gallery/609/3112/45/" rel="nofollow">http://style.sky.com/Beauty/Top_Tens/The...</a><br>  <br>  hope this helps :)|`|1TX8wwB8aa	stretch marks can not go away but you can reduce the appearence of them try using vitamin e and cocoa butter or niveas good bye cellulite cream  and you do have to exercise also|`|GjnauqrDaa	me too i got stretch marks on my legs when i was like 12 and 100 pounds so i think its genetics but they fade eventually cellulite idk working out helps i always massage the area with lotion but idk if it works lol|`|KwBF3WvGaa	I use Jergens Ultra Healing for my stretch marks and that works really well and for cellulite I just massage. Massaging isn't fast working it takes a little while.|`|kj507W26aa	Stretch Marks period, whether from losing weight , or giving birth, DO NOT GO AWAY!    If you have a tummy tuck, the majority of them are cut off.<br>  <br>  Cellulite...is hard to get rid off.  Every women, Tyra Banks, has them.., I have some, skinny women have it too.  You can try controlling your high fat intake to avoid them from showing more.|`|KLGtR4vqaa	Go to a salon and get galvanic body and vaccum suction treatment!!|`|86fc0a36ed445f3acb8c37c8c987f35baa	Proper nutrition, drinking plenty of fresh water, little or no alcohol consumption, only 1 or 2 cups of coffee a day, sensible exercise, massage, and techniques to lessen the stress in you life will help the cellulite somewhat.  The other will not go away, but you can moisturize to minimize the marks.  Just think of them as badges of honor earned during living.|`|itiJVgRsaa	I have a C-section scar and stretch marks. After using Bio-Oil all those things disappeared. you don't have to believe me, but the results speak for themselves. you can't even see my stretch marks or scar anymore at all. It's from the UK and you can by it at your local Walgreens. It really works. and for cellulite try the Nivea line. works awesome!! good luck hon.|`|V01NA68zaa	take a look at this|`|FDgarm4Zaa	theres lotions that can get rid of stretch marks.
fmdoGQizaa	It can't make it any worse. Maybe you should buy a better quality hair dye? Or a darker red?<br>  <br>  Good luck ;)|`|SKtQSElAaa	Go to a professional salon and have it re-dyed. <br>  If that's too expensive for you, wait at least 2 weeks before you re-dye it....sorry, I know, I've been in your position before...several times  :-(|`|bKwQyCEHaa	go to the salon and get it dyed|`|NoMajXUCaa	you should go to a salon and get it re-dyed. it wont ruin your hair. and you'll most likely get better results at a salon.<br>  hope i helped!|`|Rir0Iqrgaa	You're screwed.|`|6JardQBdaa	just re dye your hair, it will not ruin it|`|76740ad28a40658e6b40499a8b2cb447aa	Sometimes when you first dye your hair, it comes out a funny color (once I dyed my hair red and it looked orange and when I bleached my hair once it looked yellow) at first. But after you've let it set for a while and wash your hair a couple of times, the true color shows. Sometimes it just takes a while for your hair to adapt to the color. So I'd suggest just waiting a week or so and washing it a few times to see if the color changes. But if not, I think it's perfectly fine to re-dye your hair a week later (I've done it before). But just be sure to use shampoo made for color treated hair and lots of rich conditioner like Pantene to keep your hair from drying out and breaking, which over-dyeing can do sometimes. But as long as it's well maintained, i think it'll be fine to dye it again if you need too. But maybe try a deep/true red or a reddish brown/auburn to try to balance out the the orange.|`|LWovMb3uaa	im not sure if ur hair will be messed up if u re dye it<br>  <br>  but i dyed my hair a light brown a while ago, and it came out sort of orangish too. but its okay, all i had to do was wait a couple of weeks and it look normal now.<br>  <br>  but the reason this might have happened was because you left the hair dye in ur hair too long. [dont worry i made this mistake as well]|`|Q3DKaSyPaa	Go buy another red. I suggest Crimson Red by Creative Images. Dye over it|`|MZVvydPBaa	go to a salon. dying hair at home does not work nearly as well as a salon can do. they can fix your hair issue
