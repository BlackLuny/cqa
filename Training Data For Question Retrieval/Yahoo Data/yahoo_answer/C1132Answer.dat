AA11311675	scars are beautiful, each one has a story :)|`|8rYvWPGVaa	if your scar is lighter then your skin colour, then no a tan will make it show more
AA11311675	The most effective remedy for dark circles is also the most cliche. Thin slices of cucumber applied to your eyes not only helps to lighten the skin, but also soothes and cools the eyes. This can be especially comforting if you've been up late the night before or your eyes are red and tired from allergies or staring at a laptop screen.<br>  <br>  Lay down on your back (because it's easier to balance the cucumber slices that way). Lay thin slices of cucumber on your eyes, making sure they have contact with the skin under the eyes. Leave them on for 5-10 minutes. It's a good idea to set your alarm clock if you're doing this early in the morning. Be careful not to get cucumber juice in your eyes.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  You can also try teabags, the caffeine in tea bags acts as a remedy for dark circles by diminishing puffiness. Caffeine in tea helps to diminish water in the tissues around the eyes (you'll notice that many early eye circle creams contain caffeine for this very reason). In addition, tea contains antioxidants that are beneficial to the skin.<br>  <br>  Take a used tea bag (green, black or white) that's been squeezed out. Make sure it's cool! Leave it over your eyes for about 10 minutes. You'll see a noticeable improvement in puffiness and under-eye circles. Be careful not to get tea in your eyes. <br>  <br>  Herbal tea bags are not useful as a remedy for dark circles, except for chamomile tea. Chamomile is an anti-inflammatory that can help reduce swelling and puffiness.<br>  <br>  hope I helped :)|`|DekGIOImaa	Anything cool to the touch. Cucumbers, used tea bags, washcloth, etc. Place it while you are laying down for about 10 minutes.|`|H6rPxpHWaa	Home Remedies for Dark circles under the eyes :<br>  <br>  ??Home Remedies for Dark circles under the eyes #1: Dark circles may be hereditary for some people or simply a part of the aging process, but most people would agree that they are a struggle to conceal. When the fat pad beneath the eye begins to thin with age, it can create a sunken look to the under eye area. Studies have shown that sluggishness of blood flow underneath the eyes may also contribute to dark circles. Vitamin K has been found to diminish the appearance of these dark circles. A recent study published in Cosmetic and Toiletries, included two groups, one that applied an under eye cream containing sunscreen and another that applied an under eye cream containing a combination of vitamin K and retinol. An examination of the under eye color at the beginning of the study and at the end found a significant lightening in the group using the vitamin K and retinol combination. <br>  <br>  <br>  ??Home Remedies for Dark circles under the eyes #1: Eight hours of sleep is a must for all of us, especially for people having dark circles under their eyes. <br>  <br>  ??Home Remedies for Dark circles under the eyes #2: Close your eyes and cover your eyelids with slices of raw potato or cucumber for 15-20 minutes. Wash with warm water and apply a cream. <br>  <br>  ??Home Remedies for Dark circles under the eyes #3: Grate a cucumber, squeeze to take out its juice and refrigerate. Make a mixture of lemon juice, lanolin cream and cucumber juice and apply around the eye for 10-15 minutes. <br>  <br>  ??Home Remedies for Dark circles under the eyes #4: Apply lemon juice on the black circles 2 times a day. <br>  <br>  ??Home Remedies for Dark circles under the eyes #5: Apply a paste of turmeric powder with pineapple juice for dark circles under the eyes. <br>  <br>  ??Home Remedies for Dark circles under the eyes #6: Apply crushed mint around the eye. <br>  <br>  ??Home Remedies for Dark circles under the eyes #7: Apply almond oil under eyes. <br>  <br>  ??Home Remedies for Dark circles under the eyes #8: Reduce your intake of vitamin A. Over dose of medications such as Retin A produces "excessive" vascularization. <br>  <br>  ??Home Remedies for Dark circles under the eyes #9: Niacinamide, a derivative of the vitamin Niacin, has been shown to be an effective skin lightening agent, especially for skin conditions where hyperpigmention may occur on the face or other visible parts of the body. Patients with hyperpigmentation applied a moisturizer containing five percent niacinamide. After four weeks, the hyperpigmentation and skin color were analyzed by computer and most patients experienced decreased hyperpigmentation and increased skin lightness. Topical niacinamide has also been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties, which makes it a potential treatment for puffy eyes and dark circles. <br>  <br>  ??Home Remedies for Dark circles under the eyes #10: Almond helps to remove dark circles and is an excellent "skin food". Remove the cream applied around the eye after 10 min. No cream should be left on the skin around the eyes for long periods.|`|MiKrWuM6aa	Put cucumbers or used tea bags on your eyes.

Use cover-up for dark circles or blemishes and leave the rest of your skin alone. Use a translucent powder if your skin is shiny, it will get rid of the shine without looking like you are wearing makeup. Less makeup always looks better. All you really need is mascara and eyeliner to bring out your eyes and a little blush to make you look healthy.|`|XCn2dK1laa	You could try eyeliner. I would suggest a wax based pencil one,not the liquid or that crap'll sting when it gets in your eye.Try black or brown and it'll make your eyes more noticeable.

kCdISEGqaa	No one is going to be able to estimate online.  You really should go to the artist you want to do it, and have them give you a price for it.  You're going to have to pay an hourly rate, which varies anywhere from $100 all the way up to $1200 (some of the more highly sought after artists).  With 65 roses, like you want them, you are looking at multiple sessions.  I would estimate anywhere from $1500 - $2000.  I assume you'll want vines, leaves, and all the detail to go with the roses?|`|h59Bc4wfaa	Hmm, I would think that it's going to be pretty costly, but CF is also very important. Esp. when you have someone in your life who suffers from it. So,to me at least, I wouldn't care too much about the cost. You could also see if you could get it comped in some way (maybe even half off) if you have a website that gets a lot of hits and put their logo or a link to their page on it. <br>  <br>  Good luck, hun.|`|Dg0D8SCZaa	all artists have different prices. have a consultation with a tattoo artist before hand, and they will be able to quote you. kind of hard to say on both the cost and time because you don't say how intricate and detailed the roses would be, or if they're in color.|`|Lqdi9Xswaa	if each of the roses were two inches in diameter and you wanted 65 it would take a long time. my friend got a large tattoo on his side and it took 3 hours-cost him 300. if you were willing to make some of the roses smaller then it would be quicker.<br>  <br>  <br>  i'm sorry that cystic fibrosis has touched your life in some way...|`|VuUz8NgKaa	A good bit, where I went and got my tattoo it was close to 100 dollars and it is a 2 inch by 2 inch and it took just over an hour to get it finished. <br>  <br>  I know why you want it and I think it is completely worth all the money it would cost.|`|WLuEIwp5aa	A lot.  Depends on the artist, but it would take a while and be expensive.|`|clInlnIqaa	It all depends on the artist you go to. Every artist charges different prices. Also, it going to be quite lengthy.  Quite expensive too. As to how much, I don't know. <br>  <br>  I understand the meaning of 65 roses, but I'm concerned on how big they are going to be how they will fit. If you get tattoos close together and small like that, they tend to end up in a blob. And for such a meanigful tattoo, you don't want to end up with blobs of ink. How about doing that on both sides of your body. Or extending it a little further down your body so you are able to have them bigger and so they won't tend to blob.|`|yKETwf0gaa	umm, cost varies from artist to artist.  but because its a large tattoo, i would say expect at least 10 or so hours of work, probably in at least two sessions.  and i would say at least 500 dollars, if not more.|`|ajwDOKOaaa	priceless!! haha|`|xnCizA7Daa	free with copulation|`|Hx0a0Q8Uaa	I don't know how much it will cost in NJ but I live in the San Fransisco Bay Area and it would cost you an easy $1400.00 <br>  <br>  <br>  I know tattoos are cool and everything but couldn't the money be better spend, for example, on your special needs child. You should try prioritizing better, in other posts you claim that you barely get by and desperately need child support, but now you are getting a tattoo.<br>  <br>  And I understand that "65 Roses" is what some children with cystic fibrosis (CF) call their disease but I think being there for your son and spending the money on something nice for your son would be a better way of paying homage to him|`|Rr4IVYbvaa	Baddddd idea.<br>  Over time, the ink moves and spreads out, in 15 years, 2inch roses would look like black blobs.<br>  <br>  I suggest getting bigger roses and not so many, as to not ruin the detail.<br>  While 65 may be significant, it's very very very hard to tattoo on a body, especially if you're small<br>  <br>  <br>  Also, most tattooists would EASILY charge $500 plus for that [in Australia]<br>  Someone saying 60 is ridiculous, I paid $60 for a tattoo on my foot which is tiny. $100 is a STARTING price for most places. [And thats cheap as hell]<br>  <br>  It would also take several hours, as the area between the breasts and hips is a] very painful to tattoo and b] the skin between the ribs and hips is very tough and hard to tattoo]<br>  <br>  This would be a very painful tattoo, so if it's your first, I suggest getting a smaller one first, as this is a very long and tedious process to get done.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: If you must get 65, at least get them bigger.<br>  Or in 10-20 years youll have massive black blobs.

GMdSbJV3aa	I have the brush set, both eye palettes (too dolly and lucky tom), 4 lip glasses(fast friends, nice to be nice, nice kitty and mimmy) and one lip conditioner (popster). I love the brush kit, its a great deal compared to how much you would send on each brush individually. The palettes are good but you can find colors very similar if not better for the most part. Plus each one has a normal collection color. but they are fun and definitely worth it if you don't have a ton of colors. Besides the brush kit the lipglass are by far my favorite part of the collection. They seem to look good on everyone i have seen and they reflect some color rather than going on clear.<br>   As for when it ends, it is limited edition, so they only made so much and it is around till it sells out, which as of right now is pretty fast. They make only a certain amount and release it but they don't remake it.  It has been out on the market a little over a week and most pieces are selling out if not already sold out. Most of the accessories sold out the day of release but you can find them on ebay.

Your life is like a cup that is filled to the brim.  No matter how pretty the cup is on the outside (or how expensive, etc.), what is on the inside spills out when you get bumped.  In this case it looks like vinegar from the tone of your question.  Certainly not something to attract guys.  Or think of it like you are like a flower with a bunch of thorns -- nice to look at, but no one wants to get too close.|`|E4pXTZ5Naa	Because looks don't account for much if your personality is crap.<br>  <br>  In other words; he's finds you physically attractive, but he does not find who you are on the inside attractive.|`|TBD6SPaTaa	Hey,99999.  How are you tonight?  Sounds like this kid likes you,But as a friend.  He thinks of you as just a friend and nothing more.  I can relate with this.  Many girls wouldn't go out with me.  They would tell me that I am cute,But they would rather be my friend.  It sucks to get treated like that.  Sounds like his type either is an airhead or a bimbo.  You probably intiminate him,You know?  Don't try too hard.  I know it is difficult if you have a crush on the guy.  Guys hate overly aggressive girls.  Hey,If he seems not interested,Treat him the same way.  See what kind of reaction you get.  If he changes his tune,Then he's a keeper.  If not,I'd forget about him.  You deserve someone that shares your feelings.  Not one that seems like he doesn't care.  That is rude.  Treating someone crudely because they seem interested in us.  We aren't just any kind of friend that you can love,Then leave anytime you want.  We have feelings.  Let this kid know how you feel.  Let him know that it is totally rude the way he treats you.  And if he doesn't change his way,Then to hell with him.  Like I have said before,You deserve someone who will treat you right.  99999,I've gotta stroll.  btw,My name is David and it's an honor to write you tonight.  Have a goodnight tonight and God bless.  Bye for now.|`|5wg7tKc6aa	Just because you're good looking doesn't mean every guy who admits it wants to date you... if that were the case, most girls would be raped every day.

A surgical procedure could remove it, but there would likely be a scar there. If she has health insurance, it could cover it, but I'm not sure.<br>  Some insurance will cover surgeries to fix benign problems ie moles, lipomas. For example, this past December I had a lipoma removed (it's basically a bump under your skin). It wasn't harmful and it didn't hurt, so there wasn't an immediate need to remove it besides to change the appearance. The surgery would've cost $1600 but my insurance covered it entirely. She ought to check out what the doctors say. They can discuss the pros and cons, risks and benefits etc.<br>  <br>  I wish her the best of luck!!|`|XN0sRoqpaa	tell her that no one is perfect, and seriously, guys DONT EVEN CARE about moles on the arm or stuff.|`|qzkWahFeaa	Tell her to see if she can get it cut, electrocuted, burned, or froze off at the doctor's.|`|s8URbvwraa	My Mom Got hers burned off. but it left a nasty scar. a hole very much.|`|qgGRIuRdaa	bkah|`|l8HTrNyIaa	um.

GMdSbJV3aa	MA.C. does not make large brush sets. Occasionally they release limited edition brush sets like the hello kitty 3 piece brush set or holiday 5 piece set, normally around $40-$50. Their brushes are high quality and and reasonably pricey so any brush set with that many brushes would have to be expensive. If not you are more than likely looking at a fake or used set. When i comes to ebay most brushes are fake and about half the makeup is!|`|H6ixrUYLaa	I don't know of any 24 pc. brush sets, but I do know that the majority of MAC makeup on eBay is fake.|`|6aEhPcDAaa	No, MAC has never sold a 24 piece brush set.  Ever.  They sell the occasional brush set for collections or for the holidays, but thats only like 4-5 brushes, definitely not 24.

However, you may have seen a brush ROLL which MAC Artists hold their brushes in, but you can't buy them with brushes, you can only buy the roll.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!<br>  <br>  -Erica

SLEEP FASHION. DREAM BEAUTY.<br>  <br>  try a dress from dior or prada.<br>  i went to a sweet sixteen last month and i got my dress at cavalli.<br>  <br>  <br>  lime green is a deff. nono!<br>  and with hot pink shoes?! you must live in hokey pokey minesokey. <br>  no girl should be forced to wear smthg like that! <br>  DONT LET YRSELF BE A FASHION DISASTER.<br>  in that dress youll forever be made fun of!|`|L5yl3yl7aa	Well it's kinda clashing. <br>  I think I depends what your style is. <br>  I personally would keep it simple with brown shoes. <br>  I like the dress though, very cute.<br>  If your style is more random, then go for the pink shoes, but more sophisticated.. then brown. <br>  <br>  Have fun at the party.|`|smfqWZAcaa	if the dress was all lime green. <br>  and bright pink shoes would look awesome. <br>  but all hot pink nothing in the middle. <br>  and those happen to be my favorite colors<3|`|p7KbhFEeaa	1. yes they are hot pink<br>  2. they would look really good<br>  trust me your not clashing .. its matching, in a great way|`|JG7Dlnm3aa	first off, the dress is okay, not my fav though... but yeah, hopefully no one would be paying too much attention to your feet!|`|e6YTeCTvaa	yeah it would look good|`|07PoKaFOaa	yeah the colors don't really match that well, you should try a plainer color shoes|`|iHdVkECnaa	NOPE!|`|r09yWwhyaa	Yea that looks good.

BduhncGTaa	hm, a really good foundation. <br>  a concealer is meant to hide dark circles under your eyes, blemishes, and scars. <br>  if your foundation doesnt cover up those things. plus, usually foundations that DO cover those imperfections up, are usually really heavy and uncomfortable to wear. so i say just go out and get a concealer at your local drugstore. covergirl and maybelline have some pretty good/cheap ones.|`|3jtg7ATRaa	If you have a bottle foundation and there is some of the liquid dried around the top, use that. It is already the right color for your skin tone and it will have become more solid and therefore like a concealer|`|NAwzuLayaa	If you have a concealer brush, dab it into your foundation and cover up your problem areas. You can use a sponge or your fingers as well. Good luck!|`|Yx7dBnHIaa	a heavy foundation|`|az0Z0DIjaa	Hmmm....A good foundation. And then maybe some pressed powder.|`|XfWoNzXWaa	you really should get a concealer. theyre not just good for covering pimples and such, but undereye circles and as an eyeshadow base and such.

The only kind I like are ones that are more personal. They shouldn't be exposed to the whole world.

If you've been using a dandruff shampoo like that and it's not going away, you may just have a dry scalp which is totally different than dandruff. If that's the case, try rubbing warm olive oil onto your scalp, letting it sit for 30 minutes, then taking a shower to get it out (shampoo twice- it won't all come out the first time). That should get rid of any flaky scalp issues =)|`|rGci1ehoaa	TRY HEAD AND SHOULDERS OR SELSUN BLUE SHAMPOO..

iHna2K7Gaa	If you want to do something different and stand out, then by all means go for it. I personally wouldn't suggest it (I would worry about looking like you have gray hair!), but it's your hair and you're young! Have fun and be spontaneous! You can always dye it back if you don't like it. I've never seen anyone young actually dye their that color, but I've seen people with silver streaks in their hair in hair magazines and stuff.<br>  <br>  If you decide that's too much, I would definitely suggest a dark brown or a platinum blonde. Either would look great on you. :)|`|9ionkBvuaa	Noooo.;|`|RvljVtVWaa	It would look horrid.|`|H6ixrUYLaa	I wouldn't go with that color.<br>  But platinum blonde would look cute.

LBHJaqXoaa	Generally, people apply ointment to their tattoo until it begins to peel. Then they switch to a high qualty scent-free, dye-free, aloe-free, lanolin-free lotion.<br>  <br>  Edit: People have used coco butter before with great results.|`|OXOHoISraa	ONLY until it stops feeling "slimy" which should be  1-2 days.

Sorry I couldnt find the rest for you):<br>  <br>  Eyes:<br>  <br>  The trick with eye makeup is putting on a neutral base ? either taupe, beige, light brown or ivory ? over the lid before applying any color. After the base is in place, accent color using shadows and eyeliners should then be applied to define the eyes. The accent color should match or be complementary to the color of your eyes. Afterwards, cap your eye makeup with mascara. <br>  <br>  <br>  Since you said blue-green eyes, I put both;<br>  For women with blue eyes, blues and slate grays are good accent colors, while medium brown is the perfect shade for the mascara. <br>  <br>  For women with green eyes, greens and plums for accent colors and plum for the mascara. <br>  ______________________________________...<br>  Lips:<br>  <br>  The best lipstick to use for our lips depends, again, on the tone of our skin. You may also want to pick a lipstick for daytime use and another one for nighttime use. To further define the lips, apply a lip liner that matches the color of your lipstick. Lip liners also help keep the color of the lips from bleeding. Another tip to try is to use a lip brush instead of applying the lipstick directly on the lips. This would keep the lipstick from smearing and the color from bleeding as well. <br>  <br>  Fair-skinned women would look great with lips touched with pinks, peaches and mauves. <br>  ______________________________________...<br>  Blushes:<br>  <br>  Moderation is the key to the perfect application of blushers to the cheeks. Blushers are meant to give the face a natural healthy color, and too much can look gaudy and artificial. Again, skin tone should be taken into consideration when choosing a shade for the blusher. <br>  <br>  Bronze, light beige and peach blushers are good for fair-skinned women. On the other hand, fair-skinned women should avoid blushers with too much red or orange in them.
xwm5JZCkaa	1. Using shine control blotting sheets on your face. They are inexpensive and avaible at any drug store, department store and even in the cosmetic area of the grocery store. Brands like Neutrogena and Clean and Clear carry these sheets. During school, work or while shopping, you can duck into the bathroom and blot your face with the sheets. You could also wipe extra greasy areas, like your nose, with a tissue after blotting your face to soak up oil that the sheets missed.<br>  <br>  2. Make sure you wash your face at least twice a day to reduce excess oil (taking a shower counts). <br>  <br>  3. Be aware of what you use on your hair. Leave in conditioners, styling gels, mousse and the like can drip onto your skin, making the condition worse. At night, perhaps take a head band a pull back your hair to protect your skin. Change your pillow case every week. <br>  <br>  4. Use an oil free cleanser, like the Neutrogena ones. Most brands of skin care products carry oil free cleansers, though. <br>  <br>  5. Use a very light moisturizer, like ones that contain salicylic acid. The Aveeno brand carries one. If your skin is super oily, don't moisturize at all. <br>  <br>  6. Before going to bed, pat some baby powder on oily spots, and take care of really greasy areas. In the morning, your skin will look and feel less oily.<br>  <br>  7. When wearing makeup, make sure its make up made for oily skin, like the water based ones. Powder foundations all help when soaking up a little oil. Most brands carry makeup designed for and oily complexion. You can find good makeup made for oily skin from lines like Neutrogena and Cover Girl. Be sure to remove the makeup before bed.|`|BduhncGTaa	i have oily skin too! i hate it!<br>  <br>  first, make sure the face wash/moisturizer you are using has salicylic acid (it helps get rid of excess oil). make sure you wash your face in the morning and at night. try not to wear makeup/hair products to bed. they will get on your pillowcase and make your face produce more oil. & change your pillowcases every 2/3 days.<br>  if you wear makeup, i recommend maybelline pure makeup foundation. its made of mostly water, which helps from your skin getting oily. <br>  <a href="http://www.maybelline.com/Product/Face/Foundation/pure-makeup.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.maybelline.com/Product/Face/F...</a><br>  & clean&clear has these oil blotting sheets, which allow you to soak up extra oil from your face without messing up your makeup. you can keep them in your purse which allows easy access throughout the day. look for them by clean&clear products in the facial cleanser isle in the store.|`|tvbKA4f5aa	Try drinking more water|`|VroLlbhcaa	take a shower|`|az0Z0DIjaa	Try using a cleanser than helps control oil.

yVbguDvbaa	I also have an oily scalp and usually have to wash it everyday but if I'm in a hurry, I toss in a light amount of baby powder on the roots of my hair and use a blowdryer so it's not so obvious.  It works as long as your hair isn't too oily and puts a nice scent in your hair at the same time!|`|NHG8JPIAaa	I have oil hair and I use Prell shampoo.  It last almost two days.  My hair is to the middle of my back and I have to keep it clean.|`|iNgEadpSaa	dont put oil on it duh|`|TO9WPD6Haa	there are many reasons as to why that can happen.<br>  <br>       Use a mild shampoo, shampoo for oily hair, shampoo for dry scalp, or a baby shampoo<br>  <br>       Wash oily hair daily, but concentrate the shampoo on the hair away from the scalp to remove the excess oil from the hair, not on the scalp itself, because this can dry the scalp even more<br>  <br>      * Always rinse your hair thoroughly with cool or lukewarm water, because soap residue can make oily hair worse<br>  <br>      * Use a hot oil treatment directly on the scalp itself, gently massaging the oil into the scalp and then rinsing the oily hair thoroughly afterward<br>  <br>      * If hair is very oily, do not use conditioner at all, or use conditioner only on the tips or ends of the hair<br>  <br>      * Oily hair is likely shiny enough, so avoid using hair gloss gel or shine hair care products on oily hair<br>  <br>      * For extremely oily hair, a vinegar rinse, comprised of one (1) part vinegar to four (4) parts water can help remove oil from your hair, but be sure to avoid using vinegar on the scalp<br>  <br>      * Don’t brush oily hair frequently, because brushing oily hair can actually cause the scalp to produce more oil<br>  <br>      * Don’t rub or scratch your scalp when you have oily hair, because stimulating the scalp like this can produce more oil<br>  <br>      * Diluted lemon juice can provide similar results to the vinegar rinse for oily hair with a much more pleasant scent<br>  <br>  Shampoo that contains tea tree oil can work well for alleviating dry scalp, if dry scalp is the primary cause of the oily hair.|`|c6FrTkFRaa	i get the same!<br>  You can get a dry shampoo in the shops that obsorbs the oil on your hair from shops such as superdrug [if your in the uk].. boots..<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.superdrug.com/bin/venda?ex=co_wizr-locayta&template=wz_locayta&pageno=1&perpage=10&collate=ivtype%3Aprice%3Acat%3Abrand&fieldrtype=type&termtextrtype=invt&typertype=exact&fieldbrand=brand&typebrand=exact&termtextbrand=&fieldpcatid=pcatid&typepcatid=exact&termtextpcatid=&fieldprice=price&typeprice=rangefilter&pricerange=&typekeywordsearch=keyword&termtextkeywordsearch=dry+shampoo" rel="nofollow">http://www.superdrug.com/bin/venda?ex=co...</a>|`|eqCfPDpRaa	try a good clarifying shampoo .. and only put conditioner on the ends of your hair .. never put it at the top of your scalp .. and when its still wet .. put some bronzer (like the make up) to the roots of your hair .. but just a little or it will look weird .. hope i helped :D|`|rGci1ehoaa	use a good shampoo and conditioner..... dont believe all of the commercials you see on tv!!

I'm not sure what moisturizers your using but try to use lotions specifically for you face and ones primarily for dry skin.

WAVYc8Imaa	It all depends on where you are going. Usually there are monthly specials that you can choose from or first time customer specials!  It also depends on the amount of minutes you want. Most times you buy the packages based on the minutes you want and the type of bed you are in. There are different levels of beds that tan or brooze, etc.! I would advise you to look into the tanning places in your area and compare prices to find one within your price range! Good Luck!|`|arXGZ9LMaa	It costs a lot less than your medical bills will be when you get skin cancer.<br>  <br>  I'll be nice and answer though: different times don't matter, you usually pay a flat monthly rate, like 30.00 a month, and get unlimited tanning for 30 days. Different salons have different packages, example: 10 days of 20 minute tanning for 15.00 or whatever. Check at your local salon.

21158617a7c0215f388e090d352d6fe9aa	We used to, until we figured out that you can use WAY less conditioner than you are used to and get the same result.....|`|QmOfd5evaa	yeah, my house too. i think its because we use a whole lot of conditioner, but not too much shampoo.|`|jtYL9Qqnaa	Lol yeah.|`|TO9WPD6Haa	yes, that is because the conditioner is alot lighter than the shampoo so there is alot of air that gets trapped into the bottle making it look like there is more conditioner than there actually is, that is why your bottle usually dent when you take the conditioner out, as all the air come out by squuezing out the conditioner, so there is actually more shampoo than conditioner.<br>  hope that answered your question|`|E70A7aqcaa	Since the only conditioner I use is already in the shampoo, I can't run out of one before the other.

Also some products will make the conditioner bottle smaller to make more money.|`|YlFu9r3uaa	yes, because the shampoo is thinner than conditioner so more fits into a bottle, and conditioner is thicker so there is less than the shampoo<br>  <br>  also people use more conditioner than shampoo

kCdISEGqaa	Wearing shoes probably pulled the scabs too soon.  Give it another 30 days and see how it looks.  It's best to wait two months after a tattoo to get it touched up.  Best wishes!|`|NhOQ3mRxaa	Ask you're tattoo artist that did it or a tattoo artist have them look at it!<br>  Faith Trust & Pixie Dust,<br>  Chelsie|`|LBHJaqXoaa	You don't say how long you have had the tattoo but it takes a good 4 weeks until you know for sure how they are going to look. <br>  <br>  Assuming you've had it 3 or 4 weeks, it sounds to me like you will need a touch up. Sometimes it takes 2 times to get the black to be even and uniform in color. <br>  <br>  Lotion won't make it lose it's color unless it was scented or dyed. Aloe and lanolin also make the tattoo fade while healing. As long as you used a unscented, dye-free, aloe-free, lanolin-free lotion on it, it should be fine. <br>  <br>  Keep using lotion on it because I don't think its healed all the way. Remember, it takes 4 weeks before you can judge what it's going to finally look like. If it's still funky after 4 weeks, call the shop and make your touch-up appointment.|`|iU4Q2GOdaa	NEVER scratch at it! you can produce permanent scarring over the body art, not to mention you can ruin the design and require more touchups than if youd just let it heal.<br>  i say keep with the lotion if most of it has already peeled (except where YOU peeled it off!), no, its not what caused discoloration. it does look funky because its healing, and on the foot its very highly probable you have to get a touch-up. dont worry about these things, its still too soon.  but good for you getting an artist that will do free touchup work!|`|69hjhpYqaa	you kept your tattoo too moist during the healing process, causing bubbles. bubbles cause fading of color. touching up will help, but wait a few months until your new tat is totally healed.|`|U7oJrc3faa	If the color is fading.|`|WLuEIwp5aa	Wearing shoes is probably the main culprit.<br>  <br>  Wait until it's warm enough to wear flip flops for at least two weeks straight before you try to get it touched up.
GKJV2EBSaa	To have two or more different hair styles this is what you need to do.<br>  To do this with one computer open up two windows.On one of the windows, log in. Go to Meezmaker and click the item you want. Don't press save! Then log in on the other window and again, go to meezmaker and select the other item you want. Now this is the tricky part, you have to press the little square button in the corner at the top, by the minimize button. Drag it to the bigger Meez screen and get both save buttons as close together as possible. Then once it's good enough, press the save buttons as FAST as you can. So it will save both hairstyles.It is very tricky to do so you will have to try it a couple of times.<br>  Hope this helps you!|`|A3zAXntxaa	Open two windows on your computer, find one hairstyle you want on the first, and the other hairstyle on the other. Then when you're done, put them next to each other and click save at like the same time, good luck.|`|ejelObdJaa	which ones do u want ?<br>  <br>  EDIT: ohh my b... i didnt know that was a website.. but i dont kno how to use it..|`|iQ2hMr09aa	wat?

Before, I considered my hair to be thinish/meduim. And now after I dyed it actually looks thicker for some reason. Like the individual strands look thicker.

lKcRxJ1Xaa	The price of amethyst is based on clarity, depth of color, secondary colors like purple with blue or red secondary colors. and very important is the quality of cut.  Price range is from $2-50 per carat.  See moregems.com for some pictures of finer quality amethyst.  <br>  <br>  To get an idea of quality of cut look for chips and polishing marks on the facets. How flat or mirrorlike are the facets.  Is there a window, can you look through the table of the gem and read the newspaper through the back of the gem.  Is the stone symetrical.|`|XrcZkt6Haa	Is you stone real or fake? Is any inclusion inside? If the purple amethyst is of high quality, the 5.5ct would cost about $200; if it is not real and not of high quality, the price would go lower.|`|JSwO2hRqaa	You should check this website:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.shopgemstones.com/amethyst.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.shopgemstones.com/amethyst.ht...</a><br>  <br>  Go through all the pages about amethyst and compare your amethyst to the photos there, and it will give you a sense of how much it could be worth.  Of course, finding a buyer for it is a different problem altogether...

Oh, and the peace sign is like the biggest cliche, yet everyone does it in all their pictures.

QikvnTnqaa	Well. I've never had a septum piercing. But I have my upper ear pierced a few times and if I don't put earrings in they do close eventually. I had to re-pierce them once. :D So I'm sure it will be the same. <br>  <br>  My ears close after about a month or two and there wasn't any problem with it. If it hasn't  fully healed yet from getting it pierced then it will be faster. Puss is a sign of infection. So if that happens. That's bad.

SRqIIuwOaa	Bronzers and spray on tans (done professionally) are your best bet. But honestly you will look more orange then tan. Anyone can tell the difference between natural and fake tans. Its dark at dances anyway. Bronzers also have the tendancy to rub off (even if they say they wont) and that will piss off whoever you dance with. Besides pale girls are hot.|`|uYDoPNv9aa	Bronzers. There are some bronzers you can purchase that will give you the look of being tan without even stepping outside. They usually do not work as fast as a spray on but will eventually get you darker. <br>  Step6If you are a women, you could try getting a darker base or powder. But be sure you don't get anything too dark or your face will not match the rest of your skin. <br>  Step7Also try wearing lighter colors. Wearing lighter colors can give you the effect that you are tanner compared to wearing a dark shirt. Typically a black will make you look paler.|`|x4HwY3Nwaa	Well tanning lotion obviously, but you may tend to look orange. I also have to say that truthfully the tanner isn't that bad for you. If you were to look up the pros and cons, you'll discover its only dangerous if you overuse it. Its really not much worse than going out and laying in the sun, and it can be better because you can control the amount of rays you're being subjected to. And fair skin really isn't that bad. =)|`|rCWc7m3Iaa	I would just suggest to you to not worry about it, really.<br>  fair complections are much more atractive than somebody who looks orange.<br>  <br>  and if its gonna be a dance then its not like theyre gonna have bright lights on you anyways|`|dk4ut2Bjaa	aveeno tanning lotion|`|ZHBNz6D2aa	neutrogena has a really good spray tanner|`|InslW3QMaa	tanning spray but not to much or you will turn orange|`|I4wuyQGWaa	a bronzer.. but dont overdo that cause then youll look blochy and trashy if you dont put it on right|`|BFaesIpeaa	use Jergen's self tanner lotion. Start off with light, then go to dark. It works in like 1-2 weeks, and you look naturally brown and not orange!

Good luck!|`|h0UUG7MAaa	tanning lotion works great ! <br>  make sure you read the bottle first <br>  if you have fair skin get the one for fair skin it will tell you on the bottle if you don't it will turn you orange :) ha ha i know from experience it sucks <br>  <br>  here's a link for the one i like <br>  <a href="http://www.sephora.com/browse/product.jhtml?id=P187413&categoryId=B70#moreInfo" rel="nofollow">http://www.sephora.com/browse/product.jh...</a><br>  <br>  but you don't have to get it from sephora <br>  you can get it from anywhere these days :)<br>  haha try wal-mart if you can't go to sephora <br>  or if your american target :)|`|v0FlUan0aa	aveeno has some tanning lotion that you put on and your skin will gradually tan itself. or you could go top sephora and get some spray|`|0405893528ec8866808fd4b76dad4bd1aa	you could go 'spray tanning'<br>  its like a tanning bed,<br>  but you lay in a bed,<br>  and it sprays tanning lotion in spray form all over you.<br>  and it looks kind of like this when its done:<br>  <a href="http://mobiletanningsolutions.com/yahoo_site_admin/assets/images/spray_tan.30164327_std.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://mobiletanningsolutions.com/yahoo_...</a><br>  <br>  and its not that fake.<br>  plus you can get different shades,<br>  and its harmless to your skin.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  but if you don't want that.<br>  just go buy an indoor tanning lotion at walmart, target, or walgreens and rub that all over your body, [but it might make you have blothches, because you can't rub it on perfectly, so i would recomend the spray tan]<br>  <br>  but here are some indoor tanning lotions:<br>  <a href="http://www.otcwholesale.com/hawaiian-04438.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.otcwholesale.com/hawaiian-044...</a>|`|9FhAZC30aa	uhhmm sorry but tanning beds are the only way to get tanned FAST!<br>  or u culd try self-tanning lotions, special cream to get ur body toned and shave... but iunno cuz its winter in north america so noone is tanned here rite now. i unno where u live so good luck wif that|`|ArFFUPTBaa	Bronzer?:)|`|hkTwclOsaa	you could use bronzer or spray tan

Then sew it to be that measurement and cut off the extra part. Make sure that when you pin it the extra fabric's on the inside.<br>  <br>  Someone suggested to buy it from the girl's aisle. That's a good idea, too. I and other girls I know love it when guys do that. We call them "girl pants," especially when they're brightly colored. If you have very thin legs, I suggest you don't make them too skinny, but with little rolls as you go up the leg.

Make-up enhances features greatly, so that may be a problem. <br>  <br>  Eating well, and having a good skin care regime often help (There are skin care lines specifically for men!) Hair cuts also make a world of difference, and it is no longer uncommon for guys to put colour in their hair if they want. <br>  <br>  Clothing often plays a big role in outer apperance too, but remember- the most important part of you is what is inside. First impressions are mostly visual, so have a friendly demeanor, and the battle is half won! <br>  <br>  Hope this helps?|`|JVYs2TCpaa	kkkkk

C9FHwL3Kaa	Ok when you use any eyeshadow you want to choose a medium shade in any color that you choose. It will bring out your eye color. Your eyeliner you should choose a brown eyeliner. You need to use a crayon type not a pencil. When you put on eyeliner you need to pull the bottom of your eye out with one hand then you need to take the eye liner and rub it on the bottom of your eye. If you have any other question please email me i put on make up all the time so just email me ok?|`|XPDc0H6Haa	youtube youtube youtube.<br>  search ANYTHING you need to know on there and you're more than likely to find it.<br>  <br>  and if you can't, then practice my friend. learn the hard way ;)|`|oEU9mCe1aa	try youtube! search for pretty much anything. they got it all.<br>  one tip i wish i knew when i first started wearing makeup:<br>  get a little bit LIGHTER color cover up than your skin tone. darker colors make you look oily and like you have an uneven tan on your face.<br>  <br>  and dont overuse the eyeliner. it looks shitty when you put it on to thick. i suggest youtube for everything.|`|SXm75cZtaa	Well, its kinda hard without knowing your skin type. So here is some tips for ALL types. <br>  I hope it helps:<br>  <br>  Eye makeup. The trick with eye makeup is putting on a neutral base ? either taupe, beige, light brown or ivory ? over the lid before applying any color. After the base is in place, accent color using shadows and eyeliners should then be applied to define the eyes. The accent color should match or be complementary to the color of your eyes. Afterwards, cap your eye makeup with mascara. <br>  For women with blue eyes, blues and slate grays are good accent colors, while medium brown is the perfect shade for the mascara. <br>  <br>  For women with green eyes, greens and plums for accent colors and plum for the mascara. <br>  <br>  For women with brown eyes, greens, bronzes and golds for accent colors, while blue for the mascara. <br>  <br>  <br>  Lip colors. The best lipstick to use for our lips depends, again, on the tone of our skin. You may also want to pick a lipstick for daytime use and another one for nighttime use. To further define the lips, apply a lip liner that matches the color of your lipstick. Lip liners also help keep the color of the lips from bleeding. Another tip to try is to use a lip brush instead of applying the lipstick directly on the lips. This would keep the lipstick from smearing and the color from bleeding as well. <br>  Fair-skinned women would look great with lips touched with pinks, peaches and mauves. <br>  <br>  Lipsticks with gold, pink with a touch of gold, peach and light to medium brown best complement olive-skinned women. <br>  <br>  Dark-skinned women should go for lipsticks shaded bronze, medium browns, brick browns, berries and burgundy. <br>  <br>  <br>  Blushers. Moderation is the key to the perfect application of blushers to the cheeks. Blushers are meant to give the face a natural healthy color, and too much can look gaudy and artificial. Again, skin tone should be taken into consideration when choosing a shade for the blusher. <br>  Bronze, light beige and peach blushers are good for fair-skinned women. On the other hand, fair-skinned women should avoid blushers with too much red or orange in them. <br>  <br>  Women with olive skin tones would do well with bronze, apricot and light pink. <br>  <br>  Women whose skin tone is medium brown should stick to medium pink, peach and light copper. <br>  <br>  Rusts, berries and burnt orange are perfect for women with dark-toned skin. <br>  <br>  Just to stress, skin tone and eye color are important factors to consider when choosing the right makeup. Of course, you can always experiment on colors, but when all else fails, these colors always work. <br>  <br>  The website below is a life-savor!!|`|KG6E5sTTaa	check out you tube they have great tutorials.

Too big in my hand.<br>  <br>  Also, Maybelline makes a mascara called Volume Express that has the fibers built in to one side. But to me the brush is too short and I have a hard time applying it to my left eye! <br>  <br>  If it's definition you want, I love Lash Exact by CoverGirl, but only for the brush.

Anyways, as far as dresses goes, I have to get one like right now so I recommend Macy's, Express, JCP, Kohl's and Dillard's. Those are on the cheap side. As far as weight loss, take up some sports, or have a regular exercise routine and eat wholesome meals. Here's some tips I found on google:<br>  Nutrition<br>  <br>  1. Avoid fried food -- All that fried oil is like a blanket of fat which goes to your belly and covers your abs.<br>  <br>  2. Avoid sugary drinks -- All that artificial sugar is quickly converted to fat.<br>  <br>  3. Avoid trans fats (unhealthy processed fats) -- Check each article of food that you buy in the supermarket to see whether it contains trans fats. If it does, forget about it for 2--3 weeks.<br>  <br>  4. Avoid un-complex carbs -- white bread, regular rice, regular pasta and other pastries are full of empty calories which give you little energy and are quickly converted to fat by your body. Eat whole flour or wheat bread, whole rice, pasta made from whole wheat, and avoid useless pastries.<br>  <br>  Fitness<br>  <br>  1. Avoid regular cardiovascular activity -- Most people do continuous cardiovascular activity at a regular pace for a long time. This is a mistake. By doing interval cardio activity, you will burn much more fat and bring out those sexy abs.<br>  <br>  2. Avoid doing crunches and sit-ups -- These kinds of low intensity exercises do little to develop your ab muscles. They also waste your time and you'll need to make excellent use of every minute of it in order to get a flat stomach in 2--3 weeks.<br>  <br>  3. Avoid focused workout routines -- Invest your time in full body workouts. These kind of workouts are much more strenuous and so will burn a lot more fat from your entire body in general and your stomach in particular.<br>  <br>  4. Avoid workout machines and gadgets -- working out with free weights or barbells is much more effective. These kinds of exercises will develop your body and cut down on your body fat much faster than workout machine exercises.<br>  <br>  If you follow these 8 nutritional and fitness tips, you will see fast results. In 2--3 weeks, your stomach will be flatter.<br>  <br>  Oh and I forgot about the tan! I think olay (with a touch of tan or something) is good and also most any tanners there is. BEWARE of over using it, you'll look orange and streaky. But honestly I recommend that you sun bathe naturally with oil when you move...it's so much more prettier and natural.

8uqixdQfaa	Well.. I believe it depends on what type of mascara you use.<br>  But be careful I suggest not to use waterproof mascara if you aren't even going to be around water.It's usually difficult to get off and you could pull some of your eye-lashes off. If you only have a few they could get very thin. I also suggest wearing eye liner on top of the eye and bottom. It makes the eyes look darker and depending if you put it on right your lashes may look longer and thicker. *note*If you have blonde eye-lashes use black mascara.|`|DBYxsNe2aa	you have to be born with them.

kMGmnOHyaa	As far as makeup goes, just put the eyeliner on thicker and make sure u don't forget the bottom. But don't put it on too thick on the bottom. Then when you're done, meet the bottom and top liners in a point just outside the real point of your eye.(But you can extend that farther out as far as you like.)<br>  Tips:Black would work best.<br>  Tips:Extending the point farther makes it more dramatic.<br>  *Make the point out farther for a party, and not as far for school.<br>  <br>  I'm not to great with hair, but if it is the wavey look you are going for then just sleep with your hair in a loose braid and when you wake up it should be slightly wavey. You could also use moose when you get out of the shower and scrunch it while it is wet.<br>  When you do want the wave in your hair, don't brush it. Just pick out the underneath of it.|`|zvN64drnaa	thats a wig.<br>  and i cant really see her makeup since the picture isnt close up,<br>  but its probly eyelinerr on top and bottom lids<br>  and winged out.|`|xuvqrnOoaa	her hairs blow dyed n messed up but she fixed her bangs n sprayed them to the side,,, her makeup is pretty low key so i would just use foundation ... rim your eyes some mascara n some lipglossin..... hope i helped
VHaSKFC2aa	If a push-up bra is not working for you I would suggest a water bra. Theres two different types, the filled and unfilled. With the filled its a kind of jelly in the cups of the bra (though between the fabrics). And the unfilled, which you would fill up yourself with water, depending on how much OOMF you want. Good Luck :)|`|WFRyzodFaa	Okay well you can get a push up bra at Victoria Secret. But that is really expensive.

Works for me!|`|FlKrA3nEaa	put some mouse in and let it air dry or dry with your blowdryer and a diffuser..its an attachment for the dryer.<br>  <br>  but DEFF put some mouse and smoothing serum or even leave in conditioner/spray would do well.|`|1IOhXY6caa	dry it normally and then use a ceremic straightener to get the puff out.  if you want curls then, use a curling gel or curling iron<br>  <br>  answer mine<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AnEI6iNlZ8mLGVyArDmWkjkazKIX;_ylv=3?qid=20090222144025AA0FcpW">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|TXle1mjQaa	here are my steps (btw i have hispanic hair) wash,condition, curlers, blow dry, then i becomes straight|`|VNbmDjCRaa	i don't know my hair is just like that|`|9he87O1Haa	It might just be the texture of your hair, but you could try putting oil/grease in it while it's still wet, then styling it.

g2Actp1Eaa	honestly, i cant stand the faux-hawk, it makes people look like posers. if you are going to get a mohawk, you may as well get it done properly. and it looks so much better than fake. and if you dont like, it will grow back. also, id keep the hawk long, the best and easy way to style it is hair lacquer and a blow-dryer, while spraying the hair with the lacquer, blow dry it. the lacquer dries alot faster and stops the hair from "bending", if you know what i mean.<br>  good luck|`|4M9gnZMDaa	yes if you really want something new for a change. and if your gf likes it go for it! =] your hair will grow back to normal eventually

Use a deep conditioner once a week. Also, my daughter was having some dry scalp issues, so i put vitamin E oil on her roots for about 10 minutes and it made her hair sooooooo nice. You just have to make sure to wash it out completely otherwise you'll look greasy. <br>  <br>  Also use a flat iron spray, I got a really good one at the cheap salon at the mall, it wasn't expensive and it smell amazing. <br>  <br>  Get regular trims, every 4-6 weeks, your ends are FAR more prone to breakage than the root or shaft......|`|W6gD9EkQaa	Get a trim, and use hair protector for heat before you straighten your hair!<br>  When it is no ABSOLUTELY necessary to straighten your hair, don't do it. <br>  Use A lot of conditioner, and if that doesn't help go to a hair stylist and get help. <br>  I had really dry frizzy hair and I went to a hair stylist and they put these things called "shades" in my hair to match my natural hair color, but it made my hair REALLY smooth and shiny. <br>  The shades wash out over time, but make your hair look really nice.|`|QdBv6hh2aa	try getting a straightening blow dryer, its not as hard on the hair and if you can still use your straightener for a few wavy parts.<br>  To get rid of split ends you should cut them off, there a lot of cool shoulder length hair styles.

VHaSKFC2aa	Ink that is used for doing the tattoo permiates the upper layers of the skin, so its below the layers that would get hot when you're angry.

ZCSiACaBaa	there's not really a difference between using a bar or a ring.<br>  it all depends on how the piercer pierces you or where you get it done.<br>  some piercers prefer using rings and others like bars.<br>  bars also tend to be a bit more expensive.<br>  <br>  i found the bar was better then my friends who got rings.<br>  their rings got caught on clothing and stuck into them when they laid on there stomach and sometimes you can see it through clothing.<br>  but a bar lays flat against you...you cant see it...it doesn't catch on anything very much and it doesn't hurt if you sleep on it.<br>  <br>  well i hope i helped.<br>  and good luck with your new piercing.<br>  make sure to take care of it:)|`|c5anDswjaa	Well, the ring is circular with a bead on it, and the bar is what you see in most bellybuttons, a curved barbell..

It's a dollar or two more than CoverGirl of Maybelline, but it is well worth it. My eyelashes look so long and thick and almost FAKE!|`|T959zDizaa	CoverGirl LashBlast!!! not the waterproof though, because that stuff will not come off even after a shower and sleeping through the night... it takes days to come off. i don't recomend the new pink bottle of shimmer mascara from covergirl though... not much shimmer... so stick to the orange bottle of Covergirl LashBlast|`|sK9waPqyaa	covergirl test on animals :(<br>  <br>  i like mac and victoria jackson for mascara oooh and dior!|`|16o6qrtdaa	covergirl has always worked for me and i hav short little eyelashes and covergirl make them super longg|`|mLIYcBQqaa	Mac or Maybelline|`|G9831g5Baa	Covergirl is the shiz|`|8a5c549ea7fffbe40a9a737812632ec8aa	loreal voluminous|`|SXm75cZtaa	Maybelline.

WLuEIwp5aa	Once you're 18, you can go apprentice under an experienced piercer.  You'll probably also have to take courses on blood borne pathogens, public health, and infection prevention in order to receive a license, depending on the state or country you're in.<br>  <br>  And I would never, ever, ever let someone pierce me who got their qualifications over the internet.  You learn by watching and doing, not by reading crap on the internet and looking at pictures.  If you want to be a respected piercer in the US, you need to become a member of the APP, and they will not accept you as a member without having apprenticed first.|`|bAYVSfdJaa	No.  You need to be 18, first of all.  And you need to actually go into a studio to get an apprenticeship.
uZLVn9fRaa	i had the same problem i started using dr.miracle..it worked ...uumm...i forgot the name of the specfic product so u can go to <a href="http://drmiracles.com/home.php" rel="nofollow">http://drmiracles.com/home.php</a>   then click on hair types and she shows u videos and reccomends what u need try it it works very godd...VOT ME BEST ANSWWER PLEZZ|`|iPje1iyGaa	The only cure for split ends is to cut them off, but if you want to do your best to keep them away try these:<br>  <br>  1. don't brush your hair when it's wet, because that is when it is most vulnerable<br>  2. cut down on any stylers that require heat (blow dryers, straighteners, etc.)<br>  3. buy a natural bristle brush that won't snag hair and pull at it, thereby creating split ends<br>  4. wear a hat to minimize sun damage<br>  5. use a shampoo that lists sunscreen as a major ingredient (Paul Mitchell Color Protect or Redken Color Extend, for example)<br>  6. condition after shampooing and use a deep conditioner once a month<br>  7. try a split hair repair product. it won't actually repair the split ends you have, but it will reduce the "fly-away" look<br>  <br>  And most importantly, trim your hair every 6-8 weeks.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps :)|`|iNXGb3jUaa	the best way to get rid of split ends is to cut them  but to prevent it from happening you can use tresemme anti breakage shampoo and conditioner trust me it works I high light my hair all the time and believe me this stuff is great you can get it at wal-mart or any store I get it at wal-mart|`|xV2AsD2daa	You can get a product called "it's a 10"miracle leave-in product. You spray it on damp hair and leave it in then style as usual. It will take a couple weeks to a month to really tell a difference.|`|evK2CD6Faa	use a cholesterol treatment by queene  helene at least twice a month trust me you'll see a big difference.|`|BMbUfjhaaa	kill yourself|`|ZHJuK1QNaa	Honestly the only way to get rid of a split end is to cut it off.  But there are products that can help keep your healthy once the splint ends are gone.  If you are tinting, bleaching or chemically straightening your hair; that may be the reason for the damaged ends. So do that less often. I would deep condition your hair:<br>  For the best results I would do the following.  Shampoo your hair and lightly towel dry.  Apply the conditioner and comb it through your hair using a wide tooth comb.  Your hair is more fragile when it is wet, so using a fine tooth comb will cause breakage. Place a plastic cap over your hair, if you do not have a plastic cap you can wrap your hair with plastic wrap.  Wet a towel with hot water, not hot enough to burn because you need to wring out the towel.  Wrap the wet/ hot towel around your hair.  The more often you re-wet and warm the towel the better the results.  If you can keep this on your hair for up to thirty minutes your hair will benefit. Rinse your hair in warm water, followed by a cool rinse.  The cool rinse will smooth the hair cuticle and help seal in the moisture.  If you shampoo your hair daily you can do this once a week. If you shampoo your hair less often you can do this twice a month. You can have too much of a good thing.  <br>  If you blow dry your hair, use straitening or curling irons you should also use a product that you leave in your hair that will protect your hair from the heat.  The best have a silicone base, that will coat and protect your hair with out building up on your hair. If you are looking for the best professional products I would suggest Matrix Biologe or Pureology.  Both of these lines are sold in salons, to find a salon in your area that sells these products you can go to;<br>  www.matrix. com  or<br>  www.pureology.com <br>  There you can research there different lines.  <br>  I'm sorry I don't know store brands, but I'm sure they have some that are comparable. <br>  also if you use hair spray make sure that doesn’t have alcohol in it as that will dry out your hair.  A lot of sprays contain alcohol to help the spray dry faster, but it is not the best thing for your hair.<br>  I hope this helps!<br>   <br>  P.S. some people don’t care for the smell of the Pureology products (they don’t add perfumes) make sure you like the smell before you purchase them.

Dg0D8SCZaa	that sometimes happens if you bump it or it catches on something during it's initial healing phase. clean it like normal and be careful with it, no touching. if it persists, see your piercer.

4BBjhHAnaa	Embrace your bust!!!  I am the same size and I love my cleavage.<br>  <br>  However, I fully understand and commiserate with your problem.<br>  Clothes just aren't made for busty women-- they're usually meant for small-chested girls.  It is possible to find clothes that look good on you.<br>  <br>  <br>  Never wear anything with a high neck, especially not a turtle neck.  It will make your bust look bigger and make you look wider over all.<br>  <br>  You don't need to have your cleavage popping out all over the place (though I personally enjoy it (:   )  but you should wear a collar that exposes some expanse of skin.<br>  <br>  Tailored clothes are also very helpful.  Try wearing blazers and vests.  They will accentuate the narrowness of your waist, despite your bust.  <br>  <br>  Layering shirts of different lengths is also helpful to accentuate your real body shape, rather than the illusion your bust can create.<br>  <br>  Finally, shirts that have darting or a band on the waist, just under the chest, can help to keep you looking thinner.|`|AV0eejfLaa	Theres minimizer bras at Victoria's Secrets don't get em anywhere else because others will give you that smushed boob look|`|cfduV3xbaa	I have the same problem...

I was a dancer so I started applying my own show makeup at that age.<br>  I started wearing makeup daily at the age of 11, I learned from my older sister and youtube, if you go on youtube and just search makeup for beginners,  or neutral makeup you will find some great tutorials.<br>  Some of my fave makeup gurus on youtube are:<br>  Makeupgeektv<br>  Makeupbytiffanyd<br>  Allthatglitters21<br>  xsparkage<br>  jjacks48<br>  julieg713<br>  Petrilude<br>  and misscheivous<br>  I am now 15 going on 16 and planning to be a makeup artist when i get older.<br>  My makeup is substantial. I babysit and buy more every month. I have everything from revlon and loreal to MAC and clinique. I pretty much now every different technique for applying makeup that there is. I know all of the best products, I can tell you what I think of a product in two seconds. Yeah, I have an obsession, but its something I am passionate about and its something that makes me happy. Plus I am good at it. I went to a MAC counter once and all of the girls who were working there asked me who did my makeup and were shocked when I said it was me.<br>  Yeah.<br>  Hope I helped.<br>  If you are looking for good must-haves for a beginner just e-mail me, I can help you out no problem.|`|1WNOQXVlaa	I didnt really start wearing make up until like my Junior year of high school when I was 16. I just wear eyeliner, mascara and chapstick.  I always had a ton of makeup that I used to play around with, and practice makes perfect.  I suggest buying eyeliner and mascara and maybe eyeshadow that is a little darker than your skin tone, and just mess around with it when you can wash it off afterwards. It takes a few times to perfect, but its not that hard. It shouldnt affect your skin if you wash it off every night. Im just about 18 now. And my mom didnt teach me anything, so dont feel like your missing out on something big.|`|ov5F2Fmnaa	i am so sorry for you but you can try watching make up tutorials or ask your friends. i started using make when i was maybe five or something it was nothing big it was just like a little foundation. right now im just pretty much a minor but i still put on make up whenever i feel like it but its just eyeliner pretty much or when i go to a friends house we do make overs. im sure you'll enjoy make overs as well.|`|Gbeak6fAaa	Well my mom really didn't teach me much so i had to learn for myself. I think I was a freshman in high school when I was putting make up on for special occasions. When i kept doing it and doing it i would get better at it. The only thing my mom told me not to do is to not over do it. Now Im a jr in high school and I think I do pretty well on applying my make up. You could go to a cosmetics store. They could help you out. oh and Im so very sorry about your mom.<br>  <br>  ~Be blessed~|`|Okg8KTsLaa	sorry ur mom died :( but i learned to apply make up( and it actually looked good)myself at age 10. u could go to like the makeup department of a store and ask them for help, ask ur friends or their mom, read magazines... good luck|`|fIb6zHXxaa	I'm sorry to hear about your mother.<br>  But, I'm 14 now and I started to use mascara this year and that's about it.

I'm 29 now.  No, it won't ruin your skin just as long as you don't go to sleep in it.  Also, make sure to read the ingredients in whatever makeup you wear.  I'm conscious about my skin too and I found that natural ingredients in makeup and cleansers work best for me like natural oils and botanicals, etc.   <br>  <br>  Sorry about your mother.<br>  <br>  Go to youtube.com and type in makeup application tutorial.  There are thousands of tutorials on there and the girls there can help you.

At that time, I just stuck to subtle colors though. Like, maybe a light bronze lip gloss and neutral eyeshadow swiped across my lid. I was 16 when i started wearing foundation, mascara, blush, and all that fun stuff. I learned by myself and my friends. I don't have any siblings or a mom either. So, they're not the only sources :) Also, you can look up videos on youtube. very helpful.|`|nNSoOWQDaa	I was 13 when i started wearing a little. I learned though research and practice.

iPje1iyGaa	Lipstick adds pigment and color to your lips and is typically more drying than gloss.  Lip gloss is moist and sticky and just gives your lips a shiny appearance.|`|GovsrmWxaa	I guess it's just personal preferences ?<br>  <br>  Some they mix lipstick and lip gloss..<br>  <br>  Some they use color lipstick then add a clear lip gloss (adding shine only)|`|zhzJoZ26aa	Anyone can wear lipstick. Lipstick is more of just a sheer pigment. Where a gloss still is a pigment but it's glossy.|`|8c56135cd4589e0631905a4f324f3f20aa	I've never heard that before...I think you can wear what you like.<br>  <br>  Lipstick is more opaque and lip gloss is more transparent.<br>  <br>  You should wear what looks best on you and what you like.|`|Yue2YKTnaa	lipstick is matte and not glossy.........and gloss is shiny|`|1Hx7MFUvaa	Lipsticks can be matte, creamy, sheer, glossy. Some lip glosses have more pigment that some lipsticks. They come in all different varieties. I don't think young girls under the age 25 should wear a strong pigmented lipstick unless they are modeling or for a special occasion. A lot of older women (and I'm not saying this to discriminate) wear lipstick because their skin lacks luster and they need the color or because they have been embedded with the idea that lipstick is the one and only makeup product a woman should use. I work in the cosmetic industry and I can't even begin to explain how so many woman are addicted to lipstick. A lot of them are stubborn and stick with the same shade for years and years. Estee Lauder and Benefit are two lines that have great lip COLORS that are actually a cross between a lipstick and a lip gloss. They give just the right amount of color and shine.|`|GOsRusM9aa	I don't wear lipstick, but from what I understand it DOES have alot of pigment in it, and it isn't usually shiny like lig gloss. And it's tougher to get off. I think it looks fake sometimes.....<br>       Lip Gloss is shiny and usually like a fruit flavor or something. It comes in lots of shades, even clear. And it comes off alot easier than lipstick.|`|zvN64drnaa	lipstick gives more color to your lips.<br>  you can enhance your natural color,<br>  or go darker/lighter/red... lol<br>  <br>  & lipgloss is obviously just gloss for some shine :]|`|sC3ru59Iaa	Lip Gloss is like a liquid and its shiny

s63bm0Guaa	Hi there, <br>  One way that you can have smooth hair with volume is blow dry it using  a root lifter and volumizing mousse. Blow dry w/your head upside down until 100% dry on hot, then for about a minute cool your hair down (still upside down) with the cold shot button on your dryer, that locks in volume...do that for about another minute  Then when you do use the flat iron, DONT flat iron at your root, just half way down the hair shaft.  OR--<br>  If you want big sexy flouncy hair, blow dry w/your head upside down as above with the same products, THEN set your hair in large Velcro rollers, spray them lightly w/a thermal active setting spray, and heat all of it up using your diffuser on your dryer and do that for a few minutes so they are nice and warm (just like being under a hood dryer at the salon) Then either let them cool on their own or cool them down w/the cold shot again.<br>  using that cold shot button always locks your style in, locks in shine, control and cuts frizz.<br>  Hope this helps:) Good luck!!|`|AA10476341	don't straighten just straight down...<br>  think up and over..like a rainbow(:<br>  clamp your hair and pull it straight up at the roots, then curve it and make a rainbowish shape with your arm/wrist(:|`|1ZfFSH6maa	tease it!<br>  use a comb and back comb it!|`|ETfgBxUbaa	theres special spray 4 that my sister has it it works|`|8rYvWPGVaa	1) once your done you can flip you head & brush your hair<br>  2) there are tonnnns of volume sprays you can get, but go for a better brand<br>  3) once your finished, get your blow dryer & turn it to the colder setting, and do it to your roots|`|AA10423733	Add mouse to the top of your hair.<br>  Or tease the top, and spray some hair spray, then comb out just a little. <br>  <br>  :D|`|bpzjkAuTaa	try a big barrel curler. im not saying curl your hair, but you should use a barrel to give volume.|`|UJEwRVeqaa	try curling or crimping it instead. :)
6Qou3Pxdaa	Girl, all I can tell you is to go to youtube.com.  They have a BUNCH of tutorials on this (well just about anything).  This is how I learned.|`|1Hx7MFUvaa	Line your lower lash line with a black eyeliner, then with a slanted eyeliner brush, dip in some dark grey or black eyeshadow and trace along the line you just made with the eyeliner.
1WNOQXVlaa	I have true match liquid foundation and the powder. I like it and I prefer to use both when I put it on.  I have really clear skin and nothing to cover up, but I would say it looks pretty good when its on, not cakey at all.
Bh259vTjaa	just start growing your hair out. show this pic to your stylist when your hair finally get long enough and pomade will be your best friend. <br>  NEVER use gel! i hate it when guys hair looks greasy and hard from gel....ugh.... its disgusting, Pomade will give you the hold and messiness of that look and still be able to run your fingers through it :)|`|OlLlWmdSaa	his hair is long enough to straighten<br>  and or blow-out with a hair-dryer|`|ZHJuK1QNaa	His hair is quite a bit longer than yours in both pictures.  But you are headed in the right direction.  Use a pomade. A good hair stylist can recommend one that would be right for your hair texture.  They can also show you how to use it.  <br>  Good Luck!|`|qb8bAzd7aa	Well first he most likely gets it professionally done...and second, he has long hair, so it would be easy to blowdry or straightn it, but if you use a hair straitener, I'd be careful not to burn your hair or your scalp =)|`|DGkRXLgWaa	idk the name but try gel and straightening it up??<br>  or straightening it and hair spray?<br>  thats wat im thinkin would work lol <br>  good luck<br>  also u'd look REALLY good if u do make that hair style work|`|oPYhUi8baa	Use styling gel. If that doesn't work ask your hair dresser, he'll know best. <br>  (=|`|8OrD7CVbaa	You have what looks like thicker hair... first try and grow it out just a little bit.<br>  Maybe try using shampoo that makes it really soft and then use gel or some sort of spray to make it stay.<br>  Youd look very nice with that hair.
7bf7fbd4987902f29965a776571e4aaaaa	Mayo and eggs are used for moisturizing the hair. Vinegar may help dandruff, but mayo and eggs wouldn't. Do an internet search for home remedies; there's lots of info out there.|`|yT29OZuvaa	I tried the egg rememdy. Where you take the egg yolk and blend it will some cooking oil, I think. It made my hair beautiful and shiny for about...16 hours. (8 hours I used for sleep) I had to wash my hair the next day. I heard the mayo and vinnegar made hair smell bad, but I'm not sure.|`|UL1I46ylaa	i've used vinegar and mayo.<br>  Mayo made it shiny and soft for a while, but didnt get rid of the dandruff.<br>  Vinegar made it shiny but stink even after i washed it out about 4 times, DONT try it.
7V7iQBZSaa	i shave my legs all the time and never have had them burning, need to use shaving cream, if u already do then u may need to try a different one, keeping the legs moist before and after is good, even shaving with lots of water like in the bath or shower is good, dry shaves can burn the legs, also if the razor is too sharp and u havent got enuff hair length|`|iPje1iyGaa	Try switching to a shaving cream that is meant for sensitive skin.  Also, after you finish shaving, wash with a gentle soap or body wash (try dove or caress).  If that doesn't work, you might have an allergy to something in the cream you used.|`|l1SVSF7zaa	are you using shoving cream?<br>  if so, get a better one.<br>  <br>  and you're not supposed to put lotion on right after.<br>  <br>  when you shave, the razor makes little invisible cuts in your skin.  so next time wait to apply any creams.<br>  <br>  right now, wash off the cream.|`|1CIOPwR0aa	eat a cheeze it YA DUMMY.|`|3ba2d12320bf7bcc5762865bed173631aa	There's a Skintimate product I use on my legs after I shave. It's like a female version of after shave, only it's for your legs. You can get it at Walmart. It helps prevent razor burn and it's like a lotion. Great product!|`|VEkTAhZmaa	dont use tht lotion after! it stings cuz u cut urself! wash it off quik|`|YyKBGfTpaa	dont put cream on|`|wCKEl2wMaa	get a new razor. i hate it when that happens though!|`|FXkehS8eaa	just dont shave girl..<br>  u can do it..<br>  for a couple of days..that all..<br>  the burn will go away|`|nga1mAaVaa	use an ice back or use the stuff that's blue that u put on when u burn urself with a stove or sumtin or soke ur leggs in a tub of ice water|`|sunuId5aaa	you prolly shaved and you didn't need to.<br>  or your skin is allergic to the lotion you put on..<br>  (:
IVF4lyJdaa	people all have different opinions. I liek something that shows a figure not saying it has too be super tight but im not into the loose look , its just my opinion. i dont find your shirt ugly i wouldnt wear it though.|`|BY5CxGRDaa	nah i dont think its ugly. its called being comfortable :)|`|bUATSZsaaa	No. <br>  It depends. If guys are going for the gangsta look, it's really sloppy and ugly. But if you wear a baggy shirt with normal-fitting jeans, it looks fine.|`|mDt03eXIaa	Yeah, kind of. they don't fit well, so they don't flatter at all. it looks sloppy. <br>  <br>  You're soo pretty though. You look like a doll lol.|`|wWcUSPygaa	I love that look, I think it makes you look easy-going and fun-loving<br>  You look great ;)|`|fazOq0N2aa	Id guess because it looks "gangster".<br>  <br>  Your hot, nothing you wear is going to change that.
jez0O0bXaa	It would help to get back to your natural color with out totally changing your look and add dimension to your hair.|`|sunuId5aaa	you have to let your hair grow out .<br>  then you have to get it cutt.<br>  yeauh it would keep yr roots from being visable for a while, <br>  but once yr hair grows again your gonna be able to see them.|`|c21f52f98718e01558380e0e7fac21cbaa	I've done the exact same thing and the only thing you can do is just wait for it to grow out. Adding color to already dyed hair is a bit iffy. You could always dye it a shade darker, but again you have to wait for it to grow out and be patient.
idhcqr5Daa	Start early. Once they pass the initial stage (when they are red, purple, pink, or brown, depending on the color of your skin) and become white or silver (usually with deep indentation), it's far more difficult to minimize them.[1] <br>  Massage the area with stretch marks three or four times a day with moisturizers that contain cocoa butter or shea butter as a prime ingredient. This hydrates the skin, making it more pliant. Again, this is most effective in the initial stage.[1] <br>  Apply self-tanner. It will help minimize the appearance of stretch marks. Exfoliate beforehand for best results.[2] <br>  Educate yourself about topical treatments. Many are advertised to "repair" stretch marks, but few have actually been proven to be effective. Here's the scoop on what's available:<br>  Wheat germ oil - may help improve stretch marks in their early phase.Glycolic acid - increases collagen production; can be administered in higher doses by a dermatologist (costs about $100 USD and requires three or four office visits before you see results); has not been fully studied by itself[1] <br>  Vitamin C - certain formulations might increase collagen production, but they'll only help with early-stage stretch marks; for best results, combine with glycolic acid; taking 500 mg of Vitamin C supplements three times a day may also help.[1] <br>  Relastin - the effectiveness of this product is unknown and unverified[1] <br>  Peptide-containing products - these "repair" creams are ineffective; there's no evidence that they work.[1] <br>  Retinoids - they're fairly effective in increasing collagen and elastic production in the early stages, but they should be avoided if you're pregnant or nursing; they're more effective when used in combination with glycolic acid.[1] Topical tretinoin can lighten stretch marks and reduce their size if applied in the earlier stages.[3] Specifically, tretinoin cream is effective against stretch marks that are less than 6 weeks old, and are still pink or red, but it should not be used during pregnancy. It works by helping to rebuild collagen, but it's not effective against older stretch marks.[4] <br>  Consider laser treatment. It's used to treat both red/purple and white stretch marks, and generally it works by promoting the formation of collagen. It can be expensive, however, and effectiveness is limited.<br>  vascular lasers - won't remove superficial skin, but are effective against redness by treating the blood vessels behind it; E.g. V-Beam, requires three to six sessions, about $450 per session[1] <br>  fractionated laser - minimizes older, more entrenched stretch marks in a process comparable to "smudging"; expect to pay around $1000 USD per session, and you'll need at least three sessions; yields about a 30% improvement.[1] new generation fractional lasers can improve depressed skin, whiteness, and redness in one to three sessions[5] <br>  pulsed dye laser therapy "remodels" the underlying layers of skin and trigger the production of collagen and elastin; it's most effective on new stretch marks, but might be effective on older ones.[4] The light heats blood vessels and makes them collapse so that the color is reduced, but it doesn't affect texture. Five treatments, one month apart, $500-800 per treatment.[2] It is not recommended for anyone with a dark skin tone (Fitzpatrick Skin Type IV, V or VI) because of the potential for skin discoloration, and it should not be used while pregnant or nursing.[6] <br>  fractional photothermolysis also targets the underlying layers of skin; it damages small dot-like areas, not the entire area.[4] <br>  the excimer laser triggers melanin production so that stretch marks take on the same color as the surrounding skin. This can be effective against older stretch marks.[4] Excimer laser is for older marks. 10-20 treatments, two weeks apart, $200-700 per treatment.[2] <br>  Look into microdermabrasion. Microdermabrasion works by blowing crystals onto the skin to "polish" the surface; it's followed by a vacuum tube that removes the crystals and skin cells, stimulating new skin growth. This is effective against older stretch marks.[<br>  <br>  x0x0_LEi|`|GH1nqOCkaa	Unfortunatly, stretch marks will never fully go away. I would suggest co-co butter, extra mostuizing, and a little excercise. Also, tanning kind of hides the stretch marks a little, blends them into your skin.|`|3ndqP2Haaa	I used to have pretty bad stretch marks and red scars around my belly region ever since I gave birth to my three kids.I had tried Vitamin E oil and cocoa butter which a number of people had recommended but unfortunately it didn't seem to work too well. My Doctor had even suggested that I go for a Tummy Tuck. I then recently read an article about a lady who supposedly got rid of her stretch marks using a particular cream. I tried it and it worked really well. It took a number of weeks but my stretch marks soon faded away. You can read the lady's article at the link below. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.stretchmarkszapped.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.stretchmarkszapped.com</a>|`|TSIYpgW7aa	there is no way to get rid of stretch marks. i have them on my stomach and thighs, from my growth burst, i get 6 inches in 2 months. everyone has them though. so dont get stressed out cuz your not alone hun, now when your pregnant i heard if you use cocoa butter lotion and rub it on your stomach everyday, or something like that, that it takes away stretch marks so try that.|`|pp5UIe35aa	There are lazer procedures out there that are supposed to dramitacally fade them.

eN7qLfIkaa	It hurts sooooo bad! <br>  <br>  And I thought I was tough!<br>  <br>  It sucks hella bad!!!!!|`|rvyvF3KAaa	Why would you want one? No one sees it.|`|CzZPFS0zaa	It is a pretty sensitive area, not to mention that it is also pretty thick. It will definitely hurt, but the easiest way to think of it is this... even if it's the worst thing you feel in you whole life, its all over in one second. By the time you feel it, you are done. Afterward, you should expect tenderness, but you can soak a warm cloth on it or take an over the counter medicine for pain relief (If you are allowed to take them, aren't allergic, blah blah blah. Basically I am not a doctor so use your best judgment on what to take for pain and swelling.) As far as aftercare, I am too lazy to type the whole thing, but your best bet is non-iodized sea salt mixed with warm water. You can find all the info on it at www.safepiercing.org just look under the tab on the side labeled 'getting pierced' and then piercing aftercare. I hope this helped!

Do as you wish, and you won't regret it!|`|xXGn1zfsaa	It looks good if you have the right face shape, and clear skin.<br>  I know the second part sounds random but honestly if you have problem skin, heavy bangs just frames your face like a picture and makes them more noticeable.

Good luck! :)|`|hg5I1O2xaa	I love bangs on certain faces!<br>  <br>  It really depends on your face shape too. Because if you have a rounder face shape then it might look a little weird. But bangs are cute if you get them done right.|`|viLGwJt1aa	It all really depends on your face shape, but unless you have a reaaallllyy short face, bangs always look good! Make sure if you're getting them to not have them too long or you'll send the wrong message. Also, you could try side bangs or really short ones if you want. Good choice being daring! I bet you'll look awesome! Have fun!|`|XtjCIWUcaa	I've been thinking about getting them too.<br>  i say totally go for it!<br>  and if it doesn't turn out good, just remember hair grows.

Dg0D8SCZaa	normal. <br>  <br>  wounds swell a little while healing, including piercings.|`|IIhiSprlaa	It doesn't sound good to me. Continue to keep it very clean and if redness/pain or irritation occurs, remove it immediately and see a doctor.|`|g7mD94cuaa	No its not. Not to scare you, but sometimes when people have this done, it swells and gets infected and if it is left untreated, sometimes people have to get that piece of their ear removed.<br>  <br>  If it is just a little red it is ok, but if it gets all puffed up and turns purple, be sure you see a doctor right away. For now, put some peroxide on it 3 times a day, and make sure you take the earing out, you may have to let the hole close up and get it re-done later.<br>  <br>  Best wishes.
slppTZi1aa	Itll be fine, I got mine pierced wednesday and its sunday and its still a little swollen. Dont touch it with dirty hands. Clean it whenever you think you might of just in case because you dont want the bacteria to spread and infect it, cartlidge is a place you want to take really good care of because bacteria spreads so well throughout it. As long as your taking care of it im sure its fine. If there is no pus and the blood is to a minimum then it should heal properly.|`|bAYVSfdJaa	You could have snagged it without realizing it.  A little bit of swelling isn't anything to worry about.|`|NhOQ3mRxaa	I thought you couldn't get your cartlidge pierced with a gun?

U do it everywhere! theres a few methods, some extreme, some stupid, some just plain wrong... claw the sand and get dirt under ur nails. ( then if u bite them once it's nasty tasting and u stop.) well, u already chew gum every single day. But what else hmmm..... untill you stop biting them, when they bleed. pretend that your oreo and first ( this part is for u only) soak your bloody nail in peroxide to clean it. ( it bubbles not hurts) then put corn startch on it. thats what u do for guinea pigs so eh.<br>  <br>  Heres this:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://wiki.answers.com/Q/How_do_you_stop_biting_your_nails&alreadyAsked=1&rtitle=How_do_you_stop_biteing_your_nails" rel="nofollow">http://wiki.answers.com/Q/How_do_you_sto...</a><br>  <br>  thats the answer everyone says. ohh! or put some salsa juice on your fingers. (the juice in salsa.) and leave it there all day. (gross, and wierd, but you are in desprate need lol jk) use the hot kind so it burns ur mouth lol. but keep water close by.<br>  good luck hot loose n ahh! whatever.... <<<<<you username goes there.|`|rmAHExjEaa	Why do you want to wait until Summer to do acrylics?  Chances are you aren't doing anything in school that will cause them to be ripped off.  I would go ahead and get acrylics done at a salon.  I've heard it helps break the habit because it is super hard to bite the fake nail, so eventually you will just give up.  There is also this polish you can put on them that burns like pepper when you put your nail in your mouth.  I used that, and it worked for me!  You can get it at drugstores or Wal*Mart.|`|PwkYJoVgaa	i have the same problem and i need to know a good answer too! haha. ITS ADDICTING TO BIT UR NAILS! ughh i hate it. EDIT:  omg yesterday i didnt even know i was doing this but i was bitting the skin of my finger too! and it started to bleed! ahh. i need help!!|`|sVXZZNbRaa	try putting something spicy on your nails like chili or hot sauce.|`|HoskOfjaaa	well...i have the same problem.but fake nails won't last.It depends how old are you cuz if u want u can get da salon nails done but u have to find a place in which they wud actually do them as short as u have them.and then keep on getting a refill till ur nails grow.Then u can take them out and paint them with a bright color nail polish.This will not make u want to mess it up,and if u can't help it don't bite ur nails,instead just scratch the nail polish out wit ur teeths.That's if ur teeth are still clumsy to bite ur nails.lol.But hopefully this works.I wish u Gud luck!|`|i8Pl0Pejaa	Try some acrylic nails, they are pretty cheap here in China, but I"m not sure about where you live. That's how I stopped biting my nails. Or try the polish that tastes bad, so everytime you go to bite them, it tastes ike **** haha <br>  Those are some tips, hopefully it works for you like it worked for me.|`|MW3y3jlZaa	i have the same problem, i either paint them a color or i chew gum a lot. that usually works

VVQYuMO1aa	Get herbal essences frizz control shampoo and conditioner and pin straight shampoo and conditioner. get a straightener that gets really hot then wash your hair with the friz control shampoo and conditioner soon enough your hair should be under control you could start then straightening it because it won't frizz easily. then start using pin straight shampoo OR  if u just want to control the frizz you only have to se frizz control stuff<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ooooo i just looked at this again and saw the added detail my advice still get the anti frizz shampoo frizz is from DRT HAIR if your hair is dry it gets frizzy and staticky|`|vvB0Etysaa	Hi:<br>  <br>  First you should go to a hairdresser and get your hair straightened.<br>  This should last for about 6 months.<br>  Regarding your pimples use alcohol and a cotton ball every night before going to bed and in the morning.  This will dry out the oil parts of your skin or pimples.|`|Lh7rzb7Laa	get good shampoo and conditioner, brush out your hair while out of the shower, put in heat protector, frizz control and shine products, blow dry your hair as straight as you can with a brush at hand, flat iron your hair or curl it, which ever you like and put in more shine product and hairspray. <br>  <br>  wash your face at night and morning|`|iNXGb3jUaa	I would beg your mom to give your flatiron back it makes such a difference you might wanna ask your mom to get a chemical straightener in a salon that really works then you wouldn't have to worry about it for a while and try alcohol on the pimples it could burn a little but it will dry then up and eventually go away|`|EDFyDayUaa	My hair is just like that.

I highly recommend Curl Life by Matrix, you can find that in salons. <br>  Also never ever brush your curls......always use a very wide tooth comb, and be gentle, do this when its wet, never dry on curls. <br>  Some people dont even really need to comb their hair too much. <br>  Then get some type of curl enhancing styling aid.....depending if your hair is thick and course or fine and soft. thick and course you'll need something a little heavier in your hair, like a curl balm, or a curl cream (curls rock by TIGI)...or mousse <br>  or if its on the finer softer side, try a curl spray. <br>  or if you want to try something that is generally good for everyone ... a mousse, again one of the best i have found out there is the curl life mousse. <br>  put these in while your hair is damp.  IF your hair is curly curly like you mentioned......try just twirling your hair around your fingers in sections until it forms a little ringlet, then let it air dry.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ps- please dont get your hair thinned, what will happen with that is in hair that is already puffy and frizzy, it will just make it worse.  Because when you thin hair, shorter lengths are being taken out therefor thoes lengthes are more strong and it will make the longer hair sit ontop and puff out.  Your curls will not fuse together nicely. they will look even more frizzy. <br>  That wouldn't be the best option for your hair, in my professional opinion as a hairstylist myself.
s63bm0Guaa	Hi there,<br>  there are some really awesome shampoos out their especially for oily hair,  try Paul Mitchell "Shampoo Two", or Tea Tree Shampoo. <br>  And as for conditioner try Paul Mitchell "The Rinse" its very light<br>  Also, highlights help w/oily hair as well, because the hair is more porous where the highlights are, your oils absorb into the highlights and not sit on top of your actual hair.|`|QXMCWWAWaa	How often do you wash it? Wash it at least every two days and try putting baby powder in it after it's dry. That should make it less greasy.|`|9htvLQ0taa	try head and shoulders and as of conditioner use light and use a squirt.<br>  <br>  maybe you can also try to shampoo thoroughly and deep into your roots.<br>  <br>  that could be the problem...maybe you don't shampoo thoroughly enough.|`|5izfGtWwaa	watch this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7T00MH-5gU" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7T00MH-5...</a><br>  <br>  after u watch: you can also use a blow dryer instead of of a flat iron|`|82JNLXyPaa	use less conditioner.<br>  <br>  when your hair is dry, put some baby powder on the roots. no joke, this soaks up the grease.<br>  <br>  and lastly.. pinning your bangs back can hide greasy roots.

But it does depend on how tight you want your curls, and how difficult your hair is to straighten. But usually, it equals the same amount of time, for the same quality of job. Sometimes, curly takes longer, if you're hair is thin for straightening.|`|YawWNDvyaa	Depends if u have naturally staright hair it would take longer to curl<br>  wavy, curly hair would take longer to falt iron|`|HJrTuihcaa	flat iron because you have to hold the curling iron there for a few seconds on each piece you do. <br>  <br>  <br>  but it varies from person to person|`|nHV3sKJ3aa	For me straightening take less time.|`|iNXGb3jUaa	your still taking strands of hair either way you do it, but I would think using a flat iron would take less time cause all you have to do is run it through the hair instead of having to curl it up and stand there waiting for it to curl|`|oKWmFz69aa	i have wavyish hair and it takes me about 10 minutes to straighten my hair and about a hour to curl it.|`|xV2AsD2daa	I can say from experience curling does take longer for me than straightening.|`|b4s7j9xGaa	It depends how wavy, curly, or straight ur hair is, my hair is wavy and straighting is easier.|`|0oJbGx4Xaa	straightening unless you have naturally curly hair|`|OZxv2xPKaa	depends on quality of your straightener or curler, but id think generally, a curler|`|bNMvKdCNaa	straighting i straight my hair every day b4 school|`|EtnOgC0daa	hair straightening b/c curling needs u to make perfect curls but all u need is ur hair to be straight and its good.
VN2wyTnFaa	I'd go with nude lips and sheer/peach blush (or a bronzer could work too). Sounds really pretty though! Good luck!|`|spXPpyP0aa	yes|`|nNSoOWQDaa	Very light, if your eyes are dramatic the rest of your makeup should be subtle.

VNflPvbZaa	you scrunch it. when your hair is wet you mess it up with the towel and make it wavy. then u get a bunch of gel/hair moose and put that in your hair to make it stay. then hairspray it and put it in a sloppy bun for over night. or you could just do that in the morning.|`|DGkRXLgWaa	when u get out of the shower put ur hair in a bunch of medium sized braids then wait for it to dry and take em out

Anyways put your hair up in a very high, loose ponytail with a cloth wrapped hair tie (also known as scrunchie). This will prevent the curls form being stretched out and stuff. Also to prevent frizzing and damage from moving in your sleep try sleeping on a satin pillowcase.<br>  <br>  Here are some basic tips for curly hair that you might find helpful:<br>  *Try to find a stylist who knows how to work with curly hair. They'll know what to do. You can find reviews by region here: <a href="http://www.naturallycurly.com/curlsalons" rel="nofollow">http://www.naturallycurly.com/curlsalons</a><br>  *Don't shampoo every day.<br>  *Comb conditioner through hair in the shower.<br>  *Apply styling products to dripping wet hair. Scrunch or twirl hair to achieve desired shape.<br>  *Use styling products suited for your hair type. Don’t know yours? <a href="http://www.naturallycurly.com/hair-types" rel="nofollow">http://www.naturallycurly.com/hair-types</a><br>  *Avoid terrycloth towels on hair; use linen, paper towels, or t-shirts instead.<br>  *Air dry or use a diffuser with your blowdryer.<br>  *Don't touch (or brush!) your hair while it’s drying.<br>  *Once completely dry scrunch out any crunchy texture.<br>  <br>  For hair type specific products check out these forums:<br>  <a href="http://www.naturallycurly.com/curltalk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.naturallycurly.com/curltalk/</a><br>  There you can find others with the same hair type and try out some of their favorite products. I would recommend something, but I don’t know your hair type. :)<br>  <br>  Lastly, it has made my hair so much better since I started the curly girl method! I used to almost never wear it down (it was a frizz/poof ball), but now I have pretty, shiny curls. ~:) It’s pretty radical—no sulfates (shampoo) or silicones—but it’s so great for curly hair.

Then you can get a nice cut like this that is fairly short, and will be easy to manage.|`|5941f556323b831d776eb295c514e357aa	my hair is curly and wavy <br>  VO5 curl mousse is awesome! after u apply and its all crunchy spray biolage on it and it will be soft and curly..it works extremely good!or if you dont have Biolage spray water on it|`|Lnw6ZYMoaa	I love love love curly hair. I only have wavy, so I'm jealous :|<br>  What you need is a really good deep conditioner. That way your hair will be soft and pretty, so then your can wear it down curly (: <br>  Also you might try getting your hair thinned if its too unbearable.
U8mCfSp9aa	i'd have to see a pic to really tell, but it shouldn't really affect your chances with guys if that's what you're worried about. i'm actually jealous of my friend's small nose bump, she doesn't like it, but i think it's kinda cute. and she literally has at least a few guys ask her out or try to jump her bones a week. as long as it's not HUGE i doubt it's anything to worry about.|`|mDt03eXIaa	Well, you can wear contacts instead of glasses, but honestly, little quirks like that are what makes you attractive, it sets you apart from everyone else.

I curl my lashes and add a coat of mascara. I apply blush and a nude gloss. That's my whole routine.|`|VN2wyTnFaa	For an everyday look, I use concealer, liquid liner, mascara, blush, and lip gloss.

idhcqr5Daa	Wash your whole body with Neutrogena Body Clear Body Wash, concentrating on the areas with pimples. Wait a minute or so before rinsing to get rid of all the oil, and to let the medicine sink in and do its work. Exfoliate by using an abrasive sponge (Buf-Puf is one brand name) or a loofa (plastic pouf "washcloth" that looks like a white mesh ball). Don't scrub too hard, or you'll increase irritation. <br>  Moisturize with an oil-free, medicated lotion, such as Clean & Clear Dual Action Moisturizer. <br>  Spot treat with acne medication cream. Since you are already using salicylic acid to wash and moisturize, use a different medicine for spot treatment, such as 2.5% benzoyl peroxide. Do not use a 5% or 10% benzoyl peroxide, because this will increase irritation without increasing the rate at which the pimples diminish. (If you're sensitive to benzoyl peroxide, sulfur may work.) <br>  Avoid sun exposure without sunblock, this will only further irritate skin.<br>  1) Have your back submerged within the salt water for about 10 mins 2) Sit in the sun for about 10-15 mins. The sun will dry out the pimples. 3) Repeat step 1 and 2 a couple of times.<br>  You will notice results within the first two days<br>  Head & Shoulders with zinc used daily can help clear acne. <br>  Drink 8 glasses of water a day. Hydrating properly will ensure that your body will not need to release as much oil and bacteria in the form of bacne. There are generic versions of Neutrogena Body Wash for acne available. Just look for this active ingredient: 2% salicylic acid. <br>  The medicated moisturizer should also have salicylic acid, either in .5% or 2% strengths. Once your acne is under control, you may switch to using an alpha-hydroxy lotion. <br>  Medicating your skin with lemons (slice & rub onto skin) or tomatoes will greatly help, because the acid in them will help to kill harmful bacteria. This is especially good if you have sensitive skin and the chemical treatments will do more harm than good. <br>  Another natural treatment is to make an exfoliating scrub which will help remove dead skin cells that can clog pores and cause breakouts. Squeeze one grapefruit into a bowl with 1 1/2 cups of white sugar and 1/2 cup of coarse sea salt. Massage into the affected areas, then pat dry. Dr. Bronner's Tea Tree Soap can help clear acne. Also, it generally doesn't dry out the skin as some medicated soaps tend to do. Do not pick or pop the pimples. This only increases the chance of infection. Treat any popped pimples with 3% hydrogen peroxide or 10% benzoyl peroxide to reduce the chance of infection. <br>  If you are taking Accutane, do not use Neutrogena or benzoyl peroxide. Accutane works by killing oil glands under the skin, thereby removing the critical producer of oil. <br>  <br>  x0x0_LEi|`|mPpJc2mhaa	YES! A home remidie that works SO well!

s63bm0Guaa	Hi there.....<br>  unfortunately there isnt really anything that will get your hair as straight as what your flat iron or dryer will do...you pretty much need that heat to reshape the hair.  However, what you can do, is get yourself a nice haircut, get all the dead fuzzies off, get your hairstylist do put a demi permanent or demi glaze over your hair ( this will help smooth the cuticle and make it shiny and appear smoother) <br>  Then get a smoothing shampoo & conditioner (from the salon) <br>  and also a deep conditioner, make sure you deep condition once a week,<br>  also when flat ironing, always always use a protectant on your hair befor you use heat, this means with your dryer as well. It can be something as simple as a flat iron spray.|`|fHLzD0j7aa	well...you need to restrengthen it,obviously. so look for products that will help like shampoo or creme. and get your hair trimmed so the ends will be better. and i know i know everyone wants the Straight hair but try to go with the wave use curly shampoo and gel or creme. how know maybe you'll like it! ;]|`|Lnw6ZYMoaa	Leave your hair alone for awhile. Put it up in a cute pony tail or head band. Use a deep conditioner twice a week. Aussie has a great 3 minute one. To get rid of dead/split ends you are going to have to cut your hair. Not that short, but just a good trim so it'll be healthy.|`|2V87n4PKaa	rezz-a-rect<br>  if your sceptical, ask for a free sample

I used to dye my hair at least once a month, find a color that is closest to your natural color and LEAVE it that way, stop dying it so much! Secondly, your hair is going to look depending on what you put in your body. Eat a balanced diet, lots of protein, cause that's what hair is, also evening primrose oil(a vitamin from walmart or cvs etc.) is great for growing your hair back in, also make sure your taking a daily vitamin! Don't wash your hair everyday go as long as you can without washing drying and straitening etc! you have to baby your hair to make it grow back and become healthier again. I know it's hard not to want to dye it so much, trust me i had to put myself thru hair color rehab!! lol :0) Just take care of it, take your vitamins and soon enough you will start growing in baby hairs around your forehead and you know your hair is coming back! Its worth it, good luck!!!|`|s63bm0Guaa	Hi there,<br>  what you can try is rogain, or nioxin, nioxin you can find in professional salons.  these are expensive, but any non surgical process will be. now are you actually balding? or is the actual diameter of your hair getting skinnier? <br>  if you feel that it is actual hair loss itself, you really should talk to your doctor, because this can be a hormonal imbalance...which is common in your age group. or lack of certain vitamins in your diet which is also common. also in rare cases it could be an illness.  and with knowing this, your doctor can point you more in the right direction.|`|20avEQ0caa	well..there is a lot of hair shampoo that can thick-in your hair and you might want to go to a hair saloon they sell a lot of hair products that can really help well hope i helped good luck :D|`|lcgN6gkSaa	r u a boy or a girl if u tell me i will answer ur question<br>  P.S im 11 and for a girl like me im smart

0ItPtqcsaa	I think so, I cut my hair every 2 months and it always grows faster than usual. some inexpensive ways you could keep your hair healthy is by, washing your hair every week at least once,aintaining a healthy lifestyle  which includes proper diet and nutrition is a major key to beautiful hair. But, unfortunately, we do not always have proper eating habits. By using hair nutrients and following some general guidelines, you can keep your hair in great condition.Good hygiene is important for healthy hair. This includes brushing the hair properly and washing it with a mild shampoo. Good nutrition (a well - balanced diet of fresh foods and lots of water) not only helps one to have beautiful - looking hair but also improves it's texture.<br>  Wash your hair daily or every other day. The extra circulation provided by the shampoo /message stimulates the oil glands to work more efficiently and brings natural oils into the hair. This applies to all types of hair.<br>  Use shampoo that is pH balanced and that is designed specially for you hair type (dry, oily, etc.). Ask your hair specialist to assist you in selecting the right shampoo for your hair type. Always rinse with cool (not hot) clean water for extra shine. Allow your hair to air dry naturally whenever possible. Never brush soaking - wet hair, as the hair is quite elastic at this time and can be pulled and stretched to the breaking point. A wide - toothed comb is best for wet hair.<br>  Give your hair a good brushing before bed. This should be done by bending forward from the waist, head down, brushing from the back to front. Brush at least fifty to one hundred strokes. This will help remove dirt, pollutants and damaging particles from the hair in addition to stimulate circulation which will increase natural oils for added sheen and oxygen to the hair and scalp.|`|Vr5R7483aa	~ Comb your hair gently.<br>  ~ Put VCO (Virgin Coconut Oil) on your hair after bathing.<br>  ~ Don't use too much conditioners.<br>  ~ Don't iron your hair.<br>  ~ Use mild shampoo.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope i helped you.<br>  <br>  ^_^|`|EtnOgC0daa	vitamins biotin is recommended and every six months is good.|`|8oHlIrLOaa	Yes, Cutting your hair every six weeks will make it grow faster, or it will atleast make it look longer because you are getting rid of the dead/split ends. Dont straighten your hair. That really ruins it. Good luck.|`|f79674f11cb0d8833ea9b2f32ce01461aa	No, cutting hair does not make it grow faster. Hair is only alive in the roots.

Once you learn to accept it, you will feel better about yourself.<br>  <br>  Be careful as I've read those bodies who should not sun tan are more prone to skin cancer.<br>  <br>  There is nothing wrong with a milky white body and if you look after yourself, work out, keep it muscle toned, it's just as beautiful.

eur4jAc3aa	Its not bad, I had my dark brown ( almost black ) hair bleached 2 months ago and it worked perfectly. I posted questions on here before I had it done and was told my hair would become dry and most likely fall out etc..<br>  But I went to the salon and came out 2 hours later with perfect Blonde hair and the only difference of my hair was the color ! <br>  Dont worry about it.|`|s63bm0Guaa	Hi there,<br>  Bleach is 100% safe as for chemicals on skin and what not.  as for damage on the hair if it is done professionally your hairstylist can custom create a strength of bleach that is right for your hair type and control where that bleach is going.  If you bleach your hair over and over in the same spot your hair will break and get dry.  as long as you are keeping up with deep conditioning treatments and having it professionally done and keeping up on every 6 week haircuts you should be fine. <br>  But if you still don't like the idea of bleach in your hair, ask your hairstylist about high lift colors or "special blonds" most professional color lines have them.  the only down fall to those is they are not the greatest to achieve that "platinum white blond" that some people prefer. These can only be used on hair that has no color already in it...and best used on hair that is naturally a dirty blond or lighter.|`|DGkRXLgWaa	wanna kno what bleach does to ur hair?<br>  put some in the palm of ur hand for and hour. see how that goes.<br>  <br>  Heres a BETTER bleaching trick natural and safe.<br>  In the summer time take LIMES (green ones must be green) and soak ur hair with it and sit out in the sun for a while then wash it out<br>  also make sure u do it right outta the shower bc no oils can be in ur hair.|`|hg5I1O2xaa	Bleach damages your roots/scalp and it dries you hair folicles out.<br>  <br>  Even if you go to a professional, it doesn't mean it's going to be any safer than doing it yourself.|`|3kCQDUUGaa	No matter whether you get your hair bleached professionally or do it yourself it is bad for your hair.. it severely drys it out & damages it.

Only if it's not conditioned well it will do that.

h00bqU7baa	Well if it looks good than its fine. Dont you think.
x95SI6pFaa	it's all up to how fast you heal. when i got mine done, i talked funny for about 1 day and then after that it went down, i still felt my tongue kind of swollen and sometimes would have a little hard time talking right, that completely stopped in about 1 week.  Just washed it out with listerine or any mouth was that you have, at least 3 times a day so it dont get infected.  you might want to take some ibuprofen that usually helps with the swelling and of course ice just eat lots of ice/popsicles. dont forget to move it around and leave it for about 3 weeks then you can change it to a different one. Good Luck|`|slppTZi1aa	Eat little pieces of ice, like in the bottom of your drink when your done with it. But do not drink out of a straw, it could pull the bar and stretch it, no good. Also, do disinfect it, with listerine or some kind of disinfecting mouth wash, Depending on you, you could talk funny anywhere from the end of the 1st night to the 4th day, who knows. I got mine on a saturday and couldnt talk at school the next monday. Its not going to be bad though, and try to make sure you dont drool :D <br>  <br>  Good luck, and eat soft foods that you wont need to chew as much, because since your not used to it you could bite it and break your teeth, so be careful.|`|h1j1KPzJaa	it all depends on how you heal, and what you have in the piercing, my girlfriend has a vibrating tongue ring that she wears some times ;) and she always talks funny with that in her mouth, but then talking isnt what she puts it in for.<br>  are there any metals you are allergic to? I know of one person who puts nickle plated rings in her ears and they swell up like soft balls|`|7bf21413e2e3f54d05c3c67fc6e65a6eaa	its different for each person actually. My two sisters got theirs done and the swelling and talking funny went away within about 4-5 days mine however took twice that long. Suck on ice and take ibuprofen that helps with the swelling a little. Good luck!|`|LXMbUx2Jaa	wash it 3 times a day. use half listerine and half water to clean it. eat ice that helped me. it will be fine i a few days|`|l7rn9zE9aa	I hope you talk funny forever, peircing your tongue is sick.|`|Nnplp5Qqaa	so wash it out 3 times a day<br>  it'll go away after like a week|`|CkqW2NWJaa	eww|`|ohyRPg1Uaa	lol. hopefully soon... good luck|`|LPCfOtiKaa	It'll settle down in a couple days. Just baby it, don't worry it'll be fine.|`|ZleVRevVaa	Can i see ur tongue please?|`|H6uYThgjaa	you'll be talking funny due to your swollen tongue just for a few days. once your tongue is healed and you start to hit the metal ball on your teeth, you'll get micro-fractures in your teeth. with a bit of bad luck your teeth will get ruined and have to be extracted. and then, you will really be talking funny!!!|`|RPdtHKk5aa	It will go away soon enough, just make sure to be really careful and extremely hygienic - wash it three times a day without fail, you don't want to get it infected. Read this article, it should help:<br>  <a href="http://www.essortment.com/all/tonguepiercing_rjsl.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.essortment.com/all/tonguepier...</a>|`|E80oq8bIaa	itll wont be a long time but atleast a week mine took two just wait for the swelling to go down then they can change it but keep it clean or youll really screw it up|`|n0dbwJnmaa	Piercings???????????????????? <br>  <br>  Are ugly. :]
oA066Stbaa	don't apply so much. apply a moderate amount and play with them and flip your hair to prevent it from getting hard. or u could take a blow dryer and put it on low and hold it fa from your hair but not too far. far enough that then heat can reach your hair but not mess it up. hold the blow dryer for about 5 minutes u don't wanna dry your hair with it. and continue to play with your curls and pick at them this should help. and olive oil will just make your hair smell bad and get greasy so don't. or u could use this mosturizer for your hair that works the smae way as gel but dosen't make it hard. it will tame the frizz. or you coud but your hair in rollers/rags u won't get frizzy hair and it will bring out your curls more.|`|QXMCWWAWaa	I would assume it would! Go ahead! Nothings in your way to try!
bogfZ6Xsaa	It's better to trim it because the dead split ends aren't helping to get nutrients through the hair like it needs to stay healthy. Your hair grows on average a half an inch a month. It'll grow back in no time! Gradually trim an inch or so off at a time and eventually it'll feel soft again! I use "The Conditioner" on the ends of my hair (Paul Mitchell). Dove shampoo and Conditioner is a bit spendy too, but it makes my hair feel sooooo soft!<br>  Hope this helps!|`|fscgp7iFaa	Hair: Try pureology hair conditioner or garnier fructis these are great conditioners. Pureology works better but is very expensive but Garnier is cheaper and does less. Try putting conditioner in your hair and put a shower cap on it and sleeping with the conditioner in and then washing it off in the morning. Try a deep conditioning product. To straighten it without a straightener use a molding foam wax.|`|ddWyRjmVaa	your going to have to cut it.<br>  seriously, im growing my hair out it a little longer than my shoulders, and i REALLY want it longer, but i straighten my hair EVERYDAY and i have many split ends and i had to cut it. and i only cut it like 1 1/2 shorter and it has already grown out.<br>  and actually it felt MUCH healthier.<br>  <br>  Suck it up and cut it.|`|LmH5jZxkaa	biologe hydrating shampoo and conditioner are both good, and try to avoid heat. also, using a wide tooth comb after showers will help prevent any further damage. a trim is necessary, but if the damage is mainly on the ends that should be extremely helpful|`|2V87n4PKaa	i would just cut off the bottom inch, maybe 2<br>  that will get rid of most of the split ends so it wont ruin the rest of your hair
OGHDw55oaa	Medium length with that colour is hot!!!  You would look really good!!**|`|mDt03eXIaa	Honestly, while there definitely are guys who prefer girls with a certain 'look' most guys just care that your hairstyle suits you. In my experience, they usually prefer hair that's around shoulder length or longer (which you have) but as far as color, as long as it looks good on you and flatters your skintone, they will like it.|`|E4pXTZ5Naa	I love how no one here can read.

If you're gonna pierce something just spend the damn money because it's not worth getting an infection over. Or you could just forget about it entirely and leave your body as it is...|`|XqqLlBe4aa	i wouldnt do it yourself.<br>  you have to clean it a lot.<br>  and you have to do it in the right spot or it looks weird|`|2NtiI51aaa	dont do it yourself.. youre gonna crack your cartilage<br>  and possible have an infection<br>  real bad idea|`|qQJdi0p1aa	don't pierce your self that's crazy!! leave it to the professionals!|`|XqGgr9XWaa	thats retarted!!!!<br>  but sexy!!!<br>  painfull!|`|JBOEzcWMaa	cartilage is more likely to get infected. i had mine done by a professional twice, and both times it swelled up to the point where it swallowed my earring! i just recently went for a third time and all seems to be going well, i am taking extra precautions with it this time like washing it with neutrogena in the shower (which is a colorless, odorless soap). Its not that expensive to get it done by a professional, most places just make you pay for the earring which was $20 for me. on top of that they give you ear solution which youll need anyway<br>  <br>  if your doing it yourself, dont do anything dumb like using a old needle (which could be rusty). make sure you sanitize the sh-t out of it with alcohol. you need a pure gold (like 14 ct.), or surgical steel earring. if you do it yourself you may see alot of blood if you cant get the earring in after piercing it with the needle.<br>  <br>  its easier with a professional. its sanitary, safe, no blood, and they use a piercing earring + a piercing gun which will hurt alot less because you wont have to wrestle to get the earring in a fresh wound.|`|59uL6oEVaa	I did it. go to a tattoo parlor or some where and get the special cleaner to clean your ear after you pierce it, be sure to clean it 3 times a day for the 1st month and 1/2 then go to twice a day<br>  <br>  clean your ear where you are piercing, mark where you are piercing (make sure its even)<br>  <br>  i used a safety, burn the end, then soak it in alcohol for 30 sec, then rinse it off, poke it through your ear|`|kAhXleGaaa	dont do it yourself<br>  dont get it done at claires or walmart or any other non professionnal place.<br>  <br>  go to a respectable tattoo parlor and get it done there.<br>  unless of course, you want to shatter your cartilage and have a deformed ear.|`|bKDBbGmuaa	you can try to do it own your own but you better plan own some pain it hurt like  hellllll lol just strilize the needle with alcohol and then get it realy hottt with a lighter then keep your stud in for three to four weeks|`|6Z49DZaRaa	No, it's really not smart at all. It can get infected very easily, which will be both painful and disgusting. Get it professionally done, please. You'll regret it if you don't.|`|CkqW2NWJaa	eww|`|eHrc9NPcaa	my advice no it is not a good idea|`|nga1mAaVaa	that's a bad idea<br>  go to claires or any other store that gives u peircings|`|lFzXZQQDaa	if you truly must do it yourself, then make sure you have the gun to do it and alcohol to clean and hold it on.|`|b547929972268709bf8bbb1b26d14c33aa	unfortunately you cant do it yourself. everything need to be sterile  and if you dont pierce the correct area of cartlidge (in your ear) it can cause severe infection and paralysis on the  one side of your face. (usually the opposited side to where you are piercing) This happened to a girl that had her ear cartlidge pierced at the pharmacy I worked at, the person doing the piercing with the gun put it in the incorrect place, so go to a specialist to get it right. Its worth it.|`|jp9OzuXoaa	I wouldn't do it. It's a lot more likely you'll get an infection if you do it. You're even better off going to Icing or Claire's to get it pierced than to do it yourself (seriously, a gun isn't THAT bad..but it's not ideal). The best option is to get it pierced with a needle at a tattoo parlor though. :)|`|9f2391ebf6a1c505bb9421899963d771aa	Never ever do it yourself. Get it done professionally so it will not get infected, is safe, and is done properly. Will look good then. Is saving 30-40 dollars worth possibly messing up your ears for good??|`|I0g24Jmkaa	funny you should mention cartilage, I don't have any in my ears. lol
L3j2HrsJaa	It doesn't have to be baby powder, can be any loose powder. It protects your skin from sticking to a wax too much so you can actually rip it off. I wax my upper lip with a wax strips and before I started to use powder first, it always ripped a little of my skin off, it was very painful and left me with scars. It doesn't happen any more with powder:)|`|4TNavgDuaa	I never do I just put lotion of after like Aloe or something.|`|nNSoOWQDaa	You can put that on before you wax your underarms if you are sweating. It absorbs the excess moisture. But I've never heard of using it to wax any other areas.|`|9RtdvLEKaa	It stops the wax from sticking to your skin a little and then it hurts less when you rip it off.|`|gyixPyOsaa	because you will chafe or better to explain it your skin will break out. like pimples and a ton of them|`|ojAo1U1caa	Absorbs oil.|`|ITOBWVakaa	It makes the car all powdery. I would NEVER put baby powder on before waxing. Just wax and then buff with a dry cloth.|`|ykcpQhWzaa	so it doesnt hurt as bad|`|zxzhkIIcaa	because it absorbs your body's oils and dirt's.
AA11143431	My sister didn't really like murad. <br>  I'm on proactive and it helped..take advantage of the money back guarantee! like seriously just try it for fun and return it. <br>  <br>  If your skin has small problems, then I would use clinique. <br>  It worked AMAZINGLY on my skin. so soft and clean. <br>  use that before a heavy duty kit!<br>  <br>  If you're one of those people having problems, PLEASE go visit the dermatologist before it gets out of control. Maybe you should get a better opinion.|`|SgVyW7KMaa	proactiv totally sucks and it gets really annoying putting it on like 10 times a day. skin id dosent work either and plus its expensive. nothing really works.|`|1VVJphsAaa	Murad sucks don't do it. You can go on acne.org to search up stuff.|`|5Yh8WN1Oaa	Proactiv worked for me. I think it just depends on your skin and how it reacts to the chemicals. At least with Proactiv, there's a money back guarantee.
1xwyCxdUaa	Do not touch it or scratch it!  The only time it should be touched is when you are cleaning it.  Always make sure to wash your hands before cleaning the piercing.<br>  <br>  If it does itch during the healing process, you may use a q-tip to gently scratch around the nose, but not the piercing itself.<br>  <br>  If it is sore, you can take an over the counter pain reliever like ibuprofen or Aleve.<br>  <br>  Mine healed up very well after just a couple of days.  It only bled the night I had it done and the very next morning.  Hopefully your healing will go just as well!|`|6f5d97506e44e2f09765d3f53912c478aa	You can cure Acne, but, a hole in the nose ..........

Fringe on your dresses is hot, but beware, as it's become a big trend, and you don't wanna look like everyone else (pleated or embroidered material is cool). <br>  Hairstyles include the short bob and the pincurls. <br>  A simple cat-eye done with liquid liner and some crimson lips should finish off the look!<br>  For day though, you should pick one main element, like the shoes or the headband, and play it up.<br>  For instance, wear the shoes with a plain A-line skirt and blouse, or the headband with skinny jeans and flat leather boots. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|g42Spkc8aa	try a cute flapper hairpiece with a white t-shirt and dark skinny jeans. it will put the emphysis on your cute headband and because the rest of the outfit is calm u won't look crazy at school or work

However, liking to wear it might be a little strange but at the same time I get why you probably do.  If you like the feel then it's comfortable for you to wear.  My advice to you is next time you're at the store find a pair of womens underwear you like and check what it's made out of on the tag (located inside on one of the side seams).  Then when you're shopping for mens underwear look for the same kind of fit you liked in womens and the same fabric/texture.|`|cWBbSGwVaa	Are you gay?

H6rPxpHWaa	1.Use a daily lotion or creamers that moisturize skin, such as: Gold Bond Ultimate; Dior Addict Shine Shimmering Body Lotion; Goat Milk Body Lotion; L'Occitane Verbana Harvest Body Lotion. These lotions that make your body shimmer and glow with softness. <br>  2.Apply it to your skin everyday, preferably when you get out of the shower. Water molecules mixed with lotion will make your skin soft and smooth than lotion alone. <br>  3.Use an oil free foaming cleanser. Rub it into your skin in a circular motion. DO this almost so lightly that you can't feel your fingers. <br>  4.Wear soft and light material like cashmere, cotton and silk. These animal furs will be light on your skin and will make your skin breathe. <br>  5.To go a step further, exfoliate your skin. Use an apricot exfoliator. It will rub off old skin cells, revealing fresh, healthier ones. Generally, massage the exfoliator onto your face and then wash it off after, once every day. <br>  6.Use a toner and slight moisturizing cream. It will help keep your skin young-looking. <br>  7.Avoid excessive make up and always wash it off before going to bed. <br>  8.Do not stress out. Be light hearted and have a fun time. This will help keep the skin pumping and fair. <br>  9.Create a Home Spa Treatment With Nail Polish, Jojoba Oil and Apricot Exfoliator. You can do this at home too, it is relaxing as well. <br>  <br>  Tips:<br>  ?Use water as warm as you can stand it but not so that it is scalding. also, get use a soft skin moisturnizer to penetrte the skins cells. <br>  ?Rinse with cool water to quickly close pores for a more youthful appearance. <br>  ?If you are acne prone use an alcohol free product as alcohol can cause dryness. <br>  ?If you wear makeup do so sparingly and be sure to gently but completely remove all of it each night.

AA11615154	Gray.<br>  Navy blue|`|10if4QTjaa	I'm thinking a blue that matches the converse, however you could try black with a blue pattern (argyle, stripes etc.), but matching isnt really necessary now is it and orange, red or green could do the job|`|mDt03eXIaa	Black and navy blue are both neutrals. So really, you can wear any color with it. I wouldn't go with pink or navy, but other than that, pretty much anything goes.|`|VQlXF8Ucaa	A Blue and Grey Argyle would look kewl.  Something similiar to the one below but with long sleeves, or you could do a hoodie.  Actually black goes with just about anything, so if you match the shoe color with the color or your shirt you should be okay.|`|6lul0GpKaa	You want either a dark blue, a gray, or a black with a blue shirt underneath. V-neck sweaters are in right now too!|`|090XbTRwaa	Grey, or a different shade of blue.|`|2aa3e62419587ab0885853d9e4a8ffc0aa	gray, or blue, or a combination of the 2|`|LVRBtXGuaa	white

If my hair is looking frizzy I put conditioner on my hairbrush and brush it in. It smells very good.|`|FiOaEFuOaa	put some perfume on it
DJ3QGkYiaa	I have curly hair that I usually straighten, but when I only want a slight wave I braid it.<br>  <br>  After showering and brushing out your hair put little braids in it starting from the base to the crown. The bigger the braids the less of a wave. Small tight braids will make your hair look like you used a crimper. <br>  <br>  After putting in the braids fasten them with small rubber bands and let dry. You can speed up the process by using a hairdryer but that may cause frizziness and flyaway.<br>  <br>  I also recommend putting some product in your hair like either a cream or a small amount of gel, just to help keep shape.<br>  <br>  I've done as many as 30 braids and as few as 4. Both with very different outcomes.<br>  <br>  This will give you some wave without having to spend any money.... unless you need hair rubberbands.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!!! =)|`|CEEWrIqjaa	Use a curling iron with a medium sized barrel. When you curl, start at the bottom and curl to the top, then when you are taking the curling iron out, slide out dont pull..or you can use bumble and bumble beach waves spray, you spray it on wet hair and either use a diffuser piece on the blow dryer to dry or let air dry outdoors.|`|LVRBtXGuaa	well i have short hair.. and if i want it curly.. well wavey.. when i get out of the shower.. i lightly dry my hair with a towel.. were the hair is still damp.. scrunch the hair between your fingers, shake your hair between your fingures.. use some hair spray, to help it stay in place, and you should be good to go|`|g42Spkc8aa	try curling shampoo

xU3uBy4Saa	It did hurt yeah, but it wasn't like excruciating pain.  It hurts more that any other piercing just because it is a thick piece of cartlage.  But once it's pierced, the healing process sucks.  It is sore for a few weeks, but after that.  It is perfectly fine.|`|3ba2d12320bf7bcc5762865bed173631aa	Actually mine didn't hurt at all! I have a few piercings and this one hurt the least! I mean it didn't feel good, but all it is, is the pressure from the ring. So don't think of it as pain, think of it as pressure. But no, mine did not hurt, it was a small "pop" and it was over. I could sleep on it the next night. <br>  <br>  I love mine! I would recommend it!|`|rFUPo4YDaa	Mine didn't hurt at all & it happens to be my favorite piercing.|`|T7ZVlHyLaa	like a *****. i have a rook that didn't hurt at all :)|`|24Xy8qWtaa	Does having herpes hurt?
iPje1iyGaa	I am currently in love with John Frieda Root Awakening.  It has natural eucalyptus so it smells great and feels cool and tingly on the scalp.  This shampoo/conditioner works to repair your hair from the roots down.<br>  <br>  Also, Fredderik Fekkai is AMAZING.  Only problem is, it's very expensive.|`|qb8bAzd7aa	I would use Pantene or Treseme.|`|GhkfQiVPaa	Dove is really good and so is garne frutis.|`|LdlNMvsbaa	good question...|`|QXYuWOvraa	I'm currently using Dove Intense Damage Therapy shampoo and conditioners.<br>  I'm amazed. Seriously. I've never been overly impressed with drugstore shampoos/conditioners...but these I LOVE.<br>  I don't even have to style it.. I just let it dry naturally. It's so soft and shiny. <br>  I'm loving it. If they ever stop making it I'm in serious trouble.<br>  Hmm... I've also tried Rusk, and Organix lines for dry/damaged hair and the WEN haircare system. not impressed :)<br>  good luck!|`|ip0VuS3Daa	herbal essence make sure you use conditioner!!!!!! it helps ALOT!|`|fscgp7iFaa	I use Pert 2 in 1 shampoo with Pureology Conditioner. Pureology is only sold at fine hair product stores and is quite expensive. Like salons. But it works miracles also I would try some sort of deep conditioning treatment. Also try putting some hair conditioner into your hair and put a shower cap on it. Sleep with the conditioner in your hair and in the morning wash it out. It works very well for undamaging hair and making it look smooth and soft. Just do that whenever you need it. The better the conditioner the better the results. Garneir Fructis is also a great conditioner for a good price.|`|VVQYuMO1aa	herbal essences breakage shampoo it will help strenthen your hair also use herbal essences moisterizing conditioner or shampoo they work!!!!

xXGn1zfsaa	Not necessarily, but more malleable, and you can do more with it.<br>  It doesn't "thin out" though|`|8c56135cd4589e0631905a4f324f3f20aa	I'd say yes|`|XLRx5decaa	Yes.|`|AA10599330	Yes because the molecules in the liquid become farther apart thus making it thinner. Just look at ice cubes, when water is at it's freezing point the molecules get extremely close and can hold their shape.|`|DMhAPurkaa	Yes <br>  even metal when heated is thinner, it thickens up and becomes a solid when cooled|`|6Qou3Pxdaa	yep

Just yesterday, I received Third Runner Up in a pageant that was about confidence and stage presence, so those are extremely important, possibly the two most important things about becoming a famous actress!<br>  If acting is really your passion and dream, then you should try hiring an agent - but remember, they're expensive. If you end up hiring an acting agent, you pay them to go around and see if anyone will cast you. They're very helpful, but so pricey!<br>  <br>  Get experience!

The ends of your hair are actually the most damaged area of the hair shaft, seeming as this hair has been there the longest. Just use a hairdress or something of the sort on the ends for a few days.

Honestly, if i were you, i would get a quote from her. i mean like something she said alot. or something she really believed in. that way whenever you seen it, it would be just a little more personal. idk bout the heart thing though. it is very common. but if that's what you want. i would look for a symbol of new beginnings. or luck, or happiness, because she is happy now too. maybe something that attaches to your heritage? like if your irish or german? whatever it is, make it amazing, get a kick *** tattoo artist, and be happy youre getting it. 100% sure that's what you want. Good luck!|`|rlXGRjAHaa	Okay well I love the idea of you getting something for your mother, but I would suggest that you think deep and hard about getting it even if it extends the time of getting it..

Its really great.|`|6qPFNkyDaa	Karl Lagerfeld|`|cbEOXkugaa	Gabrielle Bonheur "Coco" Chanel was a pioneering French fashion designer whose modernist philosophy, menswear-inspired fashions, and pursuit of expensive simplicity made her an important figure in 20th-century fashion. Her influence on haute couture was such that she was the only person in the field to be named on TIME Magazine's 100 most influential people of the 20th century.<br>  <br>  Chanel was born the second daughter of traveling salesman Albert Chanel and Jeanne Devolle in the small city of Saumur, Maine-et-Loire, France. There was a miss-spelling on her birth certificate that recorded her surname as "Chasnel", making the tracing of her roots almost impossible for biographers when Chanel later rose to prominence. Coco was born in a poorhouse. Her birth was recorded the following day. Two employees of the hospice went to city hall and declared the child of feminine gender. The hospice employees were illiterate, so when the mayor Fran?ois Poitu wrote down the birth, no one knew how to spell Chanel so the mayor improvised and recorded it with an "s", making it Chasnel. Her parents married in 1883. She had five siblings: two sisters, Julie (1882-1913) and Antoinette (born 1887) and three brothers, Alphonse (born 1885), Lucien (born 1889) and Augustin (born and died 1891). In 1895, when she was 12 years old, Chanel's mother died of tuberculosis and her father left the family a short time later because he needed to work to raise his children. Because of his work, the young Chanel spent seven years in the orphanage of the Roman Catholic monastery of Aubazine, where she learned the trade of a seamstress. School vacations were spent with relatives in the provincial capital, where female relatives taught Coco to sew with more flourish than the nuns at the monastery were able to demonstrate. When Coco turned eighteen, she left the orphanage, and took up work for a local tailor.<br>  <br>  While working at a tailoring shop she met and soon began an affair with the French playboy and millionaire étienne Balsan who lavished her with the beauties of "the rich life", diamonds, dresses and pearls. While living with Balsan, Chanel began designing hats as a hobby, which soon became a deeper interest of hers. After opening her eyes, as she would say, Coco left Balsan and took over his apartment in Paris, France. In 1913, she opened up her very first shop which sold a range of fashionable raincoats and jackets. Situated in the heart of Paris, France it wasn't long before the shop went out of business and Chanel was asked to surrender her properties. This did not discourage Chanel; it only made her more determined. During the pre-war era, Chanel met up with an estranged and former best friend of étienne Balsan, Arthur "Boy" Capel, with whom she soon fell in love. With his assistance, Chanel was able to acquire the property and financial backing to open her second millinery shop in Brittany, France. Her hats were worn by celebrated French actresses, which helped to establish her reputation. In 1913, Chanel introduced women’s sportswear at her new boutique in Deauville, in the Rue Gounaut-Biron; Marthe, Countess de Gounaut-Biron (daughter of American diplomat, John George Alexander Leishman), was Chanel's first aristocratic client. Her third shop and successor to her biggest store in France was located in Deauville, France, where more women during the World War I era came to realize that women were supposed to dress for themselves and not their men.<br>  <br>  Later in life, she concocted an elaborate false history for her humble beginnings. Chanel would steadfastly claim that when her mother died, her father sailed for America and she was sent to live with two cold-hearted spinster aunts. She even claimed to have been born in 1893 as opposed to 1883, and that her mother had died when Coco was six instead of twelve. All this was done to diminish the stigma that poverty, orphan hood, and illegitimacy bestowed upon unfortunates in nineteenth-century France.<br>  <br>  In 1920, she was introduced by ballet empresario Sergei Diaghilev to world famous composer Igor Stravinsky (The Rite of Spring), to whom she extended an offer for him and his family to reside with her. During this temporary sojourn it was rumoured that they had an affair.<br>  <br>  In 1923, she told Harper's Bazaar that "simplicity is the keynote of all true elegance." Coco Chanel always kept the clothing she designed simple , comfortable and revealing. She took what were considered poor fabrics like jersey and upgraded them. She was instrumental in helping to design the image of the 1920s flapper, a "new breed" of young women who wore short skirts, bobbed their hair, listened to jazz music, and flaunted their disdain for what was then considered acceptable behavior. The flappers were seen as brash for wearing excessive makeup, drinking, treating sex in a casual manner, smoking, driving automobiles, and showing a lot of skin.<br>  <br>  These are the basics.

They sell them at Victoria's Secret where you can get fitted so you get the precise size.  Otherwise get fitted at VS anyways (it's free) and make sure to tell them you're looking at sizing for a corset.  Then you can choose your size and the right color (just in case any shows by accident) for your dress and skin tone.  Make sure it's high quality as well, you want to be able to wear it over and over.|`|NqUgoRUQaa	go to  a bridal store a good bra can be from casha|`|F4aJ3LTTaa	Davids Bridal....
e1434520b7d6b7db2b483084c9ad434aaa	You shouldn't brush your hair dry!!! That's what's making it huge. If you want to have less huge, more defined curls you need to let it dry without touching or brushing it. I may not have the same curly hair type as you but here are some good product suggestions:<br>  - Drugstore: L'oreal out of bed weightless texturizer (black tub, use under gel), LA Looks or Herbal essences gels, Suave naturals or vo5 conditioners, L'oreal vive pro hydra gloss or nutri gloss for curly hair, red Cream of Nature shampoo<br>  - Organic/specialty store (like whole foods): Giovanni Direct Leave in condish, G conditioners, G tea tree shampoo, Aubrey Organics Honeysuckle Rose or White Camellia Conditioners, AO B-5 Design gel<br>  - ULTA: Devacurl products, Biosilk rock hard gelee, MOP-c curl defining cream (They also carry drugstore products and giovanni.)<br>  <br>  If you really want a miracle product check out these forums:<br>  <a href="http://www.naturallycurly.com/curltalk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.naturallycurly.com/curltalk/</a><br>  There you can find others with the same hair type and try out some of their favorite products. However, the most popular ones are usually only available online and are more expensive.<br>  <br>  Here are some basic tips for curly hair that you might find helpful:<br>  *Try to find a stylist who knows how to work with curly hair. You can find reviews by region here: <a href="http://www.naturallycurly.com/curlsalons" rel="nofollow">http://www.naturallycurly.com/curlsalons</a><br>  *Don't shampoo every day.<br>  *Comb conditioner through hair in the shower.<br>  *Apply styling products to dripping wet hair. Scrunch or twirl hair to achieve desired shape.<br>  *Use styling products suited for your hair type. Don’t know yours? <a href="http://www.naturallycurly.com/hair-types" rel="nofollow">http://www.naturallycurly.com/hair-types</a><br>  *Avoid terrycloth towels on hair; use linen, paper towels, or t-shirts instead.<br>  *Air dry or use a diffuser with your blowdryer.<br>  *Don't touch (or brush!) your hair while it’s drying.<br>  *Once completely dry scrunch out any crunchy texture.<br>  <br>  Lastly, it has made my hair so much better since I started the curly girl method! I used to almost never wear it down (it was a frizz/poof ball), but now I have pretty, shiny curls. ~:) It’s pretty radical—no sulfates (shampoo) or silicones—but it’s so great for curly hair.

That should stop the friz. Use a really good hair conditioner, I personally like Pureology. It is quite expensive though and its only sold at fine hair salons. If you want to straighten it that try a straightening conditioner (pureology offers this) and use a straightening molding mousse/wax. And put some hairspray on for long lasting hold. Also you can get it chemically straightened or something ask a salon worker.|`|IfbggtJOaa	i have really terrible curly/frizzy hair too and i've tried a ton of products and NONE work.

QXYuWOvraa	There's this stuff I found at Walgreens ( I know wal mart doesnt carry it, by CVS, etc probably would)<br>  It's called color OOPS, and its a color remover, not a bleach.<br>  I dyed my hair black over the summer, and when it started to grow out i didnt want to do black anymore.<br>  It took me back to my light brown hair!!!<br>  But when they say RINSE, they mean it. I'm serious, like a good solid 15 minutes of shampoo and rinse shampoo and rinse again and again.<br>  I had to do it twice.<br>  The first time I didnt rinse well enough. I blow dried it was happy with the light brown color but when i woke up in the morning the color has already redeposited on my hair and it was dark again! UGH<br>  So the second time I rinsed until i thought my arms would fall off.<br>  It worked :) and its not harsh on your hair.<br>  be warned though the stuff smells awful... like sulfur/rotten eggs/hair perm. <br>  SO-- I'd use that THEN bleach it, then dye it and then USE AN AWESOME DEEP CONDITIONER and lay off too much heat styling.<br>  That's a lot for hair to take.<br>  If you can wait-- strip the color out..wait a few weeks..bleach it then dye it. Instead of all in one day.<br>  Good luck and I hope it looks awesome!! :)|`|ZkBHLjAcaa	I'd be careful when dying or bleaching over black. I dyed my hair black once and when I asked my hairdresser if I could change it back to brown she said there was a risk that it could go reddish or greenish if I tried to put another colour through it. She also said bleaching would be really bad for my hair. In the end I just waited for mine to grow out and my hairdresser advised me to just dye it dark brown next time as it's a lot easier and less risky to change.|`|viuC1rRNaa	You may want to go to a professional to have the color stripped, or use one at home to get the black out. Black dye can be ridiculously hard to get out through bleaching alone & if you want striking results, I would suggest trying Color Oops to strip the black first.|`|vvB0Etysaa	Hi:<br>  You can strip your hair out with a chemical purchased at the drugstore and dye it to the color you like.

idhcqr5Daa	Plug the sink you'll be using. Fill it about halfway with lukewarm water. Let the water run from the faucet a little bit while you do this. Set your towel (use a hand towel), on the rim of the sink where you will be leaning. <br>  Wet your face. You can splash it or use a washcloth. <br>  Squirt a dollop of blackhead clearing scrub onto your fingertips. Apply to your nose, chin, and wherever else you get blackheads. Apply in small, circular motions on affected areas. Rinse off very well. You may pat some access water off if you wish, but keep your skin wet. <br>  Put a half dollar size blob of cream cleanser into your palm. Dip into it with your other hand. Apply all over face (in small circular motions, avoiding lips and eye area. Let sit for 30 seconds, and rinse off. <br>  Apply the acne clearing scrub in circular motions all over face. Rinse off, and pat face dry with a towel. <br>  Apply an on the spot acne treatment cream/gel to pimples and acne affected areas. Dab it, rubbing it into your skin. Top with lotion. Spread lotion all over your face. Use a moisturizing or facial lotion. <br>  Do this every other night.You may use whatever brands you want to. They should have the same effect. <br>  In the mornings, when you wake up, wet your face (you can do this in the shower), and wash with the cream cleanser. Rinse. When you get out, pat face dry.

Baking powder will NOT work.|`|yMYPPQsKaa	It depends on the type of acne you have, not everything will work. Benzoyl peroxide enhances hair growth! so i use salicylic acid- 1%. Another good tip would be not to smear everything all over for face but deal with each pimple. Those active ingredients tend to dry out skin, so moisturizing is crucial when using such chemicals. As far as prevention, keeping your face clean with a morning and night face wash is the best thing. Also green tea and chamomile are said to prevent acne.|`|IVxO6fNRaa	i saw this on youtube =/ you put a lil baking powder in a cup and mix it up with water then put it on ur face for an hour then rainse it off with warm water =/ nvr tried it (ALWAYS forget to buy baking powder at the store) so im not sure if it'll work 100%

If this does not work see a hairdresser to straighten your hair out.  Ask the hairdresser to thin out some of your hair.

lLZBZbd3aa	Get some type of bottle to dispense the dye. A good idea would be to use something like a mustard or ketchup bottle like you would find in some restaurants. You want something just like that, but maybe a little smaller. <br>  Get a white T-shirt and wet it. Wring it out pretty good, so it is damp. Lay it out on a flat surface. Put your finger in an area around the middle. That will be the center of your spiral. <br>  Leaving your finger in the middle of the shirt, begin to wind the shirt around your finger, making sure the shirt stays relatively flat. Continue to do that until you get it all wound up. It should be about as tall as a doorknob, and the diameter relatively close to that of a saucer. <br>  Put three to four rubber bands around it. You should space them out relatively evenly, so it sort of looks like a pie. <br>  Fill up your sink with just enough water so that the shirt can be fully submerged. Pour a good bit of soda ash into the water. Not a ton, but a decent amount. Mix it in with the water fairly well. Let the shirt soak in that for about 20-25 minutes. When the 20 minutes are up, wring the shirt out fairly well. Do not rinse. <br>  When you put the colors in, you want add enough so you don't see white. You don't want to put so much in that there are little puddles lying around on the shirt. Make sure you get into all the little folds of the shirt. For each section (the little things that look like slices of pie), alternate colors. You could also mix colors, like blue and yellow. <br>  Get some plastic wrap or something and cover your shirt for 24 hours. <br>  After 24 hours, run water over the shirt until the water dripping out is fairly clear. Then you can cut the rubber bands off to see what it looks like. <br>  Directly after rinsing, throw just the shirt into the washer with warm water. Use liquid soap. After the wash, just throw it into the dryer for about 20 minutes. <br>  <br>  Rise the shirt and wash with warm water. Then Dryer. Hope this helps|`|WO68RZdIaa	Soaking in vinegar or salt usually will not help to fix dyes in cotton t-shirts.

QGZBlceuaa	First answer is right, it will hurt.<br>  <br>  I'd wait until you're older and had children to get this tattoo. (If you plan on having children.)<br>  <br>  My boss had a clover on her stomach area, got pregnant, had the baby... and now that clover looks like an ugly broccoli stalk.|`|WLuEIwp5aa	You can feel it in your organs, and once you get on the lower floating ribs, you can feel your diaphragm vibrating and that makes your whole torso burn.<br>  <br>  It sucks, but you can get through it if you want it.|`|Rr4IVYbvaa	Oh god yes.<br>  This is the part of the body where you skin is the toughest and hardest to tattoo.<br>  <br>  I was in my friends parlour the other day getting my foot done and saw a grown man who had survived jail tear up getting his side done.<br>  <br>  Also, if you are female, be warned a tattoo here can stretch and turn horrible very easily, so don't get something too detailed, especially if you are young [Hopefully you're over 18]|`|yWUIMiyyaa	**** dude it hurt so bad when it hit me lower ribs, worst spot but totally worth, it'll look way cool.  that's were i got my first tattoo was on my left side in the middle and towards my back, oooo just thinking about some of the spots just make me hurt, lol, enjoy|`|ezzSeBnLaa	yeah it's most def gonna hurt a bunch.

QLthbgULaa	I would recommend using bubble bath or shower gel in the bath before body mist...the body mist has a fair amount of alcohol in it, and I'm not sure what kind of effect that would have. The other products are designed to be used all over. If you do decide to try body mist in the bath, make sure you rinse off very well afterward to avoid irritation.<br>  <br>  Also, I always recommend testing a product on the soft skin on the inside of your wrist (about midway between the hand and elbow) because that skin tends to be very sensitive. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|vq8b1AOuaa	Lol, I've never tried that. I don't think it'd do you any harm. If may actually stimulate your skin. So, I'd try it but then again, there could be risk factors. hehe

MAKE SURE YOU KEEP IT CLEAN! and also if it gets really dry, keep lotion on it.|`|cxPbuOpfaa	You should really never pop pimples unless you REALLY have to, because it can leave a scar for a long time. But once I had to really badly, like you, so here's how I did it:<br>  <br>  Wash your hand very thoroughly (anti-bacterial soap!) as well as the area with the pimple. You can pop it gently with a fingernail if it is a whitehead, but you might have to soak it first. Then drain out the liquid and put on neosporin.|`|vq8b1AOuaa	I would not pop it if I were you. If there is a white head, then let it pop itself because then you won't bruise that spot and then it'll be a black head.|`|fqP7sTxKaa	pop it
V4qIrlZ5aa	If you take thin small sections at a time when your straightening that should help.If it's still a little wavy after that then it could be your straightener.Also if you try to straighten it when its not completely dry or you put to much product in it,your hair will not get super straight because it still has to much moisture in it. Maybe try those pointers and see if that helps.Its good your using a heat protectant....most people don't and that's how their hair gets fried.|`|iQ2hMr09aa	wide flatirons are better for really curly/wavy/thick hair. if you really want to though, you could get a really good brand (like chi) you can get them cheaper on amazon.com- <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Farouk-Limited-Styling-Package-Straightener/dp/B000IOI4CY/ref=pd_bbs_12?ie=UTF8&s=hpc&qid=1235361272&sr=8-12" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Farouk-Limited-Sty...</a> it really is a good flatiron. my hair makes really tight ringlets and it straightens it perfectly. the products that come with it are really good too.|`|jdQzoK2faa	its your straightner <br>  cuz i have super thick curly/wavy hair <br>  but when i straighten it <br>  it comes out super straight<br>  i use Revlon Stylix <br>  i bought it at wal-mart* lol <br>  so you should try that|`|Z5q8CCIWaa	I don't know if you know these things, but here ya go:<br>  Always comb the section of hair you're about to straighten right before you straighten it. I put the comb in the section I'm straightening and just run the flat-iron right behind it.<br>  Use the lowest heat possible.<br>  Your flat-iron shouldn't have plates wider than 1.5 in.<br>  When you're straightening your hair turn the flat-iron inwards, so it looks like you're curling it. It won't curl it though, trust me.<br>  Be patient and use small sections of hair. Move the flat-iron very slowly instead of moving it fast over and over.<br>  <br>  Here's a good tutorial: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH61NOdef-Y" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH61NOdef...</a>|`|RH8fy0Otaa	I have the same problem too and there is only one Straightener that has ever worked for me I bought it at a Jcpenny salon.

idhcqr5Daa	Start early. Once they pass the initial stage (when they are red, purple, pink, or brown, depending on the color of your skin) and become white or silver (usually with deep indentation), it's far more difficult to minimize them.[1] <br>  Massage the area with stretch marks three or four times a day with moisturizers that contain cocoa butter or shea butter as a prime ingredient. This hydrates the skin, making it more pliant. Again, this is most effective in the initial stage.[1] <br>  Apply self-tanner. It will help minimize the appearance of stretch marks. Exfoliate beforehand for best results.[2] <br>  Educate yourself about topical treatments. Many are advertised to "repair" stretch marks, but few have actually been proven to be effective. Here's the scoop on what's available:<br>  Wheat germ oil - may help improve stretch marks in their early phase.[1] <br>  Glycolic acid - increases collagen production; can be administered in higher doses by a dermatologist (costs about $100 USD and requires three or four office visits before you see results); has not been fully studied by itself[1] <br>  Vitamin C - certain formulations might increase collagen production, but they'll only help with early-stage stretch marks; for best results, combine with glycolic acid; taking 500 mg of Vitamin C supplements three times a day may also help.[1] <br>  Relastin - the effectiveness of this product is unknown and unverified[1] <br>  Peptide-containing products - these "repair" creams are ineffective; there's no evidence that they work.[1] <br>  Retinoids - they're fairly effective in increasing collagen and elastic production in the early stages, but they should be avoided if you're pregnant or nursing; they're more effective when used in combination with glycolic acid.[1] <br>  Topical tretinoin can lighten stretch marks and reduce their size if applied in the earlier stages.[3] Specifically, tretinoin cream is effective against stretch marks that are less than 6 weeks old, and are still pink or red, but it should not be used during pregnancy. It works by helping to rebuild collagen, but it's not effective against older stretch marks.[4] <br>  Consider laser treatment. It's used to treat both red/purple and white stretch marks, and generally it works by promoting the formation of collagen. It can be expensive, however, and effectiveness is limited.<br>  vascular lasers - won't remove superficial skin, but are effective against redness by treating the blood vessels behind it; E.g. V-Beam, requires three to six sessions, about $450 per session[1] <br>  fractionated laser - minimizes older, more entrenched stretch marks in a process comparable to "smudging"; expect to pay around $1000 USD per session, and you'll need at least three sessions; yields about a 30% improvement.[1] new generation fractional lasers can improve depressed skin, whiteness, and redness in one to three sessions[5] <br>  pulsed dye laser therapy "remodels" the underlying layers of skin and trigger the production of collagen and elastin; it's most effective on new stretch marks, but might be effective on older ones.[4] The light heats blood vessels and makes them collapse so that the color is reduced, but it doesn't affect texture. Five treatments, one month apart, $500-800 per treatment.[2] It is not recommended for anyone with a dark skin tone (Fitzpatrick Skin Type IV, V or VI) because of the potential for skin discoloration, and it should not be used while pregnant or nursing.[6] <br>  fractional photothermolysis also targets the underlying layers of skin; it damages small dot-like areas, not the entire area.[4] <br>  the excimer laser triggers melanin production so that stretch marks take on the same color as the surrounding skin. This can be effective against older stretch marks.[4] Excimer laser is for older marks. 10-20 treatments, two weeks apart, $200-700 per treatment.[2] <br>  Look into microdermabrasion. Microdermabrasion works by blowing crystals onto the skin to "polish" the surface; it's followed by a vacuum tube that removes the crystals and skin cells, stimulating new skin growth. This is effective against older stretch marks.[4] <br>  <br>  x0x0_LEi|`|1quhJiuYaa	Mederma is the best thing I've seen for skin marks of all kinds.  It's $10-$12 a tube and a $3 off coupon is availble on the website below. You use one tube per month. <br>  <br>  The sun's UVA and UVB rays can make your scar look worse. NEW Mederma?

aleWoJufaa	You have to do aerobic exercise to rid the fat: walking, running, swimming, etc. Exercise is also good for your heart!|`|a6hQftotaa	Everyone has rolls when they sit<br>  Well you can do ab work, running will help too|`|330718658afa202c6c1e35e1fbc8785faa	It's nearly impossible to reduce fat in one certain area by diet and exercise; you will need to lose weight overall.<br>  <br>  A thick waist though means a lot of visceral fat (fat inside your body cavity around your organs), so losing a few pounds would probably be beneficial. Running is great exercise though!! Just be sure not to overdo it. Losing too much weight at once can be dangerous.<br>  <br>  To slim your waist immediately, try a waist cincher or a girdle. It will compress your midsection, and smooth any "rolls". Start slow, and eventually get to the point when you can wear it all night, and possibly during the day. I'm sure it would not be comfortable or practical to wear while running, but after a while, it is possible to "train" your waist to a certain size! google "tightlacing", and you will see what I mean. (the extreme tightlacers are gross though, imo!)

TnQEOdX0aa	I've had my navel pierced for about 4 years now, and my tongue for a little more than 2 years.<br>  It should not hurt during the actual piercing. When I had mine done, it didn't hurt or bleed at all. It hurts like a bruise for a whilw afterwards though, because your tongue is a muscle. It kind of feels like you excersized your tongue a whole lot, haha.<br>  It is hard to eat, talk, and drink with some people.<br>  I got it done at a really good place and no, it should not get infected easily.<br>  My tongue has never been infected, and it healed perfectly. As long as you take good care of it, brush your teeth and use non-alcoholic mouthwash often, there should be no infection. <br>  An about the bleeding, if it does bleed alot, you have gone to the wrong place.|`|PyjZVn28aa	belly button is cute...iam thinking about getting one..i have my nose pierced already...the tounge iam not sure about...it will hurt your belly because you wont be able to eat for a few weeks...hey..if you are over 18 and your parents dont care...and you want it...have fun...|`|bnNcPAknaa	Pshh , the combination WILL NOT make you look like hoe.<br>  But It does hurt & the healing is the WORST part.

DJ3QGkYiaa	You'll be fine. <br>  <br>  Sea salt solutions are the best thing to use on a fresh piercing.<br>  <br>  Not all surface piercings reject although MANY of them do.<br>  <br>  You will notice if your body starts to reject it. The skin that was once pierced will decrease in size. Unfortunately this is typical of surface piercings because of the amount of pressure your body is exerting on them. Eyebrow piercings are surface piercings as well so your piercing is no more dangerous than having your eyebrow pierced(which is a very common piercing). Although your piercing is in a spot harder to heal.<br>  <br>  Just continue to soak with sea salts, make sure your jeans don't rub up against it, and at all cost DON"T PLAY WITH IT.<br>  <br>  If you still decide you want to remove it wait until it's healed. If you take a piercing out before it is healed there is a small chance you could do more harm then good. There is always a small chance you could have a tiny infection in ANY fresh piercing and if you take it out during that time you actually seal the bacteria in your body.<br>  <br>  So give it some time, let it heal, if you decide to take it out the scar will be minimal. <br>  <br>  You can always use vitamin E on your scar once you take it out and it has healed/sealed up. Vitamin E is proven to help heal and lessen the appearance of scars. You can even buy Vitamin E capsules split them open and apply directly to your skin.<br>  <br>  You will be fine just continue to take care of it.<br>  <br>  ....if it does reject it shouldn't be painful,  you probably wouldn't even notice. You would just have a slightly larger scar. I know plenty of people who went to sleep one night and woke up with jewelry next to them in the morning and that was the end of it. If your body does in fact reject your piercing I would not opt for any more surface piercings. You may just not be a good candidate for one.|`|47yyxtTPaa	Just be really gentle with it Its most likely to reject more then 70% of rejecting. Its not harmful for you unless it gets infected or ripped out. Also if it rejects or you take it out it scars really bad so watch out and just be careful around it they really easily rip out.(i have hip piercings which is a surface piercing on my stomach i know)
jez0O0bXaa	Yes that is the best way to do it and will not be a shocking change. ask your stylist to see swatches of color and ask her opinion.|`|HTtE3rK6aa	Since you want to go back to your natural color but not right away i would suggest dying it a darker blonde and skip the low lights, but as for the roots growing out gracefully i would just go straight to light brown

I use Buxom from Sephora, whenever my eyes get moist I never get black tear marks.

However, before swim practice, I had to be in a picture of the swim team. One of the girls put some of her MAC eyeshadow on me,  and it was still there after practice. It's really expensive, so I'm trying to make up my mind whether I should buy it or not. I'm still looking for liner and mascara that'll stay on though. Good luck!|`|vLoEL08xaa	Not really sure what I would recommend to you.

It is most likely to either slide off your face or dissolve in the water. What I would reccomend is a water proof mascara and maybe some clear lipgloss. You can probably find a great water proof mascara at any drug store, and for clear lipglosses-even smackers work!  The most I would put on your face is a TINY bit of concealer and just a hint of blush. But it will probably wash away in the pool<br>  Good luck!
1UwwiwzYaa	how about you try twisting or braiding the bangs and then pinning them to the side it will add a nice change to the hairstyle and i think it will prevent them from sticking out but im not sure since i havn't seen your hair|`|CsFkrTYNaa	maybe if you sweep all your bangs over to one side and kind of curl them in a little bit<br>  it makes for a nice full swept look|`|psVzfkW0aa	try pining them not on the top of ur head and not to the side but kinda in the middle. also if u pin them to the side, u can use hair spray or an extra pin so it dont stick out. or u can take the bangs and pin them up with a bow...................good luck!!!!|`|WiAObjkSaa	make your bangs a one-sided. for that, you might look cute and pretty :D it is also cute to look at when your hair is curly then you have a one-sided bangs.|`|5Wd6sIqbaa	Maybe you should cut your bangs shorter, like right above the eye and leave them straight.
Dgcy9Y94aa	There are several reasons your hair could be falling out. <br>  <br>  -Stress is a big one. Is there something hectic going on in your life? If so, this is probably the reason your hair is falling out. Try to sleep more & find a better way to cope with your problems; yoga & pilates are really good.<br>  <br>  -Do you frequently treat your hair chemically (ex: dye, relax, perm, etc.)? If so, this could be your problem. You need to take a chill pill on whatever you're doing with your hair. In time, it'll probably grow back.<br>  <br>  -Are you on medications? If you are, the hair loss may be a side effect related to your prescription. Some prescription types that cause hair loss are anti-depressants, anti-inflammatories, & blood pressure meds are known to cause hair loss.<br>  <br>  -Do you eat normally? Hair loss can be caused by an eating disorder. <br>  <br>  -If none of those two situations fit you, there's a possibility that you may have Alopecia. Alopecia is a disease that causes your hair to fall out. <br>  <br>  Overall, you should see your doctor & discuss your hair loss. He or she can run tests & really figure out the problem & properly treat you. Hope this helped =]|`|GUcKwQJPaa	it could be a thyroid problem, hormones, eatting disorders, dietary problems, or just a bad case of genetics...or perhaps stress or hair trauma.|`|OQSdjIcoaa	Your under a lot of stress most likely.

Check out <a href="http://usefulinfo-hairloss.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://usefulinfo-hairloss.blogspot.com/</a>  for more info.|`|7swefA6Paa	do you have an eating disorder? this could cause it.|`|TCpTlCTRaa	Teenage hair loss is becoming more common. There are many possible causes. The hair growth cycle is very sensitive to changes, imbalances or disturbances. Even a minor imbalance can disrupt the hair growth cycle and cause hair loss. Thinking back to the several month prior to hair loss may provide clues. Any new medications, vaccination, illness, infection, dental work, diet, weight loss, stress etc.<br>  The teenage years require additional care and nutrition to support the tremendous changes and growth that occurs during these years. Unfortunately poor nutrition and unhealthy habits are common during teenage years. This type of hair loss is usually temporary and reversible. Aromatherapy scalp massage treatments made with essential oils can help stimulate hair growth and minimize loss.|`|3oEkpDNQaa	it is most likely alopecia like she has<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0majhZL_fs&feature=channel_page" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0majhZL_...</a><br>  <br>  Alopecia Areata<br>  This disease shows up as the sudden appearance of round or oval patches of hair loss. These patches are completely slick, bald, or smooth without any signs of inflammation, scaling, or broken hairs. They appear overnight, or sometimes over a few days.<br>  <br>  Alopecia areata is thought to be caused by the body's immune system attacking the hair follicles. At any given moment about one in 1,000 children has alopecia areata. About 25% of these children also have pitting or ridging of the nails.<br>  <br>  With appropriate treatment, a large percentage of patients will have all of their hair back within one year -- many sooner. Children with alopecia areata should be under the care of a dermatologist. About 5% of children with alopecia areata will go on to develop alopecia totalis -- the loss of all the hair on the scalp. Some of these will develop alopecia universalis -- the complete loss of body hair.<br>  <br>  Diagnosis: Currently there are no conclusive diagnostic tests for alopecia areata. Dermatologists diagnose alopecia areata by a process of elimination of other hair loss causes and the close examination of the bald patch itself. Typically, the initial alopecia areata lesion appears as a smooth bald patch, sometimes within 24 hours. Some people feel a tingling sensation or pain in the affected area. <br>  The scalp is the most commonly affected area, but alopecia areata can be present in any area where there is hair on the body. Hair pull tests are sometimes conducted at the margins of lesions. If hair is easily pulled out, the lesion is active and further hair loss should be anticipated. Since alopecia areata is fairly distinctive, it is usually correctly diagnosed with a simple visual examination.<br>  <br>  Treatment: There is no cure for alopecia areata and, unfortunately, since there is little understanding of the disease, there are no FDA-approved drugs or treatments specifically designed to treat it.|`|jez0O0bXaa	Probably hormones. I would check with your Dr. it could be Alopecia.|`|ZyV2InIPaa	if its a small amount then it's normal.<br>  if you are seriously worried, you could have thyroid issues.
WhyALjR7aa	The important thing with Mineral makeup is to use the brushes correctly and apply it correctly.

06fc881bb66bd3508b2d3bc496ed0913aa	Here are some tips: <br>  1. You can make your own beauty mask out of yogurt and oatmeal. This can freshen up your face and rid it of stress and make up. <br>  2. Put in a slice of cucumber or cold bag of tea to your eyes to get rid of dark circles or eyebags due to staying up late all night. <br>  3. Dark spots in the knee, groin or armpit area can be minimized by rubbing lemon/kalamansi.<br>  4. For exfoliating your body, you can use soap with water and salt to scrub it without spending much on body scrubs.<br>  5.

wOhWnD2laa	I'd say cut it. You can style it in a more masculine way, as where long hair theres only two options- leave it down all ragedy, or grow it out long enough to do some ponytails. Short is more professional, and you wouldn't have that awkward in-between phase of where your waiting for it to grow out. Plus, it's probably alot more manageable.|`|WiAObjkSaa	i can't tell cause i don't see your face in the picture. its better we see your face so that we can imagine what is good for your hair and also to your looks. :p but for me, even though i didn't saw you face, i think you should grow your hair more because as i noticed, your hair looks soft and shinny and it's nice. :D|`|YPRw3xYDaa	We need a better pic. But I like guys with longer hair usually but I also like the military shave too. I just don't get into the medium lengths I guess.|`|Ddfff5psaa	I CAN'T TELL because I can't see your face.....|`|MsNrSGkYaa	i like the spikey gel look so cut it|`|BlZ6vJOAaa	grow out more definitely|`|JbSebJJYaa	I'd totally get it shorter on the sides.

332a5d7ed9823322da0c8c03289e67c5aa	A day spa would be cool........something where you can get your hair done, nails, facial, massage......spa food - like salads and sandwiches......and maybe a steam room.<br>  <br>  Another idea that has nothing to do with beauty or pampering is to have a teen-oriented pool hall. No beer or alcohol......but you could have pool tables and serve snack foods....could also get a few arcade machines (Ms. Pacman, Gallaga, etc.)<br>  That way you would appeal to both girls AND boys and the children would have a safe and fun place to hang out.|`|a90cda2e169aa7b754b566bdf5eb4d87aa	I live in a small town and there is absolutely nothing to do (besides going to our some 4 banks or 3 pharmacies). Personally I would love a spa type hangout, with a snack bar, a jacuzzi, and maybe some massages and facials. There are so many teenage girls here who have nothing but money (its a veryyyy rich town) to spend, and i think its a great idea. Plus it will give us a chance to relax and just be girls. I wish you were doing this in my town!!|`|B8WTrmR7aa	yeh i think that would be cool...pampare day out for the girls, good place to go for birthday day out with friends aswell, have a couch & t.v there with magazines should be kool. good look|`|e7098c2c46fda0c3c8d75e729ec86c39aa	An entire hangout area.. Like a spa where u could get your nails done, hair done etc.<br>  -- i agree it would be totally awesome!<br>  something else u could add would be a little restaurant..or salad bar just for teens<br>  (btw all the stores and hangouts should be under the same type of name.. so all the credit can go to u lol)<br>  anyways, u could also have a mini mall or an outlet!!<br>  -- That would be totally awesome.. and im sure EVERY teen would enjoy it.. then u could make a plaza where a little mini funplex could be.. rides inside could include go kartz.. a simulator, bumper karz, a miniature golf course, etc.<br>  lastly, u could add a club just for kids and teens to chill out in<br>  GOOD LUCK AND I HOPE I HELPED U OUT A LITTLE!!<br>  (p.s: how are u gonna do this all? i know how u feel cuz i live in a place just like u..)|`|fGbt89AGaa	Hmmm.... like what the first person said. So it's like a spa/salon./small restaurent? Sounds fun! :) First you'll need a place to do it so you can rent out a place (like an office or something) or use a basement. Fist you'll have to find some one good at makeovers, doing hair and nails. A fiew friends who are goood at that. Then get your parents or another friend or force your boyfriend,(joking!) to cook. Make cookies or cupcake and drinks. If you use a basement or rent out a place, use the hottube in the bathroom for a hottub! If there isn't one, Or use the bath tub. Then get stuff they can do ad make a place where you can talk. and get a pool table or something like that too! This might a bit expensive though, so at your school ask people to pitch in for the cost! (lol) Then when your done you could be the boss and everyone will be happy! I might do that myself,I live in the suburbs/city but still it sounds fun. Good Luck! Sorry for bad grammer I'm eatting icecream o it's hard. :)<br>  <br>     I just  read the end thing you wrote. Sorry I thought you were<br>  like 15. Take all the stuff I said except: hiar people don't use your friends, rent out a place, (as I said) and make people pay. Also get real spa equiptment. Once again sorry! But you have a REALLY good idea!|`|puzKQklVaa	I really don't want to be Johnny Raincloud, but where do you expect to come up with the money for this hangout? You would need to hire experienced nail technicians and buy all the equiptment they need to keep the business alive. Hot tubs aren't cheap, nor are they cheap to maintain. Restaurants take liscences and alot of working with health services before it can be functional, plus buying supplies and hiring cooks to prepare the food and dishwashers to clean up. Also, where is this little hang out going to be? You'll need to buy a building for this place, hire contractors to make sure the building is up to code for what you plan to use it for, and then buy special insurance customized for the business you plan on running. Your idea is nice, but unless you have as LEAST $10,000 (and probably way more) just lying around somewhere, I don't think it is feasable.<br>  If there isn't much in your town to do for young ladies, them theres a good chance there isn't much to do for young men as well. So why decide to discriminate against them? You have the right idea by wanting to make your community better, but you're thinking way too "Laguna Beach" on the subject. If you're really passionate about creating a hangout for young people, then I suggest attending your next town counsil meeting and bringing the subject up. It's possible that this subject is something they hadn't thought about before. Maybe they can make use of an empty building in your town by turning it into a government-funded recreation hall. And if they won't listen to you, take along a respected adult in your community to better adress the issue.<br>  I know what it's like to live in a town with nothing to do, so I wish you all the luck in the world!
ewqf6Tzraa	It would be awesome. <br>  <br>  People like Scarlet Johansson, Julianne Hough, Miley Cyrus and Vanessa Hudgens rock hair styles similar/exactly like that. <br>  <br>  I would def. try to look up how to get hair like theirs or even youtube it. <br>  <br>  It's usually curling your hair with a hot curler , or use hot rollers(I think that's what it's called)|`|7DG99jUnaa	hey it looks great the way it is what ever you don't cut it.it will look good with a wavy style to.so go ahead and do it will love to see it after|`|z5O056Beaa	I can see why u wanna change ur hair style<br>  <br>  Try Miley cyrus hair style in this pic<br>  <a href="http://i411.photobucket.com/albums/pp196/goofygirl1103/MILEY.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i411.photobucket.com/albums/pp196...</a>|`|RsFcilQaaa	i would stay with straight hair. a perm can damage your hait, and you can always use a straightener to create waves.

AA11247442	so that ur hair color will last longer and look better, buy a color treatment shampoo u should be able to get one at the salon ur going to or if ur not going to one pharmacies and grocery stores and walmarts carry them too... color vive maybe a good one it protects ur color n helps it look its best.. when ur roots start comin in buy a touch up kit and dye only ur roots when needed that way ur color looks great and u dont over damage ur hair by dyeing it too much!|`|AA10789135	you should use a shampoo for dry and damaged hair. or you can use one of the new products thats just come out for lightened or darkened hair (cant remember the name) and use the same brand of condtioner as the shampoo.<br>  hope this helps<br>  -mr.guy12|`|AA11127521	make sure you don't layer it too short because when you put it up it will appear very short and it's harder to tie back, I have thick and layered died hair, make sure you use a treatment 2 times a week and seal it with a conditioner to keep it healthy and shiny.<br>  Keristase treatment for thick hair is the best! Expensive but the best.|`|AA11523144	Get natural shampoo from the organic section of your local supermarket.  Get the one that is made specifically for colour or treated hair.

IElSHEadaa	I use acylisic acid soap for my acne problem.|`|W58zAH8waa	Well, thanks for asking me personally I'll help you as much as possible. You see I have acne, and no one knows it. What I do is find the PERFECT shade of cover up and rub it all over my face. Then I use a very clay like makeup, its' called make up forever professional Paris. I dab it on all the blemishs. Then I use another thin layering of cover up, again the PERFECT shade. And Ta Da, I am as good as new. You should bring the makeup with you to school, in case it wears down. When mine does, I sneak to the bath room to re aply it. The funny thing is everyone is always telling me how lucky I am because I have perfect skin! Haha! Here is a picture of the cllay like makeup.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.makeupforever.com/catalogue/concealers/5-camouflage-cream-palette-make-up/11-1/7.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.makeupforever.com/catalogue/c...</a>|`|y6HX8AfPaa	a couple weeks ago i did some research and i started using hydrogen peroxide on my face, like you would use a toner, and at first the hydrogen peroxide that i used was a really old bottle so i wasnt sure if it was still good or not, but i still saw some results. then after that bottle was gone i bought a new bottle of it and been using it 2 or 3 times a day and i can really tell a difference! it brings everything to the surface and helps kill bacteria so after a couple days of everything coming to a head i saw less and less ance<br>  if ya wanna try this just get a bottle of 3% hydrogen peroxide and wiped it on a clean face 2 or 3 times a day<br>  oh! and be careful not to get it on your eyebrows if you dont want them turning lighter! although i did put it over my eyebrows too and i like them lighter =P<br>  i hope this helps, goood luck!|`|PyjZVn28aa	dont do anything...just leave it....my sister puts all that S*it on her face for acne....it doesnt make it any better...meanwhile i never even wash my face..and i have never had any acne or anything......unless iam just lucky....just leave it alone for a while...see if it gets beter...|`|l1SVSF7zaa	sucks for you.  that $6 acne-terminator stuff from acne free works for me.|`|5Yh8WN1Oaa	I've had acne since I was young, also. I tried everything from oral antibiotics to topical creams to 3-part systems. I'm now 21 and still have acne, but it is getting better after I've been using Proactiv. I tried Proactiv years ago and it didn't work, but for some reason it is now. I have found some basic tips, though...<br>  <br>  Keep your face (or wherever the acne is) clean as much as possible, but don't over-wash it. If you irritate your skin, the acne will flare up. Proactiv make work for you. If you haven't tried it, I would definitely suggest it. For me, I have very sensitive skin, so I don't use it as often as it says, but it still works. Wash your sheets often. As you sleep, oil is seeping into the sheets and can cause more breakouts. Being on the phone a lot is another way acne care flare up. The phone keeps dirt and oil against your face. Try not to pick, scratch, rub, etc...any blemishes. And try not to touch your face often. Drink a lot of water! Your skin can clear up a lot if you're constantly drinking water. Also, keep on top of your vitamins, making sure that you're taking a multivitamin daily. And get some sun. <br>  <br>  All this should help to lessen or even prevent acne from forming.|`|1b765faa7cd93e80b10dbdec7b2240e5aa	Sorry to hear that. . .I feel your pain.  As someone who's been on accutane twice, and tried countless over the counter brands, finally found something that works.  I use this 10% alpha hydroxy lotion from acne.org at night($16 for a 6 oz  bottle that lasts forever. .you need very little to use on spots, or wherever you feel a pimple might show up).  I use a gentle cleanser. .target's deep cleanser face wash (target's version of neutrogena deep clean) works well, and use a benzoyl peroxide cream during the day.  The 10% alpha hydroxy lotion is the one thing that really helped. .it exfoliates your skin really well. .but you have to make sure to wear sunscreen, and try and avoid the sun (it increases your sun sensitivity).  Can read reviews of that and any other products you might be interested in at acne.org, drugstore.com, and makeupalley.com.|`|z3SinNuIaa	I really like the body shop's products. They can be a bit costly, but it works.<br>  <br>  Acne problem, you might want to look into their tea tree oil products. It's one of their best selling products. What it does is that it takes out the oil and dirt on your skin. And use a toner to clean out remaining impurities.<br>  <br>  After the tea tree oil, you're face is going to feel dry. Use a moisturizer! =D Depending on you skin. Dry spots or very oily, there's different types of moisturizers you can use. There the body shops' seaweed for both dry and oily skin. And there Vitamin E for really dry skin, and tea tree oil moisturizer for really oily skin.<br>  <br>  You'll probably have scars if you have had acne before, so I really suggest the tea tree oil blemish fade night lotion.<br>  <br>  All of the body shop's products don't clog pores. Their make up, moisturizer, etc. If you ever decide to use the tea tree oil face wash, make sure that you choose a moisturizer that doesn't clog pores. Or else you would have undone all of your hard work washing your face.<br>  <br>  Again, their products are sort of expensive. But it beats having to spend money on different kind of products that doesn't work as well. So start out with the tea tree oil facial wash ($12.50). If you like it, you can chose to buy their other products. If you don't like it, then forget all the things I've told you.<br>  <br>  I hope this helped. Good luck

00bece7284c0531625f560004546aa6caa	No se donde vivas y no se si puedas conseguir estos productos pero para el cuerpo te puedo recomendar una mezcla que es excelente, deberas comprar:<br>     1. Un frasco de crema Nivea reafirmante con Q10, con el mediano es suficiente.<br>     2. Una crema de Avon que se llama "Country Essentials" o algo así que tiene aceite de almendras.<br>     3. 10 Capsulas de Vitamina E. Las puedes conseguir en cualquier farmacia, solo ten cuidado de que no tengan colorantes.<br>  <br>  Mezcla eso en un frasco y aplicatelo como crema de cuerpo, es buenisimo. La crema que tendras al final sera super liquida y la piel la absorbera de inmediato, verás que a la semana la piel la tienes brillante y super hidratada (pero para nada grasosa).<br>  <br>  Para la cara te podria recomendar una de POND's que ademas es blanqueadora (te sirve para quitarte las manchitas causadas por exceso de sol, etc.). Compra la versión que es para piel normal a grasa, incluso puedes usarla durante el día antes de ponerte el maquillaje pues tiene protector solar.<br>  Lo bueno de esta crema para nosotras que tenemos la piel grasa, es que te mantiene la cara mate todo el día.<br>  <br>  Otra que tambien te mantiene la cara sin brillo es L'oreal Pure Zone, lo unico es que no tiene la propiedad de aclarar la piel pero igual es buenisima.<br>  <br>  Una sola crema para todo el cuerpo incluyendo la cara lamentablemente no te la puedo recomendar y de hecho dudo que exista pues la piel del rostro tiene necesidades especificas distintas a las demas partes del cuerpo.|`|b8f65a84d16e1617a34e65f81e69160aaa	Hola yo tengo tu tipo de piel, y te recomiendo Aquasource Non Stop de BIOTHERM, es buenisima te deja la piel super hidratada, te recomiendo tambien para el contorno de ojos que es sumamente importante yo uso Baume Contour des Yeux de Clarins, y para el cuerpo nada mejor que Nivea Q10, agregale a la crema aceite de almendras, y usalo en las noches y de ma?ana, saludos espero que te sirva|`|d6ad004e3e1fec8be867b22ddf22185caa	no te hagas bolas amiguita, usa las cremas mas económicas que encuetres en un supermercado y son lo mejor... lo demás es comercio... suerte amiguita... tú cyber médico...|`|e0e0f31ae6553c74a10bea77e238a1a4aa	Yo utilizo la crema Dove, es muy suave y no te deja grasosa la cara, ni el cuerpo.

myCyhsouaa	Same thing has happened to me; long story as well. :) If you've done it recently, there are some products that can remove it. I don't know which ones; but I'm sure you could just look it up on Google. Otherwise, you can wash your hair with dish-soap and condition with some REALLY GOOD conditioner which will strip the color out gradually, but can really damage your hair. Other wise, just use a color-stripping shampoo (And nice conditioner to be safe!) That you can pick up at beauty stores such as Sally's. Also: At some salon's they can remove the dye the best they can: Which if you're lucky; all of it! But It'll cost you. They also have color correction, where they will try to match your hair up color-wise to your old shade. Hope I helped! :)|`|8EWwTYtlaa	The only way to have your true natural color back is to grow your hair out, but I would let the roots grow out about an inch, go into the salon have your hair lightened (bleach) and colored the color of your new growth (1/2 in) and that way when your natural color does grow out it will not be so noticeable because the permanent color will mask it by blending. DO NOT attempt to lighten and recolor your hair yourself. Mostly likely any store bought color will be darker than expected or turn your hair a greenish or orange color, trust me.|`|jez0O0bXaa	No! You removed some of the pigment when you dyed it the only way is to grow it out.

Just type in the name of whatever product you're interested in, and chances are you'll find them on at least one of the sites, along with reviews, and ratings.  There are skin care products that are cheaper than proactiv. .  Probably anything will work, as long as your skin is exfoliated well.  After trying countless over the counter products, found the 10% alpha hydroxy acid lotion from acne.org (strongest lotion you can buy over the counter  $16 for 6 oz bottle) works well for me.  I use it at night, and then use a benzoyl peroxide cream during the day.

pmOnEwEuaa	what you should be asking is "is it necessary to use toner before moisturizer?"<br>  <br>  and the answer to that is no. the answer to your question is YES YES YES. toner dries your face out like crazy, especially alcohol-based ones, astringents, and even witch hazel. lots of toners also contain retexturizing ingredients such as glycolic and salicylic acid, which would cause your skin to become very dry and flaky without the compensation of a moisturizer. i really think toner is an extra unnecessary step in a skincare regime; lots of people just use it for that extra clean feeling and the satisfaction of looking at the dirt on the cotton ball afterward, but most people really don't need it, at least not as much as moisturizer.<br>  <br>  if you're avoiding moisturizer because you have oily skin, get an oil-free gel formula. clinique's dramatically different gel is perfect.|`|XYT7jvBdaa	Yes!!<br>  Toners are great to aid in keeping one's skin clean and fresh, but it tends to strip the skin of its natural oils, which we need to keep our skin from getting dehydrated.

They can insert fat into places in your face to make it appear more full. I've seen it done for people who's chin is too far in, they get a fat implant in their chin. Same for Cheeks etc.<br>  <br>  But overall, you should try to find the positive things about yourself every day. Love yourself for you, just the way you are.

kCdISEGqaa	A tattoo like that will not age well.  It's going to look like Arabic scribbles with time.  If you get it done, it needs to be large like that in order for it to stand the test of time.  I personally think it looks tacky, I know you're not asking opinions, but, I hope it makes a difference.  I am a female tattoo artist, and I always consult with my clients before doing what I would consider an extreme piece like this.  Is this something you'll still appreciate in your 30's, 40's or beyond?  Plus, what happens when you decide to have children?  Are you prepared for the damage that could do to a tattoo placed on the stomach?  Stretch marks and saggy skin can't hide behind a tattoo.  Remember, whatever your skin does, the tattoo will do with it.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Sorry, I forgot your estimate!  That would take about 3 hours, maybe a little longer to do, and most shops would charge their hourly rate for a tattoo like that.  My hourly rate is $100, some are more though.  I would consult with the chosen artist and get their thoughts.  Best wishes!|`|B4PTf6EBaa	tatoos are not attractive|`|CEEWrIqjaa	It really depends on where you go...I would say $200-250..I have a tattoo with similar script writing of one word and it cost $80.|`|NhOQ3mRxaa	it depends on where you go my opinion it should probably cost around 300-350!|`|ohyRPg1Uaa	about 100-200! that's a cute tat!

DcWan3qxaa	You can do it after a week, but your best bet is to wait at least three, simply to allow it to heal. Changing rings allows for infection and thus, shouldn't be done until it;s fulled healed, but if you must do it, wait at least the full week, sterilize the hole after the ring is out, sterilize the stud, then put it in, sterilizing the entire thing after. :3|`|zmjAccMFaa	You should wait until it is fully healed.<br>  I had my monroe switched a few days after getting it done; it was a pain, and it took it longer to heal.<br>  You could risk getting an infection or not being able to get your stud in and messing up your piercing.<br>  If you really wish to get it changed maybe go talk to a professional and get them to do it for you.  But if they won't do not try it yourself.|`|lkGmAJZGaa	I got my nose done and switched the stud as soon as I got in my car when I left the piercing shop .. If you are just using a labret ring then you should be fine.. it won't mess it up at all there is already a hole there.. just make sure you sterilize your jewelry really well.. Im talkin like alcohol and then pour boiling water over it.. and then just follow your care instructions. To me a stud is easier to heal because you can turn it a hell of alot easier :) Trust me, I had 11 piercings at one point, I know what Im talkin about :) And btw, I would use a rounded back labret ring, it won't harm your teeth.

1xwyCxdUaa	Without a parent/guardian's consent, you would have to be 18.<br>  <br>  I don't have mine pierced, but a 17 year old co-worker of mine just got his pierced about a month ago.  He said it didn't hurt and he plays with it all the time, so I guess it really doesn't hurt!<br>  <br>  It costs $45 in my area.|`|eN5xA6RKaa	you have to be 18 without parent concent. <br>  with a parent there you can be 16 and get it<br>  im not gonna reccommend it or say its bad because every person is different, but i love mine.<br>  it wasnt too painful. <br>  mine swelled up quite a bit, but i tend to swell bad with mouth piercings..some people dont swell much at all.|`|DcWan3qxaa	You have to be 18 without parent.<br>  <br>  <br>  And also if you have your tongue pierced would you recommend other to do it?<br>  If they would like it, I have a 10g tongue ring, and my boyfriend has three in his.<br>   How much pain was involved?<br>  The initial piercing felt like a pinch and that was all, it didn't hurt for me, but everyone has different levels of pain.<br>   How much did it cost you to get it done? <br>  $20. Piercings are cheaper here than most places though <br>  And how bad did it swell?<br>  It was slightly swollen for about three days after the piercing took place, but not to bad. I was able too eat and drink just fine, although I had a slight lisp. Again, this will be different for everyone.|`|TnQEOdX0aa	You always have to be 18 without a parent's consent, unless you go to an unprofessional place, which you shouldn't do.<br>  I have my tongue pierced. I got it when no one had it because it was just different, but now everyone has it. So if you don't mind that then I'd recommend it.<br>  The actual piercing of it shouldn't hurt, but afterwards for about a week or two it hurts pretty bad, being pierced through a muscle. It's hard to eat, drink, and talk for most people.<br>  Mine cost $50.<br>  It stays swolen for maybe a week, or a little longer.<br>  And you really have to take good care or it, brush your teeth and use non-alcoholic mouthwash often.
jez0O0bXaa	Actually dye removes dye, so if you have excess use a paper towel and rub the dye onto your skin and wash off.  Next time use vaseline around your hairline to protect it.  Try alcohol with cotton balls. You can ger dye remover for skin at Sally's.|`|c21f52f98718e01558380e0e7fac21cbaa	A lot of soap and water.

I worked in a Salon for a while and even the stuff they have thats supposed to take the dye off doesn't work. So I tried the ash and it works.<br>  <br>  There was even a time where they had me chainsmoking out back so they could use ash on one of the clients.<br>  <br>  Just dip your finger in a small amount of water then in the ash and start working it into your skin. It will smell awful so you'll need a shower and shampoo afterwards, but at least the dye will be gone.|`|tsKEhc5Iaa	I use a dab of shampoo or Dawn dish soap with no water...it should help but nothing will take it off completely right away. Happens to me everyday ;)
jez0O0bXaa	Either. Put a little in your hand, rub together then run through hair, use your palm and rub in circles all over head then pull pieces out randomly.|`|k7cYol3Caa	It is like a pomade but it might not be as waxy. It is for short hair so it could be for men or women. My advice would be to use a very small amount and rub it all over the palms of your hands and work it into your hair while it is still wet from washing. This stuff tends to be very thick and can get goopy if you use too much. If you find that it is too thick at times you can wet your hands before applying to kind of thin it out.|`|JbSebJJYaa	It can be for either ! It's gonna feel a little like wax but it's really good to keep your hair messy. A little goes a long way ! Be careful not to get too much because it can stay in your hair a while.

VN2wyTnFaa	Photoshop is the only thing I can think of that would be able to show you how you would look if you were tanner, but skinnier? Nothing really will because people gain and lose weight in different areas of their bodies. Some people lose the majority of their weight in their legs, some people lose the majority of their weight in their hips, or stomach, etc. The best indicator of what you'd look like if you were skinnier is the proportion you have now. If you're pear shaped now, you're likely to maintain that pear shape if you lose weight, just as a smaller version. A person who naturally has an apple shape (top heavy) isn't going to lose weight completely in their chest and get an hourglass figure. Hope that helped.|`|y6Myl0Imaa	lol um i dont think so u might as well just photoshop urself

7e87b9f7a30f59fd601be09dae6f1a30aa	It depends on why they are falling out. I had a bald spot for about a year on my left upper eye lid. Turned out I have blepharitis and I took antibiotics for a few months to help clear it up and then also do daily warm packs with a warm wet wash cloth and then massage it to get the gunk out of the oil glands and then follow with an eye lid scrub with baby shampoo diluted with water and a q-tip. <br>  <br>  I still lose more eye lashes on that left eye lid but it's filled in now and looks normal.

The only problem is that if you have sensitive teeth they will feel rather sore afterwards, especially in regards to cold or heat.

5fsraD7caa	Traditionally, your prom date should buy your boutonniere, and it should match or coordinate with your tux, which should coordinate with your date's dress. My prom date and I actually coordinated ours to my dress and had them made by the same person so that my corsage and his boutonniere matched. In many cases, it's not the flower but the decor and accents around it with which you are to be concerned. So, you can go with a white rose (tux) or white carnation (suit) with berry accents and the such. You  - and your date - should really go to a florist shop and check out some samples to see what I mean. Check out the website below. Your local florist should be able to nearly duplicate these and provide other option.<br>  OR <br>  You can choose a color for your boutonniere that stands out and makes a statement. Make it you. Make it a talking point that you and everyone else will remember and still bring up in conversation at your ten-year reunion. For this try a miniature calla lilly or an orchid.|`|jIq0G36Naa	Hard choice, but if you could get some in colour Turqoise.<br>  Other,  Yellow for fun<br>  Or maybe Traditional red rose :)<br>  Dunno, got to se the suit. sorry.|`|TSH3hI94aa	try to find a colored flower that matches the dress your date will be wearing.|`|577YwonPaa	Match it with your dates dress.

(optional:gently smudge beneath your eye)<br>  <br>  next, find another color, darker than your lid, that complements the colors you have chosen. aply lightly on the top of your lid, but not up to your eyebrow. <br>  <br>  put a white or vaniella right in the arch of your eyebrow. this makes the space between your eyes and eyebrows seem larger.<br>  <br>  eyeliner:<br>  if youre using liquid, apply as normal and slightly smdge with an eyeshaddow sponge applicator. if you are using traditional pencil liner, hold it under a hair drier for about a minute or two. then apply generously, heavier on the top lid. <br>  <br>  mascara: a coat or two will do. use eyelash curler. <br>  <br>  good luck<3|`|9425a3aa209d065574bed987b8ec73b2aa	Get someone who smokes to blow smoke in your eyes.

Use light, circular motions along the length of your lid in your crease using the brush.  If you blend away too much color, put a little bit more shadow on with a different brush then blend again.

Then I use black eyeliner to line the upper lid and the space above my lower lashes.  This really makes the eye pop.  Use 2 coats of black mascara to finish off the look.

Going dark to light is hardest on your hair.|`|TiVJrAe5aa	Hello I am Ganesh Kadam.I would like to tell how to make the hair soft. See, SHIKAKAI as we know is a very useful thing that can make your hair soft. You just have to get SHIKAKAI and tell your mom or you yourself just boil some shikakai in water for sometime.Then when you have a bath that time you you first wash your hairs with some shampoo and afterwards apply boiled shikakai on to your hairs and let it rest for atleast 5-10 minutes.Also note that shikakai when goes in eyes does not harm the eyes as it is a natural herb.But it produces itching and burning sentation when in eyes.Don't get afraid, you just have to keep your eyes closed or simply prevent shikakai from entering eyes. After 5-10 minutes after application of shikakai on hair gently wash the hair only with water. Also do not dry the head and hairs with Towel by scribling hardly or roughly. Just absorb the water in hairs by towel and let it dry naturally or you may sit under fan for quick drying. Then if you want to comb then comb gently with a comb of large and big teeths.Also your hair style should be simple.Note, do not apply oil or gel after this. You should continue this only for some days. Afterwards you should use shikakai only once a week and then decrease it to once or twice in a month. And yes after initial long usage of shikakai you may then go for applying oil when you decrease your usage to once a week and afterwards. Also please apply only a particular quantity of oil so that all hairs get equally oiled. Note the more amount of oil will make your hairs clot up and hardened up in winter , and in summer it may produce oily sweat which would spread on your forehead. Also if you use very less oil then only a particular hairs will get oiled and get softened, and, others may become rough and coarse appearing different from the oiled ones.<br>                    Also as you say your hairs stand , it means that your hairs have good strengh.You should be really happy for such god gifted hairs. I would say that never imitate anybodys hair style as  every persons hair quality differs and hence only particular hair style may prove to be the best for that person. Better try to make your own hairstyle.Anyway I should stop now or you may get angry on me.<br>             And yes regards getting Shikakai if you live in a city be careful to purchase only the shikakai that is not stuffed with chemicals and perfumes. Better try to get Shikakai from village in its natural original form. You may even get it for free from village people if you are lucky.But after all it is better give something to get something good.    -THANKUE.( Ganesh S Kadam[From URAN])|`|f6cddade40125fce64a2f30b2c054c2aaa	AHHH I HEART KURT!!  <br>  <br>  ANYWAYSSSS... <br>  <br>  hair oil will not make it soft.  use a leave-in conditioner!  um try sleek and shine leave-in conditioner from garnier fructis or, wat i use, neutrogena silk therapy leave-in cream watever it is called (sorry im too lazy to check).  <br>  <br>  well its kinda hard to lighten black hair (i have black hair and my mom forced me to dye it a few times when i was younger).  but u can try bleaching it.  <br>  <br>  it will dry out and damage ur hair though.  so it will be even rougher.  and not soft.<br>  <br>  so use the neutrogena thing every single day!<br>  <br>  oh, and it protects ur hair from the sun which is a plus so the sun won't dry out ur hair even more.  <br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!!

Don't be discouraged when using feminine products, a lot of manly men do it, they just don't admit it.

Et c'est presque devenu du duvet sur les jambes! Et puis l'épilateur c'est super économique à la longue

adB9c4AVaa	Olá querido,com certeza sempre adiministro meu interior,porque é nosso espelho para tramsmitirmos pelo lado de fora,muitas vezes somos considerados bonitos porque tramsmitimos o que temos por dentro,que é o que importa nesta vida doarmos tudo que temos de bom ca?armos lá dentro de nossas almas o precioso tesouro que é a bondade, franqueza,sinceridade,amor verdadeiro sem maldades,preconceitos de ra?a, cor,pobreza,emfim tudo que torna outros felizes e satisfeitos.Nunca me preocupei com o externo,ando bem light,sempre com batas enormes,jaquet?es,len?os,faixas,tudo muito liberal,e natural,de preferência bem atirada,mas com categoria,como wodstok.

Me acho sempre bonita, e isso se reflete nos meus gestos e modo de me vestir, assim, as pessoas acabam de me achando mais bonita também, o que n?o é a minha finalidade, porém isso acaba acontecendo.

G7dvZtAZaa	Funny thing. I though I was all about clean shaven and then I met this guy. Shaggy hair, shaggy beard, always slightly unkempt... and absolutely beautiful. He's brilliant, quirky and kind and one of my dearest friends. So I guess it depends on the guy.

Especially goatees.  Ohhh, hot!  Some men can pull off a full beard, but it has to be very well kempt and cannot overwhelm the face.  I, personally, don't like the "Mountain Man" look that I grew up seeing in Colorado.  <br>  <br>  So, keep it short, keep it neat, and you can't lose!|`|FvZQv7Euaa	Turn-off|`|xpfFTt5uaa	turn off!!!! my bff is trying to grow a goatee and i DO NOT think that it looks good at all! but if your girlfriend likes it, then keep it. if she really likes it then she probably duznt want you to shave it. but me i prefer a clean, smooth cut. i think its sexy!!
