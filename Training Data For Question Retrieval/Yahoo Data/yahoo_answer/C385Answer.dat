Rinse it thoroughly with hot water & hopefully the smell will be gone or at least subsided some.      A more natural way to freshen your air, furniture, linens, and curtains is to use essential oils.  Get a spray bottle, about the size of what you'd use to wet your hair down with, and put 10-15 drops of an essential oil of your choice into the bottle. It's safe to spray in the air, and on any fabrics in the house.|`|azrKULHSaa	simple,  on your free day open all your windows,run all ceiling fans or portable. go to your local store and buy some incense,light 2 or 3 in each room.Take your dogs and go to the park for a couple of hours.when you return, i guarantee that you will not only smell,but feeeeeel the difference.          sincerely; shadrock "|`|mh0QRDE9aa	If you can, on nice days when the sun is out, open a window in each room and let the fresh air in for 20 minutes.  Get the carpets professionally cleaned and the furniture also.  Crate train your puppy to prevent stains in one room and through out the house.  Now after all this, take a dryer sheet and attach it to the heating vents so the air blows thru the sheet.  One in each room so that the fragrance goes through out the room.  You will have to replace them every 3 - 4 days, but it is a real cheap way of making your apt. smell good.  Don't forget to bathe the dogs also.  They have body odors also.

When you vacumm, you can put that powder stuff on the floor, its not spray, its called vacumm powder.|`|vigFmfLmaa	Do a deep cleaning including having the carpets professionally steam cleaned.  Then keep the pup off of them!  I've done the whole house training thing so I know how it is but you can restrict the pup to a room with hard, easier to clean (and less smelly) floors.  Once waste gets on carpet it can soak through to the subfloor in which case you'll never fully get rid of the smell.  You can buy a special garbage disposal cleaner and it wouldn't hurt to pour a bleach solution in your bathroom sink and tub drains.  You don't have to buy cleaners that are expensive and filled with fumes.  Vinegar and baking soda are natural inexpensive products that clean and deodorize (vinegar has no smell when completely dry).  You can wash your curtains and have your furniture cleaned to remove any fabric odors.  Finally an air purifier can help eliminate airborne particles and odors.
DktmTd62aa	With kids everything seems to get stained somehow.  I ended up going out and spending about $80 at Walmart for a steam cleaner for the house that comes with the tool attachments.  We had just bought a new couch before my son was born and by the time he was 1 we had all sorts of little stains on it.  Then potty training came along and we had a few accidents on our mattress.  You can clean a mattress in like 10 mins and it'll dry by the time you go to sleep.  Just put your sheets back on and you're ready to go.  But I'd definitely invest in a cleaner if you don't already have one.  We were spending $30+ a time renting those Rug Doctors from the store, so it's worth it if you're going to use it more than once.|`|6UoTPFlvaa	If you have a biological-based stain--  like blood or other things that come out of the human body, use hydrogen peroxide.  Pour a little on the stain, soak it up with a towel, and blot.  Then use a fan to dry.|`|l8yfpyy1aa	Another lady posted a similar question just recently.  The advice she was given was to use a pet-stain remover, and run fans to help dry the mattress quickly afterward.      Other people have suggested Oxy-type stain removers.     You could write to the mattress manufacturer and ask for their recommendation.    When we've had a young grandchild sharing a bed with her mom at our house, I put a fitted mattress cover on the bed, then an old shower curtain, then another flat mattress cover for comfort, and then the fitted bottom sheet.  So far this has worked well.|`|mh0QRDE9aa	Call a restoration company,  I have seen advertisements from these type companies that do mattresses.

7lnyNHgYaa	I would try watering less often! Try researching your specific variety to see how often it should be watered.

IVe even seen people sand down the top and using it as a relaxing place to sit in there yard. It doesn't get rid of the stump, but it makes it look alot nicer...   If you really want the stump gone, i think the best way would be to try and help nature along.. you could drill holes in it and and soak it as often as possible, to help speed up the rotting process.|`|WAktMXaVaa	After you chop up / rough up the surface of the stump with an axe, pour CREOSOTE on to the stump and periodically add more.

6xyeYjkkaa	I have never had a B&S that failed to start after sitting all winter with gas in it. However if you do that with a Tecumseh you'll need a carb rebuild before it will start.

I worked at Tecumseh they shut the factory off 2 ? years ago It was a good engine . So is Briggs.  The  carburetor on the  Briggs engine was designed by an engineer that worked at  Tecumseh's in !965 ? not sure. Any way he had a design for a new type of Carburetor,Tecumseh did not want to change. So he went to  Briggs.I think this is the reason  Briggs is still up and running.  This is the reason the  Tecumseh is $100 cheaper.  It is good  but get replacements for as long as you want to keep it. I know a guy with a cast iron  Tecumseh 3 !/2 Hp engine.  I want him to sell it to me.

If your  Briggs is still running keep it|`|s2IOyj8iaa	Briggs and Stratton have been around a long long time so parts will be available and the research they have done should be very reliable. Tecumseh I have never heard of. Ok you may save $100 but is it the same old story, you get what you pay for. Try bargaining with the sales assistant to get the price lower on the Briggs and Stratton . This can be done at many stores now . They are really looking for sales.|`|DxIQJ5m2aa	Let me give you a hint.<br>  My 78 year old friend next door says "I wouldn't have a Tecumseh on my farm"<br>  He has torn down and rebuilt more than I could even think about. Tractors, front end loaders, log splitters, lawnmowers. Just about anything you can name.<br>  I also have had problems with Tecumseh. My snow blower has that engine and there is no carb. adjustment for it. One little speck of dirt and I have to take it apart and clean it out. Either way you go I would recommend using the mid grade gas. It helps to prevent moisture build up without using the fuel additive. Good luck.|`|AA10051049	I don't have any stats on either engine but have owned both.  In fact I have a Tecumseh engine on my tiller.  It has been running fine for 20 years with no work other than oil changes.  You don't run a tiller as much as a mower but it has a lot of hours on it.  I am of the mind that they both are good products.  I do like the carburetor on the Tecumseh better than the Briggs.  Briggs uses a diaphragm carb on the smaller engines and they need rebuilding every few years to keep them running right.  I can't or won't tell you what to do but for me, I would get the one that is cheaper so long as the quality and size of the mower is similar.

1f502db21c6b0eb7f380a9b93ae0ee7faa	Ignore the previous posts by idiots, Brighton is an amazing place to live, as I'm sure you are probably aware due to your family living in nearby Hove.<br>  <br>  In terms of countryside in Brighton, there isn't much, the vast majority is built-up urban areas. You may find some places near the South Downs.<br>  Lewes is a lovely area, with an amazing free firework display every year, although I hear it's even more expensive than Brighton itself.<br>  <br>  Elsewhere, you've got Coldean, Patcham and Withdean all border the Downs, and Woodingdean which is a really nice area (my old landlord lived in Woodingdean). I think Rottingdean and Saltdean are also fairly rural areas, but I can't honestly remember.<br>  <br>  Like I said, Brighton is a fantastic place to live, but you are aware it's a massively young City with a much higher than normal student percentage aren't you?<br>  <br>  If I were at a retiring age, I'd probably look into somwhere like Shoreham or Worthing, still close to Brighton but much more quiet and relaxed.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|26d79b87577280e7220582fcd21b2995aa	good for you|`|3dabeb31806ccf8d9404bcb93b8b3174aa	Brighton is a creepy place!

V14Z74Q1aa	It depends on the down payment and appreciation.  If you put money down, you can assume that you have at least that amount as equity (less any of the closing costs, etc).  If you have only owned the home for a short period of time, you are likely backwards, or have negative equity.  If your home has had time to appreciate, then you might have some equity, but not as much as you would have if you were making a principal and interest payment.|`|AA11789493	Interest only, so that means none of the money has gone toward the purchase of your home.  Paying toward the principle is one way to get equity, but that doesn't accrue very fast at the beginning of a loan, so I don't think that's a big deal.  What you need to do is determine if your home can sell for more than you paid for it.  To do that, find out what "comparable" houses in your neighborhood and surrounding neighborhoods sold for recently.  The housing market is a bit depressed right now, but I don't know where you live.  You could call your mortgage company and tell them you want a home equity line, and see what they say.|`|AA11325743	Your equity is the difference between the principal on the loan and what the house is worth. If you bought a $100000 home and took out a loan for $80000, then you have $20000 in equity (assuming the house is still worth $100000). <br>  <br>  Because you have an interest only loan, you are not growing your equity as fast. This is because you are not reducing your principal.

If not, you'll need one. <br>  <br>  Also, you'll need a good filter and a UV sterilizer. <br>  <br>  You'll want to completely drain the pond to clean it, assess the situation and amend any plumbing, add the filter & new liner (if necessary). Pull any plants out and toss what's too nasty to save and repot anything you want to keep. <br>  <br>  Once it's all done, fill it up, get the filtration running, etc., and add some goldfish as "starter" fish and add some new plants if needed.|`|pb4Dpc2daa	you need to start by draining it out (may half to rent small pump) then you go in there and take all the crap out of it and clean it up good. if there are any cracks  or holes patch them. if there is a pump to keep the water moving make sure it works if not bye a new one fill her up if she hold the water without draining then get some coy fish and enjoy. it might be a big project but it will be worth it

YPeWt3o6aa	I guess you don't live in a very sunny area.

We fight for the fig with the birds and squirrels.  It takes weeks to ripen.  They willw start turning brown.  Within days they are ready if the birds haven't gotten them.  My hubby picks every morning and then when he cames in after work.  I dry them or place them in the freezer to use in recipes instead of raisins==that is if the birds don't get them all!  Good luck!|`|xEbqX49oaa	Figs do take their time ripening.  They will begin to turn brown or purple when they are getting ripe.  I like to pick them when they just start to have little cracks in the top.  We like to eat them fresh.  We peel ours but many eat the peel and all.  <br>  Birds will get them if you don't protect them.  I bought a plastic screen like material (14' X14') from Lowes or Home Depot and have it over my tree.  So far I haven't lost any figs to birds that I can tell.  <br>  <br>  I live about 140 miles So. of Dallas.  Mine started to ripen about 2 weeks ago and I'm picking maybe a quart every other day.  The excessive rain has kept them from being as sweet as I'd like them to be and they will crack badly if left to ripen fully on the tree after a rain.
Vl4ZLrf5aa	I ran across an old folk technique a few months back and adapted it for a lamp...I do think it would look pretty awesome on an old picture frame! What's involved is gluing odds & ends to the frame ~ such as fancy buttons, thrift store jewelry, nuts & bolts, and mardi gras jewelry~the stuff you've got kicking around a junk drawer.

v3xEtuLLaa	A framing nailer shoots framing nails.  These are the heavy nails used to build the house.  Walls are nailed together with 16d (3-1/4") nails, subfloor and wall sheathing is nailed on with 8d (2-3/8") nails.  The gun itself is much larger than a finish nailer.  What you have sounds like that.  It shoots small finish nails, either 16 gauge nails or 18 gauge brads.  They are designed to shoot nails which can be easily hidden by putty.  A third type is a roofing nailer, which shoots the large headed nails that hold your shingles down.  There are also staplers which can be used to apply sheathing, or smaller gauge staplers which can be used to apply trim.  Then you have flooring nailers, which are pretty self explanatory.  Hope this helps.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.deltaportercable.com/Products/Category.aspx?catPath=4272.4601" rel="nofollow">http://www.deltaportercable.com/Products...</a>|`|8ccab7c316b95a6985a1c10403b9c80daa	A nail gun is a broad term that can include finishing nailers, framers and roofing nailers. I'm going to assume that you may have a finishing nail gun. The finishers shoot a very narrow nail that has a tiny head. It is used mainly for molding and cabinetry. A roofing nailer shoots a thick nail that has a very wide head for securing shingles and roofing paper to plywood. As other have noted a framing nailer shoots a "normal" sized nail. Meaning that the head and length is similar to what you would use to hammer into a 2x4.|`|OyLIIN7zaa	framing nailer handles longer nails and resets faster.

MmhZkTHVaa	It seems he said the compresser is shorted to ground in which case the compresser could be replaced. If this is what he said, it means the electrical wiring or windings inside the compressor have made contact with the frame of the motor causing a short.  This causes excessive current to flow causing the breaker to trip.|`|GxfyHfAbaa	Your compressor is most likely the problem. If you don't trust your tech, then get a second opinion. This is replaceable, but is pricey.|`|q3kAHuyIaa	HVAC Tech.:  Wait 24 hours with unit turned off. Have a technician from another company check it again. This can happen, and often dose.

jWGHm36Kaa	Its not hard but if youve never done it you may want to get a qualified friend to help. (TURN OFF THE BREAKER) There are only 3 wires. Black, white and a bare copper one called a ground. Connect Black to Black, White to White, and Ground to Ground. Use the plastic wires nuts like from Lowes to connect them. You will use either the yellow or orange ones depending on how thick your light fixture wire is. <br>  (You just want to be sure the wires are connected securely and wont come apart.) Tighten the wire nuts fairly tight because loose electrical connections can get hot. After you connect the wires wrap them with black electrical tape for added safety.|`|AA11429639	You can do it, but be very careful.

JvywwyWBaa	Yes, but they won't get clean in the dishwasher.  You need to scrub them with SOS or Brillo type soap pads, frequently.  Or spray them with oven cleaner, cover them with newspaper and put them in the oven over night.  Then rinse thoroughly and scrub with the soap pad.  Or just buy new ones.  I used to buy a new set every year just before Thanksgiving--that's when my inlaws visited us!  Do NOT put foil on them as it causes the burner to short out, and eventually kill your stove.|`|Vl4ZLrf5aa	I guess it depends what they are made off...I've had some that ended up getting somewhat burnished & dull looking after being run through the dishwasher. It's best just to hand wash them.|`|764VusKlaa	they are dishwasher safe, but unless they are really clean already it wont do much good. i just by new ones every few months as they are only about $15
764VusKlaa	the defrost timer is in the top of the refrigerator section. just remove the cover behind the cold control knob and it simply unplugs. i dint think that is your problem though. you can check it with a meter across terminals 3 and 4 if you know how. it sounds like its shutting off because it overheats and goes into overload?? not sure though. its not something simple like the others suggest. it may be the piston in the compressor has bent from being plugged back in after moving it without setting for 24 hours to let the oil return to it. i say if you like this fridge, call a local repair man and get an estimate or repair
bcB1pK7Faa	golfpro is likely correct.<br>  <br>  Anything made of wood or wood fiber will swell and shrink with moisture. This expansion/contraction of material can affect a door and its opening in all kinds of ways, especially if the door fits somewhat tight in the opening.|`|qNl8K6Dwaa	decrease in humidity
J4W68owgaa	The problem is you aren't getting enough of a "pull" from your venting. Try opening the dampers all the way up for a few minutes before opening the door.    Get yourself a thermometer for your vent pipe, it should read at least 200 degrees to be properly warmed to get the "pull" you want.    Also, how far does your vent extend out? Is it at least 14 inches above the flue on the stove?    Here's a helpful link for you:    http://www.woodstove.com/guidepdfs/Cures...    Hope this helps.|`|YuXklGUlaa	open the dr to the outsd a couple inches so cold air comes in and will improve the draft quite a bit,leave it open till u r done loading stove,then open the wood stove drs,, this should help..|`|LLeQyWGcaa	you should have it vented through the ceiling, i think that will solve your problem. the stove will burn more efficient also.|`|rvoo4rBjaa	Mine vents through the ceiling and I get the same problem. Just try to keep the fire back as far as you can in the stove and open the door really slow.|`|3yzpx3HSaa	Open your dampers up a few sec before you open the doors up so your fire place can vent and get some of the smoke out. If you open the doors up fast without venting it you will make a back draft bringing the smoke in the house.
Ncu1wJU4aa	They fit in the top door.  I don't think standard filters will fit. You will have to install a "hog hair" type filter that you cut to fit. A stiff retainer wire should be there to hold the filter in place or you can make one.|`|dMZdQp67aa	I believe your furnace is made by Coleman.

5ygn5Ro4aa	We were given dying plants from the local Home Depot. I don't know if this is just the local store here but you may ask at yours. The local Target store sold us the dying little pines left from Chirstmas for 40 cents and I know the nurseries will give you the dying ones for almost nothing if you ask. Make some calls in your area and I'm sure you will find some.|`|Avmolxyqaa	Ask at a smaller local retailer.

Once in while they would mark plants at very cheap prices like 10 cents for a 6pack of annuals. Often for good regular customers they would give or mark down prices for them on rare occasions. Some ppl would come to our dumpster after hours & remove plants but not really legit way of doing it.  Of course we(workers) got to take home stuff(a perk from being  paid squat)|`|vEsSIGfYaa	I used to do the same thing years ago, BUT most of the big retailers have contracts with large commercial nurseries and receive FULL  credit on all returned plants.<br>  <br>  In effect, IF they give them to anyone, then they lose money, but if returned, lose nothing.<br>  <br>  To my knowledge, NONE of the big outfits give away their failing plants.

Although I will buy starter plants locally, www.michiganbulb.com and other such websites have given me great ideas of what I will be planting this spring and the fall. I will be able to adjust this when I see what else is available locally and go from there. <br>  <br>  Go to a craft store and see what you like.<br>  <br>  If it is close to spring where you are, start taking out your summer clothes so you are ready for the warm days and know what you need to buy and the potential cost.<br>  <br>  Volunteer somewhere.|`|8JbECTi1aa	take bath sinse its cold out then watch a scary movie haha thats what i would do|`|0CQzpukxaa	Write a book, compose a song, dance, sing, learn to play an instrument, make a movie, take pictures, paint your walls, create a scrap book, paint your face like a lion, make cookies, watch a movie, decorate food. :) Haha, I hope this helps.

lLm5uIuDaa	To begin with too much furniture in too little space.  Get rid of the clutter and use the up space not the down space.  Get a laptop instead of the bulky desktop and unsightly cords.  Hang wall sconces on either side of the bed and hang a floating shelf for a nightstand.  Attach a soft padded headboard you can make yourself to wall and get some nice bedding.  A neutral carpet would be best but hardwoods even better.  It looks like a guys room so a chocolate brown color on the headboard wall would be good with a lighter tan on the others. Get some attractive artwork for those walls that you aren't using for built in shelving to get some of the stuff off the floors.  And as always de-clutter.|`|E11fB7iAaa	OK. Your room is very small, but you need to make use of what space you have:  <br>  <br>  Move the bed so the headboard is at the wall that is left of your computer space.  <br>  <br>  Push your dresser over where the bookcase is, and put the bookcase on TOP of the dresser. <br>  <br>  Instantly, you have 4 more square feet (or more) than you  had before.<br>  <br>  Looks like you have a chair to the right of the computer, push the chair under the computer desk.  It can still be pulled out if you have a guest. If it won't fit, trade someone for a smaller chair that will fit.<br>  <br>  Put all the clutter in a crate,  Get it out of the way. Paint the walls a light color, get rid of those awful drapes, put up windowshades and curtains to match the walls.  That will make your space look larger.<br>  <br>  Put some colorful art on your walls, and if you insist on sleeping in a sleeping bag, get a colorful twin-size bedspread to cover it, so your room will have a finished look.<br>  <br>  Wash your windows, dust and wax the furniture, vacuum.  You'll have a whole new lease on life!|`|U3bsMHyFaa	I would just suggest keep it SIMPLE..LESS IS BETTER.

00153b0154f2f960c55490518a8803c3aa	You say the power nozzle portion of the vac just quit working?   There are several possibilities as to why,  some of which don't even involve the P.N.   There could be a poor or nearly non-existant connection between where your electric hose plugs into the vac itself, or where it plugs into the top of the metal wands that go to the nozzle.  There could be a break in the wiring in the hose, in the handle, or most of these machines have a small red reset button that acts like a circuit breaker and pops if stressed.  You may just have to press that to reset it.   I don't think I'd just jump in and go buy a new nozzle without checking the old one out at a vac shop.

AA11988604	The pump is an electric motor and includes a fitting on the end that moves water through a disk shaped device into the filter.  If the filter housing is a separate component, is black plastic and has rounded edges and a domed top, it's probably a sand filter.  If the filter is more of a cylinder with edges on the top and bottom, then its probably a replaceable filter and not sand.

It contains citric acid and will remove stains, soap scum, lime and calcium deposits.  Another thing I use on a fairly regular basis is Lysol Mildew Remover with bleach.  Although It does an excellent job on mildew I would think any product containing similar properties would do a decent job on that constant problem.  For removal of stains, lime and calcium deposits in smaller areas you should give Lime-A Way a try.

The person who suggested that sulfur compounds in the water might be the cause is probably right.  Perhaps some of that water collects in the outlet pipe, or in the outer shell of the wash tub, below the perforated inner tub.  When it dries, some residue may be left that causes the smell.    When you said "mid-cycle" it made me think that the detergent and hot water covers up the smell at first, but the rinse water lacks those factors.  Have you tried a different detergent, such as one with baking soda as an ingredient?

It's nuts but it is the way the selling market has run forever.  Try to buy a winter coat right now.  Won't happen. But you can buy summer things without a problem.|`|3W18HDxxaa	harbor freight.com<br>   northern tool.com <br>   Menard's <br>  Lowe's <br>   home depot <br>   Wally   world <br>   any hardware store
C27LuVFAaa	If the Rubber plant is mature and woody at the bottom, no, it will not regrow leaves.  If the plant is young and supple, pruning it down could help it to force out new growth|`|a2ce1097a86fb1054145f9a23192a355aa	It sounds like the plant is pretty ugly as it is, so what do you have to lose by giving it a try?      If you don't prune it, you'll still have an ugly plant.    If you do prune it, either the plant will recover and become more full, or it will die.|`|ub5tF9OOaa	http://www.thegardenhelper.com/ficus.htm...  Try this site
ARUpETXGaa	I don't know where you live, but you can try planting it in the garden and letting it continue to grow there.  You can't just store it.  In order for bulbs to flower again, they need to have a growth period so that the bulb can be reenergized, and then they need a specific cold period.  So, either throw it away, or plant it outside and see if comes up in your garden next year.

iloSQ8lUaa	If you are giving your measurements in metric, I am gussing your 9 by 4 measurement is in meters which means 900 by 400 cm which you have 360,000 square centimeters. your tile is is 200 square centimeters simple division 360,000 divided by 200 is 1800. If my guessing is correct with metric you need 1,800 tiles.  http://www.surehandsusa.com|`|8HDQMkSBaa	sounds like one tile is bigger than your whole roof!!!|`|bWG2GhS0aa	I work on roof for a living and I don't know ****... lol
QITtHwQoaa	There are no dip switches on those openers. You use the learn button on the motor head. See page 20 of the owners manual.    Overhead Door Corp owns the Genie Co so yes the transmitters should be compatible.|`|AA11972532	Check the owners manual.  the two different controls may not be compatible|`|Y2yiyVuSaa	Did you open the garage door opener housing? If so, they should be visible on the circuit/program board.  Your remote has them inside, unless it's a digital remote. The 2 more than likely may not be compatible, if one is much older than the other.
4g0nwo5zaa	The size of the painting will depend not only on the size of your bed  and headboard but also the size of the bedroom. You don't want to put a really large painting in a small room because it will just make the room look smaller. Also it depends on whether you will have it just as stretched canvas over a wood frame or if you were planning on framing the painting itself. Not knowing the size of your room and furniture layout my best suggestion would be to look at what sizes are offered and make a replica of the size using paper or cardboard (what ever extra you might have lying around) and then hang it on the wall where you were planning on hanging the painting. This is just to give you an idea how big it will really be. try various sizes and see what you like the best. Usually people center large paintings. If you go with a smaller size you can balance it out with either another painting or other small artwork .     A good website to see how other people have decorated rooms is hgtv.com|`|dXrHoLMCaa	look thru here...    http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&rl...    I think as long as it fits inside the width of the bed and doesn't distract FROM the bed, it's a go.... there's too small, as several of those tiny pictures seem to be.... but your Branches  would be good in anything over four ft and under five, I'd think.....would be great to find it in tryptic, too!>.    http://images.google.com/images?um=1&hl=...    or a double....???....|`|uvnQBS6iaa	I would suggest making it half the size of the bed but make sure there is sufficient space above and below the print.  If possible, I would have approximately the same space above and below as you have on either side of the picture to the end of the bed.
4dd9374df6045331049807f2de428a9aaa	We used Peapod in my late pregnancy and after the baby was first born because it was too much for me to go out. It is soooo worth it. You order everything online, then people come and deliver it to your house! That's all! They charge fees for gas but it's very minimal (I think ours was $7 for a $200+ order) and it's polite to tip the delivery guys, especially if they have to walk 2 flights of stairs to get to your apartment. Try it out!|`|gWS4Cx9qaa	No|`|5d9034dca457ea37161d033c4b4a434eaa	There is a fee so check that out. They have $20 off for first time customers.    I liked it, but never got in the habit. started going to the store again...just habit.    No reason not to try them out. You will probably be happy. Keep in mind though, they don't come right over. Culd be a day or two.
PRx6j6YQaa	Green Green Green Green i chose green|`|ee33b2a393b166491be1cc514e3f4156aa	Red for a dining room because yes, it does make you hungry!  Because it is so vibrant, red stimulates eating and conversation.|`|omegLbOAaa	play around with the Sherwin Williams color visualizer to help you imagine how the colors will look together. It is the best paint visualizer on the web, imho. I like how their color palette is laid out, I like that you can search by color family & color name, the "painted" rooms look the most realistic, and it suggests coordinating color schemes. You can literally spend hours:<br>  <a href="http://www.sherwin.com/visualizer/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sherwin.com/visualizer/</a><br>  <br>  I think "enticing red" (# 6600) might be a good choice.<br>  <br>  You can take a photo of your house & upload it to the makeover gallery on this website:<br>  <a href="http://www.roomvues.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.roomvues.com/</a><br>  You can get color suggestions & for $5 they'll photoshop them onto your room so that you can get an idea of what it will look like.|`|E11fB7iAaa	Red is a color that is conducive to enjoyment of a meal.<br>  <br>  We enlarged our dining room, and when we got done, it looked as huge as a warehouse.  I painted the wall facing the living room a deep farmhouse red, white ceiling, warm cream walls.  We had wall sconces put in instead of a chandelier, so it is cozier, and we have a dimmer switch so we can set the mood with lighting.<br>  <br>  We have a huge dining room table in dark wood, travertine floor, and a persian rug under the dining room table and chairs.  The room is warm, inviting, and we have had as many as 18 people at a sit-down dinner, yet it still felt cozy and intimate.<br>  <br>  I accessorized with antiques, mirrors, plants, and a lot of that curly wood in a big pot in the corner.|`|AA10828377	I like both colors for a dining room. But since your floor is dark. I would go with the green.

The dining room is a room where you can really do a bright color, because you won't get too sick of it. IT's a room you do not spend the bulk of your time in, and can tolerate a bright color.|`|U3bsMHyFaa	IN MY OPINION DEFINITELY GREEN!!!! GOOD LUCK..
