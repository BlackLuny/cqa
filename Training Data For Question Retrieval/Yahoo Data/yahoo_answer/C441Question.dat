Nothing was leaking or running, it was just coming up from the pipes.  I emptied it out with buckets, and it was coming so fast, I could hardly keep up.  After a while, it stopped.      When the plumber got here, he said there was "too much food in the garbage disposal."  That may have been true; there are 2 other people in the house so I honestly don't know.  But my question is, how does that explain water suddenly coming UP from the pipes like that?  It doesn't make sense to me.

My Kenmore Electric Dryer Model # is 110.86873100 about 15 years old is taking a long time to dry. I have cleaned out the Lint Screen, the exhaust tube which goes from the window to the back of the drawer. I have two thermostats, 150 F and 250F and a Heater Element. Any idea which item is going bad? Note also the Heater Element seems welded to the body of the dryer because there does not seem to be visible any screws holding it in. If the Heater Element is going bad I will need advice on removing it.   Thanks for your help
20081115204126AAzArkx	Home & Garden;Other - Home & Garden	Theres a fire by or.. on my house !! (Corona Fire)?	I live in yorba linda CA and we're actually up in the mountains right now for a little weekend vacation in my dad's buddy's cabin. We left yesterday and we just now found out that there was a fire going on. Well, we found out like about 1 PM. Since we're not there we didnt have to deal with the fires and the evacuation business. But we also didnt have a chance to grab our valueables. So, we're pretty sure our house is burned because they have already announced our road that it was burning. We actually live in a condo, (a very nice one btw) and we're on the bottom floor and no one is on the top floor since they had just recently moved out. Do you think that the bottom floor could have survived? We probably cant go down tonight and check it out if there's anything left of it but we can probably check tomorrow.

I have a series 168 water conditioner system that I inherited from the previous owners.  I have the manual, but that is all.  It was not plugged in when I bought the condo and is still not plugged in because I tried to use it once and it kept re-filling itself and disolving all the salt with in days.

My wife and I are getting my 9-year-old daughter a metal futon bunk with a twin on top and a full-size futon on the bottom. We are using the same mattress that she had previously used with a boxspring in an older frame. Since there is no longer a boxspring, I'm concerned about reduced comfort for her. Will a bunkie board help? Like I said it is a metal frame and there are many slats (not just 4 or 5 like in some wooden frames). Thanks!

20090307110544AAvQrVC	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	Why is my hot water heater making a thumping noise when filling?	Are these two things possibly related?  A couple months ago our water pressure started being erratic, being regular for one second then slowing way down the next and it runs like this all the time, never goes back to normal.  (Our landlord has yet to even check this problem out.)  Now our hot water heater is making a double thumping noise when water goes into it; the water ebbs and flows into the heater as well.  The noise is an actual thump, not the usual noises it makes when heating.
20090307110624AAUR7Y0	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	A/C Blower fan stops when compressor starts?	I have a 6 year old central air unit. Last night it began a new malfunction. The air handler/blower fan operates fine and the outside unit runs fine but not at the same time. As soon as the compressor kicks in to srt blowing cold air, the air handler fan shuts off. If you raise them temp setting so the compressor kicks off, the air handler fan starts.       The drip pan is dry and the switch there is not tripped.      The compressor has a new capapcitor changed 5 months ago.      I installed a new thrmostat last night and it ran okay one time. After that it was the same old thing.       I'm thinking the problem is the control board, but that's in the attic and I haven't had a chance to look at it yet.      Anybody have any ideas?      Thanks

I have this thick canvas kind of fabric molle style vest that i bought from a mil surp store cause i thought it was cool but anyways the zipper on it is messed up and i need to fix it. Im not good with sewing or fabric or anything though. Its kinda hard to describe how its broken, but basically you know how on zippers you have to slide that little tab on one side down inside the zipper pull thing of the other? well the fabric on the tab side tore a little, so instead of sliding down into the zipper pull, it just crushes and tears more.   ill post a pic of what im talking about        http://s279.photobucket.com/albums/kk138...
