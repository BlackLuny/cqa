Everything is George Bush's fault according to him.  Look, their is blame on both sides ok.  And what bothers me most about this is that I have never heard of or witnessed a President blaming or consistently complaing that it was all of the previous Presidents fault.  I think this is very childish to do, and saying that it was someone elses fault does not make the problem go away.  I just want a solution now; it does not matter who's fault it was anymore.  Does anyone else feel the same way?

This site has a great idea. "Draft Bobby Jindal" lol. Although I know that they don't mean the same "draft" as I mean lol. That's a joke BTW.

THE FIRST IN WESTERN NATIONS.    http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news...     http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news...       And now the government are having the secret search program in which they can search people houses without giving them the warrant a-la US Patriot Acts.    http://www.smh.com.au/national/latest-po...       I've heard enough argument on people saying that this is Australia and not China etc.   But that's the whole point, do they want Australia to be like China???      If United States can be used as a measuring stick, the big brother is not someone you can trust. Under George W. Bush, US citizens for the first time in history saw themselves being policed by private mercenary group instead of their National Guard in New Orleans    http://www.thenation.com/doc/20051010/sc...    And after all, along with George W. Bush, the previous government under John Howard was the one that dragged Australian into this pointless war plus multitude of publicly owned company being sold out to private entities.   Kevin Rudd is obviously not a champion for people's right for privacy and liberty. The privatization continues on and the sell out are happening with public companies being sold to Chinese government owned corporation.      They say it's for our safety that they will censor and monitor the internet. I believe the same arguments were made by the Chinese government too. And again, US as measuring stick has shown that the government didn't shy at all in wiretapping the Quackers community (best known for their porridge) because they're anti-war, while they're known to be pacifist.   People saying only criminals need to worry. I wish it's that simple, but what to stop the police to plant evidence in one of their unsupervised secret search to a political opponent or certain anti policy group leaders to either discredit their credibility or destroy their name??      Isn't it time to contact the likes of Senator Conroy, Premier Nathan Reese and PM Kevin Rudd to stop these madness or they won't see another single day in the office after the next election time??

Hi i know this is really none of my business but yesterday i went to the supermarket and there was a sporty looking car parked at the front of the store in a disabled spot. the car was a rover mg zs i think. The car had been given a ticket on the window, obviously shouldn't of parked there i thought. When i left the supermarket i was discusted at what i saw. There was a poor old man and his wife struggling with getting their shopping in the boot of the car! They were about 85 years old and very frail. It really upset me to think that these poor people have been giving a parking ticket. It also made me very angry. They have mother and toddler spaces to make things easier for parents yet very old people cant park nearer the store? i took their number plate - sad i know - but i really would like to help them. Who can i contact to advise them that these were a genuine elderly couple? woould it be the store or the people that issue the tickets? Please no stupid answers as i will report. im sick of getting them this morning.   I really want to help these people.   Thanks.

Im 17 years old and about 3 yrs ago i met my dad for the first time.   4 months later i asked for child support, little did i know that he was paying child support for another kid already.      A year past by and he started lagging on the payments,   soon my mom took him to court and also his other baby mama   and they revoked his license.   He was a trucker so that was about the only way he could make money.   and now for a while ive been feeling bad for him and wanting to remove the child support so that they can give his license back before he gets deported since he hasnt been paying the last 3 months      so i asked my mother to remove it and she said no.   but in my opinion i really want to get rid of the support and let him live his life.   he now has 3 kids and a wife that lives with him   and i feel bad because theyre getting afeected the most because of me.

Rush likes to say controversial things, and there's a nonzero chance that this is purely so his ratings will go up and he has more influence.

If you do think that this is at all possible, does this work to unite or divide our nation?

20090306174839AAIS9Mk	Politics & Government;Politics	What do we do about the "race to the bottom"?	In a closed economy, capitalists who want to be successful have to work to advance the welfare of the society - it is in their own interest to provide good wages, make sound investments,  etc. In this sort of economy, they must do this if they want to make more profit.      However, when capital is free to "dine and dash," capitalists have no incentive to benefit society over the long run. Rather than earning more profit by innovating and investing in the country, seeking out new markets with fewer restrictions on unproductive - but profitable in the short run - enterprises. Real, sustainable productivity is thrown out the window, as the unregulated global market makes financial speculation the driver of investment and economic activity. Instead of investing in enterprises which advance knowledge and the human condition, capitalists merely seek to find the cheapest source of labor. These are only a few examples of the vast unintended consequences globalization has caused.         What do you think should be done about this? It seems to me there are really only two options:      - Restrict international flows of capital, or   - Create global institutions of government to regulate the global market.      So.... What's your take?

20090306160314AAygboF	Politics & Government;Politics	Should America follow Canada's lead in Regulating the finance industry?	I an article recently by Fareed Zakaria he makes a good point why Govt regulation is so important to the success of banks in Canada. They have the worlds most healthiest banks, bother before and after the mess we got into.      Canada has done more than survive this financial crisis. The country is positively thriving in it. Canadian banks are well capitalized and poised to take advantage of opportunities that American and European banks cannot seize. The Toronto Dominion Bank, for example, was the 15th-largest bank in North America one year ago. Now it is the fifth-largest. It hasn't grown in size; the others have all shrunk.      So what accounts for the genius of the Canadians? Common sense. Over the past 15 years, as the United States and Europe loosened regulations on their financial industries, the Canadians refused to follow suit, seeing the old rules as useful shock absorbers. Canadian banks are typically leveraged at 18 to 1—compared with U.S. banks at 26 to 1 and European banks at a frightening 61 to 1. Partly this reflects Canada's more risk-averse business culture, but it is also a product of old-fashioned rules on banking.      Should we follow suit and start to heavily regulate our banking and finance industries?

This guy has been there for 3 years, there are a lot of young children that are always running around the church, he has access to all the rooms (he has a key) and nobody that knows (except me) thinks it's something that all the parents need to be informed of. I do, I have small children. Am I making this into a big deal and shouldn't be or does someone (not me of course, but like the pastor or someone who has authority in the church) need to notify other parents and have rules on where he can go in the church and what activities he can attend (for example, he doesn't need to go to vacation Bible school)?

Now I am in my 20's and have spent the better part of my life in the public school system and also a university, I have never ever once in any of my classes seen a Teacher teach those subjects...lol! every school i have ever been to was stright to the point Reading, Writing, Math, Vocabulary, State History, U.S. History, World history, Social Studies, Health, Earth Science, Biology, Chemisty, Buisness courses, and electives like Art, Drama/speech, etc! all just the basic components of a well rounded education! we never talked about gay people, we never talked about hating america, we never talked religion outside the historical points, we never talked about Socialisim outside of the historical points, we never really talked about anything except tthe mandated curriculum needed to prepare us for the SAT's and College!       so can anyone please give me an example of how public school teachers have attempted to indoctrinate students in some strange Liberal conspiracy? last time I checked all those things they are trying to blame on public schools have nothing to do with the teachers, but from mixing socially with other students in and out of school! what most parents don't seem to get is that their Kids are more influenced by their peers than almost anyone else when it comes there personal beliefs and tolerance of differant ways of thinking! for instance when i was in High School there were openly gay kids there and none of us stright Kids had anything against them we treated them the same as anyone else! not becuase the school taught us to but becuase you atcually get to know people as people despite their race, religion, and sexuality when your outside the box some parents want their kids to live in...lol! as for the anti-american thing most kids as they learn more globally what our world is and how things came to be tend value patriotisim and loads of other so called moralities less than the previous generation, thats how society has progressed for thousands of years and always shall! it has nothing to do with their education it comes from looking around at the world for what it is and seeing what it can be to make it better!      Am I right or an I wrong on this?      Is this the reason why the Red states are less educated on average when compared to Blue states?

If they want to ban gay marriage from the churches let them, but we need to stop churches from corrupting are laws. the Declaration of Independence and Constitution have phrases like "All men are created equal" and "Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness". Why not let me have my happiness if it doesn't interfere with yours?

20090307031137AAWhKzd	Politics & Government;Other - Politics & Government	What makes people vote Republican, even against their own best interest?	The 'bottom half' of wage earners actually amounts to about 85% of Americans.   Meaning, if you divide all the money earned in a given year - 15% would earn half and the 85% remaining would earn the other half.      It's safe to say, just based on shear numbers, and how funds are distributed, that non military government spending (Social Security, Medicare, education initiatives, etc) primarily benefits that lower 85% (the bottom half).        Just to put this into perspective.....if you make under about 90k a year (about 180k for a couple), then statistically, you benefit more from government programs than you'll pay out.   It's likely that you will GET MORE than you pay out (it depends on how long you live, of course).        Yet, you hear Republican lock step supporters constantly complain about "paying for others".....when most of them benefit from the system.      This is the reason the want to 'cut spending', but can never actually do it.   When the Republican party tries.....Republican voters go into shock:      1995:  Gingrich tried to cripple Medicare, but Clinton forced them to shut down the government till a budget was passed that made no cuts to Medicare.   Americans overwhelmingly sided with Clinton during the standoff.      2005:  Bush tried to privatize Social Security, but Republicans backed away when they realized it was primarily RED STATES that would have voiced the strongest opposition.   The southern states could have actually turned blue had this gone through (based on polling).   Lets not even start on WHAT A DISASTER IT WOULD HAVE BEEN.      Finally, it has been Republican PLATFORM POLICY to dissolve the departments of Education and Labor.  The only reason they won't do it is that people will wise up to who the party really stands for (hint:  not them).      Is there anything more stupid than someone fighting to make it on a salary of 40 or 50k a year...or even less...voting Republican?      So, why do people vote Republican, even against their own best interest?

She has no family in WA and it's very expensive for her to live here. She has been the primary breadwinner so probably isn't going to get any financial help from him. Without family support, she is really struggling. She's not looking to end or curtail visitation with the dad in any way. She simply is unable to do this single mother thing without support. She's happy to fly back up to have visitation. She's happy to have him fly to her new state.      What does she need to do to be able to move out of the state with her child? Is this simply not going to happen?

20090307045810AAdPLmF	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	My 16 year old sister was raped two weeks ago, what can I do to help her?	I am 29 years old, older sister of two. I am not living at home, I live in another state from my two siblings.  Last night I found out that my young sister was raped two weeks ago by this 21 year old.  Time has past since the rape and she feels like no't one will believe her, and she just don't want to go through the trouble of talking to police and stuff like that.  It's sad because this is her second time being raped.  She was raped years ago when she was 12.  This was a different guy.  No one believed her, so she just stopped talking about it.  My goodness she has been through so much, so much.  She is so kind and have the biggest heart, she wouldn't tell a lie like that, because that is not how she is.  She told me the other night, "maybe this was suppose to happen to me if it keeps happening over and over again" She believes in God and loves everyone, she just can't understand why it happened again.  The 21 year old keeps herassing her.  Whenever she don't pick up the phone he call her on three way or something like that, he get to her indirectly through someone else.  My sister have another friend that he is trying to talk to and she is 13 years old, Come on now 13 year old.  He is 21 trying to get with these young children.  He also threaten their lives saying that he would cause harm to the family and that if they go to the police that the police will not believe them and that they will believe him.  They recorded him on the phone saying that.  I told them don't erase it but keep it, they may need it for when they report him.  I don't know how to get ride of this dude.  They can avoide him he is always there.  When the 21 year old got my sister phone number some kind of way he changed her phone number twice and reported her phone as being lost and stolen.  She called the company and they said that they could not do anything about it and that she will just have to report stolen Identinty.  THATS BULLSH!T, how can this guy come into a person life  and cause sooo much havick. I want my little sister to go to theorphy but she don't want to she keep saying that she is fine and that she will be alright.  I don't think so, that stuff can mess a person up mentally, if not now, in the long run when she gets older.  What can I do without over stepping my bondaries?  I am just an older sister, not a mother of anyone of these girls, but I fill like they are my daughters, I will do anything for them and just to see someone hurt them like that makes me angry.  I stay in GA and they live in VA, how can I report this guy because he is a Rapper because he raped my sister, Child molester because she was under age when it happened and he is pursuing other young girls, He still people Identity, He is harrassing them.  He is just running free thinking he can do what he please.  What can I do?.... What can I do?      Sorry for the misspelled words but I type too fast when I am angry about something.

Now, I'm not supposed to ship off until April 14th. What's the likelihood that I'll be able to change my MOS to 25S, 25M or 35T? Any advice? Should I try to change or stick with my MOS? With it currently I got a $25,000 bonus but I'll most likely be deployed into a combat zone.

All it said was that I was not to work, yet he told me I was to be resting until after I delivered which my employer was aware of. She called today and said that the note said I was to go back to work on March 4th. When I handed her the note it said no where on there when I was to return. I'm very upset about the whole thing and I have decided to do something about it. Now I'm just kind of at a loss on where to go from here. Do I contact the doctor and would he do something about the forgery? I'm not concerned about my job, because I've done nothing wrong and I could just as easily get a new note from him but I don't want her to get away with it. What should I do now?

Doctors group gives healthcare law flunking grade    Boston Globe January 14, 2008 06:54 AM       More than 250 Massachusetts doctors give the state's healthcare law a failing grade in an open letter released today.      Physicians for a National Health Progam, which favors a single-payer system of healthcare, contends that requiring almost all individuals to buy health insurance harms poor people, enriches insurance companies, and costs the state more than it can afford. Most but not all of the doctors who signed the letter are members of the group.      “It’s to tell people outside of Massachusetts, ‘Do something better than what we have done here,’ ” Dr. David Himmelstein, a primary care doctor at Cambridge Hospital and a member of the group, said in an interview. “The presidential candidates should be proposing something better.”        http://www.boston.com/news/health/blog/2...

Great Britain's National Health Service (NHS) was created on July 5, 1948. As with all government programs, bureaucrats underestimated initial cost projections. First-year operating costs of NHS were 52 million pounds higher than original estimates1 as Britons saturated the so-called free system.   Many decades of shortages, misery and suffering followed until 1989, when some market-based health care competition was reintroduced to the British citizens2.       Unfortunately for those requiring care, a mostly socialist health care system still has problems.

I know that there are many people abusing the system but I am focusing on this one aspect for this question because of the media and the governments latest reports on Britain having a massive amount of teenage pregnancies.      Isn't the fact that they have had all the responsibility taken off them by left wing do gooders part of the problem? They can open their legs and get a free ride off the state, no consequences.      Why should young girls (and some of them are still only girls) get to have as many babies as they can, safe in the knowledge that they will get a free council house and a shedload of benefits?      I'm not saying raising a child isn't easy, but I personally believe that having a baby is a CHOICE, and if you make that choice, you and you alone should deal with the consequences of your actions.       This welfare state has created generations of young women who see having a child as a way to get a comfortable life without having to work for it. Isn't it about time it stopped?      Bit of a controversial one, What do you all think?

20090307053013AAHTBlH	Politics & Government;Elections	COULD OBAMA DO MUCH...?	WORSE THE FIRST FEW MONTHS?      By Dr. Laurie Roth   March 6, 2009   NewsWithViews.com      The gifts of the first few months Obama has moved to nationalize banks and health care. He and his administration play word games with us by calling it partnerships instead of national takeovers. They can call it Pee Wee Herman’s financial playhouse for all I care. It’s still socialism and nationalism! Then there is the total betrayal of manipulating health care criteria and payments! We are seeing the payment criteria to Medicaid and Medicare go from “safe and effective” treatment to “cost effective” treatment. You realize that this shift puts a target right in the middle of senior’s heads and will make treatment harder and harder to get! Anything I guess to save money so we can give more bonus checks to CEOs and bankers. Then there is the glowing strength of foreign policy Recently Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has offered up 900 million to Hamas, PLO and Gaza restoration. Never mind that Hamas continues to attack Israel and says in their charter that Israel should not be a state. Never mind that our friend Israel is the one that has been horrendously attacked to this day and bodies strewn all over. We have nothing extra to help them with? Did anyone notice that our country is in a severe recession/depression? Could any of our states with their hands out to the Government use 900 million for REAL projects instead of for terrorists attacking our allies?…..just a thought. Lets see, Russia revealed a secret letter sent by Obama promising to take the defense system out of Europe that would only protect all of Europe if they would encourage Iran to stop their nuclear program. Of course, Russia revealed this letter and said to Obama we would be glad to talk with you about closing down your defense system in Europe but won’t consider talking to Iran. I would say that was an Obama, body slam. Isn’t it grand what it says about our loyalty and commitment to our allies in Europe? Here, twist in the wind some more! We are doing very good so far, we have insulted Israel, kissed up to the terrorist group Hamas, been body slammed by Ahmadinejad, insulted Great Britain, all of Europe and been faced by Russia. Not bad for only the first two months. At least Obama plans to close GITMO even though his own report and investigation demonstrated AGAIN that there was no torture and total compliance with the Geneva Convention. The detainees there get treated better than our prisoners…..so quickly, lets close it! Through the horror and realization of the socialist and communist actions of this administration, I can only hope that the conservatives will snap out of their confusion and coma in time! They must redefine their vision, laced with a real commitment, values and the guts to see it through! Life, liberty and the pursuit of Happiness has always been the core of the Republican Party until they decided that compromising and popularity contests were more important. The only line that should be crossed is when the Democrats are drawn to the conservative’s integrity, passion, values and vision. Let’s pull them across the aisle not the other way around!

20090307071712AAgZxA3	Politics & Government;Politics	Am I an evil capitalist for taking advantage of this opportunity?	A company in which I owned several thousand shares of stock was acquired by a private equity group recently.  When the offer was made the shares were less than $10 and the offer was for $14.20.  The stock gapped up to a bit north of $12 while the deal was getting worked on.  Given that I saw little risk in the deal not going through, I bought another 20,000 or so shares and made an additional profit of about $30,000.  In other words, I put my capital at risk in the expectation of making a return, but I could have lost as well.  In return for making that profit, I will pay my masters in government (federal and state) about 32% of my additional profit, or almost $10,000 in taxes.      So, does me putting my capital at risk in the hope of making more profit make me evil?

Keep in mind this person is also guilty of numerous deviant activities and criminal activities that are complicated to prove so there is NO current solid in hand proof of.      Here is the list:      1. Conspiracy to commit/solicit murder for profit {military life insurance}      2. "online marriage" or "commitment ceremony" to another {also married individual} during the course of their marriage to their spouse sponsor. {somewhat proof of this}      3. infliction of extreme emotional/mental abuse and financial strain on their American citizen partner and children.      4. intentional infliction of emotional distress on a 3rd party.      5. FORGERY   6. FRAUD  { both 5&6 pertaining to legal documents & high end purchases}      7. Manipulating circumstances to be able to place charges on an innocent party.      8. Breaking of verbal contracts that resulted in great pain,suffering and losses to an innocent 3rd party.      9. Placing their own children in harms way with no regard.      10. Manipulating the legal system to their advantage using false information {that was sworn to be true} to cause harm to innocent parties.      11. Aquired residency card & social security # without spouse sponsor present {possible imposter proxy in place}      12. Check fraud {via automatic draft} in an amount excessing at least one thousand dollars spread over in multiple transactions. This  against a dry bank account with FULL knowledge that the funds would NOT be available at that time or ANY time in the future.      Im certain there is much more, but this is an example.

She's recently divorced and has 7 kids (she's 36). Anyhow, her ex is the most abusive person one would ever meet. Last year she was able to be strong enough to divorce the monster, no matter what. She didn't want to fight for money or anything...she just wanted her sanity. She does not work (if you don't count raising 7 kids) which means she has no money and has never used a credit card in her life. They agreed he would pay $900 a month in child support (which he is barely doing now) and she could live in the house. But of course, that gives him access to continue to abuse her and use the kids as a tool to try to abuse her (like take them and not telling her when he would return). The case is very long in detail, but the bottom line is that he is abusing her and the kids verbally and emotionally and she needs someone that is dedicated in helping rare cases such as hers.

When he dropped the girls of that night my 7 year old had said she did not want to go to his house anymore I asked he why and she said just because. I told him what she had said that’s why he hit me.      Over the last few weeks the girls have told me that there dad had hit them when I had gone out or he was looking after them.   He wants to see the girls but they still don’t want to see him so we got the courts involved and cafcass still waiting to see them    Last night my 7-year-old got all upset for no reason and unexpectedly said that her dad had touched her. As soon as she said it my little girl said yes I saw him do it. I asked her when and she said after we had moved. I have called the police and are waiting for her to be interviewed.      What will cafcass recommend will he get to see them although they never want to see him again?

20090307075643AAlanTS	Politics & Government;Other - Politics & Government	What do you think about your taxes going to pay for Obama's partying?	An organization that serves as a watchdog on the U.S. government for American taxpayers has launched a campaign to uncover exactly how much tax money is being spent on parties at the Obama White House.      First he (actually our taxes) spent an estimated $170 million on his fancy inauguration.      Klayman said the reports of the partying at the White House, "with the likes of Steve Wonder and other high priced entertainment stars," will be the focus of document requests being submitted to the General Services Administration. The requests will seek to determine how much taxpayer money is being used.       "Barack and Michelle Obama have been throwing taxpayer funded parties nearly every night with their 'friends' and supporters, with Michelle Obama even exhorting them not to 'break' White House property," Klayman's announcement said.             I will include a link as soon as this posts.

After decades of moral arguments reaching biblical proportions, after long, twisted journeys to the nation's highest court and back, the death penalty may be abandoned by several states for a reason having nothing to do with right or wrong:      Money.      Turns out, it is cheaper to imprison killers for life than to execute them, according to a series of recent surveys. Tens of millions of dollars cheaper, politicians are learning, during a tumbling recession when nearly every state faces job cuts and massive deficits.

20090307074150AAqmyPO	Politics & Government;Elections	Is Obama's RADICALISM KILLING the DOW?	It's hard not to see the continued sell-off on Wall Street and the growing fear on Main Street as a product, at least in part, of the realization that our new president's policies are designed to radically re-engineer the market-based U.S. economy, not just mitigate the recession and financial crisis.   The illusion that Barack Obama will lead from the economic center has quickly come to an end. Instead of combining the best policies of past Democratic presidents -- John Kennedy on taxes, Bill Clinton on welfare reform and a balanced budget, for instance -- President Obama is returning to Jimmy Carter's higher taxes and Mr. Clinton's draconian defense drawdown.      Mr. Obama's $3.6 trillion budget blueprint, by his own admission, redefines the role of government in our economy and society. The budget more than doubles the national debt held by the public, adding more to the debt than all previous presidents -- from George Washington to George W. Bush -- combined.    http://online.wsj.com/article/SB12362996...

She also felt she was being punished for her success even calling it "un-American" and wondering why she never gets a "break."      Co-host Elisabeth Hasselbeck asked Whoopi, who admitted to voting for Hillary Clinton, if she would vote for someone who by their own admission, would raise taxes on the wealthy. Whoopi did not directly answer the question only stating "we’re getting screwed either way."

20090307074938AAGAB4Y	Politics & Government;Elections	Is Obama's gift gaffe with Gordon Brown the epitome of his naivety when it comes to being President?	The Obamas, Barack and Michelle both, pretty much diplomatically botched the recent visit of British Prime Minister Gordon Brown and his wife. Oddly enough, the U.S. Old Media seems uninterested in the story that is a hot topic in England, a story that's left many Brits a bit miffed.      As the visit of the national leader of our closest ally began, the President informed the Brits that he wouldn't be attending the joint press conference that was planned to be held once PM Brown's plane touched down. This threw the visiting delegation into a tizzy leaving them scrambling to explain the sudden change in plans to the folks back home. Still, meetings were had and things smoothed out. Eventually the visit seemed to right itself... then came the Obama's gift gaffes.   It is well understood that visiting diplomatic delegations come bearing gifts and gift giving is returned in like fashion by the host country. It is an ages old human practice in diplomacy after all. Usually the gifts are valuable, representative of the products of the nations involved, or at least symbolic of the history of those nations.      For his part, PM Brown gave two symbolic gifts and one that expressed national pride. Brown came bearing a pen holder carved from the timbers of the sister ship of that which gave the wood to create the famous "Resolute Desk," the desk that has been in America's charge since 1880. He also gave Obama the framed commission for that famous ship, the HMS Resolute. His third gift was a seven-volume biography of one of England's greatest leaders, Winston Churchill.      So, what did President Obama give the British PM? 25 movies on DVD. Yeah, that's it. Brown gives a symbolic gift like the pen holder fashioned from a famous British warship and Obama responds by sending a staffer to WalMart to pick up a few quick movies.      How thoughtful. Or not.      And I'm not the only one to scoff at this thoughtless gift. The entire British press is up in arms. Many in Britain are seeing this as entirely gauche and indicative of the low esteem in which the Obama's hold England.      Worse, no one is 100% sure that Obama was smart enough to know that DVDs made in America don't play on European DVD players. American DVDs are created in the "Region One" format while those in Europe play in "Region Two" format. A U.S. DVD just won't play on a machine made for the English market.      Not to be out done in tastelessness by her husband, Michelle got into the act, too. Mrs. Brown came bearing two outfits for the Obama girls from Topshop, one of Britain's trendiest and expensive women's wear retail outlets.      In return, Michelle apparently had a staffer run down to the White House gift shop and grab two toy Marine One helicopter models for the Brown's boys.
