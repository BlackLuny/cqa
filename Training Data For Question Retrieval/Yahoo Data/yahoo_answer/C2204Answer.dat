QBXQJ9s4aa	OK, you seem to be running a lightsworn deck, but you have too many staples in it (kuriboh, sangan). Sangan may work, but only about 3-4 cards would be usable with it, lumina/necro, and you don't even want necro in your hand. Try this list out, it's much faster and i've gotten top 8 @ regionals with it. Jenis is useful, but not really useful beyond it's healing, and it's easily destroyed, don't even bother with the druid, it's effect is good but it is so easily destroyed.<br>  <br>  Sure this list can get expensive because of the 2 JD's and 3 honests, but those are the best cards to have if you can get your hands on them.<br>  <br>  <br>  MONSTERS<br>  <br>  2x Jugdment Dragon (if 2nd possible)<br>  2x Celestia, Lightsworn Angel<br>  3xWulf ,Lightsworn Beast<br>  3xLyla, Lightsworn Sorceress<br>  1x Ehren, Lightsworn Monk<br>  1x Guardian of Order<br>  3x Lumina, Lightsworn Summoner<br>  1x Gragonith, Lightrsworn Dragon<br>  2x Jain, Lightsworn Paladin<br>  2x Garoth,Lightsworn Warrior<br>  3x Necro Gardna<br>  3x Honest<br>  2x Ryko, Lightsworn Hunter<br>  1x Krebons*<br>  <br>  I will put an asterisk (*) next to the cards you should only use if you use synchros.<br>  <br>  SPELLS<br>  <br>  3x solar recharge<br>  1x Monster Reborn<br>  1x Giant Trunade<br>  2x Monster Reincanation<br>  1x Pot of Avarice<br>  1x Heavy Storm<br>  2x Foolish Burial<br>  1x Mystical Space Typhoon<br>  1x Brain Control<br>  3x Lightwave Tuning*<br>  <br>  Traps<br>  <br>  3x Threatening Roar<br>  1x Torrential Tribute<br>  2x Beckoning Light<br>  <br>  Extra Deck<br>  <br>  2x Goyo Guardian*<br>  1x Tempest Magician*<br>  1x Black Rose Dragon*<br>  1x Red Dragon Archfiend*<br>  2x Stardust Dragon*<br>  1x Thought Ruler Archfiend*<br>  1x Gladiator Beast Gyazarus<br>  1x Gladiator Beast Heraklinos<br>  <br>  Too many traps will casue issues in your deck, too many different monsters can also cause issues.|`|RVpl9ZeIaa	Monsters: 26<br>  2 Judgment Dragon<br>  3 Celestia, Lightsworn Angel<br>  3 Wulf, Lightsworn Beast<br>  2 Garoth, Lightsworn Warrior<br>  2 Jain, Lightsworn Paladin<br>  3 Lyla, Lightsworn Sorceress<br>  1 Ehren, Lightsworn Monk<br>  3 Honest<br>  1 Sangan<br>  3 Lumina, Lightsworn Summoner<br>  1 Plaguespreder Zombie<br>  2 Ryko, Lightsworn Hunter<br>  <br>  Spells: 11<br>  3 Charge of the Light Brigade<br>  2 Solar Recharge<br>  2 Monster Reincarnation<br>  1 Foolish Burial<br>  1 Heavy Storm<br>  1 Giant Trunade<br>  1 Monster Reborn<br>  <br>  Traps: 5<br>  2 Beckoning Light<br>  2 Glorious Illusion<br>  1 The Transmigration Prophecy<br>  <br>  Total: 42 cards<br>  <br>  Extra Deck: 11<br>  1 Red Dragon Archfiend<br>  1 Colossal Fighter<br>  1 Goyo Guardian<br>  1 Thought Ruler Archfiend<br>  1 Avenging Knight Parshath<br>  1 Iron Chain Dragon<br>  1 Stardust Dragon<br>  1 Black Rose Dragon<br>  1 Doomkaiser Dragon<br>  1 Magical Android<br>  1 Chimeratech Fortress Dragon|`|NJ5ZUmw5aa	remember to add some more cards that recover cards from the graveyard. such as pot of avarice. it is not limited.|`|O24MvMPNaa	if your going to play lightsworn you should play most of the cards the best decklists have otherwise its not (really) good enough to be worth it =/ <br>  <br>  take out:<br>  1 wulf<br>  guardian of order (probably)<br>  2 gragonith<br>  jenis<br>  1 jain<br>  snipe hunter<br>  sangan<br>  kuriboh<br>  aurkus (i would recommend although i have seen a few play it)<br>  smashing ground<br>  2 lightsworn saber<br>  magical mallet<br>  pot of avarice (dont really see much of a need for it once im done =P lol)<br>  lightsworn barrier<br>  magic cylinder<br>  sakuretsu armor<br>  <br>  add in:<br>  1 judgment dragon<br>  1 celestia<br>  2 necro gardna<br>  1 plaugespreader zombie<br>  2 solar recharge<br>  2/3 charge of the light brigade (i would wait a week or 2 because its pretty expensive atm and it might get limited in the new list)<br>  2/3 beckoning light<br>  another threatening roar<br>  <br>  this is a pretty expensive list but its a pretty expensive deck lol<br>  <br>  not sure if this is enough cards but im sure you will be able to fill the rest out if its not<br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|RrWMfUj8aa	Put in more cards that inflict direct damage to your opponent every turn, because the number of cards in your deck won't last long.
SdHqyWKHaa	Always melt wax, including crayons, over low heat using a double-boiler (a homemade one works fine - put a clean coffee can inside another pan with a couple inches of water in it). Use a pair of tongs to pick the can up to pour.<br>  Strongly suggest you purchase wicks - they work SO much better, especially if you're making anything bigger than a votive - but if you don't want to do that, you can do either of two things. You can take plain cotton string, wrap one end around a skewer or toothpick, dip the string in the melted wax, remove and let it cool, and repeat a couple more times. Pour your candle and when it's starting to harden, drop the waxed wick in, leaving the skewer/toothpick resting on top of the container until the wax gets hard. The other thing you can use is birthday candles - pour your candles and wait till they're cooling off, then stick the birthday candles in (cut the bottom off if they're too long).<br>  Good luck.|`|OsCKbuYAaa	Un wrap the crayons melt them and pour them in a mold that has a wick in the middle i would think.

B3Dqk8OMaa	The hulls of inexpensive RC boats are vacuformed plastic, which becomes pliable if heat builds up inside. If you are planning on using petrol, there is an additional danger of the fumes building up and dissolving the plastic. The plastic shell is very likely to warp or deform unless you protect it from the heat and emissions of your powertrain. If you mean the wooden kits, I have seen most excellent conversions from battery to internal combustion powertrains, but they are not so cheap and require extensive assembly.
wu9lwkPhaa	If you're a thrill seeker then Cedar Point has 17 different roller coasters. Most of them are musts since they all offer different experiences. Milenium Force is an incredible mega coaster. Top Thrill Dragster is an awesome launch coaster which is only topped by Kingda Ka in Six Flags Great Adventure. Maverick is my favorite coaster there, but Meanstreak, Magnum XL200, and Raptor all are worth riding. <br>  <br>  What's also worth noting is the amount of working flat rides they have. From Max Air and Skyhawk to Chaos and their scening railroad ride, you won't be disapointed. <br>  <br>  I went there twice for 4 days each time and loved the park. There's A LOT to do there so plan accordingly. To save money the first time we bought 2 day tickets that included the water park for both days that we bought at the Meijer close to the park. Second time we bought Cedar Fair Max Passes that got us into other Cedar Fair parks for free.|`|PfE6bg5iaa	Maverick is my favorite, followed closely by Raptor and Mantis. I'm afraid of the extreme height on Millenium Force and Dragster but my fiance loves them both, especially Millenium Force.<br>  <br>  The wooden coasters are fun and are a long ride with a short wait time usually. But they are really bumpy, and your back will likely be sore afterwards!<br>  <br>  I've been to Cedar Point atleast once every summer, and the last few years we've made a weekend out of it and gone to Cedar Point one day and Soak City the next. Soak City is so much fun, so if you're planning a vacation you may want to add a day for that too!<br>  <br>  Have fun!|`|DDTiZRvzaa	OMG! I can't pick! I like Mean Streak, but any of the fast rollercoasters are good for me....I love them!|`|82f0c556b0d2ce6d669d0c2cc03b3438aa	Millenium Force, hands down. It's the best rush you'll ever get on a roller coaster. Besides the face that it's a 300 foot drop and reaches speeds over 90 mph, it's also the smoothest coaster you'll ever ride.<br>  <br>  The Maverick is similar in construction, except it's designed for crazy inversions instead of huge drops.<br>  <br>  The Raptor, Magnum, Mantis, Mean Streak, and Gemini are all classics that should also be considered.|`|8mo7QmoPaa	Top Thrill Dragster, Maverick, and Millennium Force are all absolute musts.|`|4jYg8k0Qaa	Millenium Force.|`|xN29zstYaa	Definitely the Millennium Force because it is a longer ride compared to the top thrill dragster, but it's also huge and very fast!<br>  The Top Thrill Dragster and the Maverick are both awesome too!

jPzP9Dg6aa	Well, your notation inaccuracies aside, I will address each line as shown above.<br>  <br>  I assume the 1912 pennies of George the 5th are well worn.  They would only be worth a few pence to a dealer unless they are very lightly worn (used).  The thing to check for on this date is to see if there is a small letter 'H' on the back of the coin, beside the date.  If there is an 'H', they are also worth more, unless really well worn.  They were made at the Heaton mint instead of the London mint (no letter).<br>  <br>  1961 pennies from QE2 are quite common.  Even if they are Uncirculated,  (like new), they are only worth a few pence to a dealer.  If you are allowed to melt these demonitized coins in the UK, then they would have value for their copper content.<br>  <br>  George the 6th two shillings from 1940 are 50% silver and would be at least worth their value in silver, even if well used.  Silver was removed from UK coins in 1947.<br>  <br>  George the 5th shilling from 1930 would also be 50% silver.  These would have value to dealers/collectors (along with the 2 shillings and other silver coins) and are worth more or less depending on how worn they are, but always at least worth their silver content.<br>  <br>  George the 5th half pennies from 1930 would not be worth much (a few pence) unless they were not worn or only lightly worn.<br>  <br>  George the 6th 3 pence from 1943 are Brass and quite common.  Only worth a few pence unless uncirculated.<br>  <br>  1971 QE2 half pennies were made in large quantity and are not collected by many people.  Dealers don't usually want them either.  Probably only worth their weight in copper.<br>  <br>  George the 5th 3 pence pieces are small, silver pieces.  any before 1920 are sterling, (92.5% silver) any after 1920 are 50% silver.  The 1919 coins would be sterling and would be worth at least their weight in silver.<br>  <br>  The 1917 George the 5th farthing would only be worth a few pence unless it is not worn or only lightly worn.<br>  <br>  Not sure about the New Foundland Cent.<br>  <br>  Overall, not worthless, but not worth very much.  The silver ones, depending on how many there are, are probably worth at least a few pounds total.|`|AA10283947	First of all Elizabeth the first that you refer to is in fact Her Majesty Elizabeth the Second.<br>  <br>  TRY PASSING A MAGNET OVER THE COINS, IF IT ATTRACTS THEM, THEN THEY ARE FACE VALUE  IF THEY DO NOT ATTRACT THEN THEY CAN BE SHOWN TO A DEALER WHO MAY BE INTERESTED, FAILING THAT THEY HAVE A MELT DOWN VALUE AS COPPER

Depending upon where you live, in the south or north, the only dilemma would be freezing plumbing.

I felt a bit cramped in the end, but I didn't have a problem enjoying the peace. As long as you are not holding parties that wake the neighbors or disrupt the neighborhood, go for it. I'm sure ur parents would enjoy the peace and feel safe knowing you're only a shout away. Enjoy!|`|QdZd5xl9aa	Your biggest issue will be with plumbing freezing in the winter.

AA11089860	To be truly competitive in PvP and PvE, Blacksmithing, Jewelcrafting, and Enchanting are the three best professions. Obviously, there is no way to have all three, and there is also a problem with having either BS or JC due to the lack of mining. Once you hit 80, my suggestion would be to roll a Death Knight and use them as your gatherer; get them to 70-ish ASAP and max out Mining and Herbalism, so you have both the mats you need for BS/JC and herbs for the AH.<br>  <br>  Alchemy is very unappreciated in current endgame content, but there is always a demand for it. Enchanting is easy to level when you get to be a higher level, as you can run yourself through instances for the loot you need for mats.<br>  <br>  Also take into consideration that for a PvE holy pally (or even PvP) skinning is a decent choice, as it adds to your base crit rating. BS will give you sockets and a steady influx of cash. JC will give you prismatic gems and a steady influx of cash. Mining will raise your base health (whoop-de-doo), Herbalism will give you a self-castable HoT, and Enchanting will give you a steady influx of cash, along with the oh-so-powerful ring enchants. Leatherworking will also give you the bracer enchants, and those are pretty sweet.|`|oh72PlQCaa	enchanting only costs a lot of gold if you are not willing to go find the mats yourself i would choose enchanting and mining just in case you don't want to go find the stuff mining is perfect for gold farming

5ec6e061a24d9c036d2640ab0485b48baa	Papier mache is usually made with strips of newspaper** or bits of tissue paper for finer shapes, which are dipped into a wet and sticky liquid (usually a permanent "white glue" like Elmer's GlueAll thinned down 3 or 4 to one with water, but could also be flour and water, wall paper paste, or even fabric starch).  After dipping, they're squeezed out with two fingers (or by pulling out of a plastic bag with the glue in it) to remove excess liquid. <br>  <br>  The strips are then laid over some kind of form (made from anything at all, even scrunched alum foil or paper shapes held together with tape, etc.... most things can be removed later if desired).  <br>  Usually more than two layers are used for strength.  <br>  Let dry (speed that up in front of fan or in very low-heat oven, if you want) to harden the papier mache, then paint, or glue things on, etc.<br>  <br>  **the blue "shop towels" that come on a roll can make the process go much faster if you're not making something with very fine details... they're thick but still very drapable, and will make a strong papier mache shape with fewer layers than thinner papers would (they can be found in the automotive depts of Target, etc., in automotive stores, or even these days in the grocery store next to the regular paper towels)<br>  <br>  HTH,<br>  <br>  Diane B.|`|432f9a03ef86ae8ea15283268639ddb8aa	I mix some glue and water in a bowl - you want it kind of soupy.  Then I cut strips about 2" x 8" (or whatever you need) and dip them in the bowl and start covering my form.   I've used balloons, chickenwire, duct tape... whatever you can to build your "shape", then cover with the glue-dipped strips of paper.  Once you've got an area covered, I'd let it dry for an hour or two before deciding if it needs more layers.  Once you're done you can paint it, spray stuff on it, decorate it with color paper, etc....|`|Sl0rFha6aa	You answered your own question!|`|dbLsIkwcaa	u can google it.

ACXOpir2aa	There are many changes between the two versions, but IMO there are only 3 changes that should affect your buying decision <br>  <br>  - Bigger screens. This is the most important change. Handheld screens are pretty small and any increase in size is a major bonus<br>  <br>  - Two motion sensing cameras. The spec on these cameras is pretty low, but they do a good job of turning the DS into an eye-toy<br>  <br>  - 12% slimmer. May not seem like much, but take a look at the picture in the link below for a side by side comparison. It does make a difference<br>  <br>  Whether these changes are worth the ￡149.99 UK price tag is up to you. Nintendo will continue to sell the old DS Lite alongside the DSi for some time yet at just ￡99.|`|OKWxip6Oaa	Just wait 1 month and a half and buy the DSI it has a lot more features than the original one so buy that one.|`|PQy6if0Waa	If you're surely getting one of the two, then probably DSi.<br>  <br>  Unless you like to still play a few ol' GB Advance games.

The San Deigo Zoo, my friend went there and for I think it's $900.00 you can be a zoo keeper. She said it was the most amazing thing she's ever done.  You need at least 4 days in Disney alone.<br>  Hope that helps! and just have fun, it doesn't matter if you see everything.

GrhBvUEEaa	well, i like your idea of a deck. it has a theme which is goo. but too many spell cards can hurt you. i think you need to balance it out, get some more monster cards with lower level as well as high so you can make a quick recovery if one plan fail. your deck do not seem versatile at all, but it is good for an amateur. I like the way you thin. other than that, you need some more basic cards and don't be afraid to go back to the classics. an super tricked out deck is worthless if you can't do nothing with it.|`|stHYBDfAaa	no... this will never work|`|wa3G3FCYaa	Not at all... chances of u actully pulling gran even with so many draw power is low... u will likely get beat over the head with a stick first....<br>  1. toss away 1 or 2 macro and 2 or 1 d fissure and put in banisher of light instead, this give u a monster u can use, and it also can remove stuff<br>  2.

ZMcPHP7Yaa	1) Anyone can muck their cards at any time pre-showdown, as long as it's their turn. Once they're mucked, they're gone into the pile of dead cards, and will never be shown. There is a stipulation to this, and you have to ask a tournament director on this before a game starts. Some tournaments will allow a partial show when a player folds or wins a hand with no competition, for example, turning up one card to show a top pair and mucking the second card. I've seen it in WPT where a player tried to show only one card after he won and was forced to turn up the second one because of a tournament rule. It's generally in your best interest to keep em both down when you win or lose, it keeps your playing strategy a secret.<br>  <br>  2) Depends on where you're playing. A home game, you might not have to, but it's generally accepted that when a player is called on their all-in bet, that they have to show their cards.|`|y822j5h5aa	Check the table rules first, but here is the general answer.<br>  <br>  1. He calls, you show, he can muck if he wants. The dealer cannot remove cards from the muck pile to show them. Be sure to understand how this works first, ask at the start of the game.<br>  <br>  2. Last to bet, first to show. If he called your bet, he paid for the right to see your cards.
R02vAa48aa	The last to bet is always the first to open his cards - so if you bet and he called then you open first - if you bet then he raised and you called then he opens first.<br>  <br>  If the cards have been thrown into the muck pile then they are dead cards and cannot be retreived even though you have the right to see them - tell the dealer you want to see all hands before you flip them - that way the villian has less of a chance of hiding them.|`|RfbpvqSWaa	1. Yes, you can ask to see the mucked cards but they are still live if you ask to see them (other players can also ask but the cards are not live).<br>  <br>  2. You bet, so you show first.|`|WxmNSxNGaa	I think Carol was on the right track, but I just wanted to clarify:<br>  <br>  1.) You absolutely CAN ask to see your opponent's hand in this situation, and by rule it must be shown unless the cards have already been scooped into the muck. However, it is considered poor etiquette to do this. <br>  <br>  2.) All others have been correct on this. The player who went all in must show his cards first. The player calling always gets to show last. If there are multiple callers from a single raise, the players must show their hands clockwise around the table starting with the initial raiser.|`|vOOdwjMzaa	If villain calls your hand you must show, and he may muck his cards. if he mucks his cards you can not ask the dealer to see his cards.<br>  2. if you go all in before the river card and he calls then both of you must flip your cards. if the river card is already on the table and you go all in and he calls then he can muck his cards if they are the losing cards.|`|pAqfWJ8Haa	in texas holdum ( specific to this game )  the person who calls the bet either show his hand at the same time as the person called or mucks it .   so far six answers and two top contributors and they are all wrong...run a search of rules....VERIFY IT!!!!!!!!!|`|3Iyu7hrcaa	He called your bet, he paid to see your cards, you show first.|`|Gx0B82Weaa	The first response is correct about the first question.  To properly answer your second question, if you went all in and he called you, then you show first.  Period. I don't care if it happens pre-flop or the turn.  The person who makes the all-in bet, and is called, shows first.

Especially the one about setting your tension back and changing your needle.  The  needle might be too large for the fabric you are working on.   Or you might be trying to sew a knit with a regular needle.   Adjusting the tension is the last thing you want to do.  Once you start messing with that, you can really throw the machine off.|`|432f9a03ef86ae8ea15283268639ddb8aa	Change your needle.  Always change your needle if rethreading isn't working.  A small burr or slight bend in the needle will result in a very yucky stitch on the bottom.  And set your tension back to a normal range when you change the needle :)|`|BqIG9l5maa	Check your bobbin, make sure it is threaded properly

There are 6 battle places in the battle frontier: Battle Tower, Battle Stage, Battle Factory, Battle Castle, Battle Roulette, and Battle Shops<br>  <br>  3. Yeah you can migrate pokemon from pokemon ruby, sapphire, emerald, fire red, leaf green over to the pal park in pokemon platinum. The pal park in pokemon platinum changed.<br>  <br>  4. You cant get a kyogre in pokemon platinum, you need to migrate it from the gameboy pokemon games.

97b1eabbf6a69ffaaaf71e3e35e00707aa	Im a little confused but all in all, since it is a special attack it is based on the opponent's Special Defense. In previous games, whether or not it was a Special or physical move was based only on the move type. Ex. Fighting=physical...etc. In diamond/pearl, they changed each move individually to fit how it would be in real life. I don't know if I'm answersing your question, but I hope so...:-P|`|nHJSRUxUaa	K........ first look at your Luca's skills. and look at the attack and sp.attack start... if both of them r like almost same(difference 1-20 in lv.50, 100 1-40)u dont need to do anything(accept for if u wanna EV train).but, for example if the attack is higher then  sp.attack , I guess Close combat would be better or any kind of physical move would be better.|`|w6XMunvCaa	i have a lvl 75 lucario in my diamond version and its special att stat is at max. it hits way harder if you have a high spec att  stat. hope it helps

After the sealer is dry, it makes raised lines on the bottom of the slipper which are waterproof, washable, and non-skid.

a2ba4be746681f93bc35fe00ef232558aa	Go to google, I would for you and look up the name, but the computer I am on is terrible. Type in "noob mining guide" and it should be one of the first to come up. It has all of the zones with paths highlited to follow for each type of ore, as well as when you should smelt to level.|`|yC1TCiRkaa	Get a group for deadmines (VC). Mines are abundant in there and by this point you should probably have a quest for it anyway. Just make sure you check to see if any of the rest of the group mines and take turns with them. Or see if you can get a high level to run you so all the mines are yours.|`|4er9SBgWaa	What you can mine is based on your skill.  Begin in Elwynn Forest and turn on tracking (the small circle in the top left of your map with the magnifying glass icon) to find minerals.  Search Elwynn forest for Copper Veins.  You must continue to mine and smelt until you hit about thirty I think.  If not, keep going.  After that, move into Westfall/Redridge mountains and keep mining copper but also search for tin.  Also, the Deadmines have a fair few tin veins but at level 15 you won't survive long.<br>  Other places for tin include Darkshire (south of Elwynn) Loch Modan (east of Dun Morogh {Ironforge}).<br>  Keep returning to smelt your ore into bars.  Once you reach the ability to mine silver things get a little tough because silver veins are rare, but mining tin will still allow you gain skill points in mining.  Smelting also gives skill points.<br>  After tin comes smelt bronze, which is melding copper and tin to make bronze bars.<br>  You can up your mining training in the Dwarven District of Stormwind, it's worth going back every couple of hours to check for upgrades. <br>  Also remember that even if you're a blacksmith and want your skill to rise by using your smelted bars to make armour or weapons, the Auction House can make you lots of money.  For example 20 iron bars can net you 20 gold.<br>  I made a grand on the auction house with mithril/thorium in two days.<br>  <br>   happy mining.<br>  <br>  pax.|`|5bHX51Ihaa	I'd say go to Darkshore and walk around the edges of the zone, where there's mountains and rocky outcroppings. I got a whackload of ore there, even a bunch of silver.<br>  <br>  Good luck :)

Elf/Giants are supposed to be in the next major patch. Also, G2/G3 will be free soon as will egos. In the other versions, they made everything free at the end. I think they were getting ready for this on our servers (NA) with the new purchasable items like the potions that repair your ego without risk of lowering the max durability. That way, they still make money off of people and there is still an advantage to playing the game with nx in your pocket.

yoIggBnGaa	Okay magic is very in depth  and it's much more complicated than just this color does this and that color does that but i'll break it down for you, but i'll only cover what the colors do at their best, in tournament level play standard setting in any given year.(essentially the basics of what makes colors good)<br>  White: white has many weenies (small monsters that cost 1 for a 1/1 or 2 for a 2/2) with good effects like first strike, flying and vigilance.not particularly powerful, but fast and effetive, especially when you run a lot of 2/2 first strikers.  a deck made almost entirely of those is a very good beginner strategy.  white is moderately fast at creating creature tokens and has most of the best flyers.  a beginner's favorite, but not used in competitive play is white's massive life gain effects.<br>  Blue:  Blue is an expert color. this does not mean that it is better than another color, as they are exquisitely balanced, but that in order for it to be effective, it need a good deck builder and an experienced player to be effective.  you should stay away from it for now, but when used by an experienced player, it can hold it's own.  Blue is the control color.  it has unblockable effects such as flying but cannot stand up to white's flying prowess. it has return to hand effects but red and black destroy creatures with ease. it counters spells but you have to have the card in your hand and the mana available when they play the spell you need to stop, when again black and red can take care of it easily.  it has almost no power to speak of, as most creatures are not cheap enough for their abilities and power and the big ones usually have problems making them unwanted in a deck.  the reason blue works is permission.  permission is the term we use to describe the fact that every time your opponent does anything but play a land, they go "okay?" because they know you probably have a few ways to stop it, you are just deciding if you should even bother. the main two things blue can do that other colors pale in comparison to are counter and draw.  Blue can draw like crazy.<br>  Black : Black can do almost anything the other colors can do, but it has drawbacks. it makes you lose life, discard cards, sacrifice permanents, or cost more than the spell would in it's proper color. black can also leech life from your opponent and your opponent's creatures, has very good destruction spells,brings cards back from the graveyard,makes your opponent discard, and has things cheaper than they normally would be but you lose life or sacrifice things.  Black is very versatile, but must be used with restraint.<br>  Red: red deals damage to creatures or players, and is very fast. there are more aspects to it, like some mana acceleration and artifact destruction, but that is what it is used for.  it speeds up your deck a lot and keeps your opponent's monsters in check.<br>  Green : you said green is slow, well that is just because you are new.  Green accelerates your mana like no other, gets out big creatures fast, gets out medium sized creatures for cheap, has some draw power, creates tokens like nobody's business, and has some of those spells that you can just replace the text with "if your opponent is not running blue, you win the game." and they would essentially be the same card.  oh, and effective tramplers.
7l7as0siaa	The DSi will take DS games. It's a newer gameboy, like the Gameboy Advance was upgraded to the Gameboy SP. Although the gameboy itself will change (although in the DSi the changes are more minor than they were for the Gameboy Advance to the Gameboy SP), the games it takes and plays will not.|`|HvnxG0V8aa	It will still use the ds games but no longer be able to play to GBA games, here's a vid about it <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysSKjZXWdMA" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysSKjZXWd...</a>|`|k32sOHLgaa	It might be a little long but let me explain:<br>  First of all the DSi will have different game, because IT ALREADY HAS different games. As of now these games are provided in exchange for DS points in the DSi net shop. Some of these "games" are thing like a clock, a calculator, and maps. However right now on the Japanese DSi net shop there is a Wario game that uses the 2 cameras of the DSi for playing a game similar to Wii sports (which is a proper game I believe), and games like Solitaire and Sudoku. <br>  Now that we got that resolved let us talk about DS games. The DSi can play any DS game, and just like the DS and the DS lite it doesn't have any regional restrictions for games. The only downside is that it doesn't have the GBA slot that the DS and DS lite have. This means you can play all the DS games you have on the DSi, and in time you will get exclusive DSi only games, but in exchange you cannot use it to play GBA games anymore.<br>  I hope this solves the question at hand.

M7G3MZb5aa	I once saw a book, that outlines principals of wheel timing to predict the ball landing on a particular number, the author of the book claimed to be able to do it, i don't recall the name of the book, but there is one in existence, Wish i could offer more help.<br>  <br>  Outside of that, you can buy timing computers disguised as cell phones.  You use a clicker and click when the zero passes a fret on the wheel, and then when the ball passes it, you use a total of 4 click, then it instantly spits out a prediction of the most likely place the ball will land based on the speed of the ball and the speed of the wheel.<br>  <br>  They are usually accurate to within 10 spaces.<br>  <br>  They are illegal, but only if you get caught.

This technique takes a TREMENDOUS amount of skill, and an even more tremendous amount of practice.

They then bet all the numbers in that section. <br>  (and even THEN, it's still not 100%)<br>  <br>  I've actually seen this in action. It really IS truly amazing.

0mT4Rinraa	Despite what people say, you can get a very good gaming rig for quite cheap (under $700 if you're smart). You'll want to invest the most in the processor (Core2Duo 5.3 is good, or you could go for the more expensive Quad Core or corei7), video card (NVIDIA; the 8800GT costs about $100 and can play games like Crysis, Gears of War, and Bioshock on very high), and get a lot of RAM (4GB is good, and RAM isn't all that expensive. Get it in 2GB modules, not individual ones). You can save yourself a whole lot of money by getting a CRT monitor (it takes up more space, but it looks just as good as an LCD). Make sure you get a big case and a lot of fans so that you don't go overheating.<br>  <br>  My current rig cost me $550 (without the video card):<br>  Core2Duo E7200 (2.53GHz)<br>  2GB DDRII RAM<br>  250GB HDD<br>  17 inch Dell CRT monitor<br>  Alien case<br>  4 fans<br>  NVIDIA 8800GT<br>  <br>  There isn't a game out there I can't run.<br>  Edit: Oh, and avoid Vista at all costs. Not only will it slow you down, but it's not compatible with a lot of games. Stick with XP and you're performance will go up at least 50% (I did the test)

Sims On-line was taken down in August 2008.|`|kDKiJfaraa	I don't believe u can but you can look it up on google or some search engine and u can probably get it on sale somewhere because the sims 3 is coming.|`|PpheQM2naa	Im sorry to tell you but that is impossible, not only would it be possible just to find the sims 2 online but it would also be incredibly hard to find it without getting a whole bunch of viruses,<br>  <br>  If your really hurting for the sims 2 you could buy the original for aroun 19 bucks, and if you look hard on ebay it would be much cheaper,<br>  <br>  The sims 2 is just to big to play it from a browser.<br>  <br>  Hope that helped

a2ba4be746681f93bc35fe00ef232558aa	It is fairl simple. The number one thing to do though is pick up your professions early on. At 60 I picked up mining and Skinning and leveled them in the old world up to the outland content(sold Old World mats on AH for a bunch), then lvled both respectively as I got to 80...ended up having enough money to buy my epic flyer and all trainings at 80. But, go blood for lvling, you should never die, and no down time. Best way to lvl is by far questing unless you are full rested xp.|`|a8b8a2e2715f7a46743d76f2a69e1019aa	Very simple. My only suggestion is spec'ing Blood while leveling. This is because you will have many ways to heal yourself while doing mass amounts of damage for a character not yet level 80. As blood, I got my DK to 80 with 1 death, and took me about 3 1/2 weeks, about a level a day. <br>  <br>  GL getting your DK to 80! They are great fun!
DU8zxsKRaa	If you mean to store the BlueRay ISO so you can play the game without the disk, you cannot without voiding warranty or possibly breaking laws.<br>  <br>  Concidering the maximum storage capacity of a BR disk is 25 gigs, not sure if you'd want to store those images in the game's hard drive unless you've really beefed it up.|`|xPy6ZePkaa	There is no legal way to do this. The only games that can be saved to your hard drive is the games that are available on the PS Store. You can also get a mod chip that will store games on your 2nd hard drive your that your probably didn't know you had. But once there is a system update it will be detected.|`|y5DAfNtHaa	If you want to officially play downloadable game, you must download at PlayStation?

E8ayRTBPaa	If your talking about the bronze-colored Liberty bell<br>  with no value on it but it has "FOREVER" inscribed<br>  on the stamp, then this stamp is still good for first-<br>  class postage for any place within the United States.<br>  The current rate is 42 cents to mail a letter, but get<br>  this - when rates go up to 44 cents in May, those<br>  stamps will still be good and you won't need to add<br>  any extra postage. That's what the forever means on<br>  the stamp, good forever for first class postage.|`|csfOc9rzaa	The previous answer about Forever stamps is correct, but the more general answer is: look at the site given below in sources.  It shows pictures of all the U.S. stamps that have been issued without an amount printed on them, and what their value actually is.

6GIrW5eWaa	short answer is no, and they are two different games developed by two different companies. They are not compatible. <br>  <br>  Removing opinions as best I can. Guitar Hero has always been and probably always will be geared toward the hard core guitar gamers as it is more difficult on expert mode. <br>  <br>  Rock Band was developed for a more family level and is easier to play solo and as a band. <br>  <br>  I'm sure there is opinion there but we have both games, Rock Band certainly has more DLC but it has also been out a year longer than GHWT. <br>  <br>  good luck|`|uiUYzHAaaa	No you can't...its a different game...the difference is that Guitar hero is way better than Rock Band so get guitar hero|`|TLgyahshaa	the guitar and drums from rock band can be used on world tour if that's what u are asking. and from i know world tour drums and guitar can be used on rock band. i'm not sure on that one but i have rock band drums and they work fine on world tour. i think rock band is better because of the song list. so many more songs available to u. from rock band 1 and 2 plus Downloadable content.|`|4oEuCkjPaa	yes as long as you can use the guitar gears of war

I dont't like games where you have to control characters such as the Sims and Command And Conquer. I prefer more 'in the action' games such as CoD WaW and Halo 3.

It will be better. So id go buy it.|`|5frOVAgSaa	halo fanboys would be eager to get their hands on this one, no matter how dreadful the game is.|`|RjGtp41Zaa	Waste? No. I am gonna buy Halo Wars but it isn't a waste. Just cuz it is not an FPS doesn't mean that it is a fail. I am a BIG Halo fan and I don't have the problem with the switch. And besides, It is only for this one game. I think that HW is a cool way to show the beginning to the Human-Covenant wars (I read the books but HW is gonna be a better way to show it). HW may not be ur style but u should at least give it a chance!|`|kFZOhuB8aa	Personally i dont like Halo games.

757c91a5e3a9215007b5dd0c6436e097aa	When you are in the building with Big Smoke shooting  your enemies, just crouch using the r3 button and shoot at the same time to avoid getting hit by any bullet. I assume this may not be the problem so it must be shooting while on the bike. First of all, you should be really good at aiming enemies while they are in a car or on a bike to successfully complete the mission. It's good to aim at the car engine using your Uzi sub machine (this is the best weapon), as it is the quickest way to get a car to blow up immediately. Or just shoot it until it swerves. For the ones on the bike, try to aim at their head or directly at the bike, it is easier to blow up quicker than the car.<br>  <br>  Here is a video to Just Business:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaIcV35uCwI" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaIcV35uC...</a>|`|6Jh27EOUaa	if you go to gamesfaq.com they tell you everything u need to know

But it will only work with quite large amounts, and sometimes it doesn't even work then.  It's luck I think, you will probably grow a money tree around 50% of the time but you always get back more than you plant.|`|NmzWCCdLaa	Yes it does!<br>  When you bury a money bag with the golden shovel a tree will grow in that spot. (it has more chance of surviving if it is more money)<br>  <br>  I think thats all you can do with the golden shovel.|`|hXQuvMMvaa	Yes it does.

This fact may owe itself to the lengthy development time for a European version - Nintendo has to localize it for English, Spanish, German, French, and other languages, which is harder in this case with all of the voice acting. But don't you worry, it may come out regardless, as Professor Layton had a recent sales boost, which will force Nintendo to take notice hopefully.|`|qbmkMWqeaa	Professor Layton and The Devil's Box was released in Japan in 2007 but hasn't been released in the US yet...there is no info I can find on release dates for either the US or UK...|`|L05qzn1eaa	There are no confirmed dates to release the sequel here in the UK although the fact it is mentioned in the first game is a definite indicator that it is in the pipeline.<br>  <br>  The sequel is already out in Japan and is called Professor Layton And The Devils Box or Professor Layton And Pandoras Box depending on who is translating. Bearing in mind that the original game came out in February 2007in Japan we might be waiting a while. Keep an eye out on the DS release pages over at europeangamereleasedates.com

Sometimes it's a SVG (save game file), sometimes it's a directory with info, etc; it's hard to say exactly what or where it'll be, but usually it's pretty obvious once you've found it.<br>  <br>  Once you've found it/them, move it to a different directory and then uninstall.  Most uninstallers have a list of files to remove so any other modified/added files(like saved games) won't be removed anyway, but this will help make sure they're not deleted.<br>  <br>  <br>  (If you're referring to a console version, game saves are usually in a different place and won't be deleted by uinstalling the game from the hard drive.)|`|OK9SqlPbaa	if you delete it the data will be deleted too|`|8b60Ntacaa	im more of a fps shooter that enjoy games such as crysis but normally PC games saved files are saved in my documents, also if its not there sometimes when you go to uninstall it it could say would you like too keep saved game data, click yes and you should be ok|`|5nwOZLgqaa	well i beleive you can uninstall it but you will probably lose your game saves and stuff everything except for the trophys (ps3)or achevments (360)|`|pDtoi6FUaa	you can uninstall it. i need you as a contact to give you more detail. do you have a xbox 360?

vlwkfkCDaa	From your words i gather you're running a low-level group. Consider this : <br>  <br>  1- Is he disruptive with the other players ? Is he just trying to make fun out of the game ? How do the other players react to this ? Do they like his attitude ? Do they support him ?<br>  <br>  Then your group should be allowed to slide to the evil side on their own, switch your adventure to the "other side", they're now the bad guys, and have to face the consequences, all of them, as a group. <br>  <br>  Your role here is the represent the world and its rules, but also to allow some leeway in the adventure style. Characters can (and will) change alignment, lose powers/levels, but it's their choice. Anyone who condones the kind of acts you suggest is guilty by association.<br>  <br>  2- Is he trying to make a fool out of you ? Ruining the game ? The other players don't like his attitude ? They complain about it ?<br>  <br>  Don't take this personally (very important), no revenge here, but first of, his character is going to get killed (see the other answers for reasons and means to do this, or simply let the other characters abandon him or kill him)<br>  <br>  Then, simply, don't invite him to your next game, this is meant to be played among friends, and this introduces a very important notion to your game. <br>  <br>  You're all here to have a good time, even you, and playing the game necessitates a good dose of what is called "suspension of disbelief" ie : you have to believe in the game-world, even if it's illogical, so your role as a DM is maintaining a happy atmosphere at the table, and following the players even if they don't go your way, while maintaining the world as YOU see it.<br>  <br>  I've seen adventures turn gonzo because a player was disruptive, and sometimes, the game turns to a cartoon style, non-stop laughing thingamajig. Okay, everyone had fun, i'm a bit frustrated because i couldn't set the mood (no big deal, will do another time), but overall we all had fun.<br>  <br>  I've also seen adventures starting with "oh, no, not him" and everyone making faces because the party-disrupter ruined it for everyone. Needless to say, the guy is history. the hardest part was being honest and telling him : "No, you don't play with us no more, because no-one has fun when you're at the table"<br>  <br>  Your best chance is talking to the other players, and getting their feeling about it. But again, never feel guilty for killing a character in game if he deserved it, after all, it's just a sheet of paper. What do you think happens in MMORPG's ?|`|wkMncMobaa	Just blow EVIL cigarette smoke in his face.  Be sure to wipe the sand out of your VJ too.|`|41256fe5fac2566bc1eaa04da1051f4eaa	Yes, your player is being a douche. Chances are, he's new to the game, and probably has a history of playing electronic RPGs, where NPCs cannot be attacked, or the act has no ill consequences. <br>  <br>  Your best bet is to show the PLAYER that the actions of his CHARACTER have consequences to the character, and inversely, its player. <br>  <br>  Have a huge squad of city guards decide to lynch the character. If the other players try to defend the bad character, make it clear that this means they must be his accomplices, and therefore deserve the same treatment he is about to receive. If they persist, kill them all.<br>  <br>  Use mob rules from the DMG2, page 59, paraphrased here:<br>  <br>  Mob:<br>  Garganutan Creature comprised of about 48 small/medium creatures (or 12 large creatures)<br>  HD: 30d8 (160 hp)<br>  Init: +0<br>  Speed: -10 ft. from base creature<br>  AC: -4 from base creature<br>  BAB: fey or undead +15; aberration, animal, construct, elemental, giant, humanoid, ooze, plant, or vermin +22; dragon, magical beast, monstrous humanoid, or outsider, +30 <br>  Grapple: +12 from base creature<br>  Attack/Full Attack: deals 5d6 Bludgeoning to any creature engulfed at end of its move<br>  Space/Reach: 20ft/0ft.<br>  Special Attacks: Expert Grappler (can grapple others while holding a grappled opponent, never flatfooted while grappling) OR Trample (does not end movement in same square as target, deals 2d6 + 1.5x base creature strength modifier.

However, the big question to ask is:  is everyone else having fun?  If they are, read no further and get ready for an "outlaw" game.  <br>  <br>  First, how are your other players reacting?  If they're not having fun, you all need to sit down, instead of gaming, and talk to this player.  If he's not a total douche, he'll listen.  <br>  <br>  Second, if your players are ok with playing this out, start with taking away his paladin abilities.  A DM provides natural consequences.  As such, it's very reasonable his name becomes equated with a murderer most foul.  It's not the type of campaign I envision running (nor my players playing), but that's my group, and yours may be different.  Further, would the rest of your party hang out and adventure with him?<br>  <br>  Third, if he won't listen and you want to play this out (perhaps this is just an immature phase that he needs to get through his system), then I think you're justified in sending out the law.  Just be fair.  If somehow he fights his way out, then let the dice roll where they may.  Your own players will cry foul if you just arbitrarily declare the law got him, but give them (him) a fighting chance, and no one can say you didn't do your job.<br>  <br>  Fourth, if you get to the point of a hanging, etc., play it up.  Have victims come testify, family members, kids.  If your player doesn't see the light after little Tommy Bobber cries because this ex-paladin took his dad, who used to take him fishing on his days off, and killed him, then you've got a cold-hearted bastard on your hands, and you may want to cut him loose.

5HGnyWwYaa	The biggest secret about D&D 4th edition is that EVERYONE is a new DM when it comes to the game ... mainly because its new!  Your gaming with friends and family, so just let them know that your all learning together.  Also, dont turn anyone away!  I usually run with a DM and 5 players, and have ran games with upwards of 8 players.  best thing to do is set a co-DM!  Since you're all starting fresh with 4E, have one of the players assigned to help look up rules.<br>  <br>  You also asked How do I DM and play at the same time?<br>  I got a few suggestions;<br>  1. Change your DM outlook. As a DM you are still a "player", but your characters are all the monsters and NPCs.  You will get to rotate between a cast of dozens in a single game session.  Why be limited with 1 character when you can DM!<br>  2. Round Robin!  You DM for a week with the agreement that one of your players picks up DMing the next game! Even if its just a partial game, you still get to roll a character and jump in for a session every now and then.|`|OZ0DgzrJaa	Well, running a module makes life a lot easier.  You won't have to necessarily come up with what is going on by yourself.  You are a player too though, it is you VS the players!  <br>  <br>  Incidentally, keep was designed for 5 players.  And while 4 can do it (as my group did) you have to be a little careful about team balance.  My DM let us design our own characters instead of taking the premade ones, and he ended up having to change one of the treasures from Scale to Leather because we didn't have the same number of scale armor users!<br>  <br>  Here is some advice for you though.<br>  1.  Have a general handle on the rules.  You are the final arbitrator when it comes to how the rules play out.  For Keep you won't need to arbitrate much, but there will be times where you will have to make a call.<br>  2.  Don't be a sticlker for the rules and senerio.  Sometimes players do odd things.  And sometimes you have to tell them no, but sometimes it's fun to let them try and see what happens.<br>  3.  Remember that you can 'fudge' dice.  This should only be done to make the game more fun. <br>  4.  Keep everyone involved.  This is easier in 4th than previous editions, since all the classes are combat capable and healers don't have to waste whole turns keeping their allies alice.<br>  5.  Have fun.|`|ciG5yrgFaa	my advice, as a player that started back in AD&D over 10 years ago, do not DM on your first try!!!<br>  <br>  i've been playing for a while and still don't feel i know the rules well enough to DM.  play in a group that's already started and has a DM to get the hang of the play.  it is totally different than playing an online/video game.  <br>  <br>  if you go to wizards.com they have the d&d community boards, they have a game locator section on there where people post groups looking for players, some are DMs looking for a group.  try there first.  <br>  <br>  as for DMing and playing, your best bet is to go with an NPC, but you don't want to make it the party leader.  reason being, you know the story and can technically "lead" the other players just fine, but the fun is in the players figuring things out.  the NPC is there usually to give aid to the group, but not to help solve the puzzles or anything major like that.  <br>  <br>  good luck, hope i helped without discouraging you.  i've tried to DM and failed horribly, it lasted one session.  get used to the game and the mechanics and you'll be able to DM in no time!

A large room full of dragons eggs that hatch when anyone gets too close. Though the hatchlings arnt elite, they were lvl 60, the lvl cap at that time. While inensly planning thier move, Leeroy who was AFK getting food, jumped up and charged in with the now equaly famous battle cry "Lets do this!" The etrire party (10+) went to saved him and were wiped (the whole group was killed) The last words herd were Leeroys: "At least I got chicken" as this was the food he had been eating.<br>  It was later revealed the vidio was scripted, but the vidio (on youtube) remained a favorite.<br>  When Blizz intoduced the  World of Warcraft Trading Card Game, Leeroy was made a card, and Upper Deck has mae plans to make a figurine of the hero as well.<br>  <br>  Players can now earn the tile 'Jenkins' via the achivement 'Leeeeeeeeroy!'

DtkLsetkaa	They have to be insanely mad at one another.  Quickest way to do this is to have one of them cheat in front of the other, and don't make any moves to fix it.

kHRK66Mwaa	The easiest Super and Ultra moves are probably Ken and Ryu. So select one of them first. <br>  <br>  Go to the training mode stage, pause and hit options. For the power levels, shift it to 'constant' so that your super power bar never goes down. This will make it easier for you to practice.<br>  <br>  Basically, when someone attacks you, your "revenge meter" increases. Once it gets to a certain point, you reach Ultra. To pull of this move for Ryu, quickly pull a quarter circle twice ( middle, down and to the right x 2) and hit the button that is equivalent to all 3 punches. Use the D-pad in the beginning as it is easier. The stick gives you more control but is more for advanced players. As for the Super move, it is the same thing but it is the other blue meter.<br>  <br>  In the beginning when I played street fighter 2 many years ago, I could not get the special moves to work either. It just takes practice and patience. With persistence and alot of playing time, you will get it.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|z8hFBz15aa	look on youtube or somewhere where it shows step-by-step how to do it

4d39e7dd6b413fbd46444cffe2149c0baa	This answer is made with an assumption that you tried consulting walkthroughs but got bored in the process hehe. Okay just one question first? How'd you get to Adel at level 35? I was at level 45 and i avoided the random battles as much as possible. <br>  <br>  Anyways. You need to upgrade your equipment and your GFs (hope you have tonberry(?) for the call shop function).  Also, i think you have have all your spells scattered. just select the best 3 people in your party equip them with the spells. If adel calls up someone with no spell equipped, just kill that character so you move to the next one. Junction spells to HP and you have at least some chance. And always have Squall and/or Zell be at their critical HP so you get to use limit breaks. Adel has this attack that send everyone's HP down to 1 (which i think makes you curse a lot when used) so doesn't make a lot of sense to keep everyone's HP full. And besides, it wastes turns.<br>  <br>  BTW FF8 is my most favorite of the series even though FF7 is more superior in gameplay and story.

They are a creative medium just like films or books and parents should realise this.  The problem is that a lot of parents think that games are just for kids.  They are not.  Games have ratings of 16+ or 18+ if they have violent content and people should respect those, it's not fair to 'ban' responsible adults from playing the games they like - that's like banning horror movies!<br>  <br>  Society can't blame its problems with youth on violent computer games.  I played violent games when I was a kid as did many of my friends and I turned out fine.  Everyone without some sort of mental problem knows there is a difference between what you can do in a game and what you should do in real life, whatever their age!  People should stop blaming video games and start looking at the real causes of violent crime, which usually stems from family/ peer problems.<br>  <br>  Oh, and you should start doing your own homework and not relying on google and yahoo answers =P|`|BeElA5Vpaa	You know they say the best way to know something is for someone to teach you. What I mean is if we are exposed to violent video game it desensitizes our senses when we see violence. Benefit of that is that we are less likely to be ignorant/naive/traumatized when we experience violence. Honestly society today is more violent than ever, it's more better for kids to be taught how to handle violence correctly than try to hide them in the closet for the rest of their life.<br>  <br>  Also if video game should be banned, shouldn't movies, music and television be banned as well?|`|8b60Ntacaa	so really since you need too know the bad things instead of the pro's if you want too band video games that are violent, pros are adreneline rush, get rid of some steam, a bit of fun(games like GTA 4 are alot of fun when you do violent things)<br>  <br>  cons:<br>  you could start doing the actions you see form the game<br>  addiction<br>  not enough exercise, not going out, not socializing<br>  ignore people around you, become aggressive, stay up late on a school night, affect your learning if a child, didnt know if you wanted too know cons or pros because your title is different to your description so i listed both of them|`|vtqBWv7Daa	its a good way to express yourself.<br>  a harm-free way to relief anger - its better then hitting on other people.<br>  its fun

8ebcf16d5c4bb86d139780748d9e79e2aa	I use the same strategy to beat every level I've played so far and it seems to be working great. So try this:  Charge only a small amount for entrance to the park, like 1 or 2 dollars, but charge higher prices for the food and rides themselves. After all for the fair you want quantity not really quality. In fact I hardly ever even upgrade any of my rides, and do almost no advertising. Make the people happy by letting them in cheap, then once they get in charge them tons of cash like 5 or 6 dollars per ride. Generally I raise the price on everything by at least 2 dollars. if a funnel cake is 2.50 I raise it to 4.50, ect... Also give good prizes on the games stall but charge more for them to play. Also, don't build everything you can build and waste a lot of money, try to only build a few things to keep them entertained plus the items the game wants you to build for that level. Mostly I build game stalls and only a few rides. Something else I've noticed even though I don't really advertise but while playing around with it, is that if you crank all your advertising up to max it seems to draw more people, but you don't want to pay that much right? So right before the next quarter starts lower your advertising to zero and it wont charge you. At least this has worked in my version I hope this helps!

3Iyu7hrcaa	You are right at first.  5 card hand, you both have 7-8-9-10-J, and you split the pot, there is no sixth card.  The extra K or A doesn't matter.<br>  <br>  But if the opponent had J-Q, then he has 8-9-10-J-Q, and would win.  8-9-10-J-Q is better than your 7-8-9-10-J.  It's a higher straight.<br>  <br>  Yes, 10-J-Q-K-A is the highest straight|`|y822j5h5aa	At showdown in Texas Holdem Poker, you make the best hand possible with ONLY 5 cards. No other cards count, and the cards speak for themselves. <br>  <br>  In your first example, you split the pot, you are both winners with a straight of 7 8 9 10 and the J. In this case you both used one of your hole cards to make the straight. <br>  <br>  In your second example, you both have a the same straight, but your opponent used his second hole card, the Q, to make a higher straight and win the hand. <br>  <br>  Good luck at the tables.|`|qlh1lz4Qaa	The sixth card doesnt matter. You have a split pot with equal straights from 7-J.
