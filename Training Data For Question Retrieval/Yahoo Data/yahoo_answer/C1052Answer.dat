He has only lost once in his career when leading after 54 holes.|`|sBrummATaa	he wouldnt be a good one on one leader. ive seen him work with people from videos and he is an awful instructor.|`|mFa5ZDtcaa	He's a golfer. <br>  <br>  If he has a better score than the other golfers in a tournament, then he would be the leader.|`|W2R8TRDmaa	This depends on what you mean by 'leader'.  He has been perfect with the media, family, charities, etc, etc.  So he has been an ideal role model.  He has never been involved with anything controversial ethically or lawfully.  As a captain of a team, he probably would not be a great leader at this point in his life.|`|T8fldPKmaa	Hes not a good leader, he thinks hes too much for everyone. Good golfer, but thats it.|`|A1ohtlWsaa	he will be a good ryder cup captain in the future and a good leader on alot of thr golfing records too.|`|B88hLODDaa	No, Tiger Woods is not a good leader. In the chances he's had to be a leader such as the ryder cup hes failed miserably. Best golf ever...yes, leader...no

Hawks is the real threath so is the Magic. Hawks is a wildcard.<br>  <br>  but the east will be Cavs vs Celts in a rematch and an interesting match-up.|`|1AzCDrO6aa	not in a 7 game series. atlanta have the best chance of beating them in the playoff. also chicago is playing better after the trade but I dont see them beating the top two this year , maybe next year.|`|gvWLgYx4aa	Once Lebron comes to Miami, him and D-Wade will tear it up and win championship after championship.|`|s1IkFOJVaa	the heat have the best chance in the east to beat the cavs or the celtics|`|WLXFAeSnaa	Nope. Sad for them, good for us Cavs/Celtics fans.|`|GBGcI509aa	Well the Heat very well could make it to the second round.<br>  <br>  Maybe farther but I doubt it.<br>  <br>  And the Pistons do have hope.<br>  <br>  When theres a sheed theres a way.|`|2eGMXYaIaa	Not in the playoffs.  Heat lack serious size and the Pistons are just a mess, a team without an identity.  I think Atlanta is more a threat than those two teams, I agree.|`|H8u7gMAYaa	No, I don't think so in the playoffs. Their time has just gone and went. They are no longer an elite team in the East.|`|op4fEbEVaa	No they're too good

lnRMmSeyaa	if you want to go really far down your going to have to build muscle in your standing leg, try doing some lunges off ice, running, and doing jumping jacks<br>  <br>  but when your going into your sit-spin make sure your not already leaning forward, keep your back up then when you go into your spin start to sit and make sure your on a flat to inside edge blade, if your too much on a inside your circle will start to get too big and you will fall and if your on a outside you wont be able to spin very fast, then once your start moving kinda slow bring yourself back up do a 1 foot spin or a scratch and end<br>  <br>  figure skater of 6 years <3|`|Flj3Xy47aa	ok i'm a professional figure skater and the siting spin is not as hard as it looks you don't have to have any muscles it's just a logical problem of ice-skaters.So what you have to do is when you go into the spin you'll have to quickly lean a tiny bit forwards,then you'll have to put your ice-skate round the other leg and spin. That way you'll spin safer and much FASTER . After when you finish the sitting-spin come up and a least do 3 more leg spins <br>    hope i helped Ali :-)|`|JiEvzbjVaa	first of all, keep your leg straight. its sometimes better to not go down low and have a nice straight legs, than to get down really low, and have your leg all bent. <br>  try swinging your leg, and grab near your ankle, and straighten it. its okay for now if your dont sit, or if your knees kinda bent. <br>  but you have to know, that its A LOT easier sitting down in a sit spin when your legs straight. it makes a huge difference.|`|AA11615133	well, how are you doing it know?<br>  <br>  You will need to build muscles in your legs. I'm a figure skater, and it took me a while to get down far. You have to have good quads, etc.|`|YjIZQ4oQaa	You will need to work on your stomach muscles by doing sits up. The stronger the muscle the lower you can go down on sit spins

rFQXKD64aa	On carve turns : <br>  <a href="http://www.winter-sports.com/EN/Ski_lessons/carved_turns.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.winter-sports.com/EN/Ski_less...</a><br>  On side-slipping :<br>  <a href="http://www.winter-sports.com/EN/Ski_lessons/skidding.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.winter-sports.com/EN/Ski_less...</a><br>  <br>  The website has a bunch of online ski lessons that explain pretty well what the different techniques are.. Hope it helps|`|OrG2fBbKaa	A carved turn in skiing is the use of the edge of the ski in motion to describe an arc through the turn where the tail of the ski follows the tip in one clean line through the snow. It happens when the skis are on edge and pressure is applied through the boot to the ski. The size of the turn is determined by the ski design and the amount of pressure that is applied to the ski. <br>   Side slipping is the movement down the hill sideways of the skier and the skis.|`|iNqN0pp9aa	A "carve turn" is a wide turn made using the sides of our new parabolic skis. If you lean over like in roller skating the ski will turn for you. It will go in a perfect arc if you wish, it edpends on how much you lean over. One thing to remember is to spread your feet far apart, say at least shoulder width. What this does is keep your outside ski (the one you have most of your weight on) from hitting your other boot and lifting that outside ski off the ground. If you do you will spin like a top! It is fun as long as there is nothing in front of you to run into.<br>  You also combine the carving turns. Go to the left and near the end of the turn, shift your weight to the other ski and lean the other way going to the right. If you look back at your trail you should see lines from the EDGES of the skis in the snow and it should be an even arch. You should also be able to see where you made your turn. If you do it correctly there will be a trail of edges only and no tracks from the flat part of the ski.<br>  When you get really good youwill be able to touch the ground just like the snow boarders do when they carve. You will find that it is a new demention in skiing and a lot of fun.<br>  Side slipping is just like you said. You should be able to control your side slip by going forward or backwards. Once this is learned you can generally get yourself out of any mess that you managed to get yourself into. It is also used in the final step for controling speed on the steeps.|`|ESGQtKS0aa	<a href="http://www.skileb.com/tips/carving-skis/" rel="nofollow">http://www.skileb.com/tips/carving-skis/</a><br>  <br>  this site has a picture of a guy carving as well as instructions.
MhySf1guaa	No you cant thats a double dribble.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  How stupid is that guy?|`|KdhNCnEjaa	If you catch the ball and use two hands to initiate your first dribble it is legal, but after the ball hits the floor its one hand only.|`|q8mbICQ8aa	Double Dribble a little bit...|`|LU96bnCdaa	no that is called a double dribble<br>  & if u walk more than 2 steps without dribbling that is called a travel.|`|Jn0Los9baa	No, because it is called double dribble.|`|wd9EPcGWaa	no.  thats double dribble|`|FgTkF31iaa	no the foul is called double dribbling|`|htwLoaVKaa	no, this is called a double dribble. even if you dont completely pick the ball up, u may only touch the ball with one hand at a time... hope this helps!
EASHSCe3aa	I suggest working out.  Not hard, but specific to throwing.  I.E. shoulders, biceps, back, legs...<br>  <br>  I find a throwing program works well too.  Major leaguer's throw about 280 days out of the year.  Of course you won't be able to do this, but when you can here's what I do.<br>  <br>  After warming up your arm, stretching, ect, start from 60. Feet.  Throw for three minutes.  Increase to 90. Feet. Throw for three minutes.  Go to 120. Feet, throw for three minutes. Then work your way back, again three minutes at each length. <br>  This will help you every day, you'll defnitly feel the difference in a week.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|u4kO7Fgfaa	Put your wind up on U-tube so we can see you pitch; it may be a mechanical issue.|`|l7IdlcHSaa	practice or get a trainer|`|33f4c852804fa42db9a7cbb912480080aa	Work out your arms, obviously to get stronger in the upper body, which will improve your speed on the fastball...|`|uh2bkRrFaa	You can start by learning how to use the caps button. Generally pitchers never gain speed on their fastball when they write like a third grader.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.

rNUyV1EYaa	Marion Barber and Demarcus Ware. Honest.<br>  <br>  T.O. was never one of my favorite players on the Cowboys.

oAOUAVVAaa	The Bucs.  When Morris took over the defensive play calling duties in mid December is when Tampa Bay's slide started.  They couldn't stop anybody from running for 150 yards or more.  Now he's the head coach.  They got a new GM and all they are doing is cutting some of their best players, and trading for a head case in Winslow Jr.  This team is going to be bad, and for a while.|`|rNUyV1EYaa	I agree, the Chiefs are a possibility. But the NFL changes so much from one year to the next; the worst team next year could be one we all think will be good.<br>  <br>  For example; the Seahawks fell to 4-12 last year after going 11-5 in 2007.|`|4KTe107Yaa	I say Notre Dame will really suck next year.

YlBLz9lTaa	L.T|`|tzrLDbHWaa	I'd say LT, easily.  As for their futures, they probably still have some left in the tank, though they would be best off in places where they can share the load, instead of being the only HB, as it would extend their careers.|`|rNUyV1EYaa	All time, I think LT is better.<br>  <br>  As for right now, I can't say. Both have dealt with injuries in recent years; and neither had seasons to be proud of in 2008.<br>  <br>  But if I had to choose one, he'd be Tomlinson.|`|KZsdVGJzaa	i honestly think L.J. is better. like the guy above me L.T. is past his prime. Larry was drafted the same year as Roethlisberger mayb the year before well He's Young<br>  <br>  yes L.T. was better<br>  if he had some support at the QB and O-line positions then he would definitely b the 3rd best RB after<br>  Adrian Peterson and Steven Jackson|`|ak44mIy3aa	LT Larry was never as dominant as LT, yes he has pas his time but still think he is better, when he is healthy he is very reliable.|`|Lcnc8952aa	They're both washed up.|`|1i9mrq5Yaa	LT is the better one|`|cypNCoh3aa	At no point was Johnson ever a better player, even now.  The best thing for Tomlinson would be to settle into a Fred Taylor-like role splitting carries and Johnson should just be shot or put in jail.  And given his personality, there's a good chance that one of those happens soon.|`|oW9DGfWWaa	i could find larry johnson in my back yard in the hole my dog dug..... hes garbage LT is a hall of fame running back end of discussion.. he can run, throw and catch!! hes simply amazing and still has it... hasnt had a rushing season under 1000 yards|`|VU6ODC5Baa	Ladainian Tomlinson|`|4RrhXJZwaa	I would say L.T.<br>  For the most part he is more consistantly good than Larry Johnson|`|s1Q9vnqmaa	LT|`|vnzSTerjaa	LT, no question
LReOvHEdaa	Both  are prone to giving away cheap goals from set pieces..<br>  I would like you to reframe your question...<br>  Who is more likely to attack or create more chances ?Roma or Juventus?<br>  After watching first leg Juventus looked far more dangerous than Roma.<br>  Chelsea should work a little bit more harder than Arsenal defensively.<br>  I am gonna watch the highlights as to how Chelsea managed to lose to Roma :|<br>  Oh boy it was more of Vucinic vs Chelsea lol. luckily he wasn't playing  the first leg.|`|gpNIG15eaa	Chelsea.Not only have they have regained the old spirit that was reminiscent in the Jose Mourinho days,but also they have a revitalised Drogba who's gelling with the top scorer Anelka.|`|WS8MvKQAaa	Well Chelsea has the tougher opponent, and my magical spells against them...so Arsenal:P|`|d249327bb8b9be89e88a359ce5e59a58aa	Chelsea - new manager Drogba stopping being a lazy B<br>  stuff to prove<br>  chelsea dont spiel - its a youth team rubbish - this arsenal team has been so young for how long - ooops sorry he sold them?|`|SIKuOevVaa	Arsenal will be healthier in Rome than they were against a weakening Roma team.  Whereas Chelski may get their babushkas handed to them.|`|e197cb3f4211de6521dcc6f8afc0358caa	Defending a 1-0 lead is hard. Defending a 2-0 lead isn't that hard. And I back Chelsea to get the away goal as they are more potent than Arsenal can hope to be.|`|fLpnC8qtaa	I think both can though I do believe that Hiddink will make Chelsea a stronger and better playing team as weeks go on. I think they may do it a little easier.|`|A7QROnjLaa	Chelsea for sure. Cos they have the more reliable defence, and also cos Roma score a lot of goals at home. <br>  <br>  The real answer is Liverpool though.|`|xLyNsywiaa	Arsenal, can't score, but haven't conceded in a while either...|`|q71osfkiaa	Oh that's cruel.|`|8QxVjXUxaa	chelsea cuz drog-god is back|`|65zKevOvaa	our team|`|jiFHJ6daaa	CHELSEA...........coz they got better defenders
PGlZn1wEaa	Not even close. Are we gonna relate anything friggin black to Dale Sr?   Sheesh.|`|IGRJUYefaa	I agree that Stewart-Haas must work with the sponsors they have. If Stewart-Haas' colors are black, silver & red then the car will be a combo of those colors. No one say that Ryan is the ONLY driver since Sr. to run a car with black, silver & red on it. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, including Ryan & Tony about a somewhat "old school" paint scheme. Everyone knows that they are both "old school" drivers. I had never noticed the paint scheme was that close to Sr., but if it is then it was done as a tribute.|`|1IWEKwznaa	No. Come on! The #, the paint scheme, etc don't need to be put off in a dead section of NASCAR never to be touched and deemed "too painful to look at."<br>  <br>  I mean, I love the man. I never saw him race, but I look up to him as a racing legend, fifth best ever in NASCAR to David Pearson, Jeff Gordon, Richard Petty, and Jimmie Johnson. But, the fact of the matter is he's dead and we've mourned him. We can look back at him, but we need to move on.|`|i8soZLfRaa	No, I don't think so. In fact, I will go so far as to say, the sponsors should be allowed to put pretty much whatever they like on the car, so long as it's legal and family friendly.

It's time to get over it.|`|AA11383171	Ryan's car looked great.  He has to work with the sponsors he has.  Haas CNC colors are Red, Black and Gray.  Yes I admit it was similar, but so what.

Is that so bad?|`|yfyKisnsaa	No Way.....not even close, same colors but way different design.<br>  <br>  GO HARVICK & RCR!!!!!|`|Qz80EA45aa	I noticed it, but it doesn't bother me. What can I say, I grew up watching for that paint scheme to roar past the screen, in a blur, among a pack of cars. It just stirred some old memories, nothing that I would say was out of line. In fact the same thing used to happen to me when, I believe it was the number 4 Morgan-Mclure car, ran the State Water Heaters sponsorship.|`|iO12Vjnvaa	It's a good looking car....but it's not too similar. I think SPEED is trying to create "drama" during their telecast.

1ced09090a18210ce355123ea9003d99aa	That is extremely annoying.  Instead of showing every wrestler's entrance (which we've all seen millions of times), they should show their commercials THEN come back, start the match and show it in it's entirety.|`|OHBvEYKHaa	i was just thinking that too when i was watching ecw in the middle of the cage vs swagger match it was getting really good and they cut to commercial|`|a5hNA3Kxaa	I have noticed that too, like right in the middle of a great match I can hear just by what Cole is saying its about to go to a commercial<br>  <br>  Heres an example:<br>  <br>  " OMG both of these men down, who will win-(now I know its a commercial) we will find out when RAW returns"<br>  <br>  Yeah its annoying, but just like any other TV show there has to be commercials.|`|3074it1Qaa	i agree u always miss a good chunk of the match. before the break one superstar is in control and then after the break a whole bunch of **** happened and now the other guy is in control it is really annoying. but they have to show all of those commercials because of the sponsors.|`|f8aa8e21997cfa7908574dfa12f124cdaa	My friend, if I was the head of either company, I would informed the prespected TV networks (Spike and My Network TV) to cut back on their commercials.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|Bp3bt5bCaa	Only on RAW.

IWM1khX7aa	5-10%<br>  There are too many teams that are way better than Germany and there will be a lot of surprise teams.  Germany has an old squad and their youth players haven't excelled (maybe Tony Kroos but he's the only one).  With Argentina, Spain, and brazil all being top contenders, it's unlikely that Germany will go anywhere.  I als othink Joachim Low is a good manager but not the best.  Their players aren't that good either.|`|WS8MvKQAaa	20% sounds reasonable|`|MjPd9vyYaa	I'd say what Miranada said.|`|PLjFY8Fpaa	I'd say 10-15% chance of that.

NJMzhcKhaa	BRUCE LEE<br>  Bruce Lee is not a master of anything. All this training in Martial Art is half-way.<br>  He never won any championship other than an amateur boxing competition, his one fight against a kung-fu master that really has a witness and not just a one-sided account was controversial, with his wife claiming that Lee beat the kung-fu master in no time at all and with master Wong Jack Man claiming the fight goes for 20-25 minutes with Lee using more deadly sets of attack and him defending it not wanting to really deliver a crippling or killing blow himself.<br>  The account of the witness lies more closely to Wong Jack Man as he claimed the fight goes about 20-25 minutes and nobody was down and pounded as Linda Lee claimed.<br>  <a href="http://www.irontrybe.com/forum/showthread.php?t=52062" rel="nofollow">http://www.irontrybe.com/forum/showthrea...</a><br>  Bruce Lee's legendary status only comes from his strong media backing and his then unique movie that show moves dazzling the viewers, his JKD is not even a martial art, it's his philosophy, he deemed his art, Jun Fan Gung Fu as not enough and still in pursue to make his art complete.<br>  No doubt, Lee is a talented martial artist. Given more time of training and more diversity, Lee might become a great martial artist, but Lee at the point of his death is by far not the greatest martial artist at all.<br>  <br>  JET LI<br>  Jet Li is a prodigy in martial artist chinese wushu arena. He won the all China championship 5 times in a row and retired while he was on top. His performance was said to be so dazzling that during his performance in America, he got invitation by the then US president Nixon to be his personal bodyguard.<br>  Jet Li is the real deal when it comes to martial art, and he is a master in wushu.<br>  <br>  JACKIE CHAN<br>  Jackie moves as you can see in his movies, show that it's more acrobatic-ish than being a martial art. You're not wrong. Jackie Chan was not a martial artist, his training was in performing art as acrobat more than as a martial art fighter.<br>  Jackie Chan, along with his close friends Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao are all product of China Drama academy, Peking Opera school.<br>  While there are elements of martial art in the training, it mostly for performance.<br>  <br>  TONY JAA<br>  Tony Jaa is also a prodigy, he started by mimicking the moves done by those 3 names above according to his interview with TIMES magazine in 2004, sommersaulting from back of elephant and playing with the elephant while bathing them in his father's paddy field.<br>  Tony Jaa goes on and join a stunt team, he went to study physical education from a well known university in Thailand.<br>  Jaa goes on and study for one year the ancient Muay Thai style with the intention of making a movie around it, which leads to Ong-Bak.<br>  <br>  <br>  Based on the assertion above, it was a close competition between Jet Li and Tony Jaa although I will still give the title best martial artist between these four to Jet Li as he has mastered many aspects of Chinese martial art.<br>  <br>  And I just saw one comment about Lee beating Chuck Norris. Lee NEVER BEAT Chuck Norris, nor Norris ever admitted being beaten by Lee or would've been beaten by Lee if they ever fight. Lee actually learn more from Norris than the other way around.<br>  Here's the interview with Chuck Norris with Norris dispelling that myth.<br>  <a href="http://wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&pageId=60309" rel="nofollow">http://wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&pa...</a><br>  The only time Lee beat Norris is in the movie.|`|awMnTrEHaa	Bruce lee, he's the real deal. In real life he was contantly challenged by martial arts masters trying to stop him from teaching martial arts to non asian people (this is fact and not a fabrication in the movies)  and i've never heard of him losing them. he created jeet kune do=which was essentially a style with no style and emphasized on being able to adapt to any situation in a fight. personally what kind of style would you prefer out of fighting styles even if you could combine them. I'm going with lees technique just cause of its philosphy.|`|xBgL8mhYaa	Bruce Lee, hands down. He mastered 6 different martial arts, and created his own, Jeet Kune Do.  He could do elevated V-sits for inhumanly long periods of time, his strikes were blurs because they were so fast, and he could do pushups on 2 fingertips, with his other hand held behind his back! I know many famous martial artists from many different world famous teams, including Team XMA, and none of them have ever been able to accomplish that! In addition, his 1 inch punch would knock someone back several feet, and his sidekicks were so powerful, that in the words of one recipient, it felt like being hit by a car. He knocked someone through a pile of warehouse crates before. Don't believe me that Bruce Lee was the master? Well, perhaps this last bit of information will persuade you: HE SINGLE-HANDEDLY CRUSHED CHUCK NORRIS IN A FULL CONTACT SPARRING MATCH!|`|IGJWF3VBaa	A toss up between Jet Li and Tony Jaa but I think that Jet Li would have the edge.<br>  <br>  But Jackie Chan is the most entertaining to watch.|`|AA11883382	i would say bruce lee and i say this for several reasons. bruce conditoned himself and trained every moment he could, he had the fastest hands and could land punches in the blink of an eye. while many people think of him being mainly a kung fu practicioner, and this is somewhat true, he had his beginnings there, but he actually studied many martial arts. he studied both striking and grappling arts. in all actuality, he was the first mixed martial artist.|`|7XSvp533aa	Lets not forget that bruce lee made up jet kun do. He also inspired people to take martial arts. He is also made awesome deadly techniques. I go for bruce leee. waaaaaaaaaaaa|`|Cm3ET5TQaa	I would say bruce lee because not only was he good at his martial art he also created a new and very effective one, while tony jaa is just very good at muay thai|`|LUnscegvaa	Bruce lee.<br>  <br>  I'd suggest<br>  <br>  Best wishes :)***|`|w9kSGLBxaa	I would have to see the test scores of the official "who is the best martial artist" test first.

XLXncQu9aa	Right now I'd have to say the Bears or the Bucs.  I say the Bears because they are in need of a good solid QB.  Kyle Orton has had some success in the offense, but he is inconsistent. Some games he looks good, and some he doesn't.  Rex Grossman is definitely not the answer.  I believe the Bears need a QB that can get that offense moving and Cassel could be the guy to do that.  The only problem is the Bears don't have any weapons offensively to work with. Secondly, the Bucs may want to check him out, but if they can work a deal by trading draft picks.  The Bucs are in a re-building situation, and from the QB's they have, they won't win many games.  Getting rid of Jeff Garcia was a bad idea, and they will suffer for it.  If Cassel were to go there he could work wonder's with the little they have.  I'm doubtful of the Vikings getting him because they just signed Sage Rosensfuls which means they may look to him to be starter next season.|`|Vyz5YnZqaa	The Patriots|`|7RziqsDcaa	Trust me, he was only good because he had Randy Moss and Wes Welker.<br>  <br>  Try putting him on the Bears and see what happens. In fact, try putting Tom Brady/Peyton Manning on the Bears and see what happens.<br>  <br>  Either way, it won't be pretty. They have the worst receiving corps in NFL history.|`|JKbvnwcDaa	Nobody. There is a reason that dude hadn't played a game since high school. Don't believe the hype.|`|Lcnc8952aa	San Francisco|`|qjCl8paPaa	i say kansas city|`|7B9KEqCnaa	rams have bulger, and the cardinals can resign warner for the money matt cassell requires, plus they have Lienart waiting in the wings.  The vikings probably benefit the most.  He'd be a good fit at the lions if they could get him for a 2nd rounder.  Then they dont have to invest the #1 overall in Stafford, who probably be not much better than cassel.  Cassel would also be a good fit in at KC, where piloli is trying to instill the same system as NE, so he'd bring some system experience with him.|`|U3KAgO0baa	The team that would be the best if they got matt Cassel would be the 49ers. They have a great RB, they have a Tight End who seemed 2 Turn the switch on when Mike Singletery Dogg Cussed em, and they should make some effort 2 upgrade at the WR position (They have some young Talent at WR,already). and the Defense is Decent enough 2 win.|`|gBfPkdroaa	yea, the vikings but they just got a QB, rosenfield from the texans. so idk.<br>  <br>  id have to say maybe the bucs. with antonio bryant, wouldnt be so bad.<br>  <br>  but ask yourself this, can Matt cassel do good in a team whose WR arent so good and quick? or can he do good in a team with an oline that isnt as good.|`|xxtvhn5Naa	Yeah, I'm gunna go with the Rams too.  I want him to go to the Vikings, because i think he would rock there, but as you mentioned, they don't have a good WR.  The Rams have a couple of good WRs, so if they were to nab him, they would be good to go.|`|ak44mIy3aa	i honestly think he is extremely overrated, look at the receivers he had and the o Line that he had.

1ced09090a18210ce355123ea9003d99aa	"Smarks" aren't wrestling fans.  They are internet wrestling critics who feel the need to complain about everything in the wrestling business.  THEY are the ones making it hard to discuss wrestling with other wrestling fans, because they think they know more than the rest of us.  They take the "insider info" they get from spoiler sites as gospel and feel the need to push it onto wrestling fans.  They look down on those of us who are wrestling fans, who discuss wrestling AS IF everything we see is real, and who actually enjoy the shows.<br>  <br>  "Smarks" dissect everything that goes on in wrestling, looking for mistakes they can crow about, rarely saying anything positive about pro wrestling.<br>  <br>  "Smarks" are wannabe movie critics who don't know what they're doing.  They seem to think that if they aren't bashing something or someone they aren't being "real" critics.  Their sole purpose for being seems to be to do everything they can to ruin the experience for wrestling fans.<br>  <br>  "Smarks" are tiresome.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't go so far as to say they are ruining the wrestling industry, but they offer nothing positive to the business or to the fans.  To me, "smarks" are just whiners, complaining about everything in the wrestling business, most of which the majority of fans don't care about.<br>  <br>  Rooting around spoiler sites, trying to find some nugget of supposedly "insider info" or "secret" they can trump other "smarks" with, IS detrimental.  Most wrestling fans don't want to know what's going to happen before it does.  And on the odd chance that they actually do find a real bit of information, good storylines or angles are changed, generally into something not nearly as good as was originally planned.<br>  <br>  "Smarks" are pests, but I wouldn't call them the ruin of the wrestling industry, mostly because they are wrong so often.|`|QBcs78Ntaa	recognise the name but never seen him wrestler or anything|`|cypNCoh3aa	So you're saying you would rather have seen Christian-Jeff Hardy rather than a Hardy bros. feud leading up to a match at Wrestlemania?

AA10240928	Maybe if you go with one of the hand cannon cartridges like 500 S&W Mag, 454 Cassul, 50 AE or the like.<br>  <br>  But generally, combat handguns are not designed to be one shot stoppers due to the inherent weakness of pistol cartridges in comparison to rifle cartidges.  Pistols are defensive for emergencies as a last resort weapon, and they help you fight your way to your rifle.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  If limited to common defense loads, then there is no guarantee of one shot stops.  They are too weak based on my readings.|`|6KaMW1Vzaa	Sorry, Dirty Harry to the contrary, the 44 Magnum seems not to be one of the top stoppers. Possibly it goes through too fast?<br>  357 Magnum from a 4" barrel was tops in Marshall's compilation, though the difference between that and the 45's probably didn't reach statistical significance. It's quite likely nothing has ever really surpassed the original black-powder army load in the 45 Colt!|`|mFa5ZDtcaa	Probably .357 and .45 acp.<br>  <br>  If I hit a guy in the Adam's Apple or ticker with a .38 spl, he's done.<br>  <br>  To be honest, if you miss with the first shot, the bad guy probably is not going to stay around for you to get many more shots and he certainly is not going to ask you what caliber your weapon is.|`|AA10232434	from researching gelatin ballistics and and other statistics you will see that once you get to the 44 mag and above the bullet has too much energy for a thin skinned human, it would go right through them.... the idea is to deposit all the energy of the bullet into the target.<br>  <br>  no doubt the two best would be a .45 or a .357 mag out of a 4 inch barrel or longer within 30 feet.  at longer distances a different caliber may be better.<br>  <br>  and to the "125 grain man stopper" it does not penetrate as deep as a heavier grain.<br>  <br>  if i had to choose i would pick a .357 mag  4 inch barrel stainless steel model (for recoil reasons) with 140 to 158 grain hollow point bullet<br>  <br>  but as stated above, nothing is 100%|`|Ucbnl7VJaa	Absolutely none can guarantee one-shot stops.<br>  <br>  The closest are those with both good momentum & kinetic energy, plus a fast expanding bullet. So look at the .357 magnum with 125-40gr JHP type bullets, 9mm Luger +P or +P+ w/115-124gr JHP, .40 S&W w/ 150-5gr JHP,full-power 10mm Auto w/150-170gr .45 ACP w/185-200gr JHP type or in +P w/any JHP. Pretty much any cartridge when using Glaser or Mag-Safe ammunition is an excellent stopper as well. <br>  <br>  The normal .44 Mag is not a REALLY good stopper because most loads for it don't expand fast enough, even the 180gr JHP loads are slow enough expanding that they dont' do signifigantly more damage then the lead SWC or JSP types. So you just get the same through and through result. Best choice there are probably the mid-range JHP types made specifically for combat use.|`|ca6144d7933bfd99d11441a498f7e603aa	Any cartridge that you can hit a person in a lethal area with the first shot. That includes all from .22 short to .450 S & W. <br>  The trick is to hit that lethal spot. No matter the caliber, if you can not hit that spot, there will be no "one shot stop".<br>  People can argue all day about the best, but relying on accumulated data will tell you the .357 is best. Since more .357 rounds have been used on humans, it is logical there would be more one shot stops.|`|3e8e34aadabc9c4673b05bc7f3e997a0aa	Since there are people that survived after being shot by every single caliber ever made, there are exactly ZERO guarantees! <br>  <br>  Naturally, the larger the caliber the more mass and energy transfer are possible in an impact.

And when it comes to "stopping power", pistols are woefully inadequate.<br>  <br>  .25/.32/.380 are not "common defense loads".  They are sub-par rounds which exist only because they needed to be that underpowered long ago in order to be able to make small, easily-carried guns, and for crappy socialist countries which bar their citizens from carrying the mainstream rounds (on the pretense that, since militaries adopted them, they must be "military calibers").<br>  <br>  Sure, a .500 S&W packs a punch equivalent to an intermediate carbine round, but you're talking about a very large, very heavy revolver whose kick will send the gun vertical.<br>  <br>  The "big three" (9mm +P, .40, .45) are where acceptable levels of penetration start.  The .44 Magnum is about double the power of the .40/.45, and half the power of a .500 S&W, but still has a TON of recoil and requires a big magnum revolver.<br>  <br>  For a gun you can feasibly carry, the .357 Magnum is about where you top out.  It's halfway between the .40/.45 and the .44 Magnum (750 ft-lbs of energy, vs 500 and 1000).<br>  <br>  But wait--the 10mm, from which the shorter .40 was developed, has comparable energy to a .357 Magnum but is a pistol round!  Not only that, but you can get compact pistols for it.  A Glock 29 gives you 10+1 rounds (vs. 5-6) of 10mm in a compact-sized pistol.<br>  <br>  It won't guarantee a one shot stop, but it's still a very capable round, and with 11 of them in a manageable package you should be firing double taps, so to me that's about the ideal combination if you want guaranteed stopping power.|`|XtUWmTJVaa	A .45 is certainly one of the best semi-auto rounds that I've ever fired, and if you have a hollow-point or similar type round, you will do serious damage with one shot.  A .357 magnum is usually a little bit more powerful, and again I'd suggest a hollow-point round for maximum damage.  Forget the huge calibers, the .44 Magnum, .454, .50, .500, etc.  They'll put down a charging grizzly if you take the right shot (trust me on this), and they'll take off a man's arm, leg, head, whatever.  But they're extremely powerful and I wouldn't suggest anyone shooting those rounds without extensive practice or you'll find yourself with a stinging hand that USED to hold a gun in it.  .45 or .357 magnum is my choice for ultimate home defense, but any round in the hands of someone who knows how to use it will take someone down.  <br>  <br>  Forget the stories about .22 and .25 bouncing off leather jackets at 5 feet.  They certainly won't kill you with one round unless you get a shot to the head or heart, but they'll put you on a surgeons table for seven hours and THEN you'll die.  All guns are deadly and are not toys, despite what some people apparently would like to think.|`|4ybzs1Knaa	Even a .22 cal can stop an animal.   The question is: are you that good of a shot to hit a vital organ in a single shoot.   As to a large caliber, one advantage is: if you hit the target, it will move.  But if you miss, you will have one angry animal on your hands.  <br>  <br>  So the question is: what size animal are you thinking of.  If you miss a bull's vital spot, you will have a very angry animal on your hands and full grown it could be a ton or more.<br>  <br>  Your question has too many variables to be valid.  Sorry.|`|WrST72xraa	I have to wonder how many idiots answering this have ever actually shot a handgun. By the answers I would say none. A 44 magnum or 44 special has more knockdown than a 357. A 45 has more than a 357.<br>  The rocket scientist would said 32 has been smoking too much rope.<br>  Go here and take a look:<a href="http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/849728/posts" rel="nofollow">http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news...</a> <br>   All that being said you need to realize that when you say knockdown power there is really no such thing. No matter what size handgun unless you hit someone in the central nervous system no one bullet is going to stop them. You can put your first shot through the heart and they can still come forward and harm you. Do the research for yourself and find out.|`|ev48pcJ5aa	in reality the difference is made by the location of impact and the characteristics of the target.  a .22 can kill someone (maybe a skinny person) if it pierces the heart, yet you could shoot a large person 5 times in the stomach with a .45 and they could still be able to charge you<br>  <br>  and this has happened before.  <br>  <br>  that's why in my opinion shot placement is most important|`|af7ce13ee0e507bafa01801420f23631aa	.44 magnum RP 240gr SWC Medium<br>  <br>  and <br>  <br>  .45 ACP<br>  Fed 230gr HSHP|`|75aQ13RCaa	I have always been partial to the .357 mag, .44 mag, .50 AE, and S&W .500 (is an actual handgun cartridge).<br>  <br>  In my personal opinion these are the best when it comes to stopping power.  I have only heard these cartridges fail to stop a target on very few occasions.<br>  <br>  Ok so if I have this right:<br>  The claim of stopping power would stem from the following:<br>  1) The size of the round<br>       a) Also dependant upon powder load<br>  2) Type of the round (HP, MP, SP, FMJ)<br>       a) Also dependant upon the expansion the round makes<br>  3) Range of the shot<br>  4) Then physics plays its part<br>  <br>  Now to sum it all up in the following example:<br>  A S&W .500 for example would naturally have a high powder load, and would have the best stopping power with a Hollow Point at short range.  <br>  <br>  This would be due to the size and weight of the bullet.  <br>  <br>  Abullet of this size would naturally be more suceptible to gravity and the vaccum it creates when it is in flight, which in turn would cause it to lose velocity and fall faster than a smaller caliber round.<br>  <br>  So for purposes of range and stopping power the best caliber and round type would be: <br>  .357 magnum in a Hollow Point<br>  <br>  This is due to the fact that it will fly faster and farther than other rounds.  <br>  <br>  Smaller rounds would be more suceptible to being knocked around by the wind, where as larger rounds woul succumb to gravity and the vaccum they create in there trail (all things that move create a temporary vaccum that pulls on them causing them to slow down over a period of time).<br>  <br>  The .357 magnum is the most powerful midsized round, which makes it the ideal round for most self defence circumstances.<br>  <br>  The Hollow Pointed round would have the best expansion upon impact; however, it can become warped due to mishandling.  It is advised to make sure that you get a quality Jacketed Hollow Point.|`|8ivnzNi5aa	No cartridge can make a 100 percent guarantee of such performance, except maybe the 30mm round used in the A-10 "Warthog" attack jet.  Since those aren't likely to be used in a pistol (hell, you could almost make a pistol from the brass!), the .500 S&W Magnum is probably as close as you can get with a civilian-legal bullet.  Even rifle rounds have been known to fail to make one-shot stops.|`|X2ZsYRNWaa	If you hit them in the arm or the leg with just about anything they could still come after you.  And people that are hopped up on drugs or just adrenaline have been known to live for a surprising amount of time with bullets through the heart, long enough to shoot back.  The only guaranteed one shot stops are to the brain stem.  Pretty much anything that will make it that far will do.

tzrLDbHWaa	Well, the easiest way is to not really worry about "who is throwing the ball" but "where the ball is coming from".  For example, ground ball hit to short and he throws the runner out at first.  You don't need to remember who the SS was (thats already on the scorecard anyway on the other teams lineup), all you need to know was the ball was hit to the SS, so its a 6-3 putout.  As for outs.... you can look at your scorebook to see how many outs there are, since you would have marked the outs.|`|d11198287fd025ed5755e805b28b06adaa	Knowing the # 's of the positions will help: 1=Pitcher;2=catcher;3=1st base;4=2ndbase;5=3rd base;6=shortstop;7left field;8center;9right field.ground ball to third 3rd baseman throws to first to get runner out. u but in the book:5-3 so on in the game. Read the score book it also tells u how to keep score. Also u can use the player who is going to pitch in the next game to keep your pitch count and for your team put down what kind of pitch you batter got a hit on or made out on. Have pre printed sheets for this info. Like pitches your pitcher threw, Pitches that your hitters made out or got a hit on. Then after the game u can put that info in the score book|`|439bb8e9dd46532d20f20e3ec0b9fa18aa	Get someone to sit with you to help you keep track until you get the hang of it.  Another thing you can do is videotape the game, and when there is a break in the action, you can rewind and replay specific plays to make sure you have the scoring correct.|`|qivUrJ3Naa	Just pay attention to the game.|`|9NnDTOxtaa	You can by this little piece of equipment to keep vare of strikes and balls and outs at a models or sports authority the rest i don't know i play not ref|`|c6q3EERdaa	As hard as it is going to be, you have to pay attention to the game pretty much at all times. I was the scorekeeper for the freshman team my freshman year, and it was hard since I was rooting for my teammates while keeping score at the same time, and the fact that I hadn't kept score in a while was troublesome too. Practice, because I was a little rusty when I started out.|`|0TAld46gaa	Why don't you get an assistant to keep track of the game<br>  so you can just worry about the managing of teh game

wBGjks5uaa	Okay, sometimes NCAA teams use either college courts or NBA courts. For a college court the farther three point line is 20 feet 9 inches, which the NCAA extended (It use to be 19 feet 9 inches), for MEN ONLY. I'm pretty sure the women's three point line is still 19 feet 9 inches. Just watch a women's game and you can see where the they take their threes from. Also, on a NBA court, the three point line is 23 feet 9 inches, which is for NBA players of course and the shorter line is 20 feet 9 inches.|`|6yoQhXsOaa	One is for Men and one is for women.|`|0eSS5YhEaa	wow don't call people retarded unless you know what you are talking about. In places where there aren't nba games there are two lines one at 19 feet 9 inches for men and one at 20 feet 9 inches for women. THIS CHANGED THIS YEAR, and was done because the league decided people were getting too good at the original distance. If there is an NBA line it is at 23 feet 9 inches at the top and 22 feet in the corners|`|AA10977229	one is for the girls team that plays in that stadium and one is for the boys. the boys is farther out|`|olPHAnfYaa	The line closer to the free throw line was the old 3 point line. they moved it back at the beginning of the season from 20.1 feet to 21.2 feet.|`|kKJhg9Eraa	one of the lines are for the womens 3 point line and the mens 3 point line is the longer one

XLXncQu9aa	Well, he is overrated to a certain degree.  The only reason why he received so much press during the season is because he wasn't expected to do so well.  I think he did do well with the team he has, because the Patriots have some great talent that he can use and has used.  The only thing is, when you are starting the season for the first time and you don't have a large reputation and you suddenly do well, you run the risk of fans and media jumping on the band wagon.  He did prove he can win, but he hasn't yet proven he can do it back to back seasons.  He had a great season, but the thing is what if we take away the Patriots main weapons?  A great QB can work with anyone even if they aren't that great of a team.  I think he is overrated because he hasn't proven he can stay consistent each year.  We know what Tom Brady has done.  Until Cassel builds more of a reputation like his partner Tom, then he will be overrated.|`|0TAld46gaa	I don't think Matt Cassel is overrated<br>  i don't think teams think of him as a superstar<br>  <br>  just a good quarterback<br>  who doesn't make many mistakes<br>  and manages a good game.<br>  <br>  And drew bress has weapons, Carson palmer has weapons,<br>  Jake delhomme is not a great quarterback and Matt Ryan played only one yr so you can't consider him a great|`|KZsdVGJzaa	if he's so overrated plz explain y. Based on me watching him during most of his games he showed me he was accurate, smart/took care of the ball, and can get the ball deep down the field. I'm not saying he is a great QB. i simply think he has potential <br>  <br>  u need a better example than those 4 to convince me<br>  BTW the falcons had the 11th ranked defense|`|PVe6jK78aa	Hes overrated and im a pats fan but someone will take him many teams are desperate for a QB and though hes overrated hes still a decent QB especially since hes only started in 15 games and he didn't have a good defense they had no secondary and the star on the defense was jerod mayo|`|7RziqsDcaa	Dude, that's exactly what I've been saying.<br>  <br>  He has freakin Randy Moss and Wes Welker.<br>  <br>  That's like giving a running-back a perfect bulked-up, steroid-injecting, offensive line.|`|K3UdUXZqaa	I have to disagree...hes proven that he could be a definate starter in the NFL.  That is the biggest part of a team.  its rare to find good talent. hes very accurate and good in the clutch. great mechanics. The only flaw is that he needs to calm down sometimes. He holds on to the ball a bit to long sometimes. takes too many sacks. if he can fix that simple flaw he will be a premiere QB. the pats are in for a BIG decision..half injured tom brady or young and fresh Matt Cassel., If the packers didnt have aaron rodgers id LOVE to have him. if u wanna argue watch the game against...the jets i think...on NFL network.  2 second left and he hits randy moss with a perfect strike in the corner of the endzone to get the game into overtime. Hes special end of story.|`|1i9mrq5Yaa	lmao<br>  hell yeah hes overrated<br>  let him play with the falcons <br>  he cant pull tht shi* off like matt ryan can<br>  cassel had a sweet defense and a sweet offense<br>  ryan had nothing<br>  and still finished 11-5!<br>  with a wild card!<br>  <br>  uhh this rams fan is crazy<br>  ryan has a shi**t defense and drew brees has really no one <br>  hes dumb man|`|vbPwJZqNaa	I also think he is way overrated. And I agree that he has potential, but he has a long way to go before he is a GREAT quarterback. So yes, I agree with you.|`|HPRlRlRYaa	but if he wasnt we be talkin about Matt Cassel is underrated you cant stick any QB in the patroits offense and they will do good so give the man his props|`|YlBLz9lTaa	i think hes over rated but extermemy he is a starter imo but iv been hearing top 5 QB no way!!!|`|Vyz5YnZqaa	I do. And so is Tom Brady, he proved that they are just in a great system. How many players have left NE as free agents and got a big contract just to be a bust? I can't think of one that went and played as good as they did in NE.
iO12Vjnvaa	It's actually a combination of things. <br>  <br>  #1----Generally the broadcast has anywhere from a 5 to 10 second<br>          delay to protect against foul language, bad crashes where things <br>          shouldn't be seen by the public, or other things that the FCC <br>          would ding a network over.<br>  <br>  #2-----Speed usually pauses the coverage during qualifying so that<br>           all the drivers can be seen qualifying although they do <br>           sometimes skip over the lesser known one car teams.<br>           From what I hear they do not do this during live races (trucks)<br>  <br>  #3------Speed is not as fast as they claim to be --LOL!|`|4l0yGuE9aa	I'm not sure if this is the reason but I remember a while back when Dale Earnhardt Jr said on TV "That ain't 'Sheet'" there was also the incident where one of Janet Jackson's boobs got loose on national TV and stations decided to monitor what was broadcast in order to keep drivers from saying things on TV that was against the FCC regulations. The FCC was pretty hot about the Janet Jackson boob thing during the Superbowl I believe it was and NASCAR didn't want to get an FCC fine so they put a time lag on the broadcast. FOXtrax on FOX is the same way. It is ahead slightly of the actual TV broadcast. It allows TV stations time to bleep unwanted material.<br>  <a href="http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,711007,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.redorbit.com/news/general/92079/nbc_adding_delay_to_nascar_telecasts/" rel="nofollow">http://www.redorbit.com/news/general/920...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E03E5DD153BF93BA35753C1A9629C8B63&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all" rel="nofollow">http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.ht...</a><br>  <br>  It started with the Janet Jackson thing and then after Dale Jr made his slip stations started the time lag.|`|JfGVUh9aaa	Probably just the satellite broadcast. I have a TV on rabbit ears on my computer desk at home and when my DirecTV is on the same local channel in the family room, the satellite is atleast 20 seconds or more behind the rabbit ears.|`|jLvlcoFBaa	They are rarely in sync with each other.|`|XNdDrXAzaa	nascar.com has their priorities in order|`|wEMlgh6Taa	There's a 5 second delay now--thank-you Janet Jackson!|`|AqZvhJMJaa	That is because they do the broadcast in a way to show almost every car.  When they go to commercial they pause the broadcast.
ViB84hYzaa	The Tigers have an excellent chance of taking the AL Central and then a run for the WS. Bonderman, Zumaya, Rodney, Wilis are all coming back healthy finally. The offense will not struggle as it did to start last season. I say again, you cannot overlook that offense which if they get off to a good start (unlike last year) they will take some pressure off of the pitching staff. Pitching is definitely the key here however I look for 1st in the division and maybe the AL Pennant.|`|DnFoaKPqaa	I don't see them winning the division, but they could easily surprise. Their pitching staff is not the best in the league. However, from what I've read Dontrelle Willis has been much better this offseason, and if that carries through, they won't have the worst pitching anymore. I like their lineup as long as Granderson stays healthy. Also, in all honesty I believe that Miggy will win the MVP for this season!|`|lcNQ2w57aa	They will be terrible. Fourth place at best.|`|fefYXm71aa	they can creep in the wild card|`|xd0sTRlwaa	Tigers are in a rebuilding mode after last year and they should provide plenty of highlights (especially the youngsters).  They have to get a good starting rotation set and then build from there.  You are right when you said that they are not a playoff caliber team this year...but give a year or two, they will be giving the Twins a run for their money.  Oh, and spring training games dont really count to the overall success of your team, but I know how it goes!|`|Yfhxtg0aaa	well all they do is have to stay healthy and they will probley win the al central dontrelle n VERLANDER have to live up to thier expectations and the rest of theier pitching sheff has to be healthy and then my yankees will crush them in the alds =p|`|c6q3EERdaa	I think the Tigers will struggle again. They didn't do a whole lot to help their pitching, and since their pitching was so bad last season, it's hard to know how '09 will look for them in that department. Offensively, I think it will be better, but I think their record in '09 will be similar to the one from last season.|`|YhfMrppSaa	Playoffs, and big surprise from last yr then this coming yr<br>  <br>  <br>  i want Houston and Texas take care the final for us

nIzmM8K3aa	1 Skate with People better than you <br>  This tip may be hard for some of you seeing that you may not know anybody that skates or you may be the best skater around. Well you still need to get out and find people better than you at competitions. But skating with people who are better than you on a regular basis helps you out tremendously, not only can they point out what your doing wrong, but you should want to get better so you will be able to skate on their level. <br>  <br>  2 Think about skating. <br>  Alright, to skate well, you need to know the mechanics of your skateboard. You need to know which corners of the board make the skateboard flip which way. You need to know what putting your weight in a certain spot does to that skateboard. Simply explore your skateboard and what it can do. Thinking about skateboarding is the easiest of these tips, you dont even have to do anything! Simply put, think about the mechanics of your skatebaoard, concentrate on if, then functions.<br>  <br>  3 Skate outside your comfort zone. <br>  Skate faster than normal, push what you would normally do. Don't be happy with ollieing that five stair. Go for six or seven, or even try to kickflip it. Don't be stupid though, don't go straight from ollieing that five stair to el toro. But expand your skating to not just including what you're used to.<br>  Simply put, Just skate harder, faster, and better.<br>  <br>  4 PRACTICE! <br>  Hopefully you guys all do this, practicing is essential in getting better. But one thing you have to make sure is dont practice bad technique. One of my favorite quotes is "Practice doesn't make perfect, Perfect practice makes perfect." You should go by this, practice hard. I made a thread on practicing a while ago and here it is if you need some more help on this: <a href="http://www.skateboard-city.com/some-tips-on-practicing.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.skateboard-city.com/some-tips...</a><br>  <br>  5 Watch skate videos. <br>  Watching skate videos whether you think so or not will help you a lot. Professional skateboarders didn't get to be pros for no reason. They're good at skating whether you believe it or not. Skateboarding videos will teach you a lot, I'm not saying you should imitate thier style though. Style is a unique trait that each person needs to develop on thier own. But you should watch pros to see how they do tricks and for tips and things like that. Also for pure enjoyement. Think of it this way, a Journalist or writer doesnt get better by not exposing themselves to other media. They read! That's what you need to do with videos.<br>  <br>  So basically, these five tips were just a few ways that you can get better, obviously you need to do a lot more than just whats on this list but this is just a reference of things. I hope this helps, but as I said it was brief so I hope somebody got something out of this. In short, just remember:<br>  <br>  -Skate with people better than you.<br>  -Skate outside your comfort zone.|`|7MNUFcpMaa	you could go to a friend that skateboards and ask him/her if they can help you out<3 and if it works write me at maryjanebiddle@yahoo.com

ZAh8CEoGaa	No it's not. It was games played at the same day I don't know why you would think about that. What did Kobe scored when LeBron score 55 Points 5 Rebounds 9 AssisstS?|`|uxregJ0faa	Kobe is better. Really you dont really need to defend him|`|tzrLDbHWaa	Not really. I mean if you want to use this as proof Kobe is better then a LeBron fan can use anytime LeBron has more points as proof he's better, and since LeBron is averaging more ppg than Kobe, they could also say that LeBron has been better the whole season.  It doesn't really work that way.  One game, one stat, etc isn't what makes one player better than the other, its their whole game.  <br>  <br>  Not for nothing, but are you that insecure over Kobe's ability that you feel you need to prove something after every game?  I'm not saying that I don't agree Kobe is a better player, I'm just saying that its really a weak arguement.|`|2db7f31f8de2a63df2848a630426eea7aa	Yes the games on Feb. 26 2009 officially proves Kobe is better than LeBron.|`|WLXFAeSnaa	No!! During last night's game, LeBron didn't play the fourth quarter at ALL, and he 30 points, 14 rebs, and 4 assists.|`|NxKjrz7xaa	lebron can only dunk, kobe soooooooooooooooooooooo much better|`|PjFLDSmdaa	Haha wow one game? Let's look at the SEASON stats.<br>  <br>  I'm not saying LeBron is the better player. But your argument is really weak. LeBron's MVP this season. Kobe still has the edge on whose better overall, but LeBron has outplayed him this year.|`|4gJTpitraa	Yes, because a one game comparison decided who is better than the other...The Suns also play absolutely NO defense.<br>  <br>  Kobe is still better anyway.|`|GY3QTszgaa	dirk is better than them both
57edf00d97af522b314c33475bf1e853aa	Definitely.<br>  Just cos I'm a Rangers fan doesn't mean i support England...never would never will.<br>  <br>  SNP for me x|`|bTNxl0ohaa	Yes and no.  I can see good points in independance but i also see why it may not be such a good idea.  I voted SNP last time, but mainly as they adopted almost all of Sheridan's proposals (free lunches, local taxation etc)<br>  <br>  For a start, oil.  We have europe's biggest oil reserves off our coastline.  Giving up being part of the union removes any chance of making money from it.  So we cant live off that.  If we had the oil ourselves then it would be a tremendous boost to our economy to begin independance before it runs out - sadly that isnt going to happen.  The rest of the UK arent going to give it up.  And it isnt going to last forever anyway, so it will have little relevance in 100 years time.<br>  <br>  Is it really worth going through the costly exercise of independance?  It would cost billions to implement.  Although we have already our own health service, schools and so on, we would still have to consider the army (current and future), customs and immigration, welfare state etc.<br>  <br>  Id rather see that money used to improve Scotland now than to spend getting our own independance.  A hike in taxes just to have the quality of service we have now?<br>  <br>  In the union - we have a say in Scottish matters, and in Westminster.  We would have to apply to join the EU as an independent nation, which would mean no/little say in the running of our own country.  We couldnt afford not to be part of the EU either, as we would most likely have to adopt the Euro as our currency.  The rest of the UK would then have more say in laws being passed in our country than we do.  Thats really independent isnt it?<br>  <br>  There is a global recession at the moment and that alone makes it a risky thing to want to do.  World economies are struggling and for a small nation with the inevitable higher taxes than England, Northern Ireland and Wales, we arent likely to be able to attract foreign investment or trade, so that would most likely mean recovering from the recession would take us longer and put us further at a disadvantage.<br>  <br>  Dont get me wrong - id love an independant Scotland.  But the Union of Scotland and England has done us no harm and we are a stronger nation for it.  <br>  <br>  It wouldnt improve the quality of life of people in Scotland - in fact it would have the opposite effect - so why would it be worth it?|`|LoFCv31waa	For more than 15 years I used to.

He gives people all the more incentive to hate the Cowboys; not as if they need it.<br>  <br>  The media would hate to see Owens go, however.

Y4mz8BShaa	No Crosman airsoft gun, except for the AirMag C11, is worth it. Overpriced plastic, inside and out. I can't tell you whether or not the gears are plastic, but the gearbox is, and it's going to crack eventually. Quite easily. You don't even need to abuse airsoft gun with a PGB to destroy them. they do it all on their own. It at least has an M100, so it won't die nearly as fast as the R76.|`|AfNeQxOfaa	its ok, i wouldnt recommend it thought just cuz i dont really like it.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.hitguns.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.hitguns.com/</a> look there for all your airsofting needs.

Have a whatever kind of attitude and say it is no big deal to people around you. Then you are forced to act cool about it and you will do it because of peer presure. Once you do it, you will be fine.|`|edzU8VJiaa	I presume you are having swimming lessons at school, where they are expecting you to jump in?<br>  <br>  Don't panic.  Can everyone else do it?

If you've done it right, you won't drown or be noticed by anyone else.  Only you & your friend will know.<br>  <br>  Once you've done it, you'll find it's easy.<br>  <br>  If you haven't got a friend to help, then you need to ask your parent/s to take you swimming & help you to get over this.|`|4bzZNCYBaa	You can't run away from your fears. One day (preferably soon), just tell yourself 'Today is the day'. DO NOT change your mind. GRIN AND BEAR IT!!! Close your eyes and jump in. Ask a friend to do it with you and at the same time. YOU CAN DO IT!!!!!!!!!!|`|aVSHsX2Faa	don't jump in the shallow end of the pool as you can end up hurting yourself if you end up hitting your feet of the bottom.

Its just one of those things you can get over once you've done it. I couldn't bring myself to do it so my swimming instructer pushed me in!

t6sDVUI4aa	Hunting as a conservation management tool controls the amount of surplus animals feeding on the given food source. So while it will ensure that a proper amounts of each generation, and each sex are feeding on the food. In all reality I read peta articles as most people read comedy. PETA is funny in their misinformation and complete lack of common sense.|`|wphUIz0naa	What hunting does actually is increase the HEALTHY deer population. When any species becomes over populated usually it either runs out of food or a disease sets in. In either instance the vast majority of the animals die. Hunting keeps populations in check so that this situation is prevented. <br>  PETA and other groups like this will say anything to sway your opinion to match their own. Usually they really have no desire to "come to an understanding" and care very little for the rights and ideas of others even if these ideas are fact based.|`|1jmXT4Vvaa	I'll agree.  Do you have any idea how much money is used from hunting licenses to manage and protect wildlife habitat.  Do you have any idea how many millions of dollars hunters have contributed through their licenses over the years.  I strongly feel that's why the animals numbers are at an all time high, more habitat.  And most of it was paid for by hunter's dollars.  Next time you see wildlife, thank a hunter.|`|H4dswqRlaa	Ever since we screwed up nature by removal of predators, the deer depend upon us to arrange to take just the right number each year.

Smaller deer require less food.|`|zFsBCsiCaa	haha, it doesn't, don't listen to those wackjob propagandists|`|92jr44kFaa	PETA<br>  <br>  People<br>  Eating<br>  Tasty<br>  Animals<br>  <br>  Also known as the "Shallow end of the gene-pool"|`|XtUWmTJVaa	Short answer: NO!<br>  <br>  However, as has been pointed out already, careful game harvesting of older animals does allow younger ones to prosper.  The "fact" that it is environment management due to hunters that have caused the deer population to explode is pure nonsense.  Most weekend hunters would strip an area clean of any wildlife if they were allowed to for the sheer joy of shooting something.  Those are the ones that give subsistence hunters bad names.  The real reason the deer (and other prey) populations are so large around human habitats is because humans have a tendency to scare away or kill all the predators.  C'mon Travis, that answer as almost as bad as PETA's initial claim that was being asked about here!|`|SC54ddqKaa	PETA is weird and they are extremists.<br>  Deer naturally reproduce. PETA is trying to say deer reproduce BECAUSE of hunting.<br>  Deer naturally have one or two babies. PETA is trying to tell us that two fawns is BECAUSE of hunting and that none and maybe one is the norm. In fact, they call two fawns "twins" like it's as rare as humans to have twins. <br>  Deer may or may not migrate depending on food where they are at, and I'm sure other reasons. PETA is trying to tell us that they migrate BECAUSE of hunting. <br>  The bottom line is that PETA is against hunting. They will do and say anything to try to stop it. They are basically taking things that deer do naturally and blaming it on hunting, like it wouldn't occur otherwise.|`|Q66wfD61aa	Hunting increase the population, what?...wait I'm not surprised if it's from those nutty peta's. but hunting MAINTAINS the deer population.|`|h8cCcQG1aa	Keep surfing on websites maybe you'll find you answer...we need people like you to increases the population...LOL|`|OrvTG44laa	No, it doesn't.  It keeps the population in order, though.|`|8ivnzNi5aa	I wish I could remember where I read this, but it seems that when Teddy Roosevelt was president, he actually banned deer hunting in an area of Arizona called the Kaibab Plateau.  Within a few short years, the deer population doubled, then collapsed due to food shortages.<br>  <br>  Regarding the idea that hunting increases deer populations, this perception may be spread because deer are leaving areas in which they may be hunted to go to areas where they can't.  Here's a case in point:  A few years ago, the commercial airport nearest to where I live (Cherry Capital, Traverse City, MI) had a problem with deer roaming the airport grounds and getting on the runways. .I think they had to call in a professional sharpshooter to get them all.  (There's a job for you!)|`|X2ZsYRNWaa	Hunting keeps the population to a low enough level that it will not be devistated by disease or starvation.  So the are right but they don't go into the details because not hunting would mean large numbers of deer dieing slow painfull death rather than a few dieing quick ones.  Plus large tracks of land would be stripped bare by all the deer before the population crashed.|`|AA11694178	That sure doesn't sound like PETA.  They usually allege that hunting DEcreases the various animal populations rather than INcreasing them.  Here is the way it works.  Hunters control the herd by harvesting deer each year.  If these deer were not harvested, the herd would multiply to a level that could not be supported by the land and food available.  About this time, because of the weakened condition of the herd, diseases start spreading, starvation sets in and you have a catastrophic collapse of the herd.  In addition to providing a means of controlling the herd, hunters, through the various taxes and license fees, provide the money to not only buy more land for animal habitat, but provide the funds to provide for the protection of those animals and the enforcement of game laws.  By so doing, the various game animals are flourishing today.  They are held to controlled populations and kept healthy by the various state game management programs.  Failing to properly manage game populations results in a lower population and less healthy animals.  This is not opinion , it is fact that is supported by all of the game biologists in every state.|`|LWzrCu5caa	If you reduce the number of wolves, coyotes, cougars and bears by hunting then yes, the deer population would go up.  <br>  <br>  That is the logic that Alaska is using in killing off some of the wolves,  with the plan of increasing the size of moose and caribou herds.   <br>  <br>  That is probably what PETA is talking about. <br>  <br>  But hunting deer will only reduce the population.|`|6pUzzsuhaa	the answer is yes and now<br>  <br>  yes because the older deer are usually taken which means that as they get older, they are not as good as they used to be- they cannot digest and absorb what they need to survive with, so that creates a "place" for new deer, and the younger deer will produce healthier offspring, and twins are not that uncommon in deer either, so the younger the doe is, the more she'll fawns she'll give birth to compared to an older doe, and a younger buck will be able to breed more does than an older buck would (and when i talk about an older deer, i mean older as in they cannot 'live' as well as they did when they were younger). also, by having younger deer, their genetics will be newer, which will get more DNA combos in the area, so that will create a healthier deer, if the right deer breed<br>  <br>  and no, because in some places over-hunting is not uncommon- in some places, like where i live, you can harvest 12 deer (i'm purdy sure its does) and removing that many deer (in the specific area where i live) is not a good idea because the deer population couldn't handle it, so that would cause an increase in the deer population<br>  <br>  <br>  simply saying- its ALL about PROPER deer herd management|`|HMgDJ8EEaa	omg dont listein to anything PETA says<br>  they have no common sence what so ever

One, Odds are Brad Lidge won't be perfect this year. Two, J.C. Romero was one of their best releivers and He's Suspended for 50 games. The Phillies strikeout Very Much. The Phillies Have 4 players that will produce for offense, While the Mets have 5. Jose, Reyes, Carlos Beltran, David Wright, Carlos Delgado, and Ryan Church. He was the Mets M.V.P. until his concussion. Injuries limited him. The Phillies Have Ryan Howard, Chase Utley, Raul Ibanez, And Jimmy Rollins. Cole Hamels had a 3.09 E.R.A. Johan Santana had a 2.53 E.R.A. And the Mets Aquirred Record Setting Francisco Rodriguez, and one of the best closers in the game, J.J. Putz. They also got rid of their worst relivers, Aaron Heilman, Scott Schoenweis, And many more. So the way I see it, the Mets are a better team than the Phillies, and they will win the division by my standards.|`|xd0sTRlwaa	They will do alright.  Adding K-Rod and Putz should help bolster their bullpen, and of course, Wright - Reyes - Delgado - Beltran are there to provide some offense.  Also, you look to have a good starting core: Santana, Maine, etc...|`|hv8ytdaoaa	They will do better this season after making several moves to help the bullpen that struggled mightily the second half last season|`|NbNoQFZVaa	I think the Mets will win the division with a 93-69 record|`|Iv2N0brNaa	lol a i think the mets will win the world series and can u give me the 10 points now|`|5jmdzqYgaa	They will loose.

Hope he has a good season like the beginning of last year<br>  Murphy- I really think he can have a break out year<br>  Schneider- hell have another average year for himself<br>  (pitchers spot)<br>  <br>  Santana- He could get up 25 wins<br>  Pelf- Will start to follow like santana id say with about 15th<br>  Ollie- Hoping he can shopw what his money worth, maybe he can get 15 too<br>  Main- Will be around a 500 pitcher<br>  (Were not sure whos #5 yet!)<br>  <br>  The pen is strong in the 8 and 9th now too ! <br>  <br>  I think we have enough for a playoffs team :D|`|NG6eeCfuaa	Another playoff miss this season, the shakeup comes. If they miss the playoffs again, the young talent goes. You can print and save this if you'd like, but mark these words:<br>  <br>  Mets miss playoffs, either David Wright or Jose Reyes get traded for about 14 prospects. Akin to the Hershel Walker deal with the Cowboys back in the 1980's.

2db7f31f8de2a63df2848a630426eea7aa	Regular season doesn't tell the story. Sure, the Lakers have been winning without him, but they have had a few close games with some mediocre teams. Without Bynum Laker's defense can not be at its best. <br>  <br>  You can feel the effect of losing Bynum in playoff series. Its a whole different story, but it looks like Andrew will be back by then, and that will be a big boost for the Lakers.|`|WLXFAeSnaa	I'll have to go with yes on this one|`|8c150d798507c1b0ae472762150207b6aa	What up RSG,<br>  <br>  The Lakers have been impressive without Bynum.  And part of it has been the improved play of Lamar Odom.  i think the question becomes when Bynum comes back will Odom continue to play at the level he is playing at - or will he revert back to old Lamar.<br>  <br>  Lamar has been more productive than Bynum was. But we must also keep in mind that the Lakers have shown this year- that they can play any style- and the only style that seems to be able to beat them in a 7 game series in the playoffs is being rough with them (which the Lakers seem to have stepped up in that category) and is an area where Bynum might be as tough as anyone the Lakers have- so he gives them something in that area- which they lacked last year.  <br>  <br>  The Lakers have done it in a couple of regular season meetings versus Boston and Cleveland but a 7 game series is different- so i think they will need Bynum for the playoffs.  <br>  <br>  Heck the way the Lakers are playing right now- bringing Bynum off the bench till he gets back to par- isn't going to make them weaker.  <br>  <br>  So the Lakers are definitely better without Bynum as long as they play with the same urgency they have been playing with in recent games.<br>  <br>  Nickster|`|i2nCISQtaa	LAKERS ARE #1..with or without bynum<br>  <br>  CELTICS SUCK!! if you're a LAKER hater you have no business in a LAKER question|`|a112fa2d0ccf1099eec1119d4da5e902aa	No.  Bynum is their only legit center.

They can do good in the regular season and get the best record and all, but come playoff time, and especially Celtic playoff time, we need him. I still feel we could have won last finals, but odom was too soft and under playing, the bench was, and Kobe didn't show the leadership that they needed. So as a team, they couldn't get it done. But uh...this year it's no excuse and they have no choice but to get the "Ship"! Kobe should also get MVP as well as the lakers getting 1st place in all the NBA as well as hopefully winning 70 games.|`|GY3QTszgaa	NO bynum brings toughness, he adds more size and makes them deaper bcuz odom would come of the bench. he is an inside defensive pressence which would have helped against boston in the finals. he's athletic. having him and gasol down on the block at the same time causes teams way to much trouble bcuz its pick your poison. he also adds a plus in rebounding. the lakers are better with him by far.|`|cypNCoh3aa	Of course not.

1jmXT4Vvaa	Depends.  If you never shoot over 300 yards with a rifle, you don't need one.  I hunt pretty open spaces here in Montana, so it can be a good idea.  The new ones from Leupold are very nice.  Keep in mind that a 1500 yard rangefinder will actually only range to about 700 yards, a 1000 yard model to 500.  Some have a program on them to tell you how many clicks to adjust your scope for holdover.  You can also go to one of the ballistics calculators on the internet and make a laminated card with the holdovers at certain distances.  It takes a lot of the guess work out of long range shooting.  It is no substitute for practice, though.  I feel that most bowhunters should use them.  With bow hunting, poor range estimation is probably the number one reason for wounded or missed game.  But if you are strictly rifle hunting with a decent velocity round, you really don't need them for any shots under 300 yards.|`|Ucbnl7VJaa	I misplaced mine between shooting varmints this summer and this falls deer season but I usually use it during deer season mostly to verify my range estimation practice or if I spot a deer at what I feel is beyond about 250yds and have time I use it to know precisely where I need to hold for a proper hit.<br>  <br>  After narrowing the choices down to those that are waterproof, I'd look for one that will read out to at least 800yds(they base it on fairly reflective surfaces) or more. Always nice to have a scan feature so it keeps reading as you move along with the target. One that's almost a requirement in western Oregon is a rain setting to ignore scattered random returns. I had a Bushnell 800 (Scout or Sport, can't remember which) several years old and it worked well. That one even had a >150 mode for use if you were in a treeline looking out or through a close range strip of brush to only register returns from over 150 yards.<br>  <br>  <br>  -edit- Umm RDG since when has any kind of rangefinder been restricted in hunting? Or are you confusing laser rangefinder with laser sight?|`|PcOEPKfIaa	lazer  ranger are nice for all types of hunting bow, rifle and pistol. there not a fix for not practicing your shots. but are very useful tool. i hear the lazers are all about the same, but differ more in the quality of the lenses . glass and or plastic, nitrogen filled and size. i like the small Nikons for bow hunting.|`|8ivnzNi5aa	If they 're legal where you live, go ahead and use one.  You'll want a large digital readout and as good an accuracy guarantee as you can get.  If it takes a common type of battery (such as a C,D, AA, AAA, or 9V), that's even better.<br>  <br>   Chris, I'm just guessing about their legality.  This guy is in Canada, after all.|`|XNpnK4vpaa	A Laser range finder is a nice tool to verify the distance to a target or game animal.<br>  <br>  It should have a good eye-relief.  If you wear eyeglasses, be sure it will be compatible with them.  Try before you buy.<br>  <br>  Bushnell, Leupold, Nikon and Leica would be some good brands to consider.
0Ub8hoN6aa	Chester Taylor is amazing, he would be a starter/split back on pretty much any other team... he is a great blocker and runner, he makes Adrian Peterson who is already a great player/superstar into a perennial superstar... It also says a great amount about his charactor that he could be a starter on many other teams but accepts the role of 2 back and does whats better for the team rather than B**ch*ng about playing time and being a team cancer... he is a great all around player all teams would pursue him haha|`|7B9KEqCnaa	Being that my favorite team is the raiders, and we have DMC, Fargas, and Bush, no I do not want taylor.  He is a solid back but not spectacular.  If a team needed help at RB then yeah taylor would be a nice fit for someone looking for a receiving or change of pace back.|`|cdQryr7paa	Definately.<br>  He is a very good RB.<br>  He is a starter on any other team that doesn't have Adrian Peterson.|`|KZsdVGJzaa	yea i would take him. Steven Jackson and Chester Taylor would no be without a doubt the greatest tandem of All Time|`|Hgm9qaf9aa	Sure, Taylor was a 1,200 yard runner the season before Minnesota drafted Peterson.|`|YlBLz9lTaa	if i need a RB yes|`|a13b768dd41d6e9fbc8d5d241eee768aaa	But he is already on my favorite team. I think he is great the way we use him... Maybe a little more of both backs on the field though|`|JKbvnwcDaa	I would definitely give it some thought. He has proven that he can be productive, but is he too old now?
eoRx8lITaa	Puh-lease. MY little sister is 5 and can do that. Maybe she'll make it, but there's a big, huge looming chance that she won't. I help out at a gym and we train a team of competitive-level toddlers, optional-level little kids, and elite-level grade-schoolers. My sister is level 9! She came in first at nationals for cheerleading. Her competitive season hasn't started yet. I know from her practices that that's a Yurchenko, which she can do perfectly.|`|8HmULotpaa	Its called a Yurchenko layout.  It is a difficult vault for a 10 year old.  But to be good enough for the olympics takes much, much more.  Many are already elite by that age (which is far above level 8) and competing in what is called the hopes division.|`|2u3ze0Asaa	Yes. That is so nice.<br>  :) good luck for her and for your family.<br>  God bless.|`|TxdzEW13aa	It's a Yurchenko, NOT a Tsukahara. Well, it is true that there are remarkably younger girls who can perform that vault flawlessly. It also doesn't matter what she can do, it matters if she can do it well and if she chooses to apply it. I think that if she works hard (and I mean harder than EVERYONE else), she'll have a good chance at Pan Am, American Cup, World Championships, and eventually Olympic Trials.|`|bxJcxxMeaa	what she is doing is called a sukaharra or a suke (idk how 2 spell it lol) well its a great skill but not the hardest lots of people do it but if she keeps it up and sticks with gymnastics she'll have a chance of the olympics but she still has to do levels 9, 10 and elite b4 training 4 olympic team|`|bbHvhvksaa	that wasn't a suke that was a yuerchenko (im positive)
daRDQE9maa	Yes, that would be a fantastic pick up for the titans. They have a speady running back and a heck of a young plyer all in one... I think that he could really bring a spark to this team.. but hwoever i don;t think thats were he'll end up ...|`|qDBeG26Saa	yeah but they are not gonna get him<br>  they good try to trade keith bullok to get draft pick and ok wr|`|4731b4dd41ac9b63f399617325abc5d0aa	T.J. is going to the Giants we all know that!|`|42MOquw8aa	hell yeah i agree! we need to get a receiver that can make some big plays|`|KZsdVGJzaa	that would b a great pick up. One of their problems last year was their WR corp. 1 WR and they can b considered one of the elite teams this upcoming year

c2666c20df7b27c2859938d7ac3b140daa	For my first half marathon I'd never run more than 6 miles either - mostly just 4 mile training runs. I won't pretend that it was easy, but I managed it OK.<br>  <br>  I would go back to training if you can for the next 2 weeks. Perhaps during the week try to get in a couple of 7 or 8 mile evening runs (if you can do 6 miles easily then 7 miles should be OK) and this coming weekend try to do a long run of 9 miles again.<br>  <br>  The week before the half, perhaps on the monday, go on an evening 8 mile run - just as a confidence boost to show that you can really do the distance.<br>  <br>  I haven't said to do anything over 10 miles because the race will help you along for the last bit. They are the training tips I can give.<br>  <br>  For the actual race set off a bit slower than you would have done if you hadn't been ill - you can always speed up after 5 miles or so if you are feeling very good.<br>  <br>  <br>  You can do the distance and I think that a long run at the weekend will prove it to yourself.|`|AA10241450	Hi relax your should be to run your 1/2 marathon - remember to taper two weeks before your race so 11 miles should be fine for your longest distance if you wanted to test the distance.  Don't be afraid to run long distance intervals and give your self a break for instance 6 miles X 2 with rests of a few minutes by walking and stretching or 3 miles X 3.  The pace should be similar to your 1/2 marathon pace or 10K pace.  Good luck!|`|Qh2rc1DNaa	If you've run 9 miles you can totally do it.  When I did my first half marathon I'd never run farther than 5 miles in my life.  Keep training but listen to your body.  If you not to stop and rest....do it....Meanwhile make sure you are eating and drinking enough.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|tFNSPLlFaa	I would run twice a week 10 miles wednesday and 12 or more sunday at real slow pace, even stop and walk for a hundred yards every mile, give yourself plenty of time to recover after wards, take a hot bath ,massage, drink and eat well. Listen to a ipod as you go and try and find a level,soft surface, canal towpath, wood trial do this for the next 3 weeks and then rest the week before hand. One more tip,take a water bottle of sports drink or energy gels to have, dark Chocolate is really good before hand too, read Jeff Galloway he,s great on LSD long slow running, enjoy relax and you,ll be fine.|`|xAAqFvPgaa	Just go out for a run, run very slowly for around 8-10 miles try doing this 3 times a week and then another run around 5-6 miles at a fast pace, this should be enough in 3 weeks for you to be ready. Week before run 10 miles slow at beginning of week run 5 miles slow on Wednesday and go out for a 20 min jog on Thursday and then don't do anything till the race. It is defiantly possibly, remember don't go fast off the race start line start slowly and if you feel ok after around 1 mile slowly start to build up you're speed depending on how you feel.<br>  <br>  Hope all goes well above all enjoy the race!!!!

Have your child stand over the bicycle with both feet on the floor.  There should be a minimum of 1" between frame and the child's inseam.<br>  <br>  Have your child sit on the seat with his/her hands on the handlebars.  Your child should be able to, at the very least, place the ball of their feet on the ground.  This is important that they don't tip over.<br>  <br>  Your child should be able to comfortable reach the handlebars while sitting on the seat.  If he/she is barely touching the handlebars and is leaning way forward the bicycle is probably too large for her.<br>  <br>  If your child is just learning how to ride a bicycle, I would recommend a coaster type brake (the one that you peddle backward to engage the brake) instead of the handbrakes.<br>  <br>  If you are on a tight budget, be sure to check with your local craigslist.org, church bulletin boards, newspaper(s), thrift shops, flea markets, swap meets, garage sales for inexpensive bicycles.  Be sure to take a friend or family member that is knowledgeable about bicycles to avoid purchasing a faulty item.<br>  <br>  A trick that I've learned also is the push scooters, like the ones made by Razor, have helped tremendously in teaching children on how to balance.  You may want to take a look at this option as it shortened the learning curve tremendously.  Since they master how to balance with those scooters, it's a lot easier for them to transfer those balancing skills when riding a bicycle!<br>  <br>  The other option would be to go to your friendly neighborhood bicycle shop.  Most shops will be knowledgeable in what your child needs and can help with the fitting and any other accessories that you might need.

UrNVuFx6aa	Salt alone does not tan the skin. A salt-alum mixture can be used; mix 1/2 cup of pickling salt with 1/2 cup of aluminum sulfate, potash alum or ammonium alum in one gallon of water. You can also use a salt-acid mixture by combining 1 pound of salt and 4 ounces of sulfuric acid in one gallon of water.<br>  Using either mixture: immerse the fleshed skin, let it soak overnight, and the next morning remove the skin from the solution and peel off the membrane which should have loosened in the solution. Then return the skin to the solution for another 4 to 60 days, stirring it often. The tanning is complete when the skin has turned an even color. After tanning, remove the skin and rinse it very well in several changes of clean water. The acid will need to be neutralized, if used. Oil the skin and soften it by stretching it. <br>  <br>  A quicker and easier way is to brain-tan the skin. Every animal has enough brains to tan its skin. Here is a link that explains it better; I can't find my brain-tanning book right now.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kingsmerecrafts.com/page09.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kingsmerecrafts.com/page09.ht...</a><br>  <br>  You might also try to find a copy of Tan Your Hide; it has a variety of methods, and Brain Tan Buckskin (John McPherson).<br>  <br>  Happy tanning!|`|8ivnzNi5aa	I've heard of that technique, but haven't personally tried it. See If Wikipedia can tell you anything about the hide-tanning process.|`|GpFqItSvaa	this question...<br>  scares me...|`|4ybzs1Knaa	First      you skin it.<br>  Second  then make a frame and stretch the hide across it.<br>  Third      scrap all the tissue off of  it.  Until there is fresh hide only.<br>  <br>  The point is not to cut the hide.  and your tools need to be sharp.  This means finishing your knife on a hard stone.  i.e. Arkansas stone is such a stone.

CttL3LmBaa	CLR is not a natural product.  It is a blend of hydrochloric and phosphoric acids together with surfactants.  Avoid it like the plague on a bicycle.  Hydrochloric acid makes steel rust.  Phosphoric is much safer when used as a stand alone product and indeed removes rust.  Naval Jelly contains phosphoric.<br>  <br>  Now you asked about natural.  Vinegar is natural and removes rust albeit slowly.  It requires soaking and time.  Coca Cola (and Pepsi) contain enough phosphoric acid to attack rust but again it takes a long soak.  It also is more expensive than vinegar.  <br>  <br>  Mechanical means (scrubbing) include Fine (0000) steel wool.

RuJYupFWaa	Some people can't get hpa refills easily so getting an hpa tank isn't worthwhile.  If you're using co2, get the tank anti-siphoned unless you're using a remote line (which i don't recommend for speedball).<br>  <br>  Smart Parts Vibe is currently the only speedball marker designed to be used with co2.  It operates just like an Ion except it has no eyes, just a soft bolt.  Limited to 11 bps (co2 isn't ideal at faster rates of fire) & has a special regulator that vents whenever liquid co2 sneaks out of the gun or there are any pressure spikes.<br>  <br>  The Spyder Electra & Pilot (new ones have eyes) are both capable of shooting faster than the Vibe and can use co2 but they're still a little on the lower end due to the nature of their operation (sear-tripper blowbacks... have more recoil than the Vibe & more moving parts).<br>  <br>  It's possible to find some old used E-Bladed Autocockers cheap that can handle co2 without too many issues but they're not easy to find as owners aren't quick to give them up.|`|13bc7214bebe9f20a8000b9480b7b9d7aa	The best type of marker for speedball that I can think of that runs on CO2 would be a spyder with an e-frame.  I no longer know what is in production, so you will have to look into that yourself.|`|pgpryTxkaa	i would recommend the 06 spyder electra with the rocking trigger and eyes. downside on that is that some tournaments don't allow rocking triggers :/|`|xE6WXVIeaa	You can try the Blazer from palmer-pursuit.com, but they're not electric and don't have eyes.|`|RX5t6x6Haa	well first i will kudos to you for trying speedball with co2, YOU WILL find out it wont work well, and let me guess your not using an electronic hopper eighter right? LOL you truely remind me of this one kid that thought that he was better then i was at my local speedball field..<br>    just becaues i got this kids friend out in the game, this kid comes up to me and says that he's better then me!! i look at his marker and say yeah OK, your using a CO2'ed woodsball marker in speedball, and he says " yeah but i still could kick your a** out on the field" and i'm like yeah ok, lets see, how long have you been playing?" he says "1 year" i'm like yeah then your def. not gona win, cause i've been playing over 10 years, then to make a long story short, i get on a 2 VS 1 (him and his friend verus me) and i got the one off of the break even.<br>  <br>  But anyway, CO2 and speedball, wont mix well, CO2 and an electrnic marker wont work well, you'll find out one way or another...... maybe try a spyder victor? your not gona find any decent markers that will have eyes and be electronic and run off of CO2, you could try a spyder vs2,<br>  <br>  BTW you can go out and buy a new marker, but cant afford a 60 dollar HPA tank?<br>  <br>  EDIT: any field that has a speedball field WILL have HPA refills, unless its a rundown 1 star field

WTw9BSOYaa	The only problem might be the inserts burton used at the time, in the 90s they had different mounting setups, some with the 4inserts that we have today, and some with 5 or 6 inserts, they also had different designs, everything from squares to triangle type designs.<br>  <br>  So just unscrew your baseplate, and check what the style the mount is, if its simply a 4 screw mount, you will be fine. If it isnt and it is one of the different styles of inserts, fire a email off to burton, I know they have a number of different baseplates out there to retrofit for this type of reason. <br>  <br>  Id like to add that between the 98-99 era and now, a LOT has changed in board design and structure, it may not be visible, but a LOT has changed, everything from what the bases is made of, the edges, shapes, structure within the deck, types of inserts, the Camber and Rocker design. Decks from 10 years ago, dont really stand any ground next to the decks of today, so Id say go out and pick up a entirely new setup.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	take them to the pros and see if they can put new bindings on them.|`|FnDEZ811aa	f

RS3fjNboaa	That Haynesworth deal is the one that blew my mind. The redskins were reported to be $3 million over the salary cap, yet they were able to sign Hall to a long term deal AND sign Haynesworth to a ridiculous amount of money. I thought I understood the salary cap pretty well, but the more I'm watching the FA deals, the more I realize I don't understand it as much as I thought I did.|`|DjifToZgaa	Denver went nuts today.<br>  <br>  They pulled down Correll Buckhalter, JJ Arington, Jabar Gafney, and are close to deals on Dawkins and Andra Davis.<br>  <br>  Dawkins is 35 though.  He's a warrior, but with a lot of miles.  Denver should have kept Dominique Foxworth.  He just signed for huge money in Baltimore.<br>  <br>  Denver is talking to Renaldo Hill too.

d13be469790f4c6de2d7eb7872dee476aa	The Vikings won the division with Frerotte and Jackson at QB. Rosenfels isn't great, but he'll be a significant upgrade for Minnesota at their weakest position, and given their running game and defense, even if he just an average QB, that would make the Vikings a serious threat to win the Super Bowl. Remember, Rex Grossman took the Bears to the Super Bowl, and while the Vikings D isn't as good as the Bears was that year, they do have Adrian Peterson.|`|rNUyV1EYaa	Actually, Sage Rosenfels is really not all that bad of a quarterback. All he cost was a fourth round pick. And the Vikings weren't going to find a better option for that value.|`|LpR9sLSlaa	huh??????|`|knGAhlGRaa	wow its the first day of free agency/trading period<br>  <br>  <br>  infact the bears signed a former carolina tackle today<br>  <br>  4 year contract<br>  <br>  <br>  and they will get more players by sunday|`|U3KAgO0baa	At least the Vikings made a move.<br>  <br>  Did the bears do anything special?

1KT1CRE4aa	5 seems good compared to all others handed out.<br>  Also since no one has mentioned it, possibly because no one watches the Isles, it was very similar to the hit by the Devils Dman on Frans Neilsen. Neilsen deked out of his way and in an effort not to miss him the guy stupidly threw his elbow out and cost him a few months. Like Witts it was unintentional and just an instinct but it was extremely dangerous and should not go unpunished. I think that these stupid 2 3 game suspensions are bs when guys miss extended time. I dont think that the intent should be taken into effect, if it is a dangerous hit there should be a big punishment especially if someone is going to miss time because of it. I still think it was a dumb move but not dirty in the sense that Witt skated the whole way saying elbow him in the head elbow him in the head.|`|538d6b5db0aba1de26b3ce3538e543f7aa	It was an obvious cheapshot with an intent to injure...this is the kind of stuff that the league should focus on...not fighting...fighting has a place in the game...this stuff doesnt. Typical brenden witt, and typical islanders hockey...they cant fight fairly...always have to sneak up from behind with a cheapshot. I think it should've been a longer suspension.|`|ipBgbzqSaa	Not long enough.  Gary Bettman swears up down and sideways that they will be cracking down on unnecessary blows to the head.  And yet again and again he proves to be an incompetent jerk who doesn't know hockey from shuffleboard.|`|isjkqwnUaa	Yeah, 5 is long enough|`|XQoH9ZI5aa	I think Colin Campbell does a pretty good job at handing out punishment. He factors in everything and usually gets it right IMO.|`|0KVbh5Qqaa	you know what...i think it is...being a ranger fan myself, nothing seems to be going right for new york hockey at the moment.  it was a dirty hit, but if simon got 30 games or whatever for what he did, i think it was fair.  I dont really think he did that purposely.   give the "soon to be" kansas city cornhuskers a break|`|AA11674745	Ehhhhhh, I guess so - especially in today's National Ice Capades League. Hell, I do worse every time I tune myself with the refrigerator door.<br>  <br>  But, I know I don't have to tell you Joe that if Brendan Witt played for a team with say.....oh.....orange and black for it's colors, they'd be clamoring for a year-long suspension.|`|ViB84hYzaa	Make it 10 games at least. 5 games for the head shot and the other 5/5+ for the out of the way cheapness/intent and elbow and the time Hagman is out now. An easy way to get the players attention with a longer suspension right away.|`|yHvh7tFlaa	5 games is probably right, maybe 7. After all, it's not like he got away with slew-footing a goaltender and knocking him out of action with a high ankle sprain for 4 weeks just so his team could make the playoffs.|`|ROWSzTknaa	Elbow to the head? Intent. A longer suspension.
rNUyV1EYaa	Agreed. Jeff George had one of the best arms ever in the NFL. From a physical standpoint, George had as much talent as any quarterback that ever played the game. <br>  <br>  But like you said, he lacked great leadership qualities and at times was selfish. If he had the mental makeup of Peyton Manning, Jeff george would have been an incredible player.|`|UoT86gbiaa	No.  I would, however, agree that he had a cannonball for a head.|`|yuGhmhGuaa	Maybe, but once they started cannon testing, he tested positive and it was all over|`|33f4c852804fa42db9a7cbb912480080aa	Yeah...Cannon for a right arm...Too bad for his entire career he had the same aim Brett Favre had the past 2 years...|`|4KTe107Yaa	YES HE DID <br>  But that was all he could do was throw it deep. At least 10 times a game|`|ghUm8M3laa	No.  Jeff George did not have ecclesiastical law for a right arm.  He had a very strong right arm but that strength was not based on any divine power gained from his arm being part of a body of rules established by a religious council.  It was strong but at the end of the day it was just an arm.|`|sCOg8O1maa	I agree that Jeff George had a cannon arm.  He was a great pure passer.<br>  <br>  But he also had a loose cannon personality, and that isn't what you want in a QB.|`|DlLrqKAFaa	Yes. He was incredibly underrated as a quarterback.|`|JEn54VIpaa	i thought it was the left one?|`|TGrObqWzaa	yes|`|Vyz5YnZqaa	I agree, he could put the ball on a string for 50 yards.

aYVPZjLVaa	To some extent yes, but since you have other extracurriculars it shouldn't matter. Colleges are basically looking for someone who is involved and has things they are passionate about.

9Izy4meLaa	I'm a high school coach, and yes, it's certainly competative, so of course it's hard.  But the other answers are right---it is fun, too.

Everybody's not gonna make fun of you just because you don't know how to play. In fact, the coach will teach you how to play during the 1st couple days of tryouts. Itz definitely fun, you should do it. My advice before you tryout, get in shape. Make sure you can run at least 1 mile without getting out of breath. That will help a lot. It really depends on your coach though, so good luck!

UoT86gbiaa	They've gone into all-out rebuilding mode and they're in a very tough division.  While a few teams last season were able to turn things around quickly with a new coach and/or QB, that's the exception rather than the norm.  It's not likely that Tampa will be competitive for the next two years, at least.|`|0eFSeap5aa	They are going through the turnover in personnel every sports team faces, it's not like the stadium got hit by a meteor or something.<br>  <br>  They have a solid offensive line and a good secondary.  Rudd is a fine linebacker, and despite the departure of Mr June and Mr Brooks they have some depth at that position.  The Bucs have a couple good tight ends and just added another.  <br>  <br>  They need a dominant defensive tackle, a bruising running back, a quarterback and a couple wide receivers.  By the end of free agency they could have all of those, certainly the draft will help.  McCown or Johnson might yet prove to be good quarterbacks, neither has really taken the field yet to prove their stuff, so that's an unknown.  <br>  <br>  And if you think this is bad, you missed the early years of the Bucs, the play sucked, the owner sucked, and the uniforms were a bit fruity for a football team named for pirates.<br>  <br>  Tampa has a great stadium, great training facilities, and league's most gorgeous cheerleaders.  It ain't all bad.|`|lrJN4M49aa	Not really an ageing defense , no decent quarterback or runningback.<br>  Your best bet is to draft well and maybe a free agent or two but I would expect for at least two years of garbage football. Chucky pretty much ran that team into the ground.|`|daRDQE9maa	I do think that they indeed can turn it around. I'm not exactly for sure which guy your talking about with Baylor guy.... But I do beleive that they can turn this around... I extremely beleive in defensive coordinator Jim Bates.. I really like his defensive scheme bump and run and make the quarter back hang on to the football... doing that I think 2 of our  de ends will really sprout in Greg White and Gaines Adams.I think they both will be great pass rushing defensive ends.. especially in the bump and run that he runs... Plus as for them not having a quarterback. They have Brian Greise which mind you they have indeed succeeded with him at the helms before..and me as a hard core bucs fan i firmly believe in McCown. I think that when he has gotten the opertunity to play he has played well i beleive that he threw for 300 yards in the game he got to play in last year and started.. i'm firmly behind this kid... I also think that Kellen Winslow will be a heck of a player and any quarter back will be able to find him and/ or Antonio Bryant... The offensive line was pretty steller last year no losses there...  I say they draft Darius Hayward- bay from Maryland to fill and help on offense to.. they should have a rather good offense if not a really good one.. note they still have two runningbacks and could probley get another...I think that releasing Derrick Brooks wasn't a good idea but its a lil too late to replenish that so i say they fill in the holes on defense.. at defensive tackle and a de end and now a couple linebackers that can compete for the starting job and whoever comes out on top will be good enough to stand up and be a player on defense... He won't be no Brooks but he should be good enough.... There for they should be able to be a playoff contender this year... atleast wild card....|`|Hgm9qaf9aa	No. At least not anytime soon.|`|TGrObqWzaa	maybe if they get mike vick|`|t0tpnholaa	well they just got Winslow :'( so that a boost they really need to boast their offense though especially at QB|`|1a0819cd4ab89828a8e3e018d550d6e5aa	no, but the rams might if we don't draft no heart Andre Smith

ZyfYh4vdaa	El Duque (Orlando Hernandez) use to throw a 50 mile an hour curve which when he used it, he was successful|`|V430UrvFaa	Another word for slowball might be called in baseball "a breaking ball" or an "off speed ball". These pitches are grouped as Change ups, curve ball, knuckle curve, and the knuckler. These pitches are tough to gauge by the hitter and are a special strikeout pitch.|`|cypNCoh3aa	Depends what you mean by "slowball."  There are a number of pitches that are grouped under the umbrella term, "off-speed pitches."  There are many pitchers that don't use the fastball as their number one pitch.  There are even some starting pitchers that use nothing but a knuckleball and a very weak fastball.  (Tim Wakefield is the most notable current knuckleballer, with a fastball that barely reaches 85.)|`|0KVbh5Qqaa	there really is no such thing as a slowball.  Theres a change up which just mixes up the speed.  Its better then breaking balls  (curveball, splitter, slider, etc.) because it doesnt put the amount of strain on your elbow.  Im sure there have been a couple good pitchers that didnt throw too hard.  Its all about confusing the batter and keeping him off guard.|`|AA10547800	Yes alot of pitchers have done well with there off speed pitch, most pro players are used to hitting a fast pitch so when one comes over the plate alot slower it tends to throw them off.|`|fKAnnQeWaa	Just ask Tim Wakefield and his Knuckler

Brady had a goo dteam around him, thats why he has won as many super bowls has he had.<br>  <br>  As well as that...you don't put a guy (Meaning Favre) who owns every passing record in the book, won a super bowl with Wide Recievers who don't even compare to Brady's and say Brady is better and say Favre is a C+.<br>  <br>  Your list fails and you need to learn football all over again because you have just shown me you know NOTHING.|`|i6AjweWBaa	come one dude. you have to give favre an A+ for leadership. and at least a B for footwork. his abilty to roll out of the pocket and improvise was amazing.<br>  <br>  ______________________________________...<br>  <br>  are you fuckin high? your saying Mcnabb is better then Favre?<br>  ______________________________________...<br>  <br>  Im not saying just this past season im talking about the past 5 seasons.<br>  ______________________________________...<br>  <br>  who cares what foot he throws off as long as it works? yeah favre didnt fit the the mold for the standard QB. but he was a great player.<br>  <br>  ______________________________________...<br>  <br>  yeah manning also has a beastly offensive line.<br>  <br>  ______________________________________...<br>  <br>  dude. your crazy.|`|Ch9TedMcaa	Joe Montana- nuff said.|`|7RziqsDcaa	Definately not Brady.

Jg0l2ijwaa	VC has a lot of attitude problems, I live in Canada and watched his last games with the Raptors, he just basically gave up.  At the end of  a close games against the Sonics he mouthed out the team's play out of the timeout to Ray Allen.  He tell reporters that he doensn't enjoy dunking and will not dunk anymore.  He is talented but I would never want him in my team, he is not someone that a team want to have when going through adversities.  Also before game 5 against the Sixers (5 game series in 1st round at that time) Carter skip practice and leave the team to attend his Graduation Ceremony in N.C..  And yes, in a game last season, he slap Morris Peterson and Peterson retaliate and got toss fromt he game, Carter got away with it.  The ref did apologize to Peterson a day later, after he saw the tapes.  Carter just don't have any class and do not take basketball serious engouh, thats why he will never be successful in the playoffs and the Raptors will take out the Nets.|`|b924ca2b28839033b9fe84345022b3b7aa	cause hes arrogant, did u see him slap his former raptor teamate in the face ? and he got away with it<br>  <br>  <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=QwKy_N2TzEA" rel="nofollow">http://youtube.com/watch?v=QwKy_N2TzEA</a>|`|6811d8da0b0d2ff23c4efb239eab0f9eaa	on the court vince carter can be a handful but i've personally gotten his autograph during a game vs portland and he asked for my name and wrote some good things...maybe you caught him in a bad time or somethin, maybe they lost...if he wasn't in the NBA he'd be a pianist....i mean that doesn't say he's a good person but i wouldn't go as far as a jackass..he's a good player and he wants people to know that...|`|Xq9XvOYnaa	no

cc5048b4f2837724d3c5c3f1ac523005aa	The moves are "staged". The punches are supposed to either miss or barely touch, but they can be misjudged and land hard. The slams are meant to have only gravity causing the person's descent and angled to cause a softer blow, but that also doesn't work correctly at times. While this type of wrestling is "fake", as with all stunts there is some physical risk involved and some punishment to the body.|`|a613e50b628c2f41e1c32d0f419117c2aa	how can something like the last ride be fake? they really come down hard. but wrestling school shows them the best way to fall and take impacts. have you ever felt a wrestling ring floor? it is really hard.|`|56a75992b38cb1b186ebe58723c9f08baa	the only punches and slams that are real are accidents. its all fake but some time they goof up and actually hit someone or drop one and slam them then they are mad as hell about that.|`|0fddf4361ea208aa0cefa7b49cbf8f71aa	MOST OF THE MOVES ARE FAKE OR DONE IN A WAY NOT TO CAUSE INJURY OR PAIN OR DONE IN A WAY SO IT HURTS BUT NOT AS MUCH AS IT LOOKS|`|3a16ad597909ecade2acaaaaac386b98aa	Yes, you are right.|`|e9601f3e7bb0e408b3b5dd63d998f183aa	The punches are defiantly fake.So are there kicks.Once in a while they have a real fight but its on accident.|`|4725e525508a132ffba5771819884ddbaa	yes the punches r fake, and yes the slams r real. they r trained to be slammed so that it dosent seriously hurt your back. but lets face it. being slammed on your back by a 300lbs man is still gonna hurt. even if its done right, and even if the mat is nice and bouncy.

Otros cambios incluyen una regla que fuerza a los pitchers a entregar una pelota dentro de 12 segundos (hacia abajo de 20) con nadie en la base y para bateadores para mantener un pie en la caja del bateador mientras se encuentra en su posición de bateo. Esas reglas, que tuvieron vigencia en las menores el a?o pasado, llevan una pena de una pelota (para el pitcher) o un strike (para el bateador). También, los juegos que termina con una cuenta empatada ahora serán reasumidos, antes que repetidos completamente.<br>  <br>  Salu2|`|d0424701031c4b65dc4409265d7d4059aa	la unica regla nueva podria ser q no se permita q jueguen cuvanos  en la mlb|`|6c96eb5d0f97d6fc7c509db0f97c5536aa	Es mentira la MLB no a reportado ningun cambio en reglas de Juego, las que posiblemnte te has enterado son de las condiciones de dopaje|`|Efh3Ti0Uaa	la verdad que hay grandes jugadores cubanos y si esa es la regla no creo que ya interese la Mlb

Entiendo que hay jugadores mas jovenes y muy talentosos que pueden jugar en esa posicion en los Yankees pero no creo que el valor de Bernie Williams halla bajado tanto en el mercado, supongo que lo que hara sera esperar una propuesta que le convenga en Grandes Ligas porque asi como no me lo imagino en los Yankees tampoco me lo imagino en Japon|`|193be1615284e20cbdfc0666332675b2aa	sino regresa con los yankee debe retirarse|`|4y6p8VCxaa	desgraciadamente el beisbol no tiene memoria y bno deja de ser un negocio mas para el due?o de los yankees bernie e un gran jugador pero de edad avanzada la verdadno creo que regrese a los yankees va buscar primero otroequipo en mlb o uno en japon como segunda opcion bye|`|d0424701031c4b65dc4409265d7d4059aa	se va ir a japon ya me lo dijo|`|dfeb208ca1ab828fcbbe5e1e36e62df2aa	Pues por los comentarios que leí, todo gira a que no volverá y el destino es incierto.

Hay 4 outfielders por delante de el: Bobby Abreu, Jhonny Damon, Hideki Matsui y Miguel Cabrera en la banca, hubiese cabido como designado, pero el designado este a?o lo es Jason Giambi. No tiene espacio para estar en el equipo.<br>  <br>  Aun que ha sido un excelente jugador, que es quien mejores números posee (tanto en RBI como en HR) en toda la historia de la postemporada; ya sus condiciones no son las mismas. El podría irse a un equipo como: Pittsburgh, Texas, Marlins, San Diego, que toman este tipo de peloteros para ser un 7mo. u octavo bate y pueda ayudar a crecer a todos los que vienen subiendo.|`|f34161eaed1f941a13d3f17dc709490aaa	Quizá pase lo que pasó con Frank Thomas algunos equipos lo despreciaron, no le dieron un contrato por 500 MIL y jugó con los Atléticos, rindió mucho y ahora vale 8.000.000 para los Azulejos.<br>  Bernie se ve un buen tipo ojala y tenga suerte.

0Dm3WEMcaa	Batista has been gone? damn i forgot i wasn't getting my weekly fill of botches, and to quote DDP.. That's a good thing! Batista as proved Raw is much better without him, he can't cut a promo he can barely wrestle and if he wasn't shoulder deep in Vince's backside he wouldn't have a job right now! Batista adds nothing to the show and they have much bigger talents on the roster... i hope he retires and doesn't come back it's better for everyone that way.|`|1z7M3Tntaa	I don't miss him either, he doesn't add anythingspecial to the product, he's a aboring wrestler and even worse on the microphone. He really should retire not saying this out of hate or anything but for his own good, can't be good getting those kind of injuries at that age.|`|ePvvGUu3aa	I don't miss him at all and as much as I respect all wrestlers, I don't mind him being gone. Raw has been better without him, which is something they need to realize. As of late, we have had some great promos, storylines, and some better matches without him. Since he's been off of Raw, the event picture doesn't really seem "main event clustered" and matches don't really seem as slow. What I'm trying to say is that the show is picking up and moving at a faster pace than when Batista is on. I mean the ratings from the past Raw's says it all. They can do better without Batista, no disrespect to him and he does get credit where credit is due.|`|j9GokH9Qaa	to be honest... i don't really care if he is there or not.. screw that! i don't even want him to return!! Ever since he got injured RAW has gotten so much better.. people like Randy Orton are finally getting that huge push without him in the way.. Orton is way better than Batistia by the way.. There isn't any room for him at the moment.. there isn't any storylines including him.. they should have him go to ECW or Smackdown or job to other superstars.. he's 40 and shouldnt ever come back|`|KIOR56r6aa	No difference. Batista is boring anyway|`|qjCl8paPaa	well with people sayiing he doesnt fit in these storylines the draft is coming in april|`|a6cb15fd4b323dbc753a289a5e6f7a87aa	I think RAW is actually better without him, now maybe when superstars come back, they will stay back for a while, at least until he comes back.<br>  <br>  Have you noticed that when a superstar comes back to face Batista (EX: John Cena) they get injured the day that they face Batista in the match against him.<br>  <br>  And really, Batista needs to lay off the roids, you can easily tell he takes steroids, idk how your veins can pop up outta your arm and be all twisty...<br>  <br>  I think the WWE would be better without him all together, I think they should fire him, and I dont care how many haters I get for saying that. If not, one day Vince Mcmahon is going to wake up one day, and find out that every superstar quit, due to injury from Batista, or scared that when they fight him they are going to get hurt by him.<br>  <br>  I kinda think he tries to hurt the superstars he faces, like he purpously injures them, to make him feel good inside. Idk bout you, but if the WWE wants to do a good thing for the superstars and the fans, FIRE BATISTA.|`|4YcZv0d7aa	I think that Batista is still a big name, but he shouldn't come back to Raw. I never really noticed he wasn't there, but now that I think about it, I don't want him back on Raw. I say let him go to ECW. This would allow ECW to get more of a fanbase and get the new wrestlers a chance at knowing what its like to wrestle the "big guys". Also, I feel that Raw and Smackdown already have enough big talent. Adding Batista to either of them would just overdue it and make any storyline worse. <br>  However, on ECW, Jack Swagger thinks he's the big fish, maybe have him start a feud with Batista. After Christian wins the title and Batista wins it from Christian. Then Swagger would, "want his title back." Just my thoughts.|`|oAjbBLDpaa	It is better. <br>  <br>  I also don't like seeing people get hurt and am glad that he had successful surgery but it's good to know that his position has been replaced (easily.)<br>  <br>  If he had stayed we wouldn't have developed Orton vs McMahons since Orton vs Batista would have been pushed while Batista also gets his eyes on the title leading up to a possible triple threat for it at Wrestlemania which Orton would be forced to carry since, in my view, Batista and Cena don't work well together.<br>  <br>  I personally think his injury was good for storylines...|`|VPeIZE3eaa	dude... if he stayed you would've gotten cena vs batista<br>   i dont hate cena, but batista can't wrestle for SH*T! He's also tired in the ring, and he sucks at promos! If you notice, you are now getting cena vs edge and hhh vs orton! yea sure things are TERRIBLE on RAW!!!!|`|05RmoBJ6aa	I have never been a fan of Batista and to be perfectly honest RAW, SmackDown, ECW, the entire WWE is a zillion times better without him.|`|d748b1f0e351eb8ea5d0385002c5f4acaa	I was actually quite happy when I heard he was injured..which is kinda bad...I've never been a fan of Batista and if he were to never come back, I would be VERY happy...|`|b5c261dfe3ee5e5442b8195afe51a0b9aa	i like him but raw is the same|`|qbEeecndaa	i didn't notice he was gone. go primo and carlito|`|U5ANBu9oaa	ive noticed that it really makes no difference wether batista is there or not. hes interchangeable with any other superstar on the roster. seriously i dont think he shud come back. i dont see room for him in the current storyline.|`|AA10576425	I think it would have made a difference if he left as a heel.. For some reason I feel faces outnumber heels right now|`|oWJU0ky4aa	I can live with him there but I love it more when hes not. I think he is stuck on himself now. I love the John Cena attitude now.He Doesn't change for anybody.|`|yl86ZQ6Daa	I like Batista but it really hasn't been any different without him there.|`|1JywgkyMaa	i've noticed he's not there,because now it's actually pretty damn watchable|`|4eQqTiYwaa	I think he may be off to smackdown at the draft or something

cA4IznZlaa	yes armstrong used to be a huge muscle man.  he was like 20-30 pounds heavier than he is now.  it was all in his chest.  he used to be a real strong sprinter and that was his team role.  he would do good in flat but get beaten on the hills.  when he got cancer and undergone chemo he lost all his body muscle.  to cope with the pain and trauma of chemo he started riding a staionary trainer.  he gaine his leg muscle back but not his upper body.  so when he got back to training he found with his smaller build he could climb hills easier since he had less to carry with the strong legs.  and thus now we have the current lance.|`|Txg9giQfaa	Yes, he was bigger.

CttL3LmBaa	Wow, and he had to really work hard to do it wrong.  It is darn near impossible to mix threads into the opposite direction and strip them without a great deal of effort.  <br>  <br>  I seriously doubt that warranty will cover improper assembly as warranties are for DEFECTS in workmanship or materials.  This isn't the case in this instance.  The pedals are marked L and R -- right?<br>  <br>  You could contact danscomp and inquire about warranty, but.... well good luck.<br>  <br>  -----<br>  EDIT:  Your story changes slightly with each additional detail.  The only scenario that would even constitute a warranty issue is if, when attempting to install the right pedal into the correct crank arm turning in the correct thread direction, one found the crank arm to have stripped threads - before forcing the pedal into said threads.  Then you would contact your seller ... and wait and wait.  The seller would contact the manufacturer ... and wait and wait.  IF  you dealt with a local bike shop they would have put the pedals on for you.  Even if you chose to install them yourself and found the above scenario, brought the bike back, they could opt for changing the crank on the spot.  Who ever you say did the work makes no difference to the warranty.  It still seems as if the installer is responsible for the damage.|`|oPbLcfKoaa	Yes. The warranty only covers defects in materials and workmanship. Unless you can show that the pedals were marked wrong or that the crank was threaded wrong you are out of luck.|`|Cl6KbcAGaa	Sorry to agree with Bob A and everyone else but even the asker of this question would likely be unqualified to properly thread the pedals on properly. Youre needing new crank arms is inevitable! No warranty will cover this one!|`|DOVbF4Piaa	So much for reading directions, stupidity is not covered under warranty.|`|z1Ury9XNaa	It's mechanic error- i doubt that would be under warranty|`|Z5xgSATSaa	This is why it is not a good idea to buy over the internet unless you are able to do your own maintenance and mechanical work on your bike.

Compare the three and you wont need less or more than the Sol by Nite Rider. <br>  There are lights that let you be seen, and those that make you seen, go for the latter to be safer!|`|PSVhBTlgaa	Ignore candlepower figures. The standard measure is lumens although candlepower is sometimes used for less powerful lights. Figures are often exaggerated. If a reputable bike lighting company claims 700 lumens it may be about 700 lumens, maybe about 600. If a cheap item sold direct from hong kong on ebay claims 900 lumens it may be 400-500.<br>  <br>  There are lights which are designed so that other road users can see you, there are lights designed so that you can see the path ahead. I say path because most lights sold are designed for off road use. Off road 500 lumens should be fine, less and you may go a little slower, more, faster. Powerful bike lights are very expensive. I bought lights worth over $200 and they were not bright enough for what I need. On road if you want to see the road surface even the brightest lights available at over $800 won't be as effective as the headlights of a car driving next to you.Off road lights may create too much glare if you ride on wet tarmac. I am one of many who made my own lights.<br>  <br>  Go to a bike forum or candlepowerforums section on bike lights.|`|CttL3LmBaa	1million!  You could hardly have enough portable energy for 1M candle power.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candlepower" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candlepower</a><br>  <br>  A standard 120 V, 100 watt incandescent light bulb emits 1500–1700 lumens.   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumens" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumens</a><br>  <br>  To further confuse things, a lot of lights (automotive for example) are rated in watts only.  Street legal low beams are 55 watts.<br>  <br>  What you need to look at is how much of what ever power of the light is projected.  The parabolic reflector of a light unit is as important as how much light is being produced.  <br>  <br>  I always try the light before I buy it, if only in the illumination of the store.  I figure if it throws a bright beam in the store at 20 feet, it is probably as bright as I need.  You can also increase the number of lights used as far as practical handle bar space permits.  I think that is why a lot of higher intensity units have 3 lights on them.

kQSSz2X2aa	It depends on the owner. Some people like them and some don't. What's more important is that the gun "fit" you properly. You'll know when you hold it weather or not the gun is right for you. It should feel like a natural extension of your hand and you should be able to reach all of the controls comfortably. <br>  <br>  You will probably want to either go to a range that rents guns and give several a try or go to a gun shop and hold as many as you can to get a feel for them. You wouldn't buy a car without test driving it or shoes without trying them on. Buying a gun is very similar.<br>  <br>  Try and keep an open mind about what you get. Just because you were originally planning on a glock/ruger/etc doesn't mean that that type of gun will appeal to you most.<br>  <br>  For the best pricing shop around and see what's available once you have a bit more specific idea of what you want.

It is considered reliable (when properly maintained and lubricated).<br>  <br>  If it meets your ergonomic requirements and fits in your budget, then it's a good selection.<br>  <br>  I suggest you take firearm safety and firearm self-defense/home-defense training courses to increase your knowedge and gain valuable experience.

Other brands to consider would be SIG Arms, Springfield Armory, Colt, Ruger, Kahr Arms, Taurus, Smith & Wesson, CZ and Beretta.|`|mFa5ZDtcaa	While I personally am not a fan of Glocks (I don't like the trigger pull or the lack of a mechanical safety) they are a very reliable handgun. When it comes to a personal defense semi-auto, you could do a lot worse. If you get one, make sure you get several extra magazines. If a new Assault Weapons Ban is passed, it will in all likelihood include a ban on magazines that hold more than 10 rounds. Get them while you can.|`|AA10240928	I have three Glocks and I like them.  But the trigger is more difficult to master compared to other guns.  I would suggest renting a Glock, XD, Sig, and a 1911.  The 1911 typically comes in 45 ACP, but the 45 is not difficult to control.|`|t6sDVUI4aa	I would say that the 9mm is a good choice, but the glocks have a funky shape in my hand and I don't like the idea of just pull the trigger. I would go for a Springfield XD if you want a plastic gun, for the grip safety. It would not do to shoot yourself in the foot. But I am not a plastic/Tupperware gun fan. I like full metal designs like the 1911 and Beretta 92 for a few reasons. 1 Saftey you either can't shoot the thing until the hammer is ****** (1911) or have a heavy trigger pull on your first shot (Beretta 92). 2 I like the feel of the metal, I know it won't fly apart on me.|`|Ucbnl7VJaa	It isn't a bad choice, I like the Glocks in general but strongly prefer my SIG/Sauer P220 as well as the P228. That said I agree with the suggestions for a medium to med-lg size double action revolver in .357 Magnum with a 4-6 inch long barrel. Still very inexpensive to shoot at the range with .38 Special.<br>  <br>  Definitely take a handgun safety/concealed carry class. Also it is a very good idea to go to a range that rents guns to shoot and try a few different models that meet your personal requirements.|`|f3f63c87e27f64c3e9f1679c165409b8aa	Great first gun.  Extremely reliable, easy to field strip and clean, lots of accessories out there if you decide to add a tactical light, lots of holsters made for Glocks also.  In the price range your looking at there ain't none better.<br>  Also, if your looking for something to use for home defense and to have fun with your dad at the range with then a Glock 17 is PERFECT.  9mm rounds are a lot cheaper than 40SW and .45's.  You won't have to take out a loan to buy a box of 9mm's.|`|KDOIKIq2aa	Glock makes a fine firearm.  They have their draw backs, but are an overwhelming success with Police Departments.  If you like it, a Glock will serve you well.  9mm is an adequate defensive round and is one of the cheaper center fire handgun rounds to shoot.|`|OYy1OmDPaa	No all autoloaders are poor choices for first time gun owner.<br>  <br>  Buy a stainless steel .357 revolver with 4" barrel.  Even when you inevitably don't read the manual you probably won't shoot yourself in the testicles.|`|THvXrJYxaa	Yes, it is a great gun. I have the Glock 19 and I love it. 9mm is good for home defense (especially with hollow points), and the price of the ammo makes it a good gun to shoot at the range.|`|szkrumAJaa	YES|`|Ui2WJH4Iaa	it's a great choice.|`|EmLTnDbAaa	Well the glock is a great gun but honestly that is my second choice. First choice would be the first Colt .45, the perfect handgun for home defense because the first round that hits ends the fight. The .45 hits with more force and causes much more damage than the 9mm so the fire fight is over with the first round that hits. I think the model 1911 is the best .45 on the market but thats just because my grandfather left me his WWII Colt .45. <br>  Your only problem is that the gun is like $800-$1,000. But if you like to shoot with your dad and want to protect your family then this is where the buck stops.|`|93fcc018627f19d9a018f4a839c8c5e7aa	The first thing that you should look for is how comfortable it feels in your hand. I have Glocks and S&W M&Ps in 9 .45 and .357sig. For me the S&W fits better and with the changeable palm swell you can change it to get a custom fit. Sold my XDs after picking up the M&Ps and I think the Glocks are next to go. You would be shortchanging yourself if you didn't check out the M&Ps.|`|tZwOROrjaa	id say a sig sauer 226 or a 239. sig sauer is better in handleing, but glock can be more reliable. i personally prefer sig sauer over glock, but both brands are extremely reliable. even though glock is simplicity at its finest.|`|9NcOBG8Laa	First time purchase? Sure, that's a good handgun. There's sigs and stuff that are a little better but cost like twice as much.<br>  <br>  A glock 17 is fine.|`|Q66wfD61aa	Take a look at the Beretta model 92 it's also a great side arm|`|XtUWmTJVaa	Glocks are good semi-automatics, despite their drawbacks.  If you're just using it at the range and to have around the house "just in case" then the model 17 is fine.  The 9mm is also one of the cheaper guns to shoot compared with the larger or more exotic caliber guns.  There's a reason many law-enforcement agencies are starting to turn to these (namely the cost effectiveness).<br>  <br>  I agree with those who recommend a revolver for home defense.  If you need a high shot capacity you're in trouble already, and with most revolvers you don't have to worry about accidentally leaving the safety on in the heat of the moment.  Revolvers, especially if you pick them up used (200 to 400 used, maybe 350 to 600 new), are very cheap, very rugged, and will NEVER jam like semi-autos are prone to do at bad times.  Also unlike semi-autos (like the Glock) you also don't have to worry about clip springs wearing out if you leave them loaded for long periods of time which can also leads to jamming and misfires.  <br>  <br>  That being said, there's nothing wrong with a Glock for a first-time gun owner, and the model 17 is a fine choice.  It's good to see another responsible shooter joining the ranks of owners.

FPTgqmZLaa	Girls can wrestle because of the Title IX passed by Congress in 1972, that says if a school, or college receives federal funding, women get to play on a men's team for any sport if there is no women's teams available.  <br>  <br>  Hawaii and Texas do have girl teams for their high schools, so they don't have to compete with the boys.<br>  <br>  Most girls that do decide this, usually wrestle in the 98, 103 and 112lbs. weight classes, where size and strength differences aren't that great.|`|SImSGKEtaa	all i can say is "where were these girls who wanted to wrestle boys when I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL!?!?!..<br>  im for it!|`|K1Nnzq3Jaa	Why so sexist?|`|8VgPj26taa	idk but i dont want to chop wood in half!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! yay for spazzes my friend says your a spaz!!!!!!!!!!!! yayaysysy|`|KOYC3XkJaa	Usually, there aren't enough females interested in wrestling for a school to have a female wrestling team. And even if 1 school did, chances are the rest of the schools in their division would not. So the female team would have no opportunity to compete.<br>  So, since the only option is a male wrestling team, that is what females join if they are interested in wrestling. It is allowed, and in fact you cannot refuse to accept a female athlete onto a male team if there is no female team available.
796979sWaa	BRIAN O'DRISCOLL!!!!<br>  <br>  Definitely after todays game against England. England played fricken dirty man! And the ref seemed to be blind to half of it. He got 3 hard blows form English players which all needed to be put in the sin bin for in my opinion. That's 8 yellow cards in England's last 3 games!!! But what do you expect with Martin Johnson as their coach? You could tell dricco was clearly in pain holding his head in his hands but yet he kept battling through it and in the end score a well-deserved try for Ireland. Man of the match, without doubt! <br>  <br>  Also from an Irish perspective I think Rob Kearney, at only 22, is one of the best full-backs in rugby.<br>  <br>  Luke Fitzgerald, Tommy Bowe and Jamie Healslip are really shining in this 6 nations too.<br>  <br>  And the obvious Ronan O'Gara but he wasn't exactly having his best game today against England, missing like 3 penalties and a conversion. But in general hes an excellent player.<br>  <br>  And although Peter Stringer has been on the bench recently, when he is brought on he does give his all, espically against the french side.<br>  <br>  From the international side I would say Chris Patterson for Scotland. Lee Byrne and Tom Shanklin for Wales.|`|ToxDHYsaaa	as a irish fan im going to base my views on my own team.<br>  Rob Kearney i asked about him on here ages ago and how good he was going to be! I havent seen him drop one high ball they guys only 23! Awesome!<br>  Look at Jamie Heaslip if you want to see a good forward in the making! he side stepped the french full back lol! He's a real good young talent.<br>  <br>  Other nations, andy goode has improved.|`|YsSwe1Laaa	Imonol Harinordoquy had a blinder against Wales tonight - everything anyone could wish from a No. 8.  Clearly Man of the Match. <br>  <br>  He has been the standout forward to me, not only for France but for the entire series to date.  All credit to Marc Lievrement for sticking with his guns to offer another chance - maybe it takes a great loosie to see the potential in another.<br>  <br>  Mark L.|`|5w5mJQoYaa	I would love to say shane williams.. but not so much this time..<br>  <br>  um..

Isn't that a bigger priority than an expensive bike?<br>  <br>  That's my advice.|`|CttL3LmBaa	If you have a serious concern about what the appearance of your bike is, change how it looks.  Tag your own bike.  I would stop short of keying it, but you certainly could spray paint it.  Only ride it when you are going to ride without leaving it somewhere.  I have ridden though some pretty rough areas and not felt threatened.<br>  <br>  Go figure, I always see BMW's, Cadillac's, and Hummers in the hood.

LR3uJUswaa	Then the Austin Era would have NEVER happened. The Austin vs. McMahon rivalry would have NEVER happened after WM 14. Vince Mcmahon would try every dirty and scheming trick(a.k.a. Montreal Screwjob) from his mind to prevent Steve Austin from being world champion in the first place after WM 14. Steve Austin HAD TO WIN that match at WM 14(March 1998) in order for the fans to get behind him, and cheer for their new fan favorite.|`|IS6T13ttaa	we would still be watching WCW and the WWF would just be a memory..  Stone Cold saved that company.|`|01b9743a0b503849c2b30b5f6efcca49aa	that would have been cool|`|tWzIsIH0aa	IMO, that gap from WM14 and Summerslam 2002 (not including the wrestling match at the wrestling school TWA he created) would have disappeared. <br>  <br>  I do think HBK would have been a commissioner though. 90s HBK was a scheming liar, so he could have faked his injuries to avoid a rematch with Austin. Once it was proven there was nothing with him - GTV - rematch. He would have excellent series of matches with Kurt Angle, that's for one.
aDfnDLIBaa	yes they are going to make the playoffs .... just wait|`|eJJZhZA0aa	Hell no they they're no making it.

Here and on ESPN and the TNT that it's overkill. I know it's the media's job, but there are other good teams out there.<br>  <br>  But best record right now. I like Gasol. Bynum is talent, but so far injury prone. Fisher rocks!!!! Odom was born two blocks away from me and I've watched him in high school and at Rhode Island.

AA11302315	RAW is more entertaining. Smackdown can get boring and stale. As for entertainment value I would say RAW is my favorite.

AA10789965	i do..he has paid his debt to society and deserves a second chance..|`|lrJN4M49aa	He comes back and can still be productive at that level. Yes I would. Most of you animal rights people are cracked. Saying he doesn't deserve a second chance shows that you personally don't have a forgiving nature. He made mistake, he's doing his time for it end of story. I mean you are still dwelling on dogs that died over a year ago. You might want to look up the word forgiveness. I mean some of you guys arguments border on lunacy. In fact I'm going to go a step further and say I wish he has an even more successful career than before and makes tons of money. I've worked in a hospital for most of my adult life because I care for PEOPLE, why don't you guys try that, the true mark of forgiveness is doing it even when the person does deserve it. By the way I like animals and my dog wants to see michael vick come back, to she doesn't hold a grudge against him (hahahaha....lighten up guys)|`|KZsdVGJzaa	i would like to c him play again. he was fun to watch and was evolving as a passer.in his last season he had like 3-4 td against the steelers and 0 int's. he actually started to remind me of Steve Young (not as good as him though). After all evry1 deserves a second chance. Pacman Jones really didn't deserve to come back. I don't think Chris Henry deserved to either. Vick learned his lesson|`|0eFSeap5aa	If I went to jail for a year or two, I don't see my employer in any hurry to sign me up when I get back out, why should it be any different for Ron Mexico?|`|daRDQE9maa	I'd like to see him play in the NFL again. He was a great player when he played for the Atlanta Falcons... I am a hardcore Buccaneers fan and I would still like to have him back in the nfl. I used to love watchin the struggle between him and the buccaneer defensive squad... I don't care if he did fight dogs or what not.. that is his life at home thats out side of his job... yeah he did get removed from the team and sent to jail do to something that happened at home but still I think that when he is out and back on the right road he should in dead get to turn bakc to his profession which is playing football now maybe tht company doesn't want him back but i wouldn't be surprised if some one else that is in need of a difference maker like him takes him or perhaps makes a trade for him...|`|EUdHcGW1aa	I think he deserves a second chance. Football is the only thing he knows except for dog fighting. The only teams that are mentioned of showing some interest is Minnesota and San Francisco. Any team that does get him will have to deal with PETA and other protesters at practices and games. If he is reinstated but no one signs him or the Falcons are not able to trade him (he's technically still with the Falcons), he could make an attempt with the CFL. But I'm sure they're a little hesitant of letting him in after the Ricky Williams fiasco.|`|R2teBtllaa	no,i hope that bastard never touches a football again.<br>  hes a disgrace to the NFL and football players acroos america.<br>  althought hes a punk he was a good athlete no doubt about that.but he need to stick to the CFL|`|TzHsjqcIaa	*You know what, I kinda do because I wanna see if he has anything left after being locked up for a couple of years. He was not a good QB anyway but he has always been a great athlete!

Like it or not, the legal severity of the crimes don't justify him being banned. Maybe the laws and penalties should be changed but that wouldn't have any affect of Vick's current situation.<br>  <br>  I'd expect the NFL Commissioner to put some sort of agreement in place that will require Vick to perform various activities and meet other measurable goals before allowing him to sign with a team. One of these might be to start a foundation for the better treatment of animals or some such project in an attempt to appease the animal rights wackos.<br>  <br>  Whatever he does, and whatever the agreement with the NFL, it won't be enough to satisfy many people, and among those, a lot of football fans.<br>  <br>  I'd personally like to see Vick play again and think he will. Most teams will shy away from giving him tryouts because of the negative publicity. But he will get some offers and it will be up to him to prove he deserves to be back in the league, on the field and off.|`|SIP8xkPeaa	I will lose all respect for any team that brings him on.

Being able to watch them in action will give you a better idea which one is for you.  Also, you can use that as a filter.  Instructors that don't know what they're doing, who aren't at the same competitive level as real martial artists, and who are just trying to make a buck often will not let you observe a class or a sparing class without signing a contract.|`|r5AMG8g7aa	Define what you mean by better, better how?  There are no superior martial arts only arts that are by someone that is more knowledgeable. It always come down to the individual and who taught them, not the style.|`|0SN6Ix0haa	i know this is going to make a lot of people mad and some people are going to say im lying, but the truth is the truth. If you look way back in history tae kwon do was a sport like UFC. im not sayng that it is bad, but is just not a true martial art. try aikido, kung fu, karate, shaolin, or san chou. they have been there since the beginning and are the most knowlegeable. tae kwon do is for people that just want to learn the basics.|`|g2h6qUUXaa	tae kwon do|`|25xZMjmTaa	there is no such thing as a better/best, or worst martial art. It depends on the martial artist.|`|Tm2llZleaa	Taekwondo will be more effective in the short run, but aikido will be more effective in the long run.  I've studied both of these and am currently training for my shodan (black belt) in aikido. Aikido takes MUCH longer to learn and will take a few years before an aikidoka will confident enough to use some of the techniques in a self-defense situation.  Taekwondo is a nice offensive art, but if you're attacked first, it's not much use. Aikido is a defensive martial art. So while you don't train on how to punch, kick, etc, you DO train on how to defend against all types of punches, kicks, grabs, take-downs, etc...   Go with whichever martial art is more your style.|`|SImSGKEtaa	aikido,<br>  minimal effort, your feet remain on the ground (it is incredibly easy to disarm someone trying a roundhouse at you)<br>  the smallest masters of aikido expound very little effort effectively disabling any size or strength attacker.|`|ve4LsVszaa	If I had to pick one.  I would go with TKD.<br>  <br>  However, a lot of a martial art's effectiveness depends on the situation.  For example, if you are a cop, you don't want to do all that striking and you need an art that will allow you to immobilize struggling people who you are trying to arrest.  For this, Akido is great.  Akido falls short when you face skilled punchers and kickers as it is difficult if not impossible to apply Akido against a good striker.|`|D1qwQ5Zqaa	It is your preference. Taekwondo does high kicks impractical for fighting situations, but good for show and a good workout. Aikido is much better.<br>  <br>  If you want simple self defense, I suggest getting into Jujitsu. That's the way to go. There are different kinds, so I would suggest you doing some research on what you would like best.|`|rh4MS9Rvaa	aikido

hfb4Cv05aa	No. You need to do a light warm-up and THEN stretch. You can pull a muscle if you haven't done any light warm-ups before you stretch. After you stretch you need another light warm-up, and then you can start running. After running, let your body warm-down a bit, and stretch again.|`|AUGGajC1aa	Do you actually NEED to ask that question?<br>  <br>  Of course you need to stretch. Now if you miss a day here and there, or forget to stretch afterwards, nothing bad should happen. <br>  However, you should also avoid overstretching, which does no good for you either.|`|fo2E0NOLaa	Yes, stretching is VERY important. You can injure yourself and pull something if you don't. However, running is also in a way part of your stretching as it warms up your muscles as well. But it is very necessary to stretch first.<br>  <br>  Don't forget to stretch afterwards as well.|`|JK7xWBnRaa	You dont NEED to stretch but if you dont you will be running a lot less effectively, if you just hate strecthing or something you could just do a warmup before all of your runs to loosen yourself up.|`|6r9qsH8Maa	It's a good idea to stretch because you could pull a muscle and I don't think you want to do that. Just simply stretching a little bit will help in the long run.|`|EDD7QbVxaa	It's always good to stretch before doing any activities really. It's not completely necessary, but it feels good, and prevents pulling a muscle.|`|6myI8y1Faa	you should definately stretch at least a little before you run. U could seriously hurt yourself if u don't...trust me, I know from experience.|`|PhPD7uAFaa	always stretch with out a  doubt our joints are like rubber bands and if you don't stretch and warm them up then you know then evntually they could snap!|`|LlkdoZTeaa	warming up before any exercise is a very beneficial and responsible,<br>  <br>  if you exercise for example run without warming up you put yourself at risk of, as you said pulled muscles, strains and sprains and worst of all torn ligaments<br>  <br>  and just think athletes spend time warming up before events, they dont do that to look good or pass time do they?|`|V4vddbsAaa	usually when i dont stretch i get a pain on my legs and i twist my ankle very often. That doesn't happen when i DO stretch so yea i think you should stretch lol|`|g4OOA0rAaa	dude......ur a jackass.  if u don't stretch u will eventually hurt urself.  dont b an idiot.  do ur stretches.|`|Qh2rc1DNaa	Should I Stretch Before or After Running?<br>  Wednesday October 8, 2008<br>  I talk to lots of runners who are confused about whether they should stretch before or after running, or both. Now a new study offers more evidence to suggest that it's best to not stretch cold muscles and wait until after your run to stretch.<br>  <br>  Researchers from the University of Nevada Las Vegas found that two common pre-running stretches for the hamstrings and quadriceps may actually reduce performance by decreasing leg power. "Developing flexibility is important for reducing sports injury, but the time to stretch is after, not before, performance," said UNLV kinesiology professor and study co-author Bill Holcomb.|`|rW7fiXtdaa	YESSS U NEED TO STRETCH! this is soo important and most runners don't realize it. stretching is key before AND after ur run...it will help prevent injury and lossen up ur muscles. if u dont stretch u will become veryy tight and it will be harder for u to run each time.|`|a8yDDprlaa	Yes, it is true.Always stretch before any physical activity.If you don't, you may pull a muscle or possibly get a more serious injury.|`|bjNgMocPaa	Yeah.<br>  Always stretch, it helps.<br>  Stretching loosens muscles that you'll use when you run.<br>  If you don't stretch, you can really injure yourself.|`|jWO10NN5aa	Yes, you must stretch to loosen up the muscles, otherwise you might rip or tear something or cause a painful strain.  You cannot stretch while running.|`|6iCOMx8laa	You need to stretch to loosen and warm up your muscles.
IS6T13ttaa	heres a dose of reality for the yankee haters out there.  A-Rod has been tested three times while he was on the Yankees.  and never came up positive.  he won the 2007 MVP without them.  thats a fact.  he was tested that year for the WBC.   and most likely tested that year by the MLB.  he has been tested three times by MLB while on the yankees.  so ya he's just a super talented player.  im a yankees fan and i gotta say he does disapear in the clutch though.  even in 07 playoffs so ya best player in baseball maybe not.|`|BZ7HRmfIaa	It's not only that he used steroids it's that's he made excuses  saying he was "young and stupid when he used steroids" and he was what 24 or 25, I find that offense first of all cause of young and secondly because he put all young people in the category of being stupid.|`|2gRdi0xRaa	I dont care if people think Arod's #'s are tainted by roids.  The roids dont make your hand eye cordination any better.  The fool can hit period.  It may have helped his hr #'s but he still had to have the skills to hit the ball.|`|G4wGCghdaa	You are Naive I see.  I am an endangered species. The last known genetic relative to neanderthal man.

The dude does have skills|`|3QELIOU7aa	He takes the award for being baseballs biggest douche bag.|`|NQBtZkeoaa	He's only the second best player on roids. Bonds would be the best one.|`|QzezKBmnaa	You mean.....A - Roid right?|`|3nnOvv83aa	His best year is debatable,and there is truly no way to figure out if he kept doing steroids or hgh (which still doesn't have proper testing in baseball), <br>  The thing is steroid wont help you not strike out. it will help you hit homers with more regularity and throw faster if you are a pitcher.<br>  <br>  I hope he stopped using steroids after 03 but it is quite possible he didn't.|`|5nJv09nMaa	ok first of all...steroids have nothing to do with ppl striking out. Thats just b cuz they suck. And if everyone started to use steroids the game of baseball would just suck soooo much b cuz it wouldnt be a pitchers game at all anymore people would be crushing them out of the park all of the time ruining all of the hard worked records of the past....It would screw baseball up the bum.|`|2bkV73gpaa	A-Rod's sure won a lot of pennants for the Yankees, huh? Won a lot in Texas too, did he? Surely he won a flag for Seattle? Bottom line: his nickname should be L-Rod.|`|cypNCoh3aa	If A-Rod ever stops using maybe we'll find out.  With everything that's come out, it's obvious he was lying when he said he only used in Texas.|`|6RdxyO7kaa	not really...i dont hate A-rod...but i dont think he's the best|`|EvIWKqpDaa	I don't root for cheaters.|`|c6q3EERdaa	The thing is, Mohammed, we don't know if A-Rod has continued to use steroids or not.

More then that, he lost respect from alot of people.|`|V430UrvFaa	I may not harbor that much resentment against A-Rod, but I am disappointed that he did steroids in the first place. He is not the best player anymore anyway, it's either Pujols or Hanley Ramirez.|`|kGXU1Dotaa	Yes he is the best let the haters hate i'll always be his #1 fan.|`|ZyfYh4vdaa	A-Rod really isn't that great
UYPfC5YVaa	Because the Laker's fans have every reason to believe that their fave team would win the finals this year. The Lakers has been dominant most especially against the top contender teams.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	First of all, if Lakers fans ever want to know why there are so many haters, its because of fans like Tav.  The Lakers lost last year, they made it to the Finals, but they lost to the Celtics.  Instead of giving the Celtics props for a good series, you say they got lucky???  Are you serious??  They got lucky to win 4 out of the 6 games?  That 39 point win in game 6 was all luck??  Seriously?  Then you make excuses on top of it, saying Bynum wasnt there.  I'm not trying to bash on the Lakers for losing last years finals, but when you have fans who make excuses and say the championship was won due to luck, it just shows their pure ignorance.  And more people remember the ignorant fans like Tav instead of the good fans, and thats why so many people hate.<br>  <br>  As for the statement, it holds some water, but isn't always 100% accurate.  I mean in a case like the NFL, the Steelers would still be the team to beat, they're the champions and the teams  haven't changed yet, so for now that holds true.  In the NBA, now, its different.  The teams have changed somewhat through free agency, trades, the draft, there are different pieces to different teams.  Given the way the season has played out, are the Celtics THE team to beat?  I'd say no.  I'd say the Lakers, Cavs, and Celtics all are teams to beat as of right now, they're all playing about equally now.|`|KTp27Fokaa	I'm sure over 10,000 have said that at one time in their lives.|`|YhfMrppSaa	Boston owned all at playoffs, I agree, that's the team to beat now.<br>  <br>  <br>  Thanks for the title win, hope u C's a luck<br>  <br>  We need the title back often soon<br>  <br>  <br>  Enjoy C's fan and all Celtics|`|2db7f31f8de2a63df2848a630426eea7aa	People really need to stop saying well "they got lucky"<br>  <br>  You don't win the Championship because you "got lucky".|`|NxKjrz7xaa	celtics got lucky, bynum was hurt, bynum in the playoffs is going to be indestructible|`|50PfC3OIaa	I like the baby pic :)<br>  <br>  I guess because its kind of obvious statement. it's not like everyone gasped and went "You know what? HE'S RIGHT!".
dDas43FZaa	Bisping is the worst. <br>  Best attitude: Matt Hammil|`|9b5QUw2eaa	I am not a big fan of Sean Sherk.  His drug use and overly confident prefight interviews do not emulate the modest humble way of the martial artist.  He shark muscles definitely don't keep up with his mouth.|`|Xm8crry3aa	War Machine. Kidd if this is true about him talking like this of President Obama this is a federal offense and if it is public he should have been arrested by now. Tank Abbott is also a loud mouth bully.

His trash talk, his arrogance, his conspiracy theories, and now the selfish punk is refusing to defend his LW title. The guy just did jail time last year for punching out a cop. Threatening to kill your opponent in the ring isnt doing the sport any favors.|`|K1Nnzq3Jaa	Brock Lesnar.<br>  <br>  He is an  arrogant punk , and the only thing he has is power and size.<br>  <br>  Sadly , he is the one brings in alot of fans because of his WWE past|`|QQqhzuNDaa	What kind of woman is into bloodsports? No doubt a lonely one.|`|CnNAOoWgaa	I'd have to say BJ Penn.  The guy is an overrated fighter with a poor work ethic, an arrogant attitude, and a total lack of respect for his fellow competitors.  People call him "the Prodigy" but there's nothing prodigious about him except his mouth and the size of his gut.  If he spent as much time training as he does running his mouth and putting other guys down he might actually live up to some of the hype surrounding him.|`|I4i1pswraa	Tito was alright..

nAtBuBRhaa	I think Matt Cassel is a great quarterback, I think he's one of the players, that are overlooked. And those Patriot offensive coaching staff, is incredible at developing a quarterback (See: Tom Brady). Now, I do understand that Matt Cassel was surrounded by all-pro receivers such as Randy Moss and Wes Welker. But, still, to lead a team 11-5 as a back-up quarterback is amazing. And if he does land in Kansas City, then you have to understand these factors: Dwayne Bowe is one of the most underrated receivers in the NFL if you ask me. And, Tony Gonzales still has a couple good years in the NFL. And Larry Johnson isn't a bad slot receiving running back either. Their o-line, as always, is very old. But, if he does end up in Kansas City, he will turn that franchise around again.|`|15wwA3jjaa	I too see Matt Cassel ending up in KC and agree with you that the Mike Vrabel trade does seem a bit unfinished.  Granted Scott Pioli has a great relationship with Bill Belichick and the entire Patriots organization but why would you sign a guy who's already showing a decline when you are in the process of rebuilding a team from the bottom up?|`|33f4c852804fa42db9a7cbb912480080aa	The Patriots aren't gonna do ANYTHING with Matt Cassel until they see TOM BRADY IN TRAINING CAMP NEXT SEASON...|`|H1VIZsutaa	I think KC is the most likely. I don't think anything will get worked out until draft day if anything happens.|`|knGAhlGRaa	ask yourself this:<br>  <br>  cassel played 1 Season with great WRs and has only played 1 year<br>  <br>  worth 1st round and 1 2nd round or 2 1st round draft picks?|`|0MJRD9sYaa	I think if the Chiefs get Cassel and draft a WR who slipped into the second round, they could have a good combination by having Dwayne Bowe and another receiver like Hakeem Nicks or Darius Hayward-Bey.|`|q6NGxNR3aa	I think he will be a Chief because the chiefs  gm  and bellichik will keep trading players like dallas did to miami last year. Im not sure how good he will be outside of ne but he's worth giving a try.|`|QuofdtDhaa	Matt Cassel just got traded to the Cheifs. The terms of the deal has not been revealed yet.|`|WpoYIerDaa	yes|`|bb77b8ee69e9346f333012e2623fa826aa	Not Chiefs, he'd be perfect for the Lions. Lions need leadership and someone to step up rite now.|`|U3KAgO0baa	it is an option, along with the 49ers, bucs, and possibly bears.|`|daRDQE9maa	It's not worth it in kansas.. He's only played one season starting and he did have a great surrounding team... and honestly I think that the Patriots would need to hang out to him till they know for a fact Brady is going to be healthy next season... becuzz if they trade him now and brady's not well by the start of the season then what ? or what if he comes back nad he really shouldn't and he ends up getting hurt again right off the back but they dont have a back up becuz they traded for 2 1 round picks... but really they could go either way i just don't think its worth it for kansas City.|`|ZPJyVOpTaa	the chances are huge i think and i think he will perform well as long as Dwane Bowe stays healthy. He is a great WR and he will be in the top 10 in receiving yards and receptions. the best thing that this team could do at this point is get Cassel. BUT, it may require 2 1st round picks. 1 this year and 1 next year. that is a huge sacrifice to make. Pioli will make the right moves and he obviously knows the NE organization well.|`|rNUyV1EYaa	Cassel would be a great fit for the Chiefs. And I agree; "just" Vrabel sounds like part of an incomplete deal.<br>  <br>  My only question is this-are the Patriots convinced that Tom Brady's knee is ready? <br>  <br>  I think if they have even the slightest doubt, they will hang on to Cassel. The trade deadline isn't until October, remember that. If Brady gets through the early part of the season then Cassel could get moved.
Oz7x0faxaa	not rite now, but if 'nova performs well in the big east tournament and goes 2 at least the elite eight in the NCAA tourney,and he performs well he may have an outside chance|`|iwCGhU4Naa	no<br>  aj abrams go texas|`|H1VIZsutaa	If he goes in the 1st round, he won't go any higher than 30.|`|NG6eeCfuaa	No. He'll be another Antonio Winfield (Cincy) if he comes out.

ZyfYh4vdaa	Albert is better than A-Roid and Barry combined.|`|c6q3EERdaa	I think he is the best out there. I might come across a little biased, since I'm a Cardinals fan and Pujols is my favorite player, but it's true. Given that he hasn't tested positive for steroids and some of the best players (recently) have, it's hard not to say that he's the best in the Big Leagues.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	He could very well be the best player, well the best clean player, although we actually don't know for sure that he's clean.  He hasn't shown up on any lists yet, that we know of, but you never know if he's one of those 103.|`|5xIroQjMaa	I would say that regardless of roids or not, Pujols is the best everday player in the game of baseball today.|`|g9P7oWyeaa	Yes, if hes clean. I'm thinking Hanley Ramirez should be in the conversation as well.|`|fec7bde9941e38ab22f37cfa5f55bf3caa	NO WAY NOT EVEN CLOSE|`|5nJv09nMaa	ok i love how everyone is saying pujols is doing roids but like not even caring about everyone else that suddenly started to hit home runs...jimmy rollins in 07 compared to how bad he did in 08. Pujols is the best all around player in the MLB  idc what u fu(k cun+s think he would have already been mentioned if he was in the book so suck one *****.|`|2wgEsVmsaa	Yes. He works at fielding his position, is the best natural hitter in the game, and does lots of out-reach work. I hate how people look at his muscles and accuse him of PED abuse. No one has ever mentioned him. Such witch hunting disgusts me.|`|AA11537652	Pujols clean? <br>  <br>  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA... *takes a breath* HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA... That's the best joke I have heard in a while!!!|`|fefYXm71aa	Pujols is the best player not to show up on any list<br>  <br>  put it that way|`|9YyzSkXWaa	I would agree that Pujols is the best.  Who comes close to him?|`|gaOSUthbaa	Yes, for now. Who knows what the season will bring.|`|Rz9vY53Aaa	yea and hes better than anyone else in the league|`|CkZrQVEGaa	lol probably but i can really see AP on that steriod list|`|R1HwQoYhaa	Well its not completely impossible that he didnt 'roid up. BUT it hasnt been proven yet, and its not like he looks significantly stronger like bonds for example. i am a cardinals fan, pujols is my favorite player, but even if i  wasnt, he is probably the best baseball player, if i never found out arod took steroids, i might hav called a tie. arod is still probly 2nd best now. but c'mon, pujols consistently hits .300+ every year, 35-50 homers, 100+ RBI, 100+ runs, and has a gold glove AND a ring. he is the best rite now, at the end of his career he will shatter records

Not a big deal....go play and have fun|`|2NtiI51aaa	no<br>  think about it.. ice is frozen water.. youre ice skates get wet all the time<br>  so why would rain make a difference<br>  <br>  just make sure you really dry the blades of your skates after youre done playing so they wont rust!|`|QSShHlRiaa	It would be fine <br>  as long as you dry them off afterward <br>  becuase if you dont you will end up with rust <br>  and other stuff on the blade wich wont help your skating at all.|`|tS2oOAcGaa	nothing is going to happen but is harder to sake in rain cause the ice is starting to melt so i sagest you go indoor|`|vJPZ7IiIaa	Yep just make sure you let your skates dry out, wouldn't want to keep your them wet. In the end you'll probably end up having stinky feet if you don't do this.

0TAld46gaa	They are good <br>  but plenty of other schools out there with a better girls basketball program|`|i5MInqeMaa	There all right for PAC 10 team.  but there football team is overrated and sucks.|`|AA12339493	theyre mostly a football school. their basketball program (mens and women) arent that great. if you're a girl looking to play college ball in the pac10 you go to cal or stanford.|`|olPHAnfYaa	No, proof of that is when they signed Romeo to be on the roster. you never sign a player just so you get publicity or funding from Master P.|`|YhfMrppSaa	They got good football team then basketball team.<br>  <br>  <br>  They are good
5gG2OfHIaa	$ 41 Million up front.   The contract is too expensive.  Talk about locker room unity.  How do you have a squad of team players when you have one player pulling down such an absurd amount of dollars.  Net, net:  another losing Danny deal.|`|Vyz5YnZqaa	I remember him stepping on Andre Gurode's head after he lost his helmet, Haynesworth was frustrated because Gurode was dominating him the whole game. The Skins just overpaid for an overrated player. As a Dallas fan, I'm not worried in the least because Haynesworth will have his hands full with Andre Gurode, Leonard Davis and Flozell Adams, not the other way around, Gurode frustrated him before so he'll do it twice a year now. The Redskins payed 100 mil. for 8.5 sacks and Dallas is getting 20 sacks for the same price with Demarcus Ware and I would rather have to deal with stopping Haynesworth than Ware any day.|`|Ch9TedMcaa	He gets to give Romo nightmares for 7 years. Yes!|`|KTp27Fokaa	I like the signing. If you look at the Titans stats against the run without him in the line-up they are significantly worse. He is a big run stopper, and demands double teams.|`|42MOquw8aa	im a huge titans fan and disappointed that he left so i hope he breaks his leg and never plays a single down for you|`|7RziqsDcaa	Stupid move for both teams.|`|Pw4sfCZVaa	I would have preferred Chris Canty but I'll settle with Haynesworth as long as chemistry is created.<br>  <br>  People will have to double or tripple team him allowing single coverage for Jason Taylor and Andre Carter causing a maximum amount of sacks. I think its a good idea.<br>  <br>  With the progression of Devin Thomas, and possibly Malcolm kelly along with a healthier more productive offensive line I believe the 'Skins are could possibly be SB contenders.<br>  <br>  W/O W/R progression or Offensive line health I'd expect 8-8 to 10-6 due to the strong defence.<br>  <br>  I'm not crazy about the signing but not SO skeptical.|`|HtYGxZcCaa	I think 7 years 100 million was too much for him or any DT. He's had a hard time playing safety and has a history of causing problems like when he got a 5 game suspension for stomping of Cowboys G Andre Gurode. His first 2 years in the league his numbers werent that great but in the last 2 years they were.I think he played hard because he was in his contract year and wanted to be the highest paid defensive player. I think it will help the Redskins D-Line but its also a risky move to pay him so much for the long term|`|YlBLz9lTaa	if he plays inspired good move for the redskins if he doesnt horrible move... when he goes all out hes a crazy DT but he doesnt always push himself this year he went all out cus it was his contract year it will be interesting to see if he keeps it up now that he got the big contract|`|KZsdVGJzaa	i was mad at first since they got him so fast and my rams (slow front office) didn't get a chance to at least schedule a visit. now i'm thinking WOW 100 mil 41 guaranteed for 13 months. he's not gonna play for yenz he's gonna get lazy since he's so paid now|`|0eFSeap5aa	I have faith in Daniel Snyder, nobody over pays for imminent letdowns than Danny boy.  But then total lack of fiscal responsibility is why this team is in Washington D.C.|`|6dtAmXcAaa	Yes I am glad that they signed him. He will be a good asset to their team and will provide great defense. Now they just have to find someone to replace campbell.|`|QzezKBmnaa	My thoughts?<br>   "To much money".....<br>  "Greed".....<br>   "Great....he now makes more money than i will make in 5 million life times"|`|cypNCoh3aa	That's a LOT of money to spend on a DT that can't stay healthy.|`|yxRUTWMDaa	I was fine considering everyone was so hyped about Jason Taylor and Adam Archuleta, but nothing happened with them. I think any star traded to the redskins will end up sucking on the redskins.|`|DlLrqKAFaa	I love it. Let the redskins spend that much on a player that wont live up to it. im glad the titans didnt sign him.
JK7xWBnRaa	Because you actually use your arms when you run as momentum for your legs, so pretty much your arms are powering your legs which is why it is important to have a strong upper body when you run.|`|YMdX3aJZaa	The faster you move your arms, the faster your legs will move.

AA11674745	Nothing has been confirmed yet. Some speculate that he hasn't even arrived in Denver yet.<br>  <br>  Personally, I'd hate to see him go - he's my favorite player. But if it means seeing him finally win a Super Bowl, then I'm all for it.|`|Vyz5YnZqaa	What did Philly do for him, shouldn't that be the other way around?|`|KTp27Fokaa	Because the Broncos know how to win Super Bowls...<br>  <br>  jk<br>  <br>  The Broncos offered him 2 years, I'm not sure if the Eagles did.|`|HtYGxZcCaa	im not an Eagles fan but Im sad he left Philly, the Eagles did alot for him and the city of Philly loved him. He has a greater chance of winning the SB in Philly than in Denver. Hes getting old anyway next year will be his 14th year, he might have left because he was only getting a 1 yr deal instead of 2 yr deal that he got from Denver. Hopefully the Eagles draft a good safety and can still win the Super Bowl<br>  <br>  He was the heart and soul of the Eagles and I think they shouldve gave him 2 yrs because of how hard he plays. Its definately sad to see him leave Philly|`|mOaxBZ2Raa	I think the Eagles didn't offer him the money he wanted because they wanted to save money for FA......I think its a stupid move but he only has 1 or 2 years left, one guy can't fix the Broncos D.....also I don't feel Philly did very much for B Dawk after all he has 0 superbowl rings...Brian Dawkins did alot for Philly and I guess he felt the money was right in Denver and it was time to move on......he will be missed..|`|3Jd9dGJgaa	Are you serious?????? Why the hell did he do that? Oh my god. he was my favorite player on the Eagles. It just goes to show that even if dedicated players say they want a championship, money can change anyone's mind in an instant.|`|UIi7B3UDaa	Well philly had weeks to deal with his contract, obviously they didnt do enough to keep the LEADER of the franchise, how can you turn on his back after one day, he spent 10+ delivering mind crushing hits, playying through pain just to keep his team in the game, and he has people like you who are fags bashing him cause he left your team|`|e72e23aed155f72d1b8966dc2699bd7caa	Let me start by saying that I am and always have been a die-hard Eagles fan. But, today, I am disgusted. The Eagles offered him a one year deal. I know Dawk is a "seasoned" player... but he is a Pro Bowl cailliber player... not to mention, he is the leader of that team.... not just the defense. They're losing much more than a veteran strong safety. They're loosing their heart and soul. He openly stated that he wanted to come back to the Eagles... and he has at least 2 years left. He wants to play football for as long as possible... who can blame him? Especially when he still plays better than many others in his position. I blame the Eagles front office for letting him go.|`|AA10545938	This really sucks. Im an eagles fan and im sad to here this. This is the second worse thing that can possible happen. The worst is having Westbrook leave. He prob left cuz he wasnt going to get paid enough with the egles and the broncos have a little more money to spend.|`|HPqCRBq8aa	I just hope Baltimore don't do the same thing with Ray. I can't even imagine that defense without him. I guess its the same feeling in Philly about Dawkins.|`|AJskIaxgaa	cuz the broncos want him|`|TGrObqWzaa	he really gay? wow
xKiyZnsFaa	okay i play basketball for my school. here's a few tips that might help.<br>  <br>  1. dont be afraid of the ball, even if you are a bad dribbler. just bend down a little bit with your knees and back and guard the ball with your opposite hand while you dribble. if you get stuck hold the ball and pivot (turn on your one foot without lifting it off the ground) and shout HELP. then someone will come up and you can pass them the ball. with bounce pass (pass the ball so it bounces on the floor once) or a chest pass (hold the ball at your chest level and pass it straight to your teammate so it lands near their chest).<br>  <br>  2. when shooting, dont just throw it up in the air and hope it gets in the basket. square your shoulders up with the basket and put your shooting hand (the hand you write with or are most comfortable with) firmly on the ball with your guide hand on the ball. use your legs and your arms to get more power. if you push the ball up you can get more arc. and always follow thorugh. plus dont push the ball with your guide hand, its only there to guide the ball. and FOLLOW THROUGH.<br>  <br>  3. when blocking, make sure you face the person. keep an eye on your man and the ball constantly. use your forearm to push someone away, that way it wont be a foul. and dont be all up on your man the whole game. you'll look stupid and you'll run out of breath. just keep an eye on them and dont let them get past you. just play hard defense when the ball is near or if your man has the ball.<br>  <br>  also a pick is when you cross your arms across your chest and stand at an angle, wither to the left or the right of the person so that when you teammate runs around the player gurading them and you that other players will run into you and give your team a chance to shoot and score<br>  <br>  <br>  those are really the basics. i could write more but ithink thats enough to help you get better.|`|hp157lNmaa	i played for a team for about 10 years...<br>  <br>  here are some basics... you cannot travel (pick up the ball and run without dribbling it), you cant double dribble (dribble with both hands at the same time or start dribbling then pick up the ball and start dribbling again), you cant foul (hit, slap, kick, anything of that sort that will interfere with the persons body). <br>  <br>  when shooting, keep legs shoulder length apart, bend your knees, keep you shoulders aligned and shoot with the flick of your wrist. when catching, keep your hands open and aligned if front of your chest... pretend as if you're grabbing someones boobs almost.<br>  <br>  get a ball and practice passing by throwing it against a wall...watch college or pro b-ball on tv and see how they pass.<br>  <br>  i think the best thing is to join a team or attend a basketball workshop... you will learn a lot. also, invest in getting a hoop or just go to the park and play around some.
LUnscegvaa	Lyoto Machida<br>  <br>  I'd suggest<br>  <br>  Best wishes :)***|`|9b5QUw2eaa	Anderson Silva.<br>  <br>  Since they were former training partners who are use to fighting in each other's ranges, I wouldn't count on a knockout or submission.  I think Anderson might just be a hair more athletic and that might be the slight edge he would need to score a stronger decision win.|`|NJMzhcKhaa	Not going to happen, Anderson Silva already states that he will not fight Lyoto as they're close friends and close training partners.<br>  <br>  But if the fight ever happened, I will say Lyoto will win as he won't get caught by Silva's knees the way other Silva's opponents were, and he has every bit the precision punches that Silva has.|`|uBrTu7OBaa	That would be an interesting fight, though my game is on Silva.<br>  <br>  Anderson Silva is like the guy that plays chess.. and he's already ten steps ahead of you. Machida is awesome and has the potential to get Silva down... but hey man, Silva for the win. Hands down.|`|E563RzW2aa	As the person below said, it's not gonna happen, but if it did, I'd say Machida, based solely on the fact Silva has stated that Machida's caught him numerous times while sparring.|`|ZegKais3aa	why take the fun out of it, let them fight and learn the answer the old fashion way.  that'll be a great match to see|`|AA11977363	Hey Scott E, <br>  <br>  Awesome question! Getting right down to business - no current fighter at 185 can beat Anderson Silva unless the champ gets overconfident and under prepares for the opponent. The one person who could cut down to 185 to beat him is Lyoto Machida since he is "smallish" at light heavyweight. Of course, that is highly unlikely to happen unless Machida loses at 205 which is tough to imagine. <br>  <br>  Machida is compeltely underrated, and I encourage true MMA fans to watch more of his fights on YouTube (see the link at the bottom of my answer). He has the fastest hands above 185 (yes even faster than Anderson Silva) and is extremely versatile as as a wrestler/grapler. Like most Brazilians, his jiu-jitsu is also a given. Watch his signature one-legged trip and you'll see what I mean. <br>  <br>  To sum it up, Machida is a bigger/stronger version of Anderson. My brave prediction is that Lyoto Machida would beat Anderson Silva at 185 in round 3 (out of 5) if they were to ever meet in the octagon. Cheers! <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x4qrag_lyoto-machida-complete-career-highl_sport" rel="nofollow">http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x4qrag_...</a>|`|mQmF9LRoaa	silva <br>  mainly because he pushes the action alot but on the other hand the lyoto that recently fought thiago silva knocked him down 3 time in the first round and then giving him a k.o at the endsilva would win  but it depends on witch machida shows up to fight

77045174d9bf49e750122336ad658359aa	Well, you said yourself why Ghana is not a top team yet, they rely on a single player. When more talented Ghananians (dunno how they are called) like Essien show up, it will be a very strong team considering their extremely offensive play (so unusual nowadays).<br>  <br>  The main problem now is that they will have pressure on them next time, unlike this one, and I think they are still too unexperienced for a pressure to qualify to the round of 8 (what will be the next goal with no doubt). They proved in the game with Brazil how anxious and nervous they get when things aren't that well, and they had no pressure at all! Very few really expected them to win (even though millions of anti-brazilians hoped for), so they went to the game with no worries.<br>  <br>  When the pressure started (having to score at least a goal since they went for a full attack strategy), they ended up shooting too many times with no real chances of making it, what is a sign that they were anxious for a goal.<br>  <br>  Much respect for the Ghana's team anyway, since they proved why they are called "Brazil from Africa" by going forward with no fear, a truly inspiring warrior spirit (the brazilians should learn that from them). Quick passes and very versatile movement allowed them to find gaps on Brazil's defense, unfortunately they were unable to score, but they proved they only need to improve a few things before being feared. Unlike other teams that are far from being strong (Iran, Saudi Arabia), and others that have to find what the h.ell went wrong (Sweden, Serbia and Montenegro) even though they have more experience in WC than Ghana.|`|AA11512241	***** no i am not happy with the result.. we could have beat Brazil and i dont care what anyone else thinks. With Michael Essien there (the best player in the world) it would have been different. I am mad because we played so well and dominated but Brazil won with a misleading scoreline. Oh and by the way... does offsides not even apply for Brazil... are they too good for those rules. It's like the refs think that Brazil should beat an African team so they give them all the calls. Ghana will be back. They have a young and strong squad that u havent heard the last of... especially if u are from Brazil. Fight on ghana!|`|f59711e57e7ef8721ed3c7f0cebf5c65aa	we wern't particularly happy with the result cus i mean we lost but we were happy with the performance the team put out ........................................... mean they i am not from Ghana i was just supporting them|`|AA12265106	i understand how bad you feel, adrianos goal was off side.

He also had the best rating during the first half of games, lost it in the 3rd quarter but then picked it back up in the 4th quarter.|`|Ur6Avy5Naa	I have two quarterbacks in mind.<br>  <br>  First if you are basing your decision solely on stats, you would have to say Drew Brees. i mean he throw the ball all over everyone. He was 17 yards short of Dan Marino's record. I mean that's got to count for something. the only down part with Brees is that he only led his team to an 8-8 record and they missed the playoffs.<br>  <br>  Kurt Warner was the best as far as leadership. He led a Cardinals team that no one expected to make the playoffs almost win the superbowl. He came up a little bit short because of the great catch by Santonio Holmes. He put up great numbers as well. I mean 3 thousand yard receivers. Crazy.<br>  <br>  So based on that I think Kurt Warner did the best and Drew Brees was a close number two.|`|45UxRjQtaa	Its either Brees, Rivers, Roethlisberger, or Mcnabb, <br>  <br>  which is extremely hard, being that Brees through for 5000 + yards and 30+ tds he was great<br>  <br>  Rivers has a passer rating over 100 and through for 30+tds <br>  <br>  Roethlisberger got beat up all season, no one had faith in him and he took the team to the superbowl <br>  <br>  and Mcnabb, well he almost had 4000 yards, made some dumb comments during the season, and still almost took his team to the superbowl after tieing a game with Cincinnati who played horrible, give him credit for going through all thje beatings hes taken and dealing with horrible fans to almost overcome it all|`|85AoQYh8aa	i would have to say brees he put up godly numbers in a lot of the games and colston was out for a lot of the season and even when he came back he continued to dish out the ball to everyone.  Also the guy is short how the hell he sees over the line and is able to be that effective i have no idea.|`|fAMpwF3Aaa	Matt Cassel<br>  he had to fill in for Tom Brady, he had never started a game since high school and took the New England Patriots to a 11-5 record<br>  he thew 21 touchdowns and 11 interceptions, and just barley missed the playoffs|`|gUgzg81oaa	im going to say Kurt Warner because he got his team who had never been to the SB and who had a losing record last year to get to the Super Bowl and almost win against a team who was a major over dog|`|s2vuUtRUaa	Ben Roethlisberger. His Steelers won the Super Bowl so that's enough to make him the best starting quarterback this year in my book.|`|9IyIO0Qkaa	i would have to say tony romo look how much better they where with him then with the old guy|`|07lMMwY8aa	Kurt Warner led his team to a super bowl trip that nobody thought he could|`|l7IdlcHSaa	oh got to say chad pennington|`|HMv6jvUCaa	Drew Brees<br>  <br>  He should have been MVP. He through for over 5,000 YARDS!<br>  <br>  At least the NFL didn't do him like they did Philip Rivers and sent him to the Pro Bowl|`|aZXnW6AUaa	I dont know the answer to the above question.|`|P1mf9Zzeaa	I'm gonna say Kurt Warner.  Yes, he has a great surrounding cast of receivers, but think of how much the completely abandoned the running game during this season.  He definitely has great receivers, but if he isn't making sound, intelligent decisions throwing the ball, then they don't go to the super bowl.  Also, consider how much it took for him to come back from basically being a back-up at best, to leading his team to within one minute of a super bowl championship.  There are people who had better years statistically, but based on everything he had to go through, I don't think it gets better than Kurt Warner for this season.|`|J74Y5LKxaa	If you're basing it on last seasons performance, then statistically it's a toss up between Phillip Rivers (who led the NFL with quarterback ratings and touchdowns thrown) and Drew Brees (who led the NFL with passing yards).

C4mzZwiWaa	point guard- The point guard, also known as the "1", is the team's floor general and the best ballhandler on the team. The point guard can also be called the basketball team's "quarterback". Essentially the team's captain, the point guard's job is to make his teammates better and hand out assists. Prime examples are Jason Kidd, Steve Nash, Chris Paul, Chauncey Billups and Derek Fisher. The point guard is typically the smallest player on the court. At the NBA level, most point guards are 6'1" to 6'3". Yet Earvin "Magic" Johnson from the Lakers became the NBA's tallest point guard standing 6'9".<br>  <br>  shooting guard- The shooting guard, also known as the "2", is usually the team's best shooter. A quality shooting guard should be able to consistently hit 20-foot/6-meter jump shots. Besides being able to shoot the ball, shooting guards must also have good ball-handling skills because they have to be able to create their own shot off the dribble. Finally, they should also be able to make good passes. The shooting guard needs to be able to take long-shots, around the 3-point line. This is because there will be much tighter defense inside the keyhole; thus, the Shooting Guard needs to learn how to get free for his shots. Typical NBA shooting guards are 6'4" to 6'7".<br>  <br>  For example, Kobe Bryant is arguably the NBA's current top shooting guard along with Dwayne Wade. Gilbert Arenas of the Washington Wizards has played both guard positions in his career (shooting guard and point guard). Perhaps the best example from history is Michael Jordan.<br>  <br>  small foward- The small forward, also known as the "3", is typically somewhat shorter, quicker, and leaner than power forwards and centers, but on occasion is just as tall. Thus, in the NBA, small forwards range from 6'6" to 6'11". The small forward position is considered to be perhaps the most versatile of the main five basketball positions, due to the nature of its role, which is sometimes similar to that of a power forward, and other times more resembles the role of a shooting guard.<br>  <br>  Small forwards have a variety of weapons, such as quickness and strength inside. One common thread between all kinds of small forwards is an ability to "get to the line", that is how opposing players called for committing shooting fouls against them, as fouls are frequently called on the defense when offensive players "take the ball hard" to the basket, that is, aggressively attempt post-up plays, lay-ups, or slam dunks. Therefore, accurate foul shooting is an imperative skill for small forwards, many of whom record a large portion of their points from the foul line. Small Forwards should be able to do a little bit of everything on the court.<br>  <br>  power foward- Also known as the "4" position and abbreviated as "PF." The power forward plays a role similar to that of the center, down in the "post" or "low blocks." On offense, he can "post up," playing with his back to the basket, or set up for mid-range jump shots. On defense, he plays under the basket in a zone defense or against the opposing power forward in man-to-man defense. Typical NBA power forwards are 6'9" to 6'11" tall, though some power forwards, like the 6'5" Charles Barkley, have compensated for a lack of height with exceptional bulk and strength. The greatest power forwards of all time include Tim Duncan and Karl Malone. Other examples include Dallas Mavericks' Dirk Nowitzki, the Utah Jazz's Carlos Boozer, the Boston Celtics' Kevin Garnett, the Phoenix Suns' Amar'e Stoudemire and the Toronto Raptors' Chris Bosh.<br>  <br>  center- The center, also referred to as the "5" or the "pivot", usually plays near the baseline, close to the basket (referred to as the "bottom of the key" or the "low post"). The tallest player is most likely to be assigned to the position of center, with typical NBA centers being about 7'0" in height. Some are much taller, like 7'6" Yao Ming. The center usually scores "down low, in the paint" (near the basket, in the key). Centers contribute to the team by using their physique and skill to score close to the basket, as well as gather both rebounds and "set the pick" in pick and roll plays. Some centers can be good perimeter shooters which can draw a good rebounding and shot-blocking center away from the basket.<br>  <br>  Yao Ming of the Houston Rockets is an example of a current elite center in the NBA. Shaquille O'Neal, Bill Russell, Hakeem Olajuwon, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Wilt Chamberlain are considered all-time greats at the center position.|`|GswnLKtQaa	point guard - playmaker/assist, shooting outside, transition defence.<br>  <br>  shooting guard - scorer, wing defender.<br>  <br>  small forward - wing defender, scorer, rebounder.<br>  <br>  powerforward - rebounding, guarding the post, scoring down the post.<br>  <br>  ceneter - defending the middle, shot blocking, rebounding. scoring inside.|`|kjJkQpzPaa	PG- to control the team.

A1eBCQziaa	Longboarding has different style. Downhill racing, cruising, sliding, and dancing. Board company i would recommend would be sector 9s which is beginner board but i never liked it, Loaded best company of all around board which no company can beat them, Landyachtz perfect Downhill boards, and the last sliding which Earthwing owns. I would go with some sector 9 boards if i was gonna spend around $150 to $200,but if you can use to $300 you can get some good boards and Loaded Dervish, Loaded Vanguard, Landyachtz Evo, and more.

dEXdm7Meaa	la respuesta pues es bastante sencilla la economia y la popularidad del deporte en ese pais por ejemplo las olimpiadas estan dominadas por las potencias como usa, russia, la creciente china, alemania etc, por que sus atletas son apoyados con fondos e instalaciones y paises que no tienen estos recursos usualmente no se destacan, otro ejemplo es el futbol en usa no se practica mucho y por eso no su nivel es decayente en cambio en italia por ejemplo es muy popular al igual que en el resto del mundoy hay mucha calidad, pero tambien tiene que ver estatura, tama?o, velocidad etc.|`|NxLWsSj8aa	porque en algunos casos se da un gran presupuesto para formar grandes atletas y salgan a competir y traigan muchos triunfos, en el caso de mexico al parecer solamente apoyan al futbol mayormente, tal vez a los demas deportes tambien pero muy poco y la mayoria de los competidores tienen que buscar sus propios recursos|`|0f70291541dd2daf3e71aeffcf8b7f7eaa	Porque tienen infraestructuras, organizaciones y culturas deportivas diferentes.<br>  1) Estados Unidos: Mucha organización, mucho dinero, poco talento (los mejores deportistas son de color o hijos de inmigrantes de otras naciones) = buenos resultados.<br>  2) Cuba: Nulo dinero, estricta disciplina y buen talento = Buenos resultados.<br>  3) México: Escaso dinero, cero disciplina, mínimo talento, excesiva propaganda = pésimos resultados.<br>  4) Brasil: Suficiente dinero, regular disciplina, mucho talento = suficientes buenos resultados.<br>  Así de fácil.<br>  El dia que entiendan que hay que ser generosos con el deporte en todo sentido, aun con poco talento, se pueden lograr muchas cosas buenas|`|78398c2658414f0c3750de48f5b99de3aa	Por la seriedad de sus instituciones y/o por la transparencia en sus manejos, lo cual crea una competencia sana y libre de intereses externos. En cambio hay otros que anteponen el $ y las palancas políticas y familiares o no?|`|eiVxJndOaa	bueno por lo poco que puedo saber se debe a que no todos los países cuentan con el apoyo de sus respectivas directivas deportivas  y son ellos quien terminan limitandose en obtener mejores resultados y otros por que les es mas importante poder sobrevivir y comer en aquellas naciones que tienen un grabe problema tanto económico como social. Bueno eso creo y si no es así, NO TOMES EN CUENTA ESTA RESPUESTA GRACIAS y suerte

Natürlich gibt es verst?rkte Tests, für die Fahrer, die in der Etappenwertung das Podest erreicht haben, sowie für mindestens 2 weitere zuf?llig ausgew?hlte Fahrer (Losverfahren).<br>  Die UCI kann nicht mehr machen, als das, was geschehen ist. Der Radsport ist darum so sauber wie nie, allerdings noch nicht vollst?ndig bereinigt.<br>  Fakt ist, dass die Tour wohl sauber wird, aber noch nicht alle 600 Pro-Tour-Fahrer, und auch noch lange nicht alle 4 Millionen ambitionierten Hobbyfahrer in Deutschland.

aImg4VPOaa	Weil es immer noch Leute gibt, die das interessiert - und vermutlich ist mit Werbeminuten (trotz ersatzlosen Wegfalls des Sponsorings) immer noch genug Geld zu verdienen. Leider lassen TV - übertragungen von Leistungssport keine überprüfung zu, ob der Konsum auch wirklich von einem Arzt mit Rezept verschrieben wurde. Aber wegen zu erwartender Nebenwirkungen kann man sich ja auch bei freiverk?uflichen oder illegal beschafften Medikamenten an einen Arzt oder Apotheker seiner Wahl wenden....|`|ad761f41c8eb8700ae15c6fd97f2d0beaa	Du sprichts von was, das ich gar nicht kenne.

Hat mich eh noch nie interssiert. Allerdings wird in jeder Sportart gedopt. Somit dürfte dann auch kein Fu?ball mehr übertragen werden und auch viele andere Sportarten nimmer. <br>  <br>  @Pascal natürlich werden jedem Asthma Kranken Asthmamittel verschrieben. Aber EPO hat sicher ned jeder 2. Mensch bekommen. Ich habe weder das eine noch das andere. Der Unterschied zum Sportler ist dann allerdings, dass es um Krankheiten geht und die keine Wettk?mpfe machen und dadurch die andern betrügen.|`|XXFVtGBQaa	tja... is ne gudde frage!!!<br>  <br>  aba wenn irh euch mal umguggt!!! in den anderen l?ndern wird das gar ncih so ernste gnommen... die meinen wir würden alles verderben!!! die sehen das wohl nicht so ernst!!<br>  <br>  ich werde mir die rollende apotheke auf jeden fall ncih anguggen... apotheken gibt es ja wie sand am meer!!!|`|lVlTgRyoaa	Schau, ich finde das dem ganzen Sport gegenüber nicht fair. Sicher, wir als Radsportler haben ein Problem, ein gro?es Problem, aber rollende Apotheken sind wir darum noch lange nicht. Ich wette zum Beispiel, dass etwa jedem zweiten Menschen irgendwann in seinem Leben mal EPO verschrieben wird, oder ein einfaches Asthma-Mittel. Diese Dinge stehen auf den Dopinglisten, darum drehen sich unsere Skandale. Jeder Mensch kann diese mehr oder weniger mit Rezept bekommen. Das ist alles keine Hexerei, die die Radporofis da t?tigen, sondern allt?gliche Mittel. Und manche Radporfis k?nnten die ja wirklich aus gesundheitlichen Gründen brauchen, wo man sie ihnen nicht verweigern kann.<br>  <br>  Zur Ursprungsfrage dann vielleicht noch: Interessierst du dich für Sport allgemein, oder liest du nur die BILD-Zeitung und ziehst da dein Wissen raus? Es geht darum, dass Sport grunds?tzlich dopinganf?llig ist. Ich betreibe schon l?nger Leistungssport, ohne angeben zu wollen auf ganz gutem Niveau, und ich wei?, dass der Zweite im Sport grunds?tzlich der erste Verlierer ist. Das muss sich meiner Meinung (im Sport!) nicht ?ndern, aber solange sich daran nichts ?ndert, wird gedopt werden - Nicht nur im Radsport.

W1Nyh393aa	Que no te confundan.<br>  <br>  El material más ligero es la fibra de carbono también llamado composite. Su inconveniente es el precio y el estandar de calidad, Se tienen que fabricar varias veces en el molde hasta que se consigue la norma. También es el más resistente a la fuerzas dinámicas. Al ser un material compuesto por varias capas de fibras en distintas direcciones, resiste y disipa las distintas fuerzas. El titanio es un poco más pesado que el aluminio y menos que el acero y es casi tan resistente como el carbono. Lo dificil es encontrar quién lo fabrique en los países pobres. El magnesio se usa en aleación de aluminio para los cuadros y se usa para las botellas de las suspensiones delanteras, en este caso se usa puro. La aleación con Mg pertenece a las series 6000 de aluminio. Aún así, el peso ligero no te ayuda mucho a mejorar tiempos ni a que la bicicleta se maneje mejor, pues esto depende de otros factores como aero y geometría. La ligereza ayuda en monta?a en las secciones donde la debes cargar. Es importante que si es de Al debe pasar por un termoproceso como el T9 que es un recocido por debajo del punto de fusión del Al, los puntos cercanos a las soldaduras cambian su resistencia con el calor del soplete de argón, por eso se recuece de nuevo el material.<br>  <br>  Lo último son los cuadros de aluminio con vainas traseras de carbón y suspension delantera hidraulica. La suspension trasera de gas, hidraulica o de resorte, restan potencia en los ascensos, por eso se usa una rígida de composite que mantiene el pedaleo pero amortigua los descensos e irregularidades.|`|I8UEshgBaa	Fibra de CARBONO|`|4gjJkGqOaa	es mas ligero la fibra de carbono, aunque el mas resistente es el titanio; paraw carreras monta?osas se usa la de carbono, para llano se usa la de titanio, y hasta hora me entero de que llevan magnesio; que yo sepa el otro metal que utilizan es el aluminio.|`|353d0698c82ab7524244c8edabae3d7baa	Hola ke tal.<br>  Pues si es para el cuadro de una bici, depende el tipo.<br>  Por lo general las de pista son de fibra de carbono, y en caso de que sea downhill lo mejor es el magnesio.<br>  Saludos.|`|83YLhCA4aa	es la fibre de carbono la de los ciclistas profesionales son asi<br>  salu2!|`|e2ad6913922ef831788dde3798c33e31aa	Segun el material más liviano es la fibra de carbono pero el carbono no es tan resistente entonces por eso muchas bicis son hechas en titanio junto con el carbono.|`|6KmCGXUsaa	Depende la resistencia el titanio es el mas resistente de los tres, la fibra de carbono mas lijero pero se da?a mas facilmente.|`|6ZfPEp79aa	En cuadros de bicis el unico que se puede utilizar solo el el de fibra de carbono, los otros dos se usan pero con aleaciones de alunimio, asimismo es el de fibra el mas ligero. tambien en cuadros se usan otros materiales como el cromo y el aluminio|`|8MLfqsVNaa	comprate una bici de aluminio color cromo tan chidas|`|GHT8E3pNaa	Creo que la fibra de carbón, según tengo enterado|`|IINlQECFaa	La verdad es que dependiendo el tipo de carbono y su resistencia es más ligero que uno de titaneo. <br>  <br>  Lo que pasa que el titaneo un inmensamente más resistente que el carbono, aluminio y acero.|`|PcSaqi6Iaa	La fibra de carbono es mas ligero|`|RqdZdNKcaa	el titanio es la mejor opcion, no lo dudes|`|YBtfLtYAaa	fibra de carbón pero la mas resistente en el titanio

TE6Ba7Spaa	Yahoo has a private keeper league that is available. It is a lot of work for the commish but if you want to do it, I would do some research on google. I just remember a couple things that you have to do for a yahoo league:<br>  <br>  1. You have to set up a message board for all the players and that is where you will draft you players.<br>  <br>  2. Each player has 24 hours to draft there player and when they draft there player, they have to include the round number, round pick etc.<br>  <br>  3. Once the draft is finally over, the commish will gather all the players and put them on a team based on who drafted them.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|vrzWPS7Iaa	yahoo but i think u have to wait till the playoffs registration is over, maybe MLB.com, ESPN.com, CBSsportsline.com
HMv6jvUCaa	thats just wrong|`|mTSOJKlyaa	well that pats fans say those type of things, and then wonder why everyone else in the league hates them|`|JhrdIVBgaa	That doesn't sound to good...<br>  Because... well I dont know... the Pats didn't even make the playoffs last year.<br>  Then the year before that....

NO SUPER BOWL APPEARENCE!!!!<br>  Maybe they're NOT A DYNASTY ANYMORE. They haven't won a super bowl in 4 years So you pats fans need to accept that the patriots aren't the best anymore.

What happened the last time the Patriots put their "star" QB on the bench and started some no name with little to no experience? <br>  <br>  Brady is done... but he still has more to offer than the other 18 starting QB's in the league... assuming he can recover from the injury.|`|JhrdIVBgaa	Probably every GM in the league, at least every smart one. Tom Brady is coming back from a huge injury that is VERY hard to come back from. Tom Brady will never be the same QB again.|`|2VGbJtnCaa	Steelers, Colts, Saints, Chargers, Ravens,|`|acaAycEXaa	Yes, about 7-8 of them.

HMv6jvUCaa	Patriots with a healthy Tom Brady|`|ULw1777caa	Steelers are repeating.  Pats suck.|`|XLXncQu9aa	Those are just odds.  The NFL has proven to be an unpredictable game.  No one picked the Cardinals to go to the super bowl this past season and I'm sure many picked the Panthers to go or Giants to repeat.  That didn't happen.  I think its way too early to predict.  We haven't even made it into the free agency period as of yet, we are just beginning.  Also the draft plays a big role in who could be successful.  But if I had to make a pick now, I'd say the Steelers make it back in the AFC and for the NFC it could be the Eagles if they get a third WR and shore up that defensive line.|`|1oj4aamaaa	Canton Bulldogs.|`|s9Pwnb87aa	The Browns if Brady "joe montana" Quinn stays healthy.|`|lPDHMOVZaa	Not the Patriots...|`|PMluTf72aa	i'm not sure yet, it's too early in the offseason to determine.  i see the Pats returning to the playoffs next season, but not the Super Bowl.  their defense is rebuilding.  i don't see the Giants being too hot either.  the possible loss of Plaxico Burress and Ahmad Bradshaw and Amani Toomer for sure hurts their offense significantly.  more importantly, their DC Spagnulo was the key to their defensive success, so the loss of him in my opinion is the dagger.  Cowboys....yeah, right. haha!  the Eagles could make a run, but with cancer hitting DC Johnson, how focused will he be this upcoming season?  honestly, it's way too early to tell and place any bets.  as of right now, the only team off hand i can think of is the Eagles, but i'm a bit weary on them too.  for the AFC, it's still wide open.  the Steelers certainly are a popular pick, but it's very difficult to repeat as Super Bowl Champs.|`|WaaFCtuOaa	I don't think it will be the Patriots & Tom Brady to me won't be the same dominating QB of a few years back & don't see the Eagles cause McNabb can't win the big game & Cowboys won't be there either since they can't win in the play offs but I would say the Steelers are the team to beat|`|bny7vsW5aa	Steelers with an Upgraded O-line and a healthy 1-2-3 punch of Parker, Moore, and Mendenhall.<br>  <br>  also, Limas Sweed grows some ballz and adds a Deep threat to Hines Ward and Santonio Holmes.|`|neWj7Fwjaa	I bought a ticket for the Cardinals last year and I will for sure buy another one for the Cards this year, except this year I'll put more down on it.|`|q9D1mCJnaa	The NY giants will be repeating against the same team they played last year|`|acaAycEXaa	You and the cheating Pats* can kiss my butt!|`|5B6w8mxVaa	cowboys *****.
a7IuQoUfaa	What type of offense do you play in college? What is it based around? Being the best TE doesn't always mean you get the most catches & TD's. Run..alot! But keep your size, you have a big frame which QB's like in the clutch. Practice on your catching..all the obvious advise. Work on becoming the best pass/run blocker you can be! This is huge as a TE. If you can help protect the pocket or make holes for the run, the NFL will see it & be more willing to take a shot on you, rather than the TE who breaks out every snap on a route.<br>  Look at Raymond Berry. The smallest most unlikely widout does spectacular..why, because he studied his favorite recievers & how they ran there routes. You could do this with your personal favorite TE's. Look at Antonio Gates & Jason WItten. Both are great & it's not like they're the only play makers on the team which means it's not that the QB has no other option. Like Tony Gonzalez, he's good, but how many other options are out on the field anyway.. I'd say learning the playbook is the most important. If you can adapt quickly to the plays & be a versital TE who can not only break out with burst & juke on routes, but stay in for the block, you'll be **** good.<br>  The best ever... now that's something you have to aim for, nobody can give you that.|`|wtKc33fPaa	Eat drink and sleep it' Practice, pratice And Practice

Oltre a pato, io avrei trattato anche pasqual, che per il gioco del milan sugli esterni andrebbe bene, un cenrale (vedi Criscito). Però è anche vero che le Champions si vincono con i 30enni....inoltre è stato ancelotti che ha manifestato un maggiore apprezzamento per i giocatori "esperti" piuttosto che per i giovani...quindi la società segue questa politica...Poi veder giocare ancora maldini o costacurta (quando giocava ancora) secondo me è una cosa a dir poco vergognosa, per quanto abbiano dato al milan.<br>  Cmq il milan deve davvero iniziare a sfoltire almeno i vecchi superiori ai 33-34 anni ed iniziare a comprare qualcuno che alla lunga rende. Ma se non si inizia al più presto, sarà troppo tardi.<br>  La juve ha già iniziato....<br>  <br>  Luca|`|eCw9FJ39aa	Per la serie B fan sempre comodo giocatori d`esperienza|`|gPeyAERNaa	oltre all'età, il problema è che non abbiamo delle seconde linee all'altezza... se manca un titolare non sappiamo chi mettere...<br>  per esempio l'altra sera in champions avevamo un po' di problemi, avevamo bisogno di qualche forza fresca che desse maggior spinta alla manovra e non avevamo 1 attaccante che fosse 1 (va beh, a parte gilardino)in panchina... abbiamo dovuto mettere quel brocco di gourcuff...<br>  non è possibile continuare così!|`|iB3PLQseaa	SAREBBE ORA|`|AxRcNOpWaa	rispetto a berlusconi so' giovanotti......|`|WVEGi8d2aa	sarebbe anche ora....i nonni non possono mica giocare una partita ogni 3 giorni!!....alcuni di loro dovrebbero andare in pensione subito e senza una lira,o meglio euro, in tasca!!!!|`|f163ab16b6a27f8a4e6f8a63eaa2c44faa	sicuramente al Milan, ogni volta che fanno il raduno a luglio, oltre alle visite mediche, fanno la revisione e mettono il bollino blu ai giocatori.|`|0b937d7b2c70fc8d05cba30940df5198aa	E' il problema che da anni il Milan si porta dietro, lo scorso anno la vittoria sul Liverpool ha hatto credere al buon Galliani che la squadra avesse bisogno più di Ba che di un Mexes (per fare un nome).<br>  Ora loro ossono dire: abbiamo preso Pato, mi starebbe anche bene, ma il Milan ora, se non investte davvero nel futuro,  come convincerà un Kakà a rimanere con un organico del genere.<br>  Solo Ronaldo ha un'attenuante dato il suo infortunio, ma in linea generale ci vorrebbe un anno di transizione, forse addirittura sacrificando lo stesso Kakà.<br>  Per di più il vivaio del Milan, eccezion fatta per Marzoratti (che ancora deve dimostrare moltissimo in serie A) e Nicola Pozzi (ma non è del vivaio rossonero), giocatori futurabili non se ne vedono.<br>  Ora il Milan dovrà necessariamente tornare ad investire ed anche pesantemente perché i Gattuso, gli Oddo, i Nesta non durano 1000 anni.<br>  Io credo che, se il Real offrisse € 80.000.000,00, il Milan potrebbe anche cedere Kakà per investire pesantemente in estate, se non già a Gennaio.<br>  Ciao!|`|BofbwF98aa	ma che aspettano a rinfoltire la rosa con dei giovani??oltre che il milan li ha lasciati andare via,ragazzi come foggia,marzorati,lo stesso donadel,e poteva tranquillamente comprarne qualcuno,tra cui anche un portiere da lanciare in orbita...se poi come dice __Alex__,x galliani l'età media è bassa,allora veramente nn ci capisco più nulla sulle strategie di mercato del milan..che aspettano che arrivino tutti a 40??nn si chiamano tutti maldini eh...e cmq mi dispiace vedere una squadra che stimo x il bel gioco,in questa situazione delicata..spero ne venga fuori al più presto..|`|d8PrPsP9aa	Galliani ha detto che il Milan non ha assolutamente un'età media troppo alta !

k2AmQylBaa	it means the weightlifting machines, rather than the free weights like bench press, squats and dumbells|`|AA11221900	Machine based or with the help of weight reducing or improving machines which are equipment moved in the performance of an exercise which is not simply raised and lowered as a complete unit.

5RqvVmKaaa	He scores some and he misses some. He hasn't the touch of some like Henry or Rooney, but his touch isn't so bad. Although last night his touch certainly meant he missed one goal from a header when he should have scored, and he lost contact the ball in the penalty area with a heavy touch on another occasion when he should have made himself an excellent chance. I hear many battering him for his self-confidence in himself, but maybe his confidence in himself at least keeps him able to function at his best when all about him are getting at him. He wasn't at his best last night though.|`|oPYw0QYqaa	No he is not bad because he is a Professional footballer... but compared to 90% of the other strikers in the prem...........

s3E2qPvjaa	Not too import I think.<br>  <br>  Remember 1998? That year they started back quite a few games and ended up having the best year ever.<br>  <br>  What I think is most important is that the team gels well and they just really try to kick every teams ***. 1998 was a great yea.|`|RK4jUtqgaa	It's huge! The media already has them winning the World Series, just like Detroit last season. The Tigers started out losing their first seven games and never recovered.<br>   The "great" players that they traded for--Cabrera, Renteria, and Willis--weren't really a factor, though Cabrera finally found his stroke, and age and injuries took a toll on the rest of the team.<br>  Now you have the Yankees who are the designated juggernaut in the AL after signing three players, and the similarities are downright eerie.<br>  Sabathia was mediocre before leaving Cleveland for the playoff race last season, Burnett is an injury waiting to happen, and Teixeira is a notorious slow starter. Factor in Matsui's knee injuries, Wang's comeback, Hughes/Kennedy trying to rebound plus the whole A-Roid soap opera and the title is far from guaranteed.<br>  New York has overspent on free agents before, only to see them tank, so unless they get off to a good start and then maintain the pace they'll find themselves looking up at Tampa Bay and Boston by September.|`|XLGFlsC7aa	I'd have to say it's quite important for reasons outside the ridiculous payroll. As long as it's owned by George and his boys the payroll will be huge as will the expectation to win. That being said, they open the season with 9 games on the ROAD! 6 of those 9 are division opponents including the AL Champion Rays. Like you said, you don't want to fall behind early and divisional games provide such risk. They gotta win and get that SWAGGER back! Starting strong certainly will help and should lead to a crazy crowd at their home opener in their new stadium!|`|yM8NiXmLaa	It is very important. Look at all the money the Yanks spent during the off season (Sabathia, Texeira, Burnett, etc.).  Lets not forget about the 275 million dollar man A-Rod. With all of his scandals recently he needs a good start. If they don't than then they will get booed by the impatient yankee fans and it won't look good.|`|7meJphJMaa	Very. <br>  Every year they fall back early and end up with a tight race in the end. If the can get off to a fast start this year, they should win the division easily.|`|s2vuUtRUaa	If your name is Joe Girardi then it's very important. The Yankees are a good team this year and should make it to the World Series.|`|wd9EPcGWaa	Yea,  the biggest thing is to not fall too  far back early|`|W44q5AUhaa	depends. i just want us to start and finish strong! that would be lovely.|`|33f4c852804fa42db9a7cbb912480080aa	Well, they're pretty good at creeping up on the Red Sox...and vice versa...the Red Sox are good at creeping up on the Yankess too...I wouldn't say that ANY lead is safe between the 2 until the final weekend series of the season...<br>  <br>  And, it will be interesting to see if Tampa Bay is really good or if last season was kind of a fluke...|`|eac78f41a64d286478c23785cf30be23aa	I'd say it was more important for Girardi than for the team as a whole.<br>  <br>  If Torre were still there, I'd say "not very important," but Hank is starting to look like Dad in the Billy Martin Era and I can see him getting jittery....and you have to think a chunk of the press corps already has their "Worst Team Money Could Buy" stories ready to go.  If they're under .500 in April, can't you just see guys like Mike Lupica lobbying for a replacement like Don Mattingly or Paul O'Neil to sell some more newspapers?|`|frDcAqyWaa	It'll be important for the Yankees to not have alot of pitching injuries like they have had the last few seasons b/c that taxes the bullpen/staff and overexposes the pitchers. If they dont' start out fast it shouldn't be a huge problem as long as the pitchers are healthy.|`|2ISGwSK7aa	Not as important as it is for AROD, Mark Teixeira, CC Sabathia, and AJ Brunett to get off to really good starts. Especially AROD.<br>  <br>  The Yanks should worry about how the finish the season as well. You know the Sawx got those chumps!|`|NpqAbZqpaa	I guess it depends on whether you are in favour of the Yankees succeeding or not.  Personally, I'd like them to start the season 18-36.|`|AYiVipawaa	it's more important that mark teixeira gets good no too late
a611e715d5b36bde1095ea94f48e8d61aa	Hi Rachel,<br>  <br>  Cutler, IMO, is the better starting option of the two, but be prepared for some rough scoring weeks.  Both Cutler and Pennington, IMO, should be backups, not your starter(s).<br>  <br>  I don't know the other players you have, but I would try to make a deal.  If you have a decent starting #1 WR, I would make a run at someone like Carson Palmer or Brees.  I also think Jon Kitna will have a big year and he would come a lot cheaper.|`|AA12200210	Do it!<br>  <br>  You may get a solid running back like Tomlinson or at least Larry Johnson.|`|AA11868377	YES ESPECIALLY CUTLER......ID GO FOR A DARK HORSE LIKE CULPEPPER....OR GO FOR LEINART.|`|AA10244874	You should definitely do that.  Neither of your players a top tier QB's.  Pennington will improve this year with the addition of Thomas Jones and Cutler may or may not live up to the hype.  You might as well see what's out there.|`|KJrk2gTOaa	Tony Romo|`|wan4v6Cgaa	oh yeah,  I would try to dish off Pennington.

1a17e73a07a2c5ebb65e5750cb7c97faaa	I know that Greg Biffle did but I don't believe Jamie was offered an extension last year.  I will double check that.<br>  edit:  According to the team chart at jayski.com both Jamie and David Ragan's contracts are through this year.  They are usually pretty good about updating that when contracts are changed or extended.<br>  4's FINE N 09!!!!|`|wMHw20WPaa	nope did not|`|5d77c66b171b12a5932576b2dc7b7dd3aa	No, but he will before this season is up.|`|71c0e431058e396595b5a2772f5b2d6faa	Unfortunately he did not. Matt Kenseth, Carl Edwards and Greg Biffle did. The only two Roush drivers that did not are Jamie McMurray and David Ragan, which were the two that everybody guessed would be up for removal anyways. I hope that Jamie is not the one to move, but thats is just myself being biased and wanting Jamie to be on a top tier team.|`|IrGapExUaa	No he didn't. and If I"m right i believe  his sponsor Irwan Tools Contract is up at the end of the season too. Jamie McMaury will be out of Roush racing next season but I do believe he will be driving the #26 for RYR as there 4th team. #26,#28,#96#98 for RYR next season. David Regan is young and UPS just signed on to be his sponsor so i dont see him getting let go. sorry McMaury fans.|`|xTTP2Bv8aa	no he did not Edwards, Biffle and Kenseth all signed, that leaves Jamie Mac and David Ragan to be decided who leaves at years end.|`|4uf044sFaa	I am the biggest Roush fan in the world, and I try and keep up with the updates as best as I can.  From what I have seen and heard so far, Kenseth, Edwards, and Biffle all signed contracts last season.  That leaves McMurray and Ragan.  Ragan is fairly new and has been improving every season.  McMurray has been around for a while and still hasn't really shown full potential although he ended last season on a strong run.  I saw where one guy said something about Roush's wife.  I haven't heard that yet.  As of right now from what I have heard recently is that McMurray will go to Yates next year and Ragan will stay.  If McMurray runs good this year, I'm sure Roush will figure out something to keep McMurray with Roush some way or another.|`|JoYgUIeqaa	No he did not sign an extension.  This is his last year on his contract.  I try to follow what is going on with him because hes from the same town that i live in.|`|sGrrbz1aaa	look for jamie mac to be driving with yates next year...bur we all know that roush and yates are one and the same...just like hendricks and tony stewarts team...hendricks is the main supporter of the stewart|`|p8JfOlTzaa	No, he will be driving for Roush's wife next year probably.  The rule is a terrible one because it's not very specific.  Who knows who owns the cars?

2blkKneeaa	Todo mundo quiere ser corredor o quarterback  y de lo que se trata es de jugar fútbol, de gozarselo, así que primero tienes que tener muy claro si tus aptitudes físicas te dan para ser ofensivo o defensivo, si puedes jugar en la linea o en el backfield,<br>  <br>  por ejemplo creo que debes decirme en el equipo cual es el promedio de peso y estatura de la linea o de los corredores o de los receptores o backs defensivos<br>  <br>  si encajas en uno de esos patrones y además eres muy agresivo puedes ser defensivo pero de corredor no basta con ser ágil recuerda que se requiere empuje y tener un excelente arranque además de buenos cortes sin contar la velocidad en campo abierto<br>  <br>  lo importante es que te reportes en un campo de entrenamiento y seguro los coaches te dirán para que posición puedes ser útil.<br>  <br>  te cuento yo jugué mi primer a?o con banca y todo de qb pero al siguiente a?o me decidí por ser receptor, es delicioso atrapar un pase e  irse corriendo buscando el endzone, así jugué bastante a?os y realmente no me arrepiento<br>  <br>  suerte y gozate este bello deporte que exige muchos sacrificios|`|00e4422d785e00ea47c495f94da99819aa	estas bajito... pero el que quiere jugar lo logra en este deporte y delgado, de corredor es buena eleccionpero depende de tu vision de campo, ahora tambien podias jugar de profundo y dar beunos golpes. pero no te apures entrena y el coach te dara tu lugar<br>  <br>  saludos|`|98bdb533825542ec49e4a45bd14e20bfaa	Por tu estatura (eres más alto que el promedio de los chavos de 14 y 15 a?os) y características, en lo personal creo que podrías probar ya sea como receptor (flanquer) o como profundo o safety.<br>  <br>  Lo que es casi un hecho, es que los coaches verán tus aptitudes y procurarán aprovechar tus cualidades en la posición que mejor puedas desempe?ar según las necesidades del equipo, y tal vez no sea la que tienes en mente en primera instancia, pero cuando sientes pasión por este deporte puedes jugar en tres o cuatro posiciones distintas, ya sea en la ofensiva o defensiva, y en cada asignación partirte el alma. Saludos...|`|27366d7930314fe006a4cb138b53b01daa	ME LATES PARA RECEPTOR O PERIMETRO PERO DE HECHO LO QUE MAS IMPORTA ES LO QUE TU QUIERAS HACER TENGO 23 TEMPORADAS JUGADAS Y ME HE DADO CUENTA QUE LO QUE MENOS IMPORTA EN EL AMERICANO ES EL TAMA?O ESTE DEPORTE ES DE HU....<br>  <br>  SUERTE AMIGO SI TIENES DUDA DE CUALQUER COSA PREGUNTAMELO CON CONFIANZA|`|6a9a2dcf90c138409d9b1a5f9977bf12aa	Umm, como dice uno arriba debes checar la estatura promedio, un QB debe ser alto para poder ver toda la linea defensiva y lanzar por encima de ellos, además agil de mental y fisicamente. Un liniero es pesado y fuerte, un linebacker es fuerte, agil, inteligente y rápido. Los Receptores son buenos con las manos, rápidos y agiles. Así que lo que queda es pateador, debes tener buena patada, esquinero o profundo, rapido y brincar alto, corredor, hay de dos tipos, el agil y el fuerte. Segun yo esas son tus opciones.|`|eCrU1xgNaa	Pues mira yo te recomendaría que si te propones jugar de corredor lo hagas, aunque puedes también jugar de receptor o en el backfield. Yo jugué en estas posiciones y la verdad no me quejo, y la complexión que dices es más o menos la mía. Mi posición favorita es la de corner, te la recomiendo mucho.|`|0646e5cef55b99893798d64d786910f7aa	hola.<br>   no mencionas si te gusta más construir (ofensiva) que destruir (defensiva), pero supongo que te gusta más la ofensiva, me parece que debes considerar otras posiciones, ir probando pues, en cual te acomodas más, en cual te diviertes más, en cual le puedes rendir más a tu equipo, y también debes considerar el numero de compa?eros que tendrás en cada posición. aun así me parece buena elección la de corredor, pero analizando tus características físicas, bien podrías desempe?ar te muy bien como receptor, esquinero o safety, mucha suerte y éxito.|`|703cee5794b6290b5ccf1230783edb50aa	Pues mira, tecnicamente puedes jugar de cualkier cosa... muxas veces más vale ma?a ke fuerza, siendo mui estrictos i haciendole caso a los estereotipos podrías jugar de safety, de corner, receptor, o corredor, si juegas de safety a mi forma de verlo debes tener mui wena velocidad, por akeio de ke serías el ultimo hombre a vencer entre la defensa i la endzone, de corner ocupas muxos reflejos i agilidad, ademas de velocidad, de receptor cuenta ke tan alto puedes saltar, la velocidad es imprescindible i la seguridad de tus manos también, i de corredor, alguien de tus características físicas necesita tener mui wena velocidad, agilidad i elusividad, además de saber proteger mui bien el balón, de lo contrario los defensivos facilmente podrían provocar fumbles al golpearte fuertemente.<br>  <br>  Esa es mi opinión, pero vale la pena intentar en cualkier otra posición, mirame a mi, io mido 1.77, peso cerca de 100 kilos i andaba de corredor jejeje (hey, si Jerome Bettis pudo hacerlo, por ke io no??)|`|QWnMDDw8aa	Bueno por lo regular todos cuando juegan quieren ser de los distinguidos así que por tus datos yo te recomendaría que pruebes de receptor pero igual debes ver que tal eres a la hora de agarrar los pases, ahora ya se ve mucho que los corredores (haff) pues ya son delgados entonces también debes probar que tan hábil eres con el balón y que nivel de golpeo tienes pero si quieres ser defensivo prueba de corner o safety de preferencia el robert es cuestión de que cheques tus habilidades pero echale ganas en cualquier posición que te toque|`|hMu19lPdaa	Mira, por las caracteristicas fisicas que mencionaste tienes las caracteristicas de un corredor. Todos tenemos un centro de gravedad, es la cintura y ahi es donde se busca tacklear. Si mides 1.67 esta bien porque tienes el centro de gravedad mas abajo que los demas y por lo tanto eres mas dificil de tacklear, y agregale el que eres rapido y agil y te va a ayudar mucho a la hora de escapar y esquivar tackleadores. Ve a youtube.com y busca videos de Barry Sanders y verás que lo que te digo es verdad y te puede ayudar mucho. <br>  <br>  Nota. Va a ser mejor para ti si los demas jugadores sean mas altos. En el futbol americano dicen que la estatura es crucial pero en realidad no, los mejores corredores hoy en dia son bajos de estatura en comparacion a los demas jugadores.

skgN9TJLaa	You should use the running machine will burn more calories & lose more weight. You won't lose weight specifically in one area but a treadmill is a good leg workout as is an exercise bike.|`|X4VrAdyYaa	Speed walk. Treadmill gave me shin splints for two days once.|`|c2666c20df7b27c2859938d7ac3b140daa	Its a tricky question to answer. Neither exercise will build muscles in your legs (you will need to do some sort of resistance training (weights) for that), so no worries about getting thicker legs.<br>  <br>  Getting thinner legs depends why your legs are too big in your mind - if its muscle or fat. If its fat then general work outs will do that - you can't loose fat from a specific part of your body by working that part, the fat will go from all over. What you can do is look on the machine itself, many have calorie counters on them and you can see how many you use in 30 minutes running and how many in 40 minutes walking - compare the 2 and see which is better.|`|4EBBDq3Maa	speed walk, i've been on tredmills before and you can keep it up for longer ;)
Lv89kHKpaa	Yeah especially with all the wrestlers just watching it like a schoolyard brawl.|`|GExKoh1Gaa	it wasn't that great but it was a new and interesting way to end raw..wether you dont like triple h or orton,such an ending will spark anyones interest.<br>  shame though they have to hold back because of the "PG" thing.<br>  <br>  i remember the last time triple h smashed in a car window that was against nature boy and was more believable..overall the segment  should have been more brutal.|`|SXRdNW80aa	It was cool. We were at the show and watched them tape that segment before the show had started. I was impressed with how fast they shot that whole scene, it took less than 10 minutes.|`|PGvjEvjMaa	i would love to see orton punt hhh into an eternal coma|`|uqIhD61caa	It was a really good segment. The hype they're having for this feud is amazing. They haven't even had Orton mention challenging for the WWE Title yet. Kudos to WWE and I hope they continue to entertain us.|`|VU6ODC5Baa	Yeah,it was entertaining.|`|4dcc7a13dff77b8bf33c417ceb3b776aaa	Yes.  I hope to see Triple H smash more things with his sledgehammer next week.|`|x4CDslrDaa	Me and my heart we got issues...|`|4c479c9c27bebd404d7ba657763fe54faa	It was a good produced segment.

KdhNCnEjaa	You forgot Louisville and Marquette, both top 10 teams in the country!<br>  <br>  West Virginia needs one more good win<br>  <br>  Georgetown is on the bubble, no guarantees there. Same with Syracuse but not a that level.<br>  <br>  Providence, Notre Dame, and Cincinnati all need more wins to get in, plus a strong showing in the Big East tourney.|`|QmUbe395aa	7|`|wd9EPcGWaa	Plus maybe syracuse and possibly nd|`|diiVgUD9aa	Pitt- 1 seed<br>  L-Ville- 1 seed<br>  Uconn<br>  Golden Eagles<br>  Nova<br>  Orange<br>  WVU<br>  <br>  so that would make 7|`|08haRGQxaa	I say 10.. and there is no way at all Georgetown is going to make it.

RLaE6zRbaa	Se vuoi fare stile americanata, devi mettere un po' di R&B o hip hop. Vai sul tipo 'lil john, ja rule, 50cent, 2Pac, P.Diddy, Jay-z e se vuoi anche Missy Elliott. Basta che provi ad ascoltarne un po' di questo tipo ne trovi una marea!!!

Affrontare azzurri nervosi farebbero il loro gioco. <br>  <br>  Quindi, siamo nel campo del banale.<br>  E mi fa piacere che il team non abbocchi.<br>  <br>  Banale anche che Domenech sia arrivato a farsi sanzionare (per mano del proprio connazionale Michel Platini).

kHjd3Dbiaa	Spirit Chain Fundraising<br>  This is a great fundraiser for high school students, but could be used with other groups. Have a competition within the different classes in the school (senior, junior, sophomore, freshmen) to see who has the most school spirit. Each class has two colors that their paper chain consists of. Sell each strip of paper for 25 or 50 cents. Keep the chains hidden and then at an assembly have class representatives bring out the huge paper chains that have accumulated over time. Which ever class’ chain is the longest receives bragging rights for the rest of the school year. This is a great activity to do right before homecoming or other school functions when school spirit is high. The only thing you have to pay for is the paper and staples/glue/tape.<br>  Mall Coat Check Fundraising<br>  <br>  Between Thanksgiving and Christmas, my nephews basketball team went to the local mall every weekend. They had arranged with the mall management company for an area to have a coat check. Stores in the mall donated the temporary use of racks to hang the coats on and a secured area for people to leave packages, etc. They handed out a "coat check" ticket and shoppers left their coats, mittens, etc with them while they shopped. The asked for a minimum donation of $1 for the service. They were able to raise thousands of dollars with very little upfront cost. The only thing they had to pay for were rolls of tickets that you can buy at any office supply store, and they even got a parent to donate that. It was a very easy and profitable fund raiser that the kids had to work to get the money for their program.<br>  <br>  Contributed by Linsey B.<br>  Stair Climb Fundraising<br>  Almost 1,000 climbers in Calgary Canada, made the 12th annual thigh-testing trek up Calgary Tower's 27 flights of stairs to raise $75,000 in pledge money to help the Alberta Wilderness Association protect the environment. Another 60 people ran one kilometer around the tower before climbing the local landmark in the first annual Running Room Run for Wilderness. The fastest person to finish the run and climb reached the top in eight minutes and 56 seconds. The record is 30 for the most climbs up the tower during the five-hour fundraiser. Many eased the burden by tugging on the sturdy steel railing, while others stopped on landings decorated with scenic murals and talked to volunteers ready to help them if they felt sick.<br>   <br>   Carnival Fundraising<br>  My helping hands club wanted to host a fundraising event that also included community involvement. That is why we hosted the WINTER CARNIVAL at one of the local elementary schools. First of all announce in your school what clubs would like to participate in such activity. From then on announce that the clubs participating will be able to keep whatever profits they make at the carnival. Hold the fundraising carnival in an open space or the gym or auditorium at school and place the booths all over the place with enough space for people to walk by. <br>   <br>   <br>  <br>  The booths can consist of simply an arrangement of tables with poster boards on the side of your table advertising what your booth is all about. Advertise as well to the community!!! Get permission from local libraries, schools, and businesses to see if you can post up posters and flyers asking your community to drop by. Our booths included friendship bracelets, pie in the face, face painting, tattoos, candy sweets, picture with Santa, etc. Be creative! If High School juniors like myself could achieve this then there are endless possibilities as to what YOU can do.<br>  <br>  Dog Walk Fundraising<br>  Call it what you will – Strut Your Mutt, Jog Your Dog, Canine Constitutional, Paws in the Park, Wag and Walk. A sponsored pet walk where the walkers (and their pets) solicit donations for how far they walk. Or, fundraising participants pay a set fee to enter and walk their dog. OR, bring homeless dogs who need walking. Remember the pooper scoopers. This could culminate in a pet talent show or some other event where you solicit additional donations. Use it to present spay/neuter message, or message of finding homes for all the homeless ones. Ask people to sponsor a homeless dog to see how many laps (limit of four?) he can do. <br>   <br>   <br>  Very funny with puppies, who have their own agenda. Or, sponsor a dog who wants to walk his person? You could do a cute turn-around, with advertising that promotes "walking your person" and that explains that this is good for your "person's" health. Relays and races, booths for snacks, kennel rentals for dogs while people do their own things. Remember to try to get lots of vendors, even yard sale table type vendors, exhibits, dog wash and a vaccination clinic. Have a yard sale area where you rent spaces out-lined in chalk. Food booths for people and dogs. Organize an interesting route for dogs and their owners to walk around, with all participants sponsored. Take a synonym of walk and add something to it. Re-member you can change the verb case. <br>  <br>  Name ideas (some are just verbs you can add to): Paws Forward, Canine Cruise, Paws on the Pavement, Outward Hound, Bassett Waddle, Poodle Perambulation, Pooch Patrol, Walk and Wag, Million Mutt March, Mutt March, Samoyed Saunter, Canine Swagger, Puppy Parade, Hound Hike, Tramp with Your Pet, Pace With Your Pooch, The Puppy Path, Sidewalk of Many Dog Poops, Labrador Lane, Fido's Footpath.<br>    To really increase your fundraising turnout, name a dog "Naked" and get a local celebrity (television or radio personality, sports star, public official, etc) to "Walk Naked in the park at a designated time." Advertise the heck out of that. <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>   Source: ShelterFundraising<br>  <br>   <br>  Donation Container Fundraising<br>  This is a straightforward cash collection fundraising at local merchants. Here's what you do. Save old coffee cans and cover them in bright color paper with your organization's name and logo prominently displayed. A catchy slogan never hurts. Visit all local merchants and ask if you can leave a can at their cash register.  Don't forget to visit all participating local merchants once a week and collect all proceeds. Your organization gets 100% of the profit. <br>   <br>   <br>  <br>  Specify on the can where fundraising donations will specifically go.  Example: "to purchase school supplies for under privileged children".  This helps those donating feel like they can associate their donation with an ongoing program, and if it happens to be one that warms their heart, they'll be more likely to give!<br>  <br>  There are several commercial companies who sell fundraising donation containers in different materials and styles. They look "nicer" but reduce your profits.  However, the printed labels can help 'legitimize' your drive.  People tend to believe printed labels mean what they say. <br>  <br>  Pajama Day Fundraising<br>  Students pay $.50 to $1.00 on a designated day and get to wear their pajamas to school.  It's a very easy fundraising idea.  All you need is someone to go the classrooms and collect the money.  Everyone at our school likes it so much that even the teachers participate! Consider having a contest for the ugliest, weirdest, etc. pajamas.  <br>   <br>   <br>  Source: Anna T, Cypress Elementary (Kissimmee, Florida)<br>  <br>   <br>  Fake Election Fundraising<br>  The city of Baytown, Texas, held a fake race for mayor, in which dollars counted as votes to receive the honorary title of Mayor of Downtown Baytown. The candidate who placed second, was named mayor pro tem, and the top five runner-ups were named to the mock City Council. <br>  <br>  <br>  Scrabble Tournament Fundraising<br>  Scrabble is all about being fluent in the language and coming up with words that might be worth a lot of points. People have fun coming up with strange and exotic words no one else has thought of.  Teams of four, six, or eight gather at different tables, each with a Scrabble board and all the letters available. Each team starts with the same opening word, and has 20 minutes to fill the board with high-scoring words. A judge sits at each table. Individuals pay $35 to participate. Players can sneak a peek at a dictionary for an additional $10 donation. Make extra fundraising money selling refreshments, raffle, auction, etc. Additional details and ideas available from the National Scrabble Association.<br>  <br>  Target's Take Charge of Education  Fundraising<br>  Every time you use your Target Visa or Target Guest Card? at a Target store or target.com, Target will donate an amount equal to 1% of Target Visa and Target Guest Card purchases made at Target and target.com, and 1/2% of Target Visa purchases made elsewhere, to the eligible K-12 school of your choice. Thanks to the Target School Fundraising program, more than 114,000 schools have been able to pay for computers, playground equipment, field trips and uniforms for students whose families couldn't afford them. (Details a target.com.)<br>  <br>  Sticky Fly Fundraising<br>  A friend and I came up with this one a few years ago for Child Abuse Prevention Month (which happens to be April). Find a popular teacher willing to participate. You'll also need lots of duct tape. Post flyers around the school a week ahead of time advertising your fundraiser. On the appointed day, during lunch hours, find a spot where students and faculty pass by regularly. Set a chair up against a wall so that the side of the chair (NOT the back or front, otherwise it won't work right) is firmly against the wall. Place a couple of gym mats or cushions in front of the chair as a precaution. Have the teacher stand up on the chair with his/her back against the wall. For fifty cents per yard of duct tape, students and faculty can tape the teacher to the wall. When the teacher is firmly taped to the wall, stop selling tape. Announce that you will now remove the chair to see just how long the "fly" can stick to the wall. <br>   <br>   <br>  <br>  If you want to, before removing the chair, take bets on how long the teacher will remain on the wall. It makes the game even more interesting for everyone. When my friend and I did it, we raised nearly $1000. We also spoke to our respective health classes about child abuse and the effects of it. Students and teachers alike donated more during class. Out of both classes, we made nearly $500 total. We also earned a spot on the school news show. We donated the money to the Lewis House, which is a home for women and children who have been abused. In addition to the school news show, we also earned a column in the Community Action Council (they run the Lewis House) newsletter.<br>  <br>  Sticky Fly is a great way to involve the students and faculty in a fun and engaging activity, and to raise awareness at the same time. <br>  <br>  Submitted By: Heather G.<br>  <br>   Slave Sale Fundraising<br>  In a high school for a senior fundraising idea is to have the senior class auction themselves off to an underclassman for around $15.  Each senior gets an underclassman who can dictate what they do for an entire day.  The senior has to carry the underclassman's books, get them food at lunch, and the senior has to wear whatever the underclassman wants.  This is a great fundraising event that not only brings in money for the senior class but brings together the school, it's inevitable that you'll get to know the person making you wear a batman cape and beanie hat for a day.  <br>    <br>  <br>  Business Alternative: A "Slave Sale" is usually a good fund-raiser. Local businesses are invited to a dinner at a specific location. As much of the dinner as possible is donated. Charge a $5.00 fee (or whatever you feel is appropriate) at the door. After dinner, each person in the group raising the funds is auctioned off to the highest bidder to complete 8 hours of work at his/her place of business. After the auction, the bidder meets with the person he/she "bought" to arrange a day for him/her to be at work. Obviously, the bidder cannot ask the person bought to do anything illegal.<br>  <br>  Sources: Emily J. & Walt A.<br>  <br>   <br>  Hope these help!|`|AA10560773	Car Wash, and a 50/50 cash money raffle.

Horry will go down for his clutch play and no one in the NBA will remember him for a stupid flagarant foul. Spurs fan should acknowledge him for all he has done and for being a great player who has won championships in three locations and not for a foul. If I was Horry I would be ashame of those fans for their ignorance.

MJ3Qf0rpaa	Some indoor fields normally the ones with boards have a green carpet like material, 11v11 indoor fields can also have the carpet material but most have turf.

Some are hardwood floors like you find in a gym, and I've even seen some indoor fields that were covered in hard rubber mats. Some were even just green indoor/outdoor carpet covering a concrete floor.|`|rPMFjeV8aa	Well, they both lack cleats/studs. An indoor shoe is lightweight and has a flat rubbery bottom - its generally worn for indoor flat courts and indoor astroturf. A turf shoe is harder and has a molded bottom of various raised surfaces and patterns for gripping - its generally worn on harder outdoor surfaces and on outdoor astroturf. What's interesting is that many indoor fields wont let you wear turf shoes because the raised patterns can be alot harder on the astroturf than a flat indoor shoe. Basically, an indoor shoe is flat on the bottom and wont ruin the playing surface. The turf shoe is bumpier and may ruin the surface.

561a42dcf730fd97fc3a2ebd788ea961aa	Cricket is a bat-and-ball team sport that originated in southern England. The earliest definite reference is dated 1598, and it is now played in more than 100 countries.[1] There are several forms of cricket; at its highest level is Test cricket, in which the current leading national team is Australia.[2] Test cricket is followed in rank by One Day International cricket, whose last World Cup was also won by Australia; the tournament was televised in over 200 countries to a viewing audience estimated at more than two billion viewers.[3][4] The current leading One Day International team is South Africa.[5]<br>  <br>  A cricket match is contested by two teams, usually of eleven players each[6] and is played on a grass field in the centre of which is a flat strip of ground 22 yards (20 m) long called a pitch. A wicket, usually made of wood, is placed at each end of the pitch and used as a target.<br>  <br>  The bowler, a player from the fielding team, bowls a hard leather, fist-sized, 5.5-ounce (160 g) cricket ball from the vicinity of one wicket towards the other, which is guarded by the batsman, a player from the opposing team. The ball usually bounces once before reaching the batsman. In defence of his wicket, the batsman plays the ball with a wooden cricket bat. Meanwhile, the other members of the bowler's team stand in various positions around the field as fielders, players who retrieve the ball in an effort to stop the batsman scoring runs, and if possible to get him or her out. The batsman—if he or she does not get out—may run between the wickets, exchanging ends with a second batsman (the "non-striker"), who has been stationed at the other end of the pitch. Each completed exchange of ends scores one run. Runs are also scored if the batsman hits the ball to the boundary of the playing area. The number of runs scored and the number of players out are the main factors that determine the eventual match result.<br>  <br>  There are several variations as to how long a game of cricket can last. In professional cricket this can be anything from a match limited to 20 overs per side to a game played over 5 days. Depending on the length of the game being played, there are different rules that govern how a game is won, lost, drawn or tied.<br>  <br>  Cricket is essentially an outdoor sport, certainly at major level, and some games are played under floodlights. For example, it is played during the summer in the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, while in the West Indies, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh it is played mostly during the winter after the monsoon season.<br>  <br>  Governance rests primarily with the International Cricket Council (ICC), based in Dubai, which organises the sport worldwide via the domestic controlling bodies of the member countries. The ICC administers both men's and women's cricket, both versions being played at international level. Although men cannot play women's cricket, the rules do not disqualify women from playing in a men's team.<br>  <br>  The rules are in the form of a code known as The Laws of Cricket [7] and these are maintained by the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), based in London, in consultation with the ICC and the domestic boards of control.<br>  <br>  cheers~|`|AA11088802	chk out wiki and watch the game|`|oFGqg0wTaa	Hey.<br>  <br>  Its a bit too difficult to explain through text but check this out it might help.

BtCJWJFLaa	hey, first off the thing that jennie said at the end makes no sense. she said you dont want a spring in your jump and you do. thats why its called a back hand SPRING. anyways. sooo im on the cheerleading team at my school and ive been working on my for a while and now im getting really really close to it, like i should have it in a week. heres some drills you can do: straight jumps, these are wear when you jump you go down into the sitting position you would be in before you spring and you jump up from it with your arms by your ears just like you would if you were springing do these a lot every day they really help. also you can do wall taps its just another drill that will help with overall tumbling. you stand by the wall and you repeaditly jump up as high as you can and tap the wall. easy. make sure you keep your form when your springing too. sit, swing, jump. a lot of things that mess up girls springs are just little mistakes. make sure you lock your arms and that you go straight back with a big jump. when it comes time to do it. like your at the point were you dont need a spot anymore and your afraid to do it. which a lot fo girls are. just think about how badly you want to be in the competiton and how badly you want to throw your spring. also try imagining yourself doing it. dont think about it too much though or you will freak out and mess it up. just throw it as best as you can. and by the way you dont really need your backwalkover to do a spring. i know a ton of girls that can do a spring but they cant do a backwalkover mainly because they are afraid of how much slower a backwalkover is to a spring. all you really need to do a spring is a bridge and a handstand snap down. well i hoped i helped you.|`|2iXKAEt9aa	ask ur frnds or ur cheerng squad 2 accompany u. put on thick foams and safety gadgets 2 hndle ur practce. bt b sure 2 b really safe.:)|`|9lmVynAaaa	practice practice practice!and get someone 2 spot u (hold your back and legs ,u jump backwards and try 2 land on ur feet)      good luck!|`|Xk97vDAraa	ok glad u asked! knwoing from experience..u need to practice at least twice everyday...surface doesnt matter...just not somethin that wont kill u...ok make sure u have MASTERED the back walkover and make sure u can do it fast..because you dont wanna harm your back doin any of this...and you ALWAYS need to stretch before doing anything...ok...first you want to try the back handspring..ok stand straight up...hold ur arms out in front of you...bring them up slowly then bring them down then do a backwalkover...keep trying that...try gettting faster...and then once your a lil confident...start doing a running roundoff-backwalkover...and then you'll improve and get faster...keep trying...its hard to explain online but all i can say is just stretch..do backwalkovers...roundoffs...get faster...and keep practicing practicing practicing!! oh yeah make sure you actually do push and lift weights becuz u have to be strong to do this...and have muscles in your legs...so..yeah...maybe you can get more help from your frends from the cheer team!<br>  <br>  good luck making the squad!!<br>  <br>  p.s. dont try this on your trampoline yet...it doesn't help...it gives you spring in ur jump...and you wont have that on the field/floor so don't start out with that k?|`|iiS37nGEaa	Get together with some friends and make up a routine, I have done this before and it is a great way 2 have fun and practice.

rgRz0O9Yaa	Was soll man denn auch erwarten, wenn Mannschaften dort spielen, die 50 Jahre nicht mehr deutscher Meister wurden?<br>  Die blamieren doch nur den deutschen Fu?ball.|`|1515911bbc12e21c3972a094b6106b43aa	Ja, man vermisst Bayern München|`|6zcaCVQ0aa	schon aber nicht wenn sie gleich am anfang verlieren|`|9e90ea6f77a7fe5168c50eb71d1177cfaa	Die andern zwei habe ich ja nicht spielen sehen, aber der VfB war echt ned schlecht. Bis Meira wie 2002 Glasgow wieder einen Elfer schenkte. Damals verloren wir auch durch nen Foul von Meira und Elfer danach mit 2:1. Naja wenn wir so spielen wie gestern uind Meira sich zurückh?lt, dann habe ich keine Bedenken für die n?chsten Spiele. <br>  <br>  Und wie gesagt bei den andern 2 wei? ich nur dass sie verloren haben, aber nicht wie sie gespielt haben und deshalb gebe ich dazu auch keinen Kommentar ab :)<br>  <br>  PS: Poseidon welche Illusion? Wir sind Deutscher Meister und wir sind in der CL? Wo ist da die Illuison? Hmmm? Au?erdem kann man auch trotz gutem Spiel verlieren, vorallem wenn ein Meira uns ein Dejavú zu 2002 verpasst mit dem Elfmeterfoul. <br>  Kann es sein dass du ein ganz neidischer FCB Fan bist?|`|XXFVtGBQaa	boah,... das war echt gar nix...<br>  da war mehr drin, für alle. am sch?nsten w?re es natürlich gewesen WENN werder gewonnen h?tte, sch?n real eins auswischen. hat nich ganz geklappt, aba die spielen ja noch mal in bremen! da wirds dann vielleicht anders :)<br>  am meisten entt?uscht hat mich aber stuttgart. das ding hatten die doch eigentlich schon in der tasche oder?!?<br>  jetzt erkt man richtig, was bayern dem deutschen fu?ball gegeben hat obwohl die ja gestern auch "nicht gut" (=schlecht) gespielt haben.<br>  <br>  ===> also wenn vor deutschen mannschaften kein gegner mehr zittert dann wei? ich auch nicht weiter^^|`|c4d63e47f7ca5923cf3624f5861c516caa	Da sieht man mal was die bayern  in den letzen jahren für die 5 jahreswertung geleistet haben . ich hoffe aber das mindestens 2 teams in der cl das achtelfinale errichen..........auch wenn es schwer wird.|`|92dfd84701fe3cbcd6d2dfeb8a1b3366aa	Ich denke Bremen wird es ins Achtelfinale schaffen. Aber Schalke wird nur dritter und der VFB kann froh sein wenn er diesen Platz erreicht!|`|DZfkT5toaa	Es war ja nicht anders zu erwarten. Werder hat noch Chancen weiterzukommen, nur leider sind sie so ersatzgeschw?cht. Sie haben aber gar nicht so schlecht gespielt. Bei Schalke und Stuttgart habe ich schon vor der Saison gedacht, dass sie es nicht weit schaffen.<br>  Wie schon gesagt, Bayern fehlt in der CL.|`|I6VMR1Rdaa	Hier sieht man wieder mal, dass wir eigentlich nicht in der europ?ischen Spitze mithalten k?nnen.<br>  Wollen wir in Zukunft wieder etwas erreichen, muss man es tats?chlich wie der FC Bayern machen und für viel Geld "Europ?ische Spitzenspieler" einkaufen, die das spielerische Niveau heben. <br>  Früher hie? es immer "Geld schie?t keine Tore!", dass es doch geht beweist die Einkaufspolitik des FCB.|`|e974341cf93917a2fcbdaa112b8e9127aa	Ja, "toll" wie der VFB gespielt hat. Verloren hat er und meine Prognose ist, da? er nach der Vorrunde gleich wieder rausfliegt. Wenn die gegen Glasgow verlieren, wie wird es gegen die 2 anderen Gegner erst. Die sind n?mlich eine Klasse besser. Der VFB wird viel zu sehr übersch?tzt. Werder und Schalke werden wahrscheinlich im UEFA-Cup spielen. Das traurige daran ist nur, da? wir in der UEFA-Wertung weiter sehr viel Punkte verlieren werden und Holland bald an uns vorbeizieht. Reicht es nicht, da? die Rum?nische Liga schon besser bewertet wird. Bayern München fehlt halt an allen Ecken und Enden. Das Ende jeglicher Illusion beim VFB. Kein Meister, keine Champions-Legue mehr und auch kein DFB-Polka. Toll, nicht wahr VFB-Maus<br>  P. S.: An die VFB-Maus: Ich bin Bayern-Fan und bin nicht neidisch. Aus folgendem Grund. Durch die Pleite wurde endlich der Magath entlassen und jetzt hatten sie den Mut einen gro?en Schnitt zu machen und solche Knaller wie Klose, Luca Toni oder Ribery zu holen. Nach der Vorrunde ist Schlu? für den VFB. Das Wort Illusion habe ich deswegen gebraucht, weil manche meinen der VFB k?nne seinen Titel verteidigen, bzw. manche reden vom weiterkommen in der CL|`|ka7RqfCcaa	um weihnachten würden alle deutschen fu?ballfans froh seien wenn der fc bayern in der champions league spielen würde!|`|lVlTgRyoaa	Trotz der Niederlage im ersten Spiel hat Stuttgart noch nichts verloren. Barca und Lyon sind eindeutig schlagbar, und wenn die Bayern zu bl?d und zu gro?m?ulig sind, um Deutscher Meister zu werden, oder sich Platz 3 zu holen, sind sie eben selber Schuld. Kein Verein hat den Erfolg gebucht, sonst würde die Meisterschaft doch noch wie in den 70ern und 80ern zwischen Nürnberg und Gladbach ausgespielt werden. Von K?ln ganz zu schweigen, und wo sind zwei dieser 3 Vereine jetzt? In Liga zwei, und da noch nicht mal beonders gut platziert und ohne realistische Aufstiegschance. Bayerns St?rke ist nur eine etwas l?ngere Phase, in zehn bis zwanzig Jahren werden andere Mannschaften die Bundesliga bestimmen, und Bayern wird gegen den Abstieg spielen. Das ist der Zahn der Zeit, keiner ach so dominierenden Mannschaft ging das je anders. <br>  Im übrigen ist das internationale Gesch?ft für den FCB nur noch ein weiteres Spiel lang, sie werden die UEFA-Cup-Hauptrunde wohl gar nicht erreichen. <br>  Und wer sagt eigentlich, dass Bayern das in der Champions-League besser gemacht h?tte? Wenn der zehnte der portugiesischen Liga spielerisch locker mithalten kann, was würde dann wohl bei einem 51-fachen schottischen Meister passieren? Wir reden hier nicht von irgendeiner Gurkentruppe, sondern von einem der besten Vereine Europas...

Maradona a pesar de que se drogo en el 94 y tenerlo siendo Argentino lo sentimos mas que a Pele. La cosa es asi. Maradona hizo mas que Pele y por eso ahora adonde va Maradona vuelve loca a toda la gente. Cuando Pele llega algun lado, la gente se queda sentada, diciendo oh, llego Pele, mira vos que bien. La cosa es asi. Maradona viene a ser como Dios, es popular en todos lados, Pele viene a ser un santo, menor a Maradona. Saludos
CeXNxNl6aa	hai perfettamente ragione. su tutti i punti c'è solo un punto che ti sfugge. <br>  ma il poliziotto che ha ucciso il tifoso dove lo mettiamo?<br>  perché non parlare di un poliziotto che non si sa per quale motivo spara ad un tifoso uccidendolo? ti indigni giustamente per cosa accade ma ricordati:<br>  <br>  1. il fatto è accaduto in autostrada non nello stadio<br>  2. se c'eri tu a prendere un caffè il colpo poteva toccare a te o a chiunque passasse<br>  3. di solito l'ordine non si riporta uccidendo un tifoso<br>  <br>  detto questo riflettiamo sul fatto che i tifosi sono quello che sono ma che anche determinate persone dovrebbero fare attenzione ad usare l'arma. <br>  <br>  ora se dovessimo usare lo stesso metro usato contro il rom di Roma, mi aspetterei una levata di scudi, indignazione, costernazione, e parole di ira contro il poliziotto ma siamo in Italia e non accadrà tutto questo. ci si continuerà per qualche giorno ad interrogarsi sul calcio violento (non sul poliziotto violento) e finirà lì.<br>  <br>  amen|`|2AhOpY49aa	secondo me pafa, hai detto un mare di stronzate......<br>  concordo con chi ha detto che non si parla del polizziotto..... ragazzi ma avete sentito da dove ha sparato?!?! dall'altra parte dell'autostrada..... ma soprattutto HA SPARATO AD UN AUTO CHE SI TROVAVA NEI PRESSI DI UN DISTRIBUTORE DI BENZINA!!!!!! il questore ha detto che ha sparato 2 colpi d'avvertimento..... non penso il ragazzo abbia avuto la fortuna di venir "AVVERTITO".....<br>  il calcio è diventato un circo che non si può fermare, girano troppi soldi.... ed è questa la vera nota triste che NON BASTANO 2 morti evitabili in un anno per far capire alla gente che stiamo sbagliando a seguire questo sport marcio dalle fondamenta....i nostri stadi ormai sono gestiti dagli ultras...dobbiamo differenziare il tifoso dal teppista,purtroppo se questi ultimi hanno il sopravvento bisogna saper fermarsi e dire basta....<br>  caro pafa ti chiedi cosa centri la politica?! sei mai stato allo stadio?! se un giorno ci dovessi andare ti accorgerai di come le curve siano tremendamente strumentalizzate,poi accadono fatti come quelli di stamane e cosa fanno i geni che hanno il potere di intervenire?! sospendono una partita,solo inter-lazio?! allora sei un maledetto masochista, perchè in altri 7/8 stadi di serie A (andavano fermati TUTTI i campionati) come ti aspetti che vengano accolti i polizziotti dagli ultras? non ci possiamo stupire di ciò che è successo... già solitamente i tifosi più esagitati non amano le forze dell'ordine,che vuoi che succeda oggi che è morto un tifoso?! secondo te la politica ha gestito bene questa tragedia evitabile?!<br>  è arrivato il momento di fermarci e riflettere su quanto ci siamo spinti avanti... decisamente troppo... non va chiuso lo stadio di Bergamo per 6 mesi.... si annullano i campionati.... si ricomincia l'anno prossimo...ultima chance (non meritata).... non cambia nulla....
