20090307223137AAsWI9v	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Mercedes-Benz	'82 300SD oil leak/smell?	My Mercedes Benz turbo-diesel is leaking oil somewhere onto the turbocharger causing some smoke and an oily smell inside the car at times.  I think it is leaking out from the air filter housing and onto the hot turbo-charger.  How do you fix this?  What new parts would it need?  There is oil inside the air filter as the result of "blow-by" but my mechanic said there is nothing you can do about it.      Is this normal?  Sometimes the smoky oily smell makes its way into the cabin.

20090307230911AAdwJm9	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Looking at a car to buy; its steering wheel starts shaking at 55. What could be the problem? Expenses?	I'm looking at a 2005 Chevrolet Cobalt. The dealer let me take it for a test drive. When I get it up to 55, the steering wheel starts shaking. All 4 tires are dry rotted and the owner of the dealer says that's what's causing it to shake, but I'm not so sure as I would not consider myself a car expert. The price of the car, even if I replaced the tires myself, is actually pretty good, which is why I looked at it in the first place, but I am worried that if I buy the car and replace all 4 tires, the symptom will remain. I could be wrong, and I hope I am, because everything else about the car seems really nice. What are the various problems that can cause this symptom(again, the steering wheel doesn't start shaking until about 55), and what are the expenses?

20061209102708AA2WeOq	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	How to take care of my car after 1 year of using?	I'm driving a Chevrolet Caprice "royale" 2006 for a year now, Im driving about 250+ each week twice on a mountanous road, and i noticed that the acceleration became very low and the car doesnt respond as when i press on gas like it used before. I also noticed that the engine sound has changed and its louder and sometimes it becomes louder but for a short period of time. So i wonder if there is anything i can do to prevent my car from early "aging" because of the distances i drive each week.      cheers,

I'd even be willing to not go back for the last part if I don't have to pay the deductible.
20090227125039AArY0zv	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;GMC	1993 Oldsmobile 88 starts to vibrate at 45+ mph.?	My car begins to vibrate once I reach cruising speeds.  Obviously once I speed to high speeds of 60+ mph the vibration increases.  It's not a violent vibration but it still feels as if the tire wants to fall off.  Seems to be originating from the right front tire.  It's been happening for years.  Over that time I've replaced the tires had alignments, even replaced the brakes and rotors.  I'm thinking possibly the hub assembly needs to be replaced with the wheels bearings but i don't know.  The car has nearly 200,000 miles on it and is still a great car.  Any ideas?

I replaced the pump sending unit was good. Ran great before the old pump died.  After installing new pump the truck runs but has some hesitation and jerking kind of feeling.  if you feed her a little slow she gains speed but if you try to push her down at all she hesitates and jerks.  If you really try to punch it all it does is rev a bit high but just drops out jerks hesitates.  I checked made sureall was tight.  The only thing i can think of is a possible pressure regulator. Open to all advice Thanks.

20070603072833AAyOM0L	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Car skipping and making popping noises when accelerating?	I have a 1995 Camaro, (Automatic Trans) it has 145000 miles on it, I don't know anything about fixing cars so my stepfather (who seems to do more harm than good lol) has done all repairs on it in the past, recently (7 months ago) he replaced the Timing Chain and Water Pump for me, it hasn't really ran right since then, it's been running really hot (like getting up to the line before the red line on the thermo before the fan kicks on) and idling rough.   A couple of months afterwards I tried changing the Spark plug wires myself and kinda screwed them up, I took all the wires off at one time instead of one at a time and spent 2 days trying to get the firing order right (perhaps burned a plug wire(s) in the process?). Now when I am driving and I accelerate the car starts skipping and making weird popping sounds, usually only starts doing that after I've been driving for a little while, any idea what this could be? the plug wires? water pump? timing chain?
