Il a commencé donc à dézinguer Doc Gynéco (la banlieue, vous étiez content de les trouver pour acheter vos disques à l'époque où vous en vendiez encore...) et il y a eu un sacré malaise derrière.   Bref,  Doc Gynéco qui lui demande ce qu'il conna?t des banlieues et L Ruquier qui nous sort quasiment que puisque l'on est immigré ou fils d'immigrés, on doit être de gauche (bonjour, ?a s'appelle du racisme).   Il s'avère que s'appeler Mustapha ne fait pas de lui un porte parole des banlieues qu'il ne conna?t visiblement pas (il n'a pas démenti les propos de Doc Gynéco)   Bref, une émission de merde, un climat de merde, des idées d'un autre age "vous êtes noir, donc vous devez voter comme ?a".

Silverstein got 7.2 billion dollars for the deaths of over 4,500 people after 911, but He did not even own the Complex. It was owned by the Port Authority. Isn't it interesting that only 3 months before 911, He took out massive insurance on the Trade Tower complex, stipulating that He would get extra in the event of a "terrorist attack"?  People who were there to rescue victums of 911 are now dying of asbestos, and cancers, as did the search dogs used on 911.  The death toll from 911 keeps rising. The Trade Towers  were plagued with electrical problems, the internet wasn't wired correctly, and would have cost millions to upgrade the Complex, and remove the asbestos and bring the Complex up to  code. The Complex was  costing more than it was bringing in. Many of the offices there went unleased.  Several weeks before 911, the Towers were shut down, so the Towers could be "wired" properly. Wired for demolision, that is.  There is proof that the Towers were brought down on purpose

20070815080424AAgrUHQ	Politics & Government;Immigration	Petite question aux extrémistes de l'humanisme bien pensant:?	si, comme vous le souhaiteriez (je pense notamment à orphée, mais il y en a tellement d'autres), la France ouvrait grand ses frontières, sans restriction de quelque sorte que ce soit et accueillait tout le monde, nous serions, depuis le temps que ?a dure, au moins 200 millions de "fran?ais".   Alors je vous le demande:   - pourrions-nous ma?triser l'explosion démographique de notre beau pays?   - la France pourrait-elle suffisamment se développer pour subvenir aux besoins de tout le monde?      Troisième question, un peu plus polémique:   - la France aurait-elle encore un semblant d'unité culturelle? En effet, quoiqu'en pense la bien pensance actuelle, l'Identité Nationale est indispensable à la réussite d'un pays...      Je vous mets au défi de me prouver que vos belles intentions tiennent la route...      Sinon,pour apaiser un peu le débat, il est bien évident qu'à la place de ces gens je voudrais fuir la misère comme ils le font, mais c'est pas pour ?a qu'on devrait me donner satisfaction...

So the driver can smoke if it's him/her and people who are over 18 in the car.      This is sort of a follow up to my previous question.

Yeah its stupid, dont tell me its stupid or im an idiot, I know, thats not helping.      They didnt press charges, they didnt even call the police. He told me since Im a minor I cant just leave, either my parents had to come get me or the he can call the police. My dad came and the guy explained to him everything that I did and I was aloud to leave with him. He said the fine will come in the mail that Its going to be at least $90 plus any other fines involved with the theft itself, he said he doesnt know what the company charges, but theres no court at all, everything is just through the company.      His exact words to my dad was "its between you and the company now" not the store, or the government.      Im just curious what does this even mean now? When I fill out job applications is it considered a misdemeanor? Please give me any info you know about if this will be on my record or not if employers did a background check.   Thanks!
20090225152727AAbXS8L	Politics & Government;Immigration	How can I be sure if my Turkish fiancee wants to marry me for Love or Citizenship?	My Turkish fiancee seemed to be the most wonderful man in the world, treated me better than I've ever been treated.  We have alot of problems, finacial being the brunt of it, but we've had that one since we started this relationship.  I told myself if he just wanted Citizenship, he could have picked someone a little better off than myself.  I know he loves me, but these days it feels more like the way you love a sister or brother or your pet.  He blames it on our problems, I think our problems were alot worse when we first got together.  A good friend of mine an American male said Men tend to get too comfortable and slack off.  He doesn't know he's from Turkey.  Sex isn't the same, he doesn't look at me the same way he used to.  He says he thinks too much about our problems and can't get into loving me, (sex).   His Turkish best friend tells him how he's supposed to act.  I've told him, I fell for you because you were different and not afraid to show and say your feelings.  Now because you friend tells you your a Man and you don't get mushy or affectionate with your words, I said bull dukie.  One of his friends say's marrying me is a great opportunity for him.  I'd sure like to know how?  Is it opportunity or Love?  It sure felt like unconditional love at first, now not so much.   He got extremely mad at me once and was extremely selfish only thinking of himself.  I told him I do not want to marry that man.  If you act like that with me again, it was a minor thing, mostly a communication error, because of language barrier.  Anyhow any comments suggestions would be greatly honored by me.  I'm afraid to Marry him.  He has not told any of his family in Turkey about me with the exception of his sister.  He has a daughter and he says he has to tell his Mom and Daughter in person.  That I can understand, but then think, well maybe he doesn't want to marry me for the right reasons.  This will be my second marrage and I swore off Marrage until I met him.  I do not want to get divorced again.    Thats all for now, thanks!   Laurie
20090225152800AA6FjPs	Politics & Government;Elections	How Do I Save The World? -Obama?	Our president needs our help... He is confused about what we want... We are in the middle of a; same sex, trickle down, imigration, troop placment, drug war, who knows what debate. It's time we joined hands erased party lines and used true democracy to help him, to save him. He serves us our liberty and we are all yelling every order at once.      Any govenor who dosent want a bail out should spend the money on phone opperators, postage, and connecting Obama to the people he Hopes he can Change with a stimulis they dont want.      If we all spoke calmly with well focused arguments... asked simple questions, and gave simple answers,  the man we pay taxes for representation will be able to go back to his congressional kitchen and bring every citizen what they want.      If not... He will continue to try to force or deny the states rights  to use money as they deem necessary. He will continue to thicken these party lines that he is trying to erase. America the beautiful will be broken and poor, and most of our troop are out of town.      If I were a betting man, I would wager The Perfect America, against all the yelling fighting and HATE! I would take odds that if we try this idea and it doesnt work, than nothing will... Dont believe me... ask your friends and families. co-workers, bosses and even enimies if they thought Obama could realize Dr King's Dream. If they think America is the home of the brave and land of the free. If they want to make the time from Abe to Barrack a time of such hope and change that we saved our whole world by saving one charming black father of two, with no super powers, and a big smile on his face, and our intrests in his mind, and our patience while he SAVES THE WORLD!

20090128145444AA53WQt	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	My ex band is holding my PA equipment hostage...?	SHORT VERSION...We were a band of 4. 2 members decided to quit and keep the most expensive piece of equipment which I paid for and the band equipment fund has not fully paid me back for.      LONG VERSION... We had paying gigs scheduled and needed PA equipment so we could play the shows. We agreed that they money we made from the shows would go to pay for this equipment. I put the equipment on my credit card back in August. After putting some money towards the equipment they got flaky and stopped paying me for the equipment and justified it using very fuzzy math. I still owe money on said equipment.      After a show in December they packed up the most expensive piece of equipment which I paid for (it's a PA head valued at $500 new 6 months ago). After ignoring my phone calls for they called me to inform me that they want to quit the band. They said "so what are we going to do about the PA?" -expecting compensation since they put money into the band fund to pay for part of it. They say that they have someone who will buy it for $350. I'm not paying them to get back something I paid for.       These guys canceled shows ($$$), alienated fans ($$$), and were overall crappy musicians who didn't practice or put in much effort ($$$$). In short they screwed us in more ways than one and cost us way more money than they put in. They only have put in about $150 each if the money from shows was slip equally rather than being put towards the equipment. However, they would have made NOTHING if I didn't buy the equipment.      Any suggestions??? What legal recourse do I have if they sell it, break it, or if I call the cops and they claim that they don't have it? If I call the cops there will be more trouble because of what they will fimd at their house.      Am I screwed?

From Dreams of My Father:'I never emulate white men and brown men whose fates didn't speak to my own.

20081114124458AAPZaxQ	Politics & Government;Politics	How Do You Feel About This ?	WHITE GUILT IS NOW DEAD       Look at my fellow conservatives! There they go, glumly shuffling along, depressed by the election aftermath. Not me. I'm virtually euphoric. Don't get me wrong. I'm not thrilled with America 's flirtation with neo socialism. But there's a massive silver lining in those magical clouds that lofted Barak Obama to the Presidency. For today, without a shred of intellectually legitimate opposition, I can loudly proclaim to America : The Era of White Guilt is over.       This seemingly impossible event occurred because the vast majority of white Americans didn't give a fluff about skin color, and enthusiastically pulled the voting lever for a black man. Not just any black man. A very liberal black man who spent his early career race-hustling banks, praying in a racist church for 20 years, and actively worked with America-hating domestic terrorists. Wow! Some resume! Yet they made Barak Obama their leader. Therefore, as of Nov 4th, 2008, white guilt is dead.       For over a century, the millstone of white guilt hung around our necks, retribution for slave-owning predecessors. In the 60s, American liberals began yanking that millstone while sticking a fork in the eye of black Americans, exacerbating the racial divide to extort a socialist solution. But if a black man can become President, exactly what significant barrier is left? The election of Barak Obama absolutely destroys the entire validation of liberal white guilt. The dragon is hereby slain.       So today, I'm feeling a little "uppity," if you will. From this day forward, my tolerance level for having my skin color hustled is now exactly ZERO. And it's time to clean house. No more Reverend Wright's "God Damn America ," Al Sharpton's Church of Perpetual Victimization , or Jesse Jackson's rainbow racism. Cornell West? You're a fraud. Go home. All those "black studies" programs that taught kids to hate whitey? You must now thank Whitey. And I want that on the final.       Congressional Black Caucus? Irrelevant. Maxine Waters? Shut up. ACORN? Outlawed. Black Panthers? Go home and pet your kitty. Black separatists? Find another nation that offers better dreams. Go ahead. I'm waiting.       Gangsta rappers? Start praising America . Begin with the Pledge of Allegiance. And please.no more ebonics. Speak English, and who knows where you might end up? Oh, yeah.pull up your pants. Your underwear is showing. You look stupid.       To those Eurosnots who forged entire careers hating America ? I'm still waiting for the first black French President.       And let me offer an equal opportunity whupping. I've always despised lazy white people. Now, I can talk smack about lazy black people. You're poor because you quit school, did drugs, had three kids with three different fathers, and refuse to work. So when you plop your Colt 45-swilling, Oprah watchin' butt on the couch and complain"Da Man is keepin' me down," allow me to inform you: Da Man is now black. You have no excuses.       No more quotas. No more handouts. No more stealing my money because someone's great-great-great-great grandparents suffered actual pain and misery at the hands of people I have no relation to, and personally revile.       It's time to toss that massive, obsolete race-hustle machine upon the heap of the other stupid 60s ideas. Drag it over there, by wife swapping, next to dope-smoking. Plenty of room right between free love and cop-killing. Careful.don't trip on streaking. There ya go, don't be gentle. Just dump it. Wash your hands. It's filthy.       In fact, Obama's ascension created a gargantuan irony. How can you sell class envy and American unfairness when you and your black wife went to Ivy League schools, got high-paying jobs, became millionaires, bought a mansion, and got elected President? How unfair is that??? Now, Like a delicious O'Henry tale, Obama's spread-the-wealth campaign rendered itself moot by it's own victory! America is officially a meritocracy. Obama's election has validated American conservatism!       So, listen carefully.Wham!!!       That's the sound of my foot kicking the door shut on the era of white guilt. The rites have been muttered, the carcass lowered, dirt shoveled, and tombstone erected. White guilt is dead and buried.       However, despite my glee, there's apparently one small, rabid bastion of American racism remaining. Black Americans voted 96% for Barak Obama. Hmmm. In a color-blind world, shouldn't that be 50-50? Tonight, every black person should ask forgiveness for their apparent racism and prejudice towards white people. Maybe it's time to start spreading the guilt around.

Everyone is so anti government, against big government controlling our lives.      But what is the difference between a powerful government and a powerful corporation? You have less say in the corporation than you do in your government; at least you can vote for your government representatives, whereas a corporation is an oligarchy, and a private business is a monarchy.       Are we really right in entrusting all our wealth to these bank owners? How can you trust these people when you have NO say over them (you don't vote them owners!)? At least your government has to be responsible in order to be elected. If the government owned the banks and regulated them completely, we wouldn't have this crises, right?

20090128182222AAnlScZ	Politics & Government;Elections	Political Debate              ?	A day ago I had a micro debate (argument) with one of the faculty members in my High School.   I really got into politics and I was showing off every teacher in the school that I got into Politics and that I'm a Young Republican.   Republican.   This one teacher started to say that he is for abortion and I'm against abortion.   He just started to make up all these futile excuses for killing babies.   Also one of my instructors told me that I have to work together in groups and I said "NO!"   He was forcing me to work and I did not.   I told him, "I don't work together because I'm a Republican and I believe every individual is capable of working and taking care of themselves!"      My question is:   Are debates supposed to make you cross (mad) as in having that heated feeling that you just want to break something until your own hands bleed?      When that teacher was telling me his views for killing babies, he wanted to win the conversation, and I was just yelling to him back and fort   Then these 6 students came up to me and told me that I should be the Sophomore 10th grade president!      Yes. I love politics and I want to major in Political Science to be mayor of my hometown, and then governor of state, then president of the country.

My birthday is this Friday Jan 30th and I am turning 18. I am going to drop out of high school completely this Friday it will do me more good then harm. Well I have been doing home school for a while now and at my 18th birthday this Friday completely dropping out of high school. They say that you have to be dropped out for six months so you can enlist. So this is tricky since I'm in home school but not in high school officially.

He believes he has support, but doesn't believe he has enough to counter the support Obama has.  He's going to try to bluff Obama repeatedly on many issues.  Obama has two options, call the bluff and repeatedly embarass this guy into backing down, or try to set things up to where he can get Bohner's support without Bohner feeling like he is having to give up too much.  Someone Obama can work with, but will have to pay close attention to if he is to get this one.      4)  Joe Biden--now that the election is over, he will use Biden as an occasional adviser.  But Biden will eventually be relegated to a role that is fairly ineffective.  He will be the kind of VP that we usually expect, the funeral guy.        5)  Mitch McConnell--Similar to Bohner.  He believes he has the support of the Republican base, but isn't sure it will be enough to warrant fighting with Obama on everything.  Not as good as bluffing as Bohner is, though.  Obama should actually do pretty well with this one.      6)  Diane Feinstein--No problems here.  She will back Obama completely.

"To those leaders around the globe who seek to sow conflict, or blame their society's ills on the West — know that your people will judge you on what you can build, not what you destroy. To those who cling to power through corruption and deceit and the silencing of dissent, know that you are on the wrong side of history; but that we will extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist."      Barack H. Obama.      Now look at this:      "We will not apologize for our way of life, nor will we waver in its defense, and for those who seek to advance their aims by inducing terror and slaughtering innocents, we say to you now that our spirit is stronger and cannot be broken; you cannot outlast us, and we will defeat you."      Barack H. Obama      Okay, so at first he says we will help, if you stop trying to fight us.      Then Obama changes his mind mid speech and says that we don't need to help, you and will destroy you.      Does this make any sense?

He wants Obama's policies to fail because he does not agree with them.        Obama has told people to stop listening to Rush Limbaugh.  Is Obama telling people to stop listening to Limbaugh because Obama knows Limbaugh is right, or can Obama not come up with something to say to defend himself?        If the President is telling the citizens of the United States of America who they should and should not listen to, isn't this the beginning of the end of our freedom of speech?  It definitely will be an invasion of our freedom of speech, if Rush Limbaugh is taken off of the air.

Upon her return today to pick it up, she had noticed that the stone that was originally there was replaced by some worthless piece of glass that didnt even match in color with the one that was placed originally. Not only did the color didnt match but the size too. The back pieces that were holding the big zirconium stone were broken and the stone was practically dangling. It was completely obvious that the guy had replaced the stones. At the same time the repair guy was acting like nothing happened denying everything. Afterward my mom went to police to file a report but was told that there is no prove or evidence that the guy had replaced the stone and the only legal action that she could take towards that matter is take him to court. Even though the stone and the necklace arent of high price its of an extreme personal value to my mom. Please is there anything else we can do resolve this issue because it seems as though the legal system is never on your side when you need it. Please help. Thanks in advance.

I personally think he went in too quickly (his recruiter called and got him in without him even passing the ASVAB test, and he was off to BCT in three weeks). Anyway, he did not get any bonus, and he is an E2 MOS Food Service Specialist, and his pay is $1100.00 a month after taxes. He still has to pay rent and things like that at home. Now he is stressed because he is always broke, and can't make his half of the rent, phone bill, etc because he is having to pay for some things while he is in AIT. I think he made a horrible mistake. Now he his upset that he joined, and stressing out, and was told he can't get any extra money or help because he isn't married or have any dependents. Is there anything he can do? Can he get out? He has not completed AIT yet. I told my friend I did not know because the Army owned him until his contract is up, but there may be a way, if he could get Entry Level Separation. Does he have any options???

20090406133505AAjrpmD	Politics & Government;Politics	Are reporters being honest about the melting artic sea ice?	WASHINGTON – The Arctic is treading on thinner ice than ever before. Researchers say that as spring begins, more than 90 percent of the sea ice in the Arctic is only 1 or 2 years old. That makes it thinner and more vulnerable than at anytime in the past three decades, according to researchers with NASA and the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Colorado.       http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090406/ap_o...       However a story earlier from June 2008 may explain why this is happening:      New evidence deep beneath the Arctic ice suggests a series of underwater volcanoes have erupted in violent explosions in the past decade.       Hidden 2.5 miles (4,000 meters) beneath the Arctic surface, the volcanoes are up to a mile (2,000 meters) in diameter and a few hundred yards tall. They formed along the Gakkel Ridge, a lengthy crack in the ocean crust where two rocky plates are spreading apart, pulling new melted rock to the surface.       Until now, scientists thought undersea volcanoes only dribbled lava from cracks in the seafloor. The extreme pressure from the overlying water makes it difficult for gas and magma to blast outward.        http://www.livescience.com/environment/0...       Global warming supporters don't want to support this theory.  Why?  Because their funding for man made global warming will dry up.  Are these people really being honest about this issue?

20090128210617AAUwd4W	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Driving: right or privilege?	Asking this because I'm going to be going to college next year, and will have no financial support whatsoever (my parents won't help me at all). I want to get a job over summer and make enough money for a down payment on an apartment and at least a few months rent. Right now I cannot get a license until I am 18 because of the 6 hours of drivers training required in California and cannot afford to pay the amount needed to get these hours. I want to get a job, and for now am willing to walk to work, but this would be to save up to buy a car from my friend, which I would not be able to drive legally or own legally without a license. While I could save up to buy the lessons personally, my grievance is that even if i do, I have heard that in order to take the test in California I need to show proof of insurance of the car I drive for the test, which I cannot afford without a full time job, and which I wouldn't have without a car. Not sure if i explained it right, but there is a big loophole in my situation.      The reason I bring all this up is that I feel somewhat denied of a basic right. I cannot drive myself to a job (the nearest bus station to my house is next to where I would work, there are no bus stops close to my house).

20090128212016AArovgp	Politics & Government;Elections	Why didn't anyone listen to George Washington?	He warned young America of parties,and he said that it would divide the country.I think he was absolutely correct in saying that.I can't stand the two-party system      Everyone acts like the Democrats and Republicans have these huge ideological differences when they actually don't. They're the same,and it depends on which party you think is the lesser of the two evils      Just look at the past eight years as an example.Anyone who questioned Bush,the government,or the war was called "ant-American".How vile is that? Calling someone "un-American" just because they have a legitimate reason to question the president? EVERYONE can do. I don't count immature name calling like how people did to Bush,Clinton,Obama or any other president to be legitimate opposition.I count legitimate policy questions.      Anyways,why didn't anyone listen to George Washington?      One of the reasons he's one of my favorite presidents is because of this

After another 3 months my car was stollen :).Two days ago I recieved a mechanical lien from the repair shop and tonight I recieved a call from the police telling me that they have found my car in a storage under the mechanic's name.I can not go pick up my car because the police is saying that it is a legal matter and I have to go to court.Does the repair shop have any rights after stealing my car?

Here's the info about us though, no lies, it's all true.      I'm 18, turning 19 in Dec of 2009. She's 17, turning 18 in July of 2009. She was my first, I was her 4th. We've been dating on and off since 8th grade, and she's finishing her Senior year in High school. I was usually the one to leave her, mostly cause I didn't want the relationship when I was younger, that's changed now. I'm confident we'll be fine. I have heard though that military lifestyle is very stressful on relationships. So whatever I can know would be nice.      Also I left her in AZ for 3 months almost to go to WA with my mom to help her, and we called each other MAYBE a grand total of 5 times. We were just fine after that. =]

My friend took me home today and we were just talking inside until cops came outside the house and told us to get out with our hands up. We went outside with our hands up and dropped on the ground. There were about 6 cops pointing guns at us. Apparently my brother came home and thought someone was robbing the house. So, he called the police and said there was a burglary happening... When we both came out with our hands up my brother saw me and told the cops that I was his brother. All this ended within 1 minute and no one got hurt...      Now, my friends father just called me and told me that he was going to speak to the school and talk to his attorney... I understand his son is hurt, but the cops were doing there job. I don't know if I'm going to get sued, but the last thing I want is too pay him money for some mental damage I might have caused...       I tried talking to his father to sort this all out, but he just hanged up the phone on me and told me that his son was just being a good samaritan and the cops had no right to point their guns at him. I understand all this and I am sorry, but the cops were doing their jobs since someone reported there was a burglary in progress.      What should I do? Will I get sued? What will happen?

20070423025040AAc5WlY	Politics & Government;Elections	Petite question...?	Bonjour, pour changer je vais parler d'hier soir; je tiens à préciser, piur qu'il n'y ait pas d'ambigüité: j'ai voté sarko, je ne l'idolatre pas, je n'ai pas ma carte à l'UMP, mais il me semble le meilleur, ou le moins pire: donc j'ai forcément une sensibilité à droite, même si j'essaie de rester objectif.   Alors voilà: qu'avez vous pensé du comportement du PS sur les plateaux télé?   Je m'explique: j'ai vu le discours de Sarko, il était plut?t apaisé, il a parlé en "bien" de Royal; ses différents lieutenants, après l'obligatoire minute émotion du sursaut démocratique ont essayé de ressortir le positif du bilan, et de se projeter vers les 2° tour.      Je n'ai pas vu le discours de Royal, ou si peu, donc je n'en parlerai pas. Mais alors ses lieutenants! Hollande et Lang (TF1) et Montebourg (F2), imbuvables, à leur habitude, après l'obligatoire minute émotion du sursaut démocratique, n'ont pas arrêté de cracher sur Sarkozy, direct, et ?a a duré toute la soirée.

20070411122203AAzFbSV	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Does anyone know proper procedure for writing-up/suspending an employee in Nevada?	I was suspended w/o pay today b/c I was 4 minutes late yesterday. My car wouldn't start & I called to let them know. There is no defined procedure for calling to let someone know when you're going to be late. I called the office(I work in a Credit Union) & I couldn't get through, so I called another employee(which everyone, including the assistant manager does) & she told them when she got there. We are required to be at work at 945am, although we don't open until 10am. I clocked in at 948-949am. I have only called in twice before. Once right after I had a miscarriage(which they wrote me up for missing three days for the miscarriage) & once about a month ago because I had the flu. If they suspend me(they didn't give me a return date), can they terminate me if I've been following all company procedures as far as conducting business? There are a lot of write-ups going around for petty crap & it all started when the new manager came & everyone applied for positions outside the branch.
