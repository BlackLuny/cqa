vPYcoJ0yaa	The hippopotamus: Even though they are bulky animals, hippopotamuses can run faster than a human on land. Estimates of their running speed vary from 30 km/h (18 mph) to 40 km/h (25 mph), or even 50 km/h (30 mph). The hippo can maintain these higher speeds for only a few hundred meters.<br>  <br>  The rhinoceros: Rhinos can gallop for short distances at speeds of 25-31 mph (40 to 50kmph). <br>  <br>  So about the same speed, unless one of them is a smoker. lol<br>  |`|SWxnbKyyaa	Certainly a rhino---more muscle than bulk|`|dli2L0JYaa	It is a close contest as the average speed of each of the above-mentioned mammals is about the same, and it would be the individual features that would determine the winner. That being said, I think the hippopotamus is slightly faster, and estimated top speeds are 30 mph, which is fast enough to outrun the fastest human being. However, a hippo is able to maintain this high speed for only a few hundred yards, as it tires up quickly. On the other hand, the rhinoceros is fast too. Regardless of their massive bulk (males can be larger than 4,000 lb) they will easily achieve speeds of 20 mph or more, but they can do so only over a short distance, because just like the hippo, they get tired and need to rest. Some rhinos can even run at 30 mph.<br>  <br>  Basically, both are equally fast, but hippos rarely have to run, so it hard to calculate their real speed.|`|nOPSy8jTaa	for me its a rhino. i never saw a hippo running. its always on the water.|`|B4TugZ3eaa	 A rhino may be a bit faster but it may eventually tire out if it runs too |`|UMl7CBCIaa	o_o  remember be out of the way.

BHAUE2skaa	it means big bang happened and all planets and moons are made out of the same stuff as earth...|`|IUiCal9caa	Finding evidence of volcanoes on other planets (such as we have already found on Mercury, Venus, the Moon, and Mars) gives us a peak into their early history. Active volcanoes on Earth indicate tectonic plate boundaries or hot spots.  Since our evidence shows that these other planets/moons are one plate bodies, it must be hot spots that created these volcanoes. A hot spot occurs due to an upwelling in the mantle, where hotter rock rises through the cooler, denser surrounding rock. The fact that these are found on other planets tells us information about the internal structure of the planet. The type of volcano also tells us about the planet's history. Most of the volcanoes on Mars are large shield volcanoes, made of basalt. But there have been volcanoes found that are made of more silicic lava. This tells us that the magma has been through some process other than just hotspot volcanism.|`|AA10017847	it means that everything formed the same way and by studying older volcanoes on other planets, we can learn about the future of our volcanoes

YIy9yu4qaa	Not at all, this is a perfectly natural part of being human. Its called Confirmation Bias. <br>  You see, you think and dream all kinds of things during the course of the day, so naturally once in awhile it will resemble something that happens. You remember these, but forget the millions of thoughts and dreams that don't come true. Confirmation bias is an odds game. <br>  Here is an example. Have a friend with a pack of cards. Shuffle them well. Try to guess what card s/he is going to flip over next. Do this 208 times (4 times through the deck) and you are sure to get a few right. Does this mean you are psychic? Of course not. However, this is the same thing you are doing when you think a dream or thought came true. You are saying that out of hundred of thoughts and dreams this one came true. Does it mean you are psychic? No, of course not. |`|5atczOqzaa	no it is not super natural it is a gift you have you have been given a gift that you can see things in your dream or have feelings before they happen there a a few people that have this. this is something you should learn more about it is a really wonderful thing to have. |`|0C1Juptlaa	This is called "confirmation bias" and it is very common.  Humans are very good at seeing patterns, even when no real pattern exists.  You have so many thoughts during an average day that some of those thoughts are bound to be related to actual events.  If you are a paranoid person who worries a lot, you are more likely to think about bad things happening, like the death of a relative or the stock market crashing.  What you fail to consider is the absurd number of thoughts you have that don't relate to specific events that actually happen.  If you worry that your cat might die and it actually dies, but you've had 100,000 other thoughts and none of those came true, then your ratio of prediction is 0.001%.  This kind of accuracy can be accomplished by virtually anyone.  So, either you are experiencing confirmation bias, or we are all just as psychic as you are.  Which one seems more likely?|`|AA11183069	It could be supernatural, but what would make it so is the frequency which it happens. Every one of us has this ability although most don't recognize it. Deja Vu is experienced by many people but it's rarely a premonition due to the fact that they don't recall it until it actually happens. Let's say you wake up and remember a dream that a blue car hit a tree on your street. Then you leave your house and see that very car. That is supernatural. I think you should keep a journal. Record your dreams first thing when you wake up...even if they don't make sense. Record your thoughts, too, you may be amazed at what you'll discover!<br>  Sweet Dreams|`|p6pMph1waa	That happens to me too. I told my friend about it a few years back and she told me what is was called, but I do not remember. Something about being dream psychic. It's cool sometimes, but if the thing in my dream doesn't happen, I have it reaccuring until it does happen. Kind of like Déjà vu.|`|uH1N5z5Waa	that means you may have the ability to see things others can't and if you study on it more you may have a gift of being psychic|`|XfUYyscSaa	that happens to me too.<br>  it's kinda like deja vu.<br>  nothing very out of the ordinary, many people have it.
AA10017847	earths atmosphere before photosynthetic plants was about 90% nitrogen and 9.99% everything else.  The only reason we have oxygen now is because plants turned all the CO2 from volcanic eruptions into oxygen through photosynthesis and protists converting the nitrogen into ammonia<br>  
a5ubgxIXaa	There are two important points to remember in order to solve this question:<br>  <br>  1. The equation of a line is in the form of: y=mx+b, where m is the gradient.<br>  <br>  2. Where a line is perpendicular to another, the products of the gradient = -1.<br>  <br>  To work out the equation of the first line, we would require its gradient. This can be worked out from the gradient of line 2. So, let us firstly work out the gradient of the second line, as it has the most information provided.<br>  <br>  Let us call the gradient for line 1 = m1<br>  Let us call the gradient for line 2 = m2<br>  <br>  We know that line 2 passes through (1,3) and (7,10).

bKRor7Kwaa	A. you need to know the definitions of each sequence before you answer this first problem.<br>  In an arithmetic sequence,  you go from one term to the next by either adding or subtracting the SAME VALUE which is referred to as the common difference. The symbol for that is "d". This sequence has a formula you can use. The formula is An=a+(n-1)d.<br>  In a geometric sequence, you go from one term to the next by either multiplying or dividing the SAME VALUE which is referred to as the common ratio. The symbol for the common ratio is "r". This sequence also has a formula you can use which is An=ar^(n-1).<br>  Now that you know the differences in the sequences, you can answer your first problem!<br>  <br>  B. In order to find this solution, you will substitute the number 12 into the given equation where you find the "n". It will look like-<br>  t(12)=5(1.2)^12. Now solve the equation.<br>  <br>  C. This problem is just like the last problem in that where ever you see "n", plug in 14.92992. The equation should look like -<br>  t(14.92992)=5(1.2)^14.92992. Now solve for the equation.<br>  <br>  I certainly hope this helps you to understand how these problems work. Keep up the good work and always ask questions when you don't understand, never be shy about that. Plus, there are never any stupid questions! Good luck to you with your Algebra class.

If you draw the triangle, you will see this.|`|iaHgxUVYaa	Ok, first draw a right triangle based on the diagram.<br>   <br>  The height would be 208<br>  And the hypotenuse would be 1000<br>  Then, name the angle of depression (angle you are looking for): x<br>  <br>  We know it's a right trangle because the height is always perpendicular to the base, and perpendicular lines always create right angles.<br>  <br>  Then, you would use trigonometry to solve the problem.<br>  <br>  cos X = 208/1000<br>  cos^ -1 (208/1000) = 77.99° <br>  <br>  So the angle of depression is approximately 78°.<br>  <br>  Basically, all you have to do is draw the triangle and then do trig to solve problems with angle of elevation and depression.<br>  <br>  Here are some links to help you understand the concept for your test tomorrow:<br>  <a href="http://www.icoachmath.com/SiteMap/AngleofDepression.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.icoachmath.com/SiteMap/Angleo...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.mathwarehouse.com/geometry/angle/elevation_depression/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mathwarehouse.com/geometry/an...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.algebralab.org/Word/Word.aspx?file=Trigonometry_AnglesElevDepression.xml" rel="nofollow">http://www.algebralab.org/Word/Word.aspx...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.mathsteacher.com.au/year10/ch15_trigonometry/12_elevation_depression/23elevdep.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.mathsteacher.com.au/year10/ch...</a>

But an interesting fact is that, the shortest distance between the two goes over Iceland that is even more north than Moscow!<br>  <br>  Imagine this: You are the pilot of a Concorde supersonic aircraft. You leave Moscow at midnight the 22th of June, for Washington.<br>  <br>  As the pilot, you can decide between three routes:<br>  <br>  1) the NDB route (aviation radio beacon).<br>  2) the compass route, following a course of perhaps 250 degrees.<br>  3) the VOR route (another aviation radio beacon sending different radials).<br>  <br>  If you choose the first one (the gnomonic route), you will fly over Norway and Iceland.<br>  If you choose the second one (the rhumb line) you will fly over Belgium.<br>  If you choose the third one (path of constant bearing) you will fly over Spain.<br>  <br>  Now, if you take the first one, the gnomonic route that is the shortest, you will leave in the dark.

UFteXlqwaa	I can confirm you idea and what Tim writes: It's: Cumulonimbus clouds.<br>  <br>  I have sailed nearly half a century and we know that seafarers fear a falling barometer. But the truth is that a quick rising one is the worst situation because it happens with the passing of a cold front.<br>  <br>  A cold front means unstable air masses: cumulonimbus perhaps forming thunderstorms, shifting and gusty winds. The only positive side of it is that visibility is much better as the cold air comes in. Sometimes, visibility is important in coastal navigation.<br>  <br>  But the worst part of a cold front is a squall line. That is a line of extremely strong wind coming ahead of the a cold front. The wind goes from calm to gale force in a matter of seconds.<br>  <br>  During daytime, you can see it coming as clouds will move very fast and they will look very ugly. Bring all sails down and latch everything. The ride will be hard but short lasting. The worst is when it happens at night, you have nothing to warn you. How do I know? Been there, done that!|`|a917d593ea1f4981609035fa3fabcbacaa	Absolutely.  The mixture of warmer, moister air and cooler, drier air produces a cumulonimbus, or thunderstorm.  There are exceptions to the rule, but in general, you are correct.
UFteXlqwaa	False. An occlusion, or occluded front is the last stage of a frontal low pressure (cyclone). It happens when the cold front, moving faster, climbs over the leading warm front.<br>  <br>  If the cold air behind the low pressure is colder than the one in front of it, then that will come under the warm front. It is then called a cold occlusion. If the air behind is warmer, it will climb the warm front. It is then called a warm occlusion.

GJWl6J6Xaa	Io se vuoi te la spiego, ma mi devi dire a quale livello, perchè se fai medicina per spiegartela non mi basta lo spazio di answer, se fai il liceo invece è diverso.<br>  A disposizione.<br>   Al contrario di quella innata aspecifica, può essere anche definita come la risposta immunitaria acquisita,(compare unicamente dopo l'esposizione ad un particolare antigene), si instaura dopo qualche giorno dal momento dell'esposizione (quella innata è immediata), prevede la produzione di molecole (anticorpi) e/o cellule (linfociti T) in grado di riconoscere ed inattivare selettivamente uno e solo un particolare antigene e prevede la formazione di memoria (dopo che l'infezione è stata debellata alcune cellule T si differenziano in cellule T della memoria mentre le cellule B che producono l'anticorpo specifico si differenziano in plasmacellule secernenti l'anticorpo): la memoria permette, in caso di una seconda esposizione, una risposta immediata, selettiva, efficace e quasi sempre asintomatica (senza infiammazione, che rappresenta il sintomo principale della risposta immunitaria innata aspecifica). Ad ogni ciclo di esposizione la rsiposta immunitaria specifica è più veloce ed efficace grazie ai meccanismo di memoria immunitaria.|`|a8a18d3c62e203ecad32aa09b0334581aa	Le classi di anitcorpi si suddividono in base alla loro conformazione e alla loro funzione. Quando l'organismo viene a contatto con un nuovo antigene, che puo' essere un batterio o virus con cui non aveva mai avuto contatti, si formano le IgM, ovvero i primi anticorpi che aggrediscono quel particolare antigene in maniera specifica, cioè sono indirizzati ad aggredire selettivamente quell'antigene nuovo. Successivamente (solitamente dopo circa 15-20 giorni ) si formano le IgG e scompaiono le IgM, ed anche queste IgG saranno sempre specifiche per quell'antigene, ma non scompariranno più dal nostro organismo, in quanto verranno prodotte per sempre, in modo tale da poter sconfiggere prontamente un eventuale nuovo attacco da parte dello stesso antigene. Questo è importante anche per capire se e quando si è venuti a contatto con un agente infettivo: se si fanno le analisi per vedere se si è venuti in contatto con un agente patogeno (per es. virus epatite A o della rosolia), la comparsa di IgM specifiche nel sangue ci dice che abbiamo contratto il virus da poco tempo (fase acuta dell'infezione), mentre se vi sono IgG vuol dire che lo abbiamo contratto nel passato e che ora siamo immuni, mentre se sono assenti questi anticorpi significa che non ne siamo mai venuti a contatto. Un discorso a parte per le IgE: sono anticorpi che funzionano prevalentemente contro sostanze che il nostro organismo recepisce come allergeniche: le IgE legano l'allergene (es. un polline) e poi lega i mastociti, cellule che contegono l'istamina, che una volta rilasciata, scatena i sintomi tipici dell'allergia: prurito, starnuti, lacrimazione, pomfi, orticaria, ecc, in base al tipo di reazione allergica e al tipo di allergene. Le IgA sono infine gli anticorpi presenti a livello delle mucose (bocca, naso, ecc) e che reagiscono localmente con gli eventuali patogeni che penetrano attraverso gli orifizi naturali del nostro corpo, onde evitare infezioni e infiammazioni.|`|gvzsYfvLaa	io sono in 3 media ma cerco di spiegartelo:<br>  se tutte le difese esterne al nostro interno vengono abbattute l' organismo mette in atto un altro tipo di difesa la risposta immunitaria.<br>  quasto tipo di difesa è caratterizzato da due proprietà:la specificità in quanto è in grado di colpire solo l' agente responsabile della malattia, 2 la memoria poichè riesce a ricordare anche a distanza di tempo il virus(varicella)<br>  responsabile della risposta immunitaria sono i linfociti, in particolare quelli b e t , ì.<br>  i linfociti b si formano nel midollo osseo e i linfociti t nella ghiandola del timo.<br>  essi sono in grado di riconoscere un invasore chiamato antigene, che viene combattuto con armi specifiche gli anticorpi.<br>  per antigene siintende una qualuncue sostanza, estranea al nostro organismo, in grado di stimolare la produzione di anticorpi specifici, in grado di mettere in atto unr risposta immunitaria.<br>  è tutto quello che mi ricordavo a primo impatto.. spero di esserti stata d' aiuto <br>  kiss kiss silvia

6ahTfnVuaa	Many tornadoes, including the strongest ones, develop from a special type of thunderstorm known as a supercell. A supercell is a long-lived, rotating thunderstorm 10 to 16 km (6 to 10 mi) in diameter that may last several hours, travel hundreds of miles, and produce several tornadoes. The complete process of tornado formation in supercells is still debated among meteorologists. Sometimes the interaction between the warm air updraft of a storm and winds that vary at different altitudes causes a stable, rotating updraft to form, along with a cooler downdraft on the back side of the storm. Tornadoes form between the updraft and downdraft. However, the details of why a tornado should form there are still not clear.|`|R2wEaFvmaa	A tornado is when there is a sudden uplift of warm air... <br>  <br>  Yesterday was a hell of a day for tornados in Kansas...<br>  <br>  If you want to know anything go to our storm chasing website:<br>  WWW.tornadolive.COM|`|t40OmB7Aaa	When God plays with tops, and one gets out of control....|`|2lQ8DJAcaa	they form when a long, funnel-like column of air sinks down from a cumulonimbus cloud, as warm air rises and rotates around it

Get a wooden airplane toy glider (about $1 US) and that will be Balsa wood. Find a place that throws away their pallets that products come on. Those will almost always be softwoods (unless they come from a tropical country where hardwoods are used) Most places give away their pallets. The type of wood will vary.
ggDknHJMaa	There are two ways to do this. 1. Use a lens to focus the light. When the light is fully focused it will project the light farther out in a narrow beam. De-focus the light (esp by moving the lens closer to the bulb) and it will spread.<br>  2. Use a parabolic reflector that makes most of the light go in a straight parallel beam. Move the bulb relative to the reflector (probably move the reflector) so that again you are 'de-focussing' the bulb.Again the beam will widen.<br>  in either case mount the lens or reflector to a barrel that has threads on the inside. This barrel will be threaded on the shell of the rest of the flashlight which has threads on the end that match the barrel. By putting a clear lens on the end of the barrel you will have a water resistant system. You may put a rubber O-ring on the end of the shell past where it is threaded.that rubs against the barrel where it is not threaded.. <br>  Good luck

AA10841831	yep, with gases, you can find density if you know the atomic weight. If I recall, its something like 22.4 liters per mole at STP.<br>  (They at least should tell you temperature and pressure and the molecular weight).<br>  If I recall my High school chemistry, a gas will reduce in volume 1/273 of its volume when the temperature is lowered 1 degree C (IF THE PRESSURE STAYS CONSTANT). So minus 273 degrees is absolute zero.|`|T8DThYKHaa	Given only volume, you can't find density.<br>  Perhaps you could displace water with it, since you know the density of water, but it would be easier to weigh it
AA11492504	One of the three possible ways in which an mRNA sequence of nucleotides can be read as a series of base triplets to specify the amino acids in a protein chain.<br>  <br>  The actual codons that are translated (read) during mRNA synthesis. In principle a DNA sequence can be transcribed in any one of three different reading frames, each of which will specify a completely different polypeptide. Usually only one of the three reading frames is transcribed.|`|l0SN3nWCaa	The reading frame is the sequence of codons that gets translated into amino acids. Lets say RNA contains the sequence UCAUACUAG. The reading frame could be UCA, UAC or UAG, or it could be CAU, ACU, or AUA, CUA. <br>  All these are potential ways of translating the sequence, depending on where you start because each codon (three nucleotides long) codes for one amino acid. In mRNA there are 3 potential ways of reading the sequence, and these different ways are called the reading frames, because they were the codons that theoretically could have been read during mRNA synthesis. Only one reading frame is finally used during transcription though, not all three.
cAMdBtFQaa	The best idea I can suggest is see what breeds are available in your area.  Visit the farms and look them over.  Much of the weight gain in a hog is what and how you feed them.<br>  <br>  Forget the dip **** advice from your P.E. Teacher.  I have lived on farms most of my life, I have never found or seen where brutalizing an animal has proved to be beneficial, to the animal or the owner.  It wasn't my adviser who I was afraid of, it was my dad, it was something he did not tolerate.  However, hogs are little rough housers and as such are not delicate, but your teachers suggestion I would never follow with any animal.<br>  <br>  Pigs are probably the smartest of all farm animals, and also the most playful, they are very social and enjoy the company of others and make a good companion.  For intelligence and training, I think they rank right up with the dog.  Time and work will lead you to training your animal, I have found simply spending time with them, and repetition of the desired action.  As with any animal, find what he does naturally and bend it to what you need.  Treats work very well on a hog.  Mostly, be patient, be repetitive.  Check with others who have been in the animal shows and see what they are willing to share.  Train him early to a ring and to the cane, and get people to stand around so he get used to having them around.  I think the real purpose of the show is to get the kids to learn from the animals I know I sure learned a lot from mine.  Go to the shows and see what the judges are looking for, watch what the other show folks do when doing the ring.  And don't forget, your in it for the fun and learning, and hopefully to win.<br>  <br>  The cane should be like using your hand for him, guiding and corrective, you can tap to get him to focus, but do not hit.  If you hit, you are losing control and need to reconsider what you are trying to accomplish.  Pork Chop who was my pig actually liked the cane, of course I used it to scratch him with and pet him.  Pork Chop was the first animal out in the morning he would do chores with me.  When he was little, he was like a puppy, hard to get him to pay attention.  His favorite snack was a chocolate chip cookie.  My sister had one who liked Oreo cookies.  Best weight gain will be accomplished with cracked or ground grain.  Another I used to make was what I called mash.  It was wheat, corn, oats, maize or what ever else we had available and put it in a bucket with water and let is sit for a few days.  All the grain will soak up and it will digest better for him.  Another thing my pigs liked was alfalfa, green or bailed, they loved it.<br>  <br>  Keep his pen clean, contrary to popular belief, pigs actually prefer to be clean and they like a good bath.  The mud thing is just how they keep cool and from getting sunburn.  It also helps with the bugs. <br>  every pig or animal for that matter has a personality, I have met very few who were hard to get along with.<br>  <br>  Good luck, DO NOT be mean to your pig, that was really a bad suggestion for my money.  Pork Chop was a Chester White.  My sisters was a Hampshire.  The Chesters have a reputation for being aggressive, but I never saw it in Pork Chop.|`|nTNnSpclaa	Terry O nailed most of the question.  Practice walking the pig with the cane directing it where you want to go.  I showed using a hog bat for 10 years and won a few showmanship awards.  Get the pig used to walking around with you directing it where to go that will help a lot for showing it.<br>  <br>  Also cross-breeds such as a hampshire duroc cross tend to gain weight faster than purebreds due to hybrid-vigor, but really most breeds of pigs grow fairly fast.  Avoid Pietrains if you are looking for rate of gain, but they are well muscled.

At intervals the animal must pause and discard its shell; a quick spurt of growth then takes place before the new skeleton hardens.

irFvDZmNaa	Hi! You've asked a great question! Let me tell you something! <br>  <br>  All the knowledge is out there for us to have. We just have to study and make sense out of it. YES, we can regrow body parts. However, it will probably be many years down the line before we successfully figure out how to do so. <br>  <br>  Genetics is a fairly new subject if you really look at it historically. Everything is possible with enough knowledge. For instance, think about why most people die. Heart failure, lung failure, disease, etc. Ok, what if someone had a bad heart, and we were able to create a brand new identical heart for that patient? Then, the patient will no longer have heart failure. The same goes with lungs, and many other organs in our bodies. If we learn how to replace them, then perhaps we can live forever! <br>  <br>  Think about it! We die for certain reasons. In most cases, it's because of disease! Well, if we combat disease, then we will no longer die from disease. As for organ failure, if we can easily replace organs, then we will no longer die from organ failure. <br>  <br>  Last point is this. We AGE for very specific reasons. Aging is controlled by genes. Therefore, if we can control the genes that are involved in aging, then we can live forever! We will never die! So yes, humans can live forever, and have their arms regrown. It just depends on how educated we are on these solving these issues.|`|ybCoGshHaa	um maybe like at least 10 years from now...|`|aqvWYvQ7aa	this article will answer your question exactly<br>  <br>  <a href="http://express.howstuffworks.com/ask-mb-regenerate.htm" rel="nofollow">http://express.howstuffworks.com/ask-mb-...</a>
tLs3HVp3aa	A Dove prism is a type of reflective prism which is used to invert an image. Dove prisms are shaped from a truncated right-angle prism. A beam of light entering one of the sloped faces of the prism undergoes total internal reflection from the inside of the longest (bottom) face and emerges from the opposite sloped face. Images passing through the prism are flipped, and because only one reflection takes place, the image's handedness is changed to the opposite sense.<br>  <br>  Dove prisms have an interesting property that when they are rotated along their longitudinal axis, the transmitted image rotates at twice the rate of the prism. This property means they can rotate a beam of light by an arbitrary angle, making them useful in beam rotators, which have applications in fields such as interferometry, astronomy, and pattern recognition.<br>  <br>  Moreno et. al (2003, 2004) found that there is a change in the state of polarization of a beam of light on passing through a rotated dove prism. The polarization-transforming properties of dove prisms are of particular interest because they can influence the signal measurement of the scientific instrument.<br>  <br>  <br>  The Dove prism is named for its inventor, Heinrich Wilhelm Dove.

sa8dElLZaa	Properties of Enzymes:<br>  - Enzymes are made of proteins.<br>  <br>  - They speed up chemical reactions inside the cytoplasm.<br>  <br>  - They are needed only in small amounts. They remain unchanged after each reaction and can therefore<br>     be reused.<br>  <br>  - Each enzyme can only work on one chemical reaction. For example, catalase will only work on hydrogen<br>    peroxide (to form water and oxygen). They are highly specific. Substrate is the chemical that the<br>    enzyme is working on.<br>  <br>  - They are affected by temperature.<br>  <br>  - They are affected by pH.<br>  <br>  Therefore, how fast the enzyme can catalyze or work on the chemical reaction depends on factors like temperature and pH.<br>  <br>  Effect of Temperature on Enzyme<br>  <br>  - At very low temperatures, enzymes are inactive.<br>  - The activity of enzymes increases when the temperature increases (and therefore the reactions that<br>    they work on, or catalyze, will also become faster).<br>  - Each enzyme has a special temperature that they are most active. This is the optimum temperature<br>    for that enzyme. Each enzyme has it’s own optimum temperature.<br>  - When the temperature is too high, the enzymes are destroyed, or denatured.<br>  <br>  Effect of pH on Enzyme<br>  <br>  - Different enzymes work best at different pH. You will understand this better in “Nutrition –<br>    digestion”.<br>  - The pH that makes the enzyme most active is known as the optimum pH.<br>  - If the pH is very high or very low, enzymes can be denatured.<br>  <br>  Therefore, how fast the enzyme can catalyse depends on factors like temperature or pH. 2 other factors that affect the speed of enzyme reactions are:<br>       - Concentration of substrate<br>                - when substrate concentration increases, the speed of reaction increases.<br>       - Concentration of enzymes<br>                - the higher the concentration of enzyme, the faster the speed of reaction.<br>  <br>  How Enzymes Work<br>  The enzymes work has been explained using the "lock and key hypothesis".  <br>  <br>  Visit this link -<br>  <br>  <a href="http://schools.moe.edu.sg/chijsjc/Biology/Enzyme/enzyme.htm" rel="nofollow">http://schools.moe.edu.sg/chijsjc/Biolog...</a><br>  <br>  ------------<br>  <br>  Here's another resource worth visiting too.  <br>  <a href="http://www.innvista.com/health/nutrition/diet/enzymes.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.innvista.com/health/nutrition...</a>

758cae615235590fa29ef1d7060ba6d7aa	They come from horses.<br>  <br>  Evolutionists try to point to horse evolution, and you often see in textbooks an alleged sequence of evolving horses.<br>  <br>  However this sequence is in the minds of the evolutionist, and not an established fact.<br>  <br>  <br>  Even informed evolutionists regard horse evolution as a bush rather than a sequence. But the so-called Eohippus is properly called Hyracotherium, and has little that could connect it with horses at all. The other animals in the ‘sequence’ actually show hardly any more variation between them than that within horses today. One non-horse and many varieties of the true horse kind does not a sequence make.|`|4c1e07d9ba0c2d099d9db46ee34af35faa	The evolution of horses is the best understood of any animal, as they have left behind them an amazing fossil record. The earliest ancestor of the horse, is correctly called Hyracotherium, but often known as Eohippus the dawn horse.<br>  <br>  There are lots of other hippines between Eohippus and modern Equus. Below are a few of several links where you can find out their evolution.|`|cnPKAlDYaa	The evolution of the horse involves the gradual development of the modern horse from the fox-sized, forest-dwelling Hyracotherium. Paleozoologists have been able to piece together a more complete picture of the modern horse's evolutionary lineage than that of any other animal.<br>  <br>  The horse belongs to an order known as Perissodactyla, or "odd-toed ungulates", which all share hoofed feet and an odd number of toes on each foot, as well as mobile upper lips and a similar tooth structure. This means that horses share a common ancestry with tapirs and rhinoceros. The perissodactyls originally arose in the late Paleocene, less than 10 million years after the Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction event. This group of animals appears to have been originally specialized for life in tropical forests, but whereas tapirs and, to some extent, rhinoceroses, retained their jungle specializations, modern horses are adapted to life on drier land in the much-harsher climatic conditions of the steppes|`|iPtCX0bOaa	In scientific classification horses are in the phylum of Chordata. We are also in this phylum along with fish, dogs, crocodiles, elephants, lizards and many many more. But like horses us and dogs and elephants are in the class of mammalia.<br>  For us all to be so closely related we must have, and indeed did share a common ancestor.<br>  For us to understand the evolution of the horse as it appears today we need look no further than its feet.<br>  In scientific classification horses are in the order of Perissodactyla (meaning odd toed ungulates). If you look closely at the hoof of a horse you will see that it is walking on one toe, this is infact its middle toe. This is a characteristic that they share with rhinos and tapirs. So whilst horses are related to us they are more closely related to rhinos and tapirs, that is that they share a more closely related common ancestor with both of these animals. This characteristic indeed took many thousands of years to evolve. If you google the evolution of the horse you may well find some useful diagrams of how there feet have changed through time.<br>  If we take a further step back we will find that all animals share a common ancestor. This ancestor lived many many millions of years ago.<br>  Ah but how do we know this I hear you ask? Well there are severl methods available: the fossil record, molecular evidance (DNA), the molecular clock and isotope ratios.|`|c2666c20df7b27c2859938d7ac3b140daa	Where do horses come from?<br>  <br>  Well its like this, when a mummy horse really loves a daddy horse....<br>  <br>  Not sure of a real answer for you though

6D9cWlbcaa	Plasmolysis is the process in plant cells where the plasma membrane pulls away from the cell wall due to the loss of water through osmosis. The reverse process, deplasmolysis, can occur if the cell is in a hypotonic solution resulting in a higher external osmotic pressure and net flow of water into the cell. Through observation of plasmolysis and deplasmolysis it is possible to determine the tonicity of the cell's environment as well as the rate solute molecules cross the cellular membrane.<br>  <br>  hope i helped<br>  <br>  BEST OF LUCK:)|`|YVppLt0taa	hahahahaha

All their nutrition is in the egg with them.<br>  Some hatch with some of the egg mass sill attached for nourishment for a short while.  Oxygen is another matter.  The permeable sacks allow the exchange of gases.  There must be free oxygen in the water for them to utilize. If an adult can live so can the egg as far as fish are concerned.  Amphibians make use of whatever free O2 is available. They are quick to go through their cycle and can be on  their way is a short time. They are often laid in small ponds or even puddles and somehow make it to adulthood.

You can by dogfish, nurse sharks and several other species of sharks.  Some of the ones readily available in the pet trade, like the nurse shark for example, grow way too large for a home aquarium.  People buy them when they are babies, or even as an egg, without anticipating their space requirements.  Most of these sharks die fairly quickly as they have no room to grow properly in home aquariums.<br>  <br>  And on a side note, that guy was lying.

You heat it up before the test (hot running tap water works better than the microwave) and attach a heating pad (provided) to keep it at the correct temp.  Wear two pairs of underwear and put it in your crotch between the two pairs.  For employment tests they are not allowed to watch so go into the room put the QF into the cup, got to the bathroom (in case they are listening) and you are home free.

Salah satunya, yang belum lama ditemukan, adalah Black Hole [Lubang Hitam]. Ini terbentuk ketika sebuah bintang yang telah menghabiskan seluruh bahan bakarnya ambruk hancur ke dalam dirinya sendiri, dan akhirnya berubah menjadi sebuah lubang hitam dengan kerapatan tak hingga dan volume nol serta medan magnet yang amat kuat. Kita tidak mampu melihat lubang hitam dengan teropong terkuat sekalipun, sebab tarikan gravitasi lubang hitam tersebut sedemikian kuatnya sehingga cahaya tidak mampu melepaskan diri darinya. Namun, bintang yang runtuh seperti itu dapat diketahui dari dampak yang ditimbulkannya di wilayah sekelilingnya. Di surat Al Waaqi'ah, Allah mengarahkan perhatian pada masalah ini sebagaimana berikut, dengan bersumpah atas letak bintang-bintang:<br>  <br>  Maka Aku bersumpah dengan tempat beredarnya bintang-bintang. Sesungguhnya sumpah itu adalah sumpah yang besar kalau kamu mengetahui. (QS. Al Waaqi'ah, 56: 75-76)<br>  <br>  Istilah "lubang hitam" pertama kali digunakan tahun 1969 oleh fisikawan Amerika John Wheeler. Awalnya, kita beranggapan bahwa kita dapat melihat semua bintang. Akan tetapi, belakangan diketahui bahwa ada bintang-bintang di ruang angkasa yang cahayanya tidak dapat kita lihat. Sebab, cahaya bintang-bintang yang runtuh ini lenyap. Cahaya tidak dapat meloloskan diri dari sebuah lubang hitam disebabkan lubang ini merupakan massa berkerapatan tinggi di dalam sebuah ruang yang kecil. Gravitasi raksasanya bahkan mampu menangkap partikel-partikel tercepat, seperti foton [partikel cahaya]. Misalnya, tahap akhir dari sebuah bintang biasa, yang berukuran tiga kali massa Matahari, berakhir setelah nyala apinya padam dan mengalami keruntuhannya sebagai sebuah lubang hitam bergaris tengah hanya 20 kilometer (12,5 mil)! Lubang hitam berwarna "hitam", yang berarti tertutup dari pengamatan langsung. Namun demikian, keberadaan lubang hitam ini diketahui secara tidak langsung, melalui daya hisap raksasa gaya gravitasinya terhadap benda-benda langit lainnya. Selain gambaran tentang Hari Perhitungan, ayat di bawah ini mungkin juga merujuk pada penemuan ilmiah tentang lubang hitam ini:<br>  <br>  Maka apabila bintang-bintang telah dihapuskan (QS. Al Mursalaat, 77: 8)<br>  <br>  Selain itu, bintang-bintang bermassa besar juga menyebabkan terbentuknya lekukan-lekukan yang dapat ditemukan di ruang angkasa. Namun, lubang hitam tidak hanya menimbulkan lekukan-lekukan di ruang angkasa tapi juga membuat lubang di dalamnya. Itulah mengapa bintang-bintang runtuh ini dikenal sebagai lubang hitam. Kenyataan ini mungkin dipaparkan di dalam ayat tentang bintang-bintang, dan ini adalah satu bahasan penting lain yang menunjukkan bahwa Al Qur'an adalah firman Allah:<br>  <br>  Demi langit dan Ath Thaariq, tahukah kamu apakah Ath Thaariq? (yaitu) bintang yang cahayanya menembus. (QS. At Thaariq, 86: 1-3)<br>  <br>  PULSAR: BINTANG BERDENYUT<br>  <br>  Demi langit dan Ath Thaariq, tahukah kamu apakah Ath Thaariq? (yaitu) bintang yang cahayanya menembus. (QS. At Thaariq, 86: 1-3)<br>  <br>  Pulsar adalah sisa-sisa bintang padam yang memancarkan gelombang radio teramat kuat yang menyerupai denyut, dan yang berputar pada sumbunya sendiri dengan sangat cepat. Telah dihitung bahwa terdapat lebih dari 500 pulsar di galaksi Bima Sakti, yang di dalamnya terdapat Bumi kita.<br>  <br>  Kata "Thaariq," nama surat ke-86, berasal dari akar kata "tharq," yang makna dasarnya adalah memukul dengan cukup keras untuk menimbulkan suara, atau menumbuk. Dengan mempertimbangkan arti yang mungkin dari kata tersebut, yakni "berdenyut/berdetak," "memukul keras," perhatian kita mungkin diarahkan oleh ayat ini pada sebuah kenyataan ilmiah penting. Sebelum menelaah keterangan ini, marilah kita lihat kata-kata selainnya yang digunakan dalam ayat ini untuk menggambarkan bintang-bintang ini. Istilah "ath-thaariqi" dalam ayat di atas berarti sebuah bintang yang menembus malam, yang menembus kegelapan, yang muncul di malam hari, yang menembus dan bergerak, yang berdenyut/berdetak, yang menumbuk, atau bintang terang. Selain itu, kata "wa" mengarahkan perhatian pada benda-benda yang digunakan sebagai sumpah – yakni, langit dan Ath Thaariq.<br>  <br>  Melalui penelitian oleh Jocelyn Bell Burnell, di Universitas Cambridge pada tahun 1967, sinyal radio yang terpancar secara teratur ditemukan. Namun, hingga saat itu belumlah diketahui bahwa terdapat benda langit yang berkemungkinan menjadi sumber getaran atau denyut/detak teratur yang agak mirip pada jantung. Akan tetapi, pada tahun 1967, para pakar astronomi menyatakan bahwa, ketika materi menjadi semakin rapat di bagian inti karena perputarannya mengelilingi sumbunya sendiri, medan magnet bintang tersebut juga menjadi semakin kuat, sehingga memunculkan sebuah medan magnet pada kutub-kutubnya sebesar 1 triliun kali lebih kuat daripada yang dimiliki Bumi. Mereka lalu paham bahwa sebuah benda yang berputar sedemikian cepat dan dengan medan magnet yang sedemikian kuat memancarkan berkas-berkas sinar yang terdiri dari gelombang-gelombang radio yang sangat kuat berbentuk kerucut di setiap putarannya. Tak lama kemudian, diketahui juga bahwa sumber sinyal-sinyal ini adalah perputaran cepat dari bintang-bintang neutron. Bintang-bintang neutron yang baru ditemukan ini dikenal sebagai "pulsar." Bintang-bintang ini, yang berubah menjadi pulsar melalui ledakan supernova, tergolong yang memiliki massa terbesar, dan termasuk benda-benda yang paling terang dan yang bergerak paling cepat di ruang angkasa. Sejumlah pulsar berputar 600 kali per detik.1<br>  <br>  Kata "pulsar" berasal dari kata kerja to pulse . Menurut kamus American Heritage Dictionary, kata tersebut berarti bergetar, berdenyut. Kamus Encarta Dictionary mengartikannya sebagai berdenyut dengan irama teratur, bergerak atau berdebar dengan irama teratur yang kuat. Lagi menurut Encarta Dictionary, kata " pulsate ", yang berasal dari akar yang sama, berarti mengembang dan menyusut dengan denyut teratur yang kuat.<br>  <br>  Menyusul penemuan itu, diketahui kemudian bahwa peristiwa alam yang digambarkan dalam Al Qur'an sebagai "thaariq," yang berdenyut, memiliki kemiripan yang sangat dengan bintang-bintang neutron yang dikenal sebagai pulsar.<br>  <br>  Bintang-bintang neutron terbentuk ketika inti dari bintang-bintang maharaksasa runtuh. Materi yang sangat termampatkan dan sangat padat itu, dalam bentuk bulatan yang berputar sangat cepat, menangkap dan memampatkan hampir seluruh bobot bintang dan medan magnetnya. Medan magnet amat kuat yang ditimbulkan oleh bintang-bintang neutron yang berputar sangat cepat ini telah dibuktikan sebagai penyebab terpancarnya gelombang-gelombang radio sangat kuat yang teramati di Bumi.<br>  <br>  Di ayat ke-3 surat Ath Thaariq istilah "an najmu ats tsaaqibu," yang berarti yang menembus, yang bergerak, atau yang membuat lubang, mengisyaratkan bahwa Thaariq adalah sebuah bintang terang yang membuat lubang di kegelapan dan bergerak. Makna istilah "adraaka" dalam ungkapan "Tahukah kamu apakah Ath Thaariq itu?" merujuk pada pemahaman. Pulsar, yang terbentuk melalui pemampatan bintang yang besarnya beberapa kali ukuran Matahari, termasuk benda-benda langit yang sulit untuk dipahami. Pertanyaan pada ayat tersebut menegaskan betapa sulit memahami bintang berdenyut ini. (Wallaahu a'lam)<br>  <br>  Sebagaimana telah dibahas, bintang-bintang yang dijelaskan sebagai Thaariq dalam Al Qur'an memiliki kemiripan dekat dengan pulsar yang dipaparkan di abad ke-20, dan mungkin mengungkapkan kepada kita tentang satu lagi keajaiban ilmiah Al Qur'an.<br>  <br>  BINTANG SIRIUS (SYI'RA)<br>  <br>  Bintang Sirius [Syi’ra] muncul di Surat An Najm (yang berarti "bintang"). Bintang ganda yang membentuk bintang Sirius ini saling mendekat dengan sumbu kedua bintang itu yang berbentuk busur setiap 49,9 tahun sekali. Peristiwa alam tentang bintang ini diisyaratkan dalam ayat ke-9 dan ke-49 dari Surat An Najm.<br>  <br>  Ketika pengertian-pengertian tertentu yang disebutkan dalam Al Qur'an dikaji berdasarkan penemuan-penemuan ilmiah abad ke-21, kita akan mendapati diri kita tercerahkan dengan lebih banyak keajaiban Al Qur'an. Salah satunya adalah bintang Sirius (Syi'ra), yang disebut dalam surat An Najm ayat ke-49:<br>  <br>  … dan bahwasanya Dialah Tuhan (yang memiliki) bintang Syi'ra (QS. An Najm, 53: 49)<br>  <br>  Kenyataan bahwa kata Arab "syi'raa," yang merupakan padan kata bintang Sirius, muncul hanya di Surat An Najm (yang hanya berarti "bintang") ayat ke-49 secara khusus sangatlah menarik. Sebab, dengan mempertimbangkan ketidakteraturan dalam pergerakan bintang Sirius, yakni bintang paling terang di langit malam hari, sebagai titik awal, para ilmuwan menemukan bahwa ini adalah sebuah bintang ganda. Sirius sesungguhnya adalah sepasang dua bintang, yang dikenal sebagai Sirius A dan Sirius B. Yang lebih besar adalah Sirius A, yang juga lebih dekat ke Bumi dan bintang paling terang yang dapat dilihat dengan mata telanjang. Tapi Sirus B tidak dapat dilihat tanpa teropong.<br>  <br>  Bintang ganda Sirius beredar dengan lintasan berbentuk bulat telur mengelilingi satu sama lain. Masa edar Sirius A dan B mengelilingi titik pusat gravitasi mereka yang sama adalah 49,9 tahun. Angka ilmiah ini kini diterima secara bulat oleh jurusan astronomi di universitas Harvard, Ottawa dan Leicester.2 Keterangan ini dilaporkan dalam berbagai sumber sebagai berikut:<br>  <br>  Sirius, bintang yang paling terang, sebenarnya adalah bintang kembar… Peredarannya berlangsung selama 49,9 tahun. 3<br>  <br>  Sebagaimana diketahui, bintang Sirius-A dan Sirius-B beredar mengelilingi satu sama lain melintasi sebuah busur ganda setiap 49,9 tahun. 4<br>  <br>  Hal yang perlu diperhatikan di sini adalah garis edar ganda berbentuk busur dari dua bintang tersebut yang mengitari satu sama lain.<br>  <br>  Namun, kenyataan ilmiah ini, yang ketelitiannya hanya dapat d|`|nPq21c2zaa	ya ga tau ya<br>  coz aq belum pernah kesedot black hole<br>  mungkin kalo tersedot black hole kita bakal terlempar ke dimensi lain.<br>  dimensi kapur kali ye?<br>  hehehehehehehehe
AA11240089	I'm not sure where you're getting those ideas, but they're way off base.<br>  <br>  Thermoregulation (maintaining a constant body temperature) is a function of warm-blooded animals. We sweat to cool off, and shiver to warm up, our blood vessels expand and contract to move blood nearer or further away from the skin, and so on. But comparing sweating and shivering to rain and earthquakes is wrong - the Earth doesn't "try" to maintain a constant temperature, as it's not a hot-blooded organism. It's purely at the whim of its environment, its atmosphere, the heat of the sun and so on. Indeed, we know that throughout the Earth's history the global temperature has varied wildly, getting much hotter or colder that it is today - this would not happen if they Earth was capable of thermoregulation.<br>  <br>  The seasons are a result of the Earth's tilted axis. When it's summer in the Northern hemisphere, the Earth is tilted more towards the sun so the rays are more intense, while in the Southern hemisphere the Earth is tilted more away, so it's winter there.<br>  <br>  Rain is simply a cycle of evaporation and precipitation of water, not a method of cooling the Earth. Heat is lost mostly through radiation from the ground, the seas and the atmosphere.<br>  <br>  Earthquakes do not cause more rain. It's true that a quake releases energy as vibrations which ultimately end up as heat, but this is spread over such a huge area that it's insignificant compared to the usual heating effect of the sun and the Earth's molten interior, so there's not going to be a measurable increase in evaporation.<br>  <br>  It's true that global warming could produce more storms, but this is because a change in global temperature can disrupt weather patterns in significant ways. A higher global temperature would speed up evaporation of water, but increasing cloud cover reduces the amount of energy making it to ground level. The effects of global warming are difficult to model because there are so many variables and so many factors involved, which is why there is disagreement about exactly what effects a change in global temperature would have.|`|AA11323924	#1...yes.<br>  #2, no<br>  #3, no.<br>  <br>  when we sweat, liquid seeps out of our skin, cooling us off. the earth does not do this with seasons. water evaporates here and makes storms but it still remains 90 degrees. having a big storm or hurricane even, wont push that region into winter temporarily. <br>  earthquakes release energy, yes. not heat though. energy doesnt rise into the atmosphere creating rain in an earthquake.<br>  <br>  more storms may be produced from global warming, yes. global warming isnt taking place right now though. the oceans are still on a cooling trend and for global warming to take place, the oceans MUST be warming as well. this is so because the oceans are the air conditioning system of the earth.|`|DBOcHtR6aa	I think so...|`|Yq6CZE9yaa	maybe?

YRJFo6K0aa	I believe some ants do go after beehives, some species for the honey and some for the larvae, actually. That's an intriguing question though, when you think about how much of an infestation we humans get when when we spill a little bit of fruit juice or something. Bees are pretty fierce about defending their hives though (as I'm sure you know) so I would guess that they attack invaders, but I really don't know for sure. I would imagine that some ants end up getting stuck in the honey and dying too. But whatever happens afterward, I know that ants do not just steer clear of bee hives. I can't say I blame them either; I love honey :-)|`|lsFveRfFaa	who knows? who cares?|`|OzAcn50qaa	<a href="http://allafrica.com/stories/200805210149.html" rel="nofollow">http://allafrica.com/stories/20080521014...</a> this one will tell you about africa but i don't think that ants would attack them b/c they are small and bees are huge

JkS5JHtWaa	There are 29 protons because the atomic number is 29. If the charge is +2 that means there are 2 more electrons than protons so there are 27 electrons.|`|90ca69f4269de9d074c75fd8d5eba335aa	The number of protons in an atom/ion is always the same, the same as the atomic number of the atom.  In an atom, the protons and electrons are equal, and you lose or gain electrons to get a charge for an ion.  Losing electrons will mean a positive charge, gaining negative.<br>  <br>  So, for a similar example, let's take the number of protons and electrons in iron with a plus 3 charge.  Iron has an atomic number of 26, so that means 26 protons.  If it were neutral, then iron would have 26 electrons, but it has a +3 charge, which means 3 electrons lost.  26 - 3 = 23 electrons.<br>  <br>  Take the same approach for copper +2.

bxxmaycraa	First, your teacher shouldn't have laughed.  She should have explained.<br>  <br>  The problem with your suggestion is the same as the problem with all perpetual motion machines, to date.  Energy loss through friction.<br>  <br>  Imagine the battery driving your generator, and the generator, in a perfectly insulated box.  The total energy within the box will never change, because energy can neither be created nor destroyed.  But, the form the energy takes will change.<br>  <br>  As current flows from the battery to drive the generator, whatever you do with the output of the generator, energy will be dissipated in the form of heat, in the conductors, in turbulence of the air and so forth.  <br>  <br>  Eventually, all the energy will be transformed from chemical energy in the plates of the battery, etc, into heat, and the system will stop.<br>  <br>  ps - when I was a sophomore at MIT, I invented a "perpetual motion" machine based on interchanging static electricity with mechanical movement.  My professor absolutely did not laugh at me.  He be came very interested in my reasoning, and worked me through the design until I came to realize the basic problem myself.  That, is teaching.<br>  <br>  hth,  Bert|`|FCTnwXvHaa	What you describe would be a perpetual motion machine.  If everything would run with 100% efficiency (including no heat generated) then you could do that as long as no energy is removed from the system.  As soon as you remove energy from the system then it would run down.  What good is a generator that you can't take power from.<br>  <br>  Next: We live in the real world.  There is mechanical friction and electrical resistance which remove energy from the system.<br>  <br>  Your thoughts about an amplifier show a lack of understanding on what an amplifier is.  An amplifier can only boost a signal if energy is added to the system.  That is why you have to plug in an amplifier (or use batteries).|`|AA12029875	a generator cannot produce more than what is put into it. So there would not be any extra to power anything else. Kinda defeats the purpose.|`|88fjr4mwaa	A generator doesn't get its power from a battery, does it? <br>  Usually it gets its power from an engine burning fuel or maybe a water wheel.<br>  <br>  The output of a generator is electricity. So you suggest driving the water wheel from a motor powered by the generator but amplify it first?<br>  <br>  Believe it or not, amplifiers have to get their power from somewhere, so this might also come from the generator? No, that would just waste power because amplifiers are not efficient at all. Certainly not 100 %<br>  <br>  Don't forget that the whole point of having a generator is to supply electricity.<br>  <br>  So, suppose the water wheel provides 1000 watts to the generator. <br>  The generator isn't perfect so it generates 600 watts of electricity<br>  Half this is supplied as electricity to the user so 300 watts is left.<br>  <br>  Now, you feed back 300 watts to the motor driving the water wheel. <br>  Could you now remove the water? <br>  No you couldn't because 300 watts into the generator can't generate 600 watts out . But the water wheel would turn easier.<br>  <br>  But generators already do this. A generator under load is a lot harder to turn than one with no load. so if only half the power is being used, the generator is easier to turn.<br>  If it was driven by an engine, it would consume less fuel.<br>  If it was a water wheel, you could drive it with less water.

GgX1iEJDaa	As polynomials, they should generally preserve the scalar multiple and addition properties of subspaces. I believe the key is that they need to include the zero vector.<br>  <br>  (1) p'(t) = constant<br>  That constant could be zero, and it could be integrated to give another zero constant. It includes the zero vector.<br>  <br>  (2) p(-t) = -p(t)<br>  This is the definition of odd functions generally, but a special 'exception' exists:<br>  p(t) = 0<br>  p(-t) = 0 = -p(t)<br>  This includes the zero vector.<br>  <br>  (3) p(5) = 3<br>  3 can have scalar multiplication and addition applied to it, but it doesn't include the zero vector.<br>  <br>  (4) It is zero.<br>  (5) Again, zero.<br>  <br>  (6) The differential equation is zero, but the p function isn't directly.<br>  If you make p(t) = 0, you get:<br>  p'(t) + 9p(t) + 4 = 0<br>  ( 0 ) + 9( 0 ) + 4 = 0<br>  4 = 0<br>  This is not true. The zero vector is not included.<br>  <br>  Thus: 1, 2, 4, 5.<br>  <br>  Incidentally, the solution of the differential equation should be:<br>  p(t) = c·e^(-9·t) - 4/9<br>  <br>  If this were a DE with just exponentials with constants, the constants could both be zero. Then it would include the zero vector. If it were just functions and derivatives like:<br>  4y'' + 5y' + 20y = 0<br>  then it would be a subspace (a linear homogeneous differential equation, incidentally).

zYQFpJWNaa	This is complicated stuff. Try looking at the following website.

Bell's Theorem is a mathematical proof of this, and the proof seems to be valid. But there has been no (zero) evidence of this interconnection, and so, while it presents some interesting implications for Quantum Mechanics, and is a sort of interesting point for science to ponder, it appears to be mostly relevant for New Age mystics and purveyors of snake oils.
i0ypGmlQaa	It isn't. It does not contain unity (1).<br>  <br>  It is an additive subgroup (a subgroup of the additive structure) and has a particular multiplicative property that makes it what's known as an "ideal." Is that what you're looking for?<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_(ring_theory)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_(ring...</a>
i0ypGmlQaa	To be a subring, they must contain the identity matrix:<br>  <br>  [ 1 0 ]<br>  [ 0 1 ]<br>  <br>  Only (b) is possible, and indeed, it is. These are called "upper triangular 2×2 matrices over the ring R" and form a subring. They are obviously closed under addition, negation, and multiplication.
i0ypGmlQaa	Yes, in fact it is a field.<br>  <br>  It is commutative because regular addition is commutative:<br>  r⊕s = r+s+1 = s+r+1 = s⊕r<br>  <br>  We could blabber on about the properties of this field, in order to prove that it's a field, but that's a waste of time. It's simply a translation of the old field Q down one unit. For example, look at rewriting:<br>  <br>  r?s = (r+1)(s+1)-1<br>  <br>  The isomorphism between the two fields (regular Q to your new Q) is simply the shift by one function φ(x) = x - 1.<br>  <br>  So in your new structure, the "one" of the ring is actually 0, and the "zero" of the ring is actually -1. Weird.|`|7D41yaUaaa	Consider the following obvious identities in Q:<br>  (a+1)+(b+1) = (a+b+1 + 1)<br>  (a+1)*(b+1) = (a*b + a + b + 1)<br>  <br>  Basically what you are doing is renaming the rationals by subtracting 1 from each number.

xLhZhcjtaa	The salinity answers are all correct, but you must also remember that water has a special property in that it gets denser as it cools until it is near its freezing point. Near the freezing point it gets less dense, in fact it becomes less dense than the surrounding liquid water. This is why ice floats in water. So, in deep oceans, you have slow circulation of cold water being up-welled out of the deep and warmer water that is being cooled and sinking to the bottom. This property of water is extremely important for life on our planet (think about what would happen if oceans and lakes froze from the bottom-up....all of the oceans and lakes would have the potential to freeze completely over and kill all life in them...and since life started in the oceans, it is relatively reasonable to say that life would not exist on our planet without this property.....also, on a slightly less dramatic note, the oceans freezing over would completely change the climate of the Earth)....whoooo.....hoped that helped you!<br>  -Joe<br>  Paleobiologist|`|b0oCFZ5Maa	It is saltwater, which has a lower freezing point, and it is under immense pressure, which depresses the freezing point further. This is because water has a positive volume change which it changes phases from liquid to solid. When pressure is high, phase change becomes less thermodynamically favorable.|`|yFgckz5Uaa	it doesnt freeze becoz if it freezes then it is not called ocean it is called ice|`|WbVE1cXKaa	well, first, I am pretty sure that the ocean doesn't go down to 0° farenheit.<br>  <br>  But to get to the heart of the question, temperature is not the only thing that affects the ability of a liquid to freeze.  Pressure is an equally important factor.  For humans, pressure is often ignored because we live in an environment where pressure does not change much.  However, even going up a few thousand feet in altitude produces enough change in pressure to measurably change the boiling and freezing temperatures of water.<br>  <br>  The composition of the substance is also a primary consideration.  Pure water has a different physical behavior than salt water.  In simplified terms, the presence of other compounds in the water affects the ability of the water molecules to arrange themselves into a structure.  In very salty solutions, the freezing point can be lowered significantly.  This is why putting salt on the walk even on very cold days will melt the ice, and even the type of salt makes a difference, with table salt (sodium chloride) becoming ineffective at a higher temperature than calcium chloride salt.  <br>  <br>  That is, if you live in a very cold area (like I do), the road crews spread a different salt on very cold days than they do on less cold days.  Table salt is cheaper but doesn't do any good once temperature gets down too far.|`|HsLx92qFaa	Seawater has salt. This depresses the freezing point.

ytfqJfpGaa	They will probably used a rope to get back up if a ladder wasn't feasible. As for the water table, they're not always "miles" deep underground. In my parent's villages, areas near hills and mountains will have a high water table, and digging somewhere 30 to 80 feet will get you to some clear water. <br>  <br>  My father said that depending on where the well is, and what the nearby hill is like, you get different quality and taste to the water. A hill of mostly red clay will have a bitter tasting water, while more rocky hills tend to have sweeter and cleaner water. <br>  <br>  Nowadays, the villages usually hire contractors to help them dig a well and install a pump if desired. Before that, the people of a village will usually come together (or hire outside help) and dig the well with shovels and picks. After a deep enough hole was made, they will line the walls with stone from hills to prevent the hole from collapsing. <br>  <br>  Making a well was a substantial undertaking, and back in my parents' days, it was not uncommon for an entire village to share one or two wells. Richer families could afford a well to themselves (more common nowadays), but for most people the village well was the center of the community.

If we approximate the earth as a perfect sphere with no atmosphere and the sun as a point source of light infinitely far away, then for the time between the autumnal equinox on September 22 and the vernal equinox on March 20 will be in darkness. <br>  <br>  In reality, the atmosphere scatters light, so there's a period of twilight for about two weeks during sunset and sunrise. Additionally, even deep in winter, some light will be visible on the horizon, because the pole is never inclined more than 113 degrees from the sun.

EN32vSsCaa	Just to clear something up.  Codeine IS an opiate.  It is a constituent of the sap of the opium poppy.  It has no pharmacologic activity on its own and is converted into morphine in the body.  Which is 'stronger'?  Codeine.  Which has worse side effects? Codeine, by far.  Which is more addictive?  Neither, they both have the same addictive potential.  If I were in pain, which would I want? Hydrocodone/APAP (personal opinion).<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Hydrocodone is NOT an opiate, it's an opioid.

LssS5helaa	You should look up definitons for Galvanic, Electrolytic, etc cells. Once you know them, the answers should come easy.<br>  <br>  Galvanic cell converts chemical energy into electrical energy, by using spontaneous chemical reactions that take place at the electrodes. Key word here: Spontaneous reaction! In contrast, electrolytic cells require <br>  <br>  Therefore, the answer is A. <br>  <br>  <br>  By definition, in a Galvanic cell, the anode is the electrode where oxidation (removal of electrons) takes place and the cathode is the electrode where reduction (gain of electrons) takes place. Electrons will flow from the Anode to the Cathode in a Galvanic cell. <br>  <br>  The trick I use is to think about the electrons emerging from a starting point A(Anode), and going through the B(Bridge) and ending up at C(Cathode). A-->B-->C, kind of like the alphabet goes.<br>  <br>  So the answer is D.<br>  <br>  <br>  Lastly, in a Galvanic cell, we have the reactants separated in different beakers because if we put them together in contact, they would still spontaneously react, but we would get no useful electricity out of it, but only heat released. This way when the electrons are forced to go through the wires, we can use their movement to power a light bulb or something like that. <br>   <br>  But if we had a electrolytic cell, we could have the reactants in contact (as it is usually the case where both reactants are in a same beaker), but the reactions are not spontaneous in the electrolytic cells, so we have nothing to fear. <br>  <br>  So the answer is B. <br>  <br>  I want you to notice how important the terminology is, as I had to specify for each answer which cell we were dealing with (galvanic vs electrolytic) cells!

V8jIAEmBaa	It's used because it's always been used.<br>  <br>  In 1888, George Westinghouse and his engineer Oliver Shallenger developed an AC  power meter, with a design that mimicked a gas meter.

The kJ normally remains confined to mechanical components. The electrical components are always rated for MW or kW and electricty always tariffed in kW-h

LssS5helaa	Here is a good explanation from the Wikipedia website regarding your question, with minor modifications for your better understanding.<br>  <br>  In science, valence electrons are the electrons contained in the outermost, or valence, electron shell of an atom. The electrons that are in the inner shells are called core electrons, and they do not significantly contribute to the reactivity of the elements. <br>  <br>  Valence electrons are important in determining how an element reacts chemically with other elements: The fewer valence electrons an atom holds, the less stable it becomes and the more likely it is to react. <br>  This is why Group 1 (alkali metals like lithium, sodium, potassium, and others) are some of the most reactive elements in the periodic table. <br>   <br>  The reverse is also true, the more full/complete the valence shell is with valence electrons, the more inert an atom is and the less likely it is to chemically react with other chemical elements. This is why  Group 18 (noble gases like helium, neon, argon and others) are almost completely nonreactive and only react under extreme conditions to form some rather rare exotic compounds. <br>  <br>  Please don't be lazy to check Wikipedia or Google for all your initial inquiries!|`|fFhAeOEAaa	8 valence are stable:  Noble gasses<br>  7 valence have a strong affinity to gain an electron to reach the stable 8 hence they are super reactive: halogens<br>  6 valence are similar but they want to gain two<br>  5 are less reactive, will often gain one or three electrons<br>  4 is a half filled valence and is relatively stable.  they do form bonds easily (ex. carbon)<br>  <br>  on the other end<br>  1 valence is opposite 7.  elements with one valence want to get rid of the one so they can have a stable 8 in the shell underneath<br>  2 is similar to 6<br>  3 is similar to 5<br>  <br>  so a earth metal like sodium and a halogen like fluorine will react violently because they both benefit greatly from the reaction.

Gnfc4wRlaa	Volcanoes tend to form where plates collide (convergent boundaries) or spread apart (divergent boundaries), but they can also form in the middle of a plate, as for example the Hawaiian volcanoes.  Volcanoes where plates collide are the result of subduction of one plate beneath the other.  Intraplate volcanoes occur within a plate as it moves over a "hot spot" in the mantle.  <br>  <br>  Convergent -- plates moving in opposite directions meet and one is dragged down (or subducted) beneath the other. Convergent plate boundaries are also called subduction zones and are typified by the Aleutian Trench, where the Pacific Plate is being subducted under the North American Plate.<br>  <br>  Divergent or spreading -- adjacent plates pull apart, such as at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, which separates the North and South American Plates from the Eurasian and African Plates. This pulling apart causes "sea-floor spreading" as new material is added to the oceanic plates.<br>  <br>  There are also Transform boundaries (faults) where one plate slides horizontally past another. These result in earthquakes rather than volcanoes. <br>  <br>  Volcanoes are not randomly distributed over the Earth's surface. Most are concentrated on the edges of continents, along island chains, or beneath the sea forming long mountain ranges. More than half of the world's active volcanoes above sea level encircle the Pacific Ocean to form the circum-Pacific "Ring of Fire."<br>  <br>  The boundary between the Pacific and Juan de Fuca Plates is marked by a broad submarine mountain chain about 500 kilometers long, known as the Juan de Fuca Ridge. Young volcanoes, lava flows, and hot springs were discovered in a broad valley less than 8 kilometers wide along the crest of the ridge in the 1970's. The ocean floor is spreading apart and forming new ocean crust along this valley or "rift" as hot magma from the Earth's interior is injected into the ridge and erupted at its top.<br>  <br>  In the Pacific Northwest, the Juan de Fuca Plate plunges beneath the North American Plate. As the denser plate of oceanic crust if forced deep into the Earth's interior beneath the continental plate, a process known as subduction, it encounters high temperatures and pressures that partially melt solid rock. Some of this newly formed magma rises toward the Earth's surface to erupt, forming a chain of volcanoes above the subduction zone.|`|ZAi5w4aTaa	Subduction zones, either ocean - ocean, or ocean - continent.|`|b0oCFZ5Maa	There are three main types.<br>  <br>  One occurs primarily at subduction zones, where water released from the subducting plate induces partial melting in the rock above, which subsequently erupts in chains like along the Pacific Rim.<br>  <br>  The second is at mantle hotspots, such as below Hawaii, Iceland, or Yellowstone.<br>  <br>  The third is at mid-ocean spreading ridges, where mantle upwelling creates new ocean crust.

RCdyywTJaa	Planetary motions around their host stars, in principle, cause small variations in the radial velocity of the star as viewed from the earth. The amplitude of these variations depends upon the gravitational influence of the planetary system about the host star. This in turn depends upon the mass and distance from the star of the individual planets. The above radial velocity curve was obtained by Geoff Marcy at the Lick Observatory . The sinusoidal nature of the curve indicates an orbital variation. The observed amplitude, v sin i, can give a mass estimate pending ones estimation of sin i. For the perturbation indicated above, the parameters that are fit to the data are <br>  <br>  <br>  orbital period = 4.2 days <br>  observed orbital amplitude = 53 +/- 2.5 m/s <br>  semi-major axis = 0.05 au <br>  probable mass = 0.5 Jupiter Masses <br>  The following two images show the context of this configuration with respect to the scale of the Jupiter-Sun separation in our own solar system<br>  <br>  The above configuration is somewhat unusual for many reasons: <br>  <br>  <br>  the temperature at a distance of 0.05 AU (1/6 the distance between Mercury and the Sun) from a solar type star is very high (2-3000 K) and one wouldn't expect a low density (gaseous) planet to form there by any accretion process as the low temperature volatiles would be boiled away. Hence, this object, if its always been at this distance from the star (it would also have to withstand a rather vigorous T-Tauri wind) most likely formed by condensation out of some gaseous nebula (the same way that stars form). The ability for this Jupiter-mass like object to retain its atmosphere depends upon the atmospheric temperature and the escape velocity, which in turn depends on its density. In addition, dynamical heating by solar wind particles may be quite important. The ability for this object to retain a hydrogen atmosphere is considered here . <br>  <br>  In this hypothetical case, the atmosphere has been evaporated exposing the surface which is probably rocky. If you went to the link considering the retention of the atmosphere, you should realize that its unlikely that the atmosphere has evaporated. On the other hand, perhaps this object is mostly rocky in which case the question becomes, how come such a large mass (150 earth masses) of rock could form there into an object so close to the host star. <br>  <br>  <br>  With a suitable, but rare value for sin i, the mass estimate could be increased up to about 10 Jupiter masses. This raises the possibility that this system is actually a G-dwarf brown-dwarf binary. This would make perhaps a little more physical sense in terms of the small separation but the required parameter space for sin i is pretty small. <br>  <br>  Its also possible that the object has been captured (an extremely rare event) into this tight of orbit. <br>  <br>  In any case, as in the surprising discovery of planets around Pulsars, this data shows that our expectations of the formation of planetary systems and where they are located are pretty naive. Clearly, planetary- size bodies are robust and can exist in a wide range of environments. <br>  Things to do next: <br>  <br>  <br>  Obtain more precise radial velocity measurements to search for higher order terms, indicative of other planets (there are claims that these exist now) <br>  Monitor the primary for photometric variability as a function of orbital cycle. The precision of these experiments has to be at the 0.5% level (e.g. .005 magnitudes). In general, this will be hard. The primary is v=5.4 which is very bright. Short shutter speeds for CCDs are bad because the shutter is certainly not reliable to .005 seconds if your exposure time is 1 second. Hence, one must have a system that allows for exposure times around 10 seconds or greater. A nearby star can be used as a reference and differential photometry can be done - but I don't want to give away any more technique hints as we will try the experiment locally. <br>  Diffraction limited imaging at 10 microns might actually detect the companion directly - though this will be quite difficult <br>  Why was this object missed:? <br>  <br>  Herein lies an interesting story of astronomical misclassification. 51Peg appears in the Bright Star Catalog as a luminosity class IV star - a sub-giant. These stars are known to be pulsationally unstable and exhibit sinusoidal radial velocity variations. Hence, these stars are not initially selected for survey. Geoff Marcy's experiment at Lick can achieve a precision of 3 meters/sec. The precision of the Swiss discovery experiment is 15 meters/sec which means they can do good work on pulsational radial velocity variations but are not real sensitive to planetary orbital induced variations. Hence, 51Peg was observed as part of their general program. It has an amplitude of 53 m/s and is thus easily detected (see above data). Had it been classified as a luminosity class V star, Geoff Marcy would have discovered the companion years ago. <br>  <br>  Keep in mind that the perturbation that Jupiter exerts upon the Sun is 12 mete

Credit: NASA <br>  <br>  Climatologists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) in New York City noted that the highest global annual average surface temperature in more than a century was recorded in their analysis for the 2005 calendar year.<br>  <br>  Some other research groups that study climate change rank 2005 as the second warmest year, based on comparisons through November. The primary difference among the analyses, according to the NASA scientists, is the inclusion of the Arctic in the NASA analysis. Although there are few weather stations in the Arctic, the available data indicate that 2005 was unusually warm in the Arctic.<br>  <br>  In order to figure out whether the Earth is cooling or warming, the scientists use temperature data from weather stations on land, satellite measurements of sea surface temperature since 1982, and data from ships for earlier years.<br>  <br>  With the record for 2007 now complete, it is clear that temperatures around the world are continuing their upward climb. The global average in 2007 was 14.73 degrees Celsius (58.5 degrees Fahrenheit)—the second warmest year on record, only 0.03 degrees Celsius behind the 2005 maximum. January 2007 was the hottest January ever measured, a full 0.23 degrees Celsius warmer than the previous record. August was also a record for that month and September was the second warmest September recorded.

There was a car built with this, and the salesmen used to demonstrate it in case of foot and hand brake failure. He did this WITHOUT spinning the car around. With standard tires it worked and the wheels spun in reverse and slowed the car. If the car had fat tires fitted it could blow the gearbox and differential. My friend did this and they both blew cos the diff went first and jammed, then blew the box.<br>  <br>  If you spin the car, the forces on the gearbox are dramatically reduced but the engine will scream, as the reverse gear is usually even lower than 1st gear and if you were in a higher gear, you could easily blow the motor unless the tires slip.|`|mNr3SIUEaa	Yes, it is possible. During the time between having the car in drive and the time in reverse, the tires are skidding. <br>  <br>  This can pretty much only be accomplished by an expert driver. There is a great chance of the car flipping over or not ending up exactly backwards. It also depends on your tires. Too much grip from the tires means that you won't be able to spin without flipping. <br>  <br>  However, it can be done at slow speeds on ice or a snow-slicked parking lot. But you still have to be an expert to pull it off.<br>  <br>  Most likely, it was done in the movie by a driver with very stiff tires and the road was probably made to be slick somehow.

GgClh7dbaa	Although we generally would taper a 40mg dose of Prozac (fluoxetine) to 20 mg for two to four weeks, then discontinue it, people who have stopped it cold turkey because they forgot to take it with them on vacation, for example, generally tolerate the process fairly well. <br>  <br>  This is because of the very long half life of fluoxetine, which is usually about four days. This effectively produces a very slow tapering of serum blood levels of the drug even if it is discontinued abruptly. This would not be true with most other SSRI antidepressants such as Paxil (paroxitene), which has a very short half-life and really needs to be tapered gradually.<br>  <br>  There may be side effects of rapid discontinuation, but they are generally very mild and easily tolerable if present at all, and are rarely dangerous. Plus, they could be corrected by restarting the medication at an intermediate dose for a while prior to discontinuing it. A more conservative physician might taper fluoxetine over a longer period, say one month at 30 mg, then another month at 20 mg, then a third month at 10  mg, but that's just being very cautious. There was a case of delerium reported with Prozac withdrawal, but it was noteworthy because it was so unusual: <br>  <br>  "Recent studies have shown that withdrawal symptoms are common with Paxil/paroxetine, Effexor/venlafaxine and Luvox/fluvoxamine, but relatively rare and mild with Prozac/fluoxetine cessation, likely as a result of its longer half-life. We report an unusual case of a patient who developed delirium after abrupt discontinuation of fluoxetine."  <a href="http://www.recurrentdepression.com/site/more/delirium-following-abrupt-discontinuation-of-fluoxetine/" rel="nofollow">http://www.recurrentdepression.com/site/...</a> <br>  <br>  Here's another article that confirms that just to make you feel better about this advice, since another answerer gave you a conflicting opinion:<br>  <br>  "Abrupt discontinuation of S[S]RIs may carry a higher liability for this syndrome than other antidepressants, possibly due to greater potency on the serotonin transporter. In prospective controlled trials, Paxil/paroxetine has been found to have the highest incidence of posttreatment [adverse effects] compared with other S[S]RIs. Prozac/fluoxetine, by contrast, has the lowest reported incidence of discontinuation symptoms, presumably due to the long elimination half-lives of parent drug and its active metabolite." <a href="http://www.primarypsychiatry.com/aspx/articledetail.aspx?articleid=625" rel="nofollow">http://www.primarypsychiatry.com/aspx/ar...</a><br>  <br>  Of course, you may experience a relapse of the condition that the Prozac was being used to treat such as depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder or PMDD (premenstrual dysphoric disorder), but if this happened, it would have happened no matter how slowly you tapered the dose. It would just mean that you were still benefiting from it. And FYI, many people using Prozac only use it for a limited time, especially when prescribed for depression.|`|DhLIo8nbaa	Well im not sure why you would start prozac to just get off of it, prozac is an ssri and is used for depression and you should talk to a doctor before thinknig about getting on it, because you will have a withdrawel when you stop taking it and it takes a little while to kick in.  When you start taking it, it does not work immediately, it will take about a month or two to start really working to its full potential.  Once it does start working then your depression will subside and if it doesnt then it means that prozac is not the medication for you and you will need to switch to a different one like paxil, lexapro, zoloft or many other ones.  But this is usually a medication you will be on for the rest of your life because if you do have severe depression then it ay go away through therapy but for most people they need the meds, and what alot of people dont realize is they start taking it and they feel better so they think they are cured and they go off of it, which is not the case because once they stop taking it then all their depression comes back.  SAo you should consult a therapist and a doctor before you think about taking it and if you find that it is right for you and you do decide to go off of it then you will need to follow doctors orders with weaning yourelf off a little at a time because if you go from 40mg a day to absolutely nothing then you will withdrawel.
4zspYrGXaa	Most people with some psychic skill are empathic. It is real. Just take a look at a mother who has children, a partner concerned over their best friend, etc. This is a natural form of caring. In the world of the psychic it is only one of many tools utilized. <br>  Science is continuing to discover new forms of electromagnetic wave forms. To say that because a wave or electrical impluse cannot be matched to this form of skill is just ignorant.  10 years ago no one had done much research on zero point energy. But now scientists are saying this will be the new energy of the future. www.pbs.org/safarchive/3_ask/archive/qna...<br>  I feel that "psychic" is merely a term like UFO... We don't know why it works it just does and is. If you have this talent then try some of the methods to strengthen your mind and body. Just start reading about the subject. Think and feel what you've read. Does it feel right? Does it sound correct? Does your skill of "knowing" show you its truth?<br>  Most empaths that I have met wouldn't encourage anyone to go into this area lightly. It leaves you open to pain and sorrow, but also great joy. Only true warriors need apply, sort to speak.<br>  Check out both of the people below perhaps they can clarify what you seek.|`|NNZTrxXVaa	Set up an experiment for yourself. Does your empathic power have to do with proximity? If so set up a system where you cannot get cues from an individual - you cannot meet them, speak to them or in any other way use known physical means to communicate.<br>  <br>  For example I can think of two rooms, the empath seated in one, the subject in another then use a third party to seat subjects and tell you when they're ready.At this point if your empathic powers will not work, the conclusion is that there are physical cues by which people are communicating with you.|`|lOXqBBOwaa	Yes...I can feel people's pain.|`|an1b4pXxaa	Feeling empathy is a normal human trait, if you see that your friend is sad you may feel sad too and some people are better at picking up subtle clues as to other people's emotions than others.<br>  But the idea that you can be an 'empath' and supernaturally know what others are feeling without any normal sensory input is sheer fiction. The term and the idea originated with an episode of Star Trek, and although it seems to be a currently popular idea amongst the paranormally inclined it has no basis in fact.<br>  <br>  Edit<br>  If there really was some 'vibration' which could be perceived by humans it could also be detected by scientific instruments and researched. The words 'vibration' and 'energy' are two sciency sounding words which are constantly misused by New Agers.<br>  <br>  You know the other option is that you're just imagining the whole thing. If you at the shop and you suddenly feel the emotions of the stranger standing next to you what ways do you have of verifying that is genuinely what they are feeling instead of it being a thought or emotion of your own?|`|iUM1h6Yjaa	Totally agree with Tuk. Being an "empath" is the cheap & easy way to claim psychic powers, since the "evidence" of this power is emotions which are easily generated under power of suggestion, and also easily detected in others by visual cues.

For example, a 1/2 inch standard bolt head will roughly accept a 12 or 13 MM metric socket since in the metric scale, 25.4 MM equals one inch. Likewise, a 3/4 inch bolt head will accept a 18-19 MM socket. Since they are not exact, you take a chance in rounding off the bolt  head points unless you are trying to use them on a bolt which is already rounded off. Better to use a correct wrench or socket which grips the bolt head flats or an adjustable wrench.
AA11824362	Continental rifting increases the basin space. Thrusting (I haven't heard of "thrust loading", which doesn't mean it's not a valid term) lowers basin space, unless it has the effect of pushing the crust deeper into the mantle, in which case it could increase basin space.
HCqTYJJXaa	Thrust faulting results in one slab of rock being placed over another leading to crustal thickening (or in the case of really massive plate-bounding thrusts one plate being placed on top of the other). The result of the thickening/stacking of the crust is that it is out of isostatic equilibrium, and partly sinks into the mantle forming a crustal root, which supports the elevated topography associated with the crustal thickening. Because the unthickened crust adjacent is attached to the thickened crust, as the thickened crust sinks forming a crustal root, the unthickened crust also becomes depressed, forming foreland/hinterland basins. The flexural bulges occur on the opposite side of the foreland/hinterland basin to the thickened crust, and result from the fact that the crust is rigid and being bent downward adjacent to the thickened crust.

HCF0ate1aa	It seems like a cool idea, but not very practical. Enviromission's design is for a tower taller than the Empire State in NY or the Sydney Tower. Sunlight heats the air in the tower, creating a chimney effect. At the base of the tower are many turbines that spin as air is drawn into the tower. There is a video that features some data that you're looking for, but not specifically mathematical formulas. The physics behind it is pretty simple though: hot air rises, moving air spins a generator, generator creates electricity.

a917d593ea1f4981609035fa3fabcbacaa	Stationary and occluded fronts do not move.  Warm fronts are generally slower, calmer fronts and do not move quickly.  Cold fronts move faster than warm fronts partially due to the ability for cold fronts to overtake warm fronts quickly.|`|zFsTSrOcaa	Stationary fronts, naturally enough, do not move much.  All other types of fronts move; if they didn't, they would be stationary.  In a typical midlatitude storm, the warm front is being overtaken by both the cold and occluded fronts.  Since the occluded front often wraps around the parent low while the remaining cold front continues to progress, the cold front can end up moving more quickly.|`|ZAi5w4aTaa	If im not mistaken, I believe that stationary, and occludded are used to describe things like cyclone stages; things that fronts cause.  As far as fronts moving, cold fronts mover faster.  The colder more dense air bulldozes under the warmer air forcing it up, and storms begin to appear along the front.

The only way a spaceship could exactly reach the speed of light is for it to be converted into pure energy, in which case the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principal would prevent it from being converted back again the way it was before.  It is possible to go very near the speed of light, however, in which case one could cross the galaxy in less than a single lifetime (ship time) if near enough to it.  It would take a tremendous amount of energy to accelerate a ship that fast, however.<br>  <br>  2.  There are many more stars near the center of the galaxy than out here in the spiral arms.  Very near the center of the galaxy, there would be so many stars that night time would almost look like day, with millions of stars visible.  They would also be redder in color by average, since the core of the galaxy is mostly older stars.  The number of cosmic rays produced by all those stars, however, would probably make life impossible to evolve on any planet.|`|RCdyywTJaa	A number of reasons.<br>  <br>  1) Our galaxy is 100,000 light years across. That is, at light speed, it would take you 100,000 years to cross it. You would make it less than 1/1000th the distance, then die of old age.<br>  <br>  2) There is a supermassive black hole at its center. An attempt to cross this would tear apart all the atoms in your body.<br>  <br>  3) You would not be able to safely navigate toward center at light speed, as the mass density increases (concentration of stars, for instance). You would crash into a star eventually. Even if you could navigate around them, you would be incinerated by the heat.|`|5gG42iOpaa	It would be very unlikely because it takes light 100,000 years to travel that distance, we don't live that long.<br>  <br>  There would be more stars, they would be closer together and the stars would move faster in relationship to each other (stars are not stationary despite common belief).<br>  Also you would not be able to see the "milky way" (the band of light across the sky) as this is the other arm.|`|hKsODUabaa	1. no one really knows the answer to this question. Based on the big bang theory(which is the most popular among scientists) the universe is constantly expanding at tremendous speeds.

Most humans live to be about 75 - 80 years.  So you can just kind of figure in your head how that would be a problem.<br>  <br>  If our solar system wasn't located towards the edge of our galaxy and instead was much closer to the center of it, then I would suppose that the night sky would be a lot brighter.  Stars are much closer together as you approach the center of our galaxy.  I would imagine it would be quite an amazing sight.<br>  <br>  I don't neccessarily agree with the comment someone made about colliding with a star.  I've heard that entire galaxies can collide with each other and the probability of any two stars colliding is extremely rare.  I think you would probably be more likely to hit an asteroid or meteor anyways.|`|ZX3N1BCDaa	1. actually, light speed is not the fastest way to travel. if the spaceship travels via a worm hole, we can reach the end of the galaxy without passing through the space in between.<br>  <br>  2.maybe more stars in the night sky

AA10492848	Well, first, let us discuss Voltage Transformers.  These change Voltage from 0ne level of Voltage to another 480VAC to 120VAC (Step Down) or 12VAC to 48VAC (Step Up).  These can be dangerous when Voltage levels are high enough to cause damage.  This level is dependent on where and how the Voltage is applied or misapplied.  If you leave the leads off a Voltage Transformer and power it up, there are no issues, but you can still measure the Voltage at the output of the Transformer.  Shorting of the output will cause SEVERE damage and/or fire at the Transformer.<br>  <br>  Current Transformers are a WHOLE 'NOTHER ANIMAL.  The Current Transformer tries to deliver the SAME current relative to its input without regard to its output "Load" (Resistance/Impedance).  If powered up with NO CONNECTION to its output, the Current Transformer will DESTROY ITSELF and anything near it in a ball of flames/sparking trying to MAKE current flow.  NEVER power up a Current Transformer without either SHORTING its output or connecting its output to the proper circuit.  If you are unsure of the status of the output of a Current Transformer, do not power it up.

Once I understood what a vector quantity is ( a number that has direction), differential calculus was somewhat easier. I still mentally roll my eyes when there are three or more integral signs on a page, but it is fun to tear the equations apart so I can understand what's going on.

1Ox7si0eaa	You cannot generalize on this question. With ethylene, the reaction fails to give an alcohol completely. The reverse reaction is faster than the forward reaction. If sulfuric acid is used, a sulfate intermediate can be made which can hydrolyze to an alcohol. <br>  <br>  If a terminal alkene is used, the reaction is still sluggish. I don't know whether it succeeds or not. However, because the intermediate is a secondary carbocation, it is prone to rearrangement. If a an electron donating tertiary or quaternary carbon is present, the rearranged product will also be present in larger quantities. In that case, the product would be a tertiary alcohol. With a straight chain alkene, a rearranged product would still be a secondary alcohol. So, in that case, nearly 100% of the product would be secondary. <br>  <br>  As electron donating groups are attached to an alkene, the easier the reaction will become. The easier it becomes, the more stable the intermediate will be. The more stable the intermediate, the less likely any secondary reactions will be. <br>  <br>  Disclaimer, I am the author of "A Guide to Organic Chemistry Mechanisms"  (Amazon.com, Barnes and Noble or <a href="http://www.curvedarrowpress.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.curvedarrowpress.com</a> ).

gUHf96WVaa	Screw machine operators pretty much stand around and watch a large machine produce round parts in high quantities.<br>  <br>  A screw machine is a very specialized type of mechanical lathe, designed for high volume production, that is driven by cams and gears rather than a CNC control.  Though nowdays, there are screw machines that have replaced the camming with a control, but these are still very expensive.  Note that despite the name, screw machines do not often produce screws. There's better ways to do that now, namely thread rolling machines and cold headers that produce more bolts and screws in a given time, and they're stronger than what a screw machine can produce.  The name stuck, though.<br>  <br>  The operator is not responsible for setting the machine up, making the cams, or any other part of high level machine operation.  The operator's responsibility is to babysit the machines. They make sure all the tools are cutting the dimensions that are called for, and adjust the machine to keep the tools running at the right size as necessary. They replace worn cutting tools as they wear.  They also keep the machine fed with bar stock.|`|4WVbjbWxaa	requires experience setting up and operating Brown and Sharpe Screw machines.

Imagine slicing time into tiny units.  At each unit of time, light photons emerge from your headlights.  At the same time, you are traveling the speed of light, so right when a photon escapes from the headlights, your headlight lens is in the same spot as the photon.  In essence, your lens would light up, but you would not see a beam in front of you.<br>  <br>  Even more interestingly, I think if you traveled faster than the speed of light, an observer standing at a spot somewhere in front of you with a telescope wouldn't see the light in your headlights.  Assuming you were going faster than the speed of light when you turned on the headlights, the lights would appear constantly dark.  The photons would try to escape, but each time they would be "suffocated" or "outdone" by the moving vehicle.|`|5gG42iOpaa	due to time dilation, the light would shine ahead of you.<br>  -------------<br>  Let me clarify, If it were possible for a vehicle to go that fast:<br>  <br>  Time dilation would make you experience time slower,<br>  The light would then be permitted to flash before you at the speed of light in reference to you.<br>  <br>  Look into Einstein's Theory of Relativity|`|kTXGjTmiaa	nothing since the vehicle is at light speed already the light can not travel any faster then speed it is traveling at..if the light were beyond it's own source the that would be different 2 light sources traveling at the same velocity cancel each other out as far as I can figure it..
AA10929714	This is a second-order, homogeneous, linear equation with constant coeffficients.  Solve it in the usual way by assuming a solution of the form y = exp(k*x)<br>  <br>  This gives the characteristic equation:<br>  <br>  k^2 + 1 = 0<br>  <br>  k = +/-i.<br>  <br>  The roots are imaginary, so the solution is:<br>  <br>  y(x) = a*sin(x) + b*cos(x), where a and b are constants of integration.<br>  <br>  This is, in fact, the same answer as you obtained.   Remember the formula for the sin of the difference between two angles:<br>  <br>  sin(w - z) = sin(w)*cos(z) - cos(w)*sin(z)<br>  <br>  Your solution can therefore be written as:<br>  <br>  c*sin(x - c1) = c*(sin(x)*cos(c1) - cos(x)*sin(c1))<br>  <br>  Let c*cos(c1) = a, and -c*sin(c1) = b, and you get the same answer as I did above.<br>  <br>  This is a general result.  Any time you have a function that is a linear combination of a sin and cos of a particular argument, that function can be written as the sine (or cosine) of that argument plus a constant "phase factor", or "phase angle".  In your answer, the constant "c1" is the phase factor.

If I were you, I would not trust all of these answers that were given. TRUST ME, everyone is wrong so far! I AM TOTALLY SHOCKED that a BIOLOGY TEACHER IS WRONG!<br>  <br>  First of all, how can number 1) be D? It sounds good, but that is WRONG. First of all, if D is correct, then A and B should also be correct. <br>  <br>  Think about it, A talks about a trait that helps avoid predators. B Talks about a trait that helps the species to gather food. WELL avoiding predators and gathering food is the same thing as D. Therefore, A, B, and D are very similar to each other. <br>  <br>  HOWEVER, C is the only answer that stands out from the rest. C cleraly says " a charateristic that "EVOLVES." BINGO. There is your answer. If we are talking about Adaptation, then we are talking about the ability of a species to adapt to a changing, possibly harsh environment. Therefore, it is important for their traits to be able to "EVOLVE" so they can survive in the newly formed environment. <br>  <br>  Last point is this. Think about it. Suppose you do have a trait that allows you to survive and reproduce in a particular environment. OK! What happens when that environment changes so much that the Trait is no longer a benefit? Well, then you would expect all the species to die right? WRONG! Many species will die, but the species who have a """""CHARACTERISTIC THAT CAN EVOLVE,"""" will  LIVE!  WHY? Because they have ADAPTED! <br>  <br>  That is natural selection at its finest! <br>  <br>  <br>  Anyway, if I were you, I would not trust all of these answers. EVERYONE is wrong!

5XHqw6n8aa	First of all we can use the formula for values of an annuity, and try to find the monthly rate to give the loan amount over 30 years at 8.9% APR compounded monthly.<br>  <br>  This formula is<br>  <br>  R = A* ( i / ( 1 - (1+i)^(-n) ) )<br>  R is the monthly payment, A is the loan amount, i is the interest rate per period (months in this case), n is the number of payments<br>  <br>  a) we want to find R.  <br>  A = 80% of 212,000 = 169,600<br>  i = 8.9% / 12 = 0.089/12 which is approximately 0.007417<br>  n = 30 * 12 = 360<br>  <br>  Now we just plug everything in to a calculator.<br>  <br>  I get $1352.45<br>  <br>  b) for this part we will use the same formula but moved around to isolate A = the value of the cumulative payments<br>  <br>  A = R * ( 1 - (1+i)^(-n) )/i<br>  R = 1352.45 (our answer from (a) )<br>  i = 0.007417<br>  n = 96<br>  <br>  Plug everything in. I get 92643.85. This is how much is paid down<br>  which leaves <br>  <br>  169,600 - 92,643.85 = 76,956.15 as the remaining balance.<br>  <br>  c)In order to see how much interest was paid in the seventh year, we can compare the totals on the payments and actual decrement on the loan.  So if the interest was zero we would expect the loan balance to drop by the total paid in.  Since it isn't there should be a disparity.<br>  <br>  The next couple steps use the method from part (b)<br>  At the end of 6 years (72 months) the loan balance is <br>  169600 - 75236.65 = 94363.35<br>  At the end of 7 years (84 months) the loan balance is <br>  169600 - 84325.88 = 85274.12<br>  <br>  This amounts to a change of 94363.35 - 85274.12 = 9089.23<br>  <br>  But 12 payments of 1352.45 were made = 12*1352.45 = 16229.40<br>  <br>  So overall the interest paid during the seventh year (money not paying down the balance) is<br>  <br>  16229.40 - 9089.23 = $7140.17<br>  <br>  d)Now instead of looking for R or A we are looking for the length of time n.<br>  <br>  Using the annuity formula we do some manipulation to isolate the n term.<br>  <br>  A = R*(1 - (1+i)^(-n))/i<br>  A*i/R = 1 - (1+i)^(-n)<br>  1-A*i/R = (1+i)^(-n)<br>  <br>  To get exponents we need to take the logarithm of both sides.  You can choose your favorite base. I prefer e.<br>  <br>  log (1-A*i/R) = log ((1+i)^(-n))<br>  <br>  The log of a power is the exponent times the log of the base of that power.<br>  <br>  log(1-A*i/R) = (-n) * log(1+i)<br>  <br>  finally we get<br>  <br>  n = -log(1-A*i/R)/log(1+i)<br>  <br>  We plug in with<br>  A = 169600<br>  R = 1352.45 + 150 = 1502.45<br>  i = 0.00747<br>  <br>  I got 245.7 which we round to 246 payments or 20.5 years
MTQ2dmWJaa	Geography (from Greek γεωγραφ?α - geographia, lit. "earth describe-write"[1]) is the study of the Earth and its lands, features, inhabitants, and phenomena.[2] A literal translation would be "to describe or write about the Earth". The first person to use the word "geography" was Eratosthenes (276-194 B.C.). Four historical traditions in geographical research are the spatial analysis of natural and human phenomena (geography as a study of distribution), area studies (places and regions), study of man-land relationship, and research in earth sciences.[3] Nonetheless, modern geography is an all-encompassing discipline that foremost seeks to understand the Earth and all of its human and natural complexities-- not merely where objects are, but how they have changed and come to be. As "the bridge between the human and physical sciences," geography is divided into two main branches - human geography and physical geography.[4][5]<br>  <br>  Introduction<br>  <br>  Traditionally, geographers have been viewed the same way as cartographers and people who study place names and numbers. Although many geographers are trained in toponymy and cartology, this is not their main preoccupation. Geographers study the spatial and temporal distribution of phenomena, processes and feature as well as the interaction of humans and their environment.[6] As space and place affect a variety of topics such as economics, health, climate, plants and animals, geography is highly interdisciplinary.“ mere names of places...are not geography... know by heart a whole gazetteer full of them would not, in itself, constitute anyone a geographer. Geography has higher aims than this: it seeks to classify phenomena (alike of the natural and of the political world, in so far as it treats of the latter), to compare, to generalize, to ascend from effects to causes, and, in doing so, to trace out the great laws of nature and to mark their influences upon man. This is 'a description of the world'—that is Geography. In a word Geography is a Science—a thing not of mere names but of argument and reason, of cause and effect. ”<br>    — William Hughes, 1863[7]<br>  <br>  <br>  Geography as a discipline can be split broadly into two main sub fields: human geography and physical geography. The former focuses largely on the built environment and how space is created, viewed and managed by humans as well as the influence humans have on the space they occupy. The latter examines the natural environment and how the climate, vegetation & life, soil, water, and landforms are produced and interact.[8] As a result of the two subfields using different approaches a third field has emerged, which is environmental geography. Environmental geography combines physical and human geography and looks at the interactions between the environment and humans.[6]<br>  <br>  Branches of geography<br>  <br>  Physical geography<br>  Main article: Physical geography<br>  <br>  Physical geography (or physiogeography) focuses on geography as an Earth science. It aims to understand the physical lithosphere, hydrosphere, atmosphere, pedosphere, and global flora and fauna patterns (biosphere). Physical geography can be divided into the following broad categories:   <br>  Biogeography Climatology & paleoclimatology Coastal geography Env. geog. & management<br>     <br>  Geodesy Geomorphology Glaciology Hydro... & Hydrography<br>     <br>  Landscape ecology Oceanography Pedology Palaeogeog...<br>  <br>  Quaternary science<br>  <br>  <br>  Human geography<br>  Main article: Human geography<br>  <br>  Human geography is a branch of geography that focuses on the study of patterns and processes that shape human interaction with various environments. It encompasses human, political, cultural, social, and economic aspects. While the major focus of human geography is not the physical landscape of the Earth (see physical geography), it is hardly possible to discuss human geography without referring to the physical landscape on which human activities are being played out, and environmental geography is emerging as a link between the two. Human geography can be divided into many broad categories, such as:   <br>  Cultural geography Development geography Economic geography Health geography<br>     <br>  Historical & Time geog. Political geog. & Geopolitics Pop. geog. or Demography Religion geography<br>     <br>  Social geography Transportation geography Tourism geography Urban geography<br>  <br>  <br>  Various approaches to the study of human geography have also arisen through time and include:<br>  Behavioral geography<br>  Feminist geography<br>  Culture theory<br>  Geosophy<br>  <br>  Environmental geography<br>  Main article: Environmental geography<br>  <br>  Environmental geography is the branch of geography that describes the spatial aspects of interactions between humans and the natural world.

OkJNoU9Uaa	The eye is a region of mostly calm weather found at the center of strong tropical cyclones. The eye of a storm is a roughly circular area and typically 30–65 km (20–40 miles) in diameter. It is surrounded by the eyewall, a ring of towering thunderstorms where the most severe weather of a cyclone occurs. The cyclone's lowest barometric pressure occurs in the eye, and can be as much as 15% lower than the atmospheric pressure outside the storm.<br>  <br>  In strong tropical cyclones, the eye is characterized by light winds and clear skies, surrounded on all sides by a towering, symmetric eyewall. In weaker tropical cyclones, the eye is less well-defined, and can be covered by the central dense overcast, which is an area of high, thick clouds which show up brightly on satellite imagery. Weaker or disorganized storms may also feature an eyewall which does not completely encircle the eye, or have an eye which features heavy rain. In all storms, however, the eye is the location of the storm's minimum barometric pressure: the area where the atmospheric pressure at sea level is the lowest.

Work in the physics sense that is.  <br>  <br>  If you have a function F that describes a force field (such as the gravitational field or electric field) Then integrating (F? ds) over a path gives the work done on a particle that moves along that path.<br>  <br>  You can think of the path as being split up into infinitesimally small lines of length dr.  The work along each of these lines is F? ds , where F is the force of the field at that point.  Integrating then adds up all these little pieces.

These waves can be longer than a football field or as short as a football.<br>  <br>  Electromagnetic waves travel through space either directly, or have their path altered by reflection, refraction or diffraction. The intensity of the waves diminishes due to geometric dispersion or the inverse-square law.  <br>  <br>  Some energy may also be absorbed by the intervening medium in some cases. Noise will generally alter the desired signal.  Electromagnetic interference comes from natural sources, as well as from artificial sources such as other transmitters and accidental radiators. <br>  <br>  Noise is also produced at every step due to the inherent properties of the devices used. If the magnitude of the noise is large enough, the desired signal will no longer be discernible; this is the fundamental limit to the range of radio communications.<br>  <br>  See the table in the second link below for how the different frequencies are utilized for different elevations or distances.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.

It can be melted, cast, formed and machined much like these metals and it conducts electric current. In fact often the same equipment and fabrication methods are used as for steel.<br>  <br>  Light Weight<br>  Aluminium is a very light metal with a specific weight of 2.7 g/cm3, about a third that of steel. For example, the use of aluminium in vehicles reduces dead-weight and energy consumption while increasing load capacity. Its strength can be adapted to the application required by modifying the composition of its alloys.<br>  <br>  Corrosion Resistance<br>  Aluminium naturally generates a protective oxide coating and is highly corrosion resistant. Different types of surface treatment such as anodising, painting or lacquering can further improve this property. It is particularly useful for applications where protection and conservation are required.<br>  <br>  Electrical and Thermal Conductivity<br>  Aluminium is an excellent heat and electricity conductor and in relation to its weight is almost twice as good a conductor as copper. This has made aluminium the most commonly used material in major power transmission lines.<br>  <br>  Reflectivity<br>  Aluminium is a good reflector of visible light as well as heat, and that together with its low weight, makes it an ideal material for reflectors in, for example, light fittings or rescue blankets.<br>  <br>  Ductility<br>  Aluminium is ductile and has a low melting point and density. In a molten condition it can be processed in a number of ways. Its ductility allows products of aluminium to be basically formed close to the end of the product’s design.<br>  <br>  Impermeable and Odourless<br>  Aluminium foil, even when it is rolled to only 0.007 mm thickness, is still completely impermeable and lets neither light aroma nor taste substances out. Moreover, the metal itself is non-toxic and releases no aroma or taste substances which makes it ideal for packaging sensitive products such as food or pharmaceuticals.<br>  <br>  Recyclability<br>  Aluminium is 100 percent recyclable with no downgrading of its qualities. The re-melting of aluminium requires little energy: only about 5 percent of the energy required to produce the primary metal initially is needed in the recycling process.<br>  <br>  Non-toxic<br>  Aluminium is not poisonous and is therefore highly suitable for the preparation and storage of food.<br>  <br>  Joining<br>  Aluminium can be joined using all the normal methods available such as welding, soldering, adhesive bonding and riveting

To an observer at rest, however, the persons in the rocket would appear to be moving slower and time would appear to be passing more slowly.  In theory, if you could accelerate a rocket up to a speed that is near the speed of light (we can't do so with present technology) and send it out into space for a long period of time (e.g. 40 years), when it returned, everyone on Earth would have aged 40 years but the persons on the rocket would have aged much less because time (relative to time on Earth) will have slowed down for them.|`|5gG42iOpaa	Actually, you experience time slower near the speed of light.<br>  <br>  At speed of light time might be at a stand still or reverse (hypothesized by physicists but unable to be proven) but such a question is pointless since matter cannot go as fast as light (ever).<br>  <br>  The dilation would depend on how "just below" light speed it really is.  The closer it is the more dilated time is.

There are classes of storms, though. Thunderstorms, hurricanes, tornadoes, blizzards, etc.<br>  <br>  Of course, occasionally it rains men, but you'll have to ask Cher about that one.|`|OkJNoU9Uaa	Convection rain<br>  Convection rain is found in hot wet places of the world. Sometimes, it is also found in tropical deserts and inland areas during summer, when temperatures are high. During daytime, the sun makes the ground very hot. Air near the ground surface is heated by conduction. The heated air expands, becoming less dense and rising in a strong upwards air current. When the temperature of the rising air falls to the dew point, water vapor shrinks into thick clouds and forms convection rain.<br>  <br>  <br>  Rain<br>  Relief rain usually occurs along coastal areas where a line of hills runs along to the coast. When wet onshore wind from the sea meet a mountain, hill and barrier, it is forced to rise along the slope and cools. When the air temperature falls to its dew point, water vapor condenses to form clouds. When the clouds can no longer hold the water droplets, relief rain begins to fall on the windward slope of the mountain. On the leeward slope, air sinks, it is warmed and further dried by compression. Therefore, the leeward slope is known as rain shadow. Moist winds blow in from the sea and are forced to rise over the land. The air cools and the water vapour condenses, forming rain drops. Relief rain is also a very dense and cold mixture of precipitation.<br>  <br>  <br>  Frontal rain<br>  Frontal rain is when a cold front meets a warm air front. The less dense warm air rises and condenses forming clouds. These clouds get heavier and it eventually rains. The cold air front tends to come from the north west and the warm air front comes from the south west.<br>  <br>  Convectional Rain<br>  Convectional rain is when the hot sun heats any water on the ground. The water from the ground is evaporated. Water vapor rise, cools and condenses at dew point. Clouds form and the rain falls. The whole thing happens again.<br>  <br>  Rainstorm<br>  Rainstorm is a sudden heavy fall of rain. It may cause floods on land which is not much above the level of the sea for example, flat coastal land and river basins. Too much water can make rivers overflow and cause floods. Also, landslides may happen.

The apexes of the triangle are generally believed to be Bermuda; Miami, Florida; and San Juan, Puerto Rico. The US Board of Geographic Names does not recognize the Bermuda Triangle as an official name. The US Navy does not believe the Bermuda Triangle exists. It is reported that Lloyd's of London, the world's leading market for specialist insurance, does not charge higher premiums for vessels transiting this heavily traveled area.<br>  The most famous US Navy losses which have occurred in the area popularly known as the Bermuda Triangle are USS Cyclops in March 1918 and the aircraft of Flight 19 in December 1945. The ship probably sank in an unexpected storm, and the aircraft ran out of fuel and crashed into the ocean -- no physical traces of them have ever been found. Another well known disappearance is the civilian tanker SS Marine Sulphur Queen carrying bulk molten sulfur which sank in February 1963. Although the wreck of Marine Sulphur Queen has not been located, a life preserver and other floating artifacts were recovered. These disappearances have been used to provide credence to the popular belief in the mystery and purported supernatural qualities of the "Bermuda Triangle."|`|ZSQF8InRaa	The Bermuda Triangle is an area of sea that is the area between Miami and Puerto Rico.<br>  the exact reason is unknown but many aircrafts,ships disappeared over this region ..it is said that this is due to a magnetic dipole..others say that it is an exteremely low pressure region ..n so..this has happened...but der r no clear evidences..|`|PwiLugypaa	No, Bermuda triangle is not a black hole.If there was a black hole it would have sucked the Earth in.According to some sources the is a worm hole present over there.A worm hole is a shortcut in space and time.So the ships go but do not return.|`|mr7CqU3Xaa	according to me a bermuda triangle is a gate towards another world <br>   but still the  mystrey continiues........................|`|91nAPOLtaa	some think so!
