20090205003851AAZIkB8	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Other - Careers & Employment	This online job application asks for "Current Salary" and "Desired Salary" - what do I do? :(?	So I'm online filling out an application for a paralegal position in Houston, and there are two lines that say "current salary" and "desired salary", respectively.    For the current salary, I work an on-campus job for 12 hours a week, and make minimum wage ($6.55/hour).  To calculate current salary, should I just do (12 hours)*(52 weeks)*($6.55) and plug in the result?    And what do I write in for "Desired Salary"?  If I ask something really low, that's all they'll pay me :(  But if I ask for something really high, they'll laugh and discard my application!! :((    What do i do for this line?

Non bisogna andare all'estero.Se volete trovare un vero lavoro e se volete vivere dovete ribellarvi e protestare in piazza almeno dovete essere il 90 % della popolazione regionale.Se non vi ribellate il governo vi sottometterà,anzi siete già sottomessi e ora vi spiego il xchè.   Voi volete il lavoro ,giusto o no???voi cercate sempre le scorciatorie più facili,il governo e lo stato chiamano i mafiosi x togliere i lavori (distrugge aziende vere ,ricatta le aziende) e non rimane lavoro.Allora voi classici siciliani cretini che fate???ve lo dico io che fate:   Prima delle elezioni voi andate a chiedere la grazia divina agli onorevoli promettendo il lavoro in cambio del voto.Loro dicono a tutti di si,poi dopo le elezioni loro scappano e non si fanno più vedere e voi non avete un posto di lavoro, parlo del 98 % dei siciliani (entrano solo il 2 % dei siciliani che sarebbero i parenti,amici degli onorevoli).Poi alcuni di questi solo lo 0,00000000000000000000000000000001% ha il coraggio di fare protesta tramite insulti,minacce,ecc.Invece il rimante 99,9999999999999999999999999999999999999... della popolazione siciliana sta zitta,allora i coraggiosi siciliani(cioè 1 su 60miliardi) vengono presi di nascosto dai mafiosi x ordine degli onorevoli e vengono o ricattati o uccisi e la gente sta zitta.Allora i siciliani il 99,99999999999999999999999999999999% della popolazione va al nord per trovare lavoro.Qui fanno i precari e ogni 1-4 anni al massimo devono cambiare casa e lavoro e trasferirsi.Questi precari non possono avere ne figli,ne famiglia,non possono acquistare casa.Siccome tutti vanno a Nord ,i proprietari delle case si arricchiscono affitando case.Una percentuale dei loro guadagni va a loro ,l'altra al governo e l'altra ai mafiosi.Ditemi se questa è la vita che sognate????Se volete una vità sicura e un lavoro serio,sicuro,e ben pagato dovete ribbellarvi e fargli vedere al governo chi è chi comanda.Cosi con po di casino loro vi daranno tutto quello che volete,e vivrete una bella vita.   PS Se io vi dico queste cose e per farvi svegliare ,se poi non mi ascoltate vivrete nell'ombra di chi vi vuole fregare e soffocare.Poi fate come volete io vi ho avvertito.   COSA NE PENSATE?????

Ever since my boss found out i was pregnant hes been cutting my hours slowly. This week i only have 19 hours on the schedule and i used to normally have about 38 to 40 hours a week. Since i became pregnant i usually ask to go the bathroom once or twice a day and i try really hard to hold it and not ask that much. Well today i asked my boss to go the bathroom and he rudely said that i would have to wait and a minute later he sent someone over to cover me so i could go and this was the only time used the bathroom through a six hour shift. Then while i was on my ten minute break one of the lady's i work with came up to me to tell me that when i was in the bathroom that my boss joked to one of the other managers about me in front of her. He said "now jennifer goes to the bathroom too much and that's why im cutting her hours",and then he laughed about it. I feel like i am being discriminated against because im pregnant. should i confront my boss about it ? or should i call to complain? or am i overreacting?

20090204221307AAT8pJT	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Other - Careers & Employment	I don't know what job I want when I'm older.?	I'm a sophomore in high school and I'm really dreading getting a job.   I'm not more strongly interested in lit verses science, or social studies, or math. I have a 4.0 right now... I feel like society says we have to go to college and we have to get a job, and I guess so far I'm going with it.      I really enjoy photography and sharing them on flickr, as well as seeing other's work. Also I enjoy traveling, movies (often meaningful or indie), reading (meaningful, social structures, rebelling), fashion, magazines, and indie rock/ folk rock. I fancy the pages in magazines (Nylon, seventeen, rolling stone, teen vogue); the ads, pictures, layout. I guess it would be kind of neat to work for a magazine company, but doing what exactly...      my favorite movie is Into the Wild.      any blurbs or suggestions you have are helpful(:

Unfortunately, my husband and I filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy today. My son has a JC Penney credit card and he asked for an additional card for me. I did not want JC Penney included in the bankruptcy since it is my sons account and it will continue to be paid. The lawyers office said since it was associated with my social security number and was on my credit report, they had to include it. They said I could keep making my payments and advised me to call JC Penney to let them know. I called and was told it is a joint account and when they receive the bankruptcy papers, the account will be closed. They said they did not know how it would affect my son's credit. My son has excellent credit. Will it affect my sons credit? Is there anything that I can do?

My parents annual income is around $120,000, which is always asked the on applications, but I'm pretty sure their credit score is around 580ish. Would it be better to apply at small, individually owned apartment complexes, or the huge ones that are owned by corporations? The one i got denied for last year was owned by a corporation and had very strict rental criteria. Would any places be willing to accept my parents as cosigners if they put an additional security deposit or down payment?

It isn't there now but it has been predicted that in the next two months it will be at 0%.  The continual dropping of interest rates is not boosting the economy.

I'm a full time university student and i don't get youth allowance or austudy or any gov assistance.      I thought i would get it before under the taxpayer section, but then i released that really i didn't actually pay any tax. I worked in the holidays and got tax removed from my pay, but i got it all back at the end of the financial year because i didn't earn over the tax threshold.      If i don't get it, that is really unfair. That means if the tax free threshold is $6000 (its around that). Someone who earned $5999 wouldn't get it whereas someone who earned $6001 would get $950. That is so unfair.      I hope it isn't that. I hope it is just if you had dealings with the tax department in the last financial year.

My family is going through big money problems. It's just me, my mom, my dad and my older sister living with us (I'm 17). The only income that we have been living off is my dad's 700some dollar pay check. My mom lost her job in the summer and I am a part time Nanny living off of 15 dollars a day. My dad's hours just got cut to 40 hours a week so I am even more afraid. We've already been having troubles buying groceries and paying bills... My phone's been shut off (just got it turned on today thanks to my brother) every things just been crazy. Rent is 700 dollars a month and were not even making that much a week anymore. My sister and Mom have been applying everywhere for jobs. My mom worked at a department store for 15 years and was fired all because she asked them to hold a check. And my sister has little experience in anything. They tried for jobs everywhere. Nobody is hiring. I just am going out of my mind. Please give me suggestions of places my mom can apply for. We have no where we can go if we get evicted...      My mom is interested in working in cleaning but she has no prior experience. As with nanny jobs. Please list some websites. I would be really grateful. Times are tough for lots of people in the country right now.      BTW they already applied at just about every fast food place, grocery store, department store, pet store, gas station, everywhere!

20090204233825AA2V3pl	Business & Finance;Other - Business & Finance	How should government regulated a businesses practices?	Okay let’s start from the beginning. With the dying job market there will be a increased interest in alternative ways to make money for the average American. The option most Americans will probably be looking toward will be new/small businesses. The government’s red tape combined with the competition makes it virtually impossible for a new business to survive. If the government were to lessen their control over small businesses by means of zoning laws, permits, inspection costs, and taxes, the possibility of creating a new business would become a more viable option for mainstream Americans. Though American should not expect to become super rich, rather instead hope to make enough to replace the income they lost.                      For the business that don’t just survive but rather thrive this would increase the amount of jobs available for those who can’t handle their own business. For when a business grows to a certain size the government should create a new type of government job. This new position is one that people are trained in the fields of economic decision making and smart business planning. Once a business grows to the point where it employs say 1000 people, a person trained for this position is sent by the government to monitor and advise the company and find the best ways for the company to not go under, preventing the loss of jobs to many Americans. Though this person has no actual power and is strictly an advisor.      When a company grows to ten times this size (10,000 employees) a higher ranking government employee, with a higher level of training comes in. This government employee has more power than the previous. This one has voting power of ten percent of the company, and also has the authority to release information about the companies decision making to the government and recommend whether the government should intervene more with the company.      If the previous government employee recommends more government intervention and the government’s review of information provided is reasonable enough then the government should launch an investigation into the company and it past business practices. If it turns out that the company is at risk of going under or outsourcing then the government should create a list of possibilities for preventing the loss of American jobs and sit down with the company owner(s)/ Executive officers and attempt to determine a viable option.      If a viable option can be reached and the owner(s)/ Executive officers refuse to take it then the company must pay 50% of the salary to all employees that are to be laid off until they are able to find another position paying more than 60 % of their previous income, or pay for the employee to be retrained in the field of the employees choice. If no viable option can be found then there is no way that it may be prevented and therefore will be no penalty as long as the company gives adequate notice to its employees and stockholders.      I believe this is a very fair way government could get companies to compromise on what's best for the company as well as what's best for the employees. And therefore best for the economy. What do you think?

I bought a vacant land lot number 407 in LA city, CA from the public LA Tax collector auction tax sale for $11,000 from april 2008.    The next lot 406 had a house which was built from 1906. both lot 406 and lot 407 belong to the same owner from 1940 to 1997. Then the onwer owed county tax then both lot was sold at LA Tax collector auction sale from 1997 for different owners.    The old owner of my vacant lot owed county tax again, the Tax Collector sold the land for me in 2008. The house in 406 lot was forclosesuded in March 2008, Now the bank sold it for some one.       I didnt know how long the house owners built a driveway and some of itbuilding over my lot. The building built over my lot 5 feet, the driveway and the fence cover all of my lot. From outside, it look like there are no vacant land. They took almost all of my land       The neighbor next to my land just bought the house from foreclosed, and all the deeds didn’t mention any kinds of easements. I understand about the description easement in CA. The neighbor cannot claim adverted possession because they did not pay tax for 5 years. The only way they can claim is description easement. But the description easement didn’t mean they have the right to exclude me(actual land owner) from using my land. If the judge allows them to clam the description easement, then it means exclude us from building in our land (similar to adversed possession).       What can I do please? If I sue them can I win and make them take off the building which over my lot

20090205031323AAsG8WG	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Other - Careers & Employment	Questions about Jobseeker's Allowance stuff?	My cousin has been unemployed for a couple of months, having been made redundant (compulsory redundancies because of the financial situation a lot of companies are in at the moment) towards the end of last year. For the first time in her life, she is claiming Jobseeker's Allowance and has this week recieved a letter asking her to go into the Jobcentre for a back to work interview. Somebody told her that after this interview she will be signing on once a week rather than once every two weeks, which is no problem, but is this true? The only experience I have ever had with claiming JSA was when I was 21 and it was only for a matter of a couple of weeks so I don't know how best to advise her. And even given that, I know that the rules change after a claimer turns 25, and my cousin is now 27 so I don't think anything I could tell her would be valuable anyway. With that in mind, this is what she needs to know:      1. How long does she have to be unemployed before being considered "long-term unemployed"? Because I always thought it was six months, but apparently after you turn 25, that changes to 18 months. So does that mean that she will be signing on every week if she makes it to 18 months unemployed rather than the once every two weeks she does now?      2. How long is it before she gets the New Deal thing? Is that what happens with the longterm unemployment?      Anyone that can help, that would be great, especially those who have claimed JSA over the age of 25 or who have worked for the Jobcentre.      And in case anyone is thinking about judging her, she is trying really hard to find a job so hopefully all this won't even be an issue. We are a hard working family and my cousin had held her job for several years before the compulsory redundancy, so she is not a benefits scrounger, she just doesn't know how the system works.      Thanks guys :).

20090205020602AAbjk8J	Business & Finance;Corporations	Target Return Policy?	I bought a Xbox 360 game called Too Human from Target for 28 dollars Well for about every 7 gameplay hours the game screws up with a disc unreadable error.  This is the ONLY game that has ever done this, all my other games play fine, i.e battlefield bad company has 100's of games logged on it and not one error message.   Now I doubt theres something wrong with the individual disc.  It's a dual-layer dvd I found out and apparently some xbox360 dvd drives can't read dual layer dvds consistently all the time.      They only had about 2 copies left when I bought it.  If I go back and they don't have the game for me to exchange it for another copy, what happens?  Do they give me store credit or what?  I'll be pretty upset if they just tell me tough luck or to take it up with the manufacturer.  I doubt getting another cd will do anything anyway, I heard the game was pretty buggy.
20090205034249AAqkEu3	Business & Finance;Other - Business & Finance	Advice on airline consumer complaint?	I was wondering if someone could give me some advice on my complaint letter.      ======================================...      I recently purchased online tickets with your company under booking reference XXXXXXX and due to unforeseen circumstances was forced to change the outbound flight to a later date.      After logging into your website to the ‘manage your booking’ screen I found that the option to change flight details was not available.  This left me no option but to ring your call centre to change the details.      When I spoke to your customer services call centre I was told that the further charges amounted to ￡261 plus the credit card booking fee of ￡4.57, taking the total amount payable to ￡265.57.  Whilst I completely disagree with the ￡27.50 per person per way administration fee to simply change a name on a computer screen, this charge is clearly stated on your website and therefore I was aware of this charge.      On calculation of the remainder costs I was disappointed to find that I had been charged a further ￡6 per person as the change to the flight details was made as a telephone fare and not a web fare.  Whilst I understand that the cheapest fares are available on the internet, thus prompting me to book this way in the first instance, I am appalled to see that you apply this extra difference in fare when you do not give the option to change the booking on the screen.  On complaint to your call centre (a further 30 minutes on the phone, at 10p per minute, therefore a ￡3 call charge) I was advised that bookings including wheelchair users and infants are not able to change bookings on the internet and so have to make these changes by telephone.  There is nowhere on your confirmation or terms and conditions stating that changes to a booking that includes infants must be made by telephone.      I am sure that you can understand my disappointment that I have been charged a further ￡36 in price difference because your company does not allow me to change details on the internet.      Incidentally, during this telephone complaint, I was challenged as to who the lead passenger of the booking was.  When the booking was made I named myself as the lead passenger.  After I had paid the charges to change the flight date the lead passenger was changed by your company and therefore I was presented with a challenge as to ‘guess’ the name of the passenger your company had decided to allocate as lead passenger.  On a further, more important note, the 2nd confirmation email to confirm the booking change does not list any booked luggage on the inbound flight.  I am now left to assume that we are actually allowed to bring our luggage home with us and do not have to post them back by surface mail!!      To finalise, as I mentioned above, although I disagree with your administration charge to change a booking date so far in ahead of the travel date on a paperless budget airline, these charges are clearly stated and I had no other alternative.  However, I am entering a complaint on the level of discrimination to be told that wheelchair users and bookings with infants who are not allowed to change their bookings online are then left subject to a higher price.      I enclose a copy of your current website terms and conditions for you to see that there is no mention of extra charges being applied if your booking includes wheelchair users or infants.      I would like to take the opportunity to charge you ￡30.00 for the administration costs of this letter and look forward to receiving a reply from you challenging why you think the extra costs are justified and do not present a claim of discrimination.      With regards            Mrs XXXXXX      Enc.        JET2.COM Terms and Conditions

Should I skip that price entirely? Should I look for a 40-50 or $60,000 house? I am pre approved for up to $65,000 but, I really do not want to pay that much, if a mere $39,900 house will have four walls and NON LEAKING roof! Why would I pay that much when, a bargain house will suffice to meet my needs??? can someone please please help me? I am so lost! I am in Kalamazoo, MI, by the way. I am seeking very rural houses in the $39,900 range. (as I understand it, there is more value in a $ X price house in a rural area vs. $ X price in the city.) So, does this information assist you in answering my question? I really , really, really, appreciate your honest answer. I don't trust my realtor or loan officer. OF course, they keep encouranging me to buy the $60,000 house! LOL HA H HA HA, they want more money! I am not sure that the $60,000 house fits my modest income! honest! what if I want to buy a car?!!! I'd like a car someday! gees! I make $1563 per month. My realtor , maybe, does not understand my budget as I do. break down on a $60,000 loan is this:  $500 mortgage, $100 heat? gas? $100 elect? I'm not sure. $15 phone (yeah, "special" discount), $300 food (yes, it is a high food budget for 2-3 people), $200 for toothpaste, duct tape, clothes, "extras", so, I save $300 each month? is that OK? is that a "good" budget? what if I wanted a car? insurance? gas money? how much does that cost? what if my income goes away???? then, I would lose my house! I was actually intersted in buying a CHEAP (not even "affordable" or "modest" describes this: CHEAP does) CHEAP older mobile home. I could save all my extra would be mortgage payments in  a savings account to buy a real house or a new manufactured home on my RURAL land. (not a LOT, in MH park. no.) What do you think? the rural land I am looking at is actually valuable. It is against state land. Other hunters/fishers/outdoors enthusiasts will find it very appealling. It has Re SALE value., it's not merely valuable exclusively to "me". sorry so long. THANKS

My house settlement has finally happened a couple of days ago, after the original settlement date was mid Dec 08.   We intially had problems with my partner's ID, but by January the bank has made mistakes by not sending all the paperwork thru to FHOG and my settlement agent. We have now been charged a $1600 late fee by the seller's , who have been charged the same amount by the people they are buying a house from.    If the bank hadn't have stuffed up in the last 3 - 4 weeks, we wouldn't have been charged a late fee.   The bank refuses to have a bar of our arguement, that they should atleast cover part of the fee, due to their mistakes.   My settlement agent has emails to prove they stuffed up. It was actually the branch manager that didn't send all the required information and she did it twice.   What can  i do ??????

20090205025603AA1teaU	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Other - Careers & Employment	Urgent Advice Please !!?	This is on behalf of my husband: He has worked in a local garage for nearly 7 yrs now and he is having problems with the management, the thing is his contract is to work in our local branch but as needs arise he can be moved to another branch to cover. His boss is now trying to make him work in one of the other branchs which is about 45 mins drive away, the thing is my husband has no transport the trains and buses run too late for his working hours and the family car I need to travel to my job which is 20 mins drive away, I would walk but I am 5 months pregnant and to get a taxi would cost us an extra ￡60 - ￡70 a week.   My husbands boss has told him he has to start work at the other branch from Monday we have wrote a letter stating why this is impossible and we have made loads of phone calls but they dont seem to care. The other point I should make is there are 2 other lads working with my husband at the moment one with no family ties and his own transport and the other who travels from were they want my husband to work.      We think they want to get rid of my husband but they have no legal reason to sack him and they dont want to pay him redundancy which he has said he will take.      What are my husbands options please

My question is that they are raising the Tax Home Buyers Credit from $7,500 to $15,00 or %10 of the value of your home.      Originally it was the $7,500 that you had to pay back over 15 years interest free,  then there was talk of not having to pay the $7,500 back.      Should I wait to file my taxes for 2008?  I do qualify for the tax credit, but I do not want to miss out on the $15,000 if it passed Congress..

20090205062155AASCrWS	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Other - Careers & Employment	I need some Job advice.?	In this current times of recession I have had the opportunity to setup multiple interviews every week. (knock on wood) My problem with them is that I will preform well and still not get a phone call back. Or go through the interview process and they hire me but my family says its to far and what would i do for constant transportation especially    when were seeing 6 more weeks of winter.    My current situation is I have a trail today and its close to home and at a location that I would see myself working at. Transportation is great. So heres my problem, the last time I went to this side of town I trailed at the location and they liked me, the chef said he would call me on a certain day. The day came and it left, so i called back the next day which was a dead day at a time I knew he would be available. When I spoke to him he sounded stressed out for me to call him and said do i really want the answer. Apparently I did more than well during the trail so I couldn't understand the question. So i said yes Ii would like to know if I am Hired. He told me "No" and i was shocked. So today I have a different trail at the same part of town. The chef told me that he was going to call me Tuesday night to tell me when I can join the team for a trail. Tuesday night came and left. So i called him Wednesday and he said "oh hey hey ...Ｉhad off yesterday and couldn't call you. “ I had told him if your having trouble doing the schedule i wouldn't mind working in the morning. He tells me “ oh no you cant we gave that to a guy that came yesterday and trailed with us he said he would prefer a 9/5. Umm if you want you can come in today (Thursday) and another time at the end of the week. I replied okay I will see you then. He said cool okay bye.  As i hanged up the phone I realized    that the chef just lied to me and said he had off yesterday but we trailed a guy yesterday. How could you do that if you had off.    So do I go to the trail which we never  spoke about how much he was going to pay me. Do I go today to prove something, or am I being setup for the same thing that happened last time. which was that they liked me but didn't want to hire me. I really just don't want to waist time and a possible other position else where. What should I do. I need advice!!!
