1F6KJt0oaa	If you are talking about McDonald's they use it to refer to their special blend of ketchup, Mustard, Mayonnaise, relish, and egg  Err I mean Thousand Island dressing.  Typically though it just means a sauce that they don't want to reveal the ingredients to, though, they have to let you know what is in it because of allergies they don't have to tell you proportions.|`|nEm9xu1yaa	Semen.|`|k8HpMaHxaa	Get ready for some disgusting answers...<br>  <br>  We rarely use the term 'secret sauce'. Maybe 'supreme' here and there. Sometimes they use it to spice up the description of a not so exciting dish.|`|Y5IUse1vaa	I think that "secret sauce" is a suace that gets made up at the last minute and could contain any old thing that the chef finds in the kitchen.. If it were advertised as a specific sauce, you might be dissappointed when it arrived. This way, you have no idea what may be in it. The chef is a winner!!!|`|XCvRniERaa	A secret recipe of sauces they whipped together to make your food extra tasty!|`|ba52jQHyaa	It just sounds better then "we put Ranch Dressing on your cheese burger"|`|jxg88KqFaa	It is an easy to make sauce, which normally incorporates company leftovers...|`|1eAASZQyaa	Secret sauce is a sauce somebody makes their selves and donot want anyone to know what they put i it. Thats all it is!|`|KW0zyeqiaa	i do not know.
KW0zyeqiaa	wow.|`|EcdelIHtaa	yea there are nightclubs where minors can enter<br>  they usually give out bracelets to those who are over 21 so the security guards and bartenders know who to sell drinks to and who can drink...|`|NJT54RZIaa	There are nightclubs were you can be 16 to enter but the ending age limit i believe is 25. The place is called zero gravity
b8tgCAQJaa	In the past, it was because Mexican-style food wasn't as popular here as it is in the US.<br>  <br>  There were some Taco Bells in the UK in the 80s and 90s, but these closed due (presumably) to the fact that they didn't make a profit.<br>  <br>  However, things change, and Yum! Brands (the owners of Taco Bell) are planning a major expansion of the brand into Europe, with Spain and eventually the UK getting some Taco Bells, starting this year.<br>  <br>  Their reasoning is that Mexican-style food is gaining popularity in the UK, and fast food in general is expanding because people want affordable dining options in the recession.|`|ZjYLTdovaa	darien says its because there are no spanish speaking chihuahuas over there. im just looking at him like he's retarded.<br>  <br>  in my opinion i think its just because taco bell out of all mcdonalds other business, taco bell prolly grosses the least. you'd rather have mcdonalds instead of a funky ill prepared taco on any given day right. your best bet is to locate that great mexican restaurant like Mi Hacienda (best burritos of my LIFE) in your neighborhood. you'd never want to go to taco bell in the first place!|`|b1w5FUGzaa	My cousin visted from the uk a few summers ago and she had never heard of taco bell before so we took her there and she didn't like it lol.  I think brits arent' that into mexican food (not like taco bell is authentic mexican food anyways !).  But it's the same reason why we don't have any good fish and chip shops over here !|`|z6EnUnxLaa	Soon.|`|HfYXXUhBaa	good question, i would love a Taco Bell in the UK, if you go to Taco Bell on wikipedia it says that they will introduce stores by 2010!!|`|PymVygFraa	Unfair =[<br>  Lolll xx|`|3C0e9FVMaa	Because hardly any Mexicans live in the U.K.  There all over the States.|`|dyvliTTbaa	like u sed wear crap and boring x|`|1XiTBn28aa	Actually they've opened in the U.K before as tests to see if it was worth bringing business to the U.K. It was not successful and they closed down. they've never returned since and not sure when they will.<br>  <br>  On the Bright side, Nando's is great but cheap depending on what to order, has the mexican flair too.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|CUEco2LEaa	In the UK, if people want Mexican food, they will go to a proper Mexican restaurant. I can't see anyone buying Taco's, remember the states is next to Mexico and has a much higher latino population, which is a big influence.|`|E78LhrG5aa	~B-cuz Taco Bell iz a USA fast food and is a small comunity of fast food. So they ethier dont want to expand their restraunts because they dont want to become lawsuited or something.|`|aG0Kfd22aa	Because Mexicans hate the UK. Period|`|uk2nd9CHaa	i know! when i was in america, i loved taco bell! its well tasty! maybe they dont want to expand it, or think that they wont make enough money, with the whole "credit crunch" lol!|`|IybadT1saa	Because they taste like dog poo! (in my opinion)|`|459f3f76910158328f943e8adaa02baeaa	what no taco bell for you; that sucks its soo good|`|gaXUIduMaa	Taco Bell is part of Yum! Brands and they do not have the infrastructure to open up locations internationally (yet).  Truthfully, you are not missing much.|`|T55YPfXUaa	because taco bell is already fattening enough<br>  so the UK doesn't want anymore of fat foods|`|2dJIJr6uaa	You think Nando's is expensive? hun you can eat there for ï¿¡5! and like you said...it is a restuarant! pretty cheap restaurant if you ask me.|`|UMzd6FHWaa	Because the UK have more stringent food health and safety laws.|`|3FKMMoXkaa	coz Britian already has crap that makes ppl obese...we dont need more.|`|KFagjt8Jaa	its because we like to eat food that's dead not still moving about...
6QJe4Mlyaa	They opened one on Randall Rd in Algonquin Illinois.  It opened at the end of December or beginning of Jan.|`|UdtzY5ciaa	None in Jersey either.  Went to one in Florida once, and it was terrible. I've been told that was just that particular location.|`|PH1eFiqwaa	Come to Texas they are everywhere  here.|`|8e373a7bc6b3c784f2bae9cc02a6cf20aa	We have them in Florida!

13AAxlc7aa	I think you would be hard pressed to find one. The best you could do would be to ask for specific meals without the additives as you mentioned. I you explain you are a diabetic and tell them what you can't have in your food then they could modify a dish for you. I would suggest however that you do the research on what you can and can't eat and then best advise them.|`|VXcp8hvHaa	mcdonalds?
9Sx4PzBmaa	actually several places in our area have similar deals...hungry howies and dominos have had them recently...and here our hot and ready is 5.99 :-(    but it doesn't cost much to make a plain pep. pizza...I would estimate less than $2 a pizza as all their indredients come in bulk.  So that would be a $3 profit, more than 50% on it which is pretty good.  Add to that that many people will also buy a soda or some dips or add on crazy crust...so the good deal draws them in and then they buy more!|`|TGuThoHpaa	I love their pizza! It's fast and easy and yummy! The only thing I don't like about it is that when I got a gift card from there, I went back to the exact same Little Ceasers and they couldn't do gift cards! So I traveled all around Phoenix to try to find a little ceasers. I finally found one and bought yummy pizza!!!|`|f434a964a9112c76af410074c8ceb684aa	Because, it's crap.|`|NRK00SsTaa	It's a great deal, especially when I'm trying to save money & away from the house...They did go up to $6.00 tho, but still just as cheap as a frozen Pizza & it's hot n' fresh|`|mIj958p1aa	because they are popular and since they are so cheap they make enough money from the profits they make because they are competitive and people would rather pay $5 for a large pizza that taste yummy and is hot n read than $10+ for the same thing. economy isn't so good now a days and most people can't waste money on a $10+ pizza so why get a $10+ pizza when you can get the same thing that taste jsut as good for $5. people will also sometimes buy bread/cheese sticks, soda, salad, etc... since they have extra money left over since the pizza isn't so expensive.|`|K6fasl6kaa	volume|`|s34LTW9maa	cheap ingredients and there hoping your order other items

AA12297806	the first answer is populated by students and but has that kind of music. nottm is a universtity city so lots of students thrive in the bar and club industry that nottm is famed for. as i don't share your taste in music, i'm afraid of not knowing where you could go for rnb choons.|`|30ORwqodaa	the only places that i can think of are oceana + squares +halo hope this helps :)
