20090222144148AAgQrVS	Computers & Internet;Security	Removing a Trojan BrisvA virus?	Hi Can Someone help please i recently got a Trojan BrisvA  on my computer and after running the Norton removal tool  I made sure to disconnect from the internet first i managed to remove it however its also on my external hard drive on  two infected songs, i cant delete them  it won't seem to let me. Every windows explorer application freezes up, and takes a long time to load  I click 'delete',  it then asks to confirm the action, and then tells me that I don't have permission to access the destination folder, which is odd, because i'm the administrator.  i'd just like to get rid of this virus, Any help would be appreciated, id just like to find a  way of deleting the infected file from my computer. i was trying to run the tool in safe mode but when i start on safe mode the external drive is not recognised

20090222145409AAI3Vye	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Other - Hardware	Screen resolution and contrast ratio?	I have an Acer 20'' TFT monitor (I can be more specific with the model if needs be) and it has a contrast ratio of 1000:1.      I find that the screen appears too bright, and faint lines and details don't show up, and 'white' tends to be very bright. This can happen even when the brightness is set to 0 and contrast between 0 and 50 (although its quite dull because of low contrast). Is there anyway this can be changed so its not as bright but there is still enough contrast?      Also the resolution of the monitor is 1400 x 1050, yet I can only go up to 1280 x 1024 in the properties. I was wondering if this is because of my graphics card and whether I need to update the driver?

My Computer:   Intel Pentium 3 651MHz   640MB RAM   Windows XP Media Center Edition Version 2002 SP3      I was just making sure everything was all right on my McAfee software, so I clicked "more" to see the version of my mcafee product and other standard information      The problem I found was my DAT Version is still 5506(which was made on 1/25/09). Then I went to McAfee's website to see what the latest DAT is and the latest DAT is 5533. So then I clicked "Update" on McAfee Security Center. It updated my products and said "Updates Successful". So then I went back to see the DAT Version number, and my number is still at 5506. Usually McAfee tells you if the files are not up-to-date, but this time McAfee is not even catching the out-of-date DAT Version.      So what should I do to solve this problem?

20090222150627AAC7ZTT	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Add-ons	I got new memory on my computer and i have problems, please help?	i took my computer down the shop that i got my computer to put more memory on, they put more memory on, brought it back home.....nothing but problems, first of all i have trouble with the internet, i have a wireless connection, but when i brought it back home it never worked, another problem i have is that my windows media player doesn't play dvds, and when im on the internet for awhile (using a few tabs and downloading files - no virus i checked) the more i use windows/tabs, the more buggy my computer becomes, its hard to explain, but the more i spend on the internet, the more slower it gets, the less i can click on (if i open menus some options are missing, if i try to open new tabs it doesn't load) it gets worse and worse as soon over time the windows i can open get less and less, until....i can't open folders, right click, left click, in the end i have to restart the computer, i brought my computer back to the shop but it seems they have no idea what the problem is, they act as if its normal, i spent ￡70 on the memory (over 100 gb) and then when i brought it back i spent ￡5 on a fan that made no difference, so any help would be greatly appreciate it.

A while ago, my dad installed Cybersitter 10 on my laptop (before you ask: NO, I wasn't doing anything illegal/looking at porn).  Recently, I bought a new laptop which I am now using for my internet access, however I am still using my old one for other things and want to clean off some old programs to make room for new ones.  Unfortunately, he can't remember the password for Cybersitter.  To make things worse, he's sent them two emails to recover the password and for some reason it isn't working.  (They take weeks and weeks to respond to problems and I've been reading some horror stories about how bad their customer service is.)      So I need to figure out a way to uninstall Cybersitter without the password.  I'm tired of waiting for the Cybersitter company to get back to my dad and I want to get rid of it.  I tried googling some things on it, but all I found was information on how to remove older versions-- things like deleting files in the system registry, which I am extremely hesitant to try.      Can someone please help me?

20090222160141AAvP5lg	Computers & Internet;Internet;Other - Internet	Problems with my Internet?	my internet hasn't been working right lately.  Any website that doesnt require you to log in in some way works find, but any site like my yahoo email or facebook it takes like 5 to 10 mins to come up. and facebook takes even longer than that if it even comes up. in the last week or so i've only been able to get onto my email just a couple times, and facebook never. i just want to figure out why it's doing this and see if i can fix it.  also all these random websites keep popping up, even though the pop up blocker is set on high.  this seems to happen like at least like every two mins, especially when i'm using like google or the yahoo search. if you could tell me whats th matter, and how i could possibly fix it that would be great! i have the latest version of internet explorer and high speed internet if that helps any...thanks!

Since she got it on her computer it does not let her do anything, just insisting she had to update it from it's site. I wanted to remove  it but could not find where from should I do it? It is not seen anywhere, nor in Program files, neither any other  file, folder or disc. It all looks a complete mess now. I tried to download AVG anti virus but as soon as it is downloaded from Internet, from the most popular and trusted site... the screen gets "empty" and it does not go anywhere and then I can't find AVG file downloaded. I start doing it again and get the same result. What should I do to help this situation?

20090222111559AA7H0Bs	Computers & Internet;Internet;MSN	Windows Live is being retarded. Won't let me update. Won't sign in. HELP?	A few days ago I signed into windows live, and it told me there was a new update available. So I downloaded it... or I thought it did anyway.      It said it worked.      But then for the next two days it kept telling me that i should update, and I did a couple more times.    Well yesterday I tried signing in, and it said: "A newer version is available. You must install the newer version in order to continue. Would you like to do this now?"   and you can choose yes, or no. If you choose yes, it tells you it's updating, then takes you to a page where it says the update is already installed so I don't need to update. Then I go to sign in, and the same thing pops up: "A newer version is available. You must install the newer version in order to continue. Would you like to do this now?" and then you click download and so on and so forth.      This is a never ending loop.      and if you just click 'no' you can't sign in anyway because you have to update to sign in.      I've tried to delete it and reinstall it, but I literally CANNOT find messenger in the add/remove programs window. All I can find anywhere are the other components that go along with Live. I've deleted those, and started over, but the same problem pops up every time.       Someone HAS to know whats going on... HELP. PLEASE.

I have each slide set up with timers but I can't figure out how to get the slides to change on their own.  I've seen it done before in presentations where the speaker had everything timed just right so they didn't have to stand at the computer the whole time.  I am trying to make a video that can continuously play while people are being seated in the church at our wedding.

20090222124033AAlfQrm	Computers & Internet;Internet;MySpace	Should I report a fake MySpace?	I'm really not that into MySpace or meeting people online, but I did meet someone on Yahoo chat who I was cool with for a while. Eventually I learned their pictures were fake, and when I look at their MySpace the fake pics are all over. They have been recently ignoring me when I try to talk to them about it.      I'm contemplating reporting her account, but I don't know if that would b harsh because she has a lot of friends on there, but probably most of them think she's somebody she's not. She's been ignoring me so I don't know if I should do it to teach her a lesson. So I either:      - Report the MySpace and she loses all of her friends on their etc.   - OR I let it be, and most likely she'll just keep ignoring me      I'm really pushing towards reporting it, but if she's that desperate to fake pictures, her MySpace may be one of the only things she has, even though its wrong as hell.      So what do you guys think?

20090222120428AAkGuvc	Computers & Internet;Software	How do I download google desktop with Windows Vista? (Not compatible with 64-bit version)?	I recently tried to download and install Google Desktop on my Dell Studio which runs on Windows Vista 64-bit version. Unfortunately, Google Desktop only runs on 32-bit versions.      The website mentioned that it does not run on Windows Vista or XP with a 64-bit version. It explained that if I want to attempt to run it on a 64-bit version to "do so by installing from a command line and using the '/force' flag."        When I did this I received a message from my command prompt window that it is not recognized as an internal or external command.       How do I fix it so that I can install Google Desktop?  I'm not very computer literate, so basic instructions would be extremely appreciated.       Thanks so much in advance!

Design a program that uses the following parallel arrays:   *empId: an array of 7 integers to hold employee identification numbers.

The program should relate the data in each array through the subscripts. For example, the number in element 0 of the hours array should the number of hours worked by the employee whose identificationion number is stored in element 0 of the empId array. THat same employee's pay rate should be stored in element 0 of the payRate array.      The program should display each employee number and ask the user to enter that employee's hours and pay rate. It should then calculate the gross wages for that employee hours times pay rate), which should be stored in the eages array. After the data has been entered for al the employees, the program should display each employee's indentification number and ggross wages.

I've had this desktop pc for about a year and it has been running well using all four cores of the Phenom Quad core CPU. But after some hard power resets during some software installition, it runs much slower and the system monitor software shows only one core in use instead of the four separate graphs for each core of the Quad Phenom. I suspect it may be a BIOS problem. So what do I do? Gateway's site shows not downloads for the latest bios, a Phoenix BIOS, and I don't know how to flash the motherboard anyhow. I have found no way in the BIOS to order it to start using four cores again, nor have I found any help in Vista. Suggestions welcome!

Most people are likely going to pick the usual library, hospital, restaurant or university system so am not considering those (they've been done so many times already).   I was wondering, does anyone have any idea for a project I can do ?   I don't need you to tell me the details or anything, seeing as that would be my job. I just want to know what interesting ideas out there I could do.

It gets to the first colour win98 screen, and then, where it should be giving a DOS screen saying something like 'updated configuration files,  continuing to load windows' at the bottom, it says 'low memory error. Windows does not have enough memory to load. Try modifying himem.sys. Press any key to continue. Pressing the key shuts down the computer. I have enough knowledge to know that the quantity and installation of the RAM is not the problem. Is there any solution? (its Compaq Presario, quite new, maybe the DDR2 RAM won't work with win98?) Thanks.

20090222121650AAysdGE	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	Java Programming HELP PLEASE!!!?	In a telemetry system in a spacecraft each bit position within the first eight bits of an integer sent to ground control have meaning with regard to the status of certain switches onboard the spacecraft. Assume a 1 indicates the switch is on and a 0 indicates that it’s off. The numbers sent to ground control never exceeds 255 (first eight bits all set to 1). Notice the scheme of bitwise AND-ing a mask value of 32 (25, since the third bit position from the left has a positional value of 25) yields a value in the third bit position exactly equal to the third bit position of the original number. All other bit positions are guaranteed to be 0’s. Thus, this result of bitwise AND-ing can be tested to see if its entire value is 0. If it’s greater than 0, this means that the bit in the tested position was a 1.    Write a program that will input the following data file, Switches.in, containing decimal numbers that represents successive switch information telemetry. Print the status of all eight switches.        Switches.in        22      194      203        97       OUTPUT WILL LOOK LIKE THIS:    Switch status for data value 22:      Switch sw56 is "off"      Switch sw57 is "on"      Switch sw58 is "on"      Switch sw59 is "off"      Switch sw60 is "on"      Switch sw61 is "off"      Switch sw62 is "off"      Switch sw63 is "off"        Switch status for data value 194:      Switch sw56 is "off"      Switch sw57 is "on"      Switch sw58 is "off"      Switch sw59 is "off"      Switch sw60 is "off"      Switch sw61 is "off"      Switch sw62 is "on"      Switch sw63 is "on"        Switch status for data value 203:      Switch sw56 is "on"      Switch sw57 is "on"      Switch sw58 is "off"      Switch sw59 is "on"      Switch sw60 is "off"      Switch sw61 is "off"      Switch sw62 is "on"      Switch sw63 is "on"        Switch status for data value 97:     Switch sw56 is "on"     Switch sw57 is "off"      Switch sw58 is "off"      Switch sw59 is "off"      Switch sw60 is "off"      Switch sw61 is "on"      Switch sw62 is "on"      Switch sw63 is "off"       This is due Tuesday, please HELP!!

20090222123601AAmDKZV	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	Why does json_decode return NULL?	I am using the Joost API (www.joost.com/doc/api) and trying to get the JSON it returns into my PHP script. This should be simple using cURL to get the API result and then using the PHP function, json_decode, to turn it all into an associative array. However, when I do that, json_decode just returns NULL.      The exact API I'm calling is  http://www.joost.com/api/recent/videos?c...       The interesting thing is that when I call it in my script and then echo the result, then copy that output into a string and json_decode that, it works fine. It's just the direct cURL result that won't json_decode properly.      I think it might be because of special characters. When I access that API directly via my browser, it gives a dialog because the webserver returns Content-type: application/json. I save the result and then open it in Notepad, and it has some special characters that can't get rendered in Notepad - they just show up as those little squares. I think they're the newline characters, but I don't know how to get rid of them.      If this is the problem, how do I get around it? If not, what am I doing wrong? Any advice?       Thanks in advance!

20090222140101AA5v9dE	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Desktops	How do I reinstall deleted USB Controllers?	My computer was not recognizing plug-and-play USB devices so I tried to fix it.      First I ran a Widows update to make sure my computer was up-to-date. It said it was.      Then I did the "show all hidden devices" and deleted all the entries in the USB section of the device manager. I recognized entries for many devices I'd tried to plug-and-play that hadn't been recognized.      However, when I rebooted and the Found New Hardware  Wizard came up asking for the USB controllers, I put in the OEM CD that I thought came with my computer and... it was the wrong one. I am traveling and took the OEM CD for my other computer... I won't be able to get the correct CD for another three weeks.      I tried to do system restore, but was unable to.      Please tell me if it is possible to find the USB controllers elsewhere, or if there is another way to solve this problem.      My computer is a Custom Built that runs XP      Thanks!   :   : . . .

I have a problem when playing music on my computer, which has only appeared since I downloaded Kaspersky Internet Security 2009.   When I playback music there is an intermittent “click” rather like the stylus jumping on an old vinyl record. This occurs whether I use “Dell Media Experience” or “Windows Media Player 11” so is unlikely to be a fault in either of these programmes. The fault occurs not only when playing music in my “library”, but also when I play a CD.      Has anyone got any suggestions, please?

20090222142559AAQpGwe	Computers & Internet;Internet;Facebook	To your point of view, what is the difference between "FaceBook.com" and "FaceNook.com"?	Most people know what FaceBook is.  As for FaceNook, it was shown in the beginning of the movie called "Disaster Movie" released in August 2008.  In that movie, a caveman from prehistoric time meets up with Amy Winehouse, who opened up her MacBook.  She looked at her profile, which was on "FaceNook" even though Amy says "FaceBook".        Take a look at the photo album near the bottom of that page by clicking on this link and then scrolling down to near the bottom.  One of the pictures will show the "FaceNook" profile screen on Amy's MacBook.         http://209.85.173.132/search?q=cache:f7a...       After looking at the photo album, simply type "FaceBook.com" and "FaceNook.com" in the address box on your internet browser to see the difference between these two websites.        Thank You

On the control panel it is up. Why am I not hearing it? Do I need speakers or are they built in? Near the two ports at the front I see two holes- one pink and the other green. I figured they are for the headphone; and when I used them, I got no volume. Would someone please help me find the audio on my computer? I got it in 2007 and thought I was getting a good deal. I have speakers from the previous computer if I need them; and I have headphones too. I need to know where to put them. Honestly, I do not know where the manual is and probably would not understand it anyhow.Please help.

20090222132913AAN2hOr	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Desktops	Computer always boots from CD-Rom?	Hello, I'm 13 and doing my first build... here are my specs before i start      Mobo = GA-EP43-DS3l   Processor = Intel Dual-Core   Video Card = GeForce 9400 GT      Here is my problem, my computer always tries to boot from the CD-Rom no matter what, In the BIOS i have even disabled my CD-ROM from the boot order, but yet it still tries... If i unplug the IDE cable from the cd-rom and just leave it in the hard drive, it boots up fine, but then i don't have a cd-rom.... Another thing that annoys me, is that it wont boot up on a CD, it will just freeze... I have tried this on multiple bootable disks...      I know the CD-ROM isn't bad, becuase i hooked it into my dads computer, and it works fine....  They are on the same IDE cable... (because the stupid mobo only has one IDE plug in), and both their jumpers are set to master, could this possible be the problem??

20090222125824AAgMmBP	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Desktops	How do I get my computer out of safe mode?	I have a emachines PC (P.O.S.) with Windows XP, its a couple years old. Recently my computer won't allow me to add or delete programs or even update my iPod or download my digital camera pics. I don't know why it would be in safe mode, I recently tried plugging in my Flip video camera and it won't show my videos on the computer and says that I have an incomplete or corrupt download of the Flip software when I try to run the port it's plugged into. I can't delete Flip's files and start over though cuz it doesn't appear on the control panel add/remove programs list. So either I'm in safe mode and don't know how to get out or somehow my Windows Installer is f-d up. How do I diagnose what's wrong/get out of safe mode? Is it possible for a virus to create this problem?

Completely silent.      Thoughts?      If it is a DOA Mobo or Power Supply, how do I know which and what are the next steps?
