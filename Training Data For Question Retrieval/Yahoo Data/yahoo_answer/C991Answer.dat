She makes skating look really awkward.   I don't get why she turns her board around to ollie. In the video, after her first ollie, she turn her body and flips the board around too.  It wouldn't hurt to get a skating helmet rather than wearing a bike helmet. Skate helmets tend to last longer than one fall. Bike helmets break after one fall.   I suggest that she tightens her trucks.   There's really nothing else that i can suggest because she doesnt do much. All i know is that she can do some ollies and she knows how to stand on a board.  She should keep practicing (if she wants to continue skating) and get better.

Fact is, despite what some may have to 'offer', AC Milan are one of THE biggest sides in Europe.  They have accepted an invitation from Rangers FC to play a friendly match at Ibrox stadium, the finest in Scotland.  No-one is forcing anyone to go to the match.  Plenty will, to catch a glimpse of Kaka, Beckham, Ronaldinho, et al.  I am touched at rival fans being concerned about Rangers' fans finances, this is tempered by the fact that it is a comment created as a result of jealousy.

AA11524511	sounds like its definitely not a bad sign. you probably have a high lung capacity. when you struggle with breathing that is when your heart rate increases, so you don't have that problem. when i was younger i ran several miles a day and would check my heart rate afterward and it returned to normal pretty quickly too. it also depends on how fast and how much effort you put into running. if its a light jog then you're really not using that much energy.|`|65e0c93e39fac0974cefe1be5c93b58daa	That's a sign that you're in shape!  When training, I like to check my heartrate immediately at the end (which is usually very fast for me, 185-190 if I kick it it), then check at 2 mins and 5 mins after the run is over.  If it is recovering quick, that means you're in good shape and your heart is working very efficiently!    Your run is still effective.  Your heartrate increases to speed up the flow of oxygen and fuel to your muscles.  It slows down quickly because when you stop running, your fit, strong heart pumps the muscles what they need very quickly!|`|rYQrwD5Raa	One of the measures of fitness is how quickly your heart rate returns to normal in the first minute or two.  If that is happening to you, then you are fit and it's probably time to increase your endurance sessions.  Here is some data that may help:  http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.j...

39fxsuGaaa	I think by re-signing Perez, the Mets might now have the best rotation in baseball.  But, pitching is so flaky that it's impossible to predict anything but how the pitching looks on paper.  If the Mets number 5 starter is Freddy Garcia, they're in pretty good shape.|`|hS4qvqCwaa	you no people are just going to answer with there favorite team first but on mlb.com the Boston Redsox are first the tampa bay then the yankees then Arizona|`|xhHfXuKFaa	i think the yankees. im not sure though.|`|c6q3EERdaa	Yankees. Signing CC and Burnett added two good pitchers, and the Yanks will have many options for the other 3 starters.|`|4TgxrCX4aa	I think you have to put the Cubs rotation in first:  -The 3 returning starters with the team all of last season (Zambrano, Dempster, and Lilly) went a combined 48 - 21  -A healthy Rich Harden is one of the most dominant pitchers in the MLB, he went 5-1 with a 1.77 ERA after joining the Cubs last year, he may not reach 30 starts, but even 20 at that pace is better than a full season of other mid-rotation starters  -Zambrano should have a better 2009 than 2008 because he took time off due to back problems which costed him wins  -Lilly has not had less than 15 wins over the past 3 seasons and has improved his record each of those years  -The Cubs have options for the fifth spot including young pitchers Marshall (3.86 ERA last year) and Samardzija (2.28 ERA last year) and veterans Gaudin and Heilman, at least one of these players will have a solid season  -The possible, but not probably acquisition of Peavy would make this rotation even better    While other rotations have a better ace or better top half of the rotation, I don't believe any have the depth that the Cubs have. There are 4 pitchers in the Cubs rotation who could be number 1 starters for many other teams (Zambrano, Lilly-17 wins, Dempster-17 wins, Harden-when healthy), I think that puts them ahead of any other rotation in baseball.|`|gvWLgYx4aa	you're all going to call me stupid right now, but I am telling you 100% the Marlins are going to have if not the best, then atleast top 3 starting rotation in '09.|`|Mxzz2my7aa	yanks all the way cc, aj, wang, pettite and joba when he becomes a starter again|`|AYiVipawaa	Red Sox. I don't know why everyone says yankees. Other than Burnett, Sebathia, and Wang, they're bum. Burnett's most likely going to get injured, and their bullpen's bum.    Red Sox have ALL good pitchers: Beckett, Matsuzaka, Penny, Lester, Wakefield (he's be replaced by Smoltz when he returns).    And, their bullpen has 4 setup guys. What they could do, is trade one or two, and get more offense which they might need if Ortiz doesn't recover.|`|36QnocaOaa	I think it's a toss up between the Sox and Yankees, with the Yankees a little bit ahead. But I have a feeling that the injury bug might hit them, as it usually happens with their big free agent pitchers.|`|2k5Sqvm2aa	The Giants, 3 CY Young winners|`|yJ8DqPA0aa	Yanks Braves Giants then Redsox.|`|iz5zDFxvaa	Last season, the Jays, Cubs, Brewers, Dodgers and D-backs had the better ERAs in all the MLB. Due to some players leaving those teams to go to a new team, that's likely to change unless those clubs can find replacements for those players that are gone. Let's take a look at who left those teams:    Jays: Burnett, the Jays  2 starter, has signed with the Yankees. Also the Jays will be without their  3 starter for the whole season in Shawn Marcum. The Jays have yet to replace those guys and that's going to be 27 wins lost.    Cubs: They traded their  4 starter Jason Marquis to the Rockies for relief pitcher Luis Vizcaino! That's 11 wins that they're losing. There are rumors about the Cubs looking to trade for Jake Peavy, but nothing has been done yet. The Cubs also re-signed their  2 starter Ryan Dempster, who will join a rotation including Zambrano, Lilly and Harden.    Brewers: They lost their  1 starter CC Sabathia this offseason to the Yankees. On top of that, they appear to not be interested in bringing back their  2 starter in Ben Sheets. That's 30 wins that they need to replace.    Dodgers: They lost Penny (to Red Sox) and Lowe (to the Braves), two big-time pitchers to their rotation. At this point, it appears that they are going to go into the season with a rotation of Billingsley, Kuroda, Kershaw and possibly Schmidt. Someone is going to have to makeup for the 20 wins lost.    D-back: They lost the 46 yr old Big Unit who won 9 games with the D-backs, but have replaced him by signing 14 game winner and 29 yr old Jon Garland who will join a rotation of Webb, Haren, Davis and possibly Scherzer. That rotation looks like a force to be reckoned with.    At this point unless:  Sabathia and Burnett pan out well for the Yankees  David Price lives up to his potential for the Rays  The Cubs acquire Jake Peavy  Most of the teams who lost key players this offseason can replace the players they lost with someone equivalent to them.    it looks like the D-backs will have the better rotation in all of baseball this coming season.|`|nSSKixvCaa	LOL. I said Mets MIGHT be the best in NL now you put them up there as the best in MLB.     The truth is, average AL rotations are still better than NL rotations period even though many talents has moved to NL now.     Take Yankees vs Mets for example,  CC=Santana (the reason is CC's fastball is still overpowering and Santana's stuff has been declining).  Wang > Pelfre (lazy to argue this)  AJ>Maine (Maine won 18 games yet?)  Pettitte>Perez (I still think Pettitte is more consistent)  Joba> Tim Redding/Freddy Garcia    Ok, Yankees wins like 5 hands down if I have that many hands. Ok, I am lazy to list all others but Mets and Cubs are the only NL teams can actually put up a front four that are above average pitchers. In AL, Yankees, RedSox, Rays, WhiteSox, Twins, Angels can all put up four guys that are able to have winning records. In post season, four man or three rotations does not matter that much but in regular season four-man rotation is essential. I will rate Yankees and Redsox rotation over Cubs and Mets so the ranking will look like:    Yankees  RedSox  Cubs (I said Mets MIGHT be the best, but I still think Cubs is better because of Ted Lilly)  Mets  WhiteSox  Rays  Twins  Angels   Indians  Giants  Phillies  Braves  D-backs  Marlins (Well, no proven ace but they can be really good)  Dodgers (Billingsley is out in first half?)  lazy to list the rest of suckers now..|`|ak5A435maa	i think its the Mets than Yankees than Red Sox than Cubs then Giants  then D backs|`|1OeNP92yaa	the yankees by far have the best pitching rotations skill wise. if they stay healthy and pitch to there ability they will have one of the best rotations in history. this is what i think they're rotation will look like: first of all they're ace C.C Sabathia one of the best starters in baseball next A.J Burnett one of they're best aquisations this off-season who they stole from the braves next Cheing Ming Wang a solid righty next Andy Petite a solid pitcher the yanks have been able to rely on followed by one of the best young pitchers in the league Joba Chamberland. Even though i hate the Yanks they have had by far the best off-season out of any team in the MLB.      DON'T COUNT OUT THE ATLANTA BRAVES. They have added solid ptching this off-season. They have added Derek Lowe, Kenshin Kawakami (former japenese league mvp pitcher), and veteran Javier Vazquez. Look out the braves will have a solid starting rotation. This is my prediction: ace Derek Lowe, followed by Tim Hudson when healthy, next Jair Jurjens a guy who had to step it up when Smoltz and Hudson got hurt last year, next Javier Vazquez, then Kenshin Kawakami who will have to prove himself. The Braves sub while Hudson's out i'm going to go with young talent Jo-Jo Reyes who they desprately need to step up. GO BRAVES!!!!

That will cost a premium but it does enhance the value if you keep the letter with the gun.

If the gun is in very good shape, you're already going to have a "keeper" that is worth some money.    Hope it turns out well for you

zMvGnlMraa	I think most of the coaches in high school are teachers  so if you become a teacher you can coach high school and work your way up.  I think college coaches are either really good high school coaches who worked there way up or former players who did not make the majors.  Same goes for many minor league and even major league coaches.  Many were players that never made it to the majors or were never really good major league players.  I think your best bet is to play as much baseball as possible as there are only so many things you can learn from watching and studying.  Managers who have played the game extensively seem to have a special knowledge of its inner workings and are more successful.  You don't have to be a great player but you have to play.|`|ak5A435maa	maybe if your a good manager in college or high school you'll become a MLB manager
AA12325046	Good question sir.    Naseem was very fast with outstanding power.  Kid Chocolate is a legendary fighter who would have the better technical skills and enough power to make Naseem respect him.  Naseem by split decision.    Chavez is a very hard punching fighter going against the defensive and boxing wizard Leonard who was as tough as nails too.  Somehow I believe that Chavez wins this fight by technical knockout in 12 rounds.    Monzon is a legendary fighter with long arms, a great jab, iron chin and good power against the Executioner Hopkins who also has an iron chin and good boxing skills.  Monzon would have won the decision here.    Patterson at 170 lbs would be Patterson early in his career before moving up in weight.  Calzaghe like Patterson has very fast hands.  The difference is power and Patterson has more of it and lands the harder punching power here.  Patterson by unanimous decision.    Louis at his very best would have destryed Klitschko because of his superior boxing skills and power.  Remember Louis had no problems with Baer (both brothers) Carnera and bigger fighters.  His jab was very powerful and accurate.  Klitschko who is strong with a good jab would have held on until caught flush with a two handed combo in the 9th round.    Lewis vs Marciano looks like a big disadvantage for Marciano size wise but Marciano was arguably the toughest man ever to step in a ring and had a way of getting inside and throwing devastating punches.  Marciano by late rounds stoppage despite taking some hard punches.    Harry Greb was good enough to beat Gene Tunney and lost a controversial decision to him the 2nd fight and battered Dempsey during training sessions.  Very fast and very mean, not to mention tough as nails.  Papp was a great amateur and never had any big name fights as a pro other than a decision over Ralph "Tiger" Jones.  There was talk of a title fight with Giardello but because of his countries socialist beliefs was not allowed to fight for a title.  A shame indeed.  As good as Papp was, he could not beat Greb.  Greb by decision.    Hearns vs Papp would have made for a good fight in my opinion.  Hearns has tremendous power but does not have the strongest chin in the world or the legs.  Papp would have been able to work on the inside and knocked Hearns out in the 11th round of a good fight.|`|ElH6jMEXaa	1.

Patterson - if he could get down to that weight he would have way too much power for Calzaghe to handle, he was aggressive with fast enough hands to catch Joe  5.

XLXncQu9aa	That article you read was talking about how NBC has allowed Matt Millen to comment on games, and be a co-anchor along with other anchors during this year's playoffs and super bowl.  However, even though he was an anchor with NBC sports, he still has the stigma of the terrible job he did as GM over the Lions.  I think the overall feeling is that Matt Millen will not and has not yet been forgiven of his poor job as GM over the Lions franchise.  Even though he was fired and he has moved on, the damage has been done by him, and some Lions fans cringe at the thought of Millen being an anchor on NBC.|`|f7qVtYfaaa	he totally mishandled and nfl franchise|`|fb6e01bd10dce5212a34b8e493ff20a8aa	He was president of the Detroit Lions for 8 terrible years and this season the Lions were 0-16, the first team to lose all 16 games of their schedule in NFL history, making the 2008 Lions the worst team of all time.

6a3172c489600c432a5b3ecd4bc4bb96aa	Check out both schools.    Honestly for true self defense it is more about mind set and training principles then styles.    If the Krav Maga place in Tulsa does solid realistic sparring, and the instructor has an impressive background, then go for it.    Same goes with BJJ.    Honestly, as far as Self Defense I think you can find a school in either style that will give you all that you need. There is plenty of BJJ schools training more for self defense than Sports.    Self defense is really more about having a good head on your shoulders and keeping your cool then any particular Martial Arts technique.    I think both arts have an enormous amount of wealth of information to them.    BJJ: Strengths: Obviously great at close quarters, takes people out of their element, teaches you true functional applicable techniques in a short amount of time that work. In 6 months you can deal with the majority of unarmed, untrained punks.    Weaknesses: Not a ton of schools, usually expensive, hard to find schools with solely self defense in mind, as opposed towards being geared for MMA, or BJJ competetions. Striking and striking defenses are limited depending on school, there is a lot of variance from one school to the next in closing the distance, using and defending strikes.    Krav Maga:  Strengths: Teaches you solid intuitive techniques. There is no complicate forms or patterns or techniques to learn. They have some of the most practical weapons disarms out there. A good Krav School will truly put you under pressure and let you see the realities of armed and multiple attacker scenarios and can teach you to survive.    Cons: General weakness towards real techniques. Krav is awesome if you have a background in something solid already. They don't spend a lot of time refining punch mechanics, or teaching you to hit or kick harder. A lot of it is meant to go off of reaction, to essentially overwhelm a would be attacker using the element of surprise. In a straight up fight, it wouldn't suit you well. Krav Maga isn't for sport, challenge matches, or for taking on skilled fighters. Also it is incredibly hard to find a really good schools. Many of the schools are nothing more than cardio kickboxing with eye gouges. If the school doesn't spar, they are teaching a watered down form of Krav. For disarms, and resistance drills, people should be padded up and going full force. Guy with fake knife is really trying to stab you, not perform a slow, pre arranged stab for you to defend and go through a combination against.      Just my take on it, I have done (and do) both.|`|zLUQJxJkaa	Whichever one you work harder at.|`|3NQR75zraa	just do a normal martial arts eg tae kwon do owns people :D|`|kH4LeoAAaa	I'd say krav maga. But Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is also nice.|`|WAO7RuCwaa	Brazilian Jujitsu was developed as a sport, not by prisoners, but by students of judo, and is basically a form of submission wrestling, and although it is great on the mat or in the ring, it is not really cut out for the streets. Krav Maga, on the other hand, is a system designed for self-defense in a no-rules, life or death situation. I would say that Krav Maga is a better self defense system, however there is nothing wrong with BJJ as a martial art.|`|V20PTwMmaa	Krav MagAaa|`|fb6e01bd10dce5212a34b8e493ff20a8aa	BJJ was developed in Brazilian prison cells by inmates who were trying to rape or struggling to avoid it.    Krav Maga was first used by Israeli soldiers who did not want to waste a bullet killing Palestinian children.  It also came in handy when they stomped on baby's heads during the Gaza invasion (see link).    I guess if you like rolling around the ground with guys in the missionary position, BJJ is for you.  However, if killing with your bare hands and feet gets you off, then go with the Krav Maga.|`|Qn6ERwZcaa	I'd say Krav because it's a no none sense, kick your butt in an instant type of art.  with bjj, yo uhave to consider positioning, leverage, etc.  I like them both, and respect them both as an art, but I'd go with Krav|`|Vrd8gB61aa	self defense go with traditional tae kwon do if u can find one. Or a form of karate.(NOT SPORT)  Because having the self defense training also develops into good offense, common sense.     But if u want to choose b/t those two I would say Krav Maga  because BJJ you will be on the ground.  1. Most likely a fightor w/e u wanna call it will start standing up so there is a disadvantage there.  2. Do you want to roll around on concrete or asphault.
afe603ba3e194df09373aa3fe7e6e4a8aa	For your price range and what you want in a gun (no problems, less mechanical, and cheap) try to find an older single shot 12 gauge shotgun with as short of a barrel as possible. While not the best choice for home protection, it certainly is better than nothing, and as cheap as you can reliably go.   It would be hard to recommend anything else in that low of a price range that would be less mechanical. Here in Ohio you could pick up a new Hi Point semi auto pistol for around $150, but you want something less mechanical so that's out of the picture.   You could also look for cheaper models in pump action shotguns like the one below.  http://www.auctionarms.com/search/displa...|`|QrjuueMCaa	Shotgun is a great choice.

And .....  http://personalsecurityzone.com/Shotgun_...|`|WBGnXsr7aa	a Remington 870 with  4 shot is what your situation calls for|`|Z8UV6S3baa	Given what you are describing, you definately should get some firearms training and then, as has been suggested, opt for an inexpensive defensive shotgun. Pump is probably the cheapest and their are many which are quite good. 20 guage indeed is plenty, in fact .410 is plenty for in home distances typically.     If you aren't going to practice, you don't want a pistol of any sort because basic technique is quite important to hitting a target even at close range, which can be challenging under stress. A shotgun is much more tolerant.     Now, a pistol caliber carbine - like the Hi - Point, may not be a bad choice as well. I have no experience with the Hi Point firearms, so that isn't a recommendation, just citing an example. Now, off hand I don't know what they cost, but Kel-tec makes a 40 caliber carbine which runs off of Glock magazines which is pretty nice.  Generally their stuff is not too expensive. The advantage of a pistol caliber carbine is virtually the same ease of handling as a shotgun, but more precision in ability to place shots. It does require somewhat more skill to use though.    Good luck,    Thinkingblade|`|xvy9xWvGaa	Shotgun or a Glock Handgun (9mm Hollow Points).  Remember if the area is bad, you may not want to leave a gun laying around to be stolen when you are not there.  Handgun and a concealed permit may help, that way you can keep it with you almost all the time.|`|dda37e592e7a473ae883df834ad9805faa	In your situation I'd purchase a Remington 870 Express for about $325.  You can get cheaper shotguns for the purpose but I wouldn't want to bet my life on one.  If that is too much cash, look for a used 870.  Have someone who is knowledgeable of firearms look it over before buying.    I would recommend nothing larger than  4 buckshot. It's fairly small, 28 pellets in a 2 3/4" 12 gauge.  Stay away from  00 buck if penetration is an issue.    I would also make sure that the barrel is trimmed close to the legal limit.  Long barrels indoors can be problem.    If you go with a handgun, look at Glaser Safety slugs ore Mag Safe for ammo.  It's pre fragmented and normally doesn't over penetrate and is effective for self defense.    Mostly get some training.  Understand the laws in your state, and understand that shooting at another human being is nothing like shooting at a paper target at the range.    Good Luck.|`|0ZnX6Qjyaa	don't skimp on prices get a good gun I recommend a Micro Eagle      it costs 535 dollars, but with it comes reliability|`|kQSSz2X2aa	First thing I would recommend is that you take your gun out regularly and practice with it. A gun is only as good as you make it, and if you don't practice and keep your skills up, having it won't help you much.     As for a choice of gun, you need to make sure that the gun is a good "fit". It's like buying shoes or clothes, they need to fit you. Also, what "fits" me might not work for you. To get a good idea of what will work for you, you will need to go to a gun shop and try out as many different guns as possible. There are some ranges that rent guns. This is a great way to make sure you buy a gun you like without making a big investment. Try it out for a half hour and see how it feels. You should be able to reach all of the controls easily, you should be able to get a second shot off quickly and accurately (if you can't you need to step down a caliber or two), and you should be able to grip it comfortably.    For a shotgun a  12 gauge, 20 gauge, or even .410 will work quite well. For a handgun you will need something larger than a .22 but no larger than a .45. The most common calibers for self defense are 9mm, .40, .45, .38 spec, and .357. You want something that is comfortable for you to use. Be wary of people who declare that one caliber is "the best". Saying this is similar to saying that there is a "best shoe size to wear". It's different for everybody.    As for the expense part, buying a used firearm is your best bet.    Also, consider getting your ccw permit so you can protect yourself on the way home, at the store, in the car, etc, not just at home.|`|2TB8p5fvaa	Get a used Glock 17.

But, you can generally use anything you want that is available. Consider a few things, you're going to want to be proficient in using it so you are going to want to get range time in and hone your skills. With that in mind you will want cheap ammo, which rules out certain calibers. I am using an AK-47 type rifle for home protection. Wall penetration was also a concern but I purchased Glaser rounds just for this very specific use. Glaser rounds are available in almost every caliber, they are not cheap around 20 dollars for 5 rounds. But you only need them for if you need to defend your home and don't want to kill the neighbors in the process. Glaser rounds will NOT penetrate a standard house wall. They are made out of a polymer that is very thin and inside are small shot balls. They will incapacitate an intruder, so they are still lethal, and they retain they're accuracy.    Another thing to consider, your ammo choice can mean the difference between a DA prosecuting you for murder/manslaughter or you being cleared on grounds of Self-Defense if you have to use your firearm. THe benefit of Glaser rounds comes into play here as they are SPECIFICALLY designed for home defense and are considered less lethal than standard hunting ammo. In the end it will cover your butt.|`|9wfmpBMWaa	I would go with the pump or single shot shoot gun.  The Pump maybe a better bet because it has more shell capacity and the sound of someone raking in a shell on a pump will scare most people off.|`|z7f6uYR2aa	Im not going to give you a specific gun, but when/if you do buy it, make it a pistol, because a pistol will look alot less terrifying in court, and if you are getting sued, the last thing u want is to look terrifying. Or atleast get a shot gun with equal or lesser power than the authorities, because something that is more powerful will also be very terrifying. The jury tends to judge you on your looks when it comes to this. IF you have a collapsible stock pistol grip shot gun with a laser or some stuff, you're going to be critisized etc......i have a strong feeling im going to get alotta thumbs downs.     *~~~its better to be judged by 12 than carried by six~~~*|`|AA12243350	first off, you can't say "cheap" and depend on it to save your life. You mean as "inexpensive" as possible. So, bottom line, low priced as possible yet will work: a single shot 12 or 20 gauge shotgun from NEF or similar with an 18 1/2 " barrel.  New price around $125-150 used at a pawn shop, I just bought 4 of then for $50.00 each.  Place a nylon shell holder ($5.00)on the butt stock to hole extra shells. Place 1  7 bird shot, 2 4 buckshot 1 00 buckshot and one slug in the holder. This gives you the ability to handle any situation that may arrive. Leave the shotgun chamber empty, place it on a rack next to your bed at night or when you are home, and lock it away when you are leaving.  Next, don't just fire it once. Shoot it once a month or so to stay proficient. Next, take a firearms safety course that covers the liability fo using a firearm, as well as how to handle it safely. These are my "minimum" suggestions.  shoot safe|`|FOjYdZMeaa	After looking over your list little man, I would have to say the what you require is not a firearm at all, but perhaps a slingshot.

5iFsy1Dlaa	well to tell you the truth melina is a good wrestler and i respect her but i want jillian hall to be champion cause she has been in wwe the longest and has not had any title shots thats pathetic cause she is a hell of an athlete and can put on classic matches with the best in wwe. i forgot to mention she can do the 450 splash and is a cool person in real life. melina is good but i think jillian hall can be better if they give her the push that she deserves plus it would be fresh to have a new womens champion. my second choice would be to give natalya the championship cause she is a great technical wrestler and i dont see other divas being able to handle that intense training at the dungeon. natalya could be the most dominant woman in wwe but mostly what wwe cares for is looks but it would be more exciting to have either of the divas you mentioned champion.|`|NuavkWfIaa	yes i do, i love her|`|ansW6fnLaa	i think that he whole good diva mantches vs the bad is getting old i mean i liked her as champ but i think  that sanitina should be chamion she really deserves i mean she beat beth and its very hard to do that so SANTINA will be wwe womans or divas champion haha lol|`|ffjIdZ7Zaa	gail kim|`|63P7Q4hoaa	i do love her but i think i would like to see it more on a psycho heel which would be mickie or gail kim or natalya.... because she just totally lost the attitude when she turned face, she's now a bit getting lukewarm|`|1TDCaKVgaa	She's a good womens champion,but I think Santina would be a better champion|`|KGu4QOoVaa	melina is a good wrestler but gail kim wouldn't be bad|`|dOFVXmV2aa	I Prefer Beth phoenix|`|p6GGoFDsaa	I'm a huge fan of Melina. I think she makes an excellent champion, and I was wanting her to win the title for so long before she actually did. Thrilled she's having her run as a face as well, kinda sick of the heel thing.    I'd like to see Melina continue this title run for a little longer. Maybe in a couple of months or a little longer one of those listed could get the title. I really doubt it'd be Jillian though due to her lack of popularity. I'm a fan of her... but since WWE don't think she's worthy of having a real match, the chances of her becoming champion are rather slim.    Natalya Neidhart should get a few title reigns while she's in the WWE, but to be women's champion she'll probably have to be drafted to Raw first. Gail Kim will also have a title run in time, however not just yet as she's only just returned.    I can see Melina being involved in a feud with Katie Lea at some point and maybe Katie will come out on top as the new women's champion. Who knows though.|`|Xkm4PstOaa	Yeah, Melina is a good champ.  I would like her to defend her title a little more, and to someone else other than Beth Phoenix.  She's improved so much in the ring.  It's really a pleasure to watch her grow as an athlete.    But I would for Katie, Jillian, Gayle, or Natalya to hold the belt sometime soon.  All these woman would be worthy champions!|`|Yaxdy8U2aa	she is ok...i like her as a wrestler too...but i think wwe should give katie lea a chance...she is a very good wrestler they just wont give her a chance to show everyone....btw i like melina better as a heel :)|`|pO0rfIv0aa	yes|`|41WXZPnCaa	Really NO Beth Or Natalya Should Be    Melina Is A Kidna Good Wrestler But Not As The Level Of Those Chiks|`|H3nbC71eaa	Yes I do like Melina as WWE Woman's champ. She is a great in ring talent and deserves it. But the focus hasn't really been on her as champ but rather the Miss Wrestlemania thing and Santina, which is ridiculous.  I see why you would prefer someone else, especially the ones you mentioned since they haven't been Woman's champ in the WWE and it would be a change. I would also like Natalya as champ, they should let her wrestle more and give her more of a push. I also would like to see Katie Lea as Women's champ, another one they need to let wrestle. I would also like to see Gail Kim as Diva's champ.|`|IzgJpVgBaa	ok she can do the splits but she is boring id like mickie james or candice or jilian 2 be wc|`|EAZv468Xaa	I like her as champ.|`|0xGm3lrxaa	Dude, I'd rather Melina be champ than Jillian Hall. But, yeah a new women's champion wouldn't hurt.|`|dbc3503ab379d3f8b3803c2488ab5e36aa	I would prefer Layla as woman's champion and Gail Kim as Diva's Champion|`|X9xWZdgSaa	She is a great wrestler with allot of skill she definitely deserves and I reckon it's awesome having her be leader of diva's on RAW|`|Zgdf76apaa	Yea she is more face then she was the frist time.|`|XRw2ux9waa	I love Melina as champ. Even though the Woman's Division is on the rocks, at least WWE is giving the title to a deserving diva, and not Smelly Kelly.    Melina may not be the greatest wrestler in the divas division, but she's definitely one of the best. Although I wish she would be heel. She's kind of boring as a face.     Natalya, Katie Lea, and Jillian Hall would be great if they got a push they deserved. And it's disappointing how WWE has the talent right in front of them, it's right there and they can make really good feuds but they just refuse to do it.|`|owIeFDbWaa	i like her as champ but i like Mickie James more!
63e6fbd5b85357a27d660c7d5c0b9ee9aa	nope because that ticket still could be sold  and then you would have to move    i went to a bulls game with family and peopel was sitting in our seats.. they said they had tickets to those seats  but we showed an usher our tickets and then asked to see theirs  and they had to move one section over..|`|xDDNCKvlaa	No because they check your tickets at all the entrances and gates when you come in.|`|fzVc9tOCaa	Well you could but the problem is that people sometimes buy tickets late, or sometimes they forget to update the system, it depends but the bottom line is not to risk it because a while back we were at a baseball game and me and my friend started looking around for empty seats, when we saw no one there well, we went down and sat there. Half way through the game a security guard asked us if we had tickets for the seats and we said that we did, and the guy asked us why the guy over there says that we stole his seats? we got kicked out of the game, it sucked!

a6a555da6f939b85469e3c83f71c0ecaaa	Yes, he copied MJ's number, tosses powder like KG, so why change.|`|Ga11Abmzaa	No, he just has to win and he is putting up numbers like Kobe.|`|20c39869681c620456bd83d3a9c63a23aa	No. LeBron thinks of his team "FIRST".|`|PA7ryYR8aa	LeBron will try to get 61+ but i honestly don't think he will...why? hes just not as good as a shooter as kobe is. Lebron basically only makes dunks and lay-ups...jumpers and 3 point shots you can forget it, if he drive in about 30 times out of 35, he might get there. but if not than no.|`|5b3bc75908f8e6f307db37d7e1944faaaa	not really he wants to have the best team thats all|`|WLXFAeSnaa	No, not really.      LeBron already has more triple-doubles than Kobe has... in their careers.|`|2db7f31f8de2a63df2848a630426eea7aa	What at Madison Square Garden?    Nah, not really.     He has put up numbers of his own.     50 points, 10 assists, 8 rebounds, 4 steals|`|GBGcI509aa	He just wants the win.|`|KdhNCnEjaa	No, Kobe and LeBron are unrelated. LeBron needs to focus on the task at hand and win!|`|0gWxnY0Gaa	Haha their aint no pressure for LeBron!  He rocks!|`|XrCc85kNaa	No...  He needs to get a win and thats it......|`|98wFqBwSaa	No, his numbers have been better than Kobme the ENTIRE season.|`|ZAh8CEoGaa	Kobe needed to score that much points to beat the Knicks with little to say about the nukmbers in the other categories. Like Cavs in 09 said he already posted that kind of numbers there and not just in scoring. LEBron's main focus is to get that  1 seed and to win games and the championship. Though LeBron will score that much if he has to.
0f213e569404219f01d20decc3749462aa	Thats the way I look at it. LeBron's not ever likely to score 61 but he's a more dual threat to get a triple-double more often then Kobe. Hence, Kobe has a superior jump shot, a better foul shooter, 3 point shooter, while LeBron's vision and rebounding allows him to rack up triple doubles easier.|`|98wFqBwSaa	If he had a triple double I would respect him, if he got 0 rebounds, 0 steals, and a measly 3 assists, then I would not.|`|bmL7Ryw2aa	61 at madison Square Garden has never been done in it's history.  So I doubt it.|`|WLXFAeSnaa	Probably not. But if he did top it, I don't think he would mind.|`|GBGcI509aa	Hopefully.|`|oPWXfsa2aa	no doubt.|`|PA7ryYR8aa	Lebron will try, but i honestly don't he'll even get over 50 points.    Why? well Lebrons only shot are "dunks/and lay-ups" if he does to many outside shots, theres just no way he'll get close, but if he can make 20+dunks/lay-ups thean maybe, but when your a player thats only able to make dunks/lay-ups, its pretty pfft.|`|20c39869681c620456bd83d3a9c63a23aa	No. LeBron thinks of his team first. If he gets a triple-double, it will come naturally.|`|AA11827493	Anyone can get a triple double.  Someone shooting 19/31 61% and scoring 61 pts,  with only 3 fingers on his shooting hand, that's hard.|`|KdhNCnEjaa	If Lebron really is a good player, he will push Kobe's 61 out of his head and simply focus on doing what he can to win his team the game.

f9soMMuiaa	Probably not. He's a crucial part of the team and makes a crucial presence in the key. But for the short term, probably not too much difference.|`|q0rDcTSRaa	I think the Celtics are a good team without Kevin Garnett not a great team but good. <br>  <br>  No they cannot reach the NBA Finals without him. The Cavs would beat them without Garnett.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|AA10744471	I think they could still do it, but be hardly able. But with KG in, it is possibly easy sailing. The Celtics need big men to counter the onslaughts of other teams.|`|bda90fe4a3f3926b8f365b8127d043c2aa	Nope they're really lacking good big men and that will make it hard for them contend against Orlando and Cleveland<br>  <br>  Not a great team, but decent enough|`|TbEwkoQDaa	Celtics cannot make it without Garnett because he is a valuable player for that team providing the needed offense and defense to secure a win in every game.|`|fc2LcdvVaa	They are a good team without KG but I dont see them making it into the finals without him. By the way how long is he out for anyway?|`|G9liglrwaa	they are good..but with him they are great|`|rtkY1yhNaa	Of course they can win<br>  Celtic is the best!|`|JD5NQxeNaa	A semi-Finals bound team nothing more than a 2nd round team. Maybe, even ECF team if Pierce and Allen can string together a 2001 season that Pierce and Walker did in these 3 weeks. But, a Finals contending team, no. KG is far too important and he is the equalizer and best player on the team. Not to mention he is the defensive spark.|`|Kwywmcs8aa	12-2 so far
LReOvHEdaa	lmao@turning into spurs aka scums of d earth ;)<br>  <br>  Remember a depleted squad beat Manchester united.<br>  Injuries have really fcuked us.<br>  We have the best midfield when in full strength.strikers ?We dont lack there too.Defenders are doing the job for now.<br>  We need a good CDM.Hopefully we buy in summer.<br>  We know Wenger brings the best out of players.<br>  Don't compare to manchester united man..they really don't have a great midfield.Wait and watch when cr7 leaves this summer.Its waiting time for Manu until the next superhero comes along.<br>  <br>  Wait until the season ends and then judge their performances.|`|xvuAQ0DAaa	Of course he could always spend 50 million money on over-priced players that have no team chemistry.....and Arsenal will be even worse off....can you say Chelsea, Man City or LIverpool? All teams go through a rebuilding phase no matter how good they are.  If we don't win a major trophy this season, then certainly next year.|`|3dPwxPSGaa	Yes im a huge arsenal fan!<br>  <br>  From your question, i see your woried about this team but Wenger has transformed great players. Right now he is in a slump but its not the talent thats bad, its the confidence of the players.

It is the transformation that makes your team no longer a Top 4 side, but a UEFA Cup contenders side. It's happened to Blackburn, Nottingham Forest, Leeds and now it's your turn. Take it on the chin, because this time next season you'll be happy to finish 5th.

I am Liverpool fan !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|xvuAQ0DAaa	Rather Win the CL and finish 3rd or 4th.  Realistically the Premiership title is out of reach and the FA Cup would make a nice little bonus, especially if as you say it stopped Man. Utd making a clean sweep. Although they'll probably have already  lost in the Carling Cup Final to Spurs and may not even get to the Fa Cup Final, they're running into a Fixture pile up.|`|3dPwxPSGaa	hmm tough question, i would love to win the FA cup and so would the lads. But if we got to win the CL i would take that
JD40e1Sdaa	Because he doesn't need one.  The racquet is a fairly solid construction and tends not to vibrate that much.  The hollower racquets, Babolat Pure Drives, Head Radicals, are very vibration prone, the shock travels through the racquet differently.  This is not the case with the k90 , gut/poly hybrid strings and mid range tension.  Even on off center hits the frame does not have a jarring sensation.|`|akUibcJWaa	federer can do whatever he wants because he's awesome!  and i heard that playing without a dampener sometimes can injure or hurt your arm so don't try it.  federer probably has some extreme built in damper in his racquet so he doesn't need one :)|`|oXMT7Uqyaa	neither.some people prefer it, some dont. everyone is different. i for instance use a vibe(vibration) absorber(just a different name[proper] for a 'vibration dampener'). all it does is it reduces the vibration from hitting a tennis ball, which can cause tennis elbow(very rare). for me, it helped me win a national junior tournament 2 weeks ago =]|`|pqExee6Oaa	Neither, it's just to do with vibration and/or preference.  Federer plays with a very low string tension so maybe that has something to do with it.
4284e409c8e26999c7eb4ffd92352976aa	I read that the storyliners are looking at Jeff Hardy vs Christian at WM 25, with Christian being revealed as Jeff's mystery assailant.This sets off a feud between them leading up to a match at WM 25.With Matt Hardy turning heel at the Royal Rumble, he could team up with Christian in the feud with Jeff.|`|Pvg6djVSaa	possibly|`|uEfoR5BLaa	Duh...|`|Z1ruPjmCaa	rumors r going around that its gonna be mett vs jeff v edge vs christion in a tlc match we can only hope|`|RJMrJN3waa	Theres a chance of it happening  but if it does it would probably b extreme rulez    WINNER: MATT HARDY|`|AA11482019	Yes, but not in a TLC match.  They're not going to have two ladder matches at WrestleMania.   It will probably be a regular match that ends in a double count out or double DQ.  They would then  have a rematch 3 weeks later,  in a TLC match at Backlash.|`|tQNF7i7Baa	OF COURSE. this will be a graet match but i think theyll make up after. however Matt works great as a heel.|`|mDuiiVN7aa	It is likely, but I do not believe it will be TLC match, the creative will build up to it in months to come first the brothers will meet in a singles match, with the result leading to more extreme matches.|`|G9LSZQcaaa	I ******* hope so.
OsjT9jszaa	The summer is a long time away so if you just keep doing what you are doing, you are going to be able to run 3.5 miles no problem.  If you spend the next month just running 3 days a week, then the next month 4 days a week, by the time the summer rolls around you can probably run there and back.  The beauty of running is that you can see your own results from work.
UYPfC5YVaa	I would trade Shaq for LeBron or Tim Duncan. Shaq and Dwight are both centers so I would pick the younger and more athletic Howard over the older and becoming-past-his-prime player O'Neal. Duncan as power forward or LeBron as SF.|`|NzyM0lwfaa	Trade for LeBron.........<br>  <br>  Conclusion...No questions asked.|`|u2QhQAxzaa	What are you talking about here.

AA12066574	Bad calls have happened in the past. The game itself is faster now, which makes it a real challenge for those middle-aged officials to see everything that 22 men are doing.|`|3yvuMkzTaa	Yes it has always been this way. The problem now is more people come on sights like this & complain!!!|`|gU4VdD6Oaa	The only thing that changed is that the internet has given widereaching voice to a bunch of cry-baby sore losers.     Also, the review rules have led to even more replays of close calls and the expectation that every call is supposed to be perfect.     I heard Lynn Swan being interviewed the other day and he said that if one of his great, acrobatic Super Bowl Bowl catches of the 70s had been reviewed like today they might have overturned it because he slightly bobbled it before going out of bounds.|`|ScPIXjj9aa	The ref's are gonna make a bad call here and there. But another thing is, when the ref makes a bad call, it the other team spposed to say "Hey, Mr. Ref, you f***ed up that call! We didn't really get a TouchDown!"    lol!!!|`|AA12103453	All that has changed is the Internet. A few years ago people didn't go to sites like this and complain, so no one paid as much attention. People complaining among friends, but since most of their friends agreed with them it died quick. Now though you have a site where people can give the other opinion.|`|192dcf4b1a210a56cc3798f450e74468aa	With instant replay now taking up a large portion of the game, it might be that officials feel less useful to the game prior to all the scrutiny that they've come under.

yEsw7UkWaa	It's the artist coming out in him.<br>  Um, it's not toilet paper in his back pocket. If you look closely you will see that sometimes it's a t shirt (usually signed) and sometimes it's a rag thing.

AGqnjmgpaa	the moon has a lot to do with the tides and the height of them. when the tide starts to rise with a full moon the tide will reach a higher part of the beach and a lower part of the beach at low tide. when there's swell the waves plus the tide height will bring larger sets of waves. cape town is always getting lots of swell from antartica and being that you got the indian ocean i would check out www.surfline.com. watch the news too, if theres a big storm coming this will also bring in a nice wind swell unless it becomes choppy and not fun to ride. i always wanted to check out j-bay after i watched endless summer 2.|`|SohrsIBoaa	low tide brings up higher barges. creates better depths and breaks in the waves. high tide is to deep.|`|RZfoszJFaa	sometimes it's hard to fight, paddle against, the outgoing tide in a shallow beach break.

My suggestion would to go  surfing a few times at low tide and high tide and just see what sessions were more fun.<br>  <br>  The Surfboard Man<br>  <a href="http://www.thesurfboardman.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.thesurfboardman.com/</a>|`|xhPKkkELaa	Every break is different. It is a function of the bathymetry (bottom contours) and the typical swell. I surf at some breaks that really only fire at high tide. I also surf at one in particular that is really at its best at half tides. There is too much over the bar for it to 'break' on ,most high tide days, and it is too shallow for a decent ride at low tide.<br>  <br>  Get to know the breaks where you surf, surf at different tides and different winds so that you can predict for yourself what kind of session you'll have.<br>  <br>  Also, an off-shore wind is great, if you have a strong, consistent swell coming in. It "holds it up", But especially on less consistent beaches, like the east coast of the US, there are days when there is a weak swell, a too strong an off-shore wind actually holds down the swell, and 'chops' it up. So, it just goes to show that no one condition is always BEST at all different breaks. You have to know the 'behavior' of your particular breaks.|`|LHWxeKk0aa	trial and error mate, or just watching other people surf at different tide levels. a lot of beaches don't work well on a high tide because the extra depth means the waves are fatter and slow.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.skateboardexpress.com.au/longboards" rel="nofollow">http://www.skateboardexpress.com.au/long...</a>

In 2008 he entered the Elimination chamber and won but that injured him he held the title throughout april but lost it because edge was deemed as a better champion.Undertaker knew his career wasn't going to last forever and he was still injured.So he kept competing until he left after One Night Stand where he lost and took time off from wrestling.He returned to Hell in a cell whilst recovering and he was 100% since after i quit,last man standing and casket matches.He hasn't been seen on tv because he takes a break because of his stamina and body health but he will most likely have one title shot left in him and his 2007 reign was supposed to be long but was cut short due to injury.He much like shawn Michael's doesn't have much of a career left and they have had there glory considering they have both been wrestling like 15 years and ave had numerous title shots so they give the younger guys a Shott|`|EhxW0610aa	could be for any number of reasons:<br>  <br>  1)sick that night<br>  2)family emergency<br>  3)injury that required a week or some days off<br>  <br>  If he has beens MIA for a long period of time, i would start to worry...|`|ywU3ZpIgaa	He is not lazy he is just getting old and is having a lot of injury problems|`|YCUJMvWQaa	Because he wasn't part of the ACT that day :)<br>  Wrestlers gotta take their breaks of course and they can't have every wrestler in one episode episode...unless they did a last man standing match or another thing|`|Z5bH2LOZaa	This question is a joke right.

YNYpmhy6aa	The answer 45 is wrong. On the last tour (2005) to New Zealand head coach Clive Woodward did indeed take 45 players (it ended up being 53 due to injuries) but it was commonly acknowledged at the time that he took far too many. <br>  <br>  In the amateur days (up to 1995) about 30 players were taken on longer tours, often lasting months. There were no substitutes in those days (well, sometimes one was allowed) so by taking 30 players they had more than enough players. <br>  <br>  Whenever Ian McGeechan has been head coach ('89, '93,'97) he has taken 35 players, and has publicly said he intends to take the same number to South Africa this year.<br>  <br>  <br>  In 2001 about 45 players were selected once more but this tour was regarded as a failure. <br>  <br>  <br>  In summary, 45 players have been brought on a Lions' tour twice, but both tours were abject failures. Every tour before this contained 30 players, except when McGeechan was coach (as he is for 2009) - when a touring party consisted of 35 players.|`|KTvNnssTaa	Question for Caz D.

8379c575798db3493c5c0194efc05e70aa	Flat pitches are the norm in the subcontinent, but I can't remember such a huge score made by any country on the 1st Day whether at Karachi or elsewhere in the subcontinent. It also is relevant as you point out about the hard hitters not being there in the SL top order. Even if the bowling is ordinary, such a high score must have been avoided through fielding, field placements and captaincy tactics to at least check the boundaries that were coming thick and fast. It may be a little early to judge, but the signs are galore about lackluster captaincy and team spirit/approach..... and if suitable tactics could not be framed even in the final session, then even the coach is to take blame heavily. They could have at least copied Dhoni's 8-1 field plan to check the runs when Samaraveera and Jayawardene were in sustained unbroken partnership of over 200 in such quick time! This is a strange Pak team under the new coach and captain and yes, very much looking like on a great fall since there seem to be no excuses that can gel.|`|AA12122890	Well it can be argued that pakistan has not played a test match since for over an year , still a score of 400+ on 1st day speaks volumes of the wonderful batting of SL. <br>  <br>  Ya the pitch too can be a reason but these can not take away the brilliant performance by SL. <br>  <br>  You cannot make a comment like that about pakistan after just 1 day.

jeXc6UV8aa	You should definitely play.  You are really tall and seem very athletic.<br>  Depending on how you were trained to run, and your other skills, it sounds like you could be a good wide Receiver or running back. Also, If you are a good thrower you are plenty tall to be quarterback. I would go out and try it all, then ask your coaches what they think.|`|ymqWa8GNaa	The answer is in your hands|`|42223372622a38f2018e30c03299ab0eaa	You are obviously a jog.

H82AYTpsaa	i would trade for beltran|`|M9JF9qcOaa	I think Beltran for Soriano is a good swap. They are similar players, as Soriano has a little more HR and steal potential versus Beltran's safe 110 Runs/RBIs (both should average about .280). If you want the RBIs this is a good deal.<br>  I think Bay will basically repeat, so you are swapping steals for RBIs. If this suits your team it's not a bad trade, but I would shop around before taking it.<br>  Both guys are safer than Soriano injury wise. If you do the deal, I'd rather have Beltran over Bay.<br>  <br>  Trading for a first round pick is always expensive, and Braun looks like he is no exception. Unless you are loaded in the middle infield (Ramirez will have SS/2B eligibility which will prove very useful as the season progresses) I would not do the Braun deal. Soriano is a very valuable player in his own right, don't forget.

NG6eeCfuaa	Chris V: I answer this question as it struck my curiosity. I'm not really sure about the Miami Heat's rims, however, I can tell you that back during the 1990's, Duke University was accused of this same thing. If you ever get a chance to see a Duke game on ESPN Classic or something from the 90's, you'll easily notice the same thing. Those rims were so loose you just had to toss the ball on it and it would eventually fall in.|`|6e9wMh6yaa	This is my theory:<br>  The NBA balls have small pieces of metals. The rim, which looks normal, is actually an electromagnet. The electromagnet is turned on and off by the bastards in the NBA. This is how teams get "hot" and "cold". And when the "superstars" make 3-pointers in the 4th quarter, you better believe that the electromagnets are turned on.|`|zg1lIy7Oaa	One word : STANDARD.<br>  <br>  There are NBA officials that check everything before an NBA game.|`|AA11340147	Oh, come on.

RjQLB9s1aa	A broken string is always a hassle, even if you have a spare racket. It breaks your concentration, and forces you to adjust to a different racket in the middle of a match-which can often mean several lost points.<br>  <br>  Even with improvements in string technology, breakage is as common as ever, due to the increasing popularity of thinner strings and high stringing tensions. In order to reduce breakage, it is important to understand that it has several different causes. Each may be addressed through a different approach.<br>  <br>  The first and most common cause of breakage is stretching the string beyond its elastic limits-similar to pulling a rubber band until it snaps. This usually occurs on one of the central four main strings, within an inch or two of the racket’s head.<br>  <br>  The sweet spot is the most resilient-and hence most powerful-area on the racquet. No matter how clever racquet designers may be, they’ll never be able to make the sweet spot extend right to the edge of the racket head. Every time you mis-hit outside the sweet spot, you’re stressing a relatively unresilient section of the string. There’s simply not much string to stretch between the ball and the edge of the racket, and if the forces are too great, it snaps.<br>  <br>  <br>  Stringing at lower tension will reduce the incidence of this problem, as will the use of a thicker string. But don’t change both at once. Approach the problem systematically, change one or the other, and play on the new setup for a few weeks before deciding what your next move should be.<br>  <br>  Other relatively common causes of breakage are string-to-string abrasion and cutting. Every time you hit the ball, the cross strings pound against the main strings. In time, they can cut through the outer jacket and into the core. Likewise, “cutting” and spin shots cause the strings to “saw” back and forth against each other, with much the same effect.<br>  <br>  Again, thick string withstands this longer than thin string, but there are better ways to resist abrasion and cutting. Some strings have two jackets or wear layers instead of the more common single wear layer. Naturally, two jackets will resist abrasion longer. Jackets may also be either twisted or braided over the core. Braiding is the more durable approach because the over-under-over design locks all the fibers in place. Even after a few jacket fibers have worn through, the jacket as a whole remains intact. In contrast, a twisted jacket may start to unwind as soon as the first fiber is breached.<br>  <br>  Over-stressing, and string-against-string forces are inherent in the game. They’re not entirely avoidable, but you can take steps to reduce their effects. Other types of breaks are due to racket defects or carelessness, and can be completely eliminated with proper attention.<br>  <br>  A broken, split grommet may present a sharp edge that can cut into the string. If the grommet is missing, the frame itself may cut the string. Next time the strings are out of your racket, feel the edges of the holes that are drilled into the frame: they may be quite sharp.<br>  <br>  The simple solution is to make sure the grommets are sound. A new grommet strip may cost $5 or $6: well worthwhile if it saves you a $20 stringing job. If the proper grommet strip is unavailable, your stringer may be able to install a piece of plastic tubing as a temporary repair.<br>  <br>  Temperature-related breakage is common in cold climates in the U.S. and Europe. Cold causes the string to contract, significantly increasing its tension. Furthermore, nylon, which is normally a very resilient material, becomes brittle when it’s cold. For both of these reasons, if a racket is taken directly from a cold car trunk and immediately put into hard use, the string can shatter.<br>  <br>  The solution to this problem is simple. You can protect the racket from the cold by transporting it in the heated cab of the car, and/or by carrying it in an insulated racket bag. If the racket does get cold, give it several minutes to warm up before putting it into play.<br>  <br>  <br>  Even with proper care, some string breakage is inevitable. As a string ages, it gradually becomes abraded and loses resiliency. Your best bet is to restring before such degradation occurs: newer strings perform better, and you’ll be surprised less often in the middle of a match.|`|4j7rodV2aa	Professional players tend to string their racquet's at higher tensions and they tend to generate a ton more spin with their serves (especially the high Kicker second serves) and their ground strokes which puts a mass amount of friction on the string bed with the strings sliding and grinding on each other. It doesn't take long for the strings to wear out & break. This happens more frequently w/ players who generate more spin.|`|mVUpt8waaa	I am proud (or unproud) to say that in all the years I have been playing tennis I have never broken a string.|`|qnbImhmbaa	Anger.|`|dbdKFCELaa	the power of the shot and speed of ball.|`|dsqm0x9Waa	The two main reasons you break your strings is:<br>  1:The amount of force hit, and returned from the ball.<br>  2:Any extremly powerfull slice (Left hand spin) will crack them.|`|eY1Vttiyaa	To break a string you need to hit the ball hard with topspin, that puts a lot of pressure on the strings.  If you hit really flat it will take longer to break your strings.  How often you break a string also depends on how much you play (obviously.)   I break my strings like once every two months or less when I am playing tennis often.  It also depends on the type of string.  If it a racket has a really durable strings like the pre-strung rackets (which I do not reccomend getting) it is not going to break for a while.  Hope that helps.

Cl6KbcAGaa	I have to agree 100% with Mtlbiker on this one and you likely will NOT be able to go up to 9 speed anyway because of spacing issues in the rear wheel  to accomodate the larger 9 speed cassette anyway. Buy a new bike as average cost for this upgrade will likely cost you $300 + and that is being conservative.|`|Z5xgSATSaa	9 speed gearing would not necessarily give you lower gears for climbing, but you would have more intermediate gears. Changing from 7 to 8 or 9 speed involves a major drivetrain upgrade. You have to change your cassette, cassette body, chain, shifters, and possibly derailleurs. The cost involved might be more than your bike is worth. I have an older mountain bike with 7 speed shifters, and my lowest gear is just as low as the low gear on most 9 speed systems. Most bikes sold now with 7 speed shifters are low end, and not worth the cost of upgrading to higher end shifting. It would probably be more cost effective to save up and buy a better bike.|`|fk23CmWeaa	I agree with the other posts that this likely isn't worth doing, but I want to add a couple points.<br>  <br>  1)  If it's a newer bike with 7 cogs, it is definitely lower end; but the frame spacing may allow for 9-speed.  The rear hub may not, however.<br>  2)  If it's an older bike with 7-speed, it probably has narrower hub spacing in the rear, which means a 9-speed hub won't easily fit.  A steel frame can possibly be modified to accept the wider hub, but a shop should do this, as there's a risk of throwing the frame out of alignment trying this one at home.<br>  3)  In either case, no one mentioned that the chainrings must also be replaced.  A 9-speed chain is narrower than a 6- to 8-speed chain, and will self-destruct under load if used on non-9-speed chainrings.  It may appear to work on assembly, but will eventually fail (trust me!).<br>  <br>  So...it might be a good idea to shop for a 7-speed cassette/freewheel with a numerically high largest cog, as this is what's going to make a difference in climbing.  34-tooth is usually the biggest you'll find on a 9-speed cassette, and 32-tooth is usually the biggest on those with fewer gears - makes a difference, but it's no night-and-day.|`|7l4tR0aZaa	well im  gonna have to agree with everyone else and say that its gonna cost m ore and not change much. but what u can do is since u probably have a 12-32t cassete now   u can get a 11-34t 9 speed cassete and have the shop take off the 2 extra cassete rngs then it'll be just like a 9 speed but u wont be able to go as fast because if u take those 2 extra rings off it may only be like maybe 15-34t or something like that, but u want lower gears so i dont think that'll be much of a problem

1q67udZKaa	Well, in my head, the Knicks win every game.<br>  <br>  So yes, they will beat the Raptors on sunday.|`|Nuj1eScCaa	If the Knicks can get simialr production out of their bench as they did tonight they have a great chance. Toronto has been very wishy-washy this season, very unpredictable team.<br>  <br>  One key guy for NY I think is Wilson Chandler, whenever he plays well the Knicks seem to win. His scoring is vital for them. You pretty much know what you're going to get from Nate Robinson and David Lee, it's the other guys that need to be on.|`|LCV8Aky2aa	Whenever Nate Robinson or Wilson Chandler are scoring well the whole team follows suite . I believe that David Lee will manage alright with Chris bosh although Chris duhon will do just fine against athony parker. I say Knicks.|`|8ivnzNi5aa	Which Knicks team will show up?|`|tzrLDbHWaa	I think so.  Well, I hope so.  Its hard being a Knicks fan these days, so ya have to hope for any win you can get.<br>  <br>  But, if you look at the way they played tonight, I'd say the chances look pretty damn good.

htQX8Ywgaa	He is one of my favourite Chelsea players, great all round and a battler.|`|LReOvHEdaa	One of the rare breed of players who can play in ANY position.|`|RSJbqioUaa	I think he's a great player :) I can't wait for him to return.|`|L1QTSErIaa	Micka?l Essien is a Ghanaian footballer nicknamed 'The Bison' due to his formidable strength, competitiveness and combativeness in the midfield area.<br>  <br>  Former England and West Ham star Sir Trevor Brooking insists Michael Essien has not received the recognition he deserves this (2006/07) season and claims the Ghana midfielder holds the key to Chelsea's FA Cup final hopes. 'Personally, the player who I think has been fantastic is Essien. He's brilliant,' he said. 'Because of injury he's often had to play at centre back, right back and sometimes even as a makeshift right winger. 'He's an individual that will play a big part if Chelsea win the 2007 FA Cup. 'Cristiano Ronaldo is a great player but in my opinion Essien could also have been named Player of the Season.'  <br>  "The first things that people see about Michael is his energy and tackling, and they classify him as a holding midfielder, a destroyer type of player. What they don't often realise is that he can also be very dangerous going forward. His positioning to receive the ball is very good, and he knows when and where to place a pass." – Former Lyon manager Paul Le Guen on his former player. <br>  "Essien is a great player. He can play every position in midfield. Where he is perfect in choices. In football, the most difficult thing is to choose well, and in every situation he chooses well. He presses, stays in position, passes long, passes short, first touch, two touches. He controls the pace of the game, fast or slow. He is midfield multifunctional, he is dynamic and strong. The boy has incredible physical power, he is super resistant with great speed and unending tactical abilities." – Former Chelsea F.C. Coach José Mourinho on his midfielder in May 2006 FIFA Magazine|`|ojHN65J0aa	Crazy, ridiculously powerful. Excellent long range shot.|`|mK06dus9aa	Different gravy|`|KHaoj2BWaa	he very good in playing and always quiet and calm|`|9kfmdYXyaa	he is an underrated player, and the unsung hero of chelsea<br>  <br>  with his presence, players like lampard and ballack can push further upfront... without him, chelsea seem very vulnerable through the middle, perhaps lampard is just too offensive|`|0VYpCXz5aa	The best defensive midfielder in the world in my world<br>  <br>  Good body strength , hard tackle , work hard<br>  <br>  and most importantly can score lot of goals from long shot|`|P7me6hptaa	She is ugly
aUGM3ju6aa	With a passion!|`|ZAh8CEoGaa	That was a foul on Kobe. But ofcourse since it's on the Laker house refs go with Kobe even though it was so obvious.<br>  <br>  To the guy that calle dme out. I can;t be bothered copying your username since its so retardedly written.  I don't care if you hate me. Look at the replay it was a clear push and a foul.  But since your a laker fan you'll never agree so just STFU.|`|dtGInk4Faa	Yeah his whole career is based on cheating. That's why hes the best guard in the league right now. If he gets away with some contact that's his own fortune. It doesn't mean hes a cheater.|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	Would you like some whine with that cheese?<br>  <br>  Hey Aroid, I couldn't care less.|`|t1uKdzmLaa	Wow, some of the Laker fans here are being a bit biased...isn't it better just to be honest and call it for what it is.

I believe Jordan was, is & always will be the best.  Kobe Bryant hasn't won an NBA title since Shaq left & every Laker fan knows that.  Yes so they're in 1st place in the western conference, big deal, many no. 1 teams have been knocked out of the playoffs before, not just in basketball but in any sport.  The playoffs is a whole different animal, the players tend to step up more.  Need I remind the Lakers fans how Kobe blew it last year in the playoffs against Boston, they will forever say he's the best, especially the younger kids who have never seen Jordan play.  And so what if they Lakers win this year, he's still no Jordan, as far as I'm concerned he hasn't won a title on his own & those 3 titles he has under his belt don't mean a thing.  We all know who's the best.|`|MnjOXJnJaa	yes. but it's not his fault refs let him get away with it. that was ridiculous, it kills me that he gets away with that stuff. a couple weeks ago he hacked Garnett's arm, caused a loose ball, and KG got called for his 6th. both were games LA should've lost.<br>  <br>  "you're jealous" is the most ignorant statement in someone's defense in the world. get original and have a point. that's embarrassing.|`|Cm2vFHQDaa	hornets did a great job tonight. too bad the refs are on the lakers side. those calls were unbelieveable. the lakers complain every time a foul is called. i don't know why they don't get t'd up for that.|`|4b63df522adcbbe3effabc36048eabe4aa	Are you done crying? Now grow-up, gather your thoughts, take the knife off your wrist, and suck it up. When I say suck it up, I'm not talking about your favorite players d*ck either... which is probably Lebron.|`|H8u7gMAYaa	Don't start this crap now. CP3 would of fouled him regardless.

g1ciF3DVaa	The only reason why Steve Nash had a few successful seasons was because he had Mike D'Antoni coaching him, they had the run and gun system and he had more possessions than anyone else in the league.<br>  Go look at his stats, he only averaged over 15 points and 10 assists in 4 of his 13 seasons (while chris paul has done the same thing in 2 of his first 4 seasons), and those were the seasons he had Mike D as a coach, as soon as he left his numbers dropped and even before Mike his numbers were low.<br>  <br>  don't get me wrong he's definitely a good point guard even though he's passed his prime now but he was seriously lucky enough to be in a system that allowed him to have as many possessions as he did which gave him the liberty to average double digit assists.|`|FUoKu13Daa	Do you know that Nash got back to back league MVP awards 3 and 4 years ago,<br>  <br>  The Suns were a hot team and he made then roll so he was getting the hype of CP3 and more back then, <br>  <br>  I think Chris Paul is getting more hype now is because of the success of the Hornet team, they basically came out of nowhere and the Suns has kinda falter no fault of Nash but they were not that high scoring machine they were two years ago,<br>  <br>  So Nash did get the hype back then.|`|tBuzrlSdaa	Well Nash has aged so he lost popularity|`|9UhoUcM2aa	Steve Nash is my Favorite Point Guard =)...then Chauncey Billups...then Chris Paul...|`|OVTVQHejaa	Here's why. Chris Paul is flashy. They get more attention. He is an explosive player. He is overrated but still a great pg. Now as for Nash, he did get two mvps. so he didnt get ignored. Also, Nash wasn't flashy. well he was a bit, but not explosive. He got the job done.|`|Tgy7n4HLaa	He's white and there's no really good white players besides John Stockton who was also a point guard.|`|EKM9AKc2aa	like Im getting tired of hearing Kobe & Lebron.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	Nash isnt flashy.  He doesn't dunk, he doesn't shoot often, he just does what a good PG should do.  The problem is that flashy sells, flashy gets hype, and Nash has always been just one of those guys who just goes out and plays the game.|`|H1VIZsutaa	He just wasn't as marketable as Chris Paul is, simple as that.
4c479c9c27bebd404d7ba657763fe54faa	There are plenty of users that speak their minds and bash certain wrestlers. Now, I'm not one of them. I do have opinions on wrestlers but I refuse, on any level, to post them on an answer that could offend other users. It's just plain ignorance, y'know, they bash but don't have valid points to back them up, it's like people just hate on wrestlers for no apparent reason, jumping on the bandwagon of haters. It's getting pathetic at times|`|1UKAho1iaa	Honestly, I think some fans are like this, myself included sometimes. There are certain wrestlers that I tend to refuse to open my mind about, but I think fans of anything are like this at times.|`|KIOR56r6aa	Agree with live and die.|`|NXktxy8jaa	Some people bash on wrestlers just to get attention. It is pretty Stupid to me...|`|zb40cLwOaa	YES. I think some fans are just so critical of every wrestling show they watch to the point where they really just shouldn't watch it. When I watch WWE I sort of lower my standards for actual in-ring action but I normally expect to see good stories. As for TNA I set my standards a bit higher for in-ring action (from the X-Division) and don't expect much from storylines. There are too many people that are gung ho for one product without giving the other one a chance. There are too many Edge marks who think he's the greatest heel ever. Basically a lot of wrestling opinions are really stubborn and annoying.|`|yEsw7UkWaa	Oh dear, you put out a question like that and ASK folks to think about it, and the first answer you get is some idjit who thinks ... well, hell knows what he thinks.<br>  <br>  Yes there are definitely some fans like that, and most of them hate John Cena (lol)<br>  I've come to learn that a lot of the people on here are simply bored and looking for an easy couple of points. Some don't really care what your question is about either. <br>  Then there are others that are genuine in their answers and can see the good, bad and downright ugly about ALL wrestlers. <br>  <br>  Sure, they are entitled to their opinions, but they also should be mature enough to think outside their little world. <br>  <br>  You know the old saying " You have to kiss a lot of frogs to get to the prince (or princess)"? Well, on this section you have to TROLL through alot of the ego to get the facts...<br>  <br>  Happy digging   :)|`|Z5bH2LOZaa	Firstly to the guy who answered first, Mrs Al D. If you don't like wrestling what the hell are you doing in here. Go back to the knitting section where you belong.<br>  <br>  Ok now that is out of my system. Of course people are like that. It is human nature. I am like it when it comes to wrestlers like Edge. The reason I don't like him is because I do not respect him as a wrestler. He is not that good and should not be getting the push he is. Plus he never wins his matches clean, and that drives me nuts. Look at heels like Y2J, while he cheats sometimes, he can still win a match clean and is a great wrestler. Hope this helps.|`|AA11528760	The "fans" in question are usually the ones who believe that they are 'smark' enough to criticize pro-wrestlers & the business, even though these fans themselves have no pro-wrestling/in-ring experience. But, they are not be blamed as they are still in the process of growing & maturing from a 'mark fan' to be a true pro-wrestling enthusiast.|`|avrF5MFVaa	AI D IS WRONG WRONG WRONG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

It may have been worser back in the day when ring psychology meant much more to the game and certain wrestlers would try to goad the audience into reactions that could generate legit brawls.<br>  <br>  If you mean on this site, though, I never read much into questions or answers. To be honest, I really don't read questions - or answers - that closely to pick up an overall style of the writer. I answer questions and move on.|`|nQHkkR8Raa	Yes, for example that arrogant ***** sucker W4L he just thinks he's right all the time but he isn't.<br>  They need to give people a chance to express their views, because it happens a lot for Wrestling fans, everyone has a different opinion!

JSryPP8faa	After hearing Boldin do a complete turnaround from his release request, I wondered just how long it would take Kurt to decide on his own future. Arizona is the perfect fit for both gentlemen. Your going to pay Kurt for three year's, two active and one to continue the grooming of Matt Leinart. After which Kurt reward's the team by announcing he'll go into the HOF as a Cardinal. Work's for me.|`|ymqWa8GNaa	Kurt Warner has league and Super Bowl MVPs, 3 Super Bowl appearances (where even the negative outcomes were determined on either the last play or close to it), 1 Super Bowl victory, and he mentored last year's Super Bowl winning QB, Eli Manning.  My question would be, how can you afford NOT to hire him.  The point is he knows how to win, and is outplaying the much younger, much ballyhooed Heisman winning Matt Leinert.  Of course you hire him - particularly if you're the Cardinals.  He maximizes their outstanding receivers because he still throws darts and brings incredible wisdom, judgment and personal winning experience. The positive impact he has on a team is immeasurable.|`|e8vTFYKMaa	Well last year if you said he had 2 years left, people would have thought he was crazy.  He was getting old and Matt Leinart was the Arizona man.  He made the pro-bowl this year had one of his best years ever.  If he stays healthy then yes he has 3 years left.  And yes he should in Arizona, they love him and he has two of the top receivers in the game.  Who wouldn't want to just throw the ball up to Fitzgerald, knowing that he will catch it.|`|BlgZmV6uaa	In football the contracts are not gurenteed anyways.Only the bonuses.So if it is a 2 or 3 year I don't see the differance.I honestly do not think he will play another 3.Maybe 2 (but that is doubtful when they are going to want to bring Lineart in as well and get something off that investment).They are not going to be spending to much money on one postion.|`|XwXuJIF8aa	He is good and takes care of his body, He never did an A-Rod. I think the guy is capable of another few years. He  is a devot Christian and that can help him a long way. HE does not take spirits and stuff. So he has the will.|`|5B6w8mxVaa	He just lost the super bowl  so he wants another chance.

Nuj1eScCaa	Bowen is dirty, there's no question he has purposely tried to injure a number of players. He is a good perimeter defender when he plays honest defense. But Bowen is a player out of the mold of Bill Laimbeer, just at a different position. <br>  <br>  Bowen goes out there and does the dirty work, frustrates opponents, gets under their skin, and if a star is scoring too much he'll put a knee out there to stop him. <br>  <br>  I don't think that Greg Popovich respects it exactly, it's just that the team has been successful for 10+ years and him not changing anything is understandable. Chuck Daly was the same way with Bill Laimbeer, he never told Bill to clothesline Larry Bird. Chuck wasn't that type of coach just like Pop isn't, but if the team is doing well not many coaches will complain. <br>  <br>  I'm somebody who is a lifelong Piston fan and I like the Spurs, but Bowen is dirty.|`|tBuzrlSdaa	I like watching Spurs sometime especially seeing Eva Langoria and checking her out the entire game|`|Tgy7n4HLaa	If I was Amare I would have whooped him.|`|9UhoUcM2aa	Bowen is a dumbA S S, I HATE HIM &&<br>  I freaking hate the spurs.<br>  they are all dirtyyyy|`|iWUkh5d5aa	check this out please !!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhTjSrZi91Y&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhTjSrZi9...</a>|`|JD5NQxeNaa	Bowen is barely in the rotation anymore. Who cares? He is borderline in retirement already. But, the Lakers will be in a rude awakening when the Spurs win the title this year.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	There are plenty of youtube videos of Bowen being dirty.  He's the Rodney Harrison of the NBA.<br>  <br>  Damn Lakers for Life, that one is actually worse than the original one linked.  He just went and dropkicked Wally.
vJyF8siJaa	Yes, Fisher is CLUTCH! he won this for us!<br>  <br>  three pointers, drawing a changre and steal in the overtime.|`|xhHfXuKFaa	we need to start winning better. if we blow teams out then kobe will have more stamina in the playoffs.|`|Ch9TedMcaa	That last 5 minutes was especially good.|`|TLZ3GEEXaa	Other than the multiple 3's the Lakers gave the Hornets in overtime and the bad defense in the fourth, it was a pretty good game. Good clutch three from D-Fish... and real smart drawing those offensive fouls from the Hornets.|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	Very lucky win. Paul gave us the chance when he got that charging foul at the end of regulation. Ugliest win of the year at home, but i will take it.|`|uxregJ0faa	We were lucky to get that win. Very fortunate. But it was a good game. Still mad about Hornets coming back from 16 and those 3's in overtime|`|dtGInk4Faa	Well Lakers are lakers. They prevail a lot.|`|IUxM3brbaa	Incredible game. I'm happy Lakers won because now I can sleep well tonight. However, Hornets are another of my favorite teams, so I enjoy watching them. CP3 = OMG. It's crazy he fouled out the first time in his career, but the Lakers should not have ever let the Hornets come back and I hope they learned from tonight. When CP3 gets his team on a run, he cannot be stopped. Also, there were a few bad calls but they went both ways, but who knows...they could have made a difference.<br>  <br>  Anyway, great game for both teams. Lakers = '09 champs|`|H8u7gMAYaa	Great game. I really hate how we play lousy D down the stretch in games. We really need to clean that up before we go into the playoffs.<br>  <br>  I'm just glad we have to veteran clutch players on our team. Can you guess who they are? lol|`|L9A81Xvvaa	Honestly it wasn't a good game EXCEPT the 3rd quarter and the overtime.<br>  <br>  Regardless, Lakers got the W which is all I cared for now :)|`|ZFTkBTvvaa	sound exciting but im disappointed, you won, i was betting for hornets.<br>  <br>  my team one, PORTLAND TRAILBLAZERS|`|Tgy7n4HLaa	Hell yeah it was a good game and the best team won.|`|apY85Qmtaa	Major nail-biter.

Not a bad kid, just ultra messed up. Tremendous raw talent though.|`|43daa72d6abd58775d0e46a24824eddeaa	the question is will he learn the game and use his speed in the right situations, breaking down defenses, causing mismatches, dropping double did-get dimes, becoming a complete point gaurd, only this second half will give us a true look...|`|fZ38PPgSaa	ya he is wayyy to fast he needs to slow down|`|kKbqdlbnaa	lol I was just thinking that. He needs to slow it down and wait for Yao.|`|sjnzoERfaa	yea
a6EndAPiaa	Well they hit each other as a way to say:<br>  <br>  "good job"<br>  "go get them"<br>  "let's kick some butt" etc.<br>  <br>  They do that by hitting each other on the butt (as opposed to somewhere else on their bodies) because of all the protective equipment they wear -- if they were to hit them say on the shoulder or head the recipient *might* not notice.|`|ymqWa8GNaa	It occurs in all sports. To those who play the game, it means "go get 'em!", just like slapping a horse on the flank gets 'em started... "off to the races", "tally ho", "hi-oh-silver"...  Don't attach any other meanings to it - there aren't any...|`|BlgZmV6uaa	You know I thiught nothing of it when I played sports.But if somebody did that to me at work or something it would take on a whole differnt meaning.Your right it is funny!|`|UqWIh5tAaa	That happens in all sports.|`|t2hu5a5Qaa	They do it to show they that they are proud of what they just did?

JD5NQxeNaa	Um you do realize that Larry Hughes is just a temporary fix right? He rid us of James, Roberson, and Thomas. That already is an accomplishment. He can help out Wilcox propel the Knicks back into the playoffs. Hughes is a chucker and can score. He is inconstant, but had a 40 point game last year and can shoot if in the right system a la Mike D's system. <br>  <br>  Chris Wilcox is athletic and has an offensive game and defensive game, unlike Jeffries a offensive  liability. This trade was done to rid us of garbage and take in quality players that Knicks would use know and throw away like a bad habit in 2010 when their contracts are up. Wilcox could likely be resigned. Hughes would not  be any harm to the Knicks getting LBJ23 he has no future here. Plus, I doubt LBJ23 will go anywhere he does not need to play in a large media market to be the iconic figure he is becoming he can play in Memphis if he wants and still get the endorsements.<br>  <br>  Knicks are going after Bosh and a sharpshooter that is what they need.|`|ZAh8CEoGaa	I hope Nate Robinson teaches him some tricks when it comes to dunking lmao.|`|Nuj1eScCaa	I think Lebron James going anywhere is a longshot. Hypothetically if the Knicks waited until the offseason off 2010, Hughes contract is up anyway so they wouldn't have to hang on to him. They obnly traded for him for cap relief. The Knicks finally ridded themselves of Jerome James contract which is great. <br>  <br>  With the way Cleveland is playing right now and how comfortable Lebron is with his teamates, I can't see anything that would drag him away from a good situation.|`|OsUyKT5Xaa	the knicks will still go after lebron because he is the best and will be the best for years to come|`|3zGTnghRaa	LBJ is gonna be a CAV!|`|s1IkFOJVaa	yea i know the knicks are stupid they should have waited to 2010
Cl6KbcAGaa	get rid of the quick release clamp and get one like this: <a href="http://www.performancebike.com/shop/profile.cfm?SKU=12690&subcategory_ID=5260" rel="nofollow">http://www.performancebike.com/shop/prof...</a> It will work much better and hold the seat no matter what. As most other answers say take it back to where you bought it and size the post up for one of these and you will NEVER have this problem again!<br>  It does not have anything to do with the paint coming off the post it just isnt the right size...|`|DOVbF4Piaa	You need to adjust the tension on the seat clamp.  You can turn the nut on the opposite side of the clamp so that you feel resistance sooner when you press on the lever.  The black paint will not make any difference as most people put some grease on their seat stem to keep it from seizing fast in the seat tube.|`|yr1bxdxAaa	You seat post is to narrow. bring it to your local bike shop to find the OD (outside diameter) of the seat post. using this find the ID (inside diameter) of the seat tube. this is the tube in which the seat post gets inserted. If you don't care to spend a lot of money on getting a new seat post, buy seat post shims. These are fairly inexpensive and come in a variety of sizes to fit your needs. hope this helps<br>  -Steve|`|CA7lEkYIaa	you didnt state if the bike was bought brand new or second hand either way like aready been said its the incorrect seat post have a ride to your lbs (local bike store) and they will show you the correct size hope this helps.|`|MW8YerEnaa	its the wrong seat post for the bike mate|`|Fo1Gm4Xnaa	Return it to the shop and let them fix the problem
w2nMrQzwaa	yeah, he looked cool in the glow in the dark stuff, but i like the face paint to. Maybe if they combined the two, he could have a similar face paint to what he has now, but it glows in the dark for the entrance.|`|sMjndu1Eaa	Yes. He really looked good in the glow in the dark stuff.|`|xKXu0Qb2aa	Glow in the Dark Jeff OWNS.|`|yEsw7UkWaa	Yep.<br>  I answered a question about his face paint saying that I would love to see the glow in the dark design come back. He used to use it on his face and arms for PPVs, but I think it would be a neat thing to see on regular editions of SD as well. <br>  The full face thing he uses now is jut to much like Warrior and Sing.<br>  I know he's an artist and this is a great way for him to express himself, but there is a point where you have to say " What am I doing?"|`|dPi7zMxWaa	yes it was awesome but he said in an interview that he didn`t like it so neatly done and it gets robed off in the match any way.

jzbG6ZjQaa	First of all...Are you sure that fear is not the main issue? <br>   At 5,my daughter who was very lean,but had the ability to help carry in groceries and would carry a gallon of milk in each hand with No problem,yet,had difficulty climbing(rope) ladders or holding herself up on the monkey bars. <br>  Children will exert more energy & strength when they're attempting something that they have little fear of. Once she realized that falling or slipping wasn't the end of the world,she would attempt to steady herself and use her strength to climb another rung.<br>  As you provide the reassurance,that if they fall,they will be ok,work out with push-ups.  Push-ups are the best source of upper body strength.  Make it fun...whether a competition or game;anything it takes to have him push himself to exert the strength necessary to do the exercise. In time he will succeed in being a monkey!|`|xKutb3dtaa	1)you could take him to a local swimming pool and get his arms working.<br>  <br>  2)Ask him to carry stuff around the house e.g books or even just the empty plates of food.<br>  <br>  3)Ride his bike (if he has one,that will get the strengh in his arm and legs).<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope i helped good luck.<br>  xx|`|QuUoDkBLaa	You shouldn't be "training" him by building up and toning muscles in his arms.<br>  This is just one of those things that children can either do or not do, in my childhood I just got put on them and when I said I couldn't do it, I got told to swing myself and grab onto the next one whilst my dad would stand by me incase i fell.<br>  He will soon be able to do it, if not he will just need to wait to develop naturally a bit.|`|sessNZ7zaa	My son is the same, there seems to be a few things other children his age can do that he can't in the park play ground, but there are lots he can do in other areas that they can't! All children are different, i don't think you need to build him up in order for him to use the monkey bars, he will do it in his own time like everything else! All you can do is be there to build his confidence!

She did 2 matches last season on ABC radio and channel 10 asked for a copy of the tape of her calling the matches, and they were impressed. <br>  <br>  She will create history as being the FIRST woman to call an AFL/VFL match EVER on tv.<br>  <br>  <br>  Here for full story: <a href="http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,24896049-662,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0...</a>|`|sjWBmBTCaa	You lot are kidding. She has no idea what she is talking about. If you had to chose between Luke Darcy and her to listen to about football, who would you prefer. Strap on the boots love, take a few hip and shoulders and shirt fronts, then you MIGHT have some insight as to what it is you are talking about. She can go back to calling games with that moron rex hunt.|`|7Ek9YkUhaa	Asterix i'm pretty sure the game im currently watching is between geelong and adelaide, <br>  Turn on channel ten, it's nearly half time.<br>  <br>  Oh and I don't know who it is but it sounds so weird, I don't like the idea and i'm female.|`|hTruYNUQaa	The female caller is Kelli Underwood,has been at chanell 10 for the 3 years.<br>  <br>  Underwood was at 3AW before moving to 10.She also called a game at 3AW with Rex Hunt and the Late Clinton Grybas.<br>  <br>  Give her a chance she is ok.|`|xmg9CBnCaa	after a couple of more weeks, she'll get more comfortable. And she definately knows her footy. she sounded kinda awkward tonight though.
ZAh8CEoGaa	Since MJ retired for the last time it was Kobe after 2 Final apperances an MVP title and scoring titles.|`|Ch9TedMcaa	KB24|`|JD5NQxeNaa	Tim Duncan|`|H1VIZsutaa	The obvious answer is Kobe, but I say Shaq. He has made 15 all-star games and might be in the top 5 scorers of all time by the end of his career. And he has won 4 championchips. So I say Shaq.|`|3teWTOPqaa	Skill-wise: KB24<br>  <br>  Accomplishment-wise: Timmy D|`|dtGInk4Faa	Kobe Bryant|`|HLzS2z9laa	best as of greatest is Shaq, and we all know it|`|ZFTkBTvvaa	we all know who it is<br>  <br>  he has a yellow jersey no doubt about it<br>  <br>  and the second one we all know again<br>  <br>  the third is brandon roy.|`|H8u7gMAYaa	Kobe Bryant followed by LeBron James a CLOSE second.|`|Tgy7n4HLaa	Kobe Bryant without a question.|`|tBuzrlSdaa	Kobe,Lebron, Wade, Shaq?|`|apY85Qmtaa	Tie between Tim Duncan and Shaq|`|ExVTrokAaa	Kobe Bryant|`|QmUbe395aa	Kobe Bryant|`|DRJ2KYE5aa	kobe
qVDY1hm5aa	You've got to think bout everything here. So here we go!<br>  <br>  Book up for Lance Storm's wrestling school: $600.<br>  Flight to Canada: $800.<br>  Rent an apartment (six months): $275x6= $1650.<br>  <br>  Book up for FCW: $750<br>  Flight to Florida: $175.<br>  Book an apartment (six months): $325x6= $1950.<br>  <br>  Ring of Honor: +$1250 each month.<br>  Book an apartment (six months): $300x6= $1800.<br>  <br>  Flight back to Florida: $175.<br>  Book an apartment (six months): $1800.<br>  <br>  IF you get signed to WWE, that's where the big bucks will roll in. :)<br>  <br>  This all adds up to.. $10600. It sounds pretty realistic and you'll have you're ROH salary plus you've got to think about bills, food and drink so I would say about $11500. I hope it works out for you (I'm from UK too) and if you do make it big, don't forget me :).|`|NblIfn2Qaa	A lot but, it wouldn't matter, if you get hired by WWE/FCW/TNA ect. ect. because you'd get the money back. Obviously, if you got hired by FCW & TNA you probably wouldn't earn as much as being in the WWE but I think it's worth it. Go for it.|`|gXeDKVLJaa	$5000 , then maybe more in the long run,
RSJbqioUaa	He is.....<br>  Cos the commentator keeps saying "Drog-barrr"..|`|KHaoj2BWaa	because he don't feel to|`|OE3Asxxaaa	He is too old now, he come back from injury and looks really slow and tired when he is on the ball, however he should look at the best striker in the world Fernando Torres and improve his game based on his mightyness.|`|AA12362958	Is this a serious question or just meant to be a Joke?? <br>  <br>  Sure I believe you still know how Drogba look likes?!<br>  <br>  He's 'playing' but not as good as he should be..just trying hard to make sure his name is still on Roman's pay cheque.. Haha|`|0VYpCXz5aa	Because Hiddink is a great manager like Scolari<br>  <br>  Even Paul Ince won't play Drogba if he's in the team|`|p8ahZa8iaa	He is, but since the guy never seems to touch the ball I could see why you would think he wasn't playing.|`|me36q49Qaa	He was?! Not very well, but he was.
4lHtlCRdaa	i dont think so... i cant find it anywhere on the site :( i was hoping 2 watch it!|`|fsLMFIpgaa	It's not on TV. I checked CH 9 & Fox Sports & neither have it.|`|zoB64Ymoaa	I dont think it is. I couldnt find it either! Its on at like 4 or 5 so it could be on the radio?|`|Ed1rDghCaa	Sorry not being televised in sydney.Maybe you may have a delayed version|`|1yVSvCXKaa	Check on www.google.com OR www.search.com
d2OLxA72aa	What the WWE Writers should have done is let Chris Jericho keep the title belt until WM25, which would setup one of two scenarios: Jericho vs. Cena vs the Animal or Cena vs Jericho with the Animal interfering costing Cena the belt. If Cena won the triple threat match the could give Jericho his rematch (which by the way he didn't get) and than start a feud with the Animal (who would turn Heel).<br>  <br>  Or since Cena won, they could have had him lose the belt to JBL and than have Shawn Michaels win the Royal Rumble setting up a match at WM25.<br>  <br>  Beth Phoneix deserved to have kept the belt until at least WM25 and than possibly lose to Melina, and setup some interesting wrestling matches between the two.<br>  <br>  They should have CM Punk vs Rey Mysterio for the IC belt, and than turn on Rey.<br>  <br>  MVP vs Shelton Benjamin.<br>  <br>  But this is WWE and without any clear competion they are Lazy.|`|lShrQOgnaa	I agree wrestling used to be so much better but since wwe keeps buying out the Competition the wrestlers are getting a little complacent.|`|aEntHSbqaa	When there is no strong competition, people get complacent. Its only natural.|`|yEsw7UkWaa	Your point is very true and I agree with all that you've noted.<br>  The only thing I can tell you is look at how the WWE has gone through changes in the past.<br>  These phases come and go rather quick. So it won't be long before WWE notice the backlash against their current product, and move onto something else.<br>  Just hang in there ... yawn along with the rest of us.<br>  LOL|`|f0f91b1f61307e94f9c53fd86e2c1295aa	I agree, WWE isn't the same anymore its sad to think the haydays of 2003-2004 are gone. The days when the bag guys were bad. I think WWE goes into a slump when they make HHH a face.I miss evolution and eric bischoff and all that. *sigh*|`|XDuo03wEaa	I liked the WWF From 1997-2001<br>  <br>  The only good part of WWE I Love was from 2002-2005|`|GExKoh1Gaa	stop sittin and whining and watch something else.maybe desperate house wives will suite your needs

tl1HTJRwaa	Fire the commentators.<br>  Fire Cornette, Booker, Nash, Steiner, Team 3D.<br>  Hire Shannon Moore, Paul London, Elijah Burke & re-hire Petey Williams.<br>  Hire Paul Haymen as a creative writer.<br>  Focus on storylines & have less promos.<br>  Stop bringing in every reject from the WWE and get some young talent from the INDY circuit.<br>  Get some focus on the X Division Division<br>  Let Abyss go hardcore again & put Hernandez into the heavyweight championship picture!<br>  <br>  TNA have all the makings of a great company but lack one thing good leadership; people who can make decisions for the good of the company<br>  <br>  EDIT: less gimmicks; shark boy ripping off stone cold?<br>  Suicide from a video game?<br>  Supe Eric a super hero with super poweres? (I remember when he broke out of handcuffs)<br>  Bring back Kaz and Daniels asap<br>  Own Original storlines|`|ePvvGUu3aa	The basic thing they need to do is get back to wrestling. Their not the worst company, but they do need changes or at least go back to their roots. The X Division needs to be revived and the main event needs to be worked on, especially the whole Front Line vs. Main Event Mafia storyline. They seem so tossed up with their storyline where people end up so confused about what their trying to get at. <br>  <br>  Cross the Line? Whatever happened to "We are Wrestling"? It's not a bad thing to have an attitude like era added, but not too much of it where it's shoved down our throats. As another user pointed out, Paul Heyman and Eric Biscoff would be great. They need to be more organized. Their doing alright, but not using the best of their potential.|`|dcNT65mTaa	Well in my opinion every great company begins with a great rivalry and the MEM vs Frontline wasn't it. They get an A for effort, but a C- on the execution. It was too massive and took away time from what could have been great feuds. Then the fact that everything ends with an interruption really hurts. They need to get two great entertainers and let them wrestle one hell of a match and they need better story lines. They can keep the old guys for nostalgia purposes but the feuds have got to get better.|`|4tvI9WYjaa	look no one said you have to watch tna|`|d2OLxA72aa	The problem with TNA is that they are bringing in to many old wrestlers from WCW or WWE. Plus the story-lines are the same from previous companies. They Need to Promote their own Stars.<br>  <br>  They should have promoted their own stars like: A.J. Styles, Samoa Joe, Beer Money(which they are doing), Petey Williams(can't believe they got rid of him), and keep pushing the women's division because that is going great.<br>  <br>  The monster Abyss is like ManKind, with the mask and being confused.<br>  <br>  Maybe bringing in a superstar like the Rock or even if Chris Jericho would think about it after his contract is up.<br>  <br>  Having Kurt Angle in TNA is a Huge Plus.|`|6LQNK51uaa	Problems in TNA<br>  <br>  --Annoying announcers<br>  --Worthless and Countless Promos<br>  --Old Wrestlers like ,BooKer T,Team 3 D,Nash and Steiner<br>  --No Storyline or too much of story in one storyline<br>  --Nearly dead X-Division<br>  --Too much of interruption/run in  in one match..no clear endings<br>  --Last but not the least Vince Russo<br>  <br>  Cure this problems and TNA will be the top wrestling promotion|`|sMjndu1Eaa	They should change that 5 sided or 6 sided ring whatever it is back to a 4 sided ring. Change their entrance tunnel to a big screen like the WWE and come out of curtains from the sides and get better and much bigger wrestlers over six feet like the WWE.|`|XdQYUC2paa	TNA need to stop treating their talent like while<br>  S<br>  H<br>  I<br>  T<br>  <br>  They must give Aj or Christopher Daniels a World title<br>  <br>  Also they SHOULD fire Nash and Steiner<br>  <br>  AND DONT FIRE GOOOD TALENT LIKE PETEY WILLIAMS!|`|iWcTmuhAaa	Don West should be replaced with Paul Heyman.<br>  Eric Bischoff should be hired as the General Manager.|`|1yOdrYiHaa	If they bring new Writers and come with interesting storylines , that would help tna alot|`|hdp7bv45aa	Nothing|`|4eQqTiYwaa	Sign Paul London and make him X division Champion|`|Iqtoxb5laa	They need to come up with better storylines that HAVENT been done.|`|yAtY3OuNaa	EVERYTHING  but if i did like it i would say STOP STEALING WWE SUPERSTARS. thats all have a nice day|`|avrF5MFVaa	YOUR WRONG!!!! WRONG WRONG WRONG!!!<br>  <br>  THE CHAMP! IS HEE_UHHH!!!|`|1z7M3Tntaa	More focus on the younger talent and less on the older ex WWE/WCW talent|`|bSsBGrZVaa	Few things needs to be changed in TNA<br>  <br>  1. 6 sided TNA ring is worst so they should make it<br>  to only 4 sided like the original style<br>  <br>  2. They should fired many untalented people from its<br>  roster & sign some new popular & great people for TNA<br>  <br>  3. TNA should have only 4 titles in the company & they should<br>  vacant TNA legends title<br>  <br>  4. TNA should have a new staff of commentators,ring announcer,<br>  backstage interviewers & much more<br>  <br>  5. TNA should have stay with one show impact & have some great<br>  matches every week with interesting storylines<br>  <br>  There are many ways to make TNA the best but i think they are<br>  the few ways to make tna better thats all
tBuzrlSdaa	When are you not bored lol? Everytime I see you saying your bored. Anyways I dont always like him because sometime he takes random shots. But he is helpful and a good pg for us. Farmar is a good backup as well. Good birthday gift eh? And for extra im straight so I wont answer.|`|g1ciF3DVaa	Amazing.<br>  <br>  I love how he drew the foul on CP3, that was crazy. Stupid play by Paul though the shot clock was off they had a 3 on 1 he could have pulled back and they would have won easily.<br>  <br>  Anyway then Fisher hits the game tying 3 on the next possession, and to finish the quarter off he plays great defense on Paul to force a miss =]<br>  <br>  Great game, came through in the clutch like he has in the past.<br>  <br>  Gotta love D-Fish.<br>  <br>  And umm, i'm a guy so i'd have to say Candace Parker from the Sparks....pretty hot ;)|`|9UhoUcM2aa	The 3 was Huge.. i was soo happy<br>  I thought Kobe would take it..but I'm glad that Fisher did. <br>  It was a GREATTTT game.. =) Fisher did awesome. and of course Kobe did AWESOMMMEEE .. i love him. =) lol<br>  <br>  ohh Happy Birrrthday <br>  <br>  and if I had to choose... I think Ariza is cuter than Gasol.. but Kobe is the best looking player in the league =)=)|`|vJyF8siJaa	Happy Birthday Janet!<br>  <br>  He has Clutch Today, he made the best play of the game when he drew the foul on a 3 on 1 fastbreak then force OT with his 3.<br>  <br>  The play was perfect Kobe played decoy and Fish got open and nailed the 3.<br>  <br>  Candice Parker is cute.|`|SehQJ3Kjaa	Not Bored! But tired after a long day painting. "Happy 17th"!|`|OVTVQHejaa	Heres a crafty veteran in D Fish who knows when its big and knocks em down (Think 0.4). And in terms of cuteness.... Well, I have to say Gasol because he takes shots that are cute. Soft shots and layups. And for a big man, he can't be cute. He needs to toughen up. Ariza is a more aggressive player and likes to be in attack mode.|`|2c7e8c6a806e859860fb77a44becc650aa	Oh my goddddddd....are you serious!! ???  Gasol is the ugliest mother fuker in the league.  him and Sam Cassell can duke it out for the ugly trophy.  Fish shouldn't have pussed out and left the jazz (on purpose). I hate that complaining every drive rapist colbe.  AND HEY LAKER FAN...QUIT SEIZING COLBE UP WITH MICHAEL JORDAN.... jordan never bitchedd as much|`|D61u7t1zaa	I hate and like Derek Fisher. Sometimes he takes dumb shots and goes too fast on offense<br>  <br>  But that 3 he hit was huge. The 2 guys chased Kobe haha and Derek made a beautiful 3. Veteran Point Guard, thats we need. Good job Derek!|`|W6jjsiMxaa	D-fish is a clutch player, and a very good veteran player.<br>  <br>  Pau and Trevor are both cute.<br>  <br>  Happy Birthday!|`|Tgy7n4HLaa	He is the Fish that saves LA.|`|Ch9TedMcaa	That was a great shot by Fisher!<br>  <br>  <br>  And happy birthday to you! Stay young as long as you can! Trust me.
ETfgBxUbaa	i think matt will get a chair and hit jeff|`|F3VjJAdiaa	captain charisma is exactly right. it's a non fight building up to wm25|`|gXHxf2G9aa	I'm looking forward to seeing them going at it but I think that Edge will interference or it'll end in a count-out or disqualification.  As for who I think'll win I'll have to give it to Jeff.  He's been giving a push atm so its unlikely they'll take that away from him now....|`|j9GokH9Qaa	I don't think Jeff Hardy will fight Matt Hardy and will ask him to move on.. however, I do think they will have a match in Wrestlemania 25...|`|pZJPz6CGaa	The Match will end in DQ to further the storyline.|`|5A8ZIv4Naa	matt will win next week<br>  jeff will win at wrestlemaina|`|lGIL36faaa	they r not gona fight next week coz jeff doesn't want 2...but if they did have it then i think jeff wud win, i agree with u|`|W0rRfLU0aa	see lucky you up here smackdown isnt broadcasted until 11:30 <br>  but i will look foward to that matt will win because he is the heel in the situation, and until the big deciding match Matt will have the advantage|`|28gp5hh4aa	someone will interrupt

27fd034847d3d27fde933f822451de7baa	Good Idea category   no question!!!|`|OrG2fBbKaa	Life is short but the classes are long. The powder only lasts a day or 2 , your education is more than just in school.  If you have to ask here for permission to go skiing, you do not have the needed maturity to graduate and get out in the real world.   School is to prepare you for life, change schools if you need to and learn about life. Live,live,live.|`|qyATAaeXaa	I had a 3.5 my senior year. I cut a week of classes to go to Mardi Gras. My parents knew (heck they drove me to the train station) and most of my professors encouraged me to go. Some even gave me tips on what to not miss and bars to avoid. I went to school in PA, so it was a big trip for me to head to NOLA for a week. I missed one test and was able to make that up when I came back. <br>  <br>  I'd tell your parents you are going. They are gonna find out sometime anyway and if something should happen then they at least know where you are. <br>  <br>  My junior year I also cut a bunch of days to head to Killington for a few days, not to mention all the other days I cut classes because we had good local snow. I say go for it.|`|PCFx0PVuaa	If your parents are paying for you to go to college you should definitely tell them. They probably don't want to pay thousands of dollars for you to go skip class for a ski trip. But the trip sounds really fun so it depends on what you think your parents will say/how they will react|`|fJbWRwsmaa	Yeah, go. Just solong as you're good at all of the classes you'll be missing so youcan pick back up quickly by just reading the textbook.|`|SRzL2Wexaa	WTH, you only live once.|`|Ir7JA6IUaa	So why don't you just wait until Spring Break and go so you don't miss classes??  Being a goody-goody, I'd never skip that much school.  A day or two is one thing, but an entire week?  How do you plan to make up all the studying that you are going to miss.  I guarantee that you are not going to study while you go on your trip as you'll be too tired, so you're gonna come back having to make up a heck of a lotta work.|`|VEUa5Zudaa	First of all, why are you so worried about what your parents will think. When you graduate are you gonna check with them on everything you do? If so, I'm sorry. If not hell yeah you should go ride sound like you need to live a little.|`|zmDRaVL8aa	go for it! youre obviously smart enough and CO has some awesome skiing, some of the best in the country for sure. living in snowless places must be depressing and everyone needs some risk and excitement!|`|aEjr3nKIaa	Dude go 4 it
BI6DPapoaa	no, it does not matter if you have more education than other jockeys if you are a jockey. in fact, a lot of jockeys have dropped out of school. joe talamo, a famous jockey, dropped out in his sophomore year. there were also a lot of jockeys who have dropped out of college or didnt go to college. so education really doesnt matter. the trainers and owners only hire jockeys they think can ride their horses well, they dont think of education. between two jockeys who are equally good riders, the more educated one would not have a greater chance of getting the horse, it's the one who rides better. twenty five years old is a bit old, but you can still go. there was a woman recently who just got her license at age 40. so if this is what you really want to be, then go for it.|`|D1beU6MPaa	A college degree is not required to be a jockey. And having one will or help or hurt you. The following is what you need to become a jockey.<br>  <br>  The first thing you need to know is as much about horses as possible. Know breeding aspects, training, how horses run under what conditions.<br>  Get to know the industry, trainers, hot walkers, grooms, etc. Get to know other jockeys an get tips on how they got their start.<br>  Watch your weight. In most countries a jockey can never weigh more than 115 pounds. You have to maintain weight in order to meet weight requirements..<br>  Most jockeys start by working in other aspects of the training process. They hot walk horses (cool them down after training) grooming and participate in exercising duties long before they actually become a jockey. They get to know the profession and decide if this is the career they want to have.<br>  You need to go to Jockey School such as Frank Garza Jockey School in Southern California. There are also jockey schools like Chris McCarons in Kentucky..<br>  Going to jockey school is not required, but if you are not Grandfathered into <br>  it, it is a big plus. If you can already ride and can pass the test by the <br>  stewards, it is not necessary.<br>  <br>  You start by running schooling races. These are races that help you get familiarized with racing and track facilities, and prepare you to become a jockey. Often this is required before you can obtain a jockey license.<br>  You must have a license in order to be a jockey. Most racetracks provide applications and the license is good for any racetrack within a given area. Recommendation from a trainer to jockey school is a huge plus. <br>  <br>  Jockeys are paid on a per mount (race) basis. The fees are between $30 per mount and $100 per mount depending on the purse structure at each particular track. Those are the fees jockeys receive if they do not finish first, second or third. The jockey of the winning horse receives an amount equal to 10% of the winning owner' s share of the total purse. (The winning owner in most states receives 60% of the total purse.) The second place jockey receives 5% of the owner' s share of the second place purse money. (The second place owner receives 20% of the total purse in most states.) The third place jockey receives 5% of the owner' s share of the third place purse money. (The third place owner receives 15% of the total purse in most states.) The most successful jockeys can earn over a million dollars a year. The least successful will make less the $20,000 per year. The record for purse earnings in one year by a jockey is $23,354,960.00* set by Jerry Bailey in 2003. *These are the earnings of the horses, not the jockey. As a rule of thumb, a jockey' s real earnings are approximately 7% of the horses' earnings.<br>  Source(s):<br>  Horse owner and breeder<br>  Avid horse racing enthusiast|`|c998fe67be5cb4ac3684f3ebe6f35f94aa	I should not think they have much of an education as they all come out with expressions like "He's RAN a good race". Even finishing school Emma Spencer says this.<br>  To address the serious part of your question I think 25 IS too old to enter the jockey ranks as for one thing there is an age limit to the apprentice allowance so that without an allowance and the time to ride it off you would be very much restricted for rides. Check this out as the rules may differ as between flat racing for apprentices and jump racing for conditional jockeys.<br>  There are however other opportunities to enter the racing game with the qualifications which your mother aspires to for you so you need to do some research with careers advice.<br>  Edit; I hope you are not disappointed with my reply as the point about the apprentice weight allowance is very important, which you might not have learned in the Careers section.
Y4RS35M7aa	The only 30 caliber pistol that comes to my mind (other than the Ruger Blackhawk in 30 Carbine) is the CZ-52/Tokarev pistol in 30 Luger (7.65x25mm, 30 Tokarev).  This cartridge delivers a little 90 gr round nose at ~1300 fps.  The 9mm Luger is typically a 124 gr bullet at ~1000 fps<br>  <br>  fps- Feet Per second.|`|3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	30 Caliber<> thumbs up.*|`|69a47001c8449771a6964bf1c2360497aa	if you're asking about the 9mm pistol vs. the .30 caliber rifles: .30-30, .308, .30-06, or even the .30 US Carbine the thirties win hands down.  If your are asking about the ancient .30 Luger (or variants) pistol calibers the .30s will have more range & velocity but the 9mm will still have be a better stopper at reasonable pistol range.  Remember, these old .30 caliber pistol rounds were only loaded with FMJ (ball) ammo. <br>  <br>  H|`|IoyJXzoyaa	I could be wrong, but im gonna assume you had  typo and meant .38 or .32 instead of .30 as there arnt any handgun rounds commonly referd to as .30 cal.<br>  <br>  According to the cci ammo catolog I got this year the numbers are as follows:<br>  <br>  9mm (115 grain)<br>  mv=1145fps <br>  Drop of 0.9" @ 50 yds.<br>  328'lbs @ muzzle<br>  278'lbs @ 50 yds.<br>  <br>  .32 auto (71 grain)<br>  Mv= 900fps<br>  Drop of 2.0" @ 50 yds<br>  128'lbs @ muzzle<br>  112'lbs @ 50 yds<br>  <br>  .380 auto<br>  Mv= 945fps<br>  Drop of 1.7" @ 50 yds  <br>  188'lbs @ muzzle<br>  166'lbs @ 50 yrds<br>  <br>  .38 sp +p (125 grain)<br>  Mv= 945fps<br>  Drop of 1.7" @ 50 yds <br>  248'lbs @ muzzle<br>  218'lbs @ 50 yds<br>  <br>  Its pretty clear from the numbers that 9mm comes out on top in every catagory.  Assuming similar bullet design and expansion, it will have the must punch of all ".30 cal" handgun rounds listed.  Max effective range for any handgun is going to be short, but a 9mm provides less than 1 inch of drop out to 50 yds.  After wich it, like all hand gun rounds, begins to drop like a rock.  I'd say 50 yards is proabably the realistic max effective range for most people with any hand gun, and that's a stretch if we are taking about targets smaller than a pie plate.  Of the rounds listed the 9mm is the flatest shooting, and therfore the easiets to shoot perciesly to that range.<br>  <br>  Hope this was informative,<br>  <br>  -Greg|`|a954809e4f18646ae09e77b29aee6dbfaa	9mm is a week calibur.

C7A34HFMaa	David Beckham is an above average player who has managed to revolutionized the marketing side of football - for better or worse.<br>  He's one of the few - if not the only - football player who's a bigger brand than he is a player.|`|xvuAQ0DAaa	No on all counts except overhyped. He has a good free kick, and married a spice girl. He looks good when surrounded by great players but in weaker teams gets shown up for what he is.|`|f43be0279e4f60717eb598a32d93faa0aa	Well he certainly splits opinion so there will be thumbs going all over the place here.<br>  He is a skillful player with excellent vision and awareness, top quality passing and dead ball skills. <br>  He has never been a true all rounder as even when young he was never a fluid dribbler of the ball. Although he was deceptively quick as a younger player he was never going to trouble the fastest defenders, hence the improvement in his awareness/passing over his dribbling to overcome this weakness in his game.<br>  <br>  As a marketed image, brand Beckham was vital in promoting British football around the world, and in Asia particularly. Not many others get a lifesize chocolate model in Japan, not even the top movie stars. He also helped to cement the Olympic vote, (whatever your views on this) and has equally lifted football off the local pages to some major national media outlets in the US.<br>  <br>  The fact that he is considered a good looking lad obviously has made him bigger than some other better players of his generation, (Zidane is just one example).<br>  <br>  He has proven time and again that he has got the skill, drive and determination to perform on the biggest stages. His return to form at AC Milan after being written off more than 2 years ago being a prime example. <br>  <br>  He has also surrounded himself with quality advisors and is not as simple as many have made out. In fact this image has possibly helped him to win even more hearts than if he was seen as a highly intelligent, articulate and driven business orientated player.<br>  <br>  Ok, so slightly overhyped, maybe, but he has never given less than 100 % for his country, unlike some others. A pioneer off the field, definitely.|`|fcd41ae13b5b45292cfeda0b4cdff32baa	yes, definitely....

B4evWMcLaa	if you are talking about increasing your level to semi pro or pro soccer, the game is basic, but fast. all you need to practice is your first touch and pass. how well are you at controlling the ball in the air and putting it to the carpet with only 2 touches? how well can you pass and meet the target on the ground and in the air? the game is simple, half the stuff you have probably been taught is wrong.

qE8olVtaaa	E) Stone Cold & The Rock era was the best!|`|1yOdrYiHaa	The easy answer would be the Attitude Era but I really like the 80's more, except for Hogan. In the WWF you had guys like Bobby Heenan on the MIC, who was funny as hell. In the NWA/WCW you had the Horsemen who had a love/hate relationship with the fans. Like them or not they were the best thing going at the time. In WCCW you had the Freebird/Von Erich feud which is one of the greatest in history.<br>  All promotions had great tag team wrestling and also had real women wrestlers not barbie dolls posing as wrestlers.<br>  I think easily the 80's was the best years for wrestling. There were more regional promotions that really made the fans feel like they were part of the show , THE 80S HAD GREAT TAG TEAMS REAL TAG TEAMS. WWE HAD COMPETITION THEN NWA AWA. THE TALENT WAS JUST SO MUCH BETTER BACK THEN. MORE GREAT TECHNICAL WRESTLERS BACK THEN.|`|valvULe3aa	The Attitude Era.

The reason I chose Undertaker is because he was been the most loyal superstar in WWE history, he remains undefeated at Wrestlemania which is the biggest stage of the year, he has remained in the WWE as a singles competitor for over a decade and his gimmick of "the deadman" to his credit....and that's what he'll be remembered for the most :)<br>  <br>  Hope this helps :)|`|bSsBGrZVaa	HBK

Good luck playing tournaments with no players. Big ups to Andy !!!|`|3d3d2a18b838d322464051559bd8c0e3aa	A very informative question!<br>  Thank you! That's cool. Someone actually stood up.|`|VefSnu0Gaa	i just read it, i can not believe it... the defending champion withdraw :(<br>  he is awesome for doing this, i mean he has so much to lose and still he rejected his chance to defend his title there even with rafa and fed out of the picture, i think that reflects what a great person he is, although i'm a little bit sad for his decision 'cause he's gonna lose a lot of points and that's not gonna be any good for his ranking :( , he's such a silly sweetheart!!! and i love him for it!!!!<br>  :D|`|zN0orpp3aa	He's really awesome. I always had a lot of respect for him, but this takes it to a whole new level. Most improtantly, he will get as much respect as anyone in the locker room has ever gotten. It was nice to see that he pulled out because of Shahar and not because he faked an injury. This is really, really terrific.|`|KReWaGFsaa	I'm not a fan of him but that's awesomely nice of him to give up alot of points just to stand up for Shahar.|`|Nkwv2hygaa	Not a tennis fan, but I admire Andy Roddick even more now.
4eQqTiYwaa	I already play hooker so sucked in ... jokes lol<br>  <br>  <br>  i believe it sorta sounds like a hookers job so it looks like u will , <br>  <br>  just keep doing what your doing and u should be no.9|`|HTulGtABaa	If you were the stand out at hooker position your coach has every reason to put you in there but wasnt that obvious to you already? lol Not being a smart **** but it sounds like you were just bragging lol anyway good job & good luck at dummy half|`|Uyz6iZwKaa	You sound like a good hooker to me ... either that or lock but most probably hooker. <br>  <br>  Goodluck with it!|`|4c7b9e16b013d7a80f814a8aba5339dcaa	Yeah sounds like you have the goods.|`|W3mm0LdYaa	UM ARE YOU GAY MATE WHY WOULD U ASK SUCH A DUMB QUESTION ASK YOUR COACH THIS NOT PEOPLE ON THE INTERNET WEIRDO
ZAh8CEoGaa	Probably at one point but still LeBron and Kobe will play great D on them and probably not even get close to the rim.|`|JD5NQxeNaa	Any, NBA player can shake up an NBA player badly. I have where mediocre players shake All-stars. It happens it is the NBA everyone in the NBA has talent. Some more than other granted. But, Skip 2 My Lou a And1 player found a place in the NBA and has crossed over All-stars and many players. So, I would say yeah if it was a good enough And1 player he would have a chance to shake Kobe or LBJ23. Some guy on the Mexican International team shook Kobe means nothing just means he can possibly play in the NBA.|`|zg1lIy7Oaa	Anyone, even if he is not an AND1 player can make Kobe or LeBron shake badly. There are plenty of talents that aren't discovered yet, and they can be better than Kobe or LBJ. Let's take Ricky Rubio as a sample, this 18 y/o guy who plays for Spain last Olympics is so great that Wade and Kidd had troubles guarding him. So it is possible that someone out there can make Kobe or even LBJ look like a fool.|`|b85499a57edbf5a1f37bce5ce90c8557aa	Possibly... But just once.. At which point either Kobe or Lebron would turn on the focus and torch any of them.. Consider Rafer Alston.. Top notch AND1 player - slightly above average NBA point guard..<br>  <br>  Kobe and Lebron are both hall of fame prolific players.|`|ea68d20a9f8a2f1b110b43fe61244a44aa	I can shake Kobe or LeBron with a Bin Laden costume and a submachine gun. That's what an And 1 player would need.|`|3zGTnghRaa	every1 gets shaked here n there... but i guarantee u they cant beat kobe or lebron1 on 1

ZSchvX1Yaa	Yeah stone cold might be coming back.<br>  But its going to be either JBL vs Undertaker<br>  Or Shawn Michaels vs Undertaker.<br>  Didn't you watch RAW this week?<br>  HBK & JBL made a deal saying whoever wins the match next week will go on to Wrestlemania 25 and try to defeat Undertaker.|`|Z5bH2LOZaa	I doubt it because he has not been wrestling at all. He would need some matches under his belt before he got in the ring at WM25. Plus they have already set up Taker v HBK for WM25.|`|yEsw7UkWaa	No, as the others have said, it will be Taker vs HBK.<br>  Austin was possibly a "stand-in" photo WWE used until the details of the main event were finalised.|`|XdQYUC2paa	I don't think he will wrestle but he WILL be at Wrestle mania <br>  Austin has stated that after his HOF induction he will be done with WWE and will just stay at his home and do his own thing<br>  <br>  He will probably be a special Guest ref or have a Goodbye Beer Bash!|`|d2OLxA72aa	It would have been Stone Cold vs Jericho, but not now.<br>  The WWE and Stone Cold couldn't come up with the money arrangement.<br>  <br>  So more than likely a great wrestler like Jericho will be stuck with Piper or Flair. Two over-rated wrestlers.|`|AA12394248	yes u did see him on a wm25 poster but he has been replaced by john cena. stone cold will be at wm25 if he dont fight jerico he will be ref for orton vs hhh taker is facing hbk.|`|4eQqTiYwaa	yes u saw a poster with stone cold on the front but the wwe have now changed him to cena , plus if austin wrestles itll be against chris jericho|`|dPi7zMxWaa	maybe that would be a good match but he tends to be a special guest referee.
ZbNXVQu7aa	Mathematically speaking, it's still possible for the Raptors to take the #1 seed.  Will it happen?  Only if H-E-Double-Hockey-Sticks freezes over in the next 2 months.<br>  <br>  As for making the playoffs, that's a much more reasonable goal.  For starters, Milwaukee won't hold onto the #8 seed.  Secondly, Chicago has been maddeningly inconsistent all season long (and they're now hoping that unloading Larry What's-His-Name will make them better), so that's working in the Raptors' favor.  Next in line is New York, who are only 2.5 games ahead of the Raptors.  As you can see, only improved play from Chicago will guarantee that the Raptors will miss the playoffs.<br>  <br>  I'm hoping that Charlotte takes the final East spot from Milwaukee, but the possibility does exist that the Raptors sneak in instead.|`|ZdNSSm0waa	Don't criticize my opinion!|`|clgc86Voaa	Its the Eastern Confrence. Their are three powerhouses in the East which are the Celtics, Cavs, and Magic. Then theirs the playoff bond teams like the Hawks, Heat, Pistons, and 76ers. And finally the terrible teams in the East. All the teams i mention are going to the playoffs. As for the eight and final seed to enter the playoffs is up for grabs. Sure the seventh through four spots are also in reach but those teams above the eight spot have been to the playoffs before and i dont see any of them not making for the playoffs. So the eight seed is their for the taking and i dont think the Buck will hold on to especially missing Michael Redd. Right now they are 6 games back from the eight spot so they can make it in the playoffs if they win a lot of their games and they have the talent of all the bottom teams in the East to make it, but i think the Bobcats will sneak in the take the eight spot. I like the Bobcats even though a lot of their players are young.|`|t1uKdzmLaa	Theoretically, it is possible.<br>  Since the motivation of the team is very low; I don't see it happening. Plus, acquiring Marion and Barnes during a low point for the franchise doesn't help very much...they become just as unmotivated as well (especially Marion since he knows he can just bounce at the end of the season and go somewhere else).<br>  <br>  I think it would be more beneficial for the Raps to tank the season and start rebuilding the franchise by getting decent draft picks. I support the Raps; but I gotta be honest.|`|V56QJ9iUaa	well... we do suck like hell, but when u look at the numbers, theres still 25 games.. and were down by 5 games...and you never know what can happen in the NBA
sMjndu1Eaa	Yes. It is true. I mean every club in the NRL has more than one polynesian in their team, so by 2012 there's no doubt Polynesians in the NRL would be about 40%-65%.|`|R5G9h2ygaa	This is true. Last year it was covered in an article that polynesians made up something like two thirds of all junior rep players. I think 40% is roughly the current figure considering the rabbitohs were fielding 10+ polynesians in their 17 on a regular basis last year|`|ARQIxiSGaa	its very similar to rugby in new zealand. there is two sides to look at it. <br>  <br>  1) that most of these players are born in Australia ( or New Zealand) and consider themselves Australians so if they are the best at the sport then whats wrong with them making up the majority? <br>  <br>  2) polynesians in general are quicker to develop physically and therefore are bigger and stronger at a younger age. in contact sport like rugby league and union this size and strength advantage makes such a big difference, especially in the younger grades. this means that these bigger guys could quite conceivably be putting off the smaller non-polynesians, often before these players are fully developed, mentally or physically. with such great numbers of polynesians dominating the younger grades is it going to put the likes of andrew johns or alfie langer off because they dont wanted to get smashed every game?...or maybe even the likes of shane webke or glen lazurus may not have been the quickest developers either and may not have made it through the grades if they were being over run by the bigger stronger polynesians every weekend. ultimately a lot of these big fast polynesian players do not become the stars of the game, because you need some extra to be great, so the worry is that the numbers of them playing could be  detrimental to the game as they maybe scaring potential greats away before they even get started|`|AA11653773	If Union in Australia had a decent national professional competition it would be made of different cultures. Since most polynesians can't afford to go to Uni their only way to earn a quid is to play League and end up in the NRL|`|xi1ikHbuaa	no.<br>  only girls, birds, Sheilas.|`|TICbH7draa	i heard it wil be about 50%
JD5NQxeNaa	Reinstate a team in Vancouver again. I mean if Seattle wants a team and David Stern has a hard on for introducing new franchise markets to the NBA why not bring back a team in Vancouver. Realistically, for the Thunder to be kept and the Sonics to be reinstated the NBA needs to even out the teams from 30 now to 36 a new team in each division. Stern already expressed interest in getting a franchise in Las Vegas and St. Louis - that's 2, 3 w/ Seattle again and they need 3 more. <br>  <br>  The reason Vegas has taken, so long is that it is NBA regulation for an NBA franchise state not to have casino ties to the NBA franchise and being that it is Vegas it would be kind of hard to regulate gambling.|`|ZAh8CEoGaa	Winnipeg.|`|s1IkFOJVaa	toronto is enough|`|f35bf12a8eff1dc4cd38d5447b69023aaa	now they have toronto, but maybe montreal.
1q67udZKaa	Unless the Raptors can get deep into the playoffs next season, Bosh is going to leave the Raptors one way or another.|`|c4f990227b47ccb63474c4e73590acb5aa	He will definately stay with the team until 2010 but unless the Raptors go deep in the playoffs next year or actually make some decent moves this offseason there is no way he is staying.|`|JD5NQxeNaa	He is going to leave for New York money in 2010|`|Tgy7n4HLaa	He will probably not get traded during the off-season he will wait until his contract expires in 2010.

4eQqTiYwaa	I think they scrapped the idea , and instead will have him their and will probably play a role in jerichos match , which will surely be against a legend the way things are going id say Chris Jericho vs Stone Cold w/ Mickey Rourke|`|yEsw7UkWaa	The last I read (a few weeks ago) was that Mickey had decided not to do a WWE thing as the Oscars may frown on him doing so and not give him the award.<br>  He also told Larry King that he wasn't too keen on doing the storyline as he isn't a wrestler. Having done the movie he has a lot of respect for the wrestlers and doesn't want to waltz in like he knows what he's doing.<br>  He wants to be taken seriously as a actor, and doing a WWE storyline could ruin his chances of a major comeback...|`|77b5BDf3aa	He will fight Jericho and win with the help of Rody Piper most likely maybe even with Ric Flairs help.|`|aEB5p3pPaa	MICKEY ROURKE WILL NOT WRESTLE JERICHO.BECAUSE STONE COLD WILL SHUT THE HELL OUT OF JERICHO AT WM25. MICKEY WILL JUST WATCH JERICHO WHILE SITTING IN THE CROWD,THEN STONE COLD WILL MAKE ROURKE STEP IT THE RING AND ROURKE WILL DELIVER A WRESTLING MOVE TO JERICHO.|`|NblIfn2Qaa	His agents have told us that Mickey is NOT wrestling Jericho in WM25, the reason is because the Oscar's have told Rourke if he wrestles Jericho he wont be liable for the Oscar.|`|OHVCytOwaa	So????

LdQgPU2caa	Undertaker Will win it he is the best ever!!|`|dcNT65mTaa	If we're talking something the WWE would actually do, Cena would win.

d2OLxA72aa	Hopefully they will not allow this to happen, as neither wrestler needs to prove their worth.

tnITO9F9aa	First of all I wouldnt fine the drivers for cursing because sometimes its hard to control your emotions during exciting or frustrating times so either quit fining them or wait to talk to them once they cool down and gather themselves. It would bring back alot more excitment and emotion to the sport.|`|3971fad8bfeb5090ffc3629ffe9dbd80aa	First thing is let the drivers do testing<br>  Get rid of the Chase<br>  I agree that they need to keep the reporters out of the drivers faces after a race until they've had a few minutes to settle down a bit and at least get out of their cars. Cut the pre-race crap back so the whole race can be run, especially if there is a chance of showers. They have the weather forecast so they know if it's going to rain or not. Just go right to the race then show all the pre-race  stuff post race. Nobody likes to see a rain shortened race.|`|aRy2ZvT9aa	Dump the chase, No top 35 owners pts fastest 43 race no matter who you are.and send the Lucky Dog back to the pound, you race your way back to the lead lap (great drivers did it back in the day) and no past Champ Provisional, if you are a past champ you should know how to qualify. and then I'd bring back The Rock, and put the Southern 500 back in Darlington on Labor Day..<br>  <br>  Go Dale Jr & Hms|`|Ek1x32WHaa	Get rid of the stupid, ignorant fans who think they know everything!!!!!!!|`|YN8Rbjogaa	I would change the pre-race bullcrap...for example...last week at Daytona, they knew it was gonna rain...so what do they do? They have over an hour of pre-race junk instead of saying to Keith Urban, "hey it's gonna rain and we want to get all 200 laps in, so we're gonna start the race early. If you want to hang around and watch the race and then come out when the race is over and play you're concert, fine. If you don't then we'll see ya" NASCAR calls the Daytone 500 their  "Super Bowl" and then they only run 3/4's of the race! UNREAL!|`|d1wXxd9paa	Things in NASCAR have changed so much over the years.  The first and foremost I would lose is the total commercialization.  It's turned more into a 3 ringed circus than an actual race.  The Chase for the cup needs to go because there really is no point to it.  The calling off of races due to rain (ya im a disappointed fan from this year's 500) and hold them the following day.  I agree with dropping the fine for cursing.  Put yourselves in their shoes... Driving 180MPH and some jerk cuts you off... what's your first instinct...Flip him off and curse. (ok well I know that that is my first instinct).  Make it less about getting celebrities and make it more about the fans. (Opening ceremonies "Start your engines" should be done thru a contest or picking someone from the stands there)  It just seems to me that NASCAR has been bought by Companies and it's more for them and less for us the fans... Mike pay attention you are going to lose hard core fans...|`|MYC6Xv1Xaa	get rid of the chase.|`|8ivnzNi5aa	Let the racers drive Mustangs, Challengers, and Camaros.  Allow the use of fuel injection. Get a 10-mile long road course built somewhere, with enough room on the track to let the cars go eight wide, even in the turns.

GswnLKtQaa	Yes, he's improving everyyear, the only thing that's holding him back to be an all-star player is he not a starter. after Nash retires Barbosa will have a chance to prove himself, he's just like Jason Terry very good players off the bench, but Barbosa is more explosive.|`|dDhTMacAaa	Well, this is tough.<br>  <br>  Barbosa has talent but he is not a starter and he can be streaky. He really only fills the stat sheet when the Suns run the up-tempo offense and in that case, he can fill it up.<br>  <br>  However, the West is packed with young and veteran shooting guards like Kobe, Brandon Roy, and even PG's like CP3, Deron, Tony Parker, and Chauncey Billups, and others.<br>  <br>  I would say no, but if he goes on a tear for half a season, then maybe - but that tells you that it is quite a long shot.|`|TbEwkoQDaa	If Suns can advance to NBA finals this year and Barbosa can lead the team in scoring, he can be an All-Star next year.|`|8f5b3518bbb478f324587b828536a78eaa	He could have made the All-Star team this year if it wasn't for Terry Porter's half-court game.|`|4DcvpQXfaa	I guess yes<br>  <br>  But he should be better than Roy,Kobe and even Durant next year!|`|LqQvCvLAaa	maybe if he starts for a living|`|W6jjsiMxaa	Yes!

q2TOb6unaa	I feel freedom. All my stress and worries are gone, my mind is clear, and all I'm doing is enjoying the moment. It's how I get away from the downside of life and all the problems that come with it. I don't have to impress anyone or do anything for anyone. <br>  <br>  If it's with friends I'm just having a good time and enjoying life. The best feeling is when you hit a huge jump and your just floating through the air like a bird and you get that adrenaline rush. <br>  <br>  It's also a sense of accomplishment. When you've been trying to land that 720 then you finally do after days of attempting. That feeling is amazing.|`|jTaW3goeaa	Intense, Adrenaline pumping through your body.|`|UULgRsDSaa	when you just schralp (thats my word for it) the powder, it feels like you're gliding.  it really is amazing<br>  <br>  the feeling that you are experiencing nature to its fullest is just awesome|`|gu2MmdRFaa	Its amazing!<br>  <br>  The wind rushing through your hair. <br>  Nothing to worry about except for if you fall off the side of the mountain.<br>  lol<br>  <br>  Its AWESOME!.

AA10270018	How can he be underrated? Before he retired, he was #1 on the p4p list, how much higher can he go? I think he is overrated, not underrated.|`|lHzBJA4eaa	He gets nothing but respect when I hear people talking ( for his talent not his attitude). There has to be a way to get him and Pacquiao in the ring .I think Hatton will be interesting but not a serious threat .Mayweather and Manny need to meet . There hasn't been two legitimate fighters of this caliber in quite some time.|`|74d926bbb467954124e827daf8495652aa	First of all in all honesty Joe does not only fight guys at the end of their career.  He recently beat Mikkel Kessler who is a beast at 168-175. Bernard recently beat a prime champion in Kelly Pavlik so he obviously had a lot left in the tank, as well as Roy Jones Jr who beat Felix Trinidad earlier in the year. And I dont care how old Tito is, he is still a great fighter.  He had much more in the tank than Oscar did when fighting Manny yet many are still oohing and ahhing that joke of a performance.  Floyd is the kind of fighter who unfortunately had the wrong upbringing which affected his personality. I truly believe that is the main reason people dont like him. If you ever see the real Floyd he is a very down to earth nice guy with incomparable skills.  However, because he rubs people the wrong way, most fans want to see him get knocked out or claim his skills are limited which is a joke.  His power is underrated and his opposition was elite.  He will be appreciated one day as one of the best ever but not for some time.  If he does come back he can and would beat anyone under 154.|`|pR0pJNJkaa	Floyd was at the top of the game when he retired. He beat everyone thrown at him and I personally love the exit on top with the KO of Hatton. I do agree with you though that Ring magazine and HBO boxing never loved him and always tried to discredit his achievements. He was pound for pound the best in the game, everyone recognized that...but I think your question is more about historical ranking against the greatest of all time. I agree with you that I have never seen a better defensive fighter. Like Lennox Lewis said...It's a game of hit and not be hit. Floyd fought everyone in their prime. His punch location and speed was superhuman. He was a ring general and he always was the best conditioned fighter in every fight. I think he is the most perfect Fighter I have ever seen...but I will let my father and his guys tell you he couldn't have beaten Ray Robinson. I grew up with Ray Leonard, but I think Floyd would've beat him in a classic.|`|3q8LkLLDaa	i do not think he is underrated, but his haters who put him down i think they do it from envy ,like same goes for Joe calzaghe,rocky marciano, ricardo lopez and Sven ottke!<br>  i mean no matter who u face,when u step foot in a ring,ur first opponent against u, is URSELF!<br>  there r days u have headache ,stomach pain,depression (they say tyson was depressed as hell, in the day he lost from douglas, so now i am asking u he lost from douglas or from his bad self??think about it) family problems,i have heard for athletes who had so much stress or even fast heart beats that they had to quit etc etc (u know athletes we idolize them and we have so high expectations from them, but many times we forget that they  are human beings as well,they are not Gods)<br>  whoever fights 39, or 46, or 49 or ,51 times and he leaves all these  times from the ring as a winner to me he is a LIFE WINNER!<br>  is not easy to do that no matter who u fight with!<br>  u will hear oh floyd or joe did not face him or that guy or this guy!<br>  these are good reasons to debate i will agree, BUT POINT IS, THESE GUYS never lost against their selves and this is their biggest achievement ever!<br>  <br>  whoever has been an athlete of any sport ,not just boxing ,HE WILL UNDERSTAND ME COMPLETELY!|`|670zynUbaa	yep|`|bqrLJeceaa	yep im a flloyd fan and i think its because of his attitude. Imagine he won peoples hearts like sugar ray leonard and oscar, then he would have gone down as the greatest fighter in our era. But if people hate you they will discredit everythink you do. Look at manny pacquiao, skill wise he is not even on floyds level however because of his personality many people will think he is better than floyd.|`|805a76b8f5c2c8cc13c121d74753809aaa	floyd mayweather was rated no 1 pound for pound during his last fights in every boxing bodies and the ring magazine. how could he be under rated?<br>  <br>  how i rate him or by anybody else in here means nothing, in fact all our comments...fantasy ranking....etc. all are just our opinion.|`|aym20hIgaa	mayweather retired because hes scared to fight big fighters like cotto , or paul williams, and now sugar shane, maywheather can beat berto thats about it.. mayweather is scared and running for his life..|`|bIbyAkHPaa	Nope.

1WgOj89kaa	The only way he would lose his U rating is if he changed his character and turned heel. But that would be a huge risk for WWE as doing that would lose all of their young children following.|`|d2OLxA72aa	He is nothing like the Rated R SuperStar, who takes advantage of the things handed to him. Oh wait, that's Edge.<br>  <br>  No Cena is great on the mike, gets enough heat, but they should try and push other superstars in the making: CM Punk, MVP, Jack Swagger.|`|yEsw7UkWaa	I'm not quite sure I understand what you mean by U rated star.<br>  Can you clarify?|`|5j81EoVXaa	not unless he turns heel|`|EhxW0610aa	do you mean Underrated superstar? if so, i dont think so. People seem to diss him because of his wrestling ability...|`|ywU3ZpIgaa	No he wont lose the U rating because as a face he is bringing in 100s of million dollars with his merchandise being sold to 5 year olds|`|ATyoVtehaa	Is U like E. Cause is is Exempt which means it doesnt need to be classified
Jsy1xsL1aa	Because he is fat, ugly, and too old. He used to pretend he was a biker like Chuck Columbo did too. Undertaker is an old has been who is just trying to act cool. He is a lazy bum and everyone knows it.|`|NWtgYyF6aa	He had a title run in 2007 up until May 11th the reason he hasn't had a decent run is because at Backlash 2007 he got injured and that's why he lost the title to edge.He took time off and he recovered for the end of 2007.He received title shots but took a physical toll from the hell in a cell 2007 at Survivor Series.He entered no#1 at the royal rumble and was eliminated about 15th because of the injuries and his age hence why he was entrant 30 in 2007. In 2008 he entered the Elimination chamber and won but that injured him he held the title throughout april but lost it because edge was deemed as a better champion.Undertaker knew his career wasn't going to last forever and he was still injured.So he kept competing until he left after One Night Stand where he lost and took time off from wrestling.He returned to Hell in a cell whilst recovering and he was 100% since after i quit,last man standing and casket matches.He hasn't been seen on tv because he takes a break because of his stamina and body health but he will most likely have one title shot left in him and his 2007 reign was supposed to be long but was cut short due to injury.He much like shawn Michael's doesn't have much of a career left and they have had there glory considering they have both been wrestling like 15 years and ave had numerous title shots so they give the younger guys a Shott|`|dPi7zMxWaa	No his is on there and he comes on but there having other things that take up the two hours when the show is on like right now there having the Hardy`s fight and stuff like that just a week or two ago he was on Raw.|`|NblIfn2Qaa	He's got too tired of banging Michelle. See what happens. LMAO|`|Z5bH2LOZaa	Hey Cookie, first answer, go back to a girl sport will you.<br>  As for Taker, if you were his age you would need a little time off as well. As for those who wish to bag him, I say get in the ring with him and then you can bag him. He is an Icon.|`|1WgOj89kaa	That's why WWE has not given him a title run in 1 year, im sorry to say it but he is past his best and no, he cannot have a title run while he is working part time.

vJyF8siJaa	I don't think the Lakers need more players but if i pick between horry or moore i'll take horry. it will be good if he retires as a Laker. It's also only temporary becasue once Bynum comes back there won't be a spot again.<br>  <br>  horry could also give verteran leadership to the young players.<br>  <br>  nice article, thanks for sharing.|`|zg1lIy7Oaa	Robert Horry is a much better player than Miki Moore but LA Lakers needed someone who can man the paint. Robert Horry is a natural Power Forward while Miki Moore is a center. Lakers lost Bynum and they only got Didier Ilunga-Mbenga as a natural center. Gasol is comfortable at playing the PF position and Lamar on SF position. If LA is going to sign Horry then Pau will be on starting center, Lamar on PF and Walton or Ariza on SF. But if they are going to sign Moore then players will stay on their same positions where they are comfortable and dominate while Moore will just replace Bynum's slot.<br>  <br>  One more thing, since Lakers got plenty of shooters, they don't need Horry's soft touch outside.<br>  <br>  BTW, thanks for sharing this article...|`|AA10744471	A good article. Thanks for sharing. I prefer Horry to come back, at least temporarily, to the Lakers instead of Moore.

juNabfMCaa	Well, I would'nt say Cena sucks, but yes, he can be overrated. And he does the same moves every match, it goes like this, diving shoulder block X3, Spin Out Powerbomb, Five Knuckle Sovle and then the FU. This can be really boring sometimes. I think if Cena does/learn more moves, he would be fun to watch.

Boston is a nice place to be, there stadium is the best! They got good jersey's! Plus, everyone is nice! 1 more thing Red Sox players that get traded usually say they want to go back to Boston because they like it there.|`|DLevM7WDaa	The Detroit Tigers. They arn't that popular a team in the market, but they usually sell out, and are a fun team to watch!!! As a player on the Detroit Tigers root for either Magglio Ordonez, Miguel Cabrera, or Curtis Granderson. They are all fantastic players, and never get in trouble.<br>  <br>  Have fun!!!!!|`|Yx0RT9Dzaa	definetly the Rangers.they have the best farm system in baseball with all the best prospects.when they start to win everyone is going to jump on the bandwagon, and im going to be pissed because i have been a fan through the worst times (cough cough A-rod 2001-2003).so you might as well get on now.|`|he3Od6owaa	Dodgers|`|H82AYTpsaa	phillies. even though they just won it they still arent anywhere near the hype as the yanks or the red sox|`|xRPjgGs1aa	I say he should be a Mets fan.|`|w21swqcFaa	Braves no doubt.<br>  <br>  :-))|`|NCqsnlClaa	<a href="http://clevelandicons.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://clevelandicons.blogspot.com/</a>|`|lPxlXEpLaa	If your willing to change your mind go with the Boston Red Sox. the fans are so into the game so it would make you a more intense fan because the game also gets more intense, Fenway Park is the best baseball park ever, they have a lot of all stars too such as Dustin Pedroia who ended the season with a .326 average with 17 home runs, 83 RBIs, and 20 stolen bases. He was tied for the MLB in hits with 213 and led the league in doubles (54), while leading the AL in runs scored (118), making him the first player to lead all three of those categories in the same season. They also have Big Papi, David Ortiz who puts so much heart into the game. in 2006 he hit 52 home runs. The Red Sox also have a great pitchers such as, Josh Beckett who had 20 wins in 2007, and Daisuke Matsuzaka ended the 2008 season with an 18-3 record and a 2.90 ERA. So this is I think you should consider changing your mind and root for the Boston Red Sox.|`|O8T0MMEgaa	Twins.<br>  <br>  Small market. Great fan base (like any fan base, a few bad apples.) But Minnesotans are known for being nice.<br>  <br>  Icons (well, IMO anyways): <br>  <br>  Walter Johnson (back when the Twins were the Senators), Harmon Killebrew, Rod Carew, Tony Oliva, Kent Hrbek, Bert Blylevin & of course, Kirby Puckett.<br>  <br>  Today we have a lot of promising young players in Joe Mauer (2x AL batting champ, 2x Silver Slugger, 2x All Star, GG winner) & Justin Morneau (2008 HR Derby winner, 2x All Star, 2x Silver Slugger, 2006 AL MVP). We also have a very young group of starting pitchers in Baker, Liriano, Slowey, Blackburn & Perkins, a lights out closer in Joe Nathan, and a ton of raw talent in players like Span, Gomez & Young.<br>  <br>  Oh, and we're getting a new stadium in 2010, if that matters.|`|pzgzUs2aaa	GO RED SOX!!

tjNLozsIaa	Here are 5 good baits my dad uses<br>  Arguably, no bait is more closely associated with catfishing than a chicken liver. The reason is simple: livers produce catfish and lots of them. With their strong, meaty smell, chicken livers draw cats from broad areas. Once the cats find the bait, they have trouble resisting them.<br>  <br>  DIP BAITS<br>  Some folks make their own dips from well-guarded secret recipes that have been passed from generation to generation. Others have favored commercially manufactured blends that they buy by the case. Whether home brewed or store bought, dip baits are gooey concoctions that usually smell horrible, but catfish absolutely cannot resist them.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  While all dip baits smell bad, a foul odor is not enough to make a tub of bait attractive to cats. A dip must have a cheese base or some kind of protein content. Dough balls, no matter how sour or smelly they are, do not offer much appeal to most cats. <br>  A bait's consistency also is critical. A good dip is soft enough that it breaks up gradually, but solid enough that it does not wash away quickly. In current, where dip baits are really at their best, that can be a delicate balance.<br>  Stringing a worm on a hook is the essence of fishing simplicity. In fact, it almost seems too simple. That said, night crawlers remain some of the finest baits available for coaxing catfish into biting. They smell natural, because they are natural, and they seem to taste mighty good to catfish.<br>  Generally speaking, the rule for night crawlers and catfish is, the bigger the better. Even small cats like big, juicy worms. It is generally a good idea to wad two or three on a hook if you only can find small or medium-sized worms. Unlike other species, catfish typically do not care how night crawlers are strung on the hook. They feed mostly by smell and taste, not by sight, so the more worm that is wrapped around and sewn onto the hook, the better your chances are of hooking cats that bite.<br>  Crawfish rank among the best baits of all for fishing in creeks and small rivers. You can either bounce live crawdads near the bottom in the current using split shot rigs or add a little heavier weight and fish crawfish tails right on the bottom. Dead crawfish produce mostly channel catfish. Live ones -- especially big craws -- also attract modest-sized flatheads. Anglers who specifically want flatheads should put baits close to the thickest cover they can find and be ready to pull with everything they have upon setting the hook.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Crawfish are not purely stream baits, though. They are important forage in many ponds, lakes and reservoirs and, therefore, make great catfish bait in waterways of all sizes. Fresh crawfish, whether dead or alive, work great for putting cats in the boat whether they are placed atop rocky points or humps on summer nights, or fished in the deeper open water along the edge of a grass bed.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  A live crawfish can be hooked through the base of the tail from the bottom up. Some anglers like to remove the pincers, but the cats probably do not care either way. Anglers using dead craws often pinch off the head and string the body on the hook, inserting it under the tail and impaling as much of the crawfish as possible. This kind of rig can spin in the water if there is any current, so adding a swivel between the weight and the hook is a good idea.<br>  <br>  RIGS<br>  <br>  PATERNOSTER RIG - Use in river with current or lake. Use for live bait. Similar to the float rig described above. I use a bullet shaped float and a bell sinker on a sliding dropper to keep the bait at the right depth and allow the cat to run a short way before setting the hook. The movement of a float keeps the bait lively. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  THREE-WAY RIG - Tie a heavy-duty three-way swivel to end of your braided line. To one ring tie a 24" leader and 6/0 to 8/0 hook. To the other tie a 12" lighter weight leader with a sinker. Use suitable size bell sinker in lakes and slower rivers or a pyramid sinker in faster current. The lighter leader on sinker is so you won't loose the fish in case of a hang up on the bottom. Use for dough, stink, cheese bait, and cut bait or live bait.<br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  BAIT WALKER OR BOTTOM BOUNCE RIG - Use in river with current and rough bottom. Especially good when you are drift fishing from a boat. The bait walker is an L-shaped wire with a weight that allows you to "walk" your bait along the bottom without hanging up. Tie your braided line to the ring at the elbow of the L and a 24" leader with 8/0 or 9/0 hook. Used when fishing live or cut bait. <br>   <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  FLOAT RIG - Use in river with current or lake. Use to drift live or cut bait past likely looking snags and undercuts. I use a bullet shaped float and a split shot dropper to keep the bait at the right depth. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  SLIP SINKER RIG - Use in rivers or lakes. Good for cheese, dough, or stink baits. Thread suitable size egg sinke|`|180035e5602039870639d3ffb09af7d0aa	save all your dinner scraps in a burlap sac for a month them sink it with a rope attached to a milk jug.let it sit for a few days then throw a trebble hook with three nightcrawlers down by it we call it a medussa ball.the cats will be there sucking on the bag. espessially at night|`|yAqhqxVQaa	i take a treble hook, put stink bait on it, then about a foot up i put a single hook on (u cant put a treble hook on it, it gets tangled up bad) on that single hook i put on some live bait or something similar. then i put a sinker up the line a ways. its works nice, cus u can get 2 baits out there, or u can add another single hook and get 3 ect...

And WHY would WWE make such a sick storyline?|`|5j81EoVXaa	are you dumb?<br>  he killed his family and then himself<br>  <br>  i hope you aren't trying to be funny because you aren't|`|GExKoh1Gaa	he is secretely hiding in the bahamas breaking coco nuts open with his headbuttt|`|vPpiHZSSaa	You're kidding? Wow where have you been in 2007. Psst....................................... wow like why did I get a thumbs down for this.|`|HaVPD1qfaa	he killed his fam then killed himself
AA11368324	No.  They have been to two (1982 & 1989) where, both times, they lost to the San Francisco 49ers.  They had their chances in both though (I remember watching both).  In the 1982 game, they had it first and goal on the 49ers 1 yard line, and they were stuffed four times.  Then, in 1989, Joe Montana did, "The Drive" in the final two minutes to pull the game out of the hat.  Both games were exciting, and the Bengals put up a great fight.  But, in the end, the 49ers were just a little better on both given days.|`|vPpiHZSSaa	Nope. They almost beat the 49ers but they F*cked up at the end like the Cardinals F*cked up against the steelers. To be honest, The Cardinals remind me of the Bengals because of how close they were to winning just like the Bengals.|`|XwXuJIF8aa	No but they came real close one year. Joe Montana beat them in the 4th quarter. They were a very good team in the earlier days. <br>  What happend to this frachise.They have just fallen apart in recent years.|`|BFrWduQMaa	Hell NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|fAMpwF3Aaa	Why don't you just try going to google?|`|t2hu5a5Qaa	No.|`|ymqWa8GNaa	No. But under Sam Wyche they had a phenomenal program.  If Joe Montana and the 49ers had not engineered "the drive" they would have. Sam Wyche was a great coach and leader
ZF4uKvFgaa	The only trick move i can do At the moment is banging it in the air is PRESS Y AND THEN PRESS FOWARD ON the right analog stick and it should work and to spin deke all you gotta do is press X...<br>  <br>  =) <br>  <br>  -Robert S|`|ll2y4YIGaa	Try asking the video game section, they may have a more educated answer.|`|a7AatQcEaa	i have a 360 also its awesome. Ps3 is crap. Anyway the moves are almost the same as nhl 09. The right stick can be used to shoot, go left and right, you can check , use the LB to poke check, u can do one on one dekes..etc. Get the nhl 09 demo on xbox live and you can go through the tutorial on all that stuff shooting and deking. GO BRUINS!!!!
C7A34HFMaa	The Premier League and local police don't like teams from the same city to have home games during the same weekend.<br>  <br>  So I think you'll have to give upon your dream.<br>  <br>  I know you don't want to go to a London game but you'll have a better chance of seeing the two Manchester teams if they play in London during the same weekend.|`|B7LyNQtBaa	Go to a Millwall,Fulham,Arsenal,Chelsea and West ham game!!!1|`|QuGTZJIVaa	That will rarely happen.  Manchester City and Utd have only ever played on the same weekend ONCE in the history of the two teams, and that was this season. It was due to a schedule build-up between league, UEFA Cup and CL matches all bunched together the Prmeier League officials had no choice.  The Police were in full force to keep the fans separated. It's the first time this has ever happened and not likely to happen again.<br>  <br>  When City play at home, United play away and vice versa. This is how it's always been, and always will be. This is to stop any trouble arising from the rivalry between the two sets of supporters.
QmUbe395aa	Tracy Mcgrady from the Orlando Magic and I'm not saying that just because I'm a Kobe fan and hate Lebron infact I like Lebron but Mcgrady from his Orlando Magic days was a beast|`|8f5b3518bbb478f324587b828536a78eaa	Tracy Mcgrady is an overrated player that takes too many shots. Maybe now that he's hurt the Rockets can improve as a team. More shots will be available for Louis Scola, Carl Landry, and Von Wafer. Lets' not forget that T-Mac is a 33% shooter just like Allen Iverson and Vince Carter.|`|4DcvpQXfaa	LeBron James|`|RB9Y8p8Yaa	Jon said it|`|zg1lIy7Oaa	T-Mac was very good at that time (he was 23 y/o then), but if you are going to compare him to LBJ, LeBron carried his team to the NBA Finals on that very same age. So I'll say that LeBron is a much better player and leader of a team than T-Mac.|`|sLSBROqUaa	lebron james hands down. he can be a threat on defense, on offense in the low post he can drive to the lane and contend with power forwards because of his size(6'8) 275 and he has a good polished jump shot|`|ISQAWUf2aa	you know what this question comes up everyday!!!!!<br>  <br>  the question is...WHO IS BETTER   <br>  <br>  that is put everyday and then they put players<br>  <br>  its annoying stop comparing!!!!!|`|W6jjsiMxaa	James.|`|5FypDafWaa	Lebron|`|yt4PN1R4aa	lebron|`|xRPjgGs1aa	LBJ can shoot from anywhere.|`|fc2LcdvVaa	James did you see him last night against Milwaukee?|`|IzUobRRkaa	LeBron. T-Mac is still very effective, but is hurt almost constantly. LeBron just has a freakish body, along with a freakish game. Yesterday he lit the bucks up by taking running, off balance 3 pointers. There's no comparison, T-Mac's best years don't even compare. Right now it's between LeBron and Kobe and I'd love to see that in a final's match up!|`|N5Cnuay0aa	T-mac, better scorer, can shoot unlike lebron.|`|BFrWduQMaa	T-Mac is still better, if you're looking for the best it's Kobe Bryant|`|6chLhNJhaa	Lebron. Tmac was alot better back then...but the lebron now is still better|`|OeFNGqbzaa	t-mac in his prime
Vjan4Vq2aa	Here's a link. It's kind of confusing, but it shows all the players: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany_national_football_team#Current_squad" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany_nat...</a>
cfmbN4pPaa	I'll be the first to say im a life long Sox fan but many teams including them have loaded up on talent that just doesnt mix. for that reason id have to say it even or over rated until proven they got the chemistry. CC couldnt get it done in the AL last year and has never gotten it done against the Sox. Burnett is a gamble due to being injury prone. so like most teams they got a lot of question marks this year.|`|KR1FdEZgaa	I DO NOT THINK THEY WILL WIN THE CHAMPIONSHIP. THAT MAKES THEM OVERRATED AND OVER PAID.|`|8Tef88NOaa	I would say the Tigers are the most overrated team in MLB.|`|l7IdlcHSaa	because the team only cares about drugs and money go mets|`|AA10252869	No I don't think so. The other teams could get better players if they would spend their money to do so.|`|gwUq6HMUaa	Yes they are.|`|FY17j1Ajaa	No, the most overrated team is the Pittsburgh Pirates. This is really a AAA team that is classified as a major league team. Can't overrate much more than that.|`|WaaFCtuOaa	The Yankees are hardly over-rated, well I can expect that from a Boston fan I guess. If a team who hasn't had a losing season since 1992, multiple division titles, 26 titles, in which I witnessed 6 of them(how many did you see the Sox win, 2) & Yankees never had to go 86 years between WS titles, if that is your definition of over-rated I guess you need a reality check.  You might want to check out some of the Boston's roster, they ain't exactly that young either. Are still still mad the Yankees got Texeira cause you sound kind of bitter. Go Yankees|`|liUG1m9Waa	this question has no value because of the biased asker.<br>  <br>  anyone who answers this question (including me for wasting my time) is a complete idiot|`|T8nap2Pnaa	compared to  the Red Sox who also lost out to Tampa Bay?|`|414b7351b200219e50b4bef935b60195aa	I don't think so. But everyone is entitled to their own opinion.|`|kfSuRisvaa	they are the worst run team in the world because they make so much money they blow it on players way past their prime the last time they won they had 2 superstars and a lot of role players the combo of washed up players with giant ego's will never work ask thy washington redskins how it works or the dallas cowboys or the new york knicks|`|XwXuJIF8aa	I say yes. Look at the past few years. They spend and have talent and cannot perform in the late season and post season. Very overrated. <br>  <br>  Look at the Phils and TB and other teams. Colorado. Yanks are really overrated.|`|ySFQ2TDWaa	No,  I dont think so. I reckon you think so since your a Red sox fan. If some team is overrated I'd go with the Tigers.|`|ad3M8wViaa	Or maybe your just a Red Sox fan who is scared of their potential this year?|`|ExlMB3N7aa	all that money and no rings since 2000<br>  Arod is a jinx|`|Fx2lB9LYaa	since 2001 yes|`|NCqsnlClaa	<a href="http://clevelandicons.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://clevelandicons.blogspot.com/</a>|`|ZVSZZ6qHaa	I don't think so but to each their own.
d1b38b13b953ba1dbaf4d9bcd50f9de4aa	Interpreting it as "not THE top car", then:<br>  <br>  Arnoux isn't a bad answer, but he did have the fastest car in 1982, which means that only 13 of his 18 poles actually count for "best of the rest" in my book. <br>  <br>  Senna is another possiblity, he had 16 poles for Lotus before joining McLaren, and another 2 with an uncompetitive car at McLaren, making 18.<br>  <br>  Piquet equals that, as only the last 6 of his 24 career poles came in the absolute best car. <br>  <br>  M.Schumacher is just short with 17 poles in inferior machinery.<br>  <br>  Clark had 13 of his 33 poles without the benefit of the best car.<br>  <br>  A tie between Senna and Piquet at 18. Not surprising, they were both great qualifiers whatever machinery they were given.<br>  <br>  Interpreting it as "not A top car", then there aren't many to go around:<br>  <br>  Stirling Moss set 4 poles for Lotus, when it wasn't the best car by a long way.<br>  <br>  The last three poles of Jack Brabham's career were all in a car which was off the pace, add his pole from 1961 and that makes 4 as well.<br>  <br>  Berger's four poles in his first stint at Ferrari were a big surprise at the time, add his 1997 pole and that takes him into the lead with 5.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT<br>  <br>  hi heads<br>  The only thing that Mansell ever did without the best car was show bravery and stupidity in equal measure. Only two of his poles came without either the best or close second-best car on the grid...one of those was due to having the best turbo engine at altitude at Kyalami, the other to being on the track at the right moment at Dallas! Maybe they should erase the 1992 season from the records, it gives a biased perception of Mansell's "talents" compared to other drivers who never got hold of an  FW14B...|`|3Db7KL0naa	.<br>  <br>  Ut-oh Schumi, love the guy, but you're in trouble now :)<br>  <br>  Edit: nice one Rosbif....Berger eh! Who'da thought?? Great on the brakes though!!<br>  <br>  You never mentioned Mansell, mate??<br>  <br>  Edit 2: Very true...my comment was an extension to my, hopefully smile inducing, comment above to Schumi and was also very tongue in cheeek. Although I must say, I was a fan of Mansell for is dogged determination to gain a seat in F1, his never-say-die attitude and his bravery as you rightly mentioned, both of which were tempered with a large Dollop (was that his middle name...it seems appropriate?) of stupidity, normally at a point that hinged on championship success, as you and he also slipped in!  :)<br>  <br>  .|`|jajmF5Uvaa	Nigel Mansell 1992 @ 88% poles in one season.<br>  Whether it's a "best of the rest car" is debatable. Was it the car or was it the driver?|`|KTxxd700aa	I'd say Rene Arnoux, had 18 but never in the best all round car, yes he had the fastest car on the grid in 1982 but never a championship winner. (Over a career)
9kfmdYXyaa	liverpool cannot afford to buy them unless a new owner comes in, ribery is a good player but schweinsteiger has been very average after wc 2006 but he is capable of putting a fine show once in a while...<br>  <br>  i would prefer bremen's diego though|`|dT3xJ9GWaa	no one of them ribery to barcelona and schweinsteiger to juventus|`|ph58F3Dqaa	yer i hope so!!!!!!!!|`|Vjan4Vq2aa	I think Schweinstiger could go to Liverpool, but Frank Ribery will probably go to a better team like Chelsea or Barcelona.
d2OLxA72aa	Totally agree: If you remember when he first came on the scene they had him wrestling Triple H, who at the time was the champ and Heel.<br>  Shelton Benjamin beat him five straight times, in singles and tag team matches, yet was not given a shot. They moved him to smackdown and I believe teamed him with Kurt Angle. Also he has been in every money in the bank match- Give the Man his Due.<br>  He is a Great Mat wrestler and Deserves a title shot.|`|NWtgYyF6aa	I agree.And he has pinned Triple H, Kurt Angle,Chris jericho and many others.He should be in the Money In The Bank this year even if it will be his 4th afterall he is the highlight real of it.Plus he needs to ditch the United States Championship he has had it for ages.Benjamin will break out in 2009|`|dPi7zMxWaa	Well right now he is kinda a jerk and he is having a fight with R-Truth at the moment.|`|aOCfLAJJaa	Dude, he NEEDS to LOOSE that title.|`|1z7M3Tntaa	I agree he deserves a shot, he's one fo the best wrestler's today and he'd be a better champion thna Edge in my opinion, sorry but Edge bores me. I know that with Shelton being champ he will always have great macthes who cares if he's not great on the mic.|`|bSsBGrZVaa	I am agree that Shelton Benjamin deserves a world title<br>  but i think that Mr. Kennedy is the most underrated he lost<br>  his mitb briefcase to Edge & never got a second chance since<br>  so i think that Kennedy deserves to win mitb of this year<br>  & get a world title because Shelton is already the current<br>  us champion thats it|`|VBfhoqS3aa	I could swear, hes never been number 1 contender to a world title yet in the WWE? lmao. Fire the creative team and|`|ywU3ZpIgaa	I agree he should have got a title shot a long time ago|`|dT3xJ9GWaa	i agree|`|35aa6dcf3de4ecb9aa30d3c58ec123edaa	I agree cause he was getting a huge push in 2004 beating guys like HHH i thought he was gonna be a main eventer but it turned out Vince had to screw him up by putting him in this so called Shelton's "Mama" storyline.<br>  <br>  He's a great athelete and like what you said he's long overdue for a World title run why can't they put the title on him instead of guys like HHH, Edge, Cena, Batista. Perhaps it's because he doesn't have any crowd reaction plus his mic skills are poor but i don't give a sh!t about his mic skills cause WWE is a wrestling show not a drama show so booking him to win this year's Money In The Bank match could help him get over with the crowd and in no time he will be big in the WWE.|`|w2nMrQzwaa	i agree, he is the best wrestler in the wwe, he has beaten some of the best in the wwe, he even beat HHH 5 times in one year. The only thing he lacks is Mic skills, i think he could do with a manager/mouthpiece to do most of the talking for him. I think he should be given a World title shot later in the year, after a feud with MVP for the US title.|`|1yOdrYiHaa	agree 100%<br>  Shelton Benjamin helped the wrestling business a lot he had many great matches especially the Money in the bank matches he was in , and as you said he is the most underrated wrestler in wwe comes second kane , wwe should stop giving Triple H , Edge(even though I Like him) titles and push the talent wrestlers who works so hard and deserves to be champion like shelton Benjamin|`|Z5bH2LOZaa	I totally agree with you. I don't know what he has done to earn a title shot. His problem may be that he is not that "over" with the fans. Maybe he should turn face and that amy help him.|`|GExKoh1Gaa	1-crappy mic skills<br>  2-crappy gimmick<br>  3-he does not sell<br>  <br>  yes he is a great technical wrestler..but WWE is not about technique only..guys like kurt angle were great..but could act and entertain..shelon is a sucker.|`|1WgOj89kaa	I agree, he is the best pure athlete in the WWE, yet he has never had a shot at any of the majjor titles. He thoroughly deserves a push|`|6UOCf94Jaa	I disagree. Shelton Benjamin is rubbish. John Cena or Jeff Hardy deserve a shot. :)|`|bLxPLVNJaa	i don't agree because jeff hardy has been there for a much longer time and look how long it took him to get a title shot or at least be number one contender
NQI4hgh3aa	Yes. <br>  U are sooo rightt!<br>  LOL|`|1yuUIN9Aaa	I'm pretty sure almost all of the players have beautiful wives, don't be jealous because you can't get girls.|`|FY17j1Ajaa	I do not know the sexual orientation of the Red Sox players. Nor of any other MLB team.|`|u1T5TQP7aa	thats your opinion pal|`|keXaF4Puaa	Did you want to join if they are|`|qivUrJ3Naa	I think your gay.  Yankees suck. GO SOX!|`|a7AatQcEaa	The Red Sox are NOT the gayest team their awesome. Boston is the city of champs. Yankees suck you want overrated try A-rod. How many yankee players have taken steroids?<br>  Celtics:17<br>  Bruins:5<br>  Red Sox:7<br>  Pats:3...total:42 yes the yankees have half that in baseball but when did they last win? and add their championships|`|WaaFCtuOaa	I don't know about the gayest team, but New York sports teams have more championships than the city Boston.  Yankees, Giants, who beat a Boston team, Mets, who beat a Boston team, Rangers, Islanders, so Boston is a city of champions yes, but not more than New York|`|AbDAdrXkaa	This is the reason why Red Sox fans talk smack about Yankees fans!! If you are a yankee fan stop posting these questions because they dont make nobody feel any better :)|`|OnPOj1e2aa	No! Have you seen the yankees?<br>  Plus the Red Sox are one of the most respected teams in the mlb!|`|u2Afg0IFaa	No not at all, because in the last 5 years they won 2 WS! Thats good!|`|ad3M8wViaa	No. But really don't do that cause it makes other Yankee fans look bad.|`|ZVSZZ6qHaa	Yes I think they are and so is the GM.|`|414b7351b200219e50b4bef935b60195aa	Not gay.<br>  <br>  Terrible is the right word.|`|GYnowHaUaa	most definetely  <br>  they have the worst loooking team <br>  all their players or overatted <br>  and they are in a city that also sucks complete ***<br>  <br>  go yankees|`|xkb35eSgaa	wow. what a stupid retarded question. im guessing your a jealous Yankees fan becuase you know the RedSox are better than the Yankees|`|W6Ewcz4jaa	Absolutely not! Have you seen the Yankees lately?
q0rDcTSRaa	I think they have a chance to considering how well they have been playing the last couple of games. No Garnett and No Stoudemire. Suns have a chance they are at home and they haven't forgot about what the Celtics did to them in Boston, Phoenix will be fired and ready for revenge. I don't expect the Suns to score 140pts against Boston but hopefully the Suns can win.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|AA10744471	Most probably yes. Without KG and Stoudemire, they cancel each other. But the Celtics are in a disadvantage with this set-up because of the big Shaq and (I agree with you) the new coach. I go with the Suns to win this one.|`|bda90fe4a3f3926b8f365b8127d043c2aa	You have to consider that they were playing 2 of the worst teams in the NBA, and the Celtics are a terrific defensive team<br>  <br>  Rondo will run circles around Nash, although Barbosa might make it interesting<br>  <br>  I think the Celtics will win, depending on who controls the tempo|`|qOgdJEMOaa	yeah I agree. the celtics are good, but the suns need hill to start at SF to stop paul pierce, and J-Rich will have to watch out for Ray-Ray on the perimeter. (We dont want another "Roger Mason" incident with J-Rich,,)|`|vtQNhe05aa	YES!!!!! They have a great chance they might not score 140+ but they have a shot let's hope Barbosa stays hot. GO SUNS!!!!
KTxxd700aa	An F1 driver looses 3kg of weight in a race due to the heat causing a loss of body fluids, its one hell of a calorie burn a grand prix!<br>  A drivers diet is set up to keep his weight as a constant, lots of eggs and pasta.<br>  If a driver looses weight during a season, he can be disqualified for being under weight, as the car has to weigh no less than 600kg, including driver.<br>  I'm 90% sure Tarso Marques was disqualified from the 1997 Austrian GP for losing too much weight!<br>  An F1 engine is 2400cc
Yslq4OYhaa	BJJ is not commonly recommended for multiple opponents.<br>  <br>  <br>  But I would dare to say that this person stands a better chance of survival with their BJJ than someone who has no training at all. Again, I do not recommend BJJ for multiple defense.  There may be some schools that teach multiple defense that train in BJJ. You would have to ask those types of questions to the instructors of those schools.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  <br>  For the guy that said they took JJ (Japanese Jujitsu) and didn't learn any strikes. You must have been in the wrong class, or didn't practice long enough or you weren't paying attention.|`|ieUgty5Faa	BJJ is great for a 1v1 situation. But you never go to the ground if there's more than one guy, or if you think another opponent might jump in.<br>  <br>  Stay on your feet, and keep your hands up. You're right, as soon as you go down, the others will stomp you out.<br>  <br>  For a multiple opponent scenario, the only thing you really need to know about BJJ is how to defend yourself and get back up on your feet.|`|gBO908P6aa	What you are basing this idea on is sport BJJ or BJJ in MMA which is a sport venue.  It has no true application in a real life scenario involving multiple attackers.  There's always a sport aspect and a street aspect to a style.  The mistake most people make is taking the sport and dojo aspect of BJJ into the street.<br>  In a multiple attack scenario, it is imperative that you be up on your feet and as mobile as possible.  Rolling around looking for submissions on one attacker is a quick way to get stomped on or knifed by the others.   If you are knocked down, you MUST get back on your feet as fast as possible.  Any style, that reduces such mobility would not be practical in a mass attack situation.  That being said, the BJJ practitioner's most ideal defense in such a situation would be to keep moving and keep it standing, perhaps tying one person up with a lock or a choke and either blocking the others from getting to him.  Or perhaps tying up and throwing one into another and getting away.  Throws and sweeps, such as those in judo, are certainly not out of the question.  Keep in mind also that BJJ is a street-oriented grappling style and so striking in BJJ is certainly not out of the question.   Knees, elbows, headbutts.  Anything that will buy enough time for the BJJer to delay and regroup.  But the most important thing is he MUST remain as mobile as possible.|`|NJMzhcKhaa	Pure BJJ practitioner won't stand a chance against 2 attackers, let alone 4.<br>  BJJ training focus a lot on the ground submission, and the training to fight against multiple opponents are very basic in BJJ<br>  <br>  That's where the need to train in more than one martial arts come into the real aspect of Mixed Martial art.<br>  Train in BJJ, but complement it with something else. Either karate or boxing or muay thai, or escrima/silat if you want to complement your training with weapon training (stick/knife)<br>  <br>  Judo actually has much more practical application for self-defence toward multiple opponent, but Judo has much less focus on the submission side and more focus on the throws.<br>  <br>  <br>  And for James E, actually I've seen with my own eyes a brown belt kyokushin karateka dispatching two attackers.|`|13360f8150c9715c66a1ecb9c2002c6aaa	Simple equation<br>  Any striking art that doesn't practice some grappling is a limited art<br>  Any grappling art that doesn't practice striking is a limited art<br>  Both are designed to fight people the way they fight in the sport arena and to many people base the efficiency of an art by sports outcomes.<br>  <br>  Let's face it if someone is determined to do you serious harm even kill you they will find a way to do it.Don't believe me?Ask the guys who protect the president.|`|Y26eOD9Caa	Every art has it's weak points.  BJJ comes up short on the subject of multiple attackers.  The good thing is, a BJJ guy will usually have a good knowledge of the clinch i.e. how to escape the clinch, disengage and stay mobile.  By all means, take up BJJ.  Anyone with an interest in self defense should know how survive being taken to the ground, or how to stay off the ground altogether, especially against multiple assailants.  And if you already have some fundamental boxing, you are well prepared for the average low to mid-level street or bar scrap that a lot of young men tend to find themselves in. <br>  <br>  P.S. I emphasise the clinch because it's a more common method of takedown in a street or bar fight.  I have rarely seen someone shoot for a double on the concrete.  A big guy will just fall on you and use his body weight.  A strong guy might grab you and slam you, someone fairly quick and athletic might go for a common "football" tackle.  But anything can happen, and you should mentally prepare for anything.|`|c4d3e30573f7765b16b9bbddef2168d6aa	that's actually the major argument against BJJ.  going to the ground is a bad idea for a street fight, and you always want to stay mobile.  If you really want to learn ground of self defense try a old school judo or JJ.  that's where BJJ can trace their origins and judo and JJ will concentrate on keeping you standing. (they will cover ground work at the same time)|`|YN93QRdyaa	Well in general multiple opponent scenarios are not to be taken lightly. I've seen videos of boxers fighting off many opponents but in all of them the opponents seemed to get discouraged pretty quickly once they got hit and didn't attack with conviction. Ultimately if you are outnumbered by determined opponents and can't run away then you are in trouble. In general, if you are expecting to get in trouble try and make sure you have friends along too.<br>  <br>  With that said, most BJJ practitioners I know are aware of the limitations of the style, and that it is most effective as part of a well-rounded skillset covering standup, clinch and ground; hence they all either cross-train in Muay Thai/wrestling/boxing/whatever or train purely for BJJ competition. Obviously pulling guard and looking for a triangle when your opponent has friends around is a bad idea, but so is trying to infight like a boxer might; you'll be mobbed and overwhelmed. So I personally think that striking and moving, not getting tied up with opponents and trying to get away is the best strategy.<br>  <br>  However BJJ can teach plently of useful stuff for such situations, most notably if one of your opponents puts you on the ground (whether deliberately or accidentally) BJJ will give you the tools to work back to your feet. This is probably the most important aspect of ground fighting one can learn for self-defense. Also, BJJ will teach you to control or break the clinch, and to maintain your balance and avoid takedowns, which ties into what I said above about staying mobile.<br>  <br>  So in short, what you learn in BJJ is primarily ground fighting, and ground fighting should not be your primary strategy in a self-defense situation. HOWEVER the choice will not always be yours to make, and if you find yourself on the ground in a street fight (whether by misadventure or deliberately taken down by your opponent) the skills learned in BJJ will help you escape and get back to your feet with hopefully little damage suffered. This I think is the biggest value of BJJ for self-defense.|`|ZmfAIAqSaa	I don't really know an answer to this but I would recommend watching the movie Red Belt, it was released last year and should be out on DVD in the US by now. Fighting is quite real and no special effects have been added. I think there is a scene where the main character takes on more than 1 opponent. But that's only a movie. <br>  <br>  I've taken up JJ once and to be honest I haven't really learned to punch in it, so taking up more than one opponent would require you to punch and JJ is strictly about grappling and taking your opponent to the ground, I doubt BJJ is any different for that matter. NinJutsu on the other hand has punches and the grappling is just like in JJ, but you also learn the use of a ninja sword, but i don't think you wanna do that.|`|f1f7IQIKaa	What your saying has been said 7136548173418416328215364583524527354126... your not original attacking this art the way you have. It is only good against 1 v 1,but really,lets  be really  real here. If it was  2 v 1,and you knew some standup,I dont think you could do any better. 2 people vs 1. Ok people. We only have 2 arms and 2 Legs. Ok?  stfu about this hating on BJJ,and go kill a BJJ brown belt with your bare hands.  Then come back and tell me how un effective it is.<br>  <br>  Fair. But a Kyokushine  will lose to a BJJ blackbelt. easily. so It doesnt say much for the art.

AA10241450	I would try to get a personal coach or try to workout with a running club.  Also keep in shape by buying a heart monitor and running various 5K and 10K races.  Your should incorporate a program for quickness and endurance since your be running XC in college.  Try running aerobic miles and on your hard days run intervals.  <br>  <br>  Run 200 meters X 12 at your 400 meter pace with 200 meter walks in between runs.  <br>  <br>  Run 400 meters X 8 at mile race pace with rests to 120 heart beats<br>  <br>  Run 1 mile X 4 at 5K pace with 30 second walk rests<br>  <br>  Run 2 mile x 3 at 10K pace with 30 second rests<br>  <br>  Do at least 2 of these intervals a week and run at a constant velocity throughout the whole run.  Try running in a group since it's easier and draft off the runners ahead of you.  It's better to practice these runs on a XC course especially the mile and 2 mile intervals.  Later add hills, fartleks or speedplay drills and do resistance weight lifting for strength and to cut down on injuries.  Good luck with running solo.|`|CI5qOBcDaa	well if you want a D1 or D2 school, then not a chance at all. If your going to a D3 it really depends on the school, you might be able to get away with it but being on a high school team will help. And why can't you stand them, the people? cause if its something you like to do that shouldn't get in the way. All you do in practices is sprint/distance workouts and you don't have to do them with the other people on the team, or interact with them. And why not compete? You might have a chance at placing at meets.|`|JACNzg0vaa	im anxious person, i sleep bad....so i went to an independent<br>  license, decided to forget the clubs...im not a pro right?<br>  so have to read and read and learn how to do the workouts<br>  according to your injuries, hear your body!!
El7C2JsMaa	like someone else has said its very hard to compare squads from different era's because of the way the game has changed over the years with fitness levels improving also with the introduction of subs for the first few seasons when subs were first introduced each team was only allowed 1 sub and that was only to be used to replace an injured player and for that reason alone its impossible to compare Man United's current squad with that of Celtic's because of the fact nowadays you can have up to 7 players on the bench!<br>  <br>  There's is no doubting that this is one of the strongest squads there has been in a while not necessarily filled with the best players but the most depth and the fact that if one player goes out there is someone who can adequately replace him.<br>  <br>  In terms of if we will win the quadruple then i think it is a big ask as i have said many times Cup competitions require a certain amount of luck as well as talent but with the big squad that we have and if Sir Alex can utilise them well and if we are lucky with injuries then we have a good chance, the league i feel pretty confident about, yes we could still lose it and i'm not so confident that i will say it's definitely ours but we are looking strong and the point is now it is completely in our hands, it is ours to lose and another big factor is Chelsea and Liverpool haven't been at their best which is making it that much more likely.<br>  <br>  I don't think you can play down the clean sheets, as the old saying goes you can only beat what is put in front of you and if it was that easy to keep clean sheets against these teams then surely everyone should be doing it and these teams would hardly ever score.<br>  <br>  So like i said its hard to say whether its the best ever, but what i am certain of is Sir Alex is using it to his advantage and is getting the best out of it!|`|AA12370193	maybe, i dont know sorry|`|cf4d6d60fab75efc136a4d66dd5c03b4aa	What about Brazil 02, I know there might be better ever but I saw that only, Holland, AC Milan, even Spurs had great runs in history, this squad has a big depth and good quality, I am not satisfied with midfield, that again when in contention with the tag of best ever, the defense is good, best ever, again left wing? <br>  We may win the Quintiple and posses a strong  squad, we are good, in terms of winning,Beautiful play i think we will have some contenders .|`|tIBZ9Gi3aa	We can't really compare,since every squad has played in different eras and different teams.<br>  <br>  I personally believe this is probably the best ever squad to play.We can grind out performances when things don't go our way.We can destroy teams.We can play both beautiful and effective football.Every player in the team can win a match by themselves,and in case things don't go well,we have enough in reserves to replace the first-team players.We have strength in depth,and almost all our players perform well consistently.We have a great mixture of experienced and young players,and a greater balance between attack and defence.We can dismantle any team on our day,and we can dig deep enough to neutralise any team if things aren't going our way.We've won the Club World Cup,and can happily call ourselves the World Champions.We're leading in the Premiership,in the finals of the Carling Cup,and still in contention for the FA Cup and Champions League.It's still early stages in the latter 2 competitions,and to be honest I'm not buying any of that Quintuplet talk,but if we do win the next 4 competitions,I can safely say this is the best squad ever.|`|StqBr5XRaa	SORRY I DON'T KNOW|`|NHt8Hnc9aa	I think Manchester United are very good currently, but I don't know about the greatest off all time. I agree with the statistic you have put down and think Manchester United have alot of pressure on them. I think they will win some trophies this season, but I don't think they will do the quadruple. I think they will win the Carling Cup, and the F.A Cup, because I think in one-off matches, they can beat almost any team, but I don't think they will win the Premier League and Champions League because I think because they are in the Premier League, Champions League, F.A Cup and Carling Cup, they will have a very congested calander this season, and I think they will find it hard to win the quadruple. I think Liverpool will win the Premier League because they have been knocked out of the F.A Cup and Carling Cup, so I think they will have less matches, so I think they will be able to rest their players more. i agree with the statistic you have put down about Manchester United dropping points in the Premier League. I think Manchester United will drop points in the Premier League, and I think Liverpool will win the Premier League. I think Manchester United have done well to keep the amount of clean sheets they have in a row in the Premier League so far, but I do agree with the statistic you have put down about playing quite easy teams in the Premier League lately, so that made have made it easier for them to keep clean sheets. I agree with the statistic you have put down about the most crucial phase of the season coming up, with the Champions League resuming and I think Manchester United's claender will be very congested because they are still in the Premier League, Champions League, F.A Cup and Carling Cup. I also think that Manchster United's matches against Liverpool and Arsenal will be very difficult, and I think Liverpool and Arsenal are both capable of winning Manchester United. I also agree with the statistic you have put down about Manchester United having high expectations. I don't think I knew about Celtic doing the quadruple until I read this question, and I think they have done very well to achieve that. I don't think Manchester United will get the quadruple this season, because I think they have lots of pressure on them and I think Manchester United have a congested calender this season, because they are still in the Premier League, Champions League, F.A Cup and Carling Cup.|`|IWM1khX7aa	Arsenal of 2003-2004. <br>  <br>  Arsenal went UNDEFEATED in Premier League. They're the only team to do that. They didn't win the UCL that year. So what? It's the greatest Premiership team ever, not the greatest team ever. <br>  <br>  Man U 2009 <br>  GK Van der Sar- Has not let in a goal in Premier League since Nov '08<br>  Defense: Vidic, Ferdinand and Evra are amazing, and Rafael has been a good right back<br>  Midfield: Ronaldo is not like his is in 2008, but the midfield has been pretty much the same as last season. <br>  Strikers: Berbatov is a waste of money, Rooney just sucks and Tevez wants to leave.<br>  Manager: Alex Ferguson. Good but lucky.<br>  <br>  Arsenal 2003-2004<br>  GK: Jens Lehmann played every game of the season and he never lost.<br>  Defense: Sol Campbell was very good and Ashley Cole started to become good.<br>  Midfield: Amazing: Freddie Ljunberg was a great right winger, Patrick Vieira was truly amazing as captain, Gilberto Silva was amazing too, and Robert Pires had one of his best seasons at Arsenal in 2003-2004.<br>  Strikers: Thierry Henry, the best player in the world at that time with 30 goals to his name in the Premiership. Dennis Bergkamp was out of his prime, but he was decent.<br>  Manager: Arsene Wegner was good but a little unlucky.<br>  <br>  Man U is good, but not close to Arsenal 2003-2004<br>  <br>  Also, Chelsea was a good team in 2004-2005.  They earned the most points (95) and only lost once.|`|JCRdicqXaa	Currently I think Manchester United are underperforming. But then even more so is the rest of the League if they allow United to be leaders.<br>  The general level of football quality does not match that of the '99 era when Manchester United won the Treble.<br>  Therefore I nominate the class of '99 to be the finest.|`|bGuVAltxaa	Good question, this squad has the potential to be the greatest ever but as you said they haven't won anything yet, they will be hard pushed to win the quadruple but with the quality they have, it is a possibility. The 14 clean sheets in a row is a superb record, it doesn't matter what opposition you come up against, every premier league game is a hard battle and United have been brilliant this season, yes we have still to play Liverpool and Arsenal this season but those two teams always look like they will drop points while United look very solid. Nobody knows what will happen in the last months of the season, but for me United's strength will see them through.|`|htQX8Ywgaa	As much as this disappoints me, I'm the most sure I've ever been that United will win the league, they just seem unstoppable at the moment, without having the best players in the league. Unless someone like Ronaldo or Vidic gets injured I can't see it going any other way than United winning the league comfortably.|`|mUMMLjDdaa	i have to say no, united is not the greatest of all time. as you sharply,<br>  and intelligently point out they only had to face a credible team and<br>  or opposition one time. that in itself shows they are by no means the<br>  greatest of all time.|`|quYLRIrgaa	The article does actually just pick out Utd as being the best SQUAD (as opposed to team) ever in the PREMIER League (i.e. in England since '92)<br>  But i will pick out;<br>  "Of the last 14 matches which United have gone clean sheet, only in 1 game they faced credible opposititon."<br>  You're basically saying more than half the premiership isn't credible (in which case how come the other sides don't do the same as Utd).<br>  I guess most teams would consider top 6 sides, Villa (away) and Everton (home) as 'easy meat'.|`|duIk8BFwaa	Man U has the potential but I don't agree with you about having easy opponents every game in the EPL is a challenge just look at Hull City they beat some very good team like Arsenal and more that I forgot.<br>  Man U can do win the quadruple but the team has got to stay health so Rooney,Ronaldo,Tevez,and Berbatov have to stay health including the rest of the starters|`|L1QTSErIaa	If you talking about the greatest ever squad in Man United's history, yes they are. If even Wenger acknowledges them as the untouchables, we have to agree. The great Sir Alex claims this squad is the best ever. No one can disclaim that. I saw them play Fulham and they were simply a class above the rest. Fulham didn't know what hit them. It was bang bang from the start. <br>  <br>  But the greatest ever squad in the EPL  cannot be attributed to any Man United team. That accolade should be shared between Chelsea of 2004-05 season who claimed the record of 95 points, scored 72 goals and conceeded just 15. And lost only 1 game the whole season. <br>  And Arsenal of 2003-04 season. They went the whole season unbeaten which is still a record. And they did it in style playing some exquisite football.|`|FFE9Qztzaa	Very Good Question !<br>  <br>  And well, I'm going to start of saying that.. It's quite difficult to compare squads (as "oshea" stated above ^^ ) for those same reasons he said. The players and the way the squad connects, and their own style of performance.<br>  <br>  Nonetheless, I do believe that Man Utd have proven to have that stong potential, and stook to being consistent this season. But i'm just speaking for this season. We musnt of course not forget other strong squads in the past year from other clubs.<br>  <br>   (1. ) Arsenal 03/04 :: Unbeaten season, difficult to accomplish I must say.Proved their capabilities,and played the football as it was supposed to be played. Henry, one of his finest performances.<br>  <br>  (2.) As Joshjo ^^ pointed out, Chelsea 04/05. Impressive season, racking up 95 pts that season, 29 wins and only one loss.Therefore, taking the premiership home.<br>  <br>  Which brings me to the next point, Manchester United have not won ANYTHING (..just yet ) this season. Unless they are able to pull a treble or quadruple,  then I cant really say much..until I see some sort of cup in their hands. So far, i've only been impressed by two things::<br>  <br>  (1) Their clean-sheet record<br>  and <br>  (2)  They're much so solid defense.<br>  <br>  These qualities can take them far. But Utd cannot sing victory just yet. Its almost the closing of the season and ANYTHING can happen. That is how the world of football works!. They face very tough opponents left, If you really come to think about it. <br>  <br>  In conclusion, I wouldn't agree with the article. When indeed other clubs have been discredited. Unless I see 3 or 4 cups in their hands, then I would not say "they're the best squad ever"  just yet.<br>  <br>  :-)

CttL3LmBaa	If it is a hard tail mountain bike, lock out the front fork.  As suggested, buy some narrower, smoother tread (even slicks), and higher pressure tires than what you have now.  The tires will lessen the rolling resistance over MTB tires.  That will help make it roll easier making each pedal effort move the bike further.   Keeping the front fork locked out will put your pedaling motion into thrust not bounce.<br>  <br>  Ride a lot this year and get fit.  Have fun.|`|Z5xgSATSaa	A long ride like this would be much easier on some kind of road bike. Even with modifications to make it more efficient, your mountain bike is not well suited to long distance tours. In order to get fit enough to do this ride, you will have to spend some serious training time  on the road and a comfortable road bike would be a good investment. Road bikes are lighter and more responsive, and the drop style handlebars they come with give you several hand positions to allow you to change your posture during long rides. They also allow you more efficient positions when you have to ride into a headwind. Lighter wheels and narrower tires roll with less resistance. You don't have to buy a road racing bike, there are road bikes designed for exactly the type of ride you propose to do.|`|CA7lEkYIaa	mountain bikes take alot more effort and strain then a road bike or hybrid but if you love your mountain bike and are wanting to use it i would suggest changing the tyres to some 26 x 1.75 it will make your journey alot easyer hope this helps?.

AA11694178	"Gun" is a generic term that refers to any device that fires a projectile.  Most often the projectile is fired by an internal combustion of some material such as gun powder.  A rifle is a specific kind of weapon.  It is characterized by having spiral grooves in the bore from which it gets its name.  The grooves are called rifling.  Originally, firearms had smooth bores the same as today's shotguns.  It was discovered that if you put spiral grooves inside the bore they would impart a stabilizing spin to the projectile and greatly improve the accuracy of the weapon.  When guns began to be produced with this rifling in the bore, they were called "rifle guns" to distinguish them from from the smoothbore guns.  As time went by and more and more guns were made with this rifling in the bore, the designation was shortened to "rifle".  Today, it customary to refer only to long guns as rifles even though handguns also have rifling in the bores.|`|Y4RS35M7aa	In the US military, if you call a weapon a 'gun,' you get to do a punishment tour screaming "This is my rifle (hold out rifle) and this is my gun (grab penis).

aYVPZjLVaa	the knee is hard to protect because injuries come from twisting and bending so they can't do much about that.<br>  <br>  The thing about helmets is that once you put helmets on you know have a big weapon. A helmet to another part of the body could cause some pretty bad injuries. In addition to that the way in which american football is played (the way they take contact) is vastly different from rugby. I'm a rugby player so I am in no way insisting rugby hits aren't hard but a football hit (ignoring distribution by padding) is harder so pads become necessary. Also the number of blindsided blocks makes padding fairly necessary. And anyway, now that they have designed their techniques around padding it'd be nearly impossible to take it out of the game without killing a couple hundred football players who took contact the wrong way.<br>  Basically trying to say that not only could you not play with only a helmet, but the padding is also made necessary by the nature and rules of the game (hit legality and blocking).<br>  <br>  Don't know enough about either baseball (which I don't like) or cricket (which I've only seen a few highlights of) to answer that part of your question. But could it have to do with speed of the ball and material maybe? Just a guess.|`|AA11881071	Its called lawyer phobia...<br>  <br>  Sue , sue , Sue|`|WpqwaqcQaa	Americans drink less alcohol b4 events so they're more likely to be injured and or feel more pain.<br>  <br>  the exception would be most college rugby teams.|`|hmsCFQocaa	If you're defending cauliflower ears, broken teeth, knee damage and even worse injuries, I still side on the side of safety.
lHzBJA4eaa	There is a maximum amount of money each team is allowed to spend on players . Sometimes players want too much and it's not in the teams budget because of the Salary Cap.|`|XQoH9ZI5aa	A cap hit is the amount of money from a players salary which will count towards the salary cap maximum. <br>  <br>   For instance....the Montreal Canadiens just traded for Mathieu Schneider....his cap hit for the year is 5.625 Million dollars.......it is divided out over the length of the season (186 days) BUT Montreal just obtained him so they will only pay him for 56 days that remain of that 186 days........so Montreal's "cap hit" works out to 1.694 Million.<br>  <br>   'Cap Number' multiplied by 'Total Days' divided by the maximum Total Days.|`|6bec1b1d615ba504dd8ddd905700f371aa	Each NHL team is only allowed to spend a certain amount of money on players salaries, it's called a Salary Cap.  It's designed to close the gap between the "haves" and have-not's" by creating what's called "parity" in the league.  When a team picks up a player that causes that team's total salary amount to rise closer to the teams capacity, they call it a "cap hit."  <br>  <br>  Similarly, when a team dumps some salary they call it making some "cap space"<br>  <br>  This is relatively new to the NHL and the players were locked out for an entire season so the league owners could bring it in.  The players, did not want this.  NBA and NFL also have salary caps, Major league Baseball does not, which is why teams like New York, Boston, and LA can spend such outrageous amounts on thier players.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|uqFlaBMkaa	It is not a hit cap it is a salary cap. This is the amount of money each team can spend on signings.

If your goal is just to finish it, there's really no need to run 5 days a week. 3 days a week running for 40 minutes or so each day will get you through a 5k easily. <br>  <br>  However, if you want to place or get a good 5k time, you should run 5 days a week.<br>  <br>  Day 1: Do a hill workout. Find a good-sized hill and do 4 repeats, running up hard and running down as your recovery.<br>  Day 2: Recovery Day: Run at an easy pace for 30 to 40 minutes.<br>  Day 3: Interval training: Preferably on a track of some sort, run intervals of 400's and 800's. Take a lap of recovery between each interval.<br>  Day 4: Recovery Day: easy 30-40 minute run<br>  Day 5: Long Run: run up to 1 1/2 hours, maybe on a trail somewhere - running doesn't seem as hard on trails and especially not with friends.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!
ZN3PnF6Zaa	A common misconception in paintball is that only certain guns are good for woodsball. Not true. In any case, there are several guns you could go with. One would be the Dangerous Power G3. It runs about $300 on Zephyrpaintball.com and works better than anything your friends will probably be carrying. Super light, and has one of the best ASA's on the market. The fact that it's $300 will lower the price you have left to spend on a loader and a tank though, but, if you are willing to spend about $30-$50 more, go with the G3, a Halo, and just a regular Pure Energy 48/3000 HPA tank. The next choice would be an 08 Proto SLG, about $200 on Zephyrpaintball.com and a great gun. Not as flashy as some of the newer guns, but works just as well. Light, fast, accurate. Not nearly as good as the G3, but $100 cheaper, and gives you the extra spending money for the Halo and the tank. My personal recommendation, wait for a bit, get some more money, and go with the G3. If you just can't wait, go with the SLG. <br>  <br>  Like I said before, it doesn't matter what you use for woodsball. The guns I gave you will probably be shooting way faster than anything your friends will have. And theyll be a lot lighter. <br>  <br>  My 2 favorite sites:<br>  www.zephypaintball.com<br>  www.actionvillage.com|`|RuJYupFWaa	actionvillage.com has some good packages.

NG6eeCfuaa	To "bunt" the ball is to "deaden" the ball with your bat. You basically take all the speed off of the pitched ball and the ball essentially drops straight down (it might roll somewhat depending on the quality of the bunt).

YsSwe1Laaa	I'll assume you mean rugby union (not League) - as an American you will find almost no League played in the States, but plenty of Union.<br>  <br>  The easiest transition for you would be to blind-side flanker.  If that works well and you develop some command of the game and its tactics, it may be that your best use to the team would be at No. 8.  Liam Messam (Waikato/Chiefs/ABs) is a good example of a bloke who moves back and forth between 6 and 8.  Other fellows find that it is natural to move back and forth between No 6 and lock-forward (Sebastien Chabal of Sale/FRA is a current example), dpending on what helps their club the most.<br>  <br>  The biggest matter for you to attend to first is training.  Your foot speed to 40 m sounds adequate, but your stamina almost surely needs work.  As a forward (at college or sr. men's club level in the States) you will run 8-10 km every game, which is 2 x 40-minute halves, with almost no stoppages.  This is VERY different from gridiron.  Probably 60-70% of all rugby games are decided in the final 20 minutes, and the team that can still execute skillfully in the final 20 minutes will almost always triumph.   That means the fitter team.  Your training regime needs to mix distance training (out of season, I'd have loose forwards doing one 5km and one 10 km run each week) for general stamina with intervals (of different lengths and repetitions) for intermediate stamina and also speed.<br>  <br>  A good training regime plus sensible nutrition, and you probably will see your weight at something more like 210 (over say 6-8 months).  This will improve your speed sand stamina, allow you better jumping in lineouts, and improve your quickness at getting up from the deck to your feet (a critical ability for a loose forward trying to convert tackles to ball possession.)    <br>  <br>  Good luck.  It's more fun than a barrel full of monkeys.<br>  <br>  Mark L|`|dRIvxbpOaa	Hooker.|`|qqRZVKXYaa	Either 8-man or center. You're probably too slow for winger (need to be sub 4.8 at the very least). If you can kick consider being a fullback. I played O-Line myself, and if you like to have your nose in the game, I'd stick with those two positions.|`|iDfJYYpXaa	HOCKER  would be a good position, you would play a large part in the game.  your speed and size would help within rucks and mauls.  have fun in what ever position you play.|`|7Qrry4bDaa	you seem pretty fast which means you could be winger<br>  <br>  pick one of these skills and the position you should play<br>  <br>  speed and hands=center<br>  <br>  speed and tackle=fullback<br>  <br>  speed and strength=flanker/wing forward|`|2BWrVf4Raa	You should be a winger cos you've got speed and size and I wouldn't want to have to tackle you|`|cHQqNWRbaa	You have size, speed and youth lucky you .<br>  What I recommend is you develop your basic skills passing catching tackling especially the defensive side of the game as grass cutting will just get you a early shower.<br>  The 2 games I believe you should get into to help you adapt to the ways of the game are rugby league and touch or flag rugby.<br>  Rugby league is a very simple game if you can run pass catch and tackle then that's rugby league in a nutshell and that game teaches those fundamentals really well.<br>  Touch or flag takes those skills minus the tackling and gives you a game that is very fast a lot of fun and high on repetition and as you get to understand the game you improve your skills.<br>  Don't worry about what position suits you, up your skills and knowledge of the game and you will know where you will want to play.<br>  You have size and speed but you might have a bloody good footy brain as well which will be a waste on the wing.<br>  I don't recommend rugby union as it is a very technical game and because of your genes you could end up in a position you don't like or not excel in as they will tell you what position suits you and that would be a waste.|`|K4rP4A0naa	It seems these people assume you mean rugby union not league but since you said league, you're best suited to being a centre or second rower. <br>  <br>  A centre uses strength and speed to break the line and set up tries and does a moderate amount of tackling. <br>  <br>  A second rower's job is to make forward progress and set up line breaks and do a lot of tackling. <br>  <br>  A winger needs pace to finish off attacking moves etc. but doesn't make many tackles. <br>  <br>  You have the stats to be any of those but more likely the first two positions.<br>  <br>  If you actually mean rugby union I wasted my time LOL|`|y61zB9Xcaa	no 8. you're big and have got pace so has to be 8. You could also play in the backs, but more technical skills are required there so you could probably only play on the wing as there isn't much passing involved.<br>  <br>  good luck, whatever team you play for is going to be very lucky!<br>  btw watching rugby is the best way to learn|`|DHMqxtM9aa	the best thing to do is play a bit you will soon figure out which position is right for you and hopfully you will have a coach who will try you in differant positions till you find the right one for you best of luck mate rugby is a great game on & off the field|`|O3eqKV90aa	I would suggest Centre or backrower (lock or second row).

I broke my collar bone and tore my ACL. The latter of which effectively ended my "career". I wouldn't trade the experience for anything. Injuries do happen and there is a risk to anyone who plays. It is also risky driving a car, riding in an elevator or flying on a plane. <br>  <br>  The discipline and structure introduced by playing football is worth the risk.|`|ymqWa8GNaa	No. Only you can do that.  Football is the greatest team sport. The lessons learned are of lifelong benefit.  His coaches will teach him how to make contact, and that hitting harder than the other guy is the best way to avoid injury.  Could he get injured?  Yes.  But is teaching him to take the safest course in life going to lead to a life of "thriving", or simply "existing"?  We are not put here to exist. Let the horses run... it's exhilirating... it's life!|`|EtH1r7wEaa	As a mom myself i say let him play, injury don't happen as often as you think, if they have a good coach they will be ready to play with the right conditioning , he will be fine, i had two boys that both played football, they loved it and so did i, and to be honest the only injury's they ever had, they didn't get from football,|`|g7w7hjHzaa	they do train them to be stronger and gain muscle to play. they aso wear the helmets and shoulder padding and such. don't worry if he's so big and rough..they need kids like that on the team. also, injuries such as those are considered rare. don't worry! he'll  most likely be fine!|`|ySFQ2TDWaa	Actually you dont read much about those kinda injuries, they are very rare.|`|aYVPZjLVaa	These injuries are very rare. As for other bad injuries (of lesser magnitude) they can be overcome. If he gets injured he just needs it taken care of (ie see a doctor) and then to rehab it correctly by doing exercises to fix it. But the worst he'll likely sustain is a badly sprained ankle. Let the kid play, you can reevaluate if he does get hurt badly. Just remember to take his wants and needs into account (not be ruled by them but certainly strongly consider them).|`|F7CiebFzaa	I think you should let him play. I think this because if you have avoided football all these years then it must be something totally new to him. Kids and teenagers always want to try something new and if this is what your son wants then why not right. Now, I realize you are scared of him getting hurt but, the serious injuries like you have mentioned only usually happen in the CFL or NFL, but High school football very rare and I bet that if your son gets hurt he will end up fine. Look your son probably won't get hurt, but let's say he gets slightly hurt you have the authority to stop him from playing.|`|O1T29e95aa	The injuries you speak of are very rare at the high school level.  I have played football for 7 years now, just recently coming off of my senior year.  In those 7 years my worst and only injury has been a separated shoulder which healed fine.  Also as someone said earlier it is one of the best sports for teaching life long lessons.  I know I am a little bias because I play and love the sport, but I think you should let him play.|`|1Weqg1G8aa	Mam I'm sure your son will be fine if he's the one who likes being rough he'll be able to take a hit and be ontop of that pile. As long as he learns the fundamentals and uses them he will be fine. Football is a great sport and it will teach him teamwork, companionship, confidence, and discipline. All of those are great things to have when growing up in life.|`|t2hu5a5Qaa	Maybe you can have him in one game and u don't like it. You can pull him out.|`|GAwpJ9ZWaa	those are mostly rare and NFL

fdf78d43fe1121f9be25f88e4fef9e3baa	Most efficient AND most economical? Well, either way you'll have to compromise, but if it were me making the choice and I was actually using the bike on cross country trails- IN THE MOUNTAINS- I'd opt for SRAM X7 or Shimano SLX. The X5 shifters are a bit flaky in my opinion.<br>  <br>  If I were building a bike for occasional jaunts on trails but mostly on smooth paths or on the road I'd opt for the Deore or X5 as mentioned above. This is definitely the lowest group I'd use for even the mildest offroad adventures.|`|Cl6KbcAGaa	Shimano has the Deore group for 9 speed and Sram has the X5 group. Neither is cheap but also not the most expensive either as Shimano XTR and Sram X0 is the most expensive in both groups and the Deore group is about $250 and X5 is $225 +/- depending on what you get with it all. They are both efficient in shifting but there is still a big difference between the higher groups when compared. Again efficient and economical just dont really go together here. Both groups work fine (for someone who does not know the difference) and the higher end shifters are certainly NOT economical but they work better every year!

Unlike the Glock striker which is only engaged to the trigger bar and needs the full travel of the trigger to "c.ock" and release the striker.<br>  <br>  Anyway, the XD has a grip and firing pin safety which will not let the pistol fire until they are disengaged. The grip safety won't let you pull the trigger and the firing pin safety won't disengage until you pull the trigger.

aIhVHfMUaa	to me, this makes perfect sense. Ponting has had some niggling injuries for a while now, and considering how jam-packed the next 18 months are for the australian side, i think its a smart call to get the extra time off, cos theres not much time off to be had!<br>  <br>  also, i am incredibly glad to see that, to some people at least, playing for your country means more than playing for money, and lets be honest here, international cricketers are paid pretty well these days.<br>  <br>  i dont think it will influence other players to pull out from the IPL tho, you look at Clarke and now Ponting deciding not to go, well as i said, theyre shedule is quite full and they both have had injury concerns, so getting rest ahead of the biggest contest in test cricket (The Ashes) makes perfect sense to me. i think theyre will be more aussie players pull out tho, possibly someone like Mike Hussey just to ease his workload, maybe Andrew MacDonald, just to try and focus on cementing his Test spot, but i would doubt it, but truthfully i dont think it will really influence anyone, theyll just make there own choice regarding IPL<br>  <br>  as i said tho, its nice to see some players still putting Country before Money!|`|LzkujA3Faa	Bravo skipper! <br>  <br>  He is certainly leading by example, though it took some time for him to realise where his loyalties should lie. Now that's three level headed men --Mitch, Pup and now Ricky. I sincerely hope all our boys too follow the example. Ponting is already suffering from injuries and it is a good decision by him to pull out so as not to aggravate them.<br>  <br>  So far no players, other than the Aussies, have pulled out from IPL.. I don't know whether they will. But they should give it a second thought before jumping into it.|`|fsLMFIpgaa	I just wish they all would, see how long it lasts then! But I can't see too many of them doing so.|`|4cd30bf7558366b3b6c31ee6e5edf5d1aa	The younger players will probably still go to India, Ponting is getting older and needs more time to recouperate than the younger players who I'm sure will relish the chance to make some big bucks.|`|Qq2MKeXUaa	It's good to see that some think that country comes first and not the cheque book.|`|AA11088802	good for him|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	its good decision|`|pLrTfvo9aa	20/20 is a young mans game. I reckon age 30 and below , fit, in form and keen = best players to cope with a demanding IPL schedule. Ponting looked really puffed, out of form and wrong side of 30 when he was playing a less hectic schedule of 2 x 20/20 against South Africa.  I think his problem is the money is very attractive and for a guy in the sunset of their career seeking to sure up the families financial future its not unexpected one would go for it under normal conditions. But the old frame is cracking up and he needs to see the doc or risk ending his career.|`|2Gz6pVbKaa	I left a reply on Brett Lee's blog 2day, he was saying his injury is coming along fine and he hopes to be ready for the IPL, I said surely the ashes is more important what if you get injured playing for money then cant play ashes. Its a great stand for a captain to make I have bagged Ponting a bit but this is a great show of leadership dont forget Clarke he hasn't even played IPL yet and dosn't look like he will for a few years yet.|`|uG8yLnUWaa	I say good on him for thinking of his wife and child as well as the importance of the Ashes series. I suspect a lot of players would be more focused on the money, but hopefully this will make them think  beyond that and focus on Aussie cricket which needs all Aussie players to be 100% fit and healthy to try and beat those Poms (no offence intended in the use of the term Pom).<br>  <br>  will other countries follow suit? I think so. The novelty of the IPL will wear off and players will realise that playing for their country is of far greater importance and more prestigious than the IPL.|`|GGuXJJeAaa	yeah I'd seen it foxnews... I am not surprise at all, Ricky is concentrating more on winning"the ashes", and it happen that the ashes is just a few months away..<br>  <br>  I think players woudl still sign up for IPL if their schedule woudl allow them... and also those players that are not playign forinternational games anymore..<br>  <br>  Good on ya Ricky|`|CoeOAH3faa	No way the other Aussie players will follow him, Punter is outta form anyway, so he rather play for Australia, and get his form back, Good decision from him and for the IPL,,|`|BJ7XidIVaa	good decision by him....<br>  <br>  Other player's don't really need the rest...<br>  <br>  remember this is T20 your not playin five days in a row and you only have to bowl 4 good overs....

cOPCNP7Laa	I couldn't care less if Milan were on top of Juve but they still have won 10 Scudetti more.    At the end of the day what is the point of winning more games if it does not get you to win the overall competition? i.e. Serie A and thus the Scudetto.    On that note you know who is on top there and on every other major competion except UEFA Cup wins :P    Relegation? Do you think it fazes me? lmao not at all.

Bravo cannot go 2 America. Cabanas well make him look like a beginner|`|8zgFyfibaa	Honestly I think omar bravo can still play in europe. The reason he doesn't play as much is because deportivo uses 1 striker and omar isn't used to playing like that. He was a good player in chivas that's why he left to europe. <br>  <br>  I think he can play for the duth league if not the turkish league, if he was to come back to mexico I think he should go back to chivas or cruz azul. Look what happened to kikin fonseca he came back to mexico and went to tigres and he sucks he wasn't the player we saw when he played in pumas and cruz azul. <br>  <br>  I think bravo should stay in europe maybe in 2 years he can come back to mexico.|`|GDL00jbIaa	he should go back to Chivas|`|qbPbvLuLaa	I hope he stays in Europe but plays with a different team.|`|Cpm25Pekaa	exactly what I said on one of my other answers. Plus Tigres has more money than Cruz Roja.|`|7R0VT1Graa	Take it from a huge omar bravo fan.<br>  He will not play for Cruz Azul, Chivas has granted permission to Tigres and they have more money. Coach Miguel Angel Lotina from deportivo la coruna has stated that he loves omar bravo, his lack of minutes are not due to him not being good enough its just the fact that he used one single striker. during the winter transfer season his name came up from various teams from different countries, they rejected them because they do want him. Tigres just issued another offer and from what i hear its a pretty good sum of money. If bravo does come to Mexico and plays for tigres it would just be the rest of the season and will return to la coruna, because thats what the president of the galician team wants.<br>  To the people that talk so badly of omar bravo and comparing him to kikin, Look at the their accomplishments, there is no comparison. Bravo is an icon for Guadalajara, Kikin is lost in time. Bravo has potential and he is a fighter on the field and very humble, he will do just fine.|`|Epmny08zaa	I Say Go To Tigres.. Becuzz There Not Doing So Great This Season...And For Me Bravo Is Not Doing Much Of A Good Job In Depor...And I Saw Bravo As A Good Player In Chivas..Maybe Heill Do Better In Tigres.... <br>  <br>  AzulKrema@: Lol Bravo Wont Go To America..|`|tqJjxLgZaa	ITS GONNA BE SAD<br>  <br>  CUZ HE WENT 2 "PLAY"<br>  <br>  AND MOST OF THE GAMES HE WAS BENCHED<br>  <br>  AND THEY DONT LIKE PLAYERS OLDER THAN 30 UNLESS THEYRE REALLY FAMOUS AND REALLY GREAT AT SOCCER LIKE BECKHAM<br>  <br>  SO THERE WOULD BE A LOT OF PPL TALKING SMACK|`|KUDM3Q4Uaa	Ive been hearing he might come to America|`|Xm3ijR4Xaa	Evrey One her JUST GO FOR MIS DIABLOS ROJOS DE TOLUCA Lets Go for two in a row  Take It Like A Man|`|p4cgonKCaa	he is staying in europe dude.

dfBwVxXFaa	I have a 24/7 pro .45 cal, and I have a ton of rounds through it. I have never had a problem with misfires or jams. The first poster is correct on the second chance feature, but I have never had to use it.|`|dda37e592e7a473ae883df834ad9805faa	As the first poster claims, in the event of a misfire, you can simply pull the trigger again, just as you can with most any other double action or double action auto.  This is sort of an advertising dig at striker fired pistols where the action must be worked, at least part way before you can attempt to fire the pistol again.    However in my experience, i would never utilize that feature in an armed confrontation.  The reason being is because you don't know what is really wrong and if the round is truly bad, you just wasted precious time working the trigger when you should have been performing a stoppage drill.|`|92jr44kFaa	That's a neat feature, I think.  It's the first handgun I've seen that you can pull the trigger a second time without manually cycling the weapon.  In the event that the firing pin doesn't make good contact the first time, pulling the trigger again may solve the problem.    Heads up though.  The 24/7's have been reported to have some problems with the firing pin block.  On the one I tried, the trigger bar didn't fully disengage the block, and resulted in multiple misfires.  This may have been an isolated incident, or it might be a design flaw.|`|itiLu3dRaa	If the round in the gun did not go off, you can pull the trigger again.

Wimbledon is on grass while the French Open is on clay.<br>  <br>  Usually, hard courts are faster than clay but slower than grass. However, US Open is played on acrylic hard court which is faster than the synthetic AO courts. Lately, the courts at WImbledon have slowed down, and some people feel the US Open has the fastest surface of all.<br>  <br>  This has not always been the case. The AO was played on grasss till 1987. The US Open was played on grass till 1974 and on clay from 1975-77.|`|U7BkuEU9aa	The first slam of the year is the Australian Open, played on hard courts in January.

Then finally in August there's the US Open, played on hard courts (but it's not the same surface as the Australian Open...US Open courts are much faster).|`|TkWmFshkaa	Australian is a hardcourt/plexicushion<br>  Roland Garros is clay<br>  Wimbledon is grass<br>  US Open is hardcourt|`|gP7IB2XCaa	Wimbledon:grass<br>  AO: hard<br>  US Open: hard<br>  French:Clay|`|UV6K1mqtaa	Wimbledon-grass<br>  AU-Hard<br>  US-HArd<br>  French- clay
DCNL73ZJaa	Hey thats cool im the goalie for my team to. Anyway to play you need pads, breezers (goalie kind are best), chest pads, catcher, blocker, skates helmet hockey socks (obiously), and possibly a neck guard or mouth guard depending on the rules. Just keep in mind that most teams will have starter pads and that it is best to try the pads before you buy them. To improve your skills you can juggle stickhandle and of course just practice.  Good Luck:)

e3m3rdNYaa	I agree with everything you said. I can't stand Edge either<br>  <br>  You forgot Ugly...|`|9Us6XYg8aa	Because he is a GREAT heel.<br>  <br>  And your question is proof.<br>  He is also funny.<br>  And he has a good entrance song and entrance.<br>  <br>  But I agree Vickie is annoying.|`|2rJwgk40aa	Actually,Edge is a good wrestler.He makes a great heel because hes good at making people hate him.Im not a fan of his but I have to say hes very good at what he does.<br>  btw,how old are you?|`|3nN1vTTuaa	Edge is hilarious, did you see him on raw last week?<br>  <br>  Guess what, YOUR WRONG!!!!!!!|`|OuFhcdX9aa	first off you have to be a damn cena fan.<br>  <br>  Edge is one of the greatest wrestlers alive today. he has everything needed to be a great wrestler. he is tough crafty a master at the game.<br>  he can play people like no one else.<br>  the only wrestler better then edge is orton.<br>  order of greatest Orton,Edge,Christian.jericho and rhodes/dibiase.|`|zxEou7XWaa	Here are 5 counterexamples to the stuff you said.<br>  1.) He's only in it for the power and championships<br>  2.) Your obviously a bandwagon heel hater.<br>  3.) He's playing a role<br>  4.) He went to college on a wrestling scolarship<br>  5.) He playing a ROLE!|`|9I4Wle62aa	Wow you have to be like 10yrs old or something.<br>  How long have you been a wrestling fan for?<br>  Do you know that it is SCRIPTED and that they are all just acting?<br>  Have you seen Edge's dvd?<br>  <br>  Lastly..Edge and Christian reak of awesomeness. :-)|`|T8IFOfHCaa	no one cares man. ppl like him because:<br>  <br>  1. been with the wwe for a long time<br>  2. he entertains us.<br>  3. hes good.<br>  4.he wrestles smart.<br>  5.he risks his body to enterains us.<br>  6. the wwe gave him the gimmick|`|22f82d8d45e6cb20bd3007cf1b7900f2aa	he isnt a good wrestler? Let me guess you like Cena?<br>  <br>  Edge is an excellent performer and does a great job at making the fans hate him. You sound retarded for calling Edge retarded|`|yqKylr0Faa	well to me edge is ok but not the best the best is hbk here lately. but you are right about edge|`|3o8jPdWQaa	He is good wrestler but i hate how he wins titles. He's never won a WWE or World title fair in square.|`|4DzPhJgKaa	Watch edges new DVD and you'll see why he reeks of awesomeness<br>  oh btw<br>  YOUR WRONG <br>  WRONG WRONG WRONG WRONG WRONG|`|JDPPnw76aa	He is entertaining that's why. All of the reasons you just listed prove exactly that. Now why wouldn't you want a jerk like that around? He is hilarious. And he is a good wrestler, well better than a lot of other guys. And just so you are clear on this, Edge acts the way he does because the WWE tells him to, not because he wants to.|`|5iZEX0p0aa	i liked edge beforee he was heel(bad) . he was pretty chill and amazing to watch ..he still is now pretty entertaining but the fact that hes a heel pisses me off lol or else yah i would have liked him:)|`|DJeij6Pgaa	Dont watch wwe you have to respect him for whatever he does hes exciting to watch|`|XbnnrX5saa	Really too think about i don't think anyone likes edge.|`|Cc4lc3qCaa	Because he the best HeeL!!!|`|JiCfYfLraa	he is great i dont know what you are talking about you probably started watching wretling this year.|`|NXktxy8jaa	Yeah, Those Are Real Good Reasons To Hate Edge...<br>  <br>  Edge takes those things that you said about him and he uses them as an advantage. He is a heel so he feeds on the fans booing him. He may not like it in person, but that is what he is supposed to do. He is a heel, so he has to act Mean, and cocky. And that is why he is a good wrestler. That is why I AM a fan of his. Whats not to like about him? His attitude and Mic Skills are amazing!
0fb4ce4da0f3875154ab271a088412fcaa	LeBron never announced that.|`|XT8eNPhVaa	LeBron never said that, who knows he might stay. Plus they still have him for this year and they need him if they want ANY chance at a championship this year
wDdwYqazaa	Larry Hughs was a gun who wasnt go at it and a bad teamate<br>  John Salmons is an upgrade who can play defense and score<br>  Brad Miller is bascally Drew Gooden but shots a higher FG% and can defender better.<br>  Tim Thomas can give you a good 15 minutes but i dont see him hitting the court much <br>  No other additions are worth mentoning<br>  <br>  Noce had a bad contract. He plays hard but not a good defender and averages 10 points a game at 40%. Ben gordon shots 40% from the 3 point line.<br>  <br>  Drew Gooden was undersized so that hurt him defensely. Plus he was a face up player who hit his jumpshot to inconsistly. With miller you get a bigger contract that expire next season in time for the 2010 FA agent class when we can possibly sign a big.<br>  <br>  Thabo was talented ut was gonna hit the court much and get an opportunity to play plus we get a late round pick that we can trade or find a role player or maybe a steal|`|cBJfldtEaa	i think getting salmons and miller was good<br>  the other trade i dont really care about except maybe tim thomas|`|u2nM7Vxlaa	I don't know if the Thabo Sefalosha trade was a good one, for a low first round pick. But I like Larry Hughes and the New York Knick trade because I say Larry Hughes as a ball hog and someone who wants willing to play in the system the Chicago Bulls were running. Jerome James can give them a good presence and Tim Thomas is pretty good although we already have a TT (Tyrus Thomas). I'm not really sure how good the other player is. I really like the other trade involving Drew Gooden and Andres Nociani because Nociani wasn't doing well this year and neither was Gooden. Salmons can drive to the rim whell and is a good pick up for the Chicago Bulls and Brad Miller is a much needed center. I like most of the trades outcome.|`|73c54edf17bc6e46f1b58fc8f251941faa	Overall, it's pretty good. Gooden was injury-prone anyway and Nocioni was on the decline. Brad Miller brings a lot of height, and Salmons can bring scoring. Tim Thomas from the Knicks wasn't bad either, because he can get hot in certain games.|`|gPZ7d3mJaa	umm yeah<br>  because noicioni is not playing good this season and the other guys arnt doing **** on the team<br>  <br>  they got brad miller-a good shooter and a big man|`|AA10665495	NO, I THINK THEY NEED A GOOD CENTER, NOT ANOTHER 3 POINT PLAYER. THEY HAVE TOO MANY OF THEM ALREADY!<br>  THEY NEED A GOOD CENTER AND A FORWARD.<br>  <br>                                                  SANDY
XRw2ux9waa	The old DX. Meaning, when Degeneration X was formed in the 90's, and they really dominated, having an impact. That team, I would say is better. <br>  <br>  But nowadays, or well, when they returned in 2006, they weren't a team making an impact anymore. All they were was two human advertisements. Every segment they had was selling WWE merchandise. What happened to the DX stable that invaded WCW?<br>  <br>  <br>  Old Degeneration X or Evolution - Winner: Degeneration X<br>  <br>  Evolution or Current Degeneration X - Winner: Evolution.<br>  <br>  Get it?|`|T8IFOfHCaa	both cause hbk in dx and orton and batista in evolution|`|CzIaAnsraa	Evolution. Why? Ric Flair.|`|EnIHwlT1aa	DX|`|AA11461490	Evolution|`|ULSUqmeZaa	the older Dx..evolution was good too.|`|2rJwgk40aa	Both were good,but I like DX better.I like the jokes and the fun.|`|EzazmdpZaa	D-Generation X|`|W5XiK06Maa	i really like both. but they are totally kinda different groups. dx was the funny guys but would beat up guys, and evolution which i think was better was about business and being the top dogs of the company and not letting anyone get in their way. and when they won, they would celebrate and have the biggest parties backstage or live on raw. i like dx, but i loved what evolution brought to the table.|`|d2OLxA72aa	That's a tough call, because DX is more popular, but Evolution had more Heavy weight or Championship titles: the Animal, Orton, Triple H and Flair in the past.<br>  <br>  DX only had Triple H and Michael's. Billy Gunn was pushed but just never materialized. X-Pac or the 1-2-3 Kid only held tag team, and maybe IC or European titles. Chyna actually held the IC title with Jericho.|`|Q7U2HaYdaa	Evolution!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://freesportsnetwork.net/" rel="nofollow">http://freesportsnetwork.net/</a><br>  it never lets me down and it always shows High Quality and HD streams and plus it never lags with the amount of people!<br>  <a href="http://freesportsnetwork.net/" rel="nofollow">http://freesportsnetwork.net/</a> Also it shows RAW, Smackdown, ECW, TNA, ROH, Boxing, UFC!!<br>  <a href="http://freesportsnetwork.net/" rel="nofollow">http://freesportsnetwork.net/</a> !!!!!!!!!!!|`|AA12133451	DX!|`|s4FIoGwmaa	DX was the greatest stable of all time|`|JiCfYfLraa	the old dx with triple h,road dogg,billy gunn,xpac,stephanie and tori. they were like a bad virus in the wwf spreading eveywhere.|`|6f41c712d34a30397cc9d83fa0a8d496aa	D GENERATION X<br>   HBK -N- HHH<br>  ARE THE BEST..YAY<br>  <br>  HBK= ROLE MODEL=HERO<br>  HHH=AWSOME=COOL|`|gzRZlfpLaa	The first dx, with hbk and hhh was the best EVER, then the second one without hbk,then................................... back here because it was garbage|`|11i3Xmb1aa	Umm...<br>  I was surely a big fan of Evolution and I'm a fan of old DX and new DX.<br>  But overall I would say DX.<br>  <br>  (:|`|1UKAho1iaa	DX.

9hC7bbf7aa	I honestly don't think it has anything to do with their relationship. If you have noticed, players coach, trainer, physio usually, if not always, sit together in the front seat, including Mirka Vavrinec for Federer. But the family members usually sit separately a few rows behind. Probably because of professional reasons too, three key members continuously exchange communications throughout the match. By the way, Rafa's father is Sebastian. The Nadals are tightly knit family, IMO.|`|aTBs7pJ4aa	well it could be a bunch of reasons.. could be they would argue alot..  or it could be they would also argue about his training..  and also it could be they need space|`|Bpt3Kgnhaa	His fathers name is Sebastian and yes i have noticed tht to. I think the one reason y this is cuz they r all so freakin nervous did u c his father at the aussie open this year he was about to lose it and go crzy and if they sat 2gether they would probably like kill one another but afterward win rafa finally won they all hugged and then they were all happy
L1O3O8pQaa	YES! treat them as such and try not to drop them and or strike the primers...There is a relatively low risk one would go off though you should still be cautious. I bet you made some cool finds there and I hoe you had fun...I wish we had an Army-Navy Store here...anywho. Ammunition still uses black powder as a propulsion agent in all their ammunition...OH and the LC stands for Lake City which is the manufacturing plant those rounds came from. I am not sure but I think the number portion stands for the year they are produced. i.e. 2003, 2006. (03) (06) <br>  <br>  As with any Unexploded Ordinance you should be cautious. As these are live rounds, small rounds and in solid shape I would say you have nothing to worry about. Oil them to preserve them and keep them on display or stowed where they aren't easily accessible to the public or curious young hands and fingers.|`|CFQbdDRNaa	WHY IN THE F%&K did you buy bullets you dont have a gun for?LOL!!!|`|yeqf6RI9aa	if there is an intact primer i would treat them as live ammunition. by the way LC stands for Lake City.|`|kmIcAySEaa	I would say they are, I would certainly treat them like they were. Is there a primer still ?|`|8ivnzNi5aa	Somewhere on that headstamp should be a caliber designation, such as 5.56 mm, 9mm, 7.62mm, .50 cal, or whatever.  The headstamp is where you saw that LC number.  Assume that they're still live rounds.|`|mOTCr8Pxaa	Look at the primer. If it has been fired than it's not live. But you say they have powder in them that means the rounds are live and therefore can be fired. But Boston is in pukeachussettes I heard if you buy ammo you need a special license or it's three years in prison just touching the bullet.

My son and I watched WM24 at Hooters last year.  In theory you could sit there all night and not pay a penny, but we bought dinner.  They fun part of it was that you are there with a bunch of wrestling fans, and it gets pretty rowdy.  This year I am going to be home, but we are still going to a bar to watch it with a bunch of my son's friends.  I may still be paying $50 for food, but you also get the fun of being around a crowd.

You will feel very odd at first until you develop Strong muscles in the lowerbody|`|YMnTveWuaa	Not worth the effort.|`|vwoqIUR6aa	I don't think it's hard to learn. what is hard is to keep yourself on the board. should be fun and it good for abs. look at Cameron Diaz' abs. I hear it' from surfing.|`|krIP1mrxaa	Have patience, and listen to whatever the instructor says.  Things will seem wrong or uncomfortable to you at first but you should stick with doing it the right way.    best answer please! :)|`|7iMZ91K7aa	Honestly, the first day you go out in the water, it will take you all day to get your first wave, and actually be able to stand up.. after that, it gets easier and easier... but its super fun... GOOD LUCK!!|`|ogDi5xXxaa	Extremely    it will take a while to get good|`|eD2SzJ2Jaa	It is not too bad, you will get the hang of it. A surf camp is a good idea. Have fun! :D|`|LXEqtNlbaa	no not at all just keep trying i learned in a half an hour.!! its the most amazing thing you'l really enjoy it.!    i so jealous i wanna go to a camp like that.!!|`|AA11661950	Listen to the instructors and practice. You should be riding the waves fairly good inside of a week.|`|pPhy6JVDaa	learn on a long board not a short board.  YOu'll have more fun and will be able to ride the waves longer.  I learned on a short board in Florida and it took me all freakin summer to finally get up and cut in and out of the waves.  I bought a "fun" board and the next summer and TORE it up and have A LOT more fun!  Easiers to get up and can ride the wave all the way to shore|`|r1FX4xfMaa	it depends on your athletic ability and what type of equipment you have. it is usually always hard, but if you are in shape and well equiped,  you shouldnt have such a hard time. you also have to have a lot of dedication. if you skateboard or wakeboard, then you will have good balance, so you wont have to work on that feild of learning so much. going to surf camp to get lessons like you are doing is the best and fastest and safest way to learn. if you are out in the water with your friends and intructors for about 6-8 hours a day, every day, then you should be able to get it pretty soon. but i can not tell you how fast you will learn because i dont know you. lol. hope this helps. have fun surfing|`|78GAeOeuaa	i dont really know how hard it is to learn because i have been surfing since i could stand up so i dont know how hard it is. how ever, i do know that it is dificult, no matter how good you are at snowboarding and stuff like that. you should go surf because it is sooooo much fun. the only way to know if you like it is to go out and try it, so go to the surf camp and have the surfing experience :)|`|8JXJTz2Maa	It does come naturally to some people, especially if you've grown up with it. I wish they had learners beaches here Aus though, all we get is young amateurs snaking our waves like they're all pro and all. Makes me wanna beat the **** out of they're trainer for not teaching em the code.|`|NDFxmiilaa	yes u need balance.|`|YZ4ozLyyaa	man you dont learn to surf  you just feel it in your bones  its a way of life  its for fun  difficult isnt surfing language  just hire a penguin to help you|`|pdLEuGStaa	It's really hard to learn because its going to be something completely different than what you are used to. I suggest starting up on a long board because youll be able to catch waves easier and will be able to stand up longer. Listen to your instructor and get used to falling. The more you surf though the easier it gets, it's just like riding a bike.|`|XdXgK8bgaa	Learn to balance on a wobbling surface, if you learn how to spread your weight evenly, you can balance better oh, and remember to relax your body when trying to stand up.  I've never surfed before, but I found this info when "surfing" the internet on how to surf.  I forgot the name of the sight though.|`|mvZTm2pjaa	if u have arm muscles, nd leg muscles itll be easier .  u just need to know how to paddle right,   when to stand up.   how to stand up   and then turn.     its mad fun, and if u have determination ull be amazing in no time.     its very worth it!    good luck! :D 
5eqjJT55aa	First of all do not buy cheap. Cheap machines will not hold up and not preform to your needs. When a cheap machine breaks down or doesn't do what you want, it sits there collecting dust and all you did was waste your money.   The most popular machine out there is made by Concept2. They are reliable, easy to repair if needed, and easy to get a hold of. Concept2 also has great costumer service. They have several models to choose from depending on your budget. They also have used machines for sale also. Another route is to contact the folks that hold the CRASH-B in Boston, they often sell the machines that where used during the CRASH-B at a greatly reduced rate. The big catch with buying a rowing machine from the CRASH-B folks is you must be there to pick up the machine after the races are completed. They do not ship them. There are a few schools that do that to get their hands on good machines at a reduced price. The school I coach for owns many Concept2 rowing machines and we are pleased with every single one. A few machines are approaching the 7 year mark and function very well. We also have machines that are a year old. For our growing crew program, we add 2 machines to our inventory every year.

We all knew Bonds was juicing, but most of us didn't even know that A-roid was on steroids.|`|tvuhGTD9aa	Look, there's still a Flat Earth Society operating.<br>  <br>  The world is filled with charming delusions.|`|5MtNumoSaa	Ask him if he also believes in the Tooth Fairy, Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny as well.<br>  And please inform him also that Elvis really is dead, not managing a Burger King in Kalamazoo.|`|cWmx0J4jaa	disagree, Jose Canseco outed Arod years ago and Bonds himself admitted to taking steroids, he simply said he thought it was flax seed oil. He did admit taking it though.|`|n8Xylq4Oaa	i totally disagree, Bonds is the biggest user ever, A-Rod probably thought he'd be cool like Bonds if he did it..lol idk stupid idiots.|`|1TooRFX2aa	Frankly, i don't know why they didn't check A-Rod earlier...<br>  <br>  ps. i'm a yankee fan, loyal and everything...
mIdcJEJNaa	I agree..  And another thing..  I don't mind people who are new to racing wanting to learn...  I've been going to race tracks for about fifty years, for one reason, or another...  While I don't mind hearing someones opinion, I don't much care for someone who's only experience in racing is having a   Fantasy Team for the last two years tell me how things work...  And for some reason, Fantasy racers do that more than others...|`|7RUMbREoaa	Well,when someone is choosing their fantasy teams each week,they need to be informed about who the best choices are(which drivers are best at each track,avg. finishing/starting positions,who has won there,etc.I see absolutely nothing wrong with someone asking others' opinions about who to choose for their fantasy teams in this section-most of them are already regular members of NASCAR Nation and some of the greatest contributors.Not being rude,but if you don't like the fantasy questions,don't answer them.|`|EHtFxGxMaa	You could ask the same question about football, or anything else.    They are grouped together because that is where some coder, sitting in a basement somewhere decided to put them.    They definitely are separated.|`|1a17e73a07a2c5ebb65e5750cb7c97faaa	Because it is fantasy RACING and not just plain old fantasy whatever.  Fantasy racing leagues are very real and getting more popular every year.  I do several myself and don't feel that you can separate fantasy racing questions from the NASCAR forum.  They are legitimate enough questions and definitely pertain to which drivers are relevant for that week's race.  Being involved with fantasy racing has made me a MUCH more knowledgeable fan and heightened my awareness of all the different teams and drivers.  It makes you follow so much more than just your favorites and becomes sort of addictive after awhile.  I love fantasy racing and think the fans that get into it ask some of the most "legitimate" questions in here.  They are WAY better than the Who's your favorite/Who's hottest/How do drivers pee type of questions!  4's FINE N 09!!!!|`|op9iJRvBaa	I'm in several racing fantasy leagues and have never asked a question about it. However, I don't feel that type of question belongs in the game section. People who are asking those type of questions would like someone with good racing knowledge to answer their question. That won't happen in the game section.    Trego - very funny. Who doesn't love the driver pee pee question?|`|ozRUw6HUaa	when someone has a question on fantacy nascar racing they want to hear from nascar fans.....its very simple.|`|LXwfR3Ofaa	So if I play fantasy Nascar online and have a "team" at the local watering hole...I am not a true race fan?...interesting...    Fantasy Sports have made many fans for the Baseball and Football...    Basketball and Hockey are catching on, but their schedule format doesn't fit as well. Don't knock the fantasy playing fan...    Most are more into the behind the scenes and race than the non players.|`|OdmSIlYCaa	just because a fantasy question is asked,don't make us less of a fan........in many ways it makes us more or a fan,because without people doing fantasy,the sports would not be as big,and grow as much,and therefore would not get as much coverage and be shown on tv ect as much...........wow.......|`|739f14d79f8285fdffb364bed6c305feaa	I am in a few NASCAR fantasy leagues and heck ya I will ask questions to these fine folks who better to help me than the extraordinarily knowledgeable folks in the NASCAR section?  Most of the time I can count on straight unbiased answers ya know just the facts & stats.

He wants one more BIG payday before he retires. With the Ravens who are having cap problems I don't see him getting the big money. I think franchising Suggs was the right thing to do.

CQgNXXsbaa	Actually that was based on the 2007 season. So at the beginning of the year yes, the Steelers had the hardest schedule.     But if you look at this years numbers based on opponents overall records Cleveland had the hardest schedule. Followed by Detriot, Cincinnati, Kansas City, Jacksonville, St. Louis then Pittsburgh.    Here's the 2008 Regular season list:    Team -  win-loss - SoS - Opp Rec  Cleveland Browns - 4-12 - 0.5720  - 145-108-3  Detroit Lions - 0-16 0.5590 - 143-113-0  Cincinnati Bengals - 4-11 - 0.5530 - 141-114-1  Kansas City Chiefs - 2-14 - 0.5370 - 137-118-1  Jacksonville Jaguars - 5-11 - 0.5370 - 137-118-1  St. Louis Rams - 2-14  - 0.5330 - 136-119-1  Pittsburgh Steelers  - 12-4 - 0.5250 - 133-120-3  Baltimore Ravens  - 11-5 - 0.5210 - 132-121-3  Oakland Raiders - 5-11 - 0.5200 - 133-123-0  Houston Texans - 8-8 - 0.5180 - 132-123-1  San Diego Chargers  - 8-8 - 0.5160 - 132-124-0  Philadelphia Eagles  - 9-6 - 0.5140 - 131-124-1  Green Bay Packers - 6-10 - 0.5040 - 129-127-0  Minnesota Vikings  - 10-6 - 0.5040 - 129-127-0  New York Giants  - 12-4 - 0.5020 - 127-126-3  Seattle Seahawks - 4-12 - 0.4980 - 127-128-1  Dallas Cowboys - 9-7 - 0.4980 - 126-127-3  Indianapolis Colts  - 12-4 - 0.4980 - 127-128-1  New Orleans Saints - 8-8 - 0.4960 - 127-129-0  Carolina Panthers  - 12-4 - 0.4880 - 125-131-0  Arizona Cardinals  - 9-7 - 0.4860 - 124-131-1  Tampa Bay  - 9-7 - 0.4800 - 123-133-0  New England  - 11-5 - 0.4800 - 123-133-0  Washington - 8-8 - 0.4790 - 121-132-3  Chicago Bears - 9-7 - 0.4750 - 121-134-1  New York Jets - 9-7 - 0.4710 - 120-135-1  Miami Dolphins  - 11-5 - 0.4610 - 118-138-0  Atlanta Falcons  - 11-5 - 0.4590 - 117-138-1  Tennessee Titans  - 13-3 - 0.4590 - 117-138-1  Denver Broncos - 8-8 - 0.4570 - 117-139-0  Buffalo Bills - 7-9 - 0.4530 - 116-140-0  San Francisco 49ers - 7-9 - 0.4470 - 114-141-1|`|a6EndAPiaa	Yes it was well published that the Steelers had the hardest schedule in the NFL this season.  They mentioned it at least twice during the Super Bowl.|`|e53807be9e34b50fae02ba7c73274c6baa	Pretty tough....  However, 4 games against Cleveland and Cincinnati were as good as bye weeks.|`|scdOQ2CAaa	if you consider the browns and bengals a tough team...|`|Awfv7TV3aa	no one can argue that. all their losses were to teams that made the playoffs and even when they lost, they didnt lose bad. every game was competitive. without question the best team won the Superbowl.|`|sMssDP1Xaa	I think it's pretty obvious that the Lions had the toughest schedule.|`|sPiwb8Hraa	Yes. Next year is much easier.    Stairway to Seven begins!|`|C290wQWGaa	Nearly played every single team in the playoffs in the regular season put it that way|`|SEcM9EDZaa	Maybe, but when you consider the phantom TDs they were awarded, including one that basically handed the Super Bowl to them, they have no reason to complain.|`|tNerdFYsaa	yes they had the toughest schedule ever!!! but a weak divison besides Balt|`|jioRrEh6aa	Isn't it obvious that my Raiders had the hardest schedule. It's a conspiracy, the NFL does this to me every year. I hate it when the "man" holds me down. I like women to do that instead.
JiCfYfLraa	of course he was awesome god bless his soul and his family. i loved his match with bret hart he showed him that he was just as good as him and he proved it. owen hart was a well grounded technical wrestler and is one of the best.|`|gzRZlfpLaa	He was pretty good, i dont know that he would have been a champion seeing as what his last gimmack was|`|1UKAho1iaa	Honestly, I don't remember Owen Hart all that well.

huto12P3aa	Vidic at the moment is without question the best defender in the Premier league, if not Europe at the moment.|`|HxET88bDaa	One of the very best, yes.

The best player at the moment is probably Cristiano Ronaldo or Steven Gerrard|`|0HO8sTGeaa	Vidic is the best defender in the epl @  the moment along side Ferdinand. but like others says he's not the best player in the league....  but who knows... he might actually achieve it...

They all play different parts on the field, you are right in saying he is the best.. just need to add on 'at defending'    Think You need to learn your positions on the field mayte|`|biTcOyxzaa	In my opinion Vidic is a median player. one defender better than Vidic, for example, is Alex - Chelsea (he played very good in game Chelsea x Liverpool). but the best player of the Premier League in season 2008/2009 is Cristiano Ronaldo.|`|UeNVANmpaa	I agree Vidic is in the top 5 players in the EPL right now and to me the best defender in Europe. I can't think of any defender as good as him.... he has ever surpassed Ferninand in my opinion.|`|6mgmdMRwaa	???|`|5c0ea2e937929dc820b4f96293aa83a2aa	He is the best Defender in the league....... He makes Rio look like Titas Bramble    But the best player in the League is Ronaldo.. but he is currently under performing|`|Lr75hENEaa	he is the best defender|`|pescodEvaa	Vidic is the best defender in the league.  Not the best player.  The best player would have to be Cristiano Ronaldo - even thought I hate to admit it.  However, Gerrard, Rooney and Torres all deserve an honourable mention.
eac78f41a64d286478c23785cf30be23aa	There are a bunch of factors, but here's the bit about the wrists..    Get into your batting stance and take a slow motion swing.  Freeze at the point where you imagine ball impact would be and look at your wrist position.    In a "pull" swing, your top hand is probably already over or in front of your bottom hand.  Your top wrist is probably pointed toward the pitcher or down toward the plate and you can see your knuckles of you right hand.    If this is the case, rotate you wrists so that your left hand is now behind your right.  Your left knuckles should still be pointing toward the ground.  If you do this, you'll notice the bat head moves back several inches, creating the angle you need for an opposite field hit.|`|gVYfFSpRaa	1. Closed stance  2. wait on the ball    Unless you're doing something wrong with your wrists, that's really all you need.  And when you take your stride, step more towards the inside part of the plate (you'll probably do this automatically when you try a closed stance).  Basically, you need to step to the ball, wherever it is.  If it's inside, you'll have to take that one to right field, but if it's outside, you have to step to the ball and rip it to left field or you'll probably try to pull it and pop it up or hit a weak grounder.    I'm right-handed and I used to have so much trouble hitting to right field.  But then I started working on it, changed my stance, and worked on my timing, and it has helped so much.  Now an outside pitch is my favorite pitch to hit and I can take it straight to right field.|`|xIfvXy4waa	We learned this exact techinque at my last softball camp. They called it elbow, knob, barrel. Bring your elbow towards the pitcher, bring the know towards the pitcher and finally flick your wrist and bring the barrel towards the ball. It takes a little practice but I am now an expert at hitting the other way.|`|y0tRWXMaaa	im a left handed batter too    try moving ur lead foot more towards the first baseman   ur hips will go tht way wen u swing and the ball will also go tht way|`|Q8dEQJBSaa	Well you def have the right idea let the ball get deeper on you and work your hand from inside to out.Hitting soft toss is the best way to develop this.|`|p8ahZa8iaa	Jason Giambi, is that you?|`|IqRtCFcZaa	in addition to what everyone has said also try using your shoe laces as a guide. if you want to hit it to left field  your back foot, face of the  laces (where laces go over the tounge), post swing should be facing right filed, center they should be towards center and right they should be toward right. just a little tip i picked up from d1 baseball.|`|io3hggzZaa	as you take your step, step somewhat towards home plate and it will close your hips making your bat project the ball to left field.|`|PwED69Isaa	You are probably in the habit of snapping your wrists forward as they go through the strike zone. Which isn't necessarily bad. To hit opposite field, try to turn your bottom wrist the other way. Turn might not be the best word to use, but I mean, when your arms move forward, almost keep your wrist in the same position for longer. Hard to explain. Obviously it is easier for an outside pitch that you wait on. Not sure if this helped. Good luck.    ADD: Maybe this wording helps. Try not to roll your wrists. It should be more like you are pushing the bat throught the zone, rather than swinging it. The head of the bat should stay behind your hands, as opposed to snapping in front of them. I think that helps describe it better...
AA11229410	Wasn't that Elliott Sadler?|`|f9sQQrs6aa	It was Elliot Sadler. He said that during the yellow flag that was caused by Jr & Vickers collision.. which caused him to take the lead.

I was having a major nervous breakdown. There was not a cloud in the sky here. My dad gave me play by play on the cell phone until the rain delay.|`|n55igpCUaa	That has to be Elliot Sadler.

Vjan4Vq2aa	I agree with you joshjo, but you got to remember that Americans are ignorant because they only like things they're good at. For example, when Michael Phelps won eight gold medals, the US started going crazy about swimming. When the US track team did horrible in the track and field events, they didn't really care about Usain Bolt's records. Since the US Women's Soccer Team is one of the best in the world, they like to show that off. There's nothing wrong with that though. But their is something wrong when the US don't show other sports (that are more popular than theirs) that they're not good at.|`|9Izy4meLaa	The answer is simple enough:  because the women's team has had so much success....World Cups, Olympic gold medals, etc. etc. Above all, USA loves winning, and loves winners.  The women have done that.  If one day the men start winning big trophies, they will get the plenty of love, too.  It's really pretty normal.....|`|slajusiraa	I agree with you! All we watch in the US is Woman's Soccer. I would like to se some Men's sometimes! I love soccer!!!!|`|o7gV56ngaa	I think it's been said. Americans only like sports that they can win. Let's face it Americans have a world series of baseball but they don't invite Cuban, Costa Rican or Japanese teams to participate. It wouldn't go down to well if Cuba was world series champions.|`|4JOG5qB1aa	They don't... All they do is show when the women win some big title. <br>  <br>  Soccer isn't as popular in the United States because of the popularity and starts of other sports in this country.  Due to the styles of other sports, soccer has stereotypes of being a bit weak and not as skilled.<br>  <br>  They're not really jealous of other players, they just don't care. Good athletes can be good in any sport.  If our athletes were focused on being soccer players, we would be one of the best, but they don't.  They go to the popular sports like basketball and football, that is why we have the best basketball players and football players.<br>  <br>  It's all about the popularity of the sport in that region.
Z8UV6S3baa	So, I don't know that there are "so many" opponents of 147 grain 9mm defense ammo. However, a proportion of the ones that are out there are vocal.    In general, 22 inches of penetration is considered to be alot. Even looking at a really big guy 22 inches is very much a clean through kind of shot.    The FBI has somewhat different issues than we as civilian self defense people do, but not so much. They are looking at hostage scenario issues, they are looking at urban (condo, hotel, apartment) environment issues, etc. So from their perspective it might be somewhat too much penetration. We as civilian self defense people have more flexibility in terms of our perspective about over penetration as an issue. If you live out in a sparsely populated area you might feel differently about it than if you are living in city.    Now, from the perspective of lethality, the flip side of overpenetration is reliability of expansion. For any controlled expansion bullet, what actually creates stopping power is almost, but not quite Kinetic Energy Transfer. It is wound channel. The issues are actually close. If you get a bullet to fully expand and then stay in the body of the attacker, then you have transferred the maximum amount of Kinetic Energy from the bullet to the attacker.    Now, if you have a bullet that reaches full expansion and still goes all the way through the attacker, then you have transferred the maximum amount of Kinetic Energy that the ATTACKER can absorb. So, that means that is the maximum lethality you can create for the round in energy transfer. Further, if you have a through and through hole which has expanded, then you have created bleed out scenarios front and back with maximum organ and tissue damage.    So, it ends up being a balance. Too little energy and you don't have full expansion and not enough stopping power. Too much energy and you have full expansion, but you have too much residual Kinetic Energy with the round after it exits and the possibility of injuring someone in the field of fire. Ideally, you have something that enters, creates full expansion, rips up whatever, goes out the back side making a huge hole and falls to the ground immediate behind the subject. Hard to do. Most of what I have read argues for penetration running at least 8" with full expansion and topping out at 15" with full expansion as recommended.    So, to close, a good quality reliably controlled expansion round in 147 grain 9mm is arguably a highly lethal round for 9mm. Depending on the brand you probably have varying levels of penetration, but most defensive versions are likely to have more penetration than you might want for urban or in - city defense unless you are running a very short barrelled 9. (Although in a short barrelled 9 it is possible they won't be as accurate as you need more spin to stabilize the round than if it were lighter) However, it certainly generates the energy and wound channel to make it a good "stopper" round.    Thinkingblade|`|WBGnXsr7aa	That would be over-penetration|`|mFa5ZDtcaa	The target.    Everyone is so concerned with penetration, velocity, expansion, etc.   They should worry more about actually hitting the target.     The FBI has become very anal about ballistics since getting their butts handed to them in the Miami shootout.|`|92jr44kFaa	22 inches it too much penetration for me.  A human body isn't that thick.  If I have to fire a weapon to save my life, I don't want the bullet to punch right through and hit an innocent bystander.    Penetration doesn't stop bad guys. What stops bad guys is something called Kinetic Energy Transfer.  The short version is that the bullet that stops inside the body does more damage than one that just goes right through.  This is why we have hollow points, and other types of fragmenting ammo - because they spread out when they hit, and stop faster.|`|f31934c5ab0ede56c2ad73c5a2c9979eaa	9mm 147gr was actually conceived for use in 9mm sub-machine guns (like the ones that are used by security at NASA sites in the 1990s) because they are so controllable in fully automatic fire.  Many departments tried 147gr in semi-auto duty pistols but experienced failures as far as expansion is concerned due to the subsonic velocity.  What works in test media DOES NOT necessarily get repeated in the human body!  There is no magic bullet and what you gain on one hand you lose on another.    Someone mentioned the Miami Shootout in their answer.  In the shootout the problem with the 9mm ammo used was that it was of light grain (115gr) and hollowpoint.  This is the last round you want in a gunfight involving automobiles (125gr. .357Magnum would be lousy too).  This shootout is why the FBI wanted something like a 10mm back then.|`|lT8MEI6Raa	Over-penetration. It doesn't have knock down power because it goes all the way through the bad guys.  If it stopped inside the bad guy, all of the energy of the bullet would be transferred, but if it goes through, energy is wasted.

AA11482019	Debra Miceli had been informed that the WWF was not going to renew her contract which expired on December 13, 1995 and she was being released. Miceli quickly signed with WCW and showed up on WCW Monday Nitro on December 18, 1995. She denounced the Blayze gimmick, threw the WWF Women's Title belt in a trash can, and reclaimed her Madusa moniker.|`|b1bb1949f6bd80a6b260437ca822b177aa	she got a better offer from wcw and did what her new boss (eric bischoff) told her to.  it wasn't uncommon at all back then for wwf talent to jump ship for ted turner.|`|EmUqxoN2aa	It was a time when they (WcW and WWF) held their "Ratings War," Bishoff did everything to make WWF look like crap, (including: revealing results and spoilers of the not yet aired edition of Monday Night Raw in his show WcW Nitro (on TNN). Nitro (live) and Raw (on tape) were on air in the same time slot.     In the first place Alundra did not want to drop the belt in the trash can, Bishoff thought it would be a great idea to humble the WWF one more time, however. So when she said that she wanted to ship back the WWF Women Championship belt to Titan Sports, he smirked  and said to her "No no no. I have other plans with that belt", she didn't like the idea in the first place, but Bishoff managed it to convince her to drop that thing finally in a trash can live on Nitro on December 18, 1995. The message Bishoff wanted to show was "Look at that thing in the trash can, it's the only place a WWF belt belongs." It turned out as a bad choice for her career, since Vince said after the incident that she's no longer welcome to wrestle ever again in the WWF/WWE, but Bishof had his way in this moment. The WWF Women championship/WWF Women wrestling division was a joke in this moment, so it took three years until the WWF reintroduced the Women Title, hoping the fans in the mean time did forget what Micelli/Bishoff did.    This incident also caused Vince to take away the belt from Bret in his very last WWF match by any means, because he was afraid that Bishoff could try to convince Bret to to the same thing as Alundra did two years ago, but this time with the most important belt of the the WWF, imagine what a humiliation for WWF... that's why Vince wanted Bret to lose the title in the WWF.

RjQLB9s1aa	I've not heard of tennis "contacts" but I have heard that Nike and Bausch & Lomb were co-develpoing sports "contacts". I understand that Federer, no less, was gonna try them, & see if they could make him see the ball better. They were also using a number of professional sports people to see if they could gain the edge.<br>  <br>  I would suggest talking to your optician will give you the best idea of what's available & what price. They will also recommend brand names & give you an idea of life expectancy of the contacts. As long as they are designed to enhance the colour of a tennis ball, they will be perfect for you.

Kobe also gets a standing ovation againts the knicks 2/2/09 after he broke the scoring record with 61.    During the Olympics, "Kobe!" Chants were loud too.|`|XLv4hhAnaa	Yes,  For Example:  2/2/09 Lakers V.S Knicks  ppl were chanting MVP for Kobe|`|L8bUjthkaa	When the Home team has players like Paul pierce, then it happens|`|AvxMhVGmaa	Yes, we like to cheer "MVP" when Matt Bonner goes to the line. : )|`|ExVTrokAaa	If you watched Laker road games last season or even the 06-07 season..you would have seen that Kobe got MVP chants In quite a few Road Games including Boston, Atlanta, Golden State(Oakland), Toronto, Phoenix, Sacramento, Chicago, New York...the List goes on!|`|0pbQg0Ohaa	Kobe never got that chant in Boston.|`|pgVxoM5xaa	I don't remember an "MVP chant" but as a Cavs fan, I've seen LeBron James get standing ovations on the road.

zczneZ7baa	i have no idea
LYZMK8tXaa	No to both questions. I dont have a tc badge and dont care if I ever get one. Half the people here who have one either cheated or stays on here most of their day. I come around when I have free time to ask a question and to hopefully learn something. which as been rare lately.    Edit~ Just got a tc badge(not that I care)|`|Caf5W9nraa	When did title not made in WWE meant anything??  Vince had never shown any interest to develop titles not made in WWE and not only titles how about the wrestlers??  Vince just can't swallow his pride.    Used to have a TC badge when I was around here a LOT but now I don't do the maths!!!|`|h9PVRHPWaa	I will play devils advocate and say yes. i think it gives them a chance to put a Main title on guys who have never held a big time belt (Nitro, Chavo, M Henry, hopefully Finlay). So yeah I think it has a good purpose. But will not be the equivalent of the WWE or WH titles.|`|0Dm3WEMcaa	It means you are good enough to lead an hour show that barely anyone watches... so not much.    TC badge means little IMO anyone can get one of these things regardless of knowledge.|`|h5lOMoqBaa	About as much as the US title, which is not very much at all|`|l0GWmWl4aa	Well kinda, I mean if you hold the ECW title, your the best of the show. But on the other hand, ECW basically now a televised wrestling farm with young guys like Jack Swagger, Ricky Ortiz, and Evan Bourne. If your wondering about the title history of the original ECW World Title, that ended with Rhino when the doors closed on the original show. The Title now is worth about as much the FCW title.|`|VBfhoqS3aa	ECW is like a televised develepmental farm.
LYZMK8tXaa	Nigel McGuinness. I think he should drop the belt to Bryan Danielson only because danielson is the biggest name in ring of honor and with them getting a tv deal it would be a good idea to put the title on him to hopefully get lots of viewers.|`|41WXZPnCaa	iT'S Niguel McGUinnes And Should Be Austin Aries|`|4c479c9c27bebd404d7ba657763fe54faa	It's my favorite wrestler - Nigel McGuinness, all the way from England! IF he loses his title, I think Tyler Black looks like a serious contender. Jimmy Jacobs, a very good wrestler, IMO but Austin Aries, I think, should get the RoH World Title belt next. A fantastic wrestler and lives and breaths RoH. A true role model for all wannabe RoH wrestlers|`|h5lOMoqBaa	Nigel McGuinness, and he should lose it to Danielson, if not Danielson than Brent Albright.|`|NNn84vTCaa	Nigel McGuinness. Who by the way, is getting stale! I like him, but come on, hes had that title since October 2007-ish. He should drop it to Tyler Black, im pissed that Aries and Jimmy Jacobs interfered. I called it before the PPV, Tyler would win the shot and cash it in! And when he did, his chances get ruined. Anyways, i'd like to see Tyler get another shot against Nigel at the next PPV, and win. I mark for Black, his Age of the Fall thing, i dunno, seems boring now..and i just wanna see him with the ROH title.
3o8jPdWQaa	He is a great performer but not the greatest. The greatest is a mix of each wrestling style: High flying, technical, powerhouse, submission, dirty, hardcore, crowd favorite and triple h isnt all those things|`|Ac8QOD7Saa	He is not the greatest but he on the list of greats.  In 5 more years, we might know how high he should be on the list of greats.|`|QB3LvbVaaa	No, you have him confused with Undertaker, He is the greatest|`|Cc4lc3qCaa	NO Ric Flair ~ 16 time champion|`|XYedFaUfaa	no hhh isn't the greatest wwe superstar of all time it would probaly be like ric flair, stone cold, or hulk hogan|`|6f41c712d34a30397cc9d83fa0a8d496aa	Hes one of the greatest but not the greatest.<br>  <br>  HBK=ROLE MODEL|`|gzRZlfpLaa	He is pretty close...id say he is in the top 5. First of all, hes not really married to stephanie....its a gimmack....like when vince blew up...then came back..come on people. Ric Flair "won the title"16 times......20 years ago....honestly, when there were 5 good wrestlers....He cheats to win too. Its not all about being the champ...he has won basically every relavant title,royal rumble,king of the ring...ID SAY THATS PRETTY GOOD|`|9Us6XYg8aa	YOU ARE WRONG.<br>  <br>  He only got the titles becouse he is with Steph.<br>  <br>  HHH sucks without Steph.<br>  <br>  It IS true.<br>  <br>  And if ya dont like my answer I got two words for ya.|`|H09OAJxSaa	the game is good but not good enough to be the best.to me the best is hbk.|`|6E16tR6xaa	Nah. But he's up there.|`|XRw2ux9waa	Like others have said, nowadays Title Reigns don't mean as much as they used to a few years ago, the 90's and especially not the 80's. There was a time when people who didn't even watch Wrestling knew who the World Champion was. But now, alot of people who do watch Wrestling, don't even know it. Because the title changes hands so much, it's only a prop now.<br>  <br>  <br>  If Triple H was a 13 Time world champion in the 1990's, than he would be respected alot more than he is now. Plus, whether it's true or not, a majority of Hunter's reigns are because he's married to the Boss's daughter. He has backstage power. When was the last two times Triple H was pinned cleanly? That's not because he's a good wrestler, it's because he's married to a McMahon.<br>  <br>  <br>  Shawn Michaels is a 4 time world champion, and he's recognized as one of the greatest of all time. Not because of championship reigns, but what he can do. There's more superstars like this too.<br>  Which proves the fact, it doesn't matter if your a 44 time world champion, if you can't do it all in the ring, and the mic, your not the best.|`|EzazmdpZaa	No! Even though I do like Helmsley, and he's in my top 5 all time favorite wrestlers' category, he is way overrated. I don't pay attention to title reigns that much. <br>  <br>  For Example: Edge is a 8 time world champ (4 WWE and 4 World Heavyweight). Meanwhile, Shawn Michaels is a 4 time world champ (3 WWE and 1 World Heavyweight). Now, HBK is obviously the better wrestler. You see what I mean?|`|uS8hK7Zhaa	In my book he is. But I will be the first to actually admit that I am biased, lol. I've only been watching WWE since 1999, so there are only three guys that could possibly take that place for me (Triple H, Steve Austin, The Rock). Triple H has been the one constant out of those names. I loved the McMahon/Helmsley-Era, I love DX, it all adds up to him being the greatest in my book|`|25HCZmPZaa	No way <br>  its out of 4 wrestlers<br>  Ric Flair<br>  Hulk Hogan<br>  Shawn Michaels<br>  Undertaker<br>  it diesnt mattter that they havent had the same amount of title rains but they hav dun so much for the company and triple h wouldnt be wer he is now if he didnt marry stephanie mcmaahon<br>  michaels vs undertaker wrestlemania 25 please!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|ULSUqmeZaa	No, not the greatest. I guess you can consider him one of the greatest but not THE greatest.<br>  <br>  just want to add<br>  jim_sox31 said that steph and hhh marriage is a gimmick. they are married in real life|`|zxEou7XWaa	No, but he is the greatest stategist, just like edge(kayfabe/storyline) he married the boss to get everything basically given to him.|`|22f82d8d45e6cb20bd3007cf1b7900f2aa	title wins dont mean as much now and he is married to the bosses daughter. That alone helps him get more title wins. <br>  <br>  He is great at what he does but he isnt the greatest|`|1JywgkyMaa	are you the biggest idiot of all time? anyone can be great if they **** steph mcmahon enough

t0PzSCs0aa	1. the night before, i usually eat some pasta. (i've found that if i dont do this, i get tired much faster and dont swim as well.) dont eat too much right before the meet, as you'll probably feel nauseauous if you overeat. i try to avoid sugar in the morning because it makes me crash.<br>  <br>  2. to stretch, i usually sit on the ground and reach for my toes and hold it. <br>  then i fold one leg in (palm of foot on side of knee) and lean forward.<br>   then i stand up and bend over to touch my toes.<br>   then i stand back up and pull one arm across my chest, through the crook of my opposite elbow. repeat on the other side.  <br>  then i lift my arm over my head and try to touch my upper back. i take my hand and pull my elbow toward that hand. repeat on the other side.<br>  then i swing my arms back and forth in front of me to loosen them up.<br>  <br>  3. i'm always nervous at swim meets and usually go to the bathroom a million times. i usually try to move around behind the block, swing my arms, march with my legs. it looks dumb but it usually helps me. once i dive into the water, i loose my nerves and just let the water carry me. <br>  <br>  4. keep your breathing regular. i usually breathe every 3 strokes on the first 50 and every 5 on the next 25 and only when i need to on the last 25. even if you are tired, dont brethe every stroke, you risk hyperventalating. (i do not have asthma, so not an expert here, breathe how you would in practice. try to keep your breathing steady, that is the most important thing.)<br>  <br>  5. try to keep yourself warm before the event. being cold makes your muscles tense and unprepared to swim. if you have the option, do a couple slow laps in a warmup pool beforehand. <br>  <br>  dont worry much, you will be fine. something i found that helps me alot is to think in my mind 'power, power, power' and my strokes seem to carry me further, 'fast, fast, fast' and i go faster. this mental stimulation helps me loads, especially when i am getting tired,.|`|wriAkyEHaa	1. eat something light right before, something like a banana. during the day before your meet, eat like you would normally do.  for me, it always helps to eat fruit snacks before because the sugar in them gives me a lot of energy. oh, and drink LOTS of water, all through the day.<br>  2.  when you warm up, take a few laps easy, and maybe a couple 50's at a moderate to fast pace.<br>  3.  as for the nervousness, don't stress about it.  hang out with your friends, laugh, listen to music.  when you're on the block,don't think about it, just do it.  Just swim as fast as you can, because if you've been working hard, then it will show up at the meet.<br>  4.  i completely understand about asthma, i have it tooand it's something you'll have to work through.  just make sure to talke your inhaler at the right time before your event (30 minutes before is always good).  since you're swimming the 100 free, which is technically a sprinting event, try not to breathe as much.  when you breathe less, you'll have less of a chance of you asthma effecting you.<br>  <br>  don't stress over swim meets at all, i used to all the time and it got me nowhere.  when you're relaxed, well nourished, and warmed up, the only thing you could possibly do to mess yourself up is to think about it too much.  just relax and go all out.|`|7rNM2uhVaa	eat pasta, pizza, or anything bready night before (tonight)<br>  then before eat a slice of pizza, or a bagel or a sandwich. nothing too sugary or unhealthy<br>  about the stretching, just ask a coach or teammate.<br>  before your race take a lot of deep slow breaths.<br>  and dont be nervous, the 100 is not a long race so you will not be in the water for long,<br>  and as long as you try your hardest, you should have nothing to be afraid of|`|BE5HlQseaa	eat;yogurt or fruit<br>  drink:water<br>  help:relax and deep breath know that you will do the best you can<br>  the 100 hmm... i would work on how often i breathe. trust me i just got over a cold one time and had to do a 200! good luck! swim hard!|`|U8lG8Ltjaa	breathe deeply<br>  eat bagel, but not too much<br>  drink water

sTyRRAeJaa	Well I was routing for the Cardinals, but the Steelers did play a good game.<br>  <br>  On the other hand I believe that the refs 100% screwed the Cardinals.  They should have called Holmes for his TD celebration, in which case the Cards would be 15 yards closer to the endzone.  And if they had actually done a booth review of the last play of the game, they would have seen the forward motion, and I honestly believe that Fitz would have come down with a jump ball in the endzone.|`|ubGNtkHQaa	They won. They fought hard and won.|`|jLM4Yo32aa	I think they deserved to win, but deserved a better team to play in the SB such as the Eagles or Giants.
sTyRRAeJaa	I played varsity all 4 years in high school.  The teams we played really varied in talent, so I can't say whether you'll make the team at your school or not.  <br>  <br>  As far as what happens in tryouts, you can expect a mix of conditioning (running and stuff) and hitting drills at the beginning.  After your coaches get a general idea of people's talent, they'll probably form a ladder and start having you play matches.  The matches are really what will determine whether you make the team or not, so don't worry if you embarrass yourself during drills.<br>  <br>  Just a little tip, if you're nervous when you start playing matches, don't even try to hit winners or anything fancy.  The other guys are probably just as nervous and will screw up if you just keep hitting the ball back.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  P.S.  A lot of high school players, even if they're pretty good by themselves, make terrible doubles players.  Since you've got a good volley, you could always team up with a friend and play doubles.  Two guys on my team were just average singles players, but they were an amazing doubles team.  Just something to keep in mind.|`|XpscG1m1aa	i was on the school team my freshman year. there were about 1000 guys in my school. we didn't have tryouts since there were not that many good players. it looks like u could make your team since most high school aren't very competitive in tennis|`|oC4Pd5K6aa	r u sure there is 250 guyssss in ur tennis class. cuz i never seen so many people in one school like tennis and this is all guys not including the gurls.i dont think u have a chance unless u r reallly good cuz to muchhh people|`|UV6K1mqtaa	hi, well, I am a girl, but I made the team & it is the hardest to make. Umm..I have been playing for a longggg time. But your groundstrokes seem good. Show the coaches you are something special. Know where to place your balls and remain consistant. Put your volleys at angles and try to put topspin on your strokes. They have you playing matches against other players. They don't have time to feed everyone balls. Also, work on your serve and try to serve in to the body or out wide. good luck!|`|SR04mlQQaa	Probably. Most guys arent that good. You sound like better than most. Tryouts consist of 30 minutes volleying along with assorted backhand techniques.
BXq8MZ8Zaa	yes, i think that aiming for anything in the 52 range would be a great goal for you to go for. heres a couple tips:<br>  <br>  1) this one's easy, just make sure your arms are locked in a tight streamline off your start and walls. those are the parts of your race when you're going fastest, and a loose streamline will cost you a good second or more over the course of your 100.<br>  <br>  2) NEVER EVER breath your first stroke off a wall or your start. this is almost like having a loose streamline. it kills your momentum off your walls and start.<br>  <br>  3) try to breath every third stroke. this helps your body maintain good balance in the water, as well as letting you see the people around you and where you are in the pack.<br>  <br>  4) on your pull, your arms should almost be straight. that way, you can catch water not only with your hands and forearms, but with your biceps as well. this is more tiring, so it may take some practice to hold this technique over the entire race. your fingers shouldnt be shoved together, since this will make this will make water flow around your hand. if there is a couple millimeters separating each finger, you will catch water much better.<br>  <br>  5) last but not least, kick. start out with a 4 or 6 beat kick (4 or 6 kicks per stroke) for the first 50, then whatever you have left coming home.<br>  <br>  sorry if that was a bit long. hope it helped. good luck! =)|`|uvBnCKgxaa	make sure you train really hard eat right and work on technique   for instance work on your entry and hand placement in the water and make sure you kick until you can't kick anymore and don't cross your feet when you kick. if you work like this yes you can. i am 13 and i have a 1:08 in the hundred free so i know you can do it. (and i have only been swimming for 6 months)|`|I1MAeetZaa	sure if you work really hard.<br>  work on starts and turns  they either make you or break u in a race make sure you get off the blocks fast and dive out not down. kick off the wall fast for your turn make sure you dont curl up into a ball.<br>  and never breathe in or out of the flags. or the turn whichever. so once you see the flags dont breathe then do your turn  take 3 or 4 strokes however many you can do and then breathe. it helps alot.<br>  <br>  i saw my friend go a 46 in the 100 free once. it was crazy|`|AA10214276	You'll almost be able to go to states if you get it that low.. As you drop time, dropping more time gets harder and harder. That is, dropping from 1:03 to 57 is a lot easier than dropping from 57 to 52. But I bet if you try really hard you'll make it.|`|U8lG8Ltjaa	what age group are u in? if ur in 13-14, then yes, u think u should. if ur in 11-12, maybe, but itll be extremely hard. if ur in 9-10, not unless ur super.<br>  8-and-unders? pfft. lol<br>  but if ur in 15-18, then yes, definitely.
WaaFCtuOaa	Just because they come from Wal-mart doesn't mean they a worthless.  I would buy a beckett guide & see exactly what you have & value of cards & then maybe rent a space at a local sports card show & sell them there cause you will make more money from collectors than selling them to a dealer which most don't buy cards unless they are pre 1975 or top dollar cards.  i have made a few bucks at card shows selling my doubles & team lots & good luck|`|q2KfJ4JDaa	Haha... baseball cards at walmart doesn't mean their poor quality cards.

DLxh9CANaa	I can't be a hundred percent certain, but I believe the horse was sold to someone- although who in their right mind would buy a horse like that with that kind of reputation eludes me. The horse was a stopper- that's what caused Reeve's accident, and any animal which acts like that is ALWAYS a liability. Like you, I never heard anything more about what actually happened to EE after the accident, just that he was sold, possibly under a different name. Even the Chronicle of the Horse, which is normally an excellent source of information about goings on in the performance horse industry, was EXTREMELY SILENT about this issue, and I am not certain why that was the case. At any rate, I hope that whoever bought the animal decided to use him for something OTHER than eventing- I have heard one report that suggested he might have made a decent dressage horse, with the right kind of rehab work. <br>  <br>  It's interesting that no one appears to know the answer to this question- but I do know that if this horse were still jumping, and had stopped again and injured or killed someone else, odds are we'd have heard at least something about it from someone. I never have heard anything, other than the rumour about his having been sold, though.|`|kK3uyS4uaa	Someone Shot Him , So They Had To Break His Leg.

It takes about 2-3 months for ATF approval and they never deny approval to anyone who fills out the forms correctly.  The word silencer is a legal term used by the feds and a marketing gimmick coined by Maxim over 100 years ago.  They are more accurately called suppressors. <br>  <br>  Contrary to what chuckbird8_108 says, two forms, photos, fingerprints cards and a check does not constitute a “crap load of papers”.  While you have to state a reason for owning a silencer, any reason will do, such as “all legal purposes”  and “enhance firearm collection”.<br>  <br>  A good ar-15 silencer is going to cost more than $500 plus the $200 tax.  Do not expect noise to be lowered to less than 130 decibels, but it should be hearing safe to shoot outdoors in the open.|`|RX5t6x6Haa	are you talking a real silencer or just a cosmetic one (one thats on for show and dont do anything?) IF you are in the states you will have to go though a crap load of papers, a background check, and then you'll have ot state for what reason you want a silencer for, if its just for cosmetic reasons, its fine|`|AA12243350	There is no such thing as a "silencer". Only a "suppressor". Silencers only exist in hollywood. To purchase a suppressor, go thru a class 3 dealer. There are tons of them.

Nh7f8Rojaa	lifting wont help your cardio as much as distance running or cycling will- but lifting is definately helpful in running, esp for sprinters like me<br>  <br>  you should lift after you run, cuz your body will be warmed up and there will be less a chance of injury<br>  <br>  if youre a sprinter- you need strong explosive muscles, so you need to do more heavy lifting, for powerlifts (squat, bench press, dead lift) a 5sets of 5reps (80% of your 1 rep max) and then for the other lifts follow a basic set-rep plan such as 3 sets of 10 reps or 3 sets of 10reps, 8reps, 6 reps- like one set of each.<br>  <br>  for distance runners- lift lighter weights and do more reps, do things like 3 sets of 20 on a light weight, one that you can lift 20 times without straining yourself
YKLcyWwZaa	I'm assuming you're referring to the USTA National Tennis Rating Program (NTRP).  The USTA website has an NTRP poster in pdf format to break down your tennis game to its appropriate rating.    In my opinion, the best way to know your NTRP rating is to play someone you know who is already rated in the USTA.  Your results vs. rated / league players will determine your true rating when you self rate.|`|3I6q9ZgEaa	Its can actually be pretty hard to determine what your real rating is and yes competing with others in the same rating is a good way of kind of determining where you stand but even that can be a little misguiding since others may also be confused what rating they are.    Also, I have heard of players playing in lower rating tournaments just so they can win more.     But if i had to guess most players who have some decent tennis experience i.e. played for HS team should be in the 3.0-4.0 range.|`|poEJEuwNaa	The USTA has a basic rating system. However it's kind of like the strike zone in baseball. What is written officially and how it is put into practice are two different things.    I will say this. You sound more like a 3.0 to me. I was moved up to the 3.5 level a couple of years ago, and I think the serve is the biggest difference. Until you develop a good serve, you would probably be considered a 3.0. Play your matches at that level for awhile. Enter leagues and tournaments and as you improve, the USTA will change your rating as necessary.|`|oXMT7Uqyaa	since im a junior, i dont rele know, but i THINK u have to play tournaments

e3m3rdNYaa	The current feud between Legacy and the McMahons is very similar to the DX McMahon feud|`|yEsw7UkWaa	TOTALLY!!<br>  And that's why I don't have much hope for it being interesting at all.<br>  Maye they will draft HHH to RAW and the whole "worst kept secret in WWE" (HHH and Steph's marriage) will be bought to light. Maybe WWE will use that to make the storyline more interesting this time. But from what I've heard/read Vince is not too keen on the Steph/HHH union being too public...which is why I don't understand him allowing WWE writers to use it as a storyline a few years ago.<br>  <br>  And the McMahon's as good guys just doesn't sit well. Steph is great as a fan fave, but Shane and Vince are just better as heels.|`|s4FIoGwmaa	This storyline is different.  That was a great storyline, but this one is too much and its retarted.

1a17e73a07a2c5ebb65e5750cb7c97faaa	Definitely go with Montoya in the first group.  Bobby will be on a satellite team for Yates/Roush and Paul Menard just isn't very good.  Juan should be better this year in a Chevy.  In the 2nd group I would go with Robby Gordon because both AJ and Sam have not locked up sponsorship for the entire season yet.  If you were going to take a chance in this group I would take Allmendinger for sure but Gordon should be better in his new Toyota.  Good luck!  4's FINE N 09!!!!|`|BhXMno7faa	I think you should take juaun montoya, aj allmendinger for your fantasy|`|mIdcJEJNaa	Montoya is in a Chevy this year..  Just think about how often he was   the top Dodge (none of them were   in the top ten .. Well not counting Newman)..  And Hornish will have a hard time making  top tens, and Almendinger already has.. Look it up..  I love Robby.. Robby is great, so much heart, but   those would be my choices.. check the stats at nascar.com, and get back to me... You just need to imagine JPMs stats in a Chevy..  BTW: Almendinger beat Hornish in every race they were both in.. Juan too..|`|OnXX13yCaa	fantasy is a game, why not have this question in the game section and leave the racing section to questions about racing?|`|7RUMbREoaa	Group 1:  PICK:Juan-Pablo Montoya(he has had flashes of brilliance in the past and will be in a Chevy this year with ECR engines-that should make for a heck of a combination)    why not the others?  Paul Menard has been less than impressive in his Cup career and it is my opinion that the only reason he still has a ride is because of his daddy's money and sponsorship.Bobby Labonte is past his prime and doesn't have that many great runs anymore.    Group 2:    PICK:Robby Gordon(I would have picked Allmendinger,but he is only guaranteed 9 starts this season.Gordon will be in Toyotas this year and has progressed quite well with his own team)    why not the others?  Like I said before,Allmendinger is only guaranteed 9 starts.Sam Hornish,Jr. can't keep his car on the track in one piece.|`|muc8sq9naa	Montoya and Gordon.

AA11388450	1. Any sort of even residual damage to coral reefs can be devastating. Coral reefs grow very slowly so any sort of physical damage can cause major setbacks within the entire coral colony.     2. If you touch fire coral you're in for a world of pain. Fire coral is commonly mistaken for seaweed but it really is coral and the effects are just like that of a jellyfish and the pain has been likened to poisonwood infection.|`|LlYAO0Zpaa	Coral reefs are made of hard and soft corals and both are living organisms. If you want to see how beautiful and alive a coral is you need to observe them at night when the polyps come out to feed.    The hard coral is the coral most people are familiar with when the look at the reef and unfortunately they get damaged by boats colliding with the reefs or dropping their anchors on the reef. People damage reefs when they pick coral as souveniers or break pieces off accidently when swimming by.     These corals take years to grow and form their shapes and damage by boats and people takes years to recover, if at all. This is why a lot of reefs are now protected and touching them is prohibited.|`|2RzOqHObaa	they sting sometime and they hurt like a bitt  go to www.myspace.com/codydcshoes|`|cd1b2cd9110fd18b756c043955cc66e2aa	Coral reefs are living creatures.  How can you tell if your touching is doing damage or not to the reef?  Some coral only grows a 1/4" per year.  If you break off a 3" section, that is 12 years of growth and development gone.    It is just better to not touch the coral, that way you are not damaging it.|`|92df82e95b3b1086d69d36994ca2effdaa	There are different types of corals, and the no touching thing is a blanket statement to make it easier for people to understand.  As mentioned above many hard corals grow very slowly, so any damage to a reef can take a long time to repair, but more than that the hard corals are their own little eco-system, and involve different organisms / microbes / algees etc.  And touching them breaks up the balance the oils on our skin or chemicals from our bodies can disrupt the delicate balance and once even a small part of it dies it can cause a huge domino effect and devastate that single coral and in turn the corals around it.      In some cases it would be like you getting a small cut on the finger getting bacteria in it and having it effect your finger / then your hand / then you arm and ultimately you die from it.   Or cutting one blade of grass and having your whole lawn die...    On the other hand / some soft corals are much more resilient.  And would be ok if you touched them / it would be more in line with going outside and touching a plant.  And yes there are corals that have defenses built in and will give you a nasty sting... one more reason not to touch.      And since most people don't spend a lot of time learning what's really fragile, what's OK, and what's like poison ivy, the general consensus is "Don't Touch Any of It!"    Keeps operators safe from liability too!
EtEf098yaa	This is a bad question to ask.  Mainly b/c Quinn played only a few games.  He could be good but he hasnt' played enough to get any kind of reading on him.    Flacco is a solid QB that doesn't make too many mistakes.  He reminds me of a better Trent Dilfer.  He's not going to blow the game for you, but I don't know if he's got the "we're going to win it because I said so" attitude that players like Manning, Brady, Manning, McNabb or Farve have.      Ryan on the other hand does.  He's got one of the stronger arms in football, and doesn't make mistakes, even on a team like Atlanta.  I gotta say with all the pressure he had taking over for Vick he did outstanding and I think he's going to be a top QB in the league for years to come.|`|O2jH0yVFaa	College  Quinn  Ryan  Flacco    Pro  Ryan  Flacco   Quinn|`|UxooffHZaa	Joe Flacco. Maybe it's just that the Ravens are a better franchise than the other two (Atlanta or Browns) but, that has a lot to do with how a QB will develop. So, I think Flacco will end up having the best career of the three of them.|`|tNerdFYsaa	1. Ryan  2. Flacco  3. Quinn|`|WPbwiGafaa	joe flacco because he led his team in the conference final unlikethe other teams did brady quinn didn't even make it in and the falcons got booted out first round against the Cardinals so i say joe flacco|`|1IGXttyaaa	Matt Ryan i think. he was amazing in his rookie season and carried the team back to an 11-5 record, after a 4-12 season.|`|scdOQ2CAaa	IF your best answer doesnt have MATT RYAN at the top then your a fool.|`|zii6IWHoaa	Ryan    Flacco took over a play-off team and did a good job of managing the game.

Flacco- he led his team to the AFC Championship- showed a lot of promise in his rookie year.    2. Matt Ryan- good solid quarterback who turned his team around    3. Quinn hasn't showed anything in his NFL career so far.|`|SEcM9EDZaa	Right now, Ryan and Flacco have the edge on Quinn by virtue of their strong rookie showings. Since Flacco is more of a game manager, ala Fathead Roethlisberger, I'd have to say that Ryan is the superior QB at this time.   Until Quinn proves that her can perform well at the NFL level he's the low man on this 3-man totem pole.|`|vEzeOt6Taa	just need points|`|e2b8bfe3611f18eb17768a4da504c095aa	Matt Ryan easy.

I'd say:    Flacco: He got to the AFC Championship, didn't he? I believe that's a record.  Ryan: He turned a 4-12 team into a playoff team  Quinn: He didn't even start.|`|C290wQWGaa	1 Ryan  2 Quin  3 Flacco    Ryan will be a super star!|`|jioRrEh6aa	JaMarcus Russel could crush all three of them at the same time with his man hands!|`|ERwZUst8aa	i can see this:    flacco will be the guy the guy that doesn't put up the greatest stats, but wins the championships. i see him as being the next generation's tom brady/joe montana.    ryan will be the guy that will put up great stats, but will take a while to get his long awaited ring. i see him as being the next generation's peyton manning.    brady quinn just needs to get off the browns as soon as possible if he actually wants career.|`|0f213e569404219f01d20decc3749462aa	Matt Ryan easily, if you have watched him play.

I actually dropped softball because lacrosse was more fun to me.  <br>  <br>  Softball involves alot of hand-eye cordination and if you have that down then you are pretty much good to go with softball. <br>  <br>  With lacrosse, you need alot of athletic qualities.  You need hand-eye cordination, speed, agility, and endurance to name a few.<br>  <br>  The equipment for softball would be a helmet, bat, mit, and gloves<br>  The equipment for lacrosse would be goggles, stick, mouthguard<br>  <br>  both sports are relatively easy to pick up and learn. lacrosse is much more fun to play though. If you have endurance and good hand-eye coordination, try lacrosse. I picked it up as a freshman in high school and ended up getting a college scholarship.|`|cOBPCgtPaa	lacrosse seems really fun.<br>  you would need a stick, shoes, and the head gear they use, which for girls its like googels. i cant think of the rest of the stuff you need.|`|ovf7pLvyaa	idk!<br>  <br>  but what ever choice u make gr8 job wanting to be active!....u know so young...you'll be THANKFUL when u get older!|`|pMhc2ywbaa	softball is an excuse for girls to feal eachother in the locker room...play lacrosse anyway....the cross country will help a lot...trust me

For an open Abu Dhabi style submission wrestling match, you may train without one.  Since MMA is so popular, almost ever American Brazilian Jiu Jitsu school offers a no ghi class.

4L8h8Rp9aa	I wouldn't quite say insane, but H. Ramirez, A. Rodriguez, and A. Pujols are all better. I would take Hanley Ramirez if he was available with the third pick. He is moving to third in the batting order, which means more RBI opportunities. He hits for a good average, good power, and steals a ton of bases. Plus, SS is a very shallow position (only like five good ones...)<br>  <br>  Ryan Howard gets a lot of HR and RBI, but he can have prolonged cold streks and hits for a low average. Plus 1B is the deepest position in the draft.You can get Teixeira, Fielder, D. Lee, L. Berkman, Youkilis a little later in the draft and still be in good shape at first base.|`|UoT86gbiaa	Insane?  No.  But you clearly don't want to win if you have Ortiz #2 and Howard #3 overall.  There's nothing necessarily wrong with having fun and playing with the guys you want, just don't expect to finish at the top of your league.|`|cWmx0J4jaa	yes, no matter what the league you play in, there are a few guys beter than R. Howard.|`|c9PHwfVMaa	You would be, lol. I suggest you pick either Albert Pujols, David Wright or Alex Rodriguez. D Wright will have a monster year and he stays healthy, Pujols will be Pujols, but A-Rod has a huge question mark over him. If he gets over the steroid issue completely, he will produce well, especially with Teix in front. Howard only gives you 30+ homers, 100+ RBIs, but very bad average among other categories.|`|kAznuRTIaa	I'd take A-Rod if he's available. Pujols is a great option but 3RD basemen are hard to come by that puts up A-Rod numbers. Plus it's a give-me that Pujols will be hurt sometime during the year.|`|aEwd0f5Waa	Take Pujols #3.  You'll know for a fact you can get .300, 100 R, 30 HR, 120+ RBI out of him.|`|ab9ef9910684477d4eba00561d668590aa	might as well you guys both have the  same name, idiot.|`|VNybWTs7aa	Yes all he gives you is homeruns and  RBI's.

v5MP0KJ8aa	Blair is a better offensive player than Thabeet. His skill set is completely different from Thabeet and he plays an offensive role on his team. Pitt looks to get him the ball so he can score. On the other hand, Thabeet is a defensive force. He is not UConn's go to guy on the offensive end but he is the anchor on defense. It's definitely a plus for UConn when Thabeet scores in double figures but most of his points come from guard penetration and rebounds. He rarely creates his own shot. It's offense verses defense and the other night, offense(Blair) won the match up.|`|YQLNqgnWaa	thabeet, is better overall<br>  <br>  that game blair was better|`|HEUsSBtnaa	they have completely different styles of play.

jBXutMblaa	The Goal. It might have been luck, but that's why it's more exciting.  Ovie himself said "Normal goal. Not sick," but it's in his Top 10. He had no look on goal and was on his back, while in The Sequel he had a pretty clear look on goal.  The best part of that goal was the bank of the boards to himself and the spin-o-rama around Hamrlik was the best part of it.  Either way, both goals show you he'll do whatever it takes to score a goal.|`|hX089rlnaa	I don't know. I heard everyone raving about the goal he scored yesterday so I took a look, and to tell the truth, it did not live up to the billing. He has scored other more amazing goals, and for that matter I have seen other players score more amazing goals.<br>  <br>  Ovie is certainly a phenomenal player, but I think people are beginning to over react to just about anything he does.|`|RLoilwCNaa	Neither. Rick Nash's goal against the coyotes last year was better.|`|URHdnHCpaa	coyotes|`|303dbc9a11680b5deb062fbc8e8ddba1aa	part of me wants to say its better than "the goal" because I saw it live and it was simply amazing.  I do think the that "the goal" was prettier, but more luck while this one wasn't quite as pretty but took more skill. The spinorama move was almost enough for its own discussion (who else can pass the puck to themselves??) so for now I'm going to go with the sequel.|`|i2jr2oJGaa	The Goal because he was on his back and I think the The Sequel is a bit overrated. it was still and amazing goal and a top 5 in the league this year for sure and in Ovie's career but it's just that he does something so amazing so often so it's hard for him to impress me. if anyone else did it, i'd be shocked. i say The Goal although i'll admit, what aim on The Sequel.|`|HEUsSBtnaa	i prefer the sequel.  i was not very impressed when i first saw the goal, but it really is a much better play.  he makes a great move to get the puck into the zone to begin with.

Q1MI6L96aa	You are going to be increasing the workload - miles - where you could comfortably run 15 miles in a single workout at any point on the calendar, popping usually a minimum of 70 miles a week and - in prep times - adding another 20-30 miles and then taking the next step if you show national class potential.<br>  <br>  It is too early to prep on a marathon training plan or to race well at that distance. Consider one after your senior year of HS or in the off season of a collegiate career.<br>  <br>  Check out USA Track & Field website, go to Road Running and you'll get a general idea of national class/world class competitions and competitors. These runners "know it" when they have a breakthrough or series of breakthrough races - typically at 25-30k to 10k - where they show potential to compete with the faster racers.<br>  <br>  Also, Track & Field News remians an outstanding means to cover the world scene. I popped a 2:50 when I was 18 and ran Boston at 19, but I was always a more endurance-type runner, even in HS....just keep progressing and never lose sight of your goals.|`|WrDGhduxaa	You should concentrate on shorter races, and move to the marathon when you are in college or after college.|`|3kaa5Vfkaa	Try creatine .....................it helps a lot with the training
85faaa69d9e3fef474608806f4554398aa	I like 4 or 6 pound Trilene XL green. Usually the water is a little stained so the line is less visible. I fished Keg Creek, 12 Mile and 18 Mile creeks off lake Ontario and a lot of the small streams in the southern tier lik Wiscoy, East Coy and Oatka Creek. Small spinners like Panther Martins or Rooster Tails, worms, power bait, plastic trout worms like Trout Magnets and even corn will catch trout. Just use enough weight to keep the bait bouncing near the bottom but still moving and you'll catch fish. Good luck and enjoy your fresh fish dinner.|`|uWulIssraa	hi i live in central new york and trout fish to. if your fishing a stream with lots of rocks that you think your gonna get snagged on i would go with 4lb test line but if dont think your gonna get snagged much i would go with 6lb test line. doing this should make your fishing a little easier! hope i helped|`|4qT0TfMZaa	For to six-pound test line will work well.  I've always had the best luck when using spinners such as Rooster Tails...the smaller ones seem to work better.  I've had excellent fishing on Cayuta Creek and Cayuga Inlet and Fall Creek.  It'll be time to go dippin' for smelt pretty soon!  Fall Creek's a good stream for that...|`|AA11016927	I have had my best luck with Power Pro 2/10 braided line with a leader of 4LB Flurocarbon. <br>  <br>  Works esp well in a stream with obstructions.(I've managed to land Brook Trout & Rainbow I KNOW would have cut me off!)  <br>  <br>  Not everyone likes Braid, but in many conditions where you need super-sensitivity, amazing abrasion resistance VS diameter, & immediate hook-setting due to no stretch, Power Pro and Berkley Fireline come in mighty handy.  <br>  <br>  Power Pro line costs approx twice what Berkley Trilene costs but (in my opinion) is worth the extra 5-6$.|`|1a17e73a07a2c5ebb65e5750cb7c97faaa	4 lb is the best for finicky trout but I tend to use 6 lb more often because of all the obstructions (rocks, trees/branches, weeds and so on) on the streams I fish.  The best tip I can give you is get away from the roads and parking areas.  The farther back in you get the more and better quality fish you will find.  Another tip is to use a #8 or #6 Tru Turn hook if you are fishing with nightcrawlers (I've never found anything they like better).  They stay on them well and the bend in the hook makes a good hook set more likely.  When I go trouting I travel very light, as I am usually covering a lot of ground.  My "tackle box" is merely an old plastic chew container with various size split shot and hooks in it.  I throw a pair of needle nose pliers and a stringer in the pouch of my waders and take a couple dozen crawlers with me and that's it.  Remember, the best spots are the hardest to get to and the toughest place to get your bait in will undoubtedly hold trout.  A big blow down with lots of branches will have a high likelihood of breaking you off but retying is just part of fishing where the fish are.  Learn to tie your knots quickly and correctly.  Good luck!|`|DYFDlCUiaa	I generally use 4 lb test, but you could go as high as 6. I wouldn't go any higher than that though. Blue Fox, Mepps, Panther Martins, and Rooster tails are good options.

L1O3O8pQaa	First off I feel for you kiddo. Next up she is your mom and as hard as it may be honor your mother and father. (It's in black and white...) Help her understand and enjoy it as much as you. Talk to her about it and explain...not whine and beg!...why it can be fun and healthy. you know the whole "get up and play an hour a day" thing. Besides kids have been playing cowboys and indians, cops and robber...ect...for YEARS! Just as well, how could you possibly turn into a psyco killer when you are loved and nurtured in life and have a healthy understanding of firearms. A majority of accidents from firearms occurs from ignorance and operator error. i.e. an individual has no clue what the working end of a gun is and what purpose it serves. And while I would love to pass that off as some form of Darwinism, I simply can't. I encourage firearms use, practice, knowledge and understanding. <br>  <br>  Look if something is made a taboo...take for instance alchol. In most european countries the drinking age is very low. Kids dont go crazy on booze and beer. They can get it whenever they want, no taboo, no problem. <br>  <br>  With weapons the story is a bit different than Beer. As you should be trained and instructed on proper use and practice. but it should not be a closed door to you or your peers. <br>  <br>  Airsoft is a healthy medium for the avid backyard plinker and folks with itchy trigger fingers who dont have a live weapons range. Also you cant kill yourself or anyone with it and they look pretty cool and are constructive in the way of safety, and heck just plain ole fun as hell. <br>  <br>  I own several big boy guns, AR, AK, 700P, HK UPSC, ect... I have no where to go shoot right now and I like to just have fun...sorry its a hobby of mine. I am not a crazy killer, a felon or a bad guy...Hadji may have a different opinion though he is in Iraq and I am here having a cold drink and answering your question. <br>  <br>  SO...contrary to the whole christmas story "You'll put you eye out!" situation I would say Airsoft is a cool, constuctive, harmless, and downright fun way to have fun with your friends. Always remember folks do get nervous around guns...even fake ones...Johnny Q. taxpayer can't telll a real gun from a fake one so be safe and be smart with it...BE RESPONSIBLE!!! that is the key point to push with your mother is your own personal responsibility to have and to bear arms in your own house...hahaha...sounds like a 2nd amendment speech! lol. <br>  <br>  She might just be like that because she is just that way...I had a cousin who we bought toys for occasionally and his mother would never let him play with them...no reason just her being a butt. in your case I dont know. It could be a money issue, fear issue...could be anything. You will have to try and get that out of her. be safe with that too. And whinning and being an annoyance doesnt help. Be a good young man and approach the situation with a cool calm collective head, a responsible head. be armed with all you facts, wits and savvy as well. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps you bud and good luck with an airsoft gun and your mother. <br>  <br>  P.S. After two combat tours as an Infantry Grunt, I am still a normal guy. Guess what, my family still cringes when I buy a weapon...just how they are, simple folk and they dont undestand. Doesnt stop me and they know I am capable of being responsible with all the boom sticks in my vault.|`|9bUxbTJAaa	if your old enough and have your own car she really cant stop you from trying new things.

QtiXWtEvaa	i Agree, with you here but have to disagree that, Pakistan will win easily, Srilanka is pretty good when it comes to test matches, Look at the mammoth total that Sri lanka came up with , made us think for a day that the Pakistan had lost it , but then a tremendous inning from the skipper Younis, of above 300+ runs not only saved the test but then the last day drama, showed that Pakistan might steal the show, now after this i do have every reason to agree with you that Pakistan might win the next test and win this Series. Anyway good test match from both Pakistan and Srilanka|`|IeNI79RDaa	Shoaib, I am supporting Pakistan but Sri Lanka are not a weak side. They will put up a fight until the last minute but I will still say that Pakistan has a better chance of winning. True, Pakistan have not played a single test match for the last 14 months but they have had many domestic games. Pakistan have found many new players and they are a new team! <br>  <br>  I think Pakistan will win the series but they will have to work hard! They will not win if they play like how they have been playing recently!<br>  <br>  The top 5 people I expect to perform well are.....<br>  1) Umar Gul<br>  2) Misbah-ul-Haq<br>  3) Kumar Sangakarra<br>  4) T Dilshan<br>  and especially.....<br>  5) YOUNUS KHAN|`|g5ugbabAaa	PAKISTAN WILLL WIN <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.nahmantv.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.nahmantv.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.nahmantv.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.nahmantv.blogspot.com</a>|`|G0lO7djeaa	It's not  easily, but pakistan will win and this is a test series not a<br>    one day.|`|AQrjyQZzaa	i hope so  as a cricket lover i love to watch pakistan in action after a gap of more than one year for tests.<br>  lets hope good|`|sO0KmaTZaa	Pak wins unless SL proves me wrong.|`|7oHt9fTkaa	no,that happen coz sangakkara declare his inning after reaching his century for give the chance to low order.if he bat continuously result may have been different<br>  <br>  edit-yea,i also have a doubt about top order batting and about spinners.but in SL team openers were pretty young players(Paranawithana and Warnapura).so we can excuse them.but the problem with Spinners.<br>  i think facing to a spinner depends on the courage of the batsman.If the batman under pressure of the bowler,he will easilly get out.but these young players from X1  didn,'t face M&M ever so they haven' nothing to bother about.I heard that Pakistan team is full with young players( i think 6 or 7),so i,m not looking forwar to M&M to do always the magic.<br>  Sometimes Vaas will be the key player against Pakistan(remember he is back after more than one year and eager to enter ODI squad.so he has to work hard to done it.)<br>  good luck|`|J7oFxMI9aa	My dear SHOAIB,<br>  <br>  I think it is quite improbable right now. It has to be seen how the green-horns tackle Mendis.<br>  <br>  Rehman<br>  <br>  EDIT: Pakistan team is known for strong comebacks provided they have the motivation. However, they have not been consistent.<br>  <br>  The new captain Younus Khan of Mardan could change that by gelling the team together.<br>  <br>  Its the Grade A team that has been problematic !<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  <br>  My dear SHOAIB you speak with good tahzeeb ! <br>  <br>  Sorry, I missed it. I am currently keeping in touch with cricket mainly via Cricinfo. However, what is your opinion about Afridi ?

I dont think so<br>  <br>  First up its a tour match and doesnt mean much, South africa lost theyre tour matches to australia state team recently but won the test series 2-1. Its just them getting a feel for conditions and trying out things like i said doesnt mean much<br>  <br>  The problem pakistan face is theyre morally down and theres pressure on them to preform after theyre fans have been deprived of cricket for a while. Being out of test cricket for a while will effect theyre preformance.<br>  <br>  Sri lanka to me look stronger in every department compared to Pakistan,<br>  <br>  I back sri lanka to take the series out on how easily they win? thats depending on how much belief the pakistan players have|`|Qq2MKeXUaa	Haven't heard much about Pakistan for awhile, so it should be interesting.|`|GGuXJJeAaa	I have no idea|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	no
yEsw7UkWaa	Ha<br>  Not with this batch of morons they've got holding the women's titles now!<br>  <br>  I would love to see WWE focus on girls like Natalya, Beth, Mickie, and Katie Lee. <br>  Put more spotlight on them and have the title pass between these girls. Take the focus off the eye candy until they know how to do more than 3 moves.<br>  Maybe the Diva title should be like a "in training" title? <br>  <br>  Once they do that, then we may have a chance of going back to the days when women had main events, and even a time when women were in inter gender matches and able to hold their own (like Lita used to!)|`|Ad8m1dYXaa	Lol, some of the people answering this question are idiots... I respect Lita, I really do, she was a revolutionary female wrestler and a good woman, and she was mis-treated HORRIBLY, but she is overrated by the fans... People have this notion that because her and Trish Stratus were pushed more than anyone, that they were great... Neither of these women were great, Lita was a bit of a female Jeff Hardy, very athletic woman, the first woman (in the WWE (which wasn't really all that big anyways)) to do the stunts she did, but she wasn't that great physically, she was exaggerated and a bit sloppy... <br>  <br>  Trish Stratus was just down-right the queen of overrated female wrestlers... She was a beautiful blonde woman with fake boobs, and the WWE went with her determination (which I respect and all), and made her out to be great... I respect the girl, I promise I do, but DAMN, if you ever need to look up the definition of overrated females in the sport of wrestling, look no further than Trish...<br>  <br>  Mickie James, Beth Phoenix "The Glamazon", Natalya "Nattie" Neidhart, and Melina, are all better wrestlers than Trish and Lita were. Don't believe me? Well, here is a sample of what Mickie James can do at her best:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15H-ymPfQ78" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15H-ymPfQ...</a><br>  <br>  I won't lie, Mickie James has had her spotlight, but this girl has worked eleven years to get to the WWE, has more athletic and physical ability than (arguably) any other WWE Diva, is considered a female wrestling legend outside the WWE (Indy’s, TNA, the world of female wrestling in general, all consider her a classic), is SEXY and considered to be the most beautiful woman in the WWE, but DOES NOT carry herself like a bimbo, and to top it all off, she isn’t afraid to make other girls look good in the ring... She has the greatest mic skills of all the WWE Divas and unmatched charisma. Did I tell you she is the most popular female wrestler the WWE have? Mickie is also considered to be the big thing for female wrestling in the WWE for this generation. The girl isn't even thirty years old, and she has ALL THIS under her belt. They have basically removed her from TV now, and yes, I know about her freaking injury, but they haven't even had her in one backstage promo for ages... She deserves more, even if she wasn’t injured, I guarantee you she would be sidelined…<br>  <br>  Mickie, Beth, Natalya, Melina etc. Are all capable of belowing the roof off of WWE arenas...|`|S0u3HKzhaa	Possibly but I don't think it will.The Diva's back then like Lita,Trish etc,seemed to be liked more then now.So I don't think that will be happening in the near future anyway.|`|1UKAho1iaa	I don't think so. They really don't have many divas who would be worthy to be main eventers, and the ones would be worthy never get the pushes they deserve.|`|M0aDAbbIaa	Since Lita and Trish retired, I don't think that will ever happen again. If you look at the divasnow, and the past divas, you can see that the past divas, like Lita and Trish, actually tried and weren't eye candy. <br>  <br>  I mean look at Kelly Kelly, what is she even doing in WWE? She should just get released and not come back. Maria too. <br>  <br>  Trish said the when she was in WWE, all the divas would try to get pushed to be in main events, and Wrestlemania. I was a huge fan of Lita and Trish, and still am. <br>  <br>  I hate all the divas now, they are disgracin|`|HcRhJ1yTaa	Rated RKO Owns,  thank's for speaking the truth<br>  <br>  I believe it's laughable  their are females wrestlers.  since  i never can tell if females can wrestle or not.. it's face it, they can't act, and is their any female wrestler who can out wrestle a main event male wrestler.. the answer is no, cause all they are good is looking good. it's laughable you use a word female in wrestling<br>  <br>  Really who pays to see females wrestle|`|lGO7XlyBaa	In my opinion, no, because WWE is a male-dominated business.<br>  <br>  EDIT: To "The Unknown":<br>  <br>  You're welcome.|`|1JywgkyMaa	since trish and lita left? hell no,not in a million years,never will be,not even close,survey says no,NO, uh-uh,never will be again|`|97jqpA54aa	hopefully but there will never be another Lita or Trish or Victoria and the Divas in WWE now would never make it|`|3o8jPdWQaa	Doenst seem like it because there wont be another Lita|`|T8IFOfHCaa	no|`|fmUGHvgHaa	maybe but if it happens it will be cool!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  edit: could you guys please stop giving me thumbs down ..^^^^that is my opinion..u cant judge it|`|6f41c712d34a30397cc9d83fa0a8d496aa	Well only if trish and lita come back thats the only way.=)

I usually bring a caping/skinning knife and a more robust knife hunting with me because the different knives have to perform different tasks. I am willing to invest good money on a blade that I can sharpen and care for instead of using something I would consider throw-away. I could simply use a box cutter to accomplish the same thing is the piranta seem to do. I have a knife from my father's hunting days still, a memory that something like the more modern use and toss could never be.

There are extremely knowledgeable fans here and people who are passionate about their favorites. I hope the companies take a hike through here....the writers can pick up good ideas.|`|7f2GSDmqaa	Never
SJlJtvhcaa	The trigger pull weight on pistols depends on the poundage of the trigger return spring, hammer/striker spring and firing pin/striker block spring as well as the mainspring. All of that sets the final felt pull weight. Some makes (Sig dak and Para ordinance lda come to mind) use a method to preload a small amount of pressure into the striker/hammer spring for subsequent shots after the initial first shot as the slide cycles back into battery. Those would be the ones that decock yet retain a lighter pull than the first. The glock releases all pressure upon firing, if you keep the trigger pulled through the recoil and slide cycle you will hear a click as you release pressure on the trigger. That click is the striker resetting on the trigger bar. It is not preloaded system.     On a revolver when the hammer falls it releases all pressure in the mainspring and because there is nothing that requires cycling there is no means for it to preload.     The pull weight on a revolver is decided by the trigger return spring and mainspring/hammer spring and there corresponding weight.|`|92jr44kFaa	I don't know about the other ones, but Glocks don't actually have a hammer, like traditional handguns.  They use a spring-loaded firing pin that is pushed back by the trigger bar before being released.  Thus, after the weapon is fired, it is decocked, because there is nothing pushing back on the firing pin until the trigger is reset and pulled again.  There is nothing to cock, really.

nuxhFHU3aa	I think they should draft a defensive end that can stuff the run and still be able to blitz in the 3 - 4 defense. No QB, go Free Agency for one|`|S71lfad2aa	I don't believe they need help in the defense part of the ball.  The defensive backs are good I would improve on the FS position but that is it.  on offense you could use another WR or a QB I would go with the QB Clemens and Ratliff might be good backups but they are not starter Material.  I thought Brett would get them over the hump but boy was I wrong but if the Jets get a franchise QB I see them making the playoffs.|`|s1Q9vnqmaa	I dont think Mark Sanchez would be around at whatever spot the jets have. 18th or 21st, but still mock drafts are saying hes going in the top 10.|`|Boc1Buuwaa	Huge Jets fan here, and your idea sounds pretty good.<br>  <br>  Jets cut Barrett FINALLY, Kassell, and Bowens on defense. Cleaning those linebackers out, probably means Ryan is bringing in Bart Scott, so that would eliminate any chance of an inside linebacker in the draft. If Rex goes defense, I would hope he chooses Tyson Jackson of LSU because that is a huge need on this team. Vontae Davis would be my next pick because our secondary needs another corner opposite Revis. Once Ryan picks up Scott from the Ravens, he will focus on smaller FAs like a safety (guy from the Ravens) Draft, im hoping he goes Jackson/Davis in the 1st and then Duke Robinson or Darius Heyward bay in the 2nd. I wouldnt be totally upset if he chose Knowshon Moreno either. Qb- he needs to bring in Jeff Garcia to compete with Ratliff and Clemens. Im not sold just yet on Ratliff, he only had a good preseason. If you remember, Clemens threw 3 tds in a preseason game a couple years ago and everyone was SCREAMING for him. Look what happened :)|`|gF6pgy8raa	I agree with you. I am a huge Jets fan and I like Ratliff. I don't know about getting a CB, but I do like DE, Tyson Jackson from LSU. He is a perfect DE for the 3-4. I think Vontae Davis will be gone by the 17th pick.|`|6bV4s2cgaa	I think your right but it is not going to happen. I see the NY Jets drafting  Mark Sanchez QB from USC because Brett Farve is retired. I just do not see Brett Ratliff or Kellen Clemens as a successful starting QB's.

Rpsm6XhLaa	one word. YES!|`|e4WhipTHaa	This year the NFL had the worst ref's in my opinion but the NBA is pretty bad.  Unless you are Lebron James, then you love them.  The NBA ref's have a tendency to slack off with the high profile players and let them get away with 5 step walks.  Where the regular players get called for traveling.    I agree with you, it is ridiculous!!|`|tY3rZSsiaa	the refs arent consistent and i agree with the guy that said the nfl was worse.  the nfl blew huge calls this past year.|`|BiMkowVMaa	M'eh.|`|G3EOBdLEaa	The thing that bothers me about the refs is their favortisom towards certain players and teams.  This is not fair a foul on Kobe should be the excact same as a foul on anyone.  The favortism is rediculous.  It's just like if San Antonio is down by 5 with 2 minutes left to play, and they miss a shot.  The refs will call a foul and give them shots just because of who it is.  This drives me crazy about the NBA.

x5lqWRT3aa	Because Toronto is of the bottom 5 of the top 5 to get the 1st overall. <br>  The way the draft works for the 5 worst teams is:<br>  Worst team gets more ballots. <br>  For example. If we used the current standings<br>  NYI<br>  ATL<br>  TB<br>  TOR <br>  OTT <br>  these are the bottom 5 teams, with the Islanders being the worst.<br>  So then the Islanders would get more ballots than any of the other teams.<br>  A simulation:<br>  NYI (10 balls)<br>  ATL (8 balls)<br>  TB (6 balls)<br>  TOR (4 balls)<br>  OTT (2 balls)<br>  And when they randomly pick the ball with a ballot in it, that means the Islanders have the greatest chance to get the #1 overall pick. And Sens having the least chance of having it.<br>  So don't worry, Toronto still has a chance at it.|`|KyaU4H1saa	The leafs will not get Tavares for sure even if they get last because of the Draft Lottery which has been introduced. The way the lottery works, is the worst 5 teams each get a chance in it. The 30th place team has the best chance since they get the most ballots in the lottery. If the Leafs were not successful in winning first in the lottery they could still finish second which would get them Victor Hedman who is looking like a promising defense man.|`|hz8YjsJPaa	They wont they will have to lose evrey single game from her and evrey singe team that is below them has to win|`|wlbM1Q9Raa	i dont want tavares here. he'll choke under the media. I dont think an 18 year old can handle the pressure|`|AA11184034	they dont have to be last to get tavares, but if u are in the bottom 5 u have a better chance of getting tavares and hedman.|`|w4DIPHf1aa	they don't..<br>  <br>  I believe the last 5 teams in the east play a lottery.....<br>  <br>  it's total random who gets taveres..<br>  <br>  but you need to be bottom 5 to be in the draw.|`|x9GODf8eaa	The way the draft works is that the bottom 5 teams in the standings are entered into a draw. The team that wins the draw gets the number one pick, which as of now is looking like it will be John Tavares. So in no way are they guaranteed Tavares, even if they finish last.
Vjan4Vq2aa	They play without the players that are away, which is practically the whole teams, so it gives some players who weren't good enough to play in the World Cup to play. However, there are usually no club games played in the summer, which is reserved for international competitions, like the World Cup, UEFA Euro, CONCACAF Gold Cup, etc. The only thing club teams might do are friendlies, but since the season is over, they won't be active as much.|`|IWM1khX7aa	Try to buy other players.<br>  <br>  Here's a list.

pX2ZraBVaa	this is a good question<br>  <br>  by stats manu is better....the only thing that ak has over him is blocks <br>  <br>  but heres where the problems begin to come....first of<br>  if u want kirilenko, have to keep in mind that he should have good numbers so long as boozer continues to not do anything....but once he comes back that might change<br>  <br>  on the other hand....although manu is good, he is injured right now and the spurs have been known to rest their key players at the end of the season in order to reserve their energies....not to mention that manus injury might be serious<br>  <br>  in the end,, taking ginobili would probably be the better idea but its best to think about it first<br>  if ur already in 1st is there any point to changing ur roster?|`|kAznuRTIaa	I would just due to the fact that Manu might be out for the season. The Spurs are waiting on what all the test will show. See if maybe you could get something better than Kirlinko though.
q2TOb6unaa	Out of the boards you named the Burton Custom is by far the best board you have mentioned for all mountain freestyle. It is stiff enough to do 50 footers, quick enough to slash through powder and still soft enough to do some jibs. <br>  <br>  Even if I were to recommend a board outside of the ones you named I would go with the Custom still just because I know it is a good board. Look up the reviews and you will see what I mean. I'm not a big Burton supporter but this is one the few boards they have made right.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps and good luck!|`|svEdo4FBaa	Get a Custom.  Normally you have to pay a lot more for a Custom than an equivalent board from another manufacturer (although in my opinion it's worth it) but right now you can get a 2009 for almost 50% off if you look around online.  <br>  <br>  If you're all mountain, doing big jumps, AND rails, there's probably not a better all-around board for you.  Most other boards are more specialized to one discipline or the other, but the Custom will do you right all over the mountain.

JFgf7EuBaa	the answers I seen so far suck. and if you think my answer is good plz show some support and pick best answer.<br>  <br>  But to be more agressive you need to work on forward punching, make them back up. Never take more then a step back, if you need to move than move to the side. When you got them moving back, stay on them and keep firing punches. <br>  <br>  Stay focused, and imagine punching through them when you throw. Make every punch count even the jab but do not neglect your speed. Other than that make sure you double up, for example if they are throwing a jab to find distance then step in and catch them with a double jab. Make them work harder and get on the defensive.<br>  <br>  One more thing I forgot to mention is cut the ring. Anticipate where your opponent will move next, and be there ready to catch them. You can feint to try and get them to move into a punch as well. For example feint a left hook so they move to the right and BOOM! throw a right straight. They'll walk into it. <br>  <br>  Everything else is hardwork and practice.|`|FTTPgxrzaa	You have to look at the person in the eye and imagine that they just did the worst thing ever to you or someone you absolutely love. Then you look at the moment you have as an oppertunity to just beat this person into a bloody pulp. <br>  <br>  If you really need to get into it do something like " this guy just just raped my ( insert person here ), now i'm going to kill him" then you just get in the moment and think about it like pay back and with that much agner you won't even think about how tired you are or anything it will just be hit after hit.<br>  <br>  I usually think about some guy that just messed with the girl i like then I go and beat the **** out of them. I have to get mad or else I'm afraid to get hit. But if i'm pissed off and in the moment I can throw so many punches that they can't touch me.|`|SoTQ4bmVaa	focus show your anger dont play mr  nice guy ps best answer please olny if this helped|`|ohgQoEjAaa	grow some balls
q2TOb6unaa	If you want the "best stuff" you can get or even just high end gear, you are going to need a bigger budget. A $400 budget will probably only get you a board and maybe bindings if you are lucky. <br>  <br>  As for the best rail setup the best boards would be:<br>  K2 WWW (with rocker)<br>  Rome Artifact (with rocker)<br>  Ride Kink<br>  <br>  For bindings:<br>  Rome 390<br>  Union Force<br>  K2 Formula<br>  <br>  Boots (depends if you like a stiff or soft boot):<br>  Nitro Team<br>  DC Park<br>  Salomon F20<br>  Vans BFB<br>  <br>  Out of those I gave you I would go with the K2 WWW (with rocker), Rome 390s and Salomon F20 boots. I'm guessing that will cost you about $500-700 but it is top of the line gear. If you still don't feel like dishing out more money then don't expect to get decent gear.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|HkwUGOmxaa	first thing to do is get a good fit and supportive boot.

You are going to have to drive.|`|5IyfWajGaa	airsoft huh...where did you find that at and how did you get your friends to actually play it?|`|UuknG7bJaa	There are no airsoft tournaments. In existance.       I know a bunch of people play near texas but best bets to google it.
G3EOBdLEaa	Shaq never actually broke the glass on the backboard he pulled down the basket by breaking the support beam.  Darryl Dawkins is best known glass backboard breaker of all time because when he played they didn't have the break away rims and all the support they have in them now.  Now they're pretty much unbreakable that why the glass didn't break and Shaq collapsed the whole basketball support system which is actually way more impressive.|`|GswnLKtQaa	Shaq used to break the glass during the 90's, I think he did it once and the other is when Shaq pulled down the whole court. now that's power!|`|vJyF8siJaa	Shaq during his orlando days twice & Dawkins during his phily days don't know how many but he was the original glass breaker. Both break glass with sick power dunks!|`|537b873668b83aa721d2aa3b05dd78c0aa	I only know of darryl dawkins
