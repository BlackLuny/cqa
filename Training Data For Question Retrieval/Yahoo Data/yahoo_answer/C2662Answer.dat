K2QwEM4raa	The breeder should have got only one puppy. Sounds like the breeder is most definably taking advantage and she will sell the puppies at 500.00 dollars or more. Talk to grandma! Grandma should have got all puppies except for one. Tell grandma to tell her to get lost.|`|PM23RDycaa	Well FIRST off unless your grandmother signed an agreement that she would turn over the litter she got scammed. As owner of the female those pups were HERS the breed was entitled to stud fee or pick of the litter(one MAYBE two pups)<br>  <br>  Cut off all contact with this byb. They are using your grandmother. Reputable breeders don't do this.|`|fgxajTiBaa	The breeder is definitely not morally legit, but not for the reason you are thinking.<br>  <br>  Does this 'breeder' know anything about your Grandmother's dog except the fact that he has a penis? Has your Grandmother had a brucellosis test done on him? What about genetic testing like CERF and OFA?<br>  <br>  Your grandmother should get her poodle neutered so this woman can find a 'stud' elsewhere. The woman who is using your Grandmother's poodle is what we on yahoo call a BYB (Backyard Breeder) which basically means that she is producing puppies for profit, with no consideration to the health of the puppies.|`|KvUJZa1Paa	As a breeder of 30+ yrs i have never heard of the female owner getting pick of litter, NO<NO< NO the stud owner get charged a set fee or gets pick of litter. tell grandma not to breed to that persons dog again she has the female and has to pay for vet bills for her should something happen stud owner doesn't.<br>  <br>  MY policy is when i breed one of my females, $1,500.00 or pick of litter or $1,000.00 and pick of litter never should female owner get pick.<br>  <br>  And no stud should come to female<br>  <br>  I would check this guy out to see if he is licensed|`|ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	Your grandmother is being taken advantage of.  No good breeder would behave in this fashion.|`|72iZuDjeaa	ohh,,, i'm sorry,,, your talking dogs here... well sometimes they are dogs too... never with me though... lol<br>  i will go back to men's health now ;-)|`|p7swtBYzaa	A breeder who uses a pet for stud --- unless that dog is a shown champion, tested, with checked out genetics - is a back yard breeder of the worst kind.<br>  <br>  Your grandmother should tell her to get lost, period, instead of adding to the number of dogs badly bred already - and dumped all too often.<br>  <br>  Unless your grandmother is the owner of a show champion, and the female is the same - neither dog should be bred.   If this is a case of dogs bred for the good of the breed, then a puppy in return for the stud service is quite the norm.<br>  <br>  From your questions, I have to assume that you know nothing at all about breeding and shouldn't be involved in it, unless, of course, your grandmother shows her dog.<br>  <br>  Sounds like just another greedy byb.|`|Rqb9gPN5aa	Your grandma needs to get her dog spayed and quit contributing to the over population of dogs.  This is NO breeder that your grandma is dealing with, she's another backyard breeder.  Her dog needs to be neutered.  What have the two dogs done to prove themselves worthy of breeding?  Do they have their breed championships/working titles, do they have all health and genetic testing done.  Your grandma needs to run as fast as she can from this person.  Who will pay the vet bills should your grandma's dog need something like an emergency c-section or incur other serious medical problems during her pregnancy or during whelping.<br>  <br>  Please take your grandma to your local animal shelter/rescue and show her all the dogs that are being euthanized because of backyard breeders.|`|cd731a89d8c493e5a2e82406e38dcdb2aa	Most of the time, it is best for the female to travel to the stud (on his territory). <br>  <br>  Personally, no I do not feel like this so called breeder is legit. However, if that is all your GM told her she wanted out of the litter, that's all she gets.<br>  <br>  The stud owner usually gets a stud fee or pick of the litter. If this so called breeder is keeping the female until pups are whelped, then your GM is more or less leasing her ****** out yes should be compensated. Again that all falls on the terms your GM and this other person agree on.<br>  <br>  Would I recommend breeding back with this person.....NO!|`|28834ea3162329035a24ce080e7020edaa	Well with the first, I would say since she got one of the puppies that was the fee. Did your grandma have to pay all the vet bills for her female? If so she got robbed, yes. <br>  <br>  I would not breed again, sounds like she needs/wants a litter and thats not fair to your grandma for having to just give her dogs body up like that.|`|Bw18seFqaa	some breeders do take advantage, yes.<br>  <br>  Your grandma probably thought she was getting some kind of "deal" on the price of her dog when she signed a contract and agreed to the breeder having breeding rights..  in the end, its costing your grandma more.<br>  <br>  REPUTABLE breeders do not generally do this.|`|LOoWwoMvaa	No! breeders should own their own female dog to breed. who ever this breeder is shouldn't be asking your grandmother to do that!|`|3EaFjsA8aa	The breeder is 100% taking advantage!!<br>  <br>  How do you identify a reputable<br>  breeder? First, know that good<br>  breeders don’t breed to make money<br>  —they don’t sell their puppies to the<br>  first person who shows up with cash in<br>  hand. Too often, unsuspecting people buy<br>  puppies from “backyard breeders” (or<br>  neighbors) who breed their dogs to make a little<br>  money or simply because they have dogs<br>  “with papers.” Too often, the result of such practices<br>  includes puppies with poor health or temperament<br>  problems that may not be discovered until<br>  years later. Unfortunately, these new pet families<br>  often end up heartbroken, with dogs who have genetic<br>  health problems or who develop significant behavior<br>  problems due to a lack of early socialization. In some<br>  cases, these problems can cost thousands of dollars to<br>  treat.<br>  <br>  How to tell is he is a good breeder:<br>  at a minimum:<br>  Keeps dogs in the home as part of the family---not outside<br>  in kennel runs<br>  Has dogs who appear happy and healthy, are excited<br>  to meet new people, and don’t shy away from visitors<br>  Shows you where the dogs spend most of their time---<br>  in a clean, well maintained area<br>  Encourages you to spend time with the puppy’s parents---<br>  at a minimum, the pup’s mother---when you visit<br>  Only breeds one or two types of dogs and is<br>  knowledgeable about what are called “breed standards”<br>  (the desired characteristics of the breed, such as size,<br>  proportion, coat, color, and temperament)<br>  Has a strong relationship with a local veterinarian and<br>  shows you records of veterinary visits for the puppies<br>  and explains the puppies’ medical history and what<br>  vaccinations your new puppy will need<br>  Explains in detail the potential genetic problems<br>  inherent in the breed (every breed has specific genetic<br>  predispositions) and provides documentation---through<br>  organizations such as the Orthopedic Foundation for<br>  Animals (OFA)---that the puppy’s parents and grandparents<br>  have been tested to ensure that they are free of these<br>  genetic problems<br>  Offers guidance for caring for and training your puppy and<br>  is available for assistance after you take your puppy home<br>  Provides references from other families who have<br>  purchased puppies<br>  Feeds high quality “premium” brand pet food<br>  Doesn’t always have puppies available but rather will keep<br>  a list of interested people for the next available litter<br>  Is actively involved with local, state, and national clubs that<br>  specialize in the specific breed; good breeders may also<br>  compete the dogs in conformation trials (which judge how<br>  closely dogs match their “breed standard”), obedience trials<br>  (which judge how well dogs perform specific sets of<br>  tasks on command), or tracking and agility trials<br>  Encourages multiple visits and wants your entire family<br>  to meet the puppy<br>  Provides you with a written contract and health guarantee<br>  and allows plenty of time for you to read it thoroughly;<br>  the breeder should not require that you use a specific veterinarian<br>  In addition to those criteria, you’ll want a breeder who<br>  requires some things of you, too. The breeder should<br>  require you to:<br>  Explain why you want a dog<br>  Explain who in your family will be responsible for the pup’s<br>  daily care, who will attend training classes, where the<br>  dog will spend most of his or her time, and what<br>  “rules” have been decided upon for the puppy---for<br>  example, whether or not the dog will be<br>  allowed on furniture<br>  Provide a veterinary reference<br>  Provide proof from your landlord or condominium board<br>  (if you rent or live in a condominium complex) that you<br>  are allowed to have a dog<br>  Sign a contract that you will spay or neuter the dog<br>  unless you will be actively involved in showing him<br>  or her (which applies to show-quality dogs only)<br>  Sign a contract stating that you will return the dog<br>  to the breeder should you be unable to keep the<br>  dog at any point in the dog’s life<br>  If the breeder you’re working with doesn’t meet all of<br>  these minimum criteria, The Humane Society of the<br>  United States advises you to walk away.|`|iXijnCxOaa	Depends.<br>  <br>  Did she get the b*tch from this breeder?  Did she agree to allow the breeder to breed the b*tch in exchange for reduced price?  Does the breeder co-own the b*tch with your grandmother?<br>  <br>  Sometimes breeders will sell breeding quality b*tches to someone who wants a b*tch and they can reach an agreement to breed the pup when she grows up.  Personally, I'm not fond of the puppy pyramid scheme but that doesn't mean that responsible breeders (and irresponsible ones) don't do it.<br>  <br>  Generally, its best for the b*tch to travel to the stud.<br>  <br>  Here's how a typical puppy pyramid scheme works:<br>  <br>  *Buyer wants b*tch pup, breeder only has a "breeding quality" pup available - sells pup with guarantee of a litter or a puppy back.<br>  <br>  *Buyer raises pup, pup is brought to the breeder who uses their stud for a puppy back (buyer now owes litter back PLUS a puppy back).<br>  <br>  *Buyer's b*tch has 3 pups - One goes to the stud owner (breeder), one pays the "puppy back" and one goes to the buyer.. assuming that the buyer didn't owe the whole dang litter plus puppy back.<br>  <br>  Yeah.. its a scam... but sadly lots of people fall for it... thinking that they will end up with puppies they can sell for $$.  (It really is a symptom of greed).|`|76qj8KP2aa	Your grandma got cheated.  <br>  If it were her male, yes, the pick of the litter or the cost of one puppy would be the stud fee, but from what your saying, you're grandma has the female dog.  The stud dog owner should only get one puppy or a stud fee, usually the cost of that one dog.  (ex. if a puppy is $1000, they bring the female to the stud, and the stud dog owner gets $1000 or first pick.)<br>  I wouldn't do business with them again.
cSOwqXKxaa	Definitely some kind of hound, probably pointer - my first guess of possible Great Dane on your original question is now dismissed.  Your dog may have some Dalmatian in him.<br>  <br>  Here is a Great Dane mix - notice the general head structure and legginess:  <a href="http://scdanerescue.homestead.com/PRECIOUS.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://scdanerescue.homestead.com/PRECIO...</a><br>  <br>  But I suppose my final guess is now a pointer mix, if not a Dalmatian mix - and maybe a little bit of everything!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.nodawayhumanesociety.org/images/D07403.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.nodawayhumanesociety.org/imag...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.meadowlarkranch.net/images/100_0738.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.meadowlarkranch.net/images/10...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.chesapeakewatersllc.com/images/big/docwit.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.chesapeakewatersllc.com/image...</a><br>  <br>  There is NO pit bull in your dog - I don't know where people are getting that from.

For breed recognition to really help tell you what your dog is, you need to watch the way he moves, bone structure, personality, what are the predominate breeds running loose in your area and then looks LAST.<br>  <br>  Head structure says Pointer, Setter, or Retriever, but could be Dalmatian. <br>  It is difficult to tell because the pictures are dark and I can only get a good outline of his head.<br>  <br>  I would need to see the length of tail, legs or any side views, of course a video would be awesome!<br>  <br>  We had the most beautiful litter of puppies come into our shelter once and EVERYONE talked about how perfect these pups were, such a fine example of the Labrador Breed and how could someone give them up when they could have sold them. Well these dogs had NO Lab in them at all, the were a cross of Weimaraner and Golden Retriever.<br>  <br>  Another time we had cute Black puppies and everyone was sure again they were Lab mixes. Found out they were Chow/Shepherd.<br>  So basically if you truly want to know, you can not rely solely on looks. <br>  There is DNA testing available. We had a cute Brindle pup that had Pit bull in it for sure. DNA testing came back as Pit, Lab, Bloodhound, and Schnauzer!!!!!|`|QE0U6iPKaa	Its really hard to tell cos the photos of the dogs head are dark...I dont think there is any great dane in it  because his paws seem quite small. May be there is a bit of hound in him.Although is he quite cute...|`|2l7lbcJWaa	I would guess German Shorthaird Pointer by his coloring and the shape of his head. He's so cute! I want him!<br>  It's very common for people to cross those two breeds for some reason.|`|DO2eXSzDaa	i would say collie or sheepdog<br>  <br>  he looks exactly like my dog! My dog is a lab/collie cross!
jA1nfMeyaa	Cavaliers are NOT hunting dogs.  They were bred as lap dogs, which is why they are not in the sporting group, but in the toy group.  They did originate from hunting spaniels, but the instinct to hunt has been bred out of this breed.  If it's chasing birds, it's not instinct, it's poor training.<br>  <br>  My spaniels do hunt and I can call them off birds and other game.  It's all a matter of training.<br>  <br>  If your dog does not have good recall, then you need to keep him leashed at all times.  Work on his recall, by rewarding him with something that is more exciting than the birds. This can be different for different dogs.  Some want food (cheese or little bits of hotdogs usually are enough for most dogs), others want a well loved toys, some just want your praise and affection.  <br>  <br>  Keep the dog leashed and expose him to birds and other distracting situations.  If he focuses on the distraction, pop the leash and command him to heel and watch you.  Be firm, but don't be harsh as Spaniels are a very sensitive breed.  When he obeys, sits quietly and watches you, ignoring the birds or whatever, then reward him with whatever he likes best.  Keep doing this until the dog learns what is appropriate behavior. The dog should always be leashed though if it is not in a secure and enclosed area.  It will only be your fault if his training fails and he runs out into the road while unleashed.|`|5BOV76bmaa	Shoot the birds|`|Ou1ZnDtAaa	You have to make yourself more exciting than the birds. <br>  Try getting a training lead and let him have the whole length of it, when he is distracted by a bird, call him to you and pull the lead towards you and offer him a treat or his favourite toy. <br>  Practise this every time you go out.<br>  When he has got the hang of coming to you try it off the lead and but training will take time, it won't happen over night.|`|44278221d0b910f7e2de63fcd827b10eaa	Have him on his lead. If he begins to pull/bark at birds, say 'No!' in a very displeased voice and splash him in the face with water, or sharply shake a bottle of stones at him. Do it each and every time he starts to bark and so at the birds.<br>  <br>  Alternatively, you could get a spray collar. If he started to chase a bird, spray the collar.|`|t4FBtIsTaa	Staple a plastic bird to it's nose, it will then only chase that!|`|IxR6Akpwaa	Cut its legs off|`|VkJqIiMUaa	Its his instinct, however you can train him not to.<br>  Do not shout at the dog. Its make him confused.<br>  Try to put him on a leash, and then make him sit when he is outside. If he dosent listen, ignore him until he wants your attention.<br>   Then say a simple command like his name, and then "no". <br>  (only when he is after the birds)<br>  (:|`|dH8woV7daa	mine is exactly the same, chases birds, butterflies and shadows.she is in our backyard though so it dosnt matter and she dosnt do it when she goes for a walk.she does chase them at the beach though but she always comes when i call her back.<br>  sometimes if a bird lands up high in the backyard she will stand underneath it and watch it's shadow and she gets all excited and it looks like she is dancing and then as soon as it takes off she is after it, its soooo cute to watch lol|`|5vFGO57Kaa	My springer is the same and i've even seen him catch one in flight!!  I don't think you can stop him doing it, but you'll just have to make sure that he's on a lead anytime when he could have an accident such as near roads or cliff tops etc.  I did hear about a Jack Russell that chased a seagull off a cliff, so it does happen.<br>  <br>  xx|`|lKbNLrRPaa	you can't. thats good. they are gundogs, and have to look at birds to see where they fall to catch them. he's just using his instincts. my springer spaniel sits in the garden watching birds for ages to pass the time. you have a problem with authority here. he doesn't respect you. demand respect!|`|RTCKiu03aa	he was bred as a hunting dog put a bell on his caller to let the birds know hes coming you can keep him tied up and walk him on a leash pull him back sharply when he reacts to bird saying no he will eventually get conditioned into thinking his behaviour is wrong but its lots of hard work
SfwLF8j2aa	I don't have a pomeranian,but I have a malti-pom (maltese/pom mix) He was super easy to house-train!

asEeCmzraa	One word: Boundaries. <br>  <br>  You need to block of the areas of the house that the baby is going to be in. Don't allow the dogs into the area where the baby is going to sleep, and where its things are going to be kept. Both your dogs sense that there is something about to change, they sense that there is an impending arrival that will disrupt the flow of things. I presume the Maltese is the lower ranked of the two, and wants you to know that this new arrival isn't taking her place any time soon. Your lab is less worried about losing its ranking, and is more worried about putting the Maltese back in her place. <br>  <br>  Make sure all doors are closed to the babies room and your room. You need to show your dogs that although there is a change coming, they can't forget their place in the family- And that is second to the people, and especially the new baby. When the baby is sleeping, make sure the dogs can't come near it. Make sure they know the baby exists(which they will), but don't give them access to the baby at all. Once the baby arrives and you have a routine again, the dogs should settle down.|`|ZYONnSk9aa	i think that because it is almost time for the baby that the dog thinks it is not getting attention. Or maby she is wanting to play and thinking they are her toys. My little dog does the same thing and it really gets me worried just like you. I found that putting a little baby gate (found at any baby/pet/local walmart) has helped keep the dog out of the things that are not hers<br>   <br>  congratulations on the baby and i hope that this helped|`|lKbNLrRPaa	maybe they had a bad experience last time the baby came over? put a muzzle on him.|`|9JdRuXiJaa	yes be worried|`|mTTPLly4aa	Your dogs can sense the changes as well as see the changes that are going on. Your maltese is showing a little bit of jelousy even though the baby is not here yet and your lab has taken on a protective roll, sensing that your wife is in a delicate state. <br>  <br>  I think that is a wonderfull thing that you are trying to make things work without getting rid of the four legged family members. Too many people get rid of their animas just because of the new baby.<br>  <br>  I think letting your animals know that their behavior is bad is important. I don't mean hurting your animals either. Try removing them from the situation when the bad behavior occurs. <br>  <br>  When the maltese gets in the babies bed take her out of the room and tell her in a authoritatiive voice that that was bad. Continue to keep doing it hopefully she will learn that if she wants to be in the room with you that she cant jump in the babys bed.<br>  <br>  When the lab snaps at the maltese for getting to close remove the the lab in the same fashion. Hopefully she will learn that if she want to be with the family she has to be nice to all the members of the family.<br>  <br>  When the baby comes this works in the same way. When the dogs overstep their boundries, just take them out of the room. If they want to spend time with the family they need to behave around the baby.<br>  <br>  Remember not to kick them out of the room for too long. You don't want them to resent the baby. Let them back into the room as as they show a sign of good behavior. If they imediately overstep things again then remove them immediately. Continue to do this. It takes time, but in the end if it works it wil be worth it for the whole family to live together happily.

C1eHfhrHaa	If you think there are more pups, then bring her in.  How many did the ultrasound say to expect?  It is not unusual for large dogs to have small litters, so no worries there, but if the pups won't latch on then you will need to bottle feed them at least every two hours for the next several weeks.  Before you do that, try squeezing the nipple gently so the colostrum comes out and put the pups on to the nipple.  That works sometimes.|`|PM23RDycaa	Take mom and the pups to the vet now.

GDB8ibEvaa	well i think a good thing to do would be to get a invisible fence its like a laser and you put it at every corner of your yard that you want your dog to go to but the thing some people dont like is that your dog has to wear a shock collar and if he tries to pass the line he will get shocked i used this for my dogs cause they jump the fence all the time and i have gotten so many tickets from it but i got the invisble fence and they stoped tryin to jump and eventually i didnt need to use the shock collar anymore because they know that if they jump they are gonna get hurt so thats the best thing i could think of hope i helped|`|xfJuyHoeaa	Tie him up while your gonna be away but when you can watch him carefully let him off the leash if he goes near the fence simply pull him away and let him know that's bad. Or you could plant some nice hedges around the perimeter of the fence. Do NOT do barbwire the dog will simply jump on it and get major cuts that would require vet attention. Good luck|`|2223829f0df37d8b96ea030121c582b2aa	I have a 3 1/2 month old German Shepherd Rottweiler puppy who loves to hop the fence we have.  It's about four feet tall (more than enough for our 8-year-old Pomeranian!).  How I keep her in the fence is just to teach her her boundaries.<br>  <br>  When he goes near the fence, just say "uh-uh" or whatever command you use when he's done something bad.  Or when he goes near the fence, call him to you and reward him with a toy/treat.  If all else fails, get a taller fence and bend the top in towards your yard.|`|N8C1p3sBaa	Consider spending more time playing with your dog.  If he is trying to get out of your yard, then he is not happy there - he is bored.  Running barbed wire will only cause your dog to get cut up and possibly lead to an infection.  He needs a daily routine as well as toys to keep his attention.  If you don't have the time to give him attention, consider hiring someone that can go over and play with your dog during the day.  The more you play with him, the more tired he will be, but also the happier he will be.  Reward him with treats for good behavior but scold him firmly when he leaps over the fence to let him know it is unacceptable.  If he is never reprimanded, he will continue to exhibit the bad behavior.  Another thing you could do if you can be responsible for two, is get another dog to occupy his time.  They will spend their days playing and wearing each other out, instead of trying to get out of your yard.|`|3wJGXfkKaa	My dog was jumping also we put electric fence around the top after a couple of time of hitting it he never did it again, so we unplugged it but left the wire there for a reminder after he stopped trying to get out|`|YUQgyPT3aa	BARBED WIRE???? you cannot be serious.<br>  <br>  Train your dog, hes BORED<br>  <br>  get a covered kennell / dog run area, taller fence (privacy fence is harder to climb thant chain link)..<br>  <br>  OMG...barbed wire<br>  <br>  BTW: Kevin: a "tied up" dog that likes to climb usually ends up hung to death on a fence from its own collar.|`|TBj0xAOFaa	You can get an invisible fence & attach it right to your existing fence. Your dog will get a static correction before even getting close enough to climb the fence that will not cause him harm like a barbed wire could.|`|lKbNLrRPaa	put an inflatable tube on the top. he'll be confused when he bounces off the fence.|`|asEeCmzraa	I have a BC cross who does the exact same thing on our 6ft fence, minus the actually going over part. It's as if he knows he isn't allowed, and is just biding his time till he can make a clean getaway. The dog's evil. <br>  <br>  Anyway, please don't put barbed wire. It will cut his legs up nice and proper, or worse, as you  said, his eye. You could try a rim of chicken wire or similar around the top, sloping inwards to he physically can't jump and latch. Depending on how much fencing you have, this could be expensive. <br>  For ours, we're considering an electric or citronella collar. He needs to stop jumping before we move, because our new house has hideously loud metal fencing, as opposed to less loud something or other dug in fencing. <br>  I wish you best with your delightful jumping dog. Mine's about the same age, too. What I fail to understand is he can haul himself over a six foot high fence, yet getting on the Vets table is more than his feeble puppy body can handle.|`|xEGB2rQ9aa	I have a border collie lab mix also.  (but she is not the one that climbs the fence. the terrier mix does) any way what we did is we found some electric fence and ran it along the top and the bottom of the fence.  my dog touched it once and stopped climbing and digging under the fence.  the barbed wire is not a good idea.  you were right in saying the dog could get hurt on the wire.  so NO BARBED WIRE. try the electric fence and see if it works.  it is also farly cheep.

NO bones are safe except raw.|`|PM23RDycaa	ALL cooked bones are dangerous. If the steak was heavily seasoned do not give it to your dog. Honestly don't give it period. Table scraps encourage begging.|`|oo2Hqqanaa	It's perfectly safe to give your dog the remains of a cooked steak, just make sure any bone is removed. Contrary to the advice given by vets, RAW bones should make up at least 10% of a dogs diet.<br>  <br>  Cooked bones should never be fed to a dog, the cooking process makes them indigestible.|`|x8Vgu6acaa	I used to be of the popular opinion that only poultry and pork bones were dangerous. and that beef and steak bones were ok.  <br>  Until I saw a Dobe get a T bone steak scewered into the roof of his mouth and start to hemorragh.  <br>  <br>  I will never give any of my dogs cooked bones ever again.|`|HyulW3aiaa	Wash off the sauces and spices.Too many bones are not good but now and then shouldn't be a problem.Chicken bones are a no -no.I usually cut the meat from the bone and usually give the softer bones not the hard ones.|`|iVQULHqYaa	All cooked bones are dangerous.

They splinter far easier, and T-Bones have sharp parts. <br>  Raw bones of most kinds(including chicken bones) are much safer and better. Don't give the thick bones, such as Femurs of cows and larger animals, as they can crack a dogs teeth. <br>  Throw the T-Bone away. If you want to be super picky, cut any leftover meat off, but it's a huge waste of time and effort on your behalf- The dog gains nothing but the association of you eating with food for it.|`|53622731f369055c74fe8948c7fb7ab3aa	I wouldn't say it is safe so if you do decide to give your dog the remains of a t-bone steak, watch him while he eats it. We have given our dog t-bone steak remains but watch her incase a small piece does get lodged in her throat. If you are going to feed her the remains, why not take the pieces of meat off the bone and put in in their bowl, that way you would not have to worry about having your dog choke.|`|bz9ab68zaa	Although I respect all the opinions posted and in some cases it may be true, we have had many dogs and have always fed them bones, raw and cooked and they have never had a problem with them.

Then I found out there were better foods to feed so I changed them to California Naturals Lamb and Rice small bites. Lamb is the first ingredient on the short list of ingredients it has.

It has corn, wheat and soy. It uses Animal fat and meat by-products. You dont know what kind of animal fat it is. It could be Anything! <br>  <br>  California Natural,Merrick, Wellness, Solid Gold, Chicken Soup and soo much more. Just look up more by going to www.dogfoodanalysis.com<br>  <br>  I know that Solid Gold and Wellness make small breed food. Oh and Eagle Pack! Yea. California Natural makes a small bite too..

Take 1/4 hydrogen peroxide and mix with 3/4 cup water, suck it up through a syringe or turkey baster, and can squirt it into the back of the dogs mouth, forcing him to swallow it.  Depending on your dogs size, he does not need that much of it.  Larger dogs probably need 2 turkey basters, where as a small dog like a jack russell only needs half a turkey baster.  Take the dog outside and within 10 minutes, the dog should gag and vomit whatever he ate, back up.  Good luck|`|7vJNHaskaa	Watch out for vomiting or diarrhea or not eating food. Anything happens along those lines and you should go see a vet. Good luck.
veDvtYhJaa	There are several things you need to check out before you can make a plan.  If you don't make a plan, you WILL end up putting this dog down as he'll be considered by SPCA to be a vicious animal.  <br>  <br>  Ask your vet to check him for brain tumors or anything else physical that could cause him to be so aggressive.  <br>  <br>  Put up a kennel in the yard so he has a place you can put him to keep the other animals safe.<br>  <br>  Make an exercise plan.  Both Boxers and Dalmations are high energy dogs and need a LOT of exercise, and it's quite possible you are not exercising him enough to keep him happy and tire him out properly. <br>  <br>  You need to go to obedience school with him so you can learn how to control him and teach him to follow your commands.<br>  <br>  You need to consult with an animal behaviorist to develop a plan because your situation is so severe.  Ask your vet for a referral to one in your area.  <br>  <br>  My neighbor's rat terrier attacked his 85# pyr teenager and wouldn't let go.  The pyr was being diplomatic and didn't try to kill him.  The other pyr grabbed the rat terrier gently by the head to try to pull him off.  Your parent's pyr DOES have the ability to kill the boxer if the boxer doesn't show proper respect for the pyr who MUST be the alpha dog.  Your Boxer mix is trying to take over as alpha dog and you must STOP him from acting this way. You are now living in your parents' home and you MUST force your dog to accept that he IS NOT and CAN NOT be the alpha dog.<br>  <br>  You must be a stronger alpha pack leader so your dog will obey you when you tell him "off" or "leave it" when he tries to attack other animals.<br>  <br>  If you have a bicycle, there's a special leash mount that can be purchased that will hold a leash away from the bicycle tire and allow you to exercise the boxer better by having him run with you as you ride on a bicycle.  Your 30-45 min. walk isn't enough for HIS needs. <br>  <br>  I'm 66 and I can manhandle a 109# female pyr or a 95# male pyr.  If I can, you can.  You need the mind set that "failure is NOT an option".<br>  <br>  If you're having THAT much trouble when walking him, contact Cesar Millan and ask to be on his show, or Victoria Stillwell.  Your problem is severe enough you qualify to be on one of their shows from what you have described. <br>  <br>  Meanwhile, get him evaluated by your vet.<br>  . . . . get the vet to refer you to an animal behaviorist.<br>  AND<br>  read the websites below and learn more about animal behavior and how to be a strong alpha pack leader.  Any dog you cannot learn to control, you should NOT keep.  I'll also throw in two websites that tell you how to train your dog as I understand you may not be able to attend obedience school, due to your current situation -!-|`|Ei85kgfdaa	Maybe I missed it but old is the dog? The shelter( i know he got sick) should have cat and dog tested him before you took him home.<br>  <br>  Where does he stay when he cannot be supervised? Does he chase your cats? You need to get him into classes asap. I would suggest you never leave him unsupervised unless he is crated. Leash him to your belt if you have to and give a correction just before anything happens like a chase, a bite, growl, etc.<br>  <br>  LOTS of exercise.<br>  <br>  ETA: okay thanks the info. Any owner needs to know their dogs body language and you must learn his. The second a cat walks in the room give a firm 'leave it' command. The moment he stares or postures you correct and redirect him. Keep jars of treats around, his focus needs to be on you before the cats become an option. Please get him into a class or work with a private trainer 1 on 1. A qualified trainer will be able to help him be fitted properly with a prong collar as well as show you how to use it correctly. Please look at this site and you can see how it is fitted properly. <a href="http://leerburg.com/fit-prong.htm" rel="nofollow">http://leerburg.com/fit-prong.htm</a><br>  <br>  This will help greatly IF you need to have him leashed to you, a prong(athough I don't suggest usually to be used indoors or for a prolonged time) could really help in this situation and also on your walks. But please get working with a trainer asap. Are you doing any work at home? Does he know any commands? What does he work for?<br>  <br>  If you must have him out and cannot have him leashed to your belt, ONLY under supervision, I would suggest a basket muzzle. HE can pant and breath well but bite down on anything.|`|01b9743a0b503849c2b30b5f6efcca49aa	that's a lot of material|`|o5RoMcbNaa	Cat lovers should visit this Micro Blogg.You can share phots,videos of your pets here....<br>  <a href="http://domoreforcats.flokio.com" rel="nofollow">http://domoreforcats.flokio.com</a>
nwMBfgcdaa	There are little health implications taking a dog home at that age.  The problem with taking them home at 6 weeks is that there is a TON of development that goes on in those two weeks.  Between the ages of 4-7 weeks, puppies are in stage 3 of development (see  the link for all stages).  It is sort of an overlap stage, where they learn a great deal about social behavior from their littermates during that time period.  They learn commuication, basic manners, and bite inhibition along with many other things.  <br>  There are no laws governing when puppies can be taken home here.  Before I knew better, I took my lab home at 6 weeks. He turned out fine. I did take him to doggie daycare.  I found that helped alot.  I noticed a difference in how approached other dogs to play.  Before, it was like he had no manners and would just run up and engage dogs to play, not always a good idea.|`|xxtrFHn6aa	the breeder didn't know what they were doing obviously because pups are supposed to be with the mom for 8 weeks. Report them.|`|O4jGlC2caa	May or may not be good.  Be sure to socialize the puppy and make sure it receives a healthy diet.<br>  <br>  If a person SOLD you this dog, you should report them.  In my state, puppies must be at least 8 weeks before being sold.|`|NbdZoxxQaa	8-12 weeks is better when it comes to getting a puppy because they are less dependent on their mothers then. I have known people who got a dog at 5 weeks, and it turned out ok. I wouldn't worry about behavior problems too much, just be sure to give him lots of love and get him in puppy classes or take him to dog parks so he can meet other dogs when he is a few months old.|`|SLSX6QQsaa	Some breeders give them away as young as 6 weeks but waiting until at least 8 is better.  My cat was abandoned at a very young age and is quite strange acting, for a cat.  We think its because he was without his mother at such a young age.  But now, you need to hope for the best and make the best of it.  You might catch him trying to suckle on your fingers or other household animals because he still wants to nurse.  My cat is 4 and still tries to suckle on my pinky!  Its sort of creepy.  Good luck.|`|jPBO4ABPaa	No, as long has he is eating food, show him love and attention. The only reason it could be bad is if he was not eating regular Puppy food. My opinion anyway.|`|heCOzxK3aa	Puppies should be ideally kept with there mothers for 7-8 weeks but I don't think it will do the pup any harm.<br>  My friends have adopted puppies from rescue centers at 6 weeks and they are doing great!!<br>  I doubt he will have behavioral problems.Any dog/puppy can have behavioral problems.<br>  If anything does happen go back to the breeder.<br>  Good luck with your new pup!|`|UE4WbmtQaa	yes that is very bad. your dog will most likely have behavioral problems if you don't socialize him right away. it is important for a puppy to have that crucial amount of time in its life when they socialize and learn pack dinamics from their liter mates.|`|mtOVRAnbaa	Whoever gave you that puppy at that young of an age was ABSOLUTELY horrible... Puppies should be with their mamas on a minimum of 8 weeks!!! I dont think your going to have behavioral problems but you need to be worrying about HEALTH problems!!

45N6tmWraa	Reconcile is approved/recommended for separation anxiety, and one of the listed side effects is aggression, as the medication can cause loss of normal inhibition.  However, fluoxetine (Prozac) has been used for a variety of other behavioral purposes.

I can pull the skin on my Weim several inches without him even noticing. They are adorable but I must caution you if you are considering getting this dog: They are a lot of work and need several hours of exercise a day. A big yard is pretty much a must. Although I live in an apartment, my Weim gets 2 30 min walks a day and a trip to the park to run off some extra energy because trust me, they have enough of it.

They may have a large location but treat their animals as friends and give them good food, good vet care and clean living situations.  YOu can be a breeder and only have one female and one male. Or no male but use the breeding services of a good healthy male.<br>  <br>    People who are considered "backyard breeder or puppy mills"  are normally just people who are in it for the money.  They don't care if both animals have bad genes and will produce sickly puppies. They normally don't even treat their animals humanely;  bad food, unclean living and limited or no vet care. They don't enjoy or love their animals unless they are putting money in their pockets.  These puppies that are produced from inhumane living situations, bred with defective DNA and have miserable lives are the ones that people get so upset over. I personally would not want to invest care and love in an animal that will die young or suffer because of it's bad start.<br>  <br>  It is possible to have someone who breeds a number of animals and does treat them nicely with good food, attention and good vet care and do produce healthy lovely animals and they do it for the money.|`|PM23RDycaa	ANYONE can be a licensed breeder, doesn't make them reputable.

Many licensed breeders are puppy mills.  The licensing is from USDA if I am correct.  And has nothing to do with good breeding practices.  <br>  7 different breeds is a good sign of it being a puppy mill.<br>  <br>  A reputable breeder is one who shows and heatlh tests their dogs.  Many are not actually licensed as they will only breed on occasion.  They are usually members of their breed club and many sign a Ethics agreement with their breed club.  This however is not an official license.  They will usually only breed one or two different breeds as the work and expenses involved with breeding quality healthy dogs is prohibitive to multiple breeds.
x8Vgu6acaa	I don't know.  I have always had mine returned to me the same afternoon or early evening.  In addition to your concerns, It is proven that the dogs recover better if in their home environment.  Personally, I would never leave my dog overnight at the vet for any reason unless they had an all night attendant in case of an emergency.  Keep checking. and you will find a vet who will let you bring it home.|`|eoOmeeJoaa	So that they can justify the exorbitant prices that they charge to spay/neuter pets.  I see no reasoning behind this else-wise, no one is going to be in the clinic all night and you will return in the morning and pay extra to boot.   Sounds like you really care about your dog so call around a bit more and find a vet that cares as much as you do!|`|tY14vbrKaa	I'm not sure.  My vet, if she's brought in by 7 am, and I haven't fed her since breakfast the previous day, I can pick her up after work.  It's not standard everywhere.<br>  <br>  Do what you think is best.  I think the "overnight" policy is simply to allow them more leeway with when they begin the proceedure.|`|MvX2Hg9Taa	If no one if even going to be with you dog then theres no reason...counting that you sound like you really care for your dog so if needed you could bring the dog back the next day to get a check up....My sister had her puppy spayed and he didnt stay over night....Good Luck.|`|5IcNNkkuaa	Some Vets hold them overnight, others don't. <br>  <br>  If you are worried about your dog being left unattended during the night, keep calling around to find a Vet who doesn't mind early morning drop offs, and late evening pick-ups.|`|oaD9mF9zaa	they need to stay overnight because if something is to happen like they chew at their stiches or ripp them out..the vet and assistants are there to quickly help rather than you have the animal while this occurs because it will take time to get to the vet so its easier if they stay there so they can be checked on and helped if needed.|`|LfZk2NGBaa	Mine have never had to stay overnight for spay.|`|5uLDqE0maa	The veterinarians that I have worked for all have the same policy. The main reason for the policy is to protect the pet from overbearing owners. Many times, owners will continue to check on their pet through the night and they are often not sure if the pet is in pain or not. It's best to let them rest in a crate (which you have-so that's great) and leave them alone as much as possible. Of course, I'm sure your vet would check your dog hourly during the day and before leaving for the evening. We have an emergency clinic close by and many clients would transfer their pet in the evening, since the main concern for most people is the pet being left unattended. It's pretty common for us to administer an injection of pain control first thing the next morning.|`|LSxBwiFSaa	It's just a Standard Veterinarian Policy... -One of the MANY stupidities of Life we All endure... :(

lhOd2hvXaa	You have started in the right direction, don't allow them to play with clothes or towels.    Places like Petsmart (and most other pet supply stores) allow you to take your dog in and shop.  This sometimes doesn't yield the best results because many dogs are nervous because of all the hubub in such places.  Go anyway, it's good for socialization.     There is a period of trial and error with most dogs where you buy different types of toys.  Some may go unplayed with for years.  We have a nylabone that has sat in our living room toy box for years and our 4 month old pup recently showed interest in it.  Wouldn't ya know that all of the sudden the older dogs in the house ALL want that bone that they have ignored their entire lives.    Good Luck!|`|Rr2D2POcaa	I let him choose.

3sB49YNnaa	It is highly unlikely that your son can infect your pig or that your pig can infect your son.  Stomach bugs are almost always viruses which are highly species specific.  There are a few bacterial strains which will cross infect pigs and people.  The only common thing to pass back and forth is the skin fungus ringworm.    The best protection to use against spread of infections is what they do in hospitals.  Practice  good hygiene.  That means lots of hand washing and common sense like don't cough on your pig or let him cough on you.|`|djjVYhWiaa	Yes, animals can catch viral infections from people.

qR3MYSOIaa	Domestic longhair and he's a gorgeous one at that!    "domestic" is the term we use for any cat with no known breed (a mixed breed).  It's an actual term when you go to the vet or buy pet insurance.      Most cats are "domestic longhair" or "domestic shorthair".  Your cats Mom had short hair, but he has long hair, probably inherited from his father.  If your cat had a specific breed, you would have paid hundreds for him from a breeder.  People don't tend to allow their pure bred cats wander around outside where they can get hit by cars, pick up diseases and mate with domestic cats or decide they like someone else's yard better and never come home.    I have 2 domestic longhair's.  One of them I have no clue what she's made up of but to look at her you'd think she was a Norwegian Forest Cat, but I got her at the pet store for $10 so I know that can't be right.  There's also 15 cats just like her wandering around in the rough part part of town...just not looking as healthy, and no Norwegian Forest Cat breeders for hundreds of miles..    My other one is part maine coon, and part mystery.  We just call him "Tubby"|`|45b08ca1dc880690ca7764657e05b376aa	He is just gorgeous ! He is a mixed breed. Looks like he may have a little maine coon in him.|`|iJtuhLMTaa	He is a lovely domestic long hair aka a moggie or mixed breed.           As far as the long hair long hair is a recessive gene so his short haired mother would have carried one gene for long hair and his father would have also had to carry at least one gene for long hair.|`|QQlbvWj4aa	he definitely has a face like a Ragdoll.   very cute :)|`|5RRMLzvzaa	He is just a long haired mutt cat, sometimes called a domestic longhair.      There really aren't many purebred cats in this world - they never took off in popularity like purebred dogs do, so the chances that he actually has some purebred something in him is slim.  Any time anyone sees a longhaired cat, they go "it must have maine coon in it!" but I don't believe that is usually very likely.  It's just a regular normal cat, as most cats are, mine included :)|`|gM7VuCM4aa	Since you know the mother was a black short hair, the father had to be a longhair with some silver. I can't tell from the pics if your kitty is black or gray. If he is black his color is called a black smoke, if he is gray his color is called a blue smoke. I'm thinking there could be some Maine Coon blood in there some where. He's very handsome!|`|AQsiugSpaa	Hi there,    Your cat is just gorgeous. What a beauty he is. It is wonderful to see a "senior catizen" in such excellent condition. It is obvious how much you love him, and I bet it works both ways.     Since his mother was a short haired black cat, apparently the daddy was a long hair. He resembles a Maine Coon, but of course, since he is a mixed breed kitty, he is a Domestic Longhair. More than likely his mother carried long hair genes as well, so this kitten inherited the long hair genes. I don't know about the rest of the litter, but I would suspect that some of them may have shorter fur.    You can tell your friends that you have a Domestic Long Hair cat!    You should really show him in the Household Pet class at a cat show. Here is a link to learn more about that:  http://www.cfainc.org/shows/hhp.html    I bet he would win many ribbons in competition!    Good luck with your lovely cat.

Say you would like a snake and when they say NO say you will settle for a dog then.
3p6wp7DYaa	There is a difference between marking and peeing. Which one is he doing? If he is not neutered, you should do so ASAP. Otherwise, it is a housebreaking issue. If your dog pees in the house, your dog is not housebroken yet, no matter what. You should never allow a dog that is not housebroken to have free access to the entire house. Crate training is the best way to teach an adult dog where he is allowed to pee/poop.     If you've had this dog for a long time and he's always peed in the house, you are in for a long, difficult journey. Your first step is to write down a schedule with feeding times and bathroom times. Make sure he goes out to pee every 3 hours at least. Get him a crate just big enough for him to stand up and turn around. From now on, he's either outside where he can pee or in his "den." Dogs do not like to soil their sleeping space, so that will teach him to hold it. Just make sure to desensitize him to the  crate before you lock him up, otherwise you'll just be adding to your problems.    Your second mission will be to completely eliminate the urine odors from your house. Remember, they can smell things in 1 part per million, so you have to use special enzymatic cleaners designed to do the job.    After your house is fully clean and the dog is used to being in the crate, you can start your intense housebreaking regime. Do not give the dog any chance to pee inside. He should have no freedom until he is housebroken. He is either outside where he is supposed to pee or in the crate. Remember to go outside and wait with him when it's time for a potty break. You should catch him in the act and reward him royally. Praise lavishly and give him a special treat that he will only get after he pees outside. If you get distracted and he pees inside, remember that this is your own fault. Never punish a dog for an accident. He does not know better, nor is he doing it to spite you. He needs to learn where his bathroom is supposed to be, and the only way he will learn is by several repetitions of peeing outside = reward. If you catch him just as he is getting ready to pee in the house, interrupt him with a loud noise and take him out immediately. Once he pees outside, praise and treat as normal.    Remember, constant vigilance, patience, and consistency are the only way to go when housebreaking a dog. An adult dog could take a lot longer to train than a puppy because he has had a long time to get the bad habits imprinted. So don't give up and never lose your focus.    Good luck!|`|QVP8zSuWaa	You my dear should house break your dog. Get your dog on a schedule, feed at a certain time and let him out at a certain time. Once you show him the correct way he will catch on.    BTW this question has been asked may times you can also research the Dog Questions for other helpful hints|`|RKQTD9Dhaa	First of all you need to punish him when he pees in the house.  He has to associate something negative with peeing inside.  I would scold him when I see him do it.    Second, you need to make sure you frequently put him outside to pee.  Praise him when you see him pee outside.    Is he neutered?  Unaltered males like to mark their turf so it will probably help if you neuter him.|`|tkqGwbtHaa	train him as if he were a puppy, i mostly agree with the other answerer gay crocoduck    i would also try to bell train him. this way he can let you know when he needs to go out, and it is very simple to do but you need to be consistent with it. basically, go buy a bell and hang it next to the door you let him out of, make sure it is low enough that he can reach it too. whenever you go let him out, ring the bell. then when he starts to ring it (even on accident or playfully) open the door and put him out. he will realize that the bell means outside.      if he is not neutered, do that asap. unentered males are not just peeing, they are marking territory.|`|0muoNffmaa	You have to catch him in the act, then tell him not to do it . you have to teach him where to pee|`|6Ehb9r1kaa	DO NOT STUFF HIS FACE IN IT ONCE HE HAS ALREADY LEFT THE ACCIDENT.

TD5DKXT2aa	Hi :)    Ok, If your hamster eye has turned red that means it is irritated by something. I know a dog that has a red eye because someone sprayed something in her eye and it is irritated. When you said it turned the other Color do you mean the other eye urned or do you mean it went back to the same Color.if other eye turned red then yes you hamster could go blind. Try and be carfulcarefulyour hamster and take it easy. If you feel like it take him the the vet and get him checked out. How old is your hamster? This could be he is old and is almost time for him to go. Try and take a damp paper towel(Warm) and wipe his eye.    Good luck  ?Hamster lover?|`|BaNrweQ4aa	maybe your hamsters eye had just been irritated by something; and it's gone back to normal because it had sorted it out itself. it could have just had sawdust or something in it - so therefore makes it turn red. glad your hamster is ok now :)|`|L75kWYehaa	Could have a bit of sawdust, or bedding in it and it is irritated.  The redness would indicate infection which has now obviously cleared of its own accord.

I would think about using Habitrail or Crittertrail (not Rotastak, it comes apart so easily) and connecting loads and loads of units to give them lots of space. That way you can spend money gradually too rather than buying a big expensive cage all in the onner. Get your cages online too, shop around and they'll be about half what you pay in the shops.|`|L4rlu2BDaa	You want to put 5 or 6 males hamsters in the same cage?? Dwarf hamsters are ok in small groups, 2 or 3 but never 5 or 6 males. They will fight for territory and you will likely find that 3 or 4 disappear, the bigger hamsters will have eaten them. If you want that many hamsters they should be in 2 or 3 seperate cages and should really be females, as they are less likley to fight then males.|`|yT6JNMdIaa	a very big cage! i suggest you get this one, its the biggest one I know<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.seapets.co.uk/products/zoozone-critter-home-dark-blue-large.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.seapets.co.uk/products/zoozon...</a><br>  <br>  Its a Hagen Zoozone 2 Large, the hayguard and troff arnt connected to the cage so you can take it out, its a brill cage! great if you wanna put a toy bridge in or hammock!<br>  <br>  I have the zoozone1(medium) for my 2 dwarfs, no-way can they reach top lid! but if you have extremely high platforms, you might wanna mesh it which some mesh sheets.<br>  <br>  They don't sell huge cages for hamsters, so any big cage is expected to have meshing on, good luck with your new colony!|`|1ZJxdMQNaa	The best size cage for a dwarf-hamster would be a dwarf-hamster size cage.

But as with any dog no child should ever be left alone with a dog, that is usually how most attacks happen. Pits are typically known to be good kid dogs and use to be referred to as the nanny dogs. I know many Pit bulls and not one of the 13 are bad wiht kids.|`|AA12128656	I have 6. and 2 kids (only one kid is mine, the other is room mate's)    Pit bulls, (ABPT's, whatever you'd like to call them) were originally bred as catch and hold dogs. Human aggression was a SERIOUS fault, and dogs who showed it were culled.     recent breeding has somewhat screwed that up (think all those "bully" dogs that the morons are breeding), but if your dog comes from a bloodline bred for good temperment, than there's no reason you shouldn't be fine.    it's important to remember that they must be trained kindly, and treated with respect, and not to let the children pester the dog. ANY breed can become aggressive to children, it is up to you to make sure that the dog is properly trained and socialized, and that it is always supervised while interacting with children, your dog will do just fine!!!|`|Q1GuJDuxaa	I use deodorant in my pits.|`|5IcNNkkuaa	American Pit bull Terriers were bred to be loyal, and predictable with humans, they were bred more to be wary of other animals.

My son came to us a couple years ago and asked if he could have his own puppy to raise since we raised all the other dogs.  We had a friend who just had a litter of pits.  We went over to see them and fell in love instantly.  When my son came home from camp he had  little ball of fur to take care of.  That was just a little over 2 years ago.  After helping our son train him he has become one of our best little babies.  He loves to lay on the ground and give you hugs (when you bend down to pet him he puts his paw around you and pulls you closer).  He has a tendency to talk to you at times and just is full of personality.  He has acclimated well with our other 7 dogs.  He gets along great with our cats and horses too.

A man in the suburb next to mine had a pit-bull that seemed to be fine, very well behaved, non aggressive etc. Then one day it bit a little girl on the head multiple times and messed her up pretty bad. It was sad because the little girl was hurt, and such a nice dog had to be put down. I have no idea why the dog did that. The owner thought it might have been jealous.    I personally wouldn't let kids near one unless masked, and definitely not unsupervised because its not worth it.    Well behaved pit bulls are excellent dogs. I hate it when people have aggressive ones, they are downright scary even for a full grown man. They shouldn't be allowed to have them if aggressive.

YpEswTQdaa	Hi.    Let me get this straight;Rabbits do NOT like to lay on their back.  Its incurable stressful for them,some people can 'Trance' rabbits,especially vets. Its done by gently stroking the rabbits face & the sides of his/her body,some people say its useful when examining the underside of a rabbit,however once again,its very stressful for the Rabbit. In the wild,if caught by a fox,Rabbits have been known to go into this 'Trance' like state,or if they see a snake,since snakes will not realize still animals. This a rabbits way of playing-dead.    So that's the reason,its not a good idea to do so. As when i have to groom the Cashmere Lops bellies i try & do its thoroughly,gently,but also quickly! However rabbits do 'flop' over onto their backs,when relaxed/sleepy,they never sleep on their back,tummy facing upwards though.    Hope this helps,xxx|`|XI2iylR4aa	My rabbit always tries to get onto her back, but she's too bottom-heavy!  I've never seen her lie on her back, but she has done the "bunny flop" a lot.      Maybe he just can't get the momentum to roll all the way onto his back?      Does your bun lie on his side a lot?  Mine didn't for the first few weeks that we had her, but once she got more comfortable, she does it quite often.  I think when they're all flopped out, they're just as happy as when they're on their backs.    Edit:  I didn't even think about the whole "trancing" aspect of things. I haven't tried to trance my bunny. I think she'd hate it.  If that's what you're asking about, I don't recommend it.|`|7PvHmwm2aa	I have honestly never seen a rabbit lay on it's back. My grandma has like 50.|`|SfUM9ZOcaa	when rabbits lay on there back they usually do it to scratch some thing or are trying to cool off     so if your rabbit is not on its back consider this a good thing it means that you are taking care of it|`|Gp80Zkbwaa	Maybe you just have to train it to do it. Just don't make it do it. Just love it the way it is and that is it.|`|CqQ1DaKDaa	Rabbits don't lay on their backs. They flop though when they are happy and want to relax, and some bunnies try and roll as well. Don't try and force your bunny on its back as if it tries to break free and kicks it can dislocate it's hips.  Hope I helped  Raych|`|nrPy4vwRaa	Teen Rabbit girl has a good answer for this one about the vet.   Also if you mean you want your rabbit to go into the trance and it won't do it for you that's a good thing. If not done properly a rabbit can actually break their backs kicking out of it, it's a dangerous thing to do if you don't know how to restrain them and I would advise against it.
TpOVmqpHaa	I love to help people with specific obedience questions, but there's no way to tell you 'everything' about obedience training step by step here on Y!A.  There are a lot of good books out there that will teach you the basics of dog training.  There are also numerous classes available to the public, either through pet stores, private trainers, even through county parks/recreation programs.  If your dog is a pup or is otherwise well behaved and friendly (ie not aggressive with dogs or humans), I highly recommend getting him into a group class.  The socialization is every bit as important as teaching him the obedience commands, especially for pit/bully breeds.  Good luck!|`|a4pc9S4Jaa	it really all depends dude on how u want him to be, but the best way to train one is to be stern with it, dont baby him/her, doin that will completely **** with the dogs head completely. punish him/her when he does **** that pisses u off or that annoys u so he/she knows no to do it again, use a deep voice when u command him/her to do something and praise him with a treat and pet him/her when he/she follows instuctions. but never get down on ur knees to pet him/her and never get to eye level when u pet him/her. (u can pet him/her when u guys are just chillin or w/e but never when he does somethin good that u wanted him/her to do)|`|3K2H4zB4aa	I started consistently training my 2 APBT's when they were just puppies and they are now very well behaved.

cnZlMojUaa	I'm thinking the testing was under $200. I put away all my dog's records when she passed away (not Cushing's related--she was negative for that) so I can't pull them easily. I would advise you to call your vet. Trust me, he will understand. It might be that a blood panel could help target what the problem is. A senior blood panel is around $75. <br>  <br>  I am sorry for your family's financial situation. The economy is hitting us all very hard. I was at my vet's office yesterday to have anal glands done on my dog. I was talking to one of the front office folks and she told me that the economy is hitting the vet practices very hard as well. Many people are electing euthanasia for their pets, even when they could be treated, simply because families can not afford the procedures and surgeries. It is devastating for the pet owners; It is really disheartening for the doctors--they want to help the animals. It is possible that your vet would be willing to work with you for the sake of your beloved dog.<br>  <br>  I'm not judging you. It sounds like you adore your dog. In this economy, none of us should judge--we can all be in your situation or worse at any time. Good luck to your doggie and I hope things begin looking up for your family.|`|49ec8e0944023c0f5c20e37484f16366aa	It's no reflection on you at all, and you don't have to disclose any of your financial situation, to call your vet and ask for an estimate.  People do it all the time for every kind of procedure, it's commonplace to ask for an estimate beforehand.  You can ask also about CareCredit, which lets you pay off the vet bills in monthly payments to make the cost more manageable.<br>  <br>  The cost will vary depending on where you live--what vets in your area charge for testing & medication.   Good luck.<br>  <a href="http://www.ygrr.org/doginfo/health-cushings.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ygrr.org/doginfo/health-cushi...</a>
9kTejB0uaa	Right off, there is a big difference between an 8 week puppy and a 16 - 20 week puppy.  The first being very very young, unable to control their bladder/bowels etc.  At the upper age, this should start to be less of a problem.  But the teething thing will have kicked in.      If she is 4 months, and, assuming you've had her from 8 weeks?, she should have started to get the message that she's not meant to do her toilet everywhere.  Do you have a crate?  I recommend you get one if you don't.  This at the very least, confines the outflow to one place and it's far easier to launder her bedding than clean carpets etc.  If she goes in her crate, feed her in there and it should stop.    You need to anticipate the need to go - after each feed, after a play time (you will see her switch off and look distant, and start circling probably), when she first wakes up, and many times besides.  They can go longer as they get used to 'holding' but for now, look to taking herside about every hour until she gets the message.  And when you do take her out, don't leave her to her own devices, stand with her and say 'pee -pees' (or whatever), or poohs (again, or whatever lol).  If she doesn't go, bring her in and crate her, and take her out again a bit later.  This should, if repeated, slowly get the message across that she just doesn't go indoors.    I have had 'stubborn' for years (hounds) and it does come down to a lot of work, but you can win!!|`|Rr2D2POcaa	I have a 11 month old Pitbull puppy, he used to do that as well. I usually just fed him and then took him outside and wait for him to find a spot to go. Always praise when she does. At first I taught him how to use doggie pads then go outside.|`|mWAxUYF7aa	for the poo take her out once an hour and wait until she goes to the toilet. DON'T LET HER INDOORS OTHERWISE,also say good girl and give her a treat hen she does go to the toilet outside, and scold her when she does it indoors.    If you is stuborn a SMALL squirt of water on the nose will stop any interest|`|AA12128656	she's not bad, she's untrained.  a pup that small shouldn't be allowed to wander your house.  she should be taken out every 1.5 hours, and NEVER let out of your sight unless she's in a crate.  if you catch her going inside, you can't hit her or freak out. say NO NO NO NO loudly and take her right outside.  it's YOUR job to potty train her!        ADD:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::...  when you take her outside, and she sniffs a place where she has peed outside before, praise her. after she goes potty outside, then reward her with some playtime!  if she has never pottyed in the place you want her to go,   you can put a paper towel with some of her pee or a little poo there for her to smell. (but there isn't one, right, because you were watching her!)     preventing accidents is the best housebreaking. it's a habit, and if the pup gets out of the habit quick, she'll be more likely to be well housebroken. don't expect her to tell you when she has to go. this is like potty training a human baby. you just take her there often, and praise her when she goes. she'll catch on quick.|`|qioH81tiaa	Um, train her??    If you want her to go in a specific area, then put her on a leash and take her to that area, every time.  She won't just magically learn this herself.  She isn't disobedient, she is untrained.    And a puppy obedience class sounds like a great idea for both of you.|`|RBtAn3b7aa	Well was the dog trained by its previous owner to use a pee pad? Or did they take them outside?  Your not training the dog to go outside, you have to train yourself to get up every 20 minutes or so and make them stay outside until they do there duties... Thats the best for you to try.. best of luck just the same!|`|aCqSF87Raa	She isn't "bad", she just isn't trained. Put her on a schedule - feed her at the same time each day, and only the amount noted on the beg (of course, broken into those three feedings) - and watch to see when she drinks.    She'll need to go outside after eating and drinking (this can be right after or 20 minutes after, you'll have to play around to see.) She'll also have to go out after playing, after naps, right before bed, and first thing in the morning.    Keep her contained in your general area so you can watch her. If you cannot do this (open floor plans, no way to gate off areas) then keep her leash on and keep her tethered to you. Watch for potty signs - sudden disinterest in toys, sniffing, circling, etc.    Look into crate training.|`|CkecSp4Uaa	Your dog is not disobedient, she is UNTRAINED.  It is YOUR job as the owner to teach her (ie training) what is and isn't acceptable.  Dogs don't come housetrained, it takes them a while to learn it.  There is a huge difference between 2 months and 4 months, but very rarely is a dog fully housetrained at either age.  At 2 months your puppy needs to be going outside every 2-3 hours to potty during the day and probably every 4 hours overnight (yes, that means you have to get up in the middle of the night to take the puppy out to potty).  By 4 months they are physically capable of holding it for about 5 hours tops, so during the day she should be going outside every 3-4 hours and probably no longer than 6 hours overnight.  If you can't take your dog out that often then you need to be prepared to clean up messes in the house...and NOT blame the puppy for your inability to get her out to potty before she can't hold it any longer.  As for keeping her from using your entire house as a toilet, she needs to be supervised AT ALL TIMES when she is out.  If you aren't watching her to see that she needs to go then you have no right to get upset with her when she does.  Tie her to your belt with a leash if that's what it takes for you to be able to keep an eye on her.
DFWvjolMaa	The limp points to broken leg, but the blood around the nose troubles me. I don't think this sounds like a tumour, as you say, she would have been poorly before now.    Could she have fallen somehow? Some kind of impact may have caused the bloody nose as all other signs point to this. My hamster broke her rib and behaved in a similar way. See that she goes to a vet (if you haven't already done so) as she will have a good chance of survival if this is the case.    Also, remove toys and anything she may need to climb from the cage. Move her water and food source close to the bed.    I hope she recovers.|`|HQ4PsETWaa	Or she has a tumer, a broken leg would not result in bleeding out of the nose.

CCLLnSrGaa	end all animal testing NOW|`|4c1e07d9ba0c2d099d9db46ee34af35faa	There is a lot of animal cruelty, there is no doubt about it. My big bugbear is the equine meat trade in Europe, it is without doubt the worst.<br>  <br>  When it comes to medical testing though, apart from rogue cases, there is no cruelty involved - it is a matter of whether you disagree with the principle. Animals used in experiments are very heavily protected by legislation and would never suffer the terrible treatment that happens to some 'pets' in private homes. They are always well fed and watered, kept clean and in a suitable environment and they are never beaten or tortured in the way that domestic pets and some wild animals are. If a drug for example causes pain and suffering, the animals are euthanized.<br>  <br>  It is not a comfortable thing to live with and I am certainly not an out and out supporter of experiments on animals, and have a raft of rescue pets, but I think you should take care when talking about cruelty. On the other hand, yesterday I was working in a hospital and met a seriously ill little boy, who despite his many problems kept smiling and waving at me. What do you think his mother would give to have him well, not full of needles and tubes?|`|47juxg0Yaa	Animal testing for make up is banned in England.

Your not a girl so I cant suggest you get your make up from the Body shop, but for things like shaving creams or shampoo, check to make sure the company doesn't test on animals.|`|sNVLiC4Laa	I understand exactly where you are coming from.  When I first read about animals in slaughter houses, I stopped eating meat altogether.  I have been a vegetarian since April 4, 1984.  I do not miss eating meat, but I have to admit I never liked the taste of any kind of meat so it was easier for me to do this vs. others.  I don't get on anyone's case for eating meat.  It is their choice.  There are companies out there who are trying to make it easier on the animals before they are slaughtered.  One of our volunteers (in our humane society) works for a company that sells products with meat.  She went to one of their "slaughter houses" (I hate the word slaughter) and she witnessed how they have made their "killings" more humane for the animal.  But these places are far and few between.  Getting involved with humane organizations and find out what you can do in your area through their websites, which are a great place to start.  HSUS (Humane Society of the United States) website address is HSUS.org.  Try that one - it is very helpful.  Click on the HSUS (America) logo located at the upper left hand corner (it is red).  Go the the online community and sign up.

4HAEjHkaaa	Sounds like you need a little bounce action.    Do plenty of grid work. This is a series of fences that are spaced only one stride apart. They are usually short, so don't be frightened. Doing this will force your horse to jump off the extremities of his hind end, rather than going for the jump in his forelegs. This exercise should build up your horse's hind end, resulting in more elevated gaits.    Transitions are helpful too. Not from a a fast gait to a slow one, but from a slow gait to a fast one. Try to learn how to transition into a canter from walking. Then try to transition to a canter from standing still. This works because the horse is using energy from his hind end and sending it to his front hooves, so that he can lurch forward and canter.    -Meg|`|SzW9GmRsaa	Lessons.

AA12128656	the problem is that you're giving him a choice.  you need to pick a food, put it down, give him 15 minutes to eat it, and pick it up if he doesn't. put it down at morning and night for 15 minutes until he eats it. when he sees that this is all he's going to get, trust me- he'll eat. so far he's trained you. he knows you'll give into him and give him something he likes better.    he's a dog, not a 2 year old child, and shouldn't be coddled into eating.    a dog will not starve himself to death, and it's not unusual to take 24-36 hours to "break" a picky dog.     don't feed him treats or snacks in between either.|`|426c98c5e6499e1f282c417b905cea60aa	What type of food are you currently feeding him?

If he still won't eat when kibble is his only option a vet visit might be in order to find out if there are any underlying problems.

The dog is actually being smart not to eat it if he can get something better. The food you are feeding is full of fillers that are difficult for a dog to digest and many dogs develop allergies to them. Read your ingredient list, and get another formula if you see corn, wheat, and fat of an undisclosed origin anywhere in that list. Switch your dog to a food that is rated at 5 or 6 at this website: http://www.dogfoodanalysis.com/dog_food_...    You can also supplement his diet with canned dog food. Canned food made by a reputable company is actually better for the dog than dry food. Do not feed canned Iams, Purina, or any major brand of dog food. Those are full of corn and other bad starches. Get a good brand and try to experiment feeding both a high quality kibble and a high quality canned food. Even though people tell you otherwise, dogs benefit from variety because it ensures that all of their nutrient needs are met and it curbs the development of food allergies.    Good luck!
RBtAn3b7aa	How long as this been happening? Is the diarrhea really stinky bad? I mean that sounds nasty and all, but if it were me and it was my dog, I'd take him to vet I had a couple of puppies awhile back that was throwing up and had the runs and stuff, and the next day by the time we were to get into the vet, they died just instantly it was so horrible.. They did an autopsy on the one puppy and it came back that they had E Coli.. Don't ask me how that happened cause it wasn't there dog food.. Best of luck you can never be careful when it comes to the lil ones really! Let me know how things turn out please!|`|qioH81tiaa	puppy, vomit and diarrhea - if it lasts more than 24 hours, or the pup is lethargic, then go to the vet.|`|KvUJZa1Paa	Well get off of computer and get poor dog to vet. I cold be anything from just something he ate to Parvo so he needs to be vet checked.|`|TiAK1629aa	Even if he's had all his shots, he can still have contracted dangerous parvo beforehand.  I lost an 8 week old pup to this many years ago, and she had her shots at 6 weeks.  Get the puppy to the vet, you don't have much time with one so little.  You need to find out what it is and get it resolved quickly.|`|e7e3a4238cb028d1871039a27332b65aaa	You should call your vet, they will tell you if you need to bring the puppy in or not.|`|UXnlET8Xaa	It sounds like your puppy has the Parvo virus.

Bw18seFqaa	a dog that will bite is a liability.<br>  <br>  It doesnt matter that the insurance lady was stupid enough to just put her hand out..  the dog bit her.<br>  <br>  An intruder can break into your home and sue you if he gets bit by your dog..  its happened before, and the theif WON the case!<br>  <br>  <br>  It doesnt matter that your dog is normally well behaved.. it doesnt matter that you told the lady to wait.  Fact of the matter is that the dog bit her.  It may not be fair, but that's the law.  The dog bit a welcomed guest, and is a liability.. the insurance company does not want to take that liability, and they have that right to refuse!<br>  <br>  You can look for another insurance company that will cover your dog.|`|ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	Sorry, it's YOU that was at fault.  If you knew the dog would bite, you should have him somewhere that they could not come in contact with each other.|`|9ea79964f4ddad1359a8089c6729bb4caa	It's your job to protect people from your dog.....did you tell her not to go near the dog? Did you instruct her not to go off the path? If you didn't do what you had to do to make sure your dog couldn't harm her, then you failed to responsibly contain your pet. Insurance companies don't want to insure someone with that kind of liability. If your dog were to bite someone and they were sued, it would cost them a huge amount of money, so of course they don't want to insure a dog that has already proven it is capable of biting. Legally, the insurance company can dump you if they feel you are a liability......you are at fault here, not them.<br>  Find a different insurance company and make sure to properly train your dog. A woman, that YOU invited into your yard, reaching her hand out is not a good reason to bite. Your dog needs training and socialization. I wouldn't insure this dog either.<br>  <br>  Edit: No, you don't have a fighting chance in court. The law is totally against you on this one. Even though the woman stuck her hand out, you invited her onto your property, therefore, you are at fault.....your dog, your responsibility. I'm sorry you feel that you've been wronged, but that's the chance you take when you have a dog. That's why socialization and training is so important, especially with such a big, protective breed of dog. This woman was invited onto your property, she made no threatening moves, she caused no harm and she was no threat yet your dog bit her.....count yourself lucky that worse wasn't done, such as animal control being called or you being sued for having a dangerous animal.|`|AA11828439	If your dog bites someone, it is ALWAYS your fault.|`|20244512d33d2e4edb6c55c4bcd03bbaaa	That is bullsh*t.  she should not have stuck her hand out.  you dog was on the leash so that is not fair.  how can you take away insurance because of that.  if it is not, it should be against the law.  I would beat her up.|`|C1eHfhrHaa	Most insurance companies will not even insure you if you haev a rottie and unfortunately, according to the law, she is in the right.

Doesn't matter the why or the how.|`|BWZ6pBoHaa	First of all, how cruel of you to chain up the dog, and you wonder why he's turning aggressive.  It's a known fact that chained up dogs turn aggressive and mean.  <br>  <br>  You are responsible for your dog, no matter what.  If he bit someone, you will have to pay the price.  In your case, your insurance company has denied you coverage.  You do know that many insurance companies will not cover you if you own dogs such as Chows, PB's, Rotties, any of these bully breeds.  That is their right and you have no recourse.  Did the insurance company know, beforehand, that you owned a Rott?  <br>  <br>  You have no legal rights.  The person who got bit is the one with the rights.  You could be sued by the dog bite victim.  So, if I were you, I'd pay any expenses that she should ask for, otherwise you may end up in court.  <br>  <br>  You need to find the poor dog a new home.  It is SO cruel to chain up a dog.  Why don't you have an appropriate fence and yard for the dog?|`|DOVbF4Piaa	You should have walked the lady to her car.  You said it was dark so she couldn't see where she was going.  Sounds like you are a lazy dog owner.  You will have to get another insurance company and hope they don't contact your old one.|`|OvFEyvU5aa	Yes thats what happens my land lady came over and we had a huge wrap around pourch the door was on one end and we had my Daschund tied on the otherend while we were cleaning she walked past a beware sign and petted him he bit her didn't make a mark 2 days later we got a medical bill and got kicked out of our house. If he just nipped her which is what he did then that was him warning her go i don't want you here a rott could have broken her hand easly if he had wanted to. Yes your dog your fault is what the law says i tried to take mine to court and walked away with nothing short of my dogs life the judge said the only way i can keep him is to have his k-9 teeth removed $500 out of my pocket and hes not allowed around people or out of my yard except to go to the vet and he has to be in a carrier take it while your ahead|`|Vi8RDbhUaa	Your Property, your Dog, your fault. Having your Insurance yanked is sad but you have to see it both ways. They don't want to have to pay a claim for your dog really hurting someone. <br>  <br>  I guess I would try to move my dog to another location for a while until it blows over. I would also install proper kennels if the Dog stays outside. Chained to a tree doesn't cut it.  Perhaps if you made your appeal to the insurance company with set changes underway  you may have a chance to win this.  Owning a Pet is a responsibility that you need to take seriously.  It's not enough to just think it's cool to own a Rottweiler.|`|YUQgyPT3aa	I have state farm, I own a Pit Bull...My agent told me they (state farm) do NOT require you to give breed info, on the questionnaire they ask if the dog on the property has ever bitten anyone.<br>  <br>  Since she technically (by your definition)did not suffer a bite, and it was not reported to the authorities, you can answer no to this question honestly.<br>  <br>  however, your dog did intend to bite this person and the owner is ALWAYS responsible for their dogs actions. <br>  <br>  good luck|`|Wo0AWgYVaa	This will be a tough one and I think you probably need to talk a lawyer...because you basically need to prove she initiated a improper behaviour to the dog and provoked him.  But from you said, she did not....going to say Hi to a dog in a judge's eyes is not improper behaviour.  And people will say even it's a guard dog, the dog could bark but should NEVER attack unless command is given.  Look at all the police trained dogs, they don't make any actions till command is given.  Personally it will be hard case to win.  I will suggest you if you want your dog to be a guard dog, try enroll a professional to help you.  This way, you can avoid further issues...such as being sued.|`|uoeDW6W3aa	i don't think it is your fault cause she knew what kind of dog it is and if they don't know you well they bite i would know i have been bite by one it hurt but it didn't bleed. so it is her fault.|`|3TdT5mG2aa	How about go to a different company for house insurance and train your dog properly? Yes, you can control what your dog is doing. With proper training, he would not bite people. Some people, like yourself, make stereotypes of certain dogs seem true. Even guard dogs, who are properly trained, will not bite. Since you have not been able to train the dog yourself, look up other trainers in the phone book.|`|qioH81tiaa	It is up to you to control your dog when there are people on your property.<br>  <br>  No excuses.<br>  <br>  "Guard" dogs do not bite every person they encounter.<br>  <br>  "Rotties" do not bite every person they encounter.<br>  <br>  Your dog bit a person you had invited onto your property.  Your fault.<br>  <br>  add: "He didn't mean any harm to her. ".  Um, yes he did.  Dogs mean harm when they bite, except for very young puppies.
eTlFtHseaa	Like you said, do a water change. However, your nitrates need to be under 20 not under 30. 20 is the max that it should ever be. Afterwords, you can start adding your fish. Only add a a few at a time. Wait about 2 weeks for the bacteria to catch up after each stocking. The amount of fish that you put in per bi-week should be around the same bio-load as:<br>  <br>  A school of small tetras<br>  a pleco|`|8N767l2Caa	It will be good to go as soon as you do the water change.Check to make sure you have changed enough water so the nitrates are below 30ppm,and start adding fish.Only add a few at a time.If you add too many too soon,the bacteria it took you so long to colonize and grow won't be able to keep up with the bio load.|`|a2cjwMKcaa	Do whatever water change you need to get the nitrate level below 30 and add fish right away.<br>  <br>  If you wait longer the cycle bacteria will start to starve and die off.<br>  <br>  As you have done a fishless cycle your tank should be safe for a decent number of fish. No need to mess about adding a couple at a time like an un-cycled tank. Get some fish in there :-)<br>  <br>  Ian|`|dJs2s9pfaa	Add 3-4 fish at a time. After a week do a 25% water change and you can repeat this process until you've got the amount of fish you plan on keeping. It is recommended 1" of fish per gallon so keep in mind the size that the fish get at adulthood.
AraBfesHaa	That's part of the cycling.  It's bacteria bloom.  The tank will clear up soon.|`|487pYnzraa	i used to have that but not till i bought a water puryfying powder.. it cost only a dollar and contains 4 packets.   yellow box and it sure help. if u cant find at ur place, go get crystal clear liquid and tat will help too!|`|fjkRIUSnaa	dunno try looking for a solution on the pet smart website|`|vvJBtxXHaa	yeah Katie is right, it is possible the bacteria are blooming, have yo uused some type of bacteria starter?  however....if you are working fishless, then it seems a little early for bacteria unless you have some sort of bacteria source, such as bacteria starter, live plants or possibly fish food flakes  ....I have kept a 55 gallon myself, for the past 2 years, and lost my bacteria twice due to power loss....usually the 55 gallon tank will cycle for 6 to 12 weeks, depending on the amount of filter medium and colony starter medium you provide  ...be patient though because the 55 gallon will be a very stabile volume of water once it is finished cycling and really easy to keep  ..10%-15% weekly water changes are all I do, and I use a submersible fountain type pump with a 25' hose to make that transfer even simpler  ....use water clarifier too, such as now, if you notice some immediate/rapid improvement then your problem is not bacterial and you can look for the source in something in the tank  ..did you recently change water filter cartridges?|`|6KsGSDh5aa	Normal and it will clear up.  Make sure that shrimp is in a bag and anchored to the bottom with a rock or veggie clip or it will stink your house up.|`|Jkt3UkTBaa	To be truthful, shrimp aren't the best cyclers.  In the first 3-4 days of cycling a tank the water is usually cloudy due to bacteria bloom or the gravel is flaking and so on.  Just let the filter clear it up.  I would recomend adding 2-3 zebra danios to that tank to cycle it properly.  Good luck with your tank and fish!!
86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	It's not the food that's the problem here. The loss of colour, erratic swimming, possible fin rot and developing swimbladder disorder all point towards a water quality issue.    Leaving water out does not make it safe, while chlorine evaporates, chloramine and heavy metals do not, using a dechlorinator is essential.     Is the tank filtered and heated? Was it put through the nitrogen cycle before you got the fish if it is filtered? Do a 50% water change, with dechlorinated water, and use some anti-bacterial medication such as Myxazin by Waterlife to battle the fin rot.|`|qyy3K51Jaa	Sounds like he's about ready to die, sry.  If I'm not mistaken, one of my betas I've had before did the same thing.|`|6KsGSDh5aa	You may have stressed him out with too large of a water change or cleaned so much you lost your cycle.    Water needs dechlorinator.  Many municipal water suppliers now treat tap water with chloramine instead of chlorine so letting the water sit will do no good.  That will knock out chlorine but not chloramine.|`|ta3wiCvtaa	As said before, it sounds like he has a swim bladder issue and possibly fin rot. If you have any aquarium salt, use it (NOT table salt or marine salt), and follow the directions on the container. He needs at heater set to about 80 degrees and stable. Cold water is very bad for bettas. Keep his water clean and warm and try not to cause him much more stress. A picture would really be helpful to diagnose any possible problems and give you proper medications. Next time make sure to use dechlorinator with your water changes. Does his stomache look swollen? If it does try fasting him for a couple days and see if his swimming gets any better.

D5wZLk6faa	Bettas are by nature aggressive fish. Betta males and females should not be put together unless you plan on breeding them. The flaring you see the male doing towards the female is all part of their mating ritual, which can get very brutal as he nips at her and she will nip at him also.<br>  <br>  The reason they male and the female should not be put together since you do not plan on breeding them is that if the female is not interested in mating with the male she will reject him and after continuous rejection the male will kill her. Since it is not your intention to breed them then you should remove the male or the female from the tank and never put them together.|`|pf5G6ssJaa	i breed Betta's.<br>  when the male flares at a female he bullies her around<br>  my male bullied my female around until she wasn't afraid anymore then  he made a bubble nest nd the spawned<br>  <br>  What he is doing is Natural|`|crSqd4MPaa	That's just what Betta's do they are fighting fish. Don't worry to much about it.|`|YglYUGJZaa	fighting fish are usually agressive. the gay thing is not because of that. He attacks the woman because that is how he tries to mate wth her. He flares up and gets angry when he sees another male fish because well in general, he's overconfident and sees the other male fish as an agressor. <br>  <br>  Also, fighting fish should be put in tanks by themselves.  Or require a place to hide whether or not they are being agressed. <br>  <br>  "Because of the aggressive nature of the Betta splendens species, tank-mates must be carefully chosen:<br>  <br>  Two or more Males: Contrary to popular belief, male betta splendens do not fight to the death in the wild; when one fish has won the fight, the loser retreats to safety.[citation needed] In an aquarium, however, there is no retreat, so the victor fish continues attacking the loser, often resulting in the loser's death, therefore, hobbyists rarely house two male B. splendens in the same tank unless they are (a) separated by a partition, or (b) they are from the same batch of eggs and are immature.<br>  <br>  A Male and a Female: In the wild, females stay clear of males, except during mating. When cohabiting in tanks, males might kill females, and are generally kept apart unless (a) they are juvenile siblings, (b) they are breeding, (c) there is a partition, or (d) the tank is large enough for the female to escape attack. Often, before breeding, breeders use a partitioned container to allow female display without risking harm by the male.<br>  Several female bettas in a community tank with mollies and rainbowfish.<br>  <br>  Two or more Females: Bettas are not schooling fish, but in a large tank with many hiding spaces, female bettas can cohabit. When two females share a tank, one usually bullies the other; however, four or more females will establish a hierarchy allowing peaceful co-existence. Nevertheless, females living in community must be monitored for aggressive females.<br>  <br>  Compatible fish of other species: Hobbyists put Betta splendens in tanks with other species after careful research and preparation. Common tankmates include platies (moons), Corydoras catfish, and loaches. Females can share a tank with danios, tetras, barbs, and gouramis, but males should not be kept with these species as they tend to nip at their long fins. Shrimp are popular tank-mates because, provided with sufficient natural plant cover, they keep the tank clean without causing stress to the bettas."<br>  <br>  I hope this helps. Bettas are just tepramental.|`|PqT6pQAoaa	Youre pretty dumb for thinking a fish is gay...<br>  This is normal behavior btw. Most bettas prefer not to see their own species.|`|ur5wDhkMaa	It's normal behaviour.<br>  <br>  In the wild the females live in streams and the males are left isolated in nearby pools. Basically it's one pool per male, because that's all the food available will feed. Hence males always fight.<br>  <br>  Come the rainy season food becomes more abundant and that triggers him to nest build. The stream rises and the females can get into his pool to spawn. When they have done that it's back to the stream. The only time males and females get together is breeding and straight after she leaves or he will kill her.<br>  <br>  If he could build a nest in your tank he would have a go at breeding, but if you have surface agitation and he doesn't have the plants to build a nest under he can't.<br>  <br>  She is a better swimmer than him, the bigger the tank the more chances are she will win the fight.<br>  <br>  Even female Siamese Fighters aren't exactly sociable fish :o)|`|5efcbc663b7fc36633fcb20f8ab06f77aa	they will still try to breed yes, and there should be more females than males. Breeders normaly remove the females after breeding.<br>  <br>  Some males will have smaller fins, so there is a possibality that is is a male as well,BUT he could also be displaying to her and trying to get her to relace eggs but pushing her and such, so they may not be fighting but love making.<br>  <a href="http://www.flippersandfins.net/faq.htm#tankmates" rel="nofollow">http://www.flippersandfins.net/faq.htm#t...</a>|`|dE5fs9yzaa	Bettas are always ready for a fight.

YnG0Tjxjaa	I am sorry to hear that. I have lost many pets in the past and I know how painful it can be. Try not to dwell on his death, but remember his life and how much fun you had with him and all the good times. <br>  <br>  And to all of you that are ragging about how the dog was not on a leash, take a second and think: "Jeez, I don't know the WHOLE story. Maybe the dog broke a window, or ran out the front door while some company came in, or jumped the fence, or the neighbor left the gate open". This guy is hurt, his dog just died, I'm sure he doesn't want to be guilted into his dog's death. Lay off.|`|tdQTZPI7aa	Yes next time be a responsible owner and keep the dog on a leash.|`|fgxajTiBaa	One of my friends lost her dog to a 'hit and run' a few months ago. It was absolutely the most tragic thing she has ever gone through. Her 2 year old watched the dog die while they rushed her to the emergency vet. Unfortunetely it was too late. I'm so sorry your dog died like that, it's always so much harder when you lose them suddenly. :(|`|bZhIEy1Waa	I'm so very sorry for your loss Jake, you have my utmost sympathy. There's nothing anyone can say to you right now that will make you feel any different, it's happened, it's the saddest event ever and it can't be undone. I could say that he's in a better place but would that make you feel better? No, i didn't think so. You will always feel sad and tearful when you think of last night but you WILL learn to live with it and cope with it, it's an old cliche but time IS a healer. Grief can do terrible things to people Jake so please talk to your family, your friends etc etc and let everyone know how much this has affected you so that they can look out for you, protect you from certain conversations re dog's etc, it's important that you let out your grief. Make sure you eat sensibly, try and sleep well and focus on building a memorial in memory of him in your garden? A rockery with a wooden cross etched with his name or a small corner of the garden that can be planted with flowers and bushes - somewhere you can lay flowers in his memory and on special days such as his birthday / anniversary / xmas? It'll help take your mind off of the nightmare that is going on in your head? Take good care of yourself mate, always remember the good times and try your hardest to shut out the bad, God Bless xxx|`|0I9Fm00Naa	Not much you can do after the fact, Just learn from your experience, and know where your dogs are and what they are doing.They only have the mentality of a two year old child so you have to watch them closely,Take them through an obedience class not only is it a learning experience for them but it will also teach you how to avoid this from happening to your dog's in the future. Just remember him and the kind of companionship  and love he brought to you. You just have to go on with your life with out him.|`|KxjUim7yaa	Very sorry. Many of us have lost a pet.

There are meadows and hills for all of our special friends so they can run and play together. There is plenty of food, water and sunshine, and our friends are warm and comfortable.<br>   <br>  All the animals who had been ill and old are restored to health and vigor. Those who were hurt or maimed are made whole and strong again, just as we remember them in our dreams of days and times gone by. The animals are happy and content, except for one small thing; they each miss someone very special to them, who had to be left behind. <br>  They all run and play together, but the day comes when one suddenly stops and looks into the distance. His bright eyes are intent. His eager body quivers. Suddenly he begins to run from the group, flying over the green grass, his legs carrying him faster and faster. <br>  <br>  You have been spotted, and when you and your special friend finally meet, you cling together in joyous reunion, never to be parted again. The happy kisses rain upon your face; your hands again caress the beloved head, and you look once more into the trusting eyes of your pet, so long gone from your life but never absent from your heart. <br>  <br>  Then you cross Rainbow Bridge together....  <br>  <br>  Author unknown...|`|qLb81FkPaa	I'm so sorry to hear that.

I cried for days. My advice would be try to put your mind on something you like. Also, if possible in the near future buy a pet to replace it, make a strong bond, and DON'T let it get hit by a car! Also, if you knew who it was, you could yell at the person who killed you dog, though that might not be the wisest idea in the world...|`|8f38917f28354b150fc3180e3404c810aa	oh my gosh im so sorry for your loss. i've never had a dog die, but i wish that you stay strong and get threw this and believe your dog is in a better place where no harm can get it. if you ever feel really sad look threw pictures of him and you can always talk to him, your love is like the wind you can't see it but you can feel it- a walk to remember- but i give best hopes and wishes to you and your dog im truly sorry for you and your loss|`|ZotbP52paa	I'm so sorry. And, yes, it has happened to me before. My kitten was ran over. Try to get a new dog, I know it's easy to think that if you get a new pet than you'll forget about the other one and lose him in your heart, but, trust me, you'll never forget him.

0m6BgESXaa	Why is it you're attracted to the German Shepherd?  Is there something in particular you're hoping for?|`|SnAsZapMaa	There are 3 levels of house training, and the breed has little to do with any of them.<br>  <br>  First level is training YOURSELF to notice the pup's "wanna-go-toilet" signals - with a 7-8 weeks old pup they are usually produced 1 minute after walking and 3 minutes after feeding. And you then get it to the designated  toilet area.<br>  <br>  Second level is training the pup as to where it is allowed vs not allowed, what it may carry & chew vs what it mustn't."Bring" is an important part of that.<br>  <br>  Third level is training the older pup to give a signal (ringing a bell or bringing its lead is less destructive than scratching the door) when it wants to go out.<br>  <br>  Training in all cases is based on :<br>  ? you being consistent & observant,<br>  ? you praising & rewarding the pup (always including the appropriate word that you will later use as a Command word for that activity) when  it's doing desirable things, so that it gradually associates that tone of voice + rhythm of syllables with the particular thing it is doing - note: "IS", not "WAS", because dogs live in the NOW, not in the past,<br>  ? you reprimanding it when the pup goes somewhere disallowed or does something undesirable.<br>  And when you have to reprimand a pup, that should be followed VERY quickly by commanding the pup to do something easy for it to obey ("Come on" or "Sit", for example) so that you can praise/reward it.<br>  <br>  I doubt there's room to answer all 3, so I will just briefly cover the first:<br>  ? As soon as you see its signal (commonly an anxious nose-down sniffing as it goes around in a  circle), pick the pup up, carry it to the designated toilet area, stay there silently until the pup obliges (that can sometimes take a l-o-n-g time!), then praise it (eg, "Good girl Darky, Toilet!"), give it a pat or rub its chest or ear bases, have a little game (eg, chase the ball or tug-o-war), then call it back inside - and praise it again when it arrives.<br>  ? If you are unobservant and the piddle happens before you pick the pup up, pick it up anyway and take it outside - the cleaning up can wait.<br>  ? Once the pup obviously knows the routine, if it then starts piddling inside you can startle it (either stamp the floor & yell " No!" or throw a rolled-up sock and yell "No" just as the sock hits it - socks don't hurt, and are easy to launder) just before you pick the pup up).<br>  <br>  This applies whether the toilet spot is outside or on newspaper .<br>  <br>  Now a caution:<br>  The description "an extremely active teenager" indicates a person who is unsuitable to have a puppy.<br>  The reasons are that teenagers are notorious for mood swings (but a trainer must have his/her moods fully under control), that teenagers tend to be preoccupied with themselves and their friends/enemies, teenagers tend to be away from home for long periods (which places the burden of toilet training or cleaning up messes onto the stay-at-home members of the household), and extremely active people tend to spend VERY long periods away BEING active or getting fit enough to be active.<br>  So look deeply at your current lifestyle/behaviour/daily-schedule. Also look ahead to whether you will soon be living away from home in order to gain a tertiary degree. A well-bred GSD is a commitment for the next 12-16 years.<br>  I require my puppy-buyers to be home 24/7 for at least the first week, preferably the first fortnight, so that they can convince the pup that they are the centre of everything nice in its universe, and can complete the level 2 of house training. The first level should happen the first day, but needs to be reinforced for several days before you can feel confident about it. And if you crate your pup instead of putting it in a roofed escape-proof run with a raised sleeping box whenever you can't supervise it (such as while you're asleep) you will find that the pup is forced to go toilet in its crate then lie in its own mess. Many crate users report that it took up to 8 months to toilet-train their pup. My last pup came inside 24/7 at 8-9 weeks old and had the run  of the house except that I shut 3 doors and taught her that dogs are NOT allowed in "Dad's kennel" even though the door is always open. I don't know how often she ignored that while I was asleep, but there were only about 5 mornings on which I had to look in the passage for my second sock.<br>  <br>  If you decide to go ahead, first join some of the 300+ YahooGroups dedicated to various aspects of living with GSDs, and ask your additional questions there. Each group's Home page tells you what they want to talk about, and how active they are. And last year's  newbies LOVE being able to answer questions asked by this year's newbies!<br>  Les P<br>  owner of GSD_Friendly:  <a href="http://pets.groups.yahoo.com/group/GSD_Friendly">http://pets.groups.yahoo.com/group/GSD_F...</a><br>  "In GSDs" as of 1967|`|7TKRtDanaa	house breaking takes time, consistancy and patience, Remember puppies are like babies, you cant potty train a baby right away. So the puppy is going to have accidents, but the first thing you want to do is praise and reward when they go potty outside and create a go word from the very first day so they relate the word to the function and the environment. You really have to act like  a big jack *** the first few time they go outside like its the best thing in the world. But when accidents do happen just clean it up, dont yellor rub their nose or anything like that, Good luck|`|emLxIJ0daa	im not so good on the house training, but german sheperd dogs are the best kind in the world! unfortunattly mine was hit and killed last night. : ( anyways get him/her. youll love it so much. they are the prettiest dogs in the world and they listen well, behave well, and are very,very active. you will love german shepherds...i promise

G3cLz9GXaa	A Basset hounds coat length can very from very short and smooth to very long haired.  I have 4 bassets, two have very short coats, one has a bit longer and one has hair that in the scruff area is an 1 1/2 inches long.  Tucker's hair waves at the scruff and base of the tail.  Since I don't show I am not sure if it is a fault.  Here is a  link a picture of long haired basset.  He is a purebred but carries the recessive long haired gene.    http://s210.photobucket.com/albums/bb25/...      If you are truly interested in showing, consider mentoring with someone that shows  bassets.  If you have a basset hound club close to you the members can be a wealth of information and knowledge on the breed standard.  They may be willing to assess your girl to see if she is would do well in the ring.  Also attend some breed shows so you can become familiar with what goes on.      Also keep in mind that the breed standards will probably be changing in the near future.  In the UKC the basset hound is really being targeted for change, with less wrinkles, shorter ears, longer legs, etc...all those qualities that have made bassets so adorable.  Very few dogs are born that are show quality even to championed sires and dams.    Belly rubs to your girl!  If that is her picture on your profile, she is a cutie.|`|P8Q39vA4aa	These are the only disqualifications in basset hounds    Disqualifications   Height of more than 15 inches at the highest point of the shoulder blade.  Knuckled over front legs.   Distinctly long coat.    It says nothing of a wavy patch.    Im not sure if its normal but i will star and maybe someone will know|`|vPde97E2aa	If you "know alot about Bassets",then you know what the breed standard says about coat,of course.  Any deviation from the standard is a fault. Perhaps you might benefit by re-reading  the part about "smooth" in the description of the correct coat.        rotflmao........the TD fairies can't READ or refuse to LEARN?? That would be hilarious if it wasn't such a sad example of jealous spiteful human behavior.|`|4aN8AwmRaa	Many Bassetts acquire a somewhat wavy coat especially between the shoulder and on the back it is normal.    There are a few factors that probably influence this. One is genetics. If the parents had more of a thick wavier coat then it is likely to develop with your pup. Second is also development in the adult coat which will be somewhat coarser and sometimes longer/wavier. Also the time of year can influence the thickness of a coat and whether or not your dog is outside or inside alot.
AQsiugSpaa	Hi Pamela,    Since your male cat is a novice at breeding, he will need a little time to "figure it out." I suspect that both of your cats are young so neither of them have any experience breeding. Instincts will prevail and he will ultimately know what to do. His behavior is totally normal.    Additionally, your female may not be at the peak of her estrus, which may be part of the reason that he walks away like he is not interested, fully. But I do suspect this is due to their young age.    If I were you, if your cats are under a year old, to wait till at least they are both over a year old. You want your female to be able to produce healthy kittens, and if she is too young, this will be a huge strain on her system.    Pyometria is generally a disease in middle aged females which have not been spayed, and are allowed to go into heat, repeatedly. So at a little over a year, this should not be a problem. You might want to talk to your vet about your breeding plans, as well.  http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?...      Having bred registered purebred cats for years, and having males who were inexperienced, this is par for the course.  Just be patient.    Hope this helps,    Troublesniffer  Owned by cats for over 40 years  Former CFA registered breeder of Siamese, Oriental Shorthairs, Russian Blues and Burmese|`|gM7VuCM4aa	If there are no physical reason preventing him from mating, he will definitely figure it out.

Good luck and have fun with your babies in a couple months!|`|RN1wGlWWaa	How old are they?  If he doesn't breed her within this month, I really would forget it and spay/neuter them.  You cannot allow her to keep going in and out of heat because she is at risk for developing pyrometria and Siamese once they are in heat, will keep cycling a lot.|`|X40Ww89qaa	no, her tail is always in the way|`|tDZMJue9aa	he will he is biting her neck that is a sign that they are  mating in the cat world have you never seen cats outside getting it on, she is obviously scaring him whenever he is having to move her tail out of the way, give it some time and he will figure it out, do not try to help them out|`|K0uTjeWiaa	Sorry. You do not get to dictate the answers. Maybe your male cat realizes that 8 million cats a year are killed just for being born and that even kittens are being killed because of lack of room in shelters. Even siamese cats are being killed. Maybe he also realizes how irresponsible people that just don't care are the cause of this|`|LCHnUuS6aa	Maybe he is gay.|`|45b08ca1dc880690ca7764657e05b376aa	You don't say what his age is. Could it be that he is just a little bit to young just yet?|`|V8rV38yfaa	Maybe its shy because you are there.|`|n7bok7NRaa	It sounds like he's exhibiting the right behavior, which means you might want to give him a little more time.    There's nothing you can do to help, other than let them be alone.    If you want to make sure you know they've done the deed (but can't be in the same room), if you hear the female give a sharp screaming howl, he's done it.|`|9dlRcS7caa	Cat's sexual maturity differs from one another, female tends to go in heat at a young age, male can also start early but some can be a late bloomer when it comes to mating. Maybe your tomcat is not yet interested in mating. You should give them more time and patience..

gM7VuCM4aa	On average the feline gestation period is 63 days.|`|ISjFdI1taa	About 63 days on average from conception.  So if she's heavily pregnant, she might only have a few weeks to go.  If the vet didn't notice she was pregnant, then she's probably not right at the end.  If I were you I'd get her examined again to make sure and your vet can give you a print out/leaflet to explain what you need to do to prepare for the birth if she is pregnant.|`|OiPLiQppaa	about 6-8 weeks but who's regular|`|Cvlf7arlaa	put her on a diet.|`|Gwxuc8mIaa	It takes around almost exactly 63 days.

Be sure to feed her kitten food during, and after the pregnancy!! Good luck with the little ones!..Don't let her out after the kittens are born and watch for neglect from mother cat. If she goes out again, or is around a male she may get pregnant nearly right after her litter is born.

T2rU15Nsaa	First, stop applying baby lotion. It contains alchohol and fragrance, which will dry out the skin and make it much more itchy. Certain parrots are prone to plucking for different reasons, mostly it is emotional, they are telling you they are unhappy for some reason. Either they do not get enough attention, or something has frightened them (new toy, large painting, new pet dog, etc..) you will have to frigure out what it is. In other cases it is physical, and you will need to see an avian vet to figure it out. If it is only dry skin making him/her itchy, there are balms available at bird specialty stores. My cockatoo was plucking, and after running some tests it was revealed that he had an ecoli problem. He went on proper antibiotics and has stopped plucking. Best route to take is go see a vet. It may be expensive, but if you think about the lifespan of parrots, and the quality of life he/she will lead if the plucking continues it will all even out. Remember that you are the only person that can help your pet parrot, they can't help themselves.  Best wishes!!!|`|qeOlkRM0aa	Parrots can pluck for many reasons. Dry air from heating in the winter, stress or nervousness, depression, and yes, irritation from a bad clipping.  The problem is, that once a bird starts this, its a very difficult habit to break.  You don't say what kind of parrot it is-some birds are more prone to plucking. I'm not sure baby lotion is a good idea-he may end up ingesting some of it. See if you can increase the humidity, if your heat has been on, and give him some love. :-)  Keep an eye on him though.|`|A1iDPPOeaa	A parrot plucking feathers indicates a serious problem and is a "nervous" condition.  The bird is upset and unhappy.  Maybe because of the cages location, not enough attention, boredom or something else going on there.  Be sure to try to determine what's upsetting your bird.|`|JBPsePnwaa	You need to get him to an avian vet  as soon as possible and have him tested for physical problems.  If no physical problem is found, then most likely it is a psychological and you need to figure out what is depressing him.  Also check with the vet about his diet, sometimes it can be  nutritional problems. Also, I would stop the lotion and ask the vet what to apply.
86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	Chicken is better as a treat than a staple. Oscars are primarily insectivores, so base their diet around that, while they're small, small earthworms, small crickets, shrimp that kind of thing. As they get larger, larger earthworms, occasional mealworms (treat only), crickets, fruit flies make up a good diet, combined with a high quality cichlid pellet. They do benefit from blanched vegetable matter also in their diet.    I don't recommend feeder fish - store bought can carry bacteria and parasites and make your fish sick. They are not that nutritious either. Feeding of some types of fish including Goldfish can also result in a vitamin B1 deficiency.    How many Oscars do you have?

In Additional to what you have provided to them, their diet includes cichlid sticks, earthworms, small fish, pieces of mussel, pieces of beef heart, insects and sometime chopped vegetables and even fruits. But I personally don't recommend fruits as it may pollute your tank water.|`|m0e3a3gWaa	Despite their normal and voracious appetite, Oscars are prone to a variety of problems connected with diet, usually resulting from an uninformed owner.  The first is their fussiness: refusal to eat only foods which they have become accustomed. This is easily cured as long as the owner is more resolute then the fish.  If the food is ignored then it is removed and the fish is left hungary until the next day. This process of attrition may have to continue for weeks, but invaribly suceeds as long as the owner is steadfast.  Far more serious are the results of feeding long term on unsuitable foods,usuallyy pellets. This can result in intestinall disorders, with the fish resting on the bottom sometimes with, but usually without abdominall swelling and refusing to feed.  A further problem is these fish are extremelyy messy feeders which waste cloud of particlel via the gills.  This can be obviatedd by feeding them their natural food sources, raw fish, crustaceans, insects and the occasional green stuff.
vvJBtxXHaa	the shrimp live ~2 years and grow up to 1 1/2" to 2", in an adequate sized tank    it is possible the shrimp reached maximum life....however, possibly the plants absorb enough O2 during day and expressCO2 that the availabe O2 is drastic in a 5 gal tank...you do show you keep a bubble stone too  ....soooo it seem sthat any recent changes have upset the chem's of the water....or somehow a copper substance was introduced?  ...exoskel's are real sensitive to metals and mineralization in water  ....but unless you have some way to test exact parameters, the cheapest method is using additional ghost shrimp...one at a time for 48 hours each  I have learned that in small tanks such as 2.5 or 5.0 gals, even adding a plant is traumatic to the water cycle  After a few days and a couple fo 15% water changes ,try another ghost shrimp and perhaps it will fair better than it's elder cousins that were lost recently  ...honestly, if they all died in some "sequential manner" just after you added the plants, then it seems clear that the plants prob'bly had some copper med's on them from the store tank water  ...cross contaminating your water  ....were the plants the ONLY new thing added, or changed? before the shrimp died?|`|ZJsjD4JHaa	sorry to tell you but there not really meant to be pets unless you wanted to keep them for some short period of time  just to watch from time to time but there bait you use them to feed to other underwater creatures like frogs and bigger fish etc...|`|jSMiLEDJaa	I don't really know the answer to why your shrimp are dying but I want to correct some misinformation.

Additionally, no matter what the law says, how do you test for that?  The wolf and dog genome are too closely related for any DNA test to be able to differentiate, let alone provide percentages.

In the US different states have different laws, in some, all wolf-hybrids are illegal, and in others there is no regulation at all.

I have a grandson and my dog is always at his side protecting him from anything, and he has helped raise a litter of orphaned kittens by cleaning them when they needed it and sleeping with them when they were cold.

CW94ortQaa	if you are a cat owner you know you don;t own a cat. The cat has a servant. They are known to prowl around for about 4 to 5 days. Make sure he is not stuck some where though. I had a cat stuck under the house. When we were joking around going here kitty kitty it called back to us. So try calling for him in the house and garage area to ensure he is not in there and I would give it a few more days. Put some food out for him too. Granted you will most likely feed every stray in your area but if he is in heat and you attract another female there that is in heat you might get lucky.

If she is otherwise healthy, there is absolutely no reason to put her down.|`|tMawuuUXaa	I think you should get her looked at.

Hope he finds relief.|`|MqYfsYd0aa	this would be an issue best discussed with your cat's vet.  they would be able to give you better advice considering your cats condition.|`|pDv13gJwaa	feed it better quality food may be a start
SZzASlujaa	Trust me on this one, you're right. After one dog is submissive the battle is over. I wouldn't allow them around each other. I would also give that owner a piece of my mind. Unless he wants me to start feeding tainted Scooby Snacks to his beloved German Shepard he better get his dog together.|`|UC9Wjjscaa	It is normal for dogs to challenge each other for dominance.  However a competent owner will control his dog and not allow that to that degree in dog park.  His dog should definitely back off when your dog shows submission.  He has a very powerful breed and needs to have it under control where it will get off on his command.  GSD are naturally dominant dogs and want to be in charge.  They have to have a strong pack leader.  That guy is gonna end up with a lawsuit because his dog is going to seriously hurt someone or another animal.  I would avoid him at all costs. Danger Danger Danger.|`|AA11992723	You need to explain what "attacking" is going on. There is attacking with bites, and what people refer to as attacking, but where BITE INHIBITION is happening.<br>  <br>  I'm not saying the GSD's owner is right. But I think clearly there is an error of interpretation on someone's part -either you or the GSD owner- about what is really going on between these 2 dogs.<br>  <br>  I am assuming there is no skin being broken or you wouldn't wait at all to break it up.<br>  <br>  This GSD unfortunately because the owner allowed it, is going to keep doing this to your dog out of no reason but HABIT now.<br>  <br>  You have to prevent the GSD from going that far with your dog. Block him with your body before your dog is taken to the ground. And ask the GSD to help you keep him away from your dog.<br>  <br>  If the owner is NOT compliant, then you have some other options. <br>  1. Get a citronella spray dog deterrent. But use it very carefully. the smell is painful to a dog and should not be misused. Spray it only at the GSD's nose, not his eyes, only at the moment the GSD goes to lunge at your dog. Be warned, the GSD owner will be pissed I'm sure.<br>  2. Only go to this dog park when the GSD owner is not there.<br>  3. ask someone in the dog parl to help you explain to this owner to not allow the behavior to continue, because it's having a negative effect on your and your dog, and you dont want your dog to become fear aggressive.|`|gwUMipsUaa	You are right.  Dog parks have rules against dogs fighting.  The owner of the provoking dog is to leave with the dog once the fight is broken up.<br>  <br>  Report this guy to your local parks dept, city, or whoever is in charge so they can banish him from the local dog parks.|`|9ea79964f4ddad1359a8089c6729bb4caa	You are right, It's normal for dogs to get into little scuffles, but once one submits, the other dog should quit attacking.|`|AA10283080	The shepherd owner is wrong.<br>  <br>  My advice would be to keep your dog away from that dog and it's owner since the owner obviously doesn't care what happens to your dog.|`|d76b933acafc2fee8fc3c072d2e15141aa	dog is aggressive and shouldnt be a the dog park or it should have a muzzle|`|0hTvKlD5aa	It's a little heavy handed, but it's kind of typical 'adolscent' dominant behavior.  My dalmatian pup would play that way with other dogs sometimes, but I ALWAYS pulled her off. For that guy to just sit there and watch is reprehensible. Especially if you've expressed concern.<br>     I would just walk my dog, or arrange play dates with one or two other dogs that your dog knows well, and keep away from the dog park. A couple of dogs that live in my complex were seriously injured at a dog park by a German Shephard, (I love GSDs, but this moron has no clue to how control his,) and there have been other disasters. I keep away from them, most of the other dogs there are completely out of control.|`|C1eHfhrHaa	You are right and you need to tell the owner to keep his dog away, otherwise your dog could become aggressive from fear.  Be very firm with the owner that he needs to keep his dog under control.  I know most of the dog parks where I am are self-policed in that there isn't really anyone to report behavior issues to.  It's a shame to not be able to take your dog there because of one person.|`|0nIwKd5Uaa	I think you are right, and i would be looking for a new place to take your dog to play or not go if the Shepherd is there. You don't want it to get worse. You breaking up the fight could cause you to get bitten and that wouldn't be good.<br>  <br>  for the person who said it. You cannot put another persons dog in a muzzle, and i don't think her Samoyed should be in a muzzle of the two dogs hers needs to be able to protect himself.|`|82cb8f9319b4af25b84a0e62e4814ffbaa	Sorry but I can't believe that you keep going back to that park OR let the attack go on as long as you do. The first time a dog attacked my Sheltie I would be on that dog like white on rice, the owner would get a piece of my mind for NOT controlling his dog better and then I would be out of there.|`|3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	It *sounds* as though you are correct.  Harder to say without seeing...as when my two play, the one pictured likes to roll around on his back and make squealing noises.  To a stranger, this probably looks pretty scary...I, however, know it is normal play.<br>  <br>  This is just one more reason I do not step foot near dog parks.  Either find a new one, stay far away from that man and his dog, or mention something to the managers of the park.|`|AA10526402	I agree with you - if your dog is being submissive, the GSD shouldn't keep attacking.  Next time you run into them, I would hold your dog on the leash away from the GSD and just tell the neighbor that you are in a hurry so your dogs can't play right now.  Then I would just continue walking.  Good luck!|`|UuYVehSsaa	Definatley aggressive.|`|AJxl0IvHaa	you are right!<br>  But just be careful breaking it up!!|`|Tkr8F0bQaa	the shepherd is agressive and out of control.animal behaviourists say that once the submissive dog displays all the signs of submission,as urs does,a normal dominant dog will stop.an abnormally agressive animal will keep attacking.ur dog-and u-can be seriously injured-bitten,even killed.stay clear of this lunatic and his dog.his dog is not dominant,a trait which includes forbearance and tolerance for submissive animals.his dog is agressive,a trait which takes no consideration of the fact that submissive animals have already conceded,so there is no need to fight.someday this man and his dog will be in serious trouble,when the dog bites an adult or a child.it seems this man takes a weird delight in seeing his dog bully urs.hes dangerous,stay away.and dont try to break up a dogfight-avoidance is ur best policy.a friend who tried to break up a dogfight was wounded,i never saw anything so awful.his dalmation was fighting a chow,he tiried to stop them,the chow devestated his arm,blood was everywhere.he had to go to the emergency room,and the chow was taken away by the aspca,and they said it was viscious and would not return it to my friend(he owned both dogs.)it was put down!|`|oHKpy4IRaa	The man who owns the shepherd probably bought his dog when he was younger the 8 weeks old because 8 weeks is the youngest age you could get a puppy. He probably got him too young. You need to get a puppy at 8 weeks or older because the puppy needs to spend time with the other puppies in the litter. By doing this they will learn that when they play to aggressive the puppy will cry or make a high pitch screeching sound and the other dog knows that he is hurting the dog so he knows to not play so rough. He obviously got his shepherd at an age that was too young and does not know how to play with other dogs.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!|`|028xaZCeaa	it is normal for dogs to be agressive like that, its natural i think but that DOESNT make it ok. and what will the guy say when the dog keeps on until he kills your dog i would tell him to go to hell and report him to authority that is the most ridiculous thing i have ever heard... it isnt the dogs faulth that he is misbehaving so it is the owner for letting him!|`|BWZ6pBoHaa	Why would you continue to go to this dog park if your dog is being beat up by a SHEPHERD?  Why wouldn't you find some where else to go?<br>  <br>  I would NEVER take my dogs to a dog park, they are breeding grounds for disease, and fights, as you've found out.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  GET SOME PEPPER SPRAY.

Perhaps if you look at the dog's pedigree, you might be able to come up with a combination of the animals' relatives names. Check the sire, dam, grandparents and great grandparents' names on both sides.  If he comes from a particular breeder who has a name for their kennel, you may be able to utilize their kennel name as part of his name.  For example is he comes from Vineyard Cliffs Kennel (totally made up), you may be able to list his name as Axel Blue (utilize his sire's name somehow here) ______ of Vineyard Cliffs.  Just a thought.   I assuming you probably have so many characters that you can name an animal.  Some allow you only 30 characters to use to register a dog.

If his doesn't go back to his normal behavior within an hour or two, get him in to a Vet.  If he appears to be getting worse, take him to a Vet immediately!!!|`|h6t4aRUOaa	Dogs will lick their paws when they have an allergic reaction. Did you walk him where maybe the used lawn fertilizer or weed killer? For some reason Staffies seem prone to this specific allergy. I run a breed rescue and after having most of these guys checked for mange found out they where having a reaction to the plant food I use for my roses.
hC4Z8HIbaa	The diahreah can be from any number of things. It could be that the rat is now too hydrated and the gut can't absorb all the water that is being taken in, or it could be from the medicine. I would take a shot as to say the medicine is either Doxycycline or Baytril? These are the most common types of meds for rats. They are both antibiotics, which can sometimes create a looser stool. As for the hammock, it could be that she's just playing. I highly doubt she is trying to kill herself. If I were you, I would give the vet a call and ask her what you should do. It may not even require a visit to the vet. <br>  <br>  Also, does your little lady have a friend? You may or may not know that rats are best kept in pairs, as they are very social. Think about yourself, would you want to be kept in a place with no other people like you? See if you can talk your parents into allowing you to adopt a rat from a local rescue or SPCA.<br>  <br>  One last thing. I like to tell people about the website I have listed below.

be58a957ec05b08ab61416f8ea457867aa	Almost any of the toy breeds would be fine. I might lean a bit more toward a Shih tzu, Maltese, Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, Toy Poodle, or Havanese just because - in general - they are a bit more calm than some other toys.     The age of the dog is really a bigger factor, especially if Grandma is physically frail. Puppies bite and seniors tend to have thinner skin that is more easily torn and bruised by puppy teeth.

There are puppies of every personality in every breed, so if you get one that is a little older, you will already have a pretty good idea about the dog's behavior.  Go to www.petfinder.com.

Many of the toy breeds and smaller medium breeds would be a good choice.  I would however, consider an older dog that already knows how to keep out from under your feet.

vS1Z0inOaa	What most likely happened is the sick one died and then the healthy one acted on his predatory instincts and ate him. Turtles do eat carrion... I have seen this happen a few times... Rather heart-breaking.     You certainly can get another yellow-bellied slider. However, you need to be sure that the new turtle is relatively the same size as this one. Also, please realize that there are individuals and some individual turtles simply will NOT get along and you may end up having to keep them in separate tanks. This is especially true if your two turn out to be males--they will get territorial. Sometimes you can keep two territorial turtles together by providing two basking areas (sometimes what I do is make a sort of fake wall in the middle of the basking area so the two turtles can be on it at the same time without seeing each other). But sometimes they just won't live together, period. So you'll need to be prepared for that.     I'm also betting that you were feeding them both at the same time in their tank. That would be your biggest mistake ever in keeping turtles... When you do that, one turtle will pig up all the best food and continue to grow bigger and stronger quickly while the other one can't get as much and continues to grow slower and weaker and may eventually give up trying to eat at all. Also any leftover food will dissolve and dirty up their water... If you keep two or more turtles together in the same tank, they should always be fed separately in a separate bowl. This greatly reduces aggression because turtles mostly use feeding time to display their dominance and because both turtles will grow big and strong and will be able to fend for himself if the other one gets cranky. You can keep greens and feeder minnows in the tank at all times--they don't seem to fight over those since they're always available. But pellet food and occasional treats like worms and crickets should always, without exception, be fed in a separate bowl of water.     I personally prefer to keep my turtles in groups. They are social in a sense... But now you know the one you still have is a dominant turtle, so take care to match him to another of about the same size and make sure it gets enough to eat.     Would you consider adopting a RES rather than buying a yellow-bellied slider? They go well together and RES are so plentiful there are too many older ones in rescues. Just a thought...|`|CdRlOsnyaa	it is possible the other turtle ate the other turtle when it was dead , if you get another yelow belly slider put it in the tank and see how the other two act around it, as i upgraded my tank i kept all my old stuff so i hae a 10 gallong tank with everything a turtle needs if you have something like that let it grow up a little by itself
LAXxaxAZaa	Yes, you will need two different numbers. Most of the time they will let you put a hold before your second class. That'll give you time to switch your number and get ready.|`|YdJgrgvdaa	i'm not sure i think you do need different numbers, you do for showjumping, check the showing website|`|MUfMJYHGaa	The numbers are usually assigned to the rider at every show, but some shows assign by rider/horse combination if you are showing more than one horse per class. Get BIG safety pins  (like diaper pins)and put all the numbers you need in the order you need them on your jacket so it's easy for your crew to unpin and remove or add each number as needed. It will take about 10 seconds if they don't drop them|`|sKZbK6Y5aa	. you will have to tell the steward you need time for a number or tack change.  you had better get yourself some help. my husband and i showed 3 horses and it was insane...back to back classes.|`|KeQOHakpaa	you will need different numbers, each horse will require it's own number. so this way points (or w/e) won't get mixed up among the horses, even though you are the same handler/rider. also for quick number changes, the best thing to do is to have an extra set of hands at the gate when you come out of the arena. take you're jacket off right as you exit the arena/are getting off your horse. then have the extra person take the numbers and switch them as you are on your way to getting on the next horse. once you are on the horse, pull your jacket on and you'll get set. it will also help a great deal if you get some number holders like these:  <a href="http://www.sstack.com/shopping/product/detailmain.jsp?itemID=10085&itemType=PRODUCT&RS=1&keyword=number+pins" rel="nofollow">http://www.sstack.com/shopping/product/d...</a> - they're magnetic and you'll be able to get the numbers on and off quicker than if you have regular safety pins. (i'm sure you could also do this yourself w/out an extra set of hands, but another person would just make it that much easier)<br>  <br>  you can also call for a tack change between classes if need be, just make your way (or have someone do it for you while you're riding) to the announcer both and ask for a tack change. <br>  <br>  hope i helped!|`|MtmpOqZ7aa	Well, get ready to do A LOT of running! =) I showed two horses this past season, and my classes ended up being back to back.  I did have someone waiting at the exit gate to collect horse number one, while I ran to the enter gate for horse number two. It was pretty stressful, but depending on what classes you are planning on showing in maybe they wont fall back to back like mine did.<br>  <br>  I had assumed that I would have one number because I was only one rider...but I was wrong.  I had a different number for each horse so that was fun trying to remember what my number was. =) For changing the number quickly, what I did was instead of pinning my number on, I laced a thin black string through the number and tied it to me.  That way when I was walking one horse out of the gate I was already untying my number and the person who was holding the next horse had my other number set for me to tie on.|`|jV7SmnaTaa	Yes you will need different numbers. How to change them quickly depends on your event.<br>  <br>  In the in hand classes - many people have gone to magnets instead of pins. They sell the number magnets on ebay and many tack stores of them. They are amazingly strong and your number will not fall off!<br>  <br>  In western and hunter under saddle you would use a toklat number pad. These are hooked into your western saddles and you buy a toklat pad for english (it comes with a nice see through envelope). The number pads have 4 digits and flip to all of the different numbers (0167, 9999, 7146). They're pretty cool.<br>  <br>  In the hunter jumper classes it really isn't appropriate to have your number on the pad - so in this case you're going to end up using pins or you can invest in some of the plain looking magnets.<br>  <br>  Best wishes...<br>  <br>  Here's an example of the Toklat Number Pad for Hunter Under saddle events:  <a href="http://www.legacytack.com/p/10587/Toklat%20Medallion%20Competition%20Pad.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.legacytack.com/p/10587/Toklat...</a><br>  <br>  For western events this is what we normally use: <a href="http://www.rods.com/product.aspx?display_id=764" rel="nofollow">http://www.rods.com/product.aspx?display...</a><br>  <br>  And then these are some of the magnets used to hold numbers on your back: <a href="http://www.rods.com/product.aspx?display_id=9831" rel="nofollow">http://www.rods.com/product.aspx?display...</a>|`|AnX8QHgHaa	Each horse will be a separate entry and have their own number.  As long as you have each horses number in your grooming box, it's not hard to change them quickly.

I'm not sure if the corn snake will attack the cat, but you can probably bet on the cat trying to play with the corn snake. Is the cat declawed? If so, then with careful supervision (so the cat doesn't bite) it could work. But if your cat has claws then you should probably consider locking your cat out of the room when your snake is out & about.<br>  <br>  Also, maybe put the aquarium in a place up high where the cat can't sit and fixate on the snake.<br>  <br>  It could work but only if you keep both of your pets best interests in mind.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|WSIZKAQcaa	you're asking for trouble if you get a snake|`|jyGTlpzTaa	Either keep the snake in a room that the cat cant get into, or abandon the idea.

And if you do try a rescue in your area if you have or try the shelter. If you can't find one then get one from a very responsible breeder.

This is misleading because it is not an actual breed. This type of dog is actually a mixed breed raised specifically for sledding.<br>  <br>  As far as loyalty goes, most dogs will show loyaly to their owners.  Certain breeds are said to show more loyalty then others in which case you shouldnt worry because malamutes are typically characterised by being very loyal.|`|AA10229248	Malamutes are sledge dogs - they were bred to haul heavy loads over short distances. Huskies are sled dogs - bred to travel with moderate loads over long distances. Think of it as the difference between a clydsedale horse (the malamute) and a thoroughbred horse (the husky).<br>  <br>  All northern breeds, such as malamutes, are loyal - to a point. They are overall friendly dogs that like everyone (except cats and other small animals).

Many times a mother cats will lick her kittens down there ti stimulate them to go, so this should trigger that action.<br>  <br>  Take the little guy to the vet as well.

Kittens should be allowed to stay with mom till at least 10 weeks old so she has time to teach it "cat things" it will need it's whole life.  <br>  <br>  If you have a stray, you need to fix up a nursery for it to stay in for a few days.  Big, new places can be overwhelming for young kittens and a smaller environment will be less threatening.  Use clay non-clumping litter since he's so young.  Kittens are very curious and sometimes eat litter.  Clumping litter can cause intestinal blockages.<br>  <br>  Your kitten needs to see a vet ASAP.  Young kittens are prone to health issues and your little guy could have something going on.  I'd bring him in today.  Don't make an appointment, just go.  Vets will work in where they see a potential problem with a very young animal.
AA10229248	Usually two syllables so you can vary the tone between syllables. Also better to end on a long vowel sound rather than something short and flat. For example: Fluffy rather than Spot. You can drag out the e-sound in Fluffy: "Fluff-eeeeee" whereas Spot is too short and hard: "SpoT"<br>  <br>  Edit: If you want to use a name that ends in "o" then you just pick another sound for correction.

AA12128656	you need to make it unpleasant for the dog.  the dog has not been trained that it's not ok to bite. this should have been trained when the dog was a little pup.    when the dog bites (i'm assuming this is play biting) give the jowl or lip a good pinch. EVERY TIME.    the dog will learn that biting you is painful.  encourage the dog to bite toys.|`|be58a957ec05b08ab61416f8ea457867aa	If she is play biting, you need to teach her that biting ends her fun. When she bites, give a firm verbal correction (I like to say "ack!" because it is a sharp and novel sound that usually interrupts the behavior). If she stops then lightly praise her and go back to playing. If she doesn't stop or if she bites again soon after then play should end for several minutes. Just immediately stop interacting with her and walk away or do something else. If she keeps biting though you are ignoring her then put her in another room for a minute or two.    Do NOT hit her, pinch her, scream at her, or hold her mouth closed. In my experience this only makes the behavior worse 9 out of 10 times.    If she is biting aggressively (when you try to move her, when you touch her in certain places, if you try to take something away from her, etc.) then you need to consult with a behaviorist or private trainer right away. You can get a referral from your vet or go to www.apdt.com.|`|rDLTnjRyaa	There are different reasons for a dog to bite. I would suggest that you take her to a professional.

The pack leader would not allow another wolf to bite at him; he would take that other wolf & put it down so that it understood in no uncertain terms what is expected.      You need to be the pack leader & be assertive enough to make your dog understand that it has boundaries & limitations where you are concerned.  You can do this with your body language - stand up straight & tall and use a calm assertive voice.  Always follow through the same way so that your dog always knows what to expect.|`|74887b1a75edcde7cf7361c41613e27daa	You have to show the dog that you are the boss.

My black lab mix is 10.5 months old and can still be pretty mouthy sometimes, especially when he's playing with my boyfriend. I always grab his snout and say "No bite!" sternly. He doesn't always listen right away, but he's getting a lot better. If you remain patient and consistent, I'm sure she'll grow out of it.    Edit: DeeDawg, I have a black lab mix.

o93EwErKaa	Well I do think it will greatly improve the rating of a 3 star food to at least a 4 or 5, but not a 6.  I don't think it would help with a 1 or 2 star food because they are lacking in more than meat content by adding cheap fillers and unnecessary ingredients like salt and sugar.  The foods rated 6 stars are completely grainless and also have added live bacteria cultures, antioxidants, glucosamine, Omega fatty acid, etc.  <br>  <br>  Dog foods have come a long way over the years.  I am old enough to remember when Eukanuba came out and everyone thought it was so great (and it probably was at the time considering what was available).  It is really sad that people pay that much for such a low quality food.  Royal Canin is another one that is expensive, but poor quality.  I feed Taste of the Wild (TOTW on dogfoodanalysis) Canine Wetlands formula and I have seen an improvement in their coats (length and shine - Yorkies) over the 5 star Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul I was feeding before.|`|AA10229248	I feed Eagle Pack and supplement it with raw. My dogs are doing great with that combination. And it saves me a little money. The dog food lasts longer and with a little shopping I can get raw food at pretty decent prices.|`|d2191893763b20a6b077367a131978aaaa	IMHO a quality food is determined as much by what is NOT in it, as what IS in it.<br>  <br>  There are some ingredients in commercial foof that I refuse to feed my dog, no matter what supplements I add.|`|FdcWPp48aa	I feed Innova EVO and have to travel into the big city (3 hours each way) to get it.  It's worth it to me.|`|179d89749bec4d1cc3b5752c11fd0745aa	I, too, live in an area where I would have to pay astronomical amounts to have dog food shipped to me, as the 6 stars, and most of the 5 star aren't available in my area.  (And driving to a place is impossible as I live on an island)<br>  <br>  I feed Natural Balance, if I remember right, is a 3 star, and I feel comfortable feeding them that as a sole diet.  But, I do also feed them a part time raw diet, and I am also uncomfortable going 100% raw, especially because that would be expensive to feed 3 large dogs said diet, and I don't think I can get it balanced well enough.  My dogs coats look great, they're shiny (I also add raw eggs to their food occasionally and canned salmon), and they never suffer any ailments.  (I also put Bragg's Apple Cider Vinegar in their food)...<br>  <br>  I would suspect your dogs are doing fine, even on the 3 star, and adding the meat is just an added bonus that can't possibly hurt them.  You can make things work... there are lots of healthy items to add to your dogs food to make them the healthiest they can be.|`|AoSeHXeQaa	Yeah - I looked at the site and was surprised by Eukanuba, too.<br>  <br>  I feed Flint River Ranch, which I order online, and UPS delivers it.<br>  Only my 14 yr old dog gets Innova, because their senior dog food is meat based, and Flint Rivers is not.  I have to drive to the next town to buy it. <br>  <br>  All my other dogs get Flint River regular, except for a chihuahua I am fostering who has skin issues - she is getting Flint River lamb and millet, plus fish oil.  I have had her for two weeks, and her skin is almost clear, now.<br>  <br>  I can see the difference in the food in the dogs.  My dogs are gorgeous - trim, shiny and energetic.  I bring foster dogs in on a regular basis and start them on my dog food, and it usually only takes a week or two to see a big improvement in their coats and condition.<br>  <br>  I havent had a sick dog in years, and I think the food makes a difference in that, too.<br>  <br>  IMO, the added cost for good food is definitely worth it.
Mcf33eLbaa	For folks that have little or no experience training their dogs I would suggest you open up either the phone book or look on line for a decent school.<br>  Books are ok but and video`s are ok but for the novice I would say take a class.<br>  Video`s and books just don`t answer all the questions you may have. <br>  But even just finding a school in the phone book or on line is not the easy part as their are so many dog obedience instructors out there. Who to chose?<br>  A good obedience school will not just take your money and enroll you.<br>  They will ask if you wish to come in and observe a class before making your decision. Take them up on it as you want results not just an instructor that just demonstrates exercises using their own dog.<br>  As well try to find a school or class that the instructor is not overwhelmed by the size of the class.<br>  In other words find a class where the instructor takes the time to be sure everyone understands what was taught that class.<br>  I liken this to "hands on instructors", ones that can see that your having difficulty and take the time to show you the proper way of doing an exercise.<br>  And one more important thing is hand out`s of exercise`s for you to work on till the next class. A great review tool which you need to use everyday till the next class.<br>  Your instructor can only show you how to train your dog, it`s up to you to follow through daily.<br>  I hope this helps you out and steers you in the right direction.<br>  Oh and by the way, yelling will not work.  Always remain calm and keep your voice at the same level. In many situations your dog will only think that your joining in the party it is having.<br>  It`s like yelling at your dog for barking, in most situations your dog will only tink that you have joined in and are barking as well, only making matters worse.<br>  As for calling your dog to you, remember this, that most important thing about any successful recall is to be more interesting to your dog then anything else out there.<br>  I have always found when teaching a dog recall that first it is looking at you and that you use backwards movement still facing the dog. And remember that until your dog really knows it always on leash while teaching it.<br>  Good Luck and God Bless|`|SjYvZsrOaa	Unfortunately, because your dog is older now, it is going to be more of a challenge to train him.

Great that you've admitted you've created a problem and are prepared to work hard to solve it.  <br>  <br>  I'll leave others to suggest videos/books, but had you thought of an obedience class rather than hiring an individual trainer?<br>  <br>  Sometimes there are not-for-profit clubs (depends what country you're in I guess) that don't charge a lot.  Not always as good as a professional, but probably better than doing it alone.<br>  <br>  Oh and one last thought for you.  Your dog is at a bad age for rebellious behaviour.  Dogs are like teenagers at that age, trying to establish themselves in the hierarchy.  So, you may be seeing the worst he has to offer and you may not be doing as badly as you thought :-)<br>  <br>  Good luck with him.|`|mfXDUkRYaa	How about a book on clicker training?<br>  <br>  Once you put the effort in, you will really see a difference.|`|OxFsslN8aa	You can do basic training right at home for nothing.  Use treats or whatever motivates your dog and teach sit, stay, come, down.  Obedience school is great for you, as the owner, as well as the dog and a 9 week class usually won't run too much money.  <br>  <br>  Most important is how the dog sees you; it should be as the pack leader.  You should walk him first thing in the morning; feed him his first meal after you eat yours, go in the house & out of the house before him; make him sit calmly before he gets anything.  A large breed dog should get about 2 hours of walking/running per day and not in a yard.  A yard is just a large crate & dogs don't release energy the same way in a yard as they do out on the open road/trail.  You will see a marked improvement if you exercise your dog everyday outside with you while you are in control (heeling while walking/running).  Good luck.|`|mhvb9eFkaa	We have owned, bred and trained over 100 golden retrievers and the best training we ever found that worked was the Koehler method.<br>  Here is a link with lots of info on the method:<br>  <a href="http://www.koehlerdogtraining.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.koehlerdogtraining.com/</a><br>  <br>  It is amazing!

EP3N26mIaa	To find the answer you need to search the population of dogs and cats now opposed to 10 years ago. <br>  <br>  This article might help: <a href="http://www.indystar.com/article/20090221/LOCAL18/902210466" rel="nofollow">http://www.indystar.com/article/20090221...</a><br>  <br>  Basically you could use this article as an argument saying that because the economy is so bad people are giving their animals to shelters more than ever before adding to the already over crowded shelters, so if people spayed or neutered their pets now, it would help decrease the already crowded population to make more room for the pets being given to them.
DVDYDaVSaa	If your dog had the complete set of puppy vaccines (including three for Parvo at 3-4 week intervals) it's unlikely your dog has Parvo.  The only way to know for sure is with a quick test that can be done at your vet's office.  Diarrhea can be caused by any number of things, including eating different food or something odd (trash, dead animals, etc), viral or bacterial infections, parasites, etc.   A fecal test for parasites and a Parvo test would give you a better idea.<br>  <br>  added:  Just to correct an answer above, dogs with Parvo are not necessarily fine one day and "deathly ill" the next.  We see them in all stages of sickness from just being lethargic to having nonstop vomiting and diarrhea.|`|ba86e3c1dafe29cda3bf9356d0bbeec1aa	Did your dog have a series of puppy shots or just one?  <br>  <br>  Usually your dog should have several shots over about a 4-5 month time frame.  The first usually at around 5-6 weeks, a second at 12 and a third at 16 ... followed by adult boosters yearly.<br>  <br>  There is what's known as the "window of susceptibility".  This is the period when a shot won't work because they have too high of a resistance from the mom's milk/antibodies but their own antibodies are too weak to fight off the disease by themselves.  But since your dog is 1 year old, I don't think any of these issues should come into play.<br>  <br>  The parvo vaccine is highly effective, so I would doubt it's parvo, unless your puppy didn't have his full series of shots.|`|jzl2hxdaaa	it's not Parvo. If your dog has parvo you know it. They are fine and then they are deathly ill.  They will have bloody diarea and lots of it. Although dogs who have had their shots can still get parvo. I had a puppy that got parvo at about 20 weeks old but had already had three shots. If they have had their shots they can actually live through it, but if they haven't they will not live. Maybe your dogs stomach was upset from the stress of the other dog invading his territory. Ihope this helps:)|`|3zv2bbolaa	If he has been vaccinated, chances are slim to none that he has parvo, but he may have picked up another infectious disease. If the diarrhea isn't cleared up after 48 hours, go ahead and take him to your vet.|`|C1eHfhrHaa	Could just be nerves.  If it doesn't clear up in the next day or so, give the vet a call.

Mutts have to be my top fav though cause they are mostly in the shelters and are in need of good homes. I did grow up with a Bernese Mountain Dog and in my opinion he was the most loyal, friendly, smartest dog I have met. I'm not a huge fan of really small dogs like the poodles and chihuahuas. They are usually just peeing machines. But cute|`|PM23RDycaa	Best - the properly trained and socialized one with an owner who didn't impulsively buy the animal.<br>  <br>  Worst - the spoiled, untrained often aggressive dog, more often than not a small breed as their owners treat them like babies.|`|ALQuQaLGaa	I'm not a huge fan of Chihuahuas either.  They're one of the few breeds I don't like.  In my opinion, they're little piranhas with feet.<br>  <br>  I don't think that ANY breed of dog is born mean just because it's that breed.  I think that most dogs that are mean, became mean because someone made them mean.  Almost any dog will become vicious in cruel hands.  <br>  <br>  However, some breeds tend to be more suitable for children.<br>  <br>  As far as the best breed, a lot of this is subjective.  My dogs and cats have all been rescues, and in my opinion those are the best.  I really love collies, Shelties (they resemble little collies but they are NOT miniature collies, I recently found out), retrievers, however.  Some breeds, like boxers, great Danes, LOOK ferocious but most are quite gentle really.  <br>  <br>  There's a lot to take into consideration when picking out a breed of dog.<br>  You have to consider your lifestyle, where you live, and your family.  Bloodhounds tend to be very gentle dogs, but are they suitable for children?  They tend to be lethargic and the child might be disappointed because the dog wants to rest all the time.  Great Danes, like I said, are mostly gentle but if you live in a tiny apartment it would be very unhappy.  <br>  <br>  I don't like the idea of any dog living outdoors.  Dogs are social animals and need to be around people.  Maybe this is my opinion, but I think it's cruel to cut them off from human contact.  I have a German Shepherd and she is mostly an indoor dog.  <br>  <br>  www.SoYouWanna.com is a great website with how-to articles on a variety of topics.<br>  <br>  If you visit the site, go to the "Lifestyle" section.

I think people are generally drawn to certain breeds/temperments for a reason.|`|MpzPfzivaa	I really don't think there is a best or worst.

I suggest you go to this website, it should help you determine the best for you.<br>   <br>  For me, the best dog is a mix breed found at the shelter. Mix breeds tend not to have the chance of being inbred.

You must speak the same one or two words to them every morning when you feed them. I feed my dogs twice a day and give them treats when they surprise me with some antic that gets my attention.

Never let a bird have the pits or seeds of any tree fruit--most are poison.<br>  <br>  Found a list of fresh fruits and veg that birds can eat at www.birds-online.de. It's actually a budgie-specific website, but if it's not safe for a budgie, it may not be safe for any pet bird.|`|PNLNewgQaa	Dates are not poisonous to any bird that i know of, but, remember not give birds the pits of fruits, because they are poisonous.

B6zl0AJDaa	First of all, you don't "REGISTER" horses, they normally get registered with a breed association upon birth (Unless it's a colour registry.).  <br>  <br>  1.)  A Breed registered horse is worth more than a grade (Non registered) horse.<br>  <br>  2.)  It's a way to see what ancestors your horse has (Some famous, some imfamous).<br>  <br>  3.)  You can compete in breed associated horse shows.  Some bigger breed shows you win MONEY.<br>  <br>  4.)  You can race some breeds (TB and QHs)|`|HCuArmpGaa	well they are generally worth more. You can track their bloodlines, be sure they are purebred, participate in certain horse shows. It is pretty expensive though to keep up with the registries.|`|8bTder08aa	A registered horse can compete in shows specific for its breed, e.g., AQHA or Arabian or Morgan, etc.<br>  <br>  For some equine activities, a horse must be registered in order to compete.  Horses that compete in races on which state-sanctioned pari-mutuel wagering is allowed have to registered members of their breed:  e.g., Thoroughbred, Standardbred, AQHA, Appaloosa, Arabian.  This is partly tradition, racing having arisen as a means of identifying the superior athletes within the horse population, and breeding those individuals to make improvements within the breed, and partly to protect the people who wager on race horses by providing valid identification and background on the competing horses so that people know the horse they are betting on is the horse it is identified as.<br>  <br>  Registration is a validation of a horse's pedigree.  At its most basic, registration provides a record of a horse's parents and ancestors going as far back as the stud book for the registry has records.  (In the case of Thoroughbreds, there are valid and verifiable pedigree records going back to the 1600's).  When pedigree records are coupled with performance records, the database compiled enables breeders to identify horses that have the potential to produce superior performers.  <br>  <br>  You are correct that in many cases, pedigree doesn't matter.  There are many disciplines where a horse can compete without pedigree-- show jumping, dressage, eventing, many of the hunter and English disciplines, endurance, combined driving, and polo come immediately to mind.  <br>  <br>  It is also true that once a horse is foaled, pedigree takes a back-seat to the horse's quality as an individual.  Triple Crown winner Secretariat had had a full sister, The Bride, who "couldn't beat a fat man in a race downhill," according to breeder Penny Tweedy;  and Horse of the Year John Henry had a pedigree that was mediocre at best.  <br>  <br>  FWIW, if you and your cousin buy a grown horse that is not registered and are told that if you want to, you can register it, be careful:  someone posted a question here about whether she could register a 6-year-old Thoroughbred that had never been registered.  The answer was yes, but it would have cost her $2000 to do so-- that's what it costs to register a Thoroughbred older than 2 years of age.  Most breeds impose a penalty for delayed registration of horses.|`|N2jvxYPcaa	There are many advantages of registering your horse.<br>  1) It proves what breed and type of horse the parents were. This is important. If you want to buy a good show horse, you are going to want to find a horse that has two parents that were good in the show ring. This positively increases the chances that their foal will have the type of movement, the looks and conformation and the temperment to succeed in the ring. Likewise, two race horses are more likely to produce a foal that can race well, as compared to two non-race horses. So the main things registering your horse does is - proves your horse's genetics.<br>  2) A registered horse has a proven paper showing their age. This can be very benefitical if you aren't an expert when you're horse shopping. It can tell you whether the horse is 5, or 15.<br>  3) You are required to have registration papers on horses for some types of horse shows, and for some types of horse racing. No registration papers, no chance to enter these things.<br>  4) Your horse's value will be increased. People will pay more for a registered horse than a grade (non-registered horse) for the reasons I've given.<br>  5) You will increase the value of any foal your horse produces, because people want registered horses and not grade horses.<br>  The only disadvantage of having your horse registered is - there is a fee for registering your horse, and then for transfering the registration. But that fee will definetly pay for itself in the long run.|`|DdpvxfkNaa	There are breed shows. Like the Arab Nationals. So you register your horse and you can show in the Breed Shows. Also, a registered horse has papers which is what you'd want to buy a horse. Also, if a horse is SweepStakes Nominated you win money! Good luck and hope this helps!|`|4627db3161084bce021d06067966d9f0aa	You can keep track of the bloodline, and if you are going to ever sell a horse, the new buyers want to know the bloodline, since some horses are bred to race, be a cutting horse, roping horse, trail horse, etc.|`|cVABV2snaa	Here are a few of the many vast reasons that a horse can, and should be registered.<br>  <br>  A) A registration is something like a deed to a car.  It is a proof of ownership of the animal.  It shows the past owners as well as the present owner, so no one can try to say you "stole" their horse, or get you in trouble in any way.  So it actually protects you, as well as your horse.<br>  B) With registries there are more events you might be able to attend that would suit your horses specific breed.  Thinking on things like Quarter Horse Congress, where you can actually make money, and get more prestige for a stallion, mare or gelding.  It allows you to be able to compete with people that know and better understand the breed of horse which you are competing with.<br>  C) Obviously if your horse is good at what it does, and you compete in new shows, your horse will be worth money, this is good if you ever look to breed.<br>  D) It is proof of your horses parentage, and then you also know what your horse might have been bred for.  If it has say Native Dancer lines, it might be good for racing, or jumping depending on the other things that have been bred into it.<br>  <br>  When looking for a horse, I would recommend looking at ones that are registered, it just makes like a whole lot easier to deal with.|`|NCx3dpleaa	Registration isn't a requirement for any horse if you are just looking for a pal to enjoy. For certain shows, the horses must be of a particular registry, depending on what that club prefers. There are also benefits in breeding horses to having a registered horse, but papers can also be 'altered" to go with any horse, so this is not always a plus. Blood typing and dna have gone a long way to verify true parentage and help keep more horses legitimate as to what they are supposed to be according to their registered papers. We owned a registered Quarter Horse once who was in actual fact an Appaloosa. The farm that bred him kept two stallions, one was a Quarter Horse, the other an Appaloosa. This foal was born with no apparent Appy traits, so they "swapped" sires so that the foal would have more value as people feel a papered animal has more true breeding and is "better" than a grade animal. Since there was doubt the foal could achieve Appy papers, he was changed to Quarter Horse and the papers were awarded. However, this guy did have Appy traits and if he'd ever been shown at a QH show, someone would most likely have turned him in as a fraud. We didn't care to show at registered QH shows, never promoted him as a purebred QH, but did try to educate people on what can be done to get papers where they are not appropriate.<br>  Breed regsirties offer many benefits to their members who own papered horses for their group. From special shows and awards with possible financial gain, to discounts on many products ranging from insurance, car rentals to clothing or horse products. They provide directories to help one gain education on ownership, find trainers, breeders and farms. They provide a feeling of belonging with others of similar interests sometimes from all over the world.<br>  But if this doesn't interest you, there is not one thing wrong with a good, unregistered horse. Emphasis on good.|`|FcR8G8hPaa	A registered horse is more valuable for resale. You can find out past owners, be sure of his age, know his training and also his experience and success in showing.<br>  <br>  You also can compete in breed specific shows and have the various benefits of being a member of a breed organization.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps!|`|n2dUmfcQaa	you have to have them reg, to go to shows! at the shows they put points on there name, and some breeders get points on there name if one of there foal get points!

Responsible breeders may have Websites for their kennels for information purposes, but the puppies are mostly sold through referral or word of mouth. A good breeder wants the puppies to go to the best home possible, so they meet with the buyer face to face and check references before selling the puppy. Some even do a home check first.
RT8LZy7gaa	Raising an orphan kitten takes alot of work and dedication but it can be done.  Feed the baby with a bottle you can buy at your local pet store and use the special kitten milk they sell as well (called KMR here, comes in cans or powdered).  They need to be fed every couple of hours.  You'll need to keep it warm and in a box so no other animals can get to it.  You'll need to stimulate it to pee and poo, until it learns to use the litterbox, at around 6-7 weeks. Use only clay litter, not clumping because they can ingest it or get it on their little bottoms and it's hell to get off!<br>  <br>  I raised one kitten someone brought me at about 10 days old (his eyes weren't even open yet).  I worked at a vet so that made it alot easier, I kept him with me 24/7.  I carried him in my pocket when I was working the front desk.<br>  <br>  Then I had a litter of three I raised from just a few days old.  Amazingly, my shepherd mix became very attached to them and used to mother them (clean them, alert me when they were mewling in their box, let them snuggle in her fur).  That was pretty amazing as she's usually uberhyper.<br>  <br>  So it can be done.  You just need to devote alot of time to raising them.|`|rbloxE6paa	yes - I got mine aged 5 weeks because her mum wasn't feeding her. had to spoon-feed the little thing for about a week but she is fine.|`|AA11893242	Yes u just need to give it milk in a bottle|`|r9mNxWLKaa	no she will probley not make it like my cat did|`|RN1wGlWWaa	Yes but it would take a lot of care and extra feedings, etc.|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	Yes but it needs special care.  It needs to be bottle fed (kitten formula, not cow's milk) along with some solid food for a couple more weeks and kept warm.  It will need to learn to eat solid food and use a litter box.  It's best for kittens to stay with their mother till at least 10 weeks old but if the kitten is an orphan, it can be raised by hand.  You need lots of patience and time to devote to it. If you have an orphan kitten, the best route is to see if any shelters near you have a nursing mother cat who could "adopt" it. If not the shelter can give invaluable advice on rearing the kitten yourself.
wF52XMxAaa	The first question is why she's biting.  There are many possible causes, of which "hormones" are one - but it's both the easiest to blame and the hardest to deal with. You didn't say how old she is.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://thetrueparrot.homestead.com/FAQbite.html" rel="nofollow">http://thetrueparrot.homestead.com/FAQbi...</a> is a good general article on biting.  <a href="http://www3.upatsix.com/liz/articles/biting2.html" rel="nofollow">http://www3.upatsix.com/liz/articles/bit...</a> has a little more on hormonal biting.  <br>  <br>  If it is hormonal, you should also avoid anything that makes her more broody.  <a href="http://www.tgpa.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.tgpa.com/</a> has a good discussion of controlling lighting.  Avoid boxes or anything else like a nesting cavity, or petting her under her wings or on her lower back.  Discourage her regurgitating to you, if she does.  Distract her if she displays to you.  Watch carefully for signs of hormone overload and don't pick her up when she's likely to bite.|`|cI19nesraa	Respect the fact that she is hormonal and don't stress her or give her opportunities to bite.  If she is now sexually mature you will have to accept this part of her personality.  Do not allow any aggressive behavior toward any one as this sometimes comes with maturity also.
iJtuhLMTaa	Antique bird cages generally contain lead weldings or a lead coating making them unsitable to house birds in.  They also tend to be far to small to house birds suitable in and contain far to many ortamental nooks and cranies that can catch a wing or a foot injuring the bird.  If you want a pet bird you will need to get a new suitable cage for it.   As far as species if you want a cage bird finches or a pair of doves would be a good choice.

2G6b5y8Taa	my chihuahua us to do the something to me the way we corrected her was to tell her not if she tried to eat from our plates of take food from us when we where eating and if she dint take the human food we gave her a dog treat and said good girl. i don't know if this will work with you chihuahua but it is worth a try another thing we found that helps is we wont let her in the kitchen of near the kitchen table|`|bIaywrBCaa	you are allowing this to happen. Do not let the child eat it where the chi can take it away from him. You can't expect to put the food in front of the chi and not have him want it. If you have to, put the chi in a crate on another room while your son eats.|`|T864ejaiaa	you'll have to stay on him. when he gets near your son tell him no and to go lay down. you have to be firm and sound like you mean business. and make him move away from your son. put a leash on him and make him move. or you can simply put the dog in a room or out side when your son eats. when my dogs do that all i have to do is look at them and i tell them to go lay down and they go lay down. that's one thing i can't stand is for a dog to be right up under me when i'm eating. they have their food and it's not human food. human food will eventually kill a dog. by the way i have a male peek, 2 chihuahua's, one pug nose, 1 dotson and 1 german shepard. if i can train 6 dogs to act right. you can train 1. good luck.|`|OxFsslN8aa	If the dog got "human" food even once it will continue to wait for it.  Don't feed the dog from your hand ever.  Also, teach your dog the "leave it" command.  Have your dog sit in front of you; put a treat on the floor to the side of you and tell him "leave it".  After 5 seconds give him another treat (never the one on the floor).  Each time you practice extend the length of time he has to leave it.  Soon you will be able to tell him to leave it in regards to your son or the food on the table.  Its all about training and consistency.|`|BWZ6pBoHaa	YOU could perhaps train the dog?  You could, perhaps, put the dog in his crate when you are eating? You could teach your son to eat at the table?|`|nOoPtw97aa	I have a chihuahua too and he does the same thing. I'm interested in seeing what responses everyone has|`|2HuuSi3Maa	that is actually really common first thing you could try doing is change the dogs food to something different with more flavors every time that the dog goes to grad the food make sure just to tap his nose so that he understands that he was bad and wasn't supposed to do that and stay continuous also with the gate it is most likely because he wants the food that bad so try your hardest to keep the gate up and than hell learn but i would suggest not using the gate because you ll have to do that every time your son has food which will begin to be a hassle.hope that helps|`|nd30LQhlaa	well you should start by not allowing the chi to go into the kitchen or any area of the house that you eat in,and yes that means putting up the baby gate..remeber your not being mean just ignore him when he wines and he will stop after awhile...and any time he stops winning you sahould throw him a treat that way he learns the he will only get the attetion he wants by behaving =]<br>  So good luck and you have to be constant  because your baiscaly teaching him a new trick that will make everyone happy.
C3kq600Taa	It's possible that your cat just doesn't feel the bathroom is a safe enough den for her kitten. Would it be possible to let her out of the bathroom to find a more suitable location where you can put the kitten box? Or maybe she thinks that if you can leave the room, she should be able to leave as well? Cats usually don't like being treated like lepers and separated from their human family like that. :)|`|eNq3DOWmaa	thats cute lol

KEYgd73saa	If the Biozyme worked like it should (based on the label, not the science it seems to have ignored), you won't get an ammonia spike, as any ammonia produced by the fish will be immediately oxidized to nitrite, and immediately oxidized to nitrate.  However, it's much more likely that you simply haven't stocked the tank enough-- 5 small fish in 55 gallons of water produces VERY dilute amounts of ammonia.  If you want the tank to cycle, you'll need more fish.<br>  <br>  As I alluded to in my first sentence, I am no fan of "instant cycle" products.  Nitrifying bacteria do not freeze, freeze dry, or do anything else that lends itself to being packaged and saved for later use-- these actions KILL the bacteria.  You'd be much better off trying to get your money back and investing that money in more water conditioner for the water changes you'll soon need to be doing to keep the fish alive through the cycle process.
p3vjvzRPaa	The way a dog looks as a pup is very different to how they look as an adult.  For example, dogs with long pointy noses (eg a greyhound) have pretty short noses as puppies.  <br>  <br>  So, trying to figure out a breed from what it looked like as a pup, without photos is pretty hard!<br>  <br>  I reckon you should borrow a book of dog breeds from your local library and look through it - then you see what the adult version of each breed looks like, which is what is important.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.<br>  <br>  P.S. certainly would buy from the boxer breeder you gave a link to!|`|ERjGLJaEaa	Could have been a pit puppy or maybe a boxer.

IuYekkPVaa	Some plants such as geranium, coleus cannina, and marigolds are said to have scents that keep cats away.  However I think this depends upon the individual cat because I've heard that they hate lavender and yet my two are happy to sit next to the lavender bush in our garden. You could try prickly potted plants such as cactus or roses.<br>  <br>  Ultrasonic cat deterrents are said to be a very effective and humane method of keeping cats at bay.  The cat's movement triggers the sensor which then emits either an ultrasonic (inaudible to humans) noise which they hate or a sudden burst of water.  They're relatively cheap to buy and easy to install.

Same time every morning, you need to take her out and in the evenings at the same time. She′s 7 and shouldn′t be using paper anymore. If you are concistant with the time, she will find you more reliable, and will not depend on paper anymore. A good time to take her out is a half hour after eating. Eating times must also be scheduled, and strictly followed. Dogs depend on routine greatly, otherwise they will just get sloppy. If she doesn′t go poo right away, make sure she knows that this isn′t play time, but a time for doing her business. So, don′t play with her at this time. Just stand there and say GO POO. and eventually she will calm down and get the idea. Remember, you have to give her time to do her business. IF need be, leave her outside to do her business. Reward her when she is done with a small treat.<br>  <br>  Eventually, she will get used to the routine and will expect to eat and go to the bathroom at certain times. Some dogs get vocal at these times, when they know you have forgotten. But, you have to start the process first. It should take less than a couple weeks for her to get it. It really depends on you to be consistant. <br>  <br>  So, after you have made a routine for yourself and the dog, then you can teach her how to use the bell. Here is a website with the information on how to do this<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Potty-Train-Your-Puppy-Using-a-Bell" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Potty-Train-Your-...</a>|`|T864ejaiaa	i always take mine out 20 to 30 mins after eating. 5 mins after drinking. you could stand by the door and ask if she wants to go out and scratch on the door. maybe that will work. you could always ask a dog trainer.

Also, if you got bored of your little minnow and wanted to release it, it might have gotten something from your brothers fish that it would then transmit into the wild.|`|LHiEoAOCaa	Well it depends on what kind of fish he has in his fish tank and how big it is. If you ask your little brother what kind of fish he has and how big his fish tank is we could help you out a little more. Minnows are also cold water so his other fish could be tropical and need warm water. Minnows also have to be kept in schools of 6+ so stay happy and healthy.
FvAl3UgQaa	It sounds like it is gasping because when a tortoise goes on its back, the lungs (which would usually be on top) are then being crushed by its other vital organs and they are basically suffocating... Hopefully you got to it in time. <br>  <br>  Is this your pet tortoise, or one you found in the wild? Regardless, all you can really do is give it a drink by standing it in a shallow dish of warm water (as they often urinate in panic when they tip over and dehydrate really quickly, especially if they tip when they're somewhere hot) and then keep it in the appropriate conditions for its species (offering food, water, and ensuring correct temperatures and lighting - all of which I can't advise on without more details of what tortoise this is.)<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  *******************************<br>  <br>  Please update as soon as you get a chance. Thanks.|`|2YIxnXXyaa	She's probably just shocked, and was possibly close to suffocating.<br>  <br>  When a turtle/tortoise gets flipped upside down, there's only minutes for it to survive.  If it's in the wild, the sun either bakes it, or it's intestines and insides will start to collapse on the lugs, causing it to suffocate.<br>  <br>  What I would do is keep a close eye on him for the rest of the day, if he's in a really small enclosure, he won't stop trying to flip himself upside down, he's trying to get out.<br>  Try to put him in a regular sized tank with some hay or reptile pellets, or even some shredded up news paper for now.<br>  <br>  If in a day he's still acting lethargic, I would suggest calling a vet.<br>  <a href="http://www.austinsturtlepage.com/Info/state_resources.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.austinsturtlepage.com/Info/st...</a><br>  That's a list of vets that handle turtles.<br>  <br>  Hope he's okay, good luck.|`|EtasLJB0aa	This animal MUST go to the vet. If it's that bad then only a reptile vet can tell what's going on. No risks should be taken with this animal if you really feel that its life is at stake.|`|60ac7sE3aa	if you are in Extreme need you should go to the vet  its the best possible thing to do|`|2z69twcpaa	the tortoise needs time to recover, it may have been on its back for quite some time and now is very stressed and probably a bit shocked, it is gasping for breath as (as alex d stated) a tortoises lungs are on the top of its internal body and being on its back has squashed them, what the tortoise needs now is to be kept warm  and quiet place it in a bowl and give it a warm bath, fill the bowl so the water comes up to the tortoises bottom shell, it only needs to be deep enough so the tortoise can drink if needed,  then place it in a box with shredded newspaper, you can feed it some lettuce, cucumber, even a bit of apple if you have it, but the main thing is to let it settle down some where warm, if it is a wild tortoise then you can take it to a vet for treatment and you won't get charged (or shouldn't do) there will be a lot of lactic acid build up in the body where it got stressed, the problem is stress can kill a tortoise so for now (if you are not taking it to a vet to be checked over) it needs some peace and quiet and time to relax, don't handle it too much as this will stress it at the moment, if it is still gasping tomorrow then you need to get it to a vet for treatment,  but at the moment a drink and food and somewhere warm and calm will help, as the tortoise is probably dehydrated you can in this case feed some ice berg lettuce, it is 90% water and usually it does not good for tortosies but in cases of dehydration it can be useful in the aid of rehydration, it possibly will look like it is in pain as the lungs need to work properly again and the lactic acid from the struggle and stress will not do it any good, it needs to gain its strength again before it will support itself.|`|7MCgP4nCaa	sounds like he's hungry. That's what my turtles did when they were hungry. Go to a pet store, get some food.. either worms, shrimp, or a commercially prepared diet. Then try to give him some lettuce (romaine-has more nutrients than iceberg, which is just water really). A little apple sauce (sugar free) may help as well.<br>  Try to keep him heated, and give him calcium (vitamin d, from light, actually aids in the digestion of calcium which is essential to reppys).
u3ElUnJIaa	Ok depending on her size and how fat her tail is she should be eating around 4-5 super worms per day if that is the only thing she is getting fed.  You really need to be feeding her dusted crickets as a staple diet though.  Super worms are very high in fat content and are not really good to be the only thing she eats.|`|b00a009ecc7fe6365d7194bf65086e3eaa	Not sure but I though Gecko's threw up a little if they ate too much?<br>  <br>  I know my daughter feeds her geckos only once or twice a week (she lets them loose in the cricket tank) and they have been thriving real good for the past 2 years!
FcR8G8hPaa	Horses behaving this way are having a training problem and do not need to be chased on lunge or in the round pen to "get their energy out". This simply connects you with fear and lack of discipline and that's not what you want.<br>  <br>  OTTBs always need significant retraining. It's great that you bought him and want to do well with him, but without the retraining, you are not going to be able to help him and his problems may grow worse. I strongly recommend professional help from a trainer who has a good record of success with OTTB. Even advice from such a person will help. You may also want to take some lessons from them to help reinforce the right things with your horse.<br>  <br>  The horse is tossing his head and misbehaving because he is confused. The language of the aids is not inborn - it's part of a careful training program that can be done wrong or damaged. You can damage that training (unintentionally), and from the gradual deterioration of his behavior this is likely what's happening.<br>  <br>  Let's take a made up example: when you squeeze your legs, it makes him uncomfortable - so he bolts off and you reduce the pressure. He learns to do the last thing that released the pressure - so you have just taken a step toward actually training him to misbehave. It will get worse as you continue to reinforce the behavior. He's not misbehaving, by the way - he's doing what you're teaching him.<br>  <br>  I'll also point out that racing, barrels, and jumping are all disciplines that involving taking this horse very close to his flight response. It takes a lot of work and care to keep this from also eroding training, because flight response overwhelms learned response - it's instinctive and he hears your aids much less when he's running.<br>  <br>  You need to go back and think about how you are working with this horse on the ground. Are you reinforcing stillness, quietness and obedience at all times?<br>  <br>  If you lunge the horse, are you preventing bolting, bucking and other flight responses by forcing down transitions the moment they start? Are you keeping him slow, controlled and relaxed at all gaits?<br>  <br>  When you ride the horse at a walk, do you force an immediate down transition at the slightest speed up? Same at trot and canter?<br>  <br>  Are you riding him on loose rein / light contact (ounces), or are you always tight on his face? He needs to be kept loose and light or you will detrain the stop cue from the reins.<br>  <br>  In dressage work are you stopping the horse frequently and rewarding him?<br>  <br>  When jumping, do you require him to trot out after the jumps 90% of the time? Do you avoid chaining jumps most of the time in practice?<br>  <br>  Do you do lots of up and down transitions, especially at canter?<br>  <br>  Do you reinforce stop with a hard half halt for failure to stop, or do you let him walk on after you cue whoa? If the latter, you need to stop that, because you are detraining the stop.<br>  <br>  If the answer to any of these is no, you need to change to do things the other way. The other way will help retrain his stop and get him listening and less excited. It may not seem fancy and your friends who jump may think this looks funny, but these are the things trainers do to fix horses training. You need to think of yourself as a trainer, even if you have a horse trainer fix your horse. Your actions over years are far more effective than a month or two of training.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps. Best wishes to you and your horse!|`|MUfMJYHGaa	Check your saddle fit. He may be anticipating some discomfort when you get on. He may also need a good warm up routine , like some work in the pen or stretching or massage if he tends to have "cold back" or a little muscle stiffness from standing around.And check your feed program. If he is getting a high protein feed, sometimes they get a lactic acid buildup in the muscles that makes everything stiff and sore and they will act uncomfortable because they are!Make sure he gets good cool down time after a workout|`|fhhxfmteaa	<a href="http://readyin.surfs.it" rel="nofollow">http://readyin.surfs.it</a><br>  A very informative website you can also get much information in website|`|STweWXqAaa	Do you mean he doesn't stand to mount? When I'm riding a horse that does that, if they start to move before I'm up I get back down and make the horse back up, because a horse would rather stand still than be made to back up. This takes a few tries, but with practice he should be standing for you in no time.<br>  <br>  I don't know what kinds of problems you're having with him, but whenever I have a problem with a horse I ask myself what I'm doing and what I do before the problem occurs. If you know this horse used to be well behaved then it is most likely something you're doing that is causing the problem; it's almost always the fault of the rider. Just think about what you're doing and try to correct yourself when you make a mistake, and if it's not something you're doing then be sure to correct your horse the second he does something wrong so he learns what is correct.|`|nhGj844Gaa	If he's being sour and cranky all of the sudden when you go to get on him, it is most likely because he is experiencing discomfort. Is your tack properly fit for him? It could be pinching him and making him uncomfortable. Or it might be even worse..he could be having pain in his back and knows that  when he gets ridden, the pain is worse. Or it could even be his teeth - has he seen the dentist regularly?|`|RloOJ43haa	1. Just because a saddle has an adjustable gullet, that does not guarantee it fits the horse. My saddler says that the Wintecs have an arc in the tree and do not fit all horses. So, check the saddle fit with a saddler. Also, your horse's back may have changed over time. <br>  2. You need to get your horse's teeth checked evey six months. <br>  3. Something in his back or legs may by hurting him. <br>  4. If he used to be a dream and now you are having problems, then something in your horse handling is not clear to him. Try working with a trainer for a few sessions or taking some lessons to get you back on the right path.|`|6irSIW7xaa	I would check the saddle fit. The tree should not be sitting on the withers too wide or too narrow. Sometimes it's just as much as getting a different saddle that can make all the difference in the world. If not try getting his back adjusted. In short it just sounds like some sort of back problem (back pain or saddle fit wise).
O0AfxH9Eaa	It will pass. He has been away and he smells of the vet's. They will get used to him again.|`|zpwJR60baa	Hi, I am a cat behavior. It should changed.  Cat can smell the chemical from the surgery, and they are finicky on the smell.  My female cats hates it, when the male cat comes back from the hospital every single time. Give them a week...<br>  <br>  Also tumbs up for getting your male cat fixed.  He will have a lower temperament, and a longer life.|`|Zbn8A7Geaa	It will pass.  He smells completely different to them now that he's fixed and not exuding testosterone.  Plus he was gone for a couple of days so they may think it's odd he's returned smelling that way.  It will be okay.  They'll get along again probably before the end of the day.|`|htD82ij1aa	it will pass when fixed or spayed a cats scent changes and it's kind of like bringing home a new cat, they should get along again soon enough.  they might have a few fights for dominance, but they should be fine.|`|DVDYDaVSaa	This isn't uncommon. He smells like strange animals and like the vet's office, and your other kitties are aware of that.  They should be back to normal soon.|`|jauVVrzTaa	They can smell the strange smells he has brought back from the vets. It will be fine in a couple of days.
N3iaUGMaaa	Depending on the amount of poison that the rat ate then, yes it is possible.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	Yes - either very sick or possible death - depends on what type of poison the rat died from.|`|tnTxHVO5aa	Cat will die too.|`|hUYaaXBvaa	i think so if its not fully digested in the mouse|`|7585zXZIaa	depends on how much poison but it will mst likely get sick|`|TfLPRwFWaa	yes its pssible.<br>  <br>  this is funny :P|`|Zbn8A7Geaa	He may not die because the poison has changed it's base chemical make-up once it was digested by the rat.  It may not be enough now to kill the cat.   But the cat may very well get sick and possibly to the point of needing vet treatment.  If you know this happened, you should call the vet right away to get advice on what to do and what symptoms to look out for.|`|IVC7z0vlaa	yes, they will either get really sick or die! Rat traps are the safest way to go, or get more cats!|`|69b929d341b49df84c23149c7790163faa	yes..Our pot belly pig died, so I'm sure a cat will too if he eats a poisonous rat|`|krI2fziJaa	Possibly, but my stupid dog once found a box of d-con and ate it. she didn't die or get sick..|`|Ger00LNNaa	yeaa its possible|`|5lYg5iejaa	guess so|`|b87482cd8013bcfad52b6cff60829a6eaa	yes|`|qwvijKexaa	yes|`|xq2J2LMSaa	It's possible, but the reason rat poison works is because rats can't vomit, so they don't need much. If the cat eats a poison-filled rat, it can vomit to get rid of the poison.<br>  BUT! If the reason you're asking is because there are people poisoning rats in the area, it is possible your cat can get into the same poison, and that is a much bigger problem.|`|AA10301196	If the poison has not digested entirely from the rat, the cat can get sick.  It depends on the amount left in the rat's stomach after ingestion, and how much is in the rat's system.  A cat will likely not die, but can be made sick, depending on the age/health of the cat.|`|1j7QLM7Saa	No, the amount of poison needed to kill a mouse is way less than needed to kill a common house cat, however if you stacked a bunch for the rat yes, but if not, your cat will not die, it might get sick, but i recommend sending it to the vet asap weather or not you have doubts of its well being|`|xj280ezcaa	If it's your cat then I'm very sorry, but yes it can.
IuYekkPVaa	Spaying (ovariohysterectomy) means that the cat's ovaries and uterus are removed.  There are two techniques for performing the surgery.  In North America, vets typically make an incision in the cat's abdomen to perform the ovariohyserectomy.  In the UK and Europe, vets tend to perform what is known as a "left lateral flank spay" which involves making a small incision through the lateral abdominal wall of the cat. Basically, this technique involves going through the side of the animal as opposed to the animal's stomach area. Vets in Europe have found this that this procedure is more cost effective, time efficient, and safe for the cats. (Originally, this technique was developed for use on feral cats, who were going to be released into the wild within 48 hours of having the surgery.) <br>  <br>  A less popular alternative to spaying is a procedure called "tubal ligation".  This makes the female sterile, but does not prevent her from coming into heat and attracting males.|`|DVDYDaVSaa	Differences from what?  They're different from how male cats are "fixed," but all female cats are spayed the same way--removing the uterus and ovaries.|`|DtkLsetkaa	Female spaying is removal of the ovaries and uterus, and they are all spayed the same way unless there are medical restrictions, is this what you were asking?|`|zpwJR60baa	Your question is vague do you mean between male and female?<br>  <br>  Female spaying is removal of the ovaries and uterus<br>  Male their balls get removed.
8NSh1D4Maa	Cover exposed cords with this stuff: <a href="http://www.crittercord.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.crittercord.com/</a>  I have yet to find a taste deterrent that works consistently with rabbits.  Most actually like those bitter sprays sold as chewing deterrents.  The only spray on product I've had any success with is Fooey, but even that will not deter all of them.  I use dog pens to gate off areas with any cords when they are out, cover exposed cords with critter cord or hard plastic corrugated covers, run cords under carpets, etc.  Best is to prevent as much as possible.  The bunny should also not be out unsupervised unless in an entirely bunnyproofed area, not only is the cord chewing inconvenient for you, it is dangerous for the rabbit.|`|8ym4ypABaa	Try some bitter apple spray (you can get this at pet stores)<br>  <br>  If that doesn't work then you need to keep her in an enclosed space where she cant get to her favorite places to chew.<br>  <br>  When she starts chewing distract her with a toy, cardboard..etc. I got my rabbit a cottontail cottage (it stopped him from chewing things because he now had a huge house that he could chew anywhere) <a href="http://www.catsandrabbitsandmore.com/cottontail_cottages" rel="nofollow">http://www.catsandrabbitsandmore.com/cot...</a><br>  <br>  Put pillows/blankets/boxes..where she likes to chew..so she cant get there<br>  <br>  You can buy cord covers at petstores so she can't get at your wires<br>  <br>  You can distract her by clapping or making a loud noise<br>  <br>  Get her spayed when shes old enough<br>  <br>  <br>  Just remember...rabbits can easily die from ingesting too much carpet (ive had a lot of friends rabbits die from this). So if she is a free roaming rabbit she needs to be supervised 24/7.<br>  <br>  And DONT try bleach!!!!!!! that could kill her!|`|Nhje1U06aa	She is still young that's why she is chewing. <br>  The larger sized rabbits usually grow out of it. Does her tooth need to be trimmed . Take her to a vet to see.  I use the cat no scratch spray from petco - I have a girl who is fixed 2 years old and is still a chewer. My little boy Holland lop is very sweet and not destructive.  Try putting wicker baskets around with hay and paper towel holders-  this can be something to play with outside of her cage instead of the wires. Be patient and don't yell it only makes it worse
2G6b5y8Taa	my dogs play the same way but our youngest just fights back but if the younger puppy is scared you should really try to correct the older puppy the younger puppy might just not understand that the older one is playing like you do|`|WJjr2E0haa	Well, as long as neither one of your dogs are getting hurt then this should build a great friendship. Remember to use positive reinforcement when you are trying to teach your dog something. Maybe get some treats and when he is bothering your younger pup too much then try and get his mind off of it with some training. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|4KTmiQ0paa	My dogs are the same way, but my older dog is smaller (but stronger) and and my younger dog is significantly larger (the older can walk beneath the younger without crouching). It may seem ok now, but when they're older, it may lead to more serious problems because they will be so accustomed to the way they are currently playing. If you are ever holding the younger pup and she yelps or nips when you touch any particular spot on her body, you should keep them separated to see if the soft spot is bruising from the older pup or a more serious condition.
kj5NhDPPaa	A dragon gobies diet is ghost shrimp and black worms. they will also eat frozen brine shrimp.|`|QrjjiOgTaa	frozen food, blood worms, brine shrimp, mysis shrimp. i guess they would even eat live brine shrimp. contrary to pet stores they do not eat any prepared foods or feeders. and they are some what brackish so add some aquarium salt to the water.
SZOMVGBRaa	Take six Cichlids of whatever you want to breed. Get them when they are about 2-3 inch's and put them in a 55 gallon tank. Keep their water as clean as possible and feed them lots of good foods. In about a year or less they will pair off and start to spawn. Or being that both the fish you mentioned are cheaper types you can just get in touch with your local fish club and somebody will be happy to sell you a breeding pair. Maybe it wil cost you about 25- 40 dollars.  Here's a good recipe for food that will plump them up fast and aid you in your effort's. <a href="http://www.gcca.net/howto/fish_food.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.gcca.net/howto/fish_food.htm</a><br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|8j7FCEOraa	If they are anything like my cichlids, just put a few of them in a tank and they will multiply like crazy on their own.|`|QJ19OBCbaa	Only the best of the best can breed mbuna cichlids. I know, I've been there. You need commitment, determination and more than a little testicular fortitude. You sound like you might have what it takes. Maybe, maybe. The first step is to just focus on cichlids, 24 hours a day for a month. At the end of the month call me - there is much work to be done.
Wv592rOqaa	I think it best you ask your vet before self medicating your pet, who I am sure you love and want to ease his/her pain.  Some medications are toxic to dogs and cats.  In my few years of research rats are used because dogs are not good candidates for experimental medications - and of course the animal rights people would be all over experimenters.  <br>  <br>  Water therapy is an excellent relief to arthritis pain in pets - if you have access to a pool in which he/she can wade in the water.  Massages also help.|`|9kMJJ1giaa	I would not use it.  It probably would not work and it will make a mess with the dog hair.  The dog will try to lick it off. It might be poisonous!  Vets have really good medications now for Arthritis, and they are not very expensive.  If you want to use human medication on your dog, you should check with your vet, and get the correct dose for your dog.  Some vets do use Aspirin for Arthritis in dogs.  There are other medications for joint pain you can use too, but check with your vet.|`|Lqy9Lc9Oaa	Hey, if it is for pets, then it can't hurt to try?  Although I have tried many human remeidies (topical arthritis stuff) that don't work either.  You can give your dog aspirn, but never ibuprophen also.|`|jyGTlpzTaa	Using human medications on animals can kill them. if you want arthritis medication for your dog, go to the vets!
l0ktQUnWaa	It is not the weight of the tank. It would be the footprint of it. Most tanks are long enough to fit anywhere. An example would be a refrigerator. They weigh a lot and they only rest on four legs, and the floor can hold them up. Your tanks weight is spread over an even larger area.|`|SOxdyWQOaa	yeah should be ok|`|jyGTlpzTaa	Of course, just think how much your furniture weighs!|`|MJbXxrjXaa	Definatly, i had a 46 gallon upstairs. Even a 100 gallon could probably go on any second floor
Zbn8A7Geaa	The cat doing the fighting or trying to fight must have been the dominant cat before the new one moved in (or else he wanted to be).  Even with just two cats, one will be dominant over the other. It doesn't mean they don't get along and they may even be inseparable, but one is still dominant or in the lead role.   Now he's working double time to establish his dominance over everyone.  Unless he's hurting them, I'd let it alone and let them work it out on their own.  Eventually things will calm down again though it may take more time than you expected.|`|wWE6u4peaa	i hate cats
MJbXxrjXaa	Get fish! They are fun to take care of and are a very rewarding hobby. Ok if this is your first tank, start out with a 10-20 gallon tank. If you want to add plants, get a 60 watt light fixture. If not, then get any aquarium light. Get a filter, for your tank size, but i recommend to go oversize, this will ensure clear water. Buy some gravel, wash it out with warm water until the water isnt cloudy anymore. Then pour it into your tank. Buy a small heater and put it in your tank as well. Then fill the tank with just some regular tap water. Add some dechlorinator. Then turn the heater up to about 75-78 degrees. Now you will have to let your tank cycle. This means to let it run without wish for about a month to produce the beneficial bacteria. If you want to add fish while cycling, then get some hardy tough fish. They wont die from the ammonia spike. You also might want an air pump for air circulation. Add some decor like rocks, fake or real plants, driftwood, stuff like that. If your gonna get real plants, you would have to also get a Co2 system. And while the tank is cycling, you should add some "Cycle" weekly to boost the bacteria growth, resulting in a shouter cycle time. Now once the cycle is over, you should choose to give away your hardy fish (if you had any) and get some beautiful tropical fish, or keep them. AND that my friend, is how to start an aquarium.|`|fdNo9Flbaa	I'd recommend guppies and a minibow 5 gallon or eclipse 6.<br>  No less than one gallon though because of the work it will take to<br>  keep it clean.  Don't forget to research the tank mantinan e.<br>  Guppies are a wonderful beginner fish and very hardy<br>  they are extremely colorful and interesting to watch.<br>  With a small tank though you may want to look into<br>  only getting males (most colorful) or only females (less colorful) but only get 5 of them though.<br>  Guppies are rabbits of the waterworld and the tank will be overcome very quickly.  Don't forget to let the "Nitrogen Cycle,"<br>   take it's course and do your research.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!  :D|`|SZOMVGBRaa	Things to consider, do you have the money to spend on fish. They are more expensive than most pets.  Even if you get a Little 10 gallon to keep small fish you will still drop about $70 dollars before its all done if you get all the things you need for them.  Do you have the time to take care of fish ? You need to be able ot spend at least 10-15 Min's a day to observer your fish and feed them at various points. If you work allot or have a busy life fish maybe aren't the best choice, although they are very forgiving. You also need about a half and hour twice a week to do water changes and vacuum the gravel. <br>  <br>  What kind of fish you get depends on two things, What size tank your gonna get, and the adult size of the fish you want to keep. Sure you can throw a couple 1 inch goldfish in a 10 gallon, but those one ich goldfish when taken care of will grow to 13 inch's and require a 55 gallon tank or bigger.  So if you tell me the tank size your getting I can tell you fish to get for it. <br>  <br>  As far as how to take care of them here's a few good sites for you.

Maybe about 20 gallons. It's fairly cheap (Look for used tanks) and easy to maintain.<br>  <br>  Gouramis are very hardy and pretty fish. Corydoras cats are very entertaining. I have a thing for golden wonder killies.<br>  <br>  I would say get about 4 female bettas and 2 wonderkillies in a 20 gallon tank.<br>  <br>  It would be colorful and entertaining to look at.<br>  <br>  Just go get a tank, a filter, a light, and some decor and you're ready to go.<br>  <br>  Let the tank cycle without any fish for a day or so then gradually begin adding fish in pairs.<br>  <br>  Do a biweekly 25% water change and thats all there is to it really.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped =D|`|9694ff80d3f87c041f515f142652df40aa	well fish are great pets but they are hard to take care of.<br>  I would suggest go to your local pet store petco,pet land,pet smart etc.ask them what fish are good for a beginner and other questions you have.<br>  Make a budget and buy a good tank that fits your budget fish that are nice but cheap and food and then other fish necessities like a filter a  heater and an air pump.<br>  <br>  Hope for the best, Nat Engel|`|l6zWKQnzaa	If you're starting out, I'd recommend a betta.  We've had 3 and they're pretty easy to care for.  They are also nice looking fish.  They can live in a small container without a pump - we have ours in a one gallon clear glass vase with glass rocks on the bottom.  Our bettas have lived an average of 2-3 years each, but our current one is 3+ years.  Like with any pet, there are various opinions on betta care.  For our first two, we cleaned the bowl weekly, but for our current one, we go 2-3 weeks between cleanings and let a little algae build up.  That may gross out some folks but our current betta has been far healthier than the two kept in cleaner bowls.<br>  <br>  Like any fish or pet, do not overfeed a betta!  It may seem like they're not getting enough food, but trust the food labels.  Too much food and you will have a mess.|`|1864afb7ec8de04ddd4e5d40804f200baa	I think you should learn more about keeping fish before you start. Try going to Badmanstropicalfish.com and looking around their site and then go to their forum and ask about cycling and what fish would best suit the size tank that you are planing on getting. The people there may be able to help get you started. Just make sure you let them know that you are new to fish keeping. Or you could go to tetra-fish.com, click on TetraCare, and click on "sign up now" in the section that has the picture of the lady at the top of the page. It will then walk you through the process starting with asking you if you have no aquarium, a new aquarium, or an existing aquarium.|`|v4YxLX9Daa	you need to learn alot of stuff, try going to google, and type fish care.|`|fB6Vz7gTaa	You shouldn't get goldfish, they are easy but very dirty. Make sure to ask the person who is helping you if the fish are "compatible" and don't get too many at once.<br>  I suggest you ask again the person who is helping you what kind of fish are best for your, time, type of tank, ext.<br>  Oh and don't get your fish from wal-mart!<br>  STEP 1: Realize the responsibility involved.<br>  Learning how to set up a fish tank is not all that difficult, but there are some steps you should follow. First, you must realize a few things about an aquarium setup. A tropical fish tank is just like having a dog or a cat when it comes to the amount of effort on your part. In order to have a successful freshwater tropical fish tank you will have to work at it. Once a week, or at most once every two weeks, you will need to perform some kind of maintenance on the tank. Most of the time you will be performing water changes. You will also have to feed your fish at least once a day. Setting up and running a fish tank does cost money. There are recurring expenses such as replacing filter media, buying food, etc. Check out the Freshwater vs. Saltwater Aquarium page to get an idea of the setup costs involved. If you are up to the challenge, please proceed!<br>  STEP 2: Decide on an aquarium size.<br>  It's a good idea to have in mind what kind of fish you want to keep before you purchase an aquarium. Some fish only grow to be an inch or two, whereas other types of tropical fish can grow 12 or 13 inches or more in length! Knowing what kind of fish you want will help you decide the size of the tank they will need. If this is your first time with an aquarium, it may be a good idea to start with a 10 or 20 gallon aquarium setup for now and stock it with some smaller and hardier species.<br>  <br>  STEP 3: Decide on the aquarium's location.<br>  Place your aquarium in an area where the light and temperature of the tank won't be affected by external sources such as windows and heater vents. Sunlight that enters the room through an unshaded window could affect the temperature of your tank. This could also lead to green algae problems for your tank down the road. You will want to place your aquarium on a stand that will be able to hold its total weight. You also want to be sure that the floor is able to support the total weight of the aquarium and stand. A good rule of thumb for determining the total weight of a full aquarium is 10 pounds per gallon of water. For example, a 55-gallon tank will weigh approximately 550 pounds when filled with water! <br>  <br>  STEP 4: Buy your aquarium and equipment.<br>  Now is a good time to decide on the type of aquarium filter you will want to use. You will also need to purchase a heater capable of heating the tank size you have. Buy the gravel, plants, a power strip and other decorations. A good rule of thumb for the amount of gravel that you will need is 1 to 1.5 pounds of gravel per gallon of water.<br>  <br>  STEP 5: Set up your aquarium and stand.<br>  Wash out your tank with water only! Do not use soap or detergents. Soap residue left behind will be harmful for your tropical fish. If you are going to use an under gravel filter (not recommended) now would be the time to set it up as well.<br>  <br>  STEP 6: Wash Gravel, plants and decorations.<br>  Be sure to wash the gravel thoroughly before adding it to your tank. An easy way to do this is to put some of the rocks in a pasta strainer and wash them out in your bath tub. Then place the clean gravel in a clean 5-gallon bucket for transport to the aquarium. After adding the gravel you can place your plants and decorations.<br>  <br>  STEP 7: Add water to the aquarium.<br>  To avoid messing up your gravel and plants, you can place a plate or saucer in the middle of your aquarium and direct the water flow onto the plate. Use room temperature water when filling. To remove the chlorine and chloramine, use something like Tetra AquaSafe for Aquariums. Don't completely fill up the aquarium until you are sure of the layout of your decorations. Otherwise, when you place your arm in to move stuff around water is going to spill over. Doh!<br>  <br>  STEP 8: Set up equipment.<br>  Install your heater but don't plug it in until the thermostat in the heater has adjusted to the water temperature. This usually takes about 15 minutes or so. Hook up your filter and any other equipment you have, then top off the aquarium water to just under the hood lip. Place your hood and tank light on the aquarium and then check your power cords to be sure that they are free of water. I would also recommend using a drip loop on all of the power cords to be extra cautious. For more information on safety, read this great article on aquarium electrical safety. Plug all of the equipment into a power strip and then "turn on" the aquarium.<br>  <br>  STEP 9. Wait, wait, wait and then wait some more.<br>  I know, you want to add some fish. But, in order to do this right you must wait until your aquarium has cycled before adding any fish. There are ways of speeding up this process.

(my mother hated dogs)|`|VLlyZKYYaa	Do you have money to get the dog food, toys, and vet treatment? he will need shots immediately for worms, rabbies, distemper, parvo, etc. he will need money to get neutered after you have him for a few months. all dogs have accidents, how can you make sure your dog gets potty trained quickly? Discuss these issues with your dad and think about your answers first. Also, do you have experience in training a dog? Have your talked to anyone or read any books on it? You could take him to obedience class, but that costs a lot of money...over $100 for like 6 lessons. figure out the answers to all of these things, then talk to your dad about it. not knowing how to train and handle a german shepherd can be a very dangerous move. when you get a dog, he comes family...you keep him for life. you don't get him, then find out you don't know how to train a dog and give him away. that's not right.|`|au2fea9jaa	Make him lots of tea/coffe and give him biscutes alot!

They shred and don't come apart in "chunks"  I take them away from her and throw them out when they are double swallowing size.  I also have had great success with smoked knuckle bones|`|5Aej2zebaa	First, please notice that bassets are listed as large breed dogs, so should be fed and treated accordingly.

I can't give him plush squeaky toys because he rips them to shreds, but nylabones and kongs work great for me.|`|rDLTnjRyaa	Get him some tough toys to play with. To test a toy for toughness, try bending and squeezing it. Also, get him some Kong's. The other thing you can do is go to a pet store and buy him real bones. Those will last a lot longer than the raw-hides and they'll be tastier to him. I bought mine a cow knuckle and he still has it. He has another one to chew on that hasn't even been taken out of the package yet.|`|3LAF3XCFaa	Try raw marrow bones! My dogs love them and in the summer time I give them frozen. And once the marrow is gone you can stuff it with peanut butter or cream cheese. Primal has them without antibiotics or hormones. Raw hides are not digested properly and they are bleached, iw. If you must feed rawhide get the pressed ones as they are better digested and are not bleached. Nylabones are good too but are made of all starch. I also give my dogs frozen turkey necks, they really enjoy it and because I give it frozen there is no mess.

"The bonnet face is identified by the dark color that frames a white face from the forehead, over the ears, and under the jaws, giving the appearance that a white head is fully covered with a dark, close-fitting bonnet.  Characteristics of the apron face are the dark forehead and dark ears, as in the bonnet face, but in contrast the area around one or both eyes is dark, and the dark color is "splashed" on the sides of the face and under the jaw."

R3E8DkTfaa	Contrary to the statement that there is no heater that will adequately control the temperature in a 1 gallon tank, it won't be a problem.  Any heater that  you buy is going to be thermostatically controlled and won't boil the fish.  Marineland and Tetra both make a 10 watt heater that would be just about perfect for your needs. They are however preset heaters which maintain a 78 degree Farenheit temperature.  You can't adjust them.  If you want to be able to adjust temperature there are numerous small submersibles  ranging in the 25 -50 watt category that will work just fine.   As far as your fishes problem with Fin Rot. Fin Rot is caused by a bacterial infection.  Raising the temperature in this situation can actually cause it to worsen because the bacteria will reproduce more rapidly.  Melafix is ok, but it is a botanical medication and while it will work for many bacterial infections I'm not sure if it is appropriate for fin rot.  I personally prefer something more aggressive, such as Maracyn.  If you can't find a heater locally you can find one at Drsfostersmith.com.|`|Ik6WOcw3aa	You really should have him in a larger tank. 2.5 gallons at least. He needs a filter also.    For heaters...

And no, there are no heaters that would maintain a constant temp on a 1 gallon container.  The best thing for that size is for the room temp to be around 80o F.  Otherwixe you need to upgrade to at least 2.5 gallons.  These will all have an effect on his looks, activity level, and overall health.|`|ta3wiCvtaa	You could get a hydor mini heater for the time being, but it doesn't keep the temperature steady which is what you really need, especially if he's already sick. Upgrade to a 2.5 gallon and get a 25 watt Visi-Therm Stealth heater. You can get the Stealth heater cheaper at bigalsonline.com. You can pick up a simple 2.5 gallon tank at Petsmart for around $12.   For your fish to heal he needs warm water with a steady temperature, otherwise the fin rot could very easily kill him. Even anything under 72 for too long will kill him if he's healthy. Get your fish a bigger tank with a programmable heater.|`|OsVswissaa	I can't think of any heater that would go in one gallon.    Melafix and aquarium salt are useless for fin rot.

JsBb732Maa	If he's a dog with a lot of hair/coat he should be fine. You could get some wheat straw and really stuff it in the shed to help keep him warm.Or extra blankets, but when he goes out his feet will get wet and so will the blankets so they will need to be changed to keep dry ones for him. Good luck.|`|h2HtZ9NMaa	He should be fine as long as he has a thick coat and you keep checking on him|`|Vhq3GURQaa	Insulate the shed.even more. Put newspapers down on the floor. Then even a blanket. Make sure that the water for drinking doesn't freeze. Dogs need water not ice.|`|PIuCdeC4aa	Well, it depends what breed of dog it is.  I'm assuming it's a fairly hearty breed since it lives outside in the first place.      Overall, dogs have very strong senses of survival, and your dog should be fine.  Checking on it every now and again certainly wouldn't hurt, though.|`|OxFsslN8aa	Call your vet and ask what he/she thinks.  You didn't tell us what kind of dog you have so knowing whether it will be OK can't really be answered.  The temps have to be below 32 degrees which is cold & you don't want his feet or any part of him to get frostbite.  Follow the vets advice.|`|giCUEYsJaa	If your shed has knot holes or isn't built tight, the snow can accumulate inside and bury your dog and he will die.  I'm not sure if keeping the door ajar is a good idea either.    Hopefully, the dog has a thick furry coat, and his instincts will kick in and he'll find a safe shelter, perhaps on your porch doorway?    The reason he's very hyper when let in, is because he hasn't been trained.  Ask your mom if you bathe him and keep him in your bedroom, if she would reconsider?  And while he's being kept in your bedroom, this would be a good time for you to train him to sit.      1:  Calm him down - you may have to lay on the floor until he does.     2.  Once he's calm - have him get up on all four legs in front or on side of you and put a choke collar and leash on him.  He will probably get excited again - lay down again and ignore him this time until he calms down.     3.  Once he's calmed down, place him on your left side.  Do this by gently pulling on the leash at the same time using your right hand on his back to guide him to your left side.     4.  Once on he's near your left side, put the leash in your right hand and give the command SIT, while pulling UP (not away or out) on the leash/collar and gently pushing down on his rump with your left hand.    Repeat - and he will get it!    And after the snow stops, you can practice this outside!      Best of Luck to you all!|`|b90e42d25bd45025e46d388ab0c06d12aa	Should be good, just give him some extra blankets for the night.|`|AA11331047	Blankets can hold moisture and freeze when it is cold. Get a crate to put in the shed and then put the blanket in the crate so that it is off the ground.

wz9szz3Gaa	First Stage - Proestrus: begins with the appearance of vaginal bleeding, swelling of the vulva, and possible increase in urination (yes, females do mark their territory, especially when they are in heat).   The most noticeable thing of all when you have a female GSD in heat, even if you're not sure your female GSD is in heat, is when male dogs begin to hang around the house. Your female GSD will still reject the male during this stage. Fertilization can not happen at this time. The length of proestrus on average is about 9 days.     Second Stage - Estrus: the time in which the female dog will allow the male to breed her. This time is also called "standing heat" and can last anywhere from 4 to 21 days depending on the individual Dog.     One particular behavior to look for during this time is called "flagging", which may last between 4 to 7 days. Your female might lift her tail and/or rub her rear end against various objects, such as a wall or fencing. This is just one indicator that is very telling that your female is getting ready to be bred. Ovulation does occur during this flagging stage.     Concerning any female GSD in heat, the dark red vaginal discharge will eventually turn to a lighter shade of red over time. In most dogs, once this vaginal discharge becomes wheat or straw colored, the dog can be said to be most ready for accepting the male and breeding.     Third Stage - Metestrus: this is the stage that readies the uterus for pregnancy, and can easily last 4 to 14 days. False pregnancies frequently occur during this time. If fertilization does occur the fertilized eggs may take up to a week before they attach themselves to the uterine wall.     Overall this stage averages out as approximately 7 days. Keep in mind that this interval of time will stay the same even if the dog becomes pregnant. If fertilization does not occur then this stage will revert back to anestrus, which is stage four of this process.    Fourth Stage - Anestrus: the resting time between heats which normally lasts about 5 or 6 months.     If you decide that you need to know exactly what stage of estrus you female GSD may be in, your veterinarian can easily assist you in figuring this out. Scientifically your veterinarian can perform an analysis of the cells of the vagina under the microscope (cytology), as well as being able to measure progesterone levels present in your dogs bloodstream.|`|9ea79964f4ddad1359a8089c6729bb4caa	That's normal.

T1kRNoxCaa	yeah just buty some Kopertox thrush remedy or any OTC remedy, in a pinch we used to use bleach.  Thrush is a fungal thing. caused my excess moisture.|`|1BJtTl8Baa	I clean the hooves then rinse them with iodine or bleach in a syringe so you can get the sides of the frog. then after dry, coat with koppertox or thrush remedy as directed.its best if you can keep your horse in the dry several days, but if not you need to do this more often.I try, when my field horses come in to eat, I clean their feet( when its wet and nasty out) and  spray with plain Lysol disinfect, I think it helps prevent future problem. You still need to use a hoof treatment for moisture when you can. If you ever get an abscessed hoof get a product called "icthomal" its a black drawing salve, pack the hooves with it, put a bandage/ gauze over bottom of hoof and make you a "vetwrap" and or duct tape boot/bandage, but be careful not to wrap too tight past the top of the hoof ( circulation). an  "easyboot" is the best hoof covering. there expensive, but nice to have on hand.If this problem persists you may need antibiotics, If your not familiar with antibiotic use, call your vet. Good luck! Thanks for caring for our 4 legged friends!|`|IMPvzBk1aa	First of all, I don't think your horse has thrush.  It doesn't smell like manure.  The best prevention for thrush is exercise and regular trimming by a competent farrier or barefoot trimmer (best).  Picking out the hooves daily is also preventative.  It is not necessary to put any chemicals on the hoof when there is no thrush, and isn't even a good idea.  Many horses kept in pristeen conditions still get thrush, and others that stand in manure for hours don't get it. If you take the time to read this article, it will give you accurate and up to date information on thrush.       http://www.thehorse.com/ViewArticle.aspx...    This one is about a new product that is not harmful to healthy tissue as many products are, such as iodine or bleach, and yet is effective against thrush bacteria.    http://www.thehorse.com/ViewArticle.aspx...    This product is safe to use as a preventive even when thrush is not present, since it does no damage to healthy tissues like harsh chemical products do.  Click on the link provided in the article for more information on the product.|`|gbd4PMwfaa	When my horse had thrush there was a white chalky like stuff in her hoof. It crumbled easily and was soft. I used the thrush treatment that I had from Farm and Fleet and it cleared up anywhere from one to two weeks after we first noticed it. Thrush comes from standing in damp and muddy areas so it is preventable.|`|RoPLmd2daa	Kopertox is a good idea- but only apply it once every few days. If you put it on too often, it will eat away at the hooves, as it is caustic. Don't get any on your skin, as it is carcinogenic.  If you can, keep her stalled (or on dry ground) until it clears up.  Thrush is easily preventable by picking and checking hooves twice a day.|`|4KY26xQqaa	Anti-bascterical spray works for me(well not me!).... and the horses!

My akita is mostly white and stays very clean, but his hair is weather resistent and not soft like a the hair on a maltese. <br>  <br>  "If i get a yorkie-poo will the black hair stay black?" not necessisarily, no. there is no way to know what color a mutt will be; even in some purebred dogs it can be very difficult to accurately predict coat color/pattern.

There are literally thousands to choose from, so why not save a life?|`|NbdZoxxQaa	yeah I had a maltese and the tear stains were horrible, eventually we gave up trying to keep his white fur that clean. <br>  I do not know about the yorkie-poo, it depends on the genes. <br>  If you are set on having a white colored dog you can try what they are doing in Asia right now.

My mom has a pure white Siberian Husky and he rolls in the mud - no joke - after about 30 mins he is all clean again - on his own.  That breed has certain oils in their coat that actually maintain a white coat.  You are not supposed to wash them often because it will destroy the natural oils.  They are a self cleaning dog.

WLNX00c3aa	Natural Balance is a great brand.     what you'll have to do is jst leave the food out there.  do not feed her any treats and exercise her more than usual.  It's jst like humans. the more calories you burn the more fuel your body will look for.  so thus, if you get the dog to do more exercise, then it'll start to eat more.    do not worry if she snubs her nose to the food.  she will not starve. she knows where the source of food is at.      if you dont like to do the free feed, when you have breakfast place her bowl down...when you are done, pick it up and then jst leave her water for the day till you have dinner.    our dog was like that and i got worried he wasnt enjoying his kibble, but soon after doing this trick, he started to eat.  he eats late in the evening when we are all winding down for the evening.    Jst saw your edit:  that's about the same time our dog did that not eating thing. she's busy curious about everything.  it's like a child of 2...where everything is no and only certain foods it'll eat.|`|Vhq3GURQaa	If it is an older dog, it may be hurting her to chew. Add the water. No harm there.|`|JsBb732Maa	Tough love, offer the food twice a day and what she doesn't eat in 20-30 minutes take it up until the next feeding. Don't let her train you on how to feed her, that's your job. A healthy dog will not starve itself to death. Let her get hungry then she'll eat.If you have to put a little water that's no big deal but don't if you don't want to. http://www.dogfoodanalysis.com/dog_food_...   Look for a food that doesn't have a lot of fillers, corn etc. The first three ingredients are crucial, read the ingredient list on all dog foods to make a better choice.|`|PUUXbVK2aa	is there a problem with just putting a bit of water in it?    maybe it hurts her mouth.|`|vPde97E2aa	STOP catering to a dumb animal!  it will NOT starve!

She has been on dry food for the past 12 months and now is deciding that she won't eat it . She would much rather eat what we are eating if she could and wants her usual treats so I know there is nothing wrong with her and she has had a check up at the vets as I did think she may have had a problem with her teeth or stomach. The only thing I can advise you , which is what I am doing at the minute , which is to stop any treats and any other tidbits and when she is hungry enough she will eat it. That is what my vet told me to do . She will nibble at it but tries to make us feel guilty when we are eating . My daughter has even tried to feed her by hand to encourage her to eat .|`|U1RcZjqJaa	She is probably just used to being spoiled. If you really don't want to have to add anything to her food, just put dry food down and leave it there until she eats. Eventually she will get hungry and give in. If you don't mind adding the water then keep doing it she is probably just picky now that she knows what food could taste like!|`|Ee2fwrqoaa	IAMS is crap.

Put her food down for 15 minutes and then take it away until the next scheduled feeding when you put it down again for 15 minutes.  Adding water (especially warm water) arouses your dogs sense of smell which is how dogs find food.  I agree that if it isn't hard on you to add water then do that; it doesn't cost anything and it makes her eat which makes you happy.|`|6r66qqnxaa	There are plenty of other very good dry foods that you can try. Most will gladly send you a sample or coupon or something. But I really don't understand why it's a big deal to put water on the food? I cook for my dogs every day and I have 11.   Are you feeding her too much? Is she getting to many treats?|`|bDsIgFoXaa	Put some people food in it. or try some canned dog food mixed in. also try a new kind of food. she might just not like this kind.|`|Z8iZWym9aa	Some dogs really don't like to eat dry food because it's not appealing to them at all. Try warming it up and putting the water in it (it's fine as long as she has a chew toy to clean her teeth later). Warm food smells much more appetizing to dogs than plain old dry food.

oDVx7nSxaa	The more protein the better for cats, as that's what Nature intended for them to eat. Cats really have very little use for grains - in the wild the only grains they would eat would be the contents of their prey's stomach.  All those nice looking veggies are meant to make the food more appealing to us, not really for their benefit.  For my money, I'd go with Wellness as it has more meat protein per dollar than the Halo does.  Aside from that they are both fine foods.  I feed mostly canned, however, and my cats won't touch the Halo canned.  Their favorite (and the main food at my house) is the Wellness chicken. Yours however, may like the Halo canned very much.|`|VDP3pNCPaa	Actually, it is all up to your cat.  Both seem to be foods that are aimed at the "all natural" buyers, and are likely a premium food.  I looked at a couple of ingredient lists, and both seem fine.  Can't say I see any sense in having vegetables and berries, as those are more appropriate for dog foods.  But they are not the top ingredients.<br>  <br>  The thing is, your cat is the ultimate decider. No matter how great you may think the food is, if your cat won't eat it, it won't matter.  A cat will starve themselves rather than eat a food they don't like.<br>  <br>  Any food switch needs to be done gradually, over perhaps a week time to avoid tummy upsets.<br>  <br>  Protein can be an issue in older cats whose kidneys may not be functioning at 100%.|`|kpXRhoTvaa	Halo is my favorite, you get to play as master chief. Master Chief, originally named John, was born in 2511 and first lived with his family on the human colony planet Eridanus II. Large for his six years of age, and approximately a foot above his school peers, he is described as a typical boy with brown hair, freckles and a gap between his two front teeth. In 2517, John and seventy-four other children his age are covertly taken from their homes and replaced with flash clones to hide the kidnapping. The original children are brought to planet Reach, one of the UNSC's headquarters, to begin intense physical and psychological training to become SPARTAN-II supersoldiers. They are assigned new identification numbers instead of last names; John becomes known as John-117. Approximately eight years later, John and the other children are biologically and cybernetically augmented and enhanced. These procedures had substantial risks; only John and thirty-two other Spartans survive.<br>  <br>  After the Spartans' first successful operation which involved capturing a rogue UNSC officer, John-117 is briefed on the threat posed by the Covenant, a theocratic alliance of alien races, and witnesses the utter devastation wrought by a single ship. The Spartans are first sent to the Damascus Materials Testing Facility on the planet Chi Ceti 4 to retrieve the MJOLNIR Mark IV armor. In the process, they board a Covenant vessel and plant a bomb; John is forced to leave one of his fellow Spartans, his best friend, to die.<br>  <br>  In 2552, the Covenant invades the human world of Sigma Octanus and occupies one of its cities, Cote D'Azure. Following a failed Marine assault, John-117 and three teams of Spartans are sent to destroy the Covenant force with a nuclear warhead. After detonating the weapon, the Spartans return to Reach, where the UNSC High Command has developed a last-ditch plan to capture a Covenant High Prophet, who they hope could be used in order to barter a truce. The Master Chief's armor is upgraded, and he first encounters the artificial intelligence (AI) Cortana during a training mission. A massive Covenant armada of 314 ships arrives and begins to destroy the planet, despite the best efforts of the Spartans and other UNSC forces. Aboard the spaceship Pillar of Autumn, Cortana plots a random course of escape. Seemingly the last Spartan alive, the Master Chief enters cryonic sleep along with the Pillar of Autumn's crew. SO duh!!! Halo is better cause master cheif is in it!!!!!111|`|aP4bkYOCaa	I prefer the Wellness foods for my cats (I feed Wellness CORE myself) because they contain more protein from animal sources. Halo contains a lot more veggies and other stuff I find to be a tad unnecessary. <br>  <br>  Here is the Wellness Salmon formula, for example:<br>  <br>  Salmon, Salmon Meal, Whitefish Meal, Rice, Ground Barley, Ground Rice, Chicken Fat (preserved with Mixed Tocopherols, a natural source of Vitamin E), Deboned Turkey, NatUral Chicken Flavor, NatUral Fish Flavor, Cranberries, Olive Oil, Chicory Root Extract, Cranberry Extract Powder, Cranberry Fiber, Flaxseed, Potassium Chloride, Vitamins (Vitamin E Supplement, Niacin, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Thiamine Mononitrate, Calcium Pantothenate, Riboflavin, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride, Beta-Carotene, Vitamin A Supplement, Vitamin D-3 Supplement, Folic Acid, Biotin, Vitamin B-12 Supplement), Choline Chloride, Minerals (Zinc Proteinate, Zinc Sulfate, Iron Proteinate, Ferrous Sulfate, Copper Sulfate, Copper Proteinate, Manganese Proteinate, Manganese Sulfate, Calcium Iodate, Sodium Selenite), Yucca Schidigera Extract, Dried Kelp, Glucosamine Hydrochloride, Chondroitin Sulfate, Lactobacillus Plantarum, Enterococcus Faecium, lactobacillus Casei, lactobacillus Acidophilus, Taurine, Rosemary Extract.<br>  <br>  And the Halo Salmon Formula:<br>  <br>  Salmon, Pea Protein, Whole Dried Eggs, Oats, Vegetable Broth, Chicken Fat (preserved with mixed tocopherols and citric acid), Pea Flour, Chicken Liver, Chicken, Flaxseed, Salmon Oil (preserved with mixed tocopherols), Pea Fiber, Sweet Potatoes, Apples, Blueberries, Green Beans, Carrots, Cranberries, Zucchini, Alfalfa, Inulin, Calcium Sulfate, Potassium Chloride, Taurine, Salt, Folic Acid, Zinc Proteinate, Iron Proteinate, Cobalt Proteinate, Copper Proteinate, Manganese Proteinate, Vitamin A Supplement, Vitamin D3 Supplement, Vitamin E Supplement, Choline Bitartrate, Niacin, Pantothenic Acid, Ascorbic Acid, Riboflavin Supplement, Thiamine Mononitrate, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride, Biotin, Lactobacillus Acidophilus, Bifidobacterium Longum, Enterococcous Faecium, Lactobacillus Plantarum, Calcium Iodate, Sodium Selenite.<br>  <br>  See what I mean? Definitely more protein sources in the Wellness formula. Cats need protein from animal sources because they're carnivores. <br>  <br>  But don't get me wrong! Both are fine brands. It's all a matter of what your cat likes, where you can purchase the food and what you can afford. :)<br>  <br>  Best of luck. :)

These are breeds that thrive on your company but don't need a 5 mile walk every day.  They will do fine in colder weather - if you're worried, throw a sweater on them.<br>  <br>  And of course, always consider adopting, b/c you're saving a life, providing room for more lost souls, and your dog knows when he gets a second chance!|`|0HAn67yZaa	here are some great choices.<br>  <br>  a pekingese.<br>  <a href="http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/pekingese.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/pekingese.ht...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  pomeranian.<br>  <a href="http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/pomeranian.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/pomeranian.h...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  pug.<br>  <a href="http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/pug.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/pug.htm</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  papillon.<br>  <a href="http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/papillon.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/papillon.htm</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  bichon frise.<br>  <a href="http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/bichonfrise.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/bichonfrise....</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  dachshund.<br>  <a href="http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/dachshund.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/dachshund.ht...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  american eskimo dog.<br>  <a href="http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/americaneskimo.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/americaneski...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  shih tzu.<br>  <a href="http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/shihtzu.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/shihtzu.htm</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  toy poodle.<br>  <a href="http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/toypoodle.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/toypoodle.ht...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  good luck :)<br>  <br>  hope i helped.|`|enC9TvxUaa	-Poodle, shitz-su, lapso-apso.

fWf3A3Ioaa	A cardboard incubator will not work regardless of what type of thermometer you use.      Cardboard does not exactly trap heat (and CERTAINLY not humidity, which is crucial for hatching success) well - which is why you only see homeless people using it as construction material.    You'd be better of using a styrofoam cooler if you're going for the home-made approach.|`|5f6fbccb8643408cbd62a8431b3e5c44aa	No please use the proper equipment for the optimal health of the chicks you are going to hatch.|`|FvAl3UgQaa	I'd really advise against doing this (the cardboard box thing, not so much the use of a glass thermometer). It's heartbreaking to get eggs to the stage where you can hear peeping and some manage to pip the shell, and then fail to hatch because of incorrect incubation temperatures or lack of humidity (causes them to stick to the shells)... Seriously - I've been there on my first attempt at incubation and I wouldn't wish anyone else (or any other chicks) to experience it.     I use a Hovabator now, for chicks, as it can support an automatic egg-turner, but have a look at my answer about building a home-made reptile incubator that works really well:     http://answers.yahoo.com/question/;_ylc=...    The one thing you would need to do differently is to not have the eggs sitting in tubs of damp vermiculite - they should be on a very thin-gauge wire mesh - and tubs containing water-soaked sponges should be used to maintain the correct humidity.|`|2rXWZkbnaa	For best results I would use the proper chicken equipment because that one mistake could mean your chickens death. If your chicks are to cold or hot they will die. You know when they are cold because they will be huddled together and if they are too hot they will be up against the walls of the brooder. For the chicks safety use the right equipment, in the end you will be happy that you spent that little time and money on a chick thermometer.|`|lMSAyTm6aa	how about using a lightbulb as a source of heat..or a hot water bottle wrapped in towel? I saw at our pet store they use a heat bulb shining down to keep the chicks warm. Or a heating pad with a towel over it? You can get those at the drug store, but you definitely need some humidity so the egg won't dry out.|`|YhH0PNupaa	You should not use cardboard b/c it is a fire hazard  http://www.backyardchickens.com/forum/vi...  Have a look around there and do a search for homemade incubator and you will find dozens of ways to make one. You don't have to have an expensive incubator to hatch eggs. There are lots of things you can use. A fish tank thermometer wouldn't work b/c it is not precise enough, and you need pretty precise temps to hatch eggs.  The backyard chickens site is an awesome place to get all kinds of into on hatching and raising chickens. Good luck with your hatch.
y7H1V39Jaa	You are old enough legally to choose which parent you want to live with.  Is the horse really yours?  If so, can you not make some arrangements to move him either to where your Mother lives or a close boarding stable?  You do know, don't you that if you are living full time with your Mother, your father will be forced to pay child support to your mother, whereas now, they have been sharing your keep.  You might bring this subject up with your mother, and you can both have your cake and eat it too.  Good luck and don't give up..|`|pR4JVtSJaa	It sounds like you need to have a talk with both parents (you can do it one at a time!) about the horse.  Look around the area and try to find 3 or 4 places you would be willing to keep the horse.  Ask at the local feed or tack shop if you can't find anything else.  Talk to your mom about what you can truly afford.  See if the barns are willing to let you work to help pay for the board.  You must also talk to your dad to be sure the horse is legally yours, that he won't fight you taking it somewhere else.  He may be counting on keeping the horse as a way to be sure you will come visit him.|`|QGecNxmgaa	If your mom lives in the country and has the space get your horse away from your dad and get it to your mom's house. if not, then look for a inexpensive boarding stable close enough where you can get to him/her.|`|7b6fsMFdaa	What about your grandparents maybe they can keep him for you if they live on a farm, or you could try a boarding stable. Some stable's don't cost a lot like others. Good lucky with ever thing!|`|YOvTRbC7aa	Why did your dad put your horse down? There had to be a good reason. He probably did it without your knowing to protect you.   If your parents, live close enough to each other maybe you can still keep the horse with your dad and visit him a few days a week. Since your parents just divorced, your mother is probably struggling with her financial security and I think it would be unreasonable to expect her to pick up boarding costs if you can keep the horse for free at your fathers. Otherwise, you might want to talk to local boarding facilities about working off board, i.e. mucking, feeding, turnout horses, etc.|`|0kh2HEFMaa	Finding a nice, inexpensive stable to board your horse would be the best. Just in case you dont have time to go there every day, the stable would take care of feeding and other things. Ideally it would be great if you could bring the horse to your moms. Good luck!
XrPwrWPcaa	They just need a while to get used to their surroundings and to you, that's all. All birds do this, so there is nothing to be afraid of. Just make sure that they are healthy and are eating like they should. If you are too anxious, you can take them to a vet. They will give you lots of advice on what you should do.|`|JtTpfCMHaa	Actually this is normal it may take as much as two weeks for a pet shop bird to get active. They will likely not trust you anytime soon though and had you done research you would know this<br>   They will bond with one another and leave you out.<br>   <br>  It is also a good idea and a responsible owner will do so take any new pet bird lizard whatever should be taken to the Vets to be checked out and made sure it is healthy and in good shape if done in the first couple days this makes it possible if anything IS wrong they will take it back and in many cases pay the vet bill<br>  <br>  <br>  In al;l honesty I would never buy a pet shop bird because they just have anyone selling then that knows little about them. The birds also usually come from breeder mills where he birds are all used JUST for breeding that is all they do all their lives Who wants to support that??|`|vjijiJT3aa	give them some time, keep their environment as comfortable as possible and help them feel safe, its normal, they'll be ok.|`|Gr6Xe1gGaa	This is normal behavior for a new bird in a new home. Try talk to them softly to calm them down and so that they know you are a nice person. Encourage them to eat and drink and to get on their perches.

l0ktQUnWaa	Uromastyx are very active lizards. If he seems to be hurting himself, you can cover the glass with background, paper, whatever. You do not say what size of tank he is in. If he is young, a 36"x18x16 tank is fine. As he gets older, you will need to go up in size. I am surprised he doesn't like to be held. Let him get used to you and try to handle him for a few minutes a day and go from there.<br>  Good luck!
QhdRbsEvaa	I always wondered that myself how do you figure out the size cage you need.  There is a quick method to determine the MINIMUM size cage you need.  An Amazon parrot is about 15 inches when fully grown.  Take the 15 inches and increase it by 1.6 times, which comes out to 24.  So the minimum size cage to purchase would be a 24 inch cage.  However, it would probably be better if you went to a 36 inch cage.  It never hurts to have a cage bigger.|`|2Ku4DuvCaa	The rule of thumb is that bigger is always better. Amazons tend to vary in size a little depending on subspecies, so instead of naming off numbers, I'll give you something to compare it by.<br>  <br>  At a MINIMUM, a cage for a bird should be the size of your bird on all sides if he was standing next to himself with his wings wide open. So, wingspan x2 on all sides. That's at the very smallest. Again, bigger is always better. <br>  <br>  Bar spacing should not exceed 5/8 of an inch.|`|cfblRvE3aa	bigger is better always but it depends on time kept in cage if it spends most of its time out than smaller is fine.Amazons average 12 inches so minimally 36 inches height 24 inches deep and 24 wide this is just ok.but if you want a bigger cage go to queencitypets.com they have large cages for half normal price and free shipping. hope i helped|`|Nb0SBUK6aa	The cage should be big enough to allow the bird to wide-spread the wings without touching the cage.  That will be the minimum size of the cage.|`|ZPYZQxjkaa	As wide as his wing span but I'd get him as large as possible so he can move around a lot. Don't forget you'll have lots of big toys, ropes and stuff like that in there too.
Zbn8A7Geaa	Sounds like it may be ich/ick.  There is a medicine for it you can get at any pet store. You treat the whole tank. It won't hurt the fish that doesn't have it, but it will cure the beta and keep the catfish from getting it.  Ick spreads rapidly so you want to start treatment right away.|`|D5wZLk6faa	Please do not put epsom salt in your fish tank. The only salt you should ever put in your fish tank is aquarium salt that is easily purchased at any pet store.<br>  <br>  Then you can follow the directions of the person above me with treating your betta for ick or take him to the pet store just to be sure the diagnosis is correct.|`|fdNo9Flbaa	Did you even check the water conditions?  The water may be toxic at the moment especially if you NEVER changed the water!  This can cause a host of fungus and diseases.  Please do a 10% water change add one tablespoon of Epsom salts (diluted in water with water conditioner).  Test the condition of your tanks water, even though it may be crystal clear it can have other harmful toxin levels like high ammonia and nitrite/nitrate levels and do this everyday for a week and then if it isn't better put him in a jar and take him to the pet store or marine vet for analysis.|`|cL1K7NHZaa	Put it in a jar and take it to your local pet store.  They should be able to identify it and let you know how to treat it..|`|fB6Vz7gTaa	This is a common parasite which most aquarists eventually encounter. Even if you follow quarantine procedures you may at some point acquire an infected fish, which should be treated before being introduced into your main aquarium. The good news is that if handled correctly, this disease can be easily and permanently eliminated.<br>  <br>  It is:<br>  The scientific name for this nuisance is Ichthyophthirius multifiliis, or “ich/ick” for short. It is the largest known ciliated protozoan found on fishes. It appears on the body and fins as tiny white dots resembling grains of salt; hence the other nickname, “white spot disease.” These white spots may join together to form white patches. Other signs of infestation can include excessive flashing (rubbing against the substrate or decorations), labored breathing, clamped fins, loss of appetite, lethargic and/or reclusive behavior, and hovering near filter returns. Keep in mind, however, that all of these symptoms are common with fish in distress and do not point directly to Ich. As a matter of fact, flashing often occurs after routine water changes due simply to a fluctuation in general hardness.<br>  <br>  Ich has three life stages, which are important to understand for proper diagnosis and treatment. <br>  <br>  <br>  When the parasite is visible to the naked eye, it is a nearly fully developed trophont which has burrowed under the fish’s mucus coating where it is protected from chemicals (medication). It has likely been feeding on the body fluid of the fish for several days and has swelled to many times its original size. At common aquarium temperatures of 75 to 80oF this feeding stage lasts only a few days, at which point the fully developed cyst drops off the fish as a tomont.<br>  <br>  <br>  The tomont may swim for several hours before settling on and attaching to the substrate, a plant, or some other surface. During that time it is susceptible to chemicals and medication will be effective. Once attached, it begins its reproductive stage. It encysts and begins rapidly dividing. At this point, it is again immune to chemicals. Within a few days, hundreds of new organisms burst from the cyst, sprout cilia and start swimming in search of a host.<br>  <br>  <br>  These are now referred to as thermonts or swarmers, and they must find a host within a few days or they will die. (For this reason, we know that even an aquarium heavily infested with Ich would be “clean” and safe for new fish after only a week or two without fish in the tank.) Medication is effective at this stage. Once the thermont attaches to a host and burrows in, it is referred to as a trophont and the cycle begins again. Unfortunately, with each cycle the number of organisms in the tank increases dramatically.<br>  <br>  Left untreated, Ich is almost certainly fatal. Infected fish are weakened by the ever growing number of parasites feeding on them. Secondary bacteria and fungi attack more easily. Trophonts on the gills eventually restrict oxygen flow and respiration is hindered. The ailing fish will ultimately succumb either to the infestation itself or a secondary condition. <br>  <br>  How Do I Prevent It?:<br>  <br>  I came into the research phase of this article with certain misconceptions about this parasite. It is a commonly held belief that the Ichthyophthirius organism is always present in your aquarium and needs only the right opportunity, such as stress resulting in a weakened immune function, to attack your fish. Surprisingly, I found no scientific data to support that claim. Credible sources state that there is no long-term dormant stage this parasite can exist in. While its lifecycle is longer at low temperatures (like that of an outdoor pond in a cooler climate), at average home aquarium temperatures this parasite would likely complete a lifecycle in less than a week. Considering that a single organism produces hundreds (if not thousands) of offspring, the logical question is “where would they all go?” Dr. Peter Burgess, writing for Practical Fishkeeping magazine (who also co-authored the book entitled A to Z of Tropical Fish Diseases and Health Problems), refers to the dormant concept as “rubbish.”<br>  <br>  The proliferation of this myth could be due to the fact that it is possible for a strong, healthy fish to resist severe infestations, especially if it was infected previously and developed some resistance. While the organisms attach easily to the gills of most fish (where they cannot be seen), the body may be sufficiently protected by a tougher mucus coating. Such a fish could serve as an asymptomatic carrier; potentially hosting many lifecycles without showing any visible signs. When introduced to a new tank it brings the parasite with it. Scaleless fish such as loaches and catfish often show symptoms first, but most likely every fish in the tank will eventually be infected; if not visibly on the body, on the gills at the very least. <br>  <br>  It stands to reason that a stressed fish with a weakened immune function is an easy host, but only if the parasite is present
DtkLsetkaa	Its not even a matter of the cat being smart enough not to jump, its the fact that accidents happen, and if your cat is sitting up there and a loud noise scares it or it just slips, it could fall accidentally and die from the impact.  Or even worse, break so many bones that its in pain for hours until someone finds it and it has to be put down anyway.  I would not take the risk.  If its possible to enclose the porch, such that the cat absolutely CANNOT get through the netting/screening, then that should be ok.  But don't let that poor cat out there where its in danger of being seriously hurt.|`|5f477cf9f429c86fcdfa05dc5d148aa0aa	get her use to a harness and leash inside first and then sit with her out there holding the leash with enough slack that she can walk around but not go anything more than 6 inches from the edge.

My cat got out by mistake one day and within a blink of an eye saw a pigeon and leaped for it. I hate to say this but she actually caught it between her teeth but only just missing going over top of the balcony railing. She had just been on the inside of it when she jumped. She was at least 7 inches above the rail. Cats are smart but they are also unpredictable at any age. And all cats can jump a good height so don't even think about letting the cat out there! If you believe the cat is wanting to look out the window then get her a cat condo tree that she can see outside with but yet be safe inside.|`|SsBTd8WDaa	I wouldn't suggest it unless you secure the ledge with a baby gate or something. <br>  <br>  My kitten fell over twelve feet off the banister when I left her alone for just a few seconds. She didn't get hurt, but she got horribly scared and couldn't get up for twenty minutes. <br>  <br>  Cats are resistant to falls, but off the 6th floor? There's a good chance she wouldn't survive it (and you bet she's going to want to jump off).|`|jy9Jn0Xoaa	Since you are 6 floors up I would not do it even if she is supervised. Anything could happen. You know how fast cats are and what type of reflexes they have. If she would see something or if something would scare or startle her she might just go over and that would be very distressing to watch her fall to her death. They say cats are more likely to survive a longer fall than a shorter fall (1 - 2 stories) due to the fact that it gives them a better chance to relax while falling but this is not something I would want to find out with my cat.|`|GgMMvHI8aa	I saw my sisters cat jump from a 2nd story window. Nearly killed himself.  <br>   <br>  I would suggest using a cat crate if you leave him out for long periods. Because cats are curios, what if he tries to chase a bird?????? <br>    <br>  You can also purchase a cat harness, and leash.|`|P3LwYllFaa	i wouldnt take the risk<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=20090219162414AAnA6Ww&cp=6">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=2...</a><br>  <br>  please answer!|`|18AOjbgYaa	I wouldn't let her go out .

H1tokn4uaa	This is a fun case to work with and I'll be honest, you may not be able to make your dog bark on command.  Juts like with a child, yelling at him will yield immediate results, but you run the risk of damaging the child socially and emotionally.  This is what happened with your little doggy.  You told him not to bark and now he doesn't want to bark around you unless he feels like he may be in danger.  If he feels threatened by a sound outside he will bark and bark and not even care about treats or praise.  <br>  <br>  Here's what you can try.  Get a clicker from a local pet store and give him a treat every time he hears the  click.  Do this for three or four days until he knows exactly what the click means.  Then have a friend go to the door.  Watch you dog because timing is everything if you want your dog to bark.  You need to reward him before he even barks.  Once he hears the friend coming to the front door and his ears start to perk, click and give him a treat.  Do this for about two days.  Then every time the don't reward him until he starts to stand.  Click and give him a treat once he stands.  Do this for a couple days and then don't reward him until he gives one bark.<br>  <br>    If you do this tedious process your should be able to get him comfortable with barking in front of you and hopefully he will nejoy barking around you again.|`|X1tawExBaa	bark at him & give him a treat each time he barks back. If that doesn't work then get him excited.For example, my 11year old German shepherd starts barking when we're about to take him on a walk. hold a leash to excite him.After he's learned the trick take him for awalk as a bigger reward|`|4KTmiQ0paa	If he was kept in a kennel, isolating him probably won't make him bark as that is what he was accustomed to. I would be careful when trying to get him to bark because it may lead to an unpleasant habit.|`|RxQSSUNraa	Here is how I trained a 15 week old Staffy to "speak" on command.<br>  This is the first exercise I trained her to do.<br>  <br>  Find your dog's "tickle spot". ( That certain spot that causes a genuine excited bark when you tickle or pet it. My Staffy has a spot right under her jaw in center with a whisker. I tickle this in an upbeat (excited tone) to induce her happy bark.<br>  Once you do this, tie another desired command with tickle/ pet/ praise routine so your pet associates your new bark command with the experience as fun to do.<br>  I have taught my dog a dozen of verifiable responses to command to speak:<br>  She can "say", out, feet, drink, beach,tiki hut, and other various locations she may wish to walk to.<br>  Her all time favorite thing to say so far is " Biscuit", she also does a mean mountain lion impersonation.<br>  Good luck|`|m7TZKc58aa	Some types of animals cannot bark. Such as a Cocker Spaniel has a smaller vocal cord than many other dogs. So this is what may be causing him not to bark and some dogs CANNOT bark at all. Or your dog may be sick. Sometimes there can be a sist on it's throat.|`|yY3WwAJQaa	you didn't say how old the dog is-if it's an older dgg set in his ways it will be harder.i've had many different kinds of dogs some are more prone to speaking than otheres -puppies often grow into it when there ready,this is one command that wasn't easy for me either|`|I2iNfYCyaa	make howling noises..lol.
9GMePSopaa	I use both ;)<br>  <br>  If you're getting a baby leo, it's best to be keeping it on a solid substrate as they're more likely to be clumsy and intrigued by sand.<br>  <br>  If you're getting an adult or when your baby matures, sand should be fine!<br>  <br>  You'll get loads of people telling you how leopard gecko's can become impacted through ingestion of sand - but my boy's been fine on the stuff for 8 years! :)<br>  I use Exo Terra Desert Sand (Black) and natural slate tile. It looks brilliant together, and he seems fine on it :D|`|TkJn9gO0aa	Hey buddy!<br>  <br>  Here, let me help you out since I know you obviously want to use sand.<br>  <br>  Here is a guide that I wrote that demonstrates how to use loose substrates, but minimizing the risk of impaction at the same time. I wrote the guide when I was using a type of gravel, but it will work with sand too.<br>  <br>  Here's the guide = <a href="http://easttnherps.com/yak/index.php?topic=5.0" rel="nofollow">http://easttnherps.com/yak/index.php?top...</a><br>  <br>  Here I made a video where I applied the same concept as in the guide, but actually did use sand instead of gravel = <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp25ZRHYhUI" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp25ZRHYh...</a><br>  <br>  Notice that most of what the geckos/snake is exposed to is natural rock, because the rock actually covers 75-80% of the surace area, while the sand/gravel just fills in the cracks.
FTL1F0fGaa	honestly just google it its alot easier than waiting for someone to give you an answer on here|`|MiKrWuM6aa	Your questions are impossible to answer.  Every species of fish lays a different amount of eggs, and there are trillions of fish in the world and some haven't even been discovered yet.  Your question is too broad.|`|HtiI05Tmaa	google it! =]|`|GmzxBW7Caa	The first question is impossible. It depends on what type of fish lays the eggs.<br>  For the second question, there are 29,000 species of fish in the world, but there are probably many more to be discovered.|`|KiDq2xNiaa	a fish can lay between 1 and several million. and the number of fish in the world is uncountable.<br>  a sun fish can lay millions of eggs in a year and its about the size of a cow.|`|m7TZKc58aa	There are many fishes reproducing at this point so the exact number of fish is an impossible number amount. And bigger fish lay less. Smaller fish get more of there sack filled so they have more fish around 500.
s76aC4G8aa	I would suggest both.  I first socialized my 5 month old Weimaraner with puppy training classes at PetsMart then when she was about 6 months old I took her to the dog park.  She was scared at first but soon got the hang of it.  However, dog parks can be unpredictable and there are owners there that have no control over their dogs and quite honestly don't care about their dogs bad behavior.  Then there are the very overprotective owners that freak if your dog plays with their dog too roughly.  So while they can be fun and a great way for both dog and owner to socialize they can be either a great experience for the dog or it could be a nightmare.<br>  <br>  The only way to find out is take him, keep a good eye on him and if you think it's too much, remove him immediately from the park and try again another day at a different time. The weekends are usually not the best time because so many people and dogs are there it can become too overwhelming, try during the week when fewer dogs are there and his experience can be less traumatizing.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|AA10229248	Puppy kindergarten is a controlled setting. The dog park isn't. You never know when there's going to be some idiot with an untrained dog at the dog park. Next thing you know your dog is getting into a fight and becomes fearful of other dogs. At puppy kindergarten there is a trainer there to supervise and break things up.|`|T8OFsBUUaa	I would take him to a puppy kindergarten class. Dogs at the dog park can be unpredictable, and throwing your puppy into a possible aggression filled park on his first social visit could permanently scar him.<br>  <br>  A puppy class is safer, the other dogs there wont be nearly as big, and he'll learn the importance of playing and socializing at the mental level he is at. I don't imagine he'll get a whole lot of dogs his age at the park for a while.<br>  <br>  Plus, besides he already knows all the basic commands, there could be additional things you can learn in a class, which would benefit both of you.|`|p3vjvzRPaa	Puppy kindegarten for sure.<br>  <br>  At a dog park you don't know what kind of dogs he will meet - it's an uncontrolled situation.  If you are unlucky enough to meet a few 'bad' dogs your pup could learn some awful behaviours.  A puppy being attacked at a sensitive age can set them back a long way.<br>  <br>  You may learn a bit at a puppy class, but even if you don't it is a safer environment.<br>  <br>  P.S. In response to another answer:  At 3 months he can't go for long walks - bad for his bone development|`|vEre2nPwaa	the best way for dogs to learn isnt human dissaplin if they get yelled at at puupy class it wont help them......at a dog park if they do something they shouldnt and a dog doesnt like it it will definitly teach a dog.......i think your dogs doing well. only go to puppy kindergarten if your thinking of putting him in competetions. hope it helps|`|xyrSl2nSaa	i wouldn't pay money to have my dog socialized. I took my dog to the dog park and let her be around my friends dogs. I brought my dog to their houses and they would bring their dogs to my house... it worked great!
iVQULHqYaa	Put a baby gate at the bottom of the stairs to stop her going to the top.|`|enC9TvxUaa	-Does she have a problem with the stairs?  Sounds like she is scared when you go out of sight and she is stuck on the stairs alone.|`|XacL7v9Xaa	I'd relocate to a bungallow.
vjijiJT3aa	separate the two you want to breed.
tBl2o1v1aa	Your rat will need a buddy.  Get one of the same sex unless you plan on spaying a female or neutering a male.  Spaying a female will have a lot of health benefits as it will decrease or eliminate the chance for brain pituitary tumors and mammary tumors. The rats don't have to be the same size but being that they may not get along at first you'll want to introduce them on neutral territory.  A bathroom or bathtub is a good place.  Place them both together in there and let them sniff each other.  There might be some sniffing and mounting but that is perfectly normal.  One rat is going to establish alpha even if it is a female.<br>  <br>  As for rat diet, dog food is OK (as it's pretty much the same as lab blocks) as long as the protein level is under 18% and it's a high quality protein.  Kitten or Cat food is NOT okay for a rat.  Lab blocks such as Harlan Tekland or even Mazuri are good also. DO NOT and I repeat DO NOT feed Kaytee food.  They use a preservative that causes cancers in small animals.  Actually you shouldn't use a lab block where the first ingredient is corn.  Google Suebee's Diet.  It is a nice diet that your rats will enjoy.  If you get male rats do not feed them citrus fruits.  There is a forbidden foods list for rats go search for it.<br>  <br>  As for bedding, stay away from pine or cedar.  Aspen is perfectly okay if you want to use a wood bedding.  Carefresh is okay also but I find it a bit dusty.  Yesterday News is even better but it's good to mix it with something else because it's kind of rough.  I actually prefer ecobedding because it stays dry and all the moisture soaks to the bottom.  Being that it is just crinkled paper there is no dust.  Most rats can be litter trained (put a litter pan in the corner of their cage with litter in it and move the turds there as you see them) so fleece is probably the best choice.  No dust, and you can wash it every week saving money.<br>  <br>  If you get another rat you will need a cage that is big enough for 2 rats.  Search "rat cage calculator" and put the dimensions of your cage in.  It will tell you how many rats it is good for.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.  If you have any questions feel free to email me.|`|KeevlZnTaa	Most people feed their rats lab blocks, Harlan teklad is a good brand. Some people feed dog food as a part of a certain diet. "Suebee" is an example of one of the diets that used dog food in the ingredients. You cannot just use dog food, or even just use any brand. You need to get a good quality, low protein food.<br>  <br>  I personally think a good lab block and a grain mixture is one of the best diet to feed them, veggies can be added also. I recently tweaked my boys diet with the help of another member on this site. <br>  <br>  Aspen bedding is ok for rats. Stay away from pine and cedar. Another good bedding is carefresh.<br>  <br>  You do need another rat. Females are easier to into in my opinion, but I have also introed males. I found that letting them play together on neutral ground will get them used to each other. When I kept a lot of rats I always allowed them to play together on the bed, all my rats were used to each other, so I never had a problem with them getting along.<br>  <br>  When you do get another rat, you need to quarantine for at least a month. There are some illnesses that do not show up for a month and you don't want a new rat making the old one ill. They should be in different air spaces and have no contact, be sure to wash hands between touching them.<br>  <br>  The size, and age usually does not matter(and there are no breeds of rats). I have had large dumbo males with small sized rats. I have also had mixed ages together.<br>  <br>  Be sure you know the size of the cage you should have. There are a lot of people that keep them in cages that are too small. Each rat needs at least 2 cubic feet each.<br>  <br>  Websites:<br>  <a href="http://www.dapper.com.au/index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dapper.com.au/index.htm</a><br>  <a href="http://www.goosemoose.com/component/option,com_smf/Itemid,118/forum,rat" rel="nofollow">http://www.goosemoose.com/component/opti...</a><br>  <a href="http://ratfanclub.org/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://ratfanclub.org/index.html</a><br>  <a href="http://www.rmca.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.rmca.org/</a>|`|gTXUcd1maa	Hi<br>   Rats eat rat food. Kaytee is a good brand. They can also eat carrots and some other veggies. They like sunflower seeds with no shells too. Dog food is not good to feed a rat. Aspen bedding is not good for rodents in general ( causes breathing difficulties) use something not wood related. Ask a store employee for help.<br>  <br>       Since this rat is  coming from another house  to yours, it is not going to be used to the rat that you choose to buy ( if you buy another rat.)<br>   You should buy another rat though, to keep the other from getting depressed. Buy the same gender. <br>  Since this rat was an only rat, it is going to hate it's new rat buddy at first. so put up a separator. its a sheet of cage that goes inside to separate them.<br>  <br>  heres a site :]<br>  <a href="http://www.ratrage.worldbreak.com/custom.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ratrage.worldbreak.com/custom...</a><br>  <br>    Also, search " rat care" and " taking care of my rat" on the web<br>  <br>    good luck|`|51St5GEcaa	If it is a girl, you can get her a friend of any age. If it is a boy, you should get him a friend who's about the same size. They will probably fight a bit, and you could consider getting him a female friend and just having her spayed. Rats need friends. They are social creatures and it is cruel to keep them alone. I initially only got one little girl rat and she almost died from the stress until I got her a friend and she perked up and started eating again.<br>  <br>  As to the food, any rat food is good. You'll find it near hamster food in big grocery stores like walmart or in pet stores. It should specifically say FOR RATS. But you can't just feed them rat food. They won't live very long like that. <br>  <br>  I give mine soy milk, mixed nuts, all the fruits and veggies they want, wheat crackers, rice, and so on. As long as you eat a healthy diet, they can share your food. <br>  <br>  <br>  Rats are prone to cancer. Most females die of tumors. You can prevent this by giving them a diet rich in soy, and antioxidant carrying foods like blueberries, and omega-3 rich foods like fish.<br>  <br>  They also like canned kitten food, canned peas, and sweet cornbread. <br>  <br>  I don't know about dogfood. <br>  <br>  Aspen bedding is fine. They also like shredded paper, and I keep a washcloth hammock in the cage with my two baby females.<br>  <br>  Also, you can litter box train them. They are really good pets. <br>  Good luck and have fun!|`|A2IDiIpIaa	Hey  I have three rats an all this information is good.<br>  The best type of food is Oxbow Regal Rat (you can get it on amazon).<br>  Kaytee has ethoxyquin which has been proven cancerous.<br>  Dog food is okay as a supplement but should not be used as a main food because it has too high of a crude fat content for a healthy rat. Aspen is the best of the wood beddings but the best possible is Carefresh ULTRA (I use it). But aspen is okay.<br>  They should have a friend but if it is already adult sized and a male (females work better with eachother)  if you want to introduce more introduce two or more young ones as there is less of a chance of fighting.<br>  They get to play with each other instead of bugging the older one and provoking a fight.<br>  Rats are social and rarely fight for real. They will do dominance fighting and WILL squeak. This is just something that happens.<br>  The best website in my mind is <br>  <a href="http://www.dapper.com.au" rel="nofollow">http://www.dapper.com.au</a><br>  It has almost all things ratty.<br>  Hope I helped<br>  Sugar, Dash and Pepper (they are my rats and dash is on my lap right now) all approve this information.<br>  Hope I helped.|`|qBz0ZfzFaa	I just got two little rats on Monday and I already ADORE them. They are the cutest, sweetest things ever. ONe of them runs climbs up my body to sit on my shoulder and give me kisses on my earlobe everytime she sees me. I have heard it is best to have a pair of rats so they can keep each other company...they can get depressed if they are alone all the time. They are social animals. Don't use aspen bedding because the oils in it can give your rat allergies and respiratory infections. There are lots of good website; just do a google search for rat care. They can eat lots of stuff. I feed mine Teklad blocks (rat/mouse food) and also give them little bits of fruits, vegetables, breakfast cereals. Look up the website "The Dapper Rat", they have tons of information. I think you will love your rats.

sgr01OCkaa	first you need to accept that your horse is head shy and if it is because he was abused previously then you need to realize that to some degree he will always be head shy.<br>  to 'solve' this problem all you need is patience, patience and more patience! just start by petting his neck and slowly working your way up to his ears, but don't go any further for about a week or so. Just prove to your horse that you are trustworthy and that you wont hurt him, you are obviously half way there if he sometimes lets you pet his face. also work on doing things around and near his face like putting on and taking off a halter and brushing his face or forelock gently while he is tied up so he cant move away but pay attention to his body language and if he looks angry or upset about you touching his face, back off for a while and do something else for a little while and then resume. Another thing you can do is when you bring him a treat pet his face while he is eating it out of your hand, because his attention will be focused elsewhere he will probably accept the contact. Good luck.|`|RloOJ43haa	You need to desensitize him to having his head touched. That means that you touch his head every day. At first it may be for just a few seconds. Then you praise him and perhaps give a treat. As he learns to tolerate this, you extend the amount of time you touch him.|`|PEPWFGNGaa	Time.<br>  Be aware of any sudden movements you might be making near his face, any shouting etc. Don't be pushy but make a point of touching him around his head as often as you can - take time when you groom him and scratch behind his ears and talk to him.<br>  <br>  Edit - just a thought, you might want to get his teeth checked out, a sore mouth would be enough to make anyone headshy.|`|FcR8G8hPaa	The horse visual system shows hands approaching the head as some fairly weird phenomena that would probably scare you too.<br>  <br>  First, try to avoid putting your hand to the front of the head. Extend it past the side and rub the back and sides of the jaw or the front of the next. If you want to scratch the top of the head, reach that area from behind the head, scratching all the way.<br>  <br>  Second, if you must approach from the front, do so slowly showing your hand from a distance at all angles until he is calm. Do not retreat and use the lead line to keep the horse from flipping his head. Any times he avoids your hand or gets you to move your hand back he is rewarded for that behavior and gets more "headshy" - you will actually be training him to get worse. Eventually, you can move your hand to his face from the front and he won't be frightened.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|abMqdpHyaa	Well, some horses (and any other living thing, for that matter!) just don't like being petted very much, it's more just 'toleration' than enjoyment. So if you want your horse to allow you to pet him, you must make it enjoyable. Try hand-feeding and petting at the same time, horses love their food! Also, try to find any places where he particularly likes to be scratched or rubbed, and he'll be won over instantly!!|`|sX17XtVWaa	oh,sugar goes along way.Sounds like he was hit before in the face.He needs to trust you.Never stand directly in front of him,they are intimidated.Don't ever do anything to startle him in front of him.You'll need to treat occasionally.I use to place my hand on the poll of the horse,say down then treat.It took a while but it worked.Also try and check his teeth,could be scared of you touching them and hurting him.i've had an Arab with the same problem.Good luck|`|4253fb6106243c0983e2542e5a7a5adaaa	Greg gave you the right answer, but let me expound on it just a little.  I've got a mare that's off the track - her handlers used to twist her ear to get her to cooperate so when I got her, she wouldn't let anyone near her head at all.<br>  <br>  You start by touching Moroc softly on the neck as close to the ears or head as he'll allow.  Note that place for future reference as the edge of his 'comfort zone'.  When you're quielty working with him or standing and petting him.  Simply stroke his neck starting at a very comfortable place for him, perhaps down by his shoulder even.  Stroke back and forth, up and down, getting closer to his head then retreating back to the comfort zone.  If you simply grab at him and try to touch where he doesn't trust you, you're acting as a predator would and you're not building his trust.  By approach and retreat, your seeing how far he's OK then retreating which shows him you won't force him into anything while also showing him he's not going to get hurt.<br>  <br>  You'll eventually be able to touch many places on his head.  Find the places he likes being touched.  Mine are taught early on that the insides of the ears is a good scratchy place.  Once this mare would allow me to touch her ears, I scratched gently inside.  It only lasted a second is all she'd let me.  Then I'd go away and let her think about it.  Later, she'd let me touch her ears sooner and for longer.  Now all I have to do is rub my hand up her neck toward her ears and she'll tip her head toward me inviting me to scratch her ears.  She also likes having her eyes gently rubbed.  She gets crusties in the corners of her eyes and likes it when I run them off gently and brush my hands gently around her eyes.<br>  <br>  The key is to do the same amount of work from both sides of the head- don't just focus on one side.  Also, don't keep at it for hours at a time, only a few moments, maybe 15 at most total.  They will think about their experience until you try again.  Also remember horses have good and bad days just like us so if one day it seems Moroc's less willing to allow you to touch his head than others, give him space and understanding.  This will further build the trust he has in you.|`|xzJi0bcSaa	I would start by petting his neck and slowly working your way towards his head. Get to where he starts to get uncomfortable and move away again. Keep doing this until he will let you pet him and doesnt get uncomfortable. Its going to take a lot of time but it will be worth it! I dont recommend treats because they get nippy. I would however agree with the person who suggested grooming and such. Dont push him and the more you work with him the more he will trust you. I hope that helps!

9BwQMXycaa	two point:<br>   the two-point position is the position you go in when you are jumping.  It is also known as the jumping position(to some). When you want to go into a two-point, you stand in your stirrups and bend your knees.  Your body must be close to the tack but your butt cannot touch the saddle.  Your upper body must be slightly forward and your hands up the neck a slight bit. your lower leg has to stay still and under you.  Your legs don't move, they stay at the same place as when you are sitting normaly.  your heels stay down and hold some mane if you are not used to it and are going to lose your ballance.<br>  <br>  three-point:<br>   three-point position is the position you normaly have.  You sit streight with your legs under you your hands infront of you and your eyes up.<br>  <br>  half seat:<br>   the half seat is similar to the two-point.  The difference is you are lower in the tack and your crotch touches the saddle still.  Your upper body must be less forward and your hands stay at their place.  the purpose of this position is just to take some weight off of your horse's back, not complete freedom.<br>  <br>  hope i've helped!!<br>  <br>  ive got some pics for you in the sources...|`|KSgn6rSNaa	I do ride, but I have never heard of half seat, however 2 point position is the position you assume when u are posting, you some about half an inch off the saddle repeatedly, you are in this position also when you take small jumps. 3 point position is when you are making contact with your horse in 3 places, your heels, your calves and your hands on your horses neck, You would assume this position when  jumping over large fences(jumps). I hope ive helped you a bit.|`|PnZlFQeOaa	I haven't ridden in some time but i do remember some stuff.  If i can recall the three point refers to three points of your body on the horse - legs, knees and tush (sit the trot).  The two point is where you raise yourself up so that your tush is no longer on the saddle and only your legs and knees are making contact with the horse - hard to do at a walk but easier with speed.  The half seat is similar to the two point but not as tall - like the up position when you post.  either way i found a decent web site that has detailed instructions on the three and two point positions.<br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|RloOJ43haa	Mello Freak and Bruno M are correct.|`|z3Z7AQWPaa	Three point is also known al a full seat.

Rw7gi86Naa	When a cat curls back its upper lip and looks like it’s sneering, it has just discovered an interesting, usually intense odor and smells it more deeply.  Called “flehming,” it is drawing the odors into an organ, (Jacobson’s organ), in the roof of its mouth.|`|CWrDdr89aa	It sounds to me like the 'Flehmen Reaction', does your cat look like its grimacing in horror? If it does then its that, its totally normal though, when a cat detects a pungent or interesting smell, it raises its head and draws back its lips, this is known flehming, and the cat is actually tasting the smell its picked up :)<br>  <br>  EDIT:<a href="http://i39.tinypic.com/20u7hgz.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i39.tinypic.com/20u7hgz.jpg</a><br>  The Flehman reaction in a cat|`|PZM1TDf9aa	Like the other girl said she may be bored or daydreaming.Plus if your cat thinks it funny to you she will do it.|`|6tasOiCDaa	maybe they are bored. haha my friends cat sits there with her mouth open and tongue out just because she thinks its fun.
p3vjvzRPaa	I breed boxers so am biased!<br>  <br>  I won't tell you everything about how wonderful boxers are but some things that may be less likely to be in books...<br>  <br>  Statistics on dogs biting humans usually have labradors and lab crosses near the top.  Boxers are also a common breed, but they are less likely to bite.<br>  <br>  When I was little the neighbour's black lab bite me in the face when I tripped over it.  When my family decided to buy a dog soon after, they chose a boxer after careful research because (among other things) they are less inclined to snap when startled.<br>  <br>  My experience with boxers over the last 35 years (compared to other breeds I interact with in my training classes and at competitions) is that they are certainly far less likely to use their teeth on people or other dogs. (They also have small teeth compared to many breeds).<br>  <br>  Not using their teeth is really important when children are around.<br>  <br>  Boxers also have a real sense of fun (many books use the phrase 'clown of the dog world').  They really like to play and interact with people - again great for children (and I speak as a child who grew up with boxers).   My boxers play like puppies through into old age - this is a trait that I don't see as often in other breeds.<br>  <br>  Also consider the history/purpose of both breeds.  Labs are gundogs.  <br>  <br>  Boxers are all purpose working dogs - bred to be loyal guard dogs able to protect the family (among other things).  <br>  <br>  Boxers are excellent guard dogs - don't need to be trained.  They'll be friendly to people (they love people) until there is a genuinely threat.  I have several times had the experience of my seemingly goofy loving boxer, stopping someone in their tracks when circumstances were suspicious - no biting, just bailed the person up so they couldn't move.<br>  <br>  All dogs potentially have a protective instinct but a boxer much more so than a lab.  I may be wrong but I suspect that if a thief offered a lab a food treat the lab would let them away with anything!<br>  <br>  In my experience, labs are slower, greedier, more obedient.  Boxers more energetic, smart so easy to train, but their sense of fun can mean they don't always *want* to obey (just means you need to be clear and consistent with your training).<br>  <br>  Physically, labs are bigger and heavier.<br>  <br>  Boxers can drool due to their pendulous jowls (flews), but some have more flews than others.  Also, every dog drools, and I've seen more labs sitting dribbling for food than boxers!<br>  <br>  I think I've waffled more than enough.<br>  <br>  Read about the breed characteristics in a dog book for an unbiased overview, or search for websites.|`|AA12148328	It isn't for anyone else to decide , that's a family decision . <br>  I have a white lab and she is a wonderful dog .|`|2lNM2xBmaa	Those are two great breeds for children and a family environment, in my opinion. They both have a good sense of humor and are very forgiving. They are both durable enough to withstand a lot of pounding, pulling, tugging and rough play. <br>  <br>  The Boxer has the short and lower maintenance coat. The Lab has the undercoat and will require more grooming. However, if you live in a cold climate, the Lab will probably do better. The Boxer will probably need a jacket to go outside in cold weather. <br>  <br>  Please don't crop the Boxer's ears. It is much more humane.<br>  <br>  I would definitely recommend spaying or neutering your pet to make it a dog that is easier to live with and will be more focused on your family. <br>  <br>  In addition to the family events, both will need separarte exercise like running, jogging, swimming for the Lab or ball playing. <br>  <br>  Go to www.petfinder.org and search under the breeds and your location. Please check into rescue because there are many, many dogs in those breeds that need homes. I would recommend going with a rescue group who already have the dogs in homes and can make sure they are great with kids. <br>  <br>  Finally, it will be your responsibility to teach the kids to be respectful of the dog and to teach the dog to be respectful of the kids. I would recommend both being supervised when together until the kids are old enough to be more responsible.|`|FqV2KFYAaa	I'd say a boxer, I have one and sadly had to recently put one to sleep. I have two very rambunctious kids and the dogs just fitted in with them . Boxers are friendly loyal and brilliant with kids. losing Molly was like losing one of the family. i had a lab once when i was little and it was so naughty! It used to eat everything there was just no filling her up, she once ate through a cupboard door to get to the dog food on the other side. Still loved her though.|`|mC4mnvGFaa	If you want a breed that is  gentler with small children, go with the lab, or look into getting an akbash dog or mix of the lab and akbash. We had one and the baby could drag it around by its whiskers and all he would do is whine,  from what I've been told by friends, a boxer will snap sooner at a small child that a lab will. but it all depends on how old your children are, and how rambunctious.|`|bJh1MesQaa	Boxers are cuter|`|d5YcH69Paa	Size is about the same, energy levels and trainability is also pretty much the same for both breeds.  The both suffer from roughly the same health concerns though boxers are a bit more prone to certain cancers than Labs.<br>  <br>  Boxers are short--coated, rambunctious, like to "wrestle" can occasionally be DA (dog aggressive) are clownish but will usually guard you and your home.<br>  <br>  Labs, are medium-coated, shed a lot more than most people think, can be VERY mouthy puppies and have to be taught that puppy nips HURT, will generally play fetch all day but don't really enjoy a bunch of rough play and for the most part will let a burglar walk off with everything you own.|`|cwZ2Q8kYaa	I used to have boxers, and my grandparents have a chocolate lab (he's a few months but looks about full grown). I love both breeds, but I'd go with boxers. They're my favourite dog breed, and they're very affectionate towards everyone, especially children. But, if you get a boxer, either take him to a doggy daycare/petsitter for the day when you're not home, or get another dog for him or something, because they get very lonely, the poor guys. I'm most likely getting another boxer in early 2010.|`|2qRaprunaa	i have a lab<br>   i love her to death. she loves everyone and everything.my lab is bigger than a boxer and requires alot of attention. my lab can be left alone for long times and is very smart to schedules.<br>   my dog  knows the family schedules and greats everyone when they come home. she is laying by the door now --my husbands due home in 20 mins.<br>   i can honestly say i love the lab.<br>  <br>  shes the most reliable caring  dog ive owned.|`|KSgn6rSNaa	I am probably a little biased on this question because ive owned several labs myself and they are a wonderful breed, but this desicion should be made with your family, because it is them who is going to have this dog. So I say Lab, not Boxer, but you should do some research yourself|`|kNscpF4Faa	Both are great.  I have a boxer now and have had a black lab.  I feel the boxer is more of a kid kinda dog while being a good guard dog also, so is lab but boxer more so..You have to rowdy boys go for Boxer,|`|njAD3U5Aaa	Two great breeds! Both very caring and have lots on energy. Boxers drool and howl a little more then labs. But labs are everywhere.... little too over played.|`|qyMc5yOFaa	Boxer would be best <br>  <br>  <br>  labradors are wild without proper traing and can get fat easly|`|rbtO73eZaa	diffidently get a boxer|`|K2RHMRBIaa	I would say a boxer. <br>  <br>  Both dogs chew, but labradors tend to do it more often, although if you are to get either of these dogs be prepared for your house to be damaged and it would be best to make sure for until the dog is about a year old not to leave it alone for too long, as they are intelligent breeds they get bored easily and turn to the furniture to relieve it. <br>  <br>  Although boxers drool, labradors do also, just not as much. For boys especially, i would say a boxer would be best, as they enjoy wrestling, and much prefer rough playing to labradors. <br>  <br>  Overall i would say Boxer because i know how adorable, loyal and amusing they can be. If you any sense of humour at all, you will choose a boxer for sure!|`|AHF0DR9baa	I have had both breeds, and both my dogs were lovely and loving family pets.<br>  Our labrador was a ***** and was very soppy and affectionate.  Our boxer was a boy and was a little more stand-offish, but very patient with kids and great as a guard dog (and good protection when me or my sister were out walking alone with him!)<br>  Both dogs had lots of energy but the boxer needed more walking.<br>  Both dogs were well up for a bit of rough and tumble and were easily trained.<br>  The labrador lived to 11, the boxer til 7.  The boxer succumbed to cancer in the leg which I believe is common in these dogs.  He was a pedigree.<br>  If I was to choose a family pet, I would be happy to have either.  But psychologically, a boxer is much scarier looking so that could be a factor if your wife and kids are often left alone in the house - our boxer scared off burglars several times.  Also if you want the boys to have a lot of time outdoors get a boxer - then they'll HAVE to take it for walks!  (they don't need ridiculous amounts, but we used to walk ours 3 times a day for about half an hour, and the labrador twice).<br>  Hope you get a perfect new pet as part of your family!|`|5fRcwoT5aa	Two great family dogs!  I would say to get a boxer...Boxers are a little more playful and will definetly love the kids, you just have to be careful (depending on how old your boys are) because they can get too playful and jump on the kids.  Training wise, boxers are extremely easy to train!  Also, you won't have to groom them at all!|`|abjz3Zbsaa	BOXER, without a doubt.  I got my boxer pup in 1999, my first son came along in 2000 and my next son in 2001.  My Boxer took to my kids like they were her own.  She even slept with her head in their bassinet (via laying on the couch) to make sure nothing hurt them.  She is extremely protective with all children (not just my own) and has NEVER in her 10 years EVER shown aggression towards children.  My boys are rather high-strung, but our Boxer just "goes with the flow"...when she gets tired of them bothering her, she gives me "the look" and goes off to another room for some quiet time.  Never, ever showing them any aggression.  She has been a terrific family dog, one that I will never ever forget.<br>  <br>  Boxer's learn the family routine rather quickly, and mine has been house trained since she was 6 months old!  They just want to be part of the family.  Remember, too that Boxers are actually indoor dogs, if they end up living outdoor, it will decrease their life-span drastically.  My Boxer sleeps in whoesever bed has enough room for her.  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I don't know about all this "drooling" talk, my Boxer doesn't drool, and never has.  Also, she only barks when she's playing and has never barked just to bark.  GO FOR A BOXER - THEY ARE TERRIFIC!!!|`|UnATNqlsaa	It depends on how much space you have. If its a small hous with a small back yard i wouyld go with the boxer but labradors are the greatest pets in this world. i have tw and they are the sweetest kindest most fun energetic animals in this world. but a golden retrever is a great pet too. Most of the time boys like labs bc they will play anytime night or day whanever and they LOVE water. if you have a pool that dog will be in dog hevan. trust me. Either way both are great pets but if i were you i would go with the lab.|`|OryQXc8naa	Both breeds are great with family. Both requiere lots of running. If u mind about the drool dont get boxer. if you mind about a some sheding then dont get Lab.<br>  My opinion is Boxer. They are very LOYAL and PLAYFUL and they will guard you with their life. Plus they look Buffed :D|`|AA11906242	Boxer  They almost seem human.  I always tell my Boxers, that that are a genetic  mistake . That they really are human. Look into their eyes. That's how you can tell which dog to get.   <br>  <br>   Jen|`|Yf1Ig8E9aa	i would say get a boxer.<br>  they are great dogs!   labs are alot more greedy, ,i have 3 friends with labs and they all steal food if you leave it on the kitchen side <br>  <br>  :S not good|`|okAYAGvXaa	These two breeds are not comparable at all.<br>  It's a decision for you and your WHOLE family.|`|NTsdSHY7aa	labs

The information and application is available through this website.|`|ctiKoGGfaa	I doubt its legal anywhere in the US. I also doubt that its legal to export them from Africa.|`|9759e8014743debd3d3fd1a7ad437c1faa	I don't know if it's legal, but I want one, too.  The main thing that's holding me back is that I read that an anteater eats up to 30,000 ants and other insects per day. I still haven't figured out where I'll get 30,000 ants every day.    P.S. How can you live in Florida and not have an ant problem?
eUDPfWdpaa	W e have a morkie--maltiese, yorkie, she used to be that way, try watching the Dog Whisper you can really learn alot.|`|L2Gi2tPmaa	When he goes into the crazy act, don't react by trying to comfort him with baby talk or petting him.  That would only be reinforcing a bad behavior.    Here is a website that should help you.|`|HUlyRTrraa	Reel the leash in so he can feel your power.|`|Ee2fwrqoaa	What the hell is a Porkie Yorkie?|`|5rfnEQnGaa	First if all, without putting a lead on, get your dog to follow you around your room or yard, use a titbit and say "good" and reward wehn the dog is walking at your side.   Do this a few times a day, but not for long sessions, until to puppy is happily walking with you.     Make sure the puppy is used to wearing just a flat collar, no lead at this stage. Once the puppy is used to both, you can attach a light piece of string to the collar when you are doing the above "follow" exercise, but do not pick the string up. The puppy will get used to the string attached to the collar without any enforcement this way, so no need to fight it.    Once the puppy is doing this happily, you may then attach a very lightweight lead and do the same.  When the puppy is happy, lightly pick up the lead and repeat.  This way, your puppy will associate walking on the lead with something pleasurable and not something to be fought.     Your puppy is too young yet to walk out where other dogs go until all vaccinations have been given, so you can do this on your own home ground in the meantime. Don't rush it, take your time.      Once all above is achieved you can start to venture out with the puppy, again using titbits and reward when the puppy is walking positively by your side.     Hope this helps and good luck. Don't rush it, this is going to decide for life if your dog is going to walk ahppily on a loose lead by your side or not.    p.s. your dog is a crossbreed, there is no such breed as a porky, yorkie poo or yorkiepoodle or any other such made up name.|`|F6U9eM6Gaa	i used to have a dog just like that! the best way that worked for us was to hold the leah near his neck and keep him at your side at all times if you let him in front of you he get's the idea he's the front of the pack (the leader) so don't let him do that. if that dosn't work try getting a choke collar i know it sounds mean but it teach's tham a lesson.|`|rDLTnjRyaa	Don't let him do that if he has a collar on because he could get injured. Is he anxious? Or is he just feeling all excited? If he is all excited and stuff, change your approach when you are getting ready to take him out on a walk. If you are speaking to him in a high voice or like you are on some sugar high, start toning down. Get the leash and say to him in a neutral voice, "Let's go for a walk" or just say "Time to go out". Do not attach the leash until the dog is in the sitting position, and he has to stay in that position while you are attaching the leash. Start teaching him to heel. As soon as he starts to jump and do twists, stop walking and tell him No in a firm voice. Wait until he sits. Don't give him the response he is hoping for. every time he does it, you stop. You tell him No and then pay no further attention to him. This way you won't have to worry about hurting him. Once he is actually walking nice on leash, make sure that he doesn't get in front. He has to learn to heel so you can have control of him at all times. Not every dog on the street is going to get along with him and you want to prevent your dog from being attacked. If he is close to you, the odds of that happening are slim. The other reason he needs to learn to heel is because you don't want him to dart into traffic. Always keep an eye on him and do not allow him to go in any direction that you aren't going. He has to learn who is the pack leader. p.s : I advise against choke collars especially for small dogs because they could do damage to the windpipe. It doesn't matter what kind of dog a person has, every dog has to be trained properly. If your dog just doesn't like the leash and is refusing to go on a walk, you will have to give him a gentle tug until he does. Once he is walking give him praise. Gradually pick up the pace.|`|5919d59a9a07aac4e14c50ba4d7d46b9aa	in a strong voice tell him no at the same time pulling the leash down|`|s76aC4G8aa	It's a Yorkipoo not a porkie.    He is twisting because he's not used to being on a leash, don't pull him when you walk [and at 2 months he should not be going on walks because he's not vaccinated properly yet] put the leash on him in the house and allow him to drag it around with him.  Then when you take him outside walk backwards calling him to you and when he comes on his own volition reward with a treat do this while holding the leash, don't pull don't drag, let the pup just walk around while you hold the leash following if necessary.  Over time he'll get used to walking on one.  If he sits down and refuses to move just encourage him by calling and offering a treat, don't pull him to get him going.  Remember if you make leash walking unpleasant or something to fear he'll never accept the leash.    Be patient all new things like leashes etc must be introduced to a puppy slowly and with no stress, if he freaks when you put the leash on then sitting down and feeding him treats while you hook the leash on and take it off several times will make him associate positive things with the leash.  Then just let him drag it around the house.|`|RqcLxDesaa	First of all..what the heck is a "porkie yorkie poodle"? I've been in the dog business for 35 years, never heard of that one. Try letting your puppy drag the leash around for a few days, so he's not afraid of it. Next, squat down and coax him toward you, reward him with food when he comes toward you. Back up and repeat. When he has that down, stand up and repeat the process. Then take him to a park that allows dogs and try the steps again, unless of course he has finally decided there is a wonderful world to explore and then you have to keep up with him! Make it fun. Good luck.|`|S6aCwLuEaa	Every dog that has never walked on a leash will protest initially. What I did was put the leash on and wait for his jumping and twisting to stop. It could even take 5 minutes or more. In this time do not speak, comfort or even give any eye contact to the dog. The dog will get tired and calm down. Praise him and treat him when he is calm. Start walking. Initially take only a couple of steps and stop. If he pulls start the process again. Soon he will be walking on the leash without a problem. Patience is key.
ICzM3T8taa	The tank is over crowed right now. inch per gallon rule and you should also think of how wide the fish are two. You need at least a ten gallon tank to keep all these fish together and your Zebra danios might nip the guppies nice long colorful tails. I think you should get a bigger tank before you get anymore fish. Also you need to get a cleaner fish like some shrimp or a snail.|`|Jkt3UkTBaa	The general rule is, every fish that is 1 inch should have at least 1 gallon to itself.  So you are already trying to cram 7 inchs of fish into a 4 gallon tank? you should have a 10 gallon tank ATLEAST. I would get rid of some of the guppies. also the guppies are going to reproduce like crazy and some of the young are bound to survive so your tank is going to be way overstocked in no time, if you want to keep your fish, i would recommend getting at least a 10 gallon.  I hope you have a heater, bubbler and a filter?  have you cycled the tank?  What's the water quality?  well i hate to discourage you but, you have got a terrible setup, get a 10 gallon   good luck!|`|MPQI8Bg3aa	I wouldn't get any more Zebra Danios. Your tank is very crowded now, getting more is only going to make that worse. Also Danios are a very active fish and need a lot of room to chase each other.|`|hCyt28Meaa	The tank is a little bit overcrowded right now, the beneficial bacteria that you want won't be able to keep the tank clean with all those fish, and the ammonia buildup could kill your fish. The fish in your tank are more susceptable disease because of the ammonia buildup. I would purchase a cheap 10 gallon tank which you can buy for about $10. Good luck and happy fish-keeping =]|`|dJs2s9pfaa	Okay I see you got alot of answers pertaining to the rule of how many fish per gallon. I would say if you really want to add more fish that is okay, HOWEVER be sure to do a weekly water change of 25%-30% since your tank is getting too much waste than it can handle.     I've been a freshwater hobbyist for 7 years now and I have African Cichlids a fish that you do have to overstock due to aggression so it CAN be done.  Like I said weekly water changes is a must in order to keep them healthy. Zebra Danios are supposed to be in a group of at least 5 so four more can't hurt.    Hope this helps=)|`|x4etCpauaa	The 1 inch rule is bunk. Do not follow it entirely.    Depending if male and female guppies, if all male that is fine. With females gunna have a lot of babies.    I would say you are maxed unless you do regularly water changes.    ("'\(o.o)/"')|`|vqBeaOFIaa	Well, for not as wide fish such as danios and guppies, the one inch rule is sort of overkill. For goldfish, yes, one inch per gallon is the rule of thumb. While I think a whole gallon for each guppie/danio is rather unnecessary, I would recommend a 10 gallon tank because you do have quite a lot of fish for such a small tank.   Also, to answer your question more, danios are schooling fish and love to have other fish around. If you think you need more danios, I suggest getting a bigger tank and perhaps getting rid of a few guppies.|`|4b127bdc65641a05881903d7090f19c2aa	That's too many fish for a 4 gallon tank.  Zebra danios prefer to be in schools of five or more.  If you added four more, that would be 11 fish with a total adult length of 22 inches and you would need at least a 20 gallon tank.  Even for just the seven you have now I'd recommend at least a 15 gallon tank, and not just because of the one inch per gallon rule.  Guppies produce a lot of waste which can raise ammonia levels and harm the fish.  You need more water to keep it from becoming toxic.
OIRI5Ok7aa	First of all, shih tzus are notoriously hard to potty train, even though they're perfect dogs otherwise.  Try walking him around the block or something when it's potty time.  Walking dogs seems to automatically make them want to go.  Plus, the leesh will be different from just going outside (which is associated with play).  You could probably use the leesh and walk him around your own yard, too.  You'll have to go out fairly often at first, as well, but it sounds like you're already doing that.    You'll need a lot of patience, but it will work out great in the long run!  Shih tzu puppies are the cutest things in the world, and when they grow up, they're the best dogs you can get!    Good luck!|`|C1eHfhrHaa	walk him on a leash instead of putting him out in the yard.|`|e54245b949fc37ae37c1c0d76403714daa	Sounds like he is a little confused.  First you take him out for potty only...then he is taken out to play and not potty.  It probably would be less confusing if you took him out on a leash to potty, then let the kids take him out to play.  Business first!!  Play as a reward.  If he just lies in the grass, then you go inside and he potty's...you are letting him get away with this behavior.  Don't let him find a nice spot in the house to potty.  Keep him confined...keep him by your side, with a leash if necessary.  Don't let him have the opportunity to potty in the house.  It may take some time and some patience, but he is still a puppy and still learning the proper behavior.  And if you don't take the time and have the patience to do that, then he will never learn what is acceptable and what isn't.  Don't let the kids play with him until he has pottied.  Go back to the first week.  Outside, potty, treat, inside.  Then let the kids take him outside to play.  Basically no play time until he has pottied.    There are also little belly bands out there that you can wrap around his belly that will protect your furniture, rugs and belongings.  They won't prevent him from peeing, but they will protect you things.  My Tzu didn't like them, and learned quickly that if he pottied outside, then he didn't need to wear it.  Between that, and a potty schedule and proper disipline, he was potty trained very quickly.    Lastly, his "nice spot" needs to be cleaned thoroughly.  Otherwise he will be tempted to keep going there again.  I used Nature's Miracle, but there are others out there.  I used the enzyme based one, I thought it worked better than the Oxygen based one.  But that is your choice.  Whatever you chose to use, that area needs to be cleaned so his scent is gone.  If he smells his scent in an area, he will think it is still OK to go there.  Why put temptation in his way??    Be firm, and in control.  But certainly don't punish him for something he doesn't know is wrong.  You have to teach him what is acceptable and what isn't.  Time, patience and structure.|`|5919d59a9a07aac4e14c50ba4d7d46b9aa	play with him for a couple of minutes or just keep him out a little longer|`|OIYLWJzsaa	you need to start from scratch and teach the kids this same process:    play always comes AFTER potty.    what your puppy probably learned is this:  whenever i go potty with mommy, she gives me a yummy cookie but then i have to go inside.  whenever i go out with the kids, i get to play and have fun.  so he has chosen the scenario that works better for him: holding it as long as possible to get to stay outside.      play and freedom in the yard should be a reward for going potty very quickly.  what you need to do is this (and the same for your kids!).  whenever the dog goes out, he goes on a leash to a designated potty spot.  give him ten mins of encouragement to go.  if he does, make a party out of it, then proceed to give him at least 5 -10 mins of playtime/freedom in the yard.  if he does not go, you must proceed back inside DIRECTLY to his crate for a 5-10 minute holding time.  this is not a punishment, it is a prevention for the accident that is bound to happen if you let a full puppy back inside.  after the crate break, you proceed on a leash directly back to the potty spot, and repeat the same steps until you get a successful potty time.    it is imperative that potty always proceeds things like playtime in the yard, walks, and car rides.  that way the dog learns to empty himself as quickly as possible in order to earn freedom rewards.|`|VXcp8hvHaa	excellent!!|`|b887929b2ebc558a3765f2523821bd14aa	ignore him,, perhaps walk slowly around the yard, he will follow you and the movement will trigger his urge to pee and poop.    give it a bit longer..    also.... if he does not go potty outside,, he gets carried inside and put directly in his crate for 1/2 hour,, then immediately back outside to try again,,,,,, freedom in the house must be earned|`|YUQgyPT3aa	Put him on a leash, take him out, STAY out with hime until he does what he is supposed to, only then, praise him and bring him back in the house.    He is still VERY young and you will need to be patient. If he has a tantrum and lays down because he wants to play, ignore him. A pup that age cannot lay still for very long.

When the steam builds up in the bathroom it helps losen up the clog they feel in their nose. Do this everyday it will also help with the watery eyes. As an antibotic try Clavamox 15ml of Clindamycin 20ml. Have to get that at a vet though|`|GduRpnn0aa	Many cats  especially very young and older cats  are prone to catching upper respiratory infections, similar to colds in humans. These tend to be highly contagious, so its best to keep an infected cat away from others (if possible).    Respiratory infections can be hard on kittens and elderly cats, occasionally resulting in death. And even for otherwise healthy and strong cats, respiratory infections are very unpleasant  just as a cold or flu is unpleasant to you. So its a good idea to get treatment, if only to ease your cats symptoms.    Its quite easy to tell when your cat is suffering from an upper-respiratory infection. Look for these symptoms:    Sneezing   Runny nose   Watery eyes   "Rattling" breath, husky purring   Snoring   Reduced energy levels     For an upper respiratory infection, you could buy Respiratory Aid. It is a herbal supplement that fights the infection and symptoms, whilst also opening up your cats airways therefore allowing easier breathing. It also builds up your cats natural defenses and helps to prevent the spread of infection to other cats as well as preventing reoccurrence of the infection.     Here is the link:http://www.petwellbeing.com/cat-cough-p7...|`|lYdimcoAaa	wierd...im actually going through that issue right now...so based on what the vet said to me about that very same thing only yesterday...your cat either has an infection (which cannot be cured through the standard antibiotics) or kitty pnemonia.  Eating is great, but your cat needs to be drinking water...a cat can pass away from dehydration in a very short amount of time so take her in pronto! but!...what the vet is going to do is give her an x-ray and figure out one of the two things i mentioned is going on and there are just two other types of things they can do to treat it. easy-peasy. but without that next vet apt. things may get scary for you and your cat, so take her in again and good luck to your family|`|ZZVF4Lusaa	Your vet could probably prescribe some eye ointment for their eyes (make sure it doesn't have any cortisone in it), and some cats respond to l-lysine.  VET solutions makes an l-lysine supplement for cats.  You usually have to give it for a few weeks.  It all depends on what kind of virus is causing the infection, though.  If they haven't been tested for Feline Leukemia or FIV, it's a good idea to get that done.  Unfortunately, I have one cat that was really sick as a kitten.  She's now 4 yrs old, and she still sneezes and has runny eyes.  The vets can't really do anything about it.|`|feUxjBbnaa	WTC!  This has gone on for for a MONTH?  I don't care where the cat came from, your new kitten should have had a check up from YOUR vet BEFORE it was exposed to your Harley!  Now you must take both in for a check up, it sounds like a upper respiratory infection, but could be a number of things!  Your vet needs to examine them asap. Just because it came from the Humane society and saw a vet doesn't mean it's completely healthy.  ALWAYS TAKE A NEW KITTEN/CAT TO THE VET BEFORE INTRODUCING IT TO RESIDENT CATS!!!  Get them to the vet asap, they need to be seen and diagnosed, so you can give them the proper treatment.
ZGFXBie9aa	It's very much more important to vaccuum  your gravel if you have an undergravel....    All the waste and debrie is going to be sucked to/into it, and it's important to keep it cleaned so it doesn't clog up.    What your gravel is doing is harbouring the bacteria that reduce ammonia and nitrites and all that - it sucks everything to it and begins nuetralizing it, but you do need to help it along by clearing it out regularly.      I have a 29 gallon with an undergravel filter, too, and I try and vacuum the gravel every week when I give the tank it's 30% water change.      ---    Your water has gone septic due to all the waste caught in your undergravel...     Yeah, you really need to give your tank a good water change... Vacuum the gravel, all the way down, and change 50-65% of your water today... wait a day, and then do a second water change, of about 25-35% and vaccuum just the top inch of gravel...  then you can rest for a while and wait a week before changing water and vacuuming your gravel...|`|SOxdyWQOaa	vacuum the gravel well 25% waters changes every week should help|`|a2cjwMKcaa	If you are running a UG filter you need to vacum the gravel MORE.    Waste is more likely to get sucked into the gravel and build up out of sight. The cycle bacteria in the gravel are stuck to the rock, digging up the gravel and vacuming it wont affect them very much, but uneaten food and crud trapped in the gravel is a bad thing.    Also check how much you are feeding, uneaten food collecting in the gravel can decay and overwhelm your filtering.    Give the tank a good vacum, digging deep in the gravel. A couple of large partial water changes while you are cleaning the gravel will temporarily reduce the ammonia buildup as well. Do as many as you need to bring the ammonia level down untill the cycle recovers.    Ian|`|499ce2344d684feb00ec06bcf55edd71aa	How many fish do you have and what kind of fish are they. It almost sounds like you are overstocked.    I am not sure about the UGF, I don't really like those. They have never worked for me.     I would use a gravel vac and change 35% of the water. Do this every other day until the ammonia is back down to 0ppm.     I can not stress enough, be sure your tank is not overstocked. Also, never feed more than the fish will eat within 3 minutes. These are usually the causes of high ammonia levels.=|`|9759e8014743debd3d3fd1a7ad437c1faa	Yes, it is especially important to vacuum the gravel if you are using undergravel filtration, because otherwise detritus will eventually build up and clog the gravel (preventing water from flowing freely through it), which means the filter will not work properly.    By vacuuming the gravel, you will not remove enough of the beneficial microbes to stop the undergravel filter from breaking down ammonia. Rather, you will make room for the bacteria to multiply faster and therefore consume more ammonia and nitrite to fuel their reproduction.|`|hCyt28Meaa	You should still siphon it every so often, but not too deep, you have to leave some beneficial bacteria. But you don't need to clean the under gravel filter every time you do water changes, I'd do it when doing your monthly 25% water change rather then the 15% weekly water change. Maybe get some snails to help clean the tank up. Good luck, and happy fish-keeping =]|`|OsVswissaa	You especially need to deep vacuum the gravel if you have an undergravel filter.  The gravel acts as the filter medium which needs regular rinsing, and a lot of filth collects under there.  Your HOB filter should have carbon and another media where the bacteria lives.  The carbon should be replaced regularly but the other filter media should only be lightly rinsed.|`|FJHU9PbUaa	Do your water changes by using a gravel vacumm. Undergravel filters don't do the best job, & debris can sit on top of the gravel & not make it to the UGF. Do a 25% water change daily til the ammonia levels drop to 0.

2mLfdJsyaa	Sorry, I'm not a trainer but I can tell you what I would do.    150 lbs?  Wow!      If you can't find a cage big enough where you live, I would look on the internet, but to avoid the expense, I would look at tying him up while I'm gone to something sturdy within my home.  Or maybe go out and buy several 25 or 50 lb weights at Walmart or Academy and tie them together to do the trick.  Then make it comfortable for him, like place a blanket where he's at that he's used before because of the familiar smell.  We always keep my smaller dog in his cage at night and when we go out and tie our larger one (65-70 lbs) to my weight lifting equipment.  There's a rug underneath him and a small throw rug also that he likes to scrunch up and lie with at night.    After a while, they get used to it and consider it their "home" when we go out and at night when they sleep.  Sometimes my big one will go back to this spot during the day and lie there on his own.    Then you might try to find out how to train him out of that chewing problem, but actually, because I wouldn't consider the actions above as hurtful to the dogs, this arrangement would end up being permanent for me.  My dogs have the run of the house when we're home, but not when we go out.  Dogs are smart and they will do different things when alone than when their masters are home.    One time my wife let the two of our dogs out into our unfenced back yard and didn't watch them because they never tried to run away before.  Well, when they noticed she wasn't watching they took off.  We were walking and driving all over the neighborhood trying to find them, to no avail.  Someone stopped them about a mile away (they are inseparable) and called us based on their ID tags.    So now when we let them out to do what they need to do, we WATCH them.  Being inseparable, my wife will keep the smaller one on a leash so the bigger one will stay close on his own.  The smaller one is more prone to running off on his own.  She's afraid of the bigger one being stronger than she is.  (He is!  He's close to being stronger than me, but not quite.  It's real close.  I have to use both arms and all my weight if he sees another dog he really wants to get at when walking him.  If he catches me by surprise, I'm a goner!.  I bought a head collar at Petsmart which I only use when walking him.  That fixed that problem.)  And they KNOW we're watching either because they see us or we call them back as soon as they go a little where they shouldn't.    Its never happened again.|`|C1eHfhrHaa	crate train him.  it worked wonders with our DDBs (French Mastiffs)|`|d4cf52959f97cc6ef63e1ad730f1436caa	He really does need to be caged when you are out or he will wreck your home and belongings.

Also, you may want to practice a few times leaving out for a minute or two, and try catching him in the act, to remind him, it's NOT ok to chew up everything!|`|8eSbCrQraa	Unfortunately 9 months old chew as they get bored very quick.  They are still too young to entertain themselves so if left alone, it makes sense they'll try to occupy their time.      I understand how hard it is to find crate.  You'll need a giant breed crate (54 inches).  We found both of ours on cragislist, but if there isnt anything in your area try dog.com.  You could also get a 24x36 pet pen and set it up so he only has that area and cant wander anywhere.

The tank is not tall enough for angels though, IMO.
4O3pzALiaa	guppies are born to breed! you will have absolutely no problem having them mate.your guppy will give birth every month so be ready for 20-100 baby fish every month, depending on how many pregnancys she has had in the past... keep in mind though that you should have 2-3 females for every male, for both the platties and guppies.  this way the females will not constantly be stressed due to the male always harassing them..    make sure you have a gallon of water per fish, a heater set between 75- 80, plants and floating plants for them to hide in.    both these fish give live birth and will most likely eat there young,. so get a breeding net for your tank, or a seperate tank to raise the fry in,     good luck|`|kXhubX0Laa	Along with what mizzmarcy said you also want younger males because they are more virile and show more interest in mating.|`|mrQKfR1faa	put a male and a female in.. get a heater.... and they'll do it from there.
Bw18seFqaa	She is probably going thru teenage acne.    Feed  high quality food.. no corn, grans, gluten, colors, by-products, artificial preservatives, etc.    Keep clothing and bedding clean.    Use either a gentle facial cleanser, or moisturizing pet shampoo.. use a lotion that doesnt clog pores (eucerine,curel, etc)  You can also use olive oil to moisturize the skin... after a bath apply the oil to the skin and wrap the dog in a towel for 10-15 mins while the skin absorbs it.    if she has dry skin you can also use a sugar scrub to help exfoliate the skin.    Since its more likely "teenage" acne, your best bet is to keep the skin clean and moisturized.  If things dont improove as she matures, then you can consider trying some facials and other shampoos.  Some of the facial masks and shampoos can be drying to the skin, which is why I prefer not to try them at first.    Some other things you can also try..  make a mixture of yogurt and honey, and apply to the skin, I beleive its about 1 cup yogurt and one tablespoon honey.. put on the skin, leave on for 10 mins, then wash off.  Some people have had luck with this.    Also another suggestion is "listerhazel"  Mix 50/50 witchazel, which is a natural astrigent to the original brown listerine (the flavored kinds will make the skin sticky).. some people swear by this.. I havent had much luck using this on my Crested, but I find its great to freshen his skin between baths.. I put some in a spray bottle and spritz it on his skin.    It will take some trial and error to find what works best for her skin..  dont pick tho, you will just irritate the skin more, which can make it worse.      Also join us at www.crestedsrock.com  you may find some more ideas on skin care.      ADDED  I dont reccommend antibiotics for blackheads..  I can maybe see for severe acne cases, skin that just wont heal or improove despite regular grooming, good diet, etc.. but not for blackheads.    Check around to petshops and feed stores.

Are you sure they are blackheads? They could be beauty marks, or just how your dogs skin is.  The safest way to control this problem is to call your vet, or bring her for a checkup.

It's also the easiest, most harmless, best way, to control this situation in a non chemical way.

2Ku4DuvCaa	HAH!<br>  <br>  Yes, parrots do masturbate. So long as his vent doesn't seem to be inflamed or otherwise irritated, I wouldn't worry about it too much. It's just something that they do.<br>  <br>  The only reason I could think of to take it away is if he starts to become ridiculously protective of it or even aggressive toward anyone who comes near his cage as a result. Beyond that, if it's not doing any harm then he can keep it.<br>  <br>  I've run into this a number of times. It's rarely problematic.
