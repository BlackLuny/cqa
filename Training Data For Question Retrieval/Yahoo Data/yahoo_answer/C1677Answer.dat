4dfbcf738541ddcd8d3291d2dbbb44deaa	Sora means 'sky' I believe. I don't think you can change your name in Japan unless you actually live there. Unless you're Japanese, it would be out of place.|`|Q3RqWHFsaa	Changing your original first name into some Japanese one or anything different from your original one is not accepted by Japanese government officially even if you get the citizenship.    All you can do instead is some phonetic equivalental first name and/or last name in Japanese language if you wish, which looks very awkward sometimes though.    Sora is not any popular name for humanbeing but name meaning bluesky in Japanese.|`|3ljf1xLlaa	A white person with a Japanese name. Haha.|`|LoXvNBEmaa	well you can have people call you whatever you want them to call you. tehre's no official way to go about it.  so while you are in japan, just tell people to call you the name you'd prefer. (i don't know why you wouldn't want  your real name though)    sora can be a name for a girl but i have never heard it.|`|23vKOyBraa	"Adopt" - yes, you can ask people to call you anything you please.    "Officially change" - not while you're in Japan (although your embassy might be able to help if you had a genuine reason??? Unlikely though).     But, once you've gone back home, most countries that I know of allow you to officially change your name. Of course, if you're in an English-language type country (as opposed to China, Korea - the writing styles I'm talking about) you would have to write your Kanji name in Romaji in order to change it. You could then reapply for a passport with your new name - but again, you cannot use Kanji unless you are Chinese etc.|`|XkAfnCoDaa	I'm Japanese    Some of names are used between Japan and U.S.    For example  Erica  Maria  Naomi   Marina   etc...|`|vS80xcoHaa	Yes, you can. Probably the most famous recent example is Arudou Debito, formerly David Christopher Aldwinckle, born 1965 in the United States, Permanent Resident of Japan from 1996, and naturalized Japanese citizen from 2000.     Here are the details from his website:     If you take out Japanese citizenship, you are obligated (but not required) to take a Japanese-sounding name. Most do. It can be in kanji with Japanese readings (as in perennial upper house candidate Tsurunen Marutei), katakana (as in the last name of soccer player Ramosu Rui), roman initials (as in naturalist C.W. Nikouru), or even romaji (as in former sumo wrestler Konishiki--who has it rendered that way on TV, although I don't know how it looks on his koseki), but it should fit into kana reading paradigms.|`|eAMbWkahaa	Legally speaking to use Kanji officially you'd have to be Japanese.    Any foreigner can have a Japanese name/Japanese sounding name, it would just be written in Katakana.    For example there are many Americans with Japanese ancestory, but since they are Americans now and not Japanese, their Japanese sounding names would still be written in Katakana.  For example, Shinseki the new secretary of veteran's affairs, his name in Japanese would be written in Katakana.|`|zuCWisD5aa	My best friends name is Kira...but that is a common name in the USA|`|USaK4A7Oaa	Of course, you can tell people to call you whatever you want.  Of course, if you're foreign, your official name in the Japanese government's eyes will always be exactly what is written on your passport.  Of course, you won't be able to get any valid ID with anything other than your legal name.  Of course, you can change your legal name in your country of citizenship before moving to Japan.  Of course, if you someday got Japanese citizenship, you could then change your name there (it used to be mandatory; these days it's optional).    The only Sora I know is porn star Sora Aoi.|`|4NxXKJBjaa	You can register a legal alias (tsuushoume - ) if you are a foreign japanese resident.  Just involves a quick trip to the ward/city office and one form, no cost if I recall.    I have one for the katakana form of my name (which is not the "standard" rendering of my name in katakana but is phonetically closer to its pronunciation).  It actually goes on the front of my gaikokujin torokushou right under the passport spelling (first time it will go on the back but will appear on front when you renew).

aMZ7IKysaa	Hello, I am in Norway, not Sweden, but Scandinavian countries share alot of the same markets.  I can recommend Spar/Eurospar and Coop.  Both are great :)    Ps: I am American, and I can tell you firsthand that you will NOT find alot of products we are accustomed to.  A great low cost brand is called First Price, and I highly recommend it.  Coop is your best bet for finding American brands, but like I said don't count on alot of them.  Those you do find will be very overpriced, and it is cheaper to order then on Ebay. Just a tip!|`|XZlFLecLaa	ALDI

0ed3a47409dac89fe63086d50549f520aa	Every country has good and bad hotels, but my favorites are:  The Witchery - Edinburgh http://www.thewitchery.com/accom.html  Hotel Fox (look at the rooms!) - Copenhagen http://www.hotelfox.dk/  Ice Hotel - northern Sweden http://www.icehotel.com/    Best food depends on what you like. Scandinavia tends to have great seafood, the Netherlands has great sweets and cheese, France/Belgium/Switzerland are well-known for top restaurants, and anywhere along the Mediterranean tends to be great, especially lesser visited countries like Croatia. And if you like deep-fried food, nowhere beats Scotland :P    I think Poland and its surrounding countries are really interesting culturally, but it depends what you are into.     Weather depends on what you like, too. My vote for best weather goes to the Canary Islands.|`|tgMIvZepaa	I went to Europe a few years ago and fount that Norway was the best. It is expensive there though.|`|8uveOLcraa	New Jersey|`|PV5f9PRIaa	best food well italy or france for sure.

Best food- Italy    Best culture- Spain, Italy, France and probably Greece but I've never been to Greece so that is just a guess.|`|tQsxsuNPaa	Most people would probably say France, but I'd say it depends on what you enjoy most.

f696776b941b55b420115b639c09c57aaa	1. North Beach, Noe Valley, Fillmore.    2. Lots of great bars.  Rumor is that there is one bar for every 95 people in SF so you are sure to find some you like.  My favorites are Lefty O'douls on Geary at Powell, Marlena's on Hayes at Laguna, The Mix on 18th at Castro, and Tommy's Joint on Van Ness at Geary.    3. Public transporation is very good despite the almost constant bad mouthing locals do about it.  You don't have to own a car.    4. Must sees, Golden Gate Park, Golden Gate Bridge, Coit Tower, Alcatraz.|`|quTKsQPhaa	I live in the bay area, so I cannot tell you what I think are good neighborhoods in the city. Nor do I go out in the city...But there are def. tons of dive bars there!!! Public transporation is pretty good. There are buses and trains that will get you around the bay area. BART is nice if you want to leave the city and go to one of the surrounding cities. For a first time visitor, there are so many things to do! Fishermans Wharf/Pier 39 is a must see. There are  many great restaurants and shops there!! I love Baker Beach, it's got great views of the GG Bridge(On a clear day). It's fun to drive across the bridge...Or walk, I haven't done that yet...Ocean Beach is great. You can see for miles(On a clear day). Lombard St. is fun to see/walk down. Coit tower has great views of the city. I'd suggest doing this on a weekday because it gets super crowded during the weekends! Also, Twin Peaks is absolutely amazing. It is the highest point in SF and you can see forever! It's beautiful up there on a clear night!    *I just saw your edit..I do not eat seafood either. I'm not allergic, just don't like it! I never have a problem getting a great chicken meal or pasta! This city is GREAT for amazing food!!! Trust me! It seems like all the restaurants are based on seafood, but most actually make great meals without seafood!|`|83vhCGW1aa	San Francisco    1) my sister lived out by the huge lake in Oakland.  Its a great place for a walk, and it isn't far from Trader Joe's a great grocery store, It's a short drive to some good bars & restaurants.    2) There are some great bars in the city.  There's one Belgian bar that comes to mind. They have Duvel on tap, and serve pomme frites. (Which is Belgian for french fries, but these ones taste like they do in Beligium, which is way better than here and I know that because I lived there for 2.5 years. (Thats where they are from incidentally, not France.)    3) You can take the BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) to tons of places & its cheap.    4) I'd say you have to see the golden gate bridge.  If you're up for a bit of a drive, you should spend about a week hiking around Yosemite too.   Its a national treasure, and you can hike all day there and not see anyone.  There are great waterfalls, peaks, high plains, and tons of creatures & beautiful wildlife.  If you are a coin buff, or just really like money, you should check out the San Francisco mint as well.    Boston is fun & there are starbucks everywhere, but its too cold, and I prefer San Francisco's Jamba Juices everywhere.  They are just as expensive as starbucks, but better tasting, healthier, and have bigger cups.    It rains roughly 70 % of the days in Seattle.  It is the rainiest city in the nation.  I prefer the sun & all year spring of San Francisco.    If you do decide you want to buy a house in San Francisco,  check out Taylor Morrison.  They sell houses in the area and have a free $25,000 sweepstakes on their site.
FUD331TJaa	People who move trains are called train operators. I was one for a short time operating NYC subways. It's not called driving because you don't steer the train, it always follows the tracks. The only turns are when the track turns or you pass over a switch that it is in the open position and it diverts you onto the diverging route.    Going is easy. There is a controller that send a signal to all rthe motors in the train to take power at one of three levels. When you are going fast enough you cut the power and coast.    Stopping is an art. You have to consider the kind of grade that the whole train is on, it is two blocks long and any grade in that span will affect operation. To stop you have a hand operated air brake which you can apply in increasing strength. You must get the train to stop within a small zone, often just a couple of feet long. That the operators do this 99%+ of the time is a credit to their profession.    MTA commuter trains work similarly.|`|f8aa8e21997cfa7908574dfa12f124cdaa	My friend, it take training and lots of it. You have to know the route very well, as well as, know what speed you have travel on the line. You also have to know and following railroad regulations. Remember, the lives of passenger are in your hands when you're operating an MTA commuter train.    In regard to steering, a train does not steer like a car or bus will do. It runs on rail that it has to follow at all times. If a train need to switch lines, there are switching points where the train will switch from rail line to the other.    I hope this information is very helpful.    Good luck
f3f09dd5dab69f7e644b37c4cf98a3abaa	You will have to look at the options - if you want to sleep on the ship and have a different island every day - than search that way - there isn't one area that has that option any more or less than the other.     Hardly see teens when I've cruised - but then I'm not looking for them.|`|e87d9d696031ff74cbe850d5cecbaaa2aa	They're all great. Depends on where you want to leave from. I had good luck at SpinCityTravel.com. You can compare all the cruises by amenities and customer feedback.|`|Eg0wsP4saa	Depends on what you're looking for. No matter where you go on your Caribbean cruise, you will get rain. It may last half the day (usually only typical in the Summer months), or it will be raining one minute, and it will be sunny the next. The Winter is typically the driest months, meaning hurricane and monsoon season has passed, so you may have little stints of rain here and there, but usually no longer than 20-30 minutes.     The Western Caribbean you have Mayan ruins, rain forests, and waterfalls. Some spots have a lot of outside influence, and some spots remain mostly unspoiled by tourism. Weather in the Winter time for this region is usually in the mid-70s, and by far, rains the most out of any other region. Humidity is also high, ranging from high 70 to 80 percent. Water is warm and nice to swim in.    The Eastern Caribbean you have beaches, and really not much more than that. However, it is the most laid-back option out of all the cruises in the Caribbean. If you're looking to relax, then this might be a better choice. Weather for this region is typically the coolest, meaning low to mid-70s, but it typically is the driest region, as well. Water is warm enough to swim in all-year round. Humidity is around 60-70 percent.    The Southern Caribbean you really have a combination of both. Some spots remain untouched by tourism, and some spots have combined outside influences with it's culture. Some islands are known for their beaches and shopping, while some are known for rain forests and a more exotic feel. This one is the most fast-paced out of all of them, and you'll probably have more islands to visit in a 7-day cruise. You may also have the sunniest climate on this cruise. Weather for this region is typically the warmest, ranging from high-70s to low-80s. Rain is common, but it rarely ever pours in the Winter seasons. Humidity is high, ranging at times from 70 to 80 percent. Water is warm enough to swim in all year round.    Personally, if you're looking for a variety of everything, the most activity, and typically the warmest and sunniest weather, the Southern Caribbean is the way to go... But you will enjoy any one of the regions.|`|cb1c8e5fcd8492bc3787fd1b614481ecaa	I have been on all. The Southern and Eastern that I went on were combined. Western was separate. There is something unique about each and there is no best. The Southern may give the Panama Canal. My trip went half way through and turned around in Gatun Lake. Western gives Mexico.

tp61e25Eaa	The place where you have felt the most love in your entire life. It is a place that can exist anywhere when the memory of that love comes to you. You could be about to be executed, and that love will take you away. So for me its more of a "State" of mind than a place. Somewhere in the country would be best as far as geographic locations though.|`|AA10097817	Probably the top of any mountain.

FaMAaWYtaa	I agree and disagree.  First of all, every country has its flaws and benefits  For the most part people are drawn to what they know.    Bad things about living in Britain:  -No root beer!  -No plugs in bathroom, YES, this is very weird, how am I supposed to curl my hair in front of the mirror?  -Drunk ladettes and teenagers stumbling down the street at 3 in the morning  -Drinking culture in general is very unhealthy- I like a drink and all, but there is so much binge drinking here  -Food is very unhealthy and there's a lack of available varied salads, sushi, fresh organic stuff (hey, the American midwest is the same way!).  I mean, it is available, but not on the same variety and scale and low cost that it is back home.  -Cost of living... wow  -housing is expensive and outdated  -tons of women with orange fake tans and bleached hair (this is probably more my neighborhood than anywhere, but it's still awful)  -the coffee sucks.  Hard.    -People that have been to one part of the States, probably NYC or Florida, for less than a year and feel entitled to make sweeping statements about the US.. it's HUGE, people!  I'm a born and raised american and even I can't make generalizations about it.  There are great parts, terrible parts, completely different cultures.... whcih is why I'll say you can't say " X country is better than Y country"  Things that I love about living here  -Trains that people actually use! They're great  -sweets are awesome  -fish and chips, cmon  -The NHS.  Without insurance, in the US you are really screwed for health care.    -Old and historic buildings.  Thousand year old churches and walls. Incredibly ancient preserved history. You just don't get that back home.  -Free museums  -Boots (the store)  -No SUVs  -No school shootings or drive-bys (ok, there are stabbings, but still)  -dry, witty sense of humor  -Most people have been friendly.  They haven't exactly invited me into their homes but they are polite and warm enough.  There have been some incidents of anti-Americanism but hey, every country has jerks.    What's my point?  There are jerks and there are nice people anywhere you go.  Bureacracy can seem daunting if you're not used to it but that doesn't make it any more ridiculous than the bureaucracy back home.  Why will I return to the US?  Same reasons as a Brit would go back home- I miss family, friends and familiarity.|`|b8tgCAQJaa	If you hate the UK so much why did you come over here to live with a British citizen?    Have you taken a time machine back to 1909 or something? Strong cleaners and antibacterial soap are available in all major supermarkets.    Screens on windows and plugs - what are you talking about? And disease?! This isn't Nigeria for heaven's sake.    The NHS has its flaws, but it's available free of charge to ALL UK citizens, not just those who can afford health care insurance. It's better than the health care available to the poorest people in the USA (have you seen Michael Moore's SICKO?) Nearly 50 million Americans have no health insurance at all.    Douching is not medically necessary unless you have a vaginal infection or something. The human body is to a large extent self-cleansing, companies in the USA are expert at selling people products they don't actually need.    The majority of Brits do not hate Americans. This is all about YOU, not Americans in general. If you exhibit the kind of attitude in real life that you do in this rant, it's not surprising if people are prejudiced against you.    No electrical plugs in the bathroom? There are advantages and disadvantages to the UK and US electrical wiring methods for homes, one of the disadvantages of ours is that we can't safely have standard outlets in our bathrooms. You risk having 30 amps of current running through your body should you drop your shaver or hair dryer into the bath.    Yes, our houses are smaller and there are fewer places to park in our cities. This is the price you pay for living on a small highly populated island. If you go to Manhattan in the USA (also a small, highly populated island!) you'll find small apartments, and a lack of free parking too.    TV licensing is a whole other argument. The "free" TV stations you get in the USA, though, are diabolical compared even to ours. Commercials every 3 minutes? Give me the BBC any day.    ALL COUNTRIES including the USA charge import duty on items you get sent from other countries. It's not just the UK.    Yes, some things are more expensive here but stunting your child's growth? Hurting you mentally and physically? That's a ridiculous exaggeration.    Regarding credit ratings and "not existing in the system", etc. - exactly the same problem exists for British and other foreign citizens who go to live in the USA.    The UK isn't perfect, but come on! Be reasonable! It actually sounds as though you have serious personal issues which have nothing to do with the country you're living in.|`|xp4mhkqgaa	You're not forced to live here, so if you don't like it, go back to your good ol' USA, where's everything's so much bigger and better, lol.      If you really must do your hair and makeup in the bathroom, then why not use an extension cable?  I don't really see what difference it makes, doing your hair in the bedroom, or any other room, and why it has to be done in the bathroom.      And, if you want better healthcare, it is available.  If you find the NHS so crap, then go private.    Anyone that I've known from the US, or any other country, who stays here in Glasgow, have never been treated badly because of where they come from.  So, maybe instead of faking an accent, try looking at your attitude as that's maybe why people treat you the way they do.      If you want a huge house, then buy one.  All houses here don't just have 2 levels.  You could buy a mansion or a castle if you wanted.    If you want to be able to cash cheques which are made out to your husband, then would you not be able to do this if you had a joint bank account?    I can't be bothered reading the rest of your rant, it's far too long.  But, to answer your question, one of the main reasons that I love living in Scotland is because of the people.  Most of us are down to earth, friendly, have a great sense of humour, we don't whinge about silly things such as not having a plug socket in the bathroom.  I'm much more interested in enjoying my life, making the most of it, and having a laugh, rather than worrying about trivial things.      Some people are forced to live in a country where they have no food, or no water, so maybe if you changed your attitude a bit and started looking at the positives of living in the UK (and there's loads) you will probably find that it's a lot easier to cope with, and you may even enjoy living here.|`|0Ei3ePJzaa	I have answered this question, but it wouldn't let me paste so please go to the link to see my answer, which I will paste shortly:  http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/?qi...|`|y39iNwFjaa	I love it here and have spent 12 months living in USA too so it may well be that one is always happiest with what one knows and loves.

Repatriated a year ago after 22 years in the UK.  I took my Englishman and my daughter born on british soil with me.  I was happier in the UK because there is the freedom to be yourself.     The system fails everywhere ... just in different ways.  The 20-year old that stabbed those babies in Belgium should have been sectioned but his GP blocked it.   I need to have a certificate that i master the language of the country i was born in to get social housing.   So does my mother.  She is 66!   The waiting list is 10 years minimuum.  If we ever get it being on an average (below 25K) income.    I was happier in the UK.  My partner was happier in the UK.  My 5.5 year old says she misses her friends and if it wasn't for the fact she is doing so well in school we wouldn't be staying.    Belgians take themselves so terribly serious.

Only reason i ever used my passport was for holidays.|`|CB15kchkaa	Well you're comparing your American life with british life, and you are wrong about most things you said. For one, if you're a woman and have a gp you will get constant reminders to go for your smear test.  Now you are the first erson I ever heard call Britain a third world country. The Uk is the most advanced European country, mentality wise. God knows what part of the UK you live in, but it sounds dismal where you are but then again I will be honest, you yourself sound dismal. Ithink to be honest with you, it's you that has the problem, not the UK. Yes it's an expensive country but it's also full of opportunity. Many who live ther just don't see it. But let them go anywhere else in europe and after one year at the most they will be crying for their own country. The USA certainly has different standards housing wise, and it may be hard to adapt but most of your comments are rather unfair.   Your comments about getting on your husbands bank account are nonsense as well, if you're in the UK, married, then you must have a passport and a marriage certificate, and a visa. Your id is your passport and your home office doccuments of legality,and your marriage certificate. The more I read, the more I doubt your mentality, on the one hand you could raise enough credit to buy a house in the USA, and on the other you're broke.  Personally I think you're talking rubbish.|`|irljnVkAaa	All countries have problems, if you dont like it, then leave. If you don't want to leave, shut up about it. You are wrong about most of the things you mentioned and if you think that the USA is a better place to live than the UK, you are deluded. I would chew my own arms off not to live there.|`|6SB4ufEYaa	I agree 100% with everything you've said.    This is not a good country anymore. It's not somewhere i will ever raise my future children.    You need to figure out a way to get your kids out this country. They will suffer if they are kept here.  Why does your husband not want to?  What's keeping him here? Have you discussed all of this?    If you figure out a way to go, please take me with you! I'll be your aupair! I'll work for free.. seriously. I can't stand it here.|`|oOR511mFaa	Try to convince your husband to move home.     brother_in_magic I don't remember one house i have ever lived in my whole life that did not have screens on the window. I doubt you have ever been to the US and i doubt you know any Americans because if you did, you would know that this is standard.|`|UzPFTdUFaa	Thats is quite a rant. I agree with you about health care. I have been ill for 9 months and both NHS and private health care are generally chronically awful. Also much of the education system is shocking, producing a generation of shallow, semi illiterate over materialistic young people. As for power points; electricity and bathrooms don't mix  and are a fire risk. As for the many plus points of living in Britain: Beautiful countryside encompassing so many different kinds of gorgeous landscape; the TV license which for a little over 2.50 per person per week gives us 4 BBC television channels with lots of undemanding quality entertainment plus brilliant wildlife programmes, news and coverage of the arts; ditto BBC  Radio 3,4 and 5. A transport system where virtually the whole country has frequent bus and rail services unlike the U.S.. Many of the most negative aspects of British lilife and culture stem from the too powerful influence of the U.S., such as the Euro phobia perpetrated by American owned newspapers and our savage involvement in America's foreign policy excursions into Iraq etc. And, by the way I am not anti American as regards the American people who are warm, cultured and generous of spirit.|`|L4z1FI5Kaa	Oh dear!

I'm not rich so I hate it here.|`|P4SgSnVlaa	I remember you asking this question a few days ago, but it was deleted just as I spent 20 mins preparing my rant back... So, I'll try again...    First off, you have no idea how much of a spoilt/over-protected baffoon you sound like. Also quite blind because a lot of the things you rant about 'us' not having, we in fact do.    Bugs in the house? Everyone gets bugs in their house, it cannot be be stopped however much you'll want to wrap everything in cotton wool. It'll only become something stupid if your house is that dirty to attract too many. You say your cleaning products don't clean? Well everything I've used so far has done the trick, try out different products. Antibacterial soap in only one store? I seriously doubt that...    Plugs in the bathroom? Tbh, that's the stupidest idea I've heard in a while. Sure, it's helpful.. But, to have electrics in a room which has a purpose of you sitting in a tub full of water in.. I'm sure you studied science in high school. If you want a brighter room to do your hair/make-up in... buy a lamp for goodness sake! But as you say, if you want to die standing by it.. be my guest. You're just proving your own stupidity.    I agree with you on the state of our health services though. But, how can you slate a country so much, when your own is in a worse state than this one? It is - by a colossel mile - more corrupt, more in debt and some may think more de-moralised.    Complaining about house prices/sizes? Yes, it's expensive.. but that's what you get for living in a high-populated (small) and rich country. Simple.    ID cards? I'm not sure about ID cards for people not born in the UK, but most definitely we have them. Several different kinds...    Why on earth would you want to buy a house on a credit card anyway?? If they actually allow those sort of actions in the US, I'm not surprised of the current economy crises...    As for the stereotype that all English hate Americans? Absolute stupidity. It is true that some people are idiotic enough to believe in all generalisations (but you can find people as such from every country, thank you very much), and actually they usually dislike Americans because of the arrogance and ignorance they seem to have towards anything that's not 'American' (sound familiar?).          Edit: Thank you Nathan, feel free to copy and paste this if you wish ;)   SW - Myself I cannot say which country has the best health care system, since I've not yet been in even half the countries around the world, let alone try out the health cares. Brag all you like about your great health care, but that still doesn't hide the fact that you're ranting and complaining about all the 'bad' things in this country. You went to such a degree you began to nitpick and then even went as far as telling things that weren't even true. Also, there are actually many incidents of domestic accidents. It doesn't matter if you're 'adult enough' or not, accidents are accidents. You don't have to be a retard to knock over a drink or something off a shelf, no?      As for Americans being treated badly here, I do not know where you currently live but this is the first I've ever heard of an American being treated badly enough to being hated. I've read many questions/answers on this site written by Americans saying how much they love it here, how friendly the people are. I know of Americans living in the town I live in loving the life here. I'm sorry if you're being treated so badly, but don't generalise an entire country to such a thing.    Also, I never thought you were suggesting myself as a retard. I actually never read anything that seemed hypothetical either, just seemed like another rant to me.        Oh and -temtem-, girls magazines? We have dozens!|`|f419df7a7a06e14dfdf6ab874c949c5baa	Jesus Christ, what negativity!  I hope your not raising your kids with this.  nagging all day.    you are living in the UK, so you had better get used to it.  If it doesn't suit you, get over it, stop living in the past and get real.    a bloody plug in your bathroom... this is what is boils down to!  and what for?     yes it's smaller over here, and thank heavens, it is. you don't need a basement, 15 floors, and an attic. how are you going to heat all that, and why with only 4 people.    you need to grow up. no body wants to hear this rant.    ultimately you are being disrespectful. you are living in the UK, so you should respect the way the British live.|`|40cb05167045a1f46df282f984b699d4aa	You're lucky you live in the U.K.  I want to move there very badly.   It's a gorgeous country and everyone seems so friendly.  Plus, there seems to be much opportunity and lots of interesting things about the place.   So what if you don't have a plug in your bathroom?  there are kids in China who don't have food to eat.  Be thankful for what you have.  And enjoy the beauty of the country you're residing in, you're the envy of many people.    But I have to agree with you, the whole situation with having to wait that long for medical help is ridiculous. Something horrid could have happened.    I am an artist and was raised on arts and crafts, and I think without them, I wouldn't be the same person I am today. Arts and crafts are crucial to a kid's creative growth. And I would hate to not be able to afford those things.  So I have sympathy for you there.    And also you shouldn't have to pay a TV tax, especially when you're already paying for channels.  And paying for things at a library?  that's nuts.    But I still envy you, because I would love Love LOVE to be living in the UK right now.    I hope everything works out for you and your family.  :)|`|9ZQnd2rmaa	Spiders and flies are natural and have been with us since the dawn of time. I actually don't know anyone in Canada or the US,let alone the UK, who puts screens on the window, save maybe in places with very warm weather combined with water (say new Orleans).It sounds a bit like you are suffering somewhat from OCD of some sort.   the rant about power plugs was silly. Of course you shouldn't expect plugs to be the same in another country. That's just narrow and insular.Hardly important in the main scheme of things, is it?   that's why I think you have your priorities skewed.     Btw, I came from Canada and would never move back now. I also had the chance to live in the USA but would have never taken it. I have never felt so unsafe as in parts of the USA.   As for the US health care--yeah, best if you can afford it.I remember my American  friend phoning in tears because her mother, with a chronic,serious heart condition, could not afford further treatment/medication when her dad was made unemployed. If you don't want to wait 6 weeks to see a specialists  in the UK, get PRIVATE HEALTH CARE. You're USED to paying for it in the US,so why don't you do it here?     I'm afraid the reason people don't like you isn't because you're American, it's your attitude,plain and simple. You are making yourself look like the sterotypical 'ugly American', the type who rants and screams if everything,everywhere isn't exactly the same as in the USA.     I think you should return to the US as soon as possible. To be fair, moving abroad is not for everyone and is very stressful at the beginning.|`|TeQ4RwlRaa	I dont really agree 100% percent with what SW said but she's got a point.  really.  Just people here wont accept it.    I find that after being here almost a year  I dont hate foods  I dont really hate weather like most of my friends do.    But it's funny how people here tolerate with nonsense things  ..like SW said.    there're also many ridiculous rules of many things  to protect whatever a person with anxiety can think of.  I think people here are over-protected.  They let government or whatever think for them-  You need permission in most of things  umm I couldnt write them all    lets say they have too much of what they dont necessarily need  and lack of lots of what they really should have    And does this make people here great?  In the past maybe yes, but what I saw here nowadays..  tonnes of yobs and chavs    I also find lots of people lacks of imagination  maybe the result of not having freedom to think and act somehow  It's a shame because I thought uk is a great place, great source  with such a long history.    Another thing I'd like to add  what you're missing, one thing I find it's important  they dont have many things for teenagers here.  Not even a magazine  I used to read cosmo girl /teen or seventeen  and also tv programs   just something to show there's so much more to do   than getting dress and get drunk.  (I like Seventeen personally-there's always inspirational stories)  Funny- you got many children stuff- then adult stuff  such a gap..    edit: I like what Emma said- that's sweet.  hope you'll have good experience coming here- really hope :)|`|zoH6rMCPaa	I zoned out after about the third line. You need to condense your rant/ramblings down if you want anyone to even consider reading it.    Anyway, to answer your question, I am very happy living in the UK and think it is a wonderful place to live.    If you don't like it - that's your problem, if you are going to come and live somewhere, you do the smart thing and research it first, then live there for a few months on a holiday visa to ensure that it is definitely for you.

Politeness and good Japanese speaking skills from foreigners are highly impressive for native Japanese people. Remove shoes before entering any house or private property, and don't act really loud or people will stare at you lol.  Don't blow your nose in public. Ino, weird, but it's really offensive and gross to them.   Always try to use the polite form of words and phrases.     The Japanese people are quite forgiving, especially for foreigners like you and I.   Don't worry, really.     Have fun studying in Japan.

Jm3vMKx3aa	If you drive on a U.S. highway (speed-limit 55mp/h) at a speed of 60mp/h and you don't gt a fine because the highway patrol tolerates it is is than legal to drive at a speed of 60mp/h? No it is not, it is just tolerated.  The same applies to consumption of marijuana in Amsterdam. It is not legal but it is tolerated if the stuff is consumed in so called coffeshops and it is sold in only those amounts to be considered as being for personal use.  Based on this tolerance policy the Netherlands is one of the European countries which citizens are less dependent on drugs than citizens of any other countries. Juveniles are upon doing forbidden things. Doing tolerated ones is not interesting. I can imagine that more US juveniles are trying to get alcoholic beverages than Durch ones are trying to get a smoke.  To repeat it for the 500000 times on Y!A, it is not legal it is just tolerated under certain circumstances.

You can buy a three day tourist pass at the airport which includes round trip to and from the airport and unlimited rides on the MTR and some other forms of transportation for $300HKD, you'll also get a $50HKD refund when you return the card at the airport when you leave, it's a great deal if you plan on using the MTR to get around.  http://www.mtr.com.hk/eng/airport_expres...  http://www.mtr.com.hk/eng/airport_expres...|`|7a09f0a1575a6fb3adae34957ca25a7caa	There are no direct bus from Airport to Metropark Kowloon but to Metropark Mongkok rather. If you want, the cheapest way is to take A21 to Argyle Ctr, Nathan Rd near Mong Kok MTR Stn and walk from there or take a taxi to the hotel for HK$16 (luggage may charge extra if you have many or have large size). A21 cost you HK$33 and alight at the stop after Lai Chi Kok Rd the 1st stop after turning into Nathan Rd. If you do not have much luggage, then you can take E21 from Ground Transportation Ctr to before Fa Yuen St, Mongkok Rd and walk or take a taxi for HK$16, which is cheaper than the above. E21 cost you HK$14 and 23 stops apart. If you get an Octopus card, then you can get a free transfer to E21A at Lantau Toll Plaza, which can bring you directly to the hotel bus stop located just opposite the hotel. Or transfer at before Fa Yuen St, Mongkok Rd and take 3 stops to get to Man Kee Mansion, Waterloo Rd, the 2nd stop after turning into Waterloo Rd. The hotel is just opposite the stop and cost you HK$3.5.    This hotel is not near any MTR Stn but you can walk to Mongkok MTR Stn for Tsuen Wan line & Kwun Tong line, as well as Mongkok East stn for East Rail line. There is a shuttle bus available from hotel to TST so you can make use of. There are many shopping malls at TST and there is Grand Century Place is the largest shopping mall nearby at Mong Kok East Stn. The hotel provides free shuttle to Tsim Sha Tsui which you can make use of and there is a MTR Station called Tsim Sha Tsui which you can take to Hong Kong Island side, as well as New Territories, but Mong Kok Stn is better and Mong Kok East Stn is better for the Eastern part.|`|Lmw6dtQvaa	I took a bus from Kowloon.

THIS PAGE MAY HELP YOU  http://www.travelpunk.com/boards/asia/15...  It has the same question you asked. Many people have sent responses    Buses    If you're on a budget, there are plenty of buses that can take you wherever you need to go in Hong Kong. Buses between the airport and Central take around 45mins, with journey time to Kowloon around 30mins. Fares vary depending on which route, however the maximum you're likely to pay is $5. Buses during the day are frequent, upwards of every 10 mins, while night buses are generally every 30mins. Remember, buses don't give change, so try and bring the right amount where possible.    Main Routes to Central (including Kowloon) A11, E11, N11 (night-bus)    Travel Time: 45mins  Cost: $5  Frequency: Every 10-30 minutes.    The Airport Express is the quickest route between the airport and Central Hong Kong; taking just 24 minutes- less to Kowloon. The train runs like clockwork at 12-minute intervals, from 05:50 - 00:48, daily. Tickets are priced at around $50 for a single and $100 for a return (valid for one month). Tickets must be purchased before getting on the train, with ticket vendors stationed at the entrances.    I'm not sure how many bags you have. but if you want to take the METRO (MTR) just take the Airport line (GREEN) to HONG KONG. Switch to the RED LINE. Get off at the TSIM SHA TSUI EXIT.

Basically, just save up enough money, find a place to live, and move over. You can also attend university in Europe at local costs, which is often tuition-free.    To be safe, you should have enough to cover 6 months living expenses. It can be difficult to find a job in many countries right now, so it's best you don't arrive and then run out of money when you don't get work in the first month. I've moved countries with just 1-month's saving before, but I don't recommend it. I lived in a tent until I found work :)    Cost of living depends on where you want to live. Major cities are usually very expensive, and rural areas not so much. If you are willing to live in shared housing, you can get by in most countries on less than 1000/month.    The best cities to live in are the ones where you speak the language, unless you have contacts for jobs or are going to be attending school. In most countries, you need to at least speak the basics of the local language to find any sort of work. If you want vibrant cities, look for capitals or places with large universities, where there will be many students. Students mean more things to do, better nightlife, and more openness towards foreigners. Berlin is a great "young" city.    If you speak French: France, Monaco, Belgium, Luxembourg, Switzerland (although they have different rules for moving).  If you speak only English, this pretty much limits you to UK and Ireland, although Malta also uses English.|`|94b8KImYaa	Choose your European country you want to live in.

Commit your way to the Lord; trust in Him...    that means if you have a personal relationship with the Lord, He will guide you to follow His will. that's the best path you can take!   consider your Heavenly Father when you make your descision, OK?|`|VCIZJQCJaa	what you need is something stimulating,interesting,and challenging without the running like you use to,where you can also keep an eye on the wild one.(hair color works wonders on those grays)lol.  how about writing a book,maybe about taking a stand on an interesting subject.advancement for women,how to encourage kids to stay in school,(look how far it got you)or an easy healthy recipe book for people on the go, etc.you would make an excellent guidance counselor(if pay isn't an issue) study violin classical piano or drums. go back to school and get a degree,or study a language you always wanted to try..that way you are out of the house,challenging your brain and socializing.plus you have deadlines.as i journalist,you know that's half the rush..... and part of the reason for depression is that you are not feeling the exhileration of adrenalin.but first of all go out and treat yourself to a make-over,spa day,and some new clothes.once you feel good,you can conquer anything.it doesn't matter what you do as long as it satisfies you....one more item -you have been through a lot personally,it takes time to heal.|`|IpQY6rVMaa	Out of all the jobs and things you have done what has given you the most satisfaction and enjoyment? That is what you should do.
SLFt8eHEaa	Unfortunately the thing with the British weather is that it can be unpredictable and one year is never the same as the next.  September/October is the very end of summer/beginning of autumn so temperatures can fluctuate, but it won't be very, very cold.  It certainly shouldn't be snowing.  I'd say as a very rough guide expect temperatures to be between about 14 and 21 degrees Celsius.  The best thing for you to do would be to bring layers with you, t-shirts in case it's warm in the day and then some sort of sweater you can throw on in case it gets cold.  It would probably be a good idea to bring a light jacket too as even if it is warm during the day the nights will be a little chilly by that point.|`|BnW5WPoXaa	The weather over here isn't too good, but I suppose its a change to Australia. It is not very likely that you would get snow, unless you go up north near the Scottish border, and I would say that the Cornwall area would be the warmest. However, London temperatures would probably range from around 9 degrees celsius to 14 degrees celsius at this time, and you are more than likely to get a fair share of rain. I would suggest packing warm clothing (e.g. trousers, short sleeved and long sleeved tops, fluffy socks, jackets) as the weather is quite unpredictable.    And finally, the season then is around.......AUTUMN!    Have a great time! :]|`|Bu4aTVAQaa	its autumn/nearly winter honestly you cannot predict this weather for example it snowed today for about half an hour and now its windy just bring warm clothes its better to be too warm  than too cold hope this helps :)|`|AA11530601	if you go to the north then it going to be pretty cold - around 5-10 degrees C.....if you go further south than about Sheffield then it will be a little warmer - around 8-15 degrees C. We generally have quite a lot of balmy summer evenings (i live in the East Midlands) but the weather isnt very warm although it may look a bit summery. It does vary from year to year though, some years its dosent really get cold (below 10 degrees C) until November (like this year). But compared to Aus you are gonna find it freezing! we find it cold and we live here!    It almost never snows at this time. It will be Autumn. And clothing should be jumpers, jeans, Tshirts, coats and poss scarves.|`|fT6VVji9aa	I went there in September and damn near died.  We went via Egypt where it was 40 deg c and straight to London.  We rushed out and bought scarves and gloves and a warm woolly hat and posted our summer stuff back to Oz, as it was only gonna get colder as we went on thru Europe.  Didn't snow though.  It will be Autumn then.
AA11159828	Castle Green (Just to the West and North of the Del Mar Metro station)  or Memorial Park (Raymond and Walnut)just west of Memorial station.|`|lzEuuseJaa	The cops don't like people hanging out in *private places* in Pasadena, especially Old Town. You'll likely get hassled. Central Park is full of homeless people day and night, Union Station Foundation homeless services is a block away. While most of the homeless are polite and careful not to bother anyone -- or the cops will chase them off -- many of them are homeless because they are mentally ill, and they tend to be territorial, so it's not a good idea to be hanging out in parks at night, especially if you're a teen. All the parks are the same, Memorial, Singer, etc.    Any place in the hills, you'll get neighbors calling (concern over fire hazards) or police patrolling. Most of Pasadena shuts down at 9pm. Walking around the Rose Bowl and golf course you wouldn't be alone, lots of walkers, but you can catch a bit of solitude and get some exercise. Central library is open until 9pm some nights. Laemmle theatre is often empty during the week. You wouldn't be alone at the Paseo, but some nights it might feel that way.|`|ac7e0f50f58632b431b5cf5de0564ffbaa	No place, really. Old Town is pretty busy. Maybe Central Park, but you'll probably find a bunch of homeless people there.|`|8VZeJ2KZaa	In Old Pasadena? There are no private places. Homeless people stay in both parks (where else would they go?)  but shouldn't bother you, and Castle Green is full of people who live there. Sorry.
0IeDvvlIaa	It's good you have a delivery confirmation, so you have some kind of tracking for the item.  Parcel Post is snail mail.  It has the lowest priority and goes out when there is space available.  Some times it is delivered quickly and other times it can take a month.  Ten days is not uncommon and it should be arriving soon, now that the holiday shipping season is over. Weather delays can also add to the delivery time, so if the city is snowed in and trucks and planes can not get out, the mail can't move either.|`|l1dAq3pOaa	Depends on what type of arrangements were made when it was shipped.  1st class. 2nd class, 3rd class, 4th class, and snail mail.  !st class is usually 2 to 3 days and 4th class can take a week of business days. Snail mail is a little longer.|`|AcWMpmPwaa	sounds to me like it hasn't shipped yet. try to find out the tracking number and go to the website to follow your shipment when they decide to ship. and if it's normal ground, it'll probably be all of six days with the way ups is moving packages right now.

Prices are still around the same as Best Buy and Amazon.com is still cheaper. I wont be going until I start seeing some 40 and 50% off deals.    When CompUSA closed they started with 10% 20% off discounts but they started raising it as the weeks went by. During the last week or two they where open you could find some things at 60 and 70% off.|`|m6GPTcTZaa	Well there bankrupt at this time so I'm pretty sure they'll be closing there doors soon if not already once that happens all there remaining inventory will be auctioned to closeout companies. So I don't think they'll be to hesitant to slash prices. They want to get as much money as they can before the doors close

Since you know how to type in English, you have no problem getting around in Singapore. Singaporean like me also speaks and write English like you do, so don't worry.|`|pm2EeEgiaa	Singapore.    Singapore is a lot more Western-friendly: the signs are all in English and virtually everyone can speak English.

LLq9uPi4aa	Also, Medford is not a big airport.  You might try a flight in to PDX and then a rental car or greyhound/amtrak to Medford- that might be cheaper.  I usually look at travelocity.com and hotwire,com, and they list the cheapest flights-- then go directly to the airline they list as being cheapest, and see if they have a better deal on their site.  Also, if you are traveling last minute, try lastminute.com.  They sometimes have really good deals, and sometimes the deal gets even cheaper when you add a car.|`|e87d9d696031ff74cbe850d5cecbaaa2aa	I had good luck on SpinCityTravel.com.

GQme709qaa	I don't know an exact guess but it is far less than 1%.    English isn't common at all there. In most countries, the people servicing the tourism industry (ie hotel clerks, etc) can all speak English.  It isn't common even in that industry in China.    BTW, the other poster is completely wrong.  While there is an awful lot of outsourcing of manufacturing jobs to China, there are virtually no telemarketing jobs there.  I think he is confusing China and India -- where quite a few call centers are located.    India was a British colony until 1947 so quite a few people learned to speak English and it is still commonly taught and spoken there.      China isolated itself from the outside world until the 1970s so there was little reason for schoolchildren to learn English.    Also I'd note that unlike French or Spanish, Mandarin Chinese contains no common ancestry with English.  You don't find words that remind you of similar English words like  biblioteca and bibliography.  They don't even share an alphabet.    Shanghai is an international cosmopolitan city...so it would be a lot easier than the rest of China, but China is one of the most difficult places for an English speaker to adjust to.|`|ZOqKYaxCaa	I don't think it will be difficult to live in Shanghai even who only know English.I live in Beijing,like Shanghai as big city in China.Every worker in shop or supermarket and hospital can speak English.There is not big difficulty on conversation.But for you can live more comfortable,you 'd better learn some basic Chinese.  Best wishes,hope you enjoy yourself in China.|`|a6JZjRG1aa	about 5%... 96% of foreigners and well-educated natives...|`|L4HURUQraa	Guess the percentage who speak English     Many signs (road signs and metro stations for examples) are written in Pinyin, which is simple for a non-Chinese speaker to read. Shanghai Daily and China Daily are English language newspapers, there are plenty of English language websites for events in Shanghai.   I've met expats who have lived here for a long time without learning much Chinese at all, so for some it is not that difficult.|`|QNqtthJ0aa	well considering all of the american jobs went there and other over seas countrys. everytime you you pick up the phone and call like a 1 800 number for product service chances are there in china. everytime a telemarketer calls too

ZPxJNpMxaa	In 1991 and 1992 the laws that governed apartheid and segregation in South Africa were all repealed, this was after the liberation movements, including the ANC were unbanned and Mandela released in 1990.    So during this period one can argue that apartheid ended as there were no laws in place to ensure it's continuance.    The first democratic elections, which afforded all South Africans over the age of 18 to vote for the first time, were held in 1994 and the ANC won the elections and Nelson Mandela was appointed as the first democratically elected President of South Africa in April 1994....many view this as the end of apartheid but technically it was 2 years earlier.|`|T42Nt3Lyaa	Apartheid was de-legislated between 1990 and 1992|`|LAEIHGBoaa	The process stated in 1988, but were repealed between 1990 and 1992.|`|K8CGXTLQaa	Its as saffa says. Its the other way round now. Blacks hating on whites.     However an interesting political party by the name of "COPE" has come to power in SA that stresses full economic empowerment as apposed to BLACK ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT which is racist. Our current administration is racist. There is no nice way of putting it. Racist a s s h o l e s.    ANC is a joke apart from abolishing AFB which was even more of a joke.    ANC is however really big in SA. So COPE will probably lose. Its a pity but that is the reality in South Africa. Black racists have seen an occasion to hate on whites. It is messing up our trade routes with other countries, but they don't care. All they care about is making dirty money.    And the racist whites don't make it any better.    What we need to do is stop with all this racist s h i t people!    PS 2 the OP.

VSxwb3oraa	My favorite place to go on vacation is Stockholm. It is very beautiful. It has a lot of islands. The river is so clean that you can see a lot of fish in it. Though it's very old capital, it is very well taken care of. Walking around the city is so easy. It is not so big. To my surprise, it is also very safe. Even if you walk alone, you will always feel secured since the people who live there are very polite and cultured. <br>  <br>  There is some area in Sweden which, in a few days in certain season, never have some sunsets.<br>  <br>  It's interesting when you see some days which never sleep.|`|MBR5mx2Taa	NEPAL: Mt.

blxlNHeCaa	Try looking at these websites for jobs:<br>  <br>  www.jobnet.dk<br>  www.ofir.dk<br>  www.jobindex.dk<br>  <br>  You can look all over Denmark. Its really hard to get a job when you do not speak Danish, but it's a little bit easier in places like Copenhagen, where there are more english speaking businesses. If you can't find anything online, then by all means get out there and go door to door at businesses and just ask people if they have any work they need done. A lot of jobs in denmark never make it to the paper or online because it's filled through friends of co-workers and so on. Make yourself seen and heard and make a lot of friends who can also keep an eye out for you. |`|X5hTmAkBaa	all i can think of is moonlighting thats what some exchange students from my class did. |`|xpepheNkaa	Hotels or restaurants would be a good place to go looking for jobs.

Adems, el 57% presenta una mayor sensibilidad en la cara.     Por otro lado, el 93% de los espa?oles se preocupa por que los productos de higiene personal no da?en el medio ambiente. De ah que los desodorantes en barra o crema sean los ms populares entre los ciudadanos. Estos formatos son los favoritos del 53%, frente al 48% que prefiere el aerosol, se?ala el estudio., la mayora de los varones espa?oles se lavan los dientes una media de dos veces diarias, sobre todo por la ma?ana, despus del desayuno y por la noche, antes de irse a dormir, costumbre que comparten con el resto de europeos.    Asimismo, el estudio refleja que los espa?oles dedican diariamente una media de siete minutos a lavarse el pelo y peinarse, un minuto ms que la media europea. Los jvenes de entre 17 y 24 a?os tardan alrededor de diez minutos. En cuanto al cuidado del cabello, se lo lavan una media de cinco das a la semana, es decir, prcticamente cada vez que se duchan, lo que supone 271 das al a?o; mientras que el resto de varones europeos se lo lavan algo menos, slo 245 das al a?o|`|3cf9b1f96ad362d998e58434e972d0dbaa	El continente.|`|a52faacf8fef4d5c9c0c94a3c7f8401caa	en que sentido ps..|`|fa2f5d017ce61b3a54ccbba6b711b78faa	todos somos iguales|`|a41a3273c94111d27668bfe797fded3daa	No, los espa?oles son mas competitivos, pacficos y ciudadanos modelos(la mayoria) en cambio los latinos son, en pocas palabras cualquier cosa (algunos) no tienen competencia ni nada por el estilo.

9eno55hCaa	My husband and I are in a similar situation only we've been living here a while.<br>  <br>  He works, Im at home (i still have to take danish courses), and we have a 13week old daughter.  We live about 15-20 mins from Norport Station in Copenhagen via bus/train.  We roughly spend anywhere from 26,000 - 30,000 kroner per month since the baby was born.<br>  <br>  We both have student loans so, if you dont have those you may get away with 3000 less than us.  Our apartment is only 2 rooms though, so we need to move at some point, and then our monthly spending will go up.|`|c1eca38092f39169e2aa977c6e14a121aa	Its very expensive.<br>  <br>  I moved here two years ago with my Danish husband and we must live 1 hour outside of Copenhagen to afford a home. The traffic is bad and cars cost three times what you pay in the US. Gas costs the equivalent of 8 USD per gallon. Utilities are the most expensive in the world.<br>  <br>  Taxes range 42 to 60% of your income. Everything has 25% tax to include food. There is an annual tax for owning a television as well.<br>  <br>  I would say unless you make the equivalent of 150,000 USD per year its not worth it.
6QhxDJnUaa	I went to Boracay independantly, took PAL flight from Manila to Kalibo, upon arrival local mini buses were waiting to transport passengers on the 1 hour trip to ferry boat (P200 inclusive) to Boracay island. Double room and private shower cost P1500 per night, next door was the Red Coconut Hotel where a similar type room but with a balcony costs P2000-2200 per night. A porter accompanies you from the airport straight to the hotel check-in, so you don't even have to carry your own luggage. The beaches are to die for and there are loads of good bars and restaurants, (look out for the Hobbits Bar, the manager and his wife are both filipino dwarfs and extremely welcoming). There is a modern shopping area to browse around and ample beach side eateries. Be prepared however to be pestered to death by the street vendors trying to sell you watches and other trinkets, apart from the Boracay resort and the beach there is not much else to see as the island is very small. Have a good trip!|`|cac3436b1c34031d74eef5dda8652099aa	Sorry I do not know the answer to your question (all I can suggest is to google for "travel packages to boracay") but I would advice you that since you're doing this for your beloved Husband...

December falls to peak season so some hotels are already fully booked. when we went there last august, we took PAL express flights (roundtrip) then we stayed in Pacio Pacific (station 2) because they offered free breakfast buffet. we stayed there for 3 days and 2 nights. we only paid less than P7,500 except terminal fees. i hope you enjoy your stay in boracay! hmmm.... beer... zzz...|`|9Qpi9Gyoaa	Logon to Palakbayan.

It would be more fun and you can shop with your heart's delight.

One of the valuable answers was Zoser's answer. Also I can believe the lady who asked was really annoyed much serious. <br>  Let me tell you after all what they said, it's a real problem that many guys use to speak to any attractive lady they see. It doesn't mean that those guys representing Egyptian men. At least they are not the Egyptian men you would prefer to attract. Most of them are street guys. Some are thieves or guys who has nothing to do, so they are thinking about money, visa, sex and may be anything they can get. <br>  <br>  It's something ridiculous and I admit we have this annoying problem, but there are some steps for females to be away from this problem as possible. <br>  1st to know what to wear and when. Cairo is not Sharm and streets are not like beaches. Modest clothes and attitude as possible make it more easy. <br>  2nd Don't smile just for any stranger <br>  3rd If you don't mind to attract many guys, just take care you may attract the wrong guys, that may be not safe for you. This is the most repeated mistake I saw and heard by many female tourists who visit Egypt. <br>  <br>  Same advice is suitable to any females anywhere in the world including here in Yahoo answers. Naturally many males or females would love the attraction of the opposite sex, but not randomly.

f8aa8e21997cfa7908574dfa12f124cdaa	My friend, there are two ways to get there from Manhattan.    Option 1: take the Queens-bound (eastbound) "E" train (Blue Line on the subway) to Sutphin Blvd-Jamaica Station/JFK. Once there, you can transfer to the Airtrain to the terminals.    Option 2: take the LIRR eastbound, from Penn Station to Jamaica Station. Once there, you can transfer to the Airtrain to the terminals.    Please note, if you're taking the Airtrain from Jamaica Station, the fare is $5 each way. Also, if you're taking the LIRR, please be aware that you can purchase a CityTicket from the ticket machine for $3.25 each way, which is $2 off the regular off peak fare.    I hope this information is very helpful.    Good luck  Native New Yorker|`|a1iam8Zvaa	taxi?|`|AA11435892	Either the A downtown to Howard Beach to the Airtrain.

In the Polish Soviet War  Poland fought against Soviet Russia and Soviet Ukraine http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish%E2%8...  Both wars resulted from conflicts concerning national borders and lands in post World War I Europe.  When you do the research on the Polish Ukrainian War, look up the so-called Orl?ta Lwowskie/Lww Eaglets - they are quite legendary in Poland and the cementary where they are buried is unfortunately still a source of conflict between Poles and Ukrainians.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lw%C3%B3w_E...|`|7edf5543fb479567c4ec66d9c2af3698aa	No, because during WW2 Ukraine didn't exist as a country but it was part of the Soviet Union.

I heard it a lot in college in the Phils.|`|EVO33N9Gaa	Manana habit we inherited from the Spanish.|`|ZSAbJEv6aa	It's a Filipino habit which most of us are guilty of doing, including me.  The thought that we have plenty of time to get to doing our tasks or responsibilities, shelving it for another day and then another day until we realize that the day is upon us and we panic.    I have resolved to change this ugly habit but often, it does not get done.  It is akin to the Filipinos' "ma?ana" system or taking a chance at God's help with the oft-repeated excuse "Bahala na ang Diyos".    The second statement is a positive declaration of one's capability however, we become too optimistic we oftentimes give ourselves too much credit not realizing that there are things that are beyond our skills/abilities, beyond our scope and only then do we seek others' assistance but not before swallowing our pride.    Well, these attitudes hamper our country's development or progress because development or progress starts with each of us.  And I think it is one reason why we haven't moved forward as a unified country or as progressive as our other neighbors.  It's the truth but one we like to disregard.|`|r1IRcrMPaa	Its like saying: "Why do today what you can do for tomorrow".
0ed3a47409dac89fe63086d50549f520aa	I did the same EF tour when I was in high school in the US, I live in Europe now.    Whether or not you get to go out completely depends on your school guidelines, if you are unsure about them ask the trip sponsors. We were allowed to roam in groups of 3 or more, and had a similar curfew. Note though that many clubs don't open (or at least really get started) until 23.00, and some have age limits of 20+. If you want to be sure you get in, dress nicely and go with a group of girls.    The trip is a good mixture of planned activities and free time, but again it depends on what your sponsors have arranged, so I would just ask them for a schedule. We had at least a few hours each day of free time.    We had a tiny balcony in our French hotel room, but not the others. It was in a great location with a great view. The London room was sort of nondescript in the middle of a residential area, so not much to see anyway. The hotels aren't the same, so it depends :)    And the restaurant choices were good, but you'll get plenty of time to try out different places on your own as well. My favorite was Wong Kei in London (which is notorious for its rude waiters, but I think it's calmed down some in the past years) and a Dutch pancake house in Paris.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wong_Kei    Anyway, have fun, it's a good trip :)|`|hMNClFh9aa	I think that it all depends on the school and agency (or whoever is organising the trip).   My opinion is that if you are going to Europe, they want you to know some new culture. That is the point of a trip.   Many hotels have and many hotels do not have balconies. In my city its 50:50    Enjoy your stay
kMK9E2a7aa	I know where it is and I've been there. The Camino del Reyes. It is near Malaga at a place called El Chorro. The footpath is very dangerous to hike because of the dilapidated state that it is in. There were people killed there a few years ago when the footpath skirting the side of the gorge collapsed. I believe you can still cross, but it is not recommended unless you are very experienced and extremely fit. The area is a place of outstanding beauty. Many people don't realise whilst flying into Malaga, it is on the flightpath as you approach the airport.   You can visit the area without walking the footpath. There are roads where you can drive to see the area.    The railway adjacent was a location in the film "Von Ryan's Express"

I learned this from a business studies GCSE case study on public relations and image of a business    A chav is basically an antisocial person who is not so intelligent, and tries to be cool by acting in an antisocial way (like a yob). I learned *this* from going to a state school for the past 4 and a half years.       I hope this helps you : )|`|C5JxA8k0aa	Chavs are not always on the dole, some work in Chip Shops, McDonald's etc However invariably they are almost always on the dole. They are always unwed, speak in a basic form of english, are from a very young age prolific breeders, and have a strict dress code (chav fashion does change sometimes).Other chav characteristics include low intelligence(they do have a low form of cunning which can be mistaken for intelligence) petty criminal behavior, and a huge ego- a tough guy attitude, which they only have when they are together with all their mates.   And they have no aspirations beyond being a degenerate, if you want to see some chavs, watch some episodes of the jeremy kyle show on YouTube- which is the british equivalent of the jerry springer show.
PSiNv7gUaa	It's more of an educational park, but it's super fun nonetheless.  They have several rides, live animals (aquatic, at one attraction), interactive educational experiences, shows and a phenomenal night show!!  The most popular ride there is the Test Track, you go through a car safety testing simulation, then out into open air where you race at 60 MPH.  To save time, I would skip going on Spaceship Earth (the big ball thing) as it is pretty boring, definitely NOT worth the wait, you just slowly move past scenes portraying the history of communication.  Not that interesting, I was sorely disappointed as I only had half a day to see Epcot the first time I went.  To find out everything there is to do there, you should definitely check out the website:  http://disneyworld.disney.go.com/parks/e...|`|eD7qRBKHaa	There are two sections to the park.  The front section is called Future World.  This is where most of the rides are.  Spaceship Earth (in the big golf ball) is a slow-moving ride through time.  Then, there are different pavilions which each have multiple attractions.  Over at the Land, you must ride Soarin.  There's the Living Seas which is sort of a huge aquarium with some interactive exhibits.  You need to ride Test Track and Mission: Space also.      The back section of the park is called the World Showcase.  Here there are country pavilions.  Each has people working there that are actually from that country.  You will find authentic food, products, and architectural design.  There are just two rides, a slow boat ride in Mexico and a Viking boat ride in Norway.  There are also movies in China and Canada and France, all of which are worth seeing.    One of the best parts to Epcot is the live performers.  There are some of the neatest shows that go on throughout the park, throughout the day.  If you go, be sure to get a Times Guide and see some of them.|`|54tW840Oaa	epcot is a great park: it has two sections future world and the world showcase  future world- mission space, test track, spaceship earth (in the epcot ball), nemo and friends, ellens universe of energy, journey into imagination with figment, soarin, living with the land boat tour.  world showcase: each country has a pavillion and food stands and some have restaurants and all have shops:  america- show about americn history  canada- 360 degree film, restaurant  moracco- restaurant  china- 360 film  france- film, 2 restaurants  germany- restaurant  mexico- indoor boat ride, dining in pavillion  Italy- fantastic restaurant it is pricey but the food is excellent  Japan- restaurant  Norway- indoor boat ride and movie, restaurant  UK- pub and dining room  Hope this helps and make sure to stay for the IllumiNations Reflections on Earth night show it is spectacular and it is on the lake arounf the world showcase.  have fun=)|`|5oAU7S9zaa	Epcot is mostly about different cultures, and countries.

The three main rides are Mission Space (G-Force ride), Test track (Ride where your being driven {not that exciting}), and Space Mountain (real fun [indoor roller coaster]). Then there are other rides but those are the best. Then you can go to different countries on the other side of epcot. They have china, italy, france, germany, morroco, And so on.... You can eat at these countries and some of them have small rides.

There's also Test Track!   There's a lot more. I'm sure that Disneyworld.com has details about all of the rides.|`|9NpXU7D2aa	its really fun. there are 2 parts of the park. future world is in the front of the park and is all about technology and and the earth. attractions in the section are spaceship earth (in the epcot ball) this ride talks about communications. mission space is about space travel and you really feel like an astronaunt. test track shows you different tests that GM cars go though before they can be sold then puts you in the action as a test dumbie. universe of energy with ellen degenerous takes you on a journey into the past to the begining of earth and with bill nye the science guy's help you learn all about types of energy. soarin takes you on a "plane" ride over different parts of california. you can smell oranges as you pass over the orange groves and your trip ends at disneyland. living with the land shows you how every day scientists are thinking of new ways to grow food. its really neat to see some of the things they do. like growing tomatoes on trees  instead of on the ground or spraying water directly on the route of a plant and letting the routes be exposed.   imagination! with figment takes you on a tour where you experience sight, sounds, and smells or you imagination. in the seas with nemo and friends you will help try to find nemo then you will be free to walk around a huge aquarium filled with awesome sea life like manatees, dolphins, sharks, and more. honey i shrunk the audience is a 3d show where you accidentally get shrunk and they have to make you bigger again.   the other part of the  park is "world showcase" this section of the park has 11 different countries to explore. (mexico, norway, china, germany, italy, USA, japan, morocco, france, UK, canada) this part is all about the different cultures and their similarities and differences. each country has its own area around a lagoon. there are shops, restaurants, and short films at the countries. 2 countries (norway and mexico) have a boat ride. and they each have different activities going on outside of the the country such as singing, dancing, or story telling.   and at night there is an amazing fireworks display in the world showcase lagoon. its called "illuminations reflections of earth" in my opinion its the best fireworks display in all of disney world.|`|FQ4nhSiRaa	Epcot is so much more than it used to be! When we were there last year it was our favorite park. Epcot is not so much just about the rides, but discovery. Each ride and exhibit has a purpose to teach guests something.   Test Track - thrill ride as if you're the test track dummy for new vehicles    The Land Exhibit:   Soarin - the best ride there! a ride that simulates a hang glider gliding over California.   Living with the land - a boat ride teaching about agriculture and farming  Circle Of Life - a touching show with Simba as guide     The Seas Exhibit - a Nemo ride and then lots of sealife exhibits - great for anyone who loves Sea life.     Imagination Pavilion:   Honey, I Shrunk the audience: 3-d adventure where you feel as if you've been shrunk to the size of a peanut  Journey into imagination ride     Mission Space Pavilion:  I didnt do this one but it is apparently a flight simulator ride    Spaceship Earth - ride    Innoventions - walk through attraction letting guests see, and try out new inventions, video games, all kinds of stuff     then there is the World Showcase which has 11 different countries, with shows, rides and exhibits, lots of cool shopping, and some of the best restaurants in the world.    Its hard to describe but it is fun and educational at the same time. You have to take your time and slow down and really look at what they have to offer, not just race off to get on the rides. When I first visited 12 years ago I didnt care for it there wasnt much there then but now they have added so much and it is great.|`|Ukh1zQhbaa	epcot stands for experimental prototype of tomorrow it is separated in to 2 sides of side has a bunch of countrys and such|`|21e0e69dece252916371aa3772468af9aa	It's basically a park to show the different cultures of the world.  Such as.. India, Japan, Asia, China, Japan, France, Canada, Ect.  Theres much more.  The main rides & attractions there are Test Track, Mission Space, Spaceship Earth, and Soarin.  Everything you wanna know about epcot: http://disneyworld.disney.go.com/parks/e...  A click away.|`|zyUfLvF5aa	Some of the Descriptions on this page are incorrect partly. Yes, Epcot does have World Showcase but that is not the whole park. It is only half of it. EPCOT was originally going to be Walt Disney World, at least in Walt's original plans. The name was changed to Walt Disney World after Walt's death. The second park was named Epcot in honor of Walt's Original plans. The word EPCOT stands for Experimental Prototype Community Of Tomorrow. When you first walk into Epcot the first thing that you will see (after the gates) is Spaceship Earth or better known just as the big ball. This is actually a ride(it is my favorite). It is a slow dark ride, about 14 minutes long. Be sure to go on it at least once, and visit the after show too!   After Spaceship Earth you will walk into the center area of the park. Off on either side of you is inoventions, where there is all kinds of cool technology stuff. In front of you in the fountain, and a pin station is nearby. if you turn to the left, in the direction of the tunnel, you will find the thrill rides of the park. Test Track, which is the fastest ride on Disney Property, going 65 miles per hour. It takes you through tests that a car might go through to be tested for different aspects of the car. There is also Mission Space, which is a ride the takes you to Mars, sort of. There are two versions of the ride, one that spins and one that does not. The last thing is Ellen's Energy Adventure, or more known as the Universe of Energy, which with Ellen(the actor and TV show host) and Biil Nye the Science Guy, takes you through time to discover different kinds of energy.   If you take a right at the fountain, you will first see club cool, which is a great place to cool off. There you can try all kinds of different sodas from around the world(sponcered by Coke). Keep going to the right and you will soon kind the land. This is the building with Soarin in it. This is a high flying ride over Califorina, no plane ticket required. Watch out during the busy seasons thought, as the most popular rides, Soarin, Test Track, and Mission Space will have very long lines, so get on themm early. If you are looking for somewhere to eat lunch, have it at sunshine seasons food court in the land, a great place for lunch. Also in the land is the lion king movie, the circle of life, with all of your favorite lion king caracters, teaching you about the earth. The last thing in the land is the boat ride, living with the land. You might not know that all of the veggies that you eat in Epcot come from in the greenhouse in the land, which you can see on the boat ride, or you can take a walking tour through it for a much closer look.   When you come out of the land, head to the left, over to the seas with Nemo and Friends. Check out the ride inside, and then check out all of the fish! If you take a right out of the land, you will hit Imagination, a ride the the popular little dragon, Figment. Explore how your five sences have a new addition, your imagination. When you come out of Imagine works, after the Imagination ride, Check out Honey, I shruck the Audience, where you are invited to the invertor of the year ceromony, but be perpaired, things get a little out of hand in 3D. Kepp going after that and you will be getting to World Showcase, where you can go around the world in 10 minutes. World showcase is about a mile all around, and is the place to watch the fireworks show at 9 PM. In Order from the right around is Canada, United Kingdom, France, Morocco, Japan, The American Adventure, Italy, Germany, China, Morway, and Mexico. If you are staying at the Boardwalk, or the Yaht and Beach Club resorts, use the International Gateway between the United Kingdom and France. This is a second enterence to the park, but there is no parking for that one. Make sure to check out a showing of the American Adventure show. Very good, one of the best rides in the park. Also check out, the Canada Film in Canada, The Impressions De France movie in France, The Reflections of China in China, Maelstrom the boat ride in Norway and El Rio Del Tiempo boat ride in Mexico.   Be sure to stick around for IllumiNations: Reflections of Earth fireworks show at the end of the day over World Showcase Lagoon at 9PM. The best place to watch it is from Italy. In World Showcase, you can learn all about other parts of the world right now, and in Future World, you can learn about the future ahead of us.  I hope that you have a great time at Epcot, and if you have any other questions about Walt Disney World, contact me at epcotexpert@yahoo.com.|`|vaKpWe6kaa	Its basically about the world.  It has stuff about the future.  Its pretty cool.|`|Yve5HMaRaa	Epcot is a beautiful park. It's theme is culture and learning. It's abit educational in a fun way. There are 10 rides and many shows. The World Show Case is a must see. It brings you to 11 different mini countries around the world. The countries are Mexico, Norway, China, Italy, Germany, USA, The United Kingdom, Canada, Morocco, and many more. All offer different foods from around the world. Mexico and Norway have rides. I would definitely recommend that park.|`|uaOMEvJTaa	Epcot is really good, i personally love it. It's been a while since I've been though.    It's basically is got lots of different areas and each one is a different culture, i.e. one is British, the One is Chinese etc and its a really nice place to just walk around.

You should contact Disney, and ask, because you might end up being kicked out of the park, if they have some sort of rules against plugging in electrical devices of any kind, other than for, say, medical purposes.  Play it safe, contact Disneyland.    I think this is the link for Disneyland, that will lead to those in power, that can answer your question.  http://disneyland.disney.go.com/disneyla...    OK, my bad, that link is for help about the Disney.com site.  Hold on, I am trying to find a link, that will let you ask your very important question, to a person at Disney, that can answer authoritatively...      Alright...  Here is a contact page, for Disney...  https://secure-disneyland.disney.go.com/...    Again..  I suggest you contact a Disney Official, for the answer to your question.  I know from experience in the entertainment industry, that most public venues, and parks, have to out of necessity, refuse to allow guests and visitors, to plug anything into a power outlet, due to safety reasons, and the fact, that if you let one park visitor do it, you will soon have 10,000 visitors doing it.  If you have ever been to Disneyland, and seen how crowded it always is, I would say, that it is a safe bet, that plugging anything into an outlet there, is strictly forbidden, and for that fact, they have probably removed any outlets, accessible to the public.|`|ac7e0f50f58632b431b5cf5de0564ffbaa	You're not going to have any access to outlets at any Disneyland restaurants. My advice is to get a hotel room close to the resort, like the HoJo Anaheim, and charge your battery there.
BMuzICNVaa	It's obviously going to affect Sydney Airport somehow, so that would be why they are having a say, if it was a direct route to Canada I can understand where your coming from, but I dont think its that simple. Cheers.|`|ScLAUvYfaa	It says it right there in the article.  The flights would operate by flying through sydney.  The ACCC is the regulating body in Australia which makes sure that corporate practice remains 'fair' for the public in Australia - for example, they make sure that companies do not collude on setting prices for things, as that would undermine the competition between companies necessary to keep prices from being unnaturally inflated.    The ACCC has rejected this bid because Air New Zealand and Air Canada, between them, make up 50% of the flights servicing Sydney and Vancouver.  If they join up together, it reduces competition for flights between sydney and canada, meaning that the two of them would, if they wanted, be able to drive up prices.    It's quite simple, and perfectly legitimate.  If they want to use Australian airports, they need to abide by Australian regulations.|`|s2IOyj8iaa	I don't know perhaps they are using Australias air space|`|NsYjHfBkaa	We're Aussies! We have an opinion on everything! And we aren't afraid to shout it to anyone who will listen!!|`|dUpVqoB6aa	I think it is simple survival of the fittest issue.Australia wants what is best for our economy and well being.I suppose the proposal would mean that Australia would loose money and simply Australia would not want that for its country.
KS2OHXCRaa	If you want to have your car with you, first you'll need to book for passage to cross from Dover to Calais, either by ferry or by the tunnel via Eurotunnel Shuttle (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurotunnel_... ).    In the summer months, you can go on Motorail (http://www.raileurope.co.uk/default.aspx... ) from Calais to Nice, then drive from Nice to Italy. The following link is an excellent guide on using the Motorail (http://www.seat61.com/Motorail.htm Franc... ). The benefit of Motorail train is you and your vehicle are on the same train so you'll arrive at the same time and the cost of your travel is per car AND the passengers tickets included.    Otherwise, as advised by Choco BN, the alternative is Autotrain. However, your vehicle is delivered overnight separately while you will need to get separate tickets on normal train services to travel to the same destination. So unlike Motorail you will not be on the same train as your car.|`|wulDeEWsaa	You can purchase a eurail ticket if you plan on travelling to other countries. Other than that it'd be hella expensive.|`|zlPAVkUBaa	I don't think so.    Seems like it would be easier and a lot cheaper to fly Ryan Air and rent a car in Italy.|`|PHpVr8raaa	I'm not sure I understand your question. You want to travel by car or train?    If you want to put your car on the train to avoid driving through France, you can do so in France from Lille to Frjus-St-Rapha?l on the French Riviera or from Paris to Nice. Frjus is an hour's drive to the Italian border and Nice is a 10-minute drive to Italy.    It's called auto-train: http://www.tgv-europe.com/en/Passenger_s...    You can book your own train ticket online but not the ticket for your car.    EDIT: Since the auto-train is not cheap, I agree with the first person that its easier to just fly to Italy and rent a car there. It's also easier to drive with a car that is made for right handside driving because it's a pain to reach to the opposite side of the car when you need to pay at a toll booth or press the button for a ticket to enter a parking garage (if you are travelling alone).
rvTcDJ6yaa	It depends on what you want to do..skiing would be winter of course, but for things in general, maybe try between the seasons eg march/april and sept/oct....  I went to France in Feb and August.....it was not as cold as I thought it would be and it did not get as hot as I thougth it would be, BUT you can easily be caught out by rouge weather.    I went to Italy in April and remember it rained a bit actually.....I had a thunderstorm in venice, overcast in siena and rain in rome...but they were interspaced with nice days in betweeen...albeit a bit cloudy.  I hit Italy over easter and there seemed to be a lot of toursits around, but maybe it is like that all the time! If you go off season you can get some deals on accommodation and flights and have less people but still decent weather.|`|M2BA0PEyaa	I think in springs or summer. For me the best time to visit them its April... Italy's awesome in springs and I think France too
AA10956234	Eye Contact here in Egypt is everywhere, but in many times it's Eye scanning more than contact, for example when you go to a super market and buy things, people start to look at what you are buying and then look at you or to your eyes, as they want to see who is this person who is buying this stuff and why!! lol    There is something that Egyptian are famous with, maybe it's hard to find anywhere else, really, we have "Fahlawa" which is we clever in getting out of problems or from moving around the problem, we are not like turkish for example who are not easy to negotiate with them, white or black :) ,     We use eye contact each day, when driving, in transportation, in work between employees and clients, in police offices, in streets, we understand many things from looking to each other,     also I think there are people who can read what the eye is saying, sometimes you look to a woman and you feel that she is missing something in her life, or you look to another eyes and see that he is happy , or that he is lying or he is not feeling secure,     Reading eyes is not easy and I think it's a talent, But staring is too annoying and you can feel what is looking and what is staring,     Did I say that i miss you?? welcome back :)|`|0KR4wyoQaa	Well maybe not TOO much eye contact, but if someone doesn't eye contact, it means that he is lying and doesn't know what he's saying, and therefore won't trust what he says.|`|9R8uYHcPaa	i hate when people stare ...|`|ravzJTVOaa	in Egypt, eye contact is important to show respect .  if someone doesnt look me in the eye , he doesnt SEE ME , or has something to hide from me .  men speak to women by using eye language .  if the woman likes the man, she throws him a look that is worth a thousand words !  but if she wants him to marry her , she acts like a shy girl and avoids giving him that look !|`|oKE6EyJXaa	Eye contact = Confidence|`|hhhk499qaa	in egypt eye contact is respect|`|0pM85b5Baa	In Egypt it's very important in many fields.   Personal relations friends/lovers/colleagues - Boss/employee relation - customer/seller - team members - Father/son - security - Politics.    The most important to say, eye contact is overused in our society and it's not right that life depends on much eye contact. Some relations should have clear words.|`|rfD11nZEaa	Eye contact means a lot depending on who, where and when!|`|1op04gcFaa	even though i am not Egyptian, i hope you would not mind me answering this question from my point of view, because i feel that i belong to this wonderful family.  it is said that the eyes are the mirrors of the soul. it is true, if you consider that the only way too look at a persons brain, without opening their head, is to look into their eyes.  as for me... i am pretty shy in person so i do tend to avoid looking in my eyes if the person in question is not someone that i know well. but i do not act like that when i have an ''official'' or ''formal'' conversation.  it is strange... i am shy when i am in question. when i am not ready to reveal myself completely to the person that is still not enough familiar to me. but when i trust someone i trust them with my eyes, or better, with my soul...|`|1PBT0C4Caa	Its very important here.  I LOVE EYE LANGUAGE :D|`|GX16O4OFaa	depends on how w woman looks at as man mostly|`|RaXCko4saa	I think that people are the same everywhere, i mean that some people are so shy for that they avoid eye contact , on the other hand there are many people who prefer to look in the eyes of the people as a sign of self confidence. it's a personal habit more than a feature of the country. it's recommended, in business talks and in presentation before audience, that you look in the third eye ( the part between the 2 eyes) when you talk to people to avoid confusion and this advice is for all people all over the world.  in egypt, some girls could accept the eye contact as a sign of love , others could consider it as a bold sign. it depends , maybe some people misunderstand the eye contact and they create many dreams or situations on it.i prefer to talk directly without using the body language because it could make many embarrassing situations|`|mbLD7AIraa	Nice question  It is very important here ... it says something especially we , here , don't go straight and say it (whatever it is) so eye contact is considered a very important way of sending "signals"

pm2EeEgiaa	Sorry to disappoint you, but student backpacking around Southeast Asia is not really existent - most students do their gap years in East Asia, like Korea and Japan.     Most tourists to Southeast Asia are either yuppies (mostly) and the DOMs ("Dirty Old Men") who look for sex-based tourism and child prostitution, unfortunately.    If you want to join the yuppie backpack trail, Thailand leads the way, followed by Laos and Cambodia. All three are known for their hilltribes.     If you want the beaches, go to the Philippines and Indonesia (both countries have nicer beaches than Thailand).     If you want shopping, the world's largest shopping malls are in the Philippines. Thailand also has some decent malls, along with Singapore and Indonesia although none of them are as large as those found in the Philippines.    If you want nightlife, Philippines is a sure winner for student and alternative nightlife, alongside Thailand.    If you want culture treks, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, and Myanmar are the best.

f8aa8e21997cfa7908574dfa12f124cdaa	My friend, may I recommend Dylan's Candy Bar, located on 60th Street and 3rd Avenue in Midtown Manhattan. The place is a "chocolate haven" for someone who loves chocolates.    Another place that I would recommend, also located on in the area, is Serendipity 3. Like Dylan's, it also a place for chocoholics and those with a sweet tooth.     Serendipity 3 is located is located on 60th Street between 2nd and 3rd Avenue. To get to both places, you can take the  4, 5, 6, "N", "R" or "W" subway lines (Green and Yellow Line on the subway map) to 59th Street - Lexington Avenue. Once you exit the subway, walk a block east to 3rd Avenue.    I hope this information is very helpful.

lcj1AKt1aa	I went on the Sea Princess not the Caribbean Princess but I believe the policies are the same.  The only thing that you have to pay for is drinks.  That is all sodas as well as alcoholic beverages.  The only free juice is at breakfast. You do not have to pay for anything if you don't want to.  All meals are free.  If you order wine with your meal you have to pay for it. There is a free ice cream station but also one that you have to pay for. There is a Steak House Restaurant that is about 15-25 per person.    There are many restaurants as well as the buffet section.  You can choose to 'anytime dining' or choose 6:30 or 8:30 pm. There is a formal night or two depending on the amount of nights.  The men must wear tie and by extension a jacket in order to enter the dining room. You must produce your cruise card at this time. I must tell you that the people really dress in their best.      There are lots of pics taken, when you enter the ship, when you enter different ports at on formal night.  There are very expensive if you buy them but not if you just take them.  In actual fact you can pose for all.  They are then displayed for anyone to see.    If you use the spa you will have to pay for the services. There is a gratuity/tip fee of 10.50 per person per day.  If you do not want to participate in it or want to adjust it you can, just go to the Purser Desk. The excursion from the ship are expensive but you can go and bargain with the taxi-drivers in the different ports.    There is entertainment ever night by the pool side (sail-away melodies).There is a disco as well as lounges.  There are lots of free classes including line-dancing, meringue, salsa, rumba and others. There is a nightly show in the theater at two sittings. There is also movies by the pool.    There is a kids club and also lots of activities for children. Do not forget to bring your swim suits. There is a news paper (Princess Patter)that is pushed under the door every night filled with information.  Read it!    If you need any more info just say. If I remember anything more important I will put it in. Have a look at the ship, and other activities.

AA10250756	Goucher is in a wooded area in what's really a prosperous suburb of Baltimore, Towson. It is not far to a mall or a bank, and there are houses right where you leave the campus.

qpqZybQ1aa	For the last few years and especially this year, Quebec City has been booming. It has surpassed Montreal on all accounts, be it culture, economic growth or special events. People are starting to complain about Montreal sitting on its lazy bum and relying on its long-standing reputation and not doing anything to renew itself as a city. It is starting to become a big North American city (because yes, it is becoming more and more English) like any other that's got nothing special to offer anymore.    But even then, Montreal remains a safe bet for partying and is by all means more multicultural than Quebec City. Quebec City IS more tourist-oriented, but it is likewise cleaner, 10 times more beautiful and more historical. Besides, there will be A LOT happening for New Year's, as it marks the end of our 400th anniversary.    It really depends on what you want. Montreal is big, good for partying, more cosmopolitan and very English. Quebec City is more European, you get to see what Quebec is really like, safer, cleaner and people tend to be friendlier AND there will be very good partying here for New Year's, it's gonna go all out and it's been like that since this summer.    Take your pick ;) you'll enjoy both whatever you do.|`|b32e560414238926779c6d2630e98a48aa	It depends on how old you are too, if you are over the age of 30, you may enjoy Quebec City. Its more catered to the historical sites. If you are under the age of 30, Montreal would be more enjoyable. The Downtown is larger and gives you both perspectives of "old" and "new". You will also enjoy the fact that Montreal is more english. You also have a better transit system in montreal, making it easier to see more things. |`|BkXkP1gNaa	goooo to montreal  not quebec city  what you said is right, its really historical  montreal is less so  and more english if you want that too  since its for new years, which is supposed to be fun  id say monteal :)    i just found that quebec city was so boring!!! :(  but i'm young, and not very interested in history  I don't know what you personally would prefer :P  if you're into that kind of thing you might like it :)     im allowed to say its boring im canadian hehe :)|`|VHlXFcUwaa	I'd say Qubec.. here are my reasons :    I think it's beautiful ! there's a lot to see here..     The old part of the city that is 400 years old.. very nice buildings and attraction for tourists. Especially this year with the 400th birthday of Qubec city, it's perfect !    There is an island called Ile d'Orlans about 20 minutes away from the center of the city. There, there are lots of farms and feilds, great for a picnic ! I worked on that island this summer.. I was a guide in a house that was about 300 years old.. I had a suit on people in the 1700s and explained how people live in quebec at that time    But it's not all old and empty in Quebec ! The city is full of lights.. not as much as Montreal but still nice because there's less pollution. There are great bars, restaurants, delicious food, and palces to hang at with friends.     Also, you'll have to see a hockey game ! In one of those 'Sports bar' . Don't miss out on the Habs ^^    Have a nice trip :)

AA10982716	Quebec doesn't have much of an airport, so right there Montreal's cheaper to get around in, since you'd probably have to fly to Montreal and take the bus or rent a car, or else pay up to twice as much for your flight.    Getting around town shouldn't be too expensive, depending where you stay. Quebec's much smaller but also steeper.    The no French shouldn't be a problem in either place (there's more bilingual people in Montreal, but Quebec caters to tourists more).    Quebec's a bit more historical, but Montreal's good for that too, and Montreal has a better reputation for nightlife, but the bar laws are the same and Quebec also has tons of students, so it's good for that too.    Do you have time for both?|`|AA10531094	Both are quite beautiful, but I found Montreal better when it came to clubbing and shopping in the underground mall.

The reason I say Montreal is that you get the best of both worlds. You can visit the "old port" and discover all of the historical sites by day. And take a short walk and have a night out on the town. Montreal has ALOT to do, much much more than Quebec city, therefor you can never be bored. |`|yKseT4D4aa	Montreal will be better if your a student|`|SKmvuHMhaa	Quebec city by a mile.

But by no means will it be luxury.  |`|b32e560414238926779c6d2630e98a48aa	yes, well...not in vancouver, but anywhere else you should be just fine. |`|2sR3pnkMaa	yes, you will survive in anywhere in Canada at 3k a month, depending on where in Canada and how pragmatic you are depends on the level of luxury ( or lack of ) you will have. You can live in downtown Vancouver and survive just fine at 3k a month.
57d4f2697917e4b39ee6da4458cc830eaa	Highway 11 in Northern Ontario is the furthest north you can easily drive in Eastern Canada. On a good night they can cover the whole sky. Absolutely awesome. It's a long trip but if you're in the area at the right time, as I was several years ago, it's a sight you'll never forget.  Every few months I can see them over Calgary but they're not nearly as impressive here as in Northern Ontario.|`|4INE794zaa	I can see them perfectly here in North Bay, Ontario. |`|b32e560414238926779c6d2630e98a48aa	Anywhere that is North, the higher north you go, better the view.|`|owDjknK8aa	out west...somewhere in Alberta has the best viewing forthe northern lights|`|cByRtCC9aa	North is good, like the answer above. May I suggest Churchill in the winter. You can take a ride on the Tundra Buggy and see polar bears as well as the northern lights.|`|95bb76d0439c02bb72678f77c90632acaa	You can actually see them from just north of Toronto ( which is actually further south than northern California). In Canada, you only need to get away from city lights and pick a night that had a lot of solar activity like flares earlier in the day.   I'm 30 miles north of Toronto and have seen them from here a number of times.|`|kZad7BLqaa	go north.|`|934e6defc1f9740152317085e1c16665aa	look north
AA11756483	Most cigarettes are sold in 25s and depending on where you buy them they can fluctuate by up to a $1.00. Price also depends on the brand - eg: Export A $11.19, Matine $10.14 Accords $8.50    As for the cost of living there is an excellent website which gives you all the major grocery websites, city services, utilities, cultural and community group info, housing and accommodations, currency exchanges, public and private transportation - well almost everything you're going to need to know about moving to Edmonton.    http://www.movetoedmonton.com/living/arr...    Another excellent site is put out by Stats Canada for Edmonton which includes averages for housing, earnings,employment, housing, etc.    http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/met01/met103...    To get a good look at what is available for accommodations you might want to check out the following site. Most ads will include pictures of the houses which are either for sale or for rent.    http://edmonton.kijiji.ca/f-housing-hous...    When you move to a new city it's always good to know where to dine out - you can read the reviews to tons of restaurants broken down into ethnic groups or types of restaurants. Also has shopping on it.    http://www.edmontonplus.ca/portal/index....    The next site is for Capital Health as you will need to apply for healthcare within 3 months of arriving. Forms and any information you need will be found here.    http://www.capitalhealth.ca/default.htm    Need information regarding our school system:  http://www.edmontonkiosk.ca/directory.ph...  or  http://districtsite.epsb.ca/root/alpha-s...    City maps:  http://maps.edmonton.ca/    Canpages is an excellent directory of businesses:  http://www.canpages.ca/business/AB/Edmon...    Once you've gone through all the websites you will have a better understanding of Edmonton and what it has to offer.    Hopefully these will be of help to you. If you need anything else add a note and I'd be happy to assist you.    Good Luck    |`|b32e560414238926779c6d2630e98a48aa	I dont know a 20 pack but on avereage a 25 pack is 11$. Transportation is about 2.25$/adult to get on the bus. Food is pretty standard no extreem costs. Be sure to book a hotel much in advance as Edmontons hotels get booked easily. I suggest Coast Terrace-Best Western for quality and cost. The cost of living depends on where in the city you plan on living, if you plan on owning or renting, many things.

psnaJcvpaa	No I don't think you are mad for wanting to return to the UK if this was your home in the first place and you are homesick.There is no point being somewhere if you are really unhappy.   If you are unhappy, then it makes your children unhappy. You are also obviously missing your friends and family.    The first port of call would be to get some good advice before you can think about making arrangements for your return. As you probably know already we have the Citizens Advice Bureaux in the Uk.. Could you not go to a similar advice center where you are. I am sure that if you ask them they would do some research about you wanting to return back to the Uk.    If you also plan to stay with friends and family, could they not get you some info about whether you would be entitled to benefits?    In the meantime I have given this link for you to have a look at  >>> http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Governmentci...   There is some info on this site about moving back to the UK...

d0e3c48b0a77caeedee441f34df1888daa	Thank God it does not snow here like as much as canada.     believe me we are lucky.  if we want snow, we have a choice and go to the snow. it's not forced to our lifestyle.|`|pcHp7Dgkaa	No. 98% of Australia never gets any snow at all.    The only places here that get real snow are in the high mountains and all that is up there are a few ski resorts and the very small towns that service them. The ski season in the mountains lasts around 3 months or so and they often need to make artificial snow to provide enough for skiing and snowboarding.    In the rest of Australia, there are a handful of places that on a day or two in a very cold winter might get a couple of centimetres of snow that always melts during the day.|`|Fnp2MIycaa	In general we don't get snow.   The majority of Aussies have never seen snow except on TV and movies.  There are the alpine regions which get snow for a few months of the year but that's it.    We do not have snow ploughs clearing our roads so we can get to work and school etc.  Snow does not impact on our daily lives and I'm very thankful for that.|`|sZFA4XXZaa	No way. Only in some parts of southern Australia which are ski resorts do. In NSW, some parts of the Blue Mtns/Central West sometimes receive a bit of snow when it gets cold enough but apart from that, no.|`|iR1pZ5VTaa	no only on the mountains in nsw vic and tas and not very much you only get snow there in winter|`|URuzNGcyaa	no, canada - the land of snow  australia - the land of desert and dry places|`|SjNFANswaa	Are u stupid?|`|5wxHdj1Naa	no|`|NsYjHfBkaa	Definitely Not!  We get no snow apart from on our highest mountains where we go skiing, however these are quite a distance from major cities usually. occasionally it will snow in the towns surrounding the snowfields but this is quite rare.  Even at the snowfields the snow can be very light with little coverage!  While I like the skiing here, if you come from Canada it probably doesn't compare.|`|uEYckSYVaa	Hi, i live in Melbourne, Australia and the only places it ever snows is on the mountains in Vic.  This alone is in the middle of winter and very rare.  it doesnt snow in your backyard or anything  i have never seen snow.  when coming to australia, NEVER EXPECT snow|`|CflxLtV8aa	Hahaha! I wish!!!!

Also, maybe Washington Square Park or Union Square, and they'd probably go to a private school and eat at places like Sardi's or Patsy's Diner.  Other places they'd probably hang out include Dylan's Candy Bar, Dave & Buster's, Planet Hollywood, the Hardrock Cafe, the Apple store, Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.      Other than that, you might want to try a simple google search for other places; there's a whole lot to do in the city, and you can find virtually any store or restaurant there.
kjB4jLcxaa	There is a shuttle bus on the has transportation for students that live off base.  It doesn't matter if you live on base or not.  However it does matter if your father is command sponsored.  If he is, he will have the benefit of having access to the Yongsan base.  If you are under 18, and also command sponsored you will recieve this benefit as well.  Most likely your father will have a diplomatic car issued by the U.S. government.  Once again, if he is command sponsored he will recieve the permit to drive on base.  If there is no comman sponsorship, this is no access to base.  If you are talking about you driving, that's not possible.  You have to be 19 before you can recieve a drivers license here.

Great site!|`|Xoooc2K1aa	If you're living on Kaneohe Bay, your two public high school choices are Castle and Kalaheo.  Which school you'd go to will depend on where you live on Kaneohe Bay as they are geographically very far apart.    Kalaheo High does have a higher population of military kids but that's because of it's close location to Marine Corps Base Hawaii (which is located on Kaneohe Bay).    Hope that helps you......|`|ibELFAjtaa	Dang....I can't find it. D: Sorry!|`|BA3mGlTyaa	The best school as mentioned before is Kalaheo High School in Kailua, here is there link, http://kalaheoh.k12.hi.us/schoolsite/.  Over the years I have known and met numerous kids who have attended the school and they are doing all right to this day.  Not knowing about your other circumstances of where you will be living, but living in Kailua (if affordable) provides you able avenues to other parts of the island.      If you are not living in this area, I know they were taking geographical exceptions (GE's) for last year, just to put you in the know and best to ask the school.    www.hawaii-vacation-adventures-oahu.co...

82wXvW3baa	Well, although this might not help much, if Air Travel were as safe as driving, then every month a jumbo jet would crash and all passengers would die.      Before the airplane takes off or even leaves the gate, the flight attendants make sure you know what to do in the extremely unlikely event of an accident. Now airplanes are very safe. Usually turbulence can't bring down an airplane. The wings are de-iced before the airplane takes off. If the airplane goes into a thunderstorm, the pilots turn to try to fly out of the thunderstorm, or may descend or climb to safer altitudes.    Bottom line, I can assure you that flying is very safe and the pilots will not harm you. They are experienced people that will make sure the airplane touches down safely.    Enjoy your flight.|`|798f76fc55c14c73e3d0bfb56f0b68c8aa	Jerry C is absolutely correct! I fly a few times a year, and I still get a bit nervous every time I do... I had always vowed I would NEVER step foot on an aircraft, but now I really enjoy the experience.     Take an ipod or cd player with you and pack your favorite tunes (the attendants will let you know when it's okay to use approved electronics) to calm you down. I'll never forget the first time I drifted up through the clouds to John Lennon's "Imagine." Magical!|`|HgiTzTaxaa	There is really nothing you can do about it. I sometime still get terrified .

You will be fine I promise, i have beem on airplanes over 30 times and I'm still here.|`|AA10254694	I always try to will the plane to crash.  I think crash plane crash and it never does so I guess I'm not that powerful or almighty.      So that being said I would think you don't have that power either.  Your chances of crashing are the same as winning the lottery.  Buy a lottery ticket and if you win then get worried.|`|EmYNUZcXaa	think about how long people have been flying...then think about how many plane crashes you have heard of...besides the 9/11 incident :(  you have a better chance of getting into a car crash or a train crash and dying then you do a plane. flying is the safest way of traveling. i'm not a fan of flying either because i'm afraid of heights and i'm claustrophobic...sucks to be me LOL.    you will be okay. bring an iPod or something to listen to music with, or bring a laptop or a book to keep your mind off of it. or you can sleep through the flight.    good luck to you|`|62fa2d0c6e8de6507e574cf4131634dfaa	call the airline or check it out on the web...there are deprogramming classes that you can take to help you feel less fearful when you fly     good luck, it really can be a fun experience|`|YOfRm3U5aa	I have flown since I was 6 (now 13) on trips at least 2 times a year.

How often do you hear of a major incident. The most recent, the US Airways that landed in the Hudson, had zero fatalities. You are more likely to get in a crash on the way to the airport, and everyone will tell you the same thing. Trust the statistics.

ntIo0qISaa	Well, my religious beliefs shape my life completely. On the other hand, if you mean no denominations or something like that, then I think it would be a good thing because I think that people lose focus on religious beliefs because of "religion" and the conflicts between all of them.     If we were all purple, I'm sure that the "Purple People Eater" song would have more meaning. I also think that aliens would probably be seen as a neutral color like tan or brown, since we would be such a vibrant color.     But I don't think that equality in these aspects is really what would make the world a better place. I think that the world would be a wonderful place if people were selfless. The most successful locations are the most selfless. That takes out conflict, murder, stealing, cheating, adultry, etc...    Interesting question, by the way.

If you have time, maybe look into a trip to Tunis, Tunisia.|`|e87d9d696031ff74cbe850d5cecbaaa2aa	I had good luck on SpinCityTravel.com.

31v7TjzFaa	I say the best way is to go with Virgin Holidays, they offer the best deals and stuff! I booked through a travel agent though because I wanted to go to a hotel that offered free transportation to all the parks, most just offer to the parks in the area. But even so it's not expensive to get to the other parks. Take a look at the virgin holidays website:    http://www.virginholidays.co.uk/    Good luck!

0l027sJxaa	I live near the Brownsville border (30 minutes away) ! Be very careful when driving in MX.|`|NGBOFUARaa	I'm assuming you are entering Mexico at Brownsville or McAllen.  It is safe and a good trip. It will take between 6 and 7 hours AFTER you clear the border and the Frontier checkpoint, 20 Km south of the border. These will be the biggest bottlenecks you will encounter. The first three hours will be boring farmland and desert grazing lands. About 120 Km from the border, where the roads from Brownsville and McAllen meet,  there is a Federal Police checkpoint. They are looking for contraband coming into Mexico. Smile and take off your sunglasses. Unless you have a large trailor or roof rack, you will be waived through. About fifty Km south of San Fernando you will have a choice to stay on 101 or turn left to the coast road to Soto La Marina. I suggest you do this. It takes you to the coast road to Tampico and avoids most of the mountain switchbacks south of Cuidad Victoria (my home town). You will notice the terrain will change to lush tropical palms, citrus, and bananas, and the weather will become a bit more humid. Rt 180 will parrallel the gulf coast take you to Manual were the road changes back to Rt 81, right into Tampico. (I believe this is a toll road).|`|818a6c4a96262d3d9669cd5c91b5efaeaa	It is about 9 hours.  I have done it several times...as I live in Veracruz.  it is perfectly safe.  Just do not linger in border towns.  I have had no trouble from police...most people that say that kind of thing have never actually driven in Mexico. Sometimes there are military checkpoints, sometimes not.  They are just doing their job...just be courteous.  You know you will need a Mexican car permit and car ins...right?

zzwEOQcHaa	It just means the Abercrombie has purchased a prepaid shipping label, this usually means that it will be shipped that day or the next business day depending on the time. Basically, it just means that Abercrombie has purchased shipping for the item, and are or have shipped your item.

Delivery depends on what shipping type they use, generally however, it takes 2-7 business days (Does not include Sundays) for the lower 48.|`|Dg0D8SCZaa	well, USPS is the United States Postal Service, aka the regular mail, not to be confused with UPS.

nfu6LiVXaa	The education system in China is a lot more stricter - it forces the kid to be more disciplined and hardworking - something that the school system in North America can't do. Schools in North America emphasize in realizing the kid's potential and at the same time, let the kid's inner-self come forth. Education is just a tool in the growth of the kid. Schools in China are competitive and it's more like "force-feeding" - we teach, you learn, no exceptions, no special treatment. It becomes a way of life for the kids, where a kid's future is dictated by his grades. Many Chinese parents were brought up this way and still believes a kid's future and success is determined by grades.    Many Chinese parents will then send their kids back to North America once the kid is in highschool, so that the kid can join into the N.A. education system again in hopes that it'll help the kid get into good universities here.     Yes, another reason is to learn Chinese. Chinese schools in North America are known to be ineffective.|`|a6JZjRG1aa	isn't that obvious?... to learn the language...|`|aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	The public education available in China far exceeds what is available as far as public education in the United States.  The Chinese Americans are sending their children to school in their homeland for this reason, and probably so that they are immersed in their culture, as well.    While secondary education might be better in the U.S. than it is in China, elementary certainly is NOT.  That is my opinion, anyway-and I am an American mother (who homeschools my children because I can do a better job than even the best public school).|`|V9xCaV1raa	'Educational level in China is getting better and better. Besides, with the development of China, Chinese will be a strong language. Speaking Chinese will be a big advantage.

He is very excited about it. It is his first trip to China! He asked what is my suggestion for him to prepare the trip. I do have some tips.    Tip  1: Avoid Travel Around May 1 and Oct. 1.     May 1 to May 4 and October 1 to October 7 are national holidays in China. It is also called Golden Week, because the continous 4-7 day holiday and good weather bring millions of people to scenaric places, hotels, also trains, airlines, and buses. In short, it is crowded everywhere. People visiting China typically dont have the constraint of travel only in the 4-7 days, so avoid it. Also, if possible, avoid the two days before and after the holiday.    Tip  2: Visiting Shanghai? Strongly Suggest to Visit Beijing    For many business travellers to Shanghai, I would suggest to take a weekend to visit Beijing. Shanghai is the largest commercial city in China, but it is not a typical city that represent China. If you want to claim youve really been to China, plan a short trip to Beijing, and visit the Forbidden city, visit the Great Wall, and visit some Royal Gardens in Beijing. Even you dont go to these famous places, to experience the wide streets and the narrow Hutong is a good idea. Just FYI, Beijing is 1400 KM north of Shanghai, and takes 1 and half hours to fly there. Full price ticket is 1130 RMB, and you typically can get ticket at 20% off price. (7 RMB = 1 USD)    Tip  3: Take Taxi!    Dont bother to look at the transportation options unless you are really travelling with small budget. My point is, taxi is not as expensive as people think. From Pudong Airport to downtown is about 100 - 150 RMB (12 - 20 USD). There are much cheaper options like airport bus (18 RMB), but compared to the 100-150 USD taxi fare from SFO to Silicon Valley, it is not too high. To travel inside the city, taxi is also a handy choice, unless you want to experience Metro. (Disclaimer: I gave tips according to real situations. In this case, it is my friend Martin. You may find it not suitable for you).    Tip  4: Places to See?     Top places in Shanghai you should go are    The Bund. Leave it as the last place you go. Bund is much more beautiful and interesting at night (after 7:00 PM when the lights are lit).   Yu Garden. I dont really enjoy Yu Garden, but my friends who visit China for the first time always enjoy themselves so much in the Yu Garden.   Cruise on the Huang Pu River. It worth the time and money to have a cruise on the Huang Pu River, especially at night. Typical cruise is about 1 hour.     More at: http://www.foreignercn.com/bbs/viewthrea...
l9biq5kVaa	Dont see why not. The only reason they were 'lost' in the first place was because we hunted them into extinction. Theres plenty of room for them to roam up North and they'd certainly keep the deer population down. The Americans and Canadians manage to live with them, so can we. Stories of them attacking humans are exagerrated, they are extremely wary of us, and even people who live within a wolves territory will be lucky to actually see them.  Moose, Beaver  and Wild Boar have already been reintroduced to the Highlands maybe wolves next?|`|ucsYXXdSaa	probably best to keep them confined to the west midlands|`|4S5NnT7aaa	Yes.  Turn the loose on the rougher cities of Scotland and watch them thrive on a Ned-rich diet.    A few sabre-tooth tigers released onto the streets of SE London and youth crime would disappear practically overnight.|`|VUfT35UQaa	no, they might start eating children, and we can't have that    many schools have forest areas near them, and also large grounds, and so if a pack of wolves got in there...    ...then again, it would open up an industry for, um, wolf exterminating?    : )|`|YAWkCPqYaa	Have one its called gordon brown|`|BVwDoV81aa	Yeah, lets stick a few hundred in their natural habitat --I believe Olde London Town and its parks in ye olde days were pretty good stomping grounds for wolves.......what say ye....!|`|WT7Gub0Xaa	awww wouldn't it be nice.

Escaped captive Wild Boar are thriving in the wild in part of East Sussex, North Devon and in the Forest of Dean in Gloucestershire, so why not selectively re-introduce Wolves.|`|b8tgCAQJaa	Only in remote parts of Scotland where no bugger lives.    I wouldn't fancy having them hanging around urban areas, where they would be attracted to domestic dogs, would kill livestock and wildlife, would forage for food, and would quite possibly attack humans.    If you have a female dog as a pet, would you want her giving birth to a litter of baby wolf-dogs? I think not.    In parts of Europe and Asia, such as Greece and Kazakhstan where the wolf still exists, the animal is a constant pest to farmers.|`|AZErtytoaa	Wolves and indeed bears were part of our natural habitat but there are obvious problems about reintroduction and has been debated keenly in the Scottish Parliament .

bf84b6c094b10015640619688ae3b997aa	Weather in New York has been a little bit crazy of late (it was in the high 20's (Fahrenheit) or low 30's yesterday and it's in the 50's today), so the best idea might be to bring layers-- that way you can add or remove layers based on the weather on any given day.    In terms of shoes, sneakers might be a good idea.  People do wear UGGs in the snow, but I honestly don't understand why (it always seems to me like they'll get ruined).  You might want to get a pair of rain or snow boots (or you can buy a pair in NY-- you can probably find a cheap pair of boots for less than $50, and that way you won't be bringing boots you might not need).    If you wear long pants, a long sleeve shirt, and maybe a sweater (which is what we call jumpers in the US), as long as you have a winter coat, you should be fine.  And make sure to wear gloves.    Enjoy your trip!|`|ex5hVYKxaa	jackets,long pants,gloves,boots|`|01b990b6feebbb819d33fb976c859438aa	Boots are good but a good walking shoe can also work.

kMK9E2a7aa	Jane is right, Nerja is my favourite place in Spain. Also close to Nerja is La Herradura and an exquisite place called "Marina del este".

As near as I can figure, it's the only city I'd be interested in seeing...and Beach stuff would be a good thing to do.    If you really aren't looking for beachy...the Ruta de los Pueblos Blancos is a pretty drive, just drive through the towns, and soak up the beauty of the area, enjoy the people of the towns, and some bar goodies...Nothing terribly fancy.     Or you could go to Ronda...lots of biking and hiking in the area.  REALLY pretty town, and if you were interested in history, there's a witchcraft museum that sounds pretty interesting.  Palace of the Mondragn family, Moorish baths, Roman Burial ground.   The star of the town is the Puente Nuevo.  Really spectacular!

Jm3vMKx3aa	With a British passport denoting you being a British citizen you are allowed to stay in the UK as long as you want and you may work.  You also may move, reside and work freely throughout the European Union. For a tourist stay of three month in any EU country no administrative procedures are required. For staying longer than three month to reside and work you must get a permit but whilst an Australian citizen would need to apply for it and it may get approved or disapproved you may just request it since you have the right to get it on your British passport.  For a visa to non-EU countries it does not make much difference. In general the Australian and the UK passport holders are granted the same or similar travel rights. You should check on the IATA database which is provided by aircraft companies so that passengers may check their travel document requirements. For Turkey for example it is better to use the UK passport since it saves about 3.50 entrance fee. Australian citizens must pay US$20 or 15 (about 13.50) whereas British citizens may also pay 10 to get a three-months visa on arrival which is just a stamp in the passport.

6cf0275dfcf47b6a37124ae7cc800816aa	Airlines aren't as altruistic as you are and with so many losing money they're not giving away tickets as freely as they used to for good causes.Typically the recipients of the free tickets are those with good, close relationships with the local Sales teams and/or guaranteeing the airline high visibility and exposure. Your trip doesn't really fall into either of those categories and so I would suggest contacting the Chilean organisation and see if they have a contact within LAN. Good luck.|`|AA11441385	When airlines sponsor community organisations, such as charitable enterprises, that sponsorship often takes the form of free or discounted tickets.  Apply to the community relations department of the airlines.  You will have to make a good case.

She will aslo have to prove where this money is coming from ? it should have the proof of source of income and bank withdrawl slips or a letter from the bank and attested by the ghana customs department.  Anti money laundering laws are very strict and each country can take decisions which may naot be exactly what the law says so please ask your friend no to take such risks. Get an American Express travellers cheque rather. which she can get it from any bank in Ghana, like Barclays bank or Eco Bank. then she can encash that Amex travellers cheque in the US and get the money.|`|H4bYFqwPaa	yes she will. she will have to declare it going through customs. my friend was recently traveling and was caught with a lot of gold that she did not declare. they ended up sending her back to ghana to get a lawyer to prove that she owns the gold. so tell your friend, that she must declare it.

They could give you good info on hotels, get you group discounts, etc.|`|e87d9d696031ff74cbe850d5cecbaaa2aa	I had good luck on SpinCityTravel.com. You can compare all the hotels by amenities and customer feedback. Can't think of any country bars up there off hand. You may have to go to Carpinteria or Goleta. Plenty of sightseeing and great restaurants on State Street. Try the Enterprise or Tupelo Junction Cafe.|`|01828ba3a2ceab3b3b6ed1d24349e9d6aa	try    www.priceline.com
0KR4wyoQaa	Yes of course
xtKEToLHaa	If we Europeans can have the shishkebabs and the baklavas for a cheaper price, yes|`|bLahP9Ivaa	Yes, as a Northern European I think that Turkey as a member of the EU would be a great asset for the EU.     As for NATO, Turkey is a member, and deservedly so.|`|UBNEzh0Saa	If they were European yes.|`|AA11854330	You talk like we're soooooo interested in EU and NATO.  As a Turkish, I don't want Turkey to be the member of those unions.    Theeny: Actually you don't deserve an answer as a troll from me but I'll give it. Now Greeks and Turks live peacefully in Cyprus. In the past, lots of Turks were killed there. Because of that Turkish soliders had to come and defend them. Even that, we only want PEACE. You must accept, Turks are in Cyprus for years, ages, from Ottoman times until today and they'll always be. Because their houses, families, PAST are in Cyprus. It's their RIGHT. Don't say 'Cyprus is Greek' anymore. And we don't say 'Cyprus is Turkish, go out of here Greeks'. Cyprus should be from PEACE. I'm not nationalist. I'm just sick of this stupid issue which came up because of nationalism. You can be sure that I'm objective.|`|h1IYS0dbaa	Your question is silly. A country doesn't "deserve" to be a member state of the EU or NATO. This is not a beauty contest or a football championship.    The membership of a country in these institutions has something to do with interests (the ones of the member state countries and the ones of the country, which should be member or not).    If these interests didn't exist at all, nobody would even talk about Turkey's eventual or factual membership in these institutions.|`|rFseGB3Taa	it is not the matter of Turkey deserves or not.  it is the matter of "Can EU handle 70 million mostly young population"|`|5GyTMstqaa	yes, they are in  NATO, they have the 2nd largets Army in NATO, after the USA, and they have probally the 3rd or 4th best trained and advanved army in NATO  after  USA, UK, France, Germany, or USA, UK, France, Turkey, than germany, however Germany i feel has a way better air Force. but Turkey recently bought 116 or is planning to acquire, 116 f 35 lighting planes...from the USA, soon...    however They are a Canidate for the EU, if you havent figured NATO or the EU, out bascially they are pro Westernized countrys, and pro white westernized views...EU, has almost 500 million people in their countrys..WHile that is  more than half of Europes 731 million People..Turkey allong with Georgia, and The Ukraine, are canidates, i belive a few other countrys are..the Thing with Turkey, is the EU, is for EUROPE, and turkey has never been considered in Europe except for its nothern most part, and its city of iztanbul, or however you spell it...;However Turkey's  population, would add 70 million or so to, Europes population, thus seeing europe as almost 800 million people, this can fix some talk about EU countrys, declinging population..However some do not want turkey in the EU, due to the fact that its the Only country canidate that dosent not have a mainily White population, the nothern part of Turkey however does,, but whats more importnat, the Over all success of EU, or racial groups..however Turkey in the EU, would add further strength, and less Fear of Russia, even though Russia's isnt a threat the EU, there would be no wars or conflict, against the EU, or The  USA, cause Most EU countrys are in NATO, and USA and UK are the backbone of NATO, and all nato countrys, are required to Assit in war, if A country of NATO is attacked, or even if not attacked, most succesors of NATO would join and allies against a threat...    Turkey is the Only Middle Eastern Country other than NATO, that gets allong or has and shares views that the EU and NATO share...Turkey isnt like the rest of the middle east, this is why they can be allowed to be in EU, not only that but they are bordering Europe, which can make them a option
AA10662056	What do you mean by related?    Well, the biggest relation between the 2 countries is ODA which Japan is providing to China.    Japan is donating huge amount of money as ODA to China every year.|`|Q3RqWHFsaa	Chinese government is always more formidable and tougher than Japanese one but they understand the significance of opponent each other well enough to develop its own country power for future.    Politics and economics are not often too related closely. They utilize everything if it is worth to utilize for them and their country even though they don't like it. In addition, anyway, they are both sort of elder and younger brothers in one Asian family.|`|4dfbcf738541ddcd8d3291d2dbbb44deaa	Not even close. The peoples of Japan have a lot of freedoms. The good people of China don't. Japanese have higher wages and better living standards.|`|3ljf1xLlaa	They are both insulted by America's monkey people. Japan and China don't like stupid foreigners behaving like monkeys.|`|eAMbWkahaa	The People's Republic of China is a communist country and Japan is a open democratic country, both have rocky relationships of mostly rivalry.|`|vraDYAPdaa	None mostly, japan is a decromatic country while china is communist... So japan is kinda of like america, except there are more stricter law's.... The only thing they have that are related is that the education is very high.

JpFrdHcqaa	The Calljones refers the Los Angeles Fashion District which is just south of Downtown, north east of the intersection of the 10 and the 110. The easiest way to get there is to exit the 10 on Walnut and go north. You'll go through the main part. The actual alleys are on either side of Walnut.    http://www.fashiondistrict.org/ will give you a map indicating which stores tend to be found in a given area.|`|ac7e0f50f58632b431b5cf5de0564ffbaa	Take 5 or 101 south to LA. Then take the 110 south. Exit Olympic. Make a couple right turns so that you are heading east on Olympic. The Alleys are just south of Olympic, by Santee Street.
