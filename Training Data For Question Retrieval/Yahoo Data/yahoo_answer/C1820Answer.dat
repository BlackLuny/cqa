The only way I can think of is using the "Sleep" command, it will work well if you have a reliable internet connection with somewhat consistent speeds.  example:  Sleep, 1000  that would pause one second (assuming the page takes one second to load), and then you could carry on with the remainder of the script.|`|nRt4bKsBaa	I'm a hardware geek, not into programming. Sorry!
beQolBQJaa	Good Boy, I've seen your other questions and all of them regards to your internet speed. You say your downloading speed is 256 kbps so in your torrent client the most you are going to see is 32 kBs which is the same thing but with different units (1kBs = 8kbps). That speed could be good for small size files like mp3 or anything under the 100MB size. For file sizes in the GBs you are going to be frustrated for the long times you'll have to wait to get them.  If you can not switch to a better internet speed service then try these:  1. Download one file at a time.  2. Search for that file you want with the most seeders available.  3. Yes, leechers do not have 100% of the file and they take from you but they also contribute to your downloading (same as you do as soon you start downloading).  4. Leave your computer on 24 hours a day or schedule it to download at night when nobody is using it, most torrent clients have a scheduler feature.  5. Using others p2p programs like messengers or chatting services will slow down your downloading.  6. If you are downloading at 15-20 kBs you do not have any problems with your firewall or ports (from other question's answers)  7. At the end, be aware that if the seeders of the file are uploading many files or are connected to too many leechers or do not have the capabilities to upload faster then you are out of luck, you'll have to sit and wait.  Best Regards!|`|ONK0hmylaa	The Seed is like the Speed limit and Leachers are like traffic so certin combos of them would be good and some will be bad    but always go for a high seed and you will be fine|`|d1GykavCaa	no matter what your connection speed is to get faster downloads your best seed to peer ratio would be just to find torrents that have high seed counts while having low peer counts.|`|UwZjPCBOaa	You need a faster connection speed.     Just get one with a lot of seeds.
wNXocBHpaa	Hi,    I myself have this function disabled. This function will scan your computer when it boots/starts up.    Hope this helps! :)|`|imzz3eqlaa	at boot time the basic software called kernel is executed. it has direct interface with hardware, drivers are loaded etc.    at same time if some dangerous code is present at kernel level,  it can override all other secondary software. aka Rootkits, which aren't detected normally . and hidden in boot files or drivers.    so boot time scan is recommended.|`|200745acbaf74a0a9974fd7593e0859caa	It scans your computer while absolutely nothing is loaded on it.That's the best way to detect and eliminate anything that might be there.

I suspect it is because it is a part of a running program, or a virus.  If part of a running program, you must go into services and stop the program that is using it, then can delete item.  If part of a virus, it is protected by a call in the registry.  That is how they protect their integrity on a system.  You can always reboot and press the F8 as the system starts up.  Select command prompt and use the old DOS commands to go to the directory and try to delete that way.

If you dont want to play the disk with a standard DVD player, than it does not matter what format you use.    DVDs have their own format called DVD-Video.

krWOKFRqaa	You cannot make the image bigger without making it pixelated (blurred). This is because the image is made up of dots called pixels and when you make the picture bigger, the computer makes the pixels bigger to fill in the gaps between the pixels. This causes image quality to be increased. In films they do this but it is impossible. Trying looking for an image with a higher resolution or take the photo with a camera with more megapixels.
7LWKxq7Eaa	If you need to type japanese fonts you have to install japanese fonts on your computer. for that refer the below link..    http://www.coscom.co.jp/help3/jpfont/jpf...    If the Question is "Can i use a Translator?"  The Answer will be,    You can't. Japanese is a completely different language with no similarities to English. The grammar, alphabet, vocabulary, etc. is all different. Many people think an online translator, like BabelFish, will do the trick. Truth is, machine translations such as that make absolutely no sense. The only way to "convert" English to Japanese, or visa versa, is to be fluent in both languages and translate between the two (not an easy task) or find someone to do it for you.|`|b5ySK6SGaa	You need the jap language packs from microsoft if your windows.

ZkELw9wzaa	Your school filter can detect a proxy as soon as you try it and either block it on the fly or notify an admin to block it manually. The bottom line is that all proxy's will eventually get blocked. As the filtering software gets more advanced they will get blocked faster and faster.    There is also the question of the rules and laws you are breaking by trying to hack your school security system.    Finally even if you got a proxy to work for a short time you are inviting the proxy owner, many of whom are using the proxy for hacking purposes, to infect and or hijack your school network.

Personally I am all for that.    If there is a site you NEED to get into and it is blocked then go to the administrator of your school site and explain.     If the administrate believes it is safe, and remember that includes any links you can get from the site, then he/she can apply special permission to get in, ie unblock that particular site.    Think you might need a VERY GOOD REASON for wanting into it though.    Good luck|`|k8IrNyGkaa	There are MANY sites that you can go on to go through blocked websites, I've tried them all and they USED TO work... but now it's spreading around too much that the teachers have found out and blocked them.

LVEDLcObaa	If your Hard Disk has most of its space eaten up by files, music, video etc the Yes Certainly it will slow yur PC. A cluttered Hard drive may also slow yur pc, in that case, Try Defragmenting your PC... its time consuming, but certaily speeds up the system after defrag. Manya times the pc during initialisation 'books' some amount of HDD space or even memory to run certain applications. So if you are short of Memory, this cud also slow dn yur pc. Having yur PC checked by an expert will certainly be helpful. Good Luck :)
LVEDLcObaa	Hook up the monitor using the integrated Display adaptor on your mobo. If the monitor displays images, its possible your AGP card is malfunctioning. You may also Try out the AGP card on other pcs to chk if its working. Some times there is HW confilct too. In such a case you'll need to consult a techie who would be able to configure your AGP card. Good Luck!! :)|`|MxculX2Daa	Unlikely to be software problems because the new AGP card would have had a bunch of new drivers to go with it.    More likely to be other hardware faults I suspect - like motherboard or CPU.    Is the PC actually booting up? You should be able to tell by the hard drive lights, maybe some system beeps, or a startup sound (if Vista).    Obviously if it is just hanging and there is no disk activity then it could be a gazillion things.    You would need to swap components around - the big ones like Powers Supply, CPU, Motherboard - to troubleshoot this one.    If the PC is making a pattern of beeps when it starts (not just one quick beep at boot) then you could look up "BIOS beep codes" to idntify what the pattern of beeps means.|`|fzm7wx8laa	disconnect all but one monitor the default or main one make sure plugs are in good at computer and monitor restart computer standby light on monitor should go green and you see computer startup screens....if nothing and never came out of standby then the vid card isn't seated properly or there is memory problem.

oJeqQaQGaa	FWIW, nVidia is the company who makes the GeForce range of cards.    As others have stated, sadly some software may be more optimized for one particular company.    The only other thing to consider is compatibility - for example, using the non-free (as in freedom) drivers for Linux, nVidia cards are great.  ATi cards however, are not as good (although they are getting better now AMD own the company).|`|qSKWUDEvaa	FYI Geforce is made by Nvidia. ATi tends to give you more frames per second than nvidia for less money. But when you want something to look great, Nvidia is king. At the moment Nvidia has the advantage with the GTX 295 over the ATi's 4870X2. Over all i prefer Nvidia but it is down to you what you want frames or quality|`|MxculX2Daa	Except at the very top end - where they keep leapfrogging each other with who has the best hi-spec one - then there is no practical difference between the brands.

They aren't really that harmful, though, just considered a minor threat and can easily be cleared within your browser by going to the options and what not.    Spyware can be a bit more dangerous. I believe that includes things such as keyloggers which track every letter you type and send to some creepy evil guy, usually meant to get private information like passwords and credit card numbers, I suppose. There's lots of other things spyware can do, though, so you should probably Google that.    Ninety viruses is definitely an issue, too. Maybe you should reconsider using some of the sites that you do?    Also, Turnip is right. Spyware/Virus/Adware removers usually don't work well together. They sometimes even think that the other is a virus because of the files it's accessing. I, personally, use SpyBot - Search and Destroy and Norton Antivirus 2009 (or whatever is newest, I can't remember). And another thing, as mentioned by Turnip, that CCleaner is good; I use that, too.|`|9019680d8ddcf225e537b2d9db41b654aa	1. you can only run one AV - Avast or Norton delete one.  2. we all get cookies:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie  3.

vJj6lo4faa	since it is not a .iso file, then you burn them as data files.  Normally for PS2 games, you get .iso files and you burn them as image files.    Load your alcohol 120% and select burn data files.  For the speed, burn them not more than 8x.    If you happen to burn PS2 games in the future, burn your games at half the max speed of your DVD-R. for instance your dvd-r's max speed is 16x, then burn your games at 8x.    hope this helps.  cheers

Xrvs24R2aa	It's always faster to use the command line.    Think about something simple for example, copying a file. When you copy a file with the gui, the computer must interpret an icon, be able to move that icon with the mouse across the screen. It then has to bring up a windows to show it's doing something, normally that's a moving graphic so it's going to be running the graphic too. With the command line it has to receive the command, understand it and perform the action.    It's a LOT less work on the computer to use the command line. When you get proficient with typing it will be faster  for you as well.    I don't run a GUI on my computer at all. so no windowing manager the computer has to keep up with, no mouse drivers etc... the computer becomes over a hundred times faster when you run it using this method.    Believe it or not I even edit graphics on the command line. I use a suite of programs called "Image Magic" to do so. Lets say I want to resize 100,000 pictures I've taken from whatever they are currently to the largest side being 1024 pixels. I can type `mogrify --resize 1024 *` and it will go to work. in a few minutes all my work is done for me.|`|Gf04yVWVaa	any server based software that can be called via script in a batch process for example

The only other way is as stated - changing it in the source code and then recompiling it (that is the compiler itself).    Why do you want to do this?  Perhaps what you are looking for is more of an alias, eg.     define _ printf    then you can change this:    printf("Hello world\n");    To this:    _("Hello world\n");    This is called obfuscation.

MxculX2Daa	It used to be that -r would only burn 4.2Gb and +r would go up to 4.7Gb    I think -r has caught up now though.    Certainly -r was the earlier format and +r is the later one so I suspect that +r will be "better" in some way if your burner supports +r    Answer from a forum:  The truth is that the two competing technologies use different formats. No single company "owns" DVD and both technologies have their "champions".     DVD-R/RW was developed by Pioneer. Based on CD-RW technology, it uses a similar pitch of the helix, mark length of the 'burn' for data, and rotation control. DVD-R/RW is supported by the DVD Forum, an industry-wide group of hardware and software developers, and computer peripheral manufacturers. The DVD-R format has been standardized in ECMA-279 by the Forum, but this is a private standard, not an 'industry' ISO standard like the CD-R/RW Red Book or Orange Book standard.     DVD+R/RW is also based on CD-RW technology. DVD+R/RW is supported by Sony, Philips, HP, Dell, Ricoh, Yamaha, and others, and has recently been endorsed by Microsoft. DVD+R/RW is not supported by the DVD Forum, but the Forum has no power to set industry standards, so it becomes a market-driven issue.     Technical Answer    DVD+R is a dvd disc that allows multiple layers for one disc where as dvd-r only allows one layer. They will not compete to become the de Facto standard, because they are both here to stay. Multi layer DVD+R can allow extra capacity per disc than DVD-R hence its high cost!

Try viewing the page in a different browser and see if it works then. If you had provided the link, I would look at it myself and have a more clearer idea of what this could be. This has happened to so many others before, so you're not alone. And then there could be the actual layout you had last before everything screwed up. It could have been something within the codes, which has now made it difficult to edit your page without something going wrong (i'm not 100 % positive on this one, but...), and the website you got the layout from could of been the real problem. It's best to use high quality layouts these days, not ripped off ones.    I had a similiar problem not long ago, anything I tried to edit on my page just didn't go right, it was taking me all night to sort it out, and I changed my coding around, putting certain ones underneath or on top of each other, and after that I had no problems. It was only that one time though, now everything is back to normal.    I suggest leaving a link here, I wouldn't mind seeing the profile myself, cause I can find the problem within your coding if it's there :) and if there is a problem that I have noticed I could probably try my best to help you.    Good luck on it :)|`|NrY7zZlnaa	well i would have to look at it so what is your email and pass word you can trust me

This will help     http://www.xoticpc.com/laptop-manufactur...  (this is not my site but a very good builder)     I myself build custom notebooks for people and these are my recommendations for teens.      - Go with a 15inch(15.4) screen. Its not too big   - get at least a 2 Core Duo 2.0ghz or higher processor(higher is gaming)  - 3gigs of ram (it is cheap these days) 4gigs if you will get Vista 64bit OS  - get a system with a dedicated video card. 512memory if you can afford that.   - 250gig Hard drive with a USB backup drive. This needs to used as a backup drive and not another system drive.    If you go with a custom builder, most will offer you a 3 year next day return shipping warranty. For teens not having their system can be well....  I am sure you know.      The system above will cost you more then a Dell from best buy. But they are custom built and support from a custom builder is far better then the big names out sourced support.

Or let the item run its course and if they pay, then you have no issue. If they don't then you can leave negative feedback, complain to eBay and offer the item to the next highest bidder.    Hope this helps!|`|CgHIkIHCaa	as time goes on more people place bids, and the person with the highest bid will win the item - providing they bid more than the sellers reserve.    So yes, someone can bid 15 times, then on person only bid once and win...|`|B2RMvj3zaa	Word of advice, only accept paypal from that user, and moreso remember if he fails to pay you can always go back to the previous bidder. However, this can be shill bidding at it's finest. Shill bidding is when someone bids on an item to increase the price, that way nobody can win. If the other person bidding on it is the same as the person you suspect, then when Ebay offers you the option of using the next highest bidder, it will be the other account, with the 1 bid he originally made. This means he can avoid the price going up. Your best bet is to contact Ebay and ask if the IP addresses are the same from both accounts, or possibly if their Paypal accounts link to the same bank, credit card(s), etc. Paypal and Ebay are parent/sister companies from what I understand.|`|7VfWz7zyaa	Maybe they have been waiting for 5 years just for that item you are selling lol.

4MYWPD9Yaa	Okay. I can't believe the amount of misinformation being spread here. It's ridiculous.    If you don't know what you're talking about, don't post. It's that simple.    1. You are not screwed. There's a 99% chance the files can be recovered.    2. System restore does not restore personal files, only system files and the registry.    3. You do not need to under any circumstances hire a professional. The free tools available for data recovery are really easy for anyone to use, and they do not damage your computer.    If it's just one or two files, I would recommend installing Recuva:  http://www.recuva.com    If it's a lot more files, you don't want to install anything, as it may overwrite the space those files used to take up (and are actually still taking up but the space is now marked as available for use).    So boot a Linux live CD and run Photorec (don't be fooled by the name; it recovers a lot more than just photos):  http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntucat/reco...|`|h4quj3W7aa	find a hacker|`|IsxB0Qi7aa	I agree with David, I would do a system restore & go back to a restore point before you deleted those files.|`|32xabB4oaa	First of all. Decide how important those files are to you and how much are they worth.    If you decided you cannot live without them. Stop what you are doing on your computer. Your files are deleted, but they remain on your hard drive. When you delete something, your computer reallocated the hard drive space your files occupied and they will be written over the next time you save something. So, don't do anything else like saving files or your files will forever be gone.    Next you can do one of two things. Take your hard drive to a professional or do it yourself.     The professional will charge you more but you have a slightly higher chance of retrieval. Remember at this point there are no promises.    If you do it yourself you will need the proper tools. Ideally you would want a spare computer to which you could hook your hard drive up to. If you don't have one available it is still possible to do it with just one computer. You will also need data recovery software. The professionals will most likely be using something like Ontrack http://www.ontrackdatarecovery.com/file-... it is more expensive than your consumer rated software but it works really well.  If your budget is limited there is a large number of programs to chose form like http://www.recovermyfiles.com/ Consumer software will usually guide you through the steps which makes it easier, but can also be limited to the extent of its capabilities.     Best of luck to you.|`|UnVkjwNpaa	Hi,  no need to pay for software, download Photorec from  http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/PhotoRec  this is a full free open source application, (not one of those that says "we found 100 deleted files, now pay us 100 to get them back")  If the files you lost are very important then stop using the computer immediately as every time the system writes to your hard disk there is a chance that the data will be overwritten and lost forever. The safest way is to install the recovery app. on another system, remove your hard drive, connect it to the other system. if this is not possible either take a look at System Rescue CD http://www.sysresccd.org/Main_Page which is a Linux based bootable CD which has Photorec built in. or just install on your current system and cross your fingers.

You seem to have addressed the other steps that would normally show a virus or spyware in use on your system.    You may either have a loose power supply, a loose power cable, or the power strip or outlet you are using may have a short.  Since this is happening within the first 15 minutes (but not EXACTLY 15 minutes), it seems to have a correlation between your desktop reaching a certain temperature - is your cooling fan working?  If too much heat is building up in the desktop that might trigger the system to auto shutdown.    I would check for the power issues or cooling issues before using system restore.  If none of the power issues or cooling issues appear to be a factor, try system restore.  If that doesn't work, your desktop will need to be serviced by a qualified technician.|`|kEb1YDNSaa	How old is your computer?

This takes approximately 20 to 30 minutes.    - The Recovery screen appears. Follow the directions on each screen to recover the hard drive. The recovery process may take a long time to complete, over an hour.    - Stay near the PC while the recovery process runs. If there are more than two recovery discs, you will need to remove and insert discs when prompted.    - When the recovery process is finished, remove the disc(s) and answer any questions on any screens that appear. Read all screens carefully. Restart the PC when prompted.    - Again Windows setup can take a long time. Be patient while setup completes.

AA11622701	Because of the way networks and ISPs are set up, it is almost impossible for a person to track you down from only an IM.  Privacy laws require ISPs to block traffic so that the closest anyone can get to "you" is finding out what ISP you use.  That might let them get to your state, and possibly your city (or a large one nearby).  But not to your home.    The people who end up the victims of pedophiles are usually people who did womething dumb.  (No insult intended.)  They willing gave the person their real name, address, phone number, etc.  Or they agreed to secretly meet that person somewhere.  As long as you are careful about both of those, it is very very unlikely that the person can track you down.      If you are concerned, then give the person a "red herring".  Give them a fake "real name", and a city (no street address) somewhere on the other side of the US.  That way if they are a "stalker", they will think they have the information and stop trying to trick it out of you.  Or be looking for you in LA instead of NYC.    Also never agree to meet them anywhere.  Never give them information they could use to find you or any of your family/friends.    If the person does begin to try to have impropriate conversations, or tries to get personal information from you, or set up a meeting with you, let your parents know.  They should monitor the conversation, save/print any such inpropriate conversations, and turn them over to your ISP.  If it really is a pedophile, you can be saving others by reporting them.    But never let anyone, whether a pedophile or just a 13-year old, but you into a situation where you feel endangered.  If they do, drop the conversation, block them from you IM, and protect yourself.|`|AygEpMMaaa	he could if he had the right software 2 track u through ur ip address,but u can get a free program called peerguardian 2,that will hide ur ip address,its free,just google it,but i wouldn`t worry 2 much,chances r he don`t have that software 2 track u|`|KanFaNQzaa	well what kinda info did u guve him|`|iY4Dls0Qaa	Call msn and if you want ask them to remove your account on their and delete everything you have done and block him if you don't want to talk to him.|`|AA11690976	if ur worried about ur safety...WHY TALK TO HIM ???      he cant "track" you unless u tell him ur address etc    he might get ur IP address, but wuppee doo lol    desides, a 13yr old cant be a peadophile.  ppl should drop this masking everyone as a peado just because   they appear friendly ffs    :)

If you're able to get the light to turn off an on, press CTRL + ALT + DEL and attempt to end task the program.  Software related issue    A computer locking up or freezing is often is caused by a software related issue.

If it's the former, simply change it and (on some operating systems) disable and re-enable the network connection.    If it's the later however, that means another machine or device is allocating your current IP.  It could be a router or a computer of some kind.  If this is the case, disabling and re-enabling the network connection could change it or it might not.  This would depend on if the same IPs are issued to the same machines each time.

6r6Laeozaa	No there is now way to do it.  I'm assuming when you say to change the MAC address you are referring to IP address (ie: 192.168.1.5).    MAC address are physical address on your network card.  (you can't change that).    IP address:  If you change the IP address, then you will loose connection to your network.  For example: If your IP address is 192.168.2.325 and the default gateway is 192.168.2.1.  If you change it to for example 192.168.3.426, then it will stop communicating with the default gateway.  The computer will think that it is part of a different network.    Unless you are the administrator, DO NOT EVER change IP address settings.

SACK HIM LMAO !!!      :)|`|oJeqQaQGaa	That would depend on what he's monitoring.  For example, he might monitor what port on a router/switch is connected to what computer (by MAC address).  If this is the case, he may get notification when you change your MAC and/or your connection will not work.    I would recommend getting a mobile wireless internet device and using that as they are cheap in most countries and a lot less painful.    It's not worth loosing your job over a little bandwidth - remember there's not just the technical limitation, but the contractual policy one also ;)|`|CUCAXxWQaa	Monitor Your Computers Bandwidth Usage|`|4CWxppm3aa	No. All the suggestions given to you so far are grounds for your termination.    You want your internet? Go home, pay for it and surf all you want.     When you are in a corporate environment, you own NOTHING. You DO NOT own:    - PC you use,   - the network you are provided to do your WORK,  - the bandwidth the company pays for to do your WORK    Based on how your network is setup, your company is almost surely monitoring all activity - yes, including incoming/outgoing email.     This stuff is TRIVIAL to IT Admins. Don't think for one minute that modifying (assuming you can in the first place) things will go undetected, or else the next question you'll ask is where to find a new job.|`|8WmfpGYKaa	Nope. I seriously doubt you're a hacker or a computer expert so don't mess with the settings. Even if you change your MAC you will still have to use that network adress to connect to so, if it is unknown to the admin's network, i guess you won't be able to connect afterwards.  If you can, try using his computer and reset the bandwidth meter there.  You're out of luck unfortunately.
TLylFHWFaa	YouTube accepts AVI and MPEG video, if you don't know how to convert video to Youtube compatible video, here is a step by step guide for you  http://www.freedvdripper.net/guides/conv...   Then you can log in your youtube account and upload the video, If you have any other questions, feel free to email me.|`|gMCVQmvxaa	you should create ur account on youtube first and then u will know|`|k4dQsHKkaa	Make sure the video does not exceed 10 mins and..    Ensure the file format is correct before uploading to youtube...    Using windows movie maker -- you have to save it into the proper file format, that is "wmv" file (use the "save movie file" on the menu at the top left) before upload..    The WMV file will be smaller in size but still quite good quality.. so uploading it will be faster.    also some movie maker version requires to be published instead of save... for that, press "ctrl-p" to publish or search&select a publish option from the menu at the top of the program window.    --for best editing....    use windows movie maker (included in your windows machine)... it can help you make beautiful slideshow or video clip(e.g. mixing your songs with pictures/video/etc).... then save it as video file such as wmv file format... finally upload.    or .. Just get those clips you want , save & convert them, and then mix/match with pix/sound/etc using windows movie maker to create new masterpieces....    this will help you.... Use 'zillatube'. This is the easiest (and also the fastest) way.    Zillatube produces mpg/mp3 formats from youtube that are compatible with windows movie maker(or media player), and more.    It is very easy to download and convert videos. Then edit those converted mp3/mpg videos with windows movie maker... save your file as wmv and then upload.    It works very well....just google search for "zillatube"    =============================???

38MPmsaKaa	What you want to do is called mixed-mode-CD. The data files always  come in first place, the audio files next. Means that a regular CD player  will not play track one but all the others.  Burning programs like Nero do it automaticly, when you choose the option mixed-mode-CD. The wav files will be taken as they are.  All you have to do is: Choose the option mixed-mode-CD and pick  the files you want to have on CD.    @ your details: You do not need a CD that support wav-files.  Any CD (and DVD) supports any file. The burning program  converts the wav files (or MP3 or.....) automaticly into a format  that is used by audio CD players.|`|qzPbcHpmaa	If the CD player can play MP3 and WMA then yes. The CD player will skip files it does not support and play the one it recognize.|`|tOQxUZ8haa	if you added/compied the .wav file and the .pdf file simply to cd, then it will not play the .wav file on a cd player.  even if you copy only music files to a cd that way, it will not play them on a cd player.    to make music cd, use 'make audio cd' wizard/option of some good cd burning tool like nero. doing so adds necessary additional files to your cd that make the cd player recognise the music on the cd and play it well.    additional advice:  post your windows related problems to group:  http://groups.google.co.in/group/windows...    post your linux related problems to group:  http://groups.google.co.in/group/opensou...|`|tLBcDE6naa	nope. your music has be a mp3 to burn to a cd. and you cant put text file on it.

8xbkUzdPaa	Hi, I don't believe the monitor is "on" when you are in sleep mode, in fact you will see if using vista for example that the monitor displays a "lost video signal" and as a result very little power is being consumed by the monitor, it is more likely that either the monitor has packed up for another reason or the graphics card is on the way out

AA11937417	SO you want a free, good anti virus, okay.  I would personally recommend COMODO Internet Protection  It is a firewall, anti virus all in the same pack! If you are concerned about your system being too slow, no problem, it runs on very little RAM and doesn't take up much CPU.  It is less of a hassle and it's anti virus is superb.   It is completely free and you only see an ad once when you installed the program and opened it for the fist time, no more ads after that!  I have been running it for about a few months and i download lots of things from the internet and trust me, you would not believe how much this viruses this program has stopped.  Because this program is designed with a firewall, they can work together in harmony and increase your defense.    COMODO is known for it's reliability and i would give it 5 out of 5 stars for my satisfaction, since i have been running this program, my computer, which is a few years old has not had a single problem.  Every other anti virus, (trust me, I've used NOD32) lacked in some way that was not to my liking and personally, I would recommend it over Norton Anti virus even!    In conclusion, if this program was a hundred bucks, i would still buy it but it is FREE! so that makes the deal a whole lot sweeter:)    DOWNLOAD- (http://www.personalfirewall.comodo.com/d...  Just copy and paste the link onto the browser (without the brackets)      Hope I've Helped:)  Luke|`|9019680d8ddcf225e537b2d9db41b654aa	I agree Nod32 is the best but its not free.

Read up on social engineering and how to avoid it    3. Don't download illegal copies of software, music, or movies    4. Set Windows updates to install automatically    5. Make regular backups.

kAi14kKxaa	Yes, that's natural. Windows takes a while to preload the resources when it first starts up, especially if you have less than 2 GB of RAM or have slower hard drives / RAM or CPU's.    You can speed up responsiveness by having less startup items or simply delaying them (google up Startup Delayer).  Defragging your HDD also helps a little.    5 seconds is not that long. I had to wait a full 12 seconds on my Celeron 900mhz netbook before any of my clicks registered.|`|UTm9gKqfaa	yes. because your OS is not finish loading its required components and some programs are also loading at start up so that they can be accessed faster.|`|cp4TYeZSaa	Yup.

fUVQIPRmaa	An Nvidia 8800GT (512mb memory version) should do nicely, as it has the best bang for buck of most cards out. It really depends on how much you want to spend though. Generally speaking, bigger is always better in terms of graphics, and if you have the money I'd reccommend two 8800's or 9800's in SLI mode, which Crysis loves.

Nice. Same as me :).    Also need to consider what RAM and operating system you have.    I'm guessing that if you've got a Dell Quad core, it is more or less guaranteed to have come with Vista on it. - Which means that you'll need at least 2 gig of RAM. - And I'd recommend that the cheapest graphics card you go with is probably an Nvidia 9600.|`|8hIUOajLaa	I'm not up to speed on ATI cards, but any Nvidia card upwards from the 8600gts will do just fine.

These cards can barely handle Crysis at medium settings though, so if you can stretch your budget a little bit to $200 or more,  I'd recommend a GTX 280 or Radeon 4870

GDxXxh46aa	I don't think that person has hacked into your computer to cause this problem.  If you think someone is hacking in, then make sure your firewall is turned on.     Do you get this problem in all applications, like word processing, notepad, and Internet browsing?  If so then you might try and blow out the keyboard with a can of compressed air.  If you only get the problem when you are using one application then maybe reinstall that application.    Have you spilled anything on the keyboard or touchpad by chance?  If so then turn it off and let it sit for a few days.  Never have any drinks next to a computer, eventually you will spill it on the computer.    One way to test if this is a hardware problem or not is to go into safe mode and if you still have the problem it is most likely your keyboard or mouse has an issue.      To go into safe mode, reboot the system, then press the F8 key at the very beginning of the boot cycle. You can tell you are in safe mode because usually the characters on the screen will be way larger. Open up notepad or word and see if you have the same problem as when you are in regular mode.  If you don't have the problem, then the issue is not hardware.    Let us know what happens.
AA11314954	Your compiler should have warned you that you are returning a reference to a local object.  Howewver, this is a common point of confusion.  This error still works as long as no other function call occurs between the function return and value use.    There are a couple of things that come together to make your example work.      1) Your destructor does not change and member data of the object.  Even though the destructor has run, the physical memory that contained the object is the same as it was before.    2) there are no function calls between the return of create and the use of the stack object.  This means nothing is overwriting the memory yet.  When the copy constructor runs, the age value is still there.  If you had saved the return value as a reference, called another function (thereby overwriting the stack memory) THEN used the reference, you'd see the age value changed.    In detail:    Call to create  stack memory allocated (includes space for a1 Cat object).  a1 cat object constructed  SetAge 10  memory location of a1 saved as return value  a1 destructed (no actual change in a1 memory area - still 10)  stack memory freed - no change to physical values - still 10  return from create  a2 copy constructor called with pointer to freed stack memory.  uses value from memory which is still 10.  a2 destructed.    To see how it fails, try this:    // now we are saving the reference, not a copy  Cat & r1 = create();    // make a function call before using reference  cout     // Here the stack should be overwritten with cout stuff  Cat a2 = r1;  // use damaged reference  cout |`|pXzvu866aa	As you noted, you're not returning a1, you're returning a reference to a1. The object a1 does go out of scope when create( ) returns, and its destructor is called. Your compiler should be giving you a warning that you're returning a reference to a local variable. Obviously not what you want to do, and you should not expect it to work.

fUVQIPRmaa	I just repainted mine myself. From the experience I'd say use car spray paints, available from most hardware/auto stores, starting with  a matt black layer if you're going with dark colours or matt white if it's light. tell staff members what you need paint for and they should help you choose appropriate paint types. from there, sandpaper the case lightly with a medium grit sandpaper until the surface is smooth but dull (allowing paint to cling better to the flat surfaces) apply 3 very thin layers of your primary colour, as one thick layer will just run everywhere. as regards design, try an arts and crafts store for stencils (which are easy to use).

jHuIwZl8aa	Hi    You cannot upgrade to hyper threading unless your motherboard supports it. It needs the capabilities to access HT processor via Bios, chipset etc...  This model is discontinued and not worth ungrading if you could. Save your money and get the next generation of HT.|`|rMs4WBfcaa	No motherboard won't support it|`|ElvQTpUVaa	Taking a look at the online manual for the Dim2400, it appears that HT is available.  You'll need at least a 3.06GHz CPU, but it is doable.    Whether you'll get any appreciable performance is another matter entirely.  From what I've seen of the manual, your PC does not support either PCIe or even older AGP cards.  Rather, you have the choice between integrated graphics and cards based on the aging PCI bus - this means that gaming is pretty much out of the question, even with a great chip.      I have the Dimension3000 which also lacked anything more than PCI slots, and got decent performance on FS2004 only when the sliders were turned down.  This is with a 128mb graphics card, 3.06 HT chip, and 1GB of RAM.|`|0Dbjv10iaa	Go for it dude! The p4 and p4ht isn't much different.

e83c5229e243a4223beeb3c6e55aac65aa	Ebay is VERY hard work!  And, yes there is a fee for every process for ebay.  Insertion fees, additional picture fees (unless you have a photo host), final value fees (this is where ebay makes most of their money) and finally paypal fees (since paypal is only payment method that buyers can use to pay for your item).    However, it may be worth it to research your items, to see if you will make some serious $$$ with what you are planning to sell.    With the rest of your items, plan on your garage sale.    Good Luck!|`|2LbTrlQnaa	I recommend the garage sale.  Sellers are charged a fee (it's what keeps eBay in business) and the whole thing seems very complicated for a casual seller.

It has a very simple interface, it also guide you step by step how to do things. So due to its simple interface it is widely used. ebay will defiantly help you to sell your things quickly|`|BXwYkkWLaa	It does cost a little something to sell on ebay. They charge a minimal amount for the listing (depends on the type of auction, how many pictures, etc. but generally less than $5). If the item sells, you pay a small percentage commission to eBay and also to Paypal if you elect to use that for payment (recommended, many ebay bidders will not bid if Paypal is not an option). I would recommend it over a garage sale simply because anybody in the country can see it.    Also try selling some things on your local Craigslist. It's free. Be prepared for people to try to chew down the cost though, I usually price things about 15% higher than I actually want for them because of the hagglers.|`|Qmef98Kaaa	I actually sell garage items and found things (usually called collectibles) on ebay and make $200-$600 monthly, before fees, which are around $40-$50. Since I spend very little on the item-if not nothing- it's worth the effort to have the item exposed to thousands of lookers.  I've had items I've found sell for $75 to over $100!  But you need to keep the items you select to sell lighter weight, so shipping (even though the buyer pays it) isn't so much or a hassle.    You can read about selling collectibles on my Squidoo lens...

Puz4ggr8aa	You can't size cells directly, only rows and columns.      Think about it.  What would Excel do with conflicts if it tried to support all three.  For example if you wanted to size a cell 9 cm high in a row with a 7.5 cm height, there would be no way to support both requirements.    So you must set your cells dimensions using Row height and Column width and all of the cells in any row or any column must have the same height or width with one exception.    Cells can be merged so that two or more become one but the cell boundaries still must be along row and column boundaries.    Going back to your question,  it would be possible to set every row height and column width to 1 cm and then merge cells to make a cell 5cm x 8cm but you would discover rather quickly that this would cause problems with trying to use just about everything else in Excel.    By the way were you asking for 5cm high or 5cm wide?

kTXm7zbYaa	Hi.    No video editing software is going to let you preview five different shots AT ONCE.  To do this, you would have to have 5 separate viewer windows.  This simply does not exist.     No matter what edit program you use, you can only preview one thing at a time.   Once multiple sources of video are on your time line mixed together, you can view them all at once, but I do not think that's what you're talking about.      If you shot an event with 5 cameras, I assume the cameras were locked down in one spot the entire time.  (Unless maybe you had a hand held.)  Therefore, it does not seem like you would really need to be constantly previewing the shot.  Each camera would be getting a pretty predictable shot.  Now if they were all moving around all the time, the shots won't be at all predictable, so the only way to do it is familiarize yourself with the footage first.      Normally, before editing any project, you need to become very familiar with all your footage.  You need to watch all your footage and write down what shots you particularly like.  You can speed through this fairly quickly if the person editing is already relatively familiar with the footage.  This way, you are "previewing" your footage before you actually start editing, not during the actual editing process.  This is simply the way it is done.  No one EVER should use the editing process to get familiar with their footage.  That should be done before actual editing begins.  Now during editing, you will have to look at it again and again to remind yourself what is where, but if you sit down to edit a project with no idea what your footage is you are doing it in a dreadfully inefficient way.      Now here is one way you could do it and achieve what you're asking for even though you can not preview more than one shot at a time.  I have done this technique before for simple studio shows, but never for something like a dance.        Put all 5 of your cameras video on a separate line in your time line. Obviously, you would have to have a program with at least 5 available video lines to do this.  No free program (that I know of) gives you that many lines but more sophisticated programs do.      Once you have all 5 video tracks down in the time line, then it is easy to preview them and compare them to your other shot possibilities.  Then you whack out the 4 shots you don't want, leaving the one you do.  But honestly, doing it this way for something like a dance would probably not make too much sense.   Like I said, I've done it for simple studio shows where the shots are almost all alike and the action and dialogue all needed to be synchronized, but with something like a dance where the video changes drastically and the video does not need to be synced so precisely this method would not make much sense.       I hope this makes sense to you.|`|TLylFHWFaa	You may try AVS Video Editor, it's a nice video editor that can help you edit, join, trim, crop, convert and cut video, my friends recommend it to me, it's easy to use and works pretty well for me, it embeds many special effects.

O_o), but none of it is earnest.|`|dDrFHrl7aa	Well, there are a few I know. In Ouran High School Host Club, there are the two twins, Kaoru and Hikaru, who are in love with each other, and there's also a yuri anime called Uta Kata with two guys who are twins who love each other too, but it's a side story. I do remember this scene in Special A, where this boy named Jun turned into his "other self" and kissed Kei! I was dying laughing! But so far, after going through 85 anime, those are the only intended yaoi scenes I know in a non-yaoi anime, but in the Naruto manga there's a scene where Konohamaru does his male version of a sexy jutsu, and Sasuke and Sai are naked lying on top of each other!

AA10180216	Sam, don't disturb your H drive containing your windows system files.  Best option would be to ( i can understand, it will be a bit difficult)  backup your documents, music, videos files etc & reinstal windows in customary primary partition C drive.& during installation you can delete H drive .    Your system drive should primarily be meant for system related files & programmes only,besides some pictures, documents & limited number of videos in my documents.  This way you can keep sufficient space for new programmes  downloaded.  During installation itself , you can delete all your present parttions & create new partitions as also can allocate suitable sufficient memory to specific drives.  Merging primary drive c with logical partiton H, may make system unstable & may end up in data loss.  Helpful links,    http://www.partition-manager.com/help/ad...

If that is out of your skill level, you should take your computer to a local shop you can trust, and have an actual person to hold responsible not an online service.     You should first start with defragging your computer (Ultimate Defrag free works great on XP machines, I have mine down to 0.000% fragmentation on my programs drive and 0.002% on my media drive). Second, you should look at what is running or what starts up when you turn on your computer. When you install software and use the "Typical Installation" option, you normally wind up setting the program to startup when you turn on the computer and also install toolbars and other unnecessary programs. You can download a program called What's Running (also free) which will tell you what is running when you turn on your computer. If you don't know what something is, look it up online before disabling.    CC Cleaner also works well to clear out temp files.

This will also directly remove them from your friends list aswell. I advise that if many people are annoying you then put your profile on private, so it's better to keep them away. if it's lower than a few people, or just one person, then just block them. hope i helped =D x
zmwDk3g4aa	If you're wallpaper appears on your screen but nothing else, it sounds like you're setup for dual-display with extended desktop.    this is how I have my laptop setup. On your laptop, drag a window or program all the way over to the left until it disappears - it should then appear on your LCD TV.    to change the setting, including turning off extended desktop - ie use mirror mode, right click on your desktop, and whilst I cant remember the exact menu, it's 'Display Options' or 'Appearance' - something like that!|`|AA11802572	I assume that your laptop has a VGA output connector on it.

But  I  understand  Pythagoras  or Pythagorean  theory of Triangles      and  Law   for   A , B ,  C  sides of the Triangle related as follows:          C=  SquareRoot ( A ^2 + B ^2 ) , if you mean this ?  --------------------------------------...   Assuming I understood your Question , The answer will be :      A = Inputbox("  Value of side  A = ? ")    B = Inputbox("  Value of side  B = ? ")        C=  ( A ^ 2 + B ^ 2 ) ^ ( 0.5)    Text1.text = Str( C )     Good Luck

5zSSGKBpaa	It may be a virus but you can't get to the point to run an anti-virus. I presume that you have files that you want to save on the hard drive, so I would not recommend a format and reinstall---yet.  You could do a repair install which would preserve all your personal files and rewrite all the windows files. Follow these directions carefully so as not to lose your personal files.    How to do a repair install:  You will need your 25 digit product key for this.    Place XP CD in drive: Reboot or shutdown and start PC.  1.When the Press any key to boot from CD message is displayed on your screen, press a key to start your computer from the Windows XP CD.  2.Press ENTER when you see the message To setup Windows XP now, and then press ENTER displayed on the Welcome to Setup screen.  3.Do NOT choose the option to press R to use the Recovery Console.  4.In the Windows XP Licensing Agreement, press F8 to agree to the license agreement.  5.Make sure that your current installation of Windows XP is selected in the box, and then press R to repair Windows XP.  NOTE: if it doesn't locate your old OS STOP! As any further actions may result in wiping your data.    6.Follow the instructions on the screen to complete Setup.    If this doesn't resolve the problem you may have to remove the hard drive from the computer and connect it to another computer via usb cable to copy off any files you want.  Good luck|`|MOQXdaZMaa	Call Time Warner Cable or whatever u have your local cable company if thats what ur computer is hooked  to|`|KXd5gc0eaa	haha sounds like you been doing a lot of fap fap fap.

7pAXElgSaa	Its ok to refill with fresh toner but its best not done forever! posibibly 3-4 times IF you find a place that uses GOOD toner!..If you start seeing light print or blochy print try taking the cartridge out and shake it up  tap it a bit and put it back. Try it again. Sometimes the toner gets hard due to moisture content so shaking it will brake up the clumps of toner. This can add a little more life to your cartridge. the money you save on refills can help you afford a new fresh cartridge!|`|44uTRXkWaa	I've been refilling my HP cartridges for years and have saved myself a ton of money doing so.

You won't find a tool to do it for you though, its a little too specialized.    How much it costs would depend on the programmer, your specific requirements, and what you can negotiate.

Now C++ is a whole different story it is one of the most hardest languages to learn unless you have a REALLY good teacher. OK now so you know VB is not anything like C++ ( by code I mean), although it is a good start if you want to learn code. Oh and by the way C++ is the basics of all programs.

N9nJWYa5aa	The problem with overclocking is that there is never any guarantee how far it will go.  I've no doubt SOME p4 1.8GHz will clock at 2.4GHZ, but many won't, due not only to the chip, but the quality of interface between the CPU and cooler and even the case cooling.    You need to be aware that overclocking your CPU can permanently damage it, and in some circumstances the motherboard too!|`|n68rcu9Naa	I don't know but I over clocked my sister's 2.8Ghz to 3.8Ghz WOW stable as a rock too.|`|kAi14kKxaa	Some motherboards aren't that great at overclocking, and even if you know how to get all the settings correct, there are factors depending on     Your motherboard model  BIOS version  Your PSU  How cool your CPU is.    I generally wouldn't bother overclocking a P4 from 1.8 to 2.4, it would get too hot on stock cooling.|`|cqDhuHAsaa	its a dumb idea it will fry your cpu|`|3c1f98e856a2599939b13d7dfd4e33e6aa	depends on alot of things, the amount of voltage the core recieves,(vcore) the max FSB on your motherboard. the more FSB you give it the more voltage it will need thus more heat generated.  each chip has its limits and it can be very clear to see where that point is, system hangs and crashes and in extreme cases messed up harddrive data.  it also depends on what the other components in your system are meant to run. overclocking  is a art, the results are not free; the price is heat and ultimetly failure, download speedfan and check your temps, if your core goes to about 65 deg c then your going too hard. i typically see 72c as a failure and cpus should never see that temp. fyi i run a intel quadcore 3.0 ghz with watercooling so i do know the basic principal  of heat management. stock cooling should never be used for OC'ing upgrade to atleast a aftermarket active cooling heatsink.
zmwDk3g4aa	Regarding the power / screen issue, try using a different power profile. Use 'Power Saver' and see if it then behaves as you would expect (Brighter when plugged in, dimmer when un-plugged). It it's ok after this, it just be that the setting for the dell power profile have been changed somehow. Either stick to the MS power profiles (balanced / power / performance), or you can modify the dell power settings to get it to behave correctly.

I have contacted such people in the past and some say they don't even belong to that site. My guess is that somehow, fanbox and others like them have a way to get into your address book and steal your contacts information and then send e-mail to all of them even as a non-member. I have taken the trouble to check this out and there was a legitimate account that I never created with my info. I unsubcribed and cancelled the account but I still keep getting the spam.

If Linux is to ever try to complete with Windows and Macs in other markets, linux OS need to make there programs more userfriendly, give help to new people trying out Linux, and vendors and manufactures need to make Linux compatible products (preferably opensoruced for drivers).    Also some Linux teams should try to promote the Linux OS through tv ads and other ways, to let the people know that Linux OS actually exist and is user friendly.|`|r8Sme80raa	It depends on what you call equal.

JZeNB1F7aa	Question - which cable do you need to wiggle? the power (mains electric) or the VGA cable?  If it is the VGA cable check that both ends are secure, at the PC end and the monitor end. Remove and replug both ends tightening the retaining screws to give a more secure connection (just finger tight is sufficient). Some monitors have a fixed cable at the Monitor end and if this is so then it is time to buy a new monitor as the repair cost will possibly be as much as buying a new monitor unless you can do this yourself.  If it is the power lead again you need to check it is plugged into the wall (or multi) socket securely and the other end is properly fitted at the monitor. Sometimes the plug at the monitor end gets worn, try swapping the PC mains plug for the monitor mains plug and see if it still does it. Again if it has a fixed cable then I would suggest you buy a new monitor as you risk electricution or fire if the cable is damaged.|`|0003934bb4332a9e445607b7d52efbdeaa	Sounds like it is time for a new VGA cable...

kAi14kKxaa	It's because of the way computers place data on the hard drive.  When your HDD writes data, it places it in wherever there happens to be space, on random locations on the hard drive.    This is called hard drive fragmentation (and subsequently this is the reason why HDD's need defragmentation every so often)    If there are clusters of data near the 'end' of the hard drive, windows cannot truncate (shrink) your drive until that cluster has been deleted or moved. Unfortunately, the built in partition manager in Vista doesn't move the data for you, so you'll have to use a defragmenter app or a third party partition maker like this:    http://www.download.com/Easeus-Partition...    Try this instead.|`|pogaNhAeaa	If the drive is full,of course vista will not allow you to allocate space in  a drive.|`|0Dbjv10iaa	If the drive is full often vista will not allow you to shrink a drive.|`|BYVjRuhXaa	You may have a 9gb partition on your laptop.  Right click on MY COMPUTER, and then MANAGE.  You will then see on the left side a selection for Drive Manager.  Click on this and then you can see what partitions are available.    Actually the best thing to do is go to Microsoft and download Microsoft Virtual Machine.  Install this and then you can have Linus on the same partition and will have access to your data.  Works like a champ.

Depending on which version you have, Malwarebytes (MB) may or may not remove the virus. In some cases a full restore is necessary, backing up data before the restore COULD backup the virus. Older versions of the virus (System Anti-virus 2009, XP Anti-virus 2008...) can be removed by MB, but newer versions (Anti-virus 360) prevents installation of MB. If you get a window that states you have hundreds of viruses and to purchase anti-virus software, it's most likely a version of this virus. Whatever you do, don't purchase the anti-virus they offer, it's a scam by a couple of Russian guys who just roll your bank account or credit card for $50.

tXpcpAG3aa	If you are not partial to the laptop then ditch it!! However like me there are many people who grow attached to their systems and it may not be that expensive to just replace the motherboard of the laptop. I will include in the source area a  few that I have found on Ebay that should work. I have replaced a few motherboards for laptops over the last few years. They can range in price from as little as $50.00 to $250.00. Just take your time and don't rush if you do the job your self.  Good luck.      I have listed four possible motherboards you can get for your system for under $150.00 each. So you will need to find the actual manufacturer and model number of your current board and type it into your ebay search browser and see if it gets a hit. If it doesn't search by the computer model or series ( ex: DV2000     /     DV2535ea)   that is how I found the ones below.|`|4dfbcf738541ddcd8d3291d2dbbb44deaa	It'd probably be cheaper to buy a new laptop.

There isn't a way to track the progression of an email unless it gets sent back to you eventually.  (The exception of course is if you work at the NSA and have unrestricted access to Echelon.)  And then that is only one possible path of said email. You have to remember that if you send it to 10 people, and they each send it to 10 people, and they each send it to 10 people, that's 1001 people that have seen the email.  It's just not possible to track that many different paths.    A more logical action would be for facebook to send you an email directly.  And it would have to have some link that you could read more information that is actually ON facebook.|`|Lzt0whQ7aa	I hope you have antivirus.
42179704f68b09bf27cb0b25a718c620aa	Question: Do you have any Security Software other than the crap that came with the OS? (i.e.: Norton / McAfee / ca / Kaspersy / etc)    If not, you likely have multiple viruses running rampant on your system.    First things first. Go to the manufacturer's website and see if you can find-out what key you need to press to access Safe Mode. See if you can boot into Safe Mode. If you can't, one or more viruses have corrupted or deleted the critical file(s) to let you boot-up.    If you *can* boot into Safe Mode (choose "Safe Mode with Networking," and try to find a system scanner [here's a link to the company I have my AVS with].)    If you can't, you're going to have to take the computer in for repairs...and that is going to be moderately expensive.    Once they have repaired your system (or you buy a new one), make sure you buy a decent AV Suite - avoid McAfee, it's too bloated for it's own good right now - and install it. Also, see if you can have them build you a "recovery CD" that you can use should you have similar issues in future. You can't do the format and re-install yourself with anything less than the actual OS disk...recovery and repair CDs won't do it, and they don't fix every problem.    Good Luck!|`|zc3BoaWgaa	SYSTEM is one of your registry files which Windows needs to start.  Based on your message it has been corrupted.    Your personal folders such as (pictures, documents etc) should be okay as long as you do not reformat the hard-drive and as long as this error is not a hard-drive hardware error.    Worst case you would need to remove the hard-drive and either put in an external usb kit and attach to a second computer or attach as a second drive to a different computer.  This is a safety precaution to ensure that your critical files are safe.    Next depending on the registry file error or other BSOD error do a Google search to determine the appropriate recovery option.    Most likely you will have to reboot from the install disks and get into the recovery console to either run chkdsk or copy backup registry files into their proper location.    Then after reboot do a system restore to get the computer back to a current state.    There is much good documentation out on the web on this but all steps must be done in order and very carefully.    Post back if more assistance is required.|`|rjZQCHDCaa	It's good you have an new computer.  All your files, data/photos, etc are still in the old hard drive.  Just don't FORMAT the old drive.  To transfer the files to your new computer, just remove the old hard drive and add it to the new computer as a 2nd drive, not primary.  Thjis requires opening your casing of the desktop.    If you don't want to open up the desktop, I would suggest you getting a external drive case and insert the old drive and this become a new external drive.  Your USB connection will recognize the new external drive.  Good Luck!|`|0003934bb4332a9e445607b7d52efbdeaa	All of your files & folders are still there, just the Windows XP OS is messed up... Even if you find the system disks that came with your computer, they will NOT fix the problem as they most likely are just restore disks & NOT Windows XP program disks...    So if you tried to use the system restore disks, they would erase your hard drive (delete ALL of your FILES!) & reinstall the OS, that is how the system restore disks work...    As it stands now, you can take your hard drive to a computer repair shop & have your files recoveredd & copied on to DVD. Or when you buy a new computer you can buy an USB hard drive enclosure, to install the old hard drive in & Connect it to your new computer & transfer the files to your new computer your self...|`|maCfp5cEaa	Yes, they will be recoverable. I would recommend, once you find the restore disks, that you back up everything. If there is a virus on your computer, it will happen again, at which point it is time to reformat.|`|C2aWncmkaa	To get to your documents, you can remove the hard drive and connect it to a USB-to-hard-drive adapter, then plug the USB into another computer (that has its own anti-malware programs running) and access your documents and copy them.  You can get these adapters from     TigerDirect:  http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/...    Compusa :  http://www.compusa.com/applications/cate...    Compusa :  http://www.compusa.com/applications/sear...    Dell :  http://accessories.us.dell.com/sna/produ...    Newegg :  http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...    You might check with a computer repair shop, they will have these adapters and might rent you the device for a small fee.    Get an USB external hard drive, these are made by Seagate, Maxtor, Western Digital, Iomega, Verbatim, and many others, and sold at Best Buy, Office Max, Office Depot, and others.    Use the external hard drive to make fast and easy copies of all of your important documents (it's faster than burning CDs or DVDs).    More importantly, after you get rid of the malware on your computer, make a full backup of the computer, so that in the future if you get clobbered again, you can reload the backup and be running again.  Be aware that a full backup can take over 20 minutes to run - and a full restore likewise will take over 20 minutes to run.    To completely get rid of malware, it is usually necessary to reinstall the operating system.  The jerks who write the malware are constantly revising it to keep the anti-malware software from shutting the mal-ware down.  It's a never ending battle.    But you said you might get a new computer - be sure to make backups, because it is much easier to restore a backup than it is to reinstall the operating system.  .|`|TGAwr1p9aa	try taking the hard drive out and if you have a spare pc put it in that

Answers, use a WYSIWYG editor. Adobe Dreamweaver is one. It has the capabilities of HTML and WYSIWYG together. Confused?    Well, a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editor shows the site as it is being edited. You cannot see a website in Notepad or another such editor. Dreamweaver can let you use an HTML editor while showing the website live, or you can directly edit the page with elements etc. in a graphical user interface, with all kinds of readymade options.    WYSIWYG is easy, but may be difficult in some cases. Also, Notepad is free and there are dozens of other HTML editors available for free too. HTML can also make all kinds of beautiful pages, but it is too raw and may be harder to grasp and use.     So, I suggest you buy a WYSIWYG editor.

A good and easy application to use is Microsoft Publisher that comes with the Microsoft Office package. It has a lot of templates available and even more templates that you can get for free or purchase online.

I couldn't use my computer for days. I tried every thing to get rid of it, but no matter what I did, it just kept coming back stronger. I was so stressed out after spending multiple days trying to remove the spyware with no luck. I gave up and decided to throw in the towel. I called geek squad. They came and looked at my computer, but wanted $300 to fix it. I really didn't have that much, so I told them I couldn't afford to fix it at this time. The technician must have seen the frustration I was going through. Because he pulled me aside and told me how I could fix it for under $60.     He told me to go to  http://www.honestspywarereview.com    So I checked into it, and found the best product, AdwareAlert is also capable of removing Trojans.

Before you remove the battery, unplug the tower from the wall...    If this dose not fix the PCIe problem, look for a BIOS update on the MOBO makers web site & install that...    And if all of the above fails, then it might be time for a new MOBO...|`|AA12350553	Sorry, don't understand how using a different PCI-E card proved that your video card wasn't faulty... you've not proved anything except the PCI-e card you tried didn't work in the slot on your mobo. You may have a pair of duff video cards.    You mention the CMOS battery... if it's run flat then your board may have lost setting and be running with it's PCI-e slot disabled or forced to the wrong speed. Or maybe your board has lost it's setting and has decided that the video card is the built-in one only. Check the BIOS... make sure your PCI-e is enabled, that it is set to the correct speed (if it is speed-settable) and that the mobo has not decided only to use the built-in video card.    To check your video card is OK, test the video card in another computer! That's the only way to prove the video card works.|`|kAi14kKxaa	At your last question:    That's probably because a BIOS update usually resets the entire BIOS settings, when the ROM gets flashed.|`|tXpcpAG3aa	Well the first two answers seem to be on target. But a word of caution about upgrading your BIOS. If you have never done it before don't try it now, you already have a problem and if you don't do the BIOS flash right you will have more problems. Once you learn how to flash your bios, go for it.      Now as for reseting your BIOS, definitely try that, but first go into your device manager and see if the card is installed and enabled. (I have read your statement about having reinstalled your drivers) but check to see if it is really showing up in the system, because even though you reinstalled the drivers doesn't mean it is enabled. If it's not, there may be an underlying problem. If it is enabled, then by all means reset the bios. You can do this one of two ways, Remove the watch battery from the motherboard while the system is unplugged and wait a couple of minutes to make sure there is absolutely no residual power in the system and that the CMOS is actually reset. Or you can find the two pins that are side by side that have the words CMOS or Jumper 1 or Jumper 2 written under them. Touch both pins simultaneously with a paperclip or something metal. You only need to do it for a second. Once that is done when you start up again the graphics card should work again. But without having tested the graphics card on another system, you will not know for sure if it isn't the problem. Good luck.

SJM0rzHtaa	Buy a new CPU.    The Pentium-D is notorious for generating A LOT OF HEAT--  Some of the higher-clocked ones have a TDP of 160W.  Insane.    Because the Pentium-D puts out so much heat, the CPU fan always needs to spin fast to move lots of air to cool it down, which means it is NOISY.    Get a 65nm Core 2 Duo instead, like an Allendale E4600, which will work with your 945-chipset board.  It's LOTS faster than a Pentium-D and only puts out 65W maximum TDP, which means it's  far easier to cool, and you can use a slow-spinning (quiet) CPU fan like a Zalman CNPS7000 to cool it.    You should also think about replacing the noisy graphics card fan if it's not passively cooled, and get a PSU with a slow-speed fan like a Seasonic S12.    For more tips on quieting your computer, you should visit SilentPCReview.  Those guys are the final authority on building quiet PCs:  http://www.silentpcreview.com    My config:  E8400 Wolfdale with Zalman CNPS7000, Intel DP35DP motherboard, ATI HD3870  w/ducted cooler, Seasonic S12-380 PSU, Panaflo L1A slow-speed case fans.  My computer is virtually silent--  I can hear quiet dialog when playing back movies without hearing fan noise in the background.    Hope this helps.|`|BhYwYzuDaa	If you would maybe know how you could maybe get a new cpu fan, they do sell quieter ones. Maybe their are screws loose.

Unless you mean transfer rate, it says here that USB 2.0 has a raw data rate of 480 Mega bits per second. That only applies if you have a single USB device and not connected to a USB hub, else the rate is split between the devices, hence the name Universal Serial Device.    It's highly overrated in my opinion, a standard ethernet switch and NIC card is much more efficient. Transfers across the local network can be faster than to the hard drive ..

793IpAn1aa	Probably the ATI Radeon 2600XT...  See this month's video card roundup from Tom's Hardware (page 6)    However, the previous poster has a point... Because AGP cards are expensive compared to PCI-E cards, it's cheaper in the long run to migrate to a PCI-E motherboard.    You can get an Asus P5KPL-CM for about $55... plus a PCI-E Radeon 4670 for about  $75.    Most $75-$95 PCI-E graphics cards (Geforce 9600GSO, Radeon 4670, Geforce 9600GT) are better than the AGP Radeon 3850, which costs twice as much.  The Radeon 4830 and Geforce 8800GT only cost $20 more, and those are WAY better.    Still, changing motherboards is a bit of a process... The 2600XT is the easy, no-hassle upgrade.|`|1ec5c3ef48df0b4438ce6e3638f0bdeaaa	youre really better off scraping everything.    the best agp card is the hd3850 and it costs about $180    the second best is the x1950pro and will cost $100-150    the hd2600xt is about $90-100    but if you already have the case,psu,dvd drives, and maybe a hdd, you can build a new monster rig for $250    new proc,new mobo, new ram, new gpu

Using others p2p programs like messengers or chatting services will slow down your downloading.  7.

AA11314954	I poked around with it a little.  I think either it is not english or it is not a substitution cipher.  Though most likely I believe it is not english.    The repeated elements of 'b' and 'gpb' make me lean toward a simple substitution.  Though it could be a word based variable substituion (where the substitution changes based on letter position in the word).  I find this unlikely though.    Assuming simple substitution, I find the some of the combinations unusual for English.  Giving the spacing, b would have to substitute for a or i.  Yet, that makes gpb end in a or i.  There are 3 letter words that end in a or i, but none of them seem to be a common word that would appear multiple times in the short text.    Even worse are the words with the two letter repeats.  Doing a regex search against large word lists (even with proper names), I could find no word to match the structure of yyrbbznxvpj.    These two problems lead me to believe something is wrong with the assumptions.  Either the source language, the encryption method, or copying the cipher text into your question.  Another possibility is a poem using unusual constructs such as b being the letter o.|`|7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	If you don't know the language it's written in, there's no way to decipher it, except to try each language, one at a time.    I assume that you know the normal method of deciphering text - using a frequency table.For instance, if it's English, 'e' is the most common character, followed by 't', then 'o', etc.    In this text, 'b' is probably either i or a.  if 'u' is o, 'qu' could be to (making 'q' t) and 'uj' could be of.    That's how you decipher text.    (BTW, you don't decode a cipher, you decode a code and decipher a cipher.  Codes are replacement things - like 'airplane' means Tuesday and 'turkey' means shoot, so "We ordered turkey for lunch on the airplane" means "shoot him on Tuesday".  You can't decode a code without the code book.  A cipher is the text itself, obfuscated in some way.  "Morse code", for instance, is really a cipher, not a code.)|`|AA10686521	what is the key? what is the cipher language? its impossible

7ZfGqo3qaa	Quad-Core processors have four cores on a single chip, while dual-cores have two.  Quad-cores are more expensive.    As to whether it makes a big difference, that depends upon what you're using your computer for.  To do stuff like gaming or general web browsing, no there isn't a big difference.      Quad Cores help immensely when you're using programs that were specifically written to use all four cores- that includes applications for decrypting DVDs, video editing applications, CAD and 3D design programs, or doing heavy multitasking like compiling code or doing big database searches in the background.      But for gaming, dual cores are the better buy.  For the cost of a 2.4Ghz quad-core CPU, you can buy a 3Ghz dual-core, which runs games faster.|`|b7w8JaWzaa	Take note however you can buy a very powerful dual core cpu and for the same price you spend on that for a quad core the quad would be weaker for gaming. Even though the quad has 4 cpu running, they are each significantly weaker than the 2 dual cause the same value is split into 4 cores hence the quad core would be less powerful and perform worse than the dual for gaming but better for extreme multi tasking.  so it depends on what you want to do with your comp.|`|BhYwYzuDaa	I would believe so, I cannot speak form experience, I am upgrading and still waiting for my new system, I would say they work the same but with more processors and processing power for multiple applications.|`|UwTB8gM4aa	A 'core' is actually the brain of a computer.  A dual-core computer has two brains that have the ability to work in tandem to crunch lines of code simultaneously.  A quad-core computer has 4 such brains.  Although they are generally significantly faster than single-core processors, the speed is not, for example, doubled by going from a single- to a double-core processor.  This is due to the way software is written (i.e., primarily written for single-core processors).|`|6vsahvlGaa	Hi    dual core   .....

There is nothing that important that you have to bypass the internet filter that can't wait until school/work is dismissed. If you are discovered using the school/company computers for restricted sites, you will endure severe consequences; that you really don't want to. It's honestly not worth the repercussions involved.  There are plenty of sites your computer will allow that are far better than that, and worth your time.  They are blocked for several reasons, and there is no changing that. With the multitude of computer viruses spreading around, companies cannot take any chances.  Bypassing the filters set-up by companies is near impossible. The major Web security gateway software processors are pretty well impenetrable.|`|SzzfrJHxaa	You can give this proxy a try to unblock those blocked websites; it works like a charm!    http://rocksurf.info    Be sure to tell your friends about it so they too can enjoy.

YNoTqr0uaa	Go to start, control panel, then sounds and audio devices.      Select the hardware tab, and click on the sound device you want to use.  select properties, and make sure it is set to "enable this device" then in that same window,  select the properties tab, and make sure  each sub device is set to "use audio features on this device" and make sure the check box that says "do not map through this device" is NOT checked.     If You have more than one audio mapper (example having both a USB speaker set and the default audio card for your notebook) you must  disable one of them. You cannot use two at once.    And when you uninstall a device, you MUST reboot before reinstalling or it will create registry conflicts and errors similar to yours.    If all else fails, restart your computer and push F8 before the windows boot screen appears.  select "last configuration that worked" and see if it solves the problem.    If not do the F8 thing again and select "safe mode" and see if the audio works.       And do not Defragment the Hard Drive when you have a system error.

J5osM2O8aa	I went through a few bad hosts myself in the past, then I started using http://www.hostmonsterplus.com and couldn't be happier. I've now been using them for 2 years.    They have unlimited space and unlimited bandwidth.  They give you a free domain for life. (Or let you use your own)  They support PHP and 100 MySQL databases.  You can also add as many domains (.com, .net, ...) as you like so you can host many different sites for the one hosting price.  They also give you free $50 Google Credits for advertising your site.  There's lots of different Message Board and Forum scripts added in too.  Their support services and live chat are very helpful.  No limit on single file sizes.    Note: Unlimited space means if you get close to maxing out the drive they guarantee to add more, as they have done for my serve before.    If you go with them and have any trouble making your site feel free to PM me, I have a lot of experience there.    There are cheaper around, but http://www.hostmonsterplus.com provides the best quality for cost, and hence why I always use them and I direct all my friends there.

Worldwide, C is the first or second most popular language in terms of number of developer positions or publicly available code.[4][5] It is widely used on many different software platforms, and there are few computer architectures for which a C compiler does not exist. C has greatly influenced many other popular programming languages, most notably C++, which originally began as an extension to C, and Java and C  which borrow C lexical conventions and operators.

It was designed to be compiled using a relatively straightforward compiler, to provide low-level access to memory, to provide language constructs that map efficiently to machine instructions, and to require minimal run-time support. C was therefore useful for many applications that had formerly been coded in assembly language.    Despite its low-level capabilities, the language was designed to encourage machine-independent programming. A standards-compliant and portably written C program can be compiled for a very wide variety of computer platforms and operating systems with little or no change to its source code, while approaching highest performance. The language has become available on a very wide range of platforms, from embedded microcontrollers to supercomputers.    [edit] Minimalism    C is designed to provide high-level abstracts for all the native features of a general-purpose CPU, while at the same time allowing modularization, structure, and code re-use. Features specific to a particular program's function (features that are not general to all platforms) are not included in the language or library definitions. However any such specific functions are implementable and accessible as external reusable libraries, in order to encourage module dissemination and re-use. C is somewhat strongly typed (emitting warnings or errors) but allows programmers to override types in the interests of flexibility, simplicity or performance; while being natural and well-defined in its interpretation of type overrides.    C's design is tied to its intended use as a portable systems implementation language. Consequently, it does not require run-time checks for conditions that would never occur in correct programs, it provides simple, direct access to any addressable object (for example, memory-mapped device control registers), and its source-code expressions can be translated in a straightforward manner to primitive machine operations in the executable code. Some early C compilers were comfortably implemented (as a few distinct passes communicating via intermediate files) on PDP-11 processors having only 16 address bits; however, C99 assumes a 512 KB minimum compilation platform.    [edit] Characteristics    Like most imperative languages in the ALGOL tradition, C has facilities for structured programming and allows lexical variable scope and recursion, while a static type system prevents many unintended operations. In C, all executable code is contained within functions. Function parameters are always passed by value. Pass-by-reference is achieved in C by explicitly passing pointer values. Heterogeneous aggregate data types (struct) allow related data elements to be combined and manipulated as a unit.

School's are legally bound by the federal Children's Internet Protection Act to block proxies and the like.    Schools have to take this seriously to get certain technology funding.

It blocks proxies 98% of the time because of their content (that they are a proxy), not because of the web address.  Also there are admins like me securing the system, adding any the system may miss (listed on proxy lists and even here) by adding them to the DNS blacklist.

If so, go to Control Panel and select Device Manager (DM) from the list. Let  DM develop its alphabetized list. The last item is called Universal Serial Bus (that is what USB means) controllers. The one into which you plugged your stick should be visible as USB Mass Storage Device.     Double-click that line and its 'Properties' window should come up. The initial tab is  the General one and it will say the device is working properly. If it isn't, go to the tab marked 'Driver' . In the botom half are five buttons. You want to make sure the fourth from the top shows 'Disable' which means your device is enabled. If it says 'Enable' then your stick is disabled  and you have to enable it.     If this is your situation, then you may correctly wonder why it was disabled when you didn't disable it. Great question as I wondered that too when it happened to me. It seems to be a periodic quirk of VISTA for reasons I have yet to understand.

42179704f68b09bf27cb0b25a718c620aa	Processor...quads, why does it always have to be quads!?!  RAM...2x1 or 1x2?  HD...decent...  GPU...poor soul  Mobo...not yet bought?  ROM...DVDRW/CRW?    Answer  1:  Neither...Nothing on the market until some time in 2010 that requires a quad...unless you're building a server for a largish network. If you're stuck with Intel, a Core 2 Duo at 3.0 Ghz or higher will do anything you want, and then some.    Answer  2:  You will have the choice of DDR2 *or* DDR3, since they are notched differnetly, and 2 will not fit in a 3 slot, and vice versa. Besides, there's a reason why DDR3 is so rarely seen...the performance increase over DDR2 is almost non-existant. From the looks of it, DDR2 will be around until DDR4 dominates the market. As for Mobo...if you haven't bought it (or any of the other parts yet) I'd suggest an ASUS MVP class mobo - I use an M3A32-MVP Deluxe (it's AM2+, so it can take the current gen AMD chip, or the next two generation chips - dual or quad - with 100% compatability), and is fully Crossfire-X capable...and the HD4870 tends to be better (and less expensive) than the "equivalent" nVidia cards - the 9800 series.    However, if you are "locked-in" for parts, trade the 9800 for an 8800GTS (or even two and put them in SLI).    Answer 3:  For the HDD, partition it into a smaller partition (about 60Gb for the OS and required "core" programs only), and the remainderof the disk (for everything else).  For Memory, go with 1Gb cards instead of 2Gb cards. Access times on identically rated cards are faster in the 1Gb ones...they are less than half than the cost of the 2Gb cards, so 2x1Gb is less expensive than 1x2Gb,  For the proc...it will be Q2 or 3 in 2010 before there are any programs requiring the use of a quad...and even uber-power users have problems seeing any activity on the 4th core. Even Windows 7 (or Vista 2) can't utilise a quad core. So, for all intents, a dual core is more "powerful" than a quad...and not just because quads are maxing out at 2.4Ghz or so, and duals are maxing out over 3.0Ghz. The *only* machine that has a legitimate chance at saying it needs a quad is a high-end server running some very high-demand Enterprise class apps. Even SUN and SPARQ Engineering Terminals don't use quads!    Additional: If you're using a 32 bit OS, you will max-out at around 3.5 Gb of useable memory, were you to add more. For 64 bit OS's, you can max-out in the 16Gb or more range!    Good Luck!|`|jIccV2sOaa	I think you should know considerably more about building computers, than you question indicates you know, before you embark on the project.

0lbOAXVGaa	If you mean hide from your ISP or 3rd party monitoring file-sharing sites for copyright infringement, no there isn't.      Your only working solution would be to pay for anonymizing service. This would quarantee your ISP doesn't see your traffic (it is tunneled to the anon. provider) and also your IP address would be hidden as your traffic enters Internet from the anon. provider's nodes elsewhere.      Obvious downsides are it costs and they usually have some traffic quotas in place.
YNoTqr0uaa	Any processor that's multi-core will be fine (core duo, core 2 duo, AMD athlon, etc)  pretty much any notebook made in the past 3 years can easily do audio production and editing.  A big Hard Drive will be a must,  250 GB at least. And make sure it has a PCI-expresscard slot, and a IEEE 1394 i link (4 pin firewire)   I edit audio a lot, and these features enable you to add quality high speed external audio cards. As the USB 2.0 external audio cards have a lot of lag.  And honestly, the most important will be the software you choose. Get Windows xp pro or even better windows xp pro media center edition 2005. Vista has far too many audio glitches. And If you are an experienced musician, I recommend spending the cash for FL studio 8xxL producer edition, That's what I use. If you are just starting out, get something simple and free like audacity.  And it's a myth that mac books are the best for this type of thing. I have both pc and mac machines and honestly, there isn't anything the Mac's do that my pc's can't. And The software is always cheaper for pc anyway.

AA11811364	Well, Sarah, I don't know of any virus that can survive reinstalling the OS as you say you've done twice.  So you can probably eliminate virus as a probability in this case.    Random shutdowns can be caused by a number of things, and part of it depends on whether it's a laptop or desktop.    For laptops, heat is a killer because it's such a small space and the ventilation system has to be kept fastidiously clean of dust and debris.  Dust and debris can also build up in desktops but it may take longer.    I'd say your first priority is to clean all the vents and fans to make sure they are completely clean and free of anything that could limit airflow.  You need to make sure your laptop:    1.  is placed on a hard, flat surface for use  2.  has 360 degrees of air circulation  3.  is used in a fairly comfortable room temperature  4.  has no dust or debris in or around any of the air circulation grills  4. fans are free of dust and debris and that they run smoothly and quietly  5. You may need to buy a laptop cooler base for under your laptop    Second, Update IE to the latest version and/or patch.  Search the Microsoft Knowledge Base for known IE problems.    Third, Get into your Device Manager and update your video driver first to make sure you have the latest version.  Run for several days to see if your problem is solved.  If not, continue to update your hardware drivers until your computer no longer locks up.    Lastly, if you still have the problem, it could be a faulty memory stick or it's just not seated properly.    Good Luck|`|HYk5jhnqaa	If you've already formatted your HD, ... than ... you should go to a specialist.  There might be parts of your comp that doesn't fit quite well together.

DCXk0bVLaa	No.  Any speaker has a limit to it's power handling capability beyond which distortion or damage can occur.  The maximum power (volume) output of your laptop is limited to protect the inbuilt speakers from damage.  Your only alternative is to purchase a pair of external powered speakers or if you want even more than that connect your laptop to a stereo system.  Laptop speakers are designed for convenience and portability not for high definition sound production.  The frequency range is also very limited. They are not capable of producing low frequencies such as bass guitar with any accuracy.    The EQ is a frequency not a volume control. Pushing it to the upper limits could produce distortion and reduce clarity.  Equalizers have four main uses:-  1: In a recording studio to compensate for any deficiencies in the room.  2: To compensate for deficiencies in the speakers.  3: To enhance the vocals or instruments while recording.  4: To adjust sound for personal preference.    In general EQ should be used sparingly especially in the lower frequency range. The more the lower end is boosted, the more power is needed by the amplifier. The moving coil in the speaker/s could reach the limit of travel and not only produce distortion but could result in permanent damage.  Speakers are designed to work within a specified power handling range.  To go beyond this in an invitation for disaster.|`|AA10435303	well, I don't think there is a software that can max your volume beyond your laptop capabilities,  if you want a loader voice you should buy a speaker or there are head phones who have audio amplifiers,    hope that helped !

SA48Imkqaa	oye friend, for the first problem like instead of changing time every time you log on just change the battery on your mother board that could have been dead so change it that will store your date and time.    then the verifying DMI pool data is like that which checks for the devices attached and also for the starting of the OS so it doesnt make any problem just like leave it.

ZkELw9wzaa	Your school filter can detect a proxy as soon as you try it and either block it on the fly or notify an admin to block it manually. The bottom line is that all proxy's will eventually get blocked. As the filtering software gets more advanced they will get blocked faster and faster.    There is also the question of the rules and laws you are breaking by trying to hack your school security system.    Finally even if you got a proxy to work for a short time you are inviting the proxy owner, many of whom are using the proxy for hacking purposes, to infect and or hijack your school network. Read more on the dangers of proxy's below.|`|td6WXhv4aa	Sorry,    1) Circumventing your School Computers is illegal    2) It's a violation of your School usage policies to circumvent    3) It's a violation of the YA community guidelines to ask questions that break the law or provide assistance to others to do it.

Trying to get past the filtering system violates school computer usage policy. You can and probably will get suspended from school or get banned from using school computers. There is nothing on Myspace that is so critical that can't wait until you get home from school.|`|T17pbHVJaa	None should work.    School's are legally bound by the federal Children's Internet Protection Act to block proxies and the like.    Schools have to take this seriously to get certain technology funding.    All the proxies you try should be blocked by your school. That is because most schools use content blocking software. It blocks proxies 98% of the time because of their content (that they are a proxy), not because of the web address.  Also there are admins like me securing the system, adding any the system may miss (listed on proxy lists and even here) by adding them to the DNS blacklist.     You are very very unlikely to find one that works and even then it will only work for a short time until they know you are using it.    Your risking your computer rights/detention/suspension by trying to bypass their security.

One option is to start the computer in the last know working state. Select that one and hit .   If that doesn't work, you may need to reinstall Windows. Put the CD in the drive and restart it. If that doesn't work, and you don't have the CD, some computers have a back up partition, it should be the D: drive. If you have a Windows CD or your computer has this back up drive, you can wipe your main Windows partition. Make sure you have an external hard drive to back up all your files. To do this, download an Ubuntu Live CD (Ubuntu is the most stable version of Linux) and burn it onto a CD. http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/download... Put the CD into your computer and restart it. Select the option to run Ubuntu without making any changes.  First back up your files to your external hard drive. You will have to find the command to force mount your C: drive, I forget what it is, but you have to type 'sudo' and then force it to mount an NTFS partition, you'll have to search on line for it.  You can now see all of your Windows files, just drag and drop them onto your external hard drive.  Now, under the 'system' menu, open up the partition editor and make it delete your Windows main partition.  Now restart your computer, take out the Ubuntu CD, put in your Windows XP CD. Or, if you have the backup partition, it will automatically reinstall Windows. Otherwise, the Windows XP CD will install Windows.  Now you can put all of your files back on your computer and it should work fine after that.

When you turn your computer on it goes through several steps before it actually shows you your desktop, most of which can have a password associated with them.  First Your BIOS loads, this is where (usually) you have a black screen with a logo in the upper lefthand corner and a whole bunch of numbers, or a blue screen with the HP or compaq logo on it. Some computers require a password before you can get beyond this point. While your system is loading the BIOS (I'm referring to POSTing here for any techies reading this, just trying to be user firendly) the computer detects your hard drives. Some hard drives require a password entered before the computer can load anything off of it. If it asks you for a password here it will say something like Primary HDD has a password authentication system... and requires a password. Once your computer finishes loading the BIOS(usually about 3-10 seconds) you will get the windows loading screen with the windows logo and the bar moving under it. After this the windows logon screen can appear asking you for a password. Usually this will show a username with a picture and a text box underneath requesting a password. Could you describe where you are being asked for the password

There is nothing that important that you have to bypass the internet filter that can't wait until school/work is dismissed. If you are discovered using the school/company computers for restricted sites, you will endure severe consequences; that you really don't want to. It's honestly not worth the repercussions involved.  There are plenty of sites your computer will allow that are far better than that, and worth your time.  They are blocked for several reasons, and there is no changing that. With the multitude of computer viruses spreading around, companies cannot take any chances.  Bypassing the filters set-up by companies is near impossible. The major Web security gateway software processors are pretty well impenetrable.

AA12350553	If you use a file undeleter program (third party program) it goes out and finds all of the 'files' - delete or overwrite doesn't delete the file, only the pointer to it.    So the data stays available on the disk until it's overwritten... so if you're lucky some or all of the files will be recoverable.    But the more changes you make to your PC (the more files you edit or copy or move) the greater the chance the space will be re-used and the more data you will lose.    So the important thing is STOP changing the computer now.

I think the loss of quality is unavoidable when you convert a video from one file type to another one. Unfortunately, I am not a very good computer scientist to explain why it wouldn't work perfectly. To answer your question more properly I would have to google for some more information about converting videos.    However, in the near future, I think it will be possible to reduce the loss of quality so much that you hardly notice any loss.|`|PDIKYPQVaa	there is no GOOD way to lose quality, all you can do is PREVENT a lot of quality loss. it's the same with mp3 compression and when an image is reduced (size, resolution). once the information is gone, you can't put it back in without the source.     when you re-encode, what you get is essentially a photocopy of a photocopy. to prevent the quality degradation, you would need to increase the re-encode settings to grab as much of the copied quality as you can. most of the time it increases the file size considerably. for that I would use virtaldub. small download, free, it gives you access to almost all the encoders that are on your computer. works with most files formats.     I would recommend keeping the dimensions to be as close to the original as possible, and use any encoder that has a 2 pass encode, it takes longer but you'll get less quality degradation. windows media is able to do that, divx has an n encode pass, which you can have it run as many times as you like, to get better encoding with smaller file size.     I took a divx 5 music video lasting 4 min and encoded to wmv in about 30 min with ok quality. but increasing the file size by 3 times. time to encode vary depending on your computer specs.    if there's no specific reason why you would need to encode the video, I would just let it be.
lY1UROfvaa	Outlook PST files are designed for single user usage only.  One way to save money is to have it open (while physically residing on the server) by one person only at one time. If another person needs it, he will holla the other to close the file, so he can open it.  Another way is to use third party software and run it on the server: test some trials here:    http://www.softalkltd.com/products/softa...    http://www.snapfiles.com/get/publicoutlo...    http://shareo.4team.biz/default.asp?pcod...    http://www.mapilab.com/groupware/share_s...    They range from 50 to several hundreds of dollars, and all use a slightly different mechanism (most needs software to be installed on both the server and client).  And the final bang, is to buy and install a fully fledged Windows Server 2003 with Exchange Server 2003, which might be too costly for you. An alternative is to use the SBS server edition, which sets you back around 500 dollars.

K6DWA6geaa	Looking at this from Ebay's point of view, they will want to encourage anything that make the purchasing process easier for the BUYER where the money comes from.  So, if a seller can't leave negative freedback to a buyer, the buyer will less likely have a 'bad experience' on ebay.         Of course this logic is ridiculous. It is forcing many smaller sellers (i.e. not feedback ratings in the 100000s) out of the game leaving only larger sellers to take the hits and keep on selling.  When the feedback system changed, many people bailed to web sites like http://www.ecrater.com/  and   http://www.etsy.com/  to sell items in a more 'friendly' environment.|`|ae528b98e69adf3dc67010ecc9bc16fcaa	because it easier for the seller to rip the buyer off than it is for the buyer to completely screw over the seller.    that is why|`|GwQevn2Gaa	Ebay has a big problem with fraud.  There are criminal gangs who use stolen credit cards to rip off sellers.  There are two many criminal sellers who sell fake counterfeit goods. Buying over the internet is risky business.   If you don't like ebays rules take your business elsewhere.
XslxkaIGaa	Try using the free service at Zamzar.com.    1.  Upload your PDF document  2.  Select DOC as the file type to convert to  3.  Enter your email address    Since this is a free service, it may take 15-30 minutes to get the email with your new attachment (converted file).    I use this a lot.    I hope this helps.|`|HJI8778baa	Just do a screen grab of the chart! File conversion is really dodgy especially where PDF -> DOC is concerned.

xe1NoWUNaa	I can't believe that these people knowing how sorry AVG is would recommend it. It doesn't get much worse. If you don't believe me do a search right here on answers and you will find there are more than plenty of machines that get infected with all kinds of spy ware' ad ware' Trojans and viruses. Avg is junk. So is AVAST. There is no such thing as a best free anti-everything. You can't get something worth anything for nothing. A lot of people on here will try to lead you to believe you can. I been doing this a long time' Truth is you can't. AVG' AVAST' All those free ones have security holes in them or they wouldn't be free. I have had all the free ones at one time or the other and they all let me down. I got tired of every two or 3 months having to pay 125 bucks to have my OS reinstalled because some hacker or virus got to my machine. It doesn't matter what site your on. I have signed into yahoo and got a virus. You can't expect a free AV to keep your machine safe. I have also had Norton and McAfee paid versions and found them to be a joke to. Norton' Memory hog and not that good at detection or protection. McAfee' Memory hog and also not as good as advertised. So far the best i have found is Kaspersky products. I just re-upped my subscription today. Defender Pro powered by Kaspersky has served me well. No bugs of any kind in a year. Can't say that about any free one. But still if free is the best you can do download AVIRA. It's better than those other so called "good free"AV's     The Kaspersky 30 day trial. The best you will get.    http://www.kaspersky.com/trials    Avira Free    http://www.free-av.com/|`|LsO5TX9Haa	Avira     http://www.free-av.com|`|oDwcQpV8aa	There is not a single program that will catch "everything".

AVG Free does not come with a firewall component, and from your description that is something you require.

As stated above, however, no system is "perfect" and will definitively protect you from everything forever.
b301fdd2f7f0f686b01337263980d14baa	Neither ... it's entirely an environmental factor.  So long as the PC is properly cooled & has effective surge protection leaving it on will not damage it.    The PC I'm using right now has been on for over 2 years. The only times I've turned it off was to upgrade or add hardware or to do some routine air dusting.   Never once on standby or hibernation.    The worst thing you can do to a PC is turn it off & on many times a day. The hot/cold effect is what wears out chips & semiconductors in any electronic component.     regards,  Philip T|`|rMs4WBfcaa	Leave it on, it is easier on the system than shutting it down and rebooting|`|4MYWPD9Yaa	It's bad to leave it on all the time, as it wastes energy.    Also, if your computer doesn't get proper ventilation, the excessive heat can damage parts.|`|rnzFaYM3aa	If you are not actively using the computer, it is better to put it on standby or shut it off. Leaving the computer on for prolonged periods will cause the fan and hard drive to fail at a faster rate, plus consumes electricity, increasing your bill.|`|895a9c5a15e6d6d3abafddf9e56a915aaa	good to be off if you want to save on you electric bill.  Also, computers nowadays are made to be left one for long period of time.  Now and then you should shut it down, to cool it off and free up memory that is cached.  You may noticed over a period of time that it is on, it might become slow and this can be caused by different reasons.  Any program that you install may or may not be made efficiently and if there are any memory leaks your ram will fill up and maybe eventually blue screen.  So in the end, you should always defrag once a month and turn it off now and again.|`|zokJMPBAaa	good name leave it off when not in use,but mine s are always on to recieved updates from windows update,i went to power options,set it for never and set it always on while off,harddrive mainly|`|5lnwpiyAaa	It's not a good thing to keep it on. If you keep it on, your computer may overheat, and the next time that you do something on it, it may just not work because of the excessive usage. My old computer broke because I never turned it off.    It also wastes electricity if you keep it on ;)|`|ab1ee2fc3ce86c9f2f98d7bab32a0ffbaa	there is nothing wrong with leaving your PC on all the time. only negative thing is your using more energy when its not in use. its more of a preference.    your PC hardware cannot overheat if its on all the time. this will only occur if a fan has failed which doesnt happen very often.    leaving a pc on all the time will not lower the life of your PC hardware. you are better off leaving it on unless you dont want to pay for the electric bill.|`|E6LeDCmCaa	It takes more energy to start a computer than it does to run it for 3 hours!    I like to turn off my computer at night, unless it is doing something important, like automated maintenance!    After all it is actually beneficial to restart your computer everyonce and awhile! It helps preserve your file structure!    It comes down to user choice, but if you choose to leave it on more, make sure you shut it down and dust it out every once and awhile!    Best of luck!    -Brandon F.|`|EwRt81d5aa	it depends... if you have the computer stored in a hot room... then I suggest you turn it off. If the room is humid, I suggest you leave it on or at least, turn it on every day! It is not either good or bad. My computer is on all the time, but that's me!|`|YK5Mg2wBaa	It does not hurt to leave it on if you have it go to sleep mode after a while, because if you don't the hard drive, fans, and other hardware may be running all the time, and they have a limited life span like anything else. If you use it and you know u won't use it again till like the next day, then I would go ahead and turn it off, especially if you have DSL/Cable internet. The longer your PC is just sitting on the internet, the more time a hacker has to hack into your system.  It is good to restart it every once in a while anyway.|`|AA11811364	All things being equal, you'll hear arguments going both ways.  So just let me enumerate the pros and cons of each.    LEAVE IT ON ?    Pros - Always ready for work, prevents any moisture buildup, no bootup delays  Cons - Uses electricity all the time it's on, vulnerability to hackers and intruders if you're using broadband, "wear & tear" on electrical parts    TURN IT OFF ?    Pros - Saves electricity, allows the moving parts to rest, eliminates intruder vulnerability while off  Cons - Bootup delays, permits moisture buildup as weather changes    So you see there's no really right or wrong answer.  Except maybe an analogy similar to use of a car.  I'd suggest that if you use your computer regularly every 1 to 2 hours each day, leave it on.  This prevents the constant churning of continuous power-up, power-off, warm-up, cool off sequences which, I suspect can age both the electrical and mechanical parts.  Factor in your bootup wait time.    However, if you use your computer for a while, then have no use until after work, I'd shut it down.  Same for overnight.  So maybe the answer to your question lies in your individual usage patterns.    Hope this helps....

AA11622701	Before Windows was created, all PCs ran on a program called DOS.  It consisted of a bunch of commands that you typed in on a blank screen to make things happen.  Such as "dir" show you the list (directory) of all the files on a disk, or "con" sent information the console (monitor).  Those commands are "reserved" and can not be used within other commands, or it confuses the computer.      If you were to name a folder "con", for example, and then use a command to change to that folder, when Windows finds the word "con", it will not know whether it is suppose to change to that directory or display it on the screen.  So to prevent you from accidently crashing the computer, Windows prevents you from being able to use those command words as files or folder names.  They are "reserved" so that you can not use them.|`|aRyi9P9oaa	You can't name a file "con".  You can't have two folders with the same name even if you change caps, windows is not case sensitive.  You can't use special symbols or characters other than the ones on your keyboard except : / \ *  : " ? |  Sometimes characters from other languages can be used in file name-ing, but not all the time.

DVD-R DL discs hold 8.54 GB (7.96 GiB) per side by utilizing two recordable dye layers, each capable of storing nearly the 4.7 GB (4.38 GiB) of a single layer disc -almost doubling the total disc capacity. Discs can be read in many DVD devices (older units are less compatible) and can only be written using DVD-R DL compatible recorders.    DVD+R DL (DL stands for Double Layer) also called DVD+R9, is a derivative of the DVD+R format created by the DVD+RW Alliance. Its use was first demonstrated in October 2003. DVD+R DL discs employ two recordable dye layers, each capable of storing nearly the 4.7 GB capacity of a single-layer disc, almost doubling the total disc capacity to 8.55 GB (or 7.96 GiB). Discs can be read in many DVD devices (older units are less compatible) and can only be created using DVD+R DL and Super Multi drives. DL drives started appearing on the market during mid 2004, at prices comparable to those of existing single-layer drives. However, the price of DL media ($0.75 to $2 USD per disc) is many times that of single-layer media($0.30 to $0.75 USD per disc). The latest DL drives write double layer discs at a slower rate (up to 16) than current single-layer media (up to 20).    source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVD%2BR_DL              http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVD-R_DL

oZetG3lCaa	Persistence of vision is the phenomenon of the eye by which even nanoseconds of exposure to an image result in milliseconds of reaction (sight) from the retina to the optic nerves. This is because persistence of vision depends on chemical transmission of nerve responses, and this biochemical hysteresis is much slower than the light transmission.    The myth of persistence of vision refers to the mistaken belief that human perception of motion (brain centered) is the result of persistence of vision (eye centered). The myth was debunked in 1912 by Wertheimer but persists in many citations in modern texts.[citation needed] Motion perception has been shown to be the result of the Beta Phenomenon.    A visual form of memory known as iconic memory has been described as the cause of this phenomenon. Although psychologists and physiologists have rejected the relevance of this theory to film viewership, film academics and theorists generally have not. Some scientists nowadays consider the entire theory a myth.    Persistence of vision should be compared with the related phenomena of beta movement and phi movement. A critical part of understanding these visual perception phenomena is that the eye is not a camera: there is no "frame rate" or "scan rate" in the eye; instead, the eye/brain system has a combination of motion detectors, detail detectors and pattern detectors, of which each output is combined to create the visual experience.

7ZfGqo3qaa	No.    It's good for today's casual games like the Sims 2, but isn't a good choice for future games or anything considered high-end.    The 9500GT costs almost as much as the 9600GT, which is twice as fast.  You're better off getting a Radeon 4670 for the same price, or spending a little more and getting a Geforce 9600GT or Radeon 4830.    The 1gb of video memory doesn't help, because the 9500GT can't handle the high resolutions where 512mb vs 1gb starts to matter.    See performance comparisons below:|`|2f47a7fb887504f90dec5b605dd5f63baa	should work for sims3 but maybe not on high settings, these cards are good deals: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...  http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...    given that your power supply meets the requirements|`|AA11703028	hi mate            to be honest not really,however if you run your games at lower resolution(1024x768) and lower detail settings you should get some acceptable frame rates            the main drawback with the geforce 9500gt is its low memory clock speed and 128bit memory bus interface,allthough these specs are not too bad(1600mhz ddrr effective memory clock) to really acheive high frame rates in the latest games you need a card such as the 9600gt(geforce 9800gt even better) which come with a 256bit memory bus interface and a 1800mhz memory clock            the geforce 9600gt has identical core and memory clock speeds to the 9800gt however the 9800gt has 128 shader processes compared to just 64 in the geforce 9600gt             and the geforce 9500gt has just 32 shader processes so thats quarter of the 9800gt             ok the 9500gt has a full 1gb of gddr3 memory which is ideal for todays memory intensive games but the other specs need to be superior aswell and a few things let the 9500gt down             "however" as a general budget gaming card the geforce 9500gt is a decent purchase ,and probally the best sub 50 card around,however in the same catergory theres the ATi Radeon HD 4670(http://www.aria.co.uk/Products/Component...            this has some decent specs,however the inclusion of the same paltry 128bit memory bus is a worry             however the other specs which include a 750mhz core clock and 512mb of gddr3 memory running at 1000mhz(2000mhz ddr effective) are excellent and the 320 shader cores(processes) make this a excellent budget gaming card            on a pure price to performance ratio the geforce 9500gt wins,mainly because its a good 20 less than the radeon HD4670 however if you can afford the HD4670 then its worth that little extra             a few factors to remember when looking for a new graphics card are :   1) core and memory clock speeds(higher memory clock speeds are more important than a high core clock speed)   2) memory bus interface : this is a important spec in the card and the higher the better,some of the top cards have a 256bit memory bus and the excellent gtx295 has a awesome 448bit memory bus   3)shader processes : this is the amount of cores the card has and were previously known as pixel pipelines however a card that previously has 24 pixel pipelines would compare equaly to a card today with around 128 shader processes   4)pixel and shader model : This relates to a cards DirectX compliance. DirectX can be divided into two specifications, the Pixel Shader Model, and the Vertex Shader Model. Each model has different hardware requirements, and when you take both into account you can determine the overall DirectX version.   5)direct x compliance : DirectX is an API created and maintained by Microsoft for the purpose of programming 3D applications. With different versions of DirectX new capabilities are added, and the minimum requirements for support go up. For example, version 9 of DirectX introduced pixel shader version 2.0 support, so in order for a card to be DirectX 9 compliant, it would have to support PS 2.0 (as well as other requirements).  Game developers target their games to these DirectX levels. Often they'll create multiple different modes to support different versions of DirectX and thus different generations of video cards. Older cards which don't support the latest DirectX version often have to use downgraded visuals in order to get a game to play.          taking all these into consideration you can work out which is the best card for a) your specific pc and b) the type of games you run         however the geforce 9500gt is a excellent card if run in s.l.i configurations( 2 cards) and they are popular since you can get 2 x geforce 9500gt for less than 90            any problems let me know                 good luck mate !|`|bxV80Clnaa	If I'm write in thinking that the 9500 is virtually the same as the 8500 then no, that's a slow card by today's standards. Go for a Radeon 4850 or maybe save some cash by getting a 2nd hand 8800gt or gts 512. They aren't produced anymore but are still fast. Four times faster than an 8500gt|`|2mlHf7Opaa	That's a kind of slow video card.  You want a 9800GT, minimum.  They cost around $100.|`|1ec5c3ef48df0b4438ce6e3638f0bdeaaa	sims 3 is far from a top of the range game, provided the rest of your pc is good it will run sims 3 very well, and to the person above the 9500gt is actually similar to the 8600gt more than the 8500gt seeing as it has 32 shaders not 16.    i would reccomend a better card though like a hd3850 or a hd4650 (essentially the same card) if youre on a budget. if you can get some more money then go for a 9800gt or a hd4830|`|AA11407193	Yeah, but you'll still need ram and a good processor.|`|pacGKaYFaa	Simple:  No.    The Sims is a casual game, not top of the range, and although that card would play it; you'd be better of getting a slightly better card, like the GeForce 9600GT, which is only marginally more expensive. Anyway good luck in whatever you choose!

How did JFK play into this?  Good question !!  JFK committed us to the Apollo space program.

PDF's are usually either converted from an original word document, or a publisher file. - The text from these can be easily copied and pasted. (unless they have specific security locks on them)... (which is unlikley).    The alternative is that your trying to copy text from a PDF that was made up from a piece of scanned paper. - This you will NOT be able to copy and paste into word with.    If thats the case, your only possible option is to google 'PDF word recognition, or OCR' and see what you can find...|`|8czfrHBEaa	For that specific purpose, you can always convert your pdf into word or some other formats.

Above all that it fell vertically on the ground only once and half of the screen was broken, fixing it would cost me the price of 2 brand new laptops..

Dfr6uA91aa	To be short, yes. If the RAM is cleared, any unarchived programs or variables will be deleted.    However, archiving the program will move it to Archive memory, so a RAM clear would only erase the contents in RAM memory, not Archive.    To archive a program, you can go to [2nd] Mem > Archive > press Prgm to choose the program you want to keep and press enter. This will prevent RAM clears from erasing those programs. In order to use those programs again, just Unarchive them ([2nd] Mem > Unarchive > follow above steps).    Note however, this won't protect against Archive clears, or Resetting to factory default. If that happens, there's not much you can do.|`|HYk5jhnqaa	Your question is not too ..exact  Clear the RAM ? Like physically  clear the RAM??    "Random-access memory (usually known by its acronym, RAM) is a form of computer data storage. Today it takes the form of integrated circuits that allow the stored data to be accessed in any order (i.e., at random). The word random thus refers to the fact that any piece of data can be returned in a constant time, regardless of its physical location and whether or not it is related to the previous piece of data"    There is no data on your RAM that you can access like you do with your hard-drive|`|rB86DhJiaa	Yes. If the calculator is cleared, you will lose those programs. Teachers know about the ability of these calculators to add programs so they will usually have students clear the calculator before an exam. My best advice, use the program to check your work, not actually do the work. This way when test time comes, if the calculator is cleared, you still know how to do the problems and in the mean time, you are sure your answers are right. Good luck!    In response to the above comment, the ti-83 does not have a hard drive. Information is stored in the memory. There are two types, RAM and ARC which is storage memory. I believe both are cleared together.

You say you want to write code in C? And you'll use VB/VC++? No way.    As far as I am concerned, Visual C++ (the closest between the two to C) doesn't compile C code.

0003934bb4332a9e445607b7d52efbdeaa	You really should Defrag your computer at least once a month. If you have never done it you will notice a difference in the speed at which your programs open...    Yes it can take a VERY long time to run if you have never fun it before! So set it to run at night while you are asleep. Make sure to set your computer so it will not Hibernate, also disable the internet connection as this will not be needed during the Defrag process...    Now as to your game Lag problem, Have you looked for an update for your Grafix card?? You can find the latest drivers for it on the manufactures web site for FREE & this might help the game play...    Good Luck!|`|4YmB7q5jaa	it improves it some|`|2mlHf7Opaa	I know this is an unpopular opinion, but defragging your hard drive is not really all that important any more.  Sure, after moving around gigabytes of information, like installing a huge, multi-DVD game, your file system will be fragmented as hell, but NTFS is really quite a nice file system.  It doesn't need to be defragged every day, like FAT32 did.  Unless you're installing/removing lots of huge games, I'd say that once a month is fine...  even less often, if you're unconcerned about having a 100% high-performance system.    I'm running Vista x64 Ultimate SP1, also, and task manager runs defrag every week automatically.  I'm sure your system does the same.  I never felt compelled to go into the task manager and disable it, since it usually runs when I'm asleep.  It doesn't hurt anything to run it so frequently, though I, personally, think it's a bit excessive.|`|wiJz0FYLaa	If there is file fragmentation, then defragging will improve performance. With games, sometimes, it can make a HUGE difference. I was able to stop the stuttering in Oblivion (2 years ago) only after defragging the heavily fragmented Oblivion files.    If there is no fragmentation to begin with, you wont see much of a difference after defragging.    I suggest you try something more powerful and thorough such as Diskeeper 2009 professional rather than relying on Vista's clunky defragger. Diskeeper is the best defragger I've used, especially on Vista (32-bit in my case). http://www.diskeeper.com has free trial versions|`|dILqe7nBaa	depends how bad it is 2 to 5 hours or less  http://www.microsoft.com/atwork/getstart...|`|14d0ad3dfdb4dd36a9f896b96a702e69aa	With a fairly fresh OS, unless you've got multiple, very large games, defrag may not make a difference that will astonish you...it may need an overall maintenance procedure.  You did not mention if these game lags were for on-line gaming: if that's the case, then I'd look for connection issues.    Have a look @ this:  Glary Utilities Free   includes a variety of system tools that can help you clean your PC from junk files, remove Internet traces, find invalid registry entries, manage startup programs, optimize system memory and more. The program also includes a disk space inspector to locate large folders and files, as well as a Context Menu Manager, that enables you to disabled unused right-click options for files and folders. Other features include and Internet Explorer Assistant, a Privacy Shredder for secure file deletion and an encryption tool.  Freeware.  http://www.snapfiles.com/Freeware/system...
ID22rcp0aa	Go with the Gateway. It has the i7 chip with hyperthreading and DDR3 triple channel memory. I have this computer and it is great. The graphics card that came in it was a 1 gig ATI 4850 not the 512 advertised. This computer will not be outdated as fast as the elite. The gateway does not have a tv card and the drivers for the 64 bit operating system leave something to be desired. Although the 3rd party companies are working hard to resolve this.

iBrlojt4aa	You need to identify which part is causing the problem. It could be the charger, battery or the motherboard (or devices attached to the motherboard).  1) Check if you have lights on the charger, if no change the charger  2) Try to run the computer on another charger if possible  3) Try to run the computer only on battery  4) Try to run computer only on charger power  If above four things don't help you it's the motherboard (or devices attached to it) which is defective. What I believe is that the motherboard bios or video card has gone corrupt because you wrote "black screen with words". So the best thing would be to contact tech support if you have warranty because I feel that the motherboard needs to be replaced.

There is nothing that important that you have to bypass the internet filter that can't wait until school/work is dismissed. If you are discovered using the school/company computers for restricted sites, you will endure severe consequences; that you really don't want to. It's honestly not worth the repercussions involved.  There are plenty of sites your computer will allow that are far better than that, and worth your time.  They are blocked for several reasons, and there is no changing that. With the multitude of computer viruses spreading around, companies cannot take any chances.  Bypassing the filters set-up by companies is near impossible.

YZkj6HOUaa	Disk = Magnetic media, usually encased in a paper/plastic sleeve (floppy disks) or metal box (hard disks). This was the first spelling used when referring to computer disks.    Disc = Optical media (CD, DVD, etc). Discs are always removable, meaning you can eject them and take them physically out of your computer. The spelling change came from "Compact Disc", the trademarked name for CDs.    In English, both spellings are acceptable though the UK prefers "disc" and the US prefers "disk". The original spelling was "disk"; UK language experts in the 18th century changed to the "c" ending because they wanted to base it on the Latin root word "discus".|`|lvhQeDrwaa	Disc is the original word in the dictionary.

I would avoid dual layer dvds, sure they hold a lot, but for archiving, it's not the best since occasionally switching between the layers can cause issues if it isn't burned right. also when burning make sure you verify the contents and burn at a slow speed.

It may be hard for you to make a transition between the two, if ever you will have to make one.|`|2SSA9e9Naa	There are differences. VB.NET takes advantage of a lot of the .NET framework architecture. There are a lot of differences in dealing with the system objects and such. You can do a lot more with it.    That said, VB 6.0 is an easier language to deal with for a beginner. Once you get a handle on that you can move to .NET.    If you start with .NET you not only have to learn the VB language but the infrastructure around .NET. That can be pretty daunting.    I'm providing a couple of links so you can see.|`|JH0pI9TJaa	VB is not fully object oriented, it supports only class not inheritance but VB.Net is fully oops. VB 6.0 is older version and VB.Net is latest version so .Net better then VB. But you should learn VB 6.0 first because first of all make your base strong in VB, then it will help your  to get proficiency in VB.Net.

0abf52e9048e05a852e90e1316728b92aa	When you are printing stuff from the internet (web pages, email, etc.) the reason for the small, or in your case large print, is that it is related to the size of the monitor and it's viewing setup (the higher the screen resolution, the smaller the print and the lower the screen resolution the larger the print will be when printing it out, even though it looks good on the monitor).    One of the easiest ways you can make the print larger, or smaller, when printing internet stuff & emails is by changing the print view size on the screen to a larger size or smaller size. One way is to go to the menu bar at the top (Internet Explorer), click on "View," then "Text Size" then select a size like "Smaller" or "Smallest" to reduce your print size problem (something lower than what you're currently set to.) You can also use Control (Crtl) key along with the "+" and "-" signs on the keyboard to enlarge or shrink the screen magnification to make the print larger or smaller. Basically you need to make the print smaller on the screen and then when you print your print will come out smaller too. Then you can change it back for the regular viewing.    The only other method is to copy & paste the text into a text editing software like Word and adjust the text size there. If you're using a text program, then you simply adjust the size of the text to a 12 point, or smaller, font size (adjust depending on the font and size you need) and that should do the trick.    Best of luck.|`|TkqRjcT7aa	reduce ur font size by selecting font size select new times romain . the normal font size is 12 . u can't see this clearly in system unless u use zoom . if u do this ur problem will be solved.

89IlUiDNaa	"Spyware is computer software that is installed surreptitiously on a personal computer to intercept or take partial control over the user's interaction with the computer, without the user's informed consent.    While the term spyware suggests software that secretly monitors the user's behavior, the functions of spyware extend well beyond simple monitoring. Spyware programs can collect various types of personal information, such as Internet surfing habits, sites that have been visited, but can also interfere with user control of the computer in other ways, such as installing additional software, and redirecting Web browser activity. Spyware is known to change computer settings, resulting in slow connection speeds, different home pages, and/or loss of Internet or functionality of other programs. In an attempt to increase the understanding of spyware, a more formal classification of its included software types is captured under the term privacy-invasive software."    here is the source ...  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spyware    read more about how to protect ur pc and insure security here ..  http://articles.onlineweblibrary.com/Art...    wish i've helped :)  Andy|`|9AR6B4ELaa	most of the spyware programs are virus. and it may corrupt or damage the files on your pc.|`|EamhENYJaa	It slows down your computer.

AA10954273	You can't, at least not legally.  Apple's motherboards all have a special security chip on them.  Mac OS is designed not to install or run if it doesn't find that chip.  The only way around this is to install an illegally cracked version of the OS.  It can't be patched or updated since the crack will be detected.  And since Apple only includes drivers for their own hardware, you have to either write your own drivers or trust some hacker to do it for you.  You end up with a system that's illegal, unstable, and possibly pre-infected with a keylogger or trojan of some sort.|`|3DXXk2ukaa	you can't legally and it won't run on amd it has to be intel and if you have to ask how to illegally install mac os on your pc you prolly can't hack and won't be able to install it, you have to buy a mac to run mac osx|`|NzkPEKYgaa	I'm sorry you can't.

If you click the link you will see a tree structure with headlines and body text for each article.    In order to read the file, you will need to use either PHP (or another server side language).

I used to think this problem was related to buying cheap computers but after buying various laptops and desktops at different price ranges there is one common theme, eventually they will all crash at some stage!   Friends will often think I am a pc expert and will call me asking "How do I fix my pc when it keeps crashing?" Well start by asking yourself these questions...  Have your children be on the pc? Kids are great at downloading spyware by mistake! They will also click on numerous pop up pages and will often change your settings!  Another possible reason your pc keeps crashing is that you have overloaded it! If your pc only has 64mb RAM memory and you install graphic, gaming and other software the chances are that your system will not be able to cope with your software! Most PC's now come with at least 512mb RAM so it is worth upgrading if your pc is not at this level.  However the most common reason that your pc keeps crashing is that it has a virus! Many trojan virus can cause your computer to reboot immediately once all programs have been launched, this can drive you mad and it is not fun as you are helpless!  Best option is to install anti virus software and make sure you only visit trusted websites. If all else fails it is time to reformat your hard drive and wipe your pc clean, this can take hours and you will probably need the data recovery disc that you should have got when you bought the pc.  Recommend tool:  http://toptenantispywareviews.com [if you do not have one]|`|rMs4WBfcaa	No you will lose everything unless you save it first|`|4MYWPD9Yaa	Let's get the terminology straight here.    System Restore is a Windows feature that brings your system files and registry back to an earlier time. It does not affect your personal files.    Recovery (from a recovery partition or recovery disks) erases everything, including your personal files, and brings your computer back to the state you first got it in when you bought it.    If you're doing the latter, you should use a Linux live CD to back up your music first:  http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntucat/reco...|`|YSbDimGzaa	no need to clear stuff off........system recovery should restore computer settings to earlier date but will only knock stuff off that has been downloaded after restore date that is selected.....   crashing may be because of simple overheating........try cleaning fans and heatsink|`|cp4TYeZSaa	Yeah. Try to back up first all your music and files before clearing everything on your computer.|`|YESUhp8gaa	If you clean everything off (reformat the computer) your music and itunes stuff will be erased and then be overwritten during the system recovery. And not even the best file recovery programs will help you at that point.|`|70YyELYxaa	unless you have saved everything from ITUNES onto an outside source, you CANNOT get it back. I had a virus and wanted to get my computer wiped, and had to burn CD's of all my MP3's as a backup. You can not load it all on to the IPOD, then put the music FROM the IPOD "to" the computer. I thought I cleverly thought of that, but was told by a friend it dosen't work that way. FYI, Call an Apple store if you have more ?s|`|xhJwJOwaaa	Which operating system do you use? Macintosh or Windows.  In mac itunes saves a copy of each song u add in its library so it would be in user accounts folder somewhere. u can determine the exact place by right clicking any song and clicking on "show in finder" option.  For windows i am not exactly sure but it works somewhat same to mac i mean copies songs in library. you can format p.c after backing up the songs or else they will be deleted. because i tunes uses same partition whoch o.s uses.

zorYTX59aa	Several times each day, YouTube shuts down a few of their   servers to update stuff. Be patient if YouTube is slow, stuck  or mangled. Transmissions from YouTube to your computer  are done in multiple tiny packets of data and flash at a time.   That's why sometimes you may get any of these scenarios:   bits and pieces of text/thumbnails in weird places; sluggish  loading/buffering; the spinning circle going on forever; or the  player being blank. This problem could fix itself within a few   hours or by the next day.    If your YouTube continues to behave slow, stuck or strange,  it's very possible that your directories of "temporary internet   files" and RAM (sometimes known as "cache") are close to  the maximum and just cannot take anymore, the end result   being any of the above scenarios or videos that: A) come to   a complete freeze; B) start/stop/start/stop in a choppy way;   or C) never even make it onto your screen.    "Temporary internet files" are tiny bits of webpages that get   permanently put on your hard-drive. They will remain forever  on your computer, gradually plugging it up like hair stuck in   a sink drain, until you finally get rid of them -- or "clear your   cache" of "temporary internet files", "cookies", and "history".  Then reboot.    If you're not sure how to delete your "cache" or if you would  like more "tips" on making YouTube run even better without   having to buy/install a thing, then please click on my avatar   and send me a message -- preferably with your YouTube or   email address. I will guide you step-by-step in plain English   and with full explanations.    Note 1: if you've got Google Web Accelerator, or something  similar to it,...dump it, burn it, trash it, disable it, uninstall it;   -- do everything you can to get rid of it. Not only does GWA  conflict with and ruin YouTube, using "Don't Accelerate This   Website" won't help you whatsoever.    Note 2: longer-running videos need "Flash" and "Shockwave"   in order to play smoothly. You don't need anything else.    Note 3: a strange fix that once worked for me was changing  the URL from "www.youtube.com" to just "youtube.com" (or   you could even try "ca.youtube.com").    I hope that my information proves to be a little helpful to you.|`|d7kC9WPKaa	bug on the computer|`|PCq01HVDaa	mine isnt like that , unless its the new layout n aint *** 2 my laptop yet. check u havnt gt the trojan virus.completely messes up ur pc or mac , we almost got it.

xhc3d6wLaa	There could be two reasons 1) You need correct font 2) You are using MS Office 2003 and trying to open MS Office 2007 file. If you need correct font then get the required font and the file will show up. If you want to open MSO2007 files in MSO2003 then visit Microsoft website and download a small utility. Its free and easy to install. Or just use this link to download. Hope this will help a bit :)    Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File Formats    http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/detai...|`|g54tGcRvaa	I don't think it's encrypted, you might be using a different .doc format.  Different versions of MS Word export different .doc formats, so it's better to use .rtf.  If you can read any text in the file, check the beginning and end to see if it clues you in to what program saved the file.  Then I would try to get that word processor and try to open it from there.
PDIKYPQVaa	there is no legal way to get word 2007 for free. it sounds like you got the trial with a purchase of a new pc. microsoft has a trail for office 2007 for 60 days. I would try that first. it might allow you to register all of office.    illegally, there are plenty of torrent sites that would have it. microsoft has been cracking down on pirated software, so it's getting harder and harder to keep an illegal copy and having them go through updates w/o getting caught. I've given up pirating stuff from microsoft.    some alternatives are open office, it's compatible with microsoft products, so you can open and save as word documents. it's an open source program that is completely free. http://www.openoffice.org/    if you absolutely need word 2007, you can reformat your computer, and re-register with a different serial every time your expiration is up. backing up your computer would be important every time.    a similar thing you can try is virtual machine, http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/detai... same thing, instead you're running a separate copy of windows inside of your computer. it eats up a lot of resources, but it would allow you to do the same thing as above without reinstalling and losing your data each time.    if you can afford it, try to buy the student teacher edition of office. I've seen it online for less than $100, most places won't ask for student id.|`|c290b7856214fd8baaebf9e77a554dffaa	The latest version of open office will open your word 2007 file and you can continue working on it, print it etc.    http://www.openoffice.org/|`|9BL6LFJ9aa	sorry but that cannot be done legally.

Download it from www.download.com.  Good luck!|`|g62ATenqaa	as you are a student you can get student version which is not at all costly.  You can't expect to extend  trial period which is to see whether you like a program or not and obviously you do. Alternatively as people will suggest, use Openoffice which is free save for a donation which I hope people are making, but it is nowhere as good as Microsoft when you get beyond the basics.|`|nBuUfUdkaa	Sure, then you can write to me on it FROM PRISON!!|`|KQpT68AKaa	Re Openoffice.

HXW4i5Ajaa	This all depends upon where you are asking this question from. If you are asking this as an end user, a customer of an ISP, there is not a lot you can do. You can minimise the number of devices you use - removing a router and connecting a PC directly to the internet may reduce a little bit of latency.    In terms of network design, you need to add as few hops as possible.   All devices should be carefully selected, and any choice of forwarding mode decided upon - there used to be three main modes of forwarding on a LAN switch for example - store & forward, cut through & Frag Free.     Store and forward was the slowest, as the whole packet had to be read before it could be forwarded, but leads to an absolute minimum of forwarding delays.    Cut through was the fastest (lowest latency) as the packet was being forwarded as soon as enough of it had been read to make the forwarding decision. Frag free was a compromise that meant fewer collision fragments were forwarded.    Choice of link type can make a difference - sat links are the worst for latency!    Careful positioning of security devices is important too. Firewalls are often built upon server-type hardware and will run as store and forward, as they need to inspect the packet carefully. Obviously that can add a little latency!|`|n68rcu9Naa	Linux|`|SImSGKEtaa	the latency is most likely due to bandwidth utilization on your segment.  You could choose a carrier that gives a guarantee of x-Mb of bandwidth at all times... sort of a service level agreement.

ZkELw9wzaa	Your school filter can detect a proxy as soon as you try it and either block it on the fly or notify an admin to block it manually. The bottom line is that all proxy's will eventually get blocked. As the filtering software gets more advanced they will get blocked faster and faster.    There is also the question of the rules and laws you are breaking by trying to hack your school security system.    Finally even if you got a proxy to work for a short time you are inviting the proxy owner, many of whom are using the proxy for hacking purposes, to infect and or hijack your school network.

There is nothing that important that you have to bypass the internet filter that can't wait until school/work is dismissed. If you are discovered using the school/company computers for restricted sites, you will endure severe consequences; that you really don't want to. It's honestly not worth the repercussions involved.  There are plenty of sites your computer will allow that are far better than that, and worth your time.  They are blocked for several reasons, and there is no changing that. With the multitude of computer viruses spreading around, companies cannot take any chances.  Bypassing the filters set-up by companies is near impossible.

AA12271834	When managing different people on different IM clients (Yahoo! Messenger, MSN, Google Talk, Skype, Spark, SameTime, etc), you need access to each client and have an account on each client.  I would suggest using a joint client like Pidgin or Trillian which allows you to mix the contact lists from different IM clients together (you still can't conference people that don't have the same client info, but you can have a separate conference call for each group and copy and paste between the multiple conferences).  You will need to have a dummy account with each client that you want to chat with (ie a gmail account for Google Talk, a Yahoo! account for Yahoo! Messanger, etc.).
C2aWncmkaa	There are pests on the Internet who set their computers up to constantly ping random IP addresses, they hope to find a computer respond, and then they "probe" the computer to see if it is vunerable so they can start a malware attack.    I tried looking up the IP addresses that ZoneAlarm reported but many of them went nowhere, I figured they were home broadband accounts that malware had turned into zombies that were sending out the pings.    The best way to avoid "Ping" is to have a router, it swallows the Ping without responding to it.  So these pests don't know if a computer is there or not.    But you can Ping other computers - open a command window and type    ping yahoo.com    and see what happens.    Here's what I got (the last two lines) :    Approximate round trip times in milli-seconds:  Minimum = 61 ms, Maximum = 62 ms, Average = 61 ms    For some websites, you will get a long list of information.  .  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ping  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ping_flood|`|SImSGKEtaa	it is unlikely but possible that icmp echos are being sent by your dsl carrier to check for life.  most of the time they dont use ICMP for this though..

This is a shady attempt to get you to buy something you don't need - as you already know.     First, try using a program called Ad-Aware. I've been using it for years and it works great. It searches your computer for mal-ware and spyware.    If I'm working on someone computer and I can't use ad-aware i usually search something unique in the file name or link. For example you can search your c:\windows for the word photobucket. Nothing legit should be named photobucket in your windows directory. Or you can search the registry using regedit for photobucket and analyze the results for suspicious looking entries.     Look for anything suspicious in c:\documents and settings\yourname\Local Settings\Application Data + whatever browser you are using.     Log into your computer as another user and see if this happens. If it does try uninstalling and reinstalling your browser.    If its still happening you might need to take it in somewhere.

Hope someone can help us all|`|u3fhnwVAaa	After a month of the annoying screen and lately getting the message more often, i maybe know the reason.  The NIS2009 liveupdate that you use via the GUI is exclusive to that product, if you click the liveupdate there, there is no problem, right?  The reason for the error is that other liveupdate program is trying to update your NIS so it fails. If you click, start, run, "luall.exe" you execute that liveupdate that is not compatible with NIS2009 (maybe you have more than one Symantec product or you used to have an earlier version of NIS and you just update it and never unistalled the Liveupdate component, which was my case).  So to solve it you can try to just uninstall the liveupdate program via Add/Remove programs in the control panel and it might work, I realize all of this after I uninstalled completly NIS2009 and liveupdate from add/remove programs and then used the Norton Removal Tool NRT from symantec, and when i tried to intall the lastest package installer of the liveupdate "lusetup.exe" after reinstall NIS2009 it didn't register NIS2009 in the update program list.    In concusion just uninstall the liveupdate via Add/Remove programs (this does't affects the liveupdate of NIS2009) or completly uninstall the symantec products with the NRT and reinstall.    Hope this helps

It's so bad you can't even open your mouth in private now without some creep snitching on you to the authorities.    This world is heading very quickly back to the bad old days of the KGB [Komitjet Gosudarstvjennoj Bjezopasnosti] and the Gestapo [Geheime Staats Polizie] for snitching.|`|iqZUd5Fdaa	Warrrrrrrrrrrrgggh|`|9Lqji6bpaa	wookie?|`|Fex51ntIaa	Ewoks might be a bit annoyed.

Then, click on something like What's New in Vista.    My computer has 14 icons Getting Started with Windows, but 6 of them were hidden until I clicked Show All. Then, Windows Vista Demos popped up.|`|RbuH4YtGaa	If you have the restore disk that came with the computer, you can reset the computer back to the factory settings. The only downside is you will have to probably update your software and applications which may take a long time. What do you need the tutorial help with?|`|15y1W4ocaa	just bye a new computer thats what i would do

Then grab hold of a blank part of the task bar (with no icons or buttons on it) and then just pull it down to the bottom of the screen.    When it has moved, right-click and select "lock the taskbar"    If it won't move down - chances are it is ether locked - or you are just not pulling it down enough. Grab it by the middle and pull in down to the middle bottom - all the way down.

(I still have one on the shelf - it has zero apparent defects, but can't be used to boot.)  Install a Linux distro.  If that won't boot either (the boot process in Linux is different than the boot process in Windows), you can try a formatting tool from the hard drive manufacturer's site that will format the master boot record also.  If that fails, it's time for you to see what Seagate has to offer.|`|0003934bb4332a9e445607b7d52efbdeaa	Your hard drive has FAILED... Not completely, but enough to where it will not let the system BOOT.. It is most likely a non-stable rotation speed, this will cause massive data errors.

Make sure you are loading your HD first and not still trying to boot from cd or flash drive or somethin.

Limewire and most of the stuff yer downloading is probably virus playground.|`|fB0gmEioaa	limewire has detected a firewall on my laptop,how do i stop this?    It should be the other way around where your  firewall detected limewire. Limewire is full of Viruses so be careful what  you download.|`|cp4TYeZSaa	Probably, it's fine. Don't turn off your firewall even if limewire has detected it. Firewall prevents all viruses that may infect your computer. All you have to do is to ignore it. That's it.
