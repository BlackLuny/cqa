ovPfkHSCaa	Whether your hair is naturally curly or naturally straight, you can have a curly hairstyle. Curly hairstyles are great for formal occasions, attention grabbing at work and fun for casual wear.

nidCgr73aa	Make sure you cleanse, tone and moisturise your face. You can buy cleansing wipes with toner built in for around a pound from chemists. Simple do great moisturisers and ones for greasy/oily skin - check there website.<br>  <br>  I recommend Maybelline Dream Matte Mousse foundation (and concealer if necessary) since hess the name it makes your skin "matte" looking with no shine but you do not look caked in make-up either.<br>  <br>  Next to stop even more shine and keep the foundation on I use Rimmel Stay Matte Pressed Powder which is around three to four pound. Excellent quality and results too.<br>  <br>  That keeps me through the day but remember to cleanse, tone and moisturise your face at night too, to get the make-up off!<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!|`|Q683orIMaa	Well if you have really oily and shiny skin then you need something like Clinique's dramatically different moisturizing GEL not lotion. I have the same problem with shiny skin and this gel moisturizes my skin without overdoing it. I think its the best moisturizer for oily skin. Foundation... i would go with Bobbi Brown they have the best oil free foundation. Sesheido's oil free cleasing foam also does wonders as a cleanser.|`|l3rJFgveaa	ok, so first you should get a cleanser that help with shine like this one <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.drugstore.com/qxp164351_333181_sespider/clean_and_clear_morning_burst/shine_control_facial_cleanser_with_bursting_beads.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.drugstore.com/qxp164351_33318...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  then you should maybe look at the makeup your a using, if youare wearing any. Try a foundation that is oil free. <br>  <br>  <br>  If you still have oil problems look no further than a oil blotting sheet such as this one  <a href="http://www.drugstore.com/qxp168374_333181_sespider/neutrogena/shine_control_blotting_sheets.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.drugstore.com/qxp168374_33318...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  If all else fails then go buy a pressed or loose finishing powder, like this one from bare minerals;<a href="http://www.sephora.com/browse/product.jhtml?id=P61004" rel="nofollow">http://www.sephora.com/browse/product.jh...</a> <br>   it takes all your shine away, but you maybe have to reaply it through out the day.  Or anyother light powder you think would do the trick. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Remember always have a good diet, full or fruits and vegetables and lots of water. This will help your skin. Also if that still isnt enought, try taking Vitamine E  or a multivitamin, you maybe lacking in some oil fighting nutrients|`|yWoK9ryJaa	As a professional makeup artist for over 20 years I highly recommend and my clients will not leave home with the Bee Luscious Pore Perfecting Face Primer.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.beeluscious.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.beeluscious.com</a>|`|Ria9c8Roaa	Okay, if its your makeup, you can use pimple wipes(the ones that you rub your face and then its supposed 2 clear your face in a few hrs/the nxt day) before you put on your makeup.

Do not use liquid makeup for a shiny face. <br>  -Eat fruits and veggies<br>  <br>  You should see improvement after doing some of these things.|`|s5gxtLvTaa	maybelline dream matte mousse. preferably one of the lightest shades, because if you go to different to your natural colour, when it rubs off it will look really strange. top up every few hours just in case :) oh and make sure you take your make up off at night and drink lots of water. overnight faced masks help a lot too :)|`|9UgGwvtlaa	My favorite qualiy item that caters to ur problem is the MAC blotting powder.<br>  it works wonders<br>  <br>  but if u cant afford MAC products i would suggest keeping blotting paper in ur purse or translucent powder.|`|IW3jmnKbaa	We here at Chucks auto-body, use a fine emery paper to break the shine, or a 00 steel wool, followed with a tack cloth, in a slightly damp atmosphere, to prevent the re occurrence of micro-particulate infiltration upon the substrate.

388cf0eaa7a2668947f521c57a657534aa	If you have a Rite Aid near you, go there and check out their Colorstay foundations. They should have the very same collection of shades as WalMart does and at Rite Aid, you can take a foundation home and try it, if you don't like it, bring it back, no questions asked. That's one of their better policies. <br>  <br>  Also, it might run a few dollars more than WalMart as far as price goes, but just figure out your shade, take it back, and go to WalMart and buy it.<br>  (Rite Aid often has buy-on-get-one-free on their Revlon products or buy-one-get-one-half-off, and if that's the case, you may be better off getting it from Rite Aid)<br>  <br>  Best of luck!

92fbce946753f473dafcf78d171f5a2baa	LOVE & USE:<br>  foundation has spf 15- $25<br>  <br>  lip glosses (theyre sticky though)- $18<br>  <br>  NEVER USED:<br>  their concealer<br>  <br>  OK:<br>  eyeshadows,they dont stay on that long but they look kindof pretty, and they arent very vibrant - $13<br>  <br>  EDIT: the people that are saying it doesnt cover anything uhmm actuallly it covers any redness and unevenness in my skin, the color matches welll, it just makees me a little more tan, maybe the girls mom and sister got the wrong shades, and it doesnt clog pores for me, since i started using it my skin actually didnt break out at all. even if i forgot to wash it off at night.<br>  <br>  so welllit reallly works well for me, you just have to know how to use it and to buff it into your skin|`|OmzJq7EIaa	The foundation is wonderful, haven't tried anything else though.<br>  <br>  I have heard the foundation causes an allergic reaction in some people though but I don't think it's that common.  It covers well and does look natural assuming you apply it correctly.  It is a bit tricky to get a hang of the proper application (make sure you use the swirl, tap, buff method) and it may take a few times to make it look best.  It doesn't cover super heavily (unless you apply a whole lot, but then it will look cakey) but it does a good job with any minor/moderate flaws (dark circles, small zits) It gives your skin an almost airbrushed look, especially when you use the mineral veil powder over the foundation.  <br>  <br>  My biggest complaint is that it is very messy to apply.  Be careful, you can easily spill $10 worth of makeup. The foundation is about $25 a jar, but I think it's worth it and would recommend you at least try it.  I've been wearing it about 2 years and haven't even bothered trying any other foundations since I found it.  I've seen negative feedback, but I suspect most people who don't like it are not applying it correctly, or applying too much of it (a little goes a LONG way)<br>  <br>  Can't speak for the rest of their products, but I would recommend you try their foundation first.|`|yWoK9ryJaa	Bare Minerals is the single worst product you can put on your face!<br>  <br>  It is not natural and in fact it contains as its main ingredient bismuth oxychloride which is a form or arsenic lead that clogs pores and irritates the skin.

GZKbvXLLaa	Honestly? The best thing to do at this point would be to throw out that bottle, and either use one which is newer, or buy a replacement. Sre, you could add a few drops of remover but that typically ruins the polish rather than to help it. It causes the polish to lose its luster so that it will look rather dull with no shine to it. Polish only last so long no matter how well you store it. Once its reached the point of being too thick or has partially dried, its best to throw it away.|`|5nfqY9T7aa	Just pour a little bit of nail polish remover in there and shake it for a while.<br>  <br>  Do NOT try to melt it with heat!

fqIE566Caa	Lemon juice but your hair is fine! Your hair colour is yours so no need to change as it is what will suit you best. If you keep changing, you'll soon become unhappy with who you are and constantly try and change yourself. <br>  Make up wise, try and stick to one or two items. You have good cheekbone structure so could continue to accentuate this with bronzer or go for the eye option of a good mascara and eyeliner. It depends on what you feel most comfortable with. <br>  I don't feel you need make up as you are only young and you should embrace your looks as they are.|`|olMVfnljaa	1) Wear a lighter shade of bronzer, but at 14, you don't look like you need any! Your skin is perfect :)<br>  <br>  2) Lemon juice - I don't really think it works on brown hair though? I'm not sure.<br>  <br>  3) Yes your so pretty! No you look great without make-up and your hair is really nice that colour. :)|`|ShatBd6Oaa	Use the juice of half a lemon in a cup of warm water as a rinse on your hair. It will perk up the lighter tones.<br>  <br>  For makeup, simply apply with a much lighter hand.  If you can see the makeup, its too much.  You should just look like you, only perfect.<br>  <br>  Too much eye makeup is distracting. You have pretty eyes as it is. Go subtle.|`|ie8sIDhJaa	sometimes go out place without make up on and you will gradually get used to being seen around people without as much make up on<br>  <br>  if you go on holiday or get out in the sun a lot, it will naturally make your hair lighter without the need for dye!<br>  <br>  but i dont think you need to change anything look fine anyway :)|`|lVIKtbMoaa	your name is kelly.. and yet you're wearing a sari?<br>  anyways. no i find you adorable but kind of young looking for a 14 year old.

Judging by your picture, you should go for the Selena Gomez look, she looks young, vibrant, and fresh! And with little makeup!<br>  <br>  Lastly, you should not change your hair color. I think dark look looks fantastic on you, and the only way to lighten your hair nautrally is to sit out in the sun (but that damages your hair) or to put lemon juice on it while in the sun (which may turn your hair orange since you have dark hair.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

Try using hairsprays used specially to keep your hair straight I had the same problem bought a really expensive good straightener and it didnt help at all.  Also as the weather starts to get warmer your hair will stay better.  You might try curling your hair I do that a lot and it looks really pretty.  a messy bun sounds like it would be really pretty on you.

Seriously, it works. I have naturally straight hair but due to hormone changes I guess it went big and curly around puberty until my late teens. I put a relaxer on it, and it did work.

Just make sure your hair is in good shape beforehand.|`|ThPYIKV7aa	yes, chii works amazing.<br>  buy it, thats probably why your hair isnt staying straight , because you dont use it.<br>  also try using a straightening shampoo and conditioner.<br>  allllsoo, hairspray your hair after your done with it.<br>  it'll keep the style in longer.

You can start by like, a VERY little blush or a skin toned liquid makeup. Every school day just add, little by little sumthing new. If you want to go with eyeliner, (bcuz i no that 1 was rely obvious wen i 1st wore it) you can put light, light brown and then keep puting the same amount 4 a few days then put a little more pressure to make it darker. Once you have the dark brown, you can start lightly(like the brown) with black. Wen they get used to the u with eyeliner, you can put on anything without interference.

You measure at the widest part of your bust and hips, but the SMALLEST part of your waist.  The area above the belly button- the smallest part of the torso.|`|xVs9KYcqaa	get a dressmakers tape measure (cloth one) and measure yourself. size 4 varies from maker to maker.

a4Tij3Xnaa	Why did you get red??? Unless you use something to tone it down you will look like any clown. I use my lipstick as blush, this way I get the right color for the lipstick I am wearing. Just dab a few dots lightly starting half way under your eye (meaning directly down from your color part of your eye) going out to the outer edge of the eye. Rub it lightly in a circular motion to the hairline, if you don't have enough add a little more until you get the color desired. If you like add a little glitter gel for an evening out on the town.Have fun and God Bless, Velle T

My mom pierced the ears of my sisters at home at about 2 years of age for each. She used a brand new, very fine, sharp needle, with fishing line, sterilized of course. The fishing line was monofiliment nylon and essentially inert in the body. AND since it is a single solid strand, not twisted or braided fibers like cotton thread, it can not absorb anything so the hole heals around the line without attaching TO the line. Something like cotton thread would grow INTO the wound and be very, very BAD and would later have to be ripped out causing extensive tissue damage. Be aware that needles come in two types, sharp point and ball point. Ball points are used in fabrics with fibers that can snag such as polyesters or other man-made fibers. The ball point does not snag fibers as a sharp needle can. If you try to use a ball point to pierce ears, it will rip the tissue instead of cutting a clean path through. All it takes is a steady hand, sterilized materials, wash the area and use an ice cube to deaden the earlobe. I watched my mom do both of my younger sisters ears. The ice cube to control pain WORKS. After a few days, my mom replaced the monofiliment line with regular studs suitable for a 2 year old. OK, so this is not piercing by yourself, as my mom did it to each of my sisters, but I think you can see that it is possible to do your own if you have the materials, a decent mirror and good lighting. You do not need a professional, but it would help if you had a friend instead of trying it yourself ON yourself.|`|T6PzMyPBaa	why don't you want it done professionally?<br>  at least they know what they're doing.<br>  you obviously have no clue if you're asking us so don't be stupid and get them done properly.

6BqA5NGhaa	Ok popularity isn't what makes you cool. It's your personality. Having confidence in yourself and being who you want to be will make a new school easier. Kissing up to them will not make them like you popular but being yourself with people that want to be your friends but I guess I need to answer your original question. Even though I really don't approve of it.<br>  <br>  Style:<br>  Make it fun and cute maybe a little flirty or anything comfortable that you like. Something that's not so tight you can't breath but something that little hugs your curves. Really it's just your own personal style. If you think it looks cute then wear it. Second opinions from friends don't hurt ether <br>  <br>  Hair:<br>  If you have curly hair-<br>  If it's short put little clips and barrettes <br>  If it's longer then keep it the way it is maybe wear a ponytail?<br>  <br>  If you have straight hair-<br>  If it's short remember it's not dull. maybe to a small French braid of your bangs <br>  If it's long then maybe curl the ends<br>  <br>  Boys:<br>  Boys are different for everyone depending on what you like<br>  -average and cute ones with a little bit of jock splashed into them.(me)<br>  -the hot football player<br>  -the little cute nerd<br>  <br>  How I got popular:<br>  I guess I just was in a lot of clubs, I was friendly, I was tried to have fun to not to be be popular it just kind of ended up that way.

Lots of volume goes a long way. Go through issues of Teen Vogue to find out the latest trends, the "it" girls at my school get all their outfits from their. Find vintage designer pieces that are timeless and a steal, but still look classic and gorgeous. You need impeccable confidence, you need to be a social butterfly and you need to get all the dirt about everyone in school. You need to host fabulous, fun sleepovers and suggest the coolest hangouts, with a large group of girls and guys. You need to always have plans, and have a Facebook and AIM, so everyone can talk to you. You should also have a cell phone, preferably a hip one like an iPhone or a blackberry. Have a signature scent such as "Daisy" by Marc Jacobs. Get involved with sports, but don't choose rough and tumble ones. Instead go for things like tennis and badminton. Try to get a manicure and a pedicure every two weeks, and apply a finishing coat every day to make your nails look shiny and clean. You should have a school bag that is a popular style, like the Longchamp bags which all the popular girls sport.<br>  Good luck, I hope I've helped :)|`|olMVfnljaa	I'm 13 and I've had experiences in my school... In the context of popularity you are talking about, they think they're cool with their 'boyfriends' and their 'make-up' and their 'designer clothing' and their personalities are all fake. You DON'T want to be like that.<br>  Be yourself and that way, people won't think you're a wanna-be saddo. 99% of the people trying to be 'popular' in your context, are all nasty and talk about people behind their backs, and from my experience, no one likes them in the end. Just because they know boys, have the in-style, do their hair a certain way, have lots of friends (or should I say acquaintances), etc etc ets, doesn't mean they're popular.<br>  I think you've got the whole meaning of 'popular' wrong. Popular means - When you stick by your friends and are loyal to them and trustworthy, that's why people like you (popularity) because you're a nice person. Not about what you wear, or confidence etc etc etc.|`|8v3kQdtmaa	well i think popular girls are just snobs,i wouldnt waste my time.<br>  when i was new at my school for some reason the popular girls liked me and wanted me to sit at lunch with them<br>  but i ended up going with other people haha<br>  i guess you need to be outgoing,have confidence,..<br>  popular girls at my school wear abercrombie,aeropostale,american eagle (u know thosee stores,,) EVERY dayy<br>  oh yeahh and for hair do they usually do that bump thing on top of their heads :P<br>  but seriously, just join the girls that seem your type.<br>  not the snobyy ones,.<br>  goodluck at your new school(:|`|3lF21cFkaa	ugh i hate when people try to be something their not!!!<br>  do you want people to like you for being fake? trust me being fake is a HUGE turn off to some people. if you really want to be liked be yourself so you dont always have to worry about being perfect every second. you'll regret this get a chance to get to know everybody find your true friends and stick with them. you dont wanna hang out with people you hate just to be labeld as popular. you will build up tones of anger and just end up being miserable. <br>  <br>  if you wanna change your style thats great but if your gonna change ur personality and who you are.. don't|`|jIccV2sOaa	Freakazo has it all sewn up.

For jewelry i would just wear a simple silver necklace and a simle regular ring.    I wouldn't go over the top with jewelry cause then i think it will make the dress look bad.  I think any type of hair would look good unless its over the top.   If you have brown hair i would try it curly but without the necklace.  If you have blond hair i would straiten it and then you can still wear the necklace.  if you are a red head i think you can wear it either way.  If you have a bob you can wear a necklace.<br>  <br>       I hope you have fun! =]

You should be tanned well before a month, yes. my sister went for three days in a row and was sun-kissed by the end of the thee days, so by a month you should be alright yes. my sister didnt wear goggles, just cos she didnt wanna get lines on her face, so Im sorry Im not much help with telling you what ones to wear to stop you getting lines. <br>  a really good cream to rub on afterwards is ANYTHING that has coconut milk in it - it really works, its not greasy so it wont have that annoying effect were your clothes seem to stick to you after putting the cream on :)<br>  <br>  good luck! hope you get the sun-kissed look you want!<br>  take care love :)<br>  x|`|A9MDoFooaa	if you knew what you are risking you simply would not even contemplate using a sun bed. please google images of skin cancer - and make an informed choice. <br>  <br>  why not use the cash to get a St Tropez fake tan - it looks fab and healthy - or why not use a sunless tanner in a moisturiser - there are loads on the market now - the colour will build up over time and so looks natural and is safe and easy to maintain.<br>  <br>  if you insist on using a sun bed - you will have to start very slowly if you have pale skin - and you'll need special goggles to protect your eyes- without them you are risking even more damage to your body - think carefully - be mature and think long term.|`|8t96n7Vfaa	Since it is your first time you should maybe go for about 5-6 minutes, but the ladies working there will help you decide on that. They have great lotions at the store which can be pricey but worth it. If you want to get tan fast then get a bronzer lotion when your there and you put that on right before you tan. Get the goggles that don't have strings on the side, they just balance on your face. Once you get your base tan consider mystic tan because it is better for you.

It can become a little overwhelming to take this task on by yourself, so we have gone through all of the legwork for you and have provided the best hair lost treatments for you to consider.<br>   <br>   One of the best hair loss treatments and surely one of the most popular is Rogaine.? It comes in two different minoxidil solution levels, 2% and 5%, and the 5% regularly gets better reviews across the board.? If you think you have to wait until you start losing your hair to use this product, you are quite wrong.? If you suffer from hereditary hair loss, you will be able to make good use of this product as those that use it as prescribed report back that at the very least, their hair loss stops.?

The Provillus two-part system contains just what you need to help re-grow your hair. Since men and women have different needs, we’ve created a special formula for men, and a uniquely different formula for women. Both contain the FDA-approved ingredient, Minoxidil. Minoxodil is the hairloss ingredient approved by the FDA for use by men and women.<br>   <br>   Something that is very similar to Rogaine, but is in a pill is Propecia.? This has an active ingredient called Finasteride that serves much the same effect as Minoxidil.? The fact that it can be taken in a pill form is one of the reasons that it is catching up to Rogaine in its popularity.? Taking Propecia will have very similar results as Rogaine and you can use it for the same reasons that you would Rogaine.? If your family history dictates hair loss, you may want to consider taking this as a preventative measure and if you are already suffering from hair loss, you can use it to put that to a halt.? Propecia is definitely one of the best hair loss treatments on the market.<br>   <br>   Closing out our list is a method that has come quite a way over the last few years.? Hair replacement surgery is no longer the joke that it once was.? In fact, methods like mirco-grafting have taken hair loss surgery to the next level.? Those that undergo this surgery are usually in and out in one day and experience little if any discomfort or pain.? One the scalp has healed, usually about a week,? and the hair begins to grow, you may find it quite difficult to notice that these individuals have had a procedure done at all.? With the advancements that have been make, this has to be considered one of the best hair loss treatments you can undergo.|`|1b0ta9Swaa	Eat healthy!

They have zinc, which is both calming and an anti-bacterial   If she applies a good barrier cream then the powder, it will stay put and look smoother, without causing flare ups.<br>  <br>  The moisturizer I prefer is Cetaphil lotion combined with Desitin Zinc cream 35% zinc.<br>  <br>  I put about 60 mls of Cetaphil to 1 tbsp of Desitin and blend the two well.

fqIE566Caa	what product are you using? <br>  quit using anything and your skin should sort itself out, if not go and see a dermatologist who should be able to help with the redness as well as your other skin concerns.
DTGZJ8T6aa	start with a good moisterizer, clinique makes really really good face hydrators (it's worth the money, all my friends swear by it).<br>  <br>  after that, you should use a make up primer, those will make the makeup stay and not get all flakey.<br>  <br>  i have the same flakey problem, and I looked around everywhere for a concealer that wouldn't leave flakes. I've found that L'oreal's true-match superblendable concealer works best.

0pJAXEXCaa	SCENE KID ESSENTIALS:<br>  <br>  -Skinny jeans.  Seriously, seriously skinny.  And in lots of bright colors.  Try Pacsun.<br>  -Scene hair bows.  These are not actually easy to find, but they are just these cute bows that go in your hair.  If you wore some when you were a little kid, rescue them.  If not, your best bet might be Hot Topic.<br>  -Band/graphic tees.  Anything that looks neon-ish, bright, crazy, kinda 80's...also you want these to be pretty fit-dart.<br>  -Plain tank tops in black and white. <br>  -Boy shorts that are really short.<br>  -Rad hair dye!  And the 'scene' haircut.  In reality, all scene kids have the same hairstyle.  Try youtube or scene-styles.blogspot.com to see these.  But basically, scene hair is two layers, usually with a base color of black or platinum, with neon colors or stripes going through, and then you tease up the top layer.  Youtube has tutorials on how to do this.<br>  -It's actually okay to wear some clothes from A&F or Hollister or whatever.  Due to the fact that scene kids wear tight clothing.<br>  -Neon tube tops.  These are actually sort of ugly, but I have seen pics of scene girls wearing them.<br>  -Scene makeup.  That's basically just alot of eyeliner, black or bright shadow, and mascara.  Try Physician's Formula Organic Wear for this really nice eyeliner and mascara!  Both products are 100% natural.  I also use their eyeshadow, but it's grey, not black.  <br>  -You might want to get short skirts with cute ruffles all over them.  There's a cute one on Hottopic.com by Super Low Fat.  (I bought it in black).<br>  -Studded belts.<br>  -Converse.<br>  -Skater sneakers - take a look at Journey's.<br>  -Sweet sunglasses!  Like the kind celebs wear, those big oversized ones, or leopard/zebra ones, or neon Ray-Bans, or heart-shaped glasses.<br>  -Gangstaliscious skater-ish hoodies.  Neon is best!  Or they can support bands.  Try Wet Seal, Hot Topic, etc.<br>  -Little tiaras.  I think these are stupid.  Like, it would look retarded to wear a plastic crown on your head to school.<br>  -Kitsch jewelery in the shape of brass knuckles, diamonds, mix tapes, etc.  It should be made out of neon plastic.  Try etsy.com for this (search cbtscloset) and also Red Plastic Factory UK. <br>  -Trucker hats. <br>  -Your clothes have to be tights and kind of slutty.  Scene girls as a whole are kind of slutty.

e1434520b7d6b7db2b483084c9ad434aaa	Just wear it naturally! :)<br>  <br>  Here are some basic tips for curly hair that you might find helpful:<br>  *Try to find a stylist who knows how to work with curly hair. A great tool for finding curly stylists in your area: <a href="http://www.naturallycurly.com/curlsalons" rel="nofollow">http://www.naturallycurly.com/curlsalons</a><br>  *Don't shampoo every day.<br>  *Comb conditioner through hair in the shower.<br>  *Apply styling products to dripping wet hair. Scrunch or twirl hair to achieve desired shape.<br>  *Use styling products suited for your hair type. Don’t know yours? <a href="http://www.naturallycurly.com/hair-types" rel="nofollow">http://www.naturallycurly.com/hair-types</a><br>  *Avoid terrycloth towels on hair; use linen, paper towels, or t-shirts instead.<br>  *Air dry or use a diffuser with your blowdryer.<br>  *Don't touch (or brush!) your hair while it’s drying.<br>  *Once completely dry scrunch out any crunchy texture.<br>  <br>  For hair type specific products check out these forums:<br>  <a href="http://www.naturallycurly.com/curltalk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.naturallycurly.com/curltalk/</a><br>  There you can find others with the same hair type and try out some of their favorite products. I would recommend something, but I don’t know your hair type. :)<br>  <br>  Lastly, it has made my hair so much better since I started the curly girl method! I used to almost never wear it down (it was a frizz/poof ball), but now I have pretty, shiny curls. ~:) It’s pretty radical—no sulfates (shampoo) or silicones—but it’s so great for curly hair.

ykP7I3caaa	Actually, the best way to grow your hair comes from the inside out.<br>  Try taking a hair skin and nails vitamin.

Good Luck and God Bless You && your loved ones(:|`|TfJn3KJvaa	Hair typically grows 1/3 of an inch every month no matter what but if you take good care of your hair you can grow up to an inch a month.<br>  <br>  I suggest taking hair, skin, and nail vitamins, available at any drug store or wal-mart. Things to look for are vitamin B complex, vitamin E, and biotin (vitamin b7). Eat healthy and get plenty of protein and dark green vegetables. Hair is mainly composed of protein. Eggs contain a ton of protein. Also foods containing "gelatin" are good for your hair such as yogurt and jello. Google "hair growth foods" for ideas. Also try daily scalp massages using your fingertips to stimulate hair growth, it gets blood flowing in your scalp and feels great. Avoid frying your hair at all costs. Get plenty of sleep and excercise, especially cardiovascular excercises like running. Avoid caffeine, nicotine, and stress. <br>  <br>  A good conditioner is also important. Sunsilk is amazing and cheap, the kind I am currently using contains jojoba oil wich is AMAZING. Any sunsilk product is amazing and cheap.<br>  <br>  If you have fried hair, do not dye it anymore and try hot oil treatments, and do not use shampoo every day. I leave contitioner in for about 5 minutes before washing it out to keep mine looking healthy. If you have split ends get them trimmed to avoid it getting worse.|`|ycAB7Q3raa	this is literally the eternal quest!<br>  <br>  take good care of your hair, take vitamins, and massage your scalp<br>  <br>  thats all you can do (and wait) im afraid :)

71204fadefeb0aef75f4761be2bfbc09aa	Hey!<br>  I did a study on height so I have loads of clothes tips for petite people:<br>  If you want to look less petite then you need to wear fitted clothes- avoid stuff that is really baggy or poofy. If you want to wear a dress then empire line would be good because it makes your small bust look good and the style will make your body look longer. If you want to wear separates then a longer top will make your body look longer in proportion to your legs.<br>  Petite people should avoid clothes with big patterns, because it makes them look smaller. Also, avoid things with big pockets (some jeans). Black and white is a good colour scheme- but don't wear anything with stripes across your body- it makes you look shorter.<br>  If you wear shoes that give you a bit of height that makes a big difference, but they don't have to be impractical heels- maybe wedges?<br>  I have loads more tips on how to look less petite, so if you want to talk more just contact me through my profile.<br>  Simon<br>  ;-)|`|zod8Ehd9aa	omg dont be fake pick out something from ur closet that u would be confortable in like a dress or a skirt and and blouse or watever u girls wear were u live|`|pOsV0Tu2aa	For a bat mitzvah you need to dress modestly.<br>  Wear a dress that covers your knees and shoulders.<br>  If it doesn't cover your shoulders just wear a cardigan and you can take it off for the after party.<br>  I hope you have fun.<br>  :)|`|vM734bc2aa	<a href="HTTP://WWW.STYLISHDUDES.COM" rel="nofollow">HTTP://WWW.STYLISHDUDES.COM</a><br>  We are wholesaler of Nike Jordan and Other Shoes in China.

But the Yahoo Answers Blog discusses this issue.  I think what you should do either wait for them to grow back or go back to your hairstylist and have him or her fix your bangs. It's important to let the hairstylist know that they screwed up.  It's possible you can get a slight refund or get your bangs fixed.  Waiting for them to grow back would leave you with crooked bangs for some time.  I had a similar experience(even though I am a guy) with a really bad haircut. I let it grow back but it was a terrible two weeks. The haircut was so bad I had to blog about it.

IJstP8wAaa	I'm that exact size in American Eagle and Aero! So, I usually buy 3 long. So I can kind of grow into them. Also, if they are big, you can return them and get a 0! GOOD LUCK! I love Pacun jean!!|`|sJHujXJyaa	tyr a range from 0- 4 long and if they dont work just keep the recipt and u can exchange them for the rite size|`|lTxeGDfgaa	If you are zero at other stores you will probably be a zero here to.<br>  00 would be quite tight on you and I don't know if it would fit.<br>  I would stick with 0.
sJHujXJyaa	prolli american eagle|`|flumWcKEaa	if you have an american eagle near by they sell them<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ae.com/web/browse/product.jsp?catId=cat90120&productId=0439_7527" rel="nofollow">http://www.ae.com/web/browse/product.jsp...</a>
3Z4YFz29aa	match your hair color to your eye color and get bangs to bring out your big brown eyes!|`|0k4HNPhWaa	keep your hair dark brown go up or down a couple of shades if you like get a cute layerd haircut and paint your nails  whatever color you like cuz I dont have a clue    " hope you find a hair color you like."|`|mgeuli7Naa	I would keep some sort of dark hair. Black always looks nice on olive tones. Black nail polish also seems like it looks good with the skin tone as well. It doesn't seem gothic when it is on trust me. If you wear clothes that aren't black, it definitely doesn't look like it.
bXF1gDTcaa	they usually pierce with an 18? if you go somewhere like a shop rather than like claires and use a needle they can do larger. i got my industrial done at a 14.|`|oJrPLOw4aa	Whoooo.. Freeze..<br>  <br>  You first have to have your ear pierced to gauge. Then you start stretching the hole. Dont go to fast you will rip it and trust me it HURTS. <br>  <br>  Below is what you should do and how. Its all about gauging|`|T6PzMyPBaa	don't get your ear gunned.<br>  get it pierced with a needle at a professional piercing place.<br>  don't go to some stupid claires shop or a mall shop because they have no clue what they're doing<br>  and the term is "stretch your ears"<br>  not gauge.<br>  you can get your ear pierced at sizes up to 5mm but it means there's less chance of it shrinking back down and your lobe is alot thinner.<br>  get your ear pierced at about 1.6mm to speed things up.<br>  let it heal for 6 months before stretching then start with a 2.4mm taper.<br>  and go up one size every month or so or maybe longer depending on your body.<br>  but you should google it or read experiences of it because everyone has different techniques for it|`|aprgVgxMaa	Honestly, if youre going to do it don't get a huge one, start out small and work your way up. my friend ended on an 8. he finally decided he wanted to take it out, and he still has a hole in his ear after a few months, so i would do it small if youre going to do it.
ZqOgOSJkaa	Creepy-chan is the nickname given to her by 4chan's /b/. She posted a lot of creepy pictures of herself (as well as just looking creepy in general), and that's what we called her. The "chan" suffix is given to all well-known cam girls on 4chan. That's pretty much how you know that she got it from there.<br>  <br>  Of all the chan's, she stood out a lot, having very distinct facial features. Also, none of her images were pornographic. If you want a quick re-cap of some of her collection of 4chan photos, there's a little slide show at <a href="http://creepy-tan.ytmnd.com/." rel="nofollow">http://creepy-tan.ytmnd.com/.</a> You can also probably find a collection of her on RapidShare, though I cba to provide a link.<br>  <br>  By the way, it's *season* 12, not episode 12. :3|`|lTxeGDfgaa	Maybe the way her eyes are so big and she seems "alien-esque."  <br>  I really like her though!|`|le6hDyURaa	google creepy chan. her myspace also has a bunch of her creepy chan pictures on it.|`|7fZIwaKfaa	Prior to being on ANTM, she was well-known on 4chan for taking creepy, artsy photos of herself.  The website gave her that nickname.
txGRbdLSaa	Yes I would.  It doesn't matter whether it's a salon or a mobile hairdresser, they are still providing a product/service for payment and if you're not satisfied you have equal cause and rights to complain.|`|Z3DsL9Bqaa	im not sure that i would complain because i can be quite shy about things like that but i certainly wouldnt be inviting her back to cut it again :-)|`|mgeuli7Naa	I would because it doesn't really matter unless you are close friends with this person.|`|PQBEqS8Caa	Ofcourse I would complain to her and tell her that I do NOT require her services anymore.
WMyrAYL2aa	yes its perfectly safe! &&you really see results in just 3 days, but it may dry your skin a little.|`|rKaUdhLUaa	It is very drying. You really should see a dermatologist they can give you stuff that works without over drying and you won't have to spend years trying different products to find something that works.|`|a1sGuEeaaa	it is safe but it left my skin dried and when i stopped using it my skin started to get blotchy|`|Talt1MDqaa	totally!!!<br>  but it does dry your skin out<br>  just like most other acne products.|`|Hj6SFfK7aa	It's safe, but it is drying and it won't work for everyone.|`|OuOOy8v3aa	Yes, other wise they wouldn't be selling it.

But if you have long hair make sure that the curls are very tight. That is girls used to wear their hair... very very tight curls. :)
h3HjLZ4daa	Well of course you can buy it as you know - which the post above mine tells you then how to mold, but if you want to make your own from scratch I suggest this book: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Making-Transparent-Soap-Crafting-Scenting/dp/158017244X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1236556183&sr=8-1" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Making-Transparent...</a><br>  <br>  It's not a simple thing and I strongly suggest you get to know about soapmaking in general before you head off in the direction of making glycerin soap which is more complex.<br>  <br>  And go online - I think some of our soaping forums (esp soapdishforum.com/) may have some threads on it.<br>  <br>  But here are some directions.  Before you do it though I caution you that soapmaking involves lye and is not something you try without learning about it first.  <a href="http://crafty.dyskolus.com/cosmetics/clear1__cosmetics.html" rel="nofollow">http://crafty.dyskolus.com/cosmetics/cle...</a>  <br>  <br>  NOTE:  THIS RECIPE ABOVE REQUIRES YOU TO CALCULATE HOW MUCH LYE YOU NEED.

d5065693519b5b048f87de49a76bf961aa	Do some web searches "Skin care products, moisturizer creams harmful" and you will see countless ones are skin harming and skin aging. Some have`been pulled from market because of acne and cancer causing scares.<br>  It is far safer and much less costly to use essential oils which are perfect moisturizers and only beneficial to skin.<br>  Olive, almond, jojoba, are all excellent for moisturizing. Many oils are best diluted 50/50 with a thinner, milder essential oil like grape seed. They feed skin essential nutrients and will quickly give you a healthy, glowing, revitalized skin. Also greatly combats aging and will help prevent or diminish lines and wrinkles. You do not remove - most gets absorbed into skin -  simply remove excess by splashing  face with water and dab dry with tissues. <br>  See my many other answers giving more detailed information  - some with feedback from users who have also had equally great results. Shop around for best prices. Can be bought at Whole Foods, GNC ,Trader Joe's, some Walmart Stores, Cost Plus, Wegmans, Earth Fare, some natural & health foods stores. Olive and grape seed oil can be bought in bigger supermarkets<br>  <br>  SOURCE(S): 20+ years research/experimentation using safe, natural treatments to permanently cure skin conditions and safe anti aging, rejuvenation treatments

HpfZUWXUaa	agh razor burn! been there, done that. it sucks doesn't it? i know you may have wanted to be fast, but honestly you can't rush shaving. you have to set aside the time it takes to do it properly, especially if you have sensitive skin. right now, there's not much you can do. you can try rubbing them with ice [it'll reduce the swelling, calm the redness, and make it less itchy]. try some baby oil too, to sooth your skin. otherwise, there's not much to do except wait. let the hair grow out [I know, I know, it's killer! but at least it's winter and you wont be wearing shorts that much]. it's gonna take a while, but the rash will go away. you just CAN"T SHAVE! that'll only make it worse. once it's gone, you can safely get rid of the hair again. make sure you take your time. and invest in a good razor. four or five blades are best, and make sure it's specifically made for women. i know this may sound weird, but for me baby oil actually works a lot better then shaving cream. it mousterizes reallyyyyy well, gives a much closer shave and is great for sensitive skin. try it out! douse your legs in baby oil and slowlyyyy pull the razor up your leg. don't don't don't rush, unless you wanna haveta go through the entire process again lol. i know it's not fun :/ just be patient! good luck :]|`|71wF3u8qaa	ive done that before, it takes 4-5 hours for the pain to go away completely. try soaking your legs in ice water for 5 minutes or so, and then cover them in lotion! i feel for you, shaving dry kills!!!|`|QGZBlceuaa	They're razor bumps which happens when you "dry shave". They'll go down eventually and you won't even notice that it happened.<br>  <br>  It happens to me all the time... just use some gentle, non-scented lotion on them for right now.<br>  <br>  Next time, shave your with shaving cream, or soap, or shampoo if you're desperate to get a clean shave. :)

MDpydGPeaa	Hi again,<br>  <br>  I sent you a couple of emails, did you receive them?<br>  <br>  Onto this corset, looks pretty good. I would not say that it is a real corset (although they claim it is, but they all do) but it looks reasonably well constructed, the boning is well placed and there is enough to give you the required support, it is lined, has waist tape and nice closely spaced eyelets (with boning around them).<br>  <br>  Without actually seeing it, it is difficult to tell, but I would say that the differences between it and a proper corset is that the boning will be plastic, the fabric lighter and the stitching is probably inferior (not saying it is bad) as it is probably mass produced in china or similar. But it is a quarter of the price of a real corset!<br>  <br>  I think that it is probably the best you are going to get in your price range and I think that it will do what you want. But have a look at the companies website before deciding as there is much more variety there. The site is <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.corsetsboulevard.co.uk/viewstore2.aspx?page=home" rel="nofollow">http://www.corsetsboulevard.co.uk/viewst...</a><br>  <br>  If you do get it, be careful when first trying it on. It needs to be worn in. To do this, initially tighten the corset so that it is firm not tight. Wear for a couple of hours and then tighten a little more. Keep repeating this process over 2 or three days until the desired snugness is achieved. This allows the stitching in the corset to take the pressure evenly, protecting your purchase, and also allowing the corset and boning (steel is much better than plastic for this) to mould to your body giving a great overall comfortable snug fit. Remember that the corset needs to be pleasurably snug with the pressure evenly taken over the body. It should feel like a tight embrace or firm hug, there should be no tight spots. If there is a tight spot then the corset is too tight or the wrong style and you need to loosen the laces. Never let anyone else try it on as it will then start to alter to their shape.<br>  <br>  One thing I would do immediately is change the way it is laced. Have a look at this for the best way.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.romantasy.com/index.html?BodyURL=ZXQ/cyboutique/corset/how_to_lace.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.romantasy.com/index.html?Body...</a><br>  <br>  Word of warning with the boning, if plastic; Always store flat and be careful not to bend or place the corset in any position where the boning may get bent, even a little; if it does get bent then there is little you can do to fix it (unlike with steel boning).<br>  <br>  If you are happy with it go for it, remember to buy 4 inches smaller than your natural waist size. But don't over tighten it (everyone does on there first corset). ;)<br>  <br>  Email me if you have any further questions and welcome to some wonderful curves, straight back and a fantastic silhouette. If you do get a corset let me know and I will let you know the best way to tighten the laces on your own.|`|IwXy8KLVaa	Heyya :-) it looks like a real corset to me but what does it madder if you really like the corset then buy it and wear it. :-) it doesn't madder what other people"s opinioin of this is it madders what your opinion is! i hope this helps ;-)|`|2Yijblbaaa	looks real to me!|`|qYTYcVGGaa	looks fake O.O fabric looks too soft
VEhj9pleaa	I thought I wouldn't look very good in them either. I tried it and I didn't really like how the hairdresser cut them. So I just always pinned them back. I went to another hairdresser and I really liked the cut. If you bring in a pic. It will help the hairdresser a lot. Most people look really good in them. It is always good to try new things. Also if you wanted a little longer bangs or shorter bangs like right above you eye or higher. Your choice.<br>  <br>  <3 :) Cece|`|jez0O0bXaa	Everyone is different and they have different ideas of what looks good, so it's personal preference.

HzCBOwlyaa	i have a couple of tips ....i donno if it will help or it will make you laugh:)<br>  1.  baby powder... wipe alittle around your outter thigh and your bum bum..it should help slip them up a tad...DONT tug the belt loops may rip if they are that tight.<br>  2. when you get them on lay down on the bed and suck in baby lol zip up and button ! <br>  3. bend alot in them but if they are that tight becarefull not to bust the zipper or the reend of your pants <br>  4. lol drink lots of water to flush out your body before you plan on wearing them ...it will help shed a couple of ounces to get you into them tight jeans.<br>  5. return them if none of these steps work and get a size bigger lol sorry! hope it helpped|`|AA11387133	Just wear 'em a lot. Most jeans will stretch out fine after a while. Wear them around the house if you're not sure about going out in them, and do some house chores to help stretch them out.
RyE0Ki6Gaa	I think it'll look fine.<br>  It depends on the shoes as well, though.<br>  Anyway, if you're confident then people won't notice<br>  but if you make it obvious that you're self concious about it, then people will notice.|`|aHER8myJaa	yep they look good to me the skirt could be shorter though =P|`|h00bqU7baa	Yeah you look fine.

UYnZtJ2daa	Not until it is completely healed so about 2-4 weeks. I'd make sure to give it three weeks at least. When you sit in a bath, you're sitting in water filled with...well..the stuff that you're washing off of your body. Not only that but shampoo, soap, etc. It's SO bad for tattoos. And when you go swimming there are all kinds of chemicals (salt in the ocean, chlorine and more in pools) that you're just asking for it to get irritated.<br>  <br>  If you want your tattoo to heal as beautifully as possible, wait at least 3 weeks.|`|0lWB2SUwaa	one month|`|YiY9Yd2Jaa	At least until you get out of the shop. <br>  <br>  Most people I know who have tattoos will swim or surf the same day. It has never seemed to affect any of them. I think that infection is more likely from not keeping dirt off the area, not by what is effectively washing it.|`|SONLm2Ilaa	Until its healed, tattoos take about 1 to 3 weeks to heal!
qHcEBN2Zaa	OK...why on earth would you want to look older?<br>  here are some ideas that are neutral and don't make you look overdone:<br>  1. When doing eyeliner, if you want it heavy, a good idea is putting it on the top to bring your lashes out more without the use of mascara. of you want to do both, just use a little smudge on the insie of the bottom of your eye...or outside but that's a little more difficult. Do it a little on your lashline on your lid too. If you want to use mascara, only use a small amount. It's a good idea to put a little mascara on an old dried out mascara brush so that it gives you a more natural look.<br>  <br>  2. the smokey eye is when you use eyeliner on your top lid and bottom fairly darkly. then you use a little dark brown close to the eyeliner on the lid. Then add some mascara. A little more brown on the rest of the lid and you're done. But don't do this if you have bright eyes. It might be too harsh. Try a light bright eye. Just use a little dark brown eyeliner on your lids. Use a warm brown eyeshadow with a little glitter and a little mascara and you're ready to go.<br>  <br>  3. Knowing how to do your blush is very important. If you want it along your jawline, you will want a shade or two darker than your natural skin color to make it look right. If you want it on the apples of your cheeks then you may want something a little pinkish...but not too pink! and only use a little. It would look too barbie if you use alot of pink.<br>  <br>  4. eyeshadows...wow. If you're going for a halloween party or something, go ahead and wear blues and greens. Otherwise...dont use colors like that. Browns, light pinks, peaches and light oranges are as far as it should go. Black is ok but only close to your lashline...unless you want gothic. If you really truly want some other color there, use a brown or peach shadowm and a smudge of blue or green close to the lash line or on your upper lid at the end of the brown or peach.<br>  <br>  5. lipgloss: choose neutral colors that aren't harsh on your skin tone. if a bright red is too harsh, orangey red is good. or maybe scarlet if you have dark skin. if you have really light skin, peaches, light pinks, light browns and sometimes light oranges are good and neutral. For tanish skin, hot pink, some reds or browns, oranges and dark peaches work.<br>  For dark skin, NOTHING LIGHT! Dark purples, browns, scarlet or any color similar goes best. bright colors, big no no!<br>  Another tip, clear glosses or ones that only have a hint of pink, purple, brown or red (as long as its transparent) are good for any skin tone. they are better than any shimmery solid color. Go more glossy than shimmery.<br>  <br>  I could go on but I wont...these are he msot important.<br>  <br>  hope this helps!|`|7XK7EaIuaa	Yes you should. <br>  Check out youtube.com on how to put on make-up. They have great videos and show you set by set how to do select colors and styles. The smokey eye is a popular look many girls show how to do on there. <br>  <br>  Good Luck :)
EL45UeUJaa	Take black eyeliner and put it on the upper inner waterline to define your eye. Then put it on the lower inner waterline halfway or 3/4th's of the way across. Then put it on the top eyelid by starting to draw a thin line (use the kind that twists up) and then slowly add a little more and you can even wing it out a little. You can make it thicker and if you want to you can smudge. Or instad of smudging it you can add a charcoal eye shadow and put it right above the eyeliner line that you drew, and dont go any further than your eye crease. You can also make the line in the eyecrease a little darker to define it.|`|m7Y10ojiaa	Go on YouTube and search Purse Buzz or makeup tutorials.. you'll find loads of tricks to make your makeup look amazing!|`|RmIeoU7raa	Eye make up when applied correctly will make you look much older and sexy.  Along with putting eyeliner on the top lid put it HALF way lightly along the bottom lid.  Also put it all the way across the water line (the part of your eye that's right above your lower lashes.)<br>  <br>  The smokey eye is kind of hard to learn how to do.  I recently found this video on youtube that helped me learn how to do it.  Check out this girls other videos to help you learn how to more with your eyes.<br>  <br>  I hope I helped =)|`|rqYy0RJVaa	Well go into Waterstones and check out teh Bobbi Brown make up book, celebreating her 25 years of being  amake up artsit.

Great way to learn...|`|pPBcGrRgaa	well i think that the top lid is good enough, the bottom one will make your eyes too punky and i think that you wouldnt lok natural pretty. If you only put it at the top lid it will look that its natural and you will look prettier , also try medium red or soft pink lipstick, some blush will be nice too, but remmeber dont over do it , make it look as natural as possible, when you put too much it makes you look like a kid thats trying to  look older and that isnt good|`|Zx23ZXgGaa	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BH-bbLnvXb4" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BH-bbLnvX...</a>
UYnZtJ2daa	Unless you want that extending onto your neck, it's not going to fit behind your ear. If you do a really small font, you risk it looking smushed and just...not good. <br>  <br>  And all places charge differently. Go talk to a tattoo artist in your area.|`|0lWB2SUwaa	It varies<br>  <br>  the place i went charged $180 and it took an hour <br>  <br>  my guess is yours would cost $60 to $100|`|M7tszm4laa	Most tattoo places have a set rate (maybe $50). Set rate for color is a little bit more (like $80). And then they also have a set rate for custom work (usually around $100)...and then they charge by hour after that.<br>  <br>  Depending on the size of what you want behind your ear, and if you got it in black ink...it would probably be slightly more than your tattoo shop's set rate.|`|OYITN4S2aa	Wow, you must be really pushing for this tattoo. Anyway the price varies. Don't go somewhere too cheap and don't go somewhere too expensive look around at different places first and then make a final decision on where you want to go.

WEAR BLACK!!! lol im srry, but i was just freaking out wen u said brown :P<br>  <3|`|LstIUR8aaa	You should wear brown eye shadow. Use light brown bronzer for a glowed look. You should also use a little black mascara and brownish blashish eyeliner.|`|K8qXXubdaa	perhaps some subtle brown eyeshadow to tie in with the yellow and possible brown shoes?
9ko5WUFkaa	That's super classy....<br>  <br>  Actually, it's just trashy.  If you got jeans that fit properly they wouldn't ride up or dig in to anything.  And even long shirts can ride up when you sit down - it's not a good look when half your butt is hanging out.<br>  <br>  Just buy a good fitting pair of jeans and stop making excuses for looking cheap and trashy.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  So you're saying that your mum is happy with you getting around with your crack showing rather than spending $30 on a new pair of jeans?  Yeah, right!  And you are how old?  Are you 13 like your name says?  Cause if your 13 you're the only person of that age I've ever heard of that doesn't out-grow their clothes in 2-3 years.  I'd be really suprised if you could even get them done up within a year.  Just explain to her that you'd rather not look trashy and I'm sure she'd get you a new pair.<br>  <br>  No matter what excuse you make, you still choose to wear the jeans.  Either pull them up and stop looking trashy or wear something else.  Having your butt hanging out of your jeans is not normal, and at 14 you're just asking for trouble.  The choice is yours...|`|cTvP6j7Haa	And you are 13?*  They say: "Tt pays to advertise."  but do you want to be picked up so early?

iKV9ZaWvaa	my routine using sff (studio fix fluid), moisturize, prep and prime, wait 10mins to sink in, pea sized amount rubbed in using 187 or fingers starting undereyes. set with large powder brush 136 and rimmel loose powder and then a sweep of blush using same brush|`|WlwiyRVKaa	i think you have the order wrong :)<br>  <br>  when applying any makeup, you always stick liquids with liquids, powder with powder. if i were you, i would apply their prep and prime on first. then use the 186 brush to buff on the studio fix foundation.<br>  <br>  then instead of using their mineral powder, use their creme blush first.<br>  <br>  the way you are applying it causes caking and uneven texture. putting on a liquid and then a cream allows the blush to go on with more ease :)<br>  <br>  i hope i helped!|`|v6hvLQOjaa	Not really sure what I would recommend to you. Its difficult to pick so what I end up doing is starting with the less expensive and trying out a few different ones.This is a good review website at <a href="http://www.brandsmakeup.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.brandsmakeup.com</a> visit and read the reviews.|`|UOzSNEO8aa	Make sure you use the moisturizer first, because if your skin is dry,your makeup will look flaky.  A lot of times it just takes practice because the consultant went to school for makeup application, you did not.  Make sure your foundation is even and that you aren't using too much of any of those products.  Personally, I do not use powder because my skin on my face is close to flawless, so a little bit of foundation kind of takes care of it.  I then use a little bit of bronzing blush on my cheekbones.  If your skin is pretty clear, you're wasting money using a lot of makeup, and especially MAC is expensive.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!

A9MDoFooaa	foundation is to give your skin an even tone and balance and a foundation literally, for the rest of your make-up - its not a concealer, which is why this repeatedly happens to you.<br>  <br>  first you need to rehydrate your skin with a good daily routine and drinking plenty of water and then maybe try using a good quality moisturiser with a sunless tanner in - before you begin to use foundation again.<br>  <br>  once your skin is sorted - your foundation is, as i said just to balance out the tone, and maybe try a mineral powder rather than a liquid - the liquid will just block up your skin and a mousse will dry it out very quickly - with a powder you can build up the foundation and it will look at lot more natural and glowing. <br>  <br>  if your going out and want to cover up the dry red spots - use a concealer after a really good moisturiser - a colour wheel one - use green on the red and blot it then use a small amount, just on the tip of your finger of the skin toned concealer over the green before applying your foundation. the green will not show through your foundation.<br>  <br>  hth a bit|`|gab4fOrUaa	the best thing would be to cleanse tone and moisturize ur face every night until your cheeks start to get better, after that i would suggest using dream matt mouse foundation as u can get ur exact colour as they have many to choose from and it looks very natural, the reason it goes patchy is after a while your sweating wipes some off and ur mores take some in so u just need to reapply later on in the day :) x|`|CXxdpkTIaa	Make sure your skin is well moisturised, add Clarins 'beauty flash balm' long lasting hydration) immediately apply moisturising foundation bobbi brown has good stuff.<br>  <br>  I sometimes have dry skin, beauty flash balm works a charm, if you've properly exfoliated and moisturised before.|`|eiJOdPgxaa	Concentrate on your skin for  a few weeks first - and just use a tinted moisturiser. Drink loads of water, look to your diet and cleansing routine.  Once your skin looks better, go to a good department store and get samples of foundation from all the big cosmetic houses and try them out.|`|QAEQqgzyaa	The reason it probably looks patchy and dirty is your not applying it right (this can also be bad foundation) but if it happens with most foundation you try its probably the way you are applying it, everyone does it their own way, some people like to use their fingers, some people like to use a foundation brush and some people like to use make up sponges so its just finding what you are most comfortable with and trying different ways. I find that applying a little foundation and blending it in one at a time, so for example put a little onto your nose and work it in and then onto your forehead and work it in that way it wont smudge or dry or be patchy as its been blended straight away. Also if you use a sponge, making it abit damp before using it can make it blend easier. As for your skin you need to buy an exfoliater and make sure you moisturise and avoid wearing make up when you can. I recommend maybelline liquid mineral foundation, and for high coverage I recommend revlon colorstay which I actually use as a concealer as its very high coverage :-) good luck and just play around with a few things until you find what works for you x|`|XUN0OUIJaa	Im having the exact same problem!

I think she looked amazing in really short hair. My advise is to accept it and give it some time. Most girls end up liking the short hair better.

It is sore and silvery and is caused from an overproduction of skins cells. We normally shed many skin sells but an our immune system cam be compromised and we can end up with all kinds of skin problems. My doctor gave me Luxiq but it just dried it out more, burned and made it sorer. It sounds like psoriasis ans there is medication for it but I can't take it due to low blood calcium. To be certain, see a dermatologist. I know these things can be devastating and embarrassing. Good luck.

IW3jmnKbaa	Depends on how you look at it, "mineral powder" is pretty vague. Gun powder, is a mineral powder, made up of sulfur, carbon, and saltpeter.<br>  Graphite is a mineral powder, so is plaster of paris, and both are "natural".If, by "natural", you mean, "occurring naturally", or "non-plastic", consider this, everything we have here on Earth, is "natural", meaning it came from nature, can you name one thing that doesn't come from nature? How about a meteor? they're "natural" too.<br>  Uranium 235, natural. Boxite, borax, beryllium, natural. Anthrax, arsenic,<br>  Americonium, natural. Everything is natural to a point, everything comes from Earth, everything is made up of a limited amount of atoms, and depending on how they're arranged, is what determines if you want to put them on your face, or clean stubborn stains from your toilet bowl. Next time your in Wally- mart, go down the paint aisle, grab a random can of paint, take it to the cosmetic counter, and compare the ingredients. Then go to automotive, get a can of carburetor cleaner and compare.<br>  See what I'm getting at?|`|rHKW1CJJaa	helll no. look up the ingrediants and google them.<br>  <br>  you call methylparaben natural? tsk tsk. thats why i switched to organic stuff|`|yWoK9ryJaa	Bare Minerals is NOT ALL NATUAL its horrible how they dupe the public.

WELL WORTH IT. Also, Real Control by Redken is a really good product. I would alternate that with Redken Extreme until your hair gets into better condition. It's less pricey. probably about $15 for each. You can get deals on that though. Good luck!

l3rJFgveaa	ok. so first of all you have gorgeous eyes. Green eyes are so pretty. :D<br>  so... green is usually a warmer color, avoid shadows whose colors tend to be cool like silvers, blues, turquoise or pinks. White will also make your green eyes look too light and washed out. Instead, look for warm, earth hues like browns, yellows, peach and deeper violets & purples. Sometimes the names of the eye shadows can be be classified in names like chestnut, rich brown, goldmine, deep plums, tigers eye, etc. These colors will compliment your green eyes and make them stand out. <br>  <br>  Some good eye shadows are; <a href="http://www.maybelline.com/Product/Eye/Eyeshadow/expert-wear-eye-shadow-quads.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.maybelline.com/Product/Eye/Ey...</a><br>   pretty much any color except the pinks in that product are great for your eyes... also try and stay away from the blues. they will wash out your eyes.<br>  <br>  clinique eyshadow. i dont recomend this one becasue it is a little pricey.. this here at the bottom when you scrool down look at the color *plum seduction* that is the color that you would want.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.clinique.com/templates/products/sp_shaded.tmpl?CATEGORY_ID=CATEGORY4898&PRODUCT_ID=PROD8440" rel="nofollow">http://www.clinique.com/templates/produc...</a><br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  liner;  pretty much any nice liner that you find at the store, chesnut brown for the day and black for night. Because you have such light eyes, black would look overdone. Only use Black For night, or going out. Lightly line your bottom lash line to make your eyes pop. <br>   <br>  The eyeliner i have right now is from clinique, it is very high quality eyeliner for the price you pay. i would recomend it highly.. There are diufferent types of eyeliners.

Its just a little inconvinience you will have to deal with.  I would recomend that you wear dark brown thinkening or volumizing mascara for the day and black for the night, as i said with the eyeliner. You have long eyelashes so try to go for the mascaras that say thickening, volumizing or something along that line. Dont ever put mascara on your bottom lashes, they will make your eyes look face and over done. you should  get a mascara in brown and black. one for day one for night. <br>  <br>  <br>  A good mascara from clinique is;<br>  <a href="http://www.clinique.com/templates/products/sp_shaded.tmpl?CATEGORY_ID=CATEGORY4904&PRODUCT_ID=PROD10409" rel="nofollow">http://www.clinique.com/templates/produc...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  the mascara i have, which i love;   <a href="http://www.maybelline.com/Product/Eye/Mascara/the-colossal-volum-express.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.maybelline.com/Product/Eye/Ma...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Other mascara that i have tried and are great;   <a href="http://www.maybelline.com/Product/Eye/Mascara/define-a-lash-volumizing-washable.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.maybelline.com/Product/Eye/Ma...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  ----------------------<br>  <br>  If your mom only wants to spend money on skin products? then you could possibly get her to buy a moisturiser, that has a light tint to it, just to even out your skin tone and fix unwanted spots.

They are good quality and not to expensive as well. Bourjois khol and contour eyeliner in black is amazing!! It's got a really dark black pigment and i think that would really bring out the green in your eyes :D Mascara- Bourjois pump up the volume mascara. I always used to wonder how most the girls in my school have amazingly HUGE lashes and now I know. All I wear is eyeliner and mascara but I know what looks good on me. So yeah I wouldn't wear tonnes of make-up if I were you, just eyeliner,mascara, and maybe some foundation/concealer? And don't listen to all the people who leave comments like you're too young to wear make-up etc. You're not trust me,all the people who leave comments like that are really old and don't know much about being a teenager. :L No offence :P|`|N7I1NT6Maa	I love clinique, but I just use it for powder and blush, for eye-stuff I use drugstore brands, that way it's not so expensive.  I swear by clinique quick-corrector, all my blemishes disappear (well, are hidden) in seconds, it's awesome. Almay has a really nice line of "bring out the greens" eye makeup, they have a mascara, eyeliner, and eyeshadow designed especially for green eyes, and there are instructions on the back for how to apply the eyeshadow (there's 3 shades).  Good luck!|`|zZdMtuTmaa	For a lot of makeup you dont have to spend a lot of money. Go to your local drugstore for simple things like mascara(covergirl any of them), eyliner(Revlon cover stay) and eyeshadow(neutrogena) and anything else that looks decent. Go to sephora or pharmaca where you can get a wide selection of cleansers (sephora having tons of makeup a little pricey tho) and try them. Clinique is good but its kind of expensive. I have foundation from them and i love it but it was 20 dollars for a rather small bottle. Hope i helped!|`|1JmxcjFjaa	Clinique is very good, yes. I currently use their eyeliner and foundation and it works perfectly for me. They also have good skin products.<br>  <br>  cover-up-- It's not a stick, but something like TrueMatch or SmartShade is your best bet, that way it blends into your skin and you don't waste money trying to find the right one. <br>  <br>  Eyeliner and eyeshadow- As I said, Clinique is good but expensive. Maybelline, Rimmel London, and Almay have some decent eyeliners that are cheap. As for eyeshadow, CoverGirl has some great shades.<br>  <br>  P.S.

My friend has very deep brown eyes also, and it looks amazing when she wears her Covergirl green eyeliner with black mascara. You don't want to wear too much eyeshadow except for maybe some shimmery gold shadow. As for the cheeks and lips, keep them suddel because u played up your eyes so much. Wear a clear lipgloss for some moisture :)|`|1HDvbLdWaa	i have brown eyes and i wear colored eyeliner!<br>  purple or green is really good.<br>  especially purple eyeshadow,<br>  or purpleish, like eggplant.<br>  :)|`|EL45UeUJaa	make sure you line your eyes with eyeliner, but be sure to only line the lower waterline halfway across. Otherwise it will close them and its really hard to make your eyes defined on stage with all the lights. Also add black mascara. To make them pop apply gold or green tones to eyes, and then add a white shadow to the corners of your eyes and below your lower lashline so that the light will hit them nicely.|`|qHcEBN2Zaa	Do you have light skin?<br>  something that works is using black eyeliner on your upper lid along the lash line and then just use a peach or light brown shadow. a subtle smudge of black on your lower lid helps too.

cenjIHb2aa	I would have to disagree with the previous post.  I use Mederma for my cars and think it is a miracle product.  It would be perfect for reducing the appearance of your scars.  If you go to the website, www.mederma.com, there is coupon for $3 off the product.  Hope this helps!  Good luck!|`|9UgGwvtlaa	I know what would get rid of that but mederma wont!!|`|Gew6pZhbaa	I don't think Mederma would work. I did some research on it after I took my belly ring out and was left with a dark scar. From what I understand, Mederma causes the skin to dry up and peel, revealing new skin. It takes about two months of this process to see results, but I don't think it would work on light scars. Vitamin E oil is highly recommended on scars.

MAC doesn't even have big brush sets like that.<br>  <br>  A lot of people put the name on the brushes and sell them like they're real MAC when they're really just knockoffs.<br>  And if you're ever in doubt, just go to the MAC website and compare the brushes, if they don't look right.. they're probably not real. <br>  <br>  Here's a good guide to spotting fake brushes<br>  <a href="http://reviews.ebay.com/MAC-BRUSHES-Guide-to-Fake-vs-Authentic-MAC-brushes_W0QQugidZ10000000002525878" rel="nofollow">http://reviews.ebay.com/MAC-BRUSHES-Guid...</a><br>  <br>  And there are also lots of videos on youtube to help you spot fake products. <br>  If you want the brushes though, and don't care about the brand names.. I'd say just find a brush set that has a lot of good reviews and get it. I can't afford brands like MAC so I just get whatever I can afford and it works just fine. <br>  <br>  Anyway, sorry for the really long answer, I hope that maybe I helped a little though. :D|`|cQvE4orcaa	in general i just never trust the internet. you never know who is behind the site or who is selling you the product.

Gz8QYPgWaa	Washing your face with a facial soap with a mild exfoliant at least once a day, (but no more than twice. I would recomend using a facial soap without the exfoliant once a day, and one with once a day) followed by a toner, then a lotion are important steps in keeping your face blemish free.  If you're too tired and feel like skipping washing your face one night, don't.  its important to follow the routine.  Exfoliation will cleanse and remove dead skin, toning will get under the surface dirt out, and never ever skip moisturizing.  Very important in keeping your skin healthy and blemish free.  Dry skin can flake off and cause more blemishes by clogging pores.<br>  Any product in the drug store will work so long as you use all three of these every time.  Try to stay away from anything with alcohol in it.<br>  In terms of getting rid of existing blemishes, dab a bit of a mask, or toothpaste, anything that will harden up right on the blemish. ( Also, doing a mask on your entire face once or twice a week is also a good idea.) Sleep with it on, by morning, the blemish should be smaller.  Do this until its gone.  Tea tree oil is also good at speeding up the healing process.<br>  Hope this helps.  Its certainly helped me.  I have been fighting with problem skin for years, and I finally have it under control.|`|mJbwemH8aa	You should know first why its there now, then drink or try drinking more water, that will help, if not then go and see someone, show it to them and they will help u, but for me i think water will help and solve.<br>  <br>  .|`|0R4tlfSEaa	Witch hazel or apple cider vinegar will change your skin's pH and that will help.

Some treatments are more effective in fading or even eliminating stretch marks, but the success of the treatment depends on a few different things. First of all is the color and age of the stretch marks. If they have faded to a flesh color they are much harder to heal. Second of all, ethnicity and heredity play a role in which creams, oils and other products or equipment will succeed in healing stretch marks. <br>  <br>  The cheapest stretch mark treatment available is creams made especially for stretch marks. The most effective creams contain ingredients such as cocoa butter, lanolin and wheat germ oil. These creams actually heal and rebuild the damaged skin. While they may not be able to completely eliminate stretch marks, they may at least make the stretch marks fade to a barely visible scar. A good recommendation will be Palmer Cocoa Butter Cream.<br>  <br>  Another popular & effective cream that you might wish to consider is Strivectin.

Yes, maybe if you keep going how you are for 5 more years. <br>  Just keep in mind that High School is way tougher than Junior High.<br>  I got straight A's in junior high without working at all, but in high school you actually have to work a lot! Especially in the AP classes, which I'm assuming you'll take. Most high schools offer a wide variety of AP courses, like US History, World History, Psychology, Biology, Chemistry, English Language and Composition (english). <br>  I would suggest taking all of the AP you can. They look GREAT on college applications, and if you pass the (really hard) test at the end of the year, you can get college credit free! It may damage your GPA a little, because it is a college class, so it's difficult, but it's way worth it because that's what colleges look for, that you were challenging yourself throughout high school. <br>  If you want more information on colleges and preparation for it,<br>  go to this website:<br>  <a href="http://www.collegeboard.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.collegeboard.com</a><br>  It is awesome! and If you sign up w/ it, you can get emails from like every college!<br>  Good Luck!|`|LANPCGcFaa	OMG BABE YOU R LIKE AMAZING!!!!!

Use Bumble and Bumble. For straight hair, use a straightening iron and Herbal Essence Straightening Shampoo. For curled hair, use a curling iron and Herbal Essence Curling Shampoo.<br>  <br>  MAKE-UP:<br>  For day... Au natural. Wear a light foundation, a few coats of mascara, light blush, and glossy lip gloss. At night...

AA12288821	Yes! Extra Virgin Olive Oil is very very good for your skin! I am a skin care junkie and I was reading the reviews on makeupalley.com and people were raving about it so for the past two weeks I have been putting a small amount on a cotton ball and rubbing it over my face at night. It isn't oily it soaks right in your skin ( a little goes a long way) I was very hesitant at first thinking I would break out like crazy but, my skin is crystal clean and all my blackheads have went away. It's the best thing I have ever put on my skin and I have spent hundreds of dollars on store bought products. Check out the reviews on makeupalley if you don't believe me.|`|TAgAnfIbaa	I wouldn't use olive oil unless it is in a moisturizer. it can be heavy and clog your pores. try products with algae extract and kukui nut oil they have natural humectants that bind moisture to the skin.
Lqy9Lc9Oaa	My ears are extremely allergic to fake jewlery.  When my belly piercing had trouble healing I thought that was the problem so I got a real gold one.  It made it worse!!!<br>  <br>  The belly piercings are made of surgical steel I believe.  I can wear any belly rings without a problem.  But my ears has to be gold.<br>  <br>  Belly peircings usually take a long time to heal (6 months or more) so be prepared.<br>  <br>  I dont know about the sister/parent thing....sorry.  I think your sister can sign off for you but not sure.|`|HjKipXPzaa	it really depends on the laws of your state, but most require a parents signature.  in my state at 16 you can get your belly done.  A good piercer will use surgical steel....or titanium.  so you shouldnt have to work about that.<br>  <br>  navel piercings take a long time to heal, mine took about a year, and just when you think its healed, its not.  Id still totally recommend one though :)

Doesnt fade anymore than any other color.|`|AA11071040	There is such a thing as white tattoo ink.  If you have darker skin, it may show up some.

It's all trial and error and as long as u are happy with the end result it will be awesome! Hope this helps. Going to get mine re touched next week as well because I haven't looked after it as advised due to an allergic reaction 2 almost everything i've put on it - be careful what u use, I have found bepanthen (nappy rash cream) to be the best though. Good luck with whatever you choose.

irQMTt5maa	It's unlikely to have fully healed in just a month - cartilage piercings can take anything from a couple of months to over a year, so don't panic. <br>  <br>  H2Ocean is fine for piercings, but it's no better or worse than simple sterile saline that you can buy in a chemist/drugstore for rinsing contact lenses. However, you mention using hot salt water; heat is really useful in healing a new piercing, and you don't get that with a packaged solution. Are you just cleaning it with the hot salt water, or soaking it? Warm sea salt soaks twice daily for 5-10 minutes are highly recommended by most piercing experts; here's an explaination of how to do them correctly: <a href="http://www.tribalectic.com/Drupal/forum/healing-aftercare-questions-f5/topic2762.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.tribalectic.com/Drupal/forum/...</a> <br>  <br>  Swelling sounds normal, but your piercer or doctor is far more likely to be able to diagnose the problem and help out from looking at it. If your doctor suggests you remove the jewellery, tell them that it's important for it to be left in so it can act as a drain for any lymph, rather than trapping an infection inside the healing wound.<br>  <br>  I would go show it to your piercer or doctor, and continue to take good care of it. Good luck!|`|e8FiZHkRaa	Stop cleaning it so much and give it a chance to heal. If you're constantly soaking it and touching it, it's just going to stay the same. Leave it and only clean it when it's a bit scabby.|`|Vge3KBaMaa	well good for you , bravo bravo .|`|rpwjkuvmaa	As it's only been a month it won't heal for a while yet. Some piercings can take up to a year, whereas some never heal.<br>  However as you have pus coming out of it, it sounds like it might be infected. I'd go to the doctors just to check. Does it feel warm to touch?<br>  Your cleaning method is really good btw :) Keep it up.
asxE8gCAaa	how about leggings i think it would look cute with silver leggings! you should also wear silver hoops and maybe pull your hair back in a sloppy bun and add some bangles... or your could substitute the leggings with skinny jeans or a mini skirt(preferably denim)<br>  <br>  i think that would be cute|`|4f277076c7dd369d5ac6ab9f14e344f6aa	Cute.

Online you can find a variety of companies who will specially mix colors and types of polish for you based on your looks and your personality, as well as health concerns. This option attracts many women and the prices are reasonable.<br>  <br>  Using colors that you already have in reserve and mixing them with a more neutral base, such as a shimmer or metallic pearl, creates a new shade for your enjoyment. Many glitter shades are available now in stores, as well as lighter, more natural shades. Mixing these with a vibrant color can create many different options for your polish. Use the basic color wheel properties to guide you in your choices. Always test the polish first on one nail to see its durability and the drying color.<br>  <br>  I can no longer find my favorite polish in stores. Is there a way I can find it or make it myself?<br>  <br>  Many of the online cosmetic companies offer a variety of options for personal expression. By sending in a sample of that favorite polish, the company will work to recreate it for you. A process like this will cost more than you normally pay for nail polish, but if it is THE color, it may be worth it!<br>  <br>  If money is a concern, there is a more cost-effective way to go. As mentioned above, finding a base color will help you in the creation of your own shade. Find a base that closely resembles your favorite, and then add lights or darks to enhance the shade. Adding a pearl or nude color will lighten the base, while adding a maroon or deep red will darken it. Refer to your color wheel again for help and inspiration.<br>  <br>  How can I mix my own custom nail polish, but with polishes I already have?<br>  <br>  Mixing what you already have is a great way to create that jazzy new color you've been looking for. The best way is to wait until your bottle only has about a quarter of polish left. Then you can mix outside the bottle until you figure out the shade you want. After deducing the ingredients, you can add the color directly to the bottle without having to worry about storage. Use another brush specifically for mixing, even a watercolor brush will work, or add tiny bits of color with a toothpick.<br>  <br>  Be sure to always test-paint your new mixture on a nail to see the dry color. Sometimes polishes dry differently than what they appear in the bottle, especially those with added elements like shimmer or glitter.<br>  <br>  One other option to create a new shade is by illusion. By first applying a dark matte base, you establish a strong foundation. At least two coats of the base is recommended, though adding more may enhance the darker tone in your polish. Make sure that the base coat is COMPLETELY dry before adding any other color. Otherwise you will get a streaky effect that will spoil your brush.<br>  <br>  Then add a shimmery, glittery, or two-tone top coat layer by layer. Usually two layers do the trick, but it depends on the type of polish. Experimentation is the key...you have to be willing to try out several shades and combinations before finding the right one. Luckily, you've got five fingers and ten toes in addition to your "writing hand"!<br>  <br>  How can I do custom nail designs myself?<br>  <br>  The simplest way to create intricate designs is by first practicing on paper. Using a fine-tip permanent marker works for the darker shades, but you will want to try out polish options as well. There is no specific tool that you must use; I recommend trying a variety of different items until you find one that works for your design. I've found that toothpicks or the top of a watercolor brush work the best for smaller dots and other related designs.<br>  <br>  Many beauty supply shops offer a variety of different choice for the nail artist. There are even stencils available for quick designs! If you're looking for more than a subtle design, nail jewels are a great way to go. From gems to gold accents, these are sure to make your nails the hit of the day! Lately there have even been charms adde|`|sOO93u5Oaa	You can mix eyeshadow with clear nailpolish, or just mix a bunch of different nailpolishes together to make different colors.|`|46M6BtZtaa	Food colouring to something<br>  Can't remember what it is though<br>  Water or milk or something<br>  or you could try ink from like a pen or something|`|mhyL7Qw3aa	All you need is a clear nail polish and any color pigment you like.

eISzHe5maa	I'm pretty sure it's okay. That's all my mom and a couple her friends used to wear as shoes and her feet still look fine and she can walk with no problem. Her back sometimes gets sore but that's because of the weight in her chest. <br>  <br>  I wear heels all the time. It's the only thing for me that's comfortable to wear. I could wear flats for an hour and I'd get a huge blister for days. But in heels I could be in them for days and still be comfy. <br>  <br>  So I'm pretty sure it's okay to wear heels, but if it really starts to hurt you maybe take a break off the heels (as hard as it is for me to say it).|`|WoU3ueweaa	most likely, your feet will get ruined. Maybe not now, but it's definitely in the process of getting  injured. I wouldn't recommend wearing flats either because they don't provide support. I don't recommend wearing heels higher than 3  inches because it takes a lot of strain on your body to keep it in balance. Your body weight is added to your feet and it's a lot of pressure to handle. <br>  <br>  It's okay to wear heels but only in moderation.

And ur feet would hurt from the back too if u wear them too much, just wear it wen u go out to town or shops, or cinemas.|`|DmrLMmnDaa	The more you wear heels, the more your feet will adjust to that shape, which will ruin your feet in the long run. You may not even be able to wear flats comfortably again.|`|IyDfY636aa	Heels can make your feet deformed so try wearing flats more.

But if all else fails, just give her money, so she can choose what she wants herself and if you're concerned about the fact that you haven't put enough effort into it, then wrap it up nicely or put it inside a purse or something to give to her.

vLkvn7f9aa	Sounds like you're alergic to it - you need to stop using it straight away. You say you have sensitive skin (just lik eme) therefore it is sensible of you to go for products that are designed especialy for sensitive skin. However, through my personal experience with moisturisers, i have found that there isn't really that must of a diference  between these, and normal moisturisers...<br>  i used to get  itchy rashes that pi8mpled up to look like spots, every time i used them, n i had to go to doctors to get anti-itch cream to sooth my skin. But now i have no problems at all because i have found the right product that work for me - u need to do this too. <br>  You need to consider all the posibilities though - could it really be the moisturiser tht is making your skin like this? does it have different effects on different parts of the body? e.g. your legs...and i must advise you not to apply the moisturiser(or anything else) straight after shving is this is one of the main causes of irritation on the skin. <br>  Other possible causes could be change in diet, activity, sleep patterns, menstural cycle, even th eweather (do you have hayfever?) have you come in contact with any animals lately?. Personaly, i don't think it will be any of thes - as like you say, it is most likely to be this new moisturiser you've been using. <br>  If your skin is like mine (cos i am alergic tomost things) i suggest you could try these...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.boots.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?storeId=10052&productId=2473&callingViewName=&langId=-1&catalogId=11051" rel="nofollow">http://www.boots.com/webapp/wcs/stores/s...</a>  ...  i use this every time i get out of the shower, but this i do not use on my face, but its a great moisturiser for the rest of th ebody. i use it on my joints (e.g. elbows , ankles, knees, hips etc..) and it makes the skin feel really healthy, soft, smooth and hydrated. (i have had no problems at all and used it for years, but the reason why i dont use it on my face is because THIS (>) is what i use for my face .......)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.boots.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?storeId=10052&productId=914&callingViewName=&langId=-1&catalogId=11051" rel="nofollow">http://www.boots.com/webapp/wcs/stores/s...</a> - it makes my face feel nice and soft, and i have had hardly any spots since i hve been using it. i cant promise you that this will be the perfect product for YOUR skin (becuase every1s skin is different) but it certainly works for mee, n i have sensitive skin too, yet i haven't had any problems at all.|`|c9cTrfqEaa	Stop using it immediately If your skin is really dry you could use vaseline.

If the NO 7 moisturiser was alright on your skin then I would go back to using that if you can, and your skin should soon return to normal.<br>  <br>  If not, perhaps just washing it just with water and not really moisturising for a few days would be a good idea, just to calm the irritation and give your skin a break from chemicals for a few days. You could look up home remedies online as well, there are usually plenty of free suggestions.<br>  <br>  Also, try and drink lots of water to keep the skin hydrated which will help the body heal such irritations faster, and prevent dry skin.<br>  <br>  There's a possibility it may not be the moisturiser at all (though it seems likely it is), but if it persists and doesn't appear to go away quite soon after you stop using the simple moisturiser, I would suggest getting it checked by a doctor or dermatologist. <br>  <br>  Anyway, I'm sure it will clear away before you know it. There's no reason why it shouldn't if it's down to the moisturiser. <br>  <br>  I wish you luck; take care! :)
LgGeTaBLaa	Thats cute! <br>  yeah, you would just take it to him. and it hurts while you are getting it, it will sting..... but it doesnt hurt for long afterwords. and its all worth it. good luck :)|`|vZMN82U8aa	nice art.. but oh boy will it hurt, and you wont get it done in one sitting... <br>  <br>  the pain is bearable, but your tattoo artist wont want you in the chair all day... the worst pain will be when he tattoos your spine... bone pain is the worst type of pain... <br>  <br>  me, im an old man, covered with art...|`|djlA8Wpdaa	its nice,but its HER tattoo,get something original,similar because you obv like hers but not the same. and yes,its will hurt to high heaven.|`|pjJlPXWJaa	DONT DO IT<br>  think about wen ure older<br>  a saggy, wrinkly tattoo?|`|N9U8KFCMaa	they will be able to do it n yea if u want it there it will hurt espesuly on the spine n after wise they will tell u what 2 do after u have had it done|`|77d7d84d5a4a1152b83fd0114e664134aa	you will be very sorry in the future. but it does look cute|`|4M9gnZMDaa	i think you should get it similar to that. dont copy another persons tatt. be original

Q7ALl9zeaa	They look nice. The hard part is seeing clothes in a catalogue and looking good, but once you get them and try them on, they just don't look like you hoped they would. next time you are out shopping, why not try on a pair of jeans that are same cut style, and then you will have an idea what that style looks like on your body type. The price is good for the pants in question....can get 3 for the price of 1 almost. Or order the pants and make sure they have a good return policy, so if you don't like...back they go. Happy shopping!|`|9XVzMBzUaa	Those pants are nice, but a little plain. You might want to go with something that will stand out. Like hot pink skinnys!!!!!!!! I would sooooo wear that with a peace sign tee shirt!!!!!!! You would sooo stand out!!!|`|kf5TXPanaa	It looks like something a little girl,like5 yrs old, would be able to get away with.<br>  <br>  i dont think i'd ever wear the whole animal patteren pants.|`|X0AAQra9aa	too plain.<br>  if you sew some colourful buttons onto them then maybe.<br>  you cold also wear a really bright top and that would look cute|`|eMSP740Taa	Not so great in my opinion. But, if you pair them up with a great outfit and shoes/boots, maybe they would look pretty nice....|`|eZlnfuN8aa	I actually think they're pretty cool, I'd buy them :) They're cheap, too, my jeans are at least $20, and shipping is only $5. So all in all, I'd grab them!|`|H5PFEtVQaa	i don't really like them. id get it in a different print or color if i were you. but its your style so.|`|ybsA22tjaa	I think some skinny jeans in that color with a violet purple top would rock. with red high-heals.

Just a thought: To take better care of those jeans Instyle recommends, "wearing them more than one day and if washing is needed, turn them inside out and dry them for only five minutes, then air dry. It appears drying jeans the entire drying cycle may break down the jean fibers which cause them to wear out more than usual.|`|f1006988bdbdd7ae5e5276623f046308aa	Great price, and they are ok for casual everyday wear.<br>  If I was your Dad at that price I would let you gets several pairs of them|`|1WQTxqUmaa	i love 'em.|`|Kq1zpgU5aa	Ca-ute!|`|fKuvMPCiaa	They're alright, not very exciting|`|QmpQ3qoNaa	u could easily camouflage in a herd of elephants with those pants|`|htz7NwT3aa	boring|`|uojR7vmEaa	i think they are cute

AA10456284	No, it's not, at all. You're right to avoid the sun due to your fair skin, and you will be getting the last laugh when you're older and your friends are getting wrinkles and you're not. You could try using a lotion...not straight self tanner, but one of those "daily glow" moisturizers, like Dove Energy Glow...they are not as strong and give just a gentle, not orangey, color. And maybe a little bronzer on your face...if you want. Don't let your friends chip at your self confidence...and if they are really saying "it's ugly", maybe you could use better friends.|`|7nrhPCf0aa	yeah usually|`|3lF21cFkaa	no i dont think its ugly<br>  if you tan it makes you look fake and just blahhh its not attractive at all to some people.|`|MhLmk5YCaa	no i love being pale.so most my friends love pale people<br>  my freinds say i look a little tan around the edges of my face but get pale in the center & they like it.<br>  just tell them would you rather me be pale or red and burnt?|`|OJWApbmbaa	No men love pale porceline skinned girls trust me most men hate my already tan/olive skin color I'm constantly told I'm to dark for any american.

Pale is beautiful.|`|EBKPbkj7aa	Unnatural tan people are ugly,<br>  they're all fake-n-bake.<br>  <br>  Pale's not ugly, at all.|`|sfjMv6bdaa	If thats you in the pic than  your hella Hott. Your friends are dum asses, some really pale girls so sooo hot.. Like this one russian girl at my skool daaam, she's one of the hottest girls at my school and she's naturally pale...<br>  <br>  Tanning doesn't do anything really, it just makes you look fake... I don't get why some people are sacrificing their Lives/Health for a little bit of Beauty that doesn't even matter.....<br>  <br>  Fake tans are disgusting, trust me a lot of guys think so.|`|gD7o77Sdaa	No it is not it is considered pretty be happy the way you look! don't let nobody tell you wrong that your ugly you just don't care about what they and if they gonna make front of you and if they are i know they got something ugly about them and just fell good! So being pale is not considered ugly!|`|egOOi6Imaa	not at all!<br>  Some of the most prettiest people are pale.<br>  my favorite look is the fair skin and dark hair with emerald green eyes!<br>  btw tanning beds do cause pre mature ageing.<br>  Just look at the girls who go 3 times a week and you will see it=)|`|d61511600922f016b452fc8b39ab7408aa	You should be afraid of who you are being pale is not a bad thing all that means is that you need to stay out of the sun longer than others.|`|jL0Y27g2aa	no its not at all, call it porclean. Think of Anne Hathaway, or Angelina Jolie, those are gorgeous girls with not very tan skin, just because your tan doesnt mean your pretty|`|j6Sv8eWYaa	Naww.. i way prefer pale girls then girls who jus pile on the fake tan or whatever.. and i saw your pic you have NOTHIN to worry bout :D|`|V6Fxf3Dbaa	pale isnt ugly.

kJJOt11caa	I think your age is around 38 years old.<br>  <br>  The photo with you in the opened, buttoned up black shirt shows a GREAT physique.  The picture in the sleeveless black shirt is not as flattering.  Based on your arms not being toned I would guess that you do not do any manual labor for an occupation.  But, your coordination of the eyeglasses and silver chain, and the relative expense of both tells me that you do have a job.  And that you're concerned about your appearance-which is very important from point of view.  Women can be just as judgemental as men regarding outward appearance-you know?|`|177be15dd31cff6db1f16fb8f8e81ac1aa	ermmm i would say that you are between 29-34 andddd and and andd i dunno have a small child maybe? lol i have no idea<br>  i cnt decide on ur occupation haha theres an equal possibility of u being one of those club bouncers and a professor of mathematics<br>  lol i personally cnt judge people based on their looks only|`|hehqSpW1aa	30 something, you work in a juice bar, may have a girlfriend but not a family.|`|JoZcZJFfaa	whoopi goldberg look alike, about 32|`|EgbIYBehaa	Barry White impersonator or P.I.M.P<br>  About 40 years old, happy with life.|`|EM5rQOGBaa	ok , my guess are;<br>  <br>  u work in a gym or sumthin to do wif fitness <br>  are a bit vain<br>  would say ur bout 30 <br>  have no kids <br>   are single but would like a partner<br>   ok am nt gd at this stuff so prob wrong

ejr4tEFmaa	In my experience with these colors.  Auburn is lighter than mahogany.  <br>  Auburn has more of an orangey brownish red tone to it. <br>   <br>  Mahogany has a more dark red brownish purple tone to it.  <br>  <br>  To me.. auburn is more spring/summer  and mahogany is more fall/winter|`|mgeuli7Naa	Auburn is lighter than mahogany.<br>  I would just use mahogany.<br>  I wouldn't use both colors.|`|UG3TEWDSaa	I prefer auburn!

w1BC4paiaa	Yes. :) I'm wearing some right now.<br>  I have the blackish one,  & my friend was in love with the white giltter.<br>  But you can go to Ulta & test it out for yourself-  you can go in & use anything you want on a certain side of the store.|`|5nfqY9T7aa	I use a lot of their products and I haven't had a problem with them yet.|`|rj5KWEtcaa	yeah i loovee them. I have 4 different ones and they are like one of my favorite makeup items. They dont rub of and they can form different looks (depending on how much you put on). I would seriously recommend them, perfect for any occasion.|`|6a87cb1c2041684b43ca4ca52edacbd3aa	Yes, I own 5 of them and they add something extra to your eyeshadow.  You can wear them alone or with eyeshadow.  The glitter stays where it's supposed to (on your eyes!) and the glitter payoff is great too.  I would totally recommend catfight (a hot pink) and stagedive (a green).|`|DTGZJ8T6aa	yes, my friend has a few colors of it and she loves it, it's a unique look that you can't really get from drugstore products, it's worth the money.|`|dhN3srQbaa	Yes they're very pigmented and theres no glitter fallout to cause the "glitterbomb". go into sephora and ask for samples if your curious or go to makeupalley.com and read reviews on the product.
Ugal999qaa	Well I have always had long hair and thick but I cut it last October and wanted it to grow back really fast. Was very skeptical but just mustered up the courage to buy these 3 months ago...a year after I cut my hair! lol. Well they work great....I have had some time off of them between finishing bottles but I don't think that should be a problem...the shedding and whatnot...I think after you have achieved your desired length and thickness, you can wean yourself to just 1 pill a day instead of the 2 they direct you to take. And they have fantastic components so you can just continue to take it as your multivitamin instead of for your hair only.....read the ingredients...they are better than a multi. Hope this helps.<br>  <br>  P.S. My hair is back to its original length...pre-cut I mean|`|AA10265438	I've used it too for 5 months and it worked great. My hair grew a little over 4 inches in that time and I wasn't even taking it consistently. Unfortunately, I went to a Dominican salon and she cut about 3 inches. I was furious. I started taking them again and my hair is growing like crazy. The pills work great.
2l7lbcJWaa	When I was using bare minerals my face was SO oily I had to stop using it. So no, the mineral veil did not absorb oil off my face at ALL. It is small enough to take in your purse, but as you already know if you're using bare minerals, it's totally messy and gets everywhere when you use it. As for your skin tone, it's more of a sheer color, I think it will blend right in.|`|0815e87af19ccebc311a04b81ba46cd5aa	it doesn't exactly absorb anything, it more-so blends the powder foundation, and the warmth powder to make it look 'flawless'.<br>  it is pretty sheer, so it should work for you, but less is obviously more. the powder is still an ivory color, so if you put on a ton, it will show.<br>  I would feel a little worried about getting the bronzing mineral veil, just because that 'bronze' might not match your skin tone, and then look fake.|`|i8N3ctNfaa	I would get the tinted mineral veil
7nrhPCf0aa	ha that sucks. I have good clothes|`|ucZOCMyAaa	ask them if you can do extraa chores, and save up.|`|kPmzj4Rcaa	either try and earn some money and save up, or try changing your clothes to ones that look similar to the ones you want - customization is key here, you can buy cheap buttons/glitter/ribbon in most places to change the item.<br>  <br>  <br>  i hope this helps, good luck and have a nice day ?|`|QMYNU9uNaa	Forever21 has really good prices, so you can get a few things at a time from there at a good price instead of buying tons of stuff all at once. You should ask your parents if you could do some chores around the house or something to earn money rather than having them just give it to you.|`|QpN1OJ2aaa	you could try selling some of them or take them to a resale shop that will pay for used clothes, that way you have money to buy new stuff|`|2I5XqMDzaa	you could revamp some of ur old clothes or you could get a job|`|SrRJNzJOaa	Ok. So What I would do is just ask your paernts if you could get a couple of new clothes. You could also when it is your birthday/christmas tell people that if they want to give you presents if it could be clothes.If you have pocket money you could spent it on a couple of accesorieses to make the things you dont lik into something you  do like. look at the clothes that you dont like and then think about how you might manage to like them.|`|OiPG4aYHaa	I feel for you girl. I feel exactly the same sometimes. <br>  I think that you should just maybe not buy a whole new wardrobe, but maybe just get one newoutfit every once in a while, that way, as time goes on, you'll eventually have more than you had before.<br>  <br>  Another option, is that you could try layering your clothes for more options. Thats what I usually do :)<br>  hope I helped!|`|PdSeeHdkaa	my situation exactly ! <br>  its really embarrassing going to school with the sames clothes repeated.<br>  i just try layering a lot but still.. need NEW clothes right?<br>  <br>  just try asking your parents for a few things, save up money from (xmas,birthdays etc.. ) ask for clothing for presents, get a job, or just try layering :)|`|YQxxVdLNaa	See if you can sell your old clothes to a thrift shop. Ask your parents first. Whatever money you get from that, you can ask your parents to take you to the mall for new clothes. Technically, it's your own money and your old clothes would have rotted away in your closet.|`|mgeuli7Naa	I would hint at it to your parents. <br>  If they start to talk about the economy, wait till Christmas/Hanukkah/you know  or a birthday and just deal with it in the mean time.<br>  Make sure you make a list for your birthday and Christmas/Hanukkah/you know.|`|wnjvvRiqaa	the economy is bad agreed.. but that doesnt make ur life totally compromised. u cna get 1 or 2 of your favourite clothes at a time.. u can work part time to save some money at least over a weekend to see if it works for you.|`|NA39ZB9Maa	there are so many children in the world who cant effort to wear single new cloth especially in africa , they too poor to  wear new clothes and u saying i hate my clothes .|`|ArOGaaeZaa	omg same with me..i guess it depends in wat type of style u have...like if u like goth and stuff i think it hot..use ur skrits and put like leggings..also works with a preppy stlye :D|`|MS8EIoxmaa	I think that you should not worry about your clothes, but ask your mom if you can not have a WHOLE new wardrobe just a couple shirts and pants!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|xCHasckVaa	first of all, you need to do whatever you can to make money. babysit, wash cars, do a paper route, or if your old enough, get a real job.<br>  do chores around your house for your parents. make a chore chart and talk about how much money you should get a week. i would suggest 10 dollars a week, if not higher.<br>  save it up for a month or two. then, go to the mall and look around. i suggest going to forever 21 instead of wet seal, because they are super cheap. make sure you try on the clothes before buying them to make sure you absolutley love them. also, buy shirts that you could wear with alot of the things that you already own, like your jeans and skirts. go shopping every other month and pick out a couple new clothes with your money.<br>  <br>  if that doesnt work out, ask them if they wouldnt mind taking you out once a month to buy a shirt or two. tell them how forever 21 is super cheap and their shirts range from 5 to 20 bucks.<br>  <br>  i hope i helped! i hope you find some cute clothes c:

AA10370707	When I have finished high school, I am planning to move to New York City to study fashion and become a stylist. I am planning to apply to a fashion school called FIT, or, the Fashion Institute of Technology. The school is located in the middle of New York City, on 7th avenue in Manhattan.<br>      I want to have an apartment in Manhattan, and plan on living with a friend, so that I wont get lonely, and rent won't be as much. While I'm going to school, I would really like to get an internship with a magazine like Teen Vogue or Elle. Fashion isn't a big industry in Norway, so that's why I want to move to a major fashion hub like New York, where fashion thrives. This isn't just a 13-year-old-girl's fantasy, I want to make a career out of this.<br>  For me, fashion has nothing to do with superficiality.<br>  Fashion is art, it's expressive, and it's fun!<br>  <br>  Never use gunna or wanna in your writing. It makes you seem less intelligent, and although you may use those words in everyday speech, they are not appropriate for your writing unless they are used in dialog. Also, your writing should flow together, and not be choppy.<br>  <br>  Nice vocabulary! :)
3d1XRIzkaa	The first illustrated fashion magazine grew out of a weekly society paper that began in 1892. In 1919, it changed to a bi-monthly format, eventually blossomed into a international phenomenon with 9 editions 8n 9 countries: America,Australia, Brazil, Britian, France, Germany, Italy, Mexico, and Spain.|`|sQaw02vvaa	more like forever in the 1900's. pretty much this whole time vogue or something like it has been around, styles change though and so do magazines.|`|u5eWB2ubaa	sorry i cant stop my self, we it started right after Eve took the bite and her eyes were opened

tidw3kY5aa	I like it scrunched better, it looks not as like sharp as when it's straightened, as weird as it sounds. And your hair isn't even that bad natural, compared to mine. :]|`|87pV5lvZaa	I'm a big fan of straightened hair; it simply looks neater and elongates the face.  Although I fully understand that the time commitment can be a bother, I personally think you best with straightened hair.  Your hair is very shiny and smooth, and straightening it seems to dramatize that positive feature.<br>  <br>  That being said, I think your natural hair is far better than "scrunching" it.<br>  <br>  I suppose the biggest question, however, is which way makes YOU feel sexiest? Self-confidence will radiate outward and overshadow any hairstyle, so choose the one that boosts your ego!|`|qSQZD6Obaa	I love it schrunched, alot of girls can't wear there hair like that, so cute!<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AsoDg5RcUX0WUSod7foMolwSxgt.;_ylv=3?qid=20090227134516AAjSuq5">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|0v7Msiznaa	scrunched and has anyone ever told you that you have the most beautiful blue eyes ever.  seriously this is not a pcik up line you really have beautiful blue eyes|`|AgxtBVwoaa	It looks good either way.|`|Ue56xZ7vaa	i like it straight the most, and scrunched looks great too (:|`|9gKGCPwOaa	i think you look pretty all 3 ways! :]|`|6487bd61ef059cac042d49119a814a4aaa	scrunched...oh, and btw....you are hot.|`|K4Pwd3kfaa	Scrunched looks the best, or natural. :)<br>  When you straighten it, it doesn't have hardly any definition. It's very plain, and flat. If you add volome mousse, it'll just react to the moisture, and wave all over again. So ya, just stick with your natural hair, or have it scrunched. :)|`|cJd4SRL9aa	My favorite is natural, but it looks good all ways :]<br>  <br>  Maybe try mixing it up!<br>  You don't have to wear your hair the same way everyday.<br>  Straighten it once or twice a week, so that your hair is healthier,<br>  and scrunch or leave it natural the other days :]<br>  <br>  Goodluckk!|`|cLU6nGWwaa	I like it scrunched.

NBi07o6zaa	You are exactly like me. I have like, 6 different pairs of black or grey pants that I wear everyday with a plain t-shirt and a grey sweatshirt. I'm really fat, and every since 6th grade I thought that wearing a sweatshirt would cover it up some, plus I needed but didn't wear a bra because I was so embarassed. I guess I've just stuck with it, and now I'm stuck because I feel like if I ever take my sweatshirt off at school, people will make a big deal (my friends) and notice my fatness more than if I had just not worn the sweatshirt in the first place.<br>  <br>  I would try shopping online starting at chain clothing stores like Kohl's to find styles and colors you like, then search for those things in more specific stores.<br>  <br>  I know I'll take my sweatshirt off soon, but right now I'm comfortable with buying shoes that I like, that aren't my usual style. I buy shoes like flats and my friends compliment me, and that makes me feel so much more confident. I also cut my hair and got a lot of compliments. Start with little things. It really works.|`|RSLxXWtNaa	Target is a good store. They have a bit of variety and aren't too expensive.

eISzHe5maa	It all depends on the shoe. Most heels I'll still be a size 9 in. But if they're shoes like slides or peep toe pumps or more so a heel without straps I might go down to an 8 1/2 so my feet won't slip out from the heel.

SSD3jj7baa	Emily Z<br>  First off I know in my heart you are not ugly, ugly is a word that magazines use to make girls and guys feel "ugly." When in truth who are any of us to judge another person? <br>  <br>  Here is what I think you should do to help your unique self esteem. Everyday when you wake up I want you to compliment yourself.  Like I like my hair today? Or I make this aeropostale shirt look very nice.  Something like that.  Keep a journal too and write what makes you upset or what you don't like about yourself what makes you feel ugly.  But do not neglect what makes you feel beautiful.  It could be your laugh? your smile? your striking blue eyes?  <br>  <br>  To thy own self be true is what some dude said once.  And there is only one of you, and you are that person; the one and only wonderful person, Emily Z.  So smile! :)|`|IPkzHYdraa	If your over 18 ...

Then take a black or brown eyeliner stick (twist up kind or liquid) and apply it to your upper inner waterline, and maybe a thin line to your upper eyelid. Apply black mascara to your top lashes and bottom :D|`|8tLS1XDWaa	I would wear really natural looking make up with maybe a navy eyeshadow for some fun.... curl your hair so it frames your face,,, have fun|`|dprNLVK3aa	dont go overbord with the makeup!

4lD1d2qbaa	Naturally, bath in the sun as much as you can. With some damage: you'll have to bleach it. Other then that, there's no harmless way to do it at home...|`|yID9DF8naa	The best way to do that would probably be to go to Sally's or another professional beauty supplier, and buy a stripper. You'll need to also purchase a big ol' bottle of deep condition treatment. I would also recommend getting a strengthening shampoo. Then pick a light ASH or  neutral blonde permanent hair dye. Permanent because it will lighten your hair color, while semi- just colors over it, and ash or neutral because the stripper will turn your hair bright carroty orange. DO NOT just put the stripper in and then not dye over it, it will just turn a yucky brown. Ok, so, follow the stripper's directions. A stripper basically takes all the dye in your hair out, and is not as damaging as a bleach. Leave it in a little overtime. Wash it out according to the directions. Blow dry it, and apply the blonde dye. Leave that in a little overtime, too. Then put the after-dye conditioner in, and leave it in twice the time it says it will need....probably about 6 minutes or so. Blow dry it....and voila! Your hair will probably be a darker or dirty shade of blonde, but it will provide a good base to work on. You could try getting very light blonde highlights, or dying over it in a few weeks in a lighter blonde. Don't forget, however, to deep condition every time or other time you wash your hair, and try not to use any damaging hair tools or products for a month or so. Good luck, babe!|`|AJEYXzIUaa	my advice is to go in and have it colored because they will need to take the dark out before you CAN go blonde or you will go orange. <br>  be careful about using a color stripper yourself be case it can leave you looking like calico cat.|`|4pEiE6r6aa	Ooh, I would definitely not do it at home if your hair is this dark right now.  Try paying for the service once and then maintain at home?

BC4Gd7Ciaa	PLEASE don't bleach and or dye it again so fast!!!! Go see your hair dresser (NOT great clips!) and ask them what you should do, if you can do anything with it yourself or if they should treat it. Dye wears out your hair and it is dangerous to dye multiple times so soon, especially bleach.|`|CHpNkeAgaa	You really dont know what you are getting with those box colors....you should wait a few days and wash and condition really well, to get some of the color to fade a touch, then you can put the other darker color on...it easy to go darker, but if you get it too dark you are stuck until it fades or you have to bleach it because color doesn't lift color. DO NOT bleach it on your own. I can't tell you how many of those I have fixed. You want highlights or something goes to salon to get it done. it is worth the money. 9 times out of 10 you will end up paying more to get it fix if you do it yourself.|`|PC232FpAaa	what ever you do...DO NOT DO ANY OF THAT!!!!!!!<br>  Your hair will fall out if you do any of that. Let your hair dye settle. Check the box of dye that you used yesterday to see when the recommend you dye can dye your hair again. Also be careful when you use that bleach, it can cause serious damage to your hair...do not dye or bleach your hair today!|`|Lj5T5r1Aaa	Have a hair dresser do it.

T77593TLaa	Where I live, the air is really dry and I also have chronic dry skin problems. I have found that the best way to keep your skin hydrated and soft is to wash your face with a cleaner that has some sort of micro beads or anything that tears away the dead skin. It makes your face feel a little raw, but then immediately after apply a moisturizer made for your face. Let that soak in and become completely dry before applying makeup. If you do this on a regular basis, it will keep your skin from drying out. It will also help with your eyelids. I hope this works for you!!|`|yzPb6lbXaa	Hi, try the Pond's line, it is the BEST!! i used for a long time very expensive department store creams and now that I found the new line of Pond's I regret spending all that money on the past.

EnYKNyPxaa	i dont think you can until its healed to be honest, i have mine done and you have to have a metal bar which is long until you change it when its healed. it only takes 3 weeks or so to heal and you could proberly change it to a retainer at 2 weeks. im sure you will be able to get a less visable ball to go on the end of the bar so your dad cant see. im sure there is skin coloured ones :) good luck though it will look wicked! and it doesnt hurt at all!<br>  <br>  hmm i think i possible misunderstood haha|`|aOSZuBM9aa	dont get ur lip pierced it cud get infected n if it doesnt after 6 weeks wen ur allowed 2 take it out dere will be a hole i ur lip that will make it hard to drink without dribblin n if u go some where nice n posh the lip ring will look tacky also wen ur a granmother it wont look good think of the future not the present|`|aqY13vWNaa	Yeah, why not? Well, you can get your lip pierced with a retainer because the retainer will be on the roof of your mouth, and your lip piercing wouldn't be anywhere near it. I'm sure you can get a dull colored pink stub, I have peach pink ear rings.|`|zgDxpqRsaa	there is no need for a retainer it is harly notisable at all but its your choice also there is nothing wrong to know about piercings i have a freinds that pierced her cleavage i know weird and shes only 15|`|XAsz1bWfaa	HAHAHAHAHAHA<br>  That made absolutely no sense.|`|jtjISk6qaa	im sure you can have it pierced and then have a retainer put in instead of a ring. ask the piercer. if not you could get a stud and put a little band-aid on it.|`|2ZsRAxkuaa	Yep, but 1t has to be quartz or b1oplast. And your p1ercer would probably have to order one 1n. Acyrl1c ones are baaaad.<br>  Alot of p1ercers don't l1ke to use them though, and they can fall out pretty eas1ly. Everyone w1ll notce the g1ant red swollen b1t on your face, so they don't really work to begn w1th.<br>  <br>  <br>  And sorry my 'eye''s don't work.

bd7qDDGPaa	wearing blush cam be a ntatural look. If you need it wear it. If you want a natural look dont wera a lot|`|mhyL7Qw3aa	I absolutely love blush because it gives you just a subtle rosey flush that is desired. If you like your natural look, you can apply a small amount of blush on your cheeks. Just pick something that suits your skin color. Pinks for light skin, peaches and apricots for medium skin, and berry colors for darker skin.|`|QovnMnbNaa	Only wear it if it suit you, and it can still look natural as long as you blend it.|`|zDqlHcGSaa	Blush is the #1 make-up product that every girl needs!!!!!! It really warms up your face and adds color. You can still have a natural look with blush on, just choose a light shade of peach and apply only to the apples of your cheeks.<br>  For when you want a more sophisticated look, go with two shades, and put the darkest one in your cheekbone hollows, lightest one on your apples and blend up towards the temple.|`|zmapclE1aa	It is up to you. No-one can make you what you're not and only you can decide what to wear. I sound like some crazy religious freak don't i? Although i prefer girls with blusher on, although i hate tangerines! Yuck!<br>  If you are a tangerine please do not be offended. >;]|`|CPZe3g74aa	The natural look looks great with blusher! You just have to be careful about how much you use. Gentle blusher looks good !|`|WT108qwZaa	what ever you like wold be best|`|BxMInUUNaa	If you like the look of no blush then go with that. Personally, I never wear blush, I just think I look better without it. If you aren't really sure maybe you could just use a bit of bronzer along your cheekbones, that's what I do if I feel like I need a bit of colour there. But no blush is fine!|`|519Cs3Tyaa	blush can still look natural.the best way to choose blush is to pinch your cheek and the colour that shows is the colour you should use for your blush  also apply your blush in a teardrop shape the widest part on the apple of your cheek|`|KsaaEZqHaa	Just brush some over your cheekbones + don't overdo it!!<br>  <br>  Try to choose a colour close to your natural blush so it looks normal and not strange!! :)|`|T5HW52Oiaa	I personally don't like wearing blush... but if you like the look, and think it looks good... then go for it :)|`|faaumo51aa	blush makes u look healthy

TzJs3AYJaa	You just need to go to a trendy little hair salon where there are young GIRLS working and let them do what they think will look the best...after all, they are girls and they probably know hairstyles that you haven't even pictured existed.

FYMgfUYuaa	Okay you don't really have to dye your hair to make it look emo. You can keep it that pretty red color or just go to a store like Hot Topic and get hair extensions if you want highlights. You have to cut your hair though if you want to look emo.<br>  <br>  To get a general emo hairstyle, keep the bottom layer the length it is now. The top layer should be MUCH shorter, so that you can tease it up better. Also, get your bangs cut slanted and that will give the style a much more emo look, like this or something.<br>  <a href="http://i300.photobucket.com/albums/nn26/ankogirl/Emo%20Girls/017a626e.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i300.photobucket.com/albums/nn26/...</a><br>  <br>  Also, do not just cut the top layer short and keep the bottom long. That will give you just a big fat layer of hair. It has to be gradually longer by each layer, and the bottom should be the longest by far. If you cannot cut it that way, go to a hairdresser.<br>  <br>  I hope I helped ^_^|`|Ykzx3OVfaa	Well, mainly it depends on the cut. Ask for a LOT of short layers, but leave your hair length long and thin out the bottom layers. Don't forget thick sideswept bangs. You'll need a good volumizing hairspray like BigSexyHair or Fat Hair. Then back comb the top layers to add a ton of volume and hold.<br>  You can also buy hair extensions to clip in, but you won't have to dye your hair. You can get bleach blonde, black, or crazy colors like green and pink. They're not all that expensive either.<br>  Here's some pics of scene/emo hair that is not dyed:<br>  <a href="http://www.myemohairstyles.com/gallery/files/1/scene-hair-6.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.myemohairstyles.com/gallery/f...</a><br>  <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_0xxlBtFiUBo/R0AvKZhjIRI/AAAAAAAAAmU/6pOID7mNHLE/s400/scene%2Bhair.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_0xxlBtFiUBo/R0...</a>|`|un9XCHpraa	You have a great hair color that would look awesome with an emo hair cut.

TjPwxbuJaa	No. I have facial hair and had it when I had my labret pierced. It caused no problems. Any piercer should be able to deal with it.

X5WvcErkaa	My best advice is to start excercising, walking at least 45 min. a day, and cut your diet down to 1000 to 1200 calories.  You have to do both before you will see the results you want.  You've got time to reach the weight/size before then.  The stretch marks, I'm not sure how to get rid of those.  I do know the longer you stay over your ideal weight, the worse they can get, so the only solution to that is prevention---before they get worse.   I am forty, and battle with the same 10-15 pounds, but most of it is because i dont 'sweat' the appearance thing as much as I used to---until my jeans dont fit right.  Then, I get mad and eat more Ben and Jerry's.  I'm set in my ways, but i still excercise and am currently still trying to bust down that 15 lbs.  I know how terribly frustrating it can be, but you're young and when I was your age, I could do a push-up and lose 3 pounds.  Work that youth advantage, cuz when you get older---and still have the weight on---it will become heartbreaking.  Learn new habits NOW!   Trust me, it will pay off.  You have to put your whole heart into it though.  Dont be like me and quit after the first two days.  Go for what you REALLY want, not what tastes good at the moment.    Self-discipline is the key, and keep in mind, you will gain all the benefits by doing yourself this big favor now.|`|pbMuTNFuaa	Skin Creams and Lotions – Lotions containing cocoa butter are rumored to not only help reduce stretch marks, but to help prevent them entirely. Any cream or oil that is made specifically for the prevention or treatment of stretch marks will help keep your skin healthy and elastic. If you are pregnant or breast feeding consult your doctor first as lotions can contain ingredients that may be passed to your unborn baby or into breast milk. <br>  Vitamin A, E & C – Supplementing these vitamins may help increase the strength and elasticity of the collagen within your skin and reducing your chance of forming stretch marks. <br>  Stay hydrated. Ever try to squeeze a dry sponge? <br>  3. Stretch Mark Removal<br>  If you’re more concerned with getting rid of stretch marks than preventing them, read on. There are many methods to choose from, ranging from home remedies for stretch marks, to medical and cosmetic procedures. You will notice that every single one of these remedies also helps promote the overall health of your skin – the healthier your skin is, the better it can heal itself. Always consult your doctor before undergoing any treatment, especially if you are pregnant or nursing.<br>  <br>  Home Remedies to Remove Stretch Marks<br>  Time – Stretch marks, like all types of scarring fade over time. <br>  Retin-A (Tretinoin) – 0.1% Tretinoin creams have been shown to significantly reduce the appearance of stretch marks in a study published in the May 1996 Archives of Dermatology. See your doctor for a prescription. These creams work best when used on fresh stretch marks. WARNING: Do not use tretinoin treatments if you are pregnant of breast feeding as the active ingredient may be passed to the unborn child or the breast milk.  <br>  Exfoliate daily – use a loofah or scrunchy to remove daily. <br>  Vic’s Vapor Rub – Many people have reported success using Vic’s Vapor rub by applying it to a washcloth or paper towel and rubbing it forcefully into the scarred skin on a nightly basis for a few weeks. <br>  Increase Circulation – by taking hot baths and massaging the areas regularly. <br>  Tanning – Go sunbathing! Tanning can diminish and even eliminate minor stretch marks. Be sure to use sun screen.  <br>  Vitamin E Gel – Break open vitamin E capsules and rub the oil into the skin over the stretch marks daily for 2 weeks. <br>  Unstretch the skin – After the skin returns to its normal, unstretched size, stretch marks often become nearly invisible. <br>  Stretch Mark Creams and Lotions – Using stretch mark creams and stretch mark lotions that heal and beautify your skin can reduce the appearance of stretch marks. The following ingredients are widely accepted as beneficial for this purpose: <br>  Cocoa butter <br>  Rose hip oil <br>  Emu oil <br>  Jojoba oil    <br>  <br>  Castor oil <br>  Shea butter <br>  Vitamin A <br>  Vitamin E <br>  Vitamin C <br>  <br>  there are also many surgeries.<br>  don't go into the tanning bed makes everything tan but stretch marks stay white!<br>  <br>  hope this helps!|`|qiEDQm2paa	well, its only march so i would go for daily walks. walking is the best you can do. You don't want to just get up and go for an all out run, you wouldn't wanna risk getting hurt. as for the stretch marks, i would recommend buying lotion that can reduse the appearence of the marks

IUGS32wfaa	Even one exposure to high intensity UV rays can increase the risk of skin cancer. ^ And it is almost like an addiction. Sprays work just fine, as long as you don't go overboard and find the right kind.|`|mR50HEWDaa	I'm not an expert on tanning, lol. But I do know that going just once and seeing the results makes people want to go more and more. It's an almost an addiction.|`|3tIiulsNaa	woooaaahh there girl! Before you do this you need to know.:<br>  one time in a tanning booth won't make you tan and you CANNOT go in or 15 minutes your first time. you will BURN sooooooooo bad. The first time you should go in for about 6-8 minutes. DO NOT GO IN FOR 15. And its not that tanning beds are bad for you, they're bad when you abuse them and go for really long periods of time.
IUGS32wfaa	You need to talk to your dermatologist again. Obviously she/he recommended the wrong thing, and probably has a pretty good idea of how to fix it. In the meantime, I think the best thing to do is keep moisturizing, try to stay out of the sun, and just wait it out. The acne cream did not do well with your skin, so next time maybe test a little and see if you are allergic to it, or something. Good luck!!|`|LCFRMJFkaa	In most cases, skin discoloration fades after you finish treatment. If you're concerned about a change in the color of your skin, talk to your doctor.

ZFwC23mqaa	This reminds me of a party I went to a few years ago, and the first thing that came to my mind is that your boyfriend really, really should weara leopard print bra. Go to Victoria's Secrets or give him one of your own (red satin would be alright if you don't want to buy a leopard spot one). Just the right amount of funny trashyness and sexyness. Put it on him, stuff it, and squeeze him into one of your sexiest dresses (if he fits!!).<br>  If not, head to somewhere like Target or a charity store and get him any dress that fits which is either/or red, short, or satiny.<br>  With boys, the best will be funniest. Paint his nails red, make sure the bra shows out of the top of the dress, and buy him a bleached blond wig. Tada!<br>  For you, you want to work a boyish look without going frumpy or masculine. Try wearing one of his white shirts over leggings, or skinny jeans and one of his tshirts with one of his blazers. Try wearing a trilby hat or a boyish beanie, any maybe put on RayBan sunglasses for further adrogynous cool.|`|q9v13GoIaa	goodwill. scissors. needle and thread
b9EUvON3aa	Use the little kid sticky nails, to avoid staining his nails. Straighten his hair and stick a bow or pink head band in it. Try a short skirt with frills to show off his harry legs. Lol. A cute spaghetti strap top. Not sure about the shoes maybe wedged heels or something. And look up Jeffree Star pictures for make up ideas. He's a cross dresser. You could also look up Raquel Reed. She's a gorgeous "scene queen". Hope I was a help. Have fun at the party!|`|LiWtUCHLaa	interesting party lol
Ykzx3OVfaa	I think LC uses liquid liner on the top and flicks it up slightly at the ends for a slight cat-eye look. Usually she uses a pencil on the bottom, but in your picture it looks like she's used liquid liner on the bottom as well (you could use pencil as well though, just warm up the pencil on your hand first to keep the line smooth and precise). <br>  Use a black shade and apply in short dashes. Keep the bottom line thinner than the top. Then curl your lashes and coat both the top and bottom with black mascara.<br>  <br>  This is NOT a flattering picture of Lauren lol, but it is close up so you can see where her eyeliner is applied more easily: <a href="http://www.evilbeetgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/lc_face.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.evilbeetgossip.com/wp-content...</a>|`|Aw4pbnYBaa	use liquid eye liner at the top getting thicker as u get to the other side then getsome pencil eyeliner for the under bit of the courner and only go half way with it so it makes that end seem like you have bigger fuller lashes mascara to<br>  x

5j1w8ahNaa	Your adorable! I would suggest taking some weight off but if you want to keep your length get LONG layers (be sure to specify long layers) and bangs that almost go into your eyes, it would be extremely cute. You just need a little more shape to your hair so if you feel like taking a leap of faith, take some weight off of your head!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://s172.photobucket.com/albums/w8/disneyloverkw/Sites/hollywood/?action=view&current=09_selena_gomez.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://s172.photobucket.com/albums/w8/di...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://gossipteen.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/selena-gomez-haircut-2.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://gossipteen.com/wp-content/uploads...</a>|`|nTDCGwmvaa	yea u should cut you bangs like this<br>  <br>  <a href="http://alphadossier.files.wordpress.com/2008/02/ranchel-with-bangs.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://alphadossier.files.wordpress.com/...</a>|`|bAS074V7aa	i would actually get your hair cut shorter, like shoulder length with medium layers. keep the side bangs but make them match your hair cut|`|5a79d339ada52abdf0ba28aaebb4c86caa	idk.. i like it. maybe cut your bangs to your eyebrows. like in that movie the devil wears prada-anne hathaways bangs.... that would be pretty. And layer it up some more...hope i helped!!!|`|fXjlWQO6aa	i know you like your length, but i think on you it would look better if you cut it about 4 inches past your shoulder and tell them you want long layers. this makes it look less choppy (layers aren't all the way up to your chin or anything) and really pretty. then try just straightening your bangs and from your roots down to about 4 inches below them. it makes you look like you have beachy waves all year long!
oPFhz1EPaa	I really like the first one. It's very sophisticated. Since it has a big bow, I would lay off on a necklace or something big like that. You should get maroon (the color or the bow) heels, and then wear either a maroon bracelet, earrings, or a headband/hair clip. You want to keep the look sophisticated and not with too much pizazz because it IS a simple dress. Good luck!|`|sSlRzn2iaa	hun this is spring where some colour every one will love you|`|6HIuqEUyaa	First one would suit either, pearl neckace or black bracelet.<br>  And the second one - I love, would look nice with as pearl bracelet I think.|`|D7QdvWYDaa	I love both black dresses, for the first one I would get matching purple (opened toed) heels for the bow and a metallic silver clutch purse to match your bangles. wear purple coloured nylons or pantyhose, even a purple beret would look cute. <br>  <br>  Just a thought, paint your nails this color "Sephora by OPI "Don't Go There" <a href="http://www.sephora.com/browse/product.jhtml?id=P217311&categoryId=C107" rel="nofollow">http://www.sephora.com/browse/product.jh...</a><br>  which is a gorgeous shade of muted violet/purple color, you will love it, trust me, and match your toes with the same nail polish. I did mine and it looked great! Also it was the saleslady who works in Sephora favourite color after I purchased it, just imagine what it will look like on you. Plus, you can try it out at their store display because they have sampler testers for all their products.<br>  <br>  Plus, plenty of silver bangles or a purple funky bracelet, dangling ear rings, with touches of purple, and a chunky beaded jewel ed necklace with purple, red and black stones.|`|uJDCoXH9aa	I like the second one better.. I would accessorise it with a chunky belt (maybe a different colour) just below the bust . . and some simple jewellery.|`|RSfFN1Koaa	I don't really like either, the second if ok. I think they would look nice with pearls|`|TsXToBi6aa	Im personall not crazy about the dresses they r a bit borin for me but i would accessorise the first one with:<br>  high heel shoes in the same red colour as the bow<br>  and a thin bracelet either red (like the bow and shoes or black)<br>  <br>  second dress, i would wear black heels and a silver bracelet with silver earings|`|lLprShIVaa	On the right person those would be really pretty. I like that they're simple and classy, and you can wear them for pretty much all occasions. <br>  <br>  A cool handbag would go well with both of them.

Ur going to look great!|`|IlruG2tRaa	For the first dress you could get purple shoes to match the bow.<br>  <br>  For the second dress you could get maybe a red or another colured belt|`|gDwtf2mRaa	I like the second one the best not really keen on the first one not realy shore how to accessorise it though|`|MyreZw2yaa	i think the first one would look good with a simple set of pearls and some black pumps and number 2 would look good with leggings or knee socks and boots or flats<br>  Good Luck!!!|`|ZCDThZ4paa	their nice but it like the second better and with that same dress where nice heels nothing over the top and some bracelets like something with black i guess|`|7bYaVxRLaa	I dont like them that much<br>  well they are just not my style.

NL5I2jbvaa	Why would you need to buy clothing monthly?  When I was in middle/high school I generally only went shopping once a year, usually late in the summer, with the intent of buying new clothing.  During these trips, depending on what I found, I would usually spend a couple hundred at the most.  You should look for clothes that look good on you, and are of good quality.  If they're good quality you may spend a little more initially, but they will hold up better and save you money in the end.  Also, it's good to note that more expensive doesn't always mean better.  Just because it's a "cool" brand doesn't mean it's automatically worth the price.  <br>  <br>  If you go once or twice a year for seasonal clothing that's probably reasonable.  I'm not saying you can't go more frequently, like if you go to the mall with your friends, but it's just easier if you take a day to do most of your shopping for the year.  Also, I'm not saying you can't splurge on one or two more expensive items, but don't blow your budget on designer clothes that won't hold up :-)|`|6uzQB9OYaa	i go shopping twice a week and buy a lot every single time at bloomindales, barneys, saks, and bergdorfs. but im a shopaholic so ya. im 13 too!|`|0WjwNfzeaa	a lot!!|`|b4Ha48Avaa	i usually go to the mall every couple weeks,<br>  and shop at stores like american eagle outfitters and pacsun.<br>  i usually spend around two hundred dollars each time.<br>  <br>  and then when i don't go in a while i shop online.<br>  cause i loveloveLOVEE clothes oh so much (:|`|k7jGZydJaa	I usually go shopping once or twice a year and spend around $1000 each year.|`|XrF9uEuwaa	I usually go once a week.

SwNfb3Tmaa	I have the same problem. My hair is supper thick and frizzy. I went through 4 different Straighteners last month trying to find the best.

The flat iron can't do all the work. Try Biosilk,Paul Michel's skinny serum, or Redken's Glass.... or something like it. Some kind of serum like that. That will help a lot with the frizzys.|`|UG3TEWDSaa	GHD's are always the best so buy them in the shop, if you dont think the site you bought them on is real there's always other online shops!!|`|1d5dd8de2008c59f27a78e062fcc7db6aa	First of all you need some sort of product on your hair to get it straight. The flat iron will do its job but it can't do it alone. Try a serum or something oil based to help straighten it, it will also add shine and condition as you are applying the heat to your hair. Look for Paul Mitchells Super Skinny Serum or Redken Glass Drops. There are also sprays, such as Biolage Spray Shine that would work as well. As far as I know, every flat iron has a regular plug in... I could be wrong, but as stated by someone else, if you feel its not correct then return it. I don't suggest using a wet to straight iron... how much sense does it make to place something hot on something wet and expect it to not to any damage to your hair. Chi is a good brand, I'd also try Sedu...

HNnl1qtuaa	They are very cheap, at traget a pack of 24 is about $2.00 so throw out each one after about every 5 uses.. they cant get oily and spread bacteria among your face. Don't wash them, they'll get hard and the texture can give you a rash on your face.|`|LixZUnSCaa	I usually just wash my hands and use my fingers, but my sister uses those and I know she uses one for a few days, but rinses it with hot water and antibacterial soap and lets the sponge dry over night to avoid break outs.|`|FfZhsb9zaa	the cosmo teachers and drama teachers always say you can re-use them, so i suppose you shouldn't waist them.

c4e518a123e1b13a4b34572b4563c670aa	I have short nails too. I normally paint them black or a really dark red- almost black color. It looks good on me, and it doesn't make my nails seem too short. You could also try burgundy. And if you one day decide that you really don't want a color on your nails you can always go for a clear coat. The only thing about a clear coat is that dirt under nails can be seen. It is easier for dirt to get under your nails when you keep your nails short.|`|oYmZUO8Caa	I always keep my nails short - I usually opt for a pink.

DHuYuzQ1aa	" Can you say, amputation"?|`|rFMRgHTdaa	When you first get it the tattoo will be tender, if you but A&D ointment on it( you can find it at the baby section in the store) it should heal properly. Once the tattoo starts to scab put non scented lotion on it. Make sure you keep it moisturized. Also it will be itchy at times so don't scratch it because it can mess up the ink. good luck!|`|fj1Tk8Nyaa	You might lose that arm! ALWAYS go to a parlour!|`|4L33rOjHaa	the shop i use recommends washing the tattoo with warm water and anti-bacterial soap every 3-6 hours for the first three days. and keep it moisturized with vitamine E polysporin (the green box). use just a tiny dot of the polysporin, you only need enough to just cover the tattoo not to saturate it.

They also have the Swirl ones, but to me, they smelled like eggs *gags*<br>  The ones you have are probably older versions, because my friend used to have a few that were not on the website, like Cherry Baby for  example. <br>  My favorite ones are Sugar High, my friend's Juiced Berry and Cherry Bomb, and Tropicool.<br>  I like Spring Fling, but it is so bad smelling. It looks so pretty but it smells absolutely terrible. Like smelly, smelly athlete's foot.<br>  P.s. i forgot to mention one. I was in V.S. today and they have a new one. It's lime green and it's called Apple Tini. Please do not even bother smelling it because it smells so bad it's really disappointing.

You can easily see them when someone has them on and it just makes you look fake.

As for shoes I would say heels. Guys love heels and with skinny jeans it makes you long and lean.
D7QdvWYDaa	Jello can be found in any grocery store. Mix with water to make gelatin. I would start with a fresh clean manicure and tell the nail tech you want to keep your nails long and strong and ask what she recommends for nail growth. <br>  <br>  Try this little trick. Buy a large quantity of small nail files and some small bottles of hand lotion, a cuticle brush. cuticle or nail oil and as already suggested "Sally Hansen Diamond Nail Hardener" <br>  <br>  Place the small nail files every where you are frequent to be, at work, in every handbag, hobo bag or purse you own, in your car, at home, every room you spend the most time in, bathroom, kitchen, bedroom, etc. Along with the hand lotion. As you use the Sally Hansen Growth polish, and your nails start to grow each day, if you feel a snag or rough edge, file (in one direction) the rough edge down, use the hand lotion frequently and use a cuticle stick and push back your cuticles and the cuticle brush to stimulate ne nail growth. Use gloves to garden or other hard tasks. Maybe even to drive or plastic ones to wash dishes. If the Sally Hansen product starts to wear off, replace it.<br>  <br>  Eat jello, drink lots of milk and water to flush your body fluids. Use your favourite color polish if you like, but as a suiggestion make usre you start with a clear base coat, then at least two color coats and a top coat. You should notice a difference in a short time. Good luck.|`|SeVNpHrfaa	buy sallys hanson's hard as nails! it works amazing!!! i got it for $1.94 at target!!! you can get it at the grocery store! and its AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!! love it and also drinking lots of milk and you can take vitamins! but it a clear nail polish and works wonderful!!!|`|JPB6fgQiaa	Moisturise your cuticles and wear gloves at night in bed after you have moisturised.

AA10937211	i use Ambi facial scrub with out wetting my face to get the dead skin off. then I reapply it with water to cleanse my face softly. Next I rinse my face in lukewarm water, towel dry then apply a layer of egg whites. I let the egg whites dry then scrub my face with dry finger tips. then I rinse my face with luke warm water and apply cocoa/shea butter cream.|`|TM09z7teaa	Just wash your face everyday with a face scrub, proactive takes forever to work. <br>  I recommend clearsil. :)|`|4UXJoMbKaa	I know how you feel :) <br>  Here are some good tips:<br>  <br>  Skin pH is important. Baking Soda is a good exfoliating cleanser to use once a day, and you probably have some in your home. Mix it with a few drops of water to make a paste, and buff your skin gently. After, use a diluted solution of Apple Cider Vinegar on a cotton ball as a toner. It's really cheap if you don't already have some (check your kitchen cupboards!). Bragg's Organic is best, and non-distilled is also better. This means it shouldn't be clear, but have a little bit of a milky color to it. Always moisturize.<br>  <br>  What you eat is also important. A two/three day detox can clear your body of a lot of stuff that can cause acne. Remember-you are what you eat! You need strong, resilient skin to fight off acne, so you need foods that will help you get there. Eat A LOT of fruits and veggies. Drink lots of water. Green tea is great for your body/skin. You can even make a mask out of the used green tea leaves that's great for your skin. Drink a vegetable juice like V8. You can also get a more tasty V8 that has fruit, so it just tastes like fruit, but still has veggies in it. It's great stuff; I love it. Avoid dairy, limit eggs and meat. All those can aggravate acne, as well as that they contain hormones.<br>  <br>  Take a multivitamin (check to make sure it does not contain Iodine) every day. Fish oil pills are also beneficial. <br>  <br>  <br>  Things you can use for masks:<br>  Green Tea<br>  Oatmeal<br>  Honey<br>  Cinnamon (always use with honey, never alone)<br>  Sea Salt<br>  Egg Whites (add a dash of lemon juice to make it even better!)<br>  Egg Yolks<br>  Etc.<br>  <br>  :)|`|f39bb7e67117f442a6630c6d09215570aa	There are basically two types of acne products that you can avail of.  First, we have the ingestible ones, or the acne products which you could take in via the mouth.  Second, we have the external or topical acne products which are applied to the outer layer of the skin.<br>  <br>  Of the first group of acne products are pills like antibiotics.  Antibiotics reinforce our antibodies, and lead to a better protection of our system against harmful bacteria that, when added with oil, would cause acne.  Antibiotics, however, should be taken in moderation.  Too much of the same would make our antibodies immune to their reinforcing effects.<br>  <br>  Vitamins and supplements are also popular ingestible acne products.  If you want a natural way of preventing acne breakout, then let your body do the work by merely supplementing it with these types of acne products.  Vitamin A, vitamin C, and vitamin E are great for the skin.  Protein would also help improve the rejuvenating properties of the same.<br>  <br>  In the second group of acne products belong cleansing creams and liquids.  Most of these contain salicylic acid and benzoyl perocide, both of which are very effective in treating acne.  The problem with these ingredients, however, is that they can be too astringent for some people.  They may get rid of excess oil, but they dry up the skin too much, resulting in other forms of skin disorders.  <br>  <br>  For other effective remedies for acne treatment, you can read abt them here: <a href="http://acne.best-health-remedy.com/" rel="nofollow">http://acne.best-health-remedy.com/</a>|`|6PfJXI7iaa	I think taking a vitamin is easiest...

While it's still wet gently smudge the lines back and forth with a smudge brush to smoke it out a bit. With the bottom lashline try to smudge as close to the waterline as possible. Last, apply black eyeshadow to a blending brush very LIGHTLY (i just tap the brush into the eyeshadow pan and then blow the excess away). swipe the blending brush back and forth across ur lid and u'll notice that the black is not so intense. Keep on blending in some more black e/s until you have the right look. Another way to apply the e/s is to use a smudge brush and dust the e/s on top of the eyeliner and with a blending brush (with a little black e/s on it) blend the eyeshadow up and outwards with small circular brush strokes. Finish with two coats mascara and ur done :P|`|hl5ekhx3aa	you need black eyeliner that will stay on, then you need like a shiny black grey eyeshadow and put it all over you eyelid =]|`|LZnyAprXaa	She just smudges her eyeliner with a little sponge(:

It will make you look older. Also, try wearing some eyeliner heavily on your top eyelid, and on the inside on the bottom. If you straighten your hair, you may look a little older.

There is nothing wrong with looking young. ;]|`|HC5BJ4AQaa	I think you're pretty with lots of potential.<br>  First, get some side bangs and add some highlights to your hair.<br>  Secondly, but on a bit of dark eyeliner and eyeshadow, nothing overdone.<br>  Then dress a little more sophisticated, I honestly thought you were 12 not almost 16.|`|1bAOQbk3aa	you are pretty, i love your hair. you look like your 12 though.

I don't find it a big deal but if you want to look your age here's what you should do:<br>  Eyeliner: A tiny bit if  you want too. It obviously makes you look a little older. <br>  Mascara: Apply how much you want! It always looks good.<br>  Lip gloss: Again, how much you want but don't go too PINK or else it looks babyish and not to pretty. <br>  foundation: Not that  you need any but if you ever feel uncomfortable with with your skin you can always put that on. <br>  Also I LOVE YOUR HAIR but if  you want to make it more teenageish then straighten it and maybe but streaks in it.

I think you're really pretty and you don't have to try to look older because it'll just look like you're trying to look older and it'll look wrong. So just do whatever you feel comfortable with. Good luck!|`|6uVcWZkqaa	You look about 12 or 13.. Id say try straightening your hair out, blow drying it and using a ceramic straight iron. Maybe dye your hair a solid color like a bright blond with some dark blond low lights. And adding some foundation, find a good color for ur face, a neutral blush, a dark brown eyeliner, dark mascara, and some lipgloss foer your lips. Ud look amazing.

8UyUhlusaa	it's a difficult question but just as if you put white makeup on a black girl she would look out of place, so in the circumstances you would go for the black girl because her skin would suit her face. whereas the white girls features would probably be too white girlish to pull off the skin colour, her features may be too thin. just as a black girl's features may be too thick for white skin. <br>  So in conclusion, we are all just suited to what our mother gave us (:|`|FsVZCk0laa	You can't tell without seeing a picture, sorry.|`|oYmZUO8Caa	Whaaaaaaaaaaat? hah.|`|HC5BJ4AQaa	.... what are you trying to prove?|`|RSfFN1Koaa	I don't understand<br>  <br>  I don't think there is a way of knowing without a picture|`|5a5jZ1braa	One can be ugly & the other pretty, but color doesnt say anything...what's average that doesnt say anything i see some avg white who are ugly than some avg black and vise versa...you have to give a better discription of the pair.|`|jGk97Va3aa	i think Tiger is trying to proove do you want the fake one or do you want the natural one<br>  <br>  personally i do not like fakes <br>  i like your moral :D<br>  yey intellegant people xD|`|mkV5SiR2aa	They will both look the same just diffrerent skin colour so i wouldnt mind any will do|`|MbFS6XFQaa	yeah...that didn't make any sense

UuLZBX9daa	My parents thought it was better than a lip ring :]<br>  <br>  and yes it hurt a lot it literally felt like I got punched in the face. You should probably go with the stud, I think they look better. <br>  <br>  They're not hard to manage but you have to be careful with the stud when you're sleeping because it could fall out, it's happened to me.|`|uSqc6bUuaa	my parents were fine with it <br>  it didnt realy hurt<br>  i like both stud and ring  but only silver rings<br>  its easy to manage|`|K4PzwkDjaa	just beg.<br>  i'm getting one for my 16th birthday. my mom FINALLY agreed. obviouisly i have no personal experiance but people say it hurts way worse than lip or eyebrow :O<br>  and personally, i'd rather have a stud than a ring.<br>  :]|`|mgeuli7Naa	It didn't really hurt. It was just hard to get used to.<br>  Stud definitely. A ring looks too punk.<br>  At first, it seems hard to manage but it really is pretty easy once you get used to it.|`|D5UAhY8jaa	well i used to have one but then it got to painful when your parents abuse you and pull your nose ring if i were you get a stud|`|AA10300394	Stud definitely. It looks better in my opinion.|`|q9v13GoIaa	stud <br>  defiantly<br>  and i think you should wait a few years|`|vpbMFs6Haa	It doesn't hurt very much, but you must make sure you're caring for it properly, I would do a stud, a very small ring, too big and it looks really trashy. Tell your parents it will be small, and barely noticeable , and that you'll pay for it. You're looking at around $20.00, if you want it to be done well :)|`|dFHkSkCpaa	Youre turning 15?<br>  Im turning 15 and I kind of find those too mature...and kind of gross.<br>  Some people can pull them off, but you really dont want people to sterotype you.<br>  I would say dont, but then I dont know you, so I cant stop you.<br>  Good luck...

Good luck :o)|`|e633afd58fd578ab66287bf7228318fcaa	First of all, try to make some peace with it! A woman/girl who is at peace with looks is so inspiring and lovely. If she had some special reason to be afraid that she is not "adequate", like having very small breasts (the top womanly thing, and sign of maturity too - so theoretically I can understand how you could think it must be wrong) - but have she has some special reason to worry, and then has still made peace with it, then she is even more beautiful.<br>  <br>  Going around sending out the signal "I am so ugly, I am so ugly" - that will just make you such a hard nut to crack. And not very inspiring and charming.<br>  <br>  If you wear a bra that is so padded that it is obvious to everybody, you will also send out that signal - plus look a little "dumb".<br>  <br>  So if you want to pad a little - make sure it IS only a little. And try to relax about it and even pretend that it doesn't get you down or insecure. Then people think you are super cool, and after a while you will start thinking; "Hey, if everybody thinks that... maybe I am" - and then you are ;o)<br>  <br>  Who cares if the chicken or egg came first, it is okay to cheat a little like that - once you see that it works, it won't really feel like cheating, because it will be real.<br>  <br>  So, please don't bring yourself down about - shine, to the benefit of yourself and those who like you. It is all a matter of perception verses feeling - once you feel good about, that will change your whole perception of it.<br>  <br>  Cheer up - "very small breasts" are beautiful... if someone tells you otherwise, simply don't believe them ;o)|`|2I5XqMDzaa	aerie has good bras go there|`|5a79d339ada52abdf0ba28aaebb4c86caa	go to this link <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ae.com/aerie/browse/category_feature_item_guide.jsp?catId=cat1780028" rel="nofollow">http://www.ae.com/aerie/browse/category_...</a><br>  <br>  and scroll down to the Paige bras.

If someone tells you your skin looks flawless and they can't tell if it's b/c of make up or if you're super lucky in the genetics department then I'd say that's the perfect amount!<br>  <br>  Obviously there are times when we intentionally wear more make up than normal (smoky, bedroom eyes) but even then it needs to have an element of natural, effortless beauty.|`|LuAa7Nypaa	Most likely, you probally had too much foundation on & it was stupid of you too lie about it.

That worked wonders. (my hormones weren't fluctuating as much either since i was done with puberty once i turned 16. that helped too) The wash and cream will dry your face out though, so get a 2% salycilic acid scrub too, use every other night in place of the face wash to get dry skin off. I use a moisturizer called Miracell every morning and every night to keep my skin smooth and hydrated. u can find it at a health food store. it's expensive but worth it. And for big zits that pop up without warning, i dip a cotton ball in apple cider vinegar and press that on the zit for awhile, and then i rub some on it and let it dry, and the size of the pimple is usually significantly reduced after a  couple hours. Well, hope this helped!!!! good luck i no how frustrated and self conscious it can make u !!!!
0EOVQKiIaa	Well, the only place to buy REAL legit Abercrombie clothing is in the store or on the abercrombie.com web site. It's kind of expensive, but if you'll just be patient, they have sales at the end of each season. I just got a cashmere sweater that used to be 160 dollars for just 13 dollars! I would suggest buying the clothes in the store. Only buy online if you've tried the thing on in the store. Their sizes vary. I have clothes from Abercrombie anywhere from Small to Large...Also, you'll have to pay shipping and handling which can be up to 15 dollars. They never have any promotions where you get free shipping.<br>  <br>   Usually, the Abercrombie stores are in shopping malls. To find a location near you, go the Abercrombie.com and look for store locations. :)|`|AA11117855	It's only sold in the actual store Abercrombie and Fitch.

D7QdvWYDaa	Actually vaseline was originally used by the inventor and creator of Maybeline Cosmetics, who originally invented his mascara based on watching his sister use "vaseline" to make her eyelashes appear larger. <br>  <br>  I would check out the brand name vaseline on the "Skin Deep" database to see if it's safe to use on your eyebrows instead of what your currently using.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cosmeticsdatabase.com/index.php?nothanks=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.cosmeticsdatabase.com/index.p...</a>|`|yWoK9ryJaa	Never use vaseline on any part of your face it is very bad and will make you break out.|`|LixZUnSCaa	Hmm..I think using vaseline would probably make your eyebrows greasy. If you want them to look darker what I do is choose a brown mascara, wipe the brush off two or three times with a paper towel, and then brush through my eyebrows. The mascara also shapes them and holds them and place, but make sure you wipe off the brush first or your gonna have clumpy eyebrows.Hope that helped.

Vp1Wzu07aa	The price of the clippers would be more expensive than to do it yourself...unless you plan to do it more than the one time. I used to have a pair and buzzed my boyfriends hair...once with bad results and a few times with good results. If you are going super short, than I say go for it. They are pretty foolproof. But if you plan to use one of the extension ends, I say either pay to have someone do it or at least get a friend to help. The back side and behind the ears is difficult to do yourself.|`|rgjojdjyaa	if ur lazy. have someone else do it. if ur not lazy...still have someone else do it. i know its only buzz cut, but u never know what u would do. u could make ur head have a bold spot.eww|`|OO6eUiSpaa	Leave it to the professionals unless you just want to shave it then you can do it yourself!!|`|5PAP1hpSaa	I THINK IT ALL DEPENDS ON IF YOU CAN DO IT IF YOU CAN, I WOULD BECAUSE  IT WOULD NOT COST A DIME <br>  <br>  <a href="http://swagbucks.com/?cmd=sb-register&rb=370647" rel="nofollow">http://swagbucks.com/?cmd=sb-register&rb...</a>|`|Sgm0RrMQaa	you CAN"T mess up with clippers, go for it!!!|`|I6Yomm21aa	have sum1 do it free, that way u dont mess up|`|S28mZ2Vzaa	Buy the clippers for $20-30 at Wal-Mart, etc. and have a relative or friend do it or do it yourself if you have a 3-way medicine cabinet/mirror in your bathroom.

Au4gWgEiaa	The pain is different for everyone.  For me the front hole was pretty intense for a few seonds compared to my other piercings.  Like someone above me mentioned, after a month you can usually change it out (my piercer recommends I have him do it, but I am going to wait a little longer because I don't think it is ready).  It can take up to 15 months to heal completely.  <br>  The method:  The piercer cleans the area and marks out the spots, they will change it to what you like.  For me we played around with 3 or 4 positions before we found one that I really liked.  He had me lay down and as I exhaled slowly he pierced the first hole and slipped the barbell into it.  He then pierced the second hole and the barbell was put in the rest of the way.  <br>  It did bleed but not everyone does.  For the first week I could not put any pressure on it without it hurting and it was a little bruised.  I have had it for a month now and will be going to have it changed to a shorter bar soon.|`|coxEsXNTaa	watch this video! when i wanted to get mine done this is what i watched many times:)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfPM-esijWg" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfPM-esij...</a>|`|Zx23ZXgGaa	they take a hollow needle and pierce one side, then go into the next. Then they put the bar through. A lot of people say it hurts, but for me it only hurt after wards. Its takes a month to heal enough for you to change the bar, but mine took around 2 months to fully heal enough to be able to sleep on it without some sort of pain. But it doesn't matter, its totally worth it in the end.

Just something you can look at and be reminded of the other and smile. :)|`|LcAiHBsaaa	i have matching tattoos with three people... and unlike what these people are saying i love them all, and they're all super meaningful to me!<br>  <br>  my first one was with a good friend from when i was in the Navy... we both got three stars on our upper left ribs... one for me, one for her and one for us to follow if we ever got lost. haha it was cute.  one star is her fave color, one is mine and the one to follow we did yellow.  my other one is a four leaf clover on my left forearm that i got last st pats with a good friend.  hers she got on her foot.  the last one is stupid but both of us laugh our asses off anytime we look at it... its scissors on the outside of my left hand (i'm seeing a trend with my left side... haha) it's an inside joke that cracks us both up.  most people think its because i'm a hairstylist or something, but little do they know...<br>  <br>  hope that story there helps you out.  ha! :)|`|WpNJ3Tbraa	I was Bffs with a girl since grade 7... we "broke up" in grade 12...  really bad idea people will always let you down someway.|`|6CPIm28Kaa	i would say that you should get something small that does not have to mean youre BFFs. because there is always a possibility that in the future you wont be BFFs anymore unfortunately. if you get something like a star or something, if that was ever to happen, you would be left with a nice tattoo anyway :) just dont go getting each others names or something!! lol!|`|TsXToBi6aa	sme girls i know did the same thing. i dunno if i as a gr8 idea but ill tell u what they did anyway.

The whole tattoo isn't too big and they got it on their hip. The best part about it in my opinin though is that they got 'best friends' written in thai along one of the sides of the stars. It looks rlly pretty cuz the thai alphabet is rlly nice and unique.<br>  <br>  This is what the letters look like:<br>  <a href="http://blogs.siambackpack.com/uploaded_images/thai_alphabet-751823.gif" rel="nofollow">http://blogs.siambackpack.com/uploaded_i...</a>|`|WulN2FWMaa	bad idea.
eWQrTNVJaa	Ok, don't freak out cause these other folks don't have a clue!  Ok, under muscle can take 6 months to a year to fully drop and fluff.  Just keep the massage up.  Don't worry about one dropping faster that is normal.  Some drop together some don't it just all depends on each woman's body.  You are still very early in the recovery period.  It will come and you will look HOT!<br>  I have had 2 BAs, 1st took me from B to DD with 550/575 cc's, my next BA took me from the DD to G.  I have saline overs 790/770 mod plus, round smooth.

e1434520b7d6b7db2b483084c9ad434aaa	If you want to run out and pick up some products locally, I recommend trying the following:<br>  - Drugstore: L'oreal out of bed weightless texturizer (black tub, use under gel), LA Looks or Herbal essences gels, Suave naturals or vo5 conditioners, L'oreal vive pro hydra gloss or nutri gloss for curly hair, red Cream of Nature shampoo<br>  - Organic/specialty store (like whole foods): Giovanni Direct Leave in condish, G conditioners, G tea tree shampoo, Aubrey Organics Honeysuckle Rose or White Camellia Conditioners, AO B-5 Design gel<br>  - ULTA: Devacurl products, Biosilk rock hard gelee, MOP-c curl defining cream (They also carry drugstore products and giovanni.)<br>  <br>  These are all good things I have used, but be sure to tinker around with amounts and how you use any products. For hair type specific products check out these forums:<br>  <a href="http://www.naturallycurly.com/curltalk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.naturallycurly.com/curltalk/</a><br>  There you can find others with the same hair type and try out some of their favorite products. However, the most popular ones are usually only available online.<br>  <br>  Here are some basic tips for curly hair that you might find helpful:<br>  *Try to find a stylist who knows how to work with curly hair. You can find reviews by region here: <a href="http://www.naturallycurly.com/curlsalons" rel="nofollow">http://www.naturallycurly.com/curlsalons</a><br>  *Don't shampoo every day.<br>  *Comb conditioner through hair in the shower.<br>  *Apply styling products to dripping wet hair. Scrunch or twirl hair to achieve desired shape.<br>  *Use styling products suited for your hair type. Don’t know yours? <a href="http://www.naturallycurly.com/hair-types" rel="nofollow">http://www.naturallycurly.com/hair-types</a><br>  *Avoid terrycloth towels on hair; use linen, paper towels, or t-shirts instead.<br>  *Air dry or use a diffuser with your blowdryer.<br>  *Don't touch (or brush!) your hair while it’s drying.<br>  *Once completely dry scrunch out any crunchy texture.<br>  <br>  Lastly, it has made my hair so much better since I started the curly girl method! I used to almost never wear it down (it was a frizz/poof ball), but now I have pretty, shiny curls. ~:) It’s pretty radical—no sulfates (shampoo) or silicones—but it’s so great for curly hair. Give it a shot and check it out:<br>  <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Follow-the-Curly-Girl-Method-for-Curly-Hair" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Follow-the-Curly-...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.ylcf.org/gotcurl/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ylcf.org/gotcurl/</a> (outdated product recs!)<br>  <br>  Some other great curly care sites: <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/jessicurl" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/user/jessicurl</a><br>  <a href="http://livecurlylivefree.com/home.htm" rel="nofollow">http://livecurlylivefree.com/home.htm</a>|`|AbRfyRc9aa	after you get out of the shower, towel dry your hair then apply some sort of curling product on it. i suggest john freida's frizz ease spray. you can get it anywhere and it's great. it doesn't make your hair crunchy or anything. so spray on a pretty generous amount of that, brush your hair, then hold your head upside down and diffuse it. if you don't know what that is, it's done by attaching a diffuser to the end of your hair dryer. It works really well.
PhkWt9vEaa	I use Niocin supplements to help with hair growth, but I'm not sure if they're vegan. Try to get lots of biotin rich foods in your diet. Hair that is extremely curly will appear considerably shorter vs straight hair. A loose bun won't hinder growth. Get regular trims to stop your splits. <br>  <br>  (There are only a couple of foods which contain biotin in large amounts, including royal jelly and brewer's yeast The best natural sources of biotin in human nutrition are swiss chard, tomatoes, romaine lettuce, and carrots. This includes almonds, eggs, onions, cabbage, cucumber, cauliflower, goat's milk, cow's milk, raspberries, strawberries, halibut, oats, and walnuts) I know you can't have some of these bc you're vegan ~ just for your info|`|kUCVLuTPaa	this is weird!!!

tzfKhULYaa	Short, side-swept bangs would definitely be the most flattering to your face shape, you just need to know how to style them.<br>  <br>  I have the same problem as you do when it comes to uncooperative bangs. But here's how you make them work:<br>  <br>  Right after you take a shower, towel-dry the ends of your hair to keep it from dripping, and then use a comb to part your bangs the way you want them. Then blow-dry your bangs across your forehead, keeping them close to your face. (NEVER let your hair air dry, or dry in a towel. It's easier to style when you blow-dry your hair immediately.) If you take showers at night, fasten your bangs with a clip or bobby pin so that they'll stay in place when you sleep. That way, you won't have to worry about messy bedhead in the morning.<br>  Once you have styled your hair, fix your bangs with your fingers, and use a light coat of hairspray on your bangs (both on top of, and underneath your bangs) to keep them from separating during the day.<br>  Also, if you have fine hair, you can pull your bangs further back along the crown of your head to make your hair look thicker in the front.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps. :DD|`|2O7lYgRpaa	get side bangs! make them short but not straight across|`|xTsbN9YXaa	omg i have the same exact problem it bugs me soo much i dontt have any good ideas but tell me if u find something that works out because i could use some ideas<br>  good luck :)

9xM1JPjCaa	i would say this could definatly hinder your career aspirations with any law firm, and even if a watch would cover it, you have to keep in mind watches slip and slide around, so it ius still likely people will be well aware of your tattoo.|`|rFMRgHTdaa	I think it might affect your career choice. I work in a law firm and i have 6 tattoo's there are only 2 visible ones which are of my sons name on my neck( i have short hair so at times you can see it.) & the word Peace on the side of my finger which you can only see when i type. Anyways back to the topic, if you can cover it with a watch then you will be fine, just understand that some people might think different of you (i get this a lot at my job) but i just think that tattoo's are a form of expression.If you are a bad person it will show through your tattoo's so if you have meaning full things on you not like death tattoo's or gang tattoo's then what is the big deal people need to relax. Good Luck!|`|AA11612508	if you really want the tattoo just get it. if you think your career isnt going to approve then your career and personality arent going to be a good match. the only way to make them mesh well, is to cover it like you said. just do it. <br>  <br>  i got tattood before i even have a career and if they choose to base me off of my tatoos then that is not going to be a good job for me. i want a creative job, just like my personality.|`|WcnaX3EUaa	If you can cover it up with a watch, then it shouldn't be a problem. I'm having same dilemma with getting my tongue pierced. But if its on your wrist, and assuming you're going to be lawyer seeing as you're going to law school, you will probably wearing long sleeve dress shirts, and with a watch it should be hidden. Have you thought about putting it anywhere else though? maybe written across your clavicle or something? hope this helps!|`|AA10232177	If you are planning to go to law school, wait until after you find a position with a firm.

rHKW1CJJaa	ah stupid little girl<br>  <br>  dont steal from big places like that. trust me. i have seen there security rooms. big money = big budget. they have their sht on lockdown. now when i was like 13 i could get away with stealing thongs and little things probably because i looked so young and innocent, but when i was like 16 i got caught stealing like hundreds of dollars worth of sht. i was a minor so i just went to a shoplifting class and it was whatever. stupid. i dont steal from big places like that anymore but i do steal from like grocery stores and stuff. i mean the economy sucks, i pay taxes so a bunch of fat fcks can get medical care, etc... i deserve a break! plus im sure the bastard that owns publix is fine off without my money. so i'll steal some fancy expensive cheese and some salon hair products.... thumbs down me all you want but this system is corrupt. i would never steal from a private business or individual but corperations? pshhhhhhhhhhh|`|4lqwMnhJaa	It's really hard to steal from stores period.<br>  I've never stolen myself, but I've been a "jury" member in youth court cases and most of them include shoplifting.<br>  Out of the 12 cases that I've served, all of them have said, "My friend said it would be easy and the first time it was, but the second time I got caught." Those stores include Steve&Berry's, Express, Von Maur, Macy's, you name it. The stores have advanced camera systems and employees watching out for shoplifting. It's just not worth it.|`|jo7n4Olaaa	WHAT!?!?!?! Like are you that low you can't afford to buy the clothes and so you have to STEAL THEM?!?!?! WOW!!!!

You get the Sharpie and cross out the bar code twice diagonally. After you have done this either you put it on under a sweater or you put it in another bag of clothing you have purchased or stolen.. i have done this when it comes to clothes, video games, Cd's and even expensive $60 office pens. Trust me if you follow these steps you will not get caught by security. i do not do this any more because i have a part time Job. Honestly it feels better when you work hard for your money and buy something nice. Another advice is to get A JOB!!!|`|v6RjD1vWaa	you probably should look at if it has those securing button thing on it, and if it doesn't don't take it.<br>  but if it doesn't, try it on and take the tag off.<br>  you probably wouldn't get away taking handbags or shoes.|`|cMw8Dl2Kaa	you can't steal from there.

D3cVAg0haa	The girl in the photo has mid-length hair with her hair layered and textured. It gives it more of a lift/bounce. She also has it highlighted with a lighter shade then her own hair. Also her hair is more in the 'relaxed' hair style. It's not curly nor straight. Relaxed mean that it just curves a bit at the ends. <br>  <br>  To get this hairstyle you can just go to the hairstylist with the picture and say you want that. Then for bounce and lift experiment with some of the shampoos. Everyone's hair is different. Now watch out if you don't have the same chin bone as her's it might end up looking not like that.|`|oCJVZ1WCaa	hey(:<br>  <br>  spray your hair with a heat diffence spray, get a barrel brush and put it UNDER a section of hair, and run it down slowly - WHILE straightening, curving in towards the ends. just do this with your whole head, ruffle it up a bit, hairspray.. and your done(:<br>  <br>  hope i helped(:<br>  <br>  x|`|gkk1YC6vaa	Use thick hot rollers and then tilt your head down.. and then pick the top of your scalp to get the volume then you flip your head and shake it out.

(:<br>  <br>  Straighten your hair, wave your hair at the bottom, and use an anti frizz serum like John Frieda's.<br>  Just shampoo as usual and condition, and make sure you keep your hair healthy. <br>  Deep condition once a week to keep your hair in good condition. :D|`|FfZhsb9zaa	use a barrel round brush, shine serum and blowdry pulling the roots of your hair upward. the hair will dry with hold that way.|`|FEStjFIRaa	use pantene and blow dry!!!

They say that you need more than just good looks to make it in the business. The judges always want to see their personality and what makes them unique and individual. Also, some girls I've seen on the show either have it or they don't. <br>  <br>  Many times, they have to be coached and some girls can't position themselves right when posing for the camera - again, it's more than just having a pretty picture and being a pretty girl. It takes a lot to be a model and it's a very demanding environment. You have a strict diet plan and are always on-the-go. <br>  <br>  If you get the chance to watch the past seasons on tv, it'll give you an idea on how to pursue modeling. Hope this helps. Have a good day! :)

xp6UVyj2aa	I would say make sure you have permission from your parents. Talk to people that have a tongue piercing, make sure you are farmilliar with the studio, you must get it done by someone who knows what they are doing, you could lose your sense of taste if its done improperly. I personally want to get it done too but do your research and know the studio where you are going, and be prepared for up to a week of discomfort and inconvienience.|`|m2HUqZIpaa	i got mine done. where i live, you have to be sixteen and when you go to get it done, you have to have some kind of id [ex:permit] and a parent's signature. i love mine actually. Wherever you get it done, make sure that the place is clean (look around, make sure you don't see needles just lying around, mold, etc.) Make sure the person doing it does NOT use a piercing gun. Those are very unsanitary.<br>  The piercer should tell you what he is going to do beforehand and afterwards go over instructions on how to take care of it, when you can change it, etc.<br>  :)|`|XlSYEj1Faa	hunny, I am around your age, I have my tongue already pierced, and if you are in the mood for a piercing, dont do the tongue, it hurts, it leaves a hole, it gets infected so easily, and it does hurt your teeth, and it looks ugly, but I also have my belly button done, it barely hurts, you dont have to watch it be done, it only takes sea salt to clean it, and it looks better. so, the tongue, not a good idea, if yo have any other piercngs to question....

The henna paste will remove the ink lines and you will have a beautiful tattoo.

Even if you blow drying it and going out in the sun will still have the same effects.

q9BItD25aa	Take A&P, chemistry, physics. Getting your RN is a good career choice. RN's make about 35-45 and hour depending on where you live ( Boston pays the most money). You can go to a community college for 2 years and get your RN or go to a 4 year college and get you BSN. Then you take a state exam to qualify you to work. It depends on what type of nursing you go into. In school you will go on clinical rotation ( meaning you will have classes in all aspects of nursing...med-surg, labor and delivery, nursing home care, etc.) There is a shortage of nurses now so it is a good career choice.|`|SWsDa1iXaa	Try this in a different section, you are bound to get more answers in a category related to your question. :)
6GLRXPFmaa	here's my suggestion: have you tried Dermologica's clay cleanser? It does wonders for black heads and chin acne - two classic combination-skin symptoms. As a deep cleanser, it's gentler on the skin unlike others that leave you with a burny afterglow. <br>  <br>  Other cleanser I'd suggest is Cetaphil which is available in most pharmacies. It's specifically for sensitive skin prone to drying so you may find it helps with your chin problem. <br>  <br>  Little tip: Drink alot of water and don't over-chemicalise your face with too many products as you will destroy the skin's outer layer that becomes more sensitive and therefore, more prone to breakouts when stripped away by hot water and too much cleansing! <br>  <br>  All the best.|`|HdVHfVhRaa	Maybe you could look at makeupartistschoice.com they have a lot of different products for combination skin. I purchase products from their to help lighten acne scars that I have and it truly works.

EBfBy4XRaa	yeah....I never do much during those hours anyway, just sleep in sit around and stuff. You can go out at night, which is when most people go out anyways.  <br>  <br>  I'd do it, its a good offer and you'll get $300! thats alot in one week. Right now, I work part time and get about 8 hours, after taxes its only like $65. <br>  <br>  Its good money....really what would you normally be doing between those hours? not much|`|9DJ63NKdaa	well it really depends first of all are the kids good or bratty. if they are real brats i prob wouldnt do it. Also if you were able to have a car and take them places instead of staying in all day ex. picnic in the park, the beach for the day etc. Another deciding factor would be if you had anywhere better to be like if you were going to some island for break I so wouldnt give that up. But if you are just going to be home anyways you can hang out with friends a night I would do it and take the money under the circumstances that the kids were well behavied and I had a car so I could do fun stuff with them:)|`|MDyTwQHiaa	Sure!!!

I think it kinda takes away from your break. Instead of hanging out with your friends or something, you would be watching younger kids. I feel that on spring break it's pleasure before business! But, if you really like the family, then go ahead. My friend recently decided that she wants to go to a camp over the summer rather than a coaching job at the pool, because the camp is gonna be soo much fun. thats part of the reason i think you shou,ldnt babysit, but its your choice. good luck!|`|8tdW9FUHaa	i would so go for that. $300 for babysitting that sounds great! (not being sarcastic). that could be beneficial. and plus you still have days you can go out and have a good time.

D7QdvWYDaa	Enamel bangle bracelets? I would visit a craft shop or buy some costume jewelry ones that fit your wrist size and using your favourite coloured nail polish make your own. Use a base coat polish let dry and two-three coats of nail polish, (do one side at a time, use a spray sealer, and then finish the other side. Use quick drying nail enamel) You can go over the coloured polish and make your own designs or use acrylic paints (also found in craft stores) which are the same ones used in nail salons to make designs on nails and last longer. finish with spray on clear coat.

For example, not buying jewelry from underprivileged people?  Why? You want to rob them of their income source?  What exactly do you mean? Child labor? Environmental destruction? War funding? Poor working conditions?  Get specific about what you want.  <br>  <br>  The safest thing is to buy jewelry where the materials and the labor are from a developed country (Like Baltic amber from Lithuania, for example).<br>  <br>  But then, do you really want to take money from poor countries that need it and give it to wealthy ones that don't?|`|l9WAo7kFaa	Buy a Canadian Diamond.

24Xy8qWtaa	You can use more nail polish to get it off.<br>  I know that sounds stupid but if you don't have nail polish remover just get some nail polish and put it on then rub it off immediately and it will pull the old polish off.<br>  It would be best to just go get some remover though.|`|IWbFqtQ3aa	Just slap another coat of polish on them, no one but you will know.|`|8dnwrn1Vaa	you can use rubbing alcohol but it'll take A LOT more time. Or you can soak your hands in warm water for some time (about 20 mintutes or until the polish feels loose) and then try to peel it off. This damages the top layer of the nail, though. But I guess this is an emergency. In the future, polish your nails with thin layers rather than a few thick layers so it doesn't smudge or chip. If the nail polish itself is too thick to start with, then you should get a nail polish thinner, NOT nail polish remover or anything else inside the varnish bottle. 2-5 drops should be enough.
