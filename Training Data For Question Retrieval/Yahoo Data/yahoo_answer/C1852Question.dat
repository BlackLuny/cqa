So here's a 2nd try.      What will be the difference if I were to embedded multiple data into one single file and compressed compared to writing the multiple data to a separate file each, archive them and then compress.      Embedding the data will require us to specify the metadata of the different data ourselves though.      Will there be any difference in terms of compression ratio or efficiency in processing these?      Thanks!

20090222160651AA61T85	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Desktops	Question about my RAM and motherboard, what I should do?	First of all I am very confused bear with me, my computer is a desktop.      1. Where do I find the motherboard specs to figure out how much ram my computer will take?      2. My computer brand is Great Quality, no one knows where this brand came from lol and neither do I, it was given to me. Therefore I can not look up the configuration no website knows of my brand.      3. I have a 2 slot ram. One is a centon 256mb pc2700 HITEX8SVC and the other is a Vdata  128mb DDR333 (2.5) . My computer is only registering 128mb ram. Could it be that the centon is not taking to the computer?      4. I would like to upgrade it to at least 1gb possibly 2gb.      Basically I am just trying to figure this out and learn more about computers and the computer is running quite slow and I just want it to be somewhat faster. Hasn't been used in two years I just got done cleaning it all up deleting crap, defraging it and making sure it was virus free now that it's cleaned up it runs faster but having trouble with multiple applications.
20090222135422AAp3hSt	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Add-ons	Cyberlink Power DVD 8Ultra?	Rights concerning internet purchase?   On Christmas eve 2008 I bought and downloaded Power DVD8 Ultra from Cyberlinks website. I was very excited to be trying out blu ray on my new PC. I installed the package, put in the disc and watched through the adverts. Then after the adverts had finised the programme crashed - didn't even get to the title screen.      I tried everything I could think of, and eventually contacted Cyberlink through their support section of their website. The response I got was a rather bland, standard message, the content of which suggested that they hadn't even read what I had written. I gave them the answers they asked, including the diagnostic 'is your computer ready for Blu ray' thing (why would I have been trying to run blu ray if my computer wasn't set up for it??) and waited for an answer.      several days later, another message from them asking for more info about my comupter, which I gave them . They seemingly only answered me after this because I had to prompt them to do so.      To cut a VERY long story short, this is still going on over 2 months after the date of purchase. They have not been able to offer me a solution that makes the product work. I have now asked for my money back, and they seem VERY reluctant to let me have it! I sent my request to the link they sent me. They told me that their policy states that refunds can be given 30 days after the date of purchase! This hardly seems good enough as it is their fault it's taken this long, and it's not my fault their product does not work!      My latest message from them said that as it was over 30 days since my purchase I should follow this link  http://www.cyberlink.com/english/cs/supp...       As you can see, this tells me nothing that is any help.      I know in the UK that they are in breech of trading laws. However, as they are on the iternet, I am unsure what I can do.      All I wanted was for the product I bought to work. And now I am ending up fighting a battle to get my money back as they have not been able to make their programme usable.      Can anyone advise me where I can turn to? Does anyone know what my rights are concerning an internet purchase such as this? And does anyone know how I can get my money back off of them?      Thanks   Susan

Ok, now for those of you with this Laptop, I am curious to know if you guys are having problems with your fan... If I leave my computer on for awhile or try to do something that will use alot of memory and power, then the fan starts to rattle kinda, it sounds kinda like a sputtering sound . I dunno, it is hard to describe, but I have had this problem for like maybe 2 months now with this laptop. It doesn't really seem like it is effecting the computer in a bad way it is just annoying to hear that damn sound, because it does not sound like a properly working fan . Do you guys with this laptop have problems with your fans and when it starts making that rattling/sputtering sound while it spins, what is the best thing to do? Shut it down, and let it cool, or just ignore it all together.

Broadband, wireless, DSL and fiber optics are not currently available in my area. I guess my main concern would have to be is Wild Blue really as awful as most of the online reviews make it out to be?       I know there's a 7.5 gig per month limit for the basic package and once you pass that your speeds are throttled down to 125 kbps. Is that correct or is it actually slower? Are there any other fees I should be taking notice of? I know there's a whopping 2 year contract right off the bat so I’d really like to hear from real WB users.

To open a new window, you must first close the existing Firefox process, or restart your system."       I have tried unstalling it but it would still do that.   This started to happen after i cleaned this virus called " oscSock version 1.1 beta " from this Aim hacker. >.<   Avast had found the viruses but like a week later the program that hacks aims was still in the system so i went into "safe mode" & deleted it. since then, the interner has been acting funny.
20090222180242AAiBqYz	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Other - Hardware	Formatting a Jump Drive?	I have a jump drive that I know is infected with viruses.  (Nasty ones.  I really got bit bad.  My computer is getting formatted.)  I don't care about anything on it, I just want it formatted so that the viruses are gone.      So here's what I'm thinking:       1. Take a Deep Freeze computer (which means they reset every time you reboot... I'm talking about the school computers) off the network (even if i have to unplug the ethernet cable) and use it to format the jump drive, then reboot it.  Do you think that a virus could account for Deep Freeze, and work its way around it? (It DID lock me out of the registry, as well as get past AVG and MRT. )      2. Stick a Ubuntu CD in my computer.  If I do this, do you think the virus would still find my hard drive?  If there is any possibility that it can, I won't do it.  This was a really nasty virus.      3. Use the BIOS to format it like you would a hard drive.  I don't know how to do that.  Do you?      4. Using a Mac to format it.  Cause the virus won't effect the Mac, right?      5. Any other suggestions?

When I open and close the lid it makes a wierd clicky sound because the grey part collides with the other half of the laptop. (This'll probably sound confusing unless u have a dell laptop so if i've totally lost you, google a pic of a dell laptop :p) i used some tape to keep the white and grey part together but is there some way i can fix it myself WITHOUT taking it to be repaired?

Hi. ^^    I own a MacBook OS X. There are several programs I need that are only available for Windows, so I'm planning on getting Parallels for it.      I'm going to give my laptop to my mom when I get the program because she works with a computer guy.    So I want to make sure I know every change my laptop will go through before leaving my baby in his hands. x]      I've already searched some answers on my own, but sometimes it's not what I'm looking for and I have so many. So here I go. Please bare with me. ^^;      ------------------------------------ One: ------------------------------------   From my understanding, MacBooks are, if not completely, VERY protected against viruses. Windows on the other hand, "sits there and fishes out viruses"...   ------------------------------------- -------------------------------------   1a] So, will my MacBook become prone to viruses? However, I will not be using any browsers on Windows. I'm only going to use programs like, Paint Tool SAi, Steam, AiM, and Paint.net.    1b] If 1a is true and I install a virus protector to my Mac driver, will it also protect the Windows driver? Or should I install a virus protector to both drivers?   1c] If I get a virus through Windows, will it affect my Mac driver? Or vice versa, if it happens.      ------------------------------------ Two: ------------------------------------   I run my Macbook without the battery and just the charger because I rarely go outside with my Macbook anyways. But if I were to use the battery with my MacBook after installing Parallels...   ------------------------------------- -----------------------------------   2] Will the battery run out faster?      ------------------------------------ Three: ------------------------------------   I talked to my mom's computer guy and he said my MacBook will become slower because I'll be running a system inside a system...   ------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------   3a] Is this true?   3b] If so, how much slower will my MacBook be? Like, horribly slow or what? :[      ------------------------------------ Four: ------------------------------------   I know with that with Boot Camp, it asks you to partition (to split the driver) the Mac driver...   ----------------------------------- --------------------------------------   4a] Does Parallels ask you to do that as well?   4b] What proportions would you recommend I have my driver partitioned into (minimum)?   4c] Can I change it myself at anytime without losing any files and stuff like that?       I think that's about it.   If anyone has another other things they would like to inform me about, please let me know. ^^

Here is the logic that I am trying to accomplish:      If cookie is set, display a message stating that they have recently sent a form message with the subject and the date/time.       otherwise, if the cookie has not been set, then process the request accordingly.       The problem is that the way I have the code set up, it always sends a cookies and always displays the cookie set message.       Here is the whole form.php page code. I am new to php and need to know what I am doing wrong.       As an aside, I know that the cookie time is set only for 2 minutes - I did this for testing purposes so that I would not have to keep deleting the cookie.             <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-...

Well, the core clock is 626mhz which is normal, but the memory clock is only 1050mhz, that's the default setting btw.      The max core clock i can turn up to is 800mhz, and the max memory clock is 1200mhz.         Here's the problem, i did some Google searches on my gfx card, and a lot of sites seemed to be showing the memory clocks at around 1900mhz, so why is mine so low??

20090222184731AAY6rGi	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Other - Hardware	Is using a flash thumb drive to save important files more risky than using the hard disk?	Is using a flash aka thumb drive to save important files more risky than using the hard disk?   If my computer shuts off or goes down, such as by power outage or overheating, and the flash drive is having files written to it, will it corrupt the HARDWARE of the flash drive so it is no longer usable and must be thrown away? This article suggests it is the case, but I want user experience feedback.       http://www.ncd.com/news/2003/HDvsFlash.p...       One thing that is not reflected in the MTBF numbers however is that flash devices are primarily read-only and have limited write back capability. The disk on module (DOM) flash module will eventually become corrupted during a write operation because of the nature of the technology      This is also dangerous because these devices are so tight on free space and RAM they cannot download an entire image into RAM or flash. They must often overwrite the image as they download the new image. If there is a network failure or power outage during the download, the device is irrevocably corrupted and must be re-flashed by the vendor.

20090202104726AA6ZEeL	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	Can someone help with this CSS website I have to create?	I have an assignment that requires I create a CSS website with a forum and photo gallery. Problem is, will a forum not require that users must sign up? If so, this could really complicate matters with the need of a password retrieval system, users becoming a member, and possibly other things. I am a complete beginner with CSS. So I was wondering if anyone could offer me a simple solution to these problems.       Thanks in advance.
20090202134415AAscI0N	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	Help needed to find the best expression in Access 2007?	I have a database with two tables, I have created the relationship between the two.  I am making a sub form in a new form to combine these two tables.  On one table there are 3 fields ( as check boxes on the form) that I want to display the answer of the check box on the new form (ex: if "Application" is checked : I want to display Application on the new form - I don't want to show the other two check box options on the form).  I don't know how to combine the three fields and use an expression (?? i assume that is what needs to be done) to display the corresponding check box.  Hope I explained this well enough.
20090202135212AAqe1XQ	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	For Loop that skips an index?	I'm writing a JAVA program (although if anyone knows how to do this in any language, I could probably adapt it to JAVA syntax) where I need a for loop to count from 0 to a constant, but skip an index.  For example, for constant NUM and skipping current, I want to count 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5... current - 1, current + 1.... NUM - 2, NUM - 1.  I think I found a way to do this, but I'm not sure it will work, and I'm looking for input:      for (int i = 0; i < NUM; i=(i==(current-1))?i+2:i+1)   {          ......   }      Any suggestions? Will the above code work?

I have gathered 213 from across the web and am now struggling to find another 43. I've already used the standard ones; 0-9, a-z, A-Z, all the ones on a keyboard and several html ones. Is there a quick way to find them? If there aren't enough ascii characters out there, are there other 1 symbol characters that totals 256 or more? Thanks for any advice you can give me.      P.S. Some characters like ? show up as ? in Dev C++.
20090222194112AAB7t0y	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	Is this one gonna get the job done?	I have just recently had to unexpectedly buy a new laptop.  I previously had an archaic Dell Inspiron 1100 that I maxed out to 1 GB of memory and it barely was clunking along...  It wont' power on at all anymore, and I'm done sinking money into it (it's had two batteries, a new charger, memory, several new keyboards...)  so i had to take part of my (not huge) tax refund and buy a computer for my return to college this spring....  I would have preferred to wait and save a little more, but... needed a computer.   And I decided that I wanted to get something with Vista... I know it has its issues and uses a lot of memory, but I'm job hunting for office/clerical type jobs and the couple times I've used vista, it's been a little wierd for me.... I want to be up to date on the latest OS just in case an employer has it on their computers....        I managed to find a refurbished Acer Aspire in my price range....   It only has 1 GB of DDR2 memory, so I know I'm going to want to put the max in and have ordered two 1gb.   My only real reservation on it is that the processor is single core.  Is this going to give me enough "guts" to do my usual things (writing papers, browsing the internet, participating on a couple forums, and occasionally downloading music and pics) without it hanging too badly?  I'm used to not having the latest and greatest of technology, so it's ok if it's not insanely blazingly fast.... I just want something that isn't going to take all year to open Mozilla or Word....

Records pretty well. But, we have two questions for those who can help us...      1. The audio. The sound is awful! How do we on a low budget get great sound recording from this camcorder. We can't afford hundred-plus dollar clip mics. How do we do this?      2. Also, how do we have text to read in front of the camera, yet not "look" like we're reading something?      Your help is greatly appreciated!!

It's nothing complicated at all, but for some reason I can't get it to work.      Here's what I have included in my external file:      h1 {                    font-family:  Impact;     font-weight:  900;     font-variant:  small-caps;    }      None of this shows up. However, when I do it thusly:        Blah Blah Blah        it works fine. I know I'm including my *.css file correctly because other elements within it work fine.      The only thing I can think that may be a problem is that my   tags are within a pair of    tags, but they don't have any conflicting attributes, so that shouldn't be a problem. Am I wrong? Is my syntax messed up?

20090222195752AA8clDO	Computers & Internet;Other - Computers	Why is my computer now loading certain websites??	I first started noticing this a couple days ago.  Firefox would not load some sites I went to.  I don't remember them off the top of my head.  Then today it started happening again.  Youtube would not load at random times.  Then I tried to go to Wikipedia a couple minutes ago and it would not load.  The tab's title is "Page Load Error."  Then in the tab it says,   "Connection Interrupted The connection to the server was reset while the page was loading.   The network link was interrupted while negotiating a connection. Please try again."      So I thought it was Firefox, but I tried it in Google Chrome, and it does a similar thing.  Does my computer possibly have a virus or is it my ISP doing something.      HELP!!!         I just thought of something.  I think my parent's computer is doing something similar in IE.  My recall my dad saying that JCWhitney would not open this afternoon.      Thanks!

20090222202319AAaXXue	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Desktops	Ubuntu and XP and partitions...?	Several questions included with this one, I'm hoping for a thorough answer... partial answers (to one or more question) are welcome.      1) I'm looking to wipe my computer as well as I can, I can't remember details as to how to wipe a partition, how do I go about this? I have all my data backed up already along with vital programs.      2) If I install Ubuntu on one partition, and XP on another partition, and have all my data stored on another partition, will both OS's be able to share those files?      3) Does Linux have better MIDI timing than Windows? As it is, Windows lags pretty bad whenever I'm using my keyboard with Fruity Loops, and from what I hear it is related to the XP OS.      4) Is 512mb of DDR1 enough to run Ubuntu with no problems? I'm not sure how memory hungry it is.      5) Can I burn an ISO to a typical CD-R? Or do I absolutely have to burn an image to a DVD?      and 6) I have all my data backed up on to an iPod, and it all reads fine, will Ubuntu be able to read such an external device? It comes up as a massive storage device on XP. The answer to the first question will help me with this, if both OS can access the same data I will just transfer the data back with XP.      Thank you so much for your patience and reading and answers. I will give proper credit to the best answerer.

20090222205853AAg7Ik8	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	How would you make a C++ program to simulate a traffic signal?	I was giving the following directions to write a program and I have no clue what to do. The teacher said the traffic signal would be on the intersection of 2 one way streets, a large and small one.   1) Input or set as constants:     a) The average number of cars arriving per minute on the large street     b) The average number of cars arriving per minute on the small street     c) The number of seconds the signal is green for the large street     d) The number of seconds the signal is green for the small street     e) The number of seconds the signal is red for both streets     f) The total running time for the simulation      2) Simulate cars arriving at random on both streets      3) Output the average waiting time per car      4) Run the program with different signal timings to minimize the average waiting times with various traffic patterns.         I'm assuming that there is going to be a random number generator and some sort of way to keep time and and equation to find the average time

Foi avisado pelo anti-virus, ou só soube quando estragou?      Eu sei que tem muita gente inocente ou que simplesmente n?o entende nada de informatica e pega um virus ou outro. Eu já recebi no orkut dezenas de chances de ser pego, mas ainda n?o peguei um vírus porque tomo precau??es. Geralmente no orkut scraps auto-gerados por um script que te passam um link para vc fazer o download de um programa executavel .exe, ou um arquivo .scr. Esse programa é um virus que pode fazer muitas coisas que comprometam o computador e como todo virus ira se espalhar atraves do seu computador pela rede. Eu já recebi realmente excelente e-mails com mensagens espertas que te pegam desprevinido. Aquele tipo: "O amor da sua vida enviou um cart?o pra você", "A sua conta do orkut vai ser cancelada se n?o refizer o cadastro".

Recentemente fiz meu perfil no orkut a pedido de uma antiga amiga minha só porque ela queria ter contato comigo sem ser por e-mail.    Eu n?o curto muito orkut por causa dos perigos que estamos sujeitos no site, mas prá n?o deixá-la decepcionada, fiz.    Gostei até um pouquinho porque encontrei comunidades com pessoas que estudaram nos mesmos colégios que eu na infancia e adolescência.   Pois bem, eu tenho uma dúvida acerca da visualiza??o do perfil por outras pessoas. Quando eu preenchi coloquei em cima do perfil para que outras pessoas o vissem, mas quando eu vejo o perfil está escrito "só eu". E isso é toda vez que eu vejo ele, e toda vez mudo para "todos".    Me esclare?am: Isso é assim mesmo e eu posso ter certeza que a minha amiga verá o meu perfil ou é um problema?    Se for problema me diga como soluciono.   Obrigado.

I load up my movies... do my magic to them... convert the .avi files to im able to burn them onto a disk. Now, once it burns to the disk, i put it in my dvd player and start to watch it... all is well until sometime during the movie it just freezes and tries to keep going to the next sequence but it wont... so then it skips like 20 min. of it to go to a spot on the DVD where it could be played... the question:      Is it my DVD burner that causes these mis-haps? Or is it the program? Some movies come out perfectly!! I decrease the burning speed and everything, but idk what the problem is!      My guess is the DVD burner.. its not accurate or something..? I spent like $50 on it when i built my comp.. its a combo drive.      any advice would be amazingly perfect!! I have Windows XP, I use CuCusoft for my converting and burning. and i use DVD-R or DVD+R.. which im sure doesnt matter too much.      THanks in advance! Very much appreciated!!

20090222211506AAuc8mj	Computers & Internet;Computer Networking	Busted Neighbor kid using my wireless watching porn?	Yes, I know before anyone jumps my case; I should have my wireless connection WEP protected.  Its a long story, but I have been in very close contact with local law enforcement and believe the kid stole a PS3 and we are hoping he would connect it to the web via my network..        Anyhow, back to my question.  I caught him watching porn on my wireless.  Is there any way I can send him a message via the router to mess with his head?  Kinda like the good old DOS NETSEND command?  I am open for opinions..  Just need sweet revenge.
20090222211653AAS9sVG	Computers & Internet;Security	I think someone is stealing my internet...?	it's usually very fast because I have DSL but then lately it's been acting really weird, I'd get disconnected more often and I can tell that the speed is actually slower than normal because I go on youtube and usually I can watch HQ without any interruptions but now I have to wait for my videos to load. I don't have a password for my wireless internet I don't know how to set one up. When I browse though the wireless connections that are around me they all have a lock on it but mine doesn't. Is there anyway that I can fix this problem? Thanks for reading!

I have the standard MacBook (the older one) and I would like to connect it to my tv.  The catch is, I have one super hi-tec tv with lots of buttons and secrets lol  but it uses standard vga (I think thats the right lingo (i'm only 17, give me a break :P lol) red, yellow, white connectors).  the other tv's have the same thing, but they are a little bit older, the hi-tec one is a new, hd lcd toshiba something. I would like to know if there is one cord that I could use to connect my mac to  the tv's.  Even the hi tec one.  Just one cord.  I don't want to get a special one for the hd tv and a not special one for the old tv's.  I also don't need my mac to be shown  on an hd version.  I was just telling you guys, excuse me, geniuses :D, the details of the tv.  (Thats NOT sarcasm, by the way).      Thanks for the help!
