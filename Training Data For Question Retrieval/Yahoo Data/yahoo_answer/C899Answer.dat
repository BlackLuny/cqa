zachkYxhaa	Hi Tina.<br>  <br>  My brother is from Victoria and I used to live in Edna about 20 years ago- small world.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>   If you have no money- find someone who does to be your business partner or investor. <br>  <br>   Unless it's a wealthy friend/friend with credit you'll need to have a business plan. Get books on business plans at your library.<br>  <br>   Basically a business plan is, well, a business plan. It tells what you plan on doing with your business- how you'll make money- how much money-who your competition is etc.<br>  <br>   The most important part is- what is different about your business (and you) that will ensure that you make a profit.<br>  <br>   Will your price be lower than your competitors? Do you have a niche marketing strategy with a large market? How will you succeed when so many businesses fail?<br>   <br>  A bank or investor will want to know -<br>  <br>  1-Your background, education, skills, credit, financial assets, etc.<br>  <br>   2- Your plans for sales, marketing, distribution of profits, etc.<br>  <br>  It's more complicated than that- but not TOO hard- again get a book on business plans from the library.<br>  <br>   Someone loaning money to a stranger is concerned about their ability to repay.<br>  <br>   Read up on marketing, sales, book-keeping, customer service, etc. and you'll know the answers to give to get a loan.<br>  <br>  Have bad credit? Find someone who has good credit to be your partner.<br>  <br>   Other good places to check are the US small Business administration- they have loans and info on business plans- including sample plans- and -<br>  <br>  S.C.O.R.E Service Corp of Retired Executives. SCORE is a bunch of retired business owners who help people just starting a business. It costs nothing for their advice.<br>  <br>   Remember that if you are willing to do what it takes-and do it long enough- you can achieve your goals.<br>  <br>  Feel free to email if I haven't answered your question sufficiently.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>   <br>  Anthony|`|QbexYHbcaa	Contact your Small Business Association.

rxyOgExQaa	What sort of business are you planning on setting up? There are many workplaces who filter myspace, so your web site could end up being invisible to your target market.  A better choice would be to buy your own domain name and buy some inexpensive server space (you can get some for $5 per month).  Set up an email address tied to the domain - it is more professional than having a generic address from an ISP or free webmail account. Choose a hosting service like Site5 that includes free scripts for blogging software and start with a blog.  Buy a design customised to your business and you're off and running.  Much more professional than a myspace site.|`|luHlYUUlaa	ehhh...my space. I hink you mean myspace sister!|`|HERzDa1Qaa	I think that any business that would set up a myspace profile would appear very unprofessional.  Not many people would take your profile seriously, and would most likely deny any messages or attempts to add them as a friend.   I say, go the conventional route when contacting potential employees.

MLv83VuZaa	exactly how much are you trading? meaning the dollars you need to convert?<br>  <br>  if you have more than $5k you might get a better rate depending on your haggling abilities and bank relationships, if you are a valued client of a local bank here in the Philippines, you have a better chance of getting a higher rate.<br>  <br>  black markets, they generally buy your dollars at a lower rate, because they have nowhere else to sell those dollars than in the bank so they get their profit by buying your dollars at a slightly lower rate and sell that same dollars maybe 5 or 10 centavos higher to the bank.<br>  <br>  a deduction in the dollar peso conversion for old bills usually happens in black market or local money exchange dealers. these normally doesn't happen in banks or bigger more established fx dealers like (SM)<br>  <br>  some local banks refuse to accept old bills<br>  <br>  reason behind: smaller banks (BDO, Metrobank, SecurityBank)  who accept dollar deposits from clients and do foreign exchanges maintain accounts in bigger banks outside the Philippines like HSBC or Citibank Hongkong for reserve computations and to check for counterfeits.<br>  <br>  before the bills are deposited, the bills are segregated in three categories new, fairly new, old and/or mutilated. deposits shall be refused if the bills are not segregated properly.<br>  <br>  bills categorized shall be bundled by 100 pcs<br>  <br>  new and fairly new bills are recirculated<br>  <br>  old and mutilated bills are sent directly to the US Treasury for bill replacements.<br>  <br>  you cannot deposit old and mutilated bills if those bills are not bundled in hundreds, and since the US Treasury is very prompt in changing old bills, you rarely find old bills circulated which makes it hard to collect and make a bundle of 100. they will have to wait until there are 100 pcs of bills before it is deposited. so most of them refuse to accept old bills. this, aside from the fact that old bills are more vulnerable to counterfeiting.<br>  <br>  For the best value, go to your bank of account where you can haggle for the rate or to (SM) if you dont have a local account, SM rates and Banco De Oro rates are the same 95% of the time. Have a relative of local residency and Filipino citizenship help you with the exchange, there are exchange limitations for non residents and foreigners. Don't forget to bring an ID.<br>  <br>  If you are exchanging your dollars to peso look for the Buying Rate, because essentially the bank "buys your dollars and sell you peso." <br>  <br>  Selling Rate is used when you need to convert peso to dollars. The selling rate is normally higher because there is normally low demand for dollars in the Philippines because Peso is in circulation, the premium is also there to discourage people from buying dollars and selling peso that could have inflationary effects.

AA10464818	Many make the mistake of believing that once they create a blog, people will immediately flock to it. There are millions out there so why would they visit your blog?<br>  <br>  Here are some ways you can promote your blog<br>  <br>  1. Create great content – everything starts with great content. Think 'Linkbait" -- or writing about stuff that would be so great that people will want to link to you. It can be a news hook where you write about something that is contrary to what everyone else is saying; resource hook where you have the only information available or humor hook. <br>  <br>  2. Update the content regularly – make your visitors come back again and again to your blog by providing daily updates (even multiple posts per day!) <br>  <br>  3. Submit your blog to blog directories such as <br>  <br>  Technorati <a href="http://www.technorati.com/ping.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.technorati.com/ping.html</a>  <br>  DAYPOP <a href="http://www.daypop.com/info/submit.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.daypop.com/info/submit.htm</a>  <br>  Feedster <a href="http://www.feedster.com/add.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.feedster.com/add.php</a> <br>  Bloglines <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/register/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bloglines.com/register/</a>  <br>  Blogdex <a href="http://blogdex.net/add.asp" rel="nofollow">http://blogdex.net/add.asp</a>  <br>  TOPIX.NET <a href="http://www.topix.net/topix/faq?feedback=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.topix.net/topix/faq?feedback=...</a>  <br>  popdex <a href="http://www.popdex.com/addsite.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.popdex.com/addsite.php</a>  <br>  Blogcritics.org <a href="http://blogcritics.org/archives/2003/10/06/134209.php" rel="nofollow">http://blogcritics.org/archives/2003/10/...</a>  <br>  Blogstreet <a href="http://www.blogstreet.com/bin/addrss.cgi" rel="nofollow">http://www.blogstreet.com/bin/addrss.cgi</a>  <br>  blogwise <a href="http://www.blogwise.com/submit" rel="nofollow">http://www.blogwise.com/submit</a>  <br>  boingboing <a href="http://boingboing.net/suggest.html" rel="nofollow">http://boingboing.net/suggest.html</a>  <br>  2rss <a href="http://www.2rss.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.2rss.com/</a>  <br>  WeBlogALot <a href="http://www.weblogalot.com/Ping/" rel="nofollow">http://www.weblogalot.com/Ping/</a>  <br>  Globe of Blogs <a href="http://www.globeofblogs.com/register.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.globeofblogs.com/register.php</a>  <br>  Blog Universe <a href="http://bloguniverse.com/" rel="nofollow">http://bloguniverse.com/</a>  <br>  The Truth Laid Bear <a href="http://www.truthlaidbear.com/addtoscan.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.truthlaidbear.com/addtoscan.p...</a>  <br>  Memigo <a href="http://www.memigo.com/users/join" rel="nofollow">http://www.memigo.com/users/join</a> <br>  BlogHop <a href="http://www.bloghop.com/account/index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.bloghop.com/account/index.htm</a> <br>  Blogarama <a href="http://www.blogarama.com/index.php?show=add" rel="nofollow">http://www.blogarama.com/index.php?show=...</a> <br>  Contents Matter <a href="http://www.bloghq.com/create.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.bloghq.com/create.php</a> <br>  PubSub <a href="http://www.pubsub.com/add_feed.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.pubsub.com/add_feed.php</a> <br>  BlogSearchEngine <a href="http://www.blogsearchengine.com/submit/" rel="nofollow">http://www.blogsearchengine.com/submit/</a> <br>  EatonWeb <a href="http://portal.eatonweb.com/add.php" rel="nofollow">http://portal.eatonweb.com/add.php</a> <br>  <br>  4.

Make sure your blog is indexable by the search engines - and make sure that your titles have great keywords that your target audience are most likely to use<br>  <br>  9. Send out press releases. While outfits charge as much as $650 per release, there are free press release submission places on the Web. Press releases allow you to (a) attract media attention; (b) get more back links to your website without sending each website an email request; and (c) get more visibility especially if your press release gets in Google News or Yahoo News. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.prleap.com/sign_up.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.prleap.com/sign_up.html</a> <br>  <a href="http://i-newswire.com/" rel="nofollow">http://i-newswire.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.24-7pressrelease.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.24-7pressrelease.com/</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.pressbox.co.uk" rel="nofollow">http://www.pressbox.co.uk</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.pr.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.pr.com</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.prfree.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.prfree.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.clickpress.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.clickpress.com</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.theopenpress.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.theopenpress.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.przoom.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.przoom.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.prweb.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.prweb.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.newswiretoday.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.newswiretoday.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.free-press-release.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.free-press-release.com/</a> <br>  <br>  10.

Sua finalidade é a obten??o de recursos financeiros para os municípios.<br>  <br>  No Brasil, o IPTU costuma ter papel de destaque entre as fontes arrecadatórias municipais, figurando muitas vezes como a principal origem das verbas em municípios médios, nos quais impostos como o ISS (Imposto Sobre Servi?os, outro imposto municipal brasileiro de considerável importancia) possuem menor base de contribuintes.<br>  <br>  A base de cálculo do IPTU é o valor venal do imóvel, que deve ser entendido como seu valor de venda em dinheiro à vista, ou como valor de liquida??o for?ada. é diferente de seu valor de mercado, onde o quantum é ditado pela negocia??o, aceita??o de parte do pre?o em outros bens, entre outros artifícios, enquanto aquele, isto é, o valor venal, é ditado pela necessidade de venda do imóvel em dinheiro à vista e em curto espa?o de tempo. Por isso, o valor venal de um imóvel pode chegar a menos de 50% de seu valor de mercado. A alíquota utilizada é estabelecida pelo legislador municipal, variando conforme o município.<br>  <br>  Abra??o|`|MgBaLbO8aa	IPVA - Imposto Sobre a Propriedade Veicular Automotiva (para quem possui automóveis)<br>  <br>  IPTU - Imposto Sobre a Propriedade Territorial Urbana (para quem possui casa em centros urbanos)|`|OVlthGOPaa	IPVA é um imposto cobrado pelo governo estadual que quer dizer Imposto sobre a propriedade de veículos automotores e o IPTU é um imposto de competência da prefeitura que quer dizer Imposto sobre a propriedade territorial urbana|`|k9aem2ztaa	xi... mais contas pra pagar <br>  um é imposto anual do territorio em que vc mora e o outro é imposto anual para dirigir tipo dizem que utilizam para melhorar a pista a rua para o motorista<br>  entende?|`|q3nWblBDaa	IPVA é o Imposto sobre a Propriedade de Veículos Automotores, de competência dos Estados e do Distrito Federal, foi instituído em substitui??o à antiga Taxa Rodoviária única - TRU, cobrada anualmente pela Uni?o no licenciamento dos veículos.<br>  <br>  O IPTU, ou Imposto Predial e Territorial Urbano, é um tributo cobrado anualmente pelas prefeituras de todas as pessoas que têm a propriedade, o domínio útil ou a posse de bens imóveis localizados nas cidades.|`|tn5kvMM7aa	IPVA :comta do carro <br>  <br>  IPTU:conta da casa.|`|99e815b89b346555941ff557c05fba58aa	IPVA é Imposto sobre a Propriedade de Veículos Automotores e IPTU é Imposto Predial e Territorial Urbano.|`|efd70501b95e0cee1ff33c4c66db6814aa	IPVA Imposto sobre propriedade de veiculos automotores.<br>  IPTU Imposto predial territorial urbano.<br>  IPVA imposto estadual<br>  IPTU imposto municipal.|`|PtRKFnpNaa	- Minha linda,<br>  A resposta da usuária "prylindu" está corretíssima. <br>  Depois da forma que ela exp?s, nada mais temos a acrescentar...

4ooXYuYFaa	This is totally going to depend on where you are career wise. If you are just getting out of high school or college, it is likely that your Education section will need to be somewhere near the top of your resume. Unless you have a lot of really really good applicable work experience/internships already your education will count for a lot. As you progress through your career, it will mean less and less and will eventually be at the very end. The first section you want to have as your "attention grabber" I have a "career summary" first. This is four sentences which sum up my entire career.  Then I have a "key areas of expertise" with about 12 bullet points (which I use to fit in my scannable keywords for each job)...Maybe this is your "skills" Then I list my employment history - reverse chronological. At the end you can have professional affiliations and certifications. <br>  <br>  I'm not sure what else you could mean by "skills". The body of your resume should be used to convey your skills.   You don't necessarily need a separate "skills" section unless you are a gymnast or dog trainer. As mentioned above, you can have a skills section, but don't call it that!|`|4fad1985542c313776f0ff2ef6f6f1fcaa	yes it is. There are times that you would want to put Education before Work/Professional Experience.

Solidarité est le coeur même de cet imp?t : il permet de mettre en avant la contribution des gros patrimoines (et non pas fortunes en espèces uniquement) à la solidarité du budget de la France.<br>  <br>  Beaucoup de choses en France co?tent plus chères qu'elles ne rapportent : prend une enquête de justice avec de multiples expertises, auditions, enquêtes en tous genres, transports, analyses... Si on part du principe que ce qui est mis en oeuvre co?te plus cher que le résultat obtenu, peu de choses seraient alors entreprises. Cela vu du c?té social.<br>  <br>  Financièrement, ton ISF, en fin de compte, représente beaucoup plus que 1% des recettes fiscales (4 milliards d'euros tout de même le 1%). Les imposés ISF vont chercher à diminuer leur imposition (logique) et donc investir dans des réductions ou déductions fiscales qui feront marcher l'économie.<br>  <br>  Dis toi que des experts en finances et économie planchent tout au long de l'année sur ce qui pourrait être fait en matière économique. Contrairement à ce qu'on peut penser, une décision n'est pas avant tout démagogique, mais économique. Dès lors qu'elle est proposée et entérinée, c'est qu'elle rapporte plus (même avec du temps) que ce qu'elle co?te.<br>  <br>  Il y a un débat très intéressant à lire, c'est celui de l'assemblée nationale lors du vote de cette loi : quasiment tout y est expliqué.|`|3XledBT7aa	c'est sur que si tu mets le salaire des fonctionnaires ...... la secu aussi est deficitaire, les pompiers aussi, la police aussi .......<br>  <br>  on cherche peut etre un moyen de partage? que certains ne se sentent pas au dessus du lot?<br>  <br>  peut etre deficitaire en termes comptables ......... mais pas tant que ?a de maniere psychologique.|`|92ck8A4Gaa	C'est un imp?t inutile et stupide.<br>  C'est politiquement très incorrect de dire cela, mais c'est vrai.<br>  *Les agents du fisc: ils détiennent le taux d'absentéisme record de toute l'administration. La France détient aussi le taux de record de salariés des imp?ts proportionnellement à la population (même nombre qu'aux Etas-Unis).<br>  Il faut donc supprimer des postes, c'est en cours (certains départs à la retraite ne sont pas remplacés)<br>  *Augmenter les revenus de l'ISF:<br>  pourquoi pas? ?a passe par 2 alternatives:<br>  -plus de riches ; je crois pas que les exilés fran?ais de Suisse de Belgique (je ne parle même pas des mini-Etats) reviennent en France pour que l'ISF soit bénéficiaire.<br>  -baisser l'assiette ou augmenter le taux de cotisation; bonne idée continuons de taxer encore plus les riches; quand tous seront à l'étranger on aura l'air bien con.<br>  Sarkozy fait le contraire dans la mesure où la résidence principale ne fait plus partie du patrimoine pris en compte pour le calcul de l'ISF.<br>  L'ISF (Imp?t de Solidarité sur la Fortune) se pa?t sur la base d'un patrimoine, par sur un revenu; c'est un imp?t en plus.<br>  <br>  Je précise que je ne suis pas assujetti à l'ISF, loin de là.<br>  <br>  @tous ce que dis -a38z- est juste.<br>  La cours des comptes recense bon nombre d'incohérences bugétaires et économiques.<br>  Cette instance ne souffre d'aucune contestation dans les constats qu'elle établit, mais bien souvent ses recommandations ne sont pas suivies.<br>  Je ne l'explique pas, mais c'est un fait.<br>  <br>  Je crois que l'ISF représente 4% des recettes fiscales de l'Etat (je ne suis pas sur, mais ce n'est pas plus en tout cas).|`|LVKPl8NVaa	Si on taxe plus fort,un certain nombre de gros contribuables vont s`expatrier fiscalement . ce qu`il faut faire c`est inciter les grosses fortunes a ètre le plus utiles possible a la sociètè avec leur bien .tout comme on doit le faire avec ceux qui possèdent des richesses non matèrielles.<br>  Exemple : le savoir, l`intelligence ,le don artistique ou manuel, etc....etc.....<br>  cela ne coute rien a personne et tout le monde y gagne...|`|RVK0u0DJaa	MON DIEU, faite que je paye l'ISF, merci beaucoup.|`|fKy3MrOfaa	la mise en équation est bonne mais le résutat je sais pas ou tu l'as trouvé ??? ta source est-elle s?re ?<br>  l'ISF est là pour faire un imp?t supplémentaire à ceux qui ont les moyens de le payer<br>  De toute fa?on si c'était déficitaire faudrait que l'état soit abruti pour le laisser en place!! lol !|`|uSpnlJvdaa	ca m etonnerait que si l ISF represente 1 pour cent des recettes fiscales en France alors le cout de des fonctonnaires pour recolter cette somme soit superieure a ce revenu !<br>  <br>  Fausse informartion encore, tu dois juste avoir les boules de payer cet impot, barre toi en Belgique si t en as marre de payer des impots...<br>  <br>  et si c est vrai, et bien il faut augmenter l impot !|`|f1bff29a4ee84b82aa97b766d66acca8aa	Qu'est-ce que l'ISF a à voir avec le salaire des fonctionnaires ?

AA10672014	Being a college student is the best time to get a credit card because issuers will issue you cards with no annual fee and you can also get a credit card that gives you rewards. However, don't abuse it, but rather pay your bills on time and start building a good credit history. You will need it when you start to rent or take an auto loan. Check the resource below :|`|AA11108306	The best type of credit card that people with no credit or poor credit open is a SECURED CARD.<br>  <br>  It can either be fully or partially secured depending on the amount you deposit to open the card.  For example, depositing $500.00 to open a credit card with $500 credit line is fully secured whereas just deposting $100.00 to open the same card is partially secured.  The bank will decide which you qualify for.  This money will be deposited in an account under your name and will be used as collateral meaning if you ever default on this card, they will use that money or part of that money to pay for the card.<br>  <br>  Using this card will be just like a regular unsecured credit card.  It will help build your credit.  It will increase your score as long as you are responsible with the card.<br>  <br>  If for about year, you have proven yourself a responsible customer who always pays on time and never goes over the limit, then you can request the bank to unsecure the card.  They will return your money and the card will be converted into a regular credit card.<br>  <br>  Minimum monthly payments are USUALLY 1% of the balance (per Federal Guidance) plus any interest or fees.  The best thing though is if you pay off your balance in full every month, then you will never have to worry about interests period.|`|KHeVNhrdaa	To compare the best student credit cards try <a href="http://www.collegestudentcreditcards.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.collegestudentcreditcards.net</a>  <br>  <br>  If you want to build credit, it is a very good idea to get a credit card while you are young.  This can help a lot when you need to borrow money for a car or house in the future.  Just make sure that you pay off your credit card as soon as possible.  By missing any payments, your credit card could actually be harming your credit.|`|97201cc0a7b9f2a3fb99a8e59fd15c9eaa	Some of the better student rewards cards are the Citi mtvU card (5% rewards at restaurants and entertainment venues) and the Citi Driver's Edge for Students (3% rewards at gas/grocery/drug stores).<br>  <br>  You can use this rewards calculator to see which student rewards card will pay you the most for your normal spending:<br>  <a href="http://www.creditcardtuneup.com/?card_type=College+Student" rel="nofollow">http://www.creditcardtuneup.com/?card_ty...</a><br>  <br>  Basically, the best way to use credit cards is to funnel most of your normal spending (what you'd buy with cash anyway because you need it) through your card(s) and pay off your balance in full every month.

Call your mortgage company's loss mitigation department (just call their 1-800 number that you have for customer service and they'll send you in the right direction) and ask to be put on a payment plan.  They will set you up to pay set payments to catch up and prevent the foreclosure.  Mortgage companies do not want any homes to go into foreclosure because they lose money when this happens.  They are willing to try anything if possible to avoid the foreclosure.  Contacting them and letting them know that you are willing to pay payments to catch up will more than likely put the foreclosure on hold.  If you do not default on the payments, they cannot foreclose once you are on a set payment plan.  This will buy you time to refinance and lower your payments if you can.

KVnB6dqwaa	E' assurdo. La tua banca deve provvedere a cambiarti il bancomat smagnetizzato con un duplicato, per mantenere lo stesso codice pin, oppure ad effettuare una ri-emissione, nel qual caso ti arriverà a mezzo posta il nuovo codice pin, ed una volta in possesso del codice ti dovrai recare presso l'istituto a ritirare la nuova tessera. Tieni conto che ultimamente le nuove tessere bancomat lasciano molto a desiderare, infatti io sono in attesa di ritirare la terza nell'arco di un anno e mezzo, perchè si smagnetizza la parte della banda magnetica relativa al bancomat e funziona solamente quella dedicata alla carta di credito.

YL8R3Jubaa	Hi, mutual fund management fees are deducted on a daily basis from the asset value of the fund.  After deducting fees the net asset value is derived.  I believe ETF's work the same way.|`|d0PFbP3Taa	 Ordinarily management fees are based on the earnings of the fund or are taken from the amount invested in the fund. For every $100. you invest, they will take their percentage off the top.
I1jzTp3haa	At first notice, the real estate industry affects every facet of our lives.  Companies must have locations to do business, whether rent or own.  In the real estate industry itself, there are builders, real estate agents, contractors, lessors, investors, lawyers, banks, etc, that all require an income in order to provide their service.  Current falling home prices are a cross between individuals not being able to pay for the value of services and lack of demand for the services.<br>  <br>  Without money changing hands, there is no tax base from which to derive tax revenue.<br>  <br>  Also, keep in mind that homesteaded properties are exempt from tax up to 250,000 or 500,000 of profit, depending on whether you are singled or married.  Most investors and flippers didn't file for homestead (like almost any typical person would).  Otherwise, the only real revenue from property is property tax, which is paid to the state, not the federal government.<br>  <br>  Read the following two websites on unemployment and cities affected by the real estate crash|`|AA10469473	Could affect federal taxes since gains would be lower, so people paying capital gains tax on a home sale would pay less.  |`|MmTe8W8uaa	Yes.  <br>  <br>  1. The government (theoretically) collects capital gains taxes when homes are sold at a profit, unless any of certain exceptions apply.  Due to falling prices, the homes are being sold at a loss, not a profit, so there is less capital gains tax.<br>  2. All of the persons involved in the foreclosure process (collection agencies, auctioneers, credit counselors, etc.) pay income tax on the money that they make due to falling home prices.|`|A67iKmDqaa	Let's see:<br>  1. Wages and sales commissions of real estate workers and businesses affected by real estate<br>  2. Capital Gains<br>  3. Rental income<br>  4. Deductible interest payments and fees.<br>  5. Excise taxes changes due to tighter wallets.<br>  <br>  1. When there are fewer real estate sales, workers in real estate and related industries get paid less  (Your question talks about falling prices which usually increases sales, except in our current environment.)<br>  2. Falling prices decrease capital gains of sold houses. Even worse,  sales decline also would decrease capital gains as revenue is related roughly to a product of number of sales (with capital gains) times average gain per sale. I didn't consider capital losses because of the $3000 loss limit per year.<br>  3. Depressed prices would dampen rental income since the rent may stay fixed but the costs, such as heating, still increases.<br>  4. Decreased interest deductions would offset some of the income decreases, thus potentially increasing taxes.<br>  5. A recession may decrease sales subject to excise taxes.<br>  <br>  In other words, the issue is complex but revenue will, in general decrease in a recession.|`|yfv1STQvaa	Falling home prices directly affect local taxes as in Ca we pay property tax based on assessed value. <br>  <br>  Actually, if wages were not falling and people were renting instead of buying homes the fed tax revenue could increase as these renters would not have the "mortgage write off" that is allowed by the feds to encorage homeownership. <br>  <br>  Thats the full story and I'm sticking with it<br>  <br>  PS buy banking stocks....soon. 700 billion bail out is going to be  reflected on the street. that coming from a real estate guy (appraiser/realtor) of 22 years.

Firstly, I see many spell mistakes in your post. You cannot say excuses in such things. Regarding web design, well if you have contacts (freelance web designers) you can always get in to contracts rather than leaving them and loosing money..<br>  <br>  Also when you said you have years of experience in SEO/SEM then you should have friends who are designers or at least you can spot enough in no time.|`|e3e2b039a49b6a3d720197b8c1c91eb0aa	Hi, <br>  <br>  Congratulations on your new company. It sounds like a great idea and I think it will be well-received in the marketplace. <br>  <br>  Establishing yourself as an expert in SEO/SEM first would give you credibility. Adding the Web Development part later when you are ready will only increase your credibility. <br>  <br>  What if you hired a 3rd party to do the web design and development and they didn't deliver according to your standards? You'd have to totally rebuild that part of your business. <br>  <br>  By offering it at a later date, you also have an opportunity to keep your brand fresh and exciting. Many companies start out with just one product and then add to it. People will perceive your company as an innovative leader in your industry. <br>  <br>  Best wishes on your business concept. I look forward to seeing what you put together.

HPFmwuN5aa	A professional musician can deduct the cost of owning and maintaining an instrument,  even though pianists typically do not transport or play  their personal instruments on their engagements. <br>  <br>  Just owning a computer to be knowledgeable enough for his job would not qualify your husband for a deduction,  as being knowledgeable is a basic requirement for his job.  However the cost of any specific software he has to purchase,  repairs and upkeep on his computer,  internet access,  or a new computer if it's used primarily for business could be deducted as un-reimbursed employee expenses on Form 2106,  if his employer does not provide these items.|`|ELlekKEjaa	You will need to provide more information to determine if there is a potential deduction.  What is the business use?  Is there a personal use?  For example, is the piano used at concerts?

IVy35SE2aa	A few years ago people chose a career job with a big corporation.<br>  They figured on retirement from that job.  It worked that way for years.<br>  <br>  Then came a recession.  Many people who had been transferred by their companies faced lay offs.  How would they make it in strange<br>  cities with no jobs?  This was when the realization came to most<br>  people that it is better to stay near home where family and friends<br>  can help in such an emergency.<br>  <br>  If you have a very sell able skill, like accounting, then it is not<br>  too risky to relocate to a place you would prefer to live.|`|nW3iJkT5aa	Great new British strategy<br>  Learn to scrounge before learning how to find a job|`|46b917a157d5aaff534db257443de9f5aa	Very risky in this economy.

"Claiming the dole" didn't come into it - I lived off my savings for the short time (i.e. two weeks maybe) that it took to find a temp job, and then worked in temp positions until I found a permanent job.<br>  <br>  When you move, stay in temporary accommodation like in a hostel or on a mate's floor.  You can't rent a flat without having a job (no-one will rent to you) so you need to make finding a job your first priority.<br>  <br>  The downside is that you will end up taking whatever job you can find, and for me this meant temping because that means that you can start quickly, maybe even the very day after you interview, and you get paid weekly instead of monthly.  However, if you do end up taking just any job, then once you're working it becomes hard to look for a better job because you don't have the time to trawl through job sites or to attend interviews.<br>  <br>  Now, having said that I've done it ... I did it back in 2003 when the economy was better and there were far more jobs around.  I was also only one year out of university meaning that I could afford to roll the dice with my career, and it didn't hurt to be taking just any entry-level job.<br>  <br>  My concern about doing it in the present economic situation would be that it doesn't matter where you're relocating to; there are simply no jobs anywhere.  For that reason, whilst you don't say what your current situation is, it can very often be better to stay where you are.  It's always better to have friends and family around you when times are hard, and if you relocate you won't know anyone immediately.|`|Lx0pD4Puaa	Yes,risky.

XxUsLqXRaa	I have heard of people doing this, but I don't see how it can be possible without having to go through the whole closing process again.  If your bank loaned you money on one home, you are going to have to involve them to transfer the loan over to the new home.  And they wont do that without all the appraisals, inspections, and so forth.  Is it possible for you to pay the mortgage on both homes until your son is ready to buy?  Or is it possible for him to write you a check every month for the amount of your old home's mortgage until everything is ready for him to officially buy it?  The only other thing I can think of would be for your son to buy the short-sale home, then sell it to you at the same time you sell your home to him.  Obviously, this requires all the closing costs to be repeated.  I would ask the realtor who's handling the short-sale house if a trade like what you want is possible.|`|ikXRqWxUaa	only way that you could do this would be if there were no mortgages involved and you had both homes bought in cash.  w/ mortgages, this is a moot point.  i'm no lawyer, so i'm not the end all be all (and you should get one before you even attempt something like this...business and family is often a bad combo) but i think that the banks involved in both of those mortgages would have a little bit to say about this switcheroo.  they would probably call both loans due.

If not, you should have, that way he could be help in contempt and you could sue him for the monies that he didn't pay.  I would otherwise say that if you don't have an agreement, you need to get one.  If you rent the house out and make any revenue from it, he could come back after you for proceeds from the rental of the house.  After protecting yourself on that end from his possible actions, I'd then go online and find a basic lease and look for the laws in your state regarding being a landlord.  Make sure that the house is in good shape, so that you don't have to sink even more money into making serious repairs.  We used to charge a repair deposit of $50 for everytime that there were repairs needed on the house (other that your simple tasks.)  This kept the tenants from making frivolous requests and made sure that they took care of the property.  Make sure that you include in the lease to the possibility of inspecting the property every quarter, with notice, to check on the property and make sure that upkeep/housekeeping is done like it should, and that you don't have tenants that will tear up your house and then leave you hanging.  These are some of the basics.  I hope that this helps you and gives you somewhere to start.  Good luck!

VHnVBZhVaa	If you are currently in college go to the career services office and ask for their assistance.  If not, ask a trusted friend or relative to give you a little help.  Have them review your resume for errors and do a mock interview with you--answer as you would in a real interview.  This may help you to see if there is a specific problem.  <br>  <br>  Reevaluate your references.  If everything seems to be going fine through the interview someone may be giving you a bad reference.  The people you include do not have to be your direct boss.  You can include a co-worker or supervisor from an activity.<br>  <br>  Finally, have realistic expectations.  If you have been getting turned down for management positions try assistant positions.  If you have been stating you can only work specific hours be more flexible, etc.|`|RqQDKEVHaa	You're doing something wrong. Although the job market's weakening a bit now, unemployment is still just around 6%. That means a lot of employers can't find workers.<br>  <br>  You have had a few jobs, and you've been fired from them. Why? You say, "for some reason they never put me on the schedule again" and with another job "I got fired." Most employers are picking up on whatever the problem is during the first interview.<br>  <br>  You're too close to the problem. Whatever it is, you're not recognizing it.<br>  <br>  Talk to a couple of your close friends. Tell them: "Look. Be absolutely honest with me. You know I've been having some problems finding a job. What do you think I'm doing wrong?"<br>  <br>  Then, keep pushing. Yes, it's a leading question to say, "What do you think I'm doing wrong?" But if you don't, many of your friends will say, "It's not you. You're fine. It's those dumb employers." Suggestion: Guys will be more inclined to answer you honestly, but girls are more likely to pick up on whatever's turning the employers off.<br>  <br>  If that doesn't work, go to your state unemployment office and find out what sort of counseling or testing they have. You need to talk to someone who'll give you honest feedback on your situation.<br>  <br>  Oh, and I answered a similar question a week or so ago here on Yahoo. I gave similar advice. However, I noticed that most of the other answers were along the lines of: "It's a real tough market out there. I can't get hired, either. Join the crowd." Don't settle for that. It isn't that tough out there. Not at 6% unemployment.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

You will be obligated to do as the grant sets out to do.

Also, check with outside sources if your bank is FDIC protected. Many say they are protected by the FED GOV, as they claim.

But then again, there are many scam investors and many of them too are declaring- "Sorry dude, I'm broke, so you'll lose all your money."<br>  <br>  But back to your ques. Keeping it at home would not benefit you- no interest and no insurance. If u lose it, its gone, gone, gone.<br>  <br>  But if it's in the bank, even though you can still lose it all, the chances are much slimmer. Even if the bank should declare bankruptcy, u still have a chance to get back something.<br>  <br>  Now, on your current bank. Change banks sweety. What kind of account do you have (a special account or something?) I know some banks also take out monies from your account when you are below a certain amount. One of the banks I have a little account with does that. (Funny, they should put in money if they see you don't have any. Lol). But, review some other banks and change banks.

First, the lawyer works to make sure that the client does not get railroaded.  Guilty or not, everyone deserves a FAIR trial.  Too often the public and the prosecutors ore overzealous in going after defendants.  The criteria in the US is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.  The prosecution is required to prove that and the lawyer makes sure that they do that.<br>  <br>  Second, if the lawyer knows that a person is guilty, the lawyer is still able to use various defenses.  For example, if the person is guilty of killing someone, a defense is self-defense, that is, the person had to kill to save his own life.<br>  <br>  Third, it may be in the person's best interest for the person to plea bargain.  The court's like this because it reduces their workload and the guilty person likes it because they may get a lesser sentence.  For example, if a person is accused of drug trafficking, and the lawyer knows that is what the person was doing, the lawyer can plea bargain for a lesser offense or a lesser sentence.|`|b6cPtJ6haa	First, if you have a real criminal problem consult with a qualified criminal attorney in your state, do not rely on this post.  If a lawyer knows a client is guilty, he or she cannot put them on the stand and allow them to claim they did not do the crime, so they should not put them on the stand because they will be asked by the prosecution if they did it, that would be perjury and the lawyer would be contributing to that perjury and could get in big trouble, at the same time a lawyer cannot break the attorney/client priviledge or again attorney in big trouble, if a client who has told his lawyer he or she is guilty and insists on testifying, remember a criminal defendant does not have to take the stand and cannot be asked questions by prosecutor, if they do take the stand they get to say their piece and look at the jury and say I did not kill so and so but when they take the stand they the are subject to the prosecution hammering away at them with questions on cross examination, big risk.  So if a lawyer is told his client is guilty by client he can use a ton of defenses, self defense, entrapment, suppression of evidence, plea bargaining, prosecutor did not prove their case guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, lack of evidence, witnesses can be made to look like liars or biased, improper search, tampering of evidence, police corruption/conspiracy and so on.  But if a client says he is guilty and wants to testify he or she did not do it the proper thing to do, lawyer must refuse to go forward and ask the judge to quit the case, without breaking attorney/client priviledge or hurting the clients case, a real ethical dilema.  Now in real life does a client admit to an attorney and the attorney still puts them on the stand, yeah I am sure it happens.  Also, a lawyer would require a blatant, yeah I killed so on so by the client to have the knowledge the client is guilty, a lawyer can think his client is guilty but that is way different than his client telling them he or she did it, a lawyer is not looking to find his client guilty and instead is required to use every legitimate tool, and their are a lot of them to get the best result for the client.<br>  This is not legal advice, and should not be relied on as such.  If you have a criminal legal problem consult with a criminal legal attorney in your state.
25c6db0b521426d9d743c9062c6feee3aa	If I understand correctly, you're wondering what career choices are available to a business major, right?  Well, a huge part of college is figuring out what you want to do with your degree.  As a business major, you'll have a huge variety of classes that touch on different professions.  When you find the one that you like, you'll know it.|`|a64989820fca57f3884bd5859d2b1e41aa	Hey Cess, kudos and affirmation. Great career choice - college, that is. Do what you want - you'll be far more likely to do it and enjoy it. There is always a huge variety of work - that is the nature of the beast called education. Remember HOMEwork - it is designed so you can't get it done easily or at school. Part of the hard work is to weed out the wimps. Part of it is cost effectiveness, if they had to take the time to make it easy, college would take a zillion or so years.<br>  If it is any comfort, when I started my doctorate - I thought dying would be simpler. Each course required a minimum of 3000 pages.<br>  I think I survived though. <br>  Do it girl!|`|438235ea678c3c2a5dd475aa273e295faa	I think you should take something fun! Not all boring!|`|AA11878764	best thing for you to do is to talk to an academic advisor. I'm a college freshman right now, and my major is nursing, but now I'm re-evaluating my decision. My advisor has helped me straighten alot of things out, and also shown me many other options. If you don't have an advisor, just sit down with a counsleor. Sometimes there are career exams that can show you what job may suit you. Also, see if you can find the name of an upperclassmen who currently has the major you're interested in. Emailing and talking back and forth can help ALOT! I've been talking to nursing majors, seeing what their going through, and it's great to get the opinion of people who don't put frosting on when they talk.
VeBSkkYNaa	Do you have a way to find out how much the trips you want to take will cost?  I'm not sure what type of shopping you have in mind, that could make a big difference.  <br>  <br>  If you're just shopping for souvenirs plan a hundred bucks at the most for that (unless you're getting them for lots of people!)  I usually budget about $10 per person shopping for, I usually get things like coffee mugs, key chains, spoons, salt/pepper sets and stuff like that for my friends.  They all have different things they collect.  I always get myself a bell everywhere I go on vacation (that's what I collect).<br>  <br>  Have fun, wish I could get away for a trip like that.

Are you in the US?  If so, and you do not have an agent representing you, I recommend you get an agent to represent you in your transaction.  Typically, the commission is paid through the listing agent to the buyer's agent.  No cost to you.]<br>  <br>  In a typical contingency, the Seller and the Buyer have come to an agreement on price and other terms and have signed the paperwork.  And, they are under contract.  BUT, the actual closing is contingent on *something*.  Typically, that *something* is that the buyer must sell a property they currently own BEFORE buying the new property.<br>  <br>  In most contingency contracts, the Seller may continue to market the property for sale.  If another offer is negotiated, there is a stipulation in the contingency contract that the Buyer must either remove the contingency and close the sale, or terminate the contract and let the new contract go into first place.<br>  <br>  I believe that is why the agent encouraged you to submit an offer.  If you really like the property, there is the chance that you can force the existing contingent offer to terminate and you can move on the sale.<br>  <br>  Get an agent.  Good luck.|`|YwdsP4c2aa	Sold subject to contract has no legal standing. The sale of property is the only sale which requires a written contract and until it is signed either party can walk away or the vendors could accept another offer. So in short that property is not yet sold.

Snubbers are frequently used with an inductive load where the sudden interruption of current flow would lead to a sharp rise in voltage across the device creating the interruption. This sharp rise in voltage might lead to a transient or permanent failure of the controlling device.<br>  <br>  In a similar fashion, a snubber can also be a mechanical device that limits pressure surges on measurement devices. These connect between the process and the measurement device allowing a relatively slow change in of pressure to limit damage to the hardware. Such devices are common in industrial environments.<br>  <br>  Dictionary:  Nautical. <br>  To check the movement of (a rope or cable running out) by turning it quickly about a post or cleat. <br>  To secure (a vessel, for example) in this manner. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.

U3jZFawtaa	First Congratulations!!! Next is to answer your question however there are a few things. Make sure you use credit bureaus to check your credit not a friend at the car dealership or at your bank. Next, how much your credit score goes down depends on your credit score now and the breadth and depth of your credit. If your credit is just a few years old then this new loan will drop your score farther and take longer to come up than if you had credit lines for 10 years and your limits are high and small balances on them. i disagree with the 2 years estimate....it is too long...your credit score will go up in less than 6 months so long as you don't affect it in other ways (running credit checks through the bank of creditor friends of yours, running your credit cards up, canceling or closing lines of credit, collection accounts or tax liens or late payments on your report). So enjoy your new home...dont buy the bigscreen on credit and think about how to work on your home to make it more "YOU" everytime you get the itch to check your credit and by end of summer you'll be happy.|`|wHGYVFIQaa	as with any new loan it will bring your score down, however if you pay your payments on time to your mortgage company and your other creditors it will begin to rise.

You now have a brand-new, high-dollar loan that (as of yet) has no adequate amount of history to it.  And your debt to income ratio has been very much affected.  But not to worry....after about a 2 year history of on-time payments, you're score will really start to go up.  You'll be showing a trustworthy trend and (unless the market gets worse) you'll have some equity built up by then.

Partly because of fear and partly because its difficult to get credit (lending more money exposes banks to more risk). Not getting credit wouldn't be a problem if the consumers and businesses weren't already so far into debt. During the great depression banks actually decided to offer easy credit but everyone was too afraid to take it.<br>  <br>  Other concepts that precipitated the Great Depression and happen to be prevalent in today's economic crisis:<br>  <br>  Hoarding money / Lack of spending / low consumer confidence<br>  <br>  Distressed selling (foreclosures, auctioned property)<br>  <br>  Fall in profits resulting in many businesses filing bankruptcy<br>  <br>  High amount of debt liquidation (personal bankruptcy filings)<br>  <br>  Massive layoffs due to slow economy<br>  <br>  And so on and so on...|`|zuGKIWfNaa	Google "great depression" for answers.

AA10464706	What is the definition of a first-time home buyer?<br>  <br>  The law defines "first-time home buyer" as a buyer who has not owned a principal residence during the three-year period prior to the purchase. For married taxpayers, the law tests the homeownership history of both the home buyer and his/her spouse.<br>  <br>  For example, if you have not owned a home in the past three years but your spouse has owned a principal residence, neither you nor your spouse qualifies for the first-time home buyer tax credit. However, unmarried joint purchasers may allocate the credit amount to any buyer who qualifies as a first-time buyer, such as may occur if a parent jointly purchases a home with a son or daughter. Ownership of a vacation home or rental property not used as a principal residence does not disqualify a buyer as a first-time home buyer.<br>  <br>  You are considered an unmarried joint purchaser.

You are considered a first-time homebuyer if: <br>   <br>  ●You purchased your main home located in the United <br>  States after April 8, 2008, and before December 1, 2009.  <br>   <br>  ●You (and your spouse if married) did not own any other <br>  main home during the 3-year period ending on the date of <br>  purchase.|`|49740c9daeea677fc86801fb2b3f41deaa	You would have to buy it on your own.

RqQDKEVHaa	None.<br>  <br>  If you're purchasing investment real estate, you can use a hard money lender for the short-term financing. In those cases, the loan is made almost entirely on the price-to-value ratio of the property you're buying. For example, if you locate a property worth $100,000 and can buy it today for $50,000, a hard money lender will lend you the $50,000 based on the equity you'll have in the property. The hard money lender will also look at your credit report, but, overall, it's even simpler than stated income. However, that applies only to investment property. And only to investment property where the purchase price is no greater than about 65% of the value.<br>  <br>  But stated income loans? They don't exist.|`|ikXRqWxUaa	sorry to tell you, but almost nobody does stated income loans anymore.  stated income means were popular with self employed or comission based workers.  however, they were also one of the reasons for the current credit crisis.  with the tightening of loan standards, you would be hard pressed to get one of these.|`|wHGYVFIQaa	No one does stated anymore unless you go to a broker who maybe able to help you and that would fall under Alt-A but i really doubt they can help you

VHnVBZhVaa	Law school will teach you a lot of legal fundamentals but they teach you surprisingly few of the nuts and bolts of how to run your own practice.  For this nearly everyone will suggest "How to Start and Build a Law Practice" by Jay G. Foonberg.  It contains a lot of the little details that you will need to consider.  One option would be to scan the book now and see if running your own practice would be appealing to you.<br>  <br>  You college likely has information for aspiring entrepreneurs.  I would suggest taking specific management classes instead of changing your major.  Talk with an advisor about what will really be beneficial.  A management major will also be required to take a lot of courses which won't really help you on this path.  Another idea is to contact the small business association in your area.  They can frequently provide you with a great deal of information on how to go about this.  <br>  <br>  I was a business major in college, went to law school and now run my own business.  All the options you present can provide rewarding career options just pick what interests you the most.

Moving and eviction are two different ball games. If he is evicting you, this might be where the 60 day law takes effect.  Giving you 60 days to find somewhere else to live.  If you are moving, you give 30 days notice.<br>  I would check the state law again, because usually the 60 day rule is for a One year lease, not a month to month.|`|325543522d61fdf739d9d519bc6ab83eaa	A lease is a contract and one of the essential elements of a valid contract is LEGALITY.  Since the state law differs from that which is contained in your lease - the state law is the rule and supersedes the lease provisions.<br>  <br>  A common example of this concept would be a lease in which the tenant waives his homestead exemption or agrees to a "loser pays" arrangement for legal fees in states where the law says you can't do one or the other.<br>  <br>  Even though the notice requirement exceeds the term of the lease, I looked at Delaware L/T law and it is quite specific that even monthly leases require 60 days of notice.  Unless you both agree that 30 days is mutually acceptable, neither of you have legal standing to insist the agreement terminate in 30 days.  In other words, the owner cannot FORCE you to move with a 30 day notice and you cannot move with 30 days of notice if the owner refuses to agree to it - regardless of what the lease says.<br>  <br>  Bottom line:  Just because it's in the lease doesn't mean it's legal, which is why most rental management companies have their leases reviewed periodically by attorneys to ensure they are in keeping with current state, local, and federal law.|`|bafa820adaaa4cf861c7e5853a049cd4aa	usually the state law is rule.

The 1st step is figuring out your monthly budget to live, pay current bills and how much you can afford to send on old collections.  The 2nd step is obtaining all your credit reports.  Highlight any current outstanding credit card and installment lines, then contact them to see about setting up a lower payment for about 6 mo or so.  You'll be amazed by how many companies will do this rather than have you go into complete default.  The 3rd step I would take is to make a list of all collection accounts, their totals, account numbers and addresses.  Send each comany a verification of debt (search the web for it) by certified mail.  If they are unable to verify the account is yours with in 30 days, then they have to remove it from your report.  THIS IS LAW!  If it is verifyable and the goal is to just get on with your life and start over, ask what they would be willing to settle for and make arrangements.  Some companies will even remove the collection completely if you pay as agreed (get this in writing!).  Alot of people will tell you not to settle, but if money is tight you do what you have to get out from under.  Besides, showing settled on a credit report is better than "charged off" or "unpaid".  The so called credit repair companies really are a rip-off, they will do the same thing I advised, only charge you for it.  That is $$ that could have been put towards a bill|`|j0X4DoUXaa	I would not recommend to anyone to go to c credit counseling service. It looks bad on your credit. Mortgage companies look at that as if it was a Chapter 13 Bankruptcy. My best advice is if you own a home and have some equity refinance it and include the debt. It will give you those debts at a lower rate then they are currently at and let you pay them over a longer period of time which would hurt you financially and save you hundreds every month. You can include collections as well. If you do not own a home just pay off each line one at a time. I would recommend getting a copy of your credit report from all three credit bureau's, Trans Union, Equifax, and Experian. Good Luck
fe793b9e1868406561cf076fffdf9733aa	Faulty assumption #1:  believing that collection agencies are actually staffed by human beings.  The people calling you have no souls.  So don't expect to get in touch with somebody there who will actually care that they are in the wrong.<br>  <br>  I would start back with the business office at the hospital.  They are the ones who sold your bill to the collection agency.  Believe me, they have the power to stop the evil collectors.  Mixups like you describe happen all the time at hospitals and physician offices, and it's a pretty fluid line between "active" medical accounts and accounts "in collections".  <br>  <br>  Further, since the hospital was paid by the insurance company for your account, they are responsible to either (1) call off the collection dogs or (2) give the money they got to the collection agency, since they sold the debt to the collection agency.<br>  <br>  If you get no recourse from the hospital, send the collection agency a letter informing them that the bill has been paid and that "according to the Federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act", they must immediately cease and decist trying to collect.  Include a copy of the check in that letter.  Send it certified mail, with return-receipt requested.  If they continue to contact you, contact the state attorney general where you live.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|fa932a29f9feb5128f0983945428c087aa	report the collections agency to your states attorney general's office and notify all three credit reporters that there is a dispute.

The areas you work in if you are limiting these (what neighborhoods, streets, parts of town).  Any promo you may be using (ex. first time 20% off, referral discount).

You will be able to provide customer service by answering directional questions (where is ...), being friendly, responding quickly and efficiently to clean-up needs even if it differs from your planned routine and maintaining a clean and sanitary environment which ensures a more pleasant stay for patients and visitors.
VHnVBZhVaa	What about "If money were no object where would you travel and what would you hope to do once you were there?".  If it is supposed to be more of a ranking survey pick a list of places and ask people from that list which they would like to travel to in order.
VHnVBZhVaa	Hmm, something sounds wrong here.  I suppose it would be possible for the school to make a clerical letter and send someone both letters.  However, it would never occur that a school would accept someone and then transfer them to alternate status.  If it admitted someone it may rescind the admission if conditions occurred (prerequisites were not met, conduct occurred, etc).  If the school had simply made an error I would assume that they would admit her anyways because she was led to believe that she had been accepted and may have relied on that information by not applying to other programs.  I just can't understand how she didn't get fired once it was discovered she was not the licensed nurse she once claimed to be.
VHnVBZhVaa	I have several family members who are pilots.  Your questions really depend on several factors.  First, are you working for an airline or for a corporate employer or fro a delivery service (DHL, UPS), or for the airforce/other military.  I am not personally familiar with military flight assignments and schedules.  <br>  <br>  Corporate pilots tend to have the most stable schedules.  They will generally know in advance what flights will be flown and what the schedule will look like in advance.  This can change with unexpected meetings, etc but is generally preplanned.  The number of days away per month will depend on the employer.  Some corporate pilots earn higher salaries and have fewer overnight trips than their commercial counterparts.<br>  <br>  Commercial pilots generally begin by flying on reserve status.  Reserve pilots are paid for a pre-set number of hours each week regardless of how many hours they actually fly. For example if you are to be paid for 40 hours a week you will earn the same salary if you fly 0 hours or if you fly 40.  While on reserve pilots are typically on-call 24 hours a day and often do not receive advance schedules.  There are standards by airline regarding days off and vacation days in this period.  Reserve time varies but can last between a few months and a few years.<br>  <br>  Once off reserve status a commercial pilot will be able to bid for the flights he/she wants to take.  Flights are assigned by seniority so newer pilots may not receive their first choices.  At this point schedules are typically known in advance but a pilot may still encounter periods of on-call status.  Again, the specifics depend on which airline you are working for.
