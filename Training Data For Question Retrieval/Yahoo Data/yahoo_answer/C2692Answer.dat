My suggestion would be to to keep a few of each species so they have mates of their own to hang out with and barbs specifically like to hang out in schools so at least four or five would be my suggestion  Then just watch them and hope that they don't pick on the Betta's fins too much.

Dxrnvvjbaa	Yes, you should get another hamster! Its good to have a pet around. Or try something different, like a guinea pig, chinchilla, or a pet you haven't ever had. <br>  <br>  What kind of hamster was he? <br>  <br>  Syrian: 2-4 Years<br>  Dwarf: 1-3 Years<br>  So he probably was getting old.

Its never easy to lose a pet, even one that small!  <br>  <br>  I personally need to fill the void of losing a pet.  However, it depends if you're ready.

And DO NOT "spice up her meal".  Her system is not ready for that.|`|gwUMipsUaa	I would say screw morning and take her to the vet now.|`|7HxJvbjMaa	DON'T spice up her food with treats, she's only 2 weeks old... my goodness.<br>  You really need the advice of a vet to help an animal this young survive. And I see that you are doing just that. Puppies this young are still on mothers milk. I wonder if there is any way you could get her a foster mom and stick her in with a litter of nursing pups for a while. Could you call some local dog breeders in your area?|`|VYyi3EKVaa	Definitly take her to the vet..Possibly PARVO or the change of the milk.

My dog only needed one tooth pulled so it wasn't too bad.<br>  If your pet hasn't been neutered yet you might want to combine it all because the anesthesia is the most expensive part.|`|PM23RDycaa	Call your regular vet and see what they charge.Then call around to other vets and see what THEY charge.

It shouldn't cost much if you have them removed at the time of spay/neuter.  I think we charge an extra $25.  If your pet is already been altered, or you aren't having it altered (although you should because retained teeth isn't a good trait to breed) you would have to pay for anesthesia as well.<br>  <br>  They probably aren't hurting your dog, but they will later on.  The extra teeth are creating a nice spot for debris to get trapped and bacteria to grow.  If you don't have the baby ones removed early, your dog will end up loosing the permanent teeth due to premature periodontal disease!|`|BDRIeLqUaa	the are called retained canines- depending on how old your puppy is- it is cheaper to remove them when the pet is fixed|`|VmLZFN4Taa	I wouldn't remove them unless they were hurting the dog, I am sure you could call your vet and get an estimate.|`|1NPVVxW0aa	If it's not hurting your dog then there's no reason to remove them?|`|0iAWEoVbaa	my pointer puppy had two fangs on each side.

ObY7YqZtaa	Well since you can't go anywhere. you should separate the aggressive fish with the two other neon's or else there is a good chance the new ones should die. You should put the neon's in a bowl and just feed them regularly. Im not sure wat to do with the aggressive one. Good Luck.|`|Nzb5QmNXaa	First, what kind of fish is the larger one?<br>  <br>  You really should have researched your fish first.<br>  <br>  Second, neons are schooling fish and you really should have 6 or more. They also cannot live in a jar. No fish can thrive in a jar. In addition, they are very sensitive to water conditions and will quickly die if the water isn't perfect. One gallons isn't big enough to be a permenant home. They need a filter and a heater.<br>  <br>  You need to return the larger fish. Get more neons, at least four.<br>  <br>  If you have a 10 gallon or bigger, then you can get a few more fish such as guppies, mollies, platies. These guys don't require being in schools (though they like it better). If you have anything less than a 10 gallon tank, then 6 neons will be your limit|`|TvJP4pVxaa	I would just put the 2 little fish in a different thing that way they can live but..some fish eat othe fish. I had a tank once with 1 killer fish in it meaning that he/she ate other fish and is all I did was got my tank divided in half with another glass piece and the mean fish was always trying to find away to the other side|`|AsUTBGW0aa	Take them back|`|ykcpQhWzaa	ya take them back|`|81baef74a4e6c7179e0d8495997ac4a5aa	Hi I work in a pet store that does a good fish business. You do not say what type of fish the new one is or the size of your tank. These two things are very helpful in figuring out if your fish is compatible or if the tank is large enough for a 2.5 inch fish plus three others. The neon's will not survive in a jar. Try taking the fish back. If they will let you return it you need to let them know what type of fish you have and the size of your tank and how many fish you have in it now. Ask them for suggestions of what would be best for your tank based on the information you have given them on your aquarium. Small independent pet stores are usually the best to deal with as they are usually more knowledgeable and depend on your return business and will go out of there way to help you. I wish you luck with your fish and hope that I have helped you.|`|yE2vM76naa	Well, you can try to take the bigger one back...explain and most places are cool about it...<br>  <br>  Or you can try to put in hiding places like plants and submersed drinking glasses, flower pots, etc.<br>  <br>  Those are your best bets - fish can't live in jars, especially neons.|`|AA11708471	that wasn't a smart thing to do was it.<br>  Do you not understand that you need to do research before you buy pets. you are going to have to sell one of the fish. if you sell the new fish the neons need atleast a 10 gallon and a minimum school of 6. If you sell the neons you will need to find out what sort of fish the new one is and do some PROPER RESEARCH on it.|`|2Jmodoaeaa	If you cannot afford a 2.5 gallon tank with a heater and filter (VERY cheap at wal-mart) to put either the bigger fish or the neon's into, then I would suggest taking either the neon's or the bigger fish back to the store, it's your choice which. Do you know what the bigger fish is? Because that would help us determine their compatibility. Do not put the neon's in anything that does not have a filter, heater, and at least 2 gallons of water. They still need a proper environment. <br>  <br>  Good Luck, and Happy Fish-Keeping!<br>  ~Taylor~<br>  <br>  ( \_/)<br>  (0.o)<br>  (><)|`|qNVP4Q1Saa	I would need to know what kind of a fish the 2.5" one is.  Neon's are targets for larger fish especially with their colors, guppies are even more sought after. Make sure to feed the fish twice a day as much as they can eat in five minutes.  if you can only fee them once they all need to be the same size within reason.|`|39a2d5e9bc3c417cbdc5ba33cb6386bbaa	You didn't really think that out well huh?  You really have to research before you get any sort of animal, even fish.  Neons are schooling fish and need a minimum of 5 or 6 to be happy.  Try to return the bigger fish to the store or give it to someone who can take care of it.|`|bDPVRtCNaa	Divide the tank. Somehow isolate the larger fish from the neons.<br>  <br>  Neons cannot be housed in a jar because of how sensitive they are to lower temperatures and poor water quality.
uBFhKXgHaa	Fancy Feast is crap. Anything by Purina or Iams is also crap. I sure hope you'll rethink switching your kitty to an all wet diet, since dry food is really quite unhealthy for cats.<br>  <br>  Not all pet food is made equally. A lot of it is full of corn, by-products, dyes, unhealthy preservatives, filler grains and all sorts of nasty stuff. A lot of pet food companies are perfectly happy to the dump cheap leftovers and things that aren't safe for human consumption (from human food processing plants) into their foods. Will it kill your cat? No, it has to be nutritionally complete and safe to even be marketed. Is it healthy? Not by a long shot.<br>  <br>  Corn is a low quality ingredient you never want to see in your pet food. Corn and low quality grains are two of the biggest culprits when it comes to food allergies in our pets.<br>  <br>  Thankfully, there are some excellent cat foods being made these days that include organic, human grade ingredients rather than trash not fit for human consumption.<br>  <br>  Examples of low quality foods to avoid: Anything you can find in a grocery store will be low end, Purina, Iams, Eukanuba, Science Diet, Royal Canin, Whiskas, Fancy Feast, Friskies, Meow Mix.<br>  <br>  Examples of high quality foods to look for: Innova, Wellness, Solid Gold, Felidae, Fromm Four Star, Merrick, GO Natural, Nature's Variety Prairie, Nature's Logic, Artemis Fresh Mix, Timber Wolf Organics.<br>  <br>  Although the high quality foods are more expensive, you're getting what you're paying for. Less filler material and higher quality ingredients means more concentrated nutrients... this means you typically need to feed far less of the high quality food than you would of the low quality one. Which also means less poop!<br>  <br>  Seriously on a budget? Two of the most affordable of the higher quality foods would be Chicken Soup for the Cat Lover's Soul and Felidae.<br>  <br>  Before following your vet's food recommendation, keep in mind that vets get /very/ little nutritional training during their schooling. Besides that, what training they /do/ get is usually sponsored or taught by... you guessed it, the crappy pet food companies! They also often get kickbacks from the companies for pushing these products at their clinics (Science Diet, Royal Canin etc.)<br>  <br>  A great option is to go with an entirely grain-free diet. Diets high in grain/carbohydrates have been attributed to problems with diabetes in cats. Cats are obligate carnivores, so why should there be grain in their diet? Many of the high quality foods now put out grain-free formulas. Some good grain-free diets include: Innova EVO, Wellness CORE, Blue Wilderness, Nature's Variety Instinct, Orijen, Horizon Legacy, Fromm Surf & Turf, Now!, GO Natural Grain Free, Sold Gold Indigo Moon, Ziwipeak, and Taste of the Wild.<br>  <br>  Some pretty decent foods can even be found in common pet stores. Petsmart carries Blue Buffalo products (such as the excellent grain free diet Blue Wilderness). Petco carries Wellness, Solid Gold, Natural Balance, Eagle Pack Holistic Select, Blue Buffalo, Castor & Pollux Organix, Pinnacle, and Halo. <br>  <br>  If you can't find a food, most of the high quality cat food brands have websites with store locators on them that will help you find the store closest to you which supplies their products. Simply type the cat food brand's name into Google, go to their website, and type your zip code into their store locator.<br>  <br>  Another option, if you can't find anywhere around you that sells good foods, is to order your pet food online. Here's an excellent place to do so: <a href="http://www.petfooddirect.com/store/" rel="nofollow">http://www.petfooddirect.com/store/</a><br>  <br>  Remember that foods should be switched gradually (mixing the new slowly in with the old over the period of about week or so), especially when switching to a higher quality one, so as not to upset tummies. For example:<br>  Days 1 & 2: 75% old food, 25% new food<br>  Days 3 & 4: 50% old food, 50% new food<br>  Days 5 & 6: 25% old food, 75% new food<br>  Day 7: 0% old food, 100% new food<br>  <br>  Another option for feeding cats is to feed raw. This is something that should be thoroughly researched before being attempted:<br>  <a href="http://www.rawfedcats.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.rawfedcats.org/</a> (Raw Fed Cats)<br>  <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/rawdogs/profile/" rel="nofollow">http://community.livejournal.com/rawdogs...</a> (Raw Dogs Livejournal Community [not just for dogs despite the name!], excellent raw feeding information on the profile page and overall helpful community for raw feeding questions)<br>  <a href="http://www.rawfed.com/myths/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.rawfed.com/myths/index.html</a> (Myths About Raw Feeding)<br>  <br>  <br>  Now the question is, do you feed wet or dry? Wet is the correct answer. The reason is, in the wild, cats normally get most of their water content directly from their prey items and drink very little. Domestic cats are no different, and because of the fact that they are designed to take in water with their meal, they have a very low thirst drive. Cats often just don't drink enough. This leads to urinary tract infections and crystals. The bit about dry food being better for teeth is a myth and has not been proven in the least (cats barely even chew their dry food and, really, does a pretzel clean /your/ teeth? Cats should have their teeth brushed with cat toothbrushes and cat toothpaste at least a few times a week as well as see the vet for dental cleanings when necessary /regardless/ of what they are being fed). Canned/wet food is better because it more closely mimics the cat's natural diet. More on why canned food is best:<br>  <a href="http://www.catinfo.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.catinfo.org/</a>  (Excellent cat nutrition information by a vet)<br>  <a href="http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?action=library&act=show&item=whycatsneedcannedfood" rel="nofollow">http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?ac...</a> (Why Cats Need Canned Food)<br>  <a href="http://cats.about.com/cs/catfood/a/canned_food.htm" rel="nofollow">http://cats.about.com/cs/catfood/a/canne...</a> (Canned Cat Food: Can Your Cat Afford to Live Without it?)<br>  <a href="http://www.felinefuture.com/nutrition/bpo_ch4.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.felinefuture.com/nutrition/bp...</a> (The Dry Food Crisis)<br>  <a href="http://maxshouse.com/feline_nutrition.htm" rel="nofollow">http://maxshouse.com/feline_nutrition.ht...</a> (Max's House: Feline Nutrition)<br>  <br>  Another option to get cats to drink more would be a cat fountain. Cats tend to like to drink from running water and cat fountains see to that need, encouraging cats to take in more water.<br>  <br>  Also remember that freefeeding (leaving food down) is the fast lane to feline obesity. Make sure to have scheduled feeding times loosely based on the feeding guidelines on your cat's food. Adult cats are typically fed two meals a day.<br>  <br>  More:<br>  <a href="http://www.dogfoodanalysis.com/dog_food_reviews/" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogfoodanalysis.com/dog_food_...</a> (Dog food reviews.

It contains 50% meat protein and zero grain.  Yes, it costs more than the garbage foods but since it's so nutrient-dense your cat will eat less of it.  Your cat will also utilize more of the ingredients so you end up with smaller poops - less scooping and less litter changing.  You won't find it at Petco or PetSmart.  Not sure why but they don't carry many healthy foods.  Most of it's the same crap you can buy at grocery stores or WalMart.  You can find stores near you that carry Evo by going to their site - <a href="http://www.naturapet.com/where-to-buy/" rel="nofollow">http://www.naturapet.com/where-to-buy/</a><br>  <br>  Blue Buffalo Wilderness is another good food.  It's 45% meat protein and also grain free.  They do carry Blue Buffalo at PetSmart.<br>  <br>  Petrina Go! Natural is one that mine have been eating lately and they love it - especially the Chicken/Turkey/Duck.  It contains 50% meat protein and no grain.

Its a dry pellet cat food and it has no fillers or grains,which bother most cats.  Its considered the closest thing to a raw food diet without actually being raw as its real meat that has been freeze dried fresh.   I buy the chicken and rice..... and my cats are in amazing shape...even the sick one who has heart disease... he looks great.  Its more expensive but they eat a lot less because its so pure... fancy feast is garbabe.. Iams is garbage... grocery mart or walmart food is bad... its all cheap and full of crap your cats cant digest well.  Once you start your cat on EVO... you will be amazed at how well she does... it will take a few weeks but eventually you will notice less stinky litter box.... firmer stools.... and a happier cat as her tummy wont be so upset.<br>  <br>  good luck with this.<br>  <br>  added:  You will have to go to a specialty pet (not just cat sorry) food store for this food... there is canned as well... I do give that to my boy to give him his medicine and you would be surprised at how good it looks.... it is not stinky either..... <br>  <br>  Any cat food that is made without grain and fillers is a better cat food, I am telling you about EVO because I use it.. but if you go to one of those speciality stores they will be able to educate you about all the foods ... and might be able to give you a less expensive one but a healthy one.|`|OauZKhKVaa	My kitten was recently diagnosed with FeLV, so we decided to switch him to the healthiest food possible. We're feeding both of our kitties this stuff called CORE, made my Wellness brand. It's grain-free and high in protein, with no by-products. I'm also concerned about animal testing, and from the research I've done this brand seems alright. It is expensive, but since switching to this food our cats have been eating less than before, but they seem much happier and healthier. Grain-free food is supposed to be way more filling and nutritious. Our 2 cats eat two 5lb bags of food a month at about $25 a bag.|`|SLSX6QQsaa	The reason you are having issues with your cat is because the foods you are picking have mostly fillers.  I give my cats Iams Lamb and rice for digestive care only because one of my kitties has a very sensitive tummy and throws up any other brand even if its lamb and rice.  Also the original formula is equally as good, also lamb and rice.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.iams.com/iams/premium-pet-food/dry-cat-food.jsp" rel="nofollow">http://www.iams.com/iams/premium-pet-foo...</a><br>  <br>  My cat was throwing up every other day at least and now doesn't throw up at all.  I really believe in this food even if it has by products or some corn in it which some people are bothered by.  It works for my cat, and she is the pickiest cat I know.  And it's not much more expensive than your cheaper brands, maybe a couple dollars thats it.  Go to Kroger, Meijer, or Target and shop around.  Usually one of them is having a sale on it.|`|h9ZQjnANaa	It's difficult to tell which food is best..

It will cost alittle more but it's worth while, because your little friend will be happy, healthy and will consume less also.  <br>  <br>  For upset stomachs and strange stools.

Cats need meat the most because they are <br>  naturally carnivores. This food's label lists meat as the first ingredient witch is good because then it means that its the most used ingredient in the food. You should avoid commercial brands like: Whiskas, IAMS, Purina,ETC.. <br>  As these foods usually have TONS of fillers, And very little meat. <br>  <br>  Before i found this food, i also tried avoiding IAMs because of their cruel practices. I orginally wanted Wellness but my cat hated it. But loved Nutro. Nutro does not do cruel tests on animals, as indicated on the bag.<br>  <br>  If you are wondering where to get Nutro it is available in speciality pet supply stores. Or you can just go to their website.

Well first, they are usually very unhealthy and poorly bred. The puppy mills do not produce for the quality of the dogs but rather for the quantity of the puppy's. Parents are locked up in cages, in their own fecal matter being forced to breed litter after litter after litter, no human contact, no love...sometimes starved...and they are very much neglected and abused.<br>  <br>  These dogs are inbred somewhere down the line, which will most likely cause health problems in the puppy's.<br>  Purchasing your puppy from a pet store is supporting these terrible breeding facilities....(aka..hell for the dogs)<br>  <br>  Do you really want to contribute to and support these facilities??<br>  please look at this video<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0KucYppXO0" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0KucYppX...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HM8UmHM8Uo&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HM8UmHM8...</a><br>  <br>  Please consider adoption, there are so many innocent dogs getting put to sleep everyday.

2qgg2G8kaa	I feed all of my snakes, except one, F/T. When you defrost the mouse, make sure the water is very warm. Put the pinkie in for about 10-15 minutes. If its not that warm you should leave it in longer. I've been doing this for 2-3 years so I know how it all goes. Microwaving a mouse/rat will explode it. It's best to do what I typed. I feed my corn snake pinkie mice as well.|`|b88691c1425e641c73274dcb27f8a891aa	The fact that your corn snake is not eating may not be because the pinkie is "not warm enough". I own corn snakes myself and I have learned that a corn snake generally does not care what the temperature of the food item is. I have fed my snakes mice that range from temps of just been out of hot water, to room temp and they ate it just fine.<br>  <br>  You might want to consider other options to feed your corn snake if it is not eating. Trying to feed it live pinkies is an option you can look into, or you can try scenting the pinkie in other foods, such as tuna, or chicken, or lizard.<br>  <br>  If you have tried all that you can and your corn snake STILL doesn't eat, there may be a more serious problem than just your pinkie not being "warm enough". Knowing the background of the snake helps to determine the problem feeder. It could be anything from being too stressed to eat, or your snake may have parasites. <br>  <br>  Good luck with your snake. I hope it eats for you.|`|x5tOxNz9aa	I have a ball python, they are pretty picky eaters. A trick I do is. Thaw your pinky mouse in chicken broth. I do it for my ball python, i don't know if the corn snae will like it though, i never knew a corn snake who didn't eat though. they eat everything|`|GOypfDoqaa	Warm water.|`|sSJ8zfebaa	i allow them to thaw out and then put them in a plastic baggy and put them in hot water to warm.works great for me-have 16 snakes|`|n6ffS63Maa	If you're thawing in out a hot water it should be warm enough.  Maybe try a fresh bowl of hot water after it had been thawed and also putting it up against a light for a few moments; any light bulb will do, they all burn pretty hot.  Have you had it very long, it may just need to adjust to its environment.  Are the cage temps ok?  If everything is fine and after a month it still isn't feeding you may have a bigger problem on your hands.  And there are some snakes, albeit not very many, but they just won't take f/t only live.  Another note, you can reuse the thawed pinkie but only refreeze once.  After the second thaw the cell membranes really start to break down and things can get really messy if you try for a third.|`|zzzd9tC4aa	Yeah heating the pinky in hot water is the best way. Once it's thawed you can put it on a heat mat to keep it warm and dry. Another way to get your snake interested is to wiggle the mouse with your tweezers, rather than just plonking it in the cage. This will stimulate the instinct to strike and constrict. After a while the snake will release its tight grip and start to eat the pinky.  <br>           All snakes can go without food for a long time- some up to a year. so a snake that won't eat isn't uncommon. Each week try to feed your snake, but don't force it. It will eat when the time is right.|`|d221b731895f9a90fd40fb8cfc14f465aa	Put it in the oven?<br>  Rub it with your hands? (hahaha kidding)<br>  Put it out in the blazing hott sun!<br>  Put it near the snake's heat lamp (that's if he has one)<br>  or do as they say not to do and stick it in the microwave|`|5WgtYPv9aa	Put the pinkies in a mug or very hot water and leave i there for about 10min then try feeding it to the snake.
M3WK5lmjaa	That should be a good combo. You will have a very active tank. Although its possible for cory to grow 3-4 inches, they might not. I have had a cory catfish for over a year and it has yet to grow past 2 inches. However, if your do grow to 3-4 inches, the ten gallon will get a little crowded. I would then upgrade to a 20 gallon. But until then, it should be good. As for when to put the corys in, I would either put them all in at the end of the cycling, or, like the others said, put in one a week until there all in.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!!|`|rdldRBsYaa	put one cory one by one each week untill the sixth week where you can put the 6th cory in and your betta.|`|IQqkPEXIaa	take the betta out now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...<br>  the other fish will probally die|`|ZwjYKWrqaa	ID only put 3 corys in there with the betta. They usually need 30 gal+ anyway...|`|JGEvYUMeaa	cory cats are a great aspect to an aquarium and are fun to watch but they grow to be 2-3 inches each and 6 would be a little to much for that aquarium i would suggest 3 maybe four of them and a betta would be great with them a betta stays on the middle to top part of the tank usually and the Corie's lower to middle so they wont interact with each other much and they are both peaceful species to other peaceful species so i would recommend one betta of your choice and 3-4 corydories. <br>  <br>  Good luck with your fish tank.<br>  <br>  p.s allow the tank to cycle for maybe a week or two and then add the fish. :)
lZiBRhGyaa	give her treats by hand or just some of her food , talk to her in a calm voice, be extremely slow.<br>  <br>  ikno this sounds pretty mean but it tamed my hamster in less then a day, i taped my fingers so when he tried to bight my i wouldn't bleed and i sort of cornered it so it would have to get on my hand i brought it out of the cage and put it close to my sweatshirt so it knew it was safe. i had to do this so i could clean its cage. my hamster is super nice now and it trusts me sooo try that if the treats dont work.|`|kJZtiS8Kaa	Use gloves for awhile and handle her for at least 30mins a day. This will gradually get her used to being handled. If its a recent change, she may be ill in which case I would suggest a Vet Health Check.
f1gmEmUTaa	No, you cannot tell if your snake is a male or female by the spurs. The only reliable way to determine your snakes gender is to have it probed. A professional (and I stress that because you can cause injury if you attempt it yourself) inserts a sterile lubricated instrument into your snakes vent. Gender is determined by how far it goes in. It will generally go further in males than in females . Another method is what you mentioned. Popping is the process of putting gentle pressure near the vents and sometimes on males, the hemipenes will invert or "pop" (outwards and visible to the eye, not pop in the busted sense). Again though, that's a technique for a professional. <br>  Honestly though, if you never plan to breed your snake, then it isn't really important to know your snakes gender unless you're just a stickler for accuracy (like me haha). Males and females are identical in care and feeding.<br>  <br>  Good luck and congratulations on your pet, balls are wonderful animals and will give you many years of enjoyment.|`|8i90ov0Gaa	It is not true that only males have spurs, nor is it true you can tell the sex by looking at the spurs, not accurately anyway. I promise you a 16 foot female Burmese python will have some large spurs. For a snake the age of yours, probing is the only way to tell (popping is done for hatchlings). Both popping and probing should only be done by someone with exprience to avoid hurting the snake.|`|GOypfDoqaa	Your boa has no spurs because it is a female and as for the python, it is problbly a male and you can go to petco to get a better idea on what he or she is. Hope I helped.

uBFhKXgHaa	Simple, feed them in separate rooms. They just need to be fed separately. But, honestly, if you are feeding a high quality cat food... that isn't even necessary. Kitten food is nothing but a marketing gimmick. Do you see lion cubs eating kitten food? Nope, they go straight onto what their parents are eating after they're weaned! If it's a high quality adult cat food, it'll work just as well for kittens.<br>  <br>  Science Diet is /crap/. It's definitely not a high quality cat food, and vets definitely aren't the people to go to for pet nutrition advice. I'd look into a higher quality cat food for your kitties.<br>  <br>  Not all pet food is made equally. A lot of it is full of corn, by-products, dyes, unhealthy preservatives, filler grains and all sorts of nasty stuff. A lot of pet food companies are perfectly happy to the dump cheap leftovers and things that aren't safe for human consumption (from human food processing plants) into their foods. Will it kill your cat? No, it has to be nutritionally complete and safe to even be marketed. Is it healthy? Not by a long shot.<br>  <br>  Corn is a low quality ingredient you never want to see in your pet food. Corn and low quality grains are two of the biggest culprits when it comes to food allergies in our pets.<br>  <br>  Thankfully, there are some excellent cat foods being made these days that include organic, human grade ingredients rather than trash not fit for human consumption.<br>  <br>  Examples of low quality foods to avoid: Anything you can find in a grocery store will be low end, Purina, Iams, Eukanuba, Science Diet, Royal Canin, Whiskas, Fancy Feast, Friskies, Meow Mix.<br>  <br>  Examples of high quality foods to look for: Innova, Wellness, Solid Gold, Felidae, Fromm Four Star, Merrick, GO Natural, Nature's Variety Prairie, Nature's Logic, Artemis Fresh Mix, Timber Wolf Organics.<br>  <br>  Although the high quality foods are more expensive, you're getting what you're paying for. Less filler material and higher quality ingredients means more concentrated nutrients... this means you typically need to feed far less of the high quality food than you would of the low quality one. Which also means less poop!<br>  <br>  Seriously on a budget? Two of the most affordable of the higher quality foods would be Chicken Soup for the Cat Lover's Soul and Felidae.<br>  <br>  Before following your vet's food recommendation, keep in mind that vets get /very/ little nutritional training during their schooling. Besides that, what training they /do/ get is usually sponsored or taught by... you guessed it, the crappy pet food companies! They also often get kickbacks from the companies for pushing these products at their clinics (Science Diet, Royal Canin etc.)<br>  <br>  A great option is to go with an entirely grain-free diet. Diets high in grain/carbohydrates have been attributed to problems with diabetes in cats. Cats are obligate carnivores, so why should there be grain in their diet? Many of the high quality foods now put out grain-free formulas. Some good grain-free diets include: Innova EVO, Wellness CORE, Blue Wilderness, Nature's Variety Instinct, Orijen, Horizon Legacy, Fromm Surf & Turf, Now!, GO Natural Grain Free, Sold Gold Indigo Moon, Ziwipeak, and Taste of the Wild.<br>  <br>  Some pretty decent foods can even be found in common pet stores. Petsmart carries Blue Buffalo products (such as the excellent grain free diet Blue Wilderness). Petco carries Wellness, Solid Gold, Natural Balance, Eagle Pack Holistic Select, Blue Buffalo, Castor & Pollux Organix, Pinnacle, and Halo. <br>  <br>  If you can't find a food, most of the high quality cat food brands have websites with store locators on them that will help you find the store closest to you which supplies their products. Simply type the cat food brand's name into Google, go to their website, and type your zip code into their store locator.<br>  <br>  Another option, if you can't find anywhere around you that sells good foods, is to order your pet food online. Here's an excellent place to do so: <a href="http://www.petfooddirect.com/store/" rel="nofollow">http://www.petfooddirect.com/store/</a><br>  <br>  Remember that foods should be switched gradually (mixing the new slowly in with the old over the period of about week or so), especially when switching to a higher quality one, so as not to upset tummies. For example:<br>  Days 1 & 2: 75% old food, 25% new food<br>  Days 3 & 4: 50% old food, 50% new food<br>  Days 5 & 6: 25% old food, 75% new food<br>  Day 7: 0% old food, 100% new food<br>  <br>  Another option for feeding cats is to feed raw. This is something that should be thoroughly researched before being attempted:<br>  <a href="http://www.rawfedcats.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.rawfedcats.org/</a> (Raw Fed Cats)<br>  <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/rawdogs/profile/" rel="nofollow">http://community.livejournal.com/rawdogs...</a> (Raw Dogs Livejournal Community [not just for dogs despite the name!], excellent raw feeding information on the profile page and overall helpful community for raw feeding questions)<br>  <a href="http://www.rawfed.com/myths/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.rawfed.com/myths/index.html</a> (Myths About Raw Feeding)<br>  <br>  Now the question is, do you feed wet or dry? Wet is the correct answer. The reason is, in the wild, cats normally get most of their water content directly from their prey items and drink very little. Domestic cats are no different, and because of the fact that they are designed to take in water with their meal, they have a very low thirst drive. Cats often just don't drink enough. This leads to urinary tract infections and crystals. The bit about dry food being better for teeth is a myth and has not been proven in the least (cats barely even chew their dry food and, really, does a pretzel clean /your/ teeth? Cats should have their teeth brushed with cat toothbrushes and cat toothpaste at least a few times a week as well as see the vet for dental cleanings when necessary /regardless/ of what they are being fed). Canned/wet food is better because it more closely mimics the cat's natural diet.

Cats tend to like to drink from running water and cat fountains see to that need, encouraging cats to take in more water.<br>  <br>  Also remember that freefeeding (leaving food down) is the fast lane to feline obesity. Make sure to have scheduled feeding times loosely based on the feeding guidelines on your cat's food. Adult cats are typically fed two meals a day.<br>  <br>  More:<br>  <a href="http://www.dogfoodanalysis.com/dog_food_reviews/" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogfoodanalysis.com/dog_food_...</a> (Dog food reviews.

If its a high quality food then it works the same for kittens and adults.|`|jsdDgIuRaa	You can't really unless you separate them in rooms and shut the door.<br>  <br>  I have 3 cats and got them at different ages, I just got good quality food and gave it to them all and they are all perfectly healthy.<br>  <br>  5 months is old enough for regular adult food if it's the healthy stuff.|`|4a4b9be516eeab81005bf8f97c61e37aaa	The kitten can eat adult cat food - especially quality canned meat which is good for your older cat too.<br>  <br>  Use Wellness, Natural Balance, Instincts, Avoderm, etc.|`|O0lb4Kcnaa	I would feed one cat at a time while keeping the other away.  OR feed them in 2 different rooms.
AA10270018	It must of blow a fuse in your air pump. Open it up to see if you can fix it.|`|ImC4V2hcaa	u need to put water in the top, were all the filters are!|`|qJlZjzjWaa	prime it by putting a cup of your tanks water into where the water comes up|`|MPQI8Bg3aa	I have the same problem with my eclipse filter. If you take the pump off its mount and hold it down at the bottom of the tank for a couple of seconds it should start pumping water. Put the pump back on the mount and it will be fine. If this doesn't work then the outage could have caused a short in the pump.|`|Yztrofywaa	Yeah, It may not have any water in it. Enough water probably drained out in the 3-5 seconds to kill the siphon that pulls the water up. When you turn the filter back on, pour a bit of water into it.|`|O0lb4Kcnaa	fill water to it.  When the electricity went out it pumped out the last bit of water.  It doesn't have anything in there to pump out anymore.|`|c3840c1b3cdff08ff6f4de99512ac75aaa	do you fill it up with water? you make sure there is no air.<br>  <br>  its possible the fan in the pump could just be stuck b/c of some stuff. All you have to do is touch it.
YnCUyvK7aa	Neither, really.  The brine shrimp are easy enough to hatch, but if you need adult brine shrimp to feed your fish, it takes some work and space to get them to grow to a large enough size and have enough for regular feedings. Plus, adult shrimp aren't very nutritious for your fish, you have to feed them spirulina or other enriched foods well before you feed them to your fish to give them any nutrition.<br>  <br>  Bloodworms are easy enough to raise if you find live worms, but these usually come from polluted water [they're often found living in pure sewage].  But the adult is a flying insect like a mosquito, so once they metamorphose, you'd have to find new worms, they won't reliably lay eggs back in your tank.<br>  <br>  If you're looking for a live food you can raise and keep going year round, do a little research on blackworms.  I have colonies going in several of my tanks, and I harvest some each time I do a water cahnge.  Starters of about an ounce are around $4 and contain hundreds.<br>  <br>  The other alternative is to just buy frozen brine shrimp or bloodworms.  While this might be a little more expensive, it's a lot more convenient.|`|tShDXmgbaa	both if you can get them in freeze dried form.  Otherwise...both are a hassle trying to maintain live.
G0KKfXMUaa	A lease is supposed to be when the leaser pays 10 percent of the horse's worth per year (divided up into twelve months).<br>  <br>  However, it's normally a set fee varying from 250 to 350, depending on the barn.<br>  <br>  As the leaser, you do not pay vet bills, farrier bills, etc. All you do is pay your set fee that you and the owner agreed on.<br>  <br>  <br>  I think 275 is a good price, depending on the horse. Is she or he well trained? Find this out before leasing, or have a trainer evaluate the horse to see if she or he is well suited for your level of experience.<br>  <br>  Oh, but you do need to find out whether it is a full or a partial lease.<br>  <br>  Full lease means you can normally ride from four to six times a week (depending on you and the owner's agreement). However with a partial lease, you do not get to ride as often during the week.<br>  <br>  Good luck =)|`|5ee2106949bcd1e92ad6150f154711eaaa	I couldn't give you a price. but i belive it all depends on a full lease or a half lease. and the owner. I do not belive that inculdes vet/ferrier because its still the owners horse. but truthfully, ask the owner he/she will know better then us haha. i hope that you'll be able to buy one of your own, thats the best:]|`|1a66e55f2184fe6adca74fb4a9e4fd8caa	You would have to ask the owner- most leases include the board, normal vet fees, and farrier. The 275 should be all that you have to pay a month. Make sure you sign a contract that outlines the terms, including how often you can ride (some have a limit on the hours ridden per week). <br>  <br>     However, in some cases, the 275 might just be the horse itself, and then you may have to pay more. Like I said, the only one who can answer this is the owner.<br>  <br>  To give you an example, I have a half lease (because I am poor,not for lack of time) and the leasee pays half board, half farrier, and half feed. I still pay for all the shots, worming, etc.|`|zrwqYItJaa	It really depends on the owners they may want you to pay the livery and pay part of the vet and farrier fees or they may want you to pay half of everything, it really depends on the owners, the best thing would be to give them a call and ask about what they would want you pay! x|`|bXcmhRUOaa	Every lease is different.  Talk to the owner of the horse and find out what they expect.|`|ZTCspx5saa	Umm.. no it includes just the horse.|`|nKOPRESxaa	It depends on the type of lease.  If its a full lease then yes, you would likely be expected to pay for board, farrier, etc.  However if its only part lease, then probably not.  Its something you'd need to talk to the owner about though.|`|adLvQoOyaa	hi! well i just started to lease this amazing horse and it costs at my barn $555 a month and that includes everything. yours seems a little low so i would see wat that includes.

YLYAo2zmaa	I have read about people having raccoons as pets and they are very smart and learn tricks easily, from all I read they found them as babies and wound up having to let them go as they grew up and their natural instinct to defend themselves took over. As you must know letting a wild animal go on it's own after raising it as a pet doesn't work out too well for the animal, and keeping it doesn't work out for the humans. I'd say it's just a bad idea in general.|`|H7meHFS3aa	Hm... that's a toughy. You should start by asking your local pet shelters for their input on the whole situation, and you may have to ask your lawyer with this one.|`|n7w6cOISaa	Wow thats just kinda weird... i would rather have a pet monkey :]
3d9rSmc1aa	if you cannot get on with any of the brands of food, try chicken, white fish, eggs rice and potatoes. these are simple, easily digested foods, often recommended by vets for convalescing dogs. i have a staff bull terrier with a very sensitive stomach and he does very well on this diet.|`|OnDeACeJaa	Bulldogs come with all sorts of problems. Especially the whiter ones tend to have more allergy symptoms and are deaf. You would do best with either a prescription dog food which can be expensive or what she needs is a bland diet.Boiledd  chicken and rice should calm her stomach. It is part of the breed that's why I don't know why people are willing to pay so much money for a dog that is guaranteed to have multiple problems. Good luck.|`|mw3woRpwaa	Tell your veterinarian that you would like to do a novel protein food trial. "Novel Protein" means a meat source that is not commonly found in dog food. Your vet will need to write you a prescription. Try Royal Canine or IVD or Prescription Diet D/D in either 'venison and potato', 'duck and potato' or 'rabbit and potato'. In order to do an effective food trial, you cannot give any treats other than the prescription food for 8-12 weeks. That means you need to get a heartworm medication without flavor such as interceptor.<br>  <br>  I would also ask your vet for some tylosin powder, its typically used for diarrhea but works great for tearing too.<br>  <br>  Also switch to a detergent that is free of dyes and perfume. And keep a calendar to see when your pet's symptoms are the worst.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, English Bulldogs are the most unhealthy breed in the world. With a little guidance and effort, you can still get things under control.<br>  <br>  P.S. I'm sure you knew this but switch foods slowly over 5-7 days.|`|Oo9IBGFvaa	i know you think its bs but my friend has one and he farts constantly lol its horrible! my dog is an alaskan malamute and she farted alot. we put her on iams food and she actually seems to be better.|`|MBI4wp4faa	pedigree|`|AA10972366	Try Royal Canin.

6VtuN0NIaa	I actually just got a white netherland dwarf and her feet are dirty,lol so I was looking for the same answer.  I did see at petsmart a bath thing on the rabbit aisle and I'm wondering if you put it where they can get to it if they would know what to do!   Good luck and I hope you find your answer!|`|znGpjsGjaa	You can use baby wipes on him. Or you can use a wash cloth with water and a little soap then use another cloth with just plain water on it. make sure you dry him well. If he can't reach back there to clean himself then he is to heavy and needs a little less food.|`|YPgZa8QIaa	hello<br>  <br>  you can give your rabbit a bath just not very often. only when they are dirty.  they make rabbit shampoo. hope this helps.|`|6H9QxOWsaa	Shave his ***.|`|AA10705467	you can bathe rabbit as you can any other pet.....yes you should limit baths but you can give him a full bath no problem. get some pet shampoo a good one to get stains out of white fur is special whitening shampoo sold at any pet store. Make sure you use warm *not hot water* and make sure the room is a warm comfy tempurature sold he wont get cold when he gets out of his bath. I like using the bathtub cause i can make the water shallow to wash, but be able to rinse very well once done *rinsing thoroughly is important because left over soap can irritate the skin* put cotton balls in bunny's ears to keep water out.....then dry him very well and keep him out of the drafts till he is very dry. if you have a quiet warm setting on your blow dryer some bunnies like getting blow dried *angora rabbit breeders bath thier bunnies all the time, and air fluff them for shows....to keep thier wool clean.....its very common* he will be very happy clean and dry.....if you want something to limit moisture look into litter pearls they suck up moisture, reduce bacteria, and keep bunny clean.
KJDH7ShNaa	well that a tough question and to be honest i never had that problem with my six cats.<br>  as for the corner of the liter box well all kitten do that to make room for the next time they go to the bathroom you wouldn't want to walk in it either would you.lol<br>  but about the first question try to take her paw and cover it show her how to do it.<br>  hope i helped.|`|jsdDgIuRaa	You have to scoop it out every day, the chunks (get the clumping litter).  And the pooping in the corner, nothing you can do, you just have t clean the litter box thoroughly every so often.<br>  <br>  You can't train a cat to cover it's poop or where to poop in the litter box.|`|kZ5wWUg2aa	I have a kitty that does the same thing. We have a hooded tray with a charcoal filter in the top to stop it smelling. Just take the little out as soon as its noticed. There is not a lot you can do with your cat not covering up, but if you cat is a kitten it may grow out of it.|`|NGmRMqe6aa	Do you use a fancy cat litter. Little ones have a strong sense of smell and the best for them is a plain clay litter to start with. He may just be trying to be a good kitty but the odor drives him out of the box.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	You might need a larger or deeper box.  But you cannot teach a cat to cover - either they do or they don't.|`|LddkW0JFaa	If you were you buy a covered litter box, your cat wouldn't be able to go on the side.

wLgGD63raa	Yes, your turtle does need light. If you are getting heat to it in another way other than light (water heater, UTH) it will still need a UV bulb in order to properly break down and absorb vitamins and minerals that are crucial to it's health.|`|hF4G3P1Maa	Yes, go to your petstore and ask them for a UV bulb.|`|2qgg2G8kaa	Yes, all reptiles need a source of light. If you don't have a light for your turtle, it will eventually die of not having enough heat. They also need the heat to digest food and stay warm. Turtles like to bask in the light and stretch out. I've had my turtle for about 4-5 years now and she's been doing great. Make sure your turtle has enough water in it's enclosure to have it's whole entire body in the water. You'll also need a basking spot for your turtle. Some rocks from your local pet store will do if the turtle can get on top of them.|`|DAtqr0QHaa	Yeah, turtles are cold blooded, like a gecko or a aligator and that. They all need heat to warm up so they can move around. I don't think they need it as much as aligators and geckos and that need it to live.<br>  good luck

0m6BgESXaa	Yup.<br>  <br>  Just because one dog is from Ireland or has Irish lines does not mean the dogs aren't purebred.<br>  <br>  Here in America people cross Import GSD lines with Domestic GSD lines all the time, the dogs are crosslined, but they're still purebred GSDs/|`|bPdqwkpPaa	Maybe Wonder bread, but not sure about 'pure' bread.<br>  <br>  <br>  Real answer is that unless both sets of parents were FSS AKC registered, UKC registered, and/or IKC registered, you do not have a dog that's considered 'purebred' by any respectable source.|`|70878cc978ee2e4a79b3b53284340f9caa	They are pumpernickel puppies. And if you don't know whether they are purebreds or not,then you should not be breeding dogs.Get your dogs fixed!!|`|AtLdnZd5aa	no|`|xEAIGnAiaa	This is information you probably should have gathered BEFORE the dogs bred.  Just my opinion...|`|bIaywrBCaa	Do they have papers on both dogs, if the one is AKC and the other is registered from Ireland, you may be able to register them, but you would have to check. They would still be purebred whether you can register them or not.|`|3zv2bbolaa	There is no bread in pure bred dogs.
x5tOxNz9aa	Parakeets don't need to take baths. They are naturally clean and spend great deal of time preening themselves. If you just want to give your friend a bath, try and make the spray as "misty" as possible. They reason why she is probably scared is bcasued o much onher and it too sudden. Make sure she sees you and acknoledges the fact that you are present. Then try and spray her really lightly with the spray, and provide a warm tray of water seperate from her regular water dish.|`|DJa2wS86aa	she might not like it but you don't have to give her one ether,if she wants a bath shell tack one,it probably be in her water dish so keep it clean,my quaker  doesn't like them either but all she does is stand there,go to the birdchannel.com and see if they can help.|`|TD9YmYtcaa	Well if she doesn't like being sprayed just spray around her cage until it gets used to it or try leaving a bowl of water out for it. My quaker uses the bowl but my old parakeet hated the spray but i did it every day and it eventually got somewhat used to it.

It is only easier to gain forgiveness than permission of you regularly make that necessary. I can't say my parents were ever impressed by the doing of chores, but, depending how old you are (and bearing in mind how old you should be when you don't have it any more) the best way to gain permission is to tell them what you intend to do, rather than tentatively asking what you can do. That way they still have the power of veto, but they don't seem to feel so harrassed.|`|SUs4rN49aa	I'm not a parent, but I was very convincing to my mother when I wanted something!<br>  <br>  Just try to show her that you are responsible. It sounds like you are on the right track. Print off the guidelines on the corn snake, tell her that you have read up on it. Snakes are super easy to take care of. My boyfriend just actually got a corn snake in September, he was super tiny when we first got him. And the good thing about corn snakes is that they only grow to 4-5 feet as adults and aren't expensive to feed. Just buying the snake and cage can be a bit expensive at first. <br>  <br>  Doing extra chores wouldn't be any harm on your part. Just tell her that you are willing to do anything to prove to her that you are responsible and mature enough to own a snake! Good luck.|`|WXduJP08aa	im not a parent, <br>  ok well you would have to keep them grades up obey what ever they say and do good

Similar to & exactly like a heat control on a soldering iron.  I plug my iron into a heat control box that is governed by a dial.  The lower the dial, the less electricity & cooler the heat source.<br>  <br>  You would need to be careful that the dial cannot be turned up too high. (by accident)?  It'll fry your critter.<br>  <br>  Keep a close watch on the actual heat that is coming form the heater.  Keep a little log at first so you know where on the dial you get the right consistent temperature.  <br>  <br>  Make sure you are doing the wiring right so it don't short out & cause a problem.<br>  <br>  I also tried doing this with a waterbed heater cause the switch went out.  It didn't work.  The heating pad shorted out & it burnt the wood under the pad & full matress but never melted the bladder.<br>  <br>  Just keep a close, close eye at first.  Should work.|`|b88691c1425e641c73274dcb27f8a891aa	If you're talking about something like a table lamp dimmer, then yes, you could use that. But if you're looking for something to control the amount of heat coming out of a UTH, I would suggest getting a reptile intended Rheostat/Thermostat. You can try looking for those at a pet store or maybe a reptile-specific store (if they exist where you live). If obtaining a rheostat/thermostat is not an option, then the table lamp dimmer will suffice.<br>  <br>  Also, the information that travisandadrienne67 gave you is slightly misinformed. You do not need a heat lamp for your snake. A heat lamp will only result to drying out the air in the snake's tank which will ultimately result in bad sheds for your snake. Snakes primarily rely on BELLY heat for food digestion, so a heat lamp would be extremely unnecessary.|`|k9gC23apaa	NO ! Keep the under tank heater plugged in at all times, you should also have a heat lamp on that same side.  You can put a timer on that.   Make sure that ur snakes branch or spot it likes, is on the hot side and place the water dish on the opposite side.|`|JuvkVZvnaa	it wouldn't give you a set temperature, but it would control the amount of heat the heater puts out.
9mlY5cB1aa	Right now, your situation is okay. However, your fish will grow, and if you want to add more fish on top of that, plus an African Dwarf frog, you will need to upgrade to a 20 gallon. Once you do that, you need to get 2 more yo-yo loaches and 2 more cory catfish, because they need to be in groups, although it is a slight problem as they are both bottom-feeders and you need to ensure that enough food gets to the substrate to feed both your cory catfish and your yo-yos. When you get your 20 gallon, by the way, use both your current filter, which is cycled, and your new filter for your 20 gallon. And I suggest you get a filter with a bio-wheel to help it cycle better. Other fish that would go well with the fish you have: danios, tetras, rasboras, platies, swordtails, guppies, dwarf gourami, pearl gourami, and any other peaceful community fish.|`|bDPVRtCNaa	You don't have any room in your tank. I think you should consider upgrading.|`|Yztrofywaa	It would live, but probably wouldn't thrive. Your tank as it is now might be a bit over stocked when the fish grow up. Dalmatian Mollies alone can grow up to 5 inches, so you will need to upgrade in the near future. You may want to consider the 1 gallon per inch rule. As of now with your current set up, a frog wouldnt be the best course of action.|`|r4Ggo4jJaa	you have too many things living in there already.  yo-yo loach will die in there for sure.  they get to be too big to even fit in that tank within a year and should double in size for the first few months. you really should research the needs of each of your fish BEFORE you buy|`|nVZqPut3aa	if you get a small frog, then it should be fine. also, if you do get a frog, make sure there are no holes in the back of the tank (for the filters and etc) or else it could escape. my frog did :[|`|O0lb4Kcnaa	I have had 2 frogs, albino.  I was told that they don't eat fish.  Both did.  My water had to have more frequent water changes. I usually do my changes once a month but with the frogs I did it every 3 weeks.  They did look kind of cool in my tank but they never did anything.<br>  <br>  When I worked on aquariums and read up on them I was always told that you should concider 1.5 inches per fish per gallon in your aquarium.
CdRlOsnyaa	they are two types of shell rot dry scud and wet scud heres a general idea of the two <br>  <br>  Wet SCUD<br>  <br>  This is either bacterial infection or fungal infection. This is usually the result of a crack, break, cut or other type of lesion in the shell that has become infected. The typical cause for a fungal infection is the turtle being unable to get completely dry. This condition is usually white and/or yellow, smells really bad, and is squishy with ***** discharge not uncommon. Untreated, it can quickly progress into septicemia. <br>  <br>  Dry SCUD<br>  <br>  The most common causes of this condition are water quality and injuries, albeit minor at times, from habitat decorations (scratched while climbing, swimming or diving into the water, substrate, heater burns, etc). It appears most times as white patches on shell.<br>  <br>  The treatment (below) is similar to that of the wet form of SCUD, while serious infections will require the addition of systemic medications. Better results have been gained from keeping the turtle in the alternate treatment (described above) with the water treated with Acriflavine as well. Frye (1991) shows that pathogens that can cause SCUD can be carried by shrimp. <br>  <br>  Another VERY effective treatment is the use of Silverdyne (Silver Sulfadiazine) Cream. This is a prescription medication that is used to treat human burn victims. It is very effective.<br>  <br>  HERES the Treatment <br>  <br>  Remove turtle and place in a quarantine tank. The infected areas should be cleaned and, if need be, affected scutes removed to ensure effective treatment underneath. Remove all squishy, off-white colored material. Be careful as the infection may have gone deep. Going too deep may cause you to penetrate into the body cavity. If you see that you will have to go more then a little bit past the surface of the shell, stop and seek veterinary assistance. <br>  <br>  Listed below is a regimen that I have followed in treating shell problems and has yielded great results. Keep in mind that shell injuries will take months and sometimes years to get back to looking normal if the possibility exists. It takes weeks before the shell will look like it's getting better. While treating, you are not looking for signs of healing or repair - you are looking to ensure that it is not spreading. <br>  <br>  Clean infected areas thoroughly with a strong, undiluted betadine, iodine or Nolvasan solution. Let the turtle air dry in a warm setting for about 45 minutes.<br>  <br>  Apply a generous coating of Silvadene cream. Work into problem areas.<br>  <br>  Leave the turtle dry and warm, ensuring that you do not over-heat, for 18-21 hours each day. <br>  <br>  The next day, scrub entire shell with a one of the previously mentioned solutions, using a soft-bristled toothbrush<br>  <br>  Place them into fresh, clean water. Let them swim, drink and eat for approximately 1 -  1 ? hours.<br>  <br>  Repeat procedure from Step 1.

AA12048299	Personally, I think you'll have trouble keeping it worthwhile financially if you specialize so. You may wish to expand to offer DIY stations for those unwilling to pay the premium for their dog's 'spa days'.<br>  <br>  I think it's a great idea, though. Just not sure if your area will support the idea.. Have you identified your target customer demographic? How will you reach them? Again, great idea... just getting them to come to you..|`|fgxajTiBaa	I don't know if you could survive of this as a sole income, but it would definitely be a nice side job. Personally? I wouldn't take my dog somewhere to get a bath when I could do it just as well myself, but I know lots of other people would.<br>  <br>  Although, I wouldn't do the 10% less thing, it just makes it look like you're trying to lowball your competition. Instead try to make your place seem more appealing. I would rather bring my dog somewhere that cost a little bit more and was nice, instead of cheaper and not so nice.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	Your problem will be by not grooming. At least 75% of any grooming business is from grooming not just baths plus ppl expect pads, privates & faces trimmed also.  I run my grooming business from home & have a good clientèle base. My clients are from where I worked previously or referrals from vets or trainers or other clients.  I don't do any advertising at all. Your problem is right now ppl are cutting back on things like pet care that they can do themselves or extend.  All groomers I know all over the US, their business has dropped off considerable. I do my clients only one at a time & groom straight thru which is what many of my clients want & why vets suggest me for certain dogs with health/personality issues(or their owners!).  Pushing a service similar to that would get you clients but you should consider going into business with a groomer which would benefit  both of you. It's hard to do dogs by yourself(I only do small) & often you need assistance with large or difficult dogs cuz those will be the ones you will get - the ones the owners can't deal with. You can contact me if you have any specific questions & remember it costs plenty for that kind of setup & you will licenses  & inspections. You might want to consider a boarding facility instead. I know ppl who do that & ppl will pay for a place they feel secure in leaving their pets with & you can do baths before sending them home for extra income.|`|Bw18seFqaa	very few people take their dogs to a groomer just for a bath..  at least 95% of the customers want their dogs to actually be trimmed or groomed somehow.<br>  <br>  I dont think this would be very profitable myself.<br>  <br>  I wouldnt pay someone to bathe my dog.. I can do it myself.|`|EeJMITyCaa	If you actually groomed them I would. Id rather take them to place that will cut their hair and nails. Why don't you add that too since you used to worked for a groomers. I think it is a great idea though.|`|AA11244754	If you aren't in it for the money, how would you be able to pay for all of your equipment and earn a living?  Get real, of course you are in it for the money and the fact that you are wanting to charge 10% less proves that you really are in it for the $!  And no I would not take my dog to a house for just a bath, why should I when I can do that at home for free?!  Other than that he wouldn't need to be bathed unless he's getting groomed.|`|AA10805458	I think its a great idea. Working in Vet clinics for many years,i know the craziness that can happen in clinics and I am sure grooming salons.  Putting a low key spin on the whole thing will attract clients who dont like the hustle and bustle of the fast paced places.  Good thinking!|`|DAtqr0QHaa	I honnestly diddn't read all of that but from the last paragraph, sounds good. I would rather go to a smaller business anyways. Bad experience. Just make it look fun for the dog and the owner. Make lots of space. Try to sell doggy cookies, give one away with each cut. :] My place does that. :] Good luck!|`|U50DSq7yaa	i would love something like that in my area. i would also love a place where i could go and SEE them take care of my babies the first time or two. we were taking my pit st. bernard mix to a place here and he was fine the first few times. then we went to take him once and he refused to walk in the door. didn't know why as he loved to go before. turns out, he'd had a seizure while he was there last time and the groomer didn't tell us, since he was locked in a cage when it happened and didn't even pay attention. just realized that he had wet himself and rewashed him. yes he knew chopper had seizures. <br>  <br>  i would prefer a place where only a couple of dogs were there at a time so they could receive more personalized care.|`|V5ZpqRs8aa	I would defiitly do that! I don't take my dog to the local dog groomers anymore. She doesnt like it there and I have no idea why lol. It sounds like a ton of work and you would have to do a lot of advertising and convincing that your top notch. :). But I think you could do it. The one time I took my dog to the groomers it seamed like the lady didnt even care about my dog, she just wanted to get it over with. So just treat the owners with respect and be gentle with the dogs and im sure people with love you. :)
AA10805458	She is either having a seizure or has a heart condition that is causing her to have a lack of oxygen.  You need to schedule an appointment with your veterinarian and get to the bottom of this problem.|`|5ee2106949bcd1e92ad6150f154711eaaa	Sounds like a pet store puppy, or a very badly bred dog. (we have a boston too) my mom grooms dogs she teaches me. Take her to the vet, and keep an eye on her.|`|2iRkXJ4oaa	I'm thinking its time to see a vet.<br>  <br>  Where you should of been the first time it happened.|`|TEG6O7sDaa	You should take her to a vet and have her checked out (not emergency, but soon). She could be having a very mild seizure, and you could catch it soon enough to be able to medicate her for this type of problem. If you wait until she gets older, it could be a more severe, life threatening condition to deal with. Take her to the vet and have her checked over to be safe!!|`|BDRIeLqUaa	sounds like a seizure- see your vet for a neuro exam<br>  start keeping a journal as to often often this happens- and see if you can find any trigger|`|9zepHeieaa	Sounds like mini seizures, my beagle has them. Not much you can do.|`|iVVen0Lgaa	Does she do a lot of snorting during the episodes?  If so, it could be reverse sneezing.  If not, it may be some type of seizure.<br>  <br>  The vet would do brain wave tests and probably at least X-rays of her heart to see what's going on.  You may be referred to a vet school for more specialized testing.  You don't say how old the dog is or if things are getting worse or happening more often.  That can make a difference in the prognosis.  This could be a form of epilepsy and if it's diagnosed as such may well be treatable with a daily medication.|`|p7At4cyvaa	well this may be a sign that you dog is getting older; this also happens with other dogs in the house. My dog does the same thing & then we realized it was the other dog. If you neighbors have dogs try to keep you dog far away from them because they act weird. Your dog isn't going to have a seizure it could be ill i'd check with a vet just incase.<br>  <br>  much <3 <br>  -morgann|`|U50DSq7yaa	sounds like she's having a seizure. even mild ones can have symptoms like that and she needs to see a vet. it is not normal. not even close.|`|Oo9IBGFvaa	holy **** lol. is that a seizer? really i don't know but that sounds like one. take her to a vet asap.
9XysmLqHaa	This is the only breeder in connecticut listed on hedgehogcentral: <a href="http://zeleshollowhedgehogs.weebly.com/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://zeleshollowhedgehogs.weebly.com/i...</a><br>  <br>  I don't know if they're actually breeding anymore but you could shoot them an email.  Most hedgehogs from breeders are gonna be anywhere from $150-300.  I had trouble finding a breeder too (I'm in Louisiana), and I just put up a wanted ad on craigslist and got a lot of responses right away.  I ended up buying an 8 month old for $100 from a lady who accidentally bought a pregnant female.
pDSde3qdaa	The answer here can vary depending on each dog and ferret.  I have 2 ferrets and 3 dogs: Retriever, Pavilion, & Yorkie.  The Yorkie wants to be a friend but plays a little too rough, the Papillion gets jealous rather easily so it wouldn't be a good idea and the retriever is afraid of the ferrets!  SO like humans it going to be different for every pet.  But you should introduce them in a neutral territory and preferably on a leash or some other way for you to be able to control them in case it's not a good match.|`|YPgZa8QIaa	you should have a neutral place where they meet. if you bring them home that is the dog area and they maybe  aggressive because they are defending their territory.|`|1uRM6jjraa	What i think is that your two poodles are going to fight with a ferret and yes they are going to be aggressive with each other.|`|FKqd96Biaa	I have 5 dogs (chihuahua,dashaund,corgi,pug,collie) plus 5 cats. I live in a mobile home and they all get along with my 3 ferrets.But it also depends on how old your dogs are, if their young they will grow with the ferret. Older dogs will probable investigate then walk away. I have both young and old dogs. No Problems here.
aeODdMATaa	No, they should live in a cage with lots of ventilation. The ammonia smell can cause respiratory problems.|`|K2jT1z5jaa	no.<br>  <br>  They live in rabbit designed enclosures.<br>  godblessx|`|3sB49YNnaa	Short Answer - NO!  Even a big aquarium is too small and the ventilation isn't adequate|`|uDQmkdouaa	NO! NOT ANY rodents can live in aqariums, you've seen how small rodents are right? well their lungs are even smaller and they cant take all of the fumes from their pee and poo. It can give them an upper respiratory infection (cold, which is nothing to us but its like pnemonia to a rabbit and can lead to other diseases.) and it takes alot of strength for a rabbit, hamster, guinea pig, chinchilla, rat ect. to fight off an upper respiratory infection.  An aqaurium traps all of the fumes inside the cage and it smells horrible!!!!! a wire cage lets it have good air circulation so the air is cleaner for your pet. =)!|`|GaSK15Kpaa	NO! They will overheat and they need a good airflow. Get a hutch instead. Im sure they could live in a massive aquarium but they would probably die very quickly. Would you like to live in an aquarium??<br>  Please get a hutch or a rabbit designed indoor inclosure.<br>  <br>  Luci|`|h7Z1QWgPaa	yes, if u get a 2,000,000 gallon tank lol|`|gGnHOxbTaa	Having owned a number of rabbits, I can think of a few problems with keeping a rabbit in an aquarium. <br>  <br>  1. A rabbit needs to urinate somewhere, be it in a litter box or just a corner with newspaper pellets, but either way there will be a smell of ammonia, which is very bad for them to breathe. An aquarium isn't going to have enough ventilation and this could cause respiratory problems.<br>  <br>  2. An aquarium would hold in normal moisture (not just from urine) and heat from the rabbit's body. The environment is likely become too damp and warm for a rabbit and cause respiratory and other health problems.<br>  <br>  3. An aquarium has a smooth bottom. Rabbits don't have foot pads like dogs and cats do and would slide around in a aquarium. They can't move on smooth surfaces well.<br>  <br>  4. Rabbit kicks are hard enough to break glass. <br>  <br>  5. A rabbit can jump up to about 6 feet, without needing to run first. So a top would be necessary on an aquarium, but that would make the ventilation problem worse<br>  <br>  Here is a link to a video that talks about what a veterinarian recommends for rabbit bedding: <a href="http://www.ehow.com/video_4439452_rabbit-bedding-cages.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/video_4439452_rabbit...</a> <br>  <br>  BTW, a rabbit is a lagomorph, not a rodent. If you want to know more, see the explanation at: <a href="http://mammals.suite101.com/article.cfm/the_difference_between_rodents_and_lagomorphs" rel="nofollow">http://mammals.suite101.com/article.cfm/...</a><br>  .|`|yN8s1qevaa	You would have to change the cage everyday because the ammonia fumes would kill them.|`|HOd8zvlbaa	no, they need a cage, they need air!|`|UmXBLDoIaa	No they need air, get a cage
nwMBfgcdaa	Your spelling could be part of the problem.  It is spelled German ShepHERD, as in sheep herd, which is what they were originally bred to do.<br>  If you are looking for a cheap one, I would look at a rescue.  The reason you pay more money for is for quality dogs.  I am not sure what the going rate for a quality dog is in that area, but I would say around $1000 at least.  Anyone selling below that price should be carefully checked, it would be a red flag for a backyard breeder.<br>  <br>   GSDs are extremely overbred.  There are too many people breeding dogs that should not be bred, ie poor temperment, bad hips, genetic issues. You should look for a breeder who certifies the hips, eyes, and elbows of the parents at least.  These things cost money.  You should also look for a breeder who titles their dogs, even if you don't plan to show or work your dog.  This helps show they have a good temperment.  It is also a good indication of a reputable breeder.  Simply being a "purebred with papers" or from "champion lines" does not mean the dog should be bred.  <br>  <a href="http://www.germanshepherds.com/forum/ubbthreads.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.germanshepherds.com/forum/ubb...</a> is a great place to check out about finding reputable breeders.  If you post a name, people will give you specific feed back about them.  There is also a rescue section.|`|fgxajTiBaa	This is the GSD club for NH, it lists some reputable breeders.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gsdcsnh.org/breeders.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.gsdcsnh.org/breeders.htm</a><br>  <br>  When it comes to buying a dog, you DONT want cheap because you get what you pay for. GSD have been so overbred by people who don't know what they're doing that many of them have some serious health problems. You can avoid all of that by spending a little more money on healthy genetically sound dogs who come from Ch. parents. This would be a good place to start.|`|3zv2bbolaa	German Shepherds can be found on PetFinders as well as local shelters.|`|4lI4BXtZaa	yeah, petfinder.com is a very good place to find one<br>  alternatively you can try:<br>  <a href="http://www.gsdcsnh.org/breeders.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.gsdcsnh.org/breeders.htm</a>|`|8nwknLsdaa	petfinder.com<br>  <br>  i think its the best if you want to save a dog<br>  or u can google german shepard rescues in NH|`|SnAsZapMaa	Believe me, you do NOT want a "german shepard" - especially not one that goes "cheep". If it cheeps, it is a bird, not a dog.<br>  <br>  As there is no such thing as "ARDing", no breed was developed to do it. Therefore anyone offering a "german shepard" is too ignorant to even know that the breed was developed to HERD sheep in the German boundary patrolling way and so is the German Shepherd Dog, or GSD for short. Thus, you KNOW that such a person doesn't have a bit.ch of breeding quality, won't have bothered proving her in  show ring and/or training rings, won't have bothered doing the tests needed in order to ascertain how risky she is to breed from, won't have searched carefully for a proven stud of genuine quality who has earned all the necessary certificates and is known to produce puppies that are very correct on each aspect for which his brood needs assistance (actually, such a "breeder" won't even know WHAT the *****'s weaknesses ARE!), and should not be pretending to be a breeder. Such a "breeder" cannot offer you an adequate Guarantee stating what he/she will do to compensate you if any genetic disorder turns up in your pup.<br>  <br>  NEVER give money to a puppy miller or agent (such as a pet shop) or an ignorant BYB - money just encourages them to keep doing what they're doing, and ruining the reputation of the breeds they are pumping out.<br>  <br>  If your property is suitable for a dog:<br>  ? but money is scarce, go to a rescue group or humane society. They can guarantee you nothing, but often charge less for a vaccinated & neutered pup than a vet would charge you for just the vaccinations & neutering. Many of what are available will have come from BYBs, but at least YOU are not giving the BYB money, and it's not the pooch's fault that its "breeder" was so ignorant . But you may find that genetic problems (such as elbow dysplasia, epilepsy, hip dysplasia) develop sometime from 2 years onwards.<br>  ? and you want something that will be of breeding quality and can succeed in one or more of agility, companion trials, guiding, herding, KC-showing, obedience tests, rally-o, protection, search-&-rescue, specialist-showing, tracking, whatever, then you must find a reputable breeder (eg, one who proves &  tests the breeding stock and automatically supplies a worthwhile printed & signed Guarantee) with a long record of producing stock successful in the field(s) you are interested in.<br>  <br>  To me, "suitable for a dog" means a house with a door that opens straight into a yard fenced to not just keep your dog home but to also keep stray dogs & stray brats OUT; and it means an owner who knows where the nearest training club is and will happily attend classes there at least once every week, and will stay home 24/7 for at least the first week that they have a new pup.<br>  <br>  Your dog control officer and vet will be able to tell you how to contact some rescue people - may even know of someone who needs to rehouse a suitable pooch but hasn't put it into rescue.<br>  <br>  To find a breeder:<br>  (a) attend events of that type and buy a catalogue - mark on it the dogs that behave the way you want your dog to behave.<br>  (b) join your nearest GSD club, attend its functions, ask around.<br>  (c) contact your national KC (=Kennel Club) for its list of GSD breeders.<br>  (4) join some of the 300+ YahooGroups dedicated to various aspects of GSDs - before deciding to join, look on each group's Home page to see what they are interested in and how active they are - and find out who the people in your region are then ask their advice about breeders to contact/avoid. They will also discuss whatever Guarantee you can get a copy of from breeders you have visited, and educ ate you ab out the significance of various bits of "alphabet soup" on the pedigree of any litter you think you are interested in.<br>  <br>  Just like tv ads, web-sites are for the benefit of the VENDOR, not the buyer - never forget that. Web-sites tell you only the good things, and stay silent about the bad things.<br>  Les P<br>  owner of GSD_Friendly:  <a href="http://pets.groups.yahoo.com/group/GSD_Friendly">http://pets.groups.yahoo.com/group/GSD_F...</a><br>  "In GSDs" as of 1967|`|AA12196139	Looking online would probably be the fastest method.<br>  <br>  I know this site has a lot of German Shepherd breeders.

I8Tahe4Jaa	Hey! I'm from Maine, too! Woot for Mainers.<br>  <br>  I'd like to add that riding Western doesn't mean you're trying to be a 'cowboy'. Western riders are just as accomplished as any dressage rider or hunter jumper. They demand the same level of excellence and responsiveness from their reining and cutting horses and those horses are equally as athletic as any English ones. I've ridden a fair amount in both disciplines and know enough to say this with 100% certainty. I've ridden under American and European trainers, and I think the European ones have a greater command of dressage, but that's not to say that an American person couldn't study under a European trainer and be just as great. That being said, I've known some American instructors that could beat the 'knickers' off some of my European ones, too. I'd say that it's more about your passion, drive, desire and willingness to learn than which continent you hail from.|`|RUzBDX6Jaa	disagree.<br>  Thats so rude.<br>  EDIT<br>  have you watched the olympic riding?<br>  Some/lots of the best riders are american.  How many are british..? Hmm.. you go look into that.|`|rTSwouqXaa	Disagree. By the way can you rope and work in those little postage stamp saddles y'all ride in? Because I can in mine. I can also go over any jump you can in mine. Can your hose be roped off of? I think not. Oh by the way us ''Americans" whupped you british twice. And saved you british twice. Not a wise idea to upset a cowboy. Not a threat....just words of wisdom.<br>  <br>  And what is wrong with being a cowboy?<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit- By the way Jill, next time you have a thought? Just just let it go.|`|u1HahCoqaa	Um, Excuse me? Not all of us are hicks, thank you very much. <br>  <br>  I do not ride western. I ride english, Eventing. Is that cowboy-ish? Uh, no.

Hmm?<br>  <br>  2008 OLYMPIC RESULTS<br>   Eventing, individual:<br>  Gold: Hinrich Romeike of Germany on Marius<br>  Silver: Gina Miles of USA on McKinlaigh<br>  Bronze: Kristina Cook of Great Britain on Miners Frolic (Oh, look, who got beat by the USA?)<br>  <br>  Dressage: Ok, well, Germany kicked both the USA and Britain's butts. <br>  <br>  Stadium Jumping <br>  Team <br>  <br>  Gold: USA<br>  <br>  Silver: Canada<br>  <br>  Bronze: Norway<br>  <br>  Individual<br>  <br>  Gold: Eric Lamaze of Canada on Hickstead<br>  <br>  Silver:Rolf Bengtsson of Sweden on Ninja<br>  <br>  Bronze: Beezie Madden of USA on Authentic<br>   (Oh, and look.......the brits didn't even make it to the top 3!

Obviously we do not "do all you barrel racing and trail riding or whatever", huh?   Although hey, one thing I can say is atleast we can form coherant sentences- did you even GRADUATE from high school? Your sentence stucture and grammar seem awful!|`|sbB0TpGXaa	This is an amusing notion.  I can probably outride you any day.  Especially if I pick the terrain.  Arena riding is not trail riding.  There is a world of difference.  On the trail you have to be ready for anything.  Even the hunters don't have to endure what some trail riders do.  And I am not anywhere near as good as I was when I was younger.  Then I could ride bareback pads with stirrups at top speeds and never worry about losing my balance.  <br>  <br>  All that and I know one young lady that can easily beat me.  at 13 she was running barrels bareback.  Now that takes some riding that few can pull off.  I am not sure I could do that even when I was younger.  I know I can't anymore.|`|5ee2106949bcd1e92ad6150f154711eaaa	I'm from Maine, and i was trained very well. It all depends on the tallent and passion of the rider and horse.

But I digress...<br>  <br>  To a certain point, I believe Europeans have a better background in horses. After all, where do all of the US Olympic horses come from? You can't deny the fact that they are imported. Does that mean Americans can't ride? Certainly not! Our eventers (with the exception of the last Olympic team -shudder-) are heads and shoulders up anything Europe has to offer. We stand our own in showjumping. Are we better in dressage? I would have to say as a whole, at the international level, no. I believe Americans are much more well rounded as equestrians. My friend did an exchange program at Hartpury College and she said the horses she rode where "awful" and that the riders where a far cry below the level she was currently riding at. Her words, not mine. I think that as a whole, European riders are loads more arrogant; that comes from studying under an Italian showjumper for the past five years. So I will have to disagree with your assumption. Just my $.02|`|6JE0mcrLaa	Wow. I would have to disagree 100%. In case you don't know, there are a lot of Americans who go to the Olympics. Not everyone rides western. So to answer your question, yes, Americans can ride without acting like cowboys. What's wrong with "acting" like a cowboy anyway? If they like western, don't dis them for that. We all like our riding discipline, so who are you to be extremely rude toward people who ride western? I feel bad for your horse. He has such a rude owner :(|`|xLNzdxsOaa	I know tons of americans who don't ride like cowboys... English and western are two completely different genres, and the US has a lot of excellent english riders. And not that I barrel race, but I'm sure that if you tried doing in you'd fall flat on your face.<br>  <br>  EDIT<br>  now that mulereiner points it out, you are a troll. who's stupid enough to waste time just to get a reaction out of strangers?|`|x84d9yInaa	Rude! Totally disagree! I happen to be an American, from Kentucky, and I can ride very well. And I know a lot of people who can ride very well. And the term equestrian means: of or pertaining to horseback riding or horseback riders. So that applies to anyone who rides horses (cowboy/cowgirl or not!!!) I so dressage and jump, and am very good at it, so I find your answer insulting. my trainer, who can probably ride 10X better than you on your best day, is an American as well. Can you do this: <br>  <a href="http://i587.photobucket.com/albums/ss319/Just_been_jinxed/n210611284_30744072_3304.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i587.photobucket.com/albums/ss319...</a><br>  <a href="http://i587.photobucket.com/albums/ss319/Just_been_jinxed/n210611284_30744056_403.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i587.photobucket.com/albums/ss319...</a><br>  <a href="http://i587.photobucket.com/albums/ss319/Just_been_jinxed/n210611284_30744073_3636.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i587.photobucket.com/albums/ss319...</a><br>  Can you jump 5 ft 6 inches??? hmmmm??? well my trainer can, she's an American, she travels all over the country to compete, and can ride like a friggin'  miracle!

Do I ride around ye-hawing and cater-walling no but I do rope and if need be can shoot of my horse's back when working on a ranch. But for the record I have done a dressage test and won a few as well. I invite you to come to the states and compete in any event and see where you end up in the end... My money is on the home team. After all Lynn Palm did go to Europe and Kick some major A**|`|1gu71eYNaa	wow i definitely disagree with you. This post is so rude.

uBFhKXgHaa	What you are seeing likely isn't mating at all, but a dominance display. Animals do not just mount each other to breed, but also to show dominance.<br>  <br>  I would really recommend fixing your chihuahua soon. Your kitten too if he isn't fixed yet. Fixing your pets has a lot of health benefits as well as ensuring that they won't add to the pet overpopulation. <br>  <br>  Spaying before the first heat cycle is highly recommended and healthiest in females as it reduces the chances of mammary gland cancer later in life to near zero, but even spaying afterwards has a lot of health benefits. Spaying eliminates the chances of uterine and ovarian cancer as well as eliminating the chances of pyometra (a deadly uterine infection). Every heat cycle a female goes through increases her chances of developing mammary, ovarian, or uterine cancer later in life as well as putting her at risk for developing pyometra. <br>  <br>  Neutering males eliminates all chances of testicular cancer as well as having behavioral benefits (reduces the urge to escape and roam in search of a mate, cuts down on aggression, and if done before the animal begins spraying/marking upon reaching sexual maturity, they may well never spray/mark at all!)

Be careful and try to find ways to separate the two sometimes, you can provide activities for your cat, ball up paper, throw it up in the air a few times, the kitten will chase it. Younger kittens play all the time.  I have an older cat and a younger kitten, she likes to play all the time, the older kitten will play, but when he get annoyed sometimes, he will take his paw and smack the kitten or go somewhere to hide from her.|`|871f0e15f0d49545f27f78f43647edd3aa	Well, the chihuahua won't get pregnant, but the cat might bite the dog because when male cats mate, they bite the female's neck to hold her and I am sure this isn't pleasant for the cat or dog so keep them separated when you are not around.

WUuO6wbAaa	I'm not sure what kind of bird it is you have, but when a bird is fluffy, more than usual, it means they may not be healthy. I'm not sure what the age of your bird, nor the nutrition is, so it's hard to tell what may be the problem. I recently brought my 10 year old lovebird to the vet, who had was underweight, and had a poor nutrition, which led to his beek growing and feathers changing colors. Now I'm fixing that though. I cost me $124. I split the cost with my parents. That's really not that bad of a price, but believe me, you need to get your bird to the vet as soon as you can. You may not realize it, but hours and minutes may be very critical, so if possible, if there's an animal hospital near you, ask your parents to bring you there, as most are open 24 hours.|`|Z9kCzIkyaa	hi animalover.<br>      if your parents are awake see if they can drive you to the animal ER for some attention.. that would be the best option.. how old is she..?<br>  <br>  ehh.. i really wish i could help but this is pretty much beyond my control|`|e3e992707a9967e254eb2441766ad516aa	well!! i really don't know that much about birds, but i think you can make a comfortable bad next to you with a shirt or something like that, to keep him next to you during the night.

ZAljSeERaa	first off seeds are the wosrt diet you can feed your bird!!!! an all seed diet is horrible!!!!!!!!! you need to get this bird on a really good pellet! mine all eat zupreem naturals there is better pellets like harrisons but i have wasted my money my birds all turn thier beaks up to all the high end foods im just glad they eat zupreem anyways there are lil tricks to get them to convert to pellets you can email me if you need to know cherries_angela@yahoo.com as far as crackers no they are not healthy at all way to much salt in them!!!! only give as a treat here and there! ummmmm what about grapes?? have you made birdie bread? i have a really good recipe i can give you if you need it! you have to keeep trying remember what dont work today might work tomorrow! again if you need tips and help feel free to email me|`|09e41Hdwaa	Veggies are always good.  My tiel will gorge himself on broccoli and lettuce.  Plain rice and pasta is good too.|`|e46e0f67f9db3b8dfa4cae1be74a6448aa	Disagreeing with most of the answers here.... changing your lovebird to a whole different diet would be the worst thing you can do right now. Especially if your bird is underweight and lacking proper nutrition. The stress of changing diets can actually make your bird ill. Follow the instructions of your veterinarian... they're the professionals! Anyway, you can feed crackers, unsalted / whole grain would be the best. There are high protein "parrot biscuits" or "monkey biscuits" that you can supplement your birds diet with until it is back at a normal weight. I would also try some couscous or pastina (no butter or salt) and add multivitamins into it. There are also powdered supplements that are designed to put weight on unhealthy/ill/young birds. The product is manufactured by Avitec. If you cant get your bird to eat any new foods ( which is very difficult when they are older) try multivitamins and the weight gain supplement.|`|v6coHbIeaa	Harrison High Potency Fine it will do the job you might have to get it from a vet.|`|20ccea7fa7f3ddbfe3a11c22cf8097ddaa	If you are going to feed him bread & pasta get the whole grain or  whole wheat. A little cooked brown rice would be good. Most birds love fresh corn. just thaw out some frozen corn in warm water , drain & feed. Keep feeding small portions of the things he has tried like apples. Sometimes they need to acquire a taste for them. Try some sliced or slivered almonds. Good for the calcium content. Try some plain Cheerios cereal.
NllWkSDiaa	Hello, canarylover, your canary will start to make clicking sounds, and you will see them breath with their mouth open. The bird will otherwise look normal and active. Treatment is with ivermectin, but if you can take her to an avian vet. Good luck.|`|1gDTiPVyaa	Go to www.birds-online.de--there's a very complete description of symptoms and treatment. Look under the "Health and Diseases" link, bring up the "parasites" menu--air sac mites are at the top.  <br>  <br>  Hope your bird doesn't have them.<br>  Good luck.|`|uvHc7EDOaa	Your bird will be very quiet and won't eat much. When a light is shone on the area, you should be able to see little red dots, these are the mites. When my bird got air sac mites, he had some trouble breathing and got tired very easy (even just a small flight left him wheezing). Because birds don't show many symptoms when they're sick, taking it to the vet is definitely the best thing to do. Treatment is antibiotics and worming. Hope this helps :)

f1gmEmUTaa	Well in my opinion they have the ability to remember things very well. They are capable of learned behaviors which is a type of remembrance. I don't think they are particularly capable of remembering specific things (Oh my owner yelled at me last week so I think I'll claw their drapes). I think they are capable of instinct driven behavior and learned behavior which is acquired through repetition. But that's pretty much it.<br>  <br>  On an interesting tangent, I've read an article recently (and I can't remember the source to save my life) that portrayed dogs as social parasites.

4hNRTWtDaa	They will lose all of their baby teeth.  The adult teeth are larger, and they should all be mostly in by 6-8 months.  Usually the front ones fall out first, and work their way backward.  If the canine baby teeth don't fall out (sometimes they don't) they will eventually need to be removed.|`|eyZwqIqsaa	Four months is the age they start loosing all their teeth. <br>  They will slowly loose all of their puppy teeth and the new teeth will be considerably larger and less sharp. <br>  When the puppy tooth comes out, the new one to replace it is already there peeking out of his / her gum's. <br>  With my dog, I still have some his saved up. He spit them all out :)|`|KOaqPwNjaa	they lose all there teeth and the babies will be much smaller, also when they lose one another should be in its place if not its okay just most the time they lose them because the permanent pushed the baby out|`|4yFDVPhQaa	the one that falls out and is smaller is the baby tooth.|`|PrZHEy6taa	The canines are lost at closer to 6 months but the smaller ones in front are lost around 3 to 4  months. The dogs will sometimes just swallow the tooth that falls out so you may never find them. The new ones will poke through the gums and be noticeably larger than the baby teeth were. They lose all of them, just at different times. They are technically teething from 3 months all the way to 8 months sometimes. Keep lots of toys of different materials and textures for him to chew on.<br>  <br>  **LOL i dont understand my thumbs down seeing as how this answer is coming straight from a vet.

This is the answer she gave me.|`|br1Ixdxkaa	aww my dog was doing the same thing. you can tell when one toooth is growing behind the other. this happened to my dog plus her new adult heath were larger by a little
br1Ixdxkaa	you should confront the man about it... sure you don't want to hm in trouble but there will be trouble if his dog kills yours.<br>   are the neighbors dogs boys?<br>  maybe they just don't like her because she's new around there. maybe it's a dominance thing.<br>  spay your dog if she isn't already<br>  keep your dog innside and away from that other dog.<br>  your dog is cute i saw the avatar.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  call him out on it... tell him about the situation.  he has no reason to be mad at you, and your dogs life is at risk.<br>  he can't try to attack you because he is a grown man and you are a teen and he ccan be put in jail.|`|tnTxHVO5aa	You have to stand up for your dog.  She is really going to get hurt if not.  The next time the dog attacks tell the owner the very next time it happens you are going to report him to animal control.  Then if it happens again, do it.  There is no excuse for this man allowing his dog to do this.|`|pjrPYAasaa	1) call animal control<br>  2 avoid those idiots.....<br>  <br>  if their dog attacked mine I would make sure that they were never be able to own any animals ever..... animal control can make sure that happens....|`|hHQIUrNjaa	first ask him to control the dog. If he fails to do that, call the cops.|`|1NPVVxW0aa	Is your dog ACTUALLY being attacked rather than suffering from rough play or a natural show of aggression and domination?<br>  <br>  From your description of the attacks and the owner's reaction it sounds less like an 'attack' and more like either play (where larger exuberant dogs plough into and bowl over smaller dogs) or normal aggression/domination activity when meeting a new dog.<br>  <br>  It sounds a little like you have a bit of both. The dog is much larger and ploughs into your dog - that sounds like play rather than aggression - it's not the way a dog would attack anything.<br>  <br>  The fact your dog gets 'attacked' frequently suggests she's maybe missed out some fundamental lessons from other dogs about reacting to basic agression/submission signs (in your words, telling them in dog language to attack). If you have a friend with a very calm dog it might help to put them together sometimes. The more exposure to 'safe' dogs she has, the more she'll learn.<br>  <br>  <br>  Lastly, it's unacceptable to let your dog run up to another dog (or person) and cause any harm. You're quite entitled to call the police. But, as I said, your 'regular problem'  is likely over exuberant playfullness on the part of his dog - hence his lack of concern when it bowls her over.|`|KOaqPwNjaa	It sounds like your dog has become scared of other dogs, probably due to being attacked all the time. You need to find someone with a submissive dog and socialize her with the other dog. When your dog becomes less submissive and more confident things should improve, keep your dog on a leash and when the other dog attacks pull her close to you and attempt to stop the fight. Maybe the guy will understand if you pull them apart versus letting them finish. If not tell him respectively you don't know why his dog acts that way but your tired of his dog's over aggresive behavior and you would appreciate it if he would keep a leash on him. Other than that I would suggest a new place for walks.|`|U50DSq7yaa	it sounds like your dog is being either ultra submissive, which dogs will attack, or agressive, which dogs will attack. without actually seeing her, i'm not sure which. your best bet would be to keep her on leash around other dogs that she hasn't played with before.  it sounds like the other guys dog is just a little over exicited about playing, if he really was "attacking' your dog would be hurt when it was over. say something politely to the man as this could escalte if your dog feels threatened.|`|f9fb186e1c82bf7349b1e14dcbb1bcc4aa	I know exactly why every other dog out there hates your dog.. It's because YOU are soft.. You are afraid to tell this guy that your dog doesn't like to be attacked, you are afraid to tell him the truth cause you don't know how he will react.. Your dog takes after you.. If you are aggressive big mouth, usually your dog is too, if you are soft and meek and afraid to speak your mind.. then that is the dog you create as well.. YOU BOTH need to spend some time gaining self confidence.. Tell the guy that you do NOT like your dog attacked, that it isn't funny and if he doesn't keep his dog from jumping on your dog that you are going to have to call AC about it.. Stand up for yourself man..<br>  <br>  Other dogs see a weak mild dog like yours and they feel the need to dominate it.. She attracts dogs that want to jump on her.. Just like you attract people who think they can dominate you.. Quit allowing it.!|`|pc7ZjexJaa	well for one, you need to keep your dog on a leash. especially if you are going to follow my advice<br>  <br>  next time that dog attacks your dog. notify animal control and they will give that owner a fine
qQpBwqMVaa	Hi, I'm not sure about sardines, but they do love earthworms. My sliders have always loved to eat worms. <br>  <br>  Even if you don't feed him tonight don't worry, he won't starve.

PrZHEy6taa	I believe he has wonderful methods and hes a great trainer and rehabilitor. The problem is, its very hard to train your dogs exactly like he does and even in his shows he says not to attempt these things without the guidance and supervision of a professional trainer. <br>  <br>  He offers books and DVD's for the general public with easier and safer methods to train your dogs at home. Ive use a few of his methods and they always work great. Dogs are pack animals and you can use that to your advantage when training them.<br>  <br>  He does not train them with any abusive or fear methods. He does not hit the dogs. The "touch" method is applying very little pressure to certain areas of the body to get the dogs attention on you and not whatever it is the dog is doing wrong. Its all a matter of earning the dogs trust and respect. They do not fear him. In fact, their body language shows increased awareness and general calmness and well-being once trained with him. He has turned fearfull dogs with no confidence (who have been trained prior using fear methods) into proud, confident and obedient dogs.|`|dWed21jUaa	Dont know him personally. I have seen his show. I disagree wiht most of his techniques. My animals listen to me becase they want to, his do so out of fear.<br>  <br>  edit:<br>  <br>  Mute your TV and then watch one of his shows. Those dogs CLEARLY are showing that they're upset/nervous/scared.<br>  <br>  edit:<br>  <br>  My cats ARE trained and know a couple tricks. It's all about communicating with your animals. But that's besides the point, I don't agree with his techinqus, those dogs do  not look comfortable to me.|`|br1Ixdxkaa	yeah, i heard of him. in my opinion he's creepy, he really talks about being a pack leader and so on.....<br>  he is so erking <br>  normal people don't have those problems with their dogs because they train them and don't spoil them to the point where they think they are on your level, you have to show them whose boss|`|7vJNHaskaa	I've seen his show and I have no problems with his techniques. They seem to work very well and he seems to take great care of his own pack.|`|f1gmEmUTaa	I have seen his show, and I do think his techniques work. The one criticism I have of his show is that it doesn't show the whole picture. I want to know his success/failure rate. I'd also like to know how long the median time is for him to 'cure' a dog. I also want to know the legality of him getting bitten. I've seen him take a couple of bites on his show. Does he sue the owners? Make them responsible for the doctors bill? Is that in the contract the owners must sign to appear on the show? <br>  <br>  Overall I think it's a wonderful show, and I think Cesar does know his stuff, I'm just a detail oriented person, so little things like that bother me.|`|TpVtNEwBaa	silent has no clue what she is talking about!!!! owning cats doesnt make you an animal trainer. Cats dont count, there is no training involved. <br>  a couple of tricks???!!!  Eating and purring and pooping are not tricks. Dealing with inteligent animals that have the ability to kill you, means sometimes you have let them know your in charge. Pack animlas obey, respect and fear the pack leader.|`|uKOYK1Lvaa	Honestly? I think he's a psycho.<br>  <br>  Even with his training techniques aside (which, by the way, are aimed at the general public and are FAR too dangerous for the average dog owner to attempt), he's a psycho. He walks, talks, and acts in a way that *I* would never trust.<br>  <br>  But maybe I'm reading into it too much. I'm often wary of people, and base my judgement of them off a snap one :)|`|KsQ2EftYaa	Have seen the show.<br>  Dont' think he's all bad.<br>  They don't show everything it takes to get the end result.<br>  some of his techniques are DANGEROUS if attempted by an untrained person|`|zWluWtw1aa	I love his show and I think it works. I have watched several hours of his show and have learned alot to help me with my dog.

I think he's really good!  I don't think you have to be THAT mean to normal dogs but yeah you should be that way to mean dogs that are vicious and aggressive.|`|KxjUim7yaa	Have yet to see his show. Have not heard favorable things from some people. If he hits a dog , I would not like that. Dogs can learn by positive reinforcement.

IYd6bw7Gaa	I'm jealous.  I want a chinchilla so bad but I can't get one until I move out to my own place!  The ferret nation is a great choice!  Sounds like you are doing everything right so kudos on that!  You sound very responsible and I think being that you can convince your parents another chinchilla sounds totally doable!<br>  <br>  Being nocturnal its pretty normal for chinchillas to get lonely.  They do better in pairs or groups.  The only downside is that you need another female.  I have read that neutering chins doesnt go very well so its best not to even try it.  <br>  <br>  I would suggest you offer to pay for the new chin so it isnt a financial burden on your parents.  I would have the vet or a breeder talk to them along with you and stress the importance of companionship.  I  have heard that having a buddy can add a good year to the life of your pets. <br>  Bascially explain to your parents that having a second chinchilla shouldnt have any affect on them as you are soley responsible for their cage and the cost of getting a second one.  That's how I convinced my parents to getting another hamster.  I basically told them they wouldnt even notice the other cage!<br>  <br>  Best of luck!!|`|vUoEgKxpaa	i think you sound very responsible and your chinchilla sounds very lucky to have you as her mommy. well i would say that she should have another friend because their very social animals, and getting another little girl is the best idea. <br>  and when dealing with your parents pretty much let them know everything you have said in this question, and let them know that your worried about her being lonely, and your not going to have to buy a new cage or anything, i have two chinchillas in the double ferret nation cage also, and they have so much room to run around and play, and when you get your new one just close off the two cages from each other( i love that part of the cage, makes cleaning so much easier)<br>  anyways good luck on getting a friend for your baby.

vAH98IE2aa	Ok If it was my own daughter asking and she had 4 cats it would depend on if she was taking care of the cats as well as spending time with them, she would also be expected to do some chores to earn the money to buy the chi as well as she would have to study the breed and spend some time doing ressearch on proper care expenses as well as health issues associated with the breed which there are a few.. Oncew sh proved she was responsible and could take a quiz as well as Do chores to help pay for stuff her companion would need such as toys leash blanket bed chew treats and such Then I would allow her to have one.. I would also suggest she find a home for the cats as it does not sound as if you even want them, and they should be with some one who loves and cares for them and wants them around.. When your sister moved out Why did she not take them with her? Good Luck!|`|PM23RDycaa	You can't. You mother will either want a FIFTH pet or she won't. I have a sneaking suspicion she's probably not a fan of dogs to begin with. Ask her once. If she says no let it go. If she had already said no do not bring it up again. All you are doing is getting on her nerves about it.<br>  <br>  Her house Her rules.|`|Eg1G2mvVaa	You should raise the money for the dog, and then tell your mom what your plan is for when you leave home.  Unless you live at home for the next 16 years you will leave while the dog is still alive, and as you are extremely unlikely to be able to take it to college or a first home, and your mom doesn't want it, you will need to know where it will be going.<br>  <br>  It may be a better idea to wait until you have your own house and are settled, for the sake of the dog.|`|fU4pOpeHaa	I think you have enough pets. But you could try telling your mom about the breed (the good things about them).|`|CDM8yvmCaa	try saving up for one yourself!<br>  <br>  Don't they cost $500-$800?<br>  <br>  See if  you can save one from a pet shelter, your mum can't say no!|`|jBigEy0Caa	You could try, but ultimately it is her decision.|`|UE4WbmtQaa	Aaah well, i went through kind of the same thing, i really wanted a dog and my parents kept saying no.

Work hard, you'll get your parents eventually if you can live up to it. (i've had my dog for 3 years now, so really, i know what it's like) But you have to be commited to your dog, if YOU want a dog to be YOUR dog then you need to take care of it, slackers are not permitted.

uK85aSoMaa	Yes, it's normal. My hammy Olive (Syrian) sits and "spaces" sometimes - it's just part of her personality. Your ham really might not like her wheel, and some hammies are not into the Ball either. My Olive likes both. But there are some that don't. You mentioned she digs a lot and is typically "hyper" when you get her out to play with her - this is good. She just really might not be into the Ball or wheel. Just make sure she gets her exercise other ways. If you play with her a lot, and give her free runs on the floor (in a hammy-proof closed-off room or small animal playpen, of course) she will be just fine!|`|IYd6bw7Gaa	I've had a hamster that liked the ball but not the wheel, one that liked the wheel but just sleept in the ball and others that loved both.  Its just her personality.  As long as she is still active and playful outside the cage (let her run around your bed or in the bathtub) and eating normally I wouldn't worry.|`|3fGZMZkTaa	Yeah that is pretty much normal for her to just sit there sometimes and not do anything.  Both of my hamsters do that from time to time.  They are in the middle of eating or grooming or digging or whatever and they just stop and sit there real still for a few minutes.  I think they might of heard a noise that scared them.|`|qQpBwqMVaa	Yes that is normal. Hamsters are nocturnal so they sleep and are mostly quiet throughout the day, and at night is when they're up and about.<br>  <br>  We've had three hamsters and that's exactly what they do. They are such sweet little creatures. Have fun.|`|Dxrnvvjbaa	Yup its normal, she just might be hearing loud noises and is scared. :)

7HxJvbjMaa	They are caused by the dogs diet. <br>  What the lab will do is test the stones to see what caused them. The stones can be made from different matter. Once the vet finds out what caused them he will recommend a special diet for your dog. It will be important for your dog to stick to his special diet to avoid future surgery.|`|p7swtBYzaa	First thing you need to do is pay attention to the vet - it is GALL stones, not gull, and bladder stones would be kidney stones I suppose.<br>  <br>  Find out what's wrong and how to cure it, never mind what caused it.   Ask your vet these questions - and this time, listen.   You need to get your dog cured of this, either type of stones can cause obstructions, very painful and often fatal.|`|vAH98IE2aa	There is a few Bladder disorders One is called Metastatic Disease a urinary obstruction- which requires surgery. this is caused from various things such as pollution insecticides obesity tryptophan metabolites sex breed and other reasons.. How ever Gall stones are little stones that form in the gall bladder and can cause obstruction Meaning getting lodged in the area where all fats are released to the bowels, This can be dangerous and if they become to large they would require surgery when They are smaller then they can be removed with medications or ultrasound therapy the high sonic waves break apart the stones and allow them to pass through the bowels. This is most often caused by feeding fatty,spicy oily foods such as table scraps.. It seems harmless enough to feed them fat juices or fatty substances. I hope this helps|`|BDRIeLqUaa	You need to call your vet and confirm what it is- and what treatment they want to do<br>  If bladders stones- you need make sure he is able to pee- sometimes they can pass a stone out of the bladder, but not out of the penis- they can't pee around it, and they can die from this- so watch carefully<br>  best of luck- call you vet
81675c7bcc2aa81478472216e01229f7aa	She's probably going through the "puppy uglies",which most puppies do.  Leave her alone and don't shave her.|`|fgxajTiBaa	You could try using a clip comb on her just to neaten her up, but honestly she's losing her puppy coat and getting her adult coat right now. It's going to look funky until she is fully grown, I would just wait it out.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	You shouldn't clip her fur at all except to scissor up any stray hairs. You risk damaging her coat by shaving it.  Dogs with double coats like hers are not meant to be clipped & will often not grow back like before.  She will have more undercoat & shed much more if you shave her down. After a while their hair won't grow back except in patchy spots.  Take to groomers for a professional job - you will most likely make her look worse than before.|`|KYC0pmH6aa	are you kidding me??<br>  <br>  You shave her with a small razor and not only will she be BALD but she'll be cut all over her! <br>  <br>  It's called brushing her once a day. YOU really needed to do some RESEARCH before you got a border collie. <br>  <br>  If your really that DESPERATE and LAZY to brush her once a day, which by the by will only take a few minutes from your life, then take her to the groomers!!<br>  <br>  It's people like you who shouldn't own a dog...or at least a breed of dog that you cant HANDEL!|`|BDRIeLqUaa	take her to a groomer- I can't tell you how many times I have helped a vet suture up a dog after the owners cut them<br>  the dog moves and bang- you got a larger vet bill then you would have to pay a groomer|`|W02kTOqmaa	both breeds have the same coat type. Right now, your dog is just loosing her soft fluffy puppy coat and growing in her adult coat, which will be longer, not as soft but still soft, and contain a thick undercoat to protect her from the elements.<br>  <br>  Neither breed is really trimmed or shave, and in my opinion, I think it would look stupid to do so. The feet and along the chest is sometimes trimmed to make the coat look even, but besides that, it is usually left alone.<br>  <br>  Almost all long haired puppies go through a stage where they just look stupid. They have different types of coats growing in, and it's just not pretty. My older GSD had little curly spots on his hips until he was almost two, making it look like some of his hair was missing. My sister's bernese looked as bad as you are describing. She had random tufts sticking out of her ears. some of her tail hair was long and some wasn't, so it just looked like her tail had random strings hanging off it. Her backside was very curly, but hadn't grown long yet, so it stuck up in a mini afro.<br>  <br>  If she is indeed a border collie australian mix, then she should get a longer coat in (at least slightly longer) and that will help tame the curls. Give her some time, she is in her akward stage.<br>  <br>  If you do insist on cleaning her up a little, take her to a proffesional groomer, and they can trim the hair for you.

uKOYK1Lvaa	Every time you go to train her, do a run-through of what you've already learned.<br>  <br>  For example, I have taught my Sheltie (9 y/o): sit, stay, come, speak, up, down.<br>  I want to (and am teaching) the "lie" command. Before we begin, we run thorugh all the tricks/commands I have previously taught him, do some work, and finish up with the old stuff. And, of course, there is a lot of praise involved. You have to make it fun.|`|rql2ZEJcaa	i think you should spend more time and repetition on the first trick, get the behaviour ie. 'sit' so he will respond anywhere and under different circumstances to the command. 'then'  you can move on to the next trick you want to teach ie. the 'down'  (but still keep doing the first behaviour also)|`|YnG0Tjxjaa	Patience. Sometimes it takes dogs a little bit to grasp what they're learning. Consistency is the biggest factor. You have to be consistent and repetitive. If you want to introduce new tricks with old ones, keep doing the old ones all the while training for new tricks. Use small treats if you think they may help. Usually praise goes a long way, but sometimes an extra little tasty treat is just what the dog needs to remember that trick!|`|UE4WbmtQaa	use treats and lots of praise. if you do a command at least 3 times a day, throughout the day, your dog wont forget. practice helps and so do rewards.|`|KsQ2EftYaa	How old is this dog?<br>  Do you practice every exercise or "trick" several times each day?<br>  Has the dog known how to do this for at least 2 or 3 months?<br>  $120 for training is cheap compared to the damage an untrained dog can do.  It's part of the expense of having a dog.<br>  If you need a less expensive course, try your local dog club.  They have only volunteer trainers, so usually they have less experience than professionals, but not always.  Many are good.|`|706142df2b644f71545bbc49b36d5cceaa	Let me sum this up in about 2 sentences. Dog training regardless of the level requires 3 things. Patience persistence and perseverance. Keep training fun keep training constantly and be willing to change things up to keep them fun. Build on old tricks by using the older ones as building blocks.|`|5a1c8253181a8adf5c06c0040d8f981eaa	Link the tricks together.  Have her sit, then lay, then give the treat.  When she gets the hang of that add stay.  If you link them together she won't forget them.|`|tjLbXhtEaa	while teaching her new tricks reinforce the old ones. Don't just do the new trick all the time.|`|HXQiLqsJaa	try persuading her to do things with treats but no trans fat ones =)|`|CEKZsoFRaa	use treats and positive reinforcements|`|KxjUim7yaa	You don't have to go to class. If you remember the obedience class and the commands, you can do this at home. We practice periodically so we don't forget.
rTSwouqXaa	I think is a bad idea. First they are already cloning some of the more famous AQHA horses. This is bad because everyone can get the same horses. There is no imagination in breeding then. The whole object of a breeder in any animal should be first and foremost the bettering of the breed. With cloning this is eliminated. I don't like it.|`|u1HahCoqaa	I think that if they want to waste their money, well, it is their choice. I wouldn't do it, myself. Unless maybe if it was a spectacular horse, like the best jumper ever or something, then It might be worth it. But people who want to clone because they liked the one before? No way. There are enough shelters in the world full of homeless pets, and just because genetically the animal is the same, they will not be the same in the long run. Only half of how someone turns out it how they were bred- the other half is how they were raised.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Cloning in general though? I think it is fine, and highly useful for medical/scientific porposes.  I do not belive in that "playing god" ****......besides, most of the kids I know who fall on that line also say "Global warming- yeah right! It's -10 degrees out!" (Because, yes, global warming will mean that the average winter temp will raise by 70 degrees to be in the mid 60's, all in 5 years or so. Idiots.) Anyways, when they want the cute polar bears back (They all died off because of global warming) and they don't want to use cloning....well, who's stuck up a stream without a paddle?|`|9fb74469d3f937feeed0a568c9da83feaa	I think it is a bad idea, because it is a lot of pets in the shelters that have to put to sleep because they do not find a family, they are abandoned or sick... <br>  Why humans would like more pets in this world if we are not even able to take care of the ones that are already around ???|`|AA11612707	Every "pet" is a different being.  They have different souls and personalities.  People don't always grasp that just because two beings look alike doesn't mean that they are the same.  There would be people that treat the cloned pet as an extension of the first one, which would not be fair to this new pet that is a completely different being.<br>  <br>  Also, there are so many animals right now that we can't care for.  We should adopt those that need a home.|`|pDSde3qdaa	That was a really good answer....<br>  <br>  But I also have doubts that the human race could get it right.  Would they just create a creature to die in pain?  I mean we have gotten a lot of stuff wrong throughout history and what makes it different here.
GduRpnn0aa	The most probable cause is that your cat has developed an allergy to something in its environment. Have you changed her food, applied any anti-flea medication, or changed something else, such as her bedding?<br>  <br>  Allergies are the most common illnesses affecting cats. They are caused by changed lifestyles, including food and environment. Cat allergies are characterized by the body's abnormal reaction to internal or external stimuli and are caused by many different factors. Allergic reactions can be different from one cat to another, even for the same allergen (agent). Sometimes, these allergens are in the cat’s own body, causing the body to react against itself such as in auto-immune diseases. It is important to try to find the cause for cat allergies, even though it can be difficult. Along with working towards finding the cause, the use of herbs is recommended to ease the symptoms, and also to strengthen the immune system.<br>  <br>  Common Symptoms of Cat Allergies:<br>  <br>  Skin problems (the most common evidence of allergic reaction) <br>  Eruptions, redness and itchiness of the skin and swelling of the affected area <br>  Digestive problems (such as diarrhea and gas) <br>  <br>  For allergies, I give my cats Stimmune, a herbal supplement that helps to alleviate cat allergies by maintaining natural balance within the body and by stimulating the immune system. It can also be used to treat recurrent infections and fatigue.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.petwellbeing.com/cat-allergies-p85.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.petwellbeing.com/cat-allergie...</a>|`|un0C52G8aa	She many have a skin condition that is irritating her and that's why she's pulling her fur out.

My sisters cat was doing the same thing all of a sudden, and nothing would help. We sqwitched to this food for her, and she is now starting to grow her coat back. (tried welness, etc and that didn't work)|`|b50Oz78caa	she could have a flea allergy and/or tapeworms.<br>  <br>  if allergic, it only takes ONE flea to cause itching.<br>  <br>  ingested fleas develope into tapeworms and when they are passed, they can tickle the rectum.|`|TkbaEic0aa	it might be stress ???? you better check with the vet!!|`|J28SuSsJaa	This is just a guess but maybe she has something internal going on in that area.
DAz3Pfesaa	if i was you i would bring it straight to the nearest climic because by putting eye drops in you could be doing more harm than good and at least there it will get the best attention available|`|h6m94ydgaa	The best thing to use is a saline solution, something similar to eye drops that you can squirt in the eye with a little pressure to clean out the eye.

Sneak out at night when no one else is around.|`|PM23RDycaa	Considering everything else your dog dos with her tongue and any of the nasty and fowl things she may be inclined to eat, the small possibility of germs from some random person's face is the LAST thing you should worry about.|`|fgxajTiBaa	No but I get annoyed when I'm trying to teach him not to jump on people and all the do is "Oh it's okay I don't mind" I'm just like "Well I DO mind!

I just find it icky. If other people want my dogs giant slobbery tongues on them, then that's their deal.|`|ErjSVRkqaa	Controll your dog. I'm sure they dont want your dog to lick them all over but its not like they are going to yell at your dog and whack it across the face. YOU need to teach your dog to not lick people.|`|vUoEgKxpaa	i only get annoyed when it comes to the people who dont ask to pet my dog first. <br>  my dog eats cat poop so im hoping the people who pet her arent grosser then that lol|`|8VxXWEcwaa	you're the owner right? so don't allow your dog to do that.

The dog will be your best friend if you just be the dog's best friend.  The dog isn't all that interested in you, except as a simple friend.  Dogs do have dogalities and they like different personalities different but the dog's main characteristic is that it's simple & social & so it's sort of easy to have a relationship with a dog because a dog is interactive and down to earth.|`|WBv2vD4haa	when we pick a puppy we usually pick the one that interacts the most with us if it sits at thew back and is shy chances are its an untrustworthy timid dog. many people make the mistake of feeling sorry for the one sitting in the corner or the roughest one of the bunch. but for a stable dog pick the one that plays with only you|`|ZvKw1XDmaa	It depends on the breed, and on their prior treatment.

im3vWyv6aa	We got a puppy and we work and go to school. We were able to come home at lunch time during potty training (which was helpful). Our Miniature Schnauzer potty trained quickly using the crate. We have a nice cozy bed, blankie and chew toys in there and we made her take routine naps in her crate until she was potty trained. She thinks of her crate as her own personal bedroom. We also trained our puppy to ring jingle bells hanging on the door knob when she needs out... it's really nice.<br>  <br>  Here is how you do it:<br>  Make the crate as comfy for him as you can. Just treat the puppy like a toddler. After he goes potty outside, let him play around in the house for about an hour or two. Then it's nap time (our puppy needed frequent napping anyway, I’m sure yours does too). We would even tell her it's time for "beddie"... She would sleep for about an hour or two... as soon as she came out of the crate we would take her outside. She would almost always go... then she would come in the house and be good to go for another hour or two, then back in the crate.<br>  <br>  Puppies typically won't go where they sleep... so it teaches them bladder control. When they have free run of the house they don't even have to try to control their bladder, they just find a spot in the house and go. You will only have to be this strict with the routine for a couple of months or until you can notice that he is controlling his bladder or that you can tell he understands that outside is the place to go. Of course, we always gave her a special treat when she went potty outside.<br>  <br>  Feel free to contact me if you have further questions. She didn't spend a lot of time in her crate... but it's very effective.|`|Eg1G2mvVaa	It is possible to leave a puppy, but it is not ideal.  Have you considered getting a slightly older dog?  There are plenty of dogs under a year old being put to sleep because their owners are bored of them.  They would probably be house trained already and would be better to stay alone for a few hours.  Why not look at your local shelters or<br>  www.dogsindanger.com|`|89c7e5af6668337660a2665976affbf3aa	You should either get an older puppy that's already potty trained or wait until the summer when the kids are out of school.<br>  <br>  As a young puppy, they need to be let out every few hours to potty, they just can't hold it longer than that.<br>  A few years ago I got my first dog during the school year when she was 8 weeks old, and my mom had to rush home on her lunch break every day for 2 weeks to let her out.<br>  <br>  Now, you could always teach the puppy to use puppy pads while you guys are away, but that will make the housebreaking process much much harder and longer.|`|nBehRANyaa	I wouldn't get a young puppy unless I could take a few weeks off to work on house-training.  Could you wait until Summer break or some time when someone can be at home for the first little while?  If not, maybe consider getting an older pup or adult dog that is already house-trained and can be left for longer periods.|`|9a3fC9mOaa	Get a cage, introduce him to it properly, by leaving little treats and things in there, and when he is comfortable with the cage, you can leave him in there, but try to go during your lunch break (if you live close to where you work) and let him out to stretch and pee and poop|`|sDfBDXpXaa	Try to imagine instead of going to work for those hours you were sitting in a cage.

zqVDJxUIaa	If your tetra is not showing any signs of stress or disease, (It's swimming normally, as you said), I wouldn't worry about it. However, if it's showing signs of stress, or not eating, etc. then I'd put it into a separate tank to avoid spreading whatever sickness it may have. If your tank is cycled properly, there is no need to do such extreme water changes. You should change a maximum of 20% per day, to avoid stressing the fish. For a cycled tank, 5-10% every 4-7 days is enough.<br>  Good Luck!

Dogs who have absolutely no vices get euthanised every day. The chances of your pet being adopted are slim to nil. <br>  Here is an summary of an e-mail a friend sent to me.<br>  "I am going to share a little insight with you all...a view from the inside if you will.  So how would you feel if you knew that there's about a 90% chance that dog will never walk out of the shelter it is going to be dumped at? Purebred or not! About 50% of all of the dogs that are "owner surrenders" or "strays", that come into my shelter are purebred dogs. <br>  The most common excuses I hear are; "We are moving and we can't take our dog (or cat)." Really? Where are you moving too that doesn't allow pets? <br>  Or they say "The dog got bigger than we thought it would". Really? How big did you think a German Shepherd would get? <br>  "We don't have time for her". Really? I work a 10-12 hour day and still have time for my 6 dogs! <br>  "She's tearing up our yard". How about making her a part of your family? <br>  They always tell me: "We just don't want to have to stress about finding a place for her we know she'll get adopted, she's a good dog." Odds are your pet won't get adopted & how stressful do you think being in a shelter is? Well,let me tell you, your pet has 72 hours to find a new family from the moment you drop it off. Sometimes a little longer if the shelter isn't full and your dog manages to stay completely healthy. If it sniffles, it dies. Your pet will be confined to a small run/kennel in a room with about 25 other barking or crying animals. It will have to relieve itself where it eats and sleeps. It will be depressed and it will cry constantly for the family that abandoned it. If your pet is lucky, I will have enough volunteers in that day to take him/her for a walk. If I don't, your pet won't get any attention besides having a bowl of food slid under the kennel door and the waste sprayed out of its pen with a high-powered hose. <br>  If your dog is big, black or any of the "Bully" breeds (pit bull, rottie, mastiff, etc) it was pretty much dead when you walked it through the front door. Those dogs just don't get adopted. It doesn't matter how 'sweet' or 'well behaved' they are. If your dog doesn't get adopted within its 72 hours and the shelter is full, it will be destroyed. If the shelter isn't full and your dog is good enough, and of a desirable enough breed it may get a stay of execution, but not for long . Most dogs get very kennel protective after about a week and are destroyed for showing aggression. Even the sweetest dogs will turn in this environment. If your pet makes it over all of those hurdles chances are it will get kennel cough or an upper respiratory infection and will be destroyed because shelters just don't have the funds to pay for even a $100 treatment. <br>  Here's a little euthanasia 101 for those of you that have never witnessed a perfectly healthy, scared animal being "put-down". First, your pet will be taken from its kennel on a leash. They always look like they think they are going for a walk happy, wagging their tails. Until they get to "The Room", every one of them freaks out and puts on the brakes when we get to the door. It must smell like death or they can feel the sad souls that are left in there, it's strange, but it happens with every one of them. Your dog or cat will be restrained, held down by 1 or 2 vet techs depending on the size and how freaked out they are. Then a euthanasia tech or a vet will start the process. They will find a vein in the front leg and inject a lethal dose of the "pink stuff". Hopefully your pet doesn't panic from being restrained and jerk. I've seen the needles tear out of a leg and been covered with the resulting blood and been deafened by the yelps and screams. They all don't just "go to sleep", sometimes they spasm for a while, gasp for air and defecate on themselves. When it all ends, your pets corpse will be stacked like firewood in a large freezer in the back with all of the other animals that were killed waiting to be picked up like garbage. What happens next? Cremated? Taken to the dump? Rendered into pet food? You'll never know and it probably won't even cross your mind. It was just an animal and you can always buy another one, right? I hope that those of you that have read this are bawling your eyes out and can't get the pictures out of your head I deal with everyday on the way home from work. I hate my job, I hate that it exists & I hate that it will always be there unless you people make some changes and realize that the lives you are affecting go much further than the pets you dump at a shelter. Between 9 and 11 MILLION animals die every year in shelters and only you can stop it I do my best to save every life I can but rescues are always full, and there are more animals coming in everyday than there are homes."|`|oJUGzFmiaa	im against putting a good dog to sleep but if your dog has already attacked a cat does are signs that he will do it again. just imagine it happens every day through the country, but in each state the numbers of pitbulls attacks are different on humans in texas its about 158 per year german shepards are known to be the number 1 biters. in mix breeds its know to have the same problems its not the breed but of course some breeds are more aggresive than others and it also falls back to the owners. if you dont have an hour or two to exercise a strong breed dog to tire him out he will look for something to do were it be to tear up the yard which is better than killing a cat in my opinion , unless you can find a dog whisperer like cesar millan on the national geography channel this guy is the last chance for dogs like yours. if not think about it your best thing would be to put down the animal. dont try to save the dog when it can hurt some one else. this happens through the whole country people try to save the animal after seeing they are aggresive, thinking they are helping them but in reality these dogs are a danger to their own family and kill children and attack their own masters. sometimes people to save the dogs life will try to give the dog away to another person without telling them and they are stuck with a problem. my brother once had a 5 year old mastiff and would snap  at the kids he gave it away to another person and later found out that the new owner had kids too and it bit one of the kids. the new owner put him down. once they do it once they will do it again.<br>  <br>  look look look looklook look look look look look look look look<br>  <br>  im from texas down here there is allot of hunters that would like a dog like yours for bird hunting, rabbit hunting and squirrel hunting. thats if you want to keep him alive. that will make sure he gets allot of exercise but just because you have a 100 acres to say does not mean he is getting the proper exercise. think about this hunters love their dogs and take good care of them too, they make sure they are in great shape.|`|t8W9OkN1aa	If you really care about the dog have it evaluated by an animal psychologist maybe there would be some way to work things out where the dog can stay in the home. Sounds like your leaning towards euthanizing to me, that would be a better alternative to dumping him on the road to starve to death or get ran over. People just cant afford pets like they used to so it will be unlikely that anyone will take him in. Whatever you do please make the time he has left as nice as possible. Sounds like he needs alot of love and understanding.|`|MsHIb2oLaa	I kinda went through the same thing with my dog ... but believe it or not we got him fixed and he is perfect now he sleeps with my cats and he's not agressive anymore.

Immediately go outside. Say "go potty". IF she should go, reward her.<br>  <br>  ONE hour after she has eaten, take her outside for walk and run around in your yard with her for at least 30 mins.. She should empty out everything.<br>  <br>  Keep it a routine schedule. randomly guessing when she has to go, won't get her housetrained, you'll be on HER schedule, she won't be on yours, and she'll never learn to hold it. Take her out every 2 hours, no matter what. Set your alarm clock:( Also take her out right after sleeping, eating and vigorous playing.<br>  <br>  For every month older she gets, extend the time by 1 more hour in between taking her out. Do not go back inside until she goes.|`|nBehRANyaa	The next time she has an accident, soak it up with a piece of newspaper.  Put the newspaper outside in her designated area, weighted down with a rock or two.  The next time you take her out, let her sniff the paper.  The scent of her urine or poop should help her to understand that this is where she's supposed to go.  Use an enzyme cleaner to thoroughly clean up her crate and any other place she's had an accident inside.  As long as she can still smell it inside, she'll think that's where she's supposed to go.  Keep taking her out at regular times, to the same area, and praise like crazy when she gets it right.|`|EfAzLkL9aa	They have schools for this, you know.
KxjUim7yaa	Sounds like the bone caused a blockage. That is why he doesn't eat, he can't. This is why we don't feed cooked bones to dogs.|`|Eg1G2mvVaa	This sounds like there is a blockage preventing food from going through his system,  if it is the vet will be able to sort it.<br>  <br>  Parvo can be caught from dogs, but can also be caught through secondary contact so all dogs should be immunized against it as a precaution.|`|9kTejB0uaa	Good that you are taking your dog to see your vet - if he deteriorates or if he's bad the other end as well as vomiting, this is serious because of the risk of dehydration so, if he's doing this, I'd bring his appointment forward if you can.  <br>  <br>  Do not feed your dog cooked bones of any sort - their digestive systems cannot deal with cooked bones - only raw bones, and even then you have to watch they are not chewing them into splinters.  A knuckle bone (take out some of the marrow as it's very rich) or rib bone (these do need to be supervised because of the potential to splintering) would be okay.  It could be that this lad has a problem from the bone, but I think you would be seeing blood, from either end, by now if this was the case.  Again, your vet will diagnose.<br>  <br>  Parvo - yes it can be caught from the ground if an infected dog has been there.  Normally if you lose a dog to this dreadful disease, it's unwise to bring a new unvaccinated puppy onto the same ground for 6 months.  However, provided your dog's boosters are up to date, he should not be at risk.|`|p3vjvzRPaa	It's easy to assume it relates to the bone, but it could be something else - you can't know without your vet's help.<br>  <br>  Even if it is the bone, it could still be several different things (eg is bone lodged in stomach, or in intestine, or is there a tear rather than a blockage, or it may be a bacterial infection from the bone...etc)<br>  <br>  It's great that you've arranged to go to the vet.  Just try not to fret too much in the meantime, and keep an eye on him in case things get worse suddenly.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|uKOYK1Lvaa	From what you've said, the only thing we can assume is that it was the cooked bone. Bones are fine for dogs, but only *raw*. Cooked bones can splinter.<br>  <br>  Get this dog to the vet ASAP (so make that call early), but I'd write down the number of an emergency vet just in case.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you both.|`|IEsudy2xaa	Hi sorry about your dog I think it might be the bone it has eaten It could have got lodged in his intestines and that would make him feel very poorly See the vet asap dont take any chances every second counts the longer you wait the more damage it might be doing             I hope all goes well with him   dont forget and let us know|`|Wo0AWgYVaa	Sounds like it's the blockage caused by bone.  Have to be very careful with bone whether it's cooked or raw.  If the bone got broken into pieces...throw them away.  They are supposed to grind on the bone not swallow the pieces....|`|WBv2vD4haa	next time try raw kangaroo tail bones or ox tail bones.. p.s never feed cooked bones or Bacon  bones for soup to your dog its a major no no<br>  hope poochie feels better soon|`|mw3woRpwaa	It could be a blockage or Pancreatitis. Your vet will need to do x-rays (typically 2-3 views) and full panel blood work.|`|AA10500537	not to worry you but maybe a piece of the bone is lodged in his stomach somewhere<br>  sorry|`|vwC7klVVaa	You shouldn't  wait to take him to the vets he need to go urgently as it sounds like he could have a blockage cause by the bone which if not treated quick enough could cause a more serious problems which could get worse the long it goes on. So call you vet right away and explain about the cooked bone and what your dog is doing  Also all dogs should be vaccinated for all dog diseases as they don't have to have contact with a dog with parvo etc to caught it they can get it from place other dogs have been or even from humans who have had contact with a dog with these illness. Dogs need to be walked every day.|`|wefLzXp0aa	Hi<br>  You do right to take him to the vets but that can be expensive, I have a Patterdale and when she gets sick like that after the check over at the vets to make sure there's no underlying problems I treat her myself, first I put a level teaspoonful of sugar and a quarter teaspoonful of salt into a tumbler of boiled cooled water and I give her one teaspoonful of the mixture every hour, then once she's got her appetite back I give her cooked chicken mixed with cottage cheese, I got this information from some American breeders on line in a vets forum, for dogs with upset stomachs they also recommend Pepto-Bismal. Good Luck.<br>  Ray. West York's. U.K|`|e2Pgwa6raa	sounds like a blockage. the bone probably splintered. allways wach him if he has stuff like that.|`|iVQULHqYaa	Dogs can cope with raw bones, however cooked bones cause blockages. I don't know what time it is in your part of the world, however if it's a few hours away you should see an emergency vet NOW.|`|bIaywrBCaa	could have an intestinal blockage which is quite serious and requires surgery.
4aAhEK9daa	Call around to vets and ask.  Vet prices not only vary city to city but vet to vet.  You can also call your local animal shelter and ask if they have low cost spay/neuter programs you can take advantage of.  Note that spaying usually costs more than neutering as it's a more involved procedure.<br>  <br>  edit: "start" Leukemia shots?  There's only ONE shot to protect a cat from Feline Leukemia though it's not 100% assurance your cat won't become infected.  Keep it indoors and it won't come in contact with other cats.|`|b50Oz78caa	check with your local veterinarians.  also, check your local animal shelters - sometimes they will have special clinics to alter cats cheaper than a vet.<br>  <br>  first, make sure the cat is tested for leukemia before you do anything.  leukemia is a deadly, highly contagious cat disease that is prominent especially in stray and outside cats.<br>  <br>  then it will need to start leukemia shots if the test is negative, plus you will also need distemper and rabies shots.  Cats also need to be checked for worms.|`|489qxqqzaa	I live in Washington State, but if there is a Humane Society around where you live you could take your cat there to get him/her fixed. It cost me $30 dollars. It's usually a little more for a female cat though.
tnKjIBWWaa	lol, i think its a noun b/c its describing someone. I dont think theres an actual person called "bird brain''.That's be funnyy though,xD. :3|`|w7XNcmihaa	It could be both, I think.<br>  <br>  Noun- meaning a person, who has a bird brain. Or an actual bird brain. :P<br>  <br>  Adjective- it is describing someone.|`|4663e238a9f0f6994b5cc3db58c86e60aa	If it's name calling then it's a noun. It does however mean that one lacks intelligence-about as smart as a bird. Actually I find that birds are smarter than a lot of humans so it might not be such a bad thing if someone is called a bird brain.|`|82tgfHzqaa	It's a noun. If you said, "they are bird brained" then that would be an adjective.<br>  <br>  It's because birds have very small and simple brains, so you're basically calling someone stupid and simple.
ZvKw1XDmaa	Cats have great eyesight, and can often see reflections or ripples on the surface of the water, and it brings out that little kitty instinct to poke it. Some cats aren't bothered by it, other cats do it for play. Try putting a towel down, or not filling the bowl as much.|`|QDZjhTGqaa	Some cats, crazily enough, actually like water. You don't see it often, but your cat is one of those cats. There is nothing wrong with it though, so you don't have to worry. He is probably just playing with the water or something, but if you are concened about it, there are companies that make automatic waterers that only pour out some water when the pet comes to it (like a water fountain or automatic sink). But as long as he's enjoying himself, I don't see what's wrong with a swimming cat.|`|b50Oz78caa	I had a cat that did that - drove me crazy coz I didn't know why she had to do it.  BUT you can stop it by putting out a deeper, more narrow water dish.  hopefully they won't dump the entire dish...|`|MbzyriZ4aa	You have a few cats... and this one in particular wants to make sure there isn't anything on the bottom of the dish left behind by the other cats.<br>  <br>  It's an adorable habit... you can't brake it.|`|tSQ2kD0haa	My cat does that too! I have no idea why though. Every morning his bowl is dry and the floor is soaking wet!|`|FBl2Dp3eaa	he likes water
yrx6GxDcaa	The way that a dog can lengthen the time that its own sperm have inside the female tract is that the dog's p----  will enlarge so that it becomes lodged in the female. This period may last for a few minutes to up to an hour. It is at this time that the animals appear tied together at their rear quarters. This action may distress the animals involved, particularly if the dogs have not previously mated. Trying to get them apart can hurt both dogs leave them alone.|`|7TKRtDanaa	what is with all theses self proclaimed animal lovers always preaching about cutting the privates off of dogs. I love the idea of loving something so much that we just have to make sure they never have sex(which just happens to be a natural part of life). what makes humans so arrogant that thery have to take controlover entire species by chopping off privates. Let the dogs mate and chop off your own privates... if we keep chopping privates eventaully the entire race will be extinct then what?|`|KsQ2EftYaa	Leave them alone unless they get mean with each other.  You can harm them if you try to get them apart.<br>  <br>  If they try to hurt each other, try to calm them down.<br>  <br>  They will separate between 5 minutes and half hour or so.<br>  <br>  Did YOU have her spayed, or take someone's word for it?<br>  Unless you're going to show him, get him neutered.|`|ZvKw1XDmaa	All those saying that they can't be mating if they are spayed have no idea what they are on about. Ever seen a male dog hump a leg? They will go for anything, doesn't mean the other half is a willing participant. <br>  <br>  They tied while mating. It happens. Just leave them be and they will separate eventually. However, I'd look at getting the male spayed.|`|MsHIb2oLaa	Leave them alone or you could hurt them this could take up to an hour but there fine and it doesn't matter if its fixed let them be|`|d3c4izaoaa	Well, when I was little this happened to my dog too.We through warm water on them and they seperated.|`|PM23RDycaa	A SPAYED female will not allow a male to mate with her. She won't go in heat so there would no reason for a male to try and penetrate her.<br>  <br>  Obviously she is NOT fixed. Do NOT try and separate them while they are tied. Tomorrow call a vet to have her examined and spayed.|`|bIaywrBCaa	Leave them alone. Are you sure she is spayed?|`|WBv2vD4haa	my female is spayed and the male was entire he never showed any interest towards her at all even when other dogs were in heat.<br>  the male has since passed on into puppy heaven.. males arent attracted to spayed females as the scent is altered when they are spayed. i suggest u let the dogs go its called a tie and they will come undone naturally dont try to seperate them as you can cause injury. i suggest taking her to the vets asap and having her spayed to stop excess puppies|`|br1Ixdxkaa	what?<br>  EXPLAIN THIS AGAIN PLEASE...<br>  <br>  i don''t think they mated if she is fixed<br>  if they are mating, which is the reason why so many dogs are in shelters, they need to be fixed pronto|`|KxjUim7yaa	I have heard of this, but if she is fixed she cannot have any puppies. Don't try to break them apart. You can cause injury|`|f9fb186e1c82bf7349b1e14dcbb1bcc4aa	You can't do anything now til they separate.. Don't allow this to happen again.
I38WF5aFaa	That's plenty of space.  Get a good reference book about chickens.  I like "Storey's Guide to Raising Poultry".  It has everything you need to know to be successful including plans for chicken coops.|`|mjO5MOYhaa	If they will be out during the day, that size should be fine. If they are to be kept inside all the time, you need one square yard of floor space per bird.
HHvBmrA1aa	Okay, I think I understand the question. The 31" Savio weir is a filter unto itself. You can have a pump plumbed straight to it and receive filtered water from the cascade. I would just place the pump as close to the waterfall as possible in as deep water as possible.<br>  <br>  For the original filtered pump, I would just place it at the opposite end of the waterfall and far away from the other pump and have it return either to a different water feature or simply back into the pond at a different spot than the waterfall. It would be like having two filters and two returns on your pond so you don't have to worry about all of the water going through your single original filter. Also, if your filter is the bottleneck, having the water flow into another filter (the waterfall) afterward will reduce the flow even more.<br>  <br>  Also, having two pumps located at different spots of your pond will help muck from accumulating in any one spot on the pond floor.<br>  <br>  Since you'll have two pumps to power your pond and circulate water, I'd consider installing a pond skimmer or UV sterilizer if you haven't already.|`|YnCUyvK7aa	I can't say I've ever had experience with this sort of pump, and your question is a little confusing.  But if I understand the 2 options as you give them, you would either be connecting the pumps together in sequence or running them separately side by side to the same water fall that has 2 outlets.<br>  <br>  I would go with the second option here.  Not only would the flow be more uniform [like you mention], but if there should ever be a problem with 1 of the pumps, it wouldn't put any stress on the other 1.  I could imagine what would happen if 1 filter clogged, but another was still trying to force water through it.  Or if the plumbing got loose.  Having them run separately would give you a backup if 1 of them failed.<br>  <br>  Someone who's actually used these might have a different opinion based on their experience, but this would be my opinion based on the information you give.

If you take the time and have paitence and love toward the dog when training, her and teaching her right from wrong then you end up with an intelligent loyal loving gentle protective companion. Owners are are responsible for their dogs behavior Not the dog who did not teach it's self Would you give or sell your child because you failed to wear protection and or they did not listen because you did not take the time to train them to not behave inaproperately?

1WmDOPGtaa	I can't speak to the actual time frame for your particular dog, but that's a common growth pattern in canines.  Just bear in mind, there's a difference between "filling out" and getting overweight.  As your dog begins to fill out, make sure you can continue to easily feel his ribs and see a gentle tuck at his waist (both from the side and above).  By the time he's 1.5-2 years old, he should be pretty much done developing.
AA10633378	I've kept a few bantam Wyandottes as pets for about eight years. They were great. Friendly and docile, but flew well enough to get up to the house roof when the occasional neighbor cat made it into the yard or too close to them. I've never seen the Gingernut Ranger, but according to the site below they are extremely tame and make great pets for kids as well (though obviously a much bigger bird than the bantam Sussex or bantam of any breed). As for the Sussex, they're just a great bird as well. However, you concern me when you say you are getting "one". Chickens are flock birds and on those days when you can't be there, you're going to have a very disappointed and perhaps stressed out bird.

While fruit doesn't add a lot in terms of nutrition, it does help provide color (attractiveness) and moisture to the diet. Juicy fruits also make a nice mid-day treat, so use as treats those fruits that your iguana likes, such as bananas, that are otherwise not good for the daily diet<br>  <br>  you can try a little latter to offer him fruit but for the time being it is not going to hurt him to much ( liek the articel mentions) <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.veterinarypartner.com/Content.plx?P=A&A=1301&S=4&SourceID=55" rel="nofollow">http://www.veterinarypartner.com/Content...</a><br>  <br>  that site goes indepth about fruit in an iguanas diet.

dmOAYUKEaa	You could put a little rope glued or punch a hole hanging from the top, rats and mice love to climb. Another few ideas are you could put a little ramp, a few toilet paper rolls (not paper towles) made in the shape of a maze, a few upside down show boxes with a block or something put at the bottom so they can get in, and basically anything for them to climb on, hide in, or chew on works, they also love mazes. And to get them out, depending on what your rats like more cheese or peanut butter on crackers (which my mice like more than anything) hold it in your hand as close as you can get to them. Hope this helps.
5a1c8253181a8adf5c06c0040d8f981eaa	First off, this is not an emergency!  See your regular veterinarian tomorrow.  Hematomas can sometimes be drained without surgery or anesthesia.  They are often accompanied by an ear infection which will also need to be treated.<br>  <br>  And please do not give away pets because they have an illness.  You are responsible for your own pets, don't pass your problems on to someone else.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	It does sound like but you need a vet diagnosis & treatment.  Most need surgery which isn't major & usually fixes the problem.  Make vet appt tomorrow.|`|F08HDRvraa	A hematoma is a bruise, probably nothing requiring surgery.  However, I would wonder how a dog got a bruise on it's ear.  Take him to the vet, he may have been scratching his ear and it is now infected.|`|Net8og9Baa	If the ear is swollen like a bubble and flopped over, it's likely an aural hematoma.  The hematoma is easily corrected with surgery, but you'll also need to treat the underlying cause of the hematoma, which is usually a nasty ear infection.  In either case, both are easily curable if you follow your veterinarian's directions.|`|c90696a851f3ee0c6b1f63f7f595eca4aa	My dog had a hemotoma in his ear flap and that is what it's like. First of all, assess if it's hard or slightly squishy. If it's hard, you need to decide what to do fairly quickly. What my vet told me is that there are a few options. You can go to the vet and have them empty it and put stitches in or you can just leave it, but it will make your dog's ear wrinkled. I got my dog's drained, but it was a big pain. He had to wear a cone for quite a while, and was on a lot of pain medication.|`|Vj13f7zmaa	Hematoma is nothing to worry about.  But if it is that painful, it could be infected.  Take him to the vet to get it drained off and he will feel much better.  No surgery, they do a needle aspiration.|`|UE4WbmtQaa	well maybe you shold GO TO A VET|`|uXAV4wP0aa	My border collie/aussie mix had hematoma on both ears. It felt just like a bubble, but a little heavier. My vet said the dog got it from playing too rough with my big dog, who was about 45 lbs. heavier at the time. <br>  <br>  Anyway, we brought her to the vet and it was really simple. We just dropped her off, they drained her ears, and a few hours later we picked her up. She had to have her ears taped for a few weeks to prevent it from happening again and she had to wear an e-collar for that time. Having it done wasn't a big deal and it wasn't too expensive. Although that will vary from vet to vet. <br>  <br>  You should get your dog in to the vet. It seems to be bothering him and it can be a big deal. But the problem won't be fixed until he is checked up. :)|`|FKqd96Biaa	I had a dog that had a hematoma in his ear. It looks like it is thick and sore to the touch. What the vet will do is slice it open and let it drain, then sew it up.

IdSqunZuaa	All dogs have health issues. However, based on their personalities, I think Bichon and Yorkie have the edge when it comes to health. Here are some details about them, <a href="http://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/bichon-frise/health" rel="nofollow">http://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/bichon-fri...</a> and <a href="http://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/yorkshire-terrier/health" rel="nofollow">http://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/yorkshire-...</a>|`|qx4F2SJmaa	I am not sure about the Maltese, Bichon or Poodle, but I do know from personal experience that Yorkshire Terriers do tend to get serious health problems.  My own Yorkie developed diabetes, and was insulin dependant. His diabetes led to complete blindness and finally pancreatitis. My dog was AKC registered and a decendant of show dogs on both sides.  He was from a specialized breeder in Penn.  No puppy mill, no pet store, he was born and bred for me. Anyway, just understand that whether or not the breed you pick has a propensity for a serious health issue doesn't necessarily mean it will develop it.  Just be prepared to spend lots of money on their care if they should get ill.  Pet insurance is a must these days. I didn't have it, and the vet bills were exorbitant.  Ever consider adopting a cute mutt?|`|tPGxPDvBaa	All of them are very over & poorly bred now & have lots of health issues. Out of the 4 probably a bichon has the least number of health issues but with their skin allergies & sensitive skin makes them equally as bad.|`|XagPxe7Faa	It depends.  Health is largely a result of if the dog was well bred, less a result of what the breed of the dog.|`|SfuHU3Gpaa	All those dogs can have major health problems depending on where you buy them. For your money's worth, stay away from Petstores and BYBs because with the price you will pay, you can get a -healthy- puppy from a reputable breeder.|`|PM23RDycaa	The one from the reputable breeder who does the proper genetic and health clearances on the adults BEFORE breeding them and has a owner capable of keeping it health with proper care, feeding and vet visits.|`|fgxajTiBaa	Any dog that is poorly bred will have major health problems. Choose a breed you prefer and look up the breed club for that breed. It will direct you to responsible breeders whose puppies should have minimal health problems.

I'd try gently wiping it with a warm damp wash cloth.|`|RwQmN7Reaa	I would try just washing it and brushing it off. It could very well be just dry drool from the other dog. If it doesn't come off and seems to be dry or scabby take your dog to the vet because that is often a sign of mange or fur mites. The mites prefer areas such as the back of the neck or under the armpit area because of the blood flow in these areas. It can be treated if caught early. Hopefully it is just dried dog slobber, good luck!|`|jf4UOCElaa	who knows give him a bath then maybe you can tell|`|ivIQl6Awaa	probably dried drool from the other dog.

MzHwklzKaa	Depends on what you want in a pet.<br>  <br>  Chinchillas don't cuddle.  They like to play by themselves, and will come over if you offer food.  They're fun to watch, but reconsider if you want to cuddle.  Some of them will let you hold them.  VERY FEW like being touched/pet.<br>  <br>  Rats and guinea pigs are cuddly rodents.  They're smart, clean, and really like people.|`|s6ZpW9dKaa	I think chinchillas are the best rodent you can have (smell wise) they don't smell nearly as bad as rats, ferrets, guinea pigs, or other rodents. <br>  but they are a big responsibility, and sometimes not as friendly as other rodents (but they are super cute so it makes up for it.)<br>  <br>  Before you get one you NEED to research how to take care of them, risks, and other factors.

1WV1BL6gaa	Ugh. So many people have to do that with little dogs and even cats. For whatever sick reason they think it's fun to get the riled up.<br>  <br>  You should run an online search for "play fighting and dogs" to come up with resources you could show him to prove that's one cause of the other bad behaviours.<br>  <br>  To reduce resource guarding, start giving your dog a really good treat when you approach his food bowl, when he has a toy, whenever else he's guarding. Don't try to take anything away from him at first, just drop the treat and walk away. Gradually work on getting closer to him, then touching what he's guarding, then taking it and giving it back, until he gets the idea that you aren't a threat.<br>  <br>  Edited to add: Just ignore your dad when he says stuff like that to you. As a responsible, educated dog person you have to develop a thick-skin toward people who think they know better than you. If you can't stop your dad from doing what he does, you can still teach your dog the manners he needs through kindness and consistency. Starting with sit is a good thing. Soon, your dog will respect you and trust you while he treats your dad like an errant playmate.|`|pyqgEbmsaa	Sign up for some training classes.. Leave your dad at home.. Teach the dog to listen to you, take commands from you, and to ignore your dad's attempts at aggressive play.|`|16t6xnpUaa	Basically, your dad has instilled in the dachshund that he is the alpha of the group. By allowing the dog to rough house and "win" these fights, the dog now believes that he is king of the castle. This is a bad habit and could lead to possible injuries in the future if his aggression continues to progress. This is not about your dad being interested in the dog and thinking it is cute, but also about the safety of others. There are clear boundaries your dog should have, such as not being able to injure or hurt anyone by nipping or trying to bite someone. A dog is not a human- this does not make it a slave. This makes it a different species. The dog does not have rational thoughts like humans do and would not think of the consequences of biting a young child walking by, for example. Therefore, obedience and having the dog able to follow command is beneficial to the dog and the master, because a dog that bites someone is a potentially dangerous dog and can be taken away by an animal control officer if need be if it does any damage. You should consider talking with your dad about these dangers.|`|AoSeHXeQaa	It seems to me that its pretty much an impossible task to train a dog, when you have someone else untraining him every day.<br>  <br>  The best you can do is teach him not to attack you, by correcting him with a touch and a "NO" when he snaps at you.  <br>  <br>  What a shame :o(

Since it's so important for her to take her medicine, don't worry if what you mix it with isn't very healthy, go with what ever she likes & you'll probably need to switch flavors once or twice while she's on antibiotics.<br>  We needed to give 7 rats antibiotics for 2 weeks once & only 3 of them were cooperative enough to simply take it from a dropper.  Two were pretty good about taking it mixed with a tiny bit of banana (we didn't give them banana @ any other time during their treatment), one got tired of the banana so we switched to cooked oatmeal, then baby food, then chocolate soymilk, and with the other we had no choice but to sit her on my lap while I'd scruff her & my SO put the dropper into her mouth.  Even though she was too stubborn to willingly take her medicine she was very gentle & didn't object much with this method.|`|a075ibDMaa	try cream cheese! its my rats favourite treat so it's worth a try!|`|GEfUTyi8aa	As you know, rats are not stupid.  I would take her back to the vet and make sure this medicine is okay, maybe its a bad batch and rat knows best.  if worse comes to worse, get the vet to inject the medication directly into her... you dont want to mess with a respiratory infection.... it could get nasty... life threatening if it gets worse.<br>  <br>  what a little rat :)<br>  <br>  I was thinking, perhaps have a friend come over and help you... have them wear leather garden gloves.... hold her and you put the dropper down her throat... I have to do this with my cats... they are persians and if I dont shave their butt... guess what.... things that should be in the litter box end up in all sorts of places in my house.  Soooooo my husband holds them down (or they will scratch me apart) and I shave their butt.... so if I can do this with a pissed off six pound wriggling persian who wants to not only scratch but bite me.... you can get someone to help you give this little rat her meds :)<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|po62AbPqaa	I can relate perfectly.......and a rat will not let you shove a dropper into its mouth without a struggle...unless it is their fav juice :><br>  <br>  Ive just finished a week ago dosing my six rats once daily with 2 drops of Baytril for 21 days!!! and then my baby rat with Baytril AND Doxycycline TWICE a day for a further 21 days!!! <br>  <br>  not easy...tried hiding in food etc but it took too long for them to eat and then they wouldnt eat it and I wasnt even sure if each of my ratty girls got their correct dosage...so in the end, with the help of a thick facewasher I force dosed them...I had to-there were 6 that needed it<br>  <br>  I wrapped each ratty in turn very securely in the facewasher...little hands and everything wrapped like a swadling bambino...just the little head sticking out from the neck...they SQUIRM so much that I had to hold firmly...my vet showed me how to do it with 2 people if one person holds the back legs above the ankle bone very firmly, but I only had me so had to work out a method best for me...I first put on the washer like red riding hoods cape, secured with fingers at neck and then wrapped tightly<br>  <br>  anyway...I had the dropper bottle ready to dispense 2 drops into each ratty's mouth while I held my ratty in one hand...in my palm with her tummy up...I used my thumb and index finger to hold the facewasher closed very firmly around her neck and tightly under her chin...my ratties struggled like mad but I am stronger...my main fear was that I would break one's neck or something so it was a bit scary...<br>  <br>  but I trusted that my ratties were not so stupid that they would let their necks get broken once they realised they could not escape!!!! and they did settle somewhat...I just made sure I was firm and confident but not squeezing or hurting them<br>  <br>  TALKING to ratties is REALLY REALLY VIP when you are doing something to them...they will look at you and pay attention...I kept talking to each ratty throughout the ordeal<br>  <br>  Once I had my ratty firmly held I quickly squeezed 2 drops from the dropper bottle into the mouth and held for a further moment or two until ratty showed a sign they'd swallowed...eg, tongue comes out<br>  <br>  Then I unwrapped ratty and gave her lots and lots and lots of PRAISE "good good good girl" etc and gave her some yummy yoghurt covered rice crispy treats that my rats LOOOOVE <br>  <br>  and then did another...after each ratty had its dose I gave them all some more treats and play time outside the cage. After 3-4 days my poor little ratties kind of gave up a bit and were less stuggling, and although they never loved me doing it they did forgive me... treats did the trick<br>  <br>  my poor baby that had to have endless heaps of antibiotics was the sad little thing but she has now forgiven me too and she has gone from seriously ill to a picture of good health...so it is worth it<br>  good luck  <8(   }~~~|`|IC9S3brpaa	What you can hide the meds in depends on what the drug you are using is...<br>  <br>  If the active ingredient is Doxycycline you shouldn't give it with dairy products as it can decrease the effectiveness of the drug on the infection.<br>  <br>  If you are using Baytril (Enroflaxin) then the options for mixing are greater.<br>  <br>  I have had success with mixing meds in some soy milk. I normally buy the infant soy formula and mix it - one part formula to 2 parts water. This works well for the rats that love soy milk.<br>  <br>  Coconut cream is another thing that has worked in the past with our rats. If you are having to medicate with Enroflaxin then the coconut cream neutralises the bitterness of the meds.<br>  <br>  Baby food sometimes works well but not all rats fall for this one.<br>  <br>  You can also syringe the medication into a chip, we have done this for especially stubborn rats and they have gobbled it up.<br>  <br>  There is a product on the market made for birds called Egg and Biscuit which can be made to a consistency that allows you to roll it into a ball. Mix the meds into this mixture and give it to her to eat.<br>  <br>  If all else fails then medicating directly into her mouth is the only way left. It is not easy but well worth it if her health is to improve. Give her a tasty treat afterwards to help get rid of the terrible taste.<br>  <br>  When you mix the meds make sure you mix enough of the cover food to cover the taste BUT not so much that she just can't finish it. It is a bit of trial and error to work out what works best but it is worth the stress.
YnWwcUPTaa	That's called bolting and can result in bloat a very serious and sometimes deadly condition some dogs are just like that but you can slow them down,  there are special dishes you can buy that have raised obstacles sort of i like  nubs which will help slow them down, there is  also  a stainless steel version with one large nub in the middle all of this helps them slow down their eating as they have to eat around the obstacles.  One my dogs has to have that dish giving any other dish and he goes back to bolting.  I have found since I put him on raw because he has slowed down considerably as the pieces are large with bone and tendons he must slow down to chew..  Any meat that I grind even coarse like beef heart must be put in the special dish. but quartered chicken or chicken backs are given as is. even my dam who is due approximately March 19  gets it that way.  I use to have that problem with one of my horses too.|`|0m6BgESXaa	Cookie sheet or rocks!  Much cheaper than a baffle bowl :D<br>  <br>  With food spread on a cookie sheet, he can't scoop food into his face.  With rocks too big to swallow, he'll be forced to eat around them, and again, will have to chew his food.<br>  <br>  Nip this in the bud as quickly as possible, as he can ingest too much air as well, and bloat.|`|LEuPv4bfaa	I had this problem with my 8 month old Husky, we heard that putting tennis balls in her dish would get her to slow down. So, we placed two in her food dish and she now eats slower and chews her food. The good thing is you wouldn't have to hand feed your puppy! Hope this helps!|`|59SM8kFIaa	just like your first answer , get a bowl i got one for my rott she would do the same thing! i got mine and pet smart  a big one for  6 99 !!  it was called a slow down dog dish!!|`|SfuHU3Gpaa	I'd keep trying what you have been doing already. It may take some time, but I'd still do it.<br>  <br>  Just feed him peice by peice if you have too until you find a sure fire way of slowing him down and getting him to chew.|`|n5wUI2mDaa	you could try adding water to dry kibble so he'll have have to lap between gulps, maybe slowing him down a little.|`|1WV1BL6gaa	I agree, feeding once piece at a time is a good idea. This is a weird suggestion that I know is contrary to all the good advice out there, but have you tried free-feeding him? I did that with my very first pup (although I know better now) and he never turned into a chow-hound even though I switched him to scheduled feedings at about 5 months. I guess he decided since food was always around that it wasn't that exciting. You might ask your vet about trying that. <br>  <br>  Another trick is to add water to make the food mushy and more difficult to gulp down so fast. You could feed moistened food for a while and work up to feeding completely dry food to see if it helped him figure out chewing.|`|ikUQfpd9aa	Give him some <br>  <br>  1.Puppy food<br>  2. Formula<br>  3. Wet food<br>  <br>  It's pretty normal for a dog to eat fast.|`|GaL66jbQaa	You could try toys that dispense his food.  It may not make him chew but he'll only be able to get a couple pieces at a time.  most of my dog's food is in toys that they have to figure out how to use. Tricky Treats ball, buster cube, dog pyramid and giggle ball are just a few of this type of toy it really makes them slow down.

2fdee6b1fd597a29209ecfad9dc8b598aa	Kits bite hard in play.  They also will nip when exploring (like babies 'mouth' things) and when teething.<br>  <br>  Has she been checked for earmites?  The discomfort and pain will cause them to bite harder and have a more difficult time listening to you.  Untreated infestations can kill animals, too, so it's important that it's either ruled out or treated (ivermectin or tresaderm).<br>  <br>  To teach her use either time outs (no longer than 10 minutes) or scruffing, hissing, and saying no (a light shake is optional).  It's important, though, that you *never* put her down if she bites you when you pick her up.  Just discipline first (if using the scruff method) and hold her for a minute or two, OR hold her and THEN put her in time out (if you use the time out method).<br>  <br>  Be consistent with discipline, but ALWAYS make sure to praise her when she decides NOT to do the behavior.  If you pick her up and she doesn't bite, praise.  If she smells an area that she usually bites but turns away or doesn't bite, praise her.  That's just as important as setting the rules and enforcing them.<br>  <br>  Good luck :)|`|FBGRvnuKaa	Yeah kits will bite.  If they were playing with their litter mates that's what they would do to each other.  You just need to teach her that it's not okay by markedly ignoring her when she bites or putting her in a short (like 1-2 minutes) timeout in a cage or crate used only for timeouts.  Don't use her travel crate because then she'll think she did something wrong every time you put her in it to go somewhere.<br>  <br>  I have success by saying "Ow!" in a high pitched voice and then turning my back.  My girl will try so hard to get my attention, but I just ignore her for a minute.  She gets the message.|`|AA12095067	Yeah ferrets bite. You can buy muzzles for them.

lcuxD3qlaa	theres not much information on them, but good luck to ya|`|CdRlOsnyaa	I have had lots of success with these little moon crabs or soap dish crabs or Tai devil crab . They have so many common names lol<br>  Since there is like NO information on them if some one else says different I am sure they are, but this has been my experience with them. I have kept many species of crab before and these guys take allot to set up right.<br>  <br>  First thing I can recommend for these cute little guys is GLOVES and thick pair or leather gloves these guys pinch and will hang for 20 mins before they let go.<br>  <br>  I would start 1 crab in a 10 gallon. <br>  <br>  The substrate that I used was "bed a beast" it is that really soft compressed coconut mulch that expands when placed in hot water. Kept there substrate moist. <br>  try to avoid gravel and rocks as it really breaks up the little crabs feet. They come from very soft sanded beaches.<br>  <br>  Filtered water only!!! They can't take any chemicals in the water. water will have to be changed regularly, ever other day.<br>  <br>  Lighting UVB bulbs 40Wnight and 40W day lights. They are nocturnal so I could view them easier I would turn the day bulbs on at night and the night bulbs on during the day that way we were up at the same time.<br>  <br>  They have excellent eye site and can see you from across the room, they are very shy the 1st month you have them you will almost never see them. But after a while they will get used to you. Once they realize you are the one bringing the food. They also have an excellent sense of smell mine would always come out from where ever they were hiding when I was cooking dinner.<br>  <br>  And as for water bowls, I found the best success with using plastic Tupperware: the long rectangular ones with the short sides. I would dig a spot to put the Tupperware into and put cork bark ramp so the could get in and out of the water easier. A Tupperware size I use is 8inch long 4 inches wide 3inches tall. Fill the Tupperware will just enough water for them to submerse them selves.<br>  <br>  They love to chew up plants so provide them with veggies "the frozen corn peas and carrot" are good. Also it is awesome to watch them tear up a piece of celery. For protein they like the hermit crab food ONLY when soften with water. Also grass yup grass they will tear up grass for ever. I feed mine pasta as a treat every once and a while. “Crabs will eat anything”<br>  <br>  When I got my 1st crab they said that they only live for 2 year tops Most of them will die in captivity after about 7 months. My little colony however lived for 3 years , and who know how old they were when I got them. But they sure are a really fun crab  But YES they take allot of work and most people that sell them say they don't which is so sad. So little is written about them.
LAXxaxAZaa	Just spend time with him. Groom him, hand graze him, and take him for walks.|`|u1HahCoqaa	It takes time, and some horses will never entirely trust you. Which is fine- although we would love to be bestest buddies with our horses, sometimes that just isn't the case, and we just have to make due.

dpK16rvXaa	What a wonderful surprise!  A baby horse is called a foal with no distinction as to sex.  Girls are fillies, and boys are colts.  Foals are easy to care for, just leave them with mom, feed mom well, provide room for the baby to run and play, and give them attention to get them used to people.  They will start eating with mom when ready and just add more as they eat more.  I really don't know about web sites, but there are numerous books on the subject available at libraries or any good feed store.  Good luck with your bonus!|`|735a1fad9c8148cb945ff4708a253a00aa	The vet should come out and check the mare to make sure the placenta is all out.  The foal is a filly. She needs to have the umbilical cord checked too.  There are some shots, which may depend on where you live.  How warm is it where the baby is?|`|iiNAJfGCaa	Definitely have the vet come out. You're lucky the pregnancy and consequent birthing was free of problems! The vet will check the mare, check the foal, and will be able to give you a "starter plan." For right now the mare will take care of her foal. Make sure she is getting plenty of good quality hay and grain as she needs to be producing lots of milk. I would also recommend bedding the stall deeply for the benefit of both dam and filly (proper name for a baby female horse). Good luck!|`|ecf159d9c2d48432e189d0cac81882e2aa	The baby is a foal regardless of gender. A female foal is a filly. <br>  <br>  Call the vet, if you haven't already, and have them come out. Our local vet suggests that foals are visited by the vet in the first 8-12 hours after they are born. When they come out have them tell you what you need to know. <br>  <br>  The actual care of the foal is pretty simple in most aspects - take good care of the mare and she'll take good care of the foal. But there are many things you need to know. It's a very complicated and extensive subject. <br>  <br>  The best thing you can do is have someone explain it to you in person - it will save a lot of confusion and you don't want to misinterpret what someone says for the sake of the mare and foal.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|CBVHd3eHaa	actually a Filly is a female foal. a foal is just a baby horse in general(like puppy or kitten, but for horses) and lastly, a colt is a male foal.<br>  <br>  i'd just buy some books and ask some local people if they can help or contact the old owners and ask them(maybe they bred horses previously and they could help)|`|pzqeLN8eaa	wow thats not too good, not knowing th foal was coming... she is a filly. you should def call out a vet asap and make sure the foal is healthy. it isn't all fun and games taking care of a foal, so your brother should probably find someone who maybe lives around you who can come and help him out.|`|C68dKT0Saa	and they didnt even tell u!?!?!?<br>  well get a vet in asap, he/she will give the lil girl a check up and he/she will tell u wat to do with the filly from then.<br>  <br>  NOTE: a foal is all gender baby horse. a filly is a female foal(baby horse) and a colt is a male foal(baby horse)
IYd6bw7Gaa	First off they do have ceramic dishes in that size.  Infact I have that exact one in the photo.<br>  <br>  I work at Petland and we have all the products you're looking for.  the ceramic dish as well as a water bottle hanger.  You will not need to cut the mesh top as it hooks over the edge of the top of the aquarium. I can't find any pictures of the hanger online but an employee would know what you need.<br>  <br>  10 gallon tanks aren't that heavy when empty.  Why do you want to go with a tank instead?  My personal experience and advice is that aquariums do not offer enough ventilation and start to smell pretty bad over time.  I would reconsider buying a wire cage instead.  Plastic isnt the best of them as they love to chew but they dont typically swallow the plastic, just spit it out.  Also, supplying your hamster with plenty of chew sticks and treats should prevent them from chewing on the cage.  <br>  <br>  I would suggest going in to your local pet store with a list of items you need or have questions on.  A sales associate should be willing to walk through the store with you and help you pick out exactly what you need.
iZyA4hh8aa	1) I currently have two female guinea pigs, and they love each other. Most books/sites suggest two, altho I believe it's a matter of personal preference. I started out with just one, and she was perfectly happy, but then I went back to school and was afraid she'd get lonely so I got her a cage buddy.<br>  <br>  2) Well I use "Sun-Thing-Special" I buy it at my local petstore. I dont know if it's the best, but it has high amounts of vitamin C, which is what they need. There are also many other brands out there. Just make sure to get one with high amounts of Vitamin C and you should be good!<br>  <br>  3) I give my girls a cup of lettuce a day, altho my friend gave her piggie a cup every other day. So once again thats your preference. I would stay away from high amounts of fruits *they are high in sugars* except oranges. Most pet stores will reccommend using Vitamin C drops however this just makes your guinea pig not drink as much, so what I do is I give my girls an orange slice every-other-day so they get enough Vitamin C.<br>  <br>  4) It just depends on the guinea pig, and how many health problems they have. My girls have had to visit the vet several times. Once when I first got my 2nd piggie *because of mites* and then one of them has had to recently because she injured their leg, but otherwise normally not very often.<br>  <br>  5) I use a large cage I got at my petstore *Even tho they arent normally reccomended* its really really large and has a 2nd level *which my girls love* Most people would suggest making a C&C cage altho where I live I cant find the parts to make it, which is why I just bought a cage.<br>  <br>  6) I would say for it to just be spending time with you, about 30 min- to an hour a day. What i usually do is get my girls out and put them on my bed next to me while i do my homework :).<br>  <br>  Hope I helped! :D|`|O4KBKZEkaa	Hi.<br>  <br>  Any Guinea pig pellet is fine. My little guy eats about 1/4 cup per day.He also has a cup of veggies and fruit. he loves romaine lettuce, tomato's(no stalks-poison)He will need Vitamin C so make sure he gets some (through fruit- Scamper loves oranges- about 1/4 orange per day is fine.)<br>  Lets see, Vet- Yearly visits are good but a warning. you may have trouble finding a good qualified Vet. Be sure to ask about qualifications and experience.<br>  <br>  Any cage will do as long as he has room to move around in. He doesn't NEED a cover since they can't jump very high. Even something like a Roughneck Tote box will be acceptable.(Just don't put the cover on it. It should at least come up the sides a few inches because when he gets excited(and he will) you will have bedding everywhere that he kicks out during the "Piggy dance"<br>  <br>  Your friend will let you know when he wants attention. Just be gentle with him.<br>  <br>  Oh yeah. The are social animals so they prefer more then one.If you get more then one you will need a bigger cage. Honestly though one is fine. As long as you give him lots of care he won't be lonely.So it's up to you really.<br>  <br>  So that's it. They make great pets. they are easily spoiled though. So don't run to him for every squeal. He will squeal at 3:00a.M. and keep it up all night. Scamper has learned that lights out means bed time but his previous owners got rid of him because he kept them up all night.  They are great little creatures though. He will make a great pet.<br>  <br>  Oh one more thing. Make sure the bedding you use isn't pine. It's toxic. Ceder is good and it won't hurt him. Scamper is always eating it and he's fine.Good Luck.|`|Ovgp8QxJaa	I have one guinea pig, and personally I think that one is best<br>  They fight sometimes, and if you jsut have the one its going to be much more cuddly and socialble because your going to giving him so much attention. <br>  Just any stuff from walkmart or a pet center works fine. My guinea pig is a little lard butt (lol) so she'll chow down on anything. They prefer fresh veggies and hay (timothy hay, not alphalfa) anyway, so pellets are just for if they need a little extra.<br>  If you give them a little vitamin C everyday, like a piece of orange or apple, thats fine. My baby's favorites are red pepper, lettuce, carrots and sugar peas. Treats like those 2 or 3 times a day. <br>  Ive never taken mine to the vet ever. Shes 6 years old and very healthy, though a little on the lazy side. Unless its a major problem, it should be fine. Just research how to clip his nails and such. <br>  A big one, they like to run around, get one with plastic about 1/4 the way up so he cant kick out the shavings.<br>  Give him LOTS of attention. Guinea pigs are very sociable animals and the more attention, the more lovable they are gonna be back. I take mine out all the time, or just hang with me while I do homework, sometimes we watch movies.|`|Z2vlRSzpaa	1. Guinea pigs need to live in two or more in case you are away and leave them alone (they will have each others company)<br>  <br>  2. When you go to get the pellets, read the bag. I should have things like good vitamins and things like that.<br>  <br>  3. Guinea pigs need to be fed fruits and vegetables twice a day.<br>  <br>  4. They need a vet check up every 4-6 months.<br>  <br>  5. The best type of cage for them would be a C&C cage. Because they have a lot of room and will only cost you $30-40 to build.<br>  <br>  6. You need to hold them AT LEAST onece per day.|`|IYd6bw7Gaa	I'll be honest, I've never had a pet guinea pig but I've had rabbits that lived to be 12 and 14 years old.  I also ahve been working at Petland for over 2 years now and have become the "small animal expert".  <br>  <br>  One or two can be debated but I tend to lean towards 2 for companionship.  Animals acutally live a good year longer if they have a friend.   If you do get two I suggest two females, they are the least likely to fight and of course not get pregnant!  I would talk to a vet about getting them spayed anyway because it has health benefits.  I had two girl bunies spayed and they stopped fighting also reduced the chances of ovarian cancer (yes, they can get that!)  One needs more attention because it can get lonely when you are at school or work (I dont know how old you are but I assume you aren't home all day)<br>  <br>  Oxbow is one fo the best pellets out there.  I like it because it is just the pellet and lots of g pigs like to pick out the seeds and leave the pellets.  Otherwise, our store feeds our g pigs Sunseed.  It is a well balanced diet that I trust.<br>  <br>  For greens, stick to darker greens, more nurtiance, less water.  Kale, parsley and spinach are great!  Lettuce is okay  but itsmostly water so there really is no nutritional value in it.  You wnat to aim for 5-10% of the diet to be fresh veggies and make sure you remove it daily.  <br>  <br>  Alfalfa up to one year of age and timothy hay after that should always be available. Very important part of the diet, and your g pig should always have access to limitless amounts even though it is already the base of most pellets.<br>  <br>  They need their nails trimmed regularly so they dont get caught on the cage and such.  We learned to do the nails ourselves and took our bunnies to the vet once a year for a check up for peice of mind.  But visits to the vet arent necessary unless you notice something abnormal or if he/she stops eating.  That is the first sign of pain.<br>  <br>  The more you hold it the better, you cant give it too much love and affection.  Give it some time to run around outside the cage too.  Just make sure to watch him/her and "g pig proof" the room of wires and anything else that could be hazardous.<br>  <br>  For a cage, something with wire top and sides for adequate ventilation.   <br>  <br>  Best of luck!
QL56syElaa	Lol how cute! I have that same cat bed..I bought it at CVS.<br>  But yea female cats seem to stay much smaller..well most of the female cats that I know. I have two females one is very small and one is very large! The bigger one is lazy and eats more!Their both fully grown.|`|kZ5wWUg2aa	Male cats until they are desexed are called "Tom cats" They tend to have tougher skin and grow quite large. Male cats do tend to be bigger than females but it also depends of environment. Is he a big eater? is he more lazy than her? some things to think about :)|`|NGmRMqe6aa	Toms grow fast until they hit the sexual maturity then they slow down. If you get them fixed they grow longer and get bigger. Females do the same if they are fixed they will get huge also. The size depends on genetics. I think is is because their bodies are not focused on reproduction so when the  sex hormones are stopped the growing keeps on.
e334d47d0cf581231e2545cccfc166e2aa	I really think the best way is to trot on your horse, but when you're not riding, you could do squats and walk/run up stairs.  Another thing that builds quads is to run up hills backwards.  When I was on the rowing team our coach made us do this and it was HARD!  We also ran up a lot of flights of steps .<br>  <br>  Also, you need to work on strengthening your back.  I did a couple of 25 mile rides, and rode a lot of it posting or in 2-point, and could feel it in my back towards the end.|`|pUpPXNzLaa	I would go without sturrips for a while! It will help so much!! :)<br>  Fillies forvever :)|`|1a66e55f2184fe6adca74fb4a9e4fd8caa	You are crazy for wanting to post that long- I much prefer the sitting trot :)<br>  <br>  anyways, you need to just work on posting on your horse a lot as you build up his/her endurance for those long races. The horse needs to be in excellent shape for the longer ones.<br>  <br>    At home, you can do squats- anything that strengthens your abs or calf muscles are good workouts.|`|277f88461e1df8f316c52c480977aaa6aa	try doing a two point for an extended amount of time, you may find it easier on you and your horses back. if you really still want to keep posting, this would still help strengthen your muscles. most people do this instead of trying to post the entire time.  good luck! i never got the chance to run endurance, i hope i do in the future.|`|Zs9PfrDUaa	"YEP"!, POSTING WITHOUT THE SADDLE IS AN EXCELLENT WAY, ALSO, SCRUNCHES- (WHEN NOT ON THE HORSE)-LEG LIFTS, ETC. JOGGING UP HILL......OR IN THE SAND. AND, BE CAREFUL NOT TO OVER WORK YOURSELF!,("BECAUSE YOU CAN!!")- I WOULD KEEP IT DOWN TO THREE TIMES A WEEK, AND THEN THE REST OF THE TIME ON THE HORSE!--(FOR HIS CONDITIONING)..............."GOOD LUCK" AND "GOD-BLESS"!!|`|AA11649443	on the ground <br>  squat and rise <br>  just keep going up <br>  and down like that<br>  ...|`|Avc2oIQ6aa	I don't do any endurance riding, but I do event, and I do need to have good stamina for what I do!!!<br>  <br>  You do not have to do sit trot, but what if you tried getting up in your two-point position to strengthen your legs. Nothing you do is going to be fun or easy when strengthening lol. (very unfortunate haha)<br>  <br>  Also when you are not riding, definitely walk / run outside or on the treadmill, whatever. You can also do some leg exercises to strengthen your calf and thigh muscles.  <br>  <br>  When you are riding, get up in your two-point and try holding yourself  there for small amounts of time, and slowly increasing that time. While you are doing this, have your horse in the trot. <br>  <br>  Do not hold with your knees, but rather by trying to hold yourself up on your stirrups and with your thighs. <br>  <br>  If you have an iPod or MP3 player or something, take that with you to try and take your mind off of it all. =) Good Luck!!|`|4ZcLC6fSaa	you could go to a gym and do some leg presses, its a machine where you like sit back and put your feet on a plate with weights on the sides and do reps of ten. You can add more weight as you get stronger. There is also one where you sit upright and tuck your legs behind a bar that sits about at your ankles and you put weight on it so when you straighten your legs in front of you it includes the added weight, and you can add more as you go to. It's a really good leg workout. You could also try squats with a bar over your shoulders and you put weight on that to try and squat down and then stand up. Good luck in your race!!|`|YAvP9Vgeaa	Keep in mind this will torture your knees!  I know you said off the horse, but have you tried posting without the saddle on the horse?  My instructor used to have me do that and jump too this way.  I would say just do lots of squats holding weights at the same time.  This is the most obvious to me anyway.
CdRlOsnyaa	sounds alot liek a ring neck ( look it up on gogle images to verify this) and it will get to be 10-15 inches full grown hers a good site with info on them snakes <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.uga.edu/srelherp/snakes/diapun.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.uga.edu/srelherp/snakes/diapu...</a>|`|TkJn9gO0aa	Ringneck snakes ARE venomous(although not harmful to humans). <br>  <br>  They get to be about 2 ft long, but are usually about half that size. They like moisture, although not drenched.

3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	I do not like people petting my dogs without asking first.  I ususally don't say anything, but I have opened my mouth when a parent stood by and watched her young child run up behind my dog and grab his tail while out on a walk.  I was livid...and am very glad my dog was tolerant of the child's behavior.<br>  <br>  I always ask before petting someone's dog.  Not just because that is the appropriate thing to do, but also because I would like to be fore warned if this is a dog that may potentially bite my hand off...|`|3de2399999c4d98b0393e8255a669d92aa	I ask before petting someone else's dog, and in general I prefer to be asked before someone else pets my dog. I try to remain aware of people in the area and if they start coming over to me, I try to be proactive in keeping my dog under control.<br>  <br>  We had a Mini Schnauzer who wasn't 100% comfortable around kids, and whenever a kid would see her and start coming over, I'd automatically go down on one knee, get my dog's collar with one hand, and try to guide the kid to petting my dog's shoulder or back instead of her head, to reduce the fear factor for my dog and to reduce the chances of her having a bad reaction.<br>  <br>  Parents should teach their children to ALWAYS ask before petting a stranger's dog.<br>  <br>  You wouldn't want a stranger coming up and picking your child up without asking, would you? Why is a dog any different?|`|Q4UAJLgKaa	No it doesn't bother me if someone wants to pet my dog. They don't need permission. I would never ask them to stop and the worst thing you can do is pull your dog away from the person......what message is being sent to that dog by its owner?<br>  <br>  Everyone adores my German Shepherd. He plays Frisbee with everyone he meets.  <br>  If a person isn't inerested or afraid of him. I'll tell him that 'they don't want to play Frisbee' and he doesn't bother them.<br>  <br>  He's never on a leash. He's Obedience and Distraction trained so I don't even take a leash most times or places.<br>  <br>  Our city is off leash everywhere.<br>  <br>  No, I don't ask a dog owner if I can pet their dog. Long before the dog gets to me I've read his body language and know exactly where it's coming from. I love all dogs and they seem to know it. I've never had a problem with any dog nor have I ever been afraid of one.<br>  <br>  Dogs behind fences protecting their property I don't tempt. I admire them.<br>  <br>  If a dog appears to want to be aggressive with my GS he lets out a short quiet growl and every one of them back off and settle down and decide arguing with him is not something they want to do after all.<br>  I wish I knew what he's telling them. It always works.<br>  <br>  He has always ignored any dog that wanted to fight....they are dogs on leashes every time.|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	My dogs are very human friendly and I trust them so I don't worry if people pet without asking and I don't pull my dogs away which is probably more likely to cause a problem anyway.  I do however think it is foolish and rude for people to pet an unknown dog without asking and I personally always ask.|`|ceebbd5b347bf3b3c44701e742d76f97aa	I think it's rude. The other person probably means it to be an ice breaker but it is just poor manners.<br>  <br>  Since dogs belong to their owners, the polite thing is always to ask permission before touching. <br>  <br>  You wouldn't just touch someone's baby, car, or purse without a nod.|`|81675c7bcc2aa81478472216e01229f7aa	It does bother me.  I usually just continue on my way.  I always ask before I approach a strange dog.<br>  <br>  When I was a little girl I would always go up to dogs and pet them until one time I was told not to because it was a "service dog in training".  Ever since then, I always ask.<br>  <br>  ADD:<br>  Wow!  I didn't realize most felt this way.  I'm glad you asked this!|`|6SeWCfUfaa	Yes, that annoys the ^&*^% out of me.  I'm mean though.  I'll say something like "whoa, careful, he's not always as friendly as he looks."  <br>  <br>  That's totally not true, my dog is a love lush, but it back people off lol.<br>  <br>  And yes, of course, I ask before petting someone else's dog.  The only acceptions to that are dogs of people I know well and the ones at the dog park that make it totally apparent they want to say hi.  I wouldn't walk over and just start petting someone else's dog though.<br>  <br>  Oh and yea, I can't stand people who allow their dogs to drag them over to say hi to another dog when the dogs are on leash.  Joey CAN be leash aggressive.  He thinks a dog bargin in like that is rude too and will sometimes tell them about it.<br>  <br>  Oh and for those who don't "get" why it would bother me.  My dogs focus should be on me when he's with me.  He's a working dog.  I need him to be focused on me.  You don't go petting disabled people's dogs for this reason either.  It takes their focus away from their masters.  <br>  <br>  Those who are like .. oh, it's ok .. have never trained a dog for a "job."  Or they'd know better.|`|ErjSVRkqaa	No. My dogs friendly or else I would have a muzzle on her. I don't see why it would bug anyone....I guess I will find out! :) <br>  <br>  Cute story(dosent really relate though) : There were these 2 little boys with their dad. One was probably 4 or 5 and the other was probably about 7. I could hear the oldest boy telling the younger one, "Now, the first rule to petting dogs it you gotta ask the person." I thought that was adorable. When they got to me and my dog the youngest asked and I said yes. My dog licked the little boys face and I told her not to and the dad said, "oh shes just being friendly." ---that's what I hate, when people say, "oh your dogs fine" maybe  I don't want my dog getting in peoples faces like that.<br>  <br>  EDIT::: i usually dont pet other peoples dogs but if the dog is off the leash and comes up to me wagging his tail i pet him on the head....but i realized that sometimes they look startled. so i dont really pet them much anymore unless the owner says its okay.|`|SfuHU3Gpaa	I find it rude for anyone to pet a dog without permission. I would never go pet a stranger's dog without their "okay." You don't know if that dog is HA (human aggressive) or has fear aggression (that could be from a stranger petting him).<br>  <br>  I don't like it when stranger's pet my dogs and I expect grown-adults to ask, but I am more forgiving of children, but I do explain to them why it's important to ask.<br>  <br>  These things don't bother me as much as owner's letting their dogs come up to yours without even asking. That bothers me to no end.|`|16XpYCBmaa	It would not bother me but my dog will not let any strangers around her she growls and acts like she is going to attack them. But it wouldn't bother me i want my dog to be more friendly. And if I see a dog I don't go up and pet them I just say aww your dog is so cute. And why would it bother someone it is not like they are trying to hurt your dog all they want to do it pet the dog.|`|GX40df3yaa	It bothers me, because they do it and dont ask, then your dog bites them and they sue you, even though they didnt have permission.  My dogs are not mean, they are just leary towards strangers.  Especially if they are coming in on they like a hawk.  I have little 8 pound dogs, so they are pretty scared when something big is coming down on them.|`|XIH2oKtJaa	omg i hate it! i've had some lady bent over clapping her hands and clacking her mouth with a big joyous face on as if they're her grandchildren who she hasn't seen for months. the dogs both start getting fussy and pulling on their halti's, staffie starts jumping. on this occasion i have to admit i told the loon to leave my dogs alone but when i walked by she still stroked him. i could have kicked her. i hate it when i say leave him he'll jump and they say 'oh i don't mind'... grrr i mind! i don't let my dog jump up people i know so why should i let him jump up randoms. one time though the above happened so i let him jump and he popped the guys lip. may seem bad but i giggled and said to myself i told you so. what do you expect when you excite them that much.<br>  oh and the worst is definitely when they ignore you and stroke your dog for what seems like forever. i tend to just pull my dogs away from people and they get the idea but i will tell them to leave if i have to.<br>  and i always ask if i want to pet someones dog! :)|`|ivIQl6Awaa	It doesn't usually bother me with my dog because she ignores them.  But I don't like when people let their kids do it.  It's a really bad example I think.   If I see little kids looking at my dog I ALWAYS offer, and say "you can go ahead and pet her, she likes kids".  I hope that they get the idea to ask.  I usually ask unless the dog is sniffing and all up to me...then i assume the person doesn't care!!!|`|pyqgEbmsaa	I don't really care one way or another.. I raise my dogs so that they are tolerant of strangers.. they are used to people ooohing and ahhhing over them. If kids do it, I always remind them that although my dogs are nice, not all dogs are nice and they shouldn't run up on them and pet strange dogs.|`|UE4WbmtQaa	yes i find it rather irritating. sometimes i just smile and let them pet him if its a little kid because they dont know better. however if its someone older i walk away or i go to the other side of the street if i see them coming. yes always ask before petting someones dog!|`|cnZlMojUaa	It always bothered me that everyone, especially kids would rush to our little rescue (who recently passed away) and want to pet and hug her. She was a very cute dog, but it was obvious when she would back away and cower that she was not comfortable with strangers. My male would be standing there doing his Scottie bounce, wagging is tail and play bowing, but no, strangers didn't want to pet the friendly dog. My rescue would be fine if she was in my arms, so I would typically scoop her up and hold her. For the most part, children who were with their parents would ask to pet the dogs, usually without a parent reminding them.<br>  <br>  I do want people I don't know to ask to pet my dogs. I know certain children in the neighborhood and they don't always ask now, but the dogs know them. I do ask before petting someone else's dog.|`|PM23RDycaa	Yes it does. Whether it has been my own pets I have been walking or other people's as a favor or while petsitting/dog walking i find it HIGHLY annoying.<br>  <br>  Unlike the people above me I do find it to be a problem with children do it and I don't let them slide. I will get between them and the dog and tell them that that first need to ask permission of their parents and then ask permission of ME if its ok to pet said dog. While they are petting their dog I will tell them that they ALWAYS need to ask permission before petting a dog they do not know no matter how cute it is.<br>  <br>  I always ask before petting anyone else's dog and I make my son do the same. With adults who should know better I will move the dog out of the way while explain that if they intend to pet my dog they need to ask first as a courtesy.|`|tI0rkxeuaa	I never let someone pat my dog without first asking and if they try to I will ask them not to.<br>  <br>  My main reason is that I just find it very rude.  As I know my dog wont bite them.<br>  <br>  Generally speaking though most people don't just pat my dog as she is a Rhodesian Ridgeback and for some reason most people seem to be intimidated by her.|`|SiaWY5n2aa	people should ask first before they touch a dog they dont know. after our shepherd had puppies she went from nice and sweet to vicious as hell to protect the puppies. dogs go through moods and you never know when ur dog may be having a bad day and go off and bite someone. people need to learn to ask. it bothers me and if i see a dog i always ask first before i go near the dog. and if i do pet the dog i NEVER keep the owner for too long by asking 21 questions. that just rude as hell lol|`|gJlxZdL5aa	I don't bother other people and their dogs and I don't appreciate it when they bother us and our dogs.<br>  <br>  Its bothers me and I just want to scream...but I don't<br>  <br>  I pick my dog up or turn and walk my dog in a different direction....if they don't get the hint....I tell them no they can't.<br>  <br>  I don't pet peoples dogs that I don't know but if I want to I do ask.|`|2u8teJkJaa	I always ask before I pet some ones dog. My dog is a therapy dog so I am used to and so is she to strangers petting her and she loves it. The only time it bothers me is if its a total monster child and I get her away from them.
GuOJIftAaa	Ok, I'm only going to answer one of your questions and that's on how often they have babies.<br>  <br>  A female mouse can have 10+ babies in a litter. As soon as that litter is born, she can have babies again. So that would be another 10+ babies in a few weeks. Snakes don't eat that often so by the time you were through with the first litter, the other litter would be too big for your smaller snakes and not big enough for you bigger snakes.<br>  <br>  Its best to just stick to buying mice when needed. Also, I hope you're feeding f/t mice or pre-killed. Snake owners who feed live without a good reason (like the snake will starve itself without live food) aren't proper snake owners. You risk serious injury to your snakes or death and its a inhumane death for the mouse.<br>  <br>  Also, a 10 gallon will NOT work for very long. At first it will, but after that, you'll have to move up to a much larger one.

That MAY help - not a guarantee, though.<br>  <br>  Keep them separated and contact a behavioral specialist.|`|IPlvWyDFaa	Are they neutered? If not, that is the first place I would start. That generally cuts down on a lot of the aggression. Also, I would suggest that you remove anything that could cause problems - such as food (feed them in separate areas), toys, or anything that they might fight over. If you have done all those things and they still fight, you may have to get rid of one of them to avoid serious injury or worse.|`|7FQH8pcYaa	cut there nut off and see were that goes other wise don't trip their males, that's what we do. if to scared keep them separated.|`|11PAFD9Caa	Contact a trainer or dont put them together.<br>  <br>  From what I have read, you can break up a dog fight by leashing one dog around any available body part and tie him to something then go to the other dog and grab him by the rear area lifting his hind legs off the ground and wait for them to let go of each other to pull.<br>  <br>  I know that sounds nuts but I have heard it works.

BUt I will explain to you a technique to separate them once they are fighting. First thing you will need to do is the next time your sitting and petting your dog feel around the front portion of the throat you will find that there is a void there it feels like a "hole" this is basically the equivalent to a adams apple. If your dogs are locked up NEVER EVER PULL THEM APART. Carefully reach around the throat slip your thumb into the void an apply pressure ( don't push don't jab apply pressure) this will  cause the dog to choke and release as it cuts off they're air supply and induces the gag reflex. Pull the dog up and turn the head away from the other dog and keep them apart while you check for injuries.|`|DYvYvidGaa	well i know your looking the the most reasonable answer but i just have two say why two male pitbulls its in thier nature to fight dogs ..well i think that there just trying to despuit who is the alpha male in the pack and them fighting establishes it and maintains it well..for your answer i would say go to the vet ..get them castrated|`|5a1c8253181a8adf5c06c0040d8f981eaa	First off...are they neutered?

My own two boys came to me quite sick with a respiratory infection; one died within a week. (R.I.P., Santa Fe.) They were adopted from an extremely low-budget animal shelter. I cannot even begin to count how many people I personally know who have witnessed obviously ill rats in pet stores, or who have purchases sickly rats from pet stores. That's why the best places to get rats are from genuine rat rescues who strive to give the best care to their charges (I got my newer boy from one such rat rescue, called "Mainely Rat Rescue;" they neuter/spay as many rats as possible to help prevent accidental pregnancies) or serious breeders who breed for temperament, health and sound body.<br>  <br>  Also, I don't really recommend putting the antibiotics in the water. You have absolutely no way of knowing if he's ingesting the correct amount. Antibiotics should be administered by hiding it in a food or through force-feeding. (Foods like Cool Whip, syrup, yogurt and baby food work best. Just mix a little bit on a spoon with the antibiotic. However, remember that doxycycline should not be mixed into anything containing significant amounts of calcium, such as yogurt.) If you absolutely cannot trick the rat into eating the medicine, gently, firmly wrap him in a towel so that he can't struggle or resist. Carefully, slowly feed the antibiotic through the corner of his mouth with a syringe. (Obviously, not a syringe with a needle.)<br>  <br>  Obtain a humidifier. As with humans, the moist air will make it easier for him to breathe. Likewise, try to bring him into the bathroom when you take hot showers, the steam helps with congestion.<br>  <br>  Buy some echinacea extract. I've heard there's a non-alcoholic, fruit-flavored one for kids that rats like, but I couldn't find it, so I got plain, non-alcholic liquid extract from a vitamin/health store. Anyway, echinacea boosts the immune system. Give him two or three drops once a day for one week. Then skip two weeks. Then give it to him for one week. It's one week on, two weeks off, one week on, two weeks off.<br>  <br>  Consider the bedding you're using. It may be too dusty for him, or he may be allergic to it. I know several rats who sneeze on CareFresh (due to dust) and others who sneeze on aspen (due to an allergy). <br>  <br>  Change the bedding every other day to prevent ammonia build-up irritating his respiratory system. Change the nesting material in his favorite sleeping areas every day. (They tend to pee there the most.)<br>  <br>  I'm sure you know enough not to have him in a tank, but just in case, if so, get a new cage. Tanks provide horrific ventilation.<br>  <br>  Hold him up to your ear and listen carefully for absolutely anything that sounds "off." A clicking sound, a congested noise, gurgling, wheeziness -- if you hear anything like that, he requires vet attention as soon as possible.<br>  <br>  Oh, and what antibiotics are you giving him? Are they vet-prescribed? You can't really give antibiotics willy-nilly, as the rat will build up an immunity to them, and they'll be ineffective when you really need them. Also, if he does have a respiratory infection, I personally prefer a Baytril/doxycycline combo, as far as antibiotics go.<br>  <br>  Pay attention to his nose, eyes and coat. You'll have to look very, very carefully. When rats are ill or stressed, they produce a red mucous called porphyrin. You may find this around the eyes or on the nose. However, if he's been grooming, you won't really see it, or it may be rubbed into his coat. Also, his coat is smooth and normal, right? Sick rats often have scruffy coats because they aren't feeling well enough to groom.<br>  <a href="http://www.ratballs.com/RatTails/Tails081.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ratballs.com/RatTails/Tails08...</a>|`|GuOJIftAaa	Rats will sneeze when they're brought into a new home. Its just the new environment. If they show extra poryphin (sp?) stains (their red mucus around their eyes and nose) then you should consider taking him to the vet. The "new home sneezes" usually last for about a week or two. <br>  <br>  We just got two new baby boys and they sneezed quite often when we first got them, now nine days later, they never sneeze. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|WMIAv1N4aa	Your best bet is to observe him over the next couple of days<br>  <br>  hopefully nothing will happen,<br>  <br>  But if the vet says that it is fine why not believe him/her<br>  <br>  Good luck

xe7mylLmaa	The first thing you will notice is a sudden decrease in appetite, causing the iguana to get thin in the legs and tail but it will look as if it has a full tummy.  As the eggs near the end of their development, the shells develop and the eggs can be felt by gently palpating the belly.  Its advisable to supplement extra calcium during this time as the iguana will need it to form the egg shells, which need to be as strong as they can get!  Dehydration is also a potential problem during this time.  Once your female lays eggs, it will occur each year thereafter unless complications require the animal to be spayed.<br>  <br>  Next you will notice the iguana will become obsessed with finding a place to dig.  It may spend hours a day searching, clawing at everything it can find looking for a suitable place to lay.  It is advisable during this time to try and provide your female with a sizable tub of dirt to dig around in (see: throw everywhere).  Hopefully the iguana will choose this place to lay although it is not unusual for an iguana to lay eggs in a totally different place - much to the chagrin of the owner.<br>  <br>  You need to be extremely aware of your iguana's behavior during this time.  Egg binding or busted eggs inside your iguana will kill them and is a leading cause of death.  You must pay close attention to the iguana's feces both before and after egg laying.  If you see signs of broken eggs or find eggs in the feces after laying, you can waste no time in getting your iguana to a vet.  Surgery is required to remove remaining eggs which are toxic to your iguana.<br>  <br>  Some females will develop eggs, exhibit decreased appetite and digging/searching behavior, but then re-absorb the eggs into their bodies before the egg shells develop.|`|CdRlOsnyaa	Female iguanas if they are at least 10inches SVL can become gravid and produce eggs but the eggs will not be fertile. Iguanas usually slow down around breeding season for eating, most females because there belly is full of eggs will usually not eat much of anything. If you put the wrist palm of your hand at the vent area you can usually notice the shape of eggs depending on how far along your female is. If all goes good for your female, after she has laid the eggs, please make sure that you do have an X-Ray done after, to make sure that she did lay all her eggs. Hopefully you have a herp/reptile vet how has seen a few female iguanas to know what she is doing.<br>  My female iguana her first breeding gravid/egging season she had to be spayed, and good thing she was because she did have ruptured eggs, which all female iguana owners know ruptured eggs can kill your female.<br>  If the female is gravid, hopefully you will have a proper living space and can provide a proper nesting box space.<br>  You should at least use a 30gallon tote, children play sand, water to moisten the sand, heating pads.<br>  <a href="http://www.anapsid.org/iguana/egging.htm..." rel="nofollow">http://www.anapsid.org/iguana/egging.htm...</a><br>  <br>  If you chose to incubate the eggs if they are fertile (mated w/ a male) the instructions on how to do that is w/ the link above.

qOiv8d3Laa	Grooming is a sign of affection.  It's a "bonding" thing, too.  If cats do not get along with each other, they do not groom each other.  If they do get along well, they will groom each other.  I have 3 cats who refuse to groom each other.  They don't sleep together, etc.  They just merely tolerate each other and share the mutual space.  Such are the ways of the cat! (the "Tao" of the cat!)<br>  <br>  <br>  Me... kittyslave23...

pyqgEbmsaa	It's not gonna blow up, but you need to always take puppies to the vet for a checkup after they are born.

Ms8b2kISaa	Kong toys are really great, and they have quite a few different styles of them now, too. You can fill them with all kinds of goodies, like your dog's favorite treats, his food, peanut butter, Kong Stuff'n Paste, and Kong Snaps treats. Also, I recently got a really cool "puzzle" like toy for my dog from Jeffers. Their website is www.jefferspet.com, and I'm not exactly sure what you should type in as a search word, maybe it would just be with the toys, but they had about 6 different ones. Most of them were like a puzzle, where you filled it and the dog had to move different shapes out of the way, or move the toy in a certain way to get the treats or food bits out. If this is too complicated for him, which is EXACTLY what I thought about my guy when I first bought it, you can try the kinds of toys they have (also on this website) that just hold between 1-3 cups of your dog's food, and it comes out a few pieces at a time as they roll it around, to keep them busy and full! Hope this helps! Good luck!|`|6SeWCfUfaa	Dogs are pretty simple.  They like "new" stuff.  It can be the same kind of tennis ball, but if it's new, it's more exciting than the old one.  <br>  <br>  Dogs are also kinda funny in that, if you put some of their toys away where they can't find them for a while, they act almost as if it's a new toy when you take it back out a month later.

Also, try alternating toys or taking toys away so that they become 'special'.

Or freeze them with plain yogurt to make them last longer!<br>  <br>  My personal favorite, the Treakstik.  A little more difficult to find but just google it and purchase online (that is the correct spelling.)  Put the puppy's breakfast kibble in there and let him roll it all over the floor until it all comes out while you're at work.<br>  <br>  If he is kept in a room, just toss a handful of kibble and let the puppy practice using his nose to find a goodie!|`|U1RcZjqJaa	If you haven't tried the kong I would do that.

At 8 years old the oscar is already old so the 20 will not be a good idea at all because it will stress him to the point that he will be miserable. I am not one of these people that will fuss at you for getting the idea to put him in a small tank but i am just being honest with you, take care.|`|3bf821ff353c216ffc93ff7a91b60828aa	As mentioned, and I'm only reiterating what Ian and Dark said just to make the point, 55 gallons as a minimum for 1 oscar.<br>  <br>  And, over filtration is needed.  Meaning, 1 filter rated for a 55 gallon isn't enough.<br>  <br>  And, the oscar is stunted.  He really should be closer to 14 inches.

UvzKiis0aa	Cats.  Cats were worshiped as gods by the ancient Egyptians for their prowess at keeping the pest population down which protected the people's food source.  Cats can see in the dark, they can leap up to 10 times their height, they can climb.  They are easily trained to use a litter box and are usually quiet and sweet.  Cats are independent but loving.  Leonardo Da Vinci said that they were works of art by themselves with their grace and beauty.  <br>  <br>  Dogs are noisy, stinky, clumsy, and dirty.  I am sick of hearing them yap, bark, bay and whine.  I hate dodging dog poops on sidewalks, trails and my lawn.  I hate it when dogs charge at me barking their heads off when I am walking on the public sidewalk while their owners say, "Don't worry, he won't bite."  Meanwhile I have been scared out of my wits because I think I am about to be mauled by an unleashed dog.  <br>  <br>  My indoor cats bother no one, poop in their box, and are generally ten times better than any dog I have seen.  They are beautiful and return every bit of love I give them ten times over.|`|ad3b5cd523444e3461eb988f6ede1f97aa	cats , they are very independant you can leave and go to a friends house or work or where ever you want to go, leave them food , and water and you dont have to worry about poop all day long in the house they are less trainable , and also have a mystery side to them dogs are loving and will come when you call them , a cat may take a number and call you later , but you can train them to come to you when you want to mine does , and guess what ?? he even walks on a leash, greets me at the door as well just like a dog i have a ragdoll siamese hang in there cat lover  , you are number 1|`|AA12095067	I prefer dogs.<br>  <br>  Cats are beautiful creatures, but I don't consider them to be suitable as pets.|`|uetqUAEvaa	I am fond of dogs.

YnCUyvK7aa	It's hard to tell what you're seeing without a picture or knowing what kind of anemone this is.<br>  <br>  Anemones have a central mouth, and in some kinds this can be raised upward like in this picture.  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/payalvora/357711733/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/photos/payalvora/3...</a><br>  <br>  The mouth is also their anus, so it might be regurgitating it's last meal.  <br>  <br>  Anemones need to have very intense lighting, so I hope you have something other than a normal fluorescent light on your tank.  Metal halide is the best for larger tanks, you might be able to make due with a T5 high output if your tank is 30-40 gallons or under.  If you don't have this kind of lighting or can't afford to get it soon, I'd advise returning the anemone.|`|6979bf0ecfe9ee379c6d4efa120ff381aa	I agree with a previous poster , this is not a good sign , if you can return it .

TE73SFblaa	Well I dont own a bulldog but I've had experiance in this area.My Qestion to you would be how old are your cats?See this makes a difference cause if they are grown already they are already set in there ways.And might not like the dog at all ever.But if they are kittens or still young and you get the dog as a puppy .They can grow up with each other and have no problem.I had a kitten my dad had a german shepard pup they grew up together and were best buddies.But after my cat  passed that dog never got along with another cat.And my cat whenever being around other dogs  hated them.So it all depends on the age how close they will be in a realtionship with one another.Bulldogs are passive and lazy for the most part kind of dogs .So i dont see the dog starting anything but you cats you might have to watch.Good luck!|`|WPYRSSlQaa	my bulldog hates cats ever since he was 8 Weeks he has been chasing them out the yard

jinAwMGNaa	I know nothing about the breed but they look like large Pit Bulls.  If they have the same characteristics as a Pit, they will make an excellent Guard Dog and companion.  Pits get a raw deal as some are misused, fought, and inbred to stupid.  Some of those fall through the cracks and are released to the public that should be euthanized.

Most of these people on here have no idea as to what they are talking about.  I have had dogos for over two years and I will have them for the rest of my life.<br>  <br>  Amazing guard dogs.  They accept NO ONE until you accept them.  These dogs are super intelligent and do wonders with positive reinforcement training.<br>  <br>  Ex I was in bed sleeping my husband was gone with a friend and our friend got to the house before my husband did.  My dogs even knowing this friend very well knew that I was sleeping and my husband wasn't here.  The friend walked in and my dogs barked till I approved the friend.  My dogs never hurt the friend just backed him into a corner until the friend had approval.  This was a proud proud day for me.  I know how my dogs get not knowing someone and always wondered what they would do in the event someone we knew came around without permission.  I have never felt safer!  <br>  <br>  As far as not good with kids that is bs.  Anyone who has done research on this breed knows that they were bred with high tolerance for pain.  Thus making them awesome with kids.  Even if we are playing fetch and my dogs are running around they stop dead in their tracks when my three year old comes around.  I haven't had to train this into them, its just always been this way.<br>  <br>  Check out the official dogo kenel club website at www.dogo,org.  Good luck.  I absolutely love this breed!  It will always be my first choice.|`|7j4IJi1Qaa	Yeah they make good guard dogs.  Other good guard dogs are:<br>  A German Shepard and a Doberman.  Don't encourage it to be aggressive they are naturally aggressive.  And make sure you socialize them when they are young around other dogs and kids.

I've seen "guard dog" breeds who were scared of other people. They may be naturally protective of their home and family, but that doesn't mean every dog of the breed will be. But if we are speaking in general terms, then yes they are a good guard dog. A reputable breeder who has done a P.A.T. will be able to tell you the dog's personality and if the individual dog will be a good guard dog.<br>  <br>  If you are interested in a Dogo Argentino, you will have to train him and socialize him correctly. Also do tons of research before thinking about buying this breed and check your local laws to see if they happen to be a banned breed.<br>  <br>  They are a lovely and gorgeous breed!|`|FWK26qp5aa	yes a great gaurd dog but not so great family pet. If you have no kids they would be excellent. If youhave kids ide be very careful to train dog and keep doors locked so you can keep an eye on the kiddies at all times. Over here in australia we cant even get the dogo as they are banned in the whole country. So just be wary of your local laws also
AA11608079	My dog is a bit smaller. Directions were to take it with a meal as it binds to the newly ingested food and does not remove existing levels... the goal is to reduce the intake to help balance things out. I have a 13 pound fluffy Shitsui with deformed Kidneys. He also has been prescribed Citricol to reduce elevated calcium and creatine levels.<br>  <br>  I am not a VET - we have been to many and after moving found one that really wants to help our dog and us. He had been vomiting 3-5 times a weekbefore we started any meds. <br>  <br>  -Working with my vet we started him on 2 mls of Alternagel for each meal and over time and checking blood work results reduced that by half a ml each time. Over the course of 6 months we have gotten his levels across the board to much better levels.<br>  <br>  My dog is doing much better and is maintaining  at .5 ml dosage with each meal.

Alternatively add a few drops of either menthol or citrus scented essential oil to some cotton wool, and then smear that over the wires.  Cats hate these scents and it should be enough to deter him from getting close.|`|GEfUTyi8aa	My friends had this same problem.... they tried everything as well... what worked was catnip toys.. they kept him supplied with fresh catnip toys and eventually the wires were no more fun..... he quit cold turkey on the wires..... chewing wires is sometimes a sign of boredom..... sure you can spray him with water... yell, chase..... put bitter tasting stuff on the wires ..... and one of these things may work.... but if not, try giving him these toys.... a few balls filled with catnip.... a chewy cloth toy..... maybe even get one of those pole things with the sting with a catnip toy on the end... and suction it to the wall, fridge or whatever..... if he is busy, he wont bother your wires.<br>  <br>  good luck.....|`|Rw7gi86Naa	Kittens in particular are very curious and play with everything that comes in their way.  Remember that they are inexperienced like toddlers and try everything at least once.  Make your home as kitten-proof as possible. Keep an eye on kittens when they are young and very inquisitive. Dangling cords are particular attracting to them and dangerous if chewed through.  Electric shock can be the result.<br>  <br>  - Put something distasteful on the cord to discourage chewing.<br>  - Tabasco sauce, cayenne pepper, bitter apple/orange, orange/lemon peel, commercial repellents.<br>  - Gaffer’s tape, (available in DIY stores) will probably work if the substances don't.<br>  - Secure exposed cords.<br>  - Consider permanent wiring if you own your place.<br>  <a href="http://www.catcatcat.com/behav5.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.catcatcat.com/behav5.html</a><br>  <br>  Chewing on these cords poses hazards to your cat, from minor shock to death. Cats primarily chew on cords out of boredom, especially if left alone during the day. Try to provide plenty of "play-alone" toys for your cat or kitten, including wall or door mounted toys they can swat or bat around, cat towers to explore, with attached toys for added interest, even an arrangement of cardboard boxes on the floor to form a tunnel, with holes cut through the sides. <br>  To handle the cord situation itself, you need to devise a way to cover the cords, discourage access to them, or make them unpalatable for chewing. <br>  - Cover the cords: Many computer supply stores carry pre-split hollow tubing for covering cords and electrical wires, as well as kits for managing computer cords. If you're handy with a utility knife, you can purchase flexible poly tubing in several diameters, in most building supply or hardware stores. Slit one side of the tubing, then cut it to length for each cord. You might also try larger "corrugated" tubing to run several wires through, if that works for you. <br>  - Discourage access to the cords: Try applying several rows of double-sided sticky tape to the floor surrounding a large cord tangle (such as frequently happens with computers). Cats will be reluctant to walk across the tape. Another excellent tool for keeping cats out of any undesirable area is the SssCat! cannister by Multivet. This product is a three-pronged training tool which works with a motion detector atop the cannister which triggers a high-pitched alarm and a quick spray of harmless material. It's a lot more expensive than bitter apple spray, but well worth the cost in its versatility for training purposes. <br>  - Make the Cords Taste Bad: By far one of the best training tools for any kind of destructive chewing is bitter apple spray. It is guaranteed to leave a bad taste in your cats mouth, one that he won't long forget.|`|50sKeUe2aa	I had the same problem! There's a product called Bitter Apple that will help stop the chewing... <a href="http://www.bitterapple.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bitterapple.com/</a><br>  <br>  ALSO, if you want to fix the wires and appliances that are already chewed, you can do it yourself at home for just pennies. It's easy too! I did it.<br>  <br>  Here is a step-by-step how-to: <a href="http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/1466997/repair_cables_your_cat_chewed_through.html?cat=53" rel="nofollow">http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...</a>|`|QL56syElaa	Well some people will dissapprove of this but when you catch your cat chewing on wires get its attention to SToP THEN spray it on the back with a spray bottle of water!..Eventually he'll notice it only happens when hes chewing wires..then he'll stop..<br>  And sometimes toys/catnip wont work because some cats prefer to play with household items such as lids..wires..bags..etc..LLike my cats who wont touch their toys!!!..Darn cats!|`|NGmRMqe6aa	Wrap bare wire with electrical tape and all  accessible wires with aluminum foil.

Protect yourself from scams and don't be fooled into buying an overpriced, possibly sick puppy.<br>  <br>  Craig list is NOT  a good deal-they are puppy mills, backyard breeders and irresponsible breeder who advertise on there!<br>  <br>  Adopting is a term only when you go to the shelter, pound or rescue, buying is when you buy from other sources!<br>  <br>  If a puppy does not teeth on your possesions, it will teeth on you and your children. Rescuers often get calls from panicked parents sure their dog is about to seriously injure their children.  It usually turns out the puppy is just doing what puppies do, i.e., mouth or nip. Parents, too emotional to see the difference, just want to get rid of the dog.  A growing puppy is going to put anything and everything in their mouth. It must be taught bite inhibition. As the puppy grows, the puppy's jaws become stronger and its teeth are replaced by its adult teeth.  The mouthing and nipping it did as a puppy now can have serious consequences.  Far better to get an adult dog 2years+ that has "been there, done that, moved <br>  on." <br>  <br>  With an adult dog, you have a dog that can go everywhere and do anything with you NOW.  You don't have to wait until the puppy grows up and hope it will like to do what you to do with it.  With an adult rescue, you select the dog most compatible with you.  You can find one that  travels well, loves to play with your friends' dogs, has excellent house manners, etc. You can come home after a long day's work and spend your time on a relaxing walk, ride, or swim with your new best friend (rather than cleaning up after a small puppy.)<br>  <br>  Bond - Rescue Dog Bond.  Dogs that have been uprooted from their happy homes or have not had the best start in life are likely to bond very closely to their new owner.  Yes, dogs that have lost families through death, divorce or lifestyle change can go through a mourning process; however, once they become attached to their new family, they seem to want to please as much as possible to make sure they are never homeless again!  Those dogs that are just learning about the good life and good people seem to bond even deeper. They know what life on the streets, life on the end of a chain, or worse, is about, and they revel and blossom in a nurturing , loving environment. Most rescues make exceptional , extremely loyal companions.|`|t9Fxx75uaa	<a href="http://www.petfinder.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.petfinder.com</a> or <a href="http://www.1-800-save-a-pet.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.1-800-save-a-pet.com</a>  Put your zip code in and you will find a shelter near you.  <br>  Now that being said.  I got my puppy (mixed breed) from the 1-800 site but it took me to this site.  <a href="http://www.rvadoptions.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.rvadoptions.com</a>  They are based in the south (Arkansas and surrounding states).  I filled out the application and they got back to me in 2 days.  That all started Nov 2 of 2007.  They had a dog that I already wanted so I did pay pal with them and they shipped the dog to me on Nov 9, 2007.  He was 9.5 weeks old and 2.5 lbs..  He's a beagle terrier mix and the bestest dog I've ever had.  They charge for the dog, the crate, the trip to the airport and the vet check up.  He had his first set of shots and was wormed but I had to take him to my vet the next day and they continued with the worming and later the shots etc.  I recommend them highly.  They've contacted me at about a year and asked for a picture of him and we stay in touch loosely.  I dealt with Nikki but there are other foster moms too.  Great place, they save puppies that would not get homes in that area.  So, if you don't see a pup on there that you like, just keep going back as the site is updated daily.  Last nite they didn't have too many but sometimes they have 20 or 30 so maybe fill out the app so when you see a pup you like, you'll already be approved.

CqQ1DaKDaa	Lots of people keep rabbits inside with a variety of pets. I would be very cautious and not leave your rabbit alone with the dogs; however, rabbits and cats tend to get along very well. But there is always a risk because of the fact that dogs and cats are predators naturally, and rabbits are prey.<br>  Is there a room in your house that is not used often by your other pets? Such as a bedroom etc. I would place the rabbit in an indoor cage in that room. But remember, that rabbit will need to be let out at least two hours a day ideally.<br>  Ask your vet for the best ways to introduce the rabbit to its new suroundings and family. The rabbit can cope with other animals.<br>  However, if you have yet decided on a bunny to get, I would advice a much larger breed, if not a giant rabbit. As the smaller a rabbit is, the more fragile it is, and I'd worry very much about a small bunny with all those carnivore animals.<br>  Good Luck<br>  Raych|`|k4WkFZM0aa	I have 4 dogs a cat,3 cocktails,and a parrot along with a rabbit.At first the rabbit might be scared of the noise but after a while it will adapt and not really care.Best thing to do is to put the rabbit in a room and see how it reacts.If it is scared move it out side or to another room.
4a4b9be516eeab81005bf8f97c61e37aaa	A licensed or certified veterinary technician usually commands a higher salary than one who is office-trained.<br>  <br>  Some vets would like to have someone qualified to be "up and running" when they start to work for them.<br>  If you can administer fluids, give injections, do testing for diseases, bandage and/or care for a caged animal you can be a very productive member of a vet team right away.  Training in those basic techniques and experience doing them with give you lots of confidence too.|`|Net8og9Baa	Really with the way the law and the "culture" within veterinary medicine is going, you should look into becoming a Certified (or Registered or Licensed, depending on the state) Veterinary Technicians.  Many vets will not hire anyone that is not Certified, unless they are in school to become certified.<br>  <br>  You can try to find a job that will train you in basic veterinary assistant skills (you can learn everything you would learn through a class), but you might not have very good luck.|`|kZ5wWUg2aa	I have been a vet nurse (assistant) for 8 years. I have been trained on the job. Some vets like to train you their own ways and dont like you taking classes. It will well worth you doing the training becuase you also learn a lot in classes to.

There's stuff you can spray on the lawn after he pees so the acid doesn't turn it yellow and there's a vitamin you can feed him that will reduce the acid in his pee so it doesn't do it. Here's what I'm talking about:<br>  <br>  The lawn spray:<br>  <a href="http://www.drsfostersmith.com/product/prod_display.cfm?c=3307+18+15731&pcatid=15731" rel="nofollow">http://www.drsfostersmith.com/product/pr...</a><br>  <br>  The vitamin:<br>  <a href="http://www.drsfostersmith.com/product/prod_display.cfm?c=3307+18+11874&pcatid=11874" rel="nofollow">http://www.drsfostersmith.com/product/pr...</a><br>  <br>  If you use one of the two (or both for good measure) and then pick up all poop immediately, there shouldn't be a problem! Also, you may want to keep him out away from the lawn when you're not home or when you can't moniter him. Many dogs love eating/chewing on grass and will dig if you lack in giving them exercise! So unless you want your lawn ruined by a bored dog, I would highly suggest you keep him away from the new grass when you're not there!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|FixsyTUYaa	Well, the pee and crap wont hurt the grass as long as it isn't in excess.  He has to have a spot to go though.  Keep him in a kennel or in the house until you know he has to go really bad and then take him on a leash to the spot you want him to go.  Do this for a few days and then let him out by himself.  If he doesn't go to the spot, rub his nose in it immediately after he does it and then take him to the right spot and make him sit in the area for a while.  Do this for a week or two and it should work.

I pay about $25.00 for the office visit and a general exam runs around $15.00.<br>  <br>  If he needs to do some other procedures or you need to pay for medicine it all depends on what he does and what the cost of the medication is.<br>  <br>  You can discuss all of this with your vet prior to your visit if you are worried about costs.  They are not offended if you ask.|`|rvBZPIv4aa	A lot of vets will have an "exam fee" of $40-50. And then beyond that there will probly be extra charges for any meds, and even more if they have to do any additional testing or blood work. But, if she is sick, please take her in...she will thank you for it!|`|PM23RDycaa	Unless this is a new vet or a new dog you should know what your vet charges for an office visit. Every vet charges differently but anywhere from 20-90$|`|fZCfJWpOaa	Cost of the visit depends on several things: Where you live, types of tests they are going to run, etc.<br>  <br>  They'll probably take a stool sample and send it to their lab for tests.  They may also prescribe medication or a dewormer as well, depending on the diagnosis.  If your dog is dehydrated from the diarrhea, it may need a shot or IV fluids.  There's so many factors it's hard to know for sure without being a veterinarian and seeing the dog myself!<br>  <br>  I would put aside $100-200 for the visit, just to be safe.  If the cost of the visit is more than you can pay, but you need the treatment for your pet, talk to the vet about it.  A lot of vets will work out payment plans with owners who can't pay everything up front.|`|N9pKl35Xaa	We just had our younger dog seen to by the vet due to a injury he got whilst playing with my other dog and it cost $49 for a consult plus the medication to stop infection and one cost $71 and the other about $50. Its not cheap but you gotta do what you gotta do to make them better. I wouldnt know exact prices or anything thats just going by what our vet charged us on our last vet bill. But our consults are always between $45 and $49-50|`|0f35e35fc374dea3ca1e2b585d13080caa	A vet visit can get costly. generally a walk in the door is anywhere from 50-100 dollars and if they run some blood test or xrays then the bill goes up. the vet may want to keep a sample of the diarrhea to perform a number of test. each test will cost.|`|kd9kWB8Kaa	count on at least $50.|`|cvNN6l9Daa	It depends on the area.  Our office visit and exam costs about $45 for a dog or cat and $53 for an exotic pet.  That is the day clinic.  At one emergency clinic, office visit/emergency exam is $85 and the other one where I work, it is $104.  Don't choose the cheapest option.  The low cost/high volume practices are more likely to cut corners.  On the other hand, a high cost for an exam does not mean that the vet is high quality.  I recently had a pet come in for an exam because during her last "exam" the doctor didn't even touch the patient.  I do relief (substituting) at a lot of different clinics, and this is more common than you want to believe.  The best way to find a vet is to have them recommended by someone you can trust.  You can also interview them.  A member of Veterinary Information Network is more likely to be devoted to continuing education.  AAHA hospitals have to conform to a number of different rules and regulations, but I have found some of them are still pretty behind the times in the care of patients.<br>  <br>  Most of all, beware a vet that does not encourage testing to pinpoint the problem.  Also beware the vet that does not welcome second opinions.|`|TE73SFblaa	yes it is....especially  right now with hard times and all.But I bet I could solve your problem if this is it let me know.Well did you just recently change its food brand?or maybe the dog ate some-other dogs  food?if so that's  why the dog has the runs.See when changing your dogs food you have to ease them into the new food.like slowly mixed the old with the new for about a week then they will be able to handle  it.But if you just give them new food with no fair warning then they get sick for about a week.Just keep the dog  hydrated  lots of water.I know this cause my dog did this once she eats kibbles in bits my other dog eats pedigree.She went outside to visit with him ate all his food acting like a pig cause she  just ate .And got herself sick....like a silly for 1 week she had diarrhea.I kept her hydrated and she kicked it.Oh also let the dog eat grass take it to a grassy area the dog will eat it on its own .Its like there pepto bismal.They know when they are sick and that what they do to help themselves also.Good luck!|`|ANeF59yMaa	fr my rabbit, th bill is :<br>  <br>  consultation : 30 bucks <br>  <br>  medicine : 36 bucks <br>  <br>  microscope examination : 9 bucks <br>  <br>  nail clipping : 10 bucks<br>  <br>  i was there only 20 mins. and the microscope examination, i only looked at it ONCE and it costs 9 bucks. im so pissed. <br>  <br>  90 bucks altogether. including tax. <br>  <br>  now, my rabbit has gt diarrhoea, gonna beg my mom to bring him to th vet again. lols,,, i really hope she agrees. god, i really hav to beg..<br>  <br>  well, gd luck to you !|`|pyqgEbmsaa	I pay $35 to take a dog to the vet and get a check up.

YnCUyvK7aa	There's no single medicine that can be used to treat everything.  There are so many things that cause illnesses - gram positive and gram negative bacteria, fungus, parasites, viruses, and even environmental problems that there are specific medicines that are needed to target the different pathogens to treat them.  And things like BettaFix, MelaFix, and PimaFix are better as something to prevent a problem or treat a mild case of a disease, because there are the equivalent of herbal supplements, they aren't a medicine that will treat a serious condition.<br>  <br>  From the sounds of what you're describing, your fish has fin rot, if the tail is flaking off at the end, or high ammonia if the color is just dark and splitting from the end toward the base.  The best cure for both of these is regular [weekly] water changes of 25% if he's in a heated tank.  If he's in a bowl, you'll need to do 100% water changes every 2-3 days and find a way to keep his water temperature around 76-80 degrees F.  Adding a half teaspoon of aquarium salt per gallon will also help, and is about as good of an All-Purpose Medicine as you'll find.  If the regular water changes don't help, or you're already doing the changes as I've described, you might need to add an antibiotic if this is fin rot.  Maracyn 2 is a good 1 to get for this.|`|3bf821ff353c216ffc93ff7a91b60828aa	Your best bet would be to do frequent partial water changes.  The amount depends on what size his tank or bowl is and if it's filtered.  Taking care of the water will allow the fish to take care of itself health wise, and you generally won't need to use any medications.<br>  <br>  Other things to consider doing if you don't already, make sure he's in preferably at least a 5 gallon tank, with a filter, and a heater.  At the very least, a 2 gallon tank should be used.  A heater is a must as well.  Bettas need temps around 78°F.  Any cooler then that and they start slowing down, acting lethargic, not eating, losing color, and eventually they'll die.<br>  <br>  That BettaMax or BettaFix whatever it's called, is just a version of MelaFix.  It's really only good for torn fins caused by injuries/fighting.|`|hD25pT1Laa	The black color on the edges of his tail are where his fins are growing. Not sure about the holes on his body, but you may be describing his lateral line. It is a pressure sensing organ that fish have. Hanging out at the surface and blowing bubbles are fairly normal Beta behaviors since they breath air at the surface. They have a special organ called the labyrinth in their heads that lets them breath air since in their wild habitat they live in very shallow, stagnant water.

During your annual vet visit just have the vet look for points on their teeth.  Usually you can go a few years between floating.  One clue to float is grain falling out of their mouth during feeding.<br>  Shots are very subjective.  If you horse stays home and is just a nice trail horse and doesn't come in contact with other horses all you really need it Tetnus, rabies, and west niles.<br>  If they go out visiting than the flu is always needed and a strangles booster.  There's another I can't remember right now that barns require if boarded.  Well of course coggins but there is something else.  Hmmmmmm.<br>  I do not believe in giving horses all their shots at one time. If they have any immune issue you don't see you can make the horse very ill since it's hard to process all these shots at one time.<br>  We pay around 50 dollars a horse for shots but we do not give the flu, strangles, etc unless a new horse is coming in.<br>  If you have shoes on every 6 to 8 weeks and you have to stay firm on that timeline.<br>  If you do not have shoes on it depends on the horse and the ground they move on.  Remember wild horses are not trimmed and do fine.<br>  We go every 10 weeks but one horse always looks long by that time but that's fine.  If they founder than you want to go every 6 to 8 weeks since it helps keep the elfin shoe look away and helps them feel better since you are keeping there heels trimmed.  I pay 25 for a trim.<br>  My vet bills if everyone is healthy that year costs about 350 for 3 horses and a pony.<br>  Countysupply has a lot of sheets (please do not blanket your horse unless it's a show horse.

Make sure if your doing hunter jumper you get a stricly hunter jumper saddle which is a pretty small saddle thats pretty flat, not as cumfy as the others but it helps you jump better without hitting your vag, i got mine from my instructor but try ebay maybe, who knows, or a local tack shop, and theres websites too i just dont remember what there called.

Our mother brought my brother and I each a horse.  It was a long time ago, like in the 60's and 70's and I wish I had a place and the money to own one again.<br>  <br>  I do not recall visits from the vet, until Blaze got the Heaves (Asma in human).  Trigger never saw the vet.  I think shoes where done two or three times a year or as needed.  We lived in rural northern New Jersey and rode along the roadways or in the mountain.  Soil was called loam, which meant it had lots of stones in it and there were a lots of rocky outcroppings too.  So shoes got used pretty well.  And we each carry a hoof pick, which was also well used and we never had a horse go lame either.  Our horses were boarded so we just rode them, walked them after a ride and did all the grooming ourselves.  Feeding, shelter, and turnout was part of the boarding fee.<br>  <br>  As for prices, you need to enter those subject heading in search and look at the output.  My brother and I still have all our tack, as I said, we rode western, and it is well protected with saddle soap.  However, if I got a new horse, I would replace the blanket and pad.<br>  <br>  I mentioned Blaze getting the heaves.  It was determine that a bad load of hay was the cause.  Be very sure of your feed and hay; know your supplier and check his references.<br>  <br>  You did not ask it in your question, but it sounds like you intend to do all the care yourself.   That means up early in the morning to muck the stall, change the water, turnout for the day, and dump the manure in a pile far away from the stable.  That is just in the morning.  Night time, grooming, exercise and practice, second stall mucking, feed hay and oats, another change of fresh water.<br>  <br>  Morning tasks should take about 30 to 45 minutes.  Night time, grooming should take 20 to 45 minutes, exercise and practice should be about one to two hours, 30 walk to cool down, unless you loosen cinch and walk your horse back to the stable.  And about 15 to twenty minute caring for your tack and properly storing it.  This will account for approximately two hours and 20 minutes up to four hours and 15 minutes each day.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.  Good luck.

The domestic shorthair should not be confused with the American Shorthair, which is a Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) recognized breed.<br>  <br>  Domestic shorthaired cats are characterized by a wide range of coloring and typically 'revert to type' after a few generations, which means they express their coats as a tabby. This can be any color or combination of colors. They also exhibit a wide range of physical characteristics and, as a result, domestic shorthaired cats in different countries tend to look different in body shape and size, as they are working from differing gene pools.

5KKW7LMBaa	if im getting on the horse bareback i first try to find a gate or a rock or a stump. <br>  when that fails i try to find a little hill or a dip in the ground and put the horse in the lowest part and myself on the higher ground - it does help quite a lot! <br>  otherwise its just practice - i find it easier to "spring" up there rather than "climb" up....<br>  <br>  and just one comment on the points people have made about ALWAYS getting on the "nearside' (left) of the horse. <br>  While this is true traditionally or in any formal situation (competition etc) the far more modern and appropriate advice is that you should be able to get on your horse BOTH sides. <br>  this is a safety issue and all a biomechanical thing (all that wear and tear on the one side of your horses body, not to mention your saddle and stirrup leathers stretching!).<br>  you should be able to safely do EVERYTHING including mount from both sides of the horse. while it is tradation to work from the nearside (left) of the horse (when leading etc) i can't stress enough how important and balanced it is to be able to work from both sides of the horse.<br>  an interesting thing to note is that the 2 hemispheres of a horses brain are not as well "connected" as a humans brain, so when you start doing something on the offside (right) of your horse, when you have always done it from the left, in effect the horse has to "relearn" that task again. <br>  <br>  anyway, hope this helps. goodluck!|`|IJoM4Q50aa	Do you mean getting on bareback? If so, just practice. Some people find it easier to swing up and some find it easier to jump up. Or if you can't do either, then find a rock or stump.|`|3kBcHJIIaa	First things first, you always mount on the left side. That's like a law in horse riding talk. Next, you put your left foot in the stirrup, and make sure it's secure. Then, grab the little knob on saddle (sorry I forgot what it's called :P), and a small lock of the mane for more leverage, and jump off the ground. I know its hard, but use those muscles! One thing also- DO NOT HIT THE HORSE'S BACK WITH YOUR FOOT! Their backs are very sensitive, and it can scare them easily. Your right hand can be placed on the saddle as well. If the horse is that big, or you're really that short, you can resolve to a stool if needed. Just take it with you, or keep it in the mounting area! Simple as that.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|YnWwcUPTaa	Been there and done that...find a rock or stump lol but there is a special stirrup leather cost about $50. and that was about twenty years ago, don't know what they go for now but the stirrup is on a hook so you can drop it to get on and them hook it up once mounted, it is a lot easier than unbuckling your stirrup and then buckling again.|`|wfmtZBlaaa	grab hold of some main, face the horses bum.<br>  step back with your right leg, and bring the left leg back as well but don't put if down on the floor..<br>  then step forward with the left foot and push off it(like a little bounce) and swing your right leg over...<br>  <br>  to make this work you really have to push off the ground with your left leg, and really swing that leg over!|`|C68dKT0Saa	ALWAYS ON THE LEFT! <br>  uasally u would have some one holding down the other stirrip as u get on (so that the saddle dosent slip) but u can still get on by urself just make sure the girth is tight. becoz u wouldnt have anyone else helping u up, after ur on put ur weight into ur right stirrup to balance it out.<br>   hold tight on the reins as u get on! dont want him/her moving about! lol. also if u have a high horse its usally harder to get on so wat i do is put the left sturrip down 2 holes. then once ur on put it back up 2 holes.<br>  also make use of ur sarroundings, so if there is a higher patch of grass stand on that, u will see how much easier it is if ur on the higher slope. u can also buy portable mounting blocks for not that much (depending on where u get it)<br>  well, hope this helps<br>  good luck
3YMETqStaa	Great Danes are amazing dogs.  They are beautiful, loyal, protective, great with kids(as long as you teach not to lean), don't bark much, and don't need excessive amounts of exercise.  The downsides are they are expensive to own, have short life spans, and their size can be difficult to handle so proper training is a must as a pup.  They are hard to move if they don't want to and love to lay on couches and people's laps.  <br>  <br>  If you can manage their size and can handle a short life span, they are amazing dogs.|`|3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	As another said...they are good dogs for the right people.<br>  <br>  My family has always owned danes.

(As you can see from my pic, my husband and I decided to adopt...a mutt and a lab.)<br>  <br>  They are huge, yes.  But they are not the "powerful" or "massive" dogs people often think they are.  They are nicknamed gentle giants for a reason.  (They don't really play rough, but wagging tails have poked children in the eyes or smacked drinking glasses off tables in our home!)  Danes are big time couch potatos and ours have always been very easy to train.  As was said, they have shorter life spans than many breeds and they have a higher chance of certain medical problems.  If you think this might be a breed you are interested, definitely take the time to read more about them.|`|b2df0927cfc00ec0b4a6f61d9c5cd6e5aa	My boyfriends mom has one. <br>  <br>  She is like having a horse in the house. She's a little too hyper for me. Though i must say she has a wonderful temperament and is very sweet for her size. Though as she is soo big she is hard to train.

First of all, I have a dog that is pretty hard to control, and I wouldn't want something that huge behaving like that, I have no idea what I would do. Also, I heard that they have heart problems just because of their massive size, which I would hate to happen to my dog. That being said, If you like the breed, and feel that you can take care of it, go for it. If you are unsure of it, contact a breeder, they always have the most accurate info about a breeds disposition and care requirements.|`|OxuUznQxaa	Danes are the best breed. They are gentle giants. They are hyper when young but they grow out of it and becomes more calm and caring. they have good life span if u feed them with raw diet. they are too good with children.<br>  <br>  They are not good dog, they are the best dog if you shower them with love and training. they need lots of play area as they will turn your house upside down when left alone. you need to buy something for them to chew, or they will chew your furniture's down.<br>  <br>  never crop their tail and do surgery with their ears. you would love when they wag their long tail. <br>  <br>  Enjoy each and every moment!!!|`|7n523JW1aa	Yes they are awesome dogs. Just make sure you can control such a powerful breed.|`|AA10912383	Great danes are good dogs, but you need to make sure you train them well, otherwise they'll out-power you.|`|L5jjhYnNaa	Yes.They are good dogs.Very playful and powerful good yet bad combo lol as puppies they are ALOT to handle but when they reach around  3/4 they calm down considerably. Just have a good sized yard,train them well & love them and they'll be no issues. :)|`|tPGxPDvBaa	Yes, they are great dogs for the right ppl.  They are expensive to own & don't live as long as many dogs are their biggest downsides. They are lazy goofy funny sweet loving big dogs who generally believe they are just cute lil lap dogs.  I hope to adopt another one, I miss having one around.

I would say most people are afraid because they don't know alot about snakes (people are afraid of the things they are unsure of) and also alot of people are afraid because snakes have a bad connotation and everyone knows there are some dangerous snakes out there. Maybe some people have been bitten or know someone who has died from a snake bite. You just have to realize that other people may not view snakes as you do and therefore have a very different opinion.|`|AA10618269	Such fears (of wildlife) are ancient. They were based when human kind was in it's earliest stages. Then those fears helped the people survive in the wilderness by telling them which animals to stay away from. <br>  Now human kind is much more developed, and not all people have those incstincts as sharp as others.<br>  Exept that I think it's a bit because of personality, and the way a person was grown: If a person loves animals or grew up with snakes of course hw won't be afraid of them. :)

0nIwKd5Uaa	First beautiful dog. <br>  <br>  Personally i would suggest another large breed dog so if they get to rough housing no one gets hurt. 210 pounds could kill a yorkie without even trying.<br>   <br>  Suggestions<br>  <br>  Great Dane<br>  Bull Mastiff or another Mastiff family<br>  Saint Bernard<br>  or maybe even another of the same breed sense you're already familiar with it.<br>  <br>  <br>  for the record to the thumbs down person i answered his question before he put the girlfriend. Mate doesn't always mean something sexual. I thought he meant a play mate.|`|3p3otDlXaa	Another African Boerboel.|`|ZT0K3q2Aaa	What i think you should get him is neutered. There are way to many dogs in need of a home, and its not fair to bring more into this world. And by you asking what kind of dog you should mate him with, means you are open to the idea of mating him with another breed, creating a mutt. Thats a very irresponsible thing todo. You know how many mutts specifically are in the shelter? Or getting euthanized? Way too many, so think about that<br>  <br>  Oh, but if your referring mate as in "friend", than i think you should get another large dog,one of the opposite sex, maybe another African Borboel. Or maybe even a great dane, that breed is a gentle giant, and overall gets along well with other dogs|`|uIvb5eqoaa	get him neutered.  Why would you add to the pet over population?  It is unhealthy for your dog to breed him, keeping him intact causes major behavior and medical problems.  Every puppy you bring into this world kills another in the shelter waiting for a home.  Get your dog neutered and don't be a back yard breeder.|`|Fx4ILfadaa	a spayed female staffy, i have one shes very playful and can be rough jut try get a big one lol or just one like him|`|020573c2b8f6f31da5d9ac91c3b09ee6aa	a SPAYED female mastiff.|`|U9KYu0Uqaa	he is cute. if he is friendly i think he would get along with any dog please dont get a pitball i think they are the most scary and ficious dogs.|`|fg1gFuP4aa	Wow hes amazing.

g4lgt3Yvaa	There a hundreds of corn morphs that are produced by specialized breeders. Here are some variations. Though it is unlikely that you will find most of these in the wild. There are exceptions to similar looking wild corns.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.jonigarcia.com/morph_guide_normal_saddle_pattern.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.jonigarcia.com/morph_guide_no...</a><br>  <br>  This is the closest similarity I have found in the wild that may resemble your description. I found about a dozen in the same local in about a year's time.

When you said you found it, did you mean in the wild or when shopping for a snake? If you found it at a pet store, then you have better chances of identifying by researching morphs. Start with bloodred corns.<br>  <br>  If it makes any difference or not. I did happen upon a yellow rat snake mating with a corn "red rat snake", and I found many specimens over the years in the same area that looked like corns but the saddles were linked with stripes. Anyway, in the wild, these are considered natural hybrids as opposed to intentionally bred morphs.<br>  <br>  obylisk can probably give you more specifics.

The wild snake you found is a classic corn snake. They can be slightly different in the intensity of reddish, orange and yellow blotch colors that they are known for. This snake has a semi-disrupted skin pattern. The Okeetee corn snake is the most vibrant naturally occuring wild corn snake phase. I have never seen a solid colored wild corn snake. Not all wild corn snakes have these dazzling colors. You posted another question about a ring-necked snake that you found. That gives me an idea to what part of the country you may live in. Yellow rat snakes may not be indigenous to your area. You may want to look into that to be sure|`|UZYT8eMwaa	There is actually quite variable of yellow, orange, red, grey, brown and black colorings in the wild types <br>  <br>  <a href="http://pro.corbis.com/images/IH116576.jpg?size=67&uid=%7BC6E3FDCC-CF12-4AA3-8437-948A25705867%7D" rel="nofollow">http://pro.corbis.com/images/IH116576.jp...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.schlitzauduboncenter.com/images/Rep08.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.schlitzauduboncenter.com/imag...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.livefoodsbypost.co.uk/ekmps/shops/thepinkskink/resources/Image/Corn%20Snake%20web.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.livefoodsbypost.co.uk/ekmps/s...</a><br>  <a href="http://carolinarodents.com/catalog/images/corn_snake1.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://carolinarodents.com/catalog/image...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.wildadventures.net/rides_attractions_shows/images/red_rat_snake_or_corn_snake_elaphe_guttata_RASimage.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.wildadventures.net/rides_attr...</a>|`|8i90ov0Gaa	I was also thinking yellow rat snake like Obilysk said.

RPTwjyjIaa	Yes I think it is rude. I love to go into petsmart with my dogs. However, I always try and be aware of my surroundings. Usually people are very good and ask if they can pet him or if he is nice so their dogs can practice socialization. Although one time someone asked me that, I said yes, and then their dog approached my dog and snapped at him. Luckily my dog is good and I told him to come and no harm was done. I think part of it is because my dog weighs 75 pounds and people are more cautious of big dogs. Still, in my opinion, if people do not want their dog or child to get bit then they should pay attention. My kids personally learned at an early age to ask the all important question "may I pet your dog?". Some people think that just because they are in a pet store that it is ok to let their kids and dogs do whatever because all the doggies must be nice, but if startled any dog may react in a way that is not common for them and people need to be more aware of this and be more respectful. I took the time to train and socialize my dogs and if people are going to take their dogs into public it would be nice if they took the same curtsies with their dogs. I applaude you for doing that with yours. Thank you. :)<br>  <br>  Glad your dogs are ok and no one was hurt.|`|YLYAo2zmaa	Honestly, after the incident, I would have told the parents, that letting the child handle their dog and the dog approaching strange dogs was a very good way for both child and puppy to get bitten.<br>  Even the best behaved dogs don't like to get jumped on especially when they are around strange people and animals in a strange place.|`|sOkePjK3aa	I've never been in that kind of situation but I'm sure it is so annoying and very frustrating when others make you do things they should be doing themselves. And also, it's worse when they tell you you're doing something wrong when they did nothing. Ugh...|`|ydshiNrKaa	Well unfortunately I don't think you handled this very well - first you got upset, started yelling, and pulling on the leashes.  This all was transferred to your dogs getting them excited and hyper.  If your dogs are well socialized a 6 month old puppy shouldn't bother them in the least and they should have just acknowledged the puppy. Also, since your dogs were so well behaved, dropping their leashes so they didn't get tangled would have helped all involved.  Your dogs wouldn't have run off, yet they would have been free to move away from the puppy if they wanted to.  Your yelling just upset everyone including the dogs.  When you take your dogs into a pet store like petsmart or petco, you are going to encounter all types of dogs and dog owners, some not so well controlled.  When I take my dog into petsmart or petco he goes on a short lead and stays by my side.  If he encounters another dog they sniff each other and he generally just keeps on going after the greeting.  If you don't want your dogs to meet with other dogs in the pet store, you would be better off leaving them in the car or at home.  You can usually tell if a dog or person is going to be a problem in the store and you just guide your dog away from the problem.  In this instance, I think it would have been to your advantage to just have stayed cool, not started yelling at anyone, and just the dogs meet and take care of things themself.  Like I said, you could have dropped your leashes since your dogs would have stayed with you, and then the tangling wouldn't have been an issue either.  Staying calm in these types of situations, keeps your dogs calm also.|`|O8BoOvuwaa	Chill out dude, it's not a big deal. You act like a few dogs coming up to yours is like the end of the world  . No need to have a b*tch fit .|`|D8sMuoCpaa	Youre dealing with dog people here. There is no rational, all they think is "my dogs a good and harmless dog"|`|TfcxT0zTaa	This is a whack situation . its not rude|`|0f35e35fc374dea3ca1e2b585d13080caa	try to let it go, ignorance is the reason they did that. If someones dog did that to my dog, i would go off on them telling them off,so the next time they take their dog in a store, they would remember me and will watch their dog. I have no tolerance for people like them.|`|7n523JW1aa	I think it's rude. Ironically the other day I was at Petsmart with my Boerboel and some 12 year old comes walking up with her Chihuahua and I'm not going to yell at her but I got pissed at her parents and they just acted dumb. I hate it. I think its really rude.|`|QEaoW8nUaa	No matter how old the German Shephard pup was, the parents shouldn't have let their child walk it on a lead. Even at 6 months old, they are very strong!! <br>  <br>  I have 3 dogs, a Cattle Dog, Kelpie x Border Collie and a Boxer. All boys, all the same age. When we take them out, they are so well behaved (like yours) and other dogs on leads just wander on up and do the same thing, get all tangled and what ever, and my dogs start to get pissed off and want to fight. So I can't blame you for thinking it's rude! People should have more control over their dogs in public!|`|W8AuurXuaa	umm i guess it is rude but it sounds like just a one time accident and i'm sure they didn't  mean any harm.  I'm more concerned about the parents letting a baby approach a strange dog. but hey accidents happen don't get so worked up over it... if it happens again and really bothers you way don't you try just asking them politely to remove their dog...|`|fOLO4TNhaa	Oh i know!! Are Petsmart is connected to a Toys"R"Us. So there are kids and there dogs here all the time and the ignorant parents that don't give a rip!<br>  <br>  Yes i think it is very rude. <br>  <br>  Bostons are wonderful! My neighbor has 3. 2 males and a female. The 2 males are son and father and the female is the mother. So well behaved!|`|L5jjhYnNaa	You acted appropriated for the situation.I don't think while in a STORE (or any other public place) a person should allow their dog (or child) to wonder about (the parent should be in control at all times) & especially a puppy and a Child! (puppy+kid=curiosity & energy lol) Its fine that you said something,for the plain fact you had dogs you needed to worry about.I would have said something too.Its also good your dogs behave,my one dog i had in the past (she was a pet from a shelter) was extremely dog aggressive so making her behave was impossible when an animal was in view (that's why we never went to petco/petsmart together). You do the best you can with your dogs,we cant change other peoples actions.Just hope no ones animals harm yours in the future (i think you'll be fine though!)|`|Mzvp1LPFaa	the worst dogfights I've ever seen anywhere have all been at Petsmart in Houston.  I've seen multiple combatants rolling down the aisles - a hazard for humans and other dogs.  You hardly ever see dogfights at a show, because the handlers understand the nature of dogs and give each other plenty of space. <br>  <br>  If someone starts to let his dog approach mine, I tell them to respect my dog's space and not to come closer.  They don't know each other and my dog will get aggressive if crowded by a strange dog.  I hate seeing a big dog being walked by a child.  The child cannot possibly have control if the dog decides to go after something or just take off.  They don't have the strength or the authority to take command of the situation.  I had to rescue a neighbor's 10 yr old girl who was being dragged around the neighborhood by the family's 86lb GSD puppy.   They'd tied the end of the chain around her waist, and she was scuffed up from falling and being dragged by a dog that weighed as much as she did.  He gleefully ignored the inconvenient weight on the end of his chain and went and did whatever he wanted.   I had to undo the chain from her waist and lead the big  puppy home.  At first he balked, but I just told him "Let's go!" and started walking.  He got dragged on his fanny for a few strides until he decided it was much easier to get up and walk.  As an adult I could do that.  The 10  yr old kid simply couldn't.  An adult should be right there if allowing a child to walk  a dog stronger than the child is.
n6ffS63Maa	Well, leo's hunt by motion and if the mealworms are dead and not moving then what is there to hunt? You really shouldn't have this problem anyways.  It's not advised to leave feeders in the tank for longer than 20 minutes.  You have a set feeding time and that's it.  I know some people like to leave a dish of mealworms available at all times for a snack, but this leads to overeating and overweight leos.  Just feed as much as your leo will eat in 15-20 minutes and removed what's left.|`|7kdcmaUraa	yes, because the meal worms can get scaled causing them to be extremely dry when your gecko eats them, when they are alive their warm and moist and easy for the geckos to eat try to put a lesser amount in at a time or time your geckos eating opatterns|`|l0ktQUnWaa	Do you give the worms any moisture? If not, put in a slice of carrot to give them moisture.|`|VXQFT341aa	Ask the gecko what he likes.|`|wLgGD63raa	Yes, the mealworms should be alive when your gecko eats them. You don't actually need a light, so if you stopped using it, it'd stop killing them. Leopard geckos are nocturnal, so the light can actually bother them. They also absorb heat through their bellies, not their backs, and it also helps them digest their food, so a heating pad is all you need, and it should cover about 1/3 of the bottom (under the tank).

7BvXLBW6aa	Suck the pain away, at least try to get some of the venom out before you get poisened|`|niztxto9aa	It really depends on what kind of snake bite you have received. If it was from a venomous snake, you must not panic whatsoever because that will up your heart rate making the venom travel through your body even faster. As for sucking the poison out, that is a myth that was tested many times and to no avail. IT DOESN'T WORK. Just remain calm until the paramedics arrive and don't do anything to make your heart rate climb.|`|hQQuqyYcaa	First of all, do not suck out the poison, because that can do even more damage to the underlying tissues. Do not put on a tourniquet, because once that tourniquet is released, you'll get a rush of venom to the other parts of your body. If the ambulance is on its way, then just leave it be...they'll do what needs to be done.|`|paHjJrrdaa	If you suck out the poison wash your mouth out with Veggie oil first to coat it so it doesn't absorb thru the mouth tissues!!!|`|KcQT4ph8aa	Hmmm.. You experimentin' on people here to actually answer your question quickly?<br>  <br>  Suck it but don't swallow of course, do nothing and relax.

V01NA68zaa	Get a water gun and squirt him everytime he barks. It's not mean to the dog and most of the time it is effective.|`|lmSffrNuaa	The first step towards controlling excessive barking is to understand the specific reasons behind it. Training your dog to bark less (you will never stop it altogether) is a time-consuming process. Also keep in mind that some breeds are more apt to bark than others and these could prove more difficult to train.<br>  <br>  Check this link for more info.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://lnk.nu/dogtime.com/rxa.html" rel="nofollow">http://lnk.nu/dogtime.com/rxa.html</a>|`|imaeJ3o3aa	I have a mini daschund too (10 mths)<br>  She doesn't hardly bark at all but she is well trained.<br>  If she barks rouse on her and give her rewards when she stops, this will start with basic lead training, sit, walk, stay etc with little HEALTHY food rewards when she does the right thing.<br>  This can be Incorporated in the afternoon or morning walk.<br>  They are very smart and love to please, oh and make sure the alpha male of the house is doing the training ie the one who feeds her and has done the training to date.<br>  Good luck and enjoy!|`|dv5swnKjaa	It sounds like he needs more attention and stimulation.  Take him for regular walks, get him some toys, teach him some tricks... stuff like that.  Dogs who bark incessantly are just like dogs who chew things, they're bored, and they want you to pay attention to them.  In any case, barking should also be fairly easily controlled with training.  Good luck!|`|wyfjsfikaa	Coming from a positive dog training stand point every person needs to work with the dog to get him to stop not just one person. If one person trains the dog it he will only listen to that person, causing major problems with later (ie the substitute teacher effect). If the dog barks I would say in a clam clear voice "Quiet" or some other word that signals to the dog to stop barking, the second he stops reward the dog with a high value treat (something he really loves, like chicken or hot dogs ETC). A fast way to do this would be to clicker train him.
jvURAYDxaa	Hey Jessica.....This is a common puppy trait. First, I would tell you to take your dog for at least 2 20-30 minute walks each day. This is not counting the go potty walks. You can also begin to train her to heel as you are the calm pack leader. This will not only exercise her, but will fulfill her need to be given direction. If you are a calm, positive leader, then begin to teach her basic obedience. Sit, stay, down, come are all important. You must be patient with her, and lots of repetition. But, only keep her training sessions to 15 minutes or so at a time. Also, dogs are very food motivated. When she does what you ask her, ALWAYS tell her what a good girl she is and give her a treat....lotsa treats! If you are not sure what to do, take her to a beginners obedience class with you and your boyfriend so you will both learn how to be good pack leaders, and happy dog owners. Once your dog has structure, rules and lots of play and exercise, she will be much more chill. Don't forget though...SHE IS STILL A PUPPY!!!  Have fun!  : ) P.S. DON'T EVER SHOCK, HIT, HOLLER AT, GET MAD AT, THROW OUTSIDE, or any other ridiculous such suggestion. Be patient and pleasant...even when your dog messes up. Eventually, through all your positive training and love, your girl will learn what you expect of her and you, your boyfriend and your dog will all have a great, rewarding, fun relationship!|`|7n523JW1aa	Exercise, exercise, and may I say exercise. Taking your dog for two 45 minute walks a day is what you should be walking your dog. This will make her much more calmer and pretty much she'll be pooped. So when someone new walks in the door she'll be to tired to go nuts.|`|tsnpv9whaa	Tire him out! A tired puppt is the best puppy ever! He'll be much calmer and easier to deal with!|`|dc500182581d351f03c845444a3479f5aa	Taser therapy|`|nBehRANyaa	More exercise and a beginning obedience class, for starters.|`|ydshiNrKaa	More exercise.  A tired puppy is a calmer puppy.|`|0nIwKd5Uaa	More exercise and some basic obedience.  When she jumps step back and tell her "no jump". For the door teach her to sit and stay.
RdSNb1Xraa	You can buy pet-friendly semi permanent hair dyes for your dog.<br>  Some Grooming salons will do this (my groomer has THE most gorgeous white standard poodle who she gives pink ears) but the colours are bright eg greens, pinks, blues and reds ect.<br>  I dont think you can get neutral colours....|`|AA10912383	What you can do is go out and find a good dog shampoo to help furnish his coat, and good brushes and brush him every day. But otherwise, you should love your dog no matter what he looks like! Petsmart has some really good dog shampoos|`|QEaoW8nUaa	Not too sure about this one. All I know is that dogs have very sensitive skin, hence the reason for Doggy Shampoo. If there isn't a Doggy Hair Colour product out there, then I wouldn't suggest doing it. Ask your vet.|`|xzMfrcPvaa	No. Don't judge him by his looks! It shouldn't matter what his coat is like.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	It would have to be done far too often to be safe for dog.  Unfortunately you will have to live with it. The sun & his saliva will turn the black to reddish-brown & his legs that is simply his coloring. Pups will change their coloring & marking somewhat & you can't change it.|`|ydshiNrKaa	NO, you don't dye your dogs hair.  All dogs fur will change color during time usually getting lighter.  The brown coloring around his muzzle is staining from his eating and drinking.   This can be removed with a special cleaner you can get at petsmart or petco in the grooming section.  Not sure what the name is for it but you will find it in with the shampoos etc.  I don't see anything wrong with looking "muttish".  Is this below you to own a mutt?|`|0f35e35fc374dea3ca1e2b585d13080caa	this is ridiculous, maybe your mutt-ish dog thinks you have a mutt-ish face. do your dog a favor, give him up for adoption, he needs someone who will love him unconditional.|`|7n523JW1aa	No. I don't think it's good to do that. Bad for the skin and burns a little.|`|vfhKkiSKaa	No, let the thing be and love him for who he is, not what he looks like.|`|81675c7bcc2aa81478472216e01229f7aa	No there isn't.  God made him that way for a reason - just let him be.
6j9EZXGWaa	For during the day, provide a hotspot at 90-92 degrees and a cool side in the mid-low 80's. For nights, a hotspot at 86-88 degrees is good and a cool side in the low 80's-upper 70's will be okay. Feed when the ambient temperature is 84-85 degrees.|`|8i90ov0Gaa	I keep mine at an ambient temperature of 80 degrees with a hot spot of 90 to 92 degrees. I keep this temperature constant 24/7 and do not allow it to cool down at night. The only exception is in the winter when I turn the heat off at night, but I do this for breeding purposes.|`|qA18Nxslaa	You want the tank to be no lower than 70F, an ambient temp of around 80F, with a basking area around 90-95F.
O4KBKZEkaa	Some cats are just "talky". My mom had this very sweet tom who cried every time  she went out of his sight. At night when she went to bed he would sit at the bottom of the stairs and cry and it sounded for all the world like he was saying "Mowm?, mowm?"<br>  <br>  I had another cat who was always talking too. She would find me wherever I was and sit down and meow to me sometimes for ten minutes at a time while I played along by asking her questions.<br>  <br>  She might want you to follow her. Sometimes cats think their owners are kittens and and try to baby you. They might lie down with you and try to "wash" your hair for example.Spaying doesn't necessarily get rid of the motherly instinct.Hope I helped some. She sounds like a sweetheart.|`|STumBiU0aa	my cat does that sometimes - so I go and see if its hungry, needs petting or needs to be played with, and it wants none of those things.  I think that sometimes my cat just doesnt really know what he wants.  In my estimation, the cries are much like a child whining "mum!! im bored, what should i do?!?!?..."  Who knows, cats love to be the centre of attention lol|`|53giV6PFaa	I have a neutered 2 year old male that does this.  We call him our brat, because he does this at 1 a.m., 3 a.m., 5 a.m. and wakes us up. He only does this at night when he isn't the center of attention. So this is just normal call for attention.  I usually take him to my room and put on the bed with me and pet him.  He'll eventually will fall asleep laying on me.|`|AA10954497	First of all, how old is your cat and has she been spayed? An unspayed cat will howl very loudly and yes it sounds like a baby. If she has been spayed then it sounds like she wants your attention.|`|PmT0Bx21aa	there's a lot of possibilities:<br>  <br>  maybe she's bored<br>  <br>  animals can see what humans can't, maybe she saw a ghost? if you believe in ghosts or not that's what people are saying.<br>  <br>  maybe shes half wolf ( haha jk, but if you really believe... O_o<br>  <br>  she could be lonely and want to be with you since you're upstairs and she's downstairs.<br>  <br>  maybe she wants food|`|XZlJuD4Uaa	because you might be mistreating her because we have had this kind of experience. A cat came to our house and started meowing and we thought that her owner mistreated her so think you should take care of her more.|`|5fUaqBnwaa	Baby needs Mama.<br>  or..lovin.|`|SShgipKxaa	my cat does that...some cats cry to cry or for attention. my cat does it for a attention|`|VWvI5RyBaa	If she hasn't been spayed and she's over 6 months, she's probably looking for a male companion.  Mine was eight months when she started.Even if she spayed, it's possible for a female cat to be in heat if a remnant of ovary tissue has been left by mistake.  <br>  Did you only have that cat or did you have another one with her lately?  Because, when my first cat had four kittens, two died and she(the mother) got killed by a transport.  I was young and very sad so my father told me I could keep the two cats, they were a male and a female and were neutered and the male lived for 13 1/2 years.  The female cried every night so my mother called the veterinary and he told her it wasn't a big deal(in his own words he said, she sleeps, she eats and she cries? She's just doing what all women do when they deal with a loss, it will last at the most 3 weeks and she'll forget).  It lasted 6 months and I had to get up every night to console her for about an hour.|`|SnanuNKiaa	after 4 months cats are sexualy mature. if she hasn't been fixed, then she's in heat. be prepared for it to happen again and again if you choose not to have her fixed.
wnnudNp5aa	When I got my Bettas, they tended to hide behind their plants for the first few weeks. Your Betta is in a new home, and just needs time to get used to it and figure out he is not in danger. <br>  You are feeding him too much. Bettas only need to eat once a day. It's even okay to skip a day now and then. I fed mine Hikari Bio-Gold Betta pellets, 4-6 baby-sized pellets once a day.<br>  Since you are new to Betta keeping, I urge you to go to a book store, pet store, or your local library, and get a book or 3 on Betta keeping. Then you will have everything you need to know to keep your new little friend happy and healthy.<br>  First thing, a bowl is not ideal. He may survive, but will not thrive. A 2.5 gallon tank with filter and heater is better, and easier to keep clean. Put at least one aquarium-safe silk plant in it for him to hide behind. Imagine how exposed you would feel in a glass room!<br>  Good luck and happy fish-keeping!|`|lHUxtkuSaa	No there's nothing wrong with him!

A proper tank, someone said 2.5 gallons, should be about 10 in total, this is to help the betta feel secure and have lots of room to swim. The water needs to be about 26 degrees C or 78.8 degrees F. Ph should be around 7.6 and this doesn't need to be precisely on 7.6 a few points out, say .2 or .3 is reasonable. Check your local water departments quality report to find out what your tap water is or test it yourself with a good quality test kit.  One thing you need to realize is that much like us when we get put into a new situation we are not always comfortable right away and we need to acclimatise ourselves to the situation, this is the case with your betta. IF you save your money and become able to buy a 10 gallon starter kit ($20-$30 depending on the store) you can add other fish to the mix to help your betta feel safe, these are called Dither fish. What they are supposed to do is alert the other fish to predators, and in the home aquarium they help set the mood to a degree. Good dither fish for Bettas include most of the Tetra family and the Danio family, but not the Barb family or the Serpae Tetra they are fin nippers. <br>  <br>  I would suggest you check out the International Betta Congress's website at <a href="http://www.ibcbettas.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.ibcbettas.org</a><br>  <br>  Remember to support your local Fish Club and Store|`|Ik6WOcw3aa	He needs a proper tank. Mine live in 2.5 gallon heated and filtered tanks. Mine are always active and will jump out of the water to grab food off my finger. Bettas in bowls are always in horrible conditions.<br>  <br>  Bettas are tropical fish, and when they arent kept at least 78F, they become lethargic and their metabolism slows. They arent active, and they tend to run from things.<br>  <br>  If you want him to feel loved, how about giving him his most basic of needs.

fOLO4TNhaa	Easy question. When you pick a breeder you get a breeder that you trust and know well and you know they breed great dogs.<br>  <br>  So yes i would definitely trust my breeders choice. Because i decided on that breeder to produce great puppies so of course i would trust that breeder on pick of the litter.|`|hbj6vGE4aa	Have you ever shown a dog before?  If not...don't expect getting a first pick of the litter from *any* truly reputable show breeder.  Breeders usually keep the first one, two or three picks for themselves.  They certainly would not sell their best pup to a newbie.  You may be able to get third pick, behind breeder and stud fee, which would still be a very nice dog.<br>  <br>  Where are you looking for breeders?  What state do you live in?<br>  <br>  And to answer your question...yes.  If you are buying from an honest person, they will sell you an honest dog.  Make sure you get references from them, and from other show people.  They will vouch for each other, or they will tell you to stay away, especially if you try to stick with ASCA breeders.<br>  <br>  Besides, do you have enough experience in the breed to know what to look for in an eight week old show prospect puppy?  Have you memorized the breed standard, internalized it and then spent hours looking at pictures of CH dogs?  Have you decided on what "type" you want, and what you like and dislike in your dog?  Do you know what kind of gait the dog needs to have, and what structurally has to happen to get that gait?<br>  <br>  Showing looks simple on TV, but it is a TON of hard work and even more dedication.  My first show dog, my heart and soul dog, did *not* place well in our shows this weekend.  Why?  Her rear legs don't converge as well as they should... am I going to stop showing her?  Of course not!  She does not need ribbons, titles or trophies to be my girl...just remember that.<br>  <br>  AND the fact that you think that males are more "showy" than females is a bunch of BS.  Sure they have more coat, but that is in the breed standard, but they are certainly not "more desireable" as you put it.  Judges know that males have more coat, and they certainly don't reward just for that.  Showing isn't a beauty contest, it is an evaluation of conformation.  Have you ever heard of Deuce?  Look her up, she is a very nice *****.<br>  <br>  <br>  ADD:  "What am i looking for in an aussie?<br>  <br>  I am looking for a Male, Blue Merle."<br>  <br>  Uhhh, not exactly what I was looking for... which leads me to my conclusion that you really need to do some studying of the breed standard.  Structure?   Ear set?<br>  <br>  When the breeder chooses first pick for show quality, you may end up with a show quality black tri, and not a blue just to warn you.<br>  <br>  Casa blanca has some nice dogs, but I don't know them personally.  I just met Magnum over the weekend, and he is from Casa blanca.  Great looking dog, and solid too.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.casablancaaussies.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.casablancaaussies.com/</a><br>  <br>  There are a ton of breeders in california.  You should visit an ASCA show and talk to the people there.  As a matter of fact, you should go to all of the shows in the area.<br>  <br>  ADD again:  Just BTW, that video you posted...that dog had absolutely NO coat.  Please, do good research!|`|YLYAo2zmaa	Get to know the breeder and her credentials as far as showing, then visit and look at the puppies yourself, see if you agree with her.|`|Bw18seFqaa	ussually the Stud owner gets pick of litter.<br>  <br>  The breeder will know which pups are show quality and which are pet.  She knows what to expect from her pups based on what she's seen in previous litters, and from her knowledge of the dogs in the pedigree.  The breeder will be far more qualified than you to determine which pup is show and which is not.<br>  <br>  The breeder will also know the personalities of the pups.. and can determine which ones may also have the drive for agility and other events, as well as the show ring.<br>  <br>  <br>  A good breeder knows what she is doing.  If she feels that a pup has any faults that will prevent it from succeding in the show ring, it will be sold as a pet, not show potential.<br>  <br>  <br>  "pick of litter" doesnt always mean the best pup in the litter.  It just means that person gets to choose their pup before any other pups are sold.  That person chooses the pup that he/she thinks is the best.   One breeder may see qualities in one pup that he/she likes.. while someone else may see qualities in another pup that he/she prefers.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I do agree with Aussie too.. if you're not experienced with showing, you are not likely going to get the very best show pup.  A breeder would prefer to put the best in the litter with experienced show people.  Also, since you're not experienced/known.. you may also be required to have a co-ownership on the puppy as well.|`|imaeJ3o3aa	Breeders are usually pretty good, it's there reputation on the line and that is all you have as a breeder.<br>  The one drinking the most and beating the others up is usually the best choice, but there are qualities that only the breed educated and breeders know to look for.<br>  Do your research then ring breeders and ask what to look for in a dog before you go headlong in.<br>  You are entering into a very competitive area, good luck!|`|ITnQEUQTaa	Remember that ANY pup is sold as 'show potential' not as show quality.|`|XEbe4Votaa	As Aussies are my dogs explained, I doubt you will get the "best dog" in the litter.  <br>  <br>  First of all, it is not always possible to know exactly how a dog will look when you are evaluating 8-10 week old puppies.  (you can get a good idea, but there are no guarantees)  And secondly, almost nobody who is not well established in showing is going to get the best dog out of any litter.  It's just not going to happen.<br>  <br>  A good breeder, who you have worked with and who knows you and your abilities is not going to lie to you about a puppy.  But, like I said, they're also probably not going to give you whatever you want.  Would you even know how to pick the best show prospect out of a littler yourself?
AA10912383	There is no kind of dog food that will make the dog's pee colorless. What you can do is give the dog more water (ever notice how on days that you drink lots and lots of water, your urine is either a very light yellow or clear? same thing for dogs!)<br>  <br>  <br>  If you're having issues with odor and stain problems (the odor will make the dog know that it's ok to go there, so make sure you clean it up well). Use natures miracle. it's available probably wherever pet supplies are sold (petsmart i know has it). It works wonders!!!! Just make sure you follow the directions.|`|5SK3aPnuaa	You should maybe invest in some 'Pee-Pee pads', they're training pads that have a waterproof underside, and an absorbent side. There's some sort of scent that attracts the dog to pee on the pad. I set mine out for my dog before I leave the house and when I go to bed, but otherwise I take her out every 3-4 hours. <br>  <br>  Also, there's some really good stain cleaners on the market that you could look into.|`|QEaoW8nUaa	Why do you want to change the colour of your dogs urine?|`|Bw18seFqaa	dog food doesnt do that.<br>  <br>  Why dont you just train your dog?

6j9EZXGWaa	As far as his care goes, do the opposite that your snake's previous owner did and give him a clean and healthy cage to live in. Increasing the heat to optimal temperatures is a good start to begin to treat for RI. Place newspaper for bedding in the cage for now. You can shred it. If you suspect RI, and it is possible that your snake has it in the early stages, get him treated now before he gets worse and before it becomes costly.|`|uqSbj8WQaa	That absolutely sounds like RI and you're right in taking him to the vet ASAP; there is no other way to clear it up.  A lukewarm soak for 15 minutes and then put him back in his cage.  I would keep the temp at about 85 or 90 and make sure the humidity is a bit higher than normal.  You can do this by increasing the heat and adding more water to his water bowl.  A respiritory infection is deadly for a snake, hopefully it is in the early stages.  Keep his cage away from windows and other places where the temperature can fluctuate rapidly and drafts come through.  Make sure you keep his cage clean and the temperature and humidity at the right level and this shouldn't happen again.|`|7kdcmaUraa	What do u have yor snake in, what size tank and what type of substate|`|5RhDnLHLaa	get it check out by a vet

The reason he gets a bit of an upset stomach is because they don't usually intend for puppies that young to have treats because their bodies are old enough or strong enough to handle all the different ingredients. And some treats can be quite strong. If the liver treats continue to upset his stomach, hold back on giving him treats, and give him cuddles and toys instead.|`|hcgaizJCaa	My pooch loves marshmallows.

You can use paper, outdoor carpeting, cypress or aspen mulch,coconut fiber,alfalfa (rabbit) pellets, even potting soil that does not contain perlite as well. Irregardless of what substrate you use, it is vital that you keep it clean.|`|8786e426eb830d7eccdbed5c73b39ec7aa	you shouldnt use wood shavings as this can get under the belly scales and irritate the snake, also dont use any kind of sand cus this will get caught in any food they ingest and could impact in the digestive tract. I use artificial turf, or indoor/outdoor carpetting.  Its easy to clean and fibres dont come loose, and I put a heating element under neath one end but the carpet ends where this starts and I place a flat rock like slate or tile over the heating pad to radiate the heat. you can get a dogwood log, they love those to hide in and for shedding.|`|Q4pUDkyHaa	Gonna generalize a bit here, so forgive me.<br>  1. cal-kings are highly variable, and no two are alike.

Most will do fine with aspen shavings, coco coir such as Eco-Earth or Bed-A-Beast, or a forest substrate(Zilla).<br>  <br>  The key here is to allow the snake several inches to burrow. Kingsnakes burrow much more than cornsnakes.|`|6j9EZXGWaa	Pine shavings could contain oils and phenols that are not good for snakes. Aspen shavings, repti-bark, shredded newspaper and cypress bed are other substrates that you can use.

He is just fine.|`|bab98853150b199df79ea228be16f757aa	That's not a 'panic attack' ... it's your cat being a 'wild cat' who lives in a house and who needs exercise far beyond what you may think.  I have a kitten who does the same thing.  Her name is Storm because she looks like a little storm cloud ... and I 'hate her' right now for being so rowdy, but I also love her and expect her to be 'herself' and not the cat I 'want' to have (quiet, sweet, and always loving) ... because she may think she's a human (she even insists on drinking from a glass, not a bowl, because we don't drink out of bowls) but she is our kitten, and will always be our cat!|`|SnanuNKiaa	its called the Zoomies and its when a cat releases built up tension from being a lazy house cat.

UXfvkl9gaa	well hopefully she is not pregnant with a native mouse becuase it can give your mouse deases and the babies deases too wich could be harmful to you.you will know if they come out a brownish color.anywas she is pregnant and it sounds to me she will have here babies over the next few days,two sighns of labor is making nest this shows shes 1-2 days until she is in labor (not ever mouse does this) but one known source is when she starts bleeding out of her private part.this means she a day or even a few hours away from havig here babies.most people say that to leave her alone during this time dont after shes done licking the babies move them to a nice warm corner (and also provide your rat with toilate paper)(but not cloth this can be torn into string and can strangle the babies) hold all the babies each day so they can get your sent and it will make them tamer and more sociable.by the time there eyes open (about 2 weeks) start feeding them reguler mice food i hope she does have babies its a great feeling in life to have.have a good one!|`|JH9eOYUaaa	Theres no way to know for sure until about 2-3 days before she is about to give birth. The average mouse pregnancy is about 3 weeks more or less, and about a day or two before it will look like there is a handball in there stomach. Im a new mouse breeder and I have discovered that my first litter is about to arrive because my mouse developed nipples, even though shes overdue. That could be another sign. And be careful what you wish for, because when mice give birth they have about 9-20 babies at a time and when the mice are weaned they will give birth again, they may fight, and the odor and amount of food they eat will be insane. But there is also a chance that either your mouse got sick when it started eating others or maybe one of the wild mice was small enough to fit through the bars, but i doubt either as mice eat there babies when there sick at birth so i dont think its sick or there was an adult mouse that tiny. Hope this helps.
uBFhKXgHaa	It may help the problem, but it will not eliminate it. However, getting her spayed is a wise idea either way.<br>  <br>  Fixing your female has a lot of health benefits as well as ensuring that they won't add to the pet overpopulation. Spaying before the first heat cycle is highly recommended and healthiest in females as it reduces the chances of mammary gland cancer later in life to near zero, but even spaying afterwards has a lot of health benefits. Spaying eliminates the chances of uterine and ovarian cancer as well as eliminating the chances of pyometra (a deadly uterine infection). Every heat cycle a female goes through increases her chances of developing mammary, ovarian, or uterine cancer later in life as well as putting her at risk for developing pyometra.

However, you're the observer and boss.|`|AA10912383	She's an ankle biter because she wants to show that she's dominant (even though everyone around her is bigger than her).

I recommend going to a PetSmart near you, see if they have training. I'm taking my puppy to it, and it's working wonders!

kfmR3pb9aa	we had this problem with our chinchilla at first. he only would bite when we were trying to pick him up to bring to play. once we started letting him out more often and letting him jump into our hands instead of picking him up it helped like 90%. like the other person said though, if it is just little nips it might be a friendly gesture. if the bites are hard enough to see bite marks or bleed than it is most likely not friendly. chinchilla also do not like much change in their schedule. if you have started being louder during the day or maybe if you switched where the cage was, these could be causes of biting.|`|0nIwKd5Uaa	Does she always bite or just once and stops?<br>  <br>  If its just once and stops she might never stop. Chinchillas do what's known as a test bite on just about everything to see if it's edible. <br>  <br>  Also chinchillas are more grouchy during the day, so if your playing more during the day she is more likely to bit than if at night.
qOiv8d3Laa	I have 2 "altered" males who get along enough to keep the peace, but they aren't fast/close friends and "snuggle buddies!" The older cat may just dislike the uppitiness of the younger one.... you know, he's putting the young one into it's place... and they DO have a hierarchy!<br>  <br>  If the fighting gets to be too much, believe it or not, there are sprays available that contain a certain "pheromone" that makes the cats "like" each other or other people or DOGS, even. Well, it's not like magic, but it's sort of like "kitty cologne" that cats react positively to. You can find these in a good pet supply store, or online.

My cat has a huge jealous streak and often resents our Boxer because we brought her home. <br>  <br>  Usually cats will find their roles and sort out territory on their own, but it sounds like your shy one has taken the rejection by the other cat a little hard. <br>  When you call her and assuming she won't come when called, use treats to get her attention and come to you. My cats love Pounce Treats and you can shake the bottle so that your cat knows that "that" noise means something yummy! So shake or crinkle the treat container and set or hold the treat towards her in a non-threatening way and wait. Do this every time you call her and she will eventually come out when you call her without treats. <br>  Also since the other cat(s) have ALL of the room and spaces, try making the shy one a special place of her own. This way she will run and hide in her safe place instead of anywhere else. My suggestion would get her a tunnel or cube or tree that she can hide in like a cave and put it somewhere the other cats will likely not claim. Maybe your bedroom.
ydshiNrKaa	If you have never owend this breed before  you should contact a professional trainer who specializes in GSD and ask for their help. These dogs need firm handling.  They are very intelligent dogs, and will get away with anything they can.  They will pick up most tricks in a short period of time.  <br>  <br>  Anytime there is a "behavior" involved, it is most important to first rule out an underlying medical reason for the behavior. If all medical concerns are ruled out, then the problem can be approached as a behavioral one, and behavior modification techniques can be employed. <br>  <br>  Your veterinarian will be the only one to fully determine what is going on with your dog's licking.<br>  <br>  Depending on what your veterinarian finds on examination, treatment to stop this behavior will be aimed at the underlying cause. For cases of allergy or infection, there are medications and/or dietary changes that can be made to assist with the problem. In situations where pain is the underlying cause, that should be dealt with directly to alleviate the licking. Growths or abscesses are usually treated surgically. Pet owners should always be vigilant about environmental hazards to feet; such as deicing compounds in the winter and very hot pavement tar in the summer. <br>  Behavioral modification to stop paw licking and chewing, like any behavioral modification, takes time, patience and consistency. There are several topical products that can be used to discourage this behavior (bitter, hot taste, etc.). Physical restraint, such as an e-collar is often used for medical conditions to allow the foot or paw to heal and thus take away the inciting cause to lick. Distraction is also a good technique: playing games, offering other toys and incentives to keep your dog occupied coupled with positive reinforcement will help break the cycle. If additional behavior help is needed, consider working with a specialist in veterinary behavior|`|0UAAqjY8aa	It should be easy for you to train your german shepard.They are ranked in the top 3 most smartest dogs.|`|AA10912383	Hey, OK, I have a german shepherd puppy, and i've been taking her to a training class at PetSmart, and it's working wonders!!! <br>  To get him to obey in general, you need lots and lots of treats, and A LOT of patience! But make sure the treats are small (no bigger than a fingerprint), because you don't want him filling up too quickly.<br>  If he's being rambunctious, not listening, growling at you, etc, then pin him on his back (forcefully, but gently at the same time), because that will show dominance.<br>  If he's licking, it's either cause he's giving you a bath or because he loves you (he's giving you kisses!!). There's not much you can do about that -- it's actually seen as a good behavior (except when there's nipping/biting - that's when you say "ouch!" in a high pitched voice).<br>  If you're having problems with him going to his potty spot, I'm not too sure what to do about that. What you can do is when he does go in his spot, CALMLY praise him. When you want to take him out, say in a baby voice (like when you talk to a baby) "Let's go potty!"<br>  And what do you mean by "shake?"

Hoatzins. Wobei Letztere eine ganze Reihen von anatomischen Besonderheiten besitzen, weshalb man sie allen anderen Hühnerv?geln - je nach Auffassung der Forscher 240 bis 262 Arten in einer eigenen Unterordnung "Opisthocomi" gegenüberstellt. ) es sich in diesem Fall handelt. Dies ist besonders deshalb so wichtig zu wissen, da es mit Ausnahme einiger pazifischer Inseln und natürlich der Antarktis weltweit Hühnerv?gel gibt. <br>  Um eure breiten Kenntnisse der Biologie wieder zu wecken, z?hle ich nun erst einmal ein paar gemeinsame Merkmale der Hühnerv?gel auf. (Schlie?lich k?nnte es eventuell für meine weitere Kausalit?t wichtig sein.) Wir müssen erst einmal bedenken, dass die meisten Arten ausgesprochene Bodenv?gel sind und sich nur zum übernachten in das Ge?st begeben. Dementsprechend sind es Bisph?renv?gel (Boden & H?he). Dies führt natürlich zu einem Druckunterschied, dem die Galliformes standhalten müssen. Diese suchen überwiegend auf dem Boden ihre (haupts?chlich pflanzliche) Nahrung. Das führt dazu, dass wir wissen, dass die Eier eine ?u?erst minimale Dosis an animalischen Proteinen aufweisen. Ihre Beine und Krallen, mit denen sie gut graben und scharren k?nnen, sind kr?ftig entwickelt (ein Beweis dafür dass sie im Sinne der Darwinistischen Evolution zu den Siegern der langen Evolution geh?ren). Wenn man schon zum Thema der Fü?e gekommen sind, m?chte ich noch schnell erw?hnen, dass diese bei den Galliformes auf der Vorderseite zwei Reihen von Hornschilden, drei der kr?ftigen zehen weisen nach vorne, die vierte setzt weiter oben auf der Laufrückseite an (mit Ausnahme der Gro?fu?hühner und Hokkos, deren gesamten vier Zehen in einer Ebene liegen). Bei den maskulinen Vertretern dieser Art ("H?hne") und einigen Arten sind oft gro?e Sporen ausgebildet. Aufgrund ihrer kurzen, gerundeten Flügel und der gut entwickelten Brustmuskulatur verm?gen sie allerdings zwar schnell aufzufliegen, für weite Wanderungen sind sie jedoch eher ungeeignet.<br>  <br>  Nun zu den Schn?beln: Sie sind kurz, kr?ftig und gebogen. In einem weitr?umigen Kropf wird die anufgenommene Nahrung gesammelt und aufgeweicht. Danach wird sie durch den sehr muskul?sen Gastro (Magen), die ihr wahrscheinlich alle schon einmal in einer Fleischabteilung gesehen habt, mit seinen kr?ftigen Reibeplatten und mit Hilfe "absichtlich" aufgenommener Steinchen zerrieben. In Anpassung an die zellulosereiche Kost sind bei Galliformes die Appendices (Blindd?rme) gut entwickelt. In ihnen wird die Zellulose ( aus den Zellw?nden der gefressenen Pflanzen) durch Darmsymbionten (Bakterien; Einzeller, die im Kollektiv zum beidseitigen Nutzen der Beteiligten leben) aufgeschlossen. <br>  Die Biotope (Lebensr?ume), in denen die Galliformes leben sind sehr unterschiedlich: Hohe Gebirgslagen und ausgedehnte Waldgebiete, Kartslandschaften, Steppen und Kulturlandschaften sowie Tundren und Halbwüsten. Das einzige, was sie meiden, ist das Wasser, in das sie freiwillig nie gehen. Anstatt der hydrophilen Reinigung bevorzugen sie ausgiebige Sand- und Staubb?der, die zu dem Verhaltensrepertoire der meisten Hühnerv?gel geh?rt. <br>  Nun kommen wir zum Ei. Dies ist folgenderma?en aufgebaut (von au?en nach innen vordringend): Erst das Oberh?utchen, dann die Eischale (ihr lest richtig! Das, was immer als Eischale betitelt wird, ist in Wirklichkeit der Oberbegriff für Oberh?utchen und  Eischale, in der es Poren gibt. Danach kommt die Hagelschnur und dünnflüssiges Eiklar, dickflüssiges Eiklar, dünnflüssiges Eiklar, dickflüssiges Eiklar und dann der Dotter. Nicht vergessen werden darf die Luftkammer.<br>  Nun haben wir im entferntesten eine Ahnung darüber, worüber wir gerade im Begriff sind diskutieren zu wollen. Eigentlich fehlten ja noch viele Erl?terungen, aber im Zuge des Simplicismus, bleibe ich erst einmal bei den oben aufgeführten Fakten.<br>  Die simpelste Annahme ist, dass Hühner Eier legen, aus denen die Vorform von Hühnern ("Küken") schlüpfen. Dementsprechend entsteht für einen nicht so behauchten Geist die Annahme, dass es sich um einen pr?-postnatalen Kreislauf handelt. Wenn man sich aber diese wenigen oben aufgeführten, offensichtlichen Fakten begutachtet, l?sst sich der Knick in diesem vermeintlichen Kreislauf lokalisieren. <br>  An dieser Stelle f?llt mir gerade ein, wie ich in einem omnidirektionierten Faltblattstapel (vulg?r: Zeitung) von einer Scheidung in dem Vereinten Britischen K?nigrech las. Es handelte sich darin darum, dass ein maskuliner Angeh?riger der Rasse des homo sapiens sapiens (kein Australopithecus bzw. Troglodyt o.?.) einen Artverwandten der Galliformes bei einer inneren Energie von ca. 253°K (Das Kelvin, die Einheit der thermodynamischen Temperatur, ist ein Teil der thermodynamischen Temperatur des Tripelpunktes des Wassers.) intraanal gefickt hat. Ist das nicht ein seltsames Comportement? Dieser Mann wird nach darwinistischer Weltanschauung nicht weiter zu den Siegern der Evolution geh?ren.|`|a851326fbd874ef7d1c0be5b5dfe4c8baa	Das ist die Frage über das sich die Philsopen seit Jahrhunderterten streiten aber sie haben sich geeinigt das das Ei im eigentlichen Sinne und nicht als Hühnerei zuerst da war.<br>  <br>  Hier ein Bericht von Quarks & Co. : <a href="http://www.quarks.de/dyn/9968.phtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.quarks.de/dyn/9968.phtml</a>|`|bcba92239190c1567bd131f751cd18a3aa	ich denke das Ei    ????|`|dadcea4aa49dfee6ebe14424bdae51b2aa	na ich sch?tze mal das ei,und daraus ist dann soetwas wie der vorl?ufer vom huhn entstanden ,sei es durch damalige umwelteinflüsse (soweit man es so nennen kann) oder das sich 2 verschiedene Federviecher gepaart haben und dann diese neue spezies entstanden ist -was man heute huhn nennt|`|e88442a579db0f588f48d97f279cbbdaaa	Vielleicht hilft das ja, endlich diese Frage zu klaeren..... ;-)|`|4114ff4a11c6172c91d14c3721c0cd5baa	och neeeee.......|`|4f289d22394cb1086ddc43fdf63f0e3aaa	das ei|`|aae0af10755b9e70159122ae2d636b5eaa	Ich würde Ei sagen.|`|c4b717966272f2ef69611da3ca348d2faa	Das HUHN ;-) ganz bestimmt|`|e4227a2f0b1e658ff7d6bdc29449ad9caa	Denke mal das Ei... ;-)

ec1e3ed429f6a6c0b514f901daa49436aa	We don't use cages. We have a birthing center where mommas can be segregated from the others. It is like a giant playpen. She has access to the outside in a seperate fenced area. The rest of the dogs are basically like family pets. They all go to their playpens at night and are a allowed to run free all day in our fenced back yard. They can go in through doggy doors to get food and water whenever they want. I breed english bulldogs by the way.|`|38a7c4c296b90dc3979e2e370e31253daa	I went to one Kennel and they had the dog's own private room's with a joining doggie run going to the outside. I liked that idea because if they have to poop they can go outside, or just sit in the sun. This done kennel had two separate dog play areas. Which is good because some dog's like playing with other dog's and other dog's just like to hang out by themselves. They also took the dog's for walks 2 times a day. You want to make sure that you know about all kinds of dogs. The reason I didn't put my puppy in this Kennel is because the guy who ran it had NO idea about English Bulldog's. He didn't know that they can over heat outdoors if the weather was warm out or that they have short energy spans. This guy thought he could keep my dog outside all day long. If he did that he could of killed my dog if it was too warm out. My words of advice is to let the people going to use your service know that their dog is going to be well treated. Now a days people treat their pets as if they where children. I know I do! I think it's a great idea you have. It even better that you love dogs because that means your going to extra care of them. Good luck and I hope that I've been some help.|`|47004d6023833c5777866194b66ed33daa	Is being honest negative? We (well not all of us) aren't against kennels. We are against breeding of more unwanted pets while the shelters are full of them. If you are starting a rescue kennel no one here is going to do anything but praise you. If you are going in to breeding and you ask YA for answers That makes you a BYB or puppy mill no matter how nicely you put it. We don't need more dogs! If breeding is done properly you CAN'T make a dime!!! It will cost you! The only way to make money breeding dogs is if you neglect the needs of the animals for profit. I am not trying to be a smart a** I am telling the truth. I breed and it costs me thousands more than I could ever make. I am not willing to take the short cuts to make money. If you truly LOVE dogs, don't add to the problem. You haven't even reached the tip of the iceberg when it comes to breeding. You wouldn't be asking questions you would be one of the few on here that know the answers.|`|ab63713974d292dd69ecac3c2b117cd1aa	Research, ask questions, do more research. Any reputable breeder will be more than happy to answer your questions about your start up. You can also try breed-specific web sites and ask for input from that source. Best of luck to you.|`|94323a4965840598c7e9aa90b554060caa	Know the breed in side and out breeding is in no way to make money we breed only to better the breed we don't breed any dogs that do not pass strict test and only after they are 2 years old money is not the object here in any way I have been in the business for 15 years and in that time I have only produced 5 litters you have to have the right dogs the right temperament the right conformation the right back ground of the blood lines know the dogs you intend to breed get show titles on them a dog off the streets will not do if you cant get good dogs don't even think about going any further|`|5533315baf52d37c15df881c1e0dd1f0aa	Well after  30 years of breeding and training i know lots about cleaning POOP and keeping my dogs healthy.

Not only would it let the pet owners check in on their dog/cat, but it would probably lead to the employees of the kennel treating the animals better also, as they would know they were potentially being watched by the owner. If you did this, you could probably charge twice as much and draw in more business than you could handle.

Usually, a dog will chew out of frustration and fear of being alone. They are pack animals and your family represents his pack.<br>  <br>  Good luck....I can't imagine what that poor pooch looks like.|`|e981f4c39323e750be3c26316cf0d196aa	The  "dash hounds" like my dad called them tend to be more rowdy than Rottweilers.<br>  Rottweilers are built big and thick and most of all smart yet easy to handle. They are extremely loving and loyal.<br>  They were first bred by the Romans as war dogs. So they have to be comfortable around large groups of people, which is why they are really easy going. They do know, like all dogs do, when the right time is to go full-fang.<br>  <br>  If a daschhund is mated with a Rott, it is either the Rott was the father, or he had to stand on a chair.<br>  It sounds a lot, from the description, that he has the Rottweiler temperament, and brains. That is the best thing in a dog, especially around kids. He will definitely keep the Uglies out of the house.<br>  <br>  Oh and chewing heavy leather stuff like that means he probably has the Rottweiler face as well.|`|f16072f55c3a5dcce8f05f45296b0152aa	Do they really know he is a Dachshund/rottie mix or did they make it up as a guess?

Do you know its background from weaning until now? An owner who wants to get rid of a dog will tell you anything (just like horses and I know A LOT about them).  Think real hard about this and if you can't do internet research, try library books or talk to reputable pet stores. Doing research before buying can save you a ton of heartache.  Good luck to you!!!|`|1b6efcf4b38557ab6bc240b983f6073caa	First of all, a dog that height, length and weight is up for serious medical problems in the not so far away future.  By age 5 or 6 I bet it will have a slipped disc in its spine, or worse.  It is a mix that sets it up for a lot of physical pain in the future.  Weiner dogs have so many spine issues already, without adding the extra 6 pounds.<br>  Then, I would be careful.  Neither breed is known for always being consistent, and both have a reputation for biting or nipping.  For me, I would not take that chance.  There are a lot of mixed breed smaller dogs that would have a great personality.  This one might, but I would never trust it and would always have my eyes on it.<br>  <br>  But, I wish you luck, whatever you decide.|`|7d9cfe9ba59d958bf3f8c4f712d205e9aa	You have young children and need to know if your kids will be safe.

I use soap every two months for doggie baths that has oatmeal, it is really gentle on their skin. Also you can take the animal to the vet and they might suggest a vitamin or lotion that will help. If a dog is scratching it can be a number of things: Fleas, Dry Skin, Allergies, Sensitive Skin, the list goes on. I would suggest taking him to the vet, and making sure it isn't serious. If he tells you it is allergies than sometimes they will advise Benadryll or a perscription. Benadryll works great on my pups allergies.

Ela ficou num desespero total!<br>  Passa FRONTLINE neles, é muito mais fácil e n?o é tóxico. Eu só uso esse produto na minha cadela e é totalmente eficiente. Só precisa verificar o peso do c?o antes para comprar a dose certa. <br>  N?o usa Butox, n?o. Se quiser usar só no ch?o, aí tudo bem.<br>  Boa sorte!|`|AA12005596	Eu uso um vidrinho para cada 20 litros de água. Com 20 litros eu dou banho nos 3 c?es que eu tenho.

N?o é preciso enxaguar o ambiente com água e sab?o, basta jogar a água que sobra ou colocar outro vidro em água para o ambiente.|`|3mhVrFbIaa	Olá, na verdade o butox deve ser usado para animais de grande porte, por esse motivo deverá usá-lo apenas no ambiente evitando assim que seu animais fiquem intoxicados.<br>  Para passar nos animais de pequeno porte existem outros tipos de medicamentos mais eficaz.<br>  Dizem que é só diluir bem o butox que n?o tem problema, mas nunca sabemos a propor??o adequada para cada peso já que se trata de medicamento para boi e cavalos.<br>  Tome cuidado e boa sorte|`|97fAKEehaa	O butox é recomendado para pulverizar o ambiente, n?o use nos cachorros, pois eles ficam extremamentes debilitados, da enj?o, é horrivel. Pulverize o quintal toda semana, vc vai ver como vai diminuir a quantidade. Mas acabar é muito dificil. No dia em que pulverizar dê para os cachorrinhos um comprimido de capstar, pois matam pulgas e carrapatos na hora. A dura??o é de 24 hs. Cuide a sua casa, pois se houver uma infesta??o muito grande os bichos correm pra dentro dela. O único tratamento que adiantou para a minha cadelinha e gatos foi esse, sendo que tb (quando dá é claro, pois é um pouco caro) dou um comprimido por mês de program plus. é caro mas funciona.

O Butox é destinada ao uso em gado, por isso só deve ser utilizado no ambiente, NUNCA no c?o!! Cuidado tb com as m?os, os bra?os, enfim cuidado para n?o ter contato direto com esse veneno, use luva e se for pulverizar, use tb uma máscara, aquelas q os pintores usam, custa bem baratinho.<br>  <br>  O veneno pode n?o causar danos no cachorro logo de cara, mas fica no organismo e com o tempo ele pode desenvolver vários tipos de doen?as, inclusive cancer. Isso vale para a gente tb. Portanto muito cuidado, tá?<br>  <br>  O carrapato n?o "mora" no cachorro, ele vai lá só pra se alimentar, portanto, um talquinho resolve tudo, se vc usar butox no local onde ele fica.<br>  <br>  Vc n?o precisa enxaguar o local e deve reaplicar o produto após 15 dias. <br>  <br>  N?o demore, esse bicho se reproduz muito rápido... Beijo, boa sorte!!
cgWVfxGVaa	At the pound or from a shepherd rescue.  If you buy a pure bred pup for under $200, it most likely is not from a responsible/good breeder and will be more likely to have been inbred and have health issues.<br>  <br>  (Before all the backyard breeders jump on me, that is a LOW price for a healthy pure bred, you have to agree!)|`|0Aa0G7Jfaa	petfinder.com|`|AA11501528	You are better off getting a mutt for that price than a back yard breeder's version of a purebred or even worse a puppy mill.  I would recommend investing more and not having to worry about so many vet bills.  You will have the normal shots and check ups but shouldn't have anything more.  A friend of mine breeds GSDs that are great with kids and other animals.  www.weberhausgsd.com|`|debd9c746580dbc944784f9038b27ce7aa	Forget the good bloodline bit and go to <a href="http://www.petfinder.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.petfinder.com</a> to adopt a German Shepherd. The adoption fees are usually around $150 so it'll fit your budget. You will never find a quality German Shepherd with good bloodlines, tested for genetics etc. for under $200. <br>  <br>  If you can't afford more than $200 for a dog - how are you going to afford heartworm medication, vaccinations, check ups, quality dog food etc.? Having a dog costs a lot of money - can you afford it?|`|peBGF090aa	Good luck with that, $200.00 doesn't buy you much. You might be able to get that breed but I doubt that you will get the bloodlines and the good with kids part.|`|342b3711423c978836fa192cef3238d8aa	You're kidding, right?  You're not going to find a "good" German Shepherd for anywhere near $200.  And you do need to get a good one if you want a good, stable temperament as well as a dog who's breeder tests all his breeding stock for hip and elbow dysplasia, tests eyes and breeds only the best examples of the breed.  There's a plethora of back yard breeders breeding these dogs and you want to stay far away from them.|`|cf9d7a4fc1fb2659abd7a7ad86d605ceaa	Do NOT adopt a dog (or any animal for that matter) if you can't even afford $200.  It doesn't cost anything to buy an animal; it's the maintenance that's the killer!<br>  <br>  Are you aware that it is their RIGHT by law to receive medical attention and that to deny it is considered abuse?  Are you fully prepared for annual vet checkups, annual or bi-annual teeth cleanings (with anesthesia), and immunizations?  And those costs are on top of the office visit.  What if the dog becomes sick?  Think of the recent pet food recall where worried dog owners spent thousands of dollars at their vets (hospitalization for three days with IV fluids, etc.) only to have the dog die anyway.  What if your dog were to develop hip dysplasia (a common problem with German Shepherds), kidney failure, or cancer?  Can you afford a chronic problem?  Can you afford to CARE for an ailing pet?  Puppies can get serious illnesses too you know, not just old dogs.  Will you 'bother' with the extra work, cost and inconvenience?  Or will you decide the dog is 'too big' and 'makes too much noise' and dump him or her at the nearest place.  German Shepherds are BIIIIIG dogs and need room.  Do you have a home with a large yard or acres to roam?  Or are you, heaven forbid, in a condo or apartment?<br>  <br>  Will someone be home with the dog?  Do both parents work and pack the kids off to daycare or school?  Don't get a dog if everyone is gone.<br>  <br>  What is your lifestyle?  Are you active or do you flop into a chair and turn on the TV at night?  If you want a dog with good bloodlines, are you a fussy sort of person?  Dogs bring in lots of dirt on their paws.  Someone will be constantly mopping and washing the floors.  Dogs cover the furniture with hair.  And do NOT get a dog, then ostracize him outside away from the rest of the family!<br>  <br>  There's more to a dog than trying to impress your friends and neighbors with papers and good bloodlines.  If you want a status symbol, buy a Maserati.  And why would you want something expensive for cheap?  I would understand if you were passionate about dogs and showed them professionally - but you don't even seem to know the basics!  Do your homework first.  Take the time to do this right.  It'll end up a much better match for your family and, most of all, for the dog.  After all, he or she has to be of paramount concern since they have no voice and are helpless with whomever they end up.  After you take some time (I do not mean just three days worth!) and research this, and think about all these questions honestly, then your best bet would be to consider a dog from the humane society or a rescue organization.  Many fine dogs, who are already potty-trained and socialized, are waiting for someone to love them.  You and your family are inexperienced at this.  You need a dog who knows how to be around a family, rather than a puppy as inexperienced as you are.  An older dog will be less rambunctious too if you have young children (less likely to knock over a toddler), and will be patient and kind and show you how to be with a dog.

ZvID6Jhyaa	To start off, make sure the mother is in a dry, clean environment. If possible, move the mother inside to a quiet spot and build her nest or whelping box. A child’s wading pool makes a wonderful whelping box. It can be lined with papers, old sheets or towels and cleaned as needed by simply taking it out and spraying with water. <br>  <br>  Okay, so now comes the scary part: actual birthing. Let me tell you that this usually starts at 10 o’clock at night—the perfect time to prevent you from getting any sleep and late enough that you will have to go to the emergency clinic if you have problems. You will also want to make sure that you are wearing clothes that can be thrown away. Whelping is a messy business and there is some bright green goo that can be produced that cannot be washed out of anything with any stain remover on the planet. So, it is definitely a dress down event.<br>  It is normal for puppies to be born either head first or breech (rear first). If you try to assist in delivery, never pull on an ear or a foot; instead, try to hook your fingers behind the shoulders or over the hips and use very gentle downward traction. Some dogs will squat to have puppies; others lie down. <br>  Most puppies are born with the amniotic sac intact. If mom doesn’t attend to them within the first two minutes, it is time for your intervention. This membrane must be ruptured so that the puppy can breathe. Use a child nasal aspirator to clear the fluid from the mouth and with a clean, dry towel—each pup gets its own—dry the puppy and gently rub near the umbilicus to stimulate respiration. Use the dental floss to tie off the cord about an inch from the puppy’s body, and then cut it with the scissors and dip the end of the cord in the povidone iodine.|`|AA12306645	Oh, good.

Meu cachorro uma vez tomou esse veneno e tive que levar ele as pressas no veterinário para a desintoxica??o! foi por pouco que ele nao morreu! se vc nao levar ele a tempo no veterinário ele morre sim...|`|r3e6UrA7aa	Ao colocar veneno para os ratos temos sim que ter o maior cuidado para que o nosso amigo c?o n?o acabe descobrindo e comendo pois mata sim.

Esse asssunto é t?o sério que até com plantas tóxicas temos que tomar cuidado, porque sabemos que gatos e cachorros gostam de comer plantinhas de vasos e jardins, isso é um perigo!  Portanto, todo cuidado é pouco.|`|6d22f03ca3ea4e72981f3d343065cfb1aa	se mata ate pessoa, imagine o cachorro que e mais fragil|`|7d2f5321524bd999b048280f6f169812aa	Com certeza.

Perhaps the same Vet and tell her/him that her symptoms have not gone and she is still vomiting.  I would even get a second opinion.  But do not let her go much longer for dehydration can set in quickly.<br>  <br>  Best Wishes.|`|SsgVLUZkaa	umm.... what? Your question makes no sense.
ihQI2f0eaa	Raquel, é bom sim..principalmente reconstituintes do sangue..pois a doen?a do carrapato destrói as hemáceas causando intensa anêmia.<br>  Portanto procure algo a base de hemolitan e evite medicamentos a base de ferro que agem contra o medicamento do tratamento que normalmente é a doxiciclina.<br>  <br>  Valeu!|`|1YFeIblvaa	Você n?o acha melhor dar veneno para os carrapatos?<br>  Felicidades.|`|UcxRiCPZaa	1o LUGAR, carrapato n?o é doen?a, e sim uma praga assim como a pulga!!<br>  Eu tinha esse problema com meu pastor alem?o. O que você deve fazer, é passar um veneno no patio, comprado em pecuarea, para matar os que estiverem no ch?o, porém cuidado, fale com o pecuarista para ele indicar um veneno que n?o va fazer mal, caso seu c?o lamba o ch?o por exemplo. <br>  Quanto ao cachorro, a unica coisa que matou com eficacia as pulgas e carrapatos da minha pastor, foi o FRONTLINE, é muito bom e recomendado por veterinarios, vc deve comprar de acordo com o peso de seu c?o, e ler as intrucoes para aplica-lo, que s?o muito fácil. Esse medicamento dura em media de 3 meses, e depois voce tenque colocalo na pele do c?o novamente!!!!|`|AA12005596	Minha cadela Laika teve essa doen?a e tomou como antimicrobiano o Doxy 100 à base de Doxiciclina. <br>  Tomou vitaminas também, mas n?o me recordo qual. Naturalmente o seu veterinário saberá qual a melhor para o c?o.|`|6a6a0f8e155cc9ccce6580c5d216586caa	Oi Raquel! a minha gata teve essa doen?a do carrapato  e junto com o antibiótico ela tomou uma vitamina, segundo o veterinário para aumentar a imunidade e ajudar na recupera??o.

Após alguns dias de uso, eles n?o voltar?o mais. Pode também usar desinfetantes cítricos (laranja, lim?o) pois irrita as vias respiratórias dos gatos e certamente eles v?o evitar sua casa. Maso repelente é o mais indicado, além de ser inofensivo para todos os animais (inclusive gente...). você pode encontrar em um pet próximo de casa. Este custa cerca de R$25,00, mas existem outros mais baratos.<br>  <br>  Boa sorte|`|d8936b91579b7ac600cea04c252e6658aa	pare de dar comida pra eles, n?o brinque com eles, e use um esguicho neles, uma ou duas vezes que vc os molhe e n?o voltam mais.|`|380e2cbee4e654344facbb6940e654b1aa	áGUA.

Aliás, os animais em geral procuram os lugaresm em que encontram comida. Quando n?o acham, v?o embora.<br>  Eu tenho um galinheiro bastante grande onde mantenho cerca de 30 cabe?as de galinhas. Todos os dias pela manh?, quando alimento os bichos, surge uma núvem de pombos vindos da vizinhan?a em busca do milho que jogo para as minhas aves. E n?o tenho como impedí-los. Ent?o lan?o alguns punhados a mais para alimentar toda a "frota".  Mas tenho absoluta certeza de que as aves só aportam por aqui por causa do alimento que encontram.<br>  Elimine a possível fonte de alimentos e os bichos v?o embora por si mesmos.<br>  <br>  Ah, sim, e n?o adiantam os cachorros. Tenho três c?es que n?o espantam os gatos, e 27 gatos que n?o assustam os pombos. Quando há comida em jogo, todo mundo enfrenta todo mundo.  é quenem nóis, certo?|`|3cc5eb9286d962c970529beaaf8fc87baa	vc está certo n?o se deve maltratar animais ou mata-los, agora gatos é problema eles fazem coco dentro da churrasqueira e em todo lugar.<br>  quando eu morava em casa terrea resolvi colocando port?o fechado e cerca eletrica no muro.|`|6ApWTjMgaa	Pegue um vira Lata e implante cabelos nele. E o chame de floquinho.|`|aPItPIsMaa	Se matar os gatos, vc estará incorrendo em crime - Lei Federal 9602/98, art. 32 - crimes contra animais.Existe um produto chamado "n?o pode" que os gatos detestam o cheiro - espalhe ao redor de sua casa / n?o deixe comida alguma no quintal. E, se eles "visitam" sua casa, algum motivo eles têm - procure reparar o que atrai os bichanos.|`|c5ce773a7a60d4eadff6570bc2f69102aa	O problema é sério, e n?o se resolve de imediato. Faz muito bem em n?o querer "assassiná-los" esse é o verdadeiro termo para envenená-los. Se voce conseguir entrar em um acordo com seu vizinho, tanto melhor. Mas se nem uma conversa tranquila e séria com ele der certo, o melhor a fazer é impedir que eles entrem, procurando qual o local vulnerável do seu muro. Se for a altura do mesmo, voce pode resolver passando uma tela sobre o muro.N?o fica caro e os gatos n?o transpassam telas de arame. Teve um amigo aqui que sugeriu repelentes que se compra em Pet, também é aconselhável. Agora atirar água, n?o! Pode provocar doen?a nos bichinhos, gatos s?o muito sensíveis à humidade, e se o dono n?o perceber que est?o molhados e n?o enxugá-los poder?o vir a ter pneumonia. Além disso, a maioria dos gatos têm propens?o a problemas respiratórios. Acho que a melhor forma é mesmo impedí-los de entrar. Boa sorte.|`|jj7MiP6Daa	Adote um LE?O,os gatos v?o adorar.|`|z1MbSfhJaa	arruma um cachorro k n?o goste de gatos e k n?o fuja deles|`|8d2422b5e153c19253bf5453f0936bf5aa	Olha...<br>  <br>  O que vou responder é o de sempre... Jogue um pouco de água fria nos gatos... Assim eles v?o ficar com medo de retornar ao ambiente... Evite deixar lixo, comida, pois, atrai os animais...<br>  <br>  Converse com o seu vizinho para o mesmo se possível castrar os animais dele, pois, isso torna o animal mais caseiro e evita esse tipo de transtornos.|`|98c0a68bc2638b24713090dfd9589628aa	Eu adoro gatos, pode deixa-los pra lá. Mas se te encomodam tanto...Você pode usar produtor que d?o um cheiro que eles n?o gostam ou solte bombinhas (aqueles traques que joga no ch?o e estouram eles n?o v?o prejudicar os gatos, n?o use bombas fortes para n?o prejudica-los), os gatos v?o ficar com medo e evitar o seu quintal. Isso tem que ser feito varias e varias vezes, pois o gato aprende por repeti??o. Assim eles v?o te dar uma folga.|`|BLn27Qjqaa	olha, tambem sou contra violência, até com animais, acho que em primeiro lugar você deve procurar o seu vizinho e conversar com ele, explicar a situa??o, conversar ainda é a melhor op??o de resolver problemas com a vizinhan?a.|`|Nv1OeQmCaa	Ent?o sai de perto... tem um ditado que diz : os incomodados que se mudem.
