WGzJUSefaa	Check out this site, it has tons of cute outfits for every occasion.    http://www.freewebs.com/fashionstyling4u...
h4JEI9Uxaa	that's easy you should wear tight black jeans a red tank-top with a small black decoration in the middle and a black head band and a black jacket|`|yuIb3XwPaa	dark colored baggy jeans and a hoodie|`|67qWgasgaa	black skinny jeans and a black/red dressy/flowy top.|`|SwOQjBZNaa	Blair Waldorf always rocks something good for fun shoes, and wears a surprising amount of red.  You're in luck.    http://natalicious-style.net/wp/wp-conte...    http://www.gossipgirlinsider.com/images/...
pBMfANkwaa	id leave it,,, long hair on guys is nice!  all up2u tho|`|AKHywxwlaa	yes|`|blwDnJy4aa	Dude, this is YOUR hair. If you want to cut it, then cut it. What are you waiting for -- for us to give you permission? Cut it if you want. Just keep yourself well-groomed.|`|5UThHNrMaa	picture woud be nice o.0 but randomly i say YES|`|h4Sc2JDwaa	well i for one am going to need a picture to answer this one...|`|tzwjSxGtaa	yes|`|aY6EjDwjaa	dotn do it!  maybe have a trim but dont go too short  keep it long enough to gel up!  (my hairs massive, like an orange mushroom on my head, so i may not be the best person to ask about hair style :P)|`|G2K8gsKLaa	depends on your face shape it might not compliment it|`|ou104VaHaa	i think you shouldnt cause i look sexy with my hair about 5-6cm.|`|aSUCLiWHaa	NO don't cut it.
edAtsw3waa	Dermabrasion is a good choice! If that is too pricey, buy some vitamin E capsules (the oral capsules) and pierce one with a needle and apply over your skin. This is a method that doctors recommend after surgery. My friend had a tummy tuck and breast augmentation and she used this and has perfectly flawless skin, no scars at all!|`|YwHl37Hgaa	Vitamin E  prevents acne or pimple scarring and can also be used  to fade old scars. Use cucumber or other fruit and vegetable packs to cure pimple scars. More such solutions at  http://solutionsforpimples.blogspot.com/|`|FKXG3IPiaa	try Olay Total Effect cream , seems doing magic for girls.|`|aJ0AL6RFaa	wonder how Kabhi Alvida Na Kehna... knows!!|`|z1hZt12laa	The problem is not scars, but your mindset. They are nothing to be worried about. They will fade away with time. Just eat healthy diet and be cheerful and stop worrying. If someone likes you, he/she likes you because of your nature and not physical appearance. Be positive. Life is more about enjoying rather than worrying for such small things. Live life to the fullest. Dont get awed by the tv advertisements who show that physical beauty is of prime importance in life.|`|STjduXgfaa	I know how you feel coz I had passed that stage, lucky for me ! I would highly recommend Diamond Dermabrasion which is 100% safe and sure to reduce the sight of scars . It's 100% painless too if you don't have any acne or pimples during the time of treatment and would normally take 4-6 sessions depending on the patient's case . But not to worry about the slight sting on your skin during treatment coz it would  diminish immediately after the process .   Although quite pricey, normal cost is between S$200 -S$250 per session the effect is astonishing and your skin would be supple like a baby's skin . But you need to avoid the damaging rays of sunlight for a while to maintain the beauty of your new look.|`|uL8yHAf6aa	There's a product called Bio-Oil which is supposed to be great for fading scars.  You can get it from Holland and Barrett, Boots, I'm pretty sure Tesco even does it.  Here's a link for you to read up more about it... http://www.bio-oil.info/en/uses.html    Good luck    xxx
jNmj8nPFaa	I would definatley stick to the darker tones because if you go blonde it will look really unatural nd fake. But maybe some red-ish highlights instead.|`|RNfygDqsaa	i dont think that would look to good.  because your skin color will look weird with your hair color
jPKcb9w7aa	Tennis shoe style, because they're easier to take off and do up, and you can't tell the difference with jeans on =]|`|67qWgasgaa	tennis shoe style. while hi-tops are cool, they make your feet look huge, like clown feet.|`|3LPTLUczaa	I always go with high tops because that hides the laces, even if they do take a tiny bit longer to do up. I think the fact that you can see the laces is why they look 'like clown feet'. To be honest though, I just think skate shoes look like dwarf feet and chucks look normal.    I will also add that they are very bad shoes for standing up for long periods of time. They are so painful to go clubbing in I can only dance for about 2 hours before I can barely stand up. I was on a body-kinetic dance floor last weekend and lasted only an hour before I had to have a rest.    If you are a girl you are probably used to wearing painful shoes so may not notice it so much, plus I have high arches. I still wear them though because they go so well with my tapered jeans.|`|h4Sc2JDwaa	hi top|`|4g9UKpyVaa	get one of each.|`|eO429roGaa	Don't jump off any roofs they've got really thin soles and it makes your feet sting when you do.|`|C3sqTngtaa	shoe style|`|UyfTZYATaa	tennis are heaps compfy!|`|5HeNp5tjaa	u gotta go old school run dmc style Hi tops lol|`|9rPwNMiHaa	go low if u got smallish feet high top if u have big feet cause low tops are cooler and more comfertable but look like clown shoes if your like size 11 or something like my little bro|`|pP3131WYaa	tennis shoe type|`|28I8nSDPaa	hi tops|`|yfMmr7uGaa	low-tops are easier to put on for every day use  hi-tops take a while to get on and off but they look good  But so do low-tops  Just get low-tops lol
i4NkPeATaa	The roll on type has a "ball" that rolls the deo on whereas the stick semi solid and you kind of smear it on.     I'm notsure what you mean by "solid gels".|`|7S5EgDFVaa	Stick is better.|`|Pj1MWVBoaa	I got very sensitive skin in that zone and I tried many deodorants believe me and the only one that  is good and leaves yr skin beautiful is nivea pearl beauty roll-on ;)  NO sticks!
DmUyZdVeaa	They could have just faded your dark hair for you by taking it up with bleach, and then doing a double process with the blue/pink. Most of the wild colors come in a mousse form, or regular, but they arent permanent so you would just have to touch it up.|`|KPpVj0Yraa	its kinda hard to put light colors in dark hair. Instead of letting it fade, just bleach out the parts were you want to put the blue/pink.  i tired dying light purple over black...it just messed up my hair.  Hot topic sells cheap extensions, its like 2 for $6[something like that] they come in a bunch of different 'crazy colors'        http://www.hottopic.com  http://manicpanic.com/|`|KHXO5LPpaa	there is no way to get black out of your hair unless you have it stripped so i don't see how you will get pink in your hair black is the dominants colour you cant dye over it not even haven't your hair stripped will guarantee the colour you want|`|7AfRkORxaa	The hair stylists refused to lighten my hair as well. I bought 4 boxes of bleach hair dye and some semi permanent Flamingo Pink hair dye and did it myself. It came out really nice. But the bleach does cause my hair to have frazzled ends in some spots. Try this at your own risk.
ArrbBtY6aa	Jeans with a red or white top.  A denim skirt with a red or white top.  Pretty much anything as long as it matches with red!    BTW: You should definitely wear a color-coordinated outfit like that on Valentines Day! Cute!|`|Dr7hxYWQaa	this skirt:  http://www.polyvore.com/%E3%82%B9%E3%82%...    with a white tank tucked in, and some really cute jewelry like this;  http://www.polyvore.com/zappos.com_betse...|`|x8B4527Jaa	If it's a rich coloured red, you should wear dark dark blue jeans cause they make the colour pop.   I'd wear skinny jeans :)|`|UyfTZYATaa	Yeah jeans are a great idea or coloured pants.  I wouldnt wear them with a skirt because they are more sporty shoes.    Try these pants and this top    http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_pcipcC5wN8A/R9...    http://www.getprice.com.au/images/upload...    red and gren are complimentary colours so they look great together and the top could be white,red or green    Some other colours may go depending on shades.    :)  Awsum shoes|`|h4JEI9Uxaa	you can wear a short(until the knee) Flowy white skirt with red flowers on the corner and a plain red shirt with a small white jacket .|`|3yacqUltaa	If you don't want to go with the jeans and red t-shirt look, you could wear black or brown pants with a yellow (or most other colors) shirt, with a pop of red in a necklace (like a long necklace with a heart charm at the end or something) A lot goes with red, so there are many possibilities, although now that I think about it, I doubt a skirt would look good with those shoes. (just my opinion)  Hope I helped!
shaO0coWaa	I always thought she was prettier when she was younger.I don't think she's pretty now but she does have her moments when she looks gorgeous but I love her.|`|4a14dfd051c9e1157b10bc5abd40a5faaa	very pretty|`|WMMG7Fhwaa	OMG! I seen her and Im like OMG. Is that brandy! Her looks have improved so much. She is one beautiful girl|`|byHh0A3Eaa	I always though she was the offspring of Alien Vs.

SwOQjBZNaa	I enjoy it because the rest of your hair can be having a bad day and you pull it back.  With bangs it looks more put together to me, whereas all one length can look sloppy, and doesn't include any interest in the facial area.    Plus, I find it's much easier to do the "pouf" with bangs, personally.
x0flaLfUaa	My man does because its cold here. He's 34 and very sexy!|`|8dhe15MUaa	because it cold and i getting old now 48 year old|`|pRoyFWL6aa	Not since i could dress myself.I'm 46.|`|dCbIHBpGaa	No, not yet. I'm in my early 30s so am a bit young yet, I'm looking forward to the day that I'm old enough for one though that'll be cool. I'm also going to get some of those old people slippers that zip up the front and one of those tartan shopping trolley things (why are they always tartan?) that old people pull about behind them.|`|ddf97263e4bac13f02a3db67a26b8d53aa	no 49|`|i7o8yC5Uaa	Yes I do. Mind you it is a bullet proof one.|`|j9k3a0JBaa	I'm 21 and I sometimes wear a vest but not as underwear, more in a fashion sense, like under a shirt in the summer or something like that! Hope this helped.|`|9e1405bf185a865f8b87ab7c9380d12caa	I am 41 and wear a vest. I work outdoors most of the time and the nice cottony warmness it provides. I wouldnt be without them. Plus the missus thinks I look buff in them.|`|5w72XKFFaa	i'm not!!  i'm 17  n  i'm in indonesia  whom has two season  raining n hot!!!    so  i think its not important here!!    but  everything in ur hand bro !!      thanks!!
tFC13Xsgaa	wow your very beautiful  very very beautiful im not just saying that but if i saw u in public i would date you in a minute|`|nVQGpvuoaa	Actually I'm not jealous.   So if you my comment as jealous, than actually your making yourself feel better by even thinking that I would be jealous of you.  No your not hot.   I'm not "hot" either nor do I look at girls as being hot.   But I have teachers hotter than you.|`|f4422f216561e6952afc8a35de25e36baa	You have a nice looking face.  Its a pleasent looking face.  However, its a little hard to see the rest of you with the close up pictures you've provided.  Beauty is pretty realative though, and really beauty on the inside is best.  Meaning kindness for others, considering other's problems before one's own, and developing one's spiritual side.|`|6nW0eSQ7aa	your..okay.. nothing special o_O|`|1a03fd470e002c088b333c229350271faa	Wow, nice intimidation tactics there.    Conceited doesn't even begin to describe you, and you don't know what self-esteem is.|`|Cf8VzXVZaa	honestly? lose some weight. and dump the crackhead. he's pulling you down.|`|AA10626727	you look pretty hot but the girl on the right has nicer hair|`|MaOcrip1aa	The girl on the right has a mustache.|`|8UyUhlusaa	don't post the same pictures of yourself as you did a few minutes ago in another vain question. You think far too highly of yourself.|`|ArrbBtY6aa	Well you have a pretty face but I think you wear too much makeup (you look kinda orange and fake) and I don't like your highlights.|`|0IhCFeXLaa	if you know you are hot, why do you care what we think?    we are nothing to you but words with no face..|`|4b763bad020f3ed283fdcd243915642faa	You should have high self esteem all women should I think it would lead to fewer women allowing men to treat them like dogs. Though I must say generally people who insult others to validate their own beliefs are usually insecure.      Ugly or Cute if you dont believe you're the S.ugar H.oney I.ce T.ea, nobody will.|`|Fsr2Rofzaa	well, you try to damn hard to look "cute"  Your b/f looks like he needs to shower  You seem to be the bitchy one here!  How old are you?  You seem to be very immature posting this type of question|`|iJZ5Efb0aa	honestly, i can't even view the pictures because that site is blocked on the computer I'm on. but already i can tell you're one of those stuck up people just by the way you talk. therefore, it doesn't matter WHAT you look like on the outside, however, if your ugly on the inside, that's how people will judge you.|`|e3AnmkfUaa	Actually neither of these two are attractive. The girl is mediocre and the guy look like a huge critter.|`|h4Sc2JDwaa	you two would have big nosed babies...lol|`|3208995a056e331b2cc1bc88d9590058aa	you're aight. wear way too much makeup tho...|`|TLzbS8AIaa	you look o.k., but the pictures aren't very good and with that mop-head hanging all over you, it's a little distracting.|`|AA11648899	Which one are you?|`|NzSA6dmyaa	im pretty sure your the chick right   i think by asking this question u either have so secruity issues in the way you look which u shouldnt you are pretty good eye candy lol or your on a bit of an ego trip which does make u seem some what conceited and self absorbed, sorry it just does even if your not.     but yes your pretty nice to look at|`|brFVpD1Qaa	Lol,  I looked at em, and you actually arent that great, youre ok, look, looks are im portant, but personality is more, you sound like a stuck up little *****, having self esteem is good, but dont go over the top, you can think those things but dont say em.|`|JjoLo4e1aa	The girl is hot, but omg get rid of that looser , unless hes ya gay best friend|`|5UThHNrMaa	no do you even have eyebrows?|`|ugqaDJSRaa	u look like a pig...like u have a pig nose    which one is the boy??    constructive criticisim, get a nose job and lose some weight..ur face looks fat.    im not jelous...i know im hotter than u lol|`|G2w8Dgtsaa	Pig face  cheap hair  horrible bad attitude  YUK|`|ROQQYp6baa	ur not hott!!!!    and ur boyrfiend holy sh1t he is uggggggggggly|`|560dac2509e9d8f3af7a74f618d0fe86aa	i guess u r much confident ! and u hv a reason for that !! u r simply HOTTT !!!|`|Pti1VjSlaa	hot you're not.  in fact you look like a *****.|`|AA11615514	You're rather average looking in my opinion. I agree with you that having high self-esteem is a good thing but starting your post by saying you know you're hot just makes you sound conceited and that's not at all attractive. I also agree with others that your friend in those pictures isn't helping your looks. Get him a haircut, lose the hat and buy him a razor.|`|d5t5XgfVaa	you look familiar. and yah your hot.|`|3I3bdjAsaa	No|`|gkJrmFwqaa	oh they are the same photos, you should put some other ones up, as i said i would love to do so many things to you,    I would love to put 10000 of my "kids" over your face    your boy is a peodafile|`|GE4PfBpMaa	You posses alot of confidence - wish I could say the same thing for myself.     Well congratulations to you.     Could you rub off some of your vanity on me?|`|G2K8gsKLaa	lol bitchy girls..?     you kinda seem like one of those|`|TweZlF73aa	I'm sorry don't want to be mean or anything but you look like a monkey... or a pig... I"M SORRY i just don't think you're really all that attractive... but you do sound like you're full of yourself and that's what i hate about people... that's a major turn me off for me|`|cXj0RqExaa	You're not attractive. You have a huge nose, thin eyebrows on a wide face. You're conceited. You look like a whore, scrape off some of that caked on makeup. Girls who are modest are the most confident and sexy. All my guy friends find small girls the cutest. Small noses and cute figure. You're just... not pretty. Inside and out.    Oh and by the way little miss arrogance: self esteem isn't strutting around like you're all that. It's being confident enough to realize that you don't have to act like a stuck up ***** to prove you love yourself. Real self esteem is when you don't have to say a word, because you already know your worth. And what world do you live in? There are girls out there who are 100 times prettier than you'll ever be. Get a grip, moron.|`|uNd6OPCdaa	iz aright buh you aint dat hott rate u (n i aint a ***** i'm a guy no need to be jealous of a person like you) 5/10|`|KVx501CCaa	you look like this stripper that works at deja vu where my bf works|`|ns3E00FJaa	What does it matter?  If someone says "yes" you're going to write on your blogs about how awesome you are and how everyone should bend over backwards and kiss your *** and how "STRONG AND DEPENDENT" you are or how you fit in with whatever dime-a-dozen image you're trying to project here.  The more and more people stroke your ego, the nastier you'll become.  Your friends will be the first ones to notice - they'll abandon you for nicer people.  Your boyfriend will try to say something - he looks like the sensitive type - and you'll accuse him of being shallow or someshit.  He'll leave you, some frat with a shiny red pizza face will move in and take advantage of you, and once even he's sick of you, you'll be left on your own.  If someone says "no"  (like me)  you're probably going to put up a tough front and be all like, "BLAUUUAARAGH I AM TOO HOT **** YOU YOU'RE UGLY YOU'RE A JEALOUS CONCEITED BOTTOM FEEDING WHORE"...aaand when you go to sleep you're going to cry about it.    tl;dr: No.  You're not pretty.  In fact, you remind me of a boatload of girls I knew in high school.  But don't be sad!  Nobody is pretty - nobody but Boxxy.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcydqSpYN...|`|EZu2nIczaa	I think that you look great but you shoulde't have the guy in the pictures with you.
5SiFjlBGaa	In high school I used Maxfactor. It wasn't bad on my skin. I tried that dream matte mousse once and I broke out. Could be different for you though so I wouldn't completely turn it down. I like Maxfactor because its a cream foundation that dries to a powder. Don't worry, that stuff never faded off until I washed it off. I know you don't want department store makeup, but if you want something that will work good, and don't mind paying around $25-$30 dollars I suggest MAC. It's theater makeup so it is VERY thick. If that's a bit too much for your wallet just buy the liquid concealer. It comes in a little tube, but its lasts a long time (about $15 bucks).|`|BvjPU3wkaa	Best full coverage foundation in drugstores is L'Oreal's Infallible.  Some people find it to be a bit heavy but it might be exactly what you're looking for. It lasts all day and covers absolutely everything.|`|6eaa0b61f602657500c8e4340d6b6bfeaa	I am not so sure about foundation but here is a top tip .... I had very bad acne between the ages of 17 and 23 and have bad bad bad scars.    Whatever foundation you end up with put some Clarins Beauty Flash underneath. Day cream / or bare skin, then Beauty Flash then foundation....you need to put the foundation on straight after the Beauty Flash and very quickly, it sets together and it does not budge it stays put ....    I have told you this because I tried heavy foundations and ended up in a mess clogged pores etc.  By using a lmedium coverage foundation with the Beauty Flash it gave enough coverage and didn't block my pores.    Anyway hope you find a good product, know how you are feeling.    Good luck.|`|5p3m2fdFaa	Dont Use Dream Matte Mousse Like Some People Have Said,  It Causes Loads Of Spots.    Use Loreal Liquid Foundation,  I Used To Use It,  Its Really Good.  I Know Use A MAC One.  But You Cant Get That From A Drug Store,    xxxx|`|jeX5VZAtaa	I like Loreal...it covers really good.|`|gjtdLPIYaa	revlon colorstay foundation works great it's last all day and it has great coverage. that what i use|`|nN4ldjcBaa	Dream matte mousse works awesome. It is by maybelline. I don't always need the coverage but it goes on really well and feels light. It makes your skin look good and I have been commented on the way my complexion looked when wearing it. I know quite a few people who also have used this and love it.     http://www.maybelline.com/Product/Face/F...

Your brown boots would go, depending on what colour tights you are wearing, instead of black, i would go for a very dark brown instead.|`|cVeFGVNVaa	K HUN IM FROM IPSWICH MA STYLE I LIKE WHICH WOULD LOOK GOOD WITH TARTAN IS BLACK CRIS CROSS PATTERNED TIGHTS (NT SMALL FISH NET) THEN BROWN ANKLE BOOTS WITH A PAIR OF COOL ANKLE WARMERS WITH BROWN JEWLERY AND BLACK TOP  SUCH A GOK COOL LOOK .
oEM2YL6Laa	What ever you do don't henna it then go swimming! Henna is notorious for reacting with other chemicals (my friend actually had to go around with green hair for a little while when the henna reacted with something in her shampoo!) and chlorine is the most common chemical to cause problems in hair dyes. The general rule is that if you have gone darker then it causes the dye to leak and if you have gone blonder then it can turn it green (this can be fixed using tomato sauce of all things though!)|`|68Y4eOVzaa	i would prefer you go swimming while the henna is on ur head and then put a shower cap on my mom does that every time it is really helpful trust me she does !So it can dry while u swim!|`|4ceE9TFcaa	not a better or worse idea than swimming with any new hair colour.    will you tell me which colour it turned out?|`|cXj0RqExaa	I suggest not swimming today. Henna isn't strong (I have used it several times) and getting it super wet with chlorine will not help the color stay!|`|iHub3X6Gaa	Your pool water has just as much chlorine as your drinking water usually. I would not henna it and then go swim, I would wait 48 hours.    If it is a salt water pool it can turn your hair instant green. Salts, dandruff shampoos and sodium do not get along with henna. In any case lots of chlorine is not good for your hair.|`|LaQ8Ejt3aa	I would wait a few days so the henna can oxidize and not be affected by the chlorine.  And the excess dye will also have a chance to be shampooed out and not making the pool red.   have fun.  http://www.hennacaravan.com/shop/hair.ht...|`|8pLDp9rOaa	If it were me I'd wait a few days to a week before going swimming, or you could wear a swimming cap?!
xdSGmhZeaa	most guys prefer you natural .... the natural look is better, than overdoing it and looking like a drag queen|`|byHh0A3Eaa	maybe you don't do yourself up and look frumpy all the time|`|JjRhlOg5aa	your boyfriend told you to wear more make up?  what an idiot.|`|MaOcrip1aa	This is a semi trick question.  Most guys probably don't realize that they've most likely never seen a woman without some sort of make up.  To me, putting on mascara is like brushing my teeth.|`|yPTUG6uNaa	Natural... but just a lil eye liner|`|Cf8VzXVZaa	NATURAL    I've seen girls caked with make-up. They look like performers from Barnum and Bailey's circus.|`|9o8lEBSnaa	caked? no    Light is alright|`|tPV0MlgKaa	Natural,instead of looking like Krusty the Klown.|`|3208995a056e331b2cc1bc88d9590058aa	natural,|`|pTVxGebbaa	If you feel youhave to cover something up on your face, then caking on the makeup cant hurt, but if youve got nothing wrong with you, natural is preffered|`|cXj0RqExaa	That's odd, most guys say "Take off that make up, you're naturally beautiful." I have nothing to cover up, I just curl my eyelashes, since I'm half Japanese- I have long eyelashes but they stick straight out. If you have something like that going on, then you can use makeup. But if you're just all around average or cute- don't wear makeup. Embrace your natural beauty. :P|`|pV8oOns7aa	Natural...   only|`|Sgc6nhksaa	i prefer natural...|`|AA11615514	If you don't like wearing makeup you shouldn't wear it. If the only reason you'd wear it is because your boyfriend wants you to that's just silly. Plus you're only 17 and at that age girls look best natural. Wait until you're in your 20s at least.|`|hpFsK6DXaa	No makeup is what I prefer.

If you do these dresses, don't forget to have them low cut, with some tailoring or structure/wide belt/boning abound the waist.     We love our curves but some of us need a little help flattening out the mid section!|`|oubNwIzJaa	there cute lol, im a size 8 with E boobs :(|`|ZVHtkTS9aa	18 -20|`|73cdc2be7e02ca85fab096386ef11657aa	size 10 waist but size 16 bust!! Im stuffed!|`|YpfhKiSmaa	Hi, got small boobs (34A), size 10 waist, but quite often size 12 hips!
iQOI5AfYaa	The clothes are good, but the shoes and belt are kinda tacky. Black or darker brown would look much better. Get stilleto pumps or ballerina flats or even mocassins (in leather) according to your choice. Best of luck|`|Is3pmbbKaa	not the shoes.|`|3yacqUltaa	Pretty standard, except for the shoes, which don't look professional. to look less boring how about a little pop of color (light blue, light green) instead of that white shirt? Otherwise, very pretty =)  Hope this helps!|`|6H3zI2bKaa	Come on, hun, what's with the shoes? I would choose black heels to go with that outfit.|`|t7aTiWHhaa	i love that sort of fashion it looks so stylish,   i love the shoes there like vintage meets modern i love it.  lol yea you wouldnt look boring but like you have some style.|`|gG4iwHRfaa	If you want to be professional try typing properly. If you always 'text type' then you will lose the ability to spell words.

m5aenb6qaa	you might be having an athlete's foot or some sort of any other mild fungal infection. use a medicated foot powder followed by good foot hygiene (do not wear socks or shoes when your feet are wet, dry them fully first) and change your socks everyday. decrease your sugar or carbohydrate intake in your everyday food and take lots of vitamin C.|`|b6IWj7qhaa	firstly u should chang your socks everyday,  you should clean your foot before you wear them, it should be dry, apply powder which will help u to avoid stickiness, wear thin material socks, if you wear thick material socks then it will sweat, and start stinking, don't tie your show tight, should be air free.  i hope i helped!!:)|`|LIioMo71aa	wash your feet(specially between fingers) with soap and before goin out apply a deodorant or talc.    :)    !cool buddy!|`|VmKYQj9saa	smelly socks start with smelly feet, after you take a bath its important to dry inbetween your toes. any type of talc powder will help , and change socks after 10 hrs. this should help control oder.as far as the itching check with your doctor if the above doesn't fit the problem.|`|p9Z6WnGFaa	Wash your feet?|`|kr3PzD5baa	stop wearing socks, lol|`|os1ws4wIaa	Remove it by EOD..
GrnIjiMiaa	a mid-tone brown with red highlights would be pretty with fair skin    As for the growing out process - it would depend on what color your hair is naturally. Any permanent color is going to leave you with the dreaded de-markation line. If you're goal is to get it back to your natural color, then I'd die it close to that color and then put highlights and lowlights in it to give you some flair.|`|JjRhlOg5aa	light skin + blue eyes =  .............  RED HAIR!  like, bright red. not brown red like you've said.  red hair will bring out your eyes more.|`|bpDug8hsaa	go 4 brunette|`|9tMNpFmEaa	artificial orange!|`|7AfRkORxaa	Get rid of the red. Go for a lighter blond and get some platinum high lights and honey blond low lights.|`|9CAXUgOZaa	Brown hair looks really good with blue eyes.     Or you could for black hair, for a Katy Perry type look. She's got blue eyes and pale skin.|`|t7aTiWHhaa	well i dont like red hair at all so yea thats not my taste its either red blonde or brown not in between,  i have pale skin also but yea ive found that the darker your hair the whiter you look so yea its your choice but if i was you id go blonde no red.|`|fTFnsNQVaa	well if you are blonde with blue eyes, than i guess almost all the light colors will fit you, not black of course i think if you died it in light brownish color it'll be just right one... but i don't think really bright red will be good for you...  But actually if you have blonde hair i think you shouldn't be thinking of dieing it at all, cuz blonds are the best|`|aSUCLiWHaa	just live it blond because (light skin + blue eyes =blond hair)|`|jNmj8nPFaa	Definatley a brown tone. People with blue eyes look really good with dark hair.

DNLJwLZqaa	any of them.  depends on if you're going for a more formal look.  but i think all of them would look nice with the outfit.|`|h3rN7snkaa	The long sleeve black & white one, and the guitar T  =)|`|oubNwIzJaa	the second and third from the left are my favs, lol. but you have to wear it...  but there probably the only ones i would wear.  good luck in choosing =]|`|zWB3jHHPaa	i like them all except the 3rd to the left|`|jPf2TMgLaa	dorothy perkins jumper and leopard print vest  gorgeous! i want them!|`|b9cQN3FCaa	I like the 2nd, 3rd and 4th starting from the left.|`|ISzhKvE8aa	2nd and 4th top|`|R3Le2StSaa	The animal print top,the 2 in 1 vest top and the stripe bow jumper...|`|d5t5XgfVaa	the second one.its the cutest|`|7AfRkORxaa	The black and white long sleeved is my favorite.|`|b6IWj7qhaa	I would prefer 2nd one horizontal strips black and white one and other is animal print with a bow left side.. its really looking awesome.|`|V4E4t1QVaa	Personally, I like the two to the left. The tank is very stylish and original, while the striped long sleeve can match with lots of pieces.|`|rWOKfweKaa	The 1st and 4th one from the right|`|JufMBoLCaa	second and seventh, personally.|`|igrdohopaa	the second one is my favorite (=|`|t8gWcBaeaa	4, and 5|`|Is3pmbbKaa	all of them look 50's but the one next to the Sold my soul for Rock and Roll is my favorite cuz i like long sleeve v-necks. and skinny jeans with black boots go with that very good.|`|p9Z6WnGFaa	The stripy one and the tank top!|`|kep1iGHpaa	Two first ones are my favorite and they would go good with jeans too.
4UmmJkDfaa	I am 19 years old, 5ft4, and my cup size is an F!   I'm a confident person but my body size does sometimes get me down, i get back ache and can't wear the clothes I want to. My boobs also make me feel fat from time to time. A couple of weeks ago I started eating healthier and running because I heard excersise can firm and even shrink your boobs a bit. I do feel better already. Have you thought about excersisng? Perhaps you already do.     In general there is nothing to worry about. A know lots of girls who are the same as me. They are more confident and use their body shape to get what they want, and they always look amazing. Remember that some girls would kill for your size boobs. People used to tell me that all the time and I used to think "They can have them then" but I've learnt to make the most of what I got.    Personally I don't think surgery is the answer at all. It's very, very painful and costly. It gets you down to the point of suicidal thoughts, thats when you need to consider it, but only then. However, at the end of that day, it's about what makes you happy.       I wish you the best of luck :)|`|e6S1sdShaa	I dont think you should get plastic surgery  Its hard to learn to love yourself but is doable  maybe you could talk to someone in an underwear shop about what type of bra would be best for making them look less revelaing  and think about different styles of clorhing that will help  for example bubble tops and straight cut neck lines  you could also wear flowy tops and highwaisted clothes  another thing is hair.. if your hairs shorter your boobs will stand out more and you could think about maybe bright makeup that distracts attention from your boobs?  I think though that the best thing for you to do is go out with confidence and realise that many people have similar problems but many people are prpobably jelous of your boobs!  good luck hun and love yourself:)  xo|`|AEmD1Mtyaa	I'm suprised you don't get back pains. If you have a lot of problems with them, I recommend that you get them reduced to something more manageable.|`|dbCkTKDxaa	where biger shirts so people cant tell. but really i think your fine and there nuthing roung with you. but the guy thing i guess you just have to find the one thats been there for you a long time and get him.don't get then reducedbecause guy like the orinal and not a fake. a lot of girls have that problue it either to big or to small.|`|cXj0RqExaa	Embrace your natural beauty but if you can't learn to love them, reduce them. Do what makes you happy. If you get them reduced, they're permanently small and you can move on with your life.
le879npXaa	try applying concealer that is the same color or shade as your skin.. if it still doesn't work and you can't afford different alternatives, just be confident and courageous enough to accept the fact that you already have these marks.. i know it is hard but as the saying goes, beauty comes from within try.. feeling good and the rest will follow..|`|p9Z6WnGFaa	Try bio-oil!|`|w1kvhxX5aa	try vitamin e cream and the tanning bed this is what i did when i lost a massive load of weight|`|cwEGZdbNaa	Try the Palmer's Coco Butter.  Somehow worked for me...|`|cXj0RqExaa	I have a problem with Stretch Marks as well. Coconut oil or Cocoa butter. THEY WORK!|`|W1q9hV2Naa	Stryvectin is suppose to be good at making them smaller and is available off ebay at a fraction of the cost.  Good Luck.

iZy92gWRaa	I guess u have a good blow dryer.Apply some gel and make it straight and give steam(if you don't have a dryer) using hot water if you have dryer take a brush and brush it and at the same time show the dryer near the hair.Follow these steps your hair will get straight in 1 week    hope this helped..|`|90UfM1g7aa	hi   i use non chemical hair products and blow dry it then a straighting iron and i have wild hair|`|p9Z6WnGFaa	brush it ALL the time when it is drying!|`|kep1iGHpaa	Make sure its straight, like with a comb, when its wet and drying. Use an iron. Like the kind you do your cloths. Make sure its clean...|`|RbNN58Kfaa	you can use gel.....get a curling iron (1in) and get the hair and pull down. It works the same way.|`|VYMOwgc3aa	There are lots of straightening products you can use such as straightening shampoos, conditioners, & serums.    Just look for them at a salon or any store that carries hair products.    Good Luck |`|oubNwIzJaa	you can get your hair chemicly straigtened at the hairdresser or with a home kit, it makes your hair dead straight for a while and it works really good!!|`|pFxNunMxaa	There is a spray in a drug stores (like rite-aid) near the hair stuff like dye and relaxers etc  it straightens your hair with out a straightner   just the spray and a blowdryer|`|AA10645224	ADMONISH IT|`|9gqWnV9zaa	when its wet, dry it using a hair brush pulling downwards. this is almost a sure fire way to get it straight. or use a mousse, like pantene. but honestly, if you really want good results when straightening, get a cheap straightener...its your best bet :)|`|a2gkL3araa	4rectifying   r Eurofred  rug's rotgut

People think it does, because they think they look like a girl they think other people see them the same way....but they don't.    There's always something that gives it away, you can't loose the physical characteristics of your sex.    Apart from the obvious such as facial hair, build, voice, that sort of thing there are also the more subtle giveaways such your Adam's apple, your walk will be wrong, you'll sit wrong simply because you have something there that a female doesn't have, and your hands always give it away.    It works the other way as well, for the same reasons women can never really pass as men.|`|zPatGev2aa	jeans and t-shirt is suitable for you|`|b6IWj7qhaa	Do you wanna become Gay..?  if so watch Fashion movie.....
839be5UKaa	I think your inner forearm would be good. You should get someone to write it on you in different places to see which you prefer.      "Cervus lacessitus leo" is Latin by the way, its not "Gaelic"|`|C0HZ8ZB4aa	If your work is not a problem, on the underside of the forearm is a nice place for scripture tattoos. On the underside of the upper arm would also work. Upper back and lower back are popular places. If you wanted it written small, you could have it encircling one wrist, or written on three lines on one side of your wrist. Small and on three lines would also work on the back of your neck. Or written sideways down the side of your foot (not too low down though, as the ink tends to wear off). You can buy transfer paper to print tattoo designs out on and stick them on your body, so you can see how they'll look in certain places. On an A4 page you'd be able to print quite a few lines of the motto so you could cut them up and stick them in different places and see what you prefer. Here's a website that sells them if you're interested - http://www.craftycomputerpaper.co.uk/Pro... - it's an English site but you can pay in Euros or US $'s as well as 's. Good luck!|`|JLayHNZCaa	Across your breasts?  That way at the beach, people will have an excuse to stare?|`|w1kvhxX5aa	on your back|`|H3PcFertaa	Your letters should not be smaller than 1/2" to hold up well over time (with good skin space around).  Your script style will matter, so choose one that like, I think something flowing with flourishes would work well.  Then put it on a piece of paper and try taping it on different places of your body and move around to see how it feels and if it works for you and you like it.  I think the inner forearm would be good, and at a slight angle.  luck~|`|FS9ibKB5aa	you could have it going around your wrist like a bracelet. or around your ankle. i think both would be cute.|`|ByWRzuuraa	LOL at the 2nd answer!  Lower back  Wrist.  Foot  Back of neck.  x
JGQsowK9aa	your choice. however, the haircut won't look nice on you from looking at the pics. You look fine now.|`|6lmFyr2maa	lol are you ever gonna stop posting pictures of youself? yesterday it was "could i be a model?" today its "will this haircut suit me?" whats it gonna be tomorrow?    thanks for the free 2 points|`|p8rxpA98aa	I guess so, but I hope u have thin hair cuz the girl in pic looks SO frickin disgusting, I dono what it is exactly maybe it's the fact that she has too much thick hair for that style or the fact that I dono what the hell she did wrong to make it look like a comb-over, hell the whole thing looks like a freakin wig!!|`|h3rN7snkaa	Your really pretty :o)  But the hair cut....I don't know. It looks just like everyone elses.  I think you would look cute with shorter hair thats all curly. Can you sctunch your hair?  But I don't like the cut......  Good luck!|`|M0Oq4lRWaa	yes it would be co0l! =] go for it ^^|`|h9y9xN4Naa	i dnt thnk they wud suit u.|`|d5t5XgfVaa	yes. it would look good on you|`|tZ6hfFFPaa	i like your hair better as it is|`|jNmj8nPFaa	Yeah i think it would look good.|`|5CVjlklZaa	I think it would look good|`|0e3127e9ecee43459523cb403e3185ebaa	Very pretty face.  I think you'll look absolutely gorgeous in the haircut (since you've the almost the same face type as the girl in the picture). I am sure.    Good luck!|`|3I3bdjAsaa	No it looks like Blago (the Illinois Governor). Keep your hair the way that it is.|`|uyfC9l9faa	no ur hair is great|`|1t7Gu2swaa	i like that haircut+i think it would suit you because you look abit like the girl with the haircut!  you are very pretty by the way (:  hope i helped.|`|3293197d640e4637ba8fe6bac61525ffaa	Yeah of course, ur beautiful btw! :)  Do what you wnt to, buh i think u look good both ways hehe x|`|taMCpMxoaa	i think you would look good =]
DZB0WCmmaa	may be it's not my type of dance, I'd like something more energetic, legs and moving also included. this looks like a ... belly dance? May be if you had the music on, we could be more able to assess.    I know! you're trying to imitate Shakira? But she's not my type...|`|t8gWcBaeaa	hahah that was so wierd.  it was creepy  proly cuz theres no music n u just wiggling..NOT DANCING|`|qPJPjrkNaa	yeah your good :]|`|mtmMQH4Xaa	Dancing?

cwEGZdbNaa	3 simple steps to keep your face with a healthy glow:    1.  Wash your face with a mild facial wash;  exfoliate 1-2 times a week.  2.  Use a toner suitable for your skin type after washing your face.  3.  Don't forget to put on a moisturizer to your face.    Oil of Olay products works well with me, also Cetaphil facial wash.|`|p9Z6WnGFaa	Get a professional facial!

H3PcFertaa	I think that you have no idea how much skin is needed to tattoo that!!  That'll be huge. Letters should not be any smaller than 1/2" with good skin space all around, to hold up well over time.   And are you Catholic? If not, skip the rosary beads.  To be honest, I think that you need to skip this whole idea. With words, less is best, and you better want to have people doing all kinds of gymnastics trying to read it, and you should be ready to have complete strangers asking you to move your clothing out of the way, so that they can read all of it.  If you just want the 'idea' for yourself to read at times of discord or trouble, then par it down to the essence. Either an image or just a couple of words (you know the whole thing, you don't need to tattoo a book, just the idea).  Maybe: 'Let it be' or 'accept' or 'wisdom' or something like that.  Better yet, an image, like a rose with a thorn, or a flower loosing a petal... or something to move you forward in your life, like an interest .. something free and clear of past baggage.  Take your time, don't hurry, good luck~|`|X40Ww89qaa	i hope you have an extra wide lower back|`|Cf8VzXVZaa	umm...if you're not that into religion i would highly recommend against getting some rosary beads tattooed! That's just retarded.|`|YIplumj8aa	I agree with sand - that is too many of words for a tattoo.  I would suggest just getting the three main words: serenity, courage, wisdom.  Don't get rosary beads if you are not religious.  I would say getting the three words on a scroll would look best; put the scroll in front of a picture of something that has meaning to you.  Maybe a sky scene with clouds and sun or an ocean scene - I don't know I'm not too creative.  Maybe talk to your tattoo artist and see what he/she can come up with.
edAtsw3waa	Whatever you do, do not shave!!! I cannot stress this enough darl, I'm 18 and I really regret shaving but waxing is great!

eXMI11kkaa	for the eyebrow piercing question, i'd go with tripp's dad's answer. glass is autoclavable and is a very good material to be in a fresh piercing as it's hypoallergenic and does not leek foreign substances into the blood stream.    as for the ear piercing question. go to a reputable piercing parlour and have them take a look at it. If the hole has just closed a bit, they'll just taper it up for you. If it's closed completely, they'll repierce it for you. don't shove something in your ear by yourself as all you're asking is extra scarring!|`|S0UbiW1taa	my mate got his eyebrow pierced and he got sent home because he just couldn't take it out, it will close up within a few hours if you don't let it heal for a month or so. and also how long has your ear closed up, it won't hurt that bad, i pierced my right ear with a blunt stud didn't hurt, so you should be fine, unless it's cartlidge, then i'd get a professional to re-pierce it. other than that i'd just sterilize it and then BAM shove that bad boy in and you're all good    no need to worry about infections, they last like 1-2 days if your really unlucky....|`|HwrmAgzuaa	Normally eyebrow piercings, along with most facial piercings, close within the hour.  It could also depend on how long you've had the piercing though...I've had my nose done for about 5 years and I lost my retainer for work and I havnt worn a nose ring in it for a week now and it's fine, I just keep poking an earing through it every couple hours.    Same with your ears, if you have them for a couple years then they will certainly not close. My mom didn't put earings in her ears for  over 20 years (after having them for 10) and she can still put earings in.|`|4ZzLtY9Saa	you cannot take it out until it is properly healed, you will end up with the risk of an infection.  Once it has healed tho you can take it out and depending on how quickly your body repairs its self, usually a week before the hole starts to shut.    As for your ear the hole never properly closes usually.  I suggest you heat a needle (for sterilization) and try and see if it goes through.  IT WILL BE PAINFUL.  If not you will need to get it redone again.    I had my eyebrow pierced and am just letting you know it does leave a visible scar if you decide to take it out and heal and the holes will be visible in your eyebrow if you decide to take it out for work|`|dbCkTKDxaa	frist they clouse in 2 day if you have them out that long. and you can piercing your ears again.|`|1hKz7F6xaa	I wouldn't take it out straight away, it will probably scab up after a 4hr shift and would hurt quite a bit to poke the bar back through. You can easily poke it back through your ear though!    Use a plaster on you eyebrow, most workplaces should be ok with you doing that!|`|V3adr5MYaa	you can get your eyebrow pierced with a glass retainer.  till your eyebrow fully heals.    4 hours should not be bad once it is fully healed.      getgorilla.com
55c67b966222f06ee59b4e04b94476ffaa	you cant make your body grow. either it will on its own, or you'll just have short legs. there's nothing you can do about it.|`|edAtsw3waa	I feel your pain! I'm five foot too and I hated my legs coz they were so short and my friends all have bloody supermodel legs lol. I now love my legs as I do pilates. It helps to stretch and town the body without making you look chunky. My legs look so much leaner, well, all of me does now!|`|h0wDABGbaa	you should probably do more stretching.  your shins look short probably because your calves muscles are short and stretching would help.  search up the net and it would show a list of stretches that would help|`|XNBMzuxbaa	I'm pretty sure that as you continue to grow your shins will become more proportionate. Maybe try yoga to stretch out your muscles or something. I'm tall, 5'7.5 so I don't have that short of shins, I did when i was like 6 or 7. I'm 14 now.|`|HQFfb1Vvaa	You're only 15 so chances are you're still developing. Regular exercise and a balanced diet wil help give your body the strength it needs to grow properly. If you want a quick fix for going out, try wearing slight heels (nothing crazy though!) Also, stay away from wearing layers too much, they create the effect of breaking up your body into smaller chunks and make you look much shorter than you actually are.     Hope this helps, but remember good things come in small parcels!
yXGlmUqlaa	the actual piercing only hurts a little bit more, not alot don't worry. it's just very sore afterwards and swells up alot. just keep taking care of it though and it will be okay after a little while.    the pain is something that can be handled and it's worth it after.|`|HwrmAgzuaa	Rook hurts a LOT more  its worth it though...it only hurts for like 2 minutes|`|IIkoO1cRaa	rook def does hurt worse then tragus.|`|M0Oq4lRWaa	yeah it does =]|`|wXx0tMxnaa	omg i looked some pics up on google..it looks painfuuulll...btw take care of it when it gets pierced..if it ever get swollen it suxx|`|eXMI11kkaa	depends on the person. but generally, tragus hurts the least compared to other cartilage piercings, and rook hurts the most due to the amount of thick cartilage it goes through.    I have my rook done twice and it barely hurt. but i do have a very abnormally high pain tolerance. so, i'd say that it depends on the person.
ZwQZNkUUaa	Sorry, but the shirt shrinks because of the high heat of the dryer .. without that amount of heat ,.. it doesnt shrink .. ! So you will need to have a dryer and hot water to shrink a t-shirt! .. ..You could find some other source of high heat .. like a radiator.. or something like that ..or You could also always consume mass quantities of Oreos, pizza, and beer. Trust me ..It'll shrink..hahah!|`|H3h96s0Yaa	well all i can think of is radiators on full! hope this helps, if not then a new dryer maybe? - my dryers just broke too annoyin without it in the bad weather|`|rXInAcURaa	put it in the sun, leave it soaking wet and put light on it
UX0Otm6xaa	Is it the prep and prime in the black pump? I have it and I find it leaves my skin really oily and I break out the next day. I hardly use it and go straight for the spay on foundation which always stays in place even at metal show where I'm moshing and crowd surfing.|`|1NYr6K2Waa	Get smashbox photofishish! It is AMAZING! Best primer I have ever used. You can get a small bottle of it at Sephora for $17,wi.ll last you a while. SO WORTH THE MONEY!|`|1O1ZyEhpaa	Smashbox Primer is very good but it depends on which one you get varies in price $36-$42 but its well worth it
0mAeM1zGaa	I've only ever tried Fresh Brew in a lipstick - i'd recommend it though.    Never heard or seen Gesso before, though Handwritten is in my wants basket right now. I love the colour a lot. Sketch is also pretty, but I'd say I like Handwritten a lot more. (If you could, post a pic of what shade and colour Gesso is, i'd love to know.)    The paint pot colour that I currently want is Freso Rose, it looks like an amazing colour. I'd definitely say get that one!    Best of luck.|`|1O1ZyEhpaa	Lipstick- Freshbrew, Freckletone, Viva Glam VI    Lipgloss- Beaux, Big Baby, Love Nectar, Naked Frost, Chai    Blush- Sweet as Cocoa, Format,Raizin    Eyeshadow- Any eyeshadow     Have Fun!|`|UX0Otm6xaa	I must have something close to over $500 in MAC...lol. I have sketch and love it. I am not familiar with some of their newer colors. Tell me more about your skin tone, eye and hair color and I can check out the colors and help you out more.    EDIT- I have olive skin tone, brown eyes, and black and purple hair. I tend to go for MAC off the radar pigment on eyes with charred over just the lid. I also like to go green with humid and swimming and accent with 6th sin. Browns and golds with By Jupiter (a mixed eyeshadow), purples I stick with lavenders and violets. Blue I go with Silversmith mineralize. When I use sketch, I use it alone on with blacktrack fluidline. I love the fluidlines b/c they don't run, not even in the toughest mosh pits.     Fave lipsticks - Diva, Cyber, Budding Lust and Viva Glam V    Hope this helps at all.|`|5tewe7Ndaa	I haven't tried any Mac lipsticks...but go for the Freso Rose!  It is absolutely gorgeous!|`|wYid4ffjaa	1. Go with snob and fresh brew.. (You can mix the two together and get a color close to blankety.    2. Eyeshadows.. My favorite!! Go with Gesso((you can use it as a highlight for sure)) and Sketch is gorgeous!!((Look at Trax toowhich has a velvet finish))    3. And I like to use bare styrdy because I play with a lot of browns and golds which is great because bare sturdy has gold undertones..    Happy shopping!!|`|ljz5gKkYaa	For the lipsticks  I'd pick Snob & Blankety. I have snob and I love the color, it's great for a smokey eye combo. Blankety is definitely awesome, it's more of a natural and nude color but it's great to wear it with dark or everyday makeup.    Eyeshdaows  Gesso & Sketch  Gesso is a white color and it's great for a smokey eye look and it can be applied when you want to make your eyes pop! Sketch is a great color because you can make it look subtle or you can make it look dramatic.     For paintpot, I like painterly paintpot|`|Mvf4Fsriaa	If your skin color is somewhat like your avatar...i'd suggest    1. fresh brew...(nude is nice...especially beige nude) the blankety too is nice  2. handwritten  3.bare study ...is better cuz again its beige...and usualy its better to put a primer that is not so colorful so it wont change your eye shadow color...(i have the same and love it)|`|3293197d640e4637ba8fe6bac61525ffaa	Its really up 2 u hun  But i think...    LIPSTICKS:  fresh brew and snob    EYESHADOW:  gesso  and handwritten    Freso Rose!    Love it!!!!"!     x
m4mZMIMjaa	With a receptionist position the best thing to do in an interview is to sound confident and professional.  Seriously.  I can't stress that enough.      They might ask the stupid questions about your strengths and all, but what you say doesn't matter nearly as much as how you say it.  They want to know that you can talk on the pone and greet people in a personable manner.      What's important is that you don't SOUND nervous. If you can talk about yourself with friends you can talk about yourself with these people.  Just sell yourself.  You are awesome and you know it!  You will help people with what they need.  You like people.  You like to talk with people. Yada yada.    Seriously, as long as you sound good the interview will go well.  I can't promise you'll get it, but you'll be strong in the running.    Good luck to you!|`|P0EAzyw8aa	A lot of businesses will ask where you expect to be in 5 years time, they ask this to assist them in their decision to see if you have a plan or if you say you don't know they will know that you are not planning to stay at the company for long. they ask about personal qualities to see how you are in talking to people, if you are defensive they might not want to hire you because it might make you seem unhelpful to clients who call the company and no one likes a rude receptionist or one who talks on the phone to her friends or plays with her hair. Assuming people are boring is not a good start especially with the type of job that you are going for. A receptionist is one of the first people you see when walking into a company, make the people feel welcome and hopefully you will have a good phone manner and well dressed, stay away from tight fitting things and garish nail polish.|`|YmLcF2rSaa	be yourself and you will do fine.Being a receptionist is giving a person directory guidance so try to be informative.Act the part|`|p0Xw8hLZaa	No one knows exactly what they'll ask, it could be about anything.  most questions will probably be random.  One job interview question I got before was "What animal are you most like?"  They'll probably ask about recent jobs, and volunteer work you've done.  Think of some questions you'll want to ask them cause they'll expect you to ask questions too.  you could ask like "what are the shifts" or "what is the pay"  Hope I helped!!  Good luck, and stay calm!!  Dress casually, don't overdress!!|`|H3h96s0Yaa	They could ask anything so...usually they ask about your experience (if any) and why would you want to work for them, have you got confidence with using phones and doing multiple things, thats really it...good luck anyway! :D|`|a503b666151ed0372de7a61b9a0a5dd4aa	i'm a receptionist and have been one for 3 years. during my interview they asked me questions like what would you do if you encounter an unhappy customer? things like that. they asked about my past jobs. why i want to be a receptionist. what can i do for the company. why should they pick me over the other applicants. just be confident, don't act shy or nervous and good luck    So happy to hear everything went well, i love being a receptionist!|`|d5t5XgfVaa	idk but thats what i wanna be

9e290b6e3a41c23d1f0b05ef2407580faa	Una amiga se colocó dos cortinas de pelo cosidas y la verdad es que no les da un tratamiento demasiado especial. Lo que si hace es ponerle mucho acondicionador porque se resecan bastante.<br>  La primera vez se las cosieron para abajo y no podía lavarse el cabello con la cabeza hacia abajo porque se aflojaban. ?sta última vez se las cosieron un poco más sueltas y es como si el pelo fuera de ella.<br>  Una cosa es cierta, le costo unos días acostumbrarse al cosido, piensa que es como si tuvieras mini-trenzas apretadas al cuero cabelludo todo el tiempo y con peso colgado de ellas. Si no te aguantas un peinado tenso, no te las recomiendo. Además el pelo en dos meses crece dos centímetros, vas a tener que recolocarlas cada vez que las sientas flojas.

In short, you can pierce pretty much anything, anywhere.  A$$, anywhere on your face, anywhere in your mouth, anywhere on your body.  I had a surface arm piercing once.    or, you can even make yourself a wolverine hand piercing like in the comic books:      I highly recommend checking out BMEzine.co...    On their main page there is a link to their body piercing gallery.  This is one of the leading websites in the body modification industry and has a pretty comprehensive collection of pictures on just about every body piercing there is.  There are some other sites out there with lists of body piercings but most of them will not be as comprehensive as this.    As far as deciding what piercing is right for you, I would just look at all of the pictures that interest you on that website, then take a long hard look at yourself in the mirror and decide which piercing would complement you best. : ) You might end up getting something you never expected to!    Good luck!|`|TdGbIDH8aa	Snakebites- two lip rings on both sides  Nose Stud- A regular nose stud  Tongue Piercing  Septum- middle of your nose at the bottom  Tregas- In the middle of your ear  Industrial- bar at the top of your ear  bellybuttton  hips  corsette  orbital- all the way through your ear|`|lXaMph1Qaa	www.bmezine.com    why go through the trouble of copying & pasting names.|`|xoXkHOVsaa	Here is a link:  http://www.bodyjewelleryshop.com/body_pi...|`|AA12083230	No idea|`|mqxEw2daaa	angel bites|`|FS9ibKB5aa	A  Achilles Piercing  Ampallang  Anti-eyebrow Piercing  Anti-tragus Piercing  Apadravya  Apadydoe  Ashley Piercing  Austin Bar  B  Biceps Piercing  Bridge Piercing  C  Cannula Piercing  Catherine Piercing  Chain Piercing  Cheek Piercing  Chin Piercing  Christina Piercing  Clavicle Piercing  Cleavage Piercing  Clit Ring  Collarbone Piercing  Corset Piercing  D  DIY Piercing  Daith  Deep Chest Piercing  Deep Dydoe  Deep Hood Piercing  Deep PA  Dermal Anchoring  Dolphin  Dydoe  E  Ear Project  Ear Spiral  Eyebrow Piercing  Eyelid Piercing  F  Female Guiche  Finger Ring  Flesh Coil  Flesh Stapling  Foreskin Piercing  Fourchette Piercing  Freehand Piercing  Frenulum  Frenum Ladder  Frenum Piercing  Frowny   G  Guiche Ladder  Guiche Piercing  Guiche Tunnel  H  Hafada  Halfadravya  Hand Web Piercing  Helix Piercing  Hood Piercing  Horizontal Eyebrow Piercing  Horizontal Eyebrow Piercings  Horizontal Hood Piercing  Horizontal Navel  Horizontal Philtrum Piercing  Horizontal Tongue Piercing  Hymen Piercing  I  Inner Conch Piercing  Inner Labia Piercing  Inverse Navel  Isabella Piercing  K  Knuckle Piercing  L  Labia Piercing  Labret Piercing  Lorum Piercing  Lowbret Piercing  M  Madison Piercing  Madonna Piercing  Magic Cross  Medusa Piercing  Microdermal  Muscle Piercings  N  Nape Piercing  Nasal Tip Piercing  Nasallang  Navel Industrial  Navel Piercing  Nefertiti Piercing  Nick Piercing  Nipple Piercing  Nipple Pocketing  O  Oral Piercing  Orbital  Outer Conch Piercing  Outer Labia Piercing  P  Permanent Piercing  Piercing Technique  Prayer Piercing   P cont.

5eb91cf6975ab0255d6bcd6a2f138343aa	Personally I think its a sweet gesture he wants everyone to know he isn't available and hes showing you how much he loves you..I have a rose tattoo with my kids name and my husbands name and the so called tattoo curse that you would break up in a year i don't believe it i have had mine for 3 years and we are more in love everyday..but if you just don't like the idea tell him or maybe he could do it in a way that only you two would know that its there like hidden in a special symbol or something..But personally i love the idea of my husband having my name on him.|`|z0B0fyT6aa	Tell him you'll change your name|`|Lzt1eIZFaa	Tell him to get something done that has a special meaning between you two, NO NAMES.    I got a tattoo  on my foot of me, my Husband and kids' birth flowers. It was something that meant something to me and is not as drastic as a name.|`|3kNblp7raa	this is a tough one because i always swore i would never get anyone's name tatted on me except my kids. my hubby & i were high school sweethearts and he truly is my soul mate i know that even if we split he means something special to me. he's my best friend the one i can tell anything to so i did get his nickname tatted on my shoulder in chinese characters and if i do end up changing my mind it can be covered up. so maybe just sit down and talk it over with him but if its something he really wants to do then why stop him as long as he knows the pros and cons, right?|`|6kxWMPEQaa	I would just be honest with him and let him know how you feel about it and your reasoning for not wanting him to do it. If he loves you enough to get your name tattooed on him, then he will love you enough to understand why you don't want it and will respect that. You could suggest something else for him to get while your at it. Something meaningful and personal to your relationship.  And possibly you could get something matching with him if you like tattoos at all.     Again, I am sure if your just open and honestly with him, he will respect that.  And if he doesn't, then I would think about that fact before getting married.     Good Luck, I am sure he will understand.|`|k6CSa9caaa	As someone else said, its a curse.|`|tnsxlvQ9aa	do his best friend , it worked on me|`|sLrPhfnDaa	Ask him to think about it practically.Tell him if he loves you enough he wouldn't have to do anything so drastic to prove it.Maybe get to know the reason why he wants to do it.Its probably to show how much he loves you.If he really does love you he will be convinced if you try enough.|`|2vyYsSMkaa	Tell him ull dump him|`|JZqdXpLYaa	Just tell him how you feel about it. My fiance and I decided that we eventually want to get that done, but only after we've been married a while. We figured we'd start with matching tattoos first.|`|P0EAzyw8aa	awwwwwwww how sweet, if you don't like tattoos it can be done tastefully in cursive writing.|`|MV0lMuDMaa	Im with you on that one.  But hey, youre not doing it at least.  I would let him do it I would want my boyfriend too lol.  Just think, every girl who sees him will know hes taken automatically.|`|0IhCFeXLaa	tell him NO  cuz you dont want to see your name SAG on his skin when you guys grow old together|`|AA12034021	Tell him you are going to change your name.  :-)|`|AA11447210	It IS a terrible idea. See if he'll agree to a symbol or something instead, that represents you or his feelings for you, but if you two go your separate ways wouldn't be apparent to anyone else that an ex was permanently inked into his skin.    The ONLY names someone should consider putting on their body are their children's....NEVER a lover/partner/spouse (those relationships are not frequently permanent).|`|106b0861b9e6921cff2d55a1208f8283aa	Pretend to call off the wedding and dont speak to him for a day or so. When you do speak to him make sure he first thing you say is, "Now, do you think the tattoo is still a good idea."|`|zjuMrDmGaa	Remind him of the Tattoo Curse (every tatt artist knows this) the minute you tattoo someones name on you, you break up within a year or so. I know one tatt artist that refuses to tattoo names on anyone at all unless it's their kid's name or a memorial for a relative!|`|N5eCi9t6aa	well let him because he wants to leave you he wontget another girl haha;  unless there name is the same :)

Next time you wear them in the snow, make them completely dry by putting them in front of your heating system. but you should try not to wear them in the snow! Also try to find a spray to put on them to kinda "waterproof" them (idk if you have that where you live, but we do have this kind of product in France, in shoes shop)   Hope you'll be able to get them back the way they were!   xxx|`|pGLbEEgjaa	u are retarded you don't wear your uggs in the snow the are not water proof so if i were you i would go to the leather store and ask them|`|qFL8AhJJaa	You Never Wear Uggs In The Snow One; And Two Get Ugg Spray From Where Ever You Got your uggs from;I Got Mine From Robert Wayne;;Its Ugg Chealer There;;
2eb49dff81e9b58e57410c44098a55dcaa	step away from the flowbee!!!   As a professionl hairdresser, I can tell you the worst mistakes we fix are do-it-yourself haircuts.  Please, please, please, go to a stylist.  In the chicago area you have boricks, cost cutters, fantastic sams, great clips and super cuts. the average price is only 12.95.  while this is more expensive than free, chances are good if you ask for the manager to cut your hair, you won't be regretting it for 6-8 weeks.  For that matter, try a beauty school, they usually can't mess up anything so bad the teacher cannot fix it, just please, please, please, STEP AWAY FROM THE FLOWBEE|`|ff08701ba99bc32bce27e033daa525e8aa	They don't sell flowbee's anymore.

Gfzzn1Pgaa	I've never been to one and until now, I didn't know what they were. Thank you so much for letting me know though; I'm into that type of thing too =)    As to what you should wear, I'm not really sure. Something you wouldn't mind getting messy I guess, or you wouldn't mind if something stained or anything. I think you should wear what looks nice, but is still comfy and allows you to get messy in places you want to =)|`|oubNwIzJaa	whats gungee lol

TCpTlCTRaa	It depends on how much hair is falling out. Any type of manipulation can cause hairs that are already in the resting stage to shed. If you wear your hair pulled tightly in a bun this could cause traction alopecia. It is best to wear your hair loosely as often as possible. You can get more information at http://vzbotanicals.com|`|Ra8cdjbDaa	yeah.  Your hair falls out naturally throughout the day.  The thing is when you pull it back or put it up often you'll notice it more because it's trapped up in a bun and you see it falling out all at once, and pulling it tight to be up in a bun can be pulling out a few more than normal.|`|KRqz1dOcaa	yeah, when your hair is down strands fall out and you barely notice unless one drops on the desk in front of you.  when your hair is up it can't fall out, so when you untie it more appears to fall out, also when your hair is tied up tightly the hairs that are dead will get pulled out a bit (just like if you give your hair a good proper brush or blast it with a hair dryer
d22485692988d69072ce69e83f1d7bceaa	Growing out a relaxer takes patience, but depending on how much new growth you have and how relaxed (straight) your hair is, you can use products made to enhance/define waves and curls.  <br>  <br>  You can also try "setting" it.  With a defining gel or molding cream, gently twist 1 or 2 inch sections of towel dried hair around your finger and leaving the ringlets to dry.  Sleep on a satin pillowcase or pin hair up in a loose bun at night.<br>  <br>  Hair can be relaxed to a wavy texture that allows you more versatility: Wear it wavy with product, or flat iron to make it stick straight.<br>  <br>  Ask your stylist about transitioning your hair texture.  They will have more product and care suggestions for you.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|243cff06972f8083196c7ca4d4990824aa	Until last year I had hair down to my knees and cutting it was a big step.

sSXWP0braa	i got one when i was 16..when they pierce it, it isnt too bad becasue they will usually put a numbing cream but thenafter that u have to take care of it really well in order to not spread any infection..and it will hurt for about a week..it will be difficult to bend and sleeping on ur stomach is a no no..after that it shold be fine as long as u take care of it...ive had it for 4 years now and i forget i have it so id say go aheadd|`|PkYeNAd8aa	Different people feel different pain.... but mine didnt really hurt at all....|`|4ZzLtY9Saa	It isn't too painful a little sharp nip, but for the first 2 weeks you can barely bend down and can't wear trousers over your belly button, also watch out for the bar getting caught on clothing etc,, it is exteremly painful, mines got ripped out this way =(|`|UYnZtJ2daa	No one can tell you how painful it is. It's different for everyone. I didn't feel mine but I've heard girls say it was the most painful thing in their life.     Tips? Go to a reputable piercer who knows what he/she is doing. And be prepared to maybe come across some piercers who won't pierce someone so young.|`|Rn7nTmz8aa	I have a belly piercing. i got it when i was 17. i didnt think it hurt at all|`|aROel4yzaa	Well I think you should wait at least till your 16 (:  It does not hurt, but it depends on how you take pain.|`|a503b666151ed0372de7a61b9a0a5dd4aa	i have my nose pierced, 4 earrings in each ear lobe, and my belly button pierced. I'm going to be completely honest, it hurt. On a scale of 1-10 with 10 being the worst i would say it was a 6.5 it was more of a quick pinch and then a burning feeling. Definitely worth it though. I love it. Takes 6 months to a year to heal fully. You have to clean it alot and don't touch it, its more likely to get infected than any other piercing.|`|lTAORAPraa	personally to me they look horrible!

It just depends.|`|Au4gWgEiaa	It all depends on where they are and where you want the next ones.  If you have lots of face ones and want another one... that might be too much.  If they are all on your ears and you want a face one or somewhere else on your body, that's great!  If you want more on your ears... that's cool too.      I guess just try to have some sort of balance and it should look fine.|`|yXGlmUqlaa	well...where are they?|`|a503b666151ed0372de7a61b9a0a5dd4aa	depends on where they are, i have 10 piercings. 4 in each ear, 1 nose ring and 1 belly button ring

xoXkHOVsaa	When you get money, put it in the bank.  Don't keep a lot of cash around.  If the money isn't right there for you to spend, you won't buy as much food.    Research weight loss.  You need to find a HEALTHY diet and exercise plan.  I know people who have tried weight watchers and it worked great.     You need to have clear goals in mind and a plan to meet them.  If you are focused on something important, you will make better decisions.|`|HpWujntlaa	Calm down!! Just calm down. Nothing is so bad that you can't make it better with a little positive thinking and organization. Just take one thing at a time. I'd focus on becoming organized first. For that there's plenty of things you can do. There's books you can read. Just find a book on organization and read it. Everything else will come in time once you have that. Your life is a mountain or a mole hill depending on your own perspective. If you see your life as something you can manage, then you absolutely can manage it.
GJCUCVSMaa	yes, I work in a salon and a large amount of our income is from the manicure pedicures.

AxkVvgBFaa	you have a nose that takes away from the overall beauty of your face.  you should get your nasal bone chiseled down a bit for starters.  your hair is a good length (maybe a little shorter) but needs to have more volume.  it's way too flat.  you want it to compliment the shape of your face and have it come inwards to wrap perfectly around your chin/jaw.  now THAT would be a face i'd like to f@ck.    tidy up those eyebrows too.  that adds the femininity that you seek.  you also have pretty decent lips for a man-bear-pig (South Park reference for the peanut gallery) so i suggest you go with something that's not too flagrant and loud.  might i suggest Satin Plum, Sparkling Cider, or Blushing Nude.  then we'd really be looking at a set i'd like to pry open with my anaconda.    let's move on to fashion.  i like what you have done in general.  i like the fur boots with the skirt.  and plaid nonetheless.  the necklace works.  and i even like the bust you have given yourself, however you chose to do it.  i also absolutely love the pink bedspread.  that shows you at least take this seriously.  i don't really know how anyone else does, but at least you do.    you know what?  forget everything i just said.  you can start by picking a damn gender.  that might help.  it certainly would help the rest of us not be as confused.  why don't you just call up Robin Williams and Nathan Lane and have a night out on the town.  get some old school pantaloons and a sexy bustier and be done with it already.  i'm sure they're hiring at the Birdcage.  you can sing right?  i mean, i do see a guitar in the background.      i get the feeling you are one of those borderline goth idiots that slits his wrists after school before his parents get home.  sad cry for attention dude.  particularly sad since they apparently don't even care enough to notice you are dressing like a chick.  if they don't notice a skirt, breasts, and fur boots, how do you expect them to notice the subtlety of your scarred arms?    best regards,    -Mayor McCheese|`|AMXMZLjZaa	Pluck your eyebrows into a slim and defined shape. Mascara, eyeliner (not liquid) Is always good and foundation with a bit of compressed powder on top to set it.|`|SVCtlCzBaa	Dude , you lookbetter as a dude.|`|4EIebdn1aa	u look fine as either.|`|Ss4bkvDgaa	perfect!  wow, I couldn't even tell to be honest... :)  put on more eyeliner though, and mascara,|`|zY5ruug7aa	thx for answering my mascara question. u look sooo much cuter as a guy!! sorry i know that's not that answer u were searching for but it's my honest opinion.|`|JdFgf575aa	get a nose job.|`|gLXzVbm8aa	you look better as a girl if you wear blush, and liquid eyeliner on your top lash line and mascara you will be good to go.|`|nDQOwAA3aa	is the second pic photoshoped|`|l69tjl0paa	You look so pretty as a girl! I would say, pluck your eyebrows for more of an arch, and use eyeliner and some lipgloss, but don't over do it, your naturally pretty!|`|HGv8Lbd1aa	You make a pretty girl. Maybe try a fringe?|`|ctJc4jotaa	you're pretty as a girl so i think you should get your eyebrows done and maybe contour your nose to make it less prominent it works like a charm. also you could try wavy hair some blush like nars orgasim.  you should check out youtube videos if you want to learn more about makeup they have some awesome gurus aboywearingmakeup, makeupgeek, and pixiwoo are great|`|bL3rzrEYaa	Well if you are being a girl permanent, I would def get a brow wax. But I duno if you just like switch back and forth? B/c then you might have a problem. But yea eye brow wax would def help and make your eyes stand out. Mascara always is a must, and lip gloss. A little blush is a good idea in moderation, but if you have a manly-shaped face you might not want to accentuate your cheekbones. Just go to MAC one day or one of the makeup counters at Macy's and have them do your makeup for you and give you tips, you will love it!     For your hair try to give it some volume, just play with it with some hair spray, but your hair looks good and healthy. I honestly think you would look amazing with like some bangs, like this:    http://www.simple-hairstyles.com/wp-cont...    For your wardrobe, try to get a few tops that give you a waist line, like tops that have some kind of belt at the waist and sort of flare out at the bottom. Watch What Not To Wear on TLC, they give you so many tips on stuff like that.    I hope I helped!|`|jjo5siKBaa	wave your hair with mouse, purple-ish eyeshadow or brown-ish eyeshadow, pencil eye linder on the bottom lid in just the corners, pink/red lipstick with a clear gloss over your lips, a light touch of pink blush  and i would try brighter more pastel colors|`|jbxGEdVbaa	Wow, The Hamburglar is fighting the acidic puke that is trying to escape his mouth. I found these pictures deeply disturbing. But who the hell am I to judge, I'm a McDonald's character for pete's sake! I would ditch the cross dressing thing if I were you. If you're interested in guys just keep yourself looking like a guy. Cut your hair and go for a cleaner look. I'm sure there are dudes out there that will take you for how you were originally made to look. Don't pretend to be something your not. No guy is gonna be thrilled if he throws a hand up the skirt and finds more than he wanted to. You're just gonnna cause problems for yourself.    -You've just been sacked by The Hamburglar (in a totally heterosexual manner)|`|jvFhoov7aa	you look good as a girl  i like your hair and think you should keep it like that.|`|edAtsw3waa	You have such a gorgeous face! Try some really full black fake eyelashes, they would look cute. Red or cherry lips that suit your skin tone would be good too.|`|dyQNG6V8aa	You look great in both!  As a guy, you look like you should be a member of Kings of Leon...which is no bad thing!!    As a girl, I'd say you're face would look more feminine if you thinned your eyebrows a little, nothing drastic but just a little.  Some blusher would enhance your cheekbones if put on correctly and give you a more feminine face shape.  Smile and dust blusher onto the fattest part of your cheek (I call them my hamster cheeks!!!).      You're eyes are lovely, so I'd make them a feature.  Again, nothing too heavy but I think liquid liner along the top lash line and lots of mascara, nothing on your lower lid, this makes eyes look fab and they stand out more.  Invest in some eyelash curlers, careful not to pinch your eyelid but hold the curlers on for a good ten seconds then apply one coat of mascara.  Don't go too heavy with first coat or they'll go clumpy.  leave for a few mins till dry to the touch then re-curl and re-apply again.      Your hair is great, but using straigheners to give a gentle curl to some thin sections would give you a different look to poker straight.  Just take a thin section from the top layer of hair, curl around the straigheners and slide with one movement will give you ringlets.  Do this in evenly spaced sections and you'll have fabulous curls!!!!    P.S if your eyelashes are quite short, get some natural looking falsies, they are a godsend!!    Good luck and you look great.|`|fCc1vqkNaa	i think its better for u to look like a guy..  but u need to do something to ur eyebrow..  no plucking anymore..  keep ur hair short..  make it spiky..  then dye it black..  whoa..  that's nice..  trust me..  =)|`|gVRma7Mxaa	you look better as a guy, just get a haircut ;)|`|y8dTsfdxaa	are you originally a girl or a guy?  i think you look really pretty as a girl and actually you look like a girl  you look hideous as a guy im sorry but yeah  your pretty as a girl not gonna lie haha|`|lwlZ4x2Naa	when you dress like a girl, you look feminine enough, but i guess some tips would do a little enhancing.    get side bangs and do a little work on the brows. also, get some eyeliner on the top lids of your eyes, some blush, and a natural lip color on the lips and voila you're more feminine.|`|VvRHin1Jaa	Wow!! i think both pics r amazing and u r absolutely beautiful!!!!!! u roc!!!!!!|`|lOQQKkL8aa	better as a girl|`|JB9BCdBHaa	I think some blush, maybe get ur eyebrows waxed.

All i would say is do something with your eye lashes.  It would make a good improvement|`|SzZxgHdtaa	Wear some false lashes which can be tricky to apply or wear some really good mascara.  I think it is good that you have a natural look, it makes you look less like a guy, so many people wear too much lipstick to look more like a girl but it makes it more obvious that they are dudes (hope this made sense)|`|D0ShtJJJaa	You've got a great body!  Honestly you could be both, although your face it a little manly  well that's because you are a guy  lol    Where ever you are from pick up teen mags like Dolly or Girlfriend if you are from Australia or Seventeen if your from America So teen mags like that always have beauty tips on how to apply make-up, latest fashion trends, latest hair styles ect..   You will find everything you need to know in these kinds of mags on how to be a girl!

And tips for eye shadow, use the color eyeshadow that is on the opposite side of the color wheel then your eye color.    It'll make your eyes pop!

(sorry i have this thing for gay/bi/and beautiful crossdressers! i'm in love with Ville Valo...idk...i think it's hot)    i think you should try to change up your face with make up. like more vibrant colors. anything that will give you subtle femine accents.  you definately need to do something about those eyebrows though. idk. i thnk you look good overall|`|dCZbry2Iaa	i like your hair, please keep it that length. i've always liked long hair on guys and hate it when people tell them to cut it.|`|GExBSFGBaa	Side part you hair so you have more bangs. and use eyeliner, blush, and lipgloss. =]|`|NeF4rUujaa	i think a girl. you have amazing cheek bones as well. so i suggest some blush for sure, and maybe go fancy with eye makeup lol. as you can tell by my question, i don't know what colors, but it's easy to look that stuff up. also you have great hair... ever thought about side bangs?    thanks for answering my question (:    ps; if you go with a girl look, try plucking your eyebrows.|`|DPyHhKFJaa	i think you look better as a girl. but if you like yourself as a guy you might want to cut your hair!!!!!!!

FS9ibKB5aa	how about "inhale" on one wrist and "exhale" on the other..?      to everyone who is making rude remarks you all  need to grow up a liitle. Not everyone can as "perfect" as you. Find something better to do with your lives other than using the internet to be whiney little bitches.|`|uD1UFdRsaa	I don't have any as of yet but I'm planning on designing my own tattoos. It will be a long process but yeah hopefully worth it.     Don't get it done unless you are 100% on it. Don't set yourself any time limits on the decision either as it is a very important one to make. You don't want to regret it in the future. It should be something meaningful to you to. We (or anyone else) can't tell you what to put, it's basically up to you. Have a long think about it.     Make sure to keep me updated please! :D   Good luck!|`|kCdISEGqaa	My husband has medical alert symbols on his inner wrists to alert responders of his diabetes and heart condition.|`|6YTjC3Aqaa	how about "damn " ,or "bella " ,"signora"|`|N3fywkEfaa	I have a tattoo on my right inner wrist of my sons name.. its a good place for something meaningful as you can cross it over your heart..|`|bnEQozqZaa	i have a tattoo on my inner wrist and is a music note   http://mindpetals.com/wp-content/images/...|`|Rn7nTmz8aa	I don't have one but my cousin does and it says daughter. But if you aren't sure about what you want maybe you should wait, just so you can be sure you want a tattoo.|`|I44n8Eb1aa	hey hun!!! I've seen you in LGBT!!! yay!!! hahaha anyways.   think you should wait until you are Absolutely positive about what you want before jumping to a decision you might regret later.  those are all beautiful ideas, but they are all very different.  and it'll be on your wrist, which is pretty visible.  I really recommend sitting with an idea for at least a year before you but it on your body forever.    and if you HAVE to get it next week, I would go with 'breathe' because its simple, but I would get it somewhere less obvious like your ankle because you still aren't to sure.|`|olMJz5uEaa	Never go get a tattoo just to get one, you always need to plan your tattoo before making a date to hit the shop in my opinion. A tattoo needs to be something special to you.     A lot of my friends have went and just picked out some generic on the wall design and got it just to do it then regretted it later because theyre stuck with something they thought looked "cute" or "cool" at the time    As for the suggestion though: Get something that truly speaks to you...personally I like designs on the wrist more so than words. Words are so blunt and flat out but designs can speak in ways words can't.    But yeah pick something that speaks to you...do you have a passion? Like do you play music or do art? find an image or design one centered around those things.    Hope you find something that works for you!|`|6kxWMPEQaa	I would put alot of thought into what you want to get.  I don't think getting an idea from strangers online is the best idea when it comes to putting something perm on your body.  A tattoo shouldn't be something you get just to get.  It should be something that is meaningful and personal to you.  Also think about putting it on your wrist.  In the future is that going to be an appropriate place.  Not all job locations approve of tattoos. Seriously put alot of thought into your tattoo before getting one.  Trust me I know I love tattoos and have a bunch of them and know the feeling of wanting to get one just to get one.  But down the line it doesn't always work out that well.  Make sure it is something that 50 years from now you are going to feel the same way about having it on your wrist as you do now. Like people who get stars, yes they are very trendy now, but in 50 years when they are not the trend and these people have meaningless stars on their body how will they feel about them? I personally don't have any on my wrist because I already have other tattoos that I have to cover for work and don't feel like wearing long sleeves everyday in the summer.     Good Luck!|`|757689131b0b1f85d533f06a9c3197d2aa	I have one on my outer wrist- it's a special nickname my best friend and I call each other.  She has the same tat.

Check out the website above for more info|`|WI8wRpYCaa	don't wash your hair for months. I used to know a guy who cracked an egg into his hair every morning to get his dreadlocks to stick. In short, dreadlocks are stinky unless you do them right, and even if you do, they're usually pretty disgusting. This is from the child of a professional hairdresser though. I'm not sure if a barber can give you dreadlocks though.|`|AOtlKX2Vaa	my personal opinion? just don't do it!  But I think there might be some barbers who do these kind of stuff.|`|peqxyAyjaa	i don't really know much about dreadlocks,but when i was little i had my hair in a bunch of small braids and didn't take them out for a month and they started to turn into dreadlocks [and i could still wash my hair]|`|xglOR1bXaa	NASTY!!!!    if its for one day bc you really want to thats fine...but those ones that you keep filthy for months...GROSSS no1 will come near you lol
aIS1asOjaa	The first one is lovely :)    i would love to have hair like that ... the second one isn't as nice as the first and would be harder to maintain, the first one would look nice even when you can't be bothered to style it :)    xx|`|oG96QlHWaa	number 2 its so pretty and beautiful!|`|VWp2kD9Baa	I like the first one.  However, if your hair is heavy, you should get long layers cut into it to add some volume.  That way, you could wear it either wavy or straight.  Just a thought.  Also, I don't know your age, so that plays a factor with the length, as well.|`|P0EAzyw8aa	Layers are flattering to a thin face but not if you have a wide jawline as this will accentuate it.

7STihXONaa	ur hair is freakin cute!     i can't think of n e thing tht would b professional and still be funky like tht     but your hair would look awesome with a streak of blue or pink on your bangs...eventhough you cant do tht...     the only thing i could think of you doing is fringing it up a little bit more on the top and add some more hairspray to make it look a little more choppyish... and spiky like|`|yp3ktx0Caa	dreads|`|yfMmr7uGaa	Have it cut so it goes just past your boobs or even on your boobs, have choppy layers and a choppier fringe. Pin your fringe back for work and leave it for normal days or even pin it back with more colourful pins. I can imagine your hair is quite flat so if you have choppier layers then it will give it more body and make it look nicer.|`|BENiX8eDaa	At work you should somethimes wear a high ponytail, rat comb it for volume and pull some tendrils from the crown forward, and possibly wear it with side swept bangs, if not bangs, side sweep front section and clip behind ears or let sections hang down...just experiment with it, but definately comb  the crown of the ponytail  kind of messy and put just a little hairspray in it for volume and texture. whenever i wear this my bf thinks it's sexy, and it's still professional enough for work.|`|kg0ig2Edaa	What about your hair is annoying you?  If it's merely that you think its boring why not put in a little colour?|`|q2DDsmOCaa	Do the opposite.  Chop it like Rihanna and make it blonde.

iZy92gWRaa	Take a bath at the beach the salt will help to remove the Colour, bleach it again with the same colour of your hair(more darker that's better).Don't use  more bleach it may cause such problems like splitting of hair and roughness.Trust me bleaching is not so good for hair it cause more side effects then you cant resolve it again......|`|f6A6UM2taa	i would just dye it back dark again, but if u do get a dark brown make sure it as red in it otherwise it wont cover the bleach. gud luck!|`|edAtsw3waa	Lol I had that prob when I was white blonde!

zZTszxsjaa	try nioxin shampoo and condittioner. it was origally for cancer patients and you had to have a perscription, but now it is sold in salons everywere. it is for thinning hair, it makes it grow in thicker and fuller, its kind of pricey but if you give it a few months it will work. my clients love it!|`|54vVryulaa	I'm sure that every case is different, but in my case I was unable to find anything or anyone who was able to help with my thinning hair.

I now have several wigs in different styles, so if I want to change my look for any reason it's as easy as slipping a different wig on.
27K8chw9aa	I really like the color of your hair now . If you want a change then why not try getting some highlights put in?  You could get blond or you could try something a little crazy like Red or Blue. Hope this helps ,good luck! =D    Btw you don't look bad at all =D|`|P0EAzyw8aa	2 shades lighter or one shade darker will be the most flattering. I think some highlights at the front would look nice, although the colour you have suits you. maybe try a different haircut.|`|tdbelYnNaa	i think that this color is really nice on you. But i know everyone wants to change their hair colors =D therefor, i would die it a medium brown, and get some honey highlights in your hair, that would like really nice with ur skintone. hope i helped (:|`|tACJnpI1aa	Just keep it that color it is very nice. Or if you looking for an outrageous color, try blue. It goes well with darker hair. I've dyed my hair blue many times.|`|bzAUVDEpaa	I think a dark purple/ blue would look good ;D    Or a brownish red if you're going for more natural.      Edit:  That's a good photograph- you could try Photoshopping different colors on it :)|`|PTTpVBWvaa	The color you have is beautiful on you. But I totally understand the need to change, I do, alot! I think that a warm golden brown would look really nice on you and complement your skin tone.|`|7AfRkORxaa	The color you have now suits you. Maybe some high lights but nothing drastic.|`|wdLEmjkNaa	with your face and complexion i suggest you dye it a brown color (like in the picture), a darker one, also you should get highlights, a lighter brown but not that much lighter! i think basically that whole hairstyle would look good with you

ygyBx1Xhaa	Wash your face somewhat gently with baking soda and water. The baking soda scrubs off the dead skin cells gently. Rinse it off. Then take vinegar (preferably apple cider vinegar) and mix it with water. Then put on your affected area. Should clear right up, if you do it every day or so.     Do not use toothpaste or Listerine, and don't squeeze!|`|AA10595892	I hear that Newtragenia has a facial wash.Also avoid choclate and junk food.I also heard that stress and worrying causes pimples.So avoid that too.|`|O6Il5q91aa	i know a online shop that will surely help you. they have tips and products that are guaranteed effective and very safe. http://skinwhiteningexperts.com aside for whitening products they have skin care products.|`|7jqUpkIDaa	use BIORE NOSE STRIPS for your nose:) they really work and they have strips for face so thats good:)    for the oiliness dont use a moisturizer or just use a bit but yeah    NO POPPING!    theyre are face washes for the open pores so try those    BIORE!!!    DRINK LOTS OF WATER!!|`|wdLEmjkNaa	believe it or not your skin also depends on what you eat. Cheese makes you break out a lot. Its best to stay away from cheese, lobster, junk food, or anything that has oil really. You should start using cle de peau products. no matter what you do DO NOT use oil based products. For the cle de peau get the franche cleansing foam, and the black head cleanser. It is very useful. For pores you really cant do much about it. But if you really want to clear your skin do this: warm water opens the pores up so when you use the cleansing foam mix it with warm water, then scrub it on your face, then wash it off with cold water, as it closes up your pores again. Also you should use the transparency mask at least once a week, it helps with the oil control and the black heads and it stops pimple growth imideatly. Also if you want to stay away from the wrinkles do not tan, as it dries out your skin. Due to your excessive oil i dont think you need moisturizer. I hope this helps! if anything you can always e-mail me. But for best results i suggest you go see a dermatologist! Sometimes there are things like lazer treatments that can help A LOT|`|Ukr0HsmWaa	clearasil or exfoliating cream less fatty food helps to
gqopFVeyaa	You probably were pierced with an 18 or 16, so that is fine. But remember that any sizes further than that will require you to wait huge amounts of time (think 1 year per stretch), simply because cartilage is not elastic and trying to force any bigger sizes too quickly can at the very least hurt, at the very worst crack or shatter it. That one size change should be fine, though.|`|rtx0YQDJaa	16 gauge is a size smaller than 14.  it depends on what you were pierced with, if what you have is smaller than 16 you would have to stretch to get it in.|`|j6j3AvHwaa	yes, i guess technically you could use anything, but the farthest i would go is 14|`|PkYeNAd8aa	YES!!!

HhmhSBpgaa	There could be many reasons. Hormones, thyroid, stress, diet, surgery. look at the hair strand if it has a small bulb at the end it is falling out if  there isn' then it is breaking. Everyone has a shed season or some hair sheds all year round. I do hair and everyone is different. If your hair isnt looking thinner I would not worry to much yet if it is looking thinner then you do need to see a doctor.  Shampooing it or brushing it will only stop this if it is breaking, then  if it is you need to get on a hair care regime.|`|2404nDvSaa	mix together what the first two people said|`|AA11475052	I would a dermatologist about it, just to be sure.

mp5Vg7Peaa	some eye catching effects are:    [x] apply a thin layer of Vaseline on your eyelids and put some loose glitter on the top.     [x] try Mac's fake eye lashes, they do some really long ones which look awesome!    [x] body gems at the inner and outer corner of your eyes look cool, you can get all different colours from claires.    [x] if your liquid eyeliner has a good nib try drawing a cute little beauty spot by your eye or if your feeling experimental draw little stars Kat Von D style!     [x] when your doing a bold eyeshadow such as electric pink try sweeping it out towards the corners more then usual to make it look more striking, kinda amy wine house style but with eye shadow.    [x] I notice you haven't got this on your list but cheek bone shimmer looks fab with gel glitter patted gently over the top of it.  for the Shimmer try either- Benefit- Highbeam or Mac Cream colour base in Hush. For the glitter try urban decay glitter gel.|`|gLXzVbm8aa	have you tried fake eyelashes like on that show where they were trying to find the best make up artist. i was trying to get the  name of the show or the link to Lifetime Channel but my internet at work isn't working.|`|dyQNG6V8aa	http://www.hollywoodgrind.com/avril-lavi...  - pink, lots of fake eyelashes and glitter, punk!    http://www.theage.com.au/ffximage/2007/0...  - dark and smokey eyes!

Now where to start? If you want to go crazy with eyelashes; http://www.stargazer-products.com/store.... those are amazing! And will most definitely make you stand out. With those just do your normal make=up, you don't want to go too crazy. If you really want your make-up to stand out, use a box set like http://www.claires.com/product.asp?name=... or http://www.claires.com/product.asp?name=... and pick a bright red, yellow, blue, green or orange and cover the whole lid of your eye. For your nails us a sparkly polish http://www.claires.com/product.asp?name=... or a 3 in 1 by Claires like: http://www.claires.com/product.asp?name=... for a crazy nail art! Put body glitter on your skin everywhere http://www.claires.com/product.asp?name=... or http://www.claires.com/product.asp?name=... . You could also use metallic for eyeshadow and that will make you pop if you layer it up like http://www.claires.com/product.asp?name=... .   Go for a bright red finish on the lips like http://www.claires.com/product.asp?name=... .

9etT9I3faa	It shouldnt be a problem when your dying your hair black :) if you were dying it blonde, then i would be concerned! dying it black - you cant really go wrong! just make sure you're not allergic to the chemicals!|`|TdGbIDH8aa	I've dyed my own hair before and I've died it black   be sure to get all of the color out in the shower  bc/ your head will be itching terribly if you don't.  && Don't leave the color on too long.|`|mLw7RwEIaa	Nope :D i like the colour of my hair|`|BLUUQFG4aa	Use some Vasaline around your hairline, neck and ears so if the dye runs it won't stick to your skin and won't be a hassle to remove! Also, make sure you've got something protecting the floor, the bathroom cabinets and counter tops. That black hair dye is a mess to try and clean up! Make sure to massage the dye in really well. If you think you're done...go over it again to make sure. Especially since your natural color is lighter it would be really noticeable if you missed a spot! Also, when you're rinsing out the black dye make sure it's all out because if you start brushing your hair and it's not all out you'll end up with hair color splatters everywhere! (a good friend of mine did this! lol) It seems like it takes forever for the black dye to rinse out!|`|XadHhxOSaa	haha never died my own hair, always get people to dye mine and i always dye other peoples, best to get someone else to do it otherwise it may turn out patchy|`|Dj1Sp8Enaa	You may & I would suggest a natural hair dye, I believe one is made by Renna. fjw75|`|2IuoHrjQaa	if you are dying it black, you need to ensure your whole bathroom is protected, Once black stains, its very difficult to get out. Use an old towel and make sure you use vaseline round your hairline. Ensure you use the gloves. But most importantly, because each hair dye has different chemicals, Black is particularily strong, so ensure you do a test first...|`|ZlYmbAVQaa	dying it all one colour is fine, just get a few packs incase you need more. It's just streaks that are hard. And have a bcakup plan if you don't like how it turned out, like get a different colour which you also like|`|2diqbFFCaa	It's not very hard.   The biggest thing that you need to worry about is staining your forehead.  It's not fun.    Get a dark, wet, cloth to wipe off your skin if it drips.

pC0GVZCcaa	If youre still after a 32a strapless bra...Go to Primark, thats their most common size, theyre about 6-8 too.    And I really dont think you can. Postage from America costs so much money.

I ordered something from an American website and payed 20 postage, when it arrived at the door I had to pay an extra 8... not nice.

HhmhSBpgaa	uaually it helps acne a bit because it helps to dry them up. If you have bad acne then It could cause some slight scarring. When I tan my skin always gets clearer and I just go for a pretty glow not a fake bake brown.|`|2huIa9o3aa	Tanning has left quite a negative impression on me. I was on a medication that prohibited extensive exposure to direct sunlight and over a period of time it increased acne. i have damaged my skin and have tried many topical solutions to minimize discoloration and eliminate scarring from acne...... no such luck. Please use SPF anything for your face. Remember you may look tan now, but your skin will age much faster. I came out with brown blotchy skin and have spent more money on fixing the problem I created than i did for my entire membership over the years. I tanned for about 4 years, I no longer get compliments on my skin. Genetics does play a part in this too! I'm 32 now and my skin is that of a 50 year old. Please use caution and be honest with your medications when tanning. I went to reputable tanning salons that would not have allowed me to tan if they knew what meds. I was taking. Good Luck!|`|D8nyS1Rfaa	Indoor tanning is a controlled environment, and will provide you with the vital Vitamin D that your body cannot absorb through supplements and food.  Moderation is key.  If you are doing this for acne, use the lowest powered bed and stay at a low time.  It will help clear up your skin.  Every dermatologist I've gone to has a UV tanning booth.  Go figure -- could it be because it helps?    If you are taking a medication that says stay out of the sun (whether it's a topical cream or pills), then don't go to the tanning bed.  That just doesn't make sense.  You could overexpose yourself that way.|`|FS9ibKB5aa	dont go tanning. in my opinion is gross.  tanning is terrible for your skin no matter what.|`|XeaC5UZhaa	At first it will look a bit darker but it actually clears up acne! And it works good
LaJn6jxJaa	I don't think it will do that much to your hair.  I put henna in my hair when it was colored and nothing bad happened.  Just to warn you, I recently found out that although henna is natural it is just as bad for your hair as coloring it.  It basically strips it.  I won't henna my hair anymore because it felt so unhealthy, but go for it if you want to.|`|iHub3X6Gaa	I do agree with Laura, however, you can henna your hair as often you like. The more you sue it the more natural it will look. Use it regularly and you will never have split ends. You can lighten and darken the henna buy leaving on less time or going longer in between henna|`|LaQ8Ejt3aa	I would use pure natural cassia or amla, then it won't affect your hair color. THese are often sold as neutral henna.  http://www.hennacaravan.com/shop/hair.ht...
dWGqulxXaa	umm it would. but i think if u had a double nostril piercing that would look cuter. or bridge. lol they would all look cute    umm add me on myspace lol    www.myspace.com/20067407|`|S0UbiW1taa	septum or bridge|`|QsQj8jO7aa	don't think that it would make you look any better. it might take away from how you already look.|`|jPIyZRTqaa	Sure thing.|`|xb6mEIECaa	yeah i really think it would !|`|YjkXyHBuaa	it would look cutee :]|`|yXGlmUqlaa	yes|`|RnxxYn8gaa	I could never understand the need for a nose ring. I just think things like that are a horrible hindrance. I mean what if there was an emergency where I had to climb a tree or squeeze through an opening. Or even climb and jump off of a fence real fast. I mean what if my life depended on this. Probably the nose ring wouldn't get in the way, but what if it did? What a branch or piece of fence metal somewhere where I got face just too close were to push hard or even snag onto the nose ring. Well I definitely wouldn't use the ring, but even the dumbells could get yanked to one side. Then the pain might cause me to slip, and I wouldn't be able to get away as fast while dealing with blood all over the place. Yeah it wouldn't be likely that it would happen, but if it did, it could only slow me down or make me less alert.    Well I wouldn't wear rings regardless because of this even if I was a girl. I wouldn't even wear ear rings because of the potential problems they could cause either. Oh well, maybe it's just because I'm a guy.    Oh yeah, I didn't even think about this, but what if I was to get into a fight? Eeee, ouch, I wouldn't even want  to think about it.

AA10045246	student discounts are not subjected to age but rather to if you are a student or not and hold a valid student 'discount' ID    1) basically you need to be a college OR university student, in any year of your studies, which mean you can be of any age. So you can be as young as 16 and as old as 70 providing you are attending the university.    2) Secondly, to get the actual discount you need to apply for something called an NUS card, national Union Students.. THIS is what you show the cashier to get the 10% discount  when you attend uni, some of the institutes give you an NUS card for free and some don't, in this case you will need to contact the NUS company and pay to have one. i think it has a fee of 40pr year if you want to buy a card|`|6OdiPkc2aa	look missy  people are answering your question - read the answers - you can have student discount at any age - as long as you have a valid student card! simple as that!|`|WGzJUSefaa	Check out this site, it has tons of cute outfits for every occasion.    http://www.freewebs.com/fashionstyling4u...|`|PEC6bunyaa	According the guidelines on the link you attached a current student ID.

For an NUS card, normally you have to be in higher education (ie in uni or at college studying for a degree or HND), however i'm not sure if 6th form or further education colleges do them nowadays.|`|vOXuF2hXaa	STUDENT AS IN UNIVERSITY STUDENT WITH A STUDENT CARD THAT GETS YOU THE DISCOUNT|`|4ZzLtY9Saa	old enough to be a student so I'd say 16 unless you ar in scotland and at college then its 15|`|AA11349925	old enough to have a student I.D or NUS card.

It makes your skin dry, and this can lead to even more acne and irritation.  -About all of these pills...forget them! they can seriously damage your pancreas and liver, and trust me,you don't want that.  -Try this natural home remedy, it is amazing!  Take some parsley , put it in a bowl, and cover it with hot water.wait about  2 hours until the water turns green, and then put the water into an ice cube try , and out it in the freezer.Use the parsley ice cubes 2 times a day (morning and evening everyday) after you wash your face with a face cleanser. DO NT use it more then twice a day because if you do, it will dry your skin.This should help you , but if you see any Allergy reactions, or if you see you face going worse , stop immediately!  -about those girls: dint worry , everybody goes through acne at one stage in their lives , and if not now, they will probably have acne when they are 30 , which is far more embarrassing.  -About your back...in the summer , expose your back to sunlight, and the pimples will go away.But for now , just make sure that you shower daily,and don't scrub your back to hard.  Hope my tips helped you =)|`|O6Il5q91aa	hi you should get acne control set or beauoxi white plus from magic potions http://www.magic-potions.com or http://www.skinwhiteningexperts.com the products will surely help you. thats our family problem facial pimples and in the back, shoulder and chest but the products i  mentioned above help us solve our problem for years .|`|HhmhSBpgaa	Dont over do it either. you can irritate your skin by scrubbing and putting to many things on it.

z6bd3Hwuaa	oh yeah  many times.|`|ACA8i43Gaa	It happened to my best friend you might have read it on here before. I will never forget it.    My best friend and I were at church and she had asked me to walk with her to go and talk with the music director to see about joining the church choir. As we waiting for him to finish talking with another woman. My best friend. Looks at me and says OH NO! and turns bright red.    I noticed that she was looking around the church to make sure no one was looking but it was hard for us not to be noticed due to we were standing in front of the church. My best friend turns on her heels and runs off towards to exit.    As I followed I am yelling Whats wrong? She is laughing so hard to the point she cant talk. We end up in the baby changing room were she shuts the door behind us and says. Amy my panties are falling down. We both bust out lol. Then she smiles as she says Good thing I wore pants today.    As we walked back into the church she looked at me and said Note to self when you loose weight you dont just change your dress size you also have to change your underwear size as well We both fell out LOL|`|BLUUQFG4aa	Wow...that's horrible!   Yeah I've had quite a few embarrassing stories! Especially in high school. My problem was that I've got such a bubble but most jeans are or tend to be low rise and of course when I sit or bend over they come down. Anyways, people were always seeing my thong string and making comments about the cute bow or whatever was in the middle. So one day I wore granny panties after athletics on purpose so that when I go to my locker before heading home whomever was looking would see them. Anyways, I wrote on the top "stop staring at my a$s perv!" Unfortunately everyone talked about it for about 2 months straight and to this day someone always brings up at a party or gathering and that was almost 3 years ago! lol =P|`|dIw1112Zaa	Yeah when i was little i was bending over a little river and then my pants ripped and this boy who was older then me saw them. So i fell to the ground and quickly walked back to my house.|`|xeQlWxoZaa	LOL, I can laugh about this now, but it was really embarrassing to me at the time.    I was trying a few things on at a secondhand store, one where the fitting room is just a little booth in a corner, when one of the employees of the store unknowingly opened the door on me while I was stripped down to my bra and panties! It was only open for a split second, but I know some of the people in the store saw the whole thing!
Gl5nWoeSaa	if there stretch marks from fat then its unattractive but if you have a few from muscle then i dont think they would notice|`|jeX5VZAtaa	that is part of life. all of my boyfriends have been of normal size/skinny and they usually have a set of stretchmarks on their hip and back around to their butt. they arent unattractive they eventually fade. just try some cocoa butter or tan a little. but no if a girl is too shallow to date you because you have stretch marks then she isn't worth your time.|`|P0EAzyw8aa	My son has them on his legs as he grew suddenly, chances are if you don't point them out she wont mention them lol.|`|BzUMSGgwaa	Ewwww!!! Yes i bloody well do find them disgusting errrr  Women are a different kettle of fish|`|SRDPnnIMaa	i bet they do|`|FkdEyXudaa	Wow I didn't know guys got stretch marks......|`|19sa1ITfaa	ewww lmfao|`|BLUUQFG4aa	I wouldn't find it disgusting or unattractive. It's apart of life. Everyone has them and if they say they don't they're lying! Most people get them in their teenage years due to growing. Those are usually on your hips as a female. Anyways, no it's not disgusting. It's pretty natural and hard to avoid!|`|FP4Ati8uaa	well it depends how much he has them|`|nRtf72u8aa	Nah i wouldnt mind at all because I have some lite ones myself. As long as he doesnt have em badly like saggy skin type deal do to weight loss ...then fine. I had a guy friend whos super skinny & never was fat not even as a kid & he has stretch marks on his love handles...never got that at all.|`|gSwobfujaa	you know what. im going to be honest. i personally do not like when men have stretchmarks. is it a deal breaker...no probably not. but it is unattractive. at least depending on how much or how severe they are. i had a buddy of mine who is totally hot. im talkin he should be a friggin model thats how hot he is. he went on this work out spree and didnt do it correctly. he just bulked up as soon as possible. unfortunately, he stretched his skin too much in too short a time. and hes got ugly stretch marks on his arms and chest. with clothes on, his body is smokin...but when he wear beaters or sleevless (usually working out) its not so hot anymore. it literally takes away from it. but nonetheless i think strecth marks on women are more "understandable" since we develop hips and a booty and breasts usually in a shorter span of time. i literally got my hips and butt within one year. i mean, i turned into a woman in a year lol. and ive got some stretch marks. but my boyfriend loves it. strange enough.|`|AJj4ORHuaa	no i dont care about them cuz i have a couple of stretch marks myself and if i want a guy that wouldnt care about them i should do the same for the guy :)  they're no big deal.|`|nKVVqxq2aa	Nope. I really dont care if a men has them or not|`|FS9ibKB5aa	i agree with tackle box 100%|`|6MHuI3NXaa	i honestly, wouldnt care cause i have them  myself... lmao|`|RxLotP6iaa	haha woah|`|gM4exZNEaa	If someone likes you enough they wont care :)|`|z0B0fyT6aa	It depends where they are. If it's some fat mans belly stretch marks....uh uh... not attractive. But I dated a basketball at my college who had a few stretch marks on his lower back and arms... not a ton, and they didn't look obnoxious... .but it was obviously because it was from muscle growth. I usually tend to think that stretch marks are bad because your body is beyond the "capacity" that your skin is supposed to hold or something...but have come to learn that it's not that big of a deal and it can just come from things like weight gain or muscle growth in a short amount of time.|`|TqLPR72Daa	I wouldn't :3

b6e3ec0b5c8a0f30a22e16bc4bbf50fbaa	It may be approaching "Psoriasis".    It is not possible to stop sucha problem with simple home-remedies or with ordinary routine shampoos like Head & Shoulders, Clinic all clear, etc. These brands are all marketing exercises only and do no good to the user. Infact, there is hardly any science behind these products. You may get temporary relief for some-time but a permanent result (cure) is simply not possible. Home-based traditional remedies work only for maintenance purpose i.e for keeping good hair good. Dandruff and hairloss need a serious treatment and you should prefer natural remedies. Treatments with chemicals and drugs will have side-effects and reversal effects - problems recur once you discontinue. Specifically for dandruff and hairloss, you should look for the following natural ingredients/organic stuff and hair-vitamins that will give you lasting relief i.e a complete cure else severe hairloss will set in-    Kelp,  Nettle,  Provitamin B5,  Rosemary extract,  Roobois extract,  Gingko Biloba,  Chamomile extract,  Horsetail extract,  Comfrey extract,  Wheat protein,  Aloe Vera,  Cystine,  Soya extract,  Inositol,  Biotin,  Niacin,  Grapefruit seed extract,  etc etc.    One or two of these ingredients won't help. Only in a combination they will give your hair and scalp holistic health. All these and much more is found in Segals Solutions Program, now available in India. They guarantee results.    Segals Solutions is a breakthrough researched formula and is the newest recommendation for solving dandruff and potential hairloss issues, all without side-effects, by doctors also.    Results are incredibly fast. For me it came in just 5-6 weeks and hasn't occurred thereafter. They gave me some advanced hair supplement and a special formula and also a special shampoo that they told works from within the hair-root. Results are incredible! I must say, it was a comprehensive solution that I found after almost 2-3 years of severe dandruff, dry scalp and hairloss and when all trials with what not, didn't just seem to work. Their secret of success is in their ingredients. Just study it yourself - the uniqueness of it. I am sure you would have no option but to be convinced with the strengths of Segals Solutions. I don't think we have any other comparable thing in the market or even any other option.....Even if you have Psoriasis, they have an answer !    P.S: Ketoconazole based shampoos like Nizoral and Selsun won't give you lasting and desired results...... They are not even near the efficacy of Segals Solutions products|`|UppsoSZPaa	I have dandruff also. I've tried several things & here are some that have worked for me:    Rub Aloe Vera cactus gel on it (order online)  Take Flax seed oil or fish oil pills (you'll see a difference in a few weeks)  Use T-GEL shampoo when washing hair, 5 times a week (order online- will see effects in 2 days)  rub Mayonnaise or veggie oil on your scalp & let it sit for about 30 minutes, then wash out  Start taking a good multivitamin for men    Stay away from cheap shampoos & conditioners|`|YwHl37Hgaa	A teaspoon of fresh lime juice mixed in a mug of water for the last rinse, while washing the hair, is an useful remedy.

It wont make your hair greasy if you use the right amount. (water based anways) All you have to do after you straighten is put a little in the palm of your hand and rub. Then put it throught your hair. Then repeat on the other parts of your hair. I say put a little at a time because you dont want so much stuff in you hair.    This product it great. It keeps your hair in place while making your hair look shiny and healthy.

dzJR8Dwvaa	i do all of this and my hair grows very well.        1. Have an experienced hair care professional or stylist trim your split ends.(Please note, a "trim" or "dusting" removes between 1/8 to 1/4 inch of hair.) If you have badly split ends, an inch or two may need to be removed, but it is healthier for your hair in the long run. Remember, trim only for split ends-- otherwise have 1/8 inch trimmed every 8 to 12 weeks: hair grows just one half inch per month and if it is cut more frequently, you will not see any length, since it is being cut as often or more than it is growing.   2. Wash hair as needed depending on your hair type and health. This could be every three days with products that do not contain alcohol or harsh sulfates and are pH balanced. Do not over-wash (once is usually enough), as over washing can cause a dry condition, which will ultimately lead to breakage. While washing, massage your scalp. This will reawaken sleeping follicles and promote thicker healthier hair.   3. Use a regular moisturizing conditioner after every wash, but deep condition at least every week. One week use a moisturizing deep conditioner. The next use a protein or reconstructing conditioner. Doing so will make your hair healthy and strong.   4. Use a daily moisturizer or leave-in conditioner as black hair is prone to dryness. Apply the moisturizer (without petroleum jelly, petrolatum or mineral oil) to the hair from roots to ends and gently massage in. Do this daily or as your hair requires--you want your hair to feel soft and pliable.You may have to experiment with what works for you but Ultra Black Hair Creme Moisturizer, Doctor Miracles, ORS Carrot Oil Cream or Dudley's PCA Moisture Retainer are good moisturizers to try.   5. A light oil (olive, soybean)applied sparingly may be used on your hair after applying a water-based moisturizer in order to seal moisture into the hair shaft and give your hair a nice natural shine. These oils can also be used to relieve a dry scalp.   6. Avoid using blow-dryers as much as possible when drying hair as the excessive heat causes dryness, damage and breakage. Air drying hair is the best method. If the volume of your hair is increased with air drying you can do one of two things: first: apply moisturizer,then air-dry-- this will decrease the volume without causing damage; or second - apply moisturizer and use a dome or bonnet dryer on a cool or warm setting. Never use the highest setting!   7. To get your hair to grow long, you also need to comb it carefully. Be sure to use a wide-tooth comb with no seams and comb it gently from the ends first, as combing from the ends will detangle hair as you comb higher and higher. Never comb from the roots to the ends until your hair is completely untangled.   8. Avoid daily and/or excessive brushing of your hair, as black hair is fragile. Excessive brushing can strip the hair of its protective layers. If you trying to smooth your hairline, brush gently, use a soft boar bristle brush, and make sure your hair is completely dry and moisturized.   9. Make sure you also wrap your hair with a silk/satin head wrap or bonnet before you go to bed at night. Without this protection, your loose hair will move about as you sleep putting stress on your hair, drying it out, and causing split ends.   10. Treat your hair from within by taking a multivitamin. Use a hair vitamin that will increase your hair growth rate and lenghthen your natural anagen (growth phase). Also drink at least eight cups of water and eat healthy foods such as fish, fruits, vegetables and nuts, and by exercising regularly to provide good circulation to the scalp.|`|G7TccW3iaa	Everyones' hair is different you just havce to find what works for you and stick with it.

If you eat correctly and drink enough water, 80 percent of your hair problems are solved. Eat a healthy and a balanced diet rich in protein and minerals. Oil your hair regularly, include a lot of milk, almonds and greens in your diet and drink at least 12 to 14 glasses of water daily.

Most people's hair grow's a little every day.|`|yVP957iKaa	having it cut every 6 weeks will help !     X|`|qGmLoEzYaa	It really all depends on your hair texture and condition. My hair is very curly, a loose corkscrew pattern and coarse.  I have bleached and dyed my hair quite a bit so I have breakage which means that pieces of my hair break off the ends.  It's been pretty intense, so I dyed my hair back to it's original color so I won't have to worry about maintenance and further damage.    Secondly, because of my hair texture I have to make moisture a priority. What I wash with is pantene, and I have to do that maybe once a week or twice if I need to. Shampoo pretty much dries your hair out but conditioning is great.  I also use hot six oil, by african royale. It is a black hair care product and if you have curly to nappy textured hair, you should always consider using a natural, non animal derived oil.  It contains olive oil, canola, wheat germ oil and a large variety of herbs.  This will protect your ends and nourish your new growth.  As far as making the hair actually grow faster, you need to take care of your health, and then you will have benefits such as good skin, longer hair, and optimistic attitude. Load up on water and eat a well balanced diet. Also, working out helps the hair and skin too because it increases the metabolism, and metabolism will help your follicles to produce hair quicker. Amino acids are excellent for hair growth and you can find amino acid soy sauce that you can spray on food to increase your hair growth potential.    Genetics, heredity, environmental factors and health all determine quality of hair.|`|z3kROMxPaa	I asked the name question to my hair dresser. She told me that hair products help of course like olive oil products and such. But you also need to change how you treat your body.   She definitely recommended over the counter prenatal vitamins. Her reasoning was that when  women reach puberty our bodies start withholding certain nutrients to prepare for child birth, which is why our hair begins getting easily damaged. Prenatal vitamins replenish the vitamin/nutrient loss. I now know from personal experience that prenatal vitamins have helped my hair grow, as well as my nails, a lot in just a few months of using it.  Also she said we aren't drinking enough water, which makes hair brittle. She said drink lots of water-- hydrating your body is even more effective than using hydrating shampoos. =)
a9xITT0Aaa	Damn People. You CAN Have Wrinkles At Age 16. STop Saying She Doesn't. Because In The End Everyone Has Differentt Skin, So You Never Know.     Im 15 And I Had Wrinkles Under My Eyes Too. For Quite A While Too.    I Suggest That If YOu Put On Concealer Or Foundation, Try Not Rubbing It On Under Your Eyes.. It's Better To Pat It Because It Doesn't Stretch The Skin Under There Which Is VerySensitivee.    You Can Also Try Hemorrhoidd Cream, It Might Sounds Weird It Works Really Well.

Its something you've noticed and latched onto, its not something anyone else see's and its got nothing to do with age, even the youngest people have little wrinkles around their eyes etc, its just the natural contours on your skin. You should stop worrying and enjoy being young instead of worrying about having wrinkles. That's one thing I can't stress enough by the way, worrying will give you real wrinkles or ''worry lines'' so cheer up and enjoy being youthful!|`|xoXkHOVsaa	Do you have allergies?  That's the only thing I can think of that would give a 16 year old wrinkles.  Get a good allergy medicine and it will help a lot.    Try Olay anti-wrinkle cream.  You can get it at most stores and it is less expensive than most other creams.  Keep your skin moisturized and wear sunscreen.  That will help keep the wrinkles away!|`|KT0UTX8taa	You cant have wrinkles at 16, they are expression lines! and how bad can they be at 16!!!  Dont use too much make up and make sure its good quality, or yu ll regret it in future.
D8nyS1Rfaa	There's some misinformation here.    First, I've never used the tanning equipment that's inside the gym.  Usually the staff is not trained on tanning, or certified.  This is an add-on for the gym and is not their focus.  An professional indoor studio is the way to go.  HOWEVER, since it's there for you as a part of your membership, you might try it.  But don't rely on them to give you the right info.    Agreed, start off very slow (probably lower than they recommend).  There is also a tanning schedule located on the tanning unit.  Check this out for the FDA recommended time.  Eyewear should be provided, or you may have to buy a pair for $3.00.  Keep them in a zip-lock bag to keep them clean.  Use them every time you tan and if you need to move the strap during the session to prevent a line on the side of your head then go ahead.  It's unlikely you will get the raccoon eyes, but also move the goggles themselves slightly during the session.    Another BIG, BIG concern for me is the cleanliness/sanitation.  Since tanning isn't their primary concern, you have to wonder how the maintain the equipment.  When you tan in the bed, the acrylic should be smooth.  If it's rough, sticky, or oily, then don't tan.  Even with a standup booth, they have to make sure what you're standing is clean too.    As far as indoor tanning lotion.  A daily moisturizer you get from the beauty supply is NOT the same as indoor tanning lotion.  Tanning lotion has accelerator that will increase your body's production of melanin and give you a faster tan.  There are 3 words to remember: accelerator, bronzer, and tingle.  Tingles make your red -- don't use this.  Bronzer gives you the "colorant" as someone mentioned.  If you are not in to that, then just go with an accelerator with no tingle or no bronzer.    Do not buy tanning lotion from walmart, walgreens, or the drugstore.  This is full of mineral oil and chemical fillers.  Do NOT buy online either.  How old is it?  Has it been stored in someone's trunk in the heat?  Has it been opened?  Has been 1/2 used and filled with something else?  Is it contaminated?  Only buy from an indoor tanning studio!|`|HhmhSBpgaa	I would not use any accelerator just moisturizer after. Start off really slow your boobs and butt have never been tanned before and you will get burned badly. Since your membership comes with tanning you have nothing to lose by being safe and taking it slow. After your skin has adjusted then move up to a level one accelerator.|`|XbA4wBUpaa	Start by tanning for only about 4 minutes (in a stand-up booth-- I don't know much about the beds). It sounds ridiculously short, but you really need to feel for yourself the effects on your skin.   My experience with tanning lotion is that it's a huge rip-off. They tell you it doesn't have any colorant in it, but it does. I recommend just using your favorite unscented lotion to keep your skin from chapping and going ashy.     And always wear your tanning glasses!|`|Wo0MEbfqaa	Start off going for 3-5 minutes, 2-3 times a week. Gradually increase the amount of time you tan for as the weeks go on. Do 4 minutes a session, 6 minutes a session, etc.     As for lotion, do not wear tanning lotion that you can buy at the drugstore. Indoor and Outdoor tanning lotions are completely different, because the Sun gives one type of ray and UV lights in tanning beds/booths are different as well. You can purchase Indoor tanning lotions online, or probably from your gym (most of them have sample packets for sale if they have tanning beds on-site). Some of my favorite brands are Designer Skin, Over Confident (OC) and Swedish Beauty.    Good luck! Don't over-do it, and make sure you wear eyewear! Eyewear will not leave any lines or anything like that if you use them correctly - a lot of salons/gyms sell Wink-Ease - they're like little stickers that block all of the harmful rays that you shape into small cones to go over your eyes. You can normally buy them for 50 cents, and they're one-time-use, so you can trash them afterward. I love my Wink-Ease; I think they're the greatest invention!!

WHY DON'T YOU TRY LETTING YOUR HAIR GROW OUT AND MAYBE THEN YOU CAN GET THICK BANGS IN THE FRONT THAT JUST COVER YOUR EYEBROWS. Maybe lightening your hair just a little bit might work too.    Go maybe for some light blues or light greens in eye-makeup and maybe some clear gloss or just chap-stick will look good.|`|oG96QlHWaa	your very pretty i think you would look good with longer hair  like down to right above your shoulders|`|VWp2kD9Baa	I think you look adorable.  I love the hairstyle.  Maybe some highlights, but keep the style.|`|Kjee66zMaa	i think your pretty|`|shAfupiEaa	you dont stand out at all. you have pale skin and a sallow face. your hair is frizzy and your nose is rather big.    stop fishing for compliments.

HwxM9lyOaa	Dents happen when your nail artist buffer too much nail off with the electric dremel tool...  There are a couple things you can do to make the dent less noticeable, but the only thing that really works is to let your nails grow out.  Both ideas come from Walgreens... And I've done both to myself.    Sally Hansen makes a 7 sided nail file/buffer.  It's a couple bucks.  Use the 4 buffing sides to buff your nail down more and make the dent almost disappear.  Don't buff too much though or your nail will be thin and your finger will be sore until the nail grows out!  (The nail "artist" actually did that to me on accident with the dremel... I cried)    Sally Hansen also makes an at-home acrylic.  It's liquid and powder and following the instructions you can coat your nail so it's dent free.  Although, this makes that nail look thick and matte.    Either way, it's only a temporary fix, and you need to be patient.  I have natural dents in my nails that never go away... no matter how much buffing.|`|P0EAzyw8aa	Fake nails can cause permanent damage, be careful when buffing nails that you do not bruise the nail bed, this will take a long time to recover from.
4vqzkIr4aa	First of all there are much better buys for 300.00 than a Martini. Any of the Dan Fowler machines are much better and have more tuning ability. Most of the Martini machines are knock-offs from old Rodgers and Sharpz machines. I honestly do not know of any known artists that would swear by a Martini machine. Most use old Rodgers, Sharpz, Fowler, Carlton, etc... or home made machines.    Get a Fowler. You can't go wrong.    Edit:  You can't go wrong with a classic Sharpz T-Dial. If you have not used the new Fussion Fowler machine it is pretty amazing. You can find some good old Sharpz and Rodgers on ebay or at tattoo conventions.|`|rtx0YQDJaa	as far as i'm concerned the best is mickey sharpz

aIS1asOjaa	'you do something to me' paul weller    beautiful song :)
NWwGl4k6aa	stop!!!  just go to a salon.  from your description, you need professional help from a salon.|`|P0EAzyw8aa	you need products that contain hydrolised silk protein and vitamin B  to help repair the damage. To go over a bad dye job choose one shade darker even if you have three different colours in your hair choose one that is a semi permanent it will be kinder to your hair and not contain any peroxide. Layering hair helps so does a haircut. Hair can break off and split all the way to the roots and the only way of repairing severe damage is to cut. Use  a treatment twice a week and leave it on your hair for 10 minutes before rinsing off, this will help the hair become more plyable and less dry. email me if you want more info.|`|4ZzLtY9Saa	you need to get a leave in conditioner and leave it in for as long as possible I recommend overnight.  Don't colour your hair for at least another week.  Your hair will probably need to be stripped as bleach is quite hard to shift, get an appointment with the hairdresser before you completely wreck your hair|`|cE9QIMNiaa	i would suggest getting a malibu treatment.  it will strip the chemicals out of it.  PROFESSIONALLY DONE!|`|AA10419781	I honestley would go to a short cut and go back to a darker color you have destroyed your hair,do colustrol treatments with a hair dryer once a week.dont play with chemicals like that you can burn your scalp and possible go bald.thats why theirs professsinals to do that|`|PEC6bunyaa	You need to go to a salon and first have them fix the color, then ask for a cholesterol treatment;  which is a extremely deep conditioning treatment which will help restore moisture back into your hair.  You will also need to get a hair cut because if the ends are that fried you're going to have split ends and damage your hair even more.|`|aKqYVSMDaa	You need a DEEP conditioner. What you should do is before you go bed put conditioner in your hair with a plastic shower cap over it and then wash it out in the morning. You hair will be soft and moisturized. If you cant do that then just leave it in for at least 2 or 3 hours. The longer you leave it in the better. Also to get your color fixed you need to go to a salon. You dont want to do anymore damage than you already have to it.|`|1oNuUuGkaa	rub warm olive oil in your hair leave for about 30 mins and wash out thoroughly, that should stop it from being too badly damaged and it re moisturises the hair, i did that myself it took me for ever to get back to my natural colour blonde but its worth the effort just make sure you condition it well because my hair is very prone to damage still  good luck and hope this was useful  next time get a toner from the hair dressers, thats wat sorted mine out|`|5SllyO5Eaa	The only thing you can do to even look like your hair is back to the way it was, is to grow that bleach out!! Your hair is completely fried now there is no turning back from that. Very few people can get bleached hair and still have it shiny and strong. You can use as much moisturizers as you want but your hair wont look like it did before you bleached it. Moisturizers are mainly going to help with the breakage not with the dryness. whatever you do DONT USE PRODUCTS WITH alcohol in them. IT can make your hair worse. Look at the ingrediants on the products and if it has alcohol, dont use it.
vOXuF2hXaa	wear a nice dress for a ceilidh (im Scottish so i should know ) is not supposed to be to formal so anything nice but not to smart would be fantastic and if you are looking for a guy and he is not scottish or in some cases irish the say no to the kilts (its not allowed)|`|SgFvuqJmaa	ceilidh's usually require smart clothes.  So a nice dress, but a pair of flat shoes to wear while dancing!|`|HzkDjDpyaa	A skirt if you are a woman.  A skirt if you are a man.
2BPMRCVMaa	lipgloss...  Or... plastic surgery. Im afraid there is no miricle thing out there that makes your lips look bigger unless you get lipgloss or plastic surgery.|`|sA763neGaa	lip plumper from VictoriaSecret!|`|HY5K4Yrraa	Try lip plumping glosses. There are many types and all different brands; i like benefit lip plumper or soap&glory.   :)|`|aROel4yzaa	You can try this plumping lip gloss from Victoria's Secret.  I used it, and it works really good (:        http://www2.victoriassecret.com/commerce...|`|QmWzBERjaa	Lip glosss.|`|QUDfYIJiaa	use a plump up lip gloss (mine is from "benefit") or there's this thing that you put on your mouth and pull it and some how it gives you bigger lips in like 1 min, i saw that i think in oprah or Dr.phil i'm not sure where i saw it...but that's all i know|`|IYnxKUH7aa	put a cake inbetween of them
dc49d60c4d19a92e193ce2f41c92cfedaa	It takes weeks for your tongue to fully heal and playing the flute would more than likely hurt|`|4ZzLtY9Saa	Your tongue will be extremely swollen for up to a week, when I got mine done the swelling was nearly away after 4 days.  The first couple of days are quite painful and it is impossible to eat anything.  I would wait till after tuesday to get it done it should all be ok within a week providing it has been able to heal properly|`|wANiHkJraa	no chance! i couldn't eat solids for three days after, i'd say if you had it done straight after one lesson you might be ok, but never played the flute so couldn't tell you!|`|twwgXvlraa	you might but most likey not. Every ones piercing heals differently. When I had my tongue pierce it took about 2 weeks to be completely back to normal. About 4-5 days for me to sound normal. Other people's tongue does not swell up as much. It all depends but I wouldn't risk it at all, chances that it would heal in 3 days are veeery slim.|`|aIS1asOjaa	if you are serious about your flute playing, i would strongly advise that you don't get your tongue pierced it could ruin your chances of being an awesome player...|`|d12161d1226915e575c51c69af7d440eaa	no way.  leave it until you don't have to play it for a while.

3533878a4dd2e1fbf5bf9526167668dbaa	- [Black] is usually associated with negativity. It also relates to any time that the Feminine Divine Energies are present. Some attributes of a black mood ring color that are negative would be if you were overworked, nervous about something, physically under par, etc. Be your own best judge. If it turns black during a time when you are feeling extraordinarily connected, benevolent and aware, then I'd say that's the Divine Feminine influence and certainly not negative.     - [Red] is the color of passion and of anger. It can also represent energized action, an adventuresome spirit or major excitement over something that is happening or about to happen in your life.     - [Yellow] is the color associated with mental processes, and with the ego self, or personality self as it is sometimes called. Yellow could occur when studying for a test, thinking hard about a problem or struggling with insecurity and/or puffed up pride.    - [Green] is the color of living plants and is often associated with growth. Green is the color of the heart chakra. A green shade to your mood ring might indicate a healing time, a feeling of love, etc. It is generally considered the "average" color for a mood ring.     - [Blue] is generally regarding as indicating a relaxed mood, someone who is at ease. As blue is also the color associated with the throat chakra, this shade may appear at a time when you are vocally struggling or vocally asserting yourself.    - [White] is typically associated with feelings of being frustrated, confused or bored but, in my experience, white is also a color that can indicate very high spiritual energies so if you are not frustrated, confused or bored, don't let the mood ring tell you that it is a negative expression: it could be crown chakra energies expanding or integrating at a spiritual level.    - Other colors generally described are pink (fear, or in cases where spiritual acceleration of the heart chakra are evident, pink can indicate the opening of the spiritual heart chakra center), purple (sensuality), orange (a state of wanting something), etc.     In general, each color has both a negative and positive interpretation. Be sure you tune in, internally, before deciding which one is correct for you. Of course, the more you tune in, internally, the less you will need an external read from a mood ring or any other spiritual tool. Then, the ring will have served it's purpose for you, as a training tool.|`|cieM9vIzaa	Here is the E-link to my Google blog with my own version of a "Mood Ring Colors Chart":    http://sheofmermaids.blogspot.com/    There are more E-links at the bottom of the blog to other Web-sites with their version of a "Mood Ring Color Chart".|`|uDRajB1oaa	WHITE  FRUSTRATED  CONFUSSED,  BORED     BRONZE  JITTERS,  ANTICIPATION,  RESTLESS  THOUGHTS     PINKISH  FEAR,  UNCERTAIN,  UNANSWERED  QUESTIONS     YELLOW  IMAGINATIVE,  WONDERING  THOUGHTS,  OK FEELING     ORANGE  STIMULATING  IDEAS,  DARING  WANTS     RED  EXCITED,  ENERGIZED,  ADVENTUROUS,  READY TO GO     PURPLE  SENSUAL,  CLARITY,  PURPOSE  IS KNOWN|`|AA11615514	Honestly all those colors mean is you have hot or cold hands.

Just wear jeans that FIT!|`|SlkI4Umnaa	skinny jeans|`|pN0Xiz7naa	Skinny Jeans|`|TTpf5tlMaa	As a guy, I prefer to see women wear something in between.     Baggy jeans hide your figure.    Skinny jeans make you look like a chicken with a wedgie.    I've never seen a woman who looked attractive in skinny jeans.|`|APgQM4QRaa	skinny is much better!!|`|QYXij5Wcaa	Personally a mixture and good balance!  Too skinny is not only uncomfortable, but is too metrosexual.  Too baggy seems more on the poser skater look, or plays too much on the hip hop scene, plus excess showing of underwear is unnecessary, and well a lot of grabbing and pulling is needed to pull those pants ups.  edit: for girls more or less the same opinion can be applied.|`|pfJorlTIaa	The skinny jean thing on men is horrific!  I was in Vegas last week and asked my husband, "look at those guys' jeans, icckk, where do you think they are from?"  He said, thats the new style for men, skinny jeans. That was the first i heard of them    WHY??  Why would a man purposly look like that?  So...baggy all the way!|`|vOXuF2hXaa	skinny all the way  http://www.availabledesign.co.uk/wordpre...  do you see where im coming from|`|sA763neGaa	Oh my gosh i HATE skinny jeans, and even though i hate baggy pants as well, i think skinny jeans are just so gay(i even hate them on girls)|`|4ZzLtY9Saa	neither bootcut or straight cut    Baggy = skater dude    Skinny = gay (nothing wrong with that of course)
tdbelYnNaa	No. Sally's is a beauty store, not a salon, they will probably have only clip-in extensions if that's what you wanted, but if you wanted real extensions go to a hair salon. Hope I helped.|`|6Tx8Opmraa	No...Sally's isn't a Salon, It's a Beauty Supply. You walk in, Go to the extensions, Pick out what you want, and pay for them.|`|KrqGoxoUaa	ya at 3 50 then goin to get a facial|`|PEC6bunyaa	Sally's is not a salon, its a beauty supply store.  It has products that professional stylists use.  You would have to go to a salon to have them put on, or you can buy them from Sally's and have someone help you put them on.
QuQioUd7aa	cause they have money and thats what the choose to spend it on .|`|4ZzLtY9Saa	because society has led us to believe being as attractive as you can will lead us to acceptance and popularity- the better you look the better you will succeed in life    lot of crap obviously tho|`|5p3m2fdFaa	Because It Puts Their Insecurities At Ease  xx|`|AA12285666	I agree with Emily.     I know.. before I was old enough to buy my own clothes I didnt have much.. so i didnt dress like everyone else and i felt so ugly and just OUT OF PLACE. Once i got a job. makin that money...I was shopping every weekend. It eventually became an addiction which Im still in the process of overcoming.     Basically, Not having nice things made me feel really insecure. Having nice clothes always made me feel like I fit in.    RIch people buy lots of clothes and makeup because they're just rich and have the money to. lol.|`|pmXGhePDaa	Cause people gorw up being bombarded with images og what "we are suppsed to look like".Like we have to wear designer clothes and wear a ton of makeup(for girls:P) so people dont feel that they will fit in if they dont do these things.

And being naked would be a higher risk to spread like STDs.  Cause like a guys dick would just be like sitting on a chair all out in the open and if he has an STD it could spread to the next person that sits there.

Second, don't ever think that opinions of people you don't even know matter.  Third, you need to find some self-esteem if you need to be rated so badly.  Fourth, you are really young.

LEypSiRpaa	If they are pop-able, pop them and put some tooth paste on them. But not any fancy tooth paste. Just a simple colgate type tooth paste. If you have enough time, sleep with the tooth paste on it. Most of the time it works. But sometimes it doesn't.  Good luck though!|`|tao83sDxaa	witch hazel on a cotton square in them.|`|2Cw0DfaSaa	if your put toothpaste on them and let the toothpaste dry you should put able to peel your pimples (and the toothpaste right off) im not sure if this works for blackheads but it does for white heads and for the blackhead just put your face over steam and pop that bad boy!!      if they are really red and you just want to cover them up put green eyeshadow on them and cover the green up with your skin tone concealer or bronser of whatever you use|`|e820051fee78ce7849c9936aa4289823aa	Alcohol can cause it to be more red and inflamed. Toothpaste works (dab some on the zit, leave it for a few hours or overnight), as well as a baking soda paste.|`|sdlvEMCjaa	Proactive works very well! You can probably get it off of the internet.|`|ztug2gLjaa	use toothpaste but make sure it's white toothpaste at night and let it crust up, it will dry it out.  I had a huge one on my chin a couple months ago and the only toothpast I had at my house was Aquafresh and it had blue and red in it...OMG I went to work the next day and my skin was tinted blue!  It was so embarrassing and I was so mortified.  But seriously toothpast does work!  Good LUck and I hope you have a great time...|`|QUDfYIJiaa	lemon, it dries it out.|`|F2QtzNyXaa	don't use alcohol right away, try not to put any makeup on them, and don't try poppin those suckers until they are ready because really you will just irritate them more and make them even more red and spread more if you do that. Patience girl, you will look fabulous, and i know i said not to but on the day of the class reunion maybe apply some makeup that has blemish protectors in it.. such as physician formula.. i know they have some brand. But really try to dry it out, but try not to use alcohol it tends to be too strong and i would suggest tooth paste (seriously) dries out them zits real good!  good luck!|`|gHbBuYkcaa	Stop using alcohol, it drys out skin and makes it worse. Put toothpaste on the zits before bed. The day of, if they are still visible, get a primer, one that takes away redness, then put on base, and then a small amount of concealer. The concealer on top of your base also works well for dark circles under your eyes.

VlzlPAEwaa	i used a product called 'Color Fix One'  i bought it at sally's for about $10.00 my hair too was black..it came out a nice caramel, then I went to the  store and started buying  ash blonde,,so it doesn't turn orange,,you will still need a toner to bring any orange that may come through..but prepare and pamper your hair, it could get damage if that wont get as blonde as you like , head to a salon...|`|P0EAzyw8aa	from black to blond depending on the blond shade you want is 8 to 9 shades. To stop the brassiness of the colour choose one that has an ash tone, do it gradually and leave 1 week in between dying, you can do it yourself, hairdressers use a very high concerntration of bleach which can be very dangerous and burn the scalp. Use a permanent dye, one that has a lightening powder will boost the shades 2 more. never leave on for more than 20 minutes. Dry part of your hair to see the colour if you don;t think it is light enough wait another week and then do it a few shades lighter, use a treatement on your hair once a week to give it strength and shine.|`|dATJNcZcaa	You sound like you have no idea what you're doing.  "last time i bleached it like 4 times in one night and then had to chop off half of my hair because it was so damaged"  OF COURSE it's going to be damaged! Most people if they just bleach it once they have to chop some off. FOUR times in one night I'm surprised your hair didn't fall out.  Yes, you should strip it first if you have black hair, but PLEASE go to a salon if you want to not completely ruin your hair.|`|n3akm5u6aa	black is a direct die so it is not going to strip easily and it going to come out in a orange copper colour the only option u have is the just put highlights thats the most u can do or redye it black or wait till it grows out. it impossible to strip black dye from your hair.

Don't forget to check out other stores at "The Mall" as they might be selling some "Mood Rings" too.    "Wal-Mart" & "Walgreens" often have "Mood Rings" for sale.    "Bible & Hallmark" stores sometimes sell various types of "Mood Jewelry" to include "Mood Rings".  "Bible" (Religious) stores are usually found in smaller shopping-centers, while "Hallmark" stores are found both at "The Mall" & in smaller shopping-centers.    "Gift, Mysticism & Novelty-Item" stores often sell "Mood Rings".  These stores are usually found in smaller shopping-centers & downtown areas.

mj03hu2Saa	Your lips might be dry because you're over-using lip balm.  After a while, your lips stop producing moisture on their own.  Try lightening up for awhile.

Based on that I would go with either  1 or  2.  The last link is obviously a wig and the color looks too unnatural to look good on anyone except a science fiction character (in my opinion).  Here is another suggestion:    My daughter's hair color is very similar to yours and sometimes she would like a change but after trying a bunch of drastic ideas (pink stripes, black) that dried out her hair, we finally came up with a good compromise.  I pull some of her hair through a cap and put a darker brown on that hair.  The result is rich and beautiful and as it grows out there is really no root problem.  Warning: if you do this, use semi permanent color - we used permanent color once and it turned out black (very goth and unattractive with her pale skin). Good luck!|`|Twq7efhQaa	I love the hair in the 2nd pic.

VlzlPAEwaa	tie your bandanna on Your head, so you get a good feel for how you want it.   1. put it back on your head, letting all hair pull back with the bandanna  2. take a comb and start by making a part just against the front edge of the Bandanna, then comb that hair out from under it.   3. do the same all around it until you get as much hair as you want out.    It will take practice until you get it..but that's the best way|`|yXGlmUqlaa	i wish i could tell you how but i really don't know lol.    just wanted to say don't let people who bag on you get to you.  who cares|`|Kxcaxo3Kaa	You can buy hair bands that are like that but if you want to do it a difficult way you fold from the corner to the thickness of the band you want and then just keep folding till all the material is in a long strip you will have to pin the end of the bandanna so that flap doesn't unwrap it all then put the bandanna under your hair and pull till the top and do a bow the best way is do it upside if that makes sense? If your no good then get a friend to help and stand behind you and do the bow you will get a much better one then if they are facing you!    Hope it helps!|`|6MCrTTRTaa	make it like a couple inches in with and put it on ur forhead and tie it behind in the back of ur hair  keep it on the outside of ur hair  or beneath it whichever is comfortible for u    i luv ur hair!
uekCcy74aa	Not if you are going darker. But beware, many bottle-byes will have some kind of lightening chemical like peroxide, bleach or ammonia, because they cater to anyone weather they're going lighter or darker.    Look for a dye that says "semi-permanent". Unlike bottle dyes, they should just come in a container with a mixture in it, there should be no mixing powder A with water and then combining with liquid B.    You probably will find once you do the initial dying you'll have to re-apply for 5 or 10 min over the length every once and a while. But you won't need nearly as much as you will for the initial application, and you should only apply it for a few minutes.     Bleaching hair opens up the cuticle (which normally lays in flat layers, like shingles on a roof) to allow the dye to get in. After, the cuticle will close a bit, but it'll still be damaged and shredded which is why bleached hair is so frizzy/dry. W/o the bleach the dye won't be able to get as far in, and it'll bleed a lot easier. But IMHO it's totally worth it. Just re-doing your whole head every months is actually less of a hassle than doing roots, because you don't have to worry so much about sectioning the hair and everything. And your hair will be so, so much nicer than it will be if you use a bleaching dye.|`|9260e11fd683ab12093abd3cfbae5065aa	You don't need to bleach it if you're going darker.  Bleach is for going  lighter, or when you want to put wild colors in your hair.|`|pEQw6vokaa	you prob want to dye it then the color will show up better
yXGlmUqlaa	try cutting shorter layers on top, and when you get out of the shower blow dry your hair with a round brush upwards, or flip your head upside down.|`|n3akm5u6aa	try blow drying with round brush this give lift to  the hair. bend forward scruch the mousse to the roots of the hair only and blow dry.|`|LgchfHHZaa	I use biolage shampoo the volumizing one it works great!!!

dyQNG6V8aa	That dress looks nice!  A LBD is always a good thing, you can jazz it up!!    I'd suggest going for sultry siren look, dark smokey eyeshadow, pale nude lips, lots of mascara.  Think like this - http://frappelattes.com/wp-content/uploa...    Keep the lips nude though, think 60's sex kitten!!  Depending on your current hairstyle, I'd go for a tousled messy look, very sexy.    http://i5.photobucket.com/albums/y193/hu...    Go for darkest red or a deep burgendy on your nails and you'll be the hottest one there!!!!!!!!!    I'd keep the jewellery minimal, keep the focus on your hair and make up.  Try a long necklace like the girls wearing in the pic of your dress, you can pick them up cheap from Primark, Claire's Accessories, etc.  I'd wear some long earrings, not too over the top bit subtly sparkly so you'll see them as your hair moves.  A big statement ring as well, something like this   http://image0.etsy.com/il_430xN.18419868...  but in a different colour will set the look off nicely!!  I'd go for a dark stone.  But you again can pick these things up for a few pounds each so you might not need to even spend 20!!!    Good luck and have fun!|`|TuBzc1R5aa	here's some jewelry choices:    (these are all just random picks, so choose the one(s) you like)    http://www.forever21.com/product.asp?cat...  ^in dark grey/black    http://www.forever21.com/product.asp?cat...  ^in any color; the pink and the purple ones are super cute!    http://www.forever21.com/product.asp?cat...    http://www.forever21.com/product.asp?cat...  ^if you buy the pink flower ring, you could wear that with this.    you should totally wear nail polish. match the color with the color of jewelry you're wearing.    have fun!|`|OCgZACJqaa	I don't think anyone can go wrong with the little black dress,  Black patent shoes and a glittery clutch bag will look very sophisticated.    At the moment large flowers to pin onto your dress are all in fashion, they are sold in all the high street stores, and the bigger the better., and you could pick the colour out to match your lipstick and nail varnish.    Or instead of that,  because you have a  bow on the front of your dress why not buy a large sparkly broach and pin it to the centre of the bow. Wear silver or white gold jewellery to finish things off, earrings, necklace, bracelet and watch with some sparkly rings, you will look fabulous.  Do wear a pair of very sheer black tights, do not go bare-legged, there is nothing worse than  someone wearing black with bare legs, it looks trashy.|`|P7vOs799aa	Have you got a primark near you?  You could really do this dress up with some chunky gold jewellery,primark have loads and its so cheap!|`|yfMmr7uGaa	By some colourful bracelets   I'd say purple  And a purple necklace  Purple standing out eyeshadow  And do your hair quite dramaticly|`|kdPPQIBfaa	You could curl you hair.  Or if its curly straighten it.  Purple eyeshadow.  And black eyeliner will look good.  Also you could put gems or jewels on your dress.  You could streak or highlight your hair (If you have time.)  If your really in trouble go to Clairs.|`|xGmhDTWwaa	If you wanna brighten up a dull outfit,  use tights :o) Bright pink tights would look great and are very in!! :o)    http://www.topshop.com/webapp/wcs/stores...

Maybe you could wear your hair with a patent black alice band and back comb the top - kinda austin powers-esque lol :o)    Good Luck. Hope this is helpful n have a great time at the party!! xx|`|nBPGM2dlaa	why don't you try your bright nail varnish idea, like bright pink or maybe orange.  messy (but styled) hair is probably the way to go :)   if you make it wavy, and curl afew bits and then spray it with some hair spray it looks good! (shockwaves spray is great!)    do you remember those long beads that everyone used to wear?  well if you've got some bright ones of them, you should get them out and try them with the dress.    it all depends on dress really. what would some fishnets look like with it? maybe with not to big a gaps in the fishnets.    and make your eyes a statement too!   big hair, big eyes :)    hope this is helpful and you have a great time at the party =]    http://www.asos.com/Fearne-Cotton/Asos/A...  |`|QlnTwifraa	Priceless shoes have got bright coloured satin peep toe shoes for about a fiver on sale, most of them have matching bags as well. Ive seen red, blue, purple, pink, leopard print. Maybe go for clashing make up and jewelry with it as well in bright colours.|`|DCNFAzzxaa	Keep it simple which I think would look great with this dress... You could wear a long silver necklace (quite chunky), thick black bracelet and you could make your hair naturally curly and add a headband like this one: http://www.topshop.com/webapp/wcs/stores... (Wear it fashionably though.. across your forehead, you know!?)   Only 7 but probably get one cheaper in Primark haha.. leaves you with more money for your accesories!

JufMBoLCaa	good god! those look impossible to walk in, the platforms are much too high xP    I dont think your problem would be looking girly, those shoes are pretty girly, in my book.  but if you wear them with a mini skirt you will look trampy.  so maybe a halter dress also in black? that comes just a bit above the knees, not too over the top.  or a print dress with black somewhere in the print.|`|ArrbBtY6aa	They look like hooker shoes.

DgrYJ9m4aa	I get it all the time.  I'm 20 and I've just started looking for a good job and every time I go in for an interview they look at me like "where's your mother?"  They always say I look 13 or 14!  And people do make very harsh judgments at times... Like that I must be stupid because I look so you which is not true.  I hate it so much.  And I recently got engaged and every time I tell someone I don't really know instead of congratulations I get laughed at because they thing I'm a young teen.  The weird thing is when I was younger people thought I was older... I think It has to do with me gaining a little weight over the years and having the "baby face"  With you being little that wouldn't be the problem though.  I don't really have any good advice but just know you aren't alone.|`|jeX5VZAtaa	No means you age well!|`|UgvLTFmSaa	I know exactly how you feel! People do that to me all the time saying iam younger, but i try to think positive and think about when iam older i will look younger then and noone wants to look old when they are, so maybe it;s better. i really dont know. There's nothing we can do though about it, people are going to say what they want.|`|4YFFb2kGaa	a picture would help..    but maybe they way you do your makeup.|`|gdGDvWTDaa	what you need is an edgy hair cut    go short, with a bob  wear less makeup..and more mature  and dress nicer|`|9c40eaa9939b61f8b2a2080ce89b4c22aa	Well I'm 18 now and people still think I'm 15 or 16...I guess in the extreme long-run it would definitely be a compliment, but for right now maybe you should try doing stuff that makes you look a bit older like wearing dark eye make-up or something. Good luck!!! =]|`|XkWTsyJdaa	ur lucky cuz that means when ur 40, u'll still look like early 30s or even in ur 20s! however, the bad part is the "kids having kids" thing. if u ever hear someone say that again or give u a weird face just say "yes, this is my son. and guess wat, i'm 27 believe it or not. atleast when im ur age, ill look young"|`|8cDd70dSaa	Maybe get a shorter haircut?

Just think when your 50, people wil think your 30, maybe younger.|`|xuV1xsImaa	I get the same thing! I have graduated college and been working in my field for over a year and i still get people thinking I'm in High School.     I don't get offended but I do get really annoyed with it. I had one lady scratch my ID at the liquor store like she thought it was fake, and when I called her out on it she was like No, No, I wasn't.    For me i just try to take it as a compliment cause once I'm in my 30's ill be lookin' way hotter than my friends and that will make up for all the annoyance of dealing with people thinking I'm so young.    Don't try to make yourself look older, maybe more sophisticated :D I think people like us really have to stray away from being too 'trendy' and shoot for more of a classic look.|`|6DSyp4ZLaa	I was told that, then I cut my hair short, and for some reason, I didn't hear it anymore. I'd rather look like a 16 year old than act like one though LOL|`|DMxfGWcXaa	I know what you mean. I'm 18 now but I'm always told that I ether look older (like 22) or younger (16). personally, I don't know whether to take is as a compliment or an insult but at least they say I'm pretty and that's what I always looked at.    I guess you could always try dressing in less bright colors. try different textures and fabrics, "teens" tend to wear smooth, polyester and/or cotton. rather than wearing jeans, try different styles of pants or leggings paired with an artsy dress. regarding your hair, I would just leave it down more often and cut it to accentuate your features. when you accessorize, go for a simpler look rather than always having the earrings, necklace, bracelet that match your outfit, don't be afraid to mix and match.|`|0d2a52c440b839d0db4b8ffc9f51c8d7aa	cut the hair i hope so its ok i hav the same problem|`|6txsgLVuaa	look at the bright side of it, as you start aging atleast you will still look younger :) so sometimes its not always a bad thing. i would much rather people tell me i look younger than i am than older than i really am...then i would probably get offended. is it because of your face or your height? because you are pretty short so that could be it. im 5'6" and 18 years old, some people tell me i look older than my sister but shes actually a year older, shorter than me & has more of a baby face. our style is very different shes more of a jeans and t shirt type girl i love to get all dressed with heels and dresses anywhere i go. im a model so thats probably why. if you look younger theres not much you can really do to change your appearance other than dressing a little older, wear some heels maybe & some makeup? but dont take it as something bad. because when your like 50 you'll be happy to hear that you look like your in your mid twenties :) lol. my moms 50 and people mistake her for looking a lot younger, like in her mid thirties so it makes her happy.

I think its only okay if it is part of your heritage.|`|YIplumj8aa	This satirical question has been asked many times before in this section.  Yes it is quite a stupid trend for American kids to get tattoos in a language they don't know (it doesn't stop at Chinese and Japanese; some get words written in Latin, Italian, French, etc).  I think it's their attempt at trying to be different but what they don't get is that everyone else who has no idea what to get is getting the same thing.  These are usually the people that are getting tattoos just for the sake of having one.  And yes it's true - if you don't know the language and your tattoo artist doesn't know the language then you can't be sure that what you're getting means what you think it does.  There is a website dedicated to this phenomenon, I can't remember the name of it though.  They have pictures of the tattoo and then explain what the tattoo was SUPPOSED to mean and what it ACTUALLY means.  I don't think people are going to stop getting these any time soon.|`|nE9BaUWIaa	I don't think Chinese or Japanese skin can withstand tattoos.|`|gAuIixm6aa	Well, I know that in Japan tattoos are very taboo and pretty much only gangstas have them. They usually go for traditional style. But they do like tshirts like the ones at engrish.com|`|qQqC2cHIaa	A friend of mine went overseas to Indonesia, Hong Kong and Japan.  And he answers: "They sell t-shirts, notebooks, bags, and other merchandise emblazoned with english words and phrases that make no sense whatsoever. The people just want to appear that they know english. They're all posers, actually"  He has a kleenex box that says "cold hours make for tissue happy" and a memo book that said " I am kitty and your time for me" and his favorite was a shirt that said "jesus of the lesbian nuclear whales against boycott of the migrant farm workers."  He says that everyone was wearing these and probably had no idea what it meant.  One person thought it was a serious protest.|`|D6LJJ1AYaa	hahaha, that's a really good question|`|hml9tgWQaa	People in Japan will buy anything with english on it... t-shirts that make no sense or call them idiots... so I have a feeling they might.|`|52e7jxDjaa	haha Idk. I never even thought about that before. I doubt it because so many ppl speak english over there and it isnt something unique/cool/mysterious to them, like chinese is to us. If everyone in the US spoke chinese I bet there wouldnt be a lot of ppl with the chinese tattooes because everyone would know what it meant.|`|TcJPoZG4aa	Chinese and Japanese kids don't get tattoos.. it's just not part of their culture. If anything, tattoos are more common in Japan with the Yakuza (Japanese mafia.) All you morons that think otherwise need a reality check.. and possibly a lobotomy.
6kxWMPEQaa	You need to think about yourself and make that choice on your own.  It is going to be something that is on your body for life so I would put alot of thought into it and not go by what strangers tell you online. I would also talk it over with your tattoo artist, they can suggest spots that are better suited based on the tattoo and spots that are not good.  They can also place the tattoo trace in the different locations and u can look at it in the mirror and see if that helps you decide.  And think about life down the road.  When you put your hair up do you want your tattoo to be showing?  When you wear flip flops or dress shoes, do you mind your tattoo showing?  Location of a tattoo definetly depends on yourself.|`|hml9tgWQaa	I personally would go with the back of your neck, but this is a personal choice. you're the one who has to live with it for the rest of your life.  Good Luck :)|`|JZqdXpLYaa	From one female to another, I wouldnt get it on my lower back, but that's just me. To me, it's a slutty thing to do. Hence the term "tramp stamp." Another reason I just wouldnt get it there, my fiance wouldnt like it.    The top of the foot is where it's going to start fading the quickest. Your socks and/or shoes are going to be rubbing on it. My cousin has one on the top of her foot, and she needs a touch up. I have a friend with stars on the top of hers, started fading a few months after she got it.     I put my first one on my shoulder blade and everyone said it was going to hurt. It didnt.     I think the back of the neck is going to hurt the worst.    As everyone's already said, it's really up to you.|`|UYnZtJ2daa	You should put it in the spot you want it in the most. None of us can make this decision for you.

It is   reccommended by experts.  My hair has always been thick and  healthy. It started falling out and was very dry even when I used  hair conditioners. My nurse practioner told me about the Primrose oil.  I have been taking it for about 4 months and my hair is great again.|`|1JBYY8bDaa	if you havn't had your hair cut in a while that could be the reason it is like that, even if you dont want to cut your hair you should at least get the split ends removed to make your hair healthier.|`|lnZ3hdmhaa	try shampooing it|`|OkZBNhhgaa	I used to live in a hard water area for a bit and my hair went just like yours so it could be the water.  As there is nothing you can do about the water I'd suggest buying yourself shampoo and conditioner for dry / brittle hair and if you have the money invest in an intensive conditioner too and use it once a week til your hair improves.  Alternatively you could use my wee trick of giving yourself a weekly treatment of Olive Oil!  Yes, I know but it works.  Put some on the ends of dry hair (try and avoid your scalp) and massage it in then wrap your hair in some cling film with a towel on top then go do something else for half an hour.  Then wash and condition as usual but you'll probably have to rinse and repeat the shampoo.  It's cheap and cheerful and works a treat for me.  There's no harm in giving it a go, is there?|`|1A9TdN4yaa	Try a lotion and a shampoo called Ziravie, which combines tradition, science and nature to provide a mixture of natural nutrients, minerals and vitamins, which act on the scalp in depth, that in turn stimulates strong, healthy, robust hair growth, strengthening hair roots, gives volume and reduces thinning , hair loss and baldness. plus check their website which gives a combination  of fruits and vegetables that  helps to strengthen the hair roots internally.  The lotion that I use helps to accelerate hair growth but it is a a process first it calms the scalp, itching reduces, then with discipline use hair fall stops, within 3 weeks of use the hair roots strengthens and you start to see volume and silkiness  The website is www.ziravie.com but I bought it in Spain and now it is available on ebay.co.uk under the ID of hair-treatment    When you eat healthy you need to make sure the food you eat is fresh and the food that contains Vitamin B6, B12, A , E and proteins

But in the rest of my piercings, also some of which are in my ears I can wear regular stainless steel jewelry. When you go to get the piercing done, make sure you are in a sterile shop. But then talk to your piercer about it. Make sure he answers all your questions about infected piercings. But really the only thing you can do is get it done and see how it acts. Happy Piercing!!!|`|Ivj6hki9aa	yea it is a different part of you body but also its the same skin. i don't know if i would get it done i would be to scared to have my belly button infected but maybe it wont. do you wear jewelry like necklaces and rings if you can wear those it might now get infected. good luck.|`|RY1kqoRNaa	My suggestion is to educate yourself enough about the infections or side effects of getting your belly button pierced and what safety measures you can take before you go and get it.the internet is full of these articles.my wife likes this website.    http://www.bellypiercings.net/    she's 36 and she had those same questions.it's good to do research.knowledge is key.

6kxWMPEQaa	I would definitely think about your friendship and what is important and meaningful to the both of you.  Come up with some ideas of things that are special to you both. A song, a saying, a word, a sport, a location, an animal, etc.  Then I would google some pictures that go along with your idea and bring them to your tattoo artist.  A good tattooist will be able to work with you guys and create a tattoo that is both meaningful and original to just the two of you.     Good Luck!|`|2wvKmongaa	Me and my best friend got tattoos....we both got dragonflies ...this may not seem like a "best friend tattoo" but to us every time we look at it we think of each other....they are not exactly the same dragonfly but they are in the same spot :-)|`|041d18df5f086710632e48a64ed9c129aa	I think this is a very nice idea!     Personally, I would go for a textual tattoo....    friendship quotes, there are some really beautiful ones out there.     Depending on the quote, you can have one part of it and she can have the other. Or you can both have the same quote. Its quite nice. Also, since both of you are best friends yet very different, text can be designed to look very different. the font, the color, and the actual way it is written. maybe one of you can have it circular, the other straight, the other vertically, the other horizontally....    Here are some quotes:     "My best friend is the one who brings out the best in me."- Henry Ford     "What is a friend? A single soul in two bodies."  - Aristotle     "... no man is useless  while he has a friend."  - Robert Louis Stevenson     "Let me be the one you call If you jump, I will break your fall, lift you up and fly away with you into the night If you need to fall apart, I can mend a broken heart, If you need to crash, then crash and burn, you're not alone"   -Crash and Burn by Savage Garden    (This one might be cool to break up)       " A real friend is one who walks in when the rest of the world walks out."     "A friend is someone who knows the song in your heart, and can sing it back to you when you have forgotten the words."     "A friend is one who believes in you when you have ceased to believe in yourself."     "True friendship is never serene." Mariede Svign       Another cool thing about textual tattoos is you can get them as big or as small as you want.     Its awesome.     I hope this helps!     For example:|`|JZqdXpLYaa	My opinion, "best friend" tattoo's like a "best friend" necklace or trinket is stupid. If you really want to do something like that, get matching ones.    A tattoo artist could help you out. Just go tell them what you're thinking about and they can draw something up for you. If you like it, go with it.|`|YIplumj8aa	You should get something that is unique to the two of you.  Why don't you brainstorm things that the both of you are into - hobbies you like, music you listen to, things you like to do together.  For instance if you both love going to the movies one of you can get a movie ticket and the other can get a tub of popcorn.  If you both love going to concerts one of you can get a microphone stand, the other can get some music notes.  If you both love eating sweets one of you can get an ice cream cone and the other can get a cupcake.    Those are just some ideas, but I'm sure you can come up with something on your own.  Good luck.

AA10458195	Is it possible that you sleep with your face scrunched down into the pillow and coverings? If so you need to learn to sleep on your back.

I don't know if you have any Michael's craft stores in your area but most craft stores will have them. Look near the t shirts and purses and other things they sell. They carry the aprons so that you can buy them and decorate them. So they are always white. Or you can try the craft dept. at Wal Mart. If all else fails, check pottery barn or a nearby college if they have a culinary department.   if your party is at least a week away you can always get one from ebay or any other website. good luck and have fun at your party :)
eytlIKITaa	Try Target.|`|uMFT3ujWaa	i just got some from wet seal they were 25$. I know its a little over but their worth it. I got them online but they probably sell them in stores too. I even saw them at charlotte russe.

If you go shoulder length then straightened hair would look best.  If you go long which I think would look the best you should curl your hair.

0rMUi02laa	im a guy and i got laser hair removal on my face. mostly for my cheek hair which caused alot of oil and for my neck hair so my beard would come in nicer. its painful on the face, as im assuming that's what you mean. and its several treatments. price im unsure of but im confident its less than $100 a treatment. but it may even be much less than that.     what mine does is my doc creates a line of where i want my hair(my beard) and he'll zap at the area I don't. so maybe 20 times on my cheek area in a linear pattern. each zap is like getting a rubber-band hit on your face very precisely. but it does the job. But you have to get it done every two weeks at least 3 times for it to be permanent.|`|MEPn7M7gaa	I have been waxing for the past 3 years, I don't think that when I am old enough to get laser treatments that I will. I would be worried about getting cancer from it.
5KAreKDjaa	Hey I think that's a great idea! So you want to start your own business? This is actually much easier than it sounds (my parents have their own car selling business and neither of them have any qualifications to speak of!) Selling t-shirts from the interenet shouldn't be too difficult and if you make them yourself your costs'll be very low. I really think you should go for it, keep your old job though! There's loads of sites on the net to help you too.  Hmm as for a brand name, not sure, not really my forte... This is my fave tee site  http://www.moretvicar.com/index.php  One option is to allow sites like this to sell your brand of t-shirts    A final note, make sure no one else is doing anything similar although your idea sounds very original to me =D|`|6jM9aAAvaa	Yeah go for the shirts! i loVe your idea!!!!|`|x8QlEZhAaa	you could take a fashion course at the art institutes,and maybe intern at a fashion buisiness for experience. or you could start an online fashion buisiness selling your t shirts. start with an outline course first though|`|Ql857598aa	idk , go to a fashion designing school .
2HPa1ETUaa	I think it was a good idea. It's more interesting. Never seen anything like it.   The red and orange does look funny for the star dust, I think light blue would have been better.  But you liking it is most important.|`|LHmmosxlaa	its ok...but a dumb idea..over time the colour will fade and your tatoo will look cheap|`|3rU9tCp1aa	I love it... it's different and original!  Ive never seen anything like it!    :)|`|ZSkPk40Jaa	I like the stars, but not the butterfly inside the star. Plus the color choice is a little odd. i have a star tattoo on the back of my wrist. blue green and yellow. other than that it looks great!|`|MEPn7M7gaa	Look nice,  but I am not a big fan of tattoo's|`|bKtpUETnaa	its ok|`|7add460ae24c9452ae87b5a99c5aa756aa	It looks like acne|`|VcIg1R1zaa	yes it's very nice but the red dots are like an allergy|`|6kxWMPEQaa	I personally am not a fan of star tattoos for the simple fact that that is what everyone seems to get when they don' t know what else to get.  I prefer to like tattoos that have a special meaning and some originality to them. I mean the tattoo itself is nice, its just something that is so over done.  But if you like it that is all that matters.|`|gu0AxKyiaa	its not bad as everyone is sayin it is, alot of people are haters so they say what they want to make you mad an feel bad about your self when really they like it, dont get me wrong i wouldnt get it cause ima dude but ima be getting stars tattooed on me my next tattoo sessions so i like it|`|FS9ibKB5aa	i like it but i have to agree with others that the red stars look like a rash or something. maybe you could have them colored over so that they look less like a rash?    other than that its cute.|`|6BWINZAdaa	No, the red dots look like acne or a rash|`|O6DSFJbTaa	It IS nice, but the red stars do look like a rash.  I know someone with red star dust on her foot and I always think it is a rash.  As long as you like it!|`|fee80ea1112f0f01af4280757ecf8929aa	YES. It's really nicee|`|CVuWkUkwaa	the stars are ok but i dont like the red bits, it looks like a rash|`|hml9tgWQaa	I think its kinda cute :)|`|52e7jxDjaa	its trashy. if youre going to get a tattoo then at least get something really artsy and cool. Not the typical ordinary girl getting a tattoo just to have one so she can say shes cool...lol.|`|AA10817618	I think it's cute! I like the butterflies and the way the stars trail off. I hate taking photos of tattoos because the camera doesn't always get the full effect mine looks funny sometimes. I like yours a lot!! I actually want to get something similar with the stars and the colours too
SUR4h6VNaa	Wipe off the excess product before you but it on your eyes, a good way is to place the wand into a piece of loo roll and squeeze the excess off. I think also your wearing too dark mascara, try brown|`|6txsgLVuaa	honestly i LOVE long lashes. some girls would kill for them because they have none whatsoever, so they actually go out and buy fake lashes because not even mascara can help. so i would say take advantage! i would keep using the mascara..i dont think its too much. especially because it brings out your eyes more and you do have very beautiful eyes!|`|U2wJ4WrNaa	I think wear 2 coats. Your lashes are not very thick. If you worry about looking too made up why don't you try a brown mascara it's more subtle. My lashes are quite a bit longer than yours and even I hate not wearing mascara!|`|jaAolejUaa	Two coats of Mascara|`|WSlxwSlFaa	I never wear it I do think it looks to made up, and long lashes are male trades anyways. throw out the gupe, you'll probley damage the skin around your eyes from trying to wash it off, anyways.|`|baQpo0kdaa	one isnt too bad but two coats is too much. and do you have any pics without it at all? that would help|`|Twq7efhQaa	This is completely a personal preference and most girls would kill to have your length of eyelashes!! I think that your lashes look pretty with - its makes them really striking and your eyes stand out. :)|`|P0EAzyw8aa	oh dear  spider eye syndrome, use a lighter shade with a thinner spacing brush, green or blue would suit your colouring better.|`|A7ovwP94aa	It looks  nice with one or two coats but if you feel too made up - just use the one coat to emphasise your eyes and just use brown.|`|YoYiJu2iaa	i think you look awsome in mascara....  you just have to make sure your lashes don't clump!|`|mB7AjYf4aa	Get a clean brush (ie: one that comes without mascara) and use a little vaseline.  It will darken them slightly and separate and comb them without getting that clumpy "made-up" look.  Hair gel on a clean brush will do the same thing, but you need to be careful using a product like that so close to the eye.  Good luck.
uyWkEbINaa	YES.  Its none of there business.|`|TGtgMu8eaa	Yes I HATE It.  On The school bus everyone asks why im putting makeup on to go home in.  But I dont go home, I go down park n stuff with my friends.  I usualy say cuz I want to wear it wot it got to do wiv u lol|`|igrdohopaa	Yeah!|`|dPULl5hjaa	No, I haven't but maybe people ask those very young girls who look very sleazy.|`|Qgg6i6K7aa	Yes, it bothers me.   I tell them that I like to make myself even more beautiful than what I already am sarcastically.   I just love to wear make up because I love playing with make up.|`|JaDnYs54aa	ya its a little annoying because for me, i wear it just becuz i just love to be creative with it.|`|j2yLjm6Naa	Yes sometimes like when people tell me that I look fine without it I have alittle bit of acne not major but just a little and i like to cover it up I don't have low selfasteem but I sstill like to look nice and covering it up may make it look a bit nicer.|`|G2LPhdTBaa	I got a good answer for you though if you interested.    I think you said you were 18 ....    If they ask it in a nice way ?  Say ... I just like to experiment because I'm going to be a make up specialist or your a makeup specialist in training.    If they ask in a mean way ?  Tell them because it's what I like to do. It's part of my profession.    Actually it is you know.    ..... if they ask in a mean way and you have more friends than they have ? Tell them because you are grown and it's your choice.|`|Ql857598aa	no , not really .|`|CSlhFaejaa	Nope .. I will not ... But I will definitely check my make up in the mirror !

e8acf0422a83cf08bec0690c36a6c711aa	I have all of those brushes except coastal scents.   Ecotools is great because it's all natural, soft, and definetely afforadable. I really like the travel sets that they sell.   For elf, I really like their eyeshadow brush because it packs on color really well. I have about 5 of these! It's also a dupe of mac 239 (basic e/s brush)  I love sonia kashuk too! I love their blending brush, and their highlighting brush (dupe of mac 187).   I just bought a posh travel set of 4 and love it! It fitsperfectly in my m/u bag, and they are sooo soft!|`|PCKmu4hSaa	You can use MAC make up brushes  they have a very large variety of brushes and work very good for all make up needs|`|8dRhiDRNaa	I was in Sephora and asked someone who worked there what the deal with brushes is.  Are you just paying for the brand or are expensive brushes really worth it?  The girl went into a detailed description but the basic point was most median costing brushes are all the same. She told me unless I was going to spring for NARS brushes (which are her favorite by far but can cost $40+ a brush), then just go for the cheaper mid range brushes.  I ended up buying sephora because they were the most reasonable and I love them!|`|CSlhFaejaa	Hey there ! I have always been using MAC ... It works very well but like you I was too, searchin for cheaper alternatives. Kinda skeptical about cheaper brushes coz I was worried that cheaper means poor quality ...And poor quality doesnt pick up the make up products well .. But I was glad to find Youtubers who did vids on brushes reviews. And if you are skeptical whatsoever ... search youtube and they are many reviews by genuine make up gurus, users sharing their opinions and thoughts. For myself, I mixed and match the brushes brand. Below are the link to one of an amazing make up guru who take her time to did review on the brushes of MAC and Coastal Scents one .... I hope it will help you as much as it helped me ..     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuv646a7l...|`|lz8gOTJtaa	The Elf Brushes are just as nice as the MAC brushes and a whole lot more affordable:  http://www.eyeslipsface.com/products.asp...|`|rDsKB0uXaa	soft ones|`|iKYNUni0aa	coastal scents|`|ZZAD4Papaa	Coastal scents all the way! A lot of make up artists on YouTube recommend them in comparison to MAC brushes, and they are a log cheaper too! Good luck with them :)|`|1813e969734f403c231cf4d52107822eaa	I bought a eco tools foundation brush, I love it! try eco-tools!|`|2JQDpcZ5aa	yeah, mac ones are the best, so i really recommend saving up and just buying them like 1 at time to build a collection of them. like, if you work, every pay check buy 1 or 2 or something, thats what i do :)    but if you dont want to do that, id say get coastal scents and sonia kashuk ones :) they are good, especially for the cheap price :)    hope that helps youuu!
81pRv4rvaa	well, I wouldn't do that.maybe you should have someone do it for you.when you look in a mirror, it seems like your at the right angle.but a lot can go wrong.|`|kV5IRgpfaa	Unless you have some training or some kind of experience, I would suggest getting it done professionally. It can be really hard to cut your own hair, even if you have the right tools, it doesn't mean that the style will come out right. Have someone help you... if its the cost your worried about. Otherwise shop around for good deals on getting your hair done!|`|XlP0G1Woaa	not hard. if you want to cut all of it off when it gets low get someone else to cut it so its even.
hrrgpaV8aa	These 3 are my fave. I'll tell you the positives and/or the negative things I see!    1) http://shop.akirachicago.com/page.php?id...    Positive: Red is a beautiful color! It's quite sexy and is great look for an evening!  Negative: $180.60 !!!    2) http://shop.akirachicago.com/page.php?id...    Positive: Only $32.20!!!   Negative: It is 100 percent polyester which means not only will you  keep zapping people with static all night; it will ruin your hair as well!     3) http://shop.nordstrom.com/S/3002756/0~23...    Positive: Unique design. I love how its tight in the middle and goes out. It enhances and makes your figure look extra good.  Negative: $188.00!!

AA12324049	I would be too impatient to wait the color out because that would take months and it would look funny growing out.  I would use a product that lifts and colors all at once and then it won't turn out orange. Here is what I use:    http://www.beautybasicsupply.com/Loreal-...    Though I use the lightest shade, there are two darker shades of blonde in the line (B-1 and B-2). I buy my supplies at Sally's beauty supply. You will need 2 boxes of this hair color to dye your whole head ($4.99 each), an applicator bottle, developer ($3.00 - $5.00), and plastic gloves. Then once a month you only need one box of haircolor to do your roots so after investing in the initial supplies (which can be reused), you can keep up your look for about $5.00 a month. If you decide the color is too light, then at least at is grows out it will look less drastic. Good luck!

Edit *Edit *Edit *Edit *Edit *Edit *Edit *Edit *Edit *    Threading,waxing or electrolysis are good options.    Threading  Threading eyebrows has become more fashionable in recent years, thanks to coverage in the media. As you probably know already threading has been used in Asian and Middle-Eastern countries for decades, and is also known as khite. It is performed using a length of twisted cotton to catch and pull out the hairs    Although it may seem quite simple, threading does take a certain amount of skill to ensure hairs are not snapped off.    Threading is best for those of us who have a large amount of eyebrow hair and surrounding facial hair, as tweezing simply takes too long. If you are lucky enough to have just a few stray hairs and no noticeable facial hair then you probably won't understand what the fuss is about!    The main benefit of threading is the way it shapes the eyebrow, not just underneath but also the top. One of the major drawbacks of tweezing, especially when done at home, is that its easy to remove the wrong hairs which then alter the shape of the eyebrow. For example, you may remove thick hairs from underneath the brow which act as a form of scaffolding for the entire brow. By removing those hairs the shapes collapses, and there is no option but to wait for them to grow back in!    Threading avoids this as it only removes hairs from around the eyebrows. Its fine to go over the same area several times as only the hair is being targeted. Its also very good for removing facial hair, especially when waxing or sugaring has proved too irritating. (Lets not get into whether plucking facial hair is good or bad. Millions of women do it every day, and it obviously works for some but doesnt for others.)    List of salons that do threading:  http://www.qype.co.uk/uki/tag/threading    Eyebrow Waxing  Eyebrow waxing is nothing new. Many women have been doing it for decades. It isnt overly expensive and it lasts between three and ten weeks, depending upon the woman and her natural hair growth pattern. The cost isnt bad either, averaging between 10 and 40, depending upon the condition of the brows, the hairs texture, and the facility doing the procedure.    Both hot and cold waxing is usually available at most spas and even at many salons. The wax can be applied in a specific way to help shape the brows or it can be applied to those straggling hairs that just wont behave. After wax application and the appropriate waiting period is complete, a special tape strip is placed on top of the wax and then pulled off in a straight, fast, ripping motion.    The pain factor involved in this method varies from woman to woman. Some women have a lower pain threshold than others. Anyone can get a feeling for their personal pain factor for this treatment by placing an old-fashioned Band-Aid on a hairy part of the body. After pushing it down hard to make certain that it adheres to both the hair and the skin, it is ripped off in the same manner as waxing. That is a good simulation of a brow wax treatment.    The consequences of waxing may include red, irritated skin, a slight burning or itchy feeling, or even a minor rash in the area where the wax was applied. This can often be soothed with a cotton ball dipped in cold water. Once the irritation or itchiness subsides, an application of moisturizer can help to re-hydrate the skin. Any remaining redness can be covered up with makeup concealer.    Electrolysis  Electrolysis isnt new either, but it has finally become more affordable for the average woman. There are even a few home electrolysis systems on the market for those who are willing to take the risk of doing the job themselves. Most women will opt for a professional treatment, which is most often done by an aesthetician trained in the art of hair removal. These individuals can be found in some spas, at extremely versatile beauty salons, and in the office of dermatologists or even plastic surgeons.    The treatment doesnt take very long; about 10 to 20 minutes. The cost varies according to the job, the womans individual needs, and the facility. Prices can range from about 20 to 100 per visit. The good news, however is that the treatment generally doesnt have to be repeated after it is complete. Even when it does, it can be years between procedures.    Electrolysis involves the use of a special electrode that delivers a minor electrical shock current to the hair follicle. The current kills the follicle at the same time as it removes unwanted hair. Because the hair is often in different stages of growth, electrolysis treatment may need to be repeated two or three times to make certain that all of the unwanted hair is removed. That means that the procedure could be a major investment, not just in terms of hard-earned dollars but also in terms of time.    The pain factor involved with this treatment will vary from woman to woman. Unfortunately, some women find it quite painful. Its a bit like getting multiple shots in the area where the hair is being removed. Some aestheticians will use a special numbing ointment or cream that supposedly helps to alleviate some of the pain. Others say that simple inflammatory painkillers will quickly kill the pain following the procedure.    The consequence of this treatment lies in the hands of the person doing the procedure. One slip of the electrode could cause the loss of hair in the wrong place; remo
7XIyslo5aa	Not at all. Be happy in your body because you'll spend forever trying to change and never get it right. And just wear whatever you want, when the mood takes you.    There's no problem. In about 10 years time we'll all just be considered "old" and there'll be more young pretty girls doing the same thing we did.|`|JaDnYs54aa	not a certian way, no. everyone looks different|`|1c565ebf7059ca3dbee7caecb67dddc0aa	Yep thats why I'm on a diet.|`|XFC9mHo9aa	Yes. I'm on the heavy side and I can see certain looks of people even people I know, when they see me they usually mention I've gained weight and it makes me feel bad. It's rude. it makes me feel bad no matter how hard I try to ignore it. I'm usually happy with the way I am but there are times when I'm reminded that I should lose some weight. Just so you have an idea, my jeans are usually a size 10 and I am 5'7"|`|xmzvUFR3aa	no, i'm me. If some one doesn't like it...oh well, i like how i look and so does my man.|`|0ulKsvXlaa	Just stop buying magazines or watching the kind of TV that misleads you into doing this. All these people are trying to sell you something, they WANT you to feel unhappy about yourself , to look like Mr. or Mrs, "perfect" (their version of this, I might add)  How can anyone possibly be jealous of "super models" that have to starve themselves to keep their (horrible, bony) figures.  That they must put their fingers down their throats after they eat, just to "conform" to stupid media interpretation of beauty.  I don't know many men that like women so skinny (except perhaps gay-orienteted clothing designers). I certainly don't.   I'm also not too keen on over-fatness, this shows to me that the women are not interested in keeping themselves fit.  I LIKE ROUNDED, VOLUPTUOUS WOMEN, JUST LIKE MOST OTHER MEN !|`|Hg5Rup4Raa	i know your not supposed to give in to this media thing but ya i do .  but the funny thing is i didnt until i got my boyfriend .

I wouldn't say fat just a little bigger than the skinny girls that live near me.  Well my boyfriend says he loves how I look, then when we are out somewhere we see his old girlfriends or something and they are all skinny and barbie doll perfect.  I realize they are his x's but he dated them for some reason.   I feel like I need to live up to them for some reason sometimes.  Also in magazines and tv... I see girls and hear guys call them hot, but when they talk to me they say they like "real" girls.  They send mixed signals so bad and it makes it hard to know what is the "right" way to look.  My self esteem is definitely better than it was when I was younger, but at times it does get hard for sure.|`|L9G2wEsDaa	Yep, always dressed in pvc LOL|`|LOw4EVsHaa	yeah, everyone at the moment is wearing jack wills and uggs and abercrombie and fitch round where i live and although my parents are quite well off, they can;t afford a whole new wardrobe, i mean i have uggs, but then you get looks as if to say "you've got the uggs, where's the rest of your otufit???"  it is really undermining cos actually, the jacks wills clothes and whatnot are exactly the smae as what you can get in new look or h&m    i would like some help on this btw!

KWE0kIIlaa	I have the exact same problem! If I were you, use L'Oreal Prefrence (it's a goldish-yellow box), and go for what ever color you want, before you dye your whole head, mix the ingredients as the box says, then take a cotton swab and dip it in the dye and put it on the back of your neck, this is a test to see if you're allergic, or just sensitive to the dye, if nothing happens for a period of about 3-4b hours, you'll be fine, then have someone else just read the directions and voi la! Then let it soak in for how ever long the box says.  PS: on the side of the box it will have three pictures, of what your hair will look like when you use the product.   Good Luck!|`|VtZN0ov0aa	If I where you i'd get it done professionally because usually if you want to dye your hair blonde and buy a DIY kit it goes green.

I prefer this to liquid stuff as you can't really tell its there but delivers great coverage and feels very light on your face.

Blackhead removal seems to be the most difficult part of maintaining healthy skin. There's no easy way to get rid of these annoying blemishes. However, there are some helpful tips to prevent and get rid of blackheads when necessary.     Though the best way to remove blackheads is an area of contention, the most common method for getting rid of blackheads is to gently squeeze them. Removing the "stuff" inside of the blackhead helps the skin because you are relieving the pressure which causes the damage. We know it can be nearly impossible to leave a blemish alone so here are some tips for gentle blackhead removal:    Use a mild scrub or skin exfoliant to remove any dead cells and expose the blackhead.   Pat your face dry.   Place a slightly warm compress on your face for approximately 10-15 minutes in order to soften the blackhead, making it easier to remove.   Pat your face dry again.   Place a piece of tissue on the tip of each finger to avoid slipping, which could tear the skin and cause further damage.   Gently apply even pressure to both sides of the blackhead by pushing down, then up around the blemish. You're trying to apply the pressure from *underneath* the blackhead.   Only attempt this once or twice. If it does not "pop", you may bruise the skin, make the blackhead worse, and could cause scarring. PORE STRIPS: Using pore strips to remove blackheads is not recommended for many reasons:      The warnings on the box tell you not to use them on swollen, irritated, sunburned skin; not to use them on excessively dry skin; and not to use them on any area other than the nose. Also, the warnings state that if the strip is too difficult to remove, you should add water and remove carefully.   Removing the superficial blackheads, along with some healthy skin, will only help temporarily.   Repeated use of pore strips can cause irritation and future breakouts.   The adhesive on the strips can tear or injure the skin, especially if you are using an acne medication such as those listed above, or if you naturally have thin skin due to psoriasis, rosacea, or seborrhea.     HOPE THAT HELPS!|`|r1QLeM9yaa	Clearasil black head remover...... or open ur pores whilst putting ur face over a bowl of boiling water (for about 10 minutes) and then squeeze them!

WlRzcZpgaa	hi amy,    First keep this in your mind:    1. Choose cream-based styling products for dry hair, and avoid those with alcohol, as they tend to contribute to dryness. Keep an eye out for products containing pro-vitamins. Many styling products for dry hair are labeled anti-frizz or frizz control.    2. To care properly for dry hair, it is important to use not only styling products for dry hair, but also the right kind of shampoo and conditioner. Choose those labeled for dry or damaged hair, and do not shampoo your hair excessively. Shampooing strips your hair of oils, so washing your dry hair every day can contribute to frizz, even if you have a good shampoo    Check out these below products:  1. Best (Pricey) Shampoo for Dry Hair: Kerastase Bain de Force  2. Best Hair Mask: Kerastase Masquintense  3. Best Repair Cream: J.F. Lazartigue Vita-Cream with Milk Proteins  4. Best Thirst Quencher: Phyto Phytosesame Express Hydrating Conditioner  5. Another Great Conditioner: Redken All Soft Heavy Cream  6. Best Inexpensive Conditioner: Herbal Essences Replenishing Conditioner  7. Best Shine Serum: Kerastase Nutritive Vernis Nutri-Sculpt Ultra-Shine Top Coat   8. Best Rejuvenating Oil: Philip B.

5AkHM1mwaa	There are many things that you can do to prevent blackheads from appearing on your face. Most involve cleansing and some require the use of medications.   Avoid using creamy, greasy, and thick (emollient) products. This alone will greatly lessen your chances of sprouting blackheads.   Use a gentle and water-soluble acne cleanser.   DO NOT use bar soap!!! The ingredients that hold soap in a bar form can clog the pores in your skin. They can also cause skin cells to flake off prematurely and clog the pores. If you have dry skin you will need to use a cleanser that has a bit of moisturizer in it, but be careful! The excess moisturizers can cause an increase in oil on your skin.   Exfoliate to eliminate dead skin cells. If there are no skin cells to clog the pores, the natural oil is able to flow through freely. Skin Exfoliation also removes the built up dead cells from inside the pores that cause them to become misshapen and more-easily clogged. Using an skin exfoliant that contains 1% or 2% beta hydroxy acids (BHA or Salicylic Acid) will penetrate the lining of the pore. If you are unable to use BHAs, you could use products containing alpha hydroxy acids (AHA), however these acids are only good for surface exfoliation because they do not penetrate the pore lining.   Absorb excess oil. If you have oily skin, try using a clay mask that does not contain mint, peppermint or other irritating ingredients. This will absorb the oil that may clog the poor. If you have dry skin, this is not necessary because pimples on dry skin are caused by oil inside the pore, not on the surface of the skin. Also, oil-absorbing papers may help to reduce the oil in your pores.   Visit your dermatologist. Retinoids, which are a form of Vitamin A, can help regulate the pore shape which will keep oil flowing normally. The most common retinoids are tretinoin and adapalene, found in prescriptions such as Avita, Renova, Retin-A, Tazorac, and Differin.   Other medications. Hormone blockers and low-dose birth control pills can lower levels of androgens (the male hormone) and Accutane should be discussed with your physician in severe cases of oily skin and breakouts.     -www.howtogetridofstuff.com
YoYiJu2iaa	BAHAHA.....  you have the EXACT same hair as me, or atleat you will when it turns brown....  try some REALLY vibrant clips and pins...anything bright really stands out....especially green and red.  hairbands, different colours elastics, you know, all tht other stuff too...just use more vibrabt colours so they really stand out. your could alos try leaving some blond streaks to really make them "pop".|`|Twq7efhQaa	Brightly coloured headbands always go really well with dark hair and they come in so many different varieties.

Dark animal print will look good too!  You can really show off vibrant clips on dark hair as you have a dark background.  Any colours you use will appear more striking.  Really bright sunshine yellow clips are cute.  I have had every colour under the sun (apart from blonde!!) and my hair is currently black.  But when I was a really rich chocolate colour, I used teal clip-in hair extensions, I put them on the bottom layer of hair and the teal just peeped thru when my hair moved, I got so many compliments for that, bit different.        http://hair.lovetoknow.com/Brunette_Hair  - click on "hair accessories"    Enjoy being a sultry brunette!!!|`|AA11303574	I  have  very dark hair, nearly black and I find and bright hair accessory works|`|Z4p8lJoMaa	a bright pink head band :D|`|KrqGoxoUaa	wear pink flowers  bright headbands  u can get a lot of cute clips at target|`|MWrwnHM2aa	I would suggest large red clips to keep up the back of your hair when it is up in a ponytail. Bright colours work well also due to the fact dark brown is going to be dark.   Hair bands which are multicoloured look lovely with a ponytail, so I would really recommend them. Go to Claire's or other Accessory shops to get some nice hair accessories. (= Good luck!!|`|bMYw17ORaa	gold or silver :)
YJrrZo9jaa	Here's my theory.  In most species, the male is the "colorful" one, showing vitality and strength to attract the female.

Hair that has not been cut and is very long can struggle to grow properly then cause thinning. Use semi permanent dyes rather than permanent ones and use a treatment once a week unless you have oily hair. Only use a hairdryer when you absolutely have to, use at least 30cm away from your hair on a reduced heat setting use a detangler spray before you dry hair don't rub or brush thin hair this will make it worse, use only a comb.|`|0MunIx8raa	Eat more protein.|`|ycNt74yyaa	Nordic Naturals fish oils, hair supplement, a good diet, volumizing shampoo, and a non-heavy conditioner if needed.|`|9VqUC9Haaa	Get volumizing mouse... this works very well.|`|VAoG53KYaa	Go to your hairdressers and ask them to thinnen your hair.

RmIeoU7raa	After reading this it made me think that unscented deodorant maybe a better choice.  I usually wear Degree Ultra Clear Pure Rain.  It doesn't have a strong smell and that's why I like it so much.  I agree with you, I would rather smell my perfume than my deodorant.  I hate the baby powder scent and I don't know why anyone would want to wear it.  Anyways, you have given me the idea to try the unscented deodorant and see how it works.   Thanks =)|`|u4FGBKi4aa	Go with unscented and find a nice perfume...
8dRhiDRNaa	I have dry skin too. For one thing, try not to wash your face with really hot water or take a really hot shower.

wMeQoXkzaa	AMEN to all that.     Ridiculous BS is what it is. It went round my daughter's school too and it's just another stupid, ignorant trend started by stupid, ignorant people. Too much emphasis on sex on TV and in music making kids think that "everyone else is doing it" and they are somehow left out.  Better off being left out of such ignorance I say.    Wear your bracelets and to heck with the idiots who think what they think. Don't worry what people like that think anyway- they don't think very often afterall.    Even when you think the kids are watching a decent show there will be some hideous commercial that should not be shown to their age group. Ugh.   What do we do about it is what i want to know?

793oKjC5aa	I have the same problem and as I have very fair skin my dark circles look worse I have tried so many different concealers to hide them so believe me I can sympathise with you. The one I am using just now is Maybelline Dream Mousse concealer it is a nice soft mouse which blends easily and is soft on the skin and covers the dark circles really well and gives you a fresh look. You can get them in most high street shops such as Boots, Superdrug etc for between 6.00-7.00.   Dark circles are caused for a number of reasons including lack of sleep, hyper pigmentation and often they are hereditary. Try drinking plenty of water and try not to rub your eyes to much. Also try cucumber slices over your eyes for 10-15 minutes to refresh them. I also heard that placing cold teabags over your eyes is meant to help but I have never actually tried that method. If they still don't go away and the really bother you, you could always see a doctor and see if there are any other reasons why these dark circles have appeared.   Hope this helps =)|`|5SiFjlBGaa	get a new concealer?|`|KQPDtrw8aa	There are different color concealers that help with that.

4kk0HaAZaa	It's hard to say without seeing photos, but it sounds like your coloring would look good with many different types of blonde hair.  One thing to keep in mind, though, is that when you go to a lighter hair color you have to remove your natural color first -- as in bleach.  That makes going blonde a more serious decision.    Before you hit the hairdresser, I'd recommend trying on some blonde shades to see which one suits you best.  It's to do -- just log onto Daily Makeover, upload a photo of yourself and then choose looks you'd like to try.  We update the looks all the time, so there is always something new to try.  To make it easy, here's the link to a page of beautiful blondes:    http://www.dailymakeover.com/gallery/tid...    Hope I helped!  Rachel Hayes, Editorial Director of Daily Makeover

Other than that, I can't really think of any con's, or pro's for brunette.
e1434520b7d6b7db2b483084c9ad434aaa	Wait until you have a weekend or day off and then just try wearing your hair down with products. You'll never know until you try. :)    Here are some basic tips for curly hair that you might find helpful:  *Try to find a stylist who knows how to work with curly hair. You can find reviews by region here: http://www.naturallycurly.com/curlsalons  *Don't shampoo every day.  *Comb conditioner through hair in the shower.  *Apply styling products to dripping wet hair. Scrunch or twirl hair to achieve desired shape.  *Use styling products suited for your hair type. Dont know yours? http://www.naturallycurly.com/hair-types  *Avoid terrycloth towels on hair; use linen, paper towels, or t-shirts instead.  *Air dry or use a diffuser with your blowdryer.  *Don't touch (or brush!) your hair while its drying.  *Once completely dry scrunch out any crunchy texture.    For hair type specific products check out these forums:  http://www.naturallycurly.com/curltalk/  There you can find others with the same hair type and try out some of their favorite products. I would recommend something, but I dont know your hair type. :)    Lastly, it has made my hair so much better since I started the curly girl method! I used to almost never wear it down (it was a frizz/poof ball), but now I have pretty, shiny curls. ~:) Its pretty radicalno sulfates (shampoo) or siliconesbut its so great for curly hair. Give it a shot and check it out:  http://www.wikihow.com/Follow-the-Curly-...  http://www.ylcf.org/gotcurl/ (outdated product recs!)    Some other great curly care sites:   http://www.youtube.com/user/jessicurl  http://livecurlylivefree.com/home.htm    HTH! :)|`|Twq7efhQaa	I love this hairstyle:    http://hairpiece-sciencepro.com/sitebuil...|`|J0Nb5f76aa	I have naturally curly hair also.  I have found that paul mitchel "the Conditioner" which is a leave in looks great in our hair type.  If you wash your hair after your shower if you put some conditioner in and then some mouse or styling product.  Syle your hair and let it dry naturally.  Everybody loves curls so enjoy them.  I like my hair parted on the side and air dryed.  Also highlights look great with curly hair.|`|hWGPKX4Kaa	I have naturally curly hair too and it's somewhere between chin length and shoulder length right now.  I find that it works best if after washing and combing out any tangles, while your hair is still wet, put in some anti-frizz serum (to keep the fly-away stuff down to a minimum) and a little mousse or styling gel, scrunch the curls up with your fingers and go.

hTGu2ujeaa	The vitamins won't do anything except make it look healthier (supposedly). You hair grows at about half an inch a month, slightly quicker in the summer than in the winter. In the end all you can do is wait or get extensions.|`|fR2Geezcaa	Your hair has "growth spurts" but until then; I found a shampoo and conditioner from TRESemme' that makes your hair seem fuller.     There was even an article in Time Magazine suggesting it to thinning and balding haired people. For TIme to comment on a Health/Beauty item, there had to be something to it.  There was, the results were unbelievable! Plus it is so inexpensive too. You can find it at your local drug store. It smells great too!|`|BhEVhdvDaa	Hair grows on average about 1/2 an inch (13mm) a month but is influenced by health, age, diet and genetics.     If you want some advice on improving the health and condition of your hair, read on.     To help speed up the growing process you can take amino acid pills sold at any GNC or Trader Joes. Trim your hair every 4-6 weeks. Using Redken "AllSoft" shampoo and conditioner also adds proteins and amino acids to your hair with every wash.

Another tip is to take Biotene everyday.|`|zWX5GDehaa	get extensions|`|0cJjyogqaa	One thing that can help grow long hair is vitamin supplements. A vitamin that I've found to increase hair growth is Biotin.     Biotin is a part of the B-complex family of vitamins and also known as Vitamin H. but biotin is not a magic hair growth pill. It is a great vitamin supplement and it will need time to work through your hair.
jWFeb8jiaa	I'm older, but felt the same way as you when I was a teen. One thing I've learned is that you have to accept yourself and your beauty as something that makes you who you are. I can remember not believing it when I was younger, but it's so true that when you are comfortable with yourself and have confidence, others will see that and respond better to you. When you are insecure and uncomfortable, others can perceive that and may not view you as highly as they would if you believed in yourself. I know it's not easy to do, but it's something that you have to think first (and keep thinking and keep thinking) and believing it will come later - but it will come. Confidence in who you are will take you so far in life and happiness. Just try telling yourself everyday that you have nothing to be self-conscious about. What have you got to lose by trying? :)|`|2WfHLUyOaa	okay huni 1st off you have to learn to love yourself and i dont mean going around telling everyone that.. you just have to let your beauty within shine on the outside aswell as the inside i believe you will be fine .. ill say a prayer for you..xxx|`|MjFKHTXRaa	hun im the same way and in a way it sucks but in another way i know im pretty i just dont belive it i guess but it is all about wearing the right clothes it sounds weird but it works|`|bySPlhriaa	of yourse there are pros|`|SBFs2Cheaa	who cares if your boobs are bigger? there are other things that you could be caring about.|`|l69tjl0paa	omg like every girl wishes she had bigger boobs! lol and im sure that guys don't mind it either!|`|2HZX4FHjaa	Change something.Do your hair different. Maybe get a different kind of shirt. Something that would make you feel good. Or just do something special for yourself. You should give yourself more credit. Once you realize how pretty you actually are you might kick yourself in the but and say," What was I thinking!!" I hope this helps a little.|`|Ccp9bZLEaa	you just have to start telling yourself you dont care what others think of you. when those words sink in and u start believing u dont care then you will stop being self concious. you are only self concious bcoz u care too much about what others think of you.|`|ih8PG93Laa	I feel the same way.  I am a size D, and im 15.  But, I just think, there are people uglier than me.  And, I get up in front of my mirror every morning and I have  to say something good about myself, and trust me if you look hard enough eveveryonen the world has SOMETHING beautiful about them. Even if it is internally, Eventually, it will get easier , I promise.|`|ANsznbWsaa	Everyone feels self-conscious at one point or another. There's really nothing you can DO. Self assurance comes with time. Don't be so down on yourself. Think of the things you like about yourself. There is something whether you admit it or not.    And take it from another big breasted woman (I had c's in 6th grade) You will learn to love them.|`|b3453bfc6bcd9a621fa739d9ba1f4bb0aa	well first you have to stop thinking your ugly.   me myself always self conscious too.   I'm always checking if my hair looks good, or if my make is right and there is nothing wrong with that. but in order for me to accept how i look sometime i have to tell myself i think i'm beautiful. i know it sound cocky but don't do it in front of everyone. like when you wake up after you have taken your shower(or bath whichever) just look in the mirror and say your beautiful.  it works trust me, in a couple of days if you really believe what your saying, not only will you feel a change but th people surrounding you will change also(and it's a good change not a bad one)|`|fYjoTH27aa	trust me, you are blessed to have been well endowed... there are plenty of girls who wish they had that problem! =) (me for instance lol) im sure you are a very pretty girl but all you have to do is just ignore what everyone says... if you take it to heart then that is what is going to drop your confidence. just shine with your personality and be proudof your assets and ignore what everyone says.. eventually you will think you are beautiful inside and out =)|`|2r3KqcPbaa	I completely understand this. It sounds to me that you are a bit younger (forgive me if I am wrong.) I had the same problem and when I was younger I hated it, they just got in the way lol. It got to the point where all I wanted to wear was hoodies and it could have been 90 degrees outside, it didn't matter.  You just need to realize that you look the way you look, you can't completely change yourself so you just need to make the best of it. I used to hate the way I looked but now that I am older I'm glad I have big boobs and I love how I look when I put myself together. Try to look your best, and take those compliments you will recieve with a smile. People can easily point out low self esteem and in the real world you will need lots and lots of self confidence to get anywhere in life. Make the best of what you have.  I used to think I was ugly too...so just take one night, dress up, look your best and go out. Try to forget about the negatives and enjoy yourself and see what happends.  Good luck!|`|aXB3DjtZaa	A lot of Girls would die for bigger ones me being one of them so don't dislike them be proud of them. And wear clothes that make u feel better about ur self if u can buy any then try ur best every one is not happy with the way they look i hate the way i look but you really can do any thing about it.

pA4GHLXcaa	Long hairr  Lipgloss  Brighter clothing  Some eyeshadow  Lighter hair [if you can]  Do you have bangs?  looks like it..   It would look nicer shorter with lighter hair  I have bangs They are just below my eyebrows but you can still see my eyes. With your skin tone maybe blues.   Match your eyes.|`|BGNdKvXzaa	I can understand you desire not to be an outsider, but your need to fit in is misguided.    Why would you want to look "hot"?  Hot has very serious and overt sexual overtones to it. And with so many ladies claiming that men are pigs, only interested in one thing, and that what is on the inside that really counts, I would question anybody's judgment and sanity if they wanted to be seen as hot.    Nevertheless, if you want to be seen as hot, start by wearing plunging necklines, tight pants, or skirts which reveal more than what your parents would appreciate. Do not act slutty, but make sure your hips sway when walking.  And be sure to bend over, and bend over far, whenever and wherever possible.    So, if you follow my directions, you will no doubt be considered hot, amongst other things.  But be careful what you wish for.  You might get it. And get it you will.|`|U2wJ4WrNaa	You are very pretty, even without make up. If you want to look hotter just wear a bit of make up. Maybe some liquid eyeliner above your lashes and a nice lip gloss and a little blusher.|`|jbGsNRh8aa	Wear a low-cut tank top that shows your belly and smile, smile, smile!|`|xcO2W5Kiaa	flaunt it  curl your hair  were a little make up  make you outfits more flirty  but not like mini skirts that are to short that when you bend over everyone can see you butt  but just don't act like a slut|`|r1QLeM9yaa	you don't think you are hott? lol, you are totally gawgeous! Surely most girls would kill to look like you even if they had makeup on    lol! i was honest, you have beautiful thick hair and a really clear face. You need to boost your self esteem though, because confidence is hott as well... btw like you said, the photo could be better if you smiled, but other than that... I have got nothing.|`|hldaLhKkaa	yeah, u need to smile and prehaps where more colorful clothes to brighten ur face. But that said, u are pretty!|`|DRrJ0fuQaa	you are very beautiful you just need some confidence, you should go for the kim kardashin thing... grow your hair out long... or get extentions...curl it or straight with like a puff.. some volume in the back... then follow her makeup.... thats how you will be hott.. your half way there!! If you don't really know how to do her makeup go to a M.A.C counter at a department store and they will help you out and show you how!!!|`|XEcoJnt4aa	You are hot just the way you are!!!!|`|LOw4EVsHaa	take a step back, your never going to be perfect, but then nor is anyone else!    confidence is the key to real beauty, if you are confident in yourself and the way you are, you will fit in and have boys ogling after your confident strut!    wear a little make-up and straighten your hair sometimes, SMILE! be happy and positive and confident    wear clothes that suit YOU and that YOU like, you will feel more at home and confident in clothes that you actually like    i know this will sound weird... but meditate, it makes you more positive because you dont have little niggling thoughts on your mind and also it makes you more confident because you have no worries    hope i helped =)|`|7QHmh155aa	Your very pretty first off.  But as far as being "hot" I'd say s m i l e !  Also try doing something with your hair, maybe curling it, then brushing it out, so you get that kind of wavy effect.

I like the style.  Its in..    Dont wear BAGGY shirts! if u want to wear baggy shirts then wear skinny jeans..  but to be hot u need to have curves..so u gotta bring that out..wear low necks..ok Not LOW to sow cleavage. Just dont wear small necks.    Lastly wear jewellery, dont over do the look...if u wear earings, wear a ring..if u wear a necklace..dont wear earings...  Hoops will look good on you    Then put on some concealer..dont put on foundation and put on eyeline..and pale lipgloss. not to bright.    And ur good to go.

Trimming your hair reduces breakage as well, which slows down the hair growing process. Also you can use horse and mane shampoo, they sell it at many stores in the hair care isle. At a store like CVS it would be located by the   Rogaine. I have heard that taking some sort of horse pills can work, but i dont know how reliable that was, nor if they really work. To keep it healthy you can give your hair either mayo masks or egg. also beer helps soften your hair. and try to blow dry your hair as much as possible it drys out your hair horribly especially in the winter.

XFC9mHo9aa	first thing. do you curl your lashes AFTER you've put on mascara? curl them BEFORE you apply mascara. the lashes tend to stick to the mascara that's on the rubber part of the eyelash curler that's why they're plucked so to avoid the mascara on your eyelash curler, use it after you curl your lashes.     the best eyelash curler is from shu uemura. according to magazines and a lot of people. including me. you will have to shell out $24 but it's worth it. they have the mini eyelash curler which is $17. i have the regular one.    one last thing, change the rubber part of your mascara every so often. I change mine every 3 months. I don't use them everyday.    good luck!|`|fR2Geezcaa	I just bought a metal one on elf.com (eyes, lips, face) and after my purchase I read an article in Style magazine that it was picked as the best one from make-up artist.

WO68RZdIaa	In the business world, that would be called "dressed for success".  It is a proven fact that if you dress professionally, your self esteem is higher, productivity is higher & with less mistakes. The same can be applied to the way you dress for school. She dresses nicely at school because her main concern is getting a good education probably. Then on the weekends or during days off from school, she will dress more casually & relaxed.     I put that to a test once during Psych class in college, based on how the students back when I was in high school used to dress.     The slobs usually were getting failing grades, or at highest D's. Casually dressed students (including me) were running around a C average in most classes, the students that always dressed nice & the always present Preppies- were the one's on the Honor roll, had a GPA of 3.5-4.0, etc.|`|uFyHVPyyaa	maybe she just wants to set a good example in school?? oh, and don't use the term 'regular' clothes because regular is different for everyone, if you're so curious why don't you just ask her??     btw, it's her choice what she wears and her style so why would you want her to wear something else?|`|92IMMCtZaa	Maybe she just wears those clothes to school because she wants to be different. She probably just don't care what other people wear or don't wear. She maybe just wants to be unique instead of 'following the crowd.'|`|4QizPDQNaa	I think the best way to find out is to just ask. Maybe her family has taught her that it's important to dress a certain way for school. Maybe they don't want her to get caught up in trying to be in the popular crowd by wearing trendy things. Maybe she considers jeans and t-shirts too casual for school. If she's a sweet girl and she has plenty of friends, she prob. doesn't care if silly people make fun of her. As long as she's happy with herself and looks clean and neat, it really doesn't matter. But if you're curious, then just ask, "I was wondering--you always look so nice when you go to school, and most kids just wear jeans--do you just feel more comfortable in the clothes you wear during the week than what what you wear on the weekends?" You're her friend, so approach her with sincerity, and she prob. won't be offended.|`|RbsV1JvSaa	because she wears what she wants and doesn't care what losers like you think about it. why can't you just leave this girl alone?|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	maybe because she has realized its school, not a fashion show?     seriously, if she is happy dressing like that, let her

X2Zo5dH4aa	what do u do! didnt u leave it on longerr??? howw longg did u put it on for though??|`|UgvLTFmSaa	I think you have to leave the colour in longer because your hair was dark.|`|Twq7efhQaa	Ok it all depends on whether you want to continue to go blonde or to go bak to dark??    if you want to go blonde get a prelightener kit and apply that so it goes to its lightest it can then get an ashy blonde hair dye and put it on top and it will turn out the desired colour as all of the red tones will have been stripped from your hair also use blue shampoo to counter act the red tones.     however if u want to go bak dark then just buy dark hair dye.     best bet would be to go to the hairdressers|`|55i7bwRkaa	Well my mom is a cosmotoligist, and once my hair turned orange after i dyed it blonde, it would turn that color because the color you put in it already faded out or because you didnt leave it in long enough, or you put something in your hair causing it not to catch. my suggestions is to bleach it and then color it blonde, if you still want it blonde, if not color it a darker color but it still would be best to bleach it and then color it so the color can grab.|`|J0Nb5f76aa	ok I bought their strawberry blond type and i think with our hair color you can't go ashy blonde if you want blonde hair.  You have to go get a bright blonde for it to work.  So I would go the hair dresser and her fix it.  i am not pleased with what happened to my hair but it looks ok.  Kind of like my natural hair not an ashy blonde with pretty highlights.  Your other option is to dye it brown again.  You would probably like a hint of red color in your brown hair.  However I heard that once you dye your hair red it is hard to get the red out.  So you might want to think brown for a while.
Pe22Y1h2aa	Never do blond yourself!!  Really what you should have done was, gone to the store, and bought a stripper, now you have to go to the hair salon to buy this. It is blue and comes in a package or a tub, depending on how much hair you have. okay, then you put that on your hair, it will strip all the color of your hair, basically platinum blond, then you put the blond color on it. thats just to redo it though, if you are trying to tone down the orange, go to a hair place, like one that sells dye, and such and ask them for a toner, or just walk in and they will just eyeball your hair and tell you what you need.  Good luck!

CSlhFaejaa	Hey there ! Thank god for Youtube and the great and amazing make up gurus who took their time to teach and do reviews on make up ..     I recommend you to go to this belowsaid link which actually help to explain about foundation .. I hope it will help you as much as she helped me ...     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgvnprKsI...|`|FklngtvCaa	Good foundation:  MAC  http://www.maccosmetics.com/whats_new/co...  Revlon Colorstay  http://www.revlon.com/ProductCatalog/Pro...  Very similar but Revlon is half  the price.    Good concealer:  Same as foundation, but I  assume MAC would be a little  better. I've tried Revlon and it's  really good, though.    Things you'll need:  Foundation  Concealer  Makeup sponges or brushes  Moisturizer and/or primer    How to put it on right:  Wash and moisturize your face.  If you're going to use primer, put about 1/3 of a dime sized  amount on your cheeks, chin, nose, and forehead  and blend.    Use concealer on acne, blackheads, undereye bags,  scars, beauty marks, whatever.    Now take a small amount of foundation and apply  to the same places with your fingertips. I like to apply  it in little "streaks". Don't blend it yet, just put a bit on  your cheeks, chin, nose, and forehead.    If you use a brush, blend in a circular motion and make  sure you get your hairline and jawline. "Drag" the bits of  foundation around your face. Make sure it's not obvious  or streaky looking.    If you use a sponge, dab it in to your skin and blend well  around your hairline and jawline.    You can use your fingertips, too if you want.    Youtube:  http://ca.youtube.com/watch?v=drKpqszprZ...|`|1HLPznZhaa	Start with an expert .. Your mom ...|`|1813e969734f403c231cf4d52107822eaa	If you don't mind spending a little $$ you can go to the nearest Makeup counter at Macy's or Younkers or whatever you have near you.  They will help you pick your shade and show you how to apply it as well! Otherwise if your like Me and would rather spend your $$ elsewhere, you can buy cheap foundation, there are guides that show you your shade, match it with your wrist seems to work, as soon as the color disappears, that is your shade. As far as applying goes, splurge a little and buy a foundation brush, using a sponge will absorb the makeup, using your finger is OK to.  The brush just helps evenly cover your face.  Always blend away from the eyes.  Good Luck!|`|SiomJ10Saa	I like using covergirl concealer .. it's only like 4$ .. it has a blue top .. and it's like a lip gloss stick applicator    As for foundation, I like using physicians formula mineral wear.  It's like 10$    Make sure you put on moisturizer first! Or foundation looks really really fake. I suggest putting on the moisturizer within 5 minutes of washing your face to lock in the moisture    Put the concealer on the spots that need covering, then use your middle or ring finger to dab the color in until it's blended    When I put on my foundation, I like to start with a makeup sponge.  You can get them at walmart for like 2$ for a bag of 30    So I use the sponge to apply the powder over the small areas I just concealed, my eyes, and nose     Then use the brush that comes with your foundation, or your own ..     dip it into the power, but then tap off the excess so it doesn't go on too cakey, you can always add more .. but it's a lot harder to remove it. So just start small    apply it on your face in circular type motions with the brush, making sure to get all the way up to your hair line, under your chin to blend, and don't forget the area of your ears!   I know you don't need foundation in those areas, but that's just a good thing to do to ensure that you don't have a make up line .. you don't want to look like you're wearing a mask    good luck|`|0cJjyogqaa	1. Blend the cream foundation smoothly  2. use cosmetic sponge  3. macht your foundation colour with your neck skin   4. can use powder foundation just like the normal compact powder.    that is the most important point, when you used a foundation...|`|ljz5gKkYaa	First you need to find a color match. When you try out the foundation to see which color matches you DON'T use your hands to try out! Your face skin color is different then you hands. What you would do is put it on your chin and if it looks like your skin color and you don't notice anything then that means that color is suited. If you can see that the color is different and it's noticeable it means that color is not suited. I recommend getting started with foundation first then go to concealer after you are comfortable.    You can use liquid foundation for full coverage or loose powder foundation for light to moderate coverage. People would say liquid foundation makes them look cakey. It's actually how they apply it. For me, I have the tools to apply liquid foundation. MAC 187 brush does wonders, but I also apply my liquid foundation with a oval foundation brush a wedge to blend it out. Blending is soo important because you don't streaks or the cakey look.     If you want liquid foundation then I recommend trying out Revlon Colorstay Foundation for drugstore usage and MAC, Clinique or Makeup Forever for the high end cosmetics.    For loose powder you can get Bare Escentuals. There is a bare escentuals starter kit for 60$ it includes the foundation, mineral veil, a warmth color & the brushes to apply the loose powder. I use the kabuki brush to apply loose powder because it has a lot of grip and tends to give more coverage then the regular size one.|`|WvUP7eJFaa	You match your color by placing it next to your skin ( My wrist is the same color as my face I spread some on there to match my color) You just spread as evenly as possible and blend until there are not any streaks use the concealer in little dabs (mine come in a lipstick tube and I still dab) Blend edges with your finger until it looks as if you didn't put it on.|`|b1R6mtmpaa	use a liquid foundation that best matches your skin tone...just go to any cvs or walgreens and look around try it on your wrist and rub it in and if you can barely see it then its ur shade. then get a powder compact thats the same shade...its kinda like a process of illimanation of what brands you like. im 21 and i still try different brands lol let me know if you have any other questions, my email is megraw_jackie@yahoo.com|`|qiq1EjfAaa	first, have your mom take you to a place that sells makeup, (i go to target, drug mart and sephora) and have her help you pick the right shade.  if you want some more help with finding the correct shade, visit sephora and one of the assistants will help you.  once you have purchased concealer, i would also purchase a powder foundation.    To use:  start by applying some concealer to your finger, then dab it anywhere it's needed.(great way to cover blemishes.) then rub in in with your fingers by just dabbing and patting at the spot applied. if it doesn't look completely rubbed in, buy some makeup sponges (only about 50 cents to buy, or you could pick a few up at a makeup counter) you can use these sponges to help blend.  now you can apply your powder foundation.  apply it all over your face. once you've applied the powder, make sure that it isn't to visible, you don't want people to be able to see the powder. again, use makeup sponges for any blending.  finally, i would also purchase a bronzer. you would use this on your face, neck and upper chest area.  bronzer minimizes your face looking orange.   if you would like further information about the application of makeup, read the makeup guides by Bobbi Brown.  hope i helped!!
kUZvraXVaa	I love dawdling with new makeup colors and have found a few trusty tricks. To each color is a complimentary color:  Blue = Orange  Red = Green  Yellow = Purple  To make your eyes pop simply use the complimentary shade to the color shirt or eyes you have. If you have bright green eyes, pinks or subtle rose shades, even mauvey purples or warm browns would look good. But please don't go with a bright pink if your wearing a flashy top. If the clothes are the statement, leave the makeup neutral, browns and taupes and creams. If you are wearing one color, such as a black sweater and jeans, try a few different colors of makeup with a vibrant hue in the corner of your lids. Hope this helps!|`|UY2CPmroaa	that's a gorgeous color :)  and i think a brown mascara and outline your eye with a brown eyeliner.  it's very pretty and natural :)|`|U2UHJ03Raa	Brown would look best w/green eyes...|`|fYjoTH27aa	browns and gold colors will look nice... what is your natural eye color? if you want to keep it natural why wear the contacts?? unless you have to of course for vision purposes...|`|CSlhFaejaa	I will do a sultry smokey brown eyes with a hint of shimmery green in the lids and lower lash ..

My friends most-likely like that I'll have a sleeve, and I know my parents will hate it, but I'm going to do it anyway. Honestly, it's all up to you. If you want a sleeve, get it. Dont let anyone influence your decisions. I've done that, and then wished I would have done what I wanted in the first place.|`|hml9tgWQaa	If you want it get it. the right guy for you will see through the tats and love you for you|`|MowOCI4haa	Men are visual.  They see your skin, curves, eyes, hair, clothing, shapes, and everything about you in a feminine package.  They decide if they like it or not.  Tattoos distract from your natural beauty.  Because men are visual, a tattoo affects their opinion of a girl/women.  Most times it lessens their opinion of the person.  Then there are those that really don't care what you do with your body, but they don't really want their wife (future?) to be tattooed.  IMHO a tattoo on a women creates a boundary limit of sorts in a mans mind.  It also may establish a lessor opinion of you with men if you have a tattoo than if you didn't have one.   so make the decision wisely.    Good luck and may the good lord take a liken' to ya!|`|c7EKakQ9aa	with a sleeve people will look at you a bit more and judge you, but fu*k them all its your body, to look the part you gotta act the part , so be a little more confident with your self so if you get the ink done and someone says something to you, you'll be confident enough to tell them its none of there buisness and get there own life, do it baby, chicks with sleeves are totally hot in my opinion, i love watching when a girl is being tatooed, the way they tuff up and deal with the pain gets me all G'd up, BTW im covered with tatts some im a little biased|`|TcJPoZG4aa	Very trashy unless you are a performer or a tattoo artist.

F2QtzNyXaa	Ok so with like foundation i recommend not to use ( i hate it) use concealer for maybe some imperfections, and apply bronzer ( bronzer i amazing)    now they eyes( by the way they are so different and beautiful) um i use bronzer on my eyes and a light white sparkle right above my brows looks really pretty and natural.  eyeliner most def if anything just apply a little, but really it's a must to me.    lip use a little foundation on them like a medium color, and most def. chap stick, maybe even a little lip liner ( not to dark a natural color)    hope that helps but i think it will enhance your features!|`|FklngtvCaa	The first link isn't working.

n3akm5u6aa	well to go dark blond she would have to prlighten her hair first.thats why it didnt change or she can try using a higher percentage of developer like a 30 percent. to lift the the hair from its original colour.|`|Twq7efhQaa	It is harder for dark hair to be coloured light than it is the other way around. therefore she will need to purchase a prelightener which sort of bleaches the hair to a lighter shade and then once this has been done she can use the darker blonde hair colouring treatment as she done before to put onto of this one.  The hair dye will them come out the colour that it is supposed to.|`|SetyQexoaa	Sounds like shes trying to go lighter. The home kit doesn't have enough lift for what she trying to achieve. If this is her natural hair color she is a level 3., and dark blonde is a level 6. If she wants to go dark blonde use  the 6N with 30 volume developer so she can get the lift she wants. If she wants to go Dark golden blonde use the 6G with 6A and 30 volume developer. Example 1 ounce 6G to 1 ounce 6A plus 2 ounces of 30 volume developer. Sally's beauty supplies has the Ion Color Brilliance color line for this, and color swatches so you can see what the colors look like.  I think the dark golden blonde is a better choice, but go check it out for your self.  Hope this helps

Who some think is pretty, others might not.|`|7M8Pf378aa	ok, well this is probably Not the answer you were hoping for,but here goes.    Which one is caring and selfless?  Which one would be said to be a True friend that could be told anything in confidence without fear of ridicule?  Which one is always there when they are needed?  Which one judges a person not buy what they see,but where true beauty lies?  Which one can see the inner beauty in others?  Which one would do anything that was possible to help a friend in need?    That is the one that is the prettiest, as true beauty lies within, everyone has something about them that is beautiful but not all of it can be seen, beauty on the outside does not always reflect a beauty on the inside, and beauty on the outside fades with age.

CXKoPi36aa	If you want something different but with pure essential oils, then look for what are called Attars.  They are traditional Indian perfumes that have a base of sandalwood essential oil and have different layers of other pure essential oils.  They are rather pricey due to the way they are made, and they don't use any synthetics in them.  As the lady in the airport duty shop pointed out, unfortunately most of the perfumers have abandoned the old method of producing perfumes using only pure essential oils.  Mostly due to trying to reduce their costs.      The company Floracopeia still makes the Attars and "natural perfume" using only pure essential oils.     I'll put the link in the reference.
Y4UF3kWxaa	u gorgeous!!! them peeps just scared of your beautiful eyes girl xD|`|KQPDtrw8aa	You were a beautiful child. The combination of your eye color, skin tone and hair are absolutely gorgeous.|`|MEPn7M7gaa	Not bad at all.  You should have seen me as a kid, I had big eyes with HUGE eye brows and I was very strange!|`|SBFs2Cheaa	no you lok pretty|`|UY2CPmroaa	wow, your eyes are stunning!!  (:|`|nybJFlgTaa	No, not at all. you were really cute you have really unique features (maybe that's why they called you strange?)  I bet you're gorgeous now.  have a nice day! :)|`|jHd3irvDaa	no you were pretty|`|6txsgLVuaa	babygirl you were BEAUTIFUL as a child, and even more beautiful now im sure. dont let other peoples opinions get to you, they're probably just jealous. i would kill to have eyes like that..i always loved brunettes with a tan skin complexion and big beautiful blue eyes. its kinda rare i dont see many girls with your color eyes so maybe thats what they mean by "strange". but its very unique and gorgeous.|`|1c565ebf7059ca3dbee7caecb67dddc0aa	No Your eyes are BEAUTIFUL!I know a little girl that looks almost exactly like you looked,but her hair is blonde shes tan,eeyes just like yours though,and she a pretty little girl.|`|hrrgpaV8aa	You looked great as a kid!  I think the reason the people called you strange, and don't take it the wrong way, is because your face looks a little bit older than your age. Its not necessarily a bad thing. I mean I am 16 and look like i'm 10. It depends on the face structure; i have more of a baby face. That is all. However, you did look gorgeous and I bet still do! Totally jealous =)|`|Ou0lWczDaa	No you were adorable!Look at those eyes!:)|`|SA9y6yJDaa	they are haters thats all! look at your eyes and your skin tone, very gorgeous! not strange at all.|`|YFH5uqi2aa	you were so pretty!!! i am shocked they called you strange! you were beautiful just look at your eyes and i love your hair!|`|jeX5VZAtaa	Your eyes are beautiful, maybe they said strange because your eyes were so light against your skin and hair.

Blonde would look good with the red and brown and black would look good with the blue.|`|wG181Cpxaa	I like the blue with blonde hair.|`|djFYf3qUaa	I think the blue one is much cuter, it has a pattern unlike the other one, and if you're looking for one that will make parts of your body, the blue dress with the patterns is the best choice.  It will distract the unflattering (if you have any) parts of your body with the pattern.  But overall, it's a really nice dress.  I wouldn't wear any jewelry with it, because the dress is what they call ''busy'' and adding jewelry wouldn't look right at all!  Hope I helped!  Good Luck! (:|`|FUEHshj4aa	red. but it really depends on your skin tone and hair. so if your a blonde im guessing..  blue would pobly look better on u.|`|jaAolejUaa	blue!|`|5etI20Thaa	reddd =)|`|70aa0db8082ddead46f656ecb978193aaa	with a username like "blondebanana" I would guess yellow.|`|sLUiQ6Txaa	i think the red one looks nicer =)|`|WGzJUSefaa	Check out this site, it has tons of cute outfits for every occasion.    http://www.freewebs.com/fashionstyling4u...|`|fR2Geezcaa	If your dark skinned or olive complected I would go with the red.

They just had a bunch of studies were it proved that men are more attracted to red!|`|a8c453b32b44c7396a920c94200d4c4eaa	blue one is not so plain|`|4TNavgDuaa	I like the red|`|a88b0f44a1d7abe4bce01e6a248dbc64aa	blue|`|TWW5DGttaa	Red I think, the blue looks like it came out of the 80's.|`|iOyxPKnxaa	definitely red    depends on your skin tone though|`|GaxJ5Qiwaa	red its nice

Ubl8O8jIaa	i agree. you aren't girly. you dont wear any clothes that are really only for girls. you wear pants and long sleeve t-shirts which is okay but do you wear skirts or blouses?     you didn't mention where you shop for clothes, if you have a favorite store, if you wear make up, or if you like have any collection for example a MAC collection or even a purse collection.     you sound like an average girl, non materialistic =]|`|PNA7f0q3aa	Hey, I'M A GIRLYGIRL.

But you do sound like a nice, average girl-next-door girl which is the best thing.     I think of "girlie girls" not as normal girls who are just actually really pretty but instead those girls who are annoying and they're usually so vain and stuck up without a single intelligent thought running through their pretty heads. :)

YkN9VOOpaa	I would definitely recommend the FHI 1" Ceramic & Tourmaline Platform Flat Iron for african american or really curly hair.    Since your hair is curly, you should have a flat iron that gets really hot, and the FHI heats up to 450 degrees , and the ceramic plates and ion technology protect your hair from heat damage.    I also wouldn't get a flat iron with plates any smaller than 1" if your hair is textured or long.    I bought my FHI flat iron from this site and I love it, they have a guide for choosing which flat iron is best for your hair type:  http://www.simplystraighthair.com/how-to...

8dRhiDRNaa	Make sure  you buy shampoo and conditioner that is safe for everyday use.  Usually, the shampoo will say this on the back.  It's fine to wash it every day if you use a mild shampoo; otherwise, it will strip your hair of its natural oils and make it brittle and dull.  Bumble and Bumble seaweed shampoo and conditioner is a good choice!  If you want something a little less pricey, just look for "everyday use"on the back label.  Or if you want to try to skip so many shampoos, try a dry shampoo you can use in between washes. Oscar Blandi carries this.  It's basically powder in an aerosol can that keeps your roots from looking greasy b/t washes.|`|BhEVhdvDaa	Shave it off. Like Pedro. :)|`|xcO2W5Kiaa	put a little baby powder in you hair at the roots   it will soak up the sweat  make sure when you do this you are look in the mirror so it doesnt look like you have flakes or dandriff|`|ua4l7Iqyaa	wash it everyday|`|jz4pD0hgaa	Shave it off.
qQqC2cHIaa	There is no 14K silver. Silver jewelry is either pure silver, sterling silver or silver plated.  Sterling silver is the best quality, it wears well  and tarnishes less than pure silver.  Pure silver is soft and and scratch with too much wear and tear.  Silver plate is merely base metal coated with a thin plating of silver.  It's cheap costume jewelry, at best.    Gold is a soft metal and needs to be mixed with harder metals to make it durable enough for jewelery.  This called and "alloy" Pure gold is 24Karat. Karat refers to the quantity of real gold in the alloy, the higher the number, the more real gold.  The higher the number also means the softer the gold and the more likely to wear out and wear down.  14 and 18K gold are the two most common karat levels, you get gold jewelry that stands up to most everyday wear and tear.  It's the two  most common karats for wedding and engagement rings.20k gold is softer, but more brilliantly gold, more expensive and is used in special occasion jewelry that isn't worn every day, such as cocktail rings, and fashion chains and necklaces. lower karat gold such as 10 and 12k is cheaper because it has less gold and more other metals mixed in.  Watch out for "gold filled" and gold plated"  these are very cheaply made, being base metal pieces with a thin coating of 24K gold.  It's not good quality, the thin gold plate can easily wear and flake off.|`|x8A8DnpPaa	there is no 14k silver
f64elzDQaa	It would probably be best to wait till your belly button is all back to normal and the infection is completely gone  I don't think it would take to long, maybe you could go back to the place where you had it done and ask them about it  Then when you have it done again make sure you take good care of it so it doesn't happen again  Good luck :)|`|a503b666151ed0372de7a61b9a0a5dd4aa	my piercer told me to wait 2 weeks and by then it should all be healed over, just know that next time you will be piercing through scar tissue an its going to hurt worse|`|6txsgLVuaa	just to be safe i would probably go to a piercing place and ask them, because they should know all about that stuff. because it did get infected you should probably give it a while to heal, because if its not ready to be pierced again the same thing will just happen yet probably worse.|`|PkYeNAd8aa	I had to get mine done 2 times....

WlRzcZpgaa	hi,    If you follow this below mentioned process, then you would be helpful to your hair:)    1. Dont Cross Your Legs. Believe it or not, -- it skews your posture, so don't cross your legs when you sit in the stylist's chair, otherwise, your cut could be uneven once you stand up. Instead, sit up in the chair, legs uncrossed.  2. Bring Pictures. The biggest hair disasters arise when your stylist doesn't understand what you want. Pictures will help convey your message. Better communication, better result.  3. Be Realistic. You may love a cut on a celebrity, or a magazine model, but keep in mind that your hair may not be the same texture or your face may not be the same shape as hers, or, the cut won't look the same on you. Ask your stylist for variations appropriate to you.  4. Show With Your Hand. Dont tell your stylist how many inches you would like to be cut, show your stylist with your hand where you'd like your hair to fall.  5. Color After Hair Cut. Dont choose your hair color until you've trimmed. Only add highlights or try a new shade after you see the cutting result.  6. Go for Advice From a Stylist. Hair styling keeps your haircut refreshed. So, as your stylist finishes your hair, dont be heisted to ask your home styling process details and tips.  7. Renew Your Products. To get the right effect for your new haircut, get the latest info of new hair styling products available in the market.  8. Surprise Yourself. Sometimes, an unexpected urge to go a new hair cut style you have never thought about, it might be just perfect for you! So, surprise yourself!    Which styles go well with your type of hair?    * Thin and fine hair: If your hair is thin and fine, keep it short and fluffy  * Medium or coarse hair: This hair can handle most styles  * Heavy or thick hair: If your hair is heavy or thick, keep it at a medium length or it will not hang well.|`|yo0qnedIaa	It would help if we had pictures of you and knew your style.  But sounds like you should keep the side bangs and maybe just add some choppy layers in it.|`|Twq7efhQaa	ok by the sounds of things you owuld really suit an all over dark honey colour with some added highlights of brighter honeys or blondes to give it more depth and defo keep your length!     I love this style and colourings     http://www.topnews.in/light/files/images...
Twq7efhQaa	I had weaved hair extensions and they are worth the money that they cost.  They cost about 300 depending on the thinkness of your hair and they are very sore to get put in.  They only last for about 2-3 months.  If I were you I would get glue in extensions and they cost ruffly the same and they stay in for about 5 months and they are a lot easier to take care of.
8G8ZbNLQaa	Most model agencies have all kinds of models. Apart from catwalk, you can be a character model that they use in things like adverts, where they need a more normal size person or catalogue models aren't as tall as they wouldn't fit into the clothes from the book. It's only really catwalk models that need to be tall as designers are too lazy or not skilled enough to make their clothes look good on anything but a straight up and down coathanger, as it's the only reason they have to be tall and thin, so they don't have any curves or bumps and the clothes hang straight down. Some agencies only specialise in catwalk while others cater for all kinds of modelling such as adverts, TV work or other fashion.|`|sA3ae7eQaa	if you have very good facial features and body, you can rule the world of modeling!|`|FWPR006Caa	Course you can ..!!

Be Better if You inc Pictures.|`|RW2D2VlMaa	Yes you can.. Fashion models can be any size. Its Catwalk models that have to be 6ft.|`|pkZBBvlzaa	post a pic.    not sure if you would get work as a catwalk model but why don't you try stretch exercises.it would take some time but you coul grow 5/6 inches if you tried hard, with a nice diet an some vitamins.  if you're a teenager the chances you can gorw with stretch exercises are even higher. go for it.    good luck|`|FUZzB1JWaa	yeh ya can|`|65de15f23f2269f4a1cd8334a7b742f9aa	You are definitely tall enough.  It's not just about height tho.|`|KWE0kIIlaa	that's totally fine!  If you're a guy and 5'11 you'll definately make it for fashion.  If you want to go bigger like cat walk, eat specific foods and you'll grow faster, and work out!|`|ZEJuXw5Waa	To be a good photographic model a huge majority of the time you must be at the very very least 5'6. For catwalk you need to be 5'7 at the lowest. I'm not saying it's impossible if you are smaller as there are a few jobs out there for petite models but it is very hard to find them.    As you ARE 5'11, you will probably need good facial bone structure and good body proportions. You should also have straight and fairly white teeth, healthy hair and clear skin. Always look after your nails, that doesn'tt mean you have to have fake ones or manicures, just make sure they are clean and tidy at all times.     If you are a guy you can still be a model at this height, but the same as above conditions apply.    Good luck! Hope this helps,    JD x|`|LE2A9zFAaa	Yeah definatly !   Min. height requirements are usually about 5'8 sometimes 5'7.   Go for it !|`|QiAb31bVaa	the lowest height you can be is 5 ft 7   so of course you can!   :D
OcCgUsmLaa	Do what girls do. To make themselves seem thinner, they hang out with fat chicks. So maybe you should find some guys with teey weenies and hang out with them.    S|`|dPULl5hjaa	you're a dickweed for asking|`|J3Kz3OSOaa	Ok first of that does not exactly work.

And it's extremely normal for a guy to be self conscious about their size, my boyfriend even is after i've told him numerous times that he's the best lover i've ever had! He's not big, not small, just average but he works it! Theirs really no proven way to make it bigger. You just have to accept what your parents gave you and show confidence but not *********.|`|UaHZH9ifaa	put a G clamp quite tight on the end, then fasten it to a door or something and lie back a bit|`|AA10319837	since you're in the makeup section i would say:      dye it blue.    xD|`|r4i7xPnMaa	Hang out with guys that are smaller than you.

PvekxboLaa	You have to do what makes you  feel good.  Throughout highschool I too had the plain Jane haircut and my friends told me I every time I got it cut it always looked the same.  So I went and had it chopped off to my neck in the back and long in the front with major layors.  then dyed it four different colors, Im naturally blonde, so I had browns, aburns and blondes going through it.  It was a great hair style but it wasn't me.  I am just now starting to get my long hair back.  So if you want to change your look up a little be sure it is something you can reverse if it doesn't fit you.  And be sure your doing it for you and no one else.    Check out this Mark Magalog for some hot and trendy clothes and makeup.    http://shop.avon.com/shop/catalog.asp?s=...|`|TcUjRhPjaa	try to look a little different by going to the hair salon and asking her about ur hair and what would look on u then try getting a whole new look by getting a different style of the way u dress up and make sure that if you wear the same color over and over try to change around and look a litlle bit brighter..|`|x8Ji7sDXaa	get a fun new updated look.

WMdJLTjsaa	You could get a fake one like anywhere, Juicy doesn't make real phone cases but they do have covers that go over your phone.

6kxWMPEQaa	If it is something you want to get, then don't worry what others think.  As long as your happy and its what you want, go for it.  If people are going to be judgmental about you and getting a tattoo there, than that is their problem. Don't get a tattoo to satisfy anyone else but yourself!     Yes, I have a tattoo of 3 dragonflies (one for me and one for each of my sisters) and I wanted it close to my heart so I have it on my left breast.  And when I feel like showing it, I wear a shirt that shows it and when I don't feel like showing it, I don't have it.  My boyfriend was with me before, during and after getting the tattoo and he loves it because I love it. And even if he told me he wouldn't like it there, I would have done it anyway, because in the end, you need to do what makes you happy and what you want.|`|FS9ibKB5aa	you want to get your moms name on you breast?  strange.  i don't like breast tattoos. i think that they're trashy and they take away from a woman's natural beauty.|`|vZ4NXlBmaa	that has never once looked good to me  and if it was a name.....let alone your mothers name.....it would be even worse than the usual cliche that's put there    that being said, assuming you're over 18 AND mature enough for this decision....it's your body  do with it what you want    why should the opinions of strangers matter?|`|PBuYKm8Aaa	Tacky.|`|AA12032352	I see wanting to have it near your heart. I disagree though with the person that said get it up high. I have a tattoo on my chest, and the ONLY thing I would do different, is get it lower. When I got it, I was a bartender and wanted it to show even when I wasn't wearing a very revealing shirt....I also considered gravity in placement.    Now I'm an accountant and have to dress very conservatively at work. I still like my tattoo, and don't regret getting it, but in hind sight I would of placed it lower so that it would only shows in very revealing tops.|`|MEPn7M7gaa	Wierd.|`|40a0162cf512f95179345d8372418097aa	VERY TACKY!|`|JZqdXpLYaa	It's truely up to you. I wouldnt put it directly on my breast. I would have it above my breast near my collar bone, like in line with my armpit. But like I said, it's your personal preference.|`|c7EKakQ9aa	get the tat wherever you want, it's your body and if you've already got tats you know that there for life, i think a tat on a tit is cool and only you and your boyfriend will be the one's to judge you, mate iv'e got tats all over, even on my penis (that hurts a bit) and i dont give a fark what people think of me, getting your mums name is a nice jesture.  i say do it.|`|VFnQsri4aa	please dnt. its not kool|`|iO9yu9bVaa	SEXY. I love breast tattoos. Especially Eve's    http://z.about.com/d/rap/1/0/4/D/-/-/Eve...|`|9RhPrJQYaa	If it is the name by itself I would not do it.  But if you get the name with a design around it then it would look really good. I think when it is just writing then it looks trashy but with a design looks alot better.|`|jlrb0ZXoaa	only seems odd that its going to be your mom's name. otherwise breast tats can be sexy.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	I don't like them.  I think a breast tattoo just screams trailer trash.|`|9dNEw7etaa	That's trashy. Get it somewhere else.|`|7add460ae24c9452ae87b5a99c5aa756aa	I dont see a problem with it.  I know lotsa girls with important names on their breasts...because DUH!  Its close to your heart.|`|fR2Geezcaa	It does kinda come across as "slutty" for lack of a better term. The people seeing it won't know that it is to honor your Mom. I wanted one on my lower back and I heard a lot of guys comment on them calling them "tramp stamps", I changed my mind after hearing it several times.     I think since it is a personal one to you, honoring your Mom, maybe your hip might be the place. Then only the people you want to see it will.|`|kCdISEGqaa	Feminine/girly designs can be sexy if they're done right, but nothing too extreme.  If you get your mother's name on it, just think, every time you get intimate with your partner, they will be reading your mother's name.  May be a turn off for some people.  Give it some thought, tattoos are wonderful, but placement is very important.  Good luck and have fun with it!|`|ALidyPnXaa	I think you should get the tattoo somewhere else.  Maybe on your upper or lower back.  It looks trashy & punkish when girls  have tattoos on their breast.|`|P9wMY4Zpaa	sexy. i want one. hmm maybe with the income tax.    but maybe not your mothers name..thats kinda odd place for your moms name. i'd put THAT somewhere else. :)|`|gu0AxKyiaa	depends but i think its the best place to get a tattoo, your mom dont wanna be on your breast anyway haha
a19c6ecb151bfdcb3d0fb3559483fb5daa	ok so i also have ringlety curly hair and i straighten it daily.  once your ends are off, you should be ok, but ALWAYS use a heat protective spray before you straighten and a deep conditioning mask at least once a week.   also use hydrating shampoo and conditioner daily and anti frizz cream or serum.    if your problem isn't solved, go to your stylist and get a deep conditioning treatment done.|`|AA11293493	I too have your problem, well i did until i got GHDs which are amazing!    I found that when straightening my hair if do very small section at a time the overall effect is better because i don't get the curls trapped in the tongs which can look frizzy and ruin the effect.     Also as the other poster said there are lots of products out there for straightening hair, but not just the sprays, maybe a frizz control conditioner like John Frieda Frizz Ease and a hot oil treatment is needed.    Finally stay away from humidity and moisture, they are our enemies! i have in the past spent ages getting that sleek look only to go outside and be faced with a light drizzle or humidity and end up looking like a deranged poodle!|`|MhvwRwNKaa	Use Frizz-Ease.. helps alot =)|`|fA76RxPpaa	If you have super curly hair (like me), the iron won't work as well. You will need to use product on it before you flay iron your hair. And, put the iron temperature as high as it can go.|`|dtCJ6ohgaa	when you straighten it use a conditioner made for high heat. they sell tons of products just for irons and such.|`|BcJpPMPFaa	You probably have split ends. Getting a cut or trim should clear that  up. I know with my hair, it always looks a little dry when i straighten it, so i use a shine serum, and a heat resistant serum to keep the frizzies away.|`|VEi3R0craa	yes when your hair is straighten it is important that it is healthy so start with getting your ends cut and then you must condition it and blow dry with a round brush and section it off.  I always spray each section with oil sheen before I blow it dry.  Good luck|`|Da9Z0vivaa	use conditioner for high heat  once u get your hair cut it will look  MUCH  healthier
enokoZ6Uaa	I don't know much about Mississauga but you should look for some companies online to purchase your hair from. 20-22 inches is very hard to find in stores, especially a good quality of hair, that is that length. Depending on the texture of your hair I would recommend ordering on line from stores such as adorablehair.com or Hair ex in Sandy Springs, GA USA!

V5xHaIAcaa	Just blunt.    The fact that you shave having any effect at all on hair growth characteristics is just a myth|`|FklngtvCaa	Blunt, but she'll probably find herself having to shave  more.|`|810513944bc1fc28c514a617993b162faa	Just blunt.  The thing about it growing thicker is myth.    You should tell her to wax her arms, though, the stubbly feeling is worse on the arms and can get irritated when wearing long sleeves, you can get ingrown hairs and all sorts.|`|gSwobfujaa	it will be the same as before.|`|DAHBUvtLaa	Whoever said "just blunt" is a ****** retard.  When I started shaving my legs/ arms/pubes  they all grew back thicker, more coarse,   and darker. that's what happens when you   shave. ask any man with a beard.|`|oyWSVmdwaa	Why didn't she shave her pubic hairs too?|`|YtGt5uXuaa	Blunt. As far as I can tell, the thicker thing is just a rumor.|`|WBpVZpb0aa	It's a myth, it actually doesn't make a difference.|`|fnk27F8xaa	That is kinda weird that you care about your friends arm and leg hair so much.|`|IdZMRz7zaa	They will be Thicker and Longer on the arms, Legs will be Blunt.. But I shaved my arms and they are Blunt but they grown really thick and can be long until I shave them again.|`|4WttCv0paa	It'll be blunt and that will make it appear thicker.|`|JTBEyYjWaa	If it grew back thicker, bald men everywhere would be shaving their heads in the hopes that it would grow back thicker!  So, no it doesn't get thicker just blunt like you said!|`|qbSsciwVaa	Arms - They might be a lil longer, but it might not look that much differet. I did shave my arm before and they ain't thick the top of them might have a bit more hair on them and it might be a lil longer on me, but it's not to worry about.  Legs - I do shave me legs alot and they ain't no ape hair and they ai't that thick. I think they're just alil blunt like a couple of double hair or black hairs here and there but not everywhere and they ain't that much longer.    So I think she'll be fine.    Just don't shave it place that dont look like they need shaved like the top of her arms or hands and stuff cuz they might grown back some more hair then before.  It might also depend on her body.

(:|`|hiH6j2lZaa	As a licensed cosmetologist. I would defintly wait at least two weeks, strip the hair and then bleach it. And use a really good conditioning treatment every day.|`|HtIIoerhaa	I'd wait more like two weeks.    you don't want it falling out.    you just have to be patient     :D
DJqDAKmDaa	Cleansers that I've enjoyed, and by the way, hon I have the same problem as you. My skin is bad when I use Benzyl Peroxide. Instead use something that has Salicsylic Acid in it. Anyway I liked using Clinique, Murad, and the Proactive Gentle Formula. All of those lines are pretty pricey but they cleared my skin up a lot. Next you always want to use a Toner to clean up the excess oil that the cleanser did not pick up. I've enjoyed Clinique  1 or  2 and they also have an Anti-Blemish Toner or you can try the Clean and Clear toner for sensitive skin which gives a very cooling effect! And third.. MOISTURIZER! It's important. I like MakeupForever's Hope in the Jar, Clarin's, or Clinique Moisture Surge. All of these steps will help your skin become more clear and healthier looking. Also remember to exfoliate at least once or twice a week. I use Caudalie for sensitive skin from Sephora. Using aspirin, a little aloe vera or honey, and water and putting that all over your face will also make you face SUPER SMOOTH and reduce redness! I hope this helped you out..|`|XlLnrvD1aa	Murad has a whole line called redness therapy made just for sensitive skin which usually makes your skin red. It is very genital and it has a redness concealer that is green in color which helps to reduce the red color of your skin so you don't have to cover up all the time with make up. It would be the best thing out there for you.
jeX5VZAtaa	Omg I love them both, but I would say the 1st one it's so unique.|`|a3QNUrdfaa	the american eagle one is way more summery and cuter. go for that one!|`|QB3dXwsDaa	First one, blue one :D|`|HY5K4Yrraa	I like the 1st one, fun, colourful and unique :)|`|tMGdsPCQaa	I honestly think both are really plain.

The one from Gap.|`|cyFqjkolaa	It is difficult without seeing you to judge.  But style wise I do not like either.  I have never appreciated something fitted under the bustline.  I think it should be more fitted at the waist like a person actually is.    Sorry but honest.    I buy clothes for my wife.  I stand by my opinion.|`|XHvaws8baa	i like the american eagle one better|`|XUN0OUIJaa	Well. It depends because those long dresses dont look that good on short people, so you'd probably need to be tall with long legs. If you are then the first one, the second one is too plain.|`|JkhB79V2aa	Hey,  I would say the gap one. B/c it is plainer and more versatile. You can also wear it longer b/c it won't go out of style quite as quick.

Go to the mall with a bunch of friends and spend the day trying on clothes, put on fashion shows and ask random people what they think! its great fun and you'll become closer with your friends! plus your friend will help you find a Fabulous dress!

hgIXUwE2aa	It feels exactly the same as when you have your ears pierced in the normal place. To begin with it hurts to sleep on it, but thats what you expect from any piercing.  I'd say go for it cos it'll look great and you'll be really pleased when you've got it  :)|`|vexUqMGpaa	Hi i had mine done a few years ago, it doesnt hurt to have it done BUT i no longer wear an ear ring in it because its just so uncomfortable to sleep on. So for me it was a waste of time.|`|9Ycuoysjaa	It will hurt while having it done and after for a while. But everyone is different to pain so you maybe ok, just depends what your pain tolerance is like hun.|`|peEgWlTDaa	Mine really hurt and the crunch noise made me feel very queasy but it was done with a gun, they're much better when done with a needle. As long as you go to a reputable piercer and keep the area clean you shouldn't get infected.|`|yfMmr7uGaa	I had like half way up my ear pierced in two places ( in the cartilage so it's the same as the top of the ear)  It hurt like proper loads in the cold  But wasn't too bad inside unless it was touched  It hurts to touch it or lie on it and really hurts if you catch it  Mine also got infected because I was kinda allergic to the type of piercing they originally put in my ear and it hurt the same amount as when it was first done  You can get like wound wash spray and tcp is also good for getting rid of infections.    Sorry if it scares you   But i'm not gonna lie and say it doesn't hurt  Because it really does|`|tV57ENwHaa	Okay it does hurt even when you sleep on it. I would highly suggest not to get that, the reason is if it gets infect, and i guarantee it will, everyone I know with one their ear got infected. Trust me if it gets infected there is a big bump on the back of your ear, and you'll have to get it surgically removed. Trust me it's painful. Oh and you have to get stitches.  I hope you know that, that's why you should NOT get it!|`|NV43ZXoMaa	It Doesn't Hurt At All You Should Be Fine! =] When You Sleep On It, It Should be Fine But DON'T Take The Stud Out Untill After 6 Weeks Of It Will Hurt Like Hell. . .

8cde047a2197080a0f253d0aeebe83d1aa	It could be either way, depending on the person.  When it comes to foot fetishes there are tons of niches.  Some people want to see them small, some big, some dirty, some clean, etc.  I'd say that foot guys do tend to be more specific in their tastes than breast guys, but that's just a personal observation that may or may not be valid.  In all my time observing the community, I really have yet to see a guy say "I'll take anything as long as it's a foot," but I'm sure those guys are out there too.    I do not have an unusual amount of punctuation, screw you, Yahoo -.-|`|yo0qnedIaa	I only like girls feet that are narrow.

If a moisturizer is not for oily skin or too rich it will actually aggravate the sebum to produce more oil .. For an instant oil zapper .. I will usually use the facial oil blotter esp by clear and clear and its amazing ! My trusted permanent companion in my purse ...

I would have extremely oily face,it was really bad.  Then i found this 3 step system by clinique. The whole system helps control oil and breakouts. It really works, my face changed in seriously 2 days. If you dont want the whole system just get the last step : Clinique dramatically different moisturizing gel, It leaves your skin oil free, and very soft.     Hope this helps :)|`|PcBz0w2Raa	Use cleansing and exfoliating face wash  i use Witch Exfoliating foam. and Witch Cleansing face scrub  and Tea Tree Exfoliating Face Wash  you can get Witch products at Boots and Tea Tree from Superdrug.
