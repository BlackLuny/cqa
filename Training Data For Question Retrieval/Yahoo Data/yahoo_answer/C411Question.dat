20090222162117AA5bi9A	Home & Garden;Do It Yourself (DIY)	I want to learn how to build things from wood!?	I have always had a love for things made out of wood. I recently purchased a bunch of tools for woodworking at an estate sale. I purchased a mitre saw, table saw, scroll saw, circular saw, plunge router, and many hand tools and clamps. There is just one problem!! I don't know how to start!! I have never made anything or even used these type of tools before. What is the best way to start making stuff from wood? I bought a couple of woodworking magazines but I think I must be too dumb because I can't always figure out what there talking about. Maybe I need it explained like it is for a kid or something. Or is it really that hard to be starting from square one to be a woodworker.

20090222163530AAzzRub	Home & Garden;Do It Yourself (DIY)	Mis-wired 3-way switch?	I have a 3-way switch, I just put a new switch off it and branched off it to put an outlet below the switch.  Originally, there were 2 lines coming in, one with 2 conductors (black, white, plus GND), the other with 3 conductors (b/w/red, +GND).   I bound all the whites together.   The blacks I bound the one from the 2-conductor (which I assumed was hot but never tested), the one to the new outlet, and then a little bridge wire out of the cap.   The 3-way switch got wired with the black and red from the 3-conductor and the little bridge wire.   (I did not touch the other 3-way switch or the lighting fixture at all)   Here's what happened when I turned the power back on:    The 3-way switches work exactly right, turning the light on and off from either station.   But the outlet, with the light on, does not work at all.   More confusingly, plugged into the outlet, with the light off, when I turn ON whatever is plugged in, the light comes on dim, and whatever comes on with only partial power.  (I tried plugging in my utility light, and the dremel I cut the hole for the outlet with).      WTF did I do wrong here?

I have three kittens (8 months old) and even though I change their litter box frequently, my apartment has this strange smell. It doesn't smell like litter or cat pee, but the litter box is the only thing I can think of that could be causing any foul odors. I clean probably more than I should, so the only thing in the apartment that doesn't stay completely disinfected is the litter box...the smell is kind of like garbage or something. I don't know what the smell is coming from. Maybe it isn't the litter box, but it didn't smell like that when I moved in.  mean, even my clothes and purse have this smell now. It really bothers me because I'm a very clean person....I have bought candles, odor eliminating air fresheners, carpet cleaners, carpet powders, even a new vacuum trying to get rid of the smell - If anyone has any suggestions, or has had a similar problem, it would be SO appreciated......please please please offer suggestions...
