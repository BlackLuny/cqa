In my opinion, it is the best on the market, although it can be a little expensive.  If this is something you want to do as a career or to make money, I'd highly recommend investing.<br>  <br>  If you are just looking for something basic to play your music, you might try your local yellow pages for a recording studio.  Usually you can book time for thirty to fifty dollars an hour.  Figure on spending about 45 minutes per song.  Usually you have to book a studio a couple of weeks in advance, but they are pretty easy to reserve.  I've recorded this way many times and had good experiences.  When you leave the studio, you will have a CD with your tracks on it.  Load them into your computer and uploading to myspace is pretty easy after that.  I've loaded several of my songs on that way.<br>  <br>  If you are just looking for a very basic way to get some music online, you could use a digital recorder.  The sound quality won't be as good as if you recorded at an actual studio, but if you are just looking to record for fun and not profit, that might be a good way to go.  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|5WM9SIokaa	Umm... well for starters you could record the music.

shVgCizBaa	Operation Valkyrie (Unternehmen Walküre) was an emergency "Continuity-of-Government" operations plan developed for the Territorial Reserve Army of the Germany (Wehrmacht Heer) to execute and implement should; for whatever reason; there come to be a general breakdown in civil order of the nation; caused by the failure of the nominal civilian (Nazi) led government, to maintain control of civil affairs. The plan was approved by German dictator Adolf Hitler, who intended it to be used in the event that physical disruption caused by the Allied bombing of German cities resulted in a breakdown in domestic law and order; or a rising by the millions of forced laborers from occupied countries working in German factories.In an ironic twist of fate, however, the German Resistance—led by members of the Reserve Army and including members of the Kreisau Circle[1]—modified the plan with the intention of using it to take control of German cities, disarm the SS, and arrest the Nazi leadership once Hitler had been assassinated in the July 20 Plot. Hitler's death was required to free German soldiers from their oath of loyalty to him (Reichswehreid). After lengthy preparation, the plot was carried out in 1944.<br>  <br>  Apart from Hitler, only General Friedrich Fromm, commander of the Reserve Army, could put Operation Valkyrie into effect, so he had to be either won over to the conspiracy or in some way neutralized if the plan were to succeed. Fromm, like many senior officers, knew in general about the military conspiracies against Hitler but neither supported them nor reported them to the Gestapo.<br>  <br>  The key role was played by German Army (Wehrmacht Heer) officer Claus von Stauffenberg, who was in charge of German Reserve Army's Walküre, a role which allowed him access to Hitler for reports, and required his presence in the coup—which ruled out another suicide attack as planned earlier by other officers. After the first attempt had to be canceled and declared an "exercise", Stauffenberg placed the bomb on July 20 and hurried back to Berlin to assume his pivotal role.<br>  <br>  Fromm ordered the executions of General Olbricht, his chief of staff Colonel Albrecht Ritter Mertz von Quirnheim, Colonel von Stauffenberg, and his adjutant Lieutenant Werner von Haeften. Shortly after midnight, the condemned men were led to a mound of earth back lit by idle vehicles where each was executed by firing squad in the courtyard of Bendlerstrasse headquarters<br>  <br>  <br>  The "plan" as implemented by the attempted assassins of Hitler was an attempt to “trick” the Territorial Reserve Army of the Third Reich into the seizure and removal of the civilian National Socialist (Nazi) government of wartime Germany; under the false pretense that, the said same civilian government had attempted a coup d’état; that included the assassination of Adolf Hitler. The key variable being that the rank-and-file soldiers and junior officers who were supposed to execute this plan, would be motivated to do so based upon the false belief that it was the Nazi leadership who had behaved with disloyalty and treason against the state and were required to be removed.<br>  <br>  Improvement for 1944<br>  Henning von Tresckow and Claus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg recognized the weaknesses of the plan regarding a plot. From 1943 on, they altered the plan in order to capture leaders of SS, SD, Gestapo, and the Nazi Party. Stauffenberg later used this revision in his plot in the assassination attempt on Hitler.<br>  Epitaph<br>  With respect to the whole purpose of the coup, which nominally was to achieve the cessation of military hostilities (at least between Germany and the Western Allies); the Coup’s leaders would have been torn to pieces by the German people because the German people would never have believed (unlike the far more naive plotters) that the Allies or the Soviet Union were interested in anything other than the unconditional surrender of Germany. And that by 1944 the terms of such an unconditional surrender would not be lessened by the removal of Hitler or his party.<br>  <br>  Lastly, at the time of the assassination attempt in 1944 the majority of the German people believed that given the desperate nature of the conflict, in both the east and the west that only the resolute Hitler offered any hope of forcing the Allies to even consider dealing with Germany on any terms other than unconditional surrender. The German people at some fundamental level understood that only an individual (Hitler) whose head was more at risk than all of Germany, would be motivated to lead and fight-on to the last to preserve the German state.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Walk%C3%BCre" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_W...</a>|`|ikCAdxBjaa	cahrle K that is so geeky that you realed that all of!<br>  <br>  Hitler was a dictator of germany and was the head of the Third Reich that meant being on top with every body underneith you who served you.

uRqm4Bxcaa	Ever heard of political science?  Of course you have.  Well, there really isn't that much randomness to political decisions like you'd think.  Most (if not all) decisions made in politics are made with the idea of maintaining the favor of the voters.  So if the president could do the right thing but it would alienate his constituency, he wouldn't do it.  Such is democracy...|`|AA11209233	Scientists don't make decisions, they observe facts and make conclusions based on those facts.<br>  <br>  Politicians don't always have facts to base a conclusion on, and are forced by pragmatism to infer the facts they are missing to the best of their ability.  Scientists will usually tell you how confident they are in their facts to a few decimal places.  Politicians will always act confident in their facts and assumed facts, and will only tell you the degree of their confidence when you challenge them on facts.  <br>  <br>  In addition, a politician's job is different from a scientist's--it is more like an engineer's job.  Politicians aren't trying to find facts, they are trying to figure out what to do about them.

fDOSnGpwaa	Slaves did NOT build the pyramids. It was farmers in off season to make extra money.|`|bxlYleZkaa	If you look at the history of "Pyramid" building in Egypt, as opposed to that in other parts of the world, you will see there are the remains of several experimental models which either failed because of design faults or the impossibilities of actually completing. The three "Great" pyramids, which everyone know, are actually the end of a long line of experimentation.           I think it doubtful that slave labour could have been used exclusively, given that the majority of the work could proceed only during the fertile period of the Nile floods. Just as on construction sites today, a few people have a lot of knowledge but the majority have only sufficient to be able to carry out their own specific job.   <br>  Regarding Stonehenge, the alleged construction date of which preceded that of the pyramids, again works on the site took place over several hundreds of years, if not millennia. The mystery here is though, that there appear to be no earlier or experimental models Because, with the remote possibility of Arbor Low, no other stone circle incorporates horizontal lintels. At Arbor Low the presence of said lintels is purely conjectural.|`|CrgcaGMKaa	I don't know the answer, I can however add to your point. Beneath the Western Wall in Jerusalem there is a single stone that is 13.5 meters long, between 3.5 and 4.5 meters thick and weighs approximately 570 tons!<br>  The Western Stone, as it is known, is heavier than any single stone built into the Egyptian pyramids. Although it was originally thought to be the heaviest single object ever lifted by human beings without powered machinery, that record seems to be held by the Thunder Stone in Saint Petersburg.|`|HtKKcq98aa	the notion that slaves constructed the pymaids is false. It's a holiwood notion.  They were paid to work the pymids and most of the pople who worked at the pyrmid lived at the site.<br>  As far as who bulit and designed them you'll get a varity of answers anywhere from lost civlzazations such as antlantis to aliens and basicly everything short of actully giving the egyptians credit for what they did.<br>  <br>  It's still a mystery today but Imhotep seems to come to mind for who designed them? But i could be wrong|`|DXXpHKupaa	Let me clear up a common misconception.<br>  <br>  Slaves were prohibitively expensive in Ancient Egypt, and getting over 100,000 of them to work for 20 years on a Pyramid was the furthest thing from efficient you could imagine.<br>  <br>  In actuality, the Egyptians paid farmers to work on the Pyramids-and entire villages have been unearthed around Giza as proof to this.<br>  <br>  As to how they were made, this is still a mystery.<br>  <br>  A predominant theory is that a giant ramp of earth was made to spiral around the pyramid.<br>  <br>  A similar theory is that a single, giant ramp was made that ran perpendicular to the Pyramid, and got larger as the Pyramid neared it's completion.<br>  <br>  My favorite theory though is relatively new.  It involves spiral passages WITHIN the pyramid itself.<br>  <br>  As far as the design goes, this is also a mystery.  It is commonly believed that the Pyramid represented the sun's rays coming down to Earth.<br>  <br>  Another theory (which is based on a fallacy) is that the Pyramid formed a type of staircase in which the Pharaoh would rise to the Heavens.  However, the Pyramids were smooth upon completion-not much of a stair case if you ask me...except for the first (known) pyramid of the Pharaoh Djoser, built in Saqqara.  However the Step Pyramid was likely just the idea of stacking increasingly smaller Mastaba (small, rectangular tombs for Pharaohs pre-dating the Pyramids).<br>  <br>  A Mastaba-<br>  <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ab/Mastaba-faraoun-3.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/co...</a><br>  <br>  The Step Pyramid of Djoser-<br>  <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/80/Saqqara_Pyramid_Djoser.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/co...</a><br>  <br>  You'll find people claiming that Aliens built the Pyramids-likely they will answer this question too.  This is based on no evidence other than that we don't understand how they were truly built.  If you look at Pyramids from the (known) beginning of Djoser's step pyramid, you see the Bent Pyramid of Sneferu, an insight to the development of a "True Pyramid".<br>  <br>  The Bent Pyramid-<br>  <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ca/Bent_Pyramid_(I_love_Naples).jpg" rel="nofollow">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/co...</a><br>  <br>  There is still a debate about whether this was done because they did not yet understand how to make it study enough at it's original angle (55 degrees), or that Sneferu was dying and to save time, the angle was changed (43 degrees) to finish the tomb on time.<br>  <br>  However, a latter pyramid made by Sneferu lends to the first theory that the process was still not entirely understood and that they learned a proper angle to create a "true Pyramid" from when they made the Red Pyramid, which is made at 43 degrees.<br>  <br>  The Red Pyramid-<br>  <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/82/Snofru%27s_Red_Pyramid_in_Dahshur_(2).jpg" rel="nofollow">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en...</a><br>  <br>  This goes to show that the process was not entirely understood during Djoser's time and was perfected by the time of Khufu, the maker of the Great Pyramid-the Seventh wonder of the world (and the only one remaining today).<br>  <br>  The Great Pyramid-<br>  <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e3/Kheops-Pyramid.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/co...</a><br>  <br>  Well, as far as the Stonehenge is concerned, that one baffles us even more than the Pyramids.<br>  <br>  But my forte is in Egyptian history, not European, I'm afraid...|`|VG4yYvrsaa	Same place as those that built Stonehenge, empirical discovery, simple mathematical truths.<br>  <br>  like your answer Vicky S,  however one detail, there is an earlier model for the Stonehenge lintels, we just don't know how much earlier. The re-used bluestones of the later bluestone circle incorporated two former lintels, and some of the 'bluestone horseshoe' stones had tenons on top. Now it's possible that  these came from a monument that wasn't even constructed on the site of Stonehenge (the early Q and R hole spacing would not accommodate them as trilithons).  <br>  <br>  I wonder where that castle of yours is.....?

These indigenous peoples of North America speak a Southern Athabaskan (Apachean) language, and are related linguistically to the languages of Athabaskan speakers of Alaska and western Canada. The modern term Apache excludes the related Navajo people. However, the Navajo and the other Apache groups are clearly related through culture and language and thus are considered Apachean. Apachean peoples formerly ranged over eastern Arizona, northwestern Mexico, New Mexico, and parts of Texas and the Great Plains. There was little political unity among the Apachean groups. The groups spoke seven different languages. The current division of Apachean groups includes the Navajo, Western Apache, Chiricahua, Mescalero, Jicarilla, Lipan, and Plains Apache (formerly Kiowa-Apache). Apache groups are now in Oklahoma and Texas and on reservations in Arizona and New Mexico.

shVgCizBaa	did the soviet union have the right to feel threatened about the truman doctrine and the marshall plan?<br>  why? It prevented the spread of communism in  Greece and Turkey so the Soviet Union did not like it.-------------------------------<br>  The Truman Doctrine is a set of principles of U.S. foreign policy declared by President Harry S. Truman in an address to Congress to request $400 million in aid to Greece and Turkey, as well as authorization to send American economic and military advisers to the two countries. Truman argued that the U.S. should support Greece and Turkey economically and militarily to prevent their falling under Soviet control. He supported this request by proclaiming: "One of the primary objectives of the foreign policy of the United States is the creation of conditions in which we and other nations will be able to work out a way of life free from coercion. This was a fundamental issue in the war with Germany and Japan. Our victory was won over countries which sought to impose their will, and their way of life, upon other nations." He called upon the U.S. to "support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures,"[1] which generalized his hopes for Greece and Turkey into a doctrine applicable throughout the world. The Soviet Union was clearly at the heart of Truman's thoughts, but the nation was never directly mentioned in his speech. As Edler states, Truman was attempting to solve Eastern Europe's instability while making sure the spread of communism would not affect nations like Greece and Turkey.<br>  <br>  The Truman Doctrine represented the hard side of containment policy, while the Marshall Plan constituted the soft side. The declaration of the Truman Doctrine was followed by the end of tripartism (coalition governments that included communists).<br>  Harry S Truman, who was supported by Senator Arthur H. Vandenberg and the Republican-controlled Congress, promulgated this doctrine after a visit from the Greek Prime Minister. “At the urging of the United Kingdom, Prime Minister Tsaldaris of Greece visited Washington in December 1946 to plead for additional American assistance.”[2] Aid was agreed by the United States government to be given to both Greece, and Turkey. It was an early response to a perceived political involvement by the Soviet Union in Europe and Asia, as suggested by the Communist movements in Turkey and Greece.<br>  <br>  The United States gave aid to Greece and Turkey for both political and military reasons. The political reasons the United States gave aid to Turkey and Greece were because they were still holding off the Communist threat, and could still be saved from communism. The situation was very important for the west, “If Greece was lost, Turkey would become an untenable outpost in a sea of communism. Similarly, if Turkey yielded to Soviet demands, the position of Greece would be extremely endangered[3].” It was a regional domino effect threat that guided the United States' decision. The military aspect of losing Greece and Turkey was also a huge factor. The United States was cautious of a third World War at this time, and needed military advantages over the Soviet Union if they were to win. Greece and Turkey turned out to be very important, “The failure of the West to prevent a communist takeover in Greece would not only put the Russians on a particularly dangerous flank for the Turks, but strengthen the Soviet Union’s ability to cut off allied supplies and assistance in the event of war."[4] With both the political and military benefits of assisting Turkey and Greece, the United States felt compelled to pass the Truman Doctrine.<br>  <br>  The Truman Doctrine was the first in a series of containment moves by the United States, followed by economic restoration of Western Europe through the Marshall Plan and military containment by the creation of NATO in 1949. In Truman's words, it became "the policy of the United States to support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures." Using a framing rhetoric that continues to have resonance today, Truman reasoned that because these "totalitarian regimes" coerced "free peoples," they represented a threat to international peace and the national security of the United States.<br>  <br>  President Truman made the proclamation in an address to the U.S. Congress on March 12, 1947, amid the crisis of the Greek Civil War (1946-1949). Truman insisted that if Greece and Turkey did not receive the aid that they needed, they would inevitably fall to Communism with consequences throughout the region.<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truman_Doctrine" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truman_Doct...</a>|`|nkZMhmRnaa	<a href="http://yourinfo.h-o-s-t.name" rel="nofollow">http://yourinfo.h-o-s-t.name</a><br>  A very informative website you can also get much information in website|`|AA11907123	Well those are two different things but yes, the SU had "the right" to *feel* however it wanted.<br>  <br>  Especially after Western intervention in the Russian Civil War.|`|uJhrqJCDaa	"did the soviet union have the right to feel threatened about the truman doctrine and the marshall plan?"<br>  <br>  The Soviet Union was a sovereign nation.

03k5qduQaa	We use our fears, hold onto them as comfort blankets, and sometimes they cling onto our souls, holding captive in a closeted way, you are right. Our fears, what we dread govern subconsciously our thoughts, our will, our actions. We either grow out of them or we confront them and are able to shed them in this way, or we mature, gain understanding as to why we fear. There is always a cause, a reason for each fear.<br>  <br>  Many reasons why we hold on to the devils we know than be released for unknown demons we have yet to encounter.

n71t0xoCaa	A seperate incideny or flash meter is not necessary but there are times where it helps to get a better exposure. One as mentioned is with studio flash set ups. for landscape reflected light meters in the camera are not bad but they are built around neutral grey so in photos that are higher or lower key they can often get fooled. So there are times when you are better going with the reflected light meter in the camera. Sometimes when the handheld meter works best, sometimes when you should use the sunny 16 rule and many many timnes for landscape when you should bracket. Afterall the landscape is not running off on you<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.luminous-landscape.com/tutorials/understanding-series/understandexposure.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.luminous-landscape.com/tutori...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.weatherscapes.com/techniques.php?cat=general&page=metering" rel="nofollow">http://www.weatherscapes.com/techniques....</a>|`|vkzkXWfzaa	If you use a grey card you can take spot meter readings off that using you cameras in built system and get an incident light reading.<br>  <br>  To use them just place the card in shot at an angle to the light similar to your subject. As they are 18% grey they reflect light of a centered  grey reading which is exactly what the invercone does on an incident light meter, and you haven't got to be in Manual Mode to use it.<br>  <br>  As a bonus they can also sort out white balance.<br>  <br>  All in all a much cheaper and more useful option than a meter, easier to carry round too.<br>  <br>  This is the one I use, but there are others too.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.digigrey.com/en_index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.digigrey.com/en_index.html</a><br>  <br>  Chris|`|AA11119636	it's not necessary for landscapes<br>  especially not required for class<br>  it'll easier but you can achieve the same result using a built-in meter <br>  in the camera...as long as you know where to meter and get the right light/shade you want|`|2CdBWZLIaa	Every camera has one built in. If you choose to shut off the meter in your camera, then you will either have to guess the exposure -- problematical with the limited dynamic range of digital sensors -- or use an external light meter. <br>  <br>  The camera meter "guesses" that everything is a neutral 18% gray. If you take a shot of an all black scene, the camera will try to set the exposure so that the black turns out gray. It will try to make white gray. Experienced photographers are aware of this and will adjust their exposure or use manual mode. Or they might use an external spot meter to get the right exposure on a specific spot, or an incident light meter that measures the light striking the subject. The benefit here is that it will not mess up the blacks and whites.|`|LQG4yI6uaa	A light meter will do one thing that your in-camera meter can't - ambient light readings. Also, light meters can allow you to test your flash setup if using a studio flash system. Both of these things can be critical, depending on what type of work you are doing. I find my light meter to be indispensable.|`|vqGRoZ9iaa	Often, the in-camera meter will suffice.<br>  <br>  Just remember to bracket your exposures (take the exposure you think it should be, then take a couple with your camera settings slightly on either side of that exposure, by adding and subtracting from the shutter speed or changing the aperture). Then you have better odds at getting the right exposure.<br>  <br>  For landscape work, a hand-held meter will work if you are standing in the same lighting conditions as your subject. If you are taking a picture of a sunny mountain in the distance, and it is cloudy where you are, a hand-held meter will not work. You will want to meter the mountain with the in-camera meter.<br>  If you want to meter, say, a flower or some object you are near to, I would use a hand-held meter.<br>  <br>  Snowy conditions are notorious for confusing in-camera meters. I always use a hand-held for snow photos and bracket a lot.<br>  <br>  You also don't have to spend loads on a fancy digital meter if you are just starting out. The old-fashioned ones with the moving needle work fine, and can be found at pawn shops or online for cheap.<br>  <br>  Good luck!
fa030cbb4d523cc426cc52a20d628143aa	The only ever so slightly positive issue about segregation I can think of is education. The segregate school systems did produce a surprisingly high degree of very highly educated graduates. <br>  Black school were staffed by a very motivated and dedicated teaching staff. There objective was to be better than their white counterparts and produce a higher degree of education than their racial counterparts. This I do believe was better, despite the very unequal funding differences between the dual systems. I think that presently the race issue in the public schools of today detract from the level of education that is received. The present public school system has fallen from what it once was, they seem to be focused upon everything but rendering a solid education. Busing, enthic diveristy, cultural promotion, gay day.etc<br>  <br>  Which is why we are importing much of our skilled labor from outside the US. our systems does not produce enough engineers, doctors, scientist, etc.|`|AA11712689	I'd say that the ONLY "positive" result from segregation was that African Americans that weren't around Whites as much were LESS ABUSED by Whites as much.<br>  <br>  However, the segregation itself was a form of abuse.

Why complain about a system if you don't suffer from its effects?<br>  So there ya go Forrest. Great cavalry command, btw.

If you go far enough back in history, one would find that people considered to be "white" are really a mixture of different ethnicities.  People known as "Germans" were from different parts of Europe, but eventually cohabited in the same land and became known as one ethnicity.  The same is true for the Russians.  They were once separate groups that had nothing to do with each other until they intermixed.  What is now China was once dozens of different cultures, races and societies, but eventually they merged into one society. This trend will likely continue, despite the conflicts that occur over time.  Although there is resistance to this phenomenon, it is largely futile. One could not stop this no more than they could stop the tectonic plates from shifting.  Even war has historically only resulted in more blending of the different tribal groups as people are displaced and regional boundaries shift.|`|HLqzrBNmaa	Well the ethnicities did not clash which had some common sense advantages i.e. there was less racial clashing as racist people didn't have to coincide with another race.
y0HeCXd2aa	Be careful about exposing your work for review online. One of the things you should consider is, How successful at writing are the people who are critiquing your work? Are they published writers? Exposing your work online can lead to someone stealing your ideas or stories.<br>  My very best advice for a beginner who needs feedback is to find a mentor who would be willing to critique your work.  You might have to pay them. Or, start a writing group with 3 or 4 (no more than 4) writers in your area. Meeting twice a month is enough to keep your momentum going. However, these groups do not always work out and some writers wouldn't touch one with  someone else's ten foot pole but it might be something you want to try. Although, if you NEED other people to keep you going you may not be cut out to be a writer. It is a seriously lonely profession. A mentor is your best bet, maybe a local author whose work you admire, someone who lives in your area. Read magazines about your region and see who's writing those articles.<br>  I am not trying to discourage you by asking you these questions but they are things you seriously need to think about:<br>  Do you want to be a writer or do you want to write?  There's a big difference. If you want to write that means nothing, but nothing can stop you from writing, not criticism, nor ridicule, nor being broke. Don't let any negative, critical feedback stop you. Don't listen to anyone who is negative and critical, not a teacher, or college professor, or even an editor. You should find an encouraging mentor, someone who will critique your work, not criticize it.<br>  If you just want to be a writer that means that you like the idea of being famous someday, making lots of "easy" money. First, fame is incredibly hard to come by and there is no such thing as "easy" money in the writing business. People who appear to be an "overnight" success usually have been writing for 10 to 20 years before they hit it big.<br>  Pay attention to what successful people like Dean Koontz, Stephen King, Janet Evanovich, John Grisham, Ray Bradbury, Sue Grafton, John Truby and other successful writers teach about writing. Get on YouTube and put anyone of those names in the search box and watch interviews with them.<br>  The best two books on writing I can recommend to you (and I own quite a few) are John Truby's The Anatomy of Story: 22 Steps to Becoming a Master Storyteller.  John Truby is a Hollywood screenwriter you can learn how to write a novel if you follow his plan.<br>  The second book is:  The Modern Library Writer's Workshop by Stephen Koch. You might have to ask your bookstore to special order these books but they are worth it. Or, ask your library to get them from inter-library loan for you then you can see them before you order them from your bookstore.  Do not let anyone discourage you from writing. Keep writing no matter what, keep reading no matter what. That's what real writers do. Persevere, if it were easy everyone would be doing it.<br>  I'd say good luck but luck has nothing to do with it, it's all up to you.

e30a9e9e5716e986b609ef9728d116ccaa	Frate, scrie ce-ti place si ce stii tu mai bine. Esti inca mic, incearca o poveste ceva.. nu cred ca la varsta asta ti-ai gasit deja un stil, si un roman este foarte greu de scris, necesita multa munca. Dar incearca, nu te da batut. vezi, la inceput nu as fi crezut nici eu, dar de la parinti poti afla multe. ei au citit si vad dincolo de poveste.;) hai succes<br>  EDIT: guys, he was just asking for concepts, beliefs.. stuff like that. there is a diffrence between stealing someone's idea and being interesed in your possible future public. you should think again before confronting a 12 y.o. guy who is interesed in literature. Don't scare him off, he's no Twilight fan:))<br>  EDIT2: good preteen writers? what did they write? Twilight fan fiction? i'm sorry to come-back but writing has nothing to do with maturity. He is just young, not mature enough to know these things. He didn't ask you for a plot. you can see from his message that he just wants to know where to start from.. ''12 year old writer'' again shows that he is just young and aspiring, don't take it literally. you are so wrong to be like that to a kid. he'll grow up and understand. he's probably new to the internet, and literature.<br>  EDIT3:(in case you check it out): yeah i realize i kinda made the wrong impression by criticising them, but it's obvious that young writers(below the age of 14) are not mature enoguh to understand writing as it is, and may create stories, but not literature. Of course i support young writers and 18 is not the youngest age to publish actually, but in this case, the guy is too young to understand. He just needs help and that's what we need to do, we need to encourage the young talented readers to become writers(if they got the talent), not scare them off. Many writers receive critics or bad comments, but some are just too young to take it. I just didn't want this guy to be scared off so easily. Anyway, thanks for coming back, you do have a point, and it was a nice 'conversation'. i'll see you around Q&A.|`|hGVkInSnaa	If you want to be a writer come up with your own plots!|`|4vbovQKJaa	For the love of god, do your own work.  And stop asking people to give you stories to write.  If you want to write them, you have to create them yourself.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Sorry, Siren, but I have to disagree.  A writer who is uninspired and unmotivated, is no writer at all.  I've been creating stories since I could form sentences, and when I learned to write, I put them on paper.  Adding the "I'm only 12" line is no excuse, as I've read some quality work from teenagers (although they may not be as developed as an older writer).  Asking someone else for story ideas is just pure and plain laziness and lack of creativity.<br>  <br>  EDIT for Siren:  In one breath you support the young writers, and then you criticize them by saying they don't have anything good to write, other then Twilight Fan Fic.  Your way off base.  By the way, Edgar Alan Poe published his first work at the age of 18.  You've either got the talent, or you don't - age doesn't matter.
7APv8E6Taa	I would pick a couple of books and see how they changed not just an individuals life but society. Do you have to stay specifically with fantasy or can you do sci-fi as well? <br>  <br>  If just fantasy look at the evolution of Lord of the Rings: writing take took decades, creating a whole new language, making the movie and the jobs it created in 18 months of shooting. <br>  <br>  If you can do sci-fi I would look at Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 and how burning books after that book came out became just plain wrong even the guidlines for banning a book changed.  Also Ursula K Le Guinn's Lathe of Heaven makes you think about reality. Mary Pearson's Adoration of Jenna Fox looks at medical issues. There is also the old stand-by and anything written by Heinlen.|`|hhWDHmfyaa	1984, Animal Farm, Brave New World<br>  <br>  Fantasy Novels allow us to test out, or extrapolate, or take to the extreme current waves in our societies and governments.  <br>  <br>  We did not have to live with Big Brother for Big Brother to have a huge impact on our world. <br>  <br>  Fantasy Novels are the test case without the negative consequence.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|w7USF5wDaa	I usually don't answer homework questions but I've gotten stuck on a thesis for a paper before and sometimes somebody even making a suggestion I disagree with ended up helping, so I'll give you a hand.  Besides, you still have all the work of writing the darn thing.  Here's one I came up with off the top of my head, feel free to change it however you like.  I didn't know what aspect of fantasy you'd be looking at so I just used the topic of race and discrimination as an example.<br>  <br>  Fantasy novels play a major role in promoting life changes in their readers.  Because the setting and characters are often so different from those of the everyday world, the reader is more open to discussion of  topics that are unapproachable in other contexts, such as discussions of discrimination and race.  Because of this openness, the reader is more easily able to suspend judgement and assimilate new viewpoints and this is the very essence of change.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.  Cheers.|`|lqD3rVfDaa	Think of your imagination as a muscle.  Exercising a muscle makes it stronger so you can use it for harder tasks.<br>  <br>  Exercising your imagination stretches it out and opens it up to  more things that might otherwise be inconceivable.<br>  <br>  Reading any story makes your imagination work as you take in the main characters and their interactions.  But in normal fiction you don't have to use your imagination very much to appreciate the setting, and what the characters do for a living, etc.  Tom is a carpenter and you already sort of know what he does.  Mary is a receptionist, and you know about that.<br>  <br>  In fantasy, Tom might be a farm boy chosen to go on a secret quest, in strange lands, among many races of people and halflings.<br>  <br>  Now your imagination has to work overtime.  <br>  <br>  Mary might be a princess.  Well you can kind of get a handle on that.  You've read stuff about Princess Di, right?<br>  <br>  How about if she is a princess hidden among the common folk to protect her from enemies.  What is she like? How does she conceal her origins?  What if she's an Elfen Princess.  Captive in a cave.  Under a sleeping spell, and so on.<br>  <br>  Working your mind around that sort of thing gives your imagination a  lot of work. and thus makes it stronger and more flexible, no? <br>  <br>  That can change your life.|`|jEhIDpsdaa	Fantasy books allow you to go to another world in which things that are impossible in this world become quite possible in the world of fantasy. They allow you to connect with dragons and unicorns (or other mythical creatures while sitting at home. They allow you to do things that we have only dreamed of and they keep dreams like that alive. In short Fantasy books keep us dreaming for and creating a better world.

Stop comparing yourself to unusual porn stars.<br>  <br>  So your ugly?  Why do you say this are you comparing yourself to others again, perhaps those on TV?  This is not a fact only a judgement by you when you are in such a negative place. Develope your personality laugh a lot and you will appear far more attractive and confident.

Start to plan towards what is most meaningful in your life, and it doesn't have to be a big car or the showy material accumulations, but FOLLOW YOUR DREAM.<br>  <br>  By concentrating on what you need to do for your own benefit and your future, you'll gradually step aside from constant reaction to people and events.

Concerned by the lack of communication between the races and wondering what "adjustments and discriminations" he would face as a ***** in the Deep South, the late author, a journalist and self-described "specialist in race issues," left behind his privileged life as a Southern white man to step into the body of a stranger. In 1959, Griffin headed to New Orleans, darkened his skin and immersed himself in black society, then traveled to several states until he could no longer stand the racism, segregation and degrading living conditions. Griffin imparts the hopelessness and despair he felt while executing his social experiment,"|`|1L5Uq3voaa	Black Like Me.|`|s7pqFa1eaa	I cannot remember the authors name, but the book title is "Black Like Me". It was written by a white journalist who traveled the southern United States in the mid 60's.|`|UY2MJtfGaa	I think the title is "Black Like Me."  Good book.  I read it many, many years ago.|`|b05fe691e5ceb5cc16ca919cd11e5eccaa	I would also like to know the name of this book. It sounds like an interesting read. Sorry I don't know the name obviously lol..
3IVqoH16aa	I think that at the core of cynicism there is anger and mistrust.  Behind anger and mistrust is someone who's been hurt deeply.  The cynic is closed off and afraid.  The cynicism justifies being closed off and afraid.<br>  So probably, the more romantic the person the more they hope to get out of a relationship, the more intensely they go at it.  And the more potential for deep hurt.  So to protect themselves from further hurt, they convince themselves that all men/women are bad or mean. <br>  Also, I think there is a type of romantic that spends much time daydreaming about ideal love.  Perhaps the woman who's really into romance novels, or the nice guys who are waiting for the woman who'll never take advantage of their niceness.  These people, in addition to already having daddy/mommy issues, are going to be endlessly disappointed when every romantic partner they meet fails to measure up to their high expectations.  Not realizing/accepting that there are some holes in their heart that can't be filled with sex or romance, unable to see the true source of their anger and hurt, their pain and frustration turns to cynicism.<br>  But, like I said, I think this is a certain type of romantic.  I wouldn't put all romance or romantics in this category.  Romance can certainly be a wonderful thing.|`|tBXn97NNaa	I think that's probably true, because romantic people tend to cast their projections on life and are often most devastated when those projections fail to account for things.|`|GBRmOem8aa	No just depressed. I am a romantic and I just get really depressed and hide myself away, throwing away any friends that I have and not letting anyone in until I find another love.|`|gspTDufpaa	You have to keep an open mind about romance in general.<br>  Not every relationship is the same.|`|y8bFwXZEaa	Romanticism with a capital "R" is the absence of cynicism. Since this is about philosophy, I will decline to speculate about romanticism with a lower case "r".|`|FoIxsunVaa	Being a romantic is just a form of being naive. Naivete is a formula for later cynicism.<br>  <br>  Sings: "Mamas, don't let your babies grow up to be sucker!"|`|yOK32PM9aa	I suppose that they might, in that they become disillusioned - they have further to fall, so to speak.  But the reverse might be true - that their romantic tendencies carry them through it, as what predisposed them to be romantic will endure a setback or two.<br>  <br>  It is probably related to mood swings and mild bi-polar disorders.  Some people just seem to naturally oscillate between extremes.  <br>  <br>  And extreme romanticism and extreme cynicism are both good attention-seeking strategies, so we might expect certain types of needy people to try them both out.
12QJ9QMRaa	Gum, in my opinion is still the way to go.<br>  <br>  I have pretty much tried them all, and TBH, I loathe the white vinyl erasers on the market, as I have yet to find one that fully removes, and most of them smudge something fierce.<br>  <br>  The gums can get crumbly too, but usually, but it is to me a small price to pay for adequete erasure.<br>  <br>  Sanford Artgum Eraser<br>  Sanford Design Kneaded Eraser<br>  <br>  are two that I use the most.   <br>  <br>  But, I also, have to admit, I have taken to scanning my pictures and doing a lot of erasing on Microsoft paint, since it is completely smudge free.  <br>  <br>  I do keep a couple tube erasers for easy transport too.<br>  <br>  there may be better ones out there, but I have not found them.|`|GtBOQPKqaa	I've always been partial to "plastic" erasers, such as those made by Pentel and Staedtler-Mars.

iNXqiDIYaa	Yorsh is the last of his kind, an elf child in a world that despises elves. He seeks warmth, food, and shelter but has found only cold, rain, and despair. When he meets two unlikely companionships-humans who help him in spite of their prejudices-Yorsh learns of a prophecy concerning the last dragon and the last elf: when these two break the circle there will be a new beginning. Yorsh is young and nearly helpless, and the two humans, Sajra and Monser, are first taken aback but soon charmed by his na?veté. The trio experience a host of comical misunderstandings that offset the dangerous situations they encounter in the Dark Mountains. Almost by chance, Yorsh stumbles across the dragon, but he finds that fulfilling the prophecy is steeped in complications. The second half of the book, set 13 years later, deals with these challenges. Readers will miss Sajra and Monser just as Yorsh does and will likely guess the identity of the human orphan girl before it is revealed and champion her role in the struggle. The solution to the prophecy is wrenching, but young fantasy fans will appreciate the many humorous touches and get caught up in this tale of strength and sacrifice.—
Tu82rdI7aa	its neat !|`|LIxpXTnLaa	haha that's pretty clever. the rightmost part of the bottom of the shadow seems too dark though.|`|WPh4aAbeaa	It's a good idea and a good product. But I would like it much better if it was less obvious that the shadows of an ACTUAL fork replaced that of the spoon - what I mean is, on the outsides of the black fork shadows there are fainter fork shadows. This makes the idea of the fork-shadowed spoon less realistic, as it immediately brings to mind the idea of "fake" and "intentional" whereas if the faint shadows were not there, the stronger, more defined idea of "spoon with a fork shadow" would immediately evoke ideas of "message" (ie. VS "intentional") and "art" (ie. VS "fake"). <br>  Hopefully I explained properly? It's a small thing, but for me it really changes the idea of the piece.<br>  <br>  Also, the angle of the spoon and/or lighting kind of... squishes the spoon? As in, I feel like a cleaner, more definitive shot of the concave can be made; the one used currently can be viewed as a blob of metallic/chrome substance in some glances.<br>  <br>  Technique-wise, the image is very clean.<br>  <br>  I really do like this picture as a whole, not just concept.

y8bFwXZEaa	1) It's just incidental. Otherwise the "purpose" of technological progress would specifically be to improve the quality of life. While that may be the purpose of the technology, the purpose for creating it rather than burying the idea is to make money.<br>  <br>  2)Non-profits and the government create technology sometimes just for the benefit, but for-profits only do it for the profit. If it isn't profitable it brings down the botom-line.|`|AA10729675	It has not bettered the quality of our lives and it is not incidental either.<br>  <br>  Profit is indeed the main motivator of technological progress and we have to endure the new gadgets and sweat at work to have enough money and then the gadgets change again and again on us.  It never ends and we remain thirsty and dissatisfied.  We have lost the good quality of life.|`|70503caf06f4695beca81e8a95fd439aaa	Profit and improved quality of life are not concepts which are opposed to one another, but exist as corollaries. The link between an individualist-driven market and increased overall human quality of life was first discovered by Adam Smith. He enunciates on this phenomenon in the Wealth of Nations, Volume 1, Chapter 2:<br>  <br>  "But man has almost constant occasion for the help of his brethren, and it is in vain for him to expect it from their benevolence only. He will be more likely to prevail if he can interest their self-love in his favour, and show them that it is for their own advantage to do for him what he requires of them. Whoever offers to another a bargain of any kind, proposes to do this. Give me that which I want, and you shall have this which you want, is the meaning of every such offer; and it is in this manner that we obtain from one another the far greater part of those good offices which we stand in need of. It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker, that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest."<br>  <br>  technological progress occurs when a healthy private market encourages and stimulates entrepreneurism in individuals looking for means of furthering their self interest. That isn't to say that technological progress comes exclusively from the market, but the innovations that affect the most people do. Ancient Greeks made fantastic innovations in the fields of art, mathematics, and philosophy, but such things didn't have any influence on the well beings of their slaves. Renaissance and pre-industrial revolution Europe saw vast technological increases in the fields of science, art, and military matters, but most people lived lives not that dissimilar from urban and rural Egyptians in 2000 BC. <br>  <br>  Things that do affect our daily lives and improve our well being: microwaves, cars, airplanes, washer machines; it was all created by market initiatives. The internet existed as a mere database for university researchers and military personnel until the private market turned it into the revolutionary information and communication hub that it is today. <br>  <br>  Adam Smith called this phenomenon the Invisible Hand; which is the idea that a society composing of individuals pursuing their own self-interest actually act in the overall interest in the society as a whole.|`|tBXn97NNaa	I think actually overall it has been negative, it has destracted us from what's really necessary in life: love|`|xVIok82vaa	Technology is a major feature of of capitalism, as it played a revolutionary role in developing mass production as a result of Industrial Revolution.

AA11635601	I haven't specifically studied Diogenes, but every time I've encountered references to him, it is in the context of his futile search for an honest man.  I never got that he was sniffing people out, not sure what that means, but just that he kept searching for an honest man.|`|1y3y1YvWaa	Diogenes sniffed Alexander the Great behind and fainted afterwards. After being thrown naked inside a bathtub full of clean water (Diogenes was stinking like a dog) as a means of "bringing him to life", he suddenly was confronted with the sight of Alexander's favourite girlfriend, Radiance, that was measuring him from head to toes. <br>  <br>  Diogenes is said to have erected his posture, take a deep breath and say to Alexander, that was protecting Radiance's eyes from such an explicit sight, "Stand out of my Radiance. As you made me faint so she will make me stand and standing I am". <br>  <br>  Alexander is said to have laughed at this and replied, "If I were not Alexander I would not want to be Diogenes, for he has a much smaller sword than I". <br>  <br>  This is a true story.

7ONKVbbiaa	one of my old sayings is that research STARTS when no one is alive to remember. Using oral history (what people tell you) is a great beginning, but there certainly are more records out there. The thing is to shift from what you have (so far) used, into different types. <br>  It sounds that you are in the UK, but some of this may be translatable.<br>  Here, land records exist in the early 1600s, since land grants were far more of value than keeping track of babies/ grandparents. Church records exist to the late 1500s in the UK.. no, didn't say they were easy, nor that all parishes survive.. but they are out there. SOME records might not be on film. If your family did own land, normally there are recorded wills (of course, you have to know which place is the most likely to be searching). <br>  At the OTHER END.. while he may have been born in the 1700s, his death would be recorded. You would also be looking for documents in which he is MENTIONED. He can appear as a witness for a document without the index showing him (indexes show the main characters). <br>  I will agree that it is far more challenging in the era you are talking about. The key thing that I have found..is that the records cease to be the simple ones. This is where you get into the old, old, originals, with the poor handwriting and frayed edges. <br>  Last.. I encourage you to POST HIS NAME and details on here, including wife. There are a number of excellent people who are in the UK, and have more direct experience with what you need.|`|mzRSO802aa	Check land deeds, wills, and church records.  If he was a property owner you'll be able to find a lot of information on him.  For one thing, on a land deed in 1766, they would refer to him as "John Baker, son of Henry, bought 200 acres on Shinning Creek for 100 pounds".   In those days parents had a tendency to pass property to their sons when their sons married and this also would be recorded.|`|uTA2TLC6aa	If you can tell us where you are, and what you've looked at so far, maybe we can think up something new?<br>  <br>  Ok if you have an idea where he was born why not see if the LDS folks can come up with microfilm of the parish records.

Good luck!|`|AA11053540	First of all, if you have gone back to 1766, you have gone back to before records! Yes, local records existed, but consider: The Mayflower is one of the most famous ships to ever sail to the U.S. coast. They don't know for certain what happened to her; they don't know for certain how many people sailed to Plimouth nor their names! And "records" were kept (ships logs, land grants, King's Permission for the following persons to leave Merry Olde England, etc., etc.<br>  So, try my short list:<br>  You should start by asking all your living relatives about family history. Then, armed with that information, you can go to your public library and check to see if it has a genealogy department. Most do nowadays; also, don't forget to check at community colleges, universities, etc. Our public library has both www.ancestry.com and www.heritagequest.com free for anyone to use (no library card required).<br>  Another place to check out is any of the Mormon's Family History Centers. They allow people to search for their family history (and, NO, they don't try to convert you).<br>  A third option is one of the following websites:<br>  <a href="http://www.searchforancestors.com/..." rel="nofollow">http://www.searchforancestors.com/...</a> <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.censusrecords.net/?o_xid=2739..." rel="nofollow">http://www.censusrecords.net/?o_xid=2739...</a> <br>  <br>  www dot usgenweb dot com/ <br>  <br>  www dot census dot gov/ <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.rootsweb.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.rootsweb.com/</a> <br>  <br>  www dot ukgenweb dot com/ <br>  <br>  www dot archives dot gov/ <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.familysearch.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.familysearch.org/</a> <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.accessgenealogy.com/..." rel="nofollow">http://www.accessgenealogy.com/...</a> <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cyndislist.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cyndislist.com/</a> <br>  <br>  www dot geni dot com/<br>  <br>  Cyndi's has the most links to genealogy websites, whether ship's passenger lists, ancestors from Africa, ancestors from the Philippines, where ever and whatever.<br>  <br>  Of course, you may be successful by googling: "john doe, born 1620, plimouth, massachusetts" as an example.<br>  <br>  Good luck and have fun!<br>  <br>  Check out this article on five great free genealogy websites:<br>  <br>  www dot associatedcontent dot com/article...<br>  <br>  Then there is the DNA test; if you decide you want to REALLY know where your ancestors came from opt for the DNA test.

If you are going to be an actor, the education can wait. Academic degrees including those in acting are of no help in being an actor. If you must go to college, major in public relations or advertising as most ot an actor's time is done promoting himself as an actor to agents and casting directors.  It is necessary to earn a living while trying to become an actor and bartenders and waitstaff have flexible hours that make it possible to attend auditions, etc. Having something to fall back on means that is what you will do, because becoming an actor is the most difficult thing you could chose to do.

TjjPm5P1aa	Personally I would suggest reading Vampire Diaries first.  There is more of a plot to them.  Simple Plot summary.. Girl meets vampire.. falls in love...But the vampire unfortunately has a very angry brother.  The brother shows up and does everything in his power to hurt them or steal her away from him.  There romance, action, suspense...<br>  <br>  Vampire kisses is a little simpler plot.  Goth girl loves everything vampire.  She dreams to meet a vampire someday.  New kid moves to town.  Rumors say he is a vampire... Her lucky day! Is he or isn't he.. she tries to find out.. <br>  <br>  Vampire diaries has more drama. Vampire kisses gets better after the first book or two.|`|swigidUeaa	neither, vampire books are gay!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|mtRqlmgoaa	i lost interest in Vampire Kisses lol

uYz8ipcJaa	Hmm I'd say try to develop your own style.  A lot of Americans are trying out anime/manga style these days but they all turn out similar.  The only way to do that is draw a ton and experiment with expression.  Don't simply do things out of a how-to-draw-anime book, or make fanart (unless it's deformed to be your style).  Make your own manga/anime.<br>  <br>  Godfather of Manga and Anime Osamu Tezuka said,<br>  Manga is deformation, simplification and exaggeration.<br>  Manga is when you personalize what you see.<br>  <br>  So in a sense all cartoons are manga and anime.  Don't be caught up in "manga=spikey hair and big shiney eyes and small noses" myth.  Allow manga and anime to be an inspiration, not the source of style.<br>  <br>  It's hard to tell whether somebody's GOOD or NOT if they don't have their own style.  All a person can talk about an artist who hasn't yet developed style is their technique, and people can get real critical about technique.<br>  <br>  So keep drawing!  Don't get discouraged if people say "u suk," and don't get all giddy and happy if people say "ur brilliant."<br>  <br>  Enjoy the process.<br>  <br>  btw.

mlI1YvCnaa	I would say India has the USA beat on that one, their cast system is racially based and has been keeping people in a low or high place based on race for thousands of years.The US has only existed for 200 years, so that statement is simply false, other counties have much longer racist histories.|`|O7w6XGqPaa	He  really should criticize Japan which got started in the racism business in the sixth century AD, long before the USA, which he slanders with his exaggerations.|`|kJyQ3SFHaa	I'm sure this is not the answer you are looking for, but describing racism as a national trait (apart from the obvious joke) is not possible - racism and the hatred of the 'other' (ie anyone/anything not familiar) is part of the human psyche, ingrained as a natural part of our mentality.<br>  <br>  Everyone, including myself, experiences this feeling, although not always in a way that leads to prejudice and bigotry.
2GNFQPdmaa	I don't know that there was a "switch," because fundamentalists have always believed that the bible is pure literal truth, but the scopes trial would have galvanized them. It could be that before the scopes trial many fundamentalists were unaware of the theory of evolution, or unaware that it was making serious headway with scientists and schools. Especially with the way that William Jennings Bryan presented the scopes trial, they woke up to the idea that evolutionary theory was a threat to them. This may be what drove them to make creationism a political cause.|`|0741081782691c4bf15f3f43c93552d6aa	The trial revealed a growing chasm in American Christianity and two ways of finding truth, one "biblical" and one "scientific." Liberals saw a division between educated, tolerant Christians and narrow-minded, tribal, obscurantist Christians. However in totality, the majority of Christians denounced evolution.  Edwards (2000) contradicts the conventional view that in the wake of the Scopes trial a humiliated fundamentalism retreated into the political and cultural background, a viewpoint evidenced in the movie "Inherit the Wind" and the majority of contemporary historical accounts. Rather, the cause of fundamentalism's retreat was the death of its leader, Bryan. Most fundamentalists saw the trial as a victory and not a defeat, but Bryan's death soon after created a leadership void that no other fundamentalist leader could fill. Bryan, unlike the other leaders, brought name recognition, respectability, and the ability to forge a broad-based coalition of fundamentalist and mainline religious groups to argue for the antievolutionist position.<br>  <br>  <br>  The trial escalated the political and legal struggles between strict creationists and evolutionists to influence the extent to which evolution would be taught as science in Arizona and California schools. Before the Dayton trial only the South Carolina, Oklahoma, and Kentucky legislatures had dealt with anti-evolution laws or riders to educational appropriations bills.<br>  <br>  After Scopes was convicted, creationists throughout the United States sought similar antievolution laws for their states.<br>  <br>  By 1927, there were 13 states, both in the North and South, that considered some form of anti-evolution law. At least 41 bills or resolutions were introduced into the state legislatures, with some states facing the issue repeatedly. While most of these efforts were rejected, both Mississippi and Arkansas put anti-evolution laws on the books after the Scopes trial that would outlive the Butler Act.[25] The Butler Act ended up serving as a model for the anti-evolution crusade, and the ACLU could not find a teacher to volunteer for another test case.<br>  <br>  In the Southwest crusaders included ministers R. S. Beal and Aubrey L. Moore in Arizona and members of the Creation Research Society in California. They sought to ban evolution as a topic for study or, at least, relegate it to the status of unproven theory perhaps taught alongside the biblical version of creation. Educators, scientists, and other distinguished laymen favored evolution. This struggle occurred later in the Southwest than elsewhere and persisted through the Sputnik era after 1957, which inspired increased faith in science in general and evolution in particular.[26]<br>  <br>  The opponents of evolution made a transition from the antievolution crusade of the 1920s to the creation science movement of the 1960s. Despite some similarities between these two causes, the creation science movement represented a shift from religious to scientific objections to Darwin's theory. Creation science also differed in terms of popular leadership, rhetorical tone, and sectional focus. It lacked a prestigious leader like Bryan, utilized scientific rather than religious rhetoric, and was a product of California and Michigan instead of the South.<br>  <br>  <br>  The Scopes trial had both short and long term effects in the teaching of science in schools in the United States. Though often upheld as a blow for the fundamentalists in the form of waning public opinion, the victory was not complete. Though the ACLU had taken on the trail as a cause, in the wake of Scopes’ conviction, they were unable to find any volunteers to take on the Butler law and by 1932, the ACLU gave up. The anti-evolutionary legislation was not challenged again until 1965 and in the meantime William Jennings Bryans’ cause was taken up by a number of organizations including the Bryan Bible League, The Defenders of the Christian Faith and The Ku Klux Klan. <br>  <br>  The immediate effects of the trial are evident in the high school biology texts used in the second half of the 1920’s and the early 1930’s. Of the most widely used textbooks, there is only one which lists evolution in the index and in the wake of the trial, under the pressures of fundamentalist groups, the entry is countered with biblical quotations.  The fundamentalist’s target slowly veered off of evolution in the mid 1930. As the anti-evolutionist movement died out, biology textbooks began to include the lost evolutionary theory of Darwin. This also corresponds to the emerging demand that science textbooks be written by scientists rather than educators or education specialists. <br>  <br>  In 1958 the National Defence Education Act was passed with the encouragement of many legislators who feared the United States education system was falling behind that of the Soviet Union. The act yielded textbooks, produced in cooperation with the American Institute of Biological Sciences, which stressed the importance of evolution as the unifying princ|`|hQ95u9OLaa	Creationism is nothing but the first few chapters of Genesis reworded, but the fundamentalists needed a system that they could say was creation studied from a "scientific point of view." Even though they technically won Scopes, he paid something like a dollar fine and went on teaching Evolution. Evolution was here to stay and the fundamentalists are still trying to fight it by putting religion into the classroom.<br>  <br>  The two huge ironies of it all are 1) now that science courses like Evolution have helped pave the way for removal of morality from the classroom, still some sort of morality is needed in the classroom; organizations like the American Civil Liberties Union don't want one moral system taught to the exclusion of all others; and 2) the writer of Genesis never meant those chapters to be taken in a literal sense. Genesis is not a Geology text. It is a record of the Judeo-Christian belief system of God's work with God's people.
bbHoF5jsaa	Maria Theresa (German: Maria Theresia, see also names in other languages; May 13, 1717 – November 29, 1780) was the Archduchess regnant of Austria, Queen regnant of Hungary, Croatia and Bohemia, and a Holy Roman Empress by marriage to Francis of Lorraine. She was technically the last member of the House of Habsburg, succeeded by her son Joseph II of the House of Lorraine, the house itself styled as von Habsburg-Lothringen (of Habsburg-Lorraine).<br>  <br>  Maria Theresa helped initiate financial and educational reforms, promoted commerce and the development of agriculture, and reorganized the army, all of which strengthened Austria's resources. Continued conflict with the Kingdom of Prussia led to the Seven Years War, (1756 - 1763), and later to the War of the Bavarian Succession. She became, formally, dowager empress after the death of her husband Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor in 1765 and shared the direction of the Empire on the accession of her son Joseph as emperor in 1765.<br>  <br>  Maria Theresa criticised many of Joseph's actions but agreed to the First Partition of Poland (1772). A key figure in the power politics of 18th century Europe, Maria Theresa brought unity to the Habsburg Monarchy and was considered one of its most capable rulers. Her 16 children also included Marie Antoinette, queen consort of France, and Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor.|`|VjV7W6qLaa	dunno never met her|`|AA10981067	Which one?<br>  <br>  Maria Theresa of Austria (1717 - 1780)?<br>  Maria Theresa of Austria (1816 - 1867)?<br>  Maria Theresa of Austria (1845 - 1927)?<br>  Maria Theresa of Spain?|`|J9Vmueauaa	Holy saint..<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=At3wnLgrwp7.fMlLd0s52qDsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090227093317AAalW97">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>
AA10062179	OK. I have read it. I would also appreciate if you did me a favour and read and answered mine. <br>  <br>  I'll give you my perspective, as you ask for it. <br>  <br>  First, I do not know whether you realise the inconsistency of calling the same person by 3 different names in each paragraph, throughout the piece. It is not necessarily good. The point of pronoun 'he' is to reduce the number of times you have to use the person's proper name. <br>  Also, when you pick a name, stick to one for your readers. For example, "Harry Potter" is called Harry, Harry Potter, Mr Potter and simply Potter. But for the reader, he is always Harry. <br>  Second, try beginning with more tension. Remember, if your character is dosing off at the beginning because his situation is boring, then the reader will also find the situation boring and dose off. This is not what you are after. <br>  Third, rarely begin with description. When you do, try and be brief and put some action into it.<br>  Fourth, Show don't tell. Basically, you are telling us what Marilyn is like and why Lisle does what he does. This is quite like droning on and on, and is not very slick, but rather patronising. Show your talent in displaying these traits in dialogue and action. Keep description to minimum. <br>  Fifth, check on your spelling. It is "barely" and not "barley". <br>  <br>  I hope you see this as constructive criticism. Keep writing and enjoy it. This is not you trying to be Shakespeare, but you being the best you can be. However, there are a few conventions that help shape your work into a more beautiful image. It is like musical theory. It might be just theory, but there are reasons behind it. <br>  Not any musician who knew the theory could create Beethoven's symphony. Yet only a musician who knew the theory could produce such a musical feat.<br>  <br>  Good luck and here's my question:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090227122208AAN5mAr">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|kiI5dZeGaa	THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST PICES`S OF LITRACHURE I HAVE EVER READ.it is phenomonal i love it the first bit is just so allureing.Who is the man?Why is he just sitting watching tv and eating.but you sort of know the what type of the character the (MAN)is when u read it but then it gets even better.you are brilliant im so puting this on y faveourites so i can read it again!|`|aMGfRum0aa	Too fast, slow down.

D9x1QSgiaa	I recommend to anyone seriously contemplating the purchase of a new digital SLR camera to consider these two primary questions:<br>  <br>  1. How much money do you have to spend???? $500.? $800.? $1,500.?<br>  <br>  2. What level of photography do you aspire to "progress to" in the coming years ? (i.e. basic beginner, intermediate, or professional/business use). <br>  <br>  For most beginners to intermediates I usually suggest one of these two manufacturers: Canon vs Nikon<br>  <br>  1. Canon EOS Rebel model XSi. (Also known as the Canon 450D in Britain) <br>  The "kit" package comes with an 18-55mm zoom lens. The camera has pop-up flash, 12.2 Megapixels, and shutter speeds up to 1/4000th, 100-1,600 ISO sensitivity, 7 autoexposure Scene modes, PLUS Shutter Priority, Aperature Priority and Programmed Exposure Modes and Manual. It also has a 3 inch LCD screen, 3.5 frames continous per second max., 9 point AF system, Live View Functioning and the ability to record photos in 3, 6 or 12 Megapixels PLUS numerous other great features found only on more expensive cameras. Wal-Mart is also selling them now for about $799. Sam's Club also has them for $729.<br>  <br>  I bought one of these 6 months ago and use it as my "back up" camera. I absolutely love it. I have gotten some fantastic photos with it and cannot praise it enough. I routinely enlarge my photos to make 8x10's and 11x14 size enlargements with no noticeable distortion or loss of detail in the pictures. <br>  <br>  2. Nikon D-90: If you prefer to use Nikon equipment I strongly recommend the Nikon D-90 which has 12.3 Megapixels, 3 inch monitor with Live View, 200-3,200 ISO sensitivity, 11 point AF system with Face Priority, 4.5 frames per second in continous mode, 5 advanced Scene modes for auto exposure plus Shutter Priority, Aperature Priority, Programmed Auto plus Manual. The D-90 sells for around $900-950. (Body ONLY. The 18-55mm lens cost an additional $150.-175.) Typically, Nikon equipment is slightly more expensive than Canon equipment, but (having owned both Nikon and Canon cameras), I have seldom noticed BETTER quality results using Nikon equipment. <br>  <br>  You might also consider the Nikon D-40 ($499) kit that comes with the 18-55mm lens. <br>  Another great choice is the Nikon D-60 kit ($649) which also comes with the 18-55mm lens. <br>  <br>  These selections are probably the best choices for any beginner to intermediate skill level, offering the most lenses and other accessories, dealers and places to purchase.<br>  <br>  I strongly recommend that ALL beginners buy a good book on digital photography AND take a class or two from a Vocational school or Community Education Center in your area. <br>  <br>  You can learn more about the technical specifications of each of these two cameras at these websites:<br>  <br>  www.usa.canon.com<br>  www.nikonusa.com<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|3mAgM405aa	If you are really on a budget and want the best quality for the money, check out the P&S Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ28 [with a Leica lense] which has more features than most pro DSLRs that require auxiliary lenses not even equal to the single initial full-range lense that comes with the FZ28.

I am largely self-taught, though in college I took a darkroom black & white course. While I felt I was fairly knowledgeable when I began said course, I came away from it having learned so much more. Such instruction was invaluable.<br>  <br>  If you are truly serious about photography as an avocation, I recommend investing in a good, used 35mm film camera, such as a Nikon, and learning the ropes. Anyone, in my opinion, can pick up a digital camera and snap away, but to get images that veer away from mere snapshots requires stretching yourself to learn more. Sure, this additional material will be technical to an extent, but there also is an artistic component (photography is an interesting hybrid of art, science and technology). By learning all that, between shutter speeds, aperture, depth of field and so on, you'll gain a greater appreciation for what goes into the creation of an image, especially one with a "Wow!" factor.<br>  <br>  Moreover, you'll benefit immensely from learning with a film camera in two ways. Each roll of film has a finite number of exposures, a limitation which is a blessing. Because of this, the photographer has to pay attention to the pictures he takes. Second, because you cannot merely delete poor images, and instead must confront them, they give you the opportunity to critique yourself on a photo that is bad in some way - focus, exposure, etc. - so you learn not to repeat those errors next time. I'm 40 now, and as I've already mentioned, I've been into photography since a young boy. Along the way I've made some errors, but by learning to be critical of myself, I've become a better photographer for it.<br>  <br>  You can see my bias for film, as it's a medium I enjoy. I own two cameras, a trusty Nikon FM2N and a Hasselblad 500C/M. Two different formats, yet the strengths of the one offset the weaknesses in the other. I also own a Nikon P&S (point & shoot) digital camera, bought with specific uses in mind.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry for waxing philosophically, and for so long, but I hope I've helped you in some way.|`|bLfi1wmAaa	Hi, It depends on what your willing to afford, bear in mind that expensive Cameras take expensive photos.<br>  I have been a Photographer a long time and, have tried nearly all of them, if you are thinking of a digital Camera and I presume you are then it is hard for me to suggest one that stands out from the crowd.<br>  <br>  You dont state wether image quality is important.<br>  <br>  I am very hard to please and I can tell you that a Canon G9 does not impress me one little bit, there are to many  reasons to go into here, but one or two of them is, it crams to many pixels on a tiny sensor, and you cannot have a 7.4 to 44.4 zoom (6X) without compromises.<br>  <br>  So if you want to know what I think a Sigma DP1 might be the answer<br>  because it has a fixed 16.6 Lens and a full image sensor but does not have all the bells & whistles of the others, it is very easy to carry even in your pocket, it is not for everyone, but lets you concentrate on the basics composition etc and the image quality is awesome.<br>  I viewed your pics and I think you need to study the basics buy a secondhand Olympus MJU II it has a fixed 35mm lens and go from there.

This was not a preferred method, as the salt from salted meats (the major food preservative of the day) could corrode metals rapidly.  To scour or remove rust, brickdust or ash from a fire was used by making a paste with water and applied with a cloth and wiped free.  The natural abrasives in ash and brickdust would rapidly clean and remove rust from firearms.

The best possible camera is probably a 35mm camera that has full manual settings.  You really want to learn how to set the camera yourself (i.e., you can set f stops and shutter speeds manually), because that's how you learn to make good exposures.  35mm is good because the teacher may want to show you how to develop and print film.  35mm black and white is pretty easy to learn and very satisfying to work with when you can to do it yourself.  Who makes the camera isn't too important.  The lens isn't as important at this stage either.

Much of it was entirely his own–his observations about tortoises, finches, etc. (although in some cases he had help from bird experts, etc. at home, who told him that all those birds, even though they looked drastically different, were still all finches).

That was an ancient concept, a common feature in many myths. Darwin’s great contribution was a mechanism that explains it, natural selection.

Species survive if they meet the criteria set by the environment. (Is man is part of nature)? If you had asked most shepherds for thousands of years if the faster/stronger lion/bear/fox/sheep/guinea pig/ox is more likely to live and if traits are passed on, they would know the answer to both. <br>  <br>  I do give Darwin credit for compiling the work of many and establishing a cohesive theory that contained many insights; exhibiting a type of intellectual courage, and changing the perception of the scientific community for centuries to come. I’m not an expert by any stretch, but what I’ve read of Darwin is a propensity to over reach and a loose sense of logic. Specifically his inight that the God he had worshiped would not create the wasp that planted parasitic eggs in a caterpillar.<br>  <br>  Steve, don’t leave the church, but there is still some conflict between faith and evolution. Was there an Adam? If God created man in His image, was it by writing the genetic code that culminated in mankind? Did he place Adam in a garden 6000 years ago, or is that symbolic? Was there a fall of man? How did Adam fall if he was merely an animal with instincts just the same as all other animals? How did Adam not know how to procreate if he evolved from species that knew? Your acceptance of one possible chain of events supported by evolution raises numerous other questions.<br>  <br>  I’m not saying I know the answer to these questions and maybe answers to these questions don’t provide salvation, but they do implicate the cause of a necessity for salvation and a savior.<br>   <br>  Jack February 15th, 2009 at 19:53 | #7 Reply | Quote I wonder if there’ll be as much hoopla over Einstein or other notable scientists when their bicentennials roll around.

His father was an Anglican priest and he considered the priesthood also. <br>  <br>  Aside from that, what difference does it make whether he was a Jew or aBaptist?|`|yJXlvFfeaa	Darwin’s family tradition was nonconformist Unitarianism, while his father and grandfather were freethinkers, and his baptism and boarding school were Church of England.[11] When going to Cambridge to become an Anglican clergyman, he did not doubt the literal truth of the Bible.[16] He learnt John Herschel's science which, like William Paley’s natural theology, sought explanations in laws of nature rather than miracles and saw adaptation of species as evidence of design.[18][19] On the Beagle voyage Darwin looked for "centres of creation" to explain distribution,[39] and related the antlion found near kangaroos to distinct "periods of Creation".[41] He remained quite orthodox and would quote the Bible as an authority on morality.[134]<br>  By his return he was critical of the Bible as history, and wondered why all religions should not be equally valid.[134] In the next few years, while intensively speculating on geology and transmutation of species, he gave much thought to religion and openly discussed this with Emma, whose beliefs also came from intensive study and questioning.[72] The theodicy of Paley and Thomas Malthus vindicated evils such as starvation as a result of a benevolent creator's laws which had an overall good effect. To Darwin, natural selection produced the good of adaptation but removed the need for design,[135] and he could not see the work of an omnipotent deity in all the pain and suffering such as the ichneumon wasp paralysing caterpillars as live food for its eggs.[112] He still viewed organisms as perfectly adapted, and On the Origin of Species reflects theological views. Though he thought of religion as a tribal survival strategy, Darwin still believed that God was the ultimate lawgiver.[136][137]<br>  Darwin continued to play a leading part in the parish work of the local church,[138] but from around 1849 would go for a walk on Sundays while his family attended church.[128] Though reticent about his religious views, in 1879 he responded that he had never been an atheist in the sense of denying the existence of a God, and that generally “an Agnostic would be the more correct description of my state of mind.”[72]<br>  The “Lady Hope Story”, published in 1915, claimed that Darwin had reverted back to Christianity on his sickbed. The claims were refuted by Darwin’s children and have been dismissed as false by historians.[139] His last words were to his family, telling Emma "I am not the least afraid of death – Remember what a good wife you have been to me – Tell all my children to remember how good they have been to me", then as she laid down for a rest, he repeatedly told Henrietta and Francis "It's almost worth while to be sick to be nursed by you".[140]|`|cYgJQDQSaa	No he was actually a trainee priest when he joined the Beagle.|`|gUZjVDGDaa	yes he was

2tqdTCPQaa	ok....first i would probably be more understanding of the poem if i knew what half those words meant....if you want people to understand what your trying to convey in a poem use more day to day words dont try to make it seem so smart or like a professor wrote it or something...but i mean from reading i could kinda get that you felt angry when you wrote it and that you might feel somewhat alone and distance from the rest of the world or people that are normally around you....but i do like the poem and what it is coming from..you can tell it had motivation while writing it and that you wrote it from the heart....|`|PdDbzxvzaa	Follow the Buddha's path to the total ending of suffering and your poems will be of happiness and peace and well being in this uncaring Universe.|`|k69XBHOBaa	It really stinks, no offense but it's not good, to dark and weird|`|6bQbkRDMaa	really good|`|siWeuiTTaa	wow thats cool|`|obFG9EXGaa	it sucks a$$|`|YHcOS0Sfaa	good and powerful words :) i recently found a song that I wrote in third or first grade, lol.

Hzf3QK9faa	Some believe that the roots of cubism are to be found in the two distinct tendencies of Paul Cézanne's later work: firstly to break the painted surface into small multifaceted areas of paint, thereby emphasizing the plural viewpoint given by binocular vision, and secondly his interest in the simplification of natural forms into cylinders, spheres, and cones.<br>  <br>  However, the cubists explored this concept further than Cézanne; they represented all the surfaces of depicted objects in a single picture plane, as if the objects had had all their faces visible at the same time. This new kind of depiction revolutionized the way in which objects could be visualized in painting and art<br>  The plane is the entire space the artist is working with, the facets are the areas of paint broken down into different multi-colours for each facet, like a diamond or jewel.

It's really their job to handle uncomfortable situations like this, not yours!<br>  The person in charge could make an announcement that everyone needs to launder their clothing and come to class freshly showered. And if they are coming to a performance dirty they shouldn't be allowed to perform. Simple! <br>  When you think of ballerina's; you think of grace, beauty, and class. I mean really, we're not talking about second hand strippers. <br>  I feel for you, it's a "stinky" situation to be in.<br>  Good luck and keep showering, those bitches won't have a clue when your being asked back to dance, or even getting more important gigs.|`|oncXuOSCaa	Rub Vaseline under your nose.|`|XNNjFb4Laa	Dear, that is just part of the sacrifice when you are a ballerina.<br>  Honestly there are many dancers in Corps de ballet that I would love to shove in the shower, however, I would be fired if I did!<br>  Sometimes wearing a very strong perfume helps since you can only smell yourself.

He was the man that was shot, but his somewhat younger self (with feet) was also there. The Henry who was shot went back so all Clare's father and brother saw was the naked Henry and the blood. Anyway, that's how he told Clare to go home and also how he knew what would happen. He wasn't that young though, so for most of the book he didn't know either.<br>  <br>  I hope that clears it up for you. Edit if you need more.|`|ceBTTCPwaa	During what is to be his last year of life, Henry time-travels to a Chicago parking garage on a frigid winter night where he is unable to find shelter. He experiences hypothermia and develops frostbite. When Henry returns to his 'present', his feet must be amputated. Henry and Clare both know that without the ability to escape by running, Henry will certainly die within the next few jumps back in time. On New Year's Eve, the DeTambles throw a party, ostensibly to celebrate the new year, but the real reason is known only to Henry: he knows that the journey that will take his life will happen that night, and he doesn't want Clare to be alone when that happens. Just before midnight, Henry time-travels into the middle of the Michigan woods during deer season and is fatally shot by Clare's brother. This scene is foreshadowed earlier in the novel. Henry returns to the present and dies in Clare’s arms.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Time_Traveller%27s_Wife" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Time_Tr...</a>

Tell your friend she's the wise one.|`|761qTdxGaa	Most people fail to see the difference between Harry Potter & Twilight because they actually haven't read Twilight. However, the people who have are referring to the fact that the actual writing of the book by Steph Meyer isn't great, but the story is good. Whereas JK is an amazing writer and story-teller. The plot of Twilight is quite repetitive sometimes, and some people don't like the cheesy side of it.  I can understand the point that people don't like how because the movies come out and Robert Pattinson is just slightly hot that everyones gone mental and it is being talked about everywhere, all the time. However, I am a massive fan of both series. I used to complain about Twilight and be the same as your friend is, but I was just ignorant. If she hasn't read them, tell her to give it a chance.|`|CjAaOsu2aa	You shouldn't force a friend to change her likes and dislikes. She hates Twilight? Her choice. She loves Harry Potter? Her choice.

ji7WZvC1aa	A bar is a division within the music - indicated by a vertical line down the staff - "Cain't Say No" is in 4/4 so there will be 4 beats per bar.

I would imagine that song is either in 4/4 time or cut time (equivalent of 2/2).  This 'time signature' will be on the far left marginof each staff of music.  The time signature tells you how long a 'bar' is.  You'd have to be able to read music a bit to discern but 4 qquarter notes...or 8 eighth notes...or 16 16th notes...or two half notes or one whole note....are the full compliment of notes you can put into a 'bar' in 4/4 time.   Simply a thin vertical line from the top of the staff to the bottom of the staff demarcate a 'bar'.

v5VlL09iaa	If you set the SB-800 to it's lowest setting in M mode it should trigger the studio lights as long as your inside or not in bright light (confuses the strobes) and it shouldn't contribute much of anything to the exposure. But honestly using the SB-800 is a bit of a waste. I'm sure you use it for other things though.<br>  <br>  A good radio trigger is worth it's money. Skyports for example have 4 groups you can use. You can put each strobe on it's own group. When your metering you don't have to have someone else popping the strobe for you, just plug the transmitter into your meter, set to group A and fire. Only group A will fire. Then set to group B, only group B will fire. Then you can set the transmitter to fire all groups and your rocking and rolling.<br>  <br>  I mention Skyports because I know them, but there are better less expensive units available now as well.

If they ratio is 1:1 the image will be kinda flat (no shadows), and if the ratio is 1:8 you will be really dark on one side or overblown on the other or both.<br>  <br>  Try to put one flash on one side of the subject and the other flash on the other side. An off camera shoe cord and bracket can help with that.

tHdEQdVqaa	I have to say that digital imaging has not really ruined photography but rather allowed people to share their otherwise crappy snapshots with the rest of the world when combine digital with the internet.  I think most amateurs were taking the same crappy snaps with point and shoot film cameras as they are with their digi gizmos.  Lucky us can see all of these lousy pictures uploaded by millions at our leisure.  <br>  <br>  There are, however, a couple of things I find troubling about digital.<br>  <br>  The first being people think that getting the proper exposure and composition is handled by just buying the most expensive pro camera they can get their hands on.  Fact is if you give a disposable camera to someone the likes of Ansel Adams they will take a better picture than you.    <br>  <br>  The second is how surprised I am about what types of images people honestly believe are "totally awesome".  Some of the most poorly exposed, badly composed and completely over photo shopped images I have seen have gotten raves from other people.  I am guessing even if these same photos were shot on film and put in the family album they would still recieve raves the only difference being is now they are shared with the world.  <br>  <br>  On a bright note I have noticted a renewed interest in useing film.  Lomo camera seem to have a lot of people interested in useing them and the small camera store in my area was completely sold out of black and white film yesterday in both 36mm and 120 so tere must be a lot more film being used. That is a very good sign and I hope that trend continues.|`|FeUmyxqqaa	"depend on the camera" - ok when a camera can set up and use lights then i will conceed to your arguement, <br>  <br>  there are still people out there that have learnt about the craft and produce good images, there are many on their way and learning now, there are many more dont care about composition or other things and want to play in photoshop and have fun, if one is having fun doing what they are doing great, <br>  <br>  <br>  i dont have to like everyones pictures, i defend their right to have fun taking them and sharing them|`|udaDM69kaa	Digital photography has democratized the issue, now anyone can have one cam or more. But there are still those who care for Photography, and digitals have improved things: We can go manual, and find out new aspects that we didn't know about our camera. Experiment leads to better technique, and I think this is good.<br>  I don't have a pessimistic point of view, but just the contrary.|`|s4WywJ8baa	Its, purely skill.<br>  <br>  It doesn't matter what camera you use.<br>  <br>  I know of professional photographers who only use real film. I know of some that only use digital. And I know a few great photographers who only use instant Poloroid.<br>  <br>  Its your skill and eye.<br>  <br>  Digital has made it easier and immediate to get your art out there.<br>  <br>  No more developing, printing then scanning your photos to get them out into the world to be seen and used. Magazines, newspapers and even on tv.<br>  <br>  With digital... I don't have to print my photos to get them to my clients and models. They get them burned to a cd so they can use them instantly. Instead of waiting weeks for the photographer to get around to developing them or having them done.<br>  <br>  I still work in 35 mm, but I prefer digital.|`|at61Qn9xaa	Maybe....<br>  <br>  There is still a skill to being a great photographer. To get into this business good enough will not cut it. On top of it you have to be a digital guru and know color management.<br>  <br>  Even in the film days photographers would over shoot just to cover them self. Most all would bracket on top of that. I don't see no harm in that. Digital makes it more addictive, and it ads to more editing and work-flow after the shoot.<br>  <br>  We just have to get over the good enough mind set and photography will be all right.<br>  <br>  As artist we our self are our biggest enemy. Artist need to understand that there is a value we create. We have a visual product worth wile compensation.|`|Bk4eIAWWaa	I am always wary of any statement that paints so many people with one brush."people these days now depend on the camera instead of knowing about the basics" is one of these statements. After over 30 years as a pro I decided to join a camera club and improve the hobby side of my photography. I was totally AMAZED at what some people out there knew and were accomplishing! And guess what, there were MANY of them!<br>  <br>  Now photography is an odd art. Since Mr. Eastman put the ability to record an image into the hands of everyday people, people not trained in arts or composition, there have been TONS of poorly taken images still of value to the taker for sentimental reasons. Instamatic, disc film, automatic 35mm cameras have all played a role in the proliferation of bad photography/good memories. The difference today is that they are now shared around the world, rather than by friends and family who are just too polite to let them know their photos are trash.<br>  <br>  Meanwhile, for the true artist striving to create, photography today has opened a whole new arena. Some photographers are pushing closer to the painted arts, just like they have always tried to do with texture screens, shooting through glass, sandwiching negatives, etc, etc. I have seen a new description, Illustrative Photography...I kind of like that one!

vkzkXWfzaa	With your APS sized sensor a 50mm will behave as a 75mm would on a 35mm format camera. 75mm is classed as an ideal focal length for portraits. Its as wide an angle you can get without distortion (long noses etc.)<br>  <br>  All manufacturers 50mm are good lenses (its the easiest to make), so is usually the cheapest in their range.<br>  <br>  To get your small depth of field shots you need a wide aperture or more magnification (or both in an ideal world).<br>  <br>  The sharpest lenses tend to be any manufacturers 100mm Macro, they are usually only f2.8, but the extra magnification limits DOF so the two tend to cancel out. A 100mm will put you further away from the subject than a 50mm for the same shot.<br>  <br>  Don't let people put you off 3rd party lenses Sigma make lenses in your mount any of their EX range will knock the pants off any Minolta offering in build and image quality, their standard range isn't bad either.<br>  <br>  If you are photographing in a studio aperture is less of an issue as you can always pump more light into the stage, or use flash. Most lenses work better a couple of stops smaller than maximum aperture.<br>  <br>  My favorite lens for portraiture out of the studio is a Sigma 70 - 200mm f2.8 EX its one of those ideal world lenses.<br>  <br>  In my studio I tend to use a 100mm f2.8 macro (not focussed that close) as its the sharpest lens I have, better than my 50mm f1.4 or the f.1.2, it also doubles as a macro lens of course, but is less useful for general photography than a 50mm. You need a large studio to use it, for a full body shot I would have to be some 10 - 15ft away.<br>  <br>  Chris|`|xG5ZlJDqaa	Get the Minolta instead. Optical performance on most 50mm lens are all pretty much made optically equal. You're decision should be based on build quality and how good the autofocus system is.<br>  <br>  Looking at reviews, pictures taken from a 1980's Nikkor 50mm f/1.4 AI-S differs very little from the newest Nikkor 50mm f/1.4 AF-S lens.|`|CyUxMcWSaa	With your crop factor, the 50mm lenses works great.  I use a nikon system, D300 and use a 50mm f/1.4 for my studio work, especially when space is a concern.  It's worth the money, it really is.<br>  <br>  Another alternative is any prime lens 75mm to 100mm (for aps sensors).  Prime lenses are not cheap, no matter what camera system you use.  Instead of buying new though, check on ebay, at b&h, or adorama, and get a really nice used lens.  My brother and I still have our old Minolta systems and I'm always finding deals on old Minolta MC and MD bayonet mounts, especially manual lenses, since the latest generation doesn't seem to know how to use them.  With studio work, you can use a manual lens and in some ways with better results than AF lenses.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

ceBTTCPwaa	Nickel and Dimed: On (Not) Getting By in America is a book written by Barbara Ehrenreich. Written from the perspective of the undercover journalist, it sets out to investigate the impact of the 1996 welfare reform on the "working poor" in the United States. In some ways it is similar to George Orwell's much earlier Down and Out in Paris and London as well as German investigative reporter Günter Wallraff's Ganz Unten (The Lowest of the Low).<br>  <br>  The events related in the book took place between spring 1998 and summer 2000. The book was first published in 2001 by Metropolitan Books. An earlier version appeared as an article in the January 1999 issue of Harper's magazine. Ehrenreich later wrote a companion book, Bait and Switch (published September 2005), which discusses her attempt to find a white-collar job.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickel_and_Dimed" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickel_and_...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.barbaraehrenreich.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.barbaraehrenreich.com/</a> <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookjive.com/wiki/Nickel_and_Dimed" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookjive.com/wiki/Nickel_and_...</a>

dFXNZ3TSaa	Stress Counters: Try just saying the words out loud. the best way to tell the stress of a word is to speak it as this is also how the words will be read. <br>  <br>  experiment, feel your way through. read a few sonnets out loud and see how the words in each line sound. then, write a line of your own, read it out loud, and then you'll be able to hear if any word sounds awkward or out of place. sonnets tend to be very fluid when read so, in my opinion, it's best to let your own intuition about words take over.<br>  <br>  if you're having difficulty feeling it out, it's sometimes best to go back to basics and learn english as if you speak another language (as much of our grammar and pronunciation is so natural)<br>  <br>  try : <a href="http://www.englishmedialab.com/pronunciation/pronunciation%201.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.englishmedialab.com/pronuncia...</a>

TU6hZ2Beaa	I love my Kindle 2<br>  <br>  This is the first time I have ever tried an e-reader of any kind. I just love the Kindle 2. It is so easy to use! I am a user of bifocal lenses, so it is nice to be able to adjust the font size to fit my vision with or without glasses.<br>  <br>  Downloading a book is quite fast and simple. I am very grateful to not have to go to a store for my reading material. This is a great bonus!<br>  <br>  I bought the leather cover for 29.99. It is very sturdy and protects the Kindle 2 well. It is definitely a must have.<br>  <br>  I also got the protective skin for the back of the Kindle 2 and the screen saver. I want my Kindle 2 to last forever!<br>  <br>  Reading with the Kindle 2 is a pure joy! The page turning is quite fast. I have found the book selections to be more than adequate for my reading preferences.<br>  <br>  It is such a ease to take the Kindle 2 anywhere. It can slip into a purse or a tote easily.<br>  <br>  I highly recommend it to anyone who is into reading.

I agree it's convenient, but with a pricetag like that (260?!?!)  and the fact that you have to pay for each book you download...it's way cheaper to go to a second hand bookstore (or even a new bookstore) and find what you're looking at for a fraction of the cost, if not the same amount of money.  and plus i like owning books, i love the smell of different books, i like dog ear-ing pages, i like writing things in the margins.  the kindle sort of kills all of the small joys i get out of book ownership.

But, ever since Ever was in a car accident which killed her parents and sister, she could hear people's thoughts, see auras, and a person's life story just from touching someone. Thinking she's crazy, she tries to shut herself out from everyone by becoming an outcast at school. But everything changes when she meets Damen Auguste. Ever sees Damen and feels an instant recognition. He is gorgeous, exotic and wealthy, and he holds many secrets. Damen is able to make things appear and disappear, he always seems to know what she’s thinking—and he’s the only one who can silence the noise and the random energy in her head. She doesn’t know who he really is—or what he is. Can she trust him?<br>  <br>  Uglies series by Scott Westerfeld<br>  It's hard to explain but it's about the future, after mankind basically destroyed the earth (global warming, destroying forests, polluting, etc) survivors made a new society where there's no argueing, war, etc. Everyone is considered "ugly" until they turn 16 and have this sugery that makes them "pretty" and they move to this part of town where all they do is have fun and party all day and night. Tally cant wait to turn pretty. She meets Shay who's a rebal and convinces Tally to leave the city for a night to see what's out in the wilderness. Tally learns all kinds of things about being pretty and the truth is.. it's not really pretty. EXTREMELY good, and the sequals are even better. It's full of adventures, cool technologies, romance, etc. <br>  <br>  The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins<br>  This book is also set in the future and gets pretty intense. It's setting is in Panem, a city that's now in what's left of North America (which has become smaller after global warming and melting of the ice caps). Surrounding Panem are 12 districts where each year, one boy and girl between the ages of 12 and 18 are chosen to be in the Hunger Games where they are put into an arena and battle each other and try to survive until there's only one left and is the winner. There's also some romance in it. One of my favorite books<br>  <br>  Deadly Little Secrets by Laurie Stolarz<br>  It's the first of it's series and is also really good. It's about a girl named Camelia who lives a normal life - dating, has friends, decent grades. But, one day when she was picking an earing that she dropped crossing the street, a car was coming towards her and it wasn't stopping. Suddenly, a hot guy shoves her out of the way, saving her life. He left without her saying thank you or asking what his name was. Three months later, she's starting her junior year in high school and there's this rumor about a new guy named Ben who supposedly killed his girlfriend. Camelia doesn't believe in rumors and when she sees Ben, it's the guy who saved her life. She tries to talk to him but he ignores her at first, but later Ben begins touching her weirdly but Camilia only gets more drawn to him. She later finds out he's not ordinary. He can know the future or past of a person by touching a person and he senses that Camelia's in great danger. Really intense but good with a twisted love triangle.<br>  <br>  Kissed by an Angel by Elizabeth Chandler<br>  Well, it's kind of three books in one. It's suppose to be about this guy, Tristian, and this girl, Ivy, who are crazy about each other. Ivy also has this strong belief in angels (like a water angel, a death angel, etc) which Tristian doesn't believe at all. But one day, they get in a car accident and Tristian dies and Ivy's belief in angels die with him and Ivy feels as if she has lossed everything. But, Tristian is still there, protecting her as an angel. But the problem is, Ivy keeps doubting about angels so no matter what Tristian does to try to help her, he hurts her more and Ivy feels more alone. Tristian soon realizes that their car accident wasn't an accident and whoever killed Tristian is trying to kill Ivy but can he save her im time?<br>  <br>  I recommend Need by Carrie Jones if you really liked Twilight.

It's not there anymore. You'll still be able to see them loads though|`|jI85GYGoaa	Next week you will be fine. Trust me.|`|bxlYleZkaa	Yes, it is normal, because it is the end of a routine.|`|517360c1a1db979fb2f19bbb959f22eaaa	Jobs are important to us even if we "hate it". A job - any job - has lots of benefits that we don't think about. <br>  <br>  -It gives us a routine and a reason to get up in the morning. <br>  -It's a source of income and some sense of security. <br>  -It gives you a sense of belonging and interacting with colleagues--hopefully you like one or two of them.<br>  <br>  When you lose a job, even if you hate it, you lose all of that too. Maybe you're sad because feel the loss of those benefits and people. <br>  <br>  Just because you're leaving, it doesn't mean that you can't keep in touch with your friends.|`|wqchA8B7aa	Yes, a change of life can be sad, even if the previous instance was bad. You'll get over it. This is called the "Change curve". You drop down to a low level, then it rises again to an even higher level. You'll be fine, just give it time.|`|0F8hauikaa	Sure. It's often normal to feel sadness when closing a chapter of our lives, even if it wasn't all good.|`|utGddhnVaa	yeah..it means there is going to be change in your life and that makes some people sad and scared|`|t27SvIPbaa	Its not the leaving the job that is stressing you out, its the unknown ahead of you that is stressing you out.  Most people don't handle change well, but they should because change in life is inevitable.<br>  <br>  Take this as a lesson in your future changes.  Look forward not back, for the past is dead.   <br>  <br>  Friends come and go just make sure that you are positive and enjoy the new experience you will meet you friends just as you have done in the past.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you are really serious, then when you look the old momentum comes to an end.<br>  <br>  The moment that ends, something new begins.<br>  <br>  A ship is safe in the harbour, but that's not what ships were built for.|`|4UQegWk0aa	Of course it is normal.

Good luck. xoxo.|`|107405bbcdb915439a0fd322a6701663aa	yes. it's always a hard when major lifestyle changes happen. just remember that in a few weeks or months you'll look back and be happy you're out of there and won't feel sad.|`|AA10860409	Of course it is. Just like ending a bad relationship, It's always a part of your life that you are leaving behind. But that feeling will soon fade away.|`|oxiVWMMCaa	uh no|`|L2Tvu7VLaa	It's normal to feel sad for anything that you no longer have. when you hate a job for whatever reason you look so forward to not being there that you don't think about what you'll miss till after it's too late to say goodbye. that can perhaps make it more noticable of a feeling. But say a quick goodbye to yourself for the things and people you'll miss and do a little happy dance that all the stress and junk are gone. In a few days you'll have a new daily routine and new people to talk to on a daily basis that in itself will help you forget the good and bad of the old job and move onto better things. :D Congratz|`|0rBEqVtHaa	a little.<br>  I'd love to leave my job...voluntarily|`|8a60141ea10cc0c778578bb0f86b6be3aa	A job, even a bad one, affords us a semblance of stability in life:  A paycheck, friends, somewhere to go during the day, something to look forward to at the end of the day (like going home), and plenty of other things.  So when you lose it, by leaving or getting fired, it is only natural that you would feel some sadness over it.  <br>  <br>  There is no reason why you can't keep in contact with the friends you made there, and become better friends rather than just good acquaintances.|`|WNsjy5oFaa	yes its perfectly normal - you are facing new challenges and although you dislike your old job you are leaving behind friends and maybe a sense of security as you obviously know your old job well and can probably do it in your sleep. <br>  i'm facing a similar problem, i dislike where i work but love the people i work with and i actually love my position but like you i know its causing me health and stress problems and that i need to move on before i go mad|`|44Sj3bsZaa	Of course it is sad! Even though you hate the job itself it is normal for you to miss the people that you worked with. But you can still take lunch breaks or after work cocktails with the ones that you really liked and you will be making a whole new batch so that sad feeling will go away soon! Congrats on the new job!!!|`|kXCgQoYLaa	Yes, you're bound to have a feeling of loss for a while, because even the times that seem bad in life, nearly always contain good people and more positive aspects than we realise.

Maybe this is you second-guessing your decision to leave?<br>  <br>  Either way, congrats for having the guts to leave a place that made you miserable. Kudos!|`|eqIdb16jaa	Of course it's normal. Although you may have hated your job, I'm sure there were aspects to the job you've gotten used to. You made friends there and etc, therefore it's only normal that you would feel sad about leaving the job.|`|3YiZ63OVaa	Yea, even though you hate the job, you may be leaving people and friends that you've worked with for quit awhile behind.

I wouldn't worry about it since they govern this forum and they don't always explain themselves.<br>  <br>  I am confused, whoever said science was reality? Science is just a method for finding the truth. It's a method that relies on one fundamental thing: reason. <br>  <br>  Your argument here is just an emotional justification for wanting to believe in God. It's an endorsement of faith. You're proclaiming faith, which I am sure is emotional satisfying for you, but it is not proof.<br>  <br>  The problem with faith over reason is that it's subjective. Your examples are very telling. ESP has not been validated by any scientific test so should we accept it on your word? What if someone claims that the nation can only be saved by killing ten virgins? or hundred? It seems far fetched only because in the advanced nations of the world faith luckily has been shoved aside by reason. Faith in the annuals of history has generally been backed up by force. You can not establish by faith the grounds were faith stops.|`|MPxd2nDHaa	Don't you contradict yourself?<br>  <br>  You started being an atheist because there is no proof of god.<br>  You stopped being an atheist because science "is not reality."<br>  <br>  Other than that...I don't see how you can deny science by using ESP and remote viewing as examples.  You're using something that is completely unproven as a reason to not believe in something that is completely proven...<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  Atheism doesn't conclude there is no god. It concludes that there is no belief in a god.  I can't reasonably say there is no god, because there is no evidence pointing towards there being a god, and none against it. However, I can rationally think if I hold the belief in a god.  Science can't come up with every answer, because, and using your ESP as an example... as you stated scientists need repeat testing.  These people who "have" ESP, only have it randomly.  Because of these random instances it would be impossible to scientifically test it.  Unless you wanted to hook the person up to a machine for the rest of their life and see their brain function at the times of these occurrences.  <br>  <br>  Earth can still exist, as can every animal and plant on it. However, humans, since they have an advanced consciousness over animals and plants, are the only beings alive that question the existence of a god.  So, you're right, if there were no humans then there would be no question of god.  Scientists can't prove the time before earth's existence because that time is infinite as is the space.  Time and space are human created ideas and thus can't be examined when it comes to how the universe works.  Do you think beings with a consciousness as advanced or more advanced than ours, on other planets, examine the existence of god?<br>  <br>  Also, on the topic of deja vu (the commenter below):<br>  Deja Vu is a lapse in the brain.  The brain gets confused with the situation as something that has already happened. This is caused by the brain reacting to a similar situation and putting it together with the current situation.  It happens more with older people as the brain degenerates and isn't able to separate the instances in time/place.

People on yahoo answers have become jerks. They like to report innocent questions for no reason at all.  I suppose they have nothing better to do with their life. <br>  <br>  anyways,  it sounds like your agnostic... you dont know which way to believe.  Scientific evidence proves there is no God.. but you are right... they dont have the technology to see billions of years ago. <br>  <br>  No one knows. in this whole religion world, no one truley knows. and probably will never know in this age.    Someone could have created this world.. or it could just be there. there are many unexplained things.. it could go on and on and on.. we havent even discovered  0.00000000000000000000000000000000000000... of this world and billions more zeros. we only have enough technology to go so far.  which makes me believe there has to be more life out there. we just cant get to it.  <br>  <br>  but no one will ever know.<br>  <br>  This is what i think. since no one will ever know, try to be good and behave and give "God" some time, just in case... but dont waste ur life praising him either.

(like me) <br>  Third, What turned me away from atheism was first long-term deja-vu. <br>  Deja vu is the idea that the brain processes something a short while after the eyes do, making you think you saw it twice. However, this has been known to occur over years and years and years of time. how do you explain that?<br>  Also, I later realized one of teaching of Buddhism (the idea that everything is the same matter, and is in every form right now) Is the exact principle of Quantum theory. SO what I now think, is what I refer to as "completism": the idea that all Gods are the same God being slowly proven by science.<br>  <br>  And, for the record, life has been found outside of the solar system. We've found RNA in I think Andromeda.|`|x7QFtMZIaa	I never liked the idea of labeling. I also realized that nothing is truly definite. No one knows if there is or isn't a god because its beyond us. I don't like how some atheists say they are absolutely sure that there is no god, nor do I like religious people say that they are sure that there is a god. Thus, I follow my own trend and say that I am irreligious because I do not have my own dogma as to how I approach things, whether there is or isn't a god is only relative to how I perceive the subjective and thus I don't have a need to believe in a god since it has no purpose to my life. Spirituality is a pursuit I take as a side but isn't something I avoid, condem, nor condone. As long as I do not say that I have the answer to everything then I'm fine with it. Atheism and Theism both have their problems.

AA11458484	That was very well written.  I have always wondered if there is any such thing as real truth.  Is there some common "reality" that people can actually anchor anything on (any decision, perception, etc.)?  Here is what I have come up with, which definitely ties into the layers of perception and justification that we all tend to integrate out of human nature:<br>  <br>  Truth is a tension between two extremes. I am not talking about dualism, but more a balance of reasoning. In that sense, truth is the best decision, when taking into account all variables. Truth is the right direction to go, whether or not it is constant. Truth says that, "One or the other is a lie." What is ultimately correct is the truth.<br>  <br>  Truth is also what is, if anything. Does anything actually exist, including existence itself? Is there such a thing as time - this "distance of events" within which matter and space exist? How did "everything" come to be? Are you real? <br>  <br>  Yes. You are. Everything does exist. You are alive. That is the truth. So, what is the reason? Well, truth would hold that the reason "is," therefore a better question (to avoid missing what is) is: <br>  <br>  "What is keeping anyone from truth?"  That is where your analysis comes in. I would say the answer to that is more of a psychological answer than a philosophical one: People have an uncanny ability to see and believe what they want to be true. To cross the gap between perception and reality, one should probably look within and ask themselves, "Is there anything that I believe just because I want it to be true? Is there anything I am refusing to see?"<br>  <br>  I believe that if one honestly asks these questions (and few do for fear of losing control of their own universe and destiny), they will find truth. That fact is one that is woven into the very reason for existence. I wonder why? <br>  <br>  : )|`|OMJTZprXaa	what is your actual question?<br>  <br>  What you have said is all true. You are 16? wow, you are pretty smart. must have been studying last life time :-)<br>  <br>  Yes, we come to conclusions which are built of factual pieces, and that understanding or belief is a resting point - a step as you say<br>  <br>  and yes, it is an illusion because fundamentally all realisations we come to are false. The ultimate truth = 0.<br>  <br>  This is an impersonal view of God based on the fact that God is energy and our actual existence is a reflection of that energy as some type of form. However, when we truely realise ourself, we will realise that our existence is actually void - 0. The idea is that we need to basically run through the equation till the final conclusion which is that we do not exist, and that is liberation or Brahman realisation.<br>  <br>  I actually practice the personal aspect of God, which is based on service to God. The end result is actually liberation awarded by God for such a good level of devotional service.<br>  <br>  It is not a mathematical impersonal formula to be solved. I think solving that equation is impossible.<br>  <br>  its like a belief, whatever it is, can be broken up into 2 true points. Also, it can be broken up into 3 logical points. It can be broken up into 5 logical points. And in fact, into any number of logical points.<br>  <br>  So I am not sure how we achieve liberation because to me it seems, that we will always meet more complex equations. There will never be a 0 result, because everything can actually just get deeper and deeper and more complex and involved - ie, adding more pieces to the equation.<br>  <br>  What are you trying to find out?|`|FoIxsunVaa	What reasons and results are you referring to? I find this whole essay extraordinarily pointless. Yes humans have denial, it is a survival mechanism. You would be dead without denial.<br>  <br>  I really have no idea what you are saying. So what can I say? A well written mystery?|`|AA11635601	When you dangle "ten points" like that, it's like we're puppies and you're holding up a treat to make us stand up on our back legs.  Just ask your question.  We already know you have ten points you could award to someone.  We all do.|`|07fd7ea1dbff60f8707ba40041258bc9aa	Perception, one person saying they honestly think that another person's actions were wrong because it fits their own ideas by slightly altering the events.  Your additional details seem to just about sum up what this says.  Anyway there's that folk law about one mans rubbish is another mans treasure, which seems to have something to do with this, discarding irrelevant ideas just to have the other person pick up on them and assume that because of the one occasion the person is always like that.|`|QlXhPFSwaa	your only 16? im impressed. when i was 16. i was brain dead and still am. anyway, you answered your own question so what else do you wanna know? if i understand what you were talking about. someone's perception is not the same as the other person? well DUH. that's philosophy for you we agree to disagree. my point of view is mine and mine alone and so are each and everyone in the world. so ya thats my perception of your question.|`|QXnZy9m2aa	That my young sir or lady is exactly the thought process of someone understanding religion.<br>  <br>  I know I will get some thumbs down for that but look at it like this..why are there so many different version of religions? Somebody thought of it this or that way and said it was this or that way,,, not their this or that way.|`|3qSQ7hPnaa	oh i know who said that i read it somewhere on google...hey did you copy and past that....sneaky goose.
rnPmkrzPaa	Like Water For Chocolate is a Hispanic folk saying that does not actually mean boiling point such as we think of it in the US - when you reach your boiling point, you are ready to explode in anger.<br>  <br>  Rather in Latin American culture it has a more sensual meaning.<br>  <br>  In Mexico, hot chocolate is made with water, not milk. Water is boiled and chunks of chocolate, or chocolate tablets are dropped in to melt. The saying "like water for chocolate," means to be hot like the water is hot enough to receive the chocolate. It is a metaphor for describing a state of passion or sexual arousal.<br>  <br>  So basically it is a metaphor for being 'hot and ready'.<br>  <br>  However, in the movie "Like Water For Chocolate" there is a scene where the main character, Tita, is making mole (a chocolate and chili sauce) when she is thinking about 'like water for chocolate'. That section of the movie is often interpreted to mean that substituting one love for another is like using water in the mole sauce instead of chocolate, because that sort of love triangle exchange is what is happening in the plot of the movie. <br>  <br>  While that may be one way to interpret Tita's statement, it isn't what the folk saying 'like water for chocolate' really means.<br>  <br>  This is a good link for other Latin American folks sayings.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.lasculturas.com/lib/libFolklore.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.lasculturas.com/lib/libFolklo...</a>|`|AA11305648	it means trying to exchange something of great value (chocolate) for a watered-down, or less valuable, version of it. there's actually a movie called Como Agua Para Chocolate (Like Water for Chocolate in Spanish) that's a pretty good movie.|`|001ef89c221f19d2c9006f3355dc837caa	Selling/giving/gifting something against something else, whose quality and value do not compare at all.<br>  <br>  Means you're getting something valueless while losing or giving away something valuable.|`|zUVhmCvSaa	"like water for chocolate" is a mexican expression that means, "at boiling point."   it is an appropriate title for Laura Esquival's book because of the Magical Realism tied in with the food theme which is a major element of Latin American culture.  <br>  Great book!
