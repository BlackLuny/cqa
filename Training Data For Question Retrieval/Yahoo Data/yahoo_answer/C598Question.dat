20090131171804AAmufqV	Health;Mental Health	Have u ever wanted to kill someone?	my best friend was killed by her boyfriend 2 weeks ago. he smashed her head in with a hammer and left her lying outside in the snow.  she was in a coma for a week and she finally died.      i've NEVER felt homicidal thoughts before, and I'd never actually kill someone (i am not mentally ill!!!!) but sometimes i think that if i was face to face with the guy who killed her i'd want to kill him.  is that evil? will i go to hell for thoughts like that?

20090131172802AAJIyvZ	Health;Other - Health	Is it normal for a woman in her 40's to forget like this? ?	I've been having problems with my memory for awhile. I saw a doctor and they said I was deficient in vit D, so I took a very high amount of vit d for awhile. I will be going back in later to have it tested again. But I'm scared. The other day I wrote a check and wrote 1-20-90 for the date. I had to stand there and try to figure out what was wrong. The saleman helped me out and told me it was 2009. Duh!  Another example: I set up a massage appointment. I was reminded about it the day before. I forgot about it (i've been doing that kind of thing for a long time; not the problem). The next day I looked at my calander and saw "massage appointment". I had to think for a long time to figure out what that was about. I finally remembered that I made the appointment. What could this be? I'm worried. (Sorry so long)

20090131172258AAFN9eK	Health;Women's Health	Why do I break so many condoms?	I know how to put them on correctly, and I even did some volunteer AIDS prevention work overseas instructing men on how to use them. My girlfriend says I'm "big", and that prevents me from using the free ones at Planned Parenthood. I tried Trojan Magnum, and during vigorous sex they break. During more moderate sex she complains of discomfort from the condom (she never feels that unless a condom is being worn). We use KY, a lot, and she is still in pain. It has been a frustrating process trying to make this work while she is off her birth control, and I appreciate any advice.

20090131174443AALIxgL	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Cancer	Nexavar...and help with a support group online?	My step dad has liver cancer and since there really wasn't an option of surgery to remove the tumor, the doctor said he could "try" Nexavar. He him to try it for a few weeks to see how it helped him. His platelet count came up to normal range after being on it for a week, so his doctor told him to continue. The only problem he got really lethargic and sick from the drugs side effects. His doctor also talked about risks with the medicine and one included hemorrhaging. This morning that happened, he hemorrhaged and he almost died. He was projectile vomiting blood and it was so scary. So, I was just wondering if anyone else had a bad reaction to Nexavar. I know anything "could" happen, but it's still scary. Also, I'm so new to all this cancer stuff and seeing what I saw today really really scared me. I've never seen something so bad in my life, do they have any online support groups for cancer victim's family?...I'm sure they do, but could someone point me in the direction of a good one. Thanks.

Then today, not even 24 hours later, it said I lost 7.5 pounds since the last time I took the body test. I retried it to make sure, but I had indeed lost 7.5 pounds in not even 24 hours. Why? Also, I'm just now getting over mono, but that shouldn't cause it. I woke up this morning and I couldn't get out of bed. I was very shakey and eating barely helped. It was like my food was digested really fast and I was really weak. Also, the mono is almost gone, so I should have my balance back, but it's worse. I constantly fall over and It's hard to stand on one foot. I don't think it's natural to lose so much weight so fast. I weighed myself, so it's not the board. I just don't feel well. idk if this will add but I have gastropereses and gastritis. But that shouldn't do anything i don't think. I know I'm underweight for 13, but it's because I'm VERY short. I can't help it. I take vitamins, and I'm usually healthy. I'm worried about my balance, my weird weight changes (they happen all the time, but that's the 1st time I lost soo much), and I just don't feel well. Please help!      btw mono is mononucleosis      The scale was never moved, i was wearing the same clothes, and i got my mono in sept and the doc said its almost gone

20090131200142AAft1UV	Health;Mental Health	Is it normal to be worried?	its been over 13 since the boat crash in '96.       STORY: .. (i was 5) me and my family were In New Orleans for the day(its only a 2 hours away from our house) Well, i cant remember what it was, i think it was a mall or something...anyway, it was lunch time nad we were in the Cafe close to the boardwalk so we can look at the water while we ate lunch.   well, we were in line and then all of a sudden a cargo boat crashes in to the  cafe we were in. ( i can still see in my mind the boat breaking threw wall. that boat was HUGE)   well, the lights go out, people are running all over the place, and i was at  the brink of crying my eye balls out.    it was bad enough my dad was in the bathroom and he wasn't around, but i lost my mom....and then....a rafter or beam, what ever you call it, came crashing down 2 feet in front of me... i almost died that day...   well, i finally found my mom, and everyone made their way outside, and i was so happy to find my dad.      anyway. my question is, is it ok to to still be a little freaked out about this even though it happened 13 years ago.    I'm not TOTALY crazy to where i have bad dreams about it. (actually i cant remember i time when i did)    i just get a little worried at times. Like when im in wal mart or somewheres, i just get a little paranoid that something bad will happen.       i dont break in to a sweat and start going into a crazy fit, i just get these crazy and weird thoughts of bad things happening like a car or even a air plane crashing into it.
20090131155422AAvcwPM	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Cancer	Weird, on and off thin stools?	For the past few months I have had normal bowel movements mixed with ones involving thin stools and straining. Today, though, kinda struck me as a combination of the two. When I was going, I noticed that when the BM started my stools were pencil thin, but as I continued they got thicker and thicker until the last one passed looked totally normal (about a half a foot long and an inch in diameter). This is confusing me, as I'm getting a good amount of fiber a day (I eat a salad at dinner, and sometime before and during that there's probably veggies mixed with some of my meals) and drinking anywhere between 3 and 8 glasses of water a day, in addition to other liquids. Also, sometimes I feel abdominal discomfort after I go and notice a vague sense of incomplete defecation, but neither are consistent. So tell me, if this were colon cancer, would I be having these problems consistently? I thought I saw blood once, but the fecal occult test was negative, and that was for two separate BM's.

20090131194631AAraMBw	Health;Dental	Is it ok to replace my own spacer/separator? (braces)?	Today i had my spacers put in and one of them could not go in all the way because, well, it wouldnt fit, so it was hanging out halfway sorta and they warned me that this one would probably fall out.    so as i was eating, that half-sticken out spacer fell out and i see that it is chewed up, sorta, like, teeth marks on the side, but the shape is relatively the same, a circle.      After dinner, i flossed the part where the spacer came out and i reinserted it myself with the use of 2 flosses in the ring, it fits perfectly now,   I'm worried that the effect of the spacer will not be the same or as intended because i reinserted it myself and it fits even better, is it because of the teeth marks made during dinner?      Another problem is that i got them put in today, and my braces are put in on tuesday.  the orthodontist is not open tomorrow, so that leaves monday for them to reinsert the spacer, will 1 day be enough for that spot to "space" out?

So im 16, and a month or so i did a very small pinch of "dip" chewing tobacco, and i mean the size of the nail on your thumb and approximately a cm to 1 and 1/2 cm thick.  First of all im never gonna do it again, and secondly i only did it once.  As i did it, i didnt swallow any fluids at all, i spit in a bottle, after i did it i didnt swallow for about 5 mins (while that was happening i was washing my mouth and spitting any possible excess fluids for precautions).  Also as i did it (which lasted about 30 mins) i moved the pinch from different sides of my mouth to lower precise absorption.  What I want to know is if there are any possible side affects for what i did (not what dip can do in a long term, but what i did once) also what symptoms/signs should i be looking out for?    For background info I am a very health athletic guy, and i eat healthily and work out just about ever single day.

20090131171354AALnzvc	Health;Diseases & Conditions;STDs	Do I have herpes or not?	-- This is for people that know something about herpes/testing.      First let me describe my apparent outbreak. There were three really tiny red bumps and one slightly larger one (about the size of a pimple). They didn't feel like anything, and I didn't have any other symptoms of herpes type II. I had sex with two girls, and one of them said she had cold sores and she did give me oral. Her doctor said she couldn't have given them to me because it had been too long since she had a cold sore and she wouldn't have been "shedding."      Nevertheless, my doc diagnosed it as herpes after a physical. I took a bloodtest the same day (he said I was wasting my money!), and the test came back negative. I took the blood test about three weeks since the last sexual encounter when I took the test. My results from that test: I had a 0.00 range for type II, meaning no antibodies were in my system. But keep in mind, this was only three weeks after the encounter and during an outbreak....)    Now my doctor is basically saying I don't have herpes and he doesn't know what the lesions were....basically, he didn't diagnose it correctly or he doesn't know anything about testing and how accurate they are even during a small breakout like I had. What am I do make of this? (the bumps are gone, so I can't get a second opinion)       Does the body produce more antibodies during a breakout?    And What else could these little bumps have been?

20090131181715AAywM6z	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Cancer	Stage four hip and lung cancer.?	hi, my grandma has Stage 4 lung cancer and hip cancer.    She has had lung cancer before in 2000 i think. She had 3/4 of her left lung removed. The cancer has returned. It returned around the middle of october. The cancer is only on the 25 percent of her left lung.    The hip cancer was more progressed than we thought because we did not catch it at first because we thought it was arthritis. She had started radiation and one day she stood up and her hip collapsed. she fell down and broke her hip and shoulder.     Right now the cancer in her hip has spread to her pelvic. Sometimes she talks kinda crazy. She doesn't know what she is saying. Right know she is uncontrollably twitching. (not bad mostly in her feet and arms) She is bed bound. Today we were told that we would not be doing kimo. That it would not effect the cancer. She has a appointment with cancer treatment center of america. She has not started kimo but has had i believe 16 radiation treatments on her hip.      Please tell me if there are ANY treatments availble or ANY places we could go.

For the past few days I've had a burning sensation after urinating... but for the past couple of days, this has been accompanied by an increasing amount of blood after urinating.  I've checked, and it IS coming out of my urethra.  There is still burning but it is actually more of a painful thing than a burning sensation now.     I think I may know what caused this.  For the past couple of weeks I've masterbated just about every day, being somewhat rough on the outside of my hole/urethra area.  It became pretty worn pretty quickly, but I didn't stop.  I also had been doing things with the anus area and then going right back to the vaginal area, so I figure that sure didn't help.  Well, anyway, so I was really rough on my parts down there for like 2-3 weeks, and I think that may be what caused this.  I'm hoping it's just a UTI.  I've been drinking a pretty good amount of water... it doesn't seem to be helping.  Any tips??  Should I just go see a doc asap?

20090226074207AA97ayz	Health;Mental Health	What is wrong with me?	Lately I have been angry a lot, mostly at home with my family(sisters and parents) but it seems to be getting worse. Also I never want to get out of bed  anymore or do anything.  Normally I am a quiet and nice person but lately the thoughts that go through my mind about what I really want to say to people are really mean.  Also I grew up with a family that goes to church every Sunday and is very involved in church. I have always loved this about my family and loved going to church but now I hate going to church. It's not that I don't like what they are saying or what they believe I just hate going.    Basically I don't care about anything anymore and I just want to hide in my room and not be bothered.  I don't like being this way and I don't know how to fix it. Oh and the only thing that does fix it is my boyfriend, just a phone call from him cheers me up enough to get going for the day the only problem is right now I can't talk to him.     I don't know what to do and I'm tired of being like this.

(Before the overdose, I had maybe two urinary tract infections that went away after about two days). When I go to the restroom, sometimes when I wipe, a small bit of blood appears on the toilet paper. My urine has been especially dark and I'm not sure what's going on. I have read up on urinary tract infections which leads me to wonder if my kidneys are failing, I am taking antibiotics but they don't seem to be helping. On top of that I have been drinking cranberry juice when I can. I've always barely gone to the restroom and I may go to the restroom a maximum of twice a day.      What do you think?

I had a panic attack so bad when the instructor took attnedance last wednesday that everyone saw including the instructor and it was really awful. I wanted to die. It lasted for about 45 mins. I have not had a bad episode like that in months. All I could do was sit in my chair. I don't know what to do.    If I tell the instructor at least she will know I'm not a freak or weird or something... but I don't want her to think I can't do it or something.      I really feel awful... days later. I feel about as low as I've ever felt.   I am supposed to see at a counsellor at my college but they can't see me for another week. I have gone thru so many therapists (outside of college).

I feel like what is the point of life sometimes, if I have to live like this?       I don't know what to do about this class... I am dreading going again...   any advice?

I am not sure if there is any myth about "muscular people having frequent mood swings, but is there?

I stuck the tampon in, like you're supposed to, with a light period.  I got really horribly high blood pressure and the idea of tampons makes me lightheaded.  I don't get lightheaded for ANYTHING as far as fear goes.  The tampon was uncomfortable, very very painful, so I took it out, and my period got heavier for some reason after I took the tampon out.    I had two questions:  1.  Did my cherry pop or something?  Was that the reason for the pain and blood?  2.  Do I have TSS (I think that's it) because of my such high blood pressure and dizziness?  Should I use tampons again?

Last night i went to the minute clinic for my sinus pain.  the NP felt my lymph nodes and said they're VERY swollen.  no duh!  the right side under my ear is KILLING me!  you know that bump at the base of your skull that's there normally?  well the one on the right side hurts 24/7!  i've taken ibuprofen, tylenol...ugh!  nothing is helping the pain.  then, i have a horribly swollen middle finger on my right hand.  (what is it with my right side??)  i think i pulled a hangnail off last week.  now, the finger is SO swollen on the one side and deep red/purple color and hurts!  it's hot & is throbbing.  is the amoxicillian i'm on for the sinus infection going to  help the finger?   also, how long is it gonna take for the antibiotic to kick in?  i think she said no later than early next week.  my finger also feels like i have a bandaid wrapped VERY tightly around it, but i have nothing on it.  i was soaking it in a disposable shot glass full of hydrogen peroxide.  omg, my finger & head hurt sooo bad!  what can i do for the pain????  should i go to the ER??  thanks.

My first/biggest anxiety/concern/worry/vexation is that I am short.When I am with people who're much taller than me, I feel I am like a dwarf.I'm so upset/nervous, so awkward, so embarrassed, so shy and so shameful. When I am taken a photograph with other people, I feel extremely upset. I want to find a cave/hole on the ground and get into it and never go out. I even wanna  commit suicide. I like a woman, she is also willing to be with me, but I feel inferior and upset because she is slightly taller than me. I avoid to take a photograph with her because I am shorter than me. You can imagine how awkward it is if a photograph of us is taken. What can I do? I still want to live a happy life. What  a miserable person I am.

For eating, try portion control (70% of your diet is food intake but exercise is also important) eating the serving size and if there is no designated serving size, 1cup if it's a meal and 1/2 a cup if it's a snack.      Breakfast- Whenever you choose   Drink of choice- hour after breakfast (all other drinks being water; one cup of drink of choice)   Lunch- 1hr after Drink of choice   Snack- 1/2 cup, 1 hour after lunch   Dinner- 2 hours after snack            For exercise, try switching it up (Monday work on arms, Tuesday work on stomach, Wednesday work on legs, Thursday Rest, Friday Arms, Saturday Stomach, Sunday Legs) though you can choose your own schedule/plan. Try maybe using different machines for stomach or legs or arms so your body doesn't get used to it. Also, try increasing the amount of exercise you do every week.

20090131165707AA6VUBN	Health;Mental Health	Problems with my best friend that I need to sort out? Help!?	Im a little worried about my friend - she has had loads of problems with her family and shes very depressed. She is in Australia at the moment visiting her Grandparents who stay with her uncle in Sydney and shes been fighting with her parents a lot. I spoke to her on skype and she told me shes hasnt been eating properly and stays up all night crying in her room. I feel so bad because I cant help her much and ive been trying to comfort her as much as possible. She says she hates her parents and feel happiest when shes with her friends at college.       Im trying to understand but i have a great relationship with my parents especially my mum. I feel like I dont know what to say incase i say something that will make it worse.       The reason Im worried is that yesterday when i was speaking to her really late in the night (because of the time difference), she told me that she had thought the world would be better without her in it. And she said that shes got a bunch of panadol boxes in case. Then she asked me what would happen if she swallowed like 5 box full doses. I told her not to be silly and told her that she couldnt kill herself before the march episode of smallville came out. (we are huge fans of clois!!)   I was a little shocked she said something like that but i didnt know what to say to her and as it was getting really late for me i had to go to sleep. I havnt spoken to her today because she was going sightseeing. I keep checking skype all the time to see when shes guna come online.      Im really worried - what should I do??? Is 5 box full really really dangerous? I think my mum has her mothers email ad so I could tell my mum but I think if i do something like this then our friendship would be ruined in case she was kidding around and I took it to seriously.      That is the problem i can never tell when she jokes around and when she is serious. Ive also just emailed her saying that she shouldnt jump to conclusions and that I will be there whenever she needs me.      But if she swallows the pills - will it be very dangerous that she needs treatment immediately? I know her parents go out a lot without her and im even more worried incase she does something stupid and no one finds her till the next day.      Help me - what should  I do???????

Let me share it here, hoping that I might understand myself better, through your answers.   I am 21 years old, and a university student at my senior year. I have straight A 's all the time, and, although a stammerer have been praised for my performance. Here comes the issue, I always feel unloved -though I am loved by my family-, even hated! Whenever a misfortune happens to any one around me, I assume automatically that it is my fault. Guilt is predominant in my mind; it feels like I search for anything to feel guilty about. I feel worthless, and of no significance in this world. I catch my self, repeating that 'I am nothing'. I always feel inferior.The reasonable part in my brain says something, then I am pushed to tears by my dark side! Am I out of my mind?

Sometimes she's funny and jokes around, but she has to drink every day and becomes a monster when she drinks vodka.  Attacking us emotionally (she's done it to me and my father and sister multiple times) she gets physically violent, and once when taunting me to punch her, got so angry she began to punch her own face & laugh.  This is such a severe problem.  I'm growing distant from my mom because I can' ttake it anymore.  I haven't lived at home for over 7 years, but I am close to my family and we talk multiple times a week, and they only live ten minutes away.  Her drinking is self destructive, and my dad, I feel sorry for him.  Her rants last hours upon hours, and I don't know what to do.  Alcoholism has killed to of her brothers, both of which took their own lives, and I fear the same for my mom who is a housewive, and always has been.  She has one friend, who I call Grandma, but even she doesn't know about my moms alcohol problem.  My sister and I have been talking about getting her committed to get treatment.  I love my mom very much.  She's the first person I call when I have good news, or bad news.  Sober she is a great woman, but like I said, a monster when she's drunk.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  I don't want to loose this relationship but it is emotionally draining me slowly.  Thanks.

The only thing I can think of is Bi-polar running through my mother's side, my grand mother has it. But I don't have severe mood swings within hours. Have you ever seen the movie 'Lonesome Jim'? That's pretty much how I feel. So should I see a shrink? Or do I need to find a new medication(s)? Please do not say I'm at a young age where I am mentally growing - If every kid at this age felt this way there would be bodies scattered around the world.

20090131201036AAW1msd	Health;Women's Health	Is this a hormone porblem?	Well, alot has happened to me this month. Alot of broken hearts, stress, and trust issues. I talked to my dad and my dad concluded that I was ina state of a hormonal outrage. I was depressed and mad all the time and I'd be perfectly fine the next day.  I also realized at this basketball game that I was very moody and did not seem to wanna talk to anyone and my friends were concerned for me. It was like I was depressed but I did not know why, I was also tired ALOT, yawned ALOT! Then, when I went to dinner I was perfectly alert and talkative... I'm 13 and I have not started my "." yet so I don't know if this is just some kind of sign or what. My parents also insist that I need to get my hormones checked out (I dunno if they were joking...) Well thx for all the love and support all you YA! members give. It helps ALOT when someone contributes something great to help someone else in need. THX AGAIN!

20090131195056AAwfIoR	Health;General Health Care;Pain & Pain Management	BACK PAIN - L5 S1 Issue...?	** I just found this website...and it looks great for advise!      I have a dx of a L5 S1 bulging disk.   My family doctor wants me to go to PT. I found out through our insurance it's $30 a pop for each visit. I have been taking Percocet 5hg off and on as needed for the pain. I am a stay-at-home mom so I have been ONLY taking them when I have needed to leave the house for a kids school function or short shopping. My husband has stepped in to help with shopping and dinners so I don't have to - hurt - through doing it.      I have been keeping my Percocet's for trips out that I HAVE to take one or two which is not often so I have a few left. I am in no way addicted I will only take one when leaving the house which is rare now.      My back causes me so much pain that I can shower then sit about 10 minutes -- then dry my hair -- sit again another 10(ish) minutes and then finish up with makeup and dressing. Standing or walking for longer than 15 minutes is very painful and even sometimes after a couple of hours it feels like no pain med is present. I primarily sit all day other than doing things around the house so standing for long periods is not painful.      Last time I talked to the nurse at the office she said she wants me to go to the PT and if that doesnt work to go back in and see him and the next step is a Neuro? I have NO idea what the PT will be and how long.....but at $30 a visit I don't even know how often weekly or biweekly I would have to go........      ~ Any suggestions on which way to turn -- I am tired of the pain and this has only been happening about a year and only pain med's taken off and on ( more off than on) for the last 3 months. I have only gone through 60 tablets in 3 months.....      Thanks for any advise =)

20090131154057AAS7a3V	Health;General Health Care;Pain & Pain Management	Endocet (subst. for Perocet) vs Advil?	Ok, here's the situation...   I broke my leg last Sunday, about 6 days ago, had surgery on it, they put in a Titanium 'rod' and screwed the 2 broken pieces back together, I have 3 fractured vertebrates in my back, and I was on Morphene (spelling?) until Tuesday morning.  They switched me to Percocet after that, usually taking 2 tablets every 4 hours for the pain.  It's Saturday now, they released me Wednesday afternoon, gave me a prescription for something 'like' Percocet, and told me to take that according to the pain.  I've USUALLY been taking only 1 every 4 hours, sometimes taking 1 more before the 4 hrs is up to help with the pain (for the leg, mostly) and I'm trying to decide whether to try and switch off of the stuff and go to 2-3 Advils instead, taking that according to the 'hourly rate' on the Advil bottle.  Reason being, the Percocet 'look-alike' is probably somewhat hard on the stomach, and (I think) makes me light-headed when I get up, sometimes dizzy, and sometimes short of breath.  I think some of that may be due to the pills that I'm currently on.  As an f.y.i.: I'm not on any other med's or drugs, and I don't smoke.  I figured there'd be other people out there that know more about doing the 'switch' than me... Any ideas? What do you guys think?      I'm sorry it's just a big block of text :P      Oh, and sometimes I do take 2 pills at the 4hr mark for the pain.  Sometimes it's worse than other times.      Thanx!

She's really sweet and all but she has such low self-esteem. She likes this guy that doesn't even know she exists (I know it's immature sounding) and she thinks because he doesn't check her out, she's automatically "ugly" and "obese". My friends and I have tried to cheer her up, but she thinks we're lying to her. She always says "You guys are so lucky you have boyfriends and you're so pretty". She keeps saying she's going to commit suicide because she hates her life so much. We've tried recommending counseling and guidance hot lines but she refuses to call or attend. She tells her mom she's going to kill herself and it makes her mom cry. We told her to get involved in activities and she's learning hip-hop dancing, but that doesn't seem to help. She always wears a big jacket and a baseball-style cap to school and she walks staring at her feet. Every time she sees the guy she likes she either runs away or covers her face until he leaves. She's absent from school almost everyday and every time she is, my friends and I are scared she's going to commit suicide. Can anyone suggest what we should do for her? I would really appreciate it!!

20090131160237AA7lXC4	Health;Diseases & Conditions;STDs	Do I have herpes or not?	-- This is for people that know something about herpes/testing.      First let me describe my outbreak. There were three really tiny red bumps and one slightly larger one (about the size of a pimple). They didn't feel like anything, and I didn't have any other symptoms of herpes type II. I had sex with two girls, and one of them said she had cold sores. Her doctor said she couldn't have given them to me because it had been too long since she had a cold sore and she wouldn't have been "shedding." (this girl gave me oral, and if it wasn't her, it was the other girl who claims to be std free).      Nevertheless, the doc diagnosed it as herpes after a physical. I took a bloodtest the same day (he said I was wasting my money), and the test came back negative. It had been about three weeks since the last sexual encounter when I took the test. I had a 0.00 range for type II, meaning no antibodies were in my system. Now my doctor is basically saying I don't have herpes and he doesn't know what the lesions were....basically, he didn't diagnose it correctly or he doesn't know anything about testing and how accurate they are even during a small breakout like I had. What am I do make of this? Does the body produce more antibodies during a breakout?    And What else could these little bumps have been?

I don't want to put something in there, I have a thing about anything getting near my eyeball, so I've been waiting all day for my eye to just water it out or something, but it's still there.      Is it dangerous to leave it? Will it come loose itself or will it get infected? I don't even know if that's possible.

20090131200051AAaiAJk	Health;General Health Care;Injuries	I injured my thumb (tendon) and need to know if i need to go to the hospital?	I was playing football a little over a week ago. i dove to tackle this kid and came up short. as he was running the back of his heel came up and extended the middle joint of my thumb all the way in to my palm. it hurt far beyond a simple bump when i sustained the injury to where i knew it might have been something serious. I figured the most the doctors would do was put a splint on it and/or give me pills for the pain. since being pain free wouldn't actually heal it i didn't need them. so i skipped the whole outrageous hospital bill and bought an Ace bandage at the drug store. Following the injury, i had no strength in the damaged thumb whatsoever. It was bad enough that i couldn't even click a pen. Because it was the first two days following the injury, I assumed it was just sore. but its been 9 days and i still have no strength and the pain is just as bad as it was the morning after the injury. Given I'm only 17, my best assumption would be the most obvious from what i noted; I teared the tendon and it just needs to heal. The question I'm asking is do I need to have it looked at by a doctor in case the tear is serious enough to need to be reattached. And how long can i wait before it's too late to reattach it (including the 9 days I've already waited)?

I have always shaved my arms, since I was like 12, stupid, I know, but oh well.  I usually just shave my arms in the shower from my wrist to my elbow because that is the part that gets seen most.        Well today I noticed I had some pretty intense hair growing from my elbow to my shoulder and I was trying to hurry and get out the door so I real quick took a razor and shaved without and water or soap or anything at all.      Now, it is red and sore and very tender and hurts like heck.  It almost feels like carpet burn.  I'm sure it's razor burn.  I tried putting lotion on them but that just made them sting like heck.      Has anyone else ever done anything this stupid?  How do you sooth it?  Please help me out.  Thanks!

20090131144020AAHfJZC	Health;Mental Health	My mom is bipolar... any help?	She's crazy. She has not been diagnosed but it's not for lack of trying on my part. I have read that people with bipolar disorder often go through denial and refuse to get help, and that's how she is.      Today was a bad day. First, one of our electrical outlets wasn't working and she couldn't plug in her laptop. She flipped out and started screaming at my dad like it was his fault. He found an outlet tester which said everything was working with the outlet and she screamed some more even though all he was trying to do was help.      Later, she asked my dad to help with something and he laughed at something in general (NOT at her) and she went completely psycho and said she wanted a divorce and that she hoped he got hit by a truck.      Most of the time it's me that she's yelling at, not my dad, because with 24 years of marriage, he's much better at dealing with her and rarely yells back. I, however, am not so good at dealing with her when she's mad and I can't help but yell back when I did nothing to deserve her rants. It's getting to the point where I just avoid her because I have lived 15 years like this, and I'm not sure how much more I can take.      She also exhibits the other symptoms of bipolar disorder, such as mania (when she's happy, shes VERY happy, and will often walk around the house singing or asking me and my dad to "snuggle" with her) and depression (when she's sad, she won't talk to anyone and she overeats). This makes me sure she's bipolar, but it hasn't gotten me anywhere as she will not listen.

20090131145854AARPsYE	Health;Mental Health	My girl friend (29) is depressed and has unresolved emotional problems, how can I convince her to get help?	I'm probably guilty of projecting my own experiences here, but my girl friend is having a very difficult time enjoying life. She's european, living in the UK. Her mum is very ill abroad (cancer), her brother (27) has a history of depression. Her last relationship was emotionally abusive. Her grandparents died in the last 12 months. She's doing a less rewarding job than the one she is qualified to do. She's living in a flat share that she does not enjoy. She refuses to talk about things which might be causing her pain or upsetting her. Her outlook on life is very bleak. I had a similar experience a couple of years back and found that counselling resolved painful issues and completely transformed my outlook on life. She's now considering a big geographical move. She's anxious and often miserable whilst sometimes rude and offensive to me. My piece of mind and self-esteem are being eroded and I have begged her to get some professional help. I have not shouted or been rude to her, but have told her that I can no longer see her unless she gets help. I have been asking for around a year now, and no longer feel that I can support her on my own, and by doing so I am enabling her to avoid getting outside help.      She won't follow my suggestions, she won't do it for my sake, so now it's come to an ultimation and I feel dreadful.       Any advice would be welcome.   Thanks,   O
20090131151314AAENonU	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	My friends Pupils aren't the same size, Brain tumor?	Hi,    So, my friends pupils aren't the same size. It vareys through out the day, sometimes its not that noticeable and sometimes it very different sizes. It started 6 days, almost 7 days ago. We are some what worried about it being a brain tumor, for several reason. One, is I've heard from 2 or 3 people that this means she has pressure in her head. Another reason is she had a Camel Crush cigarette (ONE.), which we found out afterward recently got recalled because it's a leading cause in brain tumors. (I know, tobacco can do that, but this certain cigarette can create one, apparently.)    She is going to see a doctor as soon as possible, But it would be nice to have an idea of whats wrong and if we need to worry or not.      Thanks in advance,   -Sarah.
20090131151529AAJTv4W	Health;Dental	How much would dental insurance cost for a 26-year old single male?	I have never had any kind of insurance before, except car insurance. My parents always paid for doctor visits/etc. out of pocket because we were fairly well off, and they didn't think it was worth it, or something, I dunno. Anyway, I know nothing about insurance. I very rarely get sick, so I don't see any reason to get full health insurance, but I do want to get dental because they need cleaning and also the two wisdom teeth on top of my mouth have gotten bad because I can't reach them w/ a brush - they're almost completely pushed to the sides of my mouth out of alignment with the rest. I didn't realize they were that bad until I got a dental scaler/pick/mirror combo to try to clean a little myself and saw them. They probably just should be removed, which is why I'm looking at plans. Anyway, how does it work - I pay a price per month and they pay for the dental work, or what? Where is best place to go online for price? Thanks for constructive help.

I'm chubby, out-of shape, and not a very social person.      People keep telling me to "Pick yourself up", "Get over it", and go find work. OKAY. I am trying. But this is the only interview I've had in months and I feel really unqualified.      Should I go and hope for the best? Or should I be realistic? What else could I do?

20090226080840AAs60g7	Health;General Health Care;Injuries	Bad fall during skiing a week ago?	About a week ago, my dad took a bad fall during skiing.  He had other sort of bad falls before that, and then at the end he just had a really bad one where he thinks he like hit his head or something.  After that, he was saying his head hurt, and his neck.  Also, we went out for dinner after, and he was forgetting things easily.  Like we ordered dinner, and a few minutes after he couldn't remember what he ordered, or anything.  For the rest of the day, he said he was kind of out of it, and that night his neck was really stiff, and he had very bad pain.  I remember him taking 2 Advils.  Since then, he's telling me that he has had very bad headaches adn have had to take Advil every day.  We go to the chiropractor 3x a week, and it helps a LOT but our chiropractor fractured his wrist.  Another girl came in, but she wasn't that good, and didn't help much.  He ended up having neck pains almost right after the adjustment (I also went in sick- I just found out I have a sinus and ear infection- and walked out worse, so I know that he's just not saying that).  I keep telling him he should go to the doctor or something, and he just keeps saying, "Oh maybe I'll go in a couple of days, see how if it changes."  Is he right, or should he go to the doctor?  What do you think is wrong?

20090131190832AAZGccI	Health;Mental Health	Substitute for Anxiety Meds?	To be honest with you, I've never taken any anxiety medication because it scares the crap out of me. I have had anxiety since I was probably about 12. I feel like I am in a "fog" and within the past couple of years I've gotten panic attacks. I know it has a lot to do with my childhood, it was a rough one. Anxiety is something that I am thinking about 24-7, I cannot stop it's terrible. I just went to the dr and she immediately said "here take this" it was zoloft. I read the side effects and the thought alone of any of that happening to me makes me crazy. I am not a seriously depressed person that wants to end my life I just have problems with my anxiety! My relationship with my Fiance hasn't been so well because of my problem. I tend to be lazy have no sex drive, I'm tired a lot, very very moody and my trust issues are terrible. I just received the program "attacking anxiety and depression" and I want to try that. I do not want to take the meds I have in my purse that the dr prescribed me. I know I need to start exercising, and I am also going to start a yoga class, I'll probably keep a journal as well...What vitamins can I take to help with my nervous system and to keep my anxiety down? I know any B-Complex is good, what else? Please help me! Thank you.
