20080711205320AAftgwY	Pregnancy & Parenting;Baby Names	Is it weird for sisters to have a same middle name? Explain.?	Ok well, this will be my last baby name question. I love the name Zoey Emma Paige (last name). I also have another name, but I need a second middle name for it and I can't find one I like, so I was thinking to just use Paige as its second middle name too. So then it would be: Mia Sophie Paige.    Is it weird to use Paige in both names? Explain your answer.      Thanks in advance!

20090222231019AADwHWv	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	People who kill babies/children...?	What punishments do you think people who kill babies or children should get? Also, if a person accidentally kills a child (like Shaken Baby Syndrome) because they lose their temper, should they get the same punishment as people who purposely kill a baby or child (Casey Anthony)?        I think that their punishment should be 1. getting sterilized with any anesthetic, for men getting castrated, 2. stuck in prison for the rest of their lives. and 3. be in general population while wearing a shirt that says I'm a baby killer.       I'm very compassionate and liberal on many things, this however is not one of them.
20090222234253AA1hN6n	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	WHAT SHOULD I DO? I AM PREGNANT?????????	i am pregnant and 13 yrs old. does my mum need to know about me getting a abortion? adoption is not an option
20090222233318AAyA33W	Pregnancy & Parenting;Grade-Schooler	My mother-in-law really insulted my little girl, but I don't know what to do?	My daughter turned 9 years old recently. In the moment, she is having a hard time. She is a young "bloomer" and she is beginning puberty. Her breasts are starting to develop and she is getting rounder hips. So basically, she is already a little self conscience. And as we all know with puberty comes mood swings. I'll admit that my daughter can be trying at times.    Well she spent the weekend at her grandparents' house (my in-laws). They were supposed to be getting ready for a festival where you get dressed up in costumes. My daughter was up to her usual gimmicks (messing around and not focusing on getting ready) and she really made my mother-in-law angry. My daughter's costume wouldn't close in the back and my mother-in-law said to her "Well if you weren't so damn fat then maybe it would close!"    Now she isn't even close to what would be considered overweight. She is very tall for her age (takes after my husband), but she is a healthy weight for her height. My daughter was really hurt by this comment and she told me about it immediately when she got home.    My daughter told me that her grandmother apologized later for making this comment, but the damage is already done. I'm really mad because I was overweight as a child and I got teased a lot and I know how it hurts. And my daughter has no reason to be insulted. I feel like of all the people in the world to be insulted by, it definitely shouldn't be coming from your own grandparent!   On the other side, I also feel like my daughter has to take responsibility for her actions. We all say things that we don't mean when we are angry. And it could be possible that my daughter pushed my mother-in-law to the limit.    I don't know, how would you feel as a parent in this situation?   Thanks!

20081010052428AAoxwrY	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Anyone have an accidental VBAC?	I'm debating on trying for a VBAC, but still very undecided.  So I was wondering if anyone had had their csection scheduled, but went into labor before the scheduled csection if they ended up still having a csection or if there were circumstances (and what they might have been) that led them to have an "accidental" VBAC?  Thanks!
20081119104224AAFnQrL	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Repeat Csection: Elective or Medically Necessary?	So my insurance policy will change for 2009 and it simply states that elective csections will not be covered.  But csections will be covered if medically necessary.  WELL what about scheduled repeat csections??  My dr left it up to me whether I wanted to try for a VBAC or not and offered very little opinion but i still feel she would rather me do a repeat so among other things i decided i'll most likely do a scheduled repeat.  BUT now i'm not sure if it will be covered or if I have no choice but to go for a VBAC?  I'm sure a VBAC would be fine but I dont like not having the choice....  Anyone know whether repeat csections would be considered medically necessary?  Thanks!!

20090222223723AAIfQs1	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Is it possible to still get knocked up?	About two weeks ago I had unprotected sex.  The guy did not come inside of me but of course, I know it's still possible for one of his boys to "howdy ma'am!" one of my girls...  Anyway, a day after I got my period but it only lasted 3 days.  I am now experiencing some dull headaches and lousy nausea.  I have made an appointment to see my doctor this Tuesday but was wondering if something similar might have occured to any mothers out there.   If I do have a biscuit in the oven, I will be happy.  That is the honest to goodness truth.  If I am not, well, this old girl will certainly have learned her lesson!

20090222231832AA0UA42	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	What should I bring to a homebirth?	Hi I am the assistant to a busy home-birth midwife and I have been given the opportunity to be there for the home-birth of one of her clients. I am watching their one year old daughter and taking pictures for them. If the daughter is asleep while the baby is being born I will also be labor support. Last time (my second birth first home-birth) I went to a birth I was very unprepared and only had my cell phone and the clothes on my back. Labor lasted over 24 hours and I had no food, proper clothes, etc. so I'm trying to be more prepared this time. Here's what I have so far:    Scrubs (comfy+logical)    Tea 4 caf 2 decaf for me and midwife    blankie (in case I have to sleep there)    small pillow   bible (I read it every night)   journal   two snacks      Is there anything else I'm forgetting? I know that the chance of me using all of this stuff is variable and since it's a birth there's no way to know how it will go, I'm just trying to be more prepared. Better safe than sorry, right?       Thanks!

So im not exactly getting my hopes up, but i have a good feeling about this month. Also how many days past ovulation do you start to get pregnancy symptoms?

For the past week she has been waking up at sometimes 12, sometimes 3 sometimes earlier or later screaming and sweating in her cot.  She goes to bed fine and then wakes up so upset!  We go in and pick her up for a cuddle and shes fine, try putting her back down and she clings to you screaming again.  This can happen for up to an hour every night until eventually she falls back to sleep and is then absolutely fine during the day.  She has always been a great sleeper from about 3 months old (sleeping 7-7).  What could be causing this sudden waking and will it ever end!!??

If you had children who were split up, wouldn't you let them know that they have a sibling somewhere?      I sure as heck would be mad if I had a brother or sister, and I didn't know about it until way later in life, or even at all.

20090223012620AAbXS8e	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	Can birth control hormones cause you to want children?	I've been on birth control since I was 15. Mostly the pill, and since June I've been on Implanon. For about the past year, I've wanted children. I considered them before, but never really decided I wanted them until the past year. My husband thinks the hormones in the implant are causing me to want children. Personally, I think it's BS especially considering how long I've been on birth control (I'm almost 20), but I was wondering if he might have a point. Is that possible? Or is he just not ready to face the fact that I want children?      P.S. In case anyone was wondering, I don't really want them now. Sure, if I found out I was pregnant I'd be really happy, but realistically I don't think this is the right time in either of our lives to be planning on having children. I was thinking in a few years we'd discuss trying.

20090222234424AA5YS8e	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	My daughter has a strange obsession with Nazis?	My 14 year old daughter has an obsession reading about the Nazis and and the Third Reich, she actually said she would have liked to have been a Nazi, and for some strange reason seems to be in awe with them. We are actually Jewish though and are religious Jews, so I'm not sure why she's been acting like this. She's recently been saying that she needs to get a nose job and dye her hair so she can look "Aryan". I don't know why she thinks like this but I think some people at her school have said some bad things about Jews to her in the past. Then the last time we were going to go to our synagogue I told her to get ready and she came downstairs to meet me at the door dressed up in a ridiculous costume she got for herself with a Nazi armband (a female Nazi officer I guess it was suppose to be), of course I didn't let her come dressed like that. What should I do about her and the way she's been thinking lately?       (also please, only serious answers)

20090223015333AAmGiWD	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Does our society have a hypocritical standard on pregnancy?	I've not met a person who's actually willing to say       "If the mother can't feed the child, let them starve, it's not our fault she gave birth to them"      Or "Sure. it's not the child's fault, but it's not OUR fault either"      Which goes to say, that if a child is born, we are all obligated to feed this person and protect his/her rights.       If this is how our society values life and responsibility, wouldn't the next most responsible step be, to make it illegal or condemnable for people who are financially incapable to have children?      We say "freedom to reproduce" "right to life" when it's not our pocket, but it IS. If we all have to pay for a child whose mother cannot pay, shouldn't we have the right to say that the child shouldn't be born?      If you say "it's none of our business if they have children", then shouldn't we be willing to let poor children starve to death? Isn't feeding children whose parents cannot, simply encouraging and enabling irresponsible behavior?       A child is no joke, you can't ditch it or sell it if you regret it later.
20081015085906AAkvsZW	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Ladies, please help!!?	Ok, for the last 5 days or so I have been getting really bad legs cramps during the day and also at night time, they are like tight muscle cramps that hurt really bad.   And then about two days ago I started getting a pain in my lower left abdomen, not a sharp pain just a nagging pain, it also is very tender to the touch.   I would like to mention that my husband and I haven't had protected intercourse since my daughter was born almost 1 year ago.   I had my last period on the 29th of last month/sept.   We aren't trying to prevent pregnancy and we also aren't trying to get pregnant either, if we get blessed with another child then so be it.   So my question to you ladies is, do you know why I might be getting these horrible tight leg cramps and why I might be getting that pain?   I was thinking maybe a tubal pregnancy but I am not too sure.   I will be going to the hospital but I would rather get some idea's from you guys first because waiting time there is between 5-11 hours and I have a little one.   Any idea to what could be causing this?   Thank you in advance.

Before you read:   this is just cause im curious to know people's opinion.   i'm NOT planning on doing this i am not sick..lol. i just want to know what you think so dont start calling me names cause i posted this quesiton. just so you know.

20090223020501AAE9sVG	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	How do you convince a teenager that they aren't ready for a baby?	My barely 18 year old sister felt that she was smarter than her parents and ran off and moved in with an 18 year old boy to an apt.  They can barely pay their rent.  They barely have money for food. In fact people buy them food all the time because they can't afford food.  Neither one of them have college aspirations.      I am SO upset in so many ways by the two of them thinking they are ready for a family.  The boy is glorifying Medicaid.  They think medicaid is the answer to all their problems.  My sister was fired from a daycare job because of the way she was treating the kids!!!  Now she thinks she can be a parent!??   I am a supporter in government assistance programs... when people NEED it, not when you intentionally do something like get pregnant when you know you can't afford it.  She won't listen to reason!  She thinks she can take care of this child when she she is still a child herself.   Plus she has anger issues which scares me that she would hurt a colicky newborn.   I am upset because I feel like this baby will not have a great life.. and I feel that these two are abusing government assistance and i also feel sad that my sister is throwing away her future.  If she has this baby, statistics favor that she'll never go to college.  Also, i feel like my parents will end up getting stuck with taking care of the baby when its not their responsibility.   She is so hard headed and won't listen to anyone.  She will not consider adoption or abortion.   How can someone get through to these kids?

20090223001120AA8M3Fs	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	How do I or what should I do when it comes to losing a child in the family.?	My daughter is 2 years old and while she didn't see her cousin very often it was enough that looking at photos she knew her name. 2 weeks ago my niece passed away from complication from CP and SIDs, she was 7 months old. We went to the wake but I refused to allow my daughter to see my niece in her casket and she didn't go to the funeral. A week ago her great grandfather passed away so we went to another funeral. Now my question is should I try to explain to my daughter about the death of her cousin,  ( she had only met her great grandfather once and doesnt know him at all) or should i let it be and not really show her any photos for awhile. We simply said that everyone one was crying because grace went bye bye at the time, now i want to know what we should do from here on out. She will be seeing her aunt soon with out her cousin and that's never really happened except for the wake. Any advice would be great.

20090223023339AADhooi	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	My daughter is very upset and depressed, what can I do?	I adopted my daughter, I had her as a foster child first and recently adopted her. She is 13 but is very frail and petite and has Cerebral Palsy and is confined to a wheelchair. Her birth mother was recently killed in a terrible accident, and although my daughter was and not with her when it happened, when she found out about her death she totally broke down. When she's awake she's very clingy with me and I hold her, and she hates when I let her go for even a few minutes. She cries so much and she will often cry herself to sleep then she will suck her thumb all night. Even though her birth mother wasn't able to take good enough care of her she obviously she still loved her and felt attached to her and hoped someday she could be able to take care of her. (I don't have any other children and I'm all she has now)   I brought a therapist to see her but she hasn't said hardly a word to the therapist so far, she won't really even speak to anyone now besides me for that matter   What should I do to make her feel better and improve her mindset?

This month I took Clomid (100mg) from days 3 - 7 and I usually get my period right smack 28 days later. I also get cramping, pale spotting to let me know it's on it's way. I took a pregnancy test yesterday with dilute not first morning urine the day before my period was due. It was a clearblue digital which I think can need more hcg than usual but it was negative. This isn't like my body to be late and its showing now signs of getting here. Has anyone else experienced this? I will retest in a couple of days but just curious to see if anyone else has had this happen. Oh and we had loads of sex this month deliberately to cover the days I could be ovulating,.

20090223023215AAvoJfg	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	To go to daycare or to stay home (kind of long, sorry)?	I need a little help. My son is 5 1/2 months old. Friday night he was eating constantly, about 20 oz in 4 hrs. I'm not exaggerating. Then Saturday he was eating fairly normal and sleeping a lot, we figured he was going through a growth spurt, no biggie.       Saturday night he stayed at his grandparents and they said they couldn't hardly get the bottle outta his mouth, then the projectile spit up, 2-3 times and was fussy. They gave him some Mycolin, which didn't really help. He felt warm so they gave him some Tylenol. He ate some more and went to sleep.       Sunday he was ok, sill spitting up but not too bad. Sunday night he was kind of fussy and felt warm. We took his temp and it was 98.9 F or 99.9 F. He has been coughing and sneezing occasionally all weekend.       I want to keep him home from daycare today, just to be cautious, and my husband thinks he'll be ok. Who's right? Which should we do?      ps Thanks for taking time to read this!!!

20090223022101AABdZ1h	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Is there any accommodation facility for pregnant women and their families around Pasadena, CA?	I heard that there is, and some pregnant women stay there and have birth at the hospital nearby.   I asked this person, who informed/mentioned about this facility on her website, where it is and what the name of  that "maternity center" or so she calls.   But she said    "It's a privacy thing, so I cannot tell you now"      Well, Ronald McDonald House wouldn't say   "Oh, we cannot tell our address due to a privacy issue."      Anyway since she doesn't wanna tell me details, I'm trying to figure out about "Maternity Center" -- the facility for pregnant/postpartum women...      Do you know anything about it?
