YXgVGjHlaa	You should lose weight by eating less and drinking water instead of soft drinks.  Also running or walking a mile a day is very helpful.  Stay with your healthy diet but eat very few sweets and less carbs.|`|682c8e893b340ad95efea989a0db4ffaaa	nope. i just finished reading a very in depth book on health, and they say that the best way to burn fat is to build muscle, because muscle burns 50 times more calories than fat alone. So, first i recommend doing some crunches, but also doing the rest of your core (obliques, lower abs, pecs) not to get big bulk, but to tone them into shape for burning off the fat. while running a mile everyday and drinking lots of water wont hurt (the running may be harmful to your body if you don't already have a daily schedule) it alone wont give you results. Walking a half hour a day is a much better idea, it is less stressful on bones, and builds upp leg muscle to burn thigh fat too. also, if your belly fat isnt just the fat on top of our muscle (i.e. when you tighten your abs your belly fat is underneath that, and don't lie to yourself in the mirror) that that is you omentum, which is a tissue that hangs off your stomach and stores fat, and is very harmful for your health if not taken care of because it pushes on all your abdominal organs and can damage them. the best way to get rid of you omentum fat is to get into a routine for a bit of cardio, muscle toning (and building if you prefer)  and getting into a good diet full of natural foods such as fruits vegetables, protiens such as chicken and fish, and also omega 3 fatty acids, found in nuts and fish. if you look up the book YOU: On a diet, it will not only help you get rid of that fat, but will help set a lifelong standard for health.    P.S. no i didn't write that book, but i have read it 3 times and reccomend it to all my friends. Since i've started my new lifestyle i feel GREAT! and look great too. and remember thers no such thing as quick weight loss. A fast will not work, because any weight you may lose will come right back (and when you lose it, you lose muscle, as well as fat, and when you regain it without exercise, it is all fat)|`|3kKlGfy7aa	yea eventually but you have to push your self and every day go a little farther in running and make shure you dont starve yourself dont eat less but more helthey|`|66UMlUISaa	The formula for losing weight is simple - consume less and move more often - the difficulties surface when we actually try to put that into operation!

Weight gain happens when you create a calorie surplus (eat more than you burn). Your body takes the excess calories and converts them to fat which get stored around your stomach, arms and thighs. The longer you remain in a calorie surplus, the more weight you'll gain. To lose that weight, you need to do the opposite. You need to create a calorie deficit (start eating less than you burn).     Your first step is to figure out how many calories you burn on a daily basis. This calculator will help you out http://calorieneedscalculator.com The number you get from this tool is what your body burns on a daily basis. To lose weight, simply eat less. It sounds a lot easier than it is but making small changes helps you adjust to a new lifestyle. Don't think of this as a diet, think of it as a new life. Instead of eating foods high in sugars, white flour and saturated fat, go with fruits, vegetables, whole wheats, fish, lean meats, nuts and beans. In addition to eating less, you also need to exercise more. Start off at 1-2 times per week and work your way up to 3-5 times per week.    Don't make all of these changes at once or you won't be able to properly adjust to them. Generally, eating healthier foods will decrease your calorie intake. Compare a doughnut to an apple and you'll see that healthy foods are lower in calories.

Get a chair, make sure it's sturdy and get on it with one leg do high knee jerks, and repeat that.  I do this at night, keeps me active.

kFU8pyRGaa	I would recommend you include some strength training. It activates your metabolism. Also, a pound of muscle burns 10 times as many calories as a pound of fat. Therefore, the more muscle you build the more fat you will lose.|`|8SRjELNBaa	So here's what i'd recommend.  I'm looking at a 16.9 oz. bottle of water (normal costco size water bottle) and if your drinking only two of those a day, thats not enough.  In terms of my bottle size, you should try and go for a bottle with every meal sitting.  Water helps fill you up for zero calories.  Plus it's just overall important for vital organ functions.    I think you can cut out the ranch with your carrots, you're going to be fine managing without it & it's just fewer calories your taking in.    Your workout looks fine but try to add 10 more extra minutes to your running routine.  10 minutes isn't much but you'll feel better knowing you did 40, versus just 30.  30 seems like the bare minimum these days.|`|0SKMhdZyaa	sounds like you have a good start but need more weight training in your routine, the more you build up your musle mass, the faster your resting metabolism and hense, ability to loose wait faster.     I'd also recommend eating more protien throughout the day - perhaps through in a shake or two. You'll start to see results if you keep to your work out at least 4 times a week and eating well.     Good luck!

I was 5'3.5 and 148 pounds. The way I lost 20 pounds was gradually eating less. At first it'll be hard because you feel like you're not full yet. But eating less is similar to working out, you gradually get used to what you're doing. So, first cut out just a little what you're eating for the first month. Cut out a little more every month and your body will grow to accept smaller amounts. I was an eating monster a few months ago and now I can't even get past 3/4 of a course. Next, developing muscles. Developing muscles is beneficial because you are allowed to eat more, and you don't have to be way too active. Only thing active you need to do is maintaining your muscles' condition. Buy a pair of weights and don't be afraid to get sore. I'm sure if you're already good at track, lifting weights will make you even faster. I won't get into the science behind it but lifting weights, even though you're working the arm muscle, makes you run faster. Speed requires heavy weights and low reps and endurance requires light - medium weights with high reps. Hope this helps with losing belly and training, if you're planning to|`|xqVDTxoYaa	I don't mean to sound mean here, but you have nothing to complain about!!!  Your weight is perfect for your body.  I myself am 5'3 and I weigh A LOT more than you do.  I think I'm 175 right now.  And I don't think I look obese, but I do have a slight pudge.  But if you did want to flatten your belly, all you'd have to do would be crunches, or some sit-ups.  Running or even just walking can increase the firmness of your thighs and can also ease you into doing other exercises.  What I would not recommend, however, is to "crash diet" or starve yourself.  Starving yourself actually has the opposite affect of what you'd think it has.  If you eat a lot less, your body will  think it's starving and will hold on to fat cells in order to preserve fat and nutrients.  Also a good tip to remember:  The faster you lose the weight, the faster it can all be gained back, so pace yourself.      I know in high school you get judged by the way you look, but you might not realize how much your self-confidence shows on the outside, either.  More self-confidence can lead to you feeling better about yourself and can lead to others looking at you differently.      And try not to be so down on yourself.  You're only 16.  My father always said you can eat whatever you want while you're young, just exercise and it'll take care of itself.  Good luck in high school and keep your chin up!!!|`|yn0FXozCaa	go to lifewithhealthandwealth.isagenix.com and isamovie.com watch that video then email me at kierra.poulos@gmail.com this stuff is all natural and helps you loose weight.

WkaWSKNAaa	It is hard to tell if the bulimia caused the conditions.  Spina bifida is what is called a neural tube defect and occurs in the first few weeks of pregnancy for unknown reasons.  That is why it is so important for women considering getting pregnant to take vitamins with folic acid.  It is proven to reduce the chance of neural tube defects, and those first few weeks of pregnancy is when the folic acid is most effective.  Once you find out you're pregnant it's often too late.

So yes, I do believe it could have been possible, but as I said this is just my personal opinion based on what I have read about nutrition and formation of the fetus.

YVRXdfGHaa	I don't think there is a single guy in the whole world who is going to worry about what your nipples look like. By the time they get to the point of seeing them, he's going to be so happy he's there, that all he will be interested in doing is kissing and sucking on them.    That's really a small matter to us. It may be a biggie for you, but we certainly aren't going to be turned off by the lack of nipples sticking out.|`|Afzknn9Laa	I just want you to know, you're not alone. I also have inverted nipples. I'm really self conscious about them too. I honestly don't know if inverted nipples ever grow out. Sometimes they do, sometimes they don't. There are some things you an do to help. Although I wouldn't really recommend these, you could get surgery or you could get your nipples pierced. Something I wouldn't mind trying is something like a suction cup pregnant women use for when they breastfeed.     I'm 14 years old so I'm just a year older than you and living in the type of society we're in now, it's hard knowing that I have this "thing" and no one knows. I'm also scared that when I do plan to have sex, the guy I'm with won't find me attractive anymore. But I hear many guys don't mind at all and kind of enjoy it because they like trying to make the nipple hard. So please don't be scared. If you're brave enough to get over this, I'll try to get over it also.|`|om4Szik7aa	It could be possible that you have inverted nipples. Some people have that, it's nothing to be embarrassed about.

Inverted nipples tend to stay inverted even when you are cold. If I were you I would pull on your nipples gently when you see them out. This will pull the nipple tissue a little and hopefully they will say out all the time.  http://www.plasticsurgery4u.com/inverted...|`|g6pqGjrkaa	do not worry nothing will happen as you thing but before taking bath you just apply olive oil or pure coconut oil and gently messuage your small head of the breast nipples  without hard messauge for abour 45 days the nipple will get the stage as other females have.
emNCaAq7aa	They release in third stage sleep. That comes about 4-6 times a night. It is deep dreamless (non REM) sleep. If you have apnea or are in pain that causes you to wake often you do not get a good release.  It has nothing to do with exact time but it does have to do with your circadian rhythm. For most normal schedule people the deepest sleep comes at about 5 a.m. Being in as complete a darkness as possible is important to the release.|`|I8MUpN04aa	no, they don't come out at a certain time. its the same as anything in your body, hormones are just slowly released when the brain decides it is time to release them.
ZVDboZkPaa	Lack of oxygen to the brain.    The commonest cause is lack of oxygen to the baby's brain during the birthing process and happens when the umbilical cord is pinched and insufficient blood comes from the mother or there is a delay in getting the baby to breathe with its own lungs.    After that the next one is premature birth and the baby's body being unable to get sufficient oxygen into the brain due to particular organs not being sufficiently developed.    Then there are the various things that cause a baby to stop breathing, I don't know the timings offhand but I do know that it is a very short time before damage starts to take place, less than a minute, because babies are so small.    After that are accidents to the baby's brain which cause CP but these are not common.    If you are in the United Kingdom then you should get in touch with the Cerebral Palsy charity called Scope and they will be able to advise you.|`|a4kTbjfeaa	Here is some info on cerebral palsy:  http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/...

AA12316174	Do you have to be a certain age to go? Old enough to ask      Do you have to bring a parent?NO it is confidential       What is the process of getting birth control pills? you have to fill out paper work when you get to the office, they will let you now if you qualify for free or dicounted services before you go in. You will goin to see the DR they will go over your paperwork and examine you with a pelvic exam and a pap smear. then they will discuss which method or pill is best for you     Do you have to be examined?  YES they cannot dispense birth control without an exam if you have had an exam in the previous 12 months then you will have to get those results and THEN you can skip the exam at planned parenthood      How much do they cost?The exam up to 140 pills up to 30 a  month       Are the pills as safe as the ones your doctor would prescribe you?yes the exact ones|`|Kc0SO4Kwaa	Those shouldn't be reasons to turn to birth control.

UHpqcG9Vaa	i needed to wear glasses since 5th grade, I'm in eleventh now, I highly doubt we'll go blind. but if i'm warned, i'm going to get laser eye surgery|`|32dffe7e0eba9eb2c4e6c9418ec99ba5aa	That depends entirely on what made you legally blind.  If you have extremely poor vision but it's not the result of a progressive disease, you won't go completely blind.  If it's a progressive disease, you might.    Make sure you have a good ophthalmologist to help you preserve your vision.|`|wI5SU7ykaa	You can go blind if you don't try and improve your eyesight- believe me I have to almost wear it all the time  but it can get better- so I would start taking vitamins C, folic acid, carrots, the green vegetables, fish oil and or omega 3 ( all at Whole foods - or a Good Supermarket and or Grocery store)|`|AA10006931	That mostly depends on why you can't see, but odds are you won't be totally blind.  See, there's a big difference between "legally blind" and "blind". Legally blind just means things are really fuzzy. You can still see colours, and light versus dark, and shapes; you could probably walk around a room without walking into anything, or cross the street without dying. Blind, as most people use the word, means everything is completely black. As I'm sure you can imagine, those are two very different perceptions!  If you're just wearing glasses because you're nearsighted or farsighted, even if your prescription gets way worse, that still won't take away the light completely; it'll just make things a lot fuzzier. The only way you'd go totally blind (no light perception) would be to have an eye disease or an accident or something else unrelated to your glasses; a simple change in prescription, no matter how much, isn't going to make you go completely blind.|`|T4uZeVXjaa	It depends on why you are legally blind.  If you have a progressive eye disease that leads to total blindness, then yes.  If you have a progressive eye diseas that does not lead to total blindness or a stable eye disease then no.  There are very few eye diseases that result in total blindness.    The only way to get the correct answer to this question is to ask your eye doctor about the prognosis for your eye disease.    And if by "legally blind" you mean "see worse than 20/200 without glasses but see 20/20 with glasses", that is not legal blindness.

KOYC3XkJaa	Well the picture is a bit blurry, but (correct me if I'm wrong) it looks like there's some broken skin/open sores type thing going on. Did you pick at the burn or break any blisters or anything? Open burns like yours appears to be take about 2-3 weeks to heal and scar over.   If I'm mistaken due to the picture's blurriness, and there is no broken skin, reduce that time to 1-2 weeks.   And those times are assuming you're taking care of the burn, using antibacterial ointment, keeping it clean, and bandaging it.

Think that no one is perfect. There was only a perfect one, and they nailed Him to the cross.  Every one is imperfect in some way. What you see around you are just made up faces, an appearance of perfection, trying to hyde one's problems/imperfections.  Make a list of your good and bad qualities (don't be harsh on yourself. What you label yourself as weird, may be a good quality after all, an attempt to isolate yourself from others, due to a bad social experience at some point in your life). I am sure your good listing will exceed your bad. Don't live much by what others think of you, but rather what you think of yourself. A good friend will be of tremendous help. Ask. Don't assume you will be denied and if you are, find another friend. They have their problems to! The only people plotting against us are the gas, electric and oil companies. After all they are not after us, only our money. Don't be introverted. I am sure you can and will overcome this, as I did at times, somewhere in my life. Now it's only memories. Also, believe and trust in God, who most of the time is our best friend!|`|fjkRIUSnaa	i would try web md and see what they have on paranoia. they may also have links to help with this sort of problem. if not or even in addition to try talking to family or friends . or trying to find a forum such as those here on yahoo to try and talk to others who are feeling the same way.|`|Jx15cpRVaa	the only way to make friends is to be friendly. if you are consntantly afraid, then you aren't going to be able to be friends with anyone. be yourself, even if you do think you are a little weird, there is someone out there just as weird, if not weirder, and they would love to be you're friend. I am sure that you are an AMAZING girl, and as for the people that are supposedly "plotting" against you, then stick up for yourself and tell them what to do and where to go, and people will respect you for standing up for yourself. with a couple of life changes you can fix everything.|`|0FvFzgniaa	Hi, ive just posted a similar question to yours.

4ea275b41b6c56f0526600a3f5521117aa	If you haven't told your coach, you should have. You should have started treating that injury as soon as it started to feel sore.  You need to feel around there and find the sore spot, and then you need to ice it down. Ice it with an ice pack for at least a 20 minute interval. Stop, let it warm up and do it again. If you had done this right away, you would be over this by now.  You can make an icepack out of a zip-lock bag. Get the one that's smaller than a quart/liter. It has some numbers, 6 and a fraction by 5 and a fraction. It's small enough to hold a tray of ice without having too much extra space to float around in there. Then  get an ace bandage and tie it on there and sit back until it goes numb in about 7 or 8 minutes.  Never let an injury get sore, swollen and inflamed. You must treat it right away and it will heal quickly. If you have to go to school and you can't keep an icepack on it, find out about some icy/hot, menthol or eucalyptus product that will help the soreness and pain subside. Ask for help from your coach, PT or trainer and get him to help you wrap it up and keep it warm. Take good care of it so it clears up.  I don't know how long it will take to rehab that injury but you have no time to waste. Start now. You may have to rest it, but it can get better with good care and plenty of ice. From now on, treat it immediately. Don't let a day pass, without treating an injury with ice. You will be glad you did.
oTHGgowsaa	depends, you have to listen to your body, I know that sounds weird, but you have to pace yourself between working out and resting, because resting and letting your muscle rebuild is when they get bigger. So work them as hard as you can one time, then leave them for however long they need. The best way to tell when you're ready for the bench again is flex your pecs, or put pressure on them, and if they're still really sore, don't work out yet, so work out another muscle in the meantime. Also, make sure your getting enough calories to give you the energy, and enough protein to rebuild your muscle, but not too much that you have a large surplus which may go to fat.|`|B12E4rYiaa	Twice a week is great and if you want your chest muscles to have better development make sure you do incline and decline and flys using dumb bells this way you hit the muscles at different angles.|`|mqXyDTwwaa	No, that's actually good. Bench On Mon & Thurs, deadlift Tues & Fri, Squat Wed & Sat.|`|5kXxr6r0aa	when going for mass, after you've been at it for a while and are confident in your abilities, you can make any workout you want so long as you give your chest at least two days of rest, so three times a week could be fine and probably better than twice. Four times, however, will not give you nearly enough time to rest and you'll end up hurting yourself or losing the benefits from your workout.    but remember that if you want to build mass in your chest bench press won't do it on its own, do pushups, and different kinds of presses and pec workouts.    hope that helps, good luck with your goals!|`|lwnH4Es3aa	When going for mass you will build faster the more you work that muscle group but the most important thing is intensity the more sore you make your self the better of a workout you have acomplished. If the soreness in the muscle is delayed like you get realy sore within the next 48-72 hrs that is awsome studies still havent found the reasoning for delayed onset reaction, but it occurs when the intensity or the work load is far from what the body is use to.|`|ICLekd2Vaa	u can 'bench press' me anytime sweety! ;)    |`|a80dc14a526cb69ec2afcb122f024d04aa	no bet even better is to do DB bench press
W4whHKmxaa	Here is a link that will tell you about the  transplant process that your friend will go   through.  This is from one of the Transplant  Centers that do this type of transplant:  http://www.surgery.usc.edu/divisions/hep...    There are Transplant Centers throughout the  USA...to find the closest one, Just type  the State you are in and Transplant Center   after that, in your search engine.  Many Transplant Centers have a site on the web to go to.    Here is another link to tell you all about the  "living donor" transplant process, there is even  other information on this site also:    http://www.transplantliving.org/livingdo...    You already know that this will not take place  if your parents don't give the permission...but  there is another thing to take into consideration...  She can also refuse you being her donor.  The risks she takes in this surgery will likely be almost the same for you.  Also, they usually  try to match up the organ size to the patient...  usually, a man will give to a man.  Also the  blood type has to match.  You have to be  in the best of health also, with no medical   problems of your own.  There is quite an  intensive evaluation process to go through  with much testing and seeing the doctor.    Usually, 60 % of the organ is taken to  give to the patient who needs the organ.  It is true that the organ will regenerate in  both the donor and recipient till it is almost  the normal size.     You will probably be seen by a phycologist,  just like the patient is.  They will be evaluating  you to see if you are emotionally and mentally  able to handle this surgery.  You can back out of this at anytime...however, this would be serious if the girl wasn't listed on the transplant list yet...that means it will prevent her from being placed on the list at the earliest possible date.  Patients are placed on the transplant list according to how much time they have to live without a transplant being done.  If they are very sick and only have a short time, they are near the  top of the list...if they are fairly healthy, they  are placed at the bottom of the list and may  even go off the list if they heal.           I hope this information is of help to you.|`|KeeaVzxpaa	I don't think there are age restrictions but parental consent would be needed. You would also have to be good tissue match.|`|zAi5Xl1Laa	A minor cannot donate an organ unless they are deceased and their next of kin who is an adult allows such.  Also, to be a living donor you have to go through a bunch of tests to see if  you are a match.  You cannot just give somebody an organ because you are generous.|`|bec16h7Taa	You need your liver to live...how do you plan on donating it and living through it?|`|c7jhAYudaa	ask your doctor man  and dont donate parts of your brain|`|zCnydScPaa	you're going to need that liver to survive. my grandpa has liver disease, and they just cant take it out, so he is waiting on a transplant. so no, you cant unless you are willing to let your life go.|`|v2ZBawa7aa	You could only do a partial liver donation in order to continue to live.  That will work sometimes.  If you are tested and happen to match (not very likely), you would need your parents permission.|`|GBPTeB1Waa	Parents permission is a must. The doctors have to approve it too. You cant just give an organ. A number of tests have to be run.|`|ElBIeRFNaa	as far as I know, you have to be compatible.  if your tissue doesn't match, i don't think you can donate.  make sure to be tested first.  i don't think age has anything to do with it.|`|wJ1HYJOqaa	of course you could do it however there are some restrictions. for example you'd have to be a good match so her body wouldn't reject it and make her worse, you must have parental consent, and lastly to clear things up you can donate part of your liver, they don't take the entire thing, the procedure is quite basic and very little chance of things going wrong. personally I hope that your parents consent and you help the person you care a lot about.     all the best  Zack

8SRjELNBaa	Walks walks walks! Walks allow your joints and muscles to slowly come back into active mode after a long hibernation.  Park your car at the end of the parking lot.. Simple rule, get moving!      As far as hopelessness is concerned, I'd suggest doing 20 push ups, look at yourself in the mirror and say "I'm a f***ing beast!" Do 20 sit ups, look at yourself in the mirror and say "ow that hurt".      Your whole goal when starting to get into shape is keep moving. Slowly as your body gets use to movement, you can start with a jog around the block... then maybe around 3...4...5 blocks! And maybe a sprint from phone-pole to phone-pole just for kicks.    As far as eating is concerned, throw away all your butter & snack foods.  Buy a pack of multi-vitamins from costco, take 1 daily.  Buy whatever vegetable is on sale that week at your local grocery store, learn to cook! Eat egg whites & oatmeal for breakfast and at least 2 cups of water with every meal.  That should get you started.    Oh, more importantly, do outside research about weight loss because knowledge is key. Learn about your body.  Learn about food. Learn about exercise, both cardio and weights.    Hope i've helped.  It's never too late to get in shape.|`|LpedVLedaa	Start with Tai Chi..it's slow moving yet gets you in shape from the inside out.

I am amazed at how many women know nothing about their bodies.|`|xNkmK0SHaa	If you had an ectopic, you would have no signs/symptoms until it ruptured.  At that time you would have no doubt that you should be in the emergency department immediately if not sooner.    And just for the record, there is nothing worse.  That can kill you quicker than a heart attack.      Now: how dare you tell anyone to spare you the criticism !!!  Who the Hell do you think you are ???

Just tell your gyn everything and I am sure they will do the blood pregnancy test to measure the HCG level and go from there..  Good luck|`|k4fd4jnjaa	Sounds more like a cyst. The pressure from your period can cause the cyst to burst. When you get to the doctors they will give you an ultra sound and you will be able to see fluid or an empty spot where the cyst was. Now if this was a ectopic pregnancy be happy it passed on it's own becuase the next step would've been surgery. More likely a cyst.

Gw1LLzDgaa	I know what it is -- and I think that worrying about meditation effecting your chi is just a silly method of yet another group trying to control their members sexual habits.  I guarantee you that if you truly reject the teaching on this that you have received, your chi will be absolutely fine and you will meditate as well as anyone else.      Let the anti-sexual teachings drop (and yes, I have a pretty good understanding of all the arguments attached, they resemble arguments in some of the Western mystery schools very closely - the arguments are false in the West and the East.)

In 04 I had to get back surgery for a herniated disc.  Nearly 2 years after surgery I STILL had painful and crippling sciatica, weak legs and pain.  A friend of mine turned me on to inversion therapy and I have been hanging upside down ever since.  what I've learned through treating with inversion therapy is that although we feel pain in  our backs, the pain really originates in the core, stomach or ab muscles.  As I inverted I felt my abs start to loosen as the spasms were stretched away.  As my abs relaxed they loosened their grip on my hip muscles, thighs and of course my back muscles.  Once these muscles were also relaxed my lower back and pelvis were free to go back into alignment and as they did my sciatica disappeared.  I have been virtually pain free for 3 years now because of inversion therapy and I want the world to know!  Inversion therapy has literally saved my life.  Do some research yourself and see if you think inversion therapy can help you as it did me.  Inversion therapy is like getting a massage everytime you do it.  It really works.   All my best.
ed71a2e7f354d346a0ff1de177befe5faa	Hi.  I don't think you're afraid of babies I just think it's the fear of dropping them that is worrying you.  I used to hate holding babies before I had my own first child and now I love to hold them, anytime I can.  I'm not suggesting you have a baby of course, not unless you want to.    I'm sure they do sense your fear but even if you're not frightened, babies will obviously cry in your arms sometimes and it won't be anything to do with you sometimes as they may be hungry, tired, thirsty or just fed up with being passed around!    I think you should perhaps tell one of your friends how you feel and ask if you could just sit down and hold her baby for a very short time and pass the baby back as soon as you feel uncomfortable.  Sitting down is easier than holding a baby stood up if you are nervous.  Do this again and again and you'll soon get used to holding them given a little time.  When you're holding the baby, hold him/her quite close to you and look at the baby's face.  They are wonderful little creatures I assure you and are not nearly as fragile as you think.    So good luck, I wish you joy as once you enjoy holding them you won't want to give them back!|`|e59bc254d8339c1ae45e999a109e63e4aa	I think its normal. everyone has their own specific fears. don't worry. i'd advise you to get over your fear by being around babies more. holding them and playing with them. just to get a feel for what they are really like.|`|vd9mdriYaa	Oh hun, TRUST ME...  I used to have a phobia of babies and holding them! I know what you are going through. And no they can not "see" your fear, but I am sure that they can sense it.    If you ever get around to holding a baby, or when you muster up the courage, Hold the baby close to you and let it feel your warmth. Dont be scared... trust me, it will pass..    Mine did. (:|`|WVZcb1S1aa	It is very possible that babies can sense your fear. Just as babies seem to gravitate toward friendly people, they also can tell when a person is uncomfortable around them. However, I highly doubt that a baby would cry as soon as it saw you, unless it knew you previously as a person who hadn't treated it kindly. Babies can cry for any reason at all- it's probably a coincidence!     You really have nothing to be afraid of... if YOU are conscious about holding a baby the correct way, they aren't going to magically fly out of your arms. It might seem silly, but practice holding a realistic baby doll. Easy as pie!     When you go to hold a real baby, just sit down at first until the baby is comfortable in your arms. Then you can try walking around with him or her. Babies are one of the biggest joys in life, and it would be a shame if you let this fear go on for too long!|`|WXExyAlWaa	No you're not. That's a fairly rational reason to be afraid of them, even if dropping them would be unlikely when you're that worried about it because you're more likely to be careful. Of course, some people simply don't have a maternal instinct, just like some animals don't. It's perfectly normal.

Basically I got criticised for everything, which I believed and my self esteem plummeted.  I got depressed because of my perceived failings and my energy levels plummeted which led to more criticism and so the downward spiral continued.  When my ex-husband left, that was what pushed me over the edge with depression and I got anti depressants and saw a counsellor.  I think the anti-Ds helped a bit, but I'm not sure how much the counselling did. Perhaps a better counsellor may have worked better, I don't know.  The thing that really helped was cognitive hypnotherapy.  That helped me pinpoint events in my childhood that led me to believe criticism instead of believing in myself.  I still have moments where I feel the effects, but on the whole I am better able to deal with situations now.|`|MOCBWQHhaa	Emotional abuse can be defined a lot of different ways. Most associate it with physical abuse but words can be just as damaging as a regular beating. The affects of it can last a lifetime if left untreated. The best thing is to remove yourself from the situation. Whether you do or don't leave, you still need therapy to regulate your own responses to living. If you can't afford therapy yourself, look for self support groups in your area. If alcohol is a factor try finding an al anon group.  A church may be able to direct you to groups. Good luck!|`|ouzrDPaSaa	No.  I put up with an emotionally and psychically abusive parent growing up.  I couldnt leave that situation as I had no other family and social services didnt believe me so there's no way I'd put myself through that again when I have the power to end it if I wanted to.  I'd break up with the partner, if I lived in their home then I would arrange to stay in a hostel or with a friend until I sorted something out.|`|W18Pvlvsaa	Never, and i cant imagine how hard it must be at the time,   but the concept of it is awful, id just do whatever i could to get him out of my life completely  then just forget about him. people like that arent worth crying about or even thinking about  there are better things to do than worrying about things that have already happened :)|`|AA10764658	The only way to deal with it is leaving the bastard. I am still affected by my ex's emotional abuse toward me. It screws you up and then you have future relationship problems because of him.   Its been 10 years and I am still scare of him. Leave him.  Emotional abuse is not love, it comes from anger and hate!  Don't get use to it or else you will be screwed for the rest of your life and if you have children, think about them and how it is affecting them mentally!|`|Dhz4XgQ3aa	I did. My ex was very manipulative causing arguments over nothing and then making me feel it was my fault. He was like this mostly when he was drunk.   I didnt cope with it well cos he was so good at it, I actually thought i was going crazy and thought it must be my fault.  I really struggled and he did help my depression.   Unless you realise and get help it very hard. Some people like my ex are very good at making you believe its your fault.|`|pNchWbb2aa	yes i had a x partner who was very emotionally abusive but i did finally leave him some 9 years of being together that was about 5 years ago now but i will never deal 100%  with it cus the scars will always be there, really how do you get over being pinned at a door with a hugh knife or being left at home all day and night with no food, electric or nappies for a 8mt old boy and having to walk over 2 miles in the dead of winter to borrow money from my parents and then lieing to them for why and wot for, its something i cant forget but i can look to the future with half a smile knowing that i WILL NEVER be in that kind of relationship again, i am independent now but i do have a partner who is not perfect but not a abuser, the best thing i did was kick him out with a black eye but i have to deal with it everyday if not it will creep up behind me and ruain my life all over again but only in my mind, its hard but get if you havent been there but if you have i wish you all the happyness in the world cus when he is gone the clouds will lift and the sun will shine on you good luck sweet xxxx|`|3a884da0645ad44f7968fa8c94e1582caa	Yes, and the only way to deal with it is to cut yourself off from this person. In my case it was a girlfriend who used emotional blackmail and bullying to get what they wanted.     Heard the same old promises of "trying to change" and the abuse was turned on and off. Never fall into the trap of thinking  things are supposed to be like this and everyone probably puts up with it.     Best way is to think would you let someone you love be treated in the same way you are being treated?
kVybkdOsaa	I used to have the very same cramps.  I had tried pain pills once or twice, but since they did not bring relief, I went onto look for other solutions.    First thing I would suggest is not use pain killers.  There is something going on with your body and the pain killers only mask the issue (if they work at all).    The symptoms that you describe fit into a condition known as premenopause or perimenopause.  This does not mean you are going through menopause.      What it means is that your hormones, estrogen and progesterone, are out of balance resulting in symptoms of varying severity.  This imbalance could have occurred from birth control pills or even environmental estrogens.    What I would have given for someone to tell me there is an answer, a solution to my monthly problems!  Well, there is.    You need to get an understanding of how your hormones work.  To do this, I recommend you read the book by John R. Lee, M.D. titled "What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About Menopause".    Don't be fooled by the title.  This book most definitely applies to you and your symptoms.      My doctor once told me that my symptoms were part of being a woman and there was nothing that could be done.  Hogwash!    Educate yourself, educate your doctor or find another.  Then get your hormones in balance.|`|f2d89272f3e228493a1f7ea002fea3efaa	I honestly think you are just someone who gets really bad cramps, sometimes when you get cramps your body reacts to them and makes you feel straight up sick.  Half of those symptoms you describe can be from the pain alone, a lot of people have diarrhea during their period.  The black outs and cold sweats are a little strange, I would have to guess your hormones are going crazy.  Just recently I started getting very strange things with my period and im 26.  This last time I had severe cramping for 2 days with really bad anxiety like symptoms even tho i've never had anxiety and after my period it disappears.  Hormones can do WEIRD things.  Go to a gyn dr or someone who specializes in hormones so you can be tested for defeciencies.|`|mXYxRsB5aa	The only thing i can suggest is that you go back to the doctor and insist on more tests. I had the same symptoms and it was found out that i had endometriosis- this did not show on a normal scan it was found on and MRI scan along with cysts   Hope this helps a bit|`|UjHwEsvYaa	Fret not, I go through the EXACT same thing. I saw a doctor when I was about 17 and he prescribed some amazing pain killers that I've been on for a while. Ask for a pain killer, a prescription strength pain killer and going to a general practitioner won't do anything, you need to see the gynecologist for woman problems.

Birth control pills  2. Ovarian cysts  3. Uterine polyp  4. Pregnancy (altho this would only cause a very light bleeding which is called implantation bleeding and not everyone has this)  5. STD's can cause irregular bleeding  6. Stress  just need a little more info from you to know exactly what could be going on|`|2ccc737caef357c3260c36ef333caaa5aa	That's not entire abnormal.

Wish I could say something better than to train selfdefence but if you train hard as Uma Thurman in Kill Bill the time will help you to reach a day while you have learned to handle your wounds hopefully. - You also get the strenght to defend yourself if you become attacked.

thcHQkbxaa	Well first off your period isn't always going to be perfectly timed. Our bodies change constantly.     Secondly, I get this discharge too, I started getting it probably a little over a year ago. I only get it once every few periods. My doctor told me all it is is old blood. If your body isn't getting enough blood out during your period it stays in there and will come out when it needs to.    Keep drinking the cranberry juice though, it's good for you.    A UTI or Bladder Infection can be caused from a number of things. Oral sex is a big one for Bladder Infections. Even normal sex with or without a condom can cause it.    You should be fine, but getting tested is never a bad thing.|`|NLxubdAqaa	maybe you are going to have baby..and it is your last pd. that or you just have a problem that need to be check out more.i dont think it has to do with the uti cuz then you well be getting like a blood color|`|yeSeoIbjaa	Ok you need to relax cause there is not a lot wrong with you. Stop with the doctors and health professionals and listen to your body (it is whispering to you). I have known the discomfort of a urinary tract infection, and the cranberry juice is what is producing the discharge. I'd be interested to know what prescription medicines you have swallowed, as this may be the precipitating element, aggravated by the large doses of constituents present in cranberry. Cranberry flushes you out, if you take medicines i.e antibiotics? they will remain in your tissues for many weeks. "thrush anyone?). With large amounts of prescription sitting in your poor overworked bladder liver  kidneys and soft tissue, the addition of the juice irritates the lining and causes your body to thicken up it's defence while trying to eliminate the problem. Contraindications of prescriptions and self medication are not widely known, even by the professionals.  Give your body a moment to catch up with you, the best thing you can do is to keep exercising cause it is good for your mind and body. Also find and consume a cup of nettle (Urtica dioica) tea, adding only honey if you require a sweetener. The nettle has worked overnight for myself and others who asked at the first sign. You however have smashed your system with real poison dressed as medicine, so I believe that 1 or 2 or even 3 days @ 1cup a day should put you back to a comfortable place. Health food stores and herb farms are where you should look.|`|CdTe8MO4aa	i can't remember the name of the antibiotic it started with a L but one of the side effects is a discolored discharge  onetime mine was black    u should maybe keep drinking cranberry juice or get the cranberry pills and drink more water|`|iZgtcAcAaa	heavy hard sex can bring on brown discharge    also, if you are prone to UTI - stop drinking pop/soda - the sugar causes them to re-appear|`|oR7fFEKLaa	It's called poop.|`|WvAwQmndaa	most of the time brown discharge is related to an std.|`|ojtINp2raa	Every woman is different...but I do not believe your doctor is correct (sorry..NO I'm not a doctor) when they say it is bladder-related.  Why? Because if it is discharge, that is normally a uterine-related issue, not the bladder.  The bladder stores and releases urine, not discharge. ;)    Perhaps you're ovulating?  Like I stated above, every woman is different, but I know that many women experience a heavy brown discharge when they are ovulating.    Also------it could very well be something called implantation bleeding (when the fetus is attaching itself to your uterine wall).   If you had protective sex----that doesn't *always* mean a  'for sure' thing.    If you had intercourse on the 24/25th of the month, and it is now the 2nd...I would wait one more week and get a blood test taken to be sure that pregnancy isn't the issue.    Perhaps seeing a reproductive endocrinologist (RE) would help also...as I'm pretty sure this has something to do with your uterus...not your bladder.    Take care!    :)|`|VJCeyNojaa	Everyone else seems to have it. Excercise brings on discharge, sugar irritates you if you're prone to UTIs and rough sex, or even a reaction to the condom material can cause discharge. Doesn't sound worrisome.     One thing to add: when you say cranberry juice, if you aren't drinking pure, just cranberries cranberry juice you're probably drinking a whole lot of sugar. Read the label. There is pure cranberry juice available but it's pretty hard to get down, very bitter.|`|dIzBkJuyaa	It's normal, just some old blood that's left over from your last period. It can be a little or alot, and since you started exercising it would make sense that there was more than usual.|`|7AfEG5rWaa	thats gross, i am glad i'm not you|`|4DgEnlKZaa	Brown discharge is sometimes dried blood, so this could possibly just be your period.  I suggest instead of getting answers online, you go to the doctor again to make sure everything is okay.|`|YJ4BFphTaa	The brown discharge is probably just blood coming from your uterus meaning that your period is about to start.  That happens to me when I am about to get my period, sometimes I have a few days of brownish-peach or bits of red blood.  Thats just your uterus getting ready to release all the blood and lining (your period) and the brown discharge is just the very first blood to come out.  Its brown because its been sitting in the uterus and its older so thats why it looks like that.|`|nsGBwXCTaa	you should go to another doc, I had some of thoes sighns and I found out in Jan 2008 I had cervicl cancer .

AA11176387	Well, I did read his bates method for better eyesight and have a testimony.    Since I read that treating amblyopia (lazy eye) successfully as happened to my son can also improve color blindness and visa versa so it might be worth a shot.  I feel your odds of finding someone who read the book you mentioned and tried it are very small.  I could not even find a book with the title you mentioned but I did read the book he wrote above.  Maybe that is what you are referring to..I am not sure.    My son was found when he was 12 to have 20/200 vision and by an eye doctor this could not be reversed and glasses was the only answer.  Not willing to except (this was over 20 years ago, I found the bates book and was very impressed.    I searched all over the surrounding stated and my own but could find no one trained in the bates method.    Meanwhile the teachers were saying the following to my son "you're mom doesn't mean to be mean and hurt you but you have to make her get you glasses."    Finally in calling the state university I found someone trained in vision therapy.  I made a trip once a week for 20 weeks and he did the required exercises.  He was found to have myopia an presbyopia (wall eyed).    At the end of this time, my son's vision was 20/40 in one eye and 20/60 in the other and the lazy eye was working way better.  He was not color blind so I cannot tell you if it will help that but I can say that it is thought if one's presbyopia (and maybe other vision problems) improves, so does color blindness and vision therapy did help my son's amblyopia.    It was with real glee, I send his report on the dramatic improvement which others doctors told me was impossible to the school proving I was not mean but right.    My son did not get glasses until he was about 33 giving him 21 years glasses free.    I would try it if it were me as I never heard of anything else that might cure color blindness and this man, dr. bates did many, many studies on the eyes.    Here are a few things that I found on bates and color blindness in the sources.    Sorry I hadn't tried it specifically for color blindness but seeing how it (or the most similar thing I could find to it and my son did the eye chart, palming and stuff too) did fix something that if fixed also helps fix color blindness, I thought I would pass the info in to you.    here is something else I found    http://www.curezone.com/forums/fm.asp?i=...

I would try the very smallest sized tampon first.  Read over the directions and look at the diagram.  I would also recommend getting a tampon that has a plastic applicator. It may be slightly uncomfortable at first.  If the tampon is inserted far enough you won't feel anything.  Ask a older friend, cousin or your mom I think they would be able to help you if you need it.|`|475ElGi1aa	FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS      it's put in wrong if u sit and feel it/hurts.

In my personal opinion however, the best way to loose your virginity is when you are atleast 18 since most ppl arent truly ready before that time since lots of ppl just to it to fit in or be cool.  Also you should try to loose your virginity with someone who is more experienced than you.  If you have sex when you are like 13 then its just going to be some awkward, unpleasurable, pointless experience.  Espicially if you are a girl since sex for the first time at 13 will inevidable just be about the guys's orgasm/penetration since he will most likely not know how to please you or give you an orgsam due to lack of experience.

dMMKsasEaa	i did the same thing!!! no one really noticed. i told a few people. they were okay with it... its not that big of a deal. and if people say things to you just be like its better than before and i like it.  and dont sweat it, its a new trend... more and more people are starting to do it- im not saying to do it but im predicting someday alot of women will do it. =]  oh btw once you start your gonna have to keep shaving like every 3 days and for me it didnt come back darker but it was prickly. i suggest waxing or like nair.|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	wax them|`|cfvAJJqdaa	Do what you want, it's your body.    Try wearing long sleeves for a while so they forget how hairy your arms are, then  Or you can try trimming them instead. They won't notice that, then eventually you can trim off more and more and one day shave it all off and people shouldn't be paying that much attention to it and won't notice. But if you do it overnight then yeah people might notice.   But try not to care. You either want to be known as the girl with hairy arms or the girl who shaves her arms. What do you prefer?     FYI it will grow back really fast so it's kind of pointless unless you're commited to the idea, and happy to do it every few days, and get stubble. If you brush against people it might jag them. Keep that in mind.  Don't bleach it's beyond pointless!! Ignore the idiots saying that.  Waxing is the alternative. But it's up to you.|`|OsT64mqMaa	If it is dark, then try bleaching it. That way it's not as much of a difference, but it still is noticably better.|`|bd15f3fb92086e6fbaddee4b97b19fdeaa	hey i was in the same situation years ago. i was so nervous b/c everyone knew my arms were hairy. but i just did it and people didn't say anything. when i was in high school almost everyone shaved their arms, even the boys. so just do it and don't be worried about what everyone thinks. good luck!!|`|pRn1h2Hlaa	In all honesty id advise you not too.the hairs just gonna keep coming back darker and thicker than ever before.i only know cos im pretty hairy myself.ive gotten used to my hairy arms too. If your that self conscious about them id advise going to your local beauty parlor and see if they can bleach th hairs.works great:)
Nqd9L3fvaa	For someone so young, its fine to have spacey periods. Sometimes, regular cycles are almost 40 days apart!  When I first got my period, I went from June to December with zero periods!   It's fine, they will regulate themselves eventually after about 1-2 years.|`|L6DFPXo6aa	Tell her to pack some goods.  She may get it unexpectedly.  She may skip, you don't usually get regular for a few months, some people never do.  But don't worry about that.|`|OsT64mqMaa	It absolutely doesn't mean she is pregnant. Your period is never consistent, or you are very lucky if it is. Don't worry about it at all.|`|TlQW67MFaa	o geez. calm down!!!!!!!!!!  the fist year or two of ur period is irregular. its not going to come every 28 days so chill out  u can either completely skip the month or be a ouple days late. take some pads and tampons just incase
muaOzh9Jaa	that sucks. Yea the doctor can tell. i think theres something like a little film that goes across the inside of your vag and it get broken wen u do it. Tampons cant reach. but if u can bribe the doctor or something. unless ur mom doesn't care...?|`|GLJkGgloaa	No, the doctor is NOT allowed to tell your mother if you are having sex.  But I have been there. My Mom took me to My doctor to insist that I get a Pelvic exam when I was a teen. I was virgin till I met my husband...  But yeah, They can't tell.|`|9Mr14w6Qaa	You didn't say how old you were ,but I am assuming that you are old enough to have sex.Whenever you see a Doctor the information between you and the Doctor is confidential.Your mother will not be told anything|`|OsT64mqMaa	The doctor can most definitely tell if you have.|`|2GUJR0v9aa	People say that doctors can tell if you have sex, but the doctor cannot tell your mom anything if you tell the doctor not too. Doctor-Patient confidentiality. Technically, if the doctor does say something, you could sue them. But anyways. I don't know if they can really tell besides the hymen being broken.|`|462fed2fe3ce1f4bcba1e73bb0da97adaa	the doctor cant tell if you're a virgin. Even though your hymen has already been tore you can easliy tear it playing sports....Just say it prolly tore while you were playin whateva sport you play|`|9pPs93H6aa	The doctor can definitely tell especially if it's a gynecologist. Well you can always deny it by saying you aren't having sex since the hymen can be broken in different ways like sports.|`|JVvnET59aa	The doctors can tell if your not a virgin but they cannot tell your mom unless you give them permission. If not then they won't tell her yes or no!!|`|jlQHB9dvaa	If you have only had sex a handful of times and are athletic and use tampons, I highly doubt a doctor could really give a definite answer.    Its hard to believe that a doctor would do a pelvic exam just to satisfy your mother's morbid curiosity.  The answer she gets will not be a definite, if he will give her one at all.  Your mother is very controlling.  If you are at least 16, she needs to deal with it and assist you in getting effective birth control and talking to you about these issues, not by doing what she is doing now.|`|erhdsNHHaa	Oh wow if I were you I would be SOO angry with my mom, what an invasion of privacy.  Plus it's not like you're ho-ing around, you've been with the guy for 9 months.    Read this, it will explain it better than I can lol.    The hymen is a fold of mucous membrane which surrounds or partially covers the external vaginal opening. It forms part of the vulva, or external genitalia.[1][2] Slang terms are maidenhead and "cherry", as in "popping one's cherry" (losing one's virginity). However, it is not possible to confirm that a woman or post-pubescent girl is not a virgin by examining the hymen.[2] In cases of suspected rape or sexual abuse, a detailed examination of the hymen may be carried out; but the condition of the hymen alone is often inconclusive or open to misinterpretation, especially if the patient has reached puberty.[3] In children, although a common appearance of the hymen is crescent-shaped, many variations are possible.[4] After a woman gives birth she may be left with remnants of the hymen called carunculae myrtiformes or the hymen may be completely absent.[5]|`|Umsj08pnaa	Your mother is stupid. There is no real way to tell if someone is a virgin unless you ask. And even if they suspected correctly, they aren't allowed to tell your mother.|`|LljGSkkoaa	The Dr. will be able to tell that your hymen is ruptured (which could happen by using tampons and playing sports). the Dr. can't really tell if you're a virgin or not unless you're pregnant or have an std which could only happen if you're not a virgin.  You're mom's trying to scare you into telling her if you're having sex.  Although it would be really good if you could talk to your mom and let her know what's going on with you.  She probably just wants to know that you're being safe.|`|bEVhDE9Raa	no he cant tell  your hymen may have broken from anything and depending on your age, pretty much everything between you and a doctor is private,|`|Ig3SgkYwaa	well, ur hyman can ripe doing sports, so you can say ur a virgin.

It knots up and then releases the uterus, relaxing it (and you). It works better than any drug. It also is a good way to relax into sleep on fidgety nights. As far as how, clitoris stimulation can be accomplished with a vibrating device, or your index fingers on either side of the clitoris alternating up and down, increasing tempo. The other (obvious) benefit is the release of sexual energy (stress) that lets you pick a sexual partner when you're ready in your own time, not when you're frantic for release.
ODR21UgYaa	Try taking ginger tablets they are a natural way to help pain and shorten your period and blood flow. You can also try taking advil or tylenol in rotation according to the instructions on the bottle, if none of these things work you might want to consult your doctor who might try to put you on birth control.|`|LM7DWcdlaa	Actaully, most birth control pills regulate your period. Im on them, and my periods used to hurt. I used to have terrible cramps too. birth control really works, even if you dont plan on having sex.|`|ADRc8gJiaa	Put a hot pad on your stomach, drinks lots of tea, take some pamprin. All of those help with the pain, and many more. But talk to your doctor, or gyno, they have birth control methods that can help you with this. They will lessen your periods, and make the bleeding a lot lighter. But if you dont want to do that, I would just stick with getting rid of the pain, cuz I know what your talking about. It stinks.|`|AA12178676	I usually use a heating pad and ibuprofen/midol for pain. It helps mostly, but I found that  workouts lessen the cramps as well. If you feel too bad to workout, just do something easy or low impact like walking. Not sure about the bleeding though. Maybe ask your doctor. They wanted to put me on birth control pills to reduce my heavy period and cramps. I didn't take them but I hear they work for a lot of women.  Good luck and feel better.|`|GIzDh3Tpaa	have you tried don quai?   I myself had the same problem as yuo...I used to pass out all the time with the pain. I started don quai when I was 14 and about 2-3 months later the pain had lessened dramatically and the bleeding was much less!|`|M6isDqdIaa	I am 22 years old and have terribly heavy periods along with crazy pain. I was on a birth control pill when I was aged 15-17 called 'Cilest' and although this made my periods lighter and less painful - it didn't agree with me.    Birth control is a great option - see your doctor or family planning clinic and just see what your options are. They may even have a lot more information on other alternative methods.    Goodluck :o)
Q5qpMLOVaa	Well, it's to be expected that you "still feel like friends". Your relationship is only a few hours old after all.    Just spend time with him. Go out to movies. Walk at the park. Anything really. There's no rule you need to follow to make your relationship more "official".|`|cTsRyAbBaa	maybe try more to flirt with him , or atleast kiss on the cheek , hold hands . whatever your most comfortable in .         -hope this helps . (:|`|oluzjSgjaa	talk and hold hands   kiss on cheek.  arm round shoulder.|`|7a8e83621f723375d64486b573de37d6aa	if you see him as a friend you should of just said no that was your mistake, when you dont see him as a friend any more then thats okay. i say you tell  him straight that he's a really good friend.

b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	It is unusual for a girl your age to be having incontinence problems.  It is possible that you have a small bladder and it just needs emptied more often.  You probably should see a urologist and have them check to see if your bladder empties when you urinate.  Try to go pee very often, even every hour and see if that helps.  You could do Kegel exercises which help tighten the pelvic muscles and help you control urination problems.    hope this helps..|`|lckmALjGaa	i dunno but i was watching the doctors and they  said people who can't hold it in can practice flexing and relaxing  that muscle down their( i dunno if that makes sense i dunno  how to say it)|`|d8WtO3iRaa	Does it happen randomly or when you sneeze/cough/etc?|`|oluzjSgjaa	wear a thin pantyliner made for stress incontinence, do kegal exercises to tone up pelvic muscles|`|AvG8vas7aa	Haha you pee your pants.|`|bRDNsbq4aa	At age 20 you probably have a urinary tract [bladder] infection. Notice if the urine is cloudy or odorous or burns.  Drink enough liquids to keep the urine straw colored.  Water is great but any liquid will do.   Not likely an overactive bladder at your age  but possible if you are drinking lots of caffeine like sodas, coffee, chocolate or power/energy drinks.  Pyridium over the counter maybe called azo standard or ask your pharmacist what is good for bladder spasms ...may be cystospaz or some  similar name.  May turn your urine orange or urised turns your urine blue will relieve irritable bladder symptoms.   You may be holding your urine too long like at work or whatever.  Try to urinate every four hours,,,take your time and empty well.    Teachers are prone to bladder problems 'cause they can't get away from the kids long enough to go to the bathroom as needed.  Long term ignoring the natural functioning of the bladder can cause unhealthy changes.   Please see your doctor hopefully they will get a urine specimen for a urinalysis to check for bacteria in the urine.  Usually a primary care doctor will treat you for symptoms and may not do a test as this is more expensive and time consuming. You will need antibiotics to clear up an infection if that is what you have.   Keagle exercises are helpful to tighten muscles and prevent urinary incontinence as you describe...usually this occus as women age or have multiple births.. This is not your situation.
oluzjSgjaa	too often is when it takes over your life , or becomes compulsive.   best time to masturbate is when you are alone in your bed last thing at night before you go to sleep.   you are relaxed then, you have privacy, and wont be disturbed.   then you can gently play with your clitoris, or whatever you normally do.   get some relief from tension, feel comfortable and warm.   reach an orgasm if that's what you want to do, or need for relief, then fall  asleep satisfied.|`|AA10868929	You do as you desire/ you feel.

At first I was not educated about life and I thought every girls on the planet as "dirty whores" but when you actually study life well things gets a little complicated.  I know I know most modern girls already lose their virginities but some are just saying guys pressured them or peer pressure to lose their virginity. Still I'm still not really sure about women.|`|V3mpzjcuaa	Many women have said that sex can be satisfying without them reaching orgasm. Other women require you give them an orgasm in order to be satisfied.  So it kinda depends on your woman.     Get to know your woman and her needs.  If she needs an orgasm to be satisfied, then make sure she has one (or two).

Talk about a pain in the ***. I've always been curious about other women's experience with discharge. Feedback? Also, I have practically no libido and don't really get the enjoyment out of sexual encounters with my boyfriend that I wish I did. But, all in all, I think it looks nice and I'm thankful that I have one and that it's healthy! I think every woman has at least one reason to love her vagina...|`|AA10868929	I am a male. I love my gf vagina madly  and she loves her.|`|QsD9VOMYaa	I HATE mine, becuase I think it looks different (the inner lips are larger than the outer ones and are of different sizes).

Vh9LszMAaa	you may have bad circulation in them. Try cutting back processed sugars and take a jog.
k7cYol3Caa	Most pills won't cause weight gain. Some of the symptoms you are describing sound like polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). Did your doc check for this? If not, you might go to a different doc for a second opinion. Also, if you are depressed, you might mention that as well. There are all kinds of things that can be done to help you with that. Good luck.|`|f2d89272f3e228493a1f7ea002fea3efaa	Im not sure about this, I have regular periods and everything has always been completely normal for me until this most recent one.

6Btmg7Tcaa	I get the same thing and upon seeing a doc at the hospital they think i probably have endometriosis around my bowel and bladder, sounds like you might have it too.   Try an anti inflamtory medication like Ibruprofen, it doesn't stop it but it does help me a little.   You should see your doc though and just make sure thats what it is|`|aaeZlYdraa	see your doctor|`|wNWhGzjsaa	why do u have a boy avatar and yes go c a doctor|`|RNNdRHrMaa	Sounds like Endometriosis.    This is where the lining of the womb grows outside the womb attached to various parts of your gut, causing you to bleed out into your gut.  Causing lots of pain.    Get it checked by the doc, just incase. The pain hurts like hell|`|2w592nAFaa	maybe it's just a temporary thing??? but you should probably ask your doctor!|`|HXxkTltQaa	Hi there  please don't panic,  you do need to see your doctor, i have the same as you, i know what mine is caused by, my womb tilts backwards, so i get stomach pains and the shooting pains!  there is nothing that really helps with the pain,i take painkillers and have a hot water bottle and a blanket and try not to move alot for 7 days when i have it.|`|QpoYpHFFaa	That is totally normal, don't worry about it. If the pains are really bad then ask your doctor for something. I've heard Ponstam is really good.|`|mXYxRsB5aa	Go to your doctor and request that he sends you for a scan, it could be endometriosis or cysts|`|ZKw46efXaa	hello,    i feel your pain! i get this too! i sometimes think my bf thinks i am putting on an act as it is so bad! he said he doesnt understand why i get so much pain!! its just the time of the month thing for me. You could try feminax which are tablets to ease the pain, you can get from the chemist. Ive never tried them but i have been recommended them by a friend.

The day menstrual bleeding starts is counted as  1st day of the cycle.|`|xdo49r2iaa	Hi,    5 days before and 5 days after the period are called safe period for Sex.|`|e40214e61a518c8534dc6ad01c1109caaa	1st "week" counted from the 1st day of the periods and the last "week" before the periods are supposed to be safe. The "week" depends upon the number of days in her menstrual cycle. Normal cycle is 28 days. Here, the "week" would be 7 days. If the cycle is not 28 days, then you divide the number of days by 4 and round the answer to the lowest whole number. Say, the number of days is 26 then the "Week" would be 6 days (26/4=6.5, rounded to the lowest whole number. viz 6)    Hope the above is clear.     Anyway, about 3 to 4 days go for the periods in the first "week" and you would be left with only a few days, but you have all the days in the last "week"    Please note, the safe periods are not always safe.|`|SLBtej62aa	After 10 days from|`|1QRLr6Caaa	Avoid Amavasya, Prathma, Ashtami and Ekadasahi rest of the days are quite good for planning family.

When you are pregnant or on birth control, the lining of your uterus thickens, so that an egg cannot implant to be fertilized. I don't know how she would just KNOW this though. Kind of odd. She might be indicating that she is on birth control and that she cannot get pregnant or something. I am not sure how your conversation with her came about or what you were talking about, but maybe this is what she was meaning!|`|oluzjSgjaa	perhaps when she has her period she sees lots of membrane and clots and stuff, which is the uterus lining coming away when you bleed.   some times you get more than just blood.   you can get stringy bits too.|`|w4zjmhxoaa	She would know if she had to have an ultra sound for some reason, and it happened to be right before her period.    you have a thick uterine lining right before you get your period

Why, do you want to start drinking coffee? - jk.  Some research says 21, some gives it more room and says 25. By 25 all male and female adults are grown to their full height. One thing you can do - a little investigation of your own. Ask your parents for your childhood measurements, and see how tall were you as a 2 year old. Multiply that by two, and if your height is exactly your childhood height X2 you are fully grown. It's a fact! Check it out.|`|YlLdIPRvaa	Probably but not necessarily.  Your brain is not fully done developing until age 25 but your body is usually done growing by 16-18.

Even if you never grow another inch, you should know that others will respect you as a mature adult if you're confident.|`|houWY7qvaa	Mentally or physically?

8SPRJUHIaa	Ok this is the advice I was given from My Naturalpath/Homeopath who was also a medical doctor first.  This is what he told me when I was really ill.  I also have fairly pale skin and would tend to have a sensitivity to sun exposure at the time. (In early spring and summer I had to be careful going out in the sun before I got a little bit of a tan, I had to really gently ease myself into going in the sun or I would break out in hives, and I have always burned easily in the sun).    Bundle up as much as you can for the cold.  He told me to go outside with no sunscreen on the skin. face my upper back/shoulders to the sun, this was the area that would give me the most benefit.  He said the most beneficial time of the day  for getting sun is in the morning the earlier the better but, before 9am.  He said that all that is needed to get the vitamin D benefits from the sun is a total of 15 minutes a day.  So if I was too cold, to stay out as long as I could and then come in.  He said that if it was really cold though to not do it.  Sometimes I went out and just faced my face and as much of my neck as I could if it was too cold, just so that I could do something.  He also had me take vitamin D supplements.  But apparently the supplements are not as beneficial as the actual sunlight, and you need sunlight to best use the supplements.    I did notice a difference doing this, and it was good to get some fresh air.  Depending on the illness going out in the cold could be more detrimental than not though, so you have to use judgement.  I didn't have and respiratory symptoms or anything that would have made it unadvisable to breath cold air.  I mostly took advantage of warmer days and did what I could on colder days.    Hope this helps :)|`|lMAzjhRAaa	It's not enough to get vit. D, the problem is with activating it.  In medicine there are only few drugs with vit. d activated, so even with good diet, and vitamin supplements there is an need of sun.    (as you see above 2h. should be good;] )|`|YlLdIPRvaa	You actually don't need the sun to get your vitamin D.  You don't want to risk those harmful rays.  Try eating fish, eggs, bread or milk to get the vitamin D you need.  Otherwise take a dietary supplement.  If you must get some rays, wear a light SPF such as 25 and don't stay out in the sun for more than two hours without reapplying.|`|g6pqGjrkaa	One to Two hours or  sun in early morning and in the evening will give you sufficient Vitamin D.|`|h5xSfcT6aa	just a few hours. but dont forget, there are other sources of vitamin D, not just the sun.  x

I wouldnt let them do it while i was pregnant because there was a risk of it causing early labor. So after I had the baby I got the procedure done. They had to put me to sleep. The results came back negative and I've had normal pap test results ever since and that was 11 years ago. I know it's a lot but try not to worry, you will be fine.
nUu7tUiqaa	There could be many reasons for this. You could be nervous, or there may not be enough foreplay. A lot of women just do not get wet enough, and that's just how their bodies are. A way to remedy this would be to use a lubricant.
nUu7tUiqaa	Yes, while on Yaz birth control you will experience breast tenderness for the first 3-6 months. And it is perfectly normal to experience a growth in your breasts as well.
VpQ5ZmsMaa	A rare hymen take a look here  http://www.healthystrokes.com/hymengalle...
VpQ5ZmsMaa	I got pregnant of Yaz lol. I missed a pill. I hate taking the pills everyday.  I like using the Nuva Ring. Even tough it is a ring in ur vagina u actually don't feel it and don't have to worry about taking pills daily. When having sex my partner don't feel it, and if  he does he don't mind. U wont lose it in ur vagina and it wont fall out if inserted properly ;)|`|hkbWhfCiaa	I take it and am looking to get off of it b/c I have crazy mood swings too and it doesn't help with my acne or lighter/less cramping periods.|`|SiSplXXsaa	I like it. I take it mainly for acne, and it works well on that count. I never had serious PMS symptoms, however, so I'm not a good judge of that, but it certainly doesn't make it worse for me.|`|uBssj3Znaa	YAZ really messed me up. I started spotting and got even worse cramps than I got before. I had to switch off of it and on to something else.     My bff takes it and it works just fine for her.|`|N4oLz5vsaa	idk|`|cSqx1DxKaa	It seriously made me into a crazy person.  My moods were all over the charts.  The only one I tried that was worse was Seasonale.  Each pill affects each woman differently, though.
a0v3q3J4aa	Deprived means you are being forced to go without.  So sexually deprived means you are forced to go without sexual stimulation.|`|s1h5MDz0aa	it means you have sexual needs that doesn't get satisfied.|`|hyWypfFLaa	your deprived of sex! no ones giving it to you! thats pretty much it
EocoZH1Laa	Yeah, you can do it without a condom. Personally, I would still use one though cause of STD's. But if that's not an issue for you then your good to go.|`|SiSplXXsaa	You're good to go for pregnancy protection, but remember the pill doesn't protect against any STDs.|`|s1h5MDz0aa	YET? please don't do it ever it's to many diseases going around for anyone to be unprotected ever. so good luck with that|`|a0v3q3J4aa	There is never a such thing as "fully protected" even with birth control or a condom there is still a possibility of pregnancy or an STD.|`|nMzzwrtUaa	Well honestly you will never be 100% protected as long as you have the ability to have a child. But as for protected as in its safer to go all the way with out it yes, most pills and injections are 99.9% effective, also on the pill if you have been on another birth Controller will be fully effective after 2 weeks, if you have never been on birth Control before it takes 3weeks to a month.
lXE75yQjaa	Hmm..I'd say I was about 12 when I got mine to look like that. good luck!|`|6lmFyr2maa	depends my brother turned 15 on saturday and he can already grow a beard like that whereas my cousin is 18 and he only has thin blonde whispy hairs on his chin.    xxx|`|Btsctjydaa	50.|`|8HDQMkSBaa	when you are old enough|`|Vft6LQR4aa	It all depends. I started shaving when I was 13.  My brother and I started shaving at the same time, though he is 2 1/2 years older than me.  My beard has always been fuller than his.  That is kind of a puny beard anyway; it's patchy.  There's no way of telling when your beard will get to be like that, or even if you'll have a beard.|`|Gw1LLzDgaa	Why would you want to?  He would look SO much better and sexier without the beard.    Have a pleasant day.    Kind thoughts,    Hermes
8a416d7a9120dc7e86c907efa9323194aa	you should start the sunday after your period starts. you shouldve started yesterday but you might want to wait now until your next period and the sunday after it starts or ends.....you could take it today but take the one for sundat and monday. if you miss a day you would have to double up.

Your period can be delayed due to the inconsistent bc pill use. If your period doesn't come, take a pregnancy test that is designed for early detection in 4 days.    Also, once you start having more sex, you will learn not to freak out that you might be pregnant every time you do it, especially if you use condoms and bc, making it less than 1% chance of pregnancy occurring.|`|SbiNNM3Caa	chill out  i tk it as well  sometimes when on bc  u wont get your period right after you finish taking the three weeks of colored pills  um well....  if you'd tried sooner you could of taking plan B   but that only works up to 72hrs after sex i think  try a pregnancy test  stay calm  and hell no are you having a kid at 16!!!!  even if your bf is sweet enough to say he'll get a job  but you guys are so not ready to be parents  so find out for sure  and if yes   then google places called parental control centers  they'll helped  ...  um good luck  and next time  try to stay consistent with the bc  and tk plan b if your not sure  =D|`|tPOvhDOVaa	give it time!!!! it was your fist time and it will impact your body more than you  think it will!!!|`|keEwsjxYaa	you;re only a day late ! don't worry too much. but take a pregnancy test just in case.  goodluck x|`|rfkVin6Iaa	RELAX!

If it doesn't come at all than just take a pregnancy test but chances are it will show up today or tomorrow|`|WUwdDxWMaa	Just take your pills as usual sometimes this happens with BC your period may come aday or to late if you start a new pack stop taking them immediatly and see your doctor there a lot of great options for pregnant teens|`|fBe2cD42aa	Wait a couple more days and see if it comes.  If not, then you need to tell your mom or another responsible adult.|`|VPIMMbX7aa	umm it depends how long have you had your period if no0t a year there not on a track! i think you will be just fine|`|1QCMJZKzaa	don't worry, you wont be preganant, you just probably missed it, it happends all the time after the first time you do it, and anyway if you was pregnant, which yr probably not, they is a thing called abortion     hope this helped,  try not to worry,   xoxo|`|OkC3uiCMaa	It is normal that you don't have your period regularly with 16.  My mother didn't have her period for one year when she was your age but that was because she was dieting. So I wouldn't worry about that.|`|Rf2r23sYaa	Don't freak out. Keep taking your pills. It sounds like you doubled up on birth control (condoms and pills) and you should be totally fine. You've done everything right. When I was 17 and on the pill I pretty much always missed my period after I had sex and I was never pregnant. I think it was because of stress. Just take your pills at the same time every day and you'll be fine. If you're really freaked out you can do a pregnancy test now and it should be accurate since you're already late.|`|6qsocyK3aa	The first thing to do is not panic. It could be anything - pregnancy isn't the only cause of a missed period. Sounds like you're really stressed which could have caused you to miss it. Wait a few days. If you don't get one within three weeks, I would take a pregnancy test. But as long as you were careful, chances are you will be ok.|`|8a416d7a9120dc7e86c907efa9323194aa	more than likely you arent pregnant. but you are late because you had sex for the 1st time and its delaying your period. continue taking your pills as authorized and you should be fine. stressing and panicking can also delay your period so think positive and everything should be fine.|`|liVa8foFaa	don't freak out just yet. you can go on the shot if its hard for you to remember the pill. i know it was hard for me.one day is not a long time.stress can cause that and you sound stressed. relax you will be ok|`|oBJE2Iwjaa	Calm down chill out first things first because you dont take ur BC pills regularly ur throwing ur cycle off second ur first time will have ur body a little off balance...if the time gets up there and there is no flow than take a preg test if it comes back positive than its time to think of the next step.    P.S. I wouldnt go off of anything ur man said because when it comes time to pony up and take care of the baby most dudes disappear make sure if it does come to fruition you both sit down and talk about it and have a plan.|`|0SIhrYCbaa	Calm down and wait a week. I doubt your pregnant.|`|HxURXoe2aa	1 day late is not an issue girlfriend! calm down! if the condom didnt break you cannot get pregnant! take your birth control at the same time everyday or you WILL get pregnant. sometimes when you start having sex your hormones get all screwed up and your period either comes early or late... another possibility... if you start thinking that you may be prego and you get all anxietied up about it, your body may start to think its prego too even though its not. relax. tell yourself its ok... and take those damn pills! SAME TIME EVERYDAY!|`|BhzvMik2aa	just relax, your period could be late sumtimes...over stress....just dont think about it..you will get it|`|FblO18IRaa	Just because your a day late doesn't mean your pregnant.  I'm a Virgin and my period is always later then that.  Don't worry about it, you'll be fine.|`|KgxvYh46aa	Your period can be late under stress... so if your stressed, that could be it... take a test ASAP and if it now positive, then just RELAX... everything will be fine....

aQ8o4w3Xaa	I'd say there's a pretty big chance you're pregnant. Pregnancy tests measure the amount of HCG. That's a hormone that's only produced when pregnant. Therefore, unless the test was faulty (which is unlikely) you're pregnant. Take another test and then go for a blood test too. Just be to 100%.     Good luck and congratulations!  :)|`|0CP3yWK8aa	yes amy mom did but we didnt tell my dad it could be to early  or if you take depo shot it could also be taking that as a positive reading u should wait at least 2 weeks befor going to a doctor|`|3b9a6e79ee30cd0d6e0e9a57fca9c99eaa	Wait a week from the second test and then retest. If it is negative, then I would assume you are not pregnant. If you don't get your period on time then call the doctor. If it is positive, then call the doctor.  Could be the first test was expired.
0YzP6iOTaa	I am not sure why you bloat, but I do know that after you have a baby your body changes, and things you had no problem digesting before you have trouble digesting now. After I had my first baby I developed lactose intolerance and after my 3rd baby I was able to eat anything dairy with no problem    Congrats on the new baby!!
Rk46lIBwaa	There are 2 ways to effectively postpone a period. The pill can be used and in which case it is usual to run 2 complete packs together, ie take 42 pills in a row and then allow a withdrawal bleed. If there are any concerns or contraindications to the pill, the progesterone norithisterone is the next choice.|`|9cba094486c6e7ab49a59ac5ea44682faa	For special occasions you can defer your period by skipping your 7 day withdrawal break and starting the next pack of pills immediately.     You'd then need to finish the second pack (take it for 21 days) and then have your 7 day break.|`|xm0kLvnLaa	Of course !|`|X58gVB7Eaa	It depends on what pill your talking about.  Both the birth control pill and the plan B pill could alter your cycle.   When using a birth control pil you can have irregular periods for up to a year sometimes. When using the plan b pill, your period after you've taken it might be irregular as well.|`|G3eYnXhFaa	When is your wedding? The pill can take a while to settle in your system, some people suffer from irregular periods or spotting for a while.  I have been on a few different types of the pill, mycrogynon (im from the uk so names of medicines may be different) is when you take the pills for 21 days, have a 7 day break where you have your period then carry on, and yes you can carry it over so you dont have the period break. i think you can only do this twice on the run and then you need to have the break inbetween.  The pill I'm on now (cerazette) i dont have a period at all, i take a pill everyday with no breaks (havent had a period in over a year). a friend who took it as well said it made her gain weight but ive found i have lost weight since trying it, depends on the person i guess.  the best person to ask is your local doctor or the family planning center :) enjoy your honeymoon!|`|W9giH5dZaa	yes u can do that,but how soon is it till u go on yr honeymoon [congratulations by the way]as it may take time to find the right pill to suite u.an aslo may need a couple of weeks to get in to yr Sistem.|`|r9WhvImaaa	dont really know what u mean by this but u can 'skip' a period by not having the 'break' in your pack and continue taking the next pack you wont have a period then
hHjfoKEHaa	Is this all for no reason? If you have had a tragic experience recently or you're under a lot of stress then there's nothing wrong with you. It will pass, just hang in there. If it is for no reason then you may have depression. For starters try exercising, it will boost your serotonin levels (serotonin is a neurotransmitter that boosts your mood, sleep and apetite). Also, remind yourself of all your good experiences, force yourself to think positive. This will only help if you have mild depression. If you have serious clinical depression, then its best if you get help asap. Talk to your GP.
yY2Czxy2aa	As far as I can tell, there are no proven weight loss benefits from the acai berry, juice, or capsules.    It does seem to be a great supplement (I take it, but don't sell the stuff!) and is full of anti oxidents, which help prevent damage to your body. But that's what you should take it for, not weight loss or fat burning.     The acai berry itself is an amazing thing - has a lot of anti oxidents etc and is really good for you.    But there's nothing really to suggest in scientific terms that it helps with weight loss.     And there are a lot of scams out there, be careful where you buy it from!    I take it, and I think I feel healthier and better. But it's not some type of magic formula, sorry.|`|al0cCPb6aa	I used it and it didn't work. I thought it sucked. LOL      I use Alli along with wuyi tea which I buy off of ebay. It's really helped me lose weight. I did 1 month of Acai then one month of Ali and the tea and I lost like 3 times the freaking fat. Acai did absolutely nothing.|`|73U1wJmnaa	I haven't taken Acai Berry yet but its supposed to cleanse your body of toxins and is a good source of antioxidants. Its also supposed to help you lose weight. I would recommend going to a store called GNC (General Nutrition Center). You can go online and find a store close to you. And no, I don't work for GNC lol. I've been going there for years. But I dont know if they have it there, so Im not making any promises.|`|rjwDfBkyaa	Acai can cause yo-yo deiting as some say. Which means you lose a lot of weight then gain it back. This is what can easily happen with acai because when you lose all the weight and get off of it, it is just as easy to gain the weight back as it ever was. Try exercise and a healthy diet including all the food groups.|`|S730dpLfaa	WARNING! Read this blog before trying Acai Berry!  http://acaiberryscams.wordpress.com/2008...  Thanks to this blog, it helped me a lot to choose the best.  Hope this helps :-)
mExAfokFaa	i had the same problem, but i was 15, 5 foot 5, and 120 lbs, and had small man boobs, i started doing alot of chest work, mainly bench press, free weights, and push-up s using my body weight, alot of running, just to get my cardio up.
b3892e48ce1ff2d86e671ceef5fd7a83aa	I'm going to be honest here and I hope I don't hurt your feelings, I just want to be honest :)    Well, I think it's awesome that you want to help people, but I would be skeptical about someone I met online- and skeptical about their credentials. When I used to see my psychiatrist, I liked seeing those big diplomas on the wall from a reputable university. I also liked having the knowledge that because I knew he was an actual doctor my confidentiality would be respected and I would have recourse should he violate doctor patient privilege or proscribe something wrong. Not that he ever would- but, you know, he had something to lose. :)    I mean, anyone can say that they are an online counselor right? Who says they aren't just some person in Mom's basement trying to take my money? There's no real way of seeing an online counselor's diploma. There are also a lot of scary people online with very bad intentions. I would be hesitant to start therapy with someone I knew only from online because you would have to know a lot of very personal things about your clients, which, if you were a predator (I know you aren't but I'm just saying...) would scare me, especially being a woman. My sister had a horrible experience with somebody she met online who was not who they said they were.     It's an interesting idea, especially since so many with mental issues are unable to leave their houses, or it is extremely difficult. Not to mention the shortage of mental health practitioners and the fact that people with these issues often have zero support due to isolation and stigma. But personally, I would be scared to start a relationship with an online counselor unless I was referred by a doctor I trusted, or unless it was through a program run by a valid local hospital.     And I would be very leery of a doctor who advertised vigorously.     I do think it's great that you want to help people though, heaven knows so many need it right now. I hope that you find a way that works for you and others.     All the best!|`|PEgNshyqaa	i thought about this once. i still think about it sometimes. and i always find that's its a bit weird. i mean i can't imagine myself talking with a complete stranger who i can't see and actually tell him my problems and follow his advice.  it's hard enough to go to counceling in real life.

RXI8ImdIaa	I just had one of those! It wasn't bad at all. You will be under conscious sedation - technically you are conscious, but, you're high as a kite. You might fall asleep, and chances are you will forget most of it even if you didn't fall asleep.    It does not hurt at all due to the sedatives and pain relievers. I remember an uncomfortable sensation with the scope moving around trying to get around a bend inside my colon, like I could feel it bumping around, but as soon as he was done maneuvering it I forgot about it. It wasn't painful really, just a weird feeling.    After the procedure I had no pain at all. I had a very small amount of blood with the first stool, due to the fact that he took a few biopsies of the colon wall. But it was just a bit of blood without pain.     Hope this helps. There's really nothing to worry about as far as pain goes, they will keep you comfortable and relaxed.|`|NY2fpmvPaa	My grandpa just had one and he wont speak to anyone about it.

But there's a little bit of a difference between a man getting it and a woman getting it, mentally mostly.|`|DfABElERaa	I have had around 5 or 6 of them done, they really aren't that bad. Most of the time you will have anesthesia and won't feel a thing.

The pictures you get afterwards are cool too =)|`|a12cbnR4aa	Most people go back to work the next day after a colonoscopy. I think it just depends on what they find when they are in there.

It's not as bad as you'd think apparently. Just uncomfortable rather than painful. Apparently the worst bit is cleaning out your bowel beforehand. It's like have diarrohea and needing to go really urgently so make sure you stay near a toilet! Good luck!|`|woOeYFrEaa	The actual colonoscopy is no sweat.  They sedate you and you don't remember a thing.  My mom had one as have some friends.  The worst part is the day before.  You have to drink an entire gallon of a medication that simply put, completely empties your intestines so you basically spend the whole day running to the toilet.    So if you can get past choking down that oily fluid, you'll be fine!|`|X8gIe9Tqaa	check out this link it may put your mind to rest    xxx    http://experience.patient.co.uk/discussi...|`|YsQQ30YJaa	No big. I had one last year. you drink this stuff called "go lightly" or something similar to clean you out -and it DOES! Then you go and they lay you down and give you a shot to nearly knock you out. they wheel you on the bed into the exam room amd tell you to roll over on your side. Then they give you another shot in the tube they have in you and then you are waking up in the recovery room none the worse for wear.  Just thinking about it was far worse than the actual exam.  I have no fear of ever having one again.|`|nHRJFZoTaa	I had this procedure done last summer. The hardest part was drinking the solution to clean your colon. It tastes awful, but once you drink it, the worst is over. Several stories around about how you have to live in the bathroom, not true for me. Once your system is clean, it's clean. Next day I showed up for exam. I was put on my side, given a pillow and went to sleep for about twenty minutes. When I woke up, I felt fine and went home. I have no reservations or regrets about doing it, I now know I am healthy!|`|f6YsA2kfaa	everyone that i know that has had them say that there was nothing to them. they sadate you before the exam. there's nothing to worry about, it takes 20 min.|`|7bzVWfyJaa	It's one of the best and easiest things I've ever done for myself.  My doctor sedates his patients and when you count to 10 (if you make it that far) you're out and wake up in minutes.  It's wonderful and I had very little discomfort - it's normal to stay home for a day or two after a colonoscopy...  Good luck and schedule yours!  :-)

Doing lots of ab exercises is irrelevant if your abs are covered in a layer of fat. To get abs, you need to get your body fat down with diet and exercise. And ab exercises wont make fat over your belly go away, either. Abdominal exercises rarely make a difference in how you look, though the can be beneficial for other reasons.    A clean diet and exercise program will get you a six pack. Reduce your bodyfat % and add some muscle all over your body. Best way to do that is to do heavy compound exercises (squats, deadlifts, benchpress). A good routine can be found here;    http://newbie-fitness.blogspot.com/2006/...

Most super markets have many different varieties of them! Let's go drink a six pack together!!    Enjoy.|`|fcaasfx0aa	I could be wrong, but I think that's mostly genetic. You can have flat abs without having a six pack, but to actually get those lines...not much you can do for that. But by all means, strengthen your abdominal muscles.|`|iAv9P3HTaa	here are the best exercises for hard core abs:    Side Bends    * Holding a dumbbell in you right hand, stand with feet shoulder width apart and your knees slightly bent.  * Place your left hand behind your head and slowly bend sideways to your right lowering the dumbbell down to your knee.  * Return to an upright position and repeat for the desired number of reps.    Medicine Ball Sit Ups    * Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor.  * Hold a medicine ball (choose a 5 pound ball to begin) to your chest and have a partner stand at your feet (not on them).  * Push your lower back into the floor flattening the arch and hold.  * As you curl up throw the ball to your partner. Hold the crunch as your partner catches the ball and throws it back to you.  * Catch the ball and slowly return to the start position.  * Tip: Don't sit right the way up as you wait for the return pass. Your shoulders should be no more than 6 inches off the floor.    Weighted Curls with Medicine Ball    * Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor.  * Hold a medicine ball (or weight plate) to your chest (start with 5 pounds).  * Push your lower back into the floor flattening the arch and hold.  * Curl up just enough to lift both your shoulders off the floor a few inches.  * Hold for a count of 2 and return to the start position.    Cable Crunch    * This exercise requires a triceps pushdown machine with a rope attachment.  * Knee down in font of the machine holding the rope just above your head.  * Slowly crunch down to your right knee and hold for 2 seconds as you breathe out.  * Return to the start position slowly and repeat to the left knee.    Abdominal Exercise Guidelines  Perform several (3-5) abdominal exercises 3-5 times a week. Start with exercises and repetitions that are comfortable for your fitness level and as you improve increase the number of repetitions. You do not need to do all the exercises; simply select those that work well for you and vary your routine over the months.|`|TuOp3hNPaa	got the best one for ya right here.  first jus lay down on ur back. put ur thumbs under ur butt. then keeping ur legs straight lift them up to about a 90 degree angle with ur body. idk how strong u r now but i started out at 30 an now i can do 60. these work great.  another swt exercise is to lay on ur side an jus prop one elbow up. so all ur weight should be on tht one elbow an ur feet. do both sides then lay on ur stomach an prop both elbows up under u. so its like ur doin a pushup exept ur on ur elbows.     i first do this eldow one for a min an half both sides then middle. then i do the liftin ur legs up to a 90 degree angle one about 60 times. i have great abs now.  do it everyother day.

But, I'm not an expert, if you are not sastified with hearing "there's nothing you can do about it" go see many doctors until one finally listens! Good luck.
JSMAZdLAaa	what did you do to lose it?|`|t81MEJ82aa	Most of it is probably not fat that you've lost. Much of it is probably water weight, so make sure that you are staying hydrated. But you need to provide more information. Are you trying to lose weight? How much do you weigh?     Healthy weight loss is said to be 1-2 pounds per week, but if you are morbidly obese that number can come up a little bit.|`|SSKqEaYdaa	The first question is are you trying to lose weight?  If you are not trying to lose weight, I would be more concerned than if you are.  That said, it is healthy to lose 1-2 pounds per week.  If you are losing weight much faster than this, you are not eating enough or are exercising too much, et cetera.
YFuIOVq0aa	It is a raw product with no preservatives  which is why it works for cradle cap  but can't be left on all day or the smell will let you know when it has been on too long    Suggestion:  1. use a baby brush and gently brush his hair - emphasis on gently, the intent is to remove loose flakes   2. apply oil to scalp being gently and applying enough to soak area with oil  3. leave on about an hour and bathe baby using normal means to wash scalp thus removing unabsorbed oil without "scratching his head"  4. repeat before each bath    cradle cap is a build up of dead skin, it also makes itself worse because the skin underneath can't breathe    a layer of oil will rehydrate dry skin but if left on too long it can actually make cradle cap worse    good luck and enjoy that wee one, they grow way too fast :)|`|IM3QwSS2aa	coconut oil is a RAW Food item.

I've been using coconut oil for a few years (not with kids) and thats never happened, nor is it supposed to. cocont oil of kept securely, should last a long long while. (not go rancid by the end of the day)|`|r97Rzm6waa	I agree with the others that it's probably gone "off", try olive oil next time (i know it's more expensive), but a little goes a long way.  Most supermarkets do their own brand now.  Less likely to go smelly i think!
IM3QwSS2aa	doesn't sound physical, sounds like something stressing you out mentally.      until the source of the distress can be located, take some Papaya concentrate drink (not already mixed up from the factory juice, concentrate), some Peppermint tea.    I've experienced that when my mother was living. Growing up in a very Religious household, sin was not the common word to be used.  Don't do this; don't do that.  Unfortunately when Mom passed, well, Jerome seemed to have forgotten his upbringings and well.... fill in the blanks.    Mind you there's a higher power looking not Mom that I had to answer to.  I have not been sick with nausea since.  Still have to answer to God.    /Jerome|`|UZxeBrxQaa	Stress combined with anxiety.    The problem is most likely mental/emotional.  Dependent on your age and home situation, you may wish to speak to a specialist about treating the underlying causes of the physical symptoms.    You alleviate the nausea by calming down.|`|vszOEaOZaa	just a shot here-are you sure you don't have food allergies to what you're eating?  you said you changed your diet. how drastic?  are you still eating stuff you used to or a lot of new stuff?  if you were deficient in anything that you corrected, make sure you didn't add anything new doing that correction.|`|sVn0Sy7taa	u need to see MORE doctors!   there could be plenty of reasons why u feel sick all the time & it could just take something simple to fix it!

hoDin3UYaa	Considering the fact that you fractured it near the growth plate, this is most likely the cause of the pain and discomfort. I would suggest revisiting your doctor, who can determine the cause of the pain.    As for re breaking it, yes, they would either put you to sleep or give you a numbing agent.|`|ACMPEzqQaa	I'd use http://hubpages.com/hub/Speed-healing-of... to fix it and stay very far away from doctors.     The major problem is this is multiple old injuries to the same location it's going to take massive amounts of time and effort to clean up. I absolutely hate fixing old injuries.|`|lXDK0iuraa	Did you ever get it checked out, if you didnt it may have healed wrong, like my Uncle got in savere motorcycle accident when he was in his 20s hes know in his 50s and found out he had displaced sevral verdabria that cant be fixed, since your still young they may be able to help you still, they would rebrake it and set it so it can heal properly, its either that or live with a bumb ankle.

But if you want to show her something....|`|QcP1lJU5aa	Okay first of all you both need to relax. sounds like you are both fairly young since you are in school still. Lumps don't always mean breast cancer. Most of the time soreness and stinging aren't signs of cancer. What could be the cause of the lumps and soreness is caffeine, most young women don't realize that caffeine will cause your breast to become lumpy and makes it harder to read a mamo. lay off the pop and take 400iu. of vitamin E it helps with breast health. Of course she should be seen by a doctor to make sure everything is okay,  It's always the right choice.|`|ahzL8uCKaa	i don't know the answer to your question but i will pray for you both!|`|224d1d60d1b56362532d0d7f33ab994daa	Teenagers don't get breast cancer.|`|799756bd4c88f2ce87a508802ca1e9cdaa	Cottage Cheese and Flax Oil Cures Cancer!     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSoddptWL...

f0e6bb08f78bda5965b94f88de6064f6aa	You should be able too now. If still in doubt call the office of the surgeon who did the procedure.  Why a pacemaker so young?|`|AA10301974	The pacemaker will feel uncomfortable for one or two months. The tissue around the pacemaker is badly bruised. That will take a couple weeks to heal. After that you have a heavy weight that will take time to get use to. Until the weight of the device becomes unnoticeable, whenever it shifts it might wake you up.     Don't overdo exercise or activities. I did as much as I was capable of and the disuse locked all of the muscles in my shoulder. It was 3 months before the muscles would correctly move my arm above my head without assistance. I literally had a few points that my arm got stuck at and needed a push. Laying down to go to sleep was a horrifyingly painful experience as you move your shoulder muscles move to different positions when you are laying down.|`|TORBP6QIaa	If you can get comfy on your left side you can sleep on it as soon as you want.
AA10412333	if you are really having a problem and are in that much pain. Go to a doctor. I have had hemmerhiod after having my children and in the hospital they used cold pads soaked in witch hazel.

CZ1nO9C9aa	There is fluid buildup in your ear.  That means air isn't going into your ear from the outside.  There is no flow of air into your ear.  So, when you swallow, you're actually sucking air from your nose, mouth, AND ear (they are all connected by a tube), and the suction in you ear from swallowing causes crackling of the fluid that is stuck in your ear.  If your ear weren't fluidy, then air would just flow straight into your ear when you swallowed and you wouldn't feel anything.    It isn't really a problem unless it persists for a week or more..... and if the cracking is really loud..... then go see a doctor.    This happens to me all the time and always goes away.|`|rdzcF7R8aa	Your inner ears are linked by their drainage canals to your throat. Thus the way you swallow is presurizing the canals. There may be no way to get rid of it sorry.|`|rxpOgXSdaa	I had this a couple times before. Its known as swimmers ear, where access fluid is built up inside the canal. for myself personally, i had to make an appointment to get them to get rid of the popping sound, after months of aggravation. I'm not sure if there is any home remedies you have option to besides the waiting game. i would make a doctors visit because that popping noise can definitely drive you nuts.
IM3QwSS2aa	No. Some men experience Phimosis.  The foreskin DOES NOT retract causing some minor or major problems that require the removal of the foreskin.    /jerome, doesn't have to worry about that, he's cut.|`|2uUctFHEaa	circumcision is when you get the skin removed off your penis through an operation. the foreskin does roll back when you go through puberty. so both are correct.|`|UZxeBrxQaa	The foreskin does not retreat during adulthood.  It must be cut off if it becomes a problem.  I suggest you wash that area very carefully every time you bathe.  This will prevent any infection problems, and foreskin discoloration that may result if you don't keep that area clean.|`|AA10350894	If you are UNcircumcised, at some point you will be able to roll your foreskin back. Occasionally some men have trouble doing this or can't do it at all, for several reasons, but a trip to the doc can take care of that, often with out having to be circumcised.|`|K4zsztkRaa	What?    No one needs to be circumcised, that's a false statment.  There is no reason to be circumcised.    The skin does not "rool back" durring puberty. If you don't have any skin covering the head of your penis then you are circumcised.    No one needs to be circumcised, and no the skin doesn't roll back durring puberty.    It rools back in the sense that you can pull it back all the way. But it doesn't rool back and disaapear as if you were circumcised.    You need to make your question clearer, you aren't making sense.    -Connor|`|pzLDXL6gaa	You're confusing retracting the foreskin with having it cut off.    Some people get it cut off - circumcisoin. Usually done at birth.    Everybody who doesn't get that pointless operation finds that their foreskin will become able to be pulled back, some time in childhood through to adolescence. 12 is fine, the average age is 10 so yeah it can be anywhere around there really.    Harriet|`|awF6QvEQaa	no it rolls back when u get a bon er.. but u still have it when its not hard it looks the same as it does now      if its always back then did it get stuck? is it really tight or something?? u sure ur circumcised|`|72iZuDjeaa	it's a surgical procedure... an unnecessary one that mutilates the penis of unsuspecting defenseless infants|`|GrqsnWtiaa	No you have to get it done surgically, i dont see a point in foreskin, if your just gonna pull it back anyways|`|937d8516b6bac65675aebed05fbfdfc9aa	leave your penis alone it is fine and natural|`|3156c54d8f966e51776af0486120bb1daa	Circumcision is the surgical removal of the foreskin from the end of the penis to permanently expose the glans (head).  It is most frequently performed in early infancy, but can be done at any age.    From about the age of 8 a boy should be able to freely retract his foreskin to expose the whole glans.  If he cannot do this both when flaccid and erect he is suffering from phimosis and will normally need a circumcision to permanently cure the problem.  Parents need to teach their uncircumcised sons to fully retract daily to wash under the foreskin.    At puberty, when the glans usually grows somewhat faster then the foreskin, it is quite usual for the foreskin to fully retract on its own during an erection.  However, not all foreskins do fully auto-retract and need to be manually assisted.  This too is perfectly normal.    If you have a particularly short foreskin then it may permanently retract behind the glans during puberty.  This is perfectly OK as long as the foreskin remains fairly loose and does not compress the erect penis.    You indicate that your own foreskin is permanently retracted.  This is quite good as you are able to keep yourself free of smegma much more easily.  Whilst a full circumcision would bring a few more benefits you already have the best of both worlds and should be fairly happy with your situation.|`|ScHW4842aa	i reckon you are circumcised already.|`|q1YDp1y3aa	its not too soon, you're perfectly normal. The average age is between 10 and 12. It shouldn't be back all the time, just when you pull it back or you have an erection. Leaving it back all the time can potentially cause problems. -Neb|`|4arnbpUCaa	Don't worry, sounds normal.|`|iX5p5pHwaa	wht pick me as ure top ansers plz

No drink 4 you.|`|ToztjpAsaa	You can easily go for 30-45 minutes exercise without having to constantly sip water.  I find the constant sloshing extremely irritating, so I tend not to bother carrying any liquid when I'm running, unless I'm on a particularly long run (90 minutes plus).    Fizzy drink are great when you're running if you want stomach cramps or you want to throw up.|`|5VdB8njTaa	Yes, water, definitely not fizzy drinks.

Fizzy drinks are a no no, they fill you up with gas and do not quench thirst very well. Great at the end of exercise to liven up your throat but otherwise no.

e7eb28bb492c5eedd55da24da0a04504aa	Read this...  http://www.healthy-skincare.com/chigger-...    Treatment for Chigger Bite     The best possible treatment for chiggar bite is to remove the chigger right away. This will lessen the severity and length of time that the symptoms will be experienced. Chiggers can be removed by taking a shower in warm soapy water. Even light rubbing of the skin with a towel or cloth is enough to remove the chiggers.     Itching, hives or welts, and skin redness can be relieved by following the usual treatments for these symptoms. Therefore, for a standard treatment for chiggar bite, visit the mosquito bite treatment page. These treatments basically involve the use of hydrocortisone creams or antihistamines. There are also commercially available products as specific treatments for chiggar bites.     Time is the best treatment for chiggar bite. The feeding tube is what creates a lot of the symptoms and it cannot be removed. However, eventually the body breaks down the skin tissue that forms the tube and the healing begins. This process can take from 10 days to three weeks.     Because of the intense itching and scratching, skin infections can occur due to the skin becoming abraded. If signs of infection are present such as growing areas of redness, pain, inflamed and hot skin, appearance of puss, and fever, then a physician should be consulted immediately. Therefore, using an effective treatment for chigger bite is very important.     Some people require a more complex treatment for chigger bite because they experience an allergic reaction to the bite. Signs of a severe allergic reaction can include trouble breathing, tightness in the throat or chest, feeling faint, dizziness, hives, and/or nausea and vomiting. In these cases, the treatment for chigger bite requires a visit to the emergency room or physician as soon as possible.
ohsxAbeuaa	dont be scared honey. sex is a beautiful thing if with the right person. dont do it with mister right now but with someone you REALLY trust. so you feel confident to tell him to stop because it hurts or to take it slow especially if your doing it with someone with expierence. as for me it hurt a little bit but nothing really to be scared of. remember always to use a condom and communication is key! :]|`|ugvgt6rMaa	Yeah it does hurt but not on everybody. Like if your comfortable than you'll be okay but i think that either way you're going to be scared for the first time. Just don't worry and take it easy.

hoDin3UYaa	I would suggest calling or re-visiting our doctor, and seeing if he could possibly give you a torso sling or a sling that would better support your shoulder.    In response to "scruffycat", doctors very rarely ever apply a shoulder spica cast these days. This type of cast is only used for a severe shoulder fracture or dislocation.|`|ZGj4ww9jaa	you can put a towel under the sling it may help...|`|a993fdffebb5d1eb64fe6baba1499d98aa	Ow! I did that 43 years ago when I was 4... only I broke both collar bones. They put me in a giant cast and called it "wings."  If you are still swollen, I can see why they didn't put a cast on. Still, I think another visit to the doc is in order, if the sling is not alleviating the pain.

That said, in watching Patrick Swayze, he said something I could relate to.  When he drank Champagne, it felt like acid being poured in to a wound.

Some people can't eat hot peppers or spicy foods because they have a "delicate" stomach.  Alcohol does the same thing as spicy foods, it irritates a sensitive mucus membrane.    Your stomach is lined with a mucus membrane to protect it from the hydrochloric acid in your digestive system.  If alcohol bothers you, don' t drink it, ever!|`|LykjWv6faa	Alcohol is not good for the stomach and may lead to ulcers.

Alcohol absorption through the stomach lining can cause irritation.  Some people are more sensitive to it than others, and you may be someone who is more sensitive to it.    However, if it causes extensive pain this is something to discuss with your doctor as it may be a problem with breaking down the alcohol after it is ingested.|`|pCWLjFVoaa	i advise you to drink more... maybe you just need to build a tolerance (at least a little) to help with your stomach aches... or maybe you do have a ulcer and you should go to the hospital... now.|`|Vgr2CnEZaa	Maybe you have gastritis or maybe your drink is too strong.

Most people don't know that when you get your cholesterol measured, it's actually a total cholesterol, the sum of different types of cholesterol. The components are LDL (and subtypes), HDL, and triglycerides.    Triglycerides are generally elevated because of diet. If you're trigs are elevated, modify your diet to limit your intake of fat. You don't want to completely cut it out which is not healthy. At the same time, you can take niacin to lower your trigs. You can buy niacin over the counter.    With regard to LDL, diet and exercise does help, but most people may need pharmacologic help. Statins are a great class of drug. I'm on statin and I don't even have high cholesterol.

73nTYgdraa	That guy before me is incorrect. You still have two more years to grow. The body stops evolving by the time you're 20 years old.  But your height is pretty good, but you might have stopped growing.  You do share both of your parents genetics, so maybe you're from your mother's height and your dads looks. Same as me.|`|16vMIGPiaa	Most human beings' height peaks out in puberty.  Testosterone tells the pituitary to throttle back producing growth hormone.  It's all genetics; you may not get to be as tall as your father.  And you may continue to grow a bit more; I did until I was 22.|`|MHCyHjaRaa	sorry to tell you this but i think you're done growing.. you might have one or two more inches and that should be it. i am in the exact same boat. i am 5' 7" about 7" taller than my mom and a 5 or 6" shorter than my dad.    your activity level or diet have little impact on your height unless we're talking extreme cases of malnutrition or inactivity, which i doubt is the case.
AA10287830	Pain like you are having is not normal.  I don't know how serious it is but any pain is a sign that something is not right with your body.

Coughing?  You can email me if you want to talk about it.  I really think you need to tell your parents and let them decide what to do but that's up to you.

vEGkSHMsaa	Jumpropes are like 10 bucks for a decent one. Great cardio. You should perhaps invest in a gym membership or at least heavier dumbbells.   Lifting burns tons of calories, and lifting weights while dieting will cause you to retain more muscle and lose more fat than just diet and/or cardio.  Because the name of the game when it comes to not looking awful is FAT LOSS, not weight loss.  Do you want to be that guy who loses lots of weight and still looks flabby and useless?  Of course not.    *edit* Your 17? Aren't you going to school? Go to the gym at your school/college. If your not going to school, why the hell don't you have a job lol. Get a job!
ESsGe0RHaa	Contacts aren't uncomfortable, for the most part. Sure, there's times when it might feel funny when you blink right after putting them in, but it's not bad.    Sometimes it takes me around 7 minutes to put in my contacts in the morning, but that's mainly because I'm tired and not really coordinated, haha...    I put my contacts in at the bottom of my eye and then push them up.    Taking them out is a ton easier, it's true...    For me, not having to wear glasses rules out any negatives about contacts.    Good luck!|`|dBoC8fR2aa	No, contact lens are comfortable and easy to put on, otherwise I won't be wearing them for more than 20 years. They are suppose to be comfortable, otherwise why do people opt for that, imagine if they aren't comfortable, how would a wearer last the whole day wear them? I know many people wonder about that, even a drop of water makes your eye very uncomfortable, but incredibly contact is so well-design and soft that you feel nothing when having them on.|`|GbfA7Rr8aa	Well they take different times for everyone depending on how you can try to put it in and yes they are comfortable u cant even tell there on haha i forget i have them on sometimes there great try them out :)|`|INY4UQ6Kaa	yes they are not really

VbFEvDL7aa	Well, if by anorexic you mean belemic AKA throwing up after each meal.... then I would suggest you don't do that because your stomach acid rots your teeth.    If you are on a starvation diet, I would say don't do it because your body goes through shock and actually starts storing every bit of fat it can when your on a starvation diet.    If you are on losing weight pills I would say consult a doctor because lots of those drugs increase the risk of heart attack and if your doctor considers you at risk already being a weight above what is recommended then you don't want to hurt your body like that!!!    However, if you are switching over to eating healthy and or exercising I would say: Your friend has no reason to be worried!!!    Comfort him by doing the right thing if you are not on a healthy diet, but if you are just tell him that you are doing something perfectly healthy (:
vhr6VXRkaa	It's good to lose weight if you are doing it in a healthy way.  Crash dieting to lose weight quickly is bad and a form of an eating disorder.  If you really want to lose weight you need to consult your doctor or a dietitian and set up a nutrition and exercise plan.  Obviously you are doing something that makes her worry.  I doubt she would be concerned if she saw you eating 1,400 calories a day consisting of lots of fresh fruits and veggies, lean proteins and whole grains paired with plenty of water and a daily hour of exercise.

vEGkSHMsaa	Weight loss is largely a matter of reducing calories and increasing activity.  So if 500 fewer calories a day than you need to maintain is good, 2000 less is better, right?  Not really.  Because below a certain threshold, your body thinks you are one of those starving refugees on TV, and does a bunch of things that hurt your long-term weight loss.    Read that again: starving is a bad way to lose weight.    -Your metabolism slows down.  Your body will burn fewer calories to maintain itself, and you will feel awful.  This is bad for weight loss because as soon as you quit starving yourself, youll gain weight fast because your metabolism has bottomed out.    -You will tend to lose muscle more than fat.  Your body will naturally try to conserve fat and cannibalize muscle if it thinks it is outright starving.  This is bad because your real goal is FAT loss, not weight loss.  This is how you have people who lose 100 pounds and reach their ideal weight, but still look amazingly flabby.  Also, losing muscle slows your metabolism down even further, amplifying the giant horrible rebound effect once you quit starving yourself.    -Your life will be a living hell.  Youll eventually feel horrible, the diet will fail, and youll binge eat and regain everything you lost, plus interest.    You want to run a clear-cut, but tolerable calorie deficit to sustain weight loss over the long term.  Very obese people may be put on very low calorie diets by their doctor, but these are medically supervised and designed for people who need to lose weight now or suffer severe health problems.|`|5b9d75acf8c31110fcdbe2289558b613aa	You are going to throw your body in starvation mode and it will start packing on pounds.

You must realize however that subjecting yourself to a liquid diet will be extremely unpleasant to say the least.You're going to go through intense intestinal and abdominal pain, as well as other serious vitamin deficiency problems. Also, if you stop eating all together and your metabolism gets used to not having a certain calorie intake per day, and you eventually start eating again, you're going to gain all that weight back and then some. Honestly, try eating really small portions, rather than not eating at all and that should do the job, just as well and even better.|`|PeCm21meaa	people don't just not eat.  anorexics eat, just not much.  why people think they don't is beyond me...  when i was at my most anorexic state i ate 500 calories a day at most, that last about one month, maybe two.  without eating at all (fasting) you could last i believe 3 days before you would need hospitalization.  and that's at most.  you appearance and weight loss isn't worth putting yourself through that. nothing is.  it tears you up mentally and physically and really makes your life hell.  lose weight the healthy way through a slightly more restrictive diet and exercise.  see a doctor if you need help.  edit: even though i don't encourage you to do it, the people are wrong, you don't gain weight.  you lose lots of weight quickly, and you end up looking awful.|`|OKs2l9SDaa	if u dont eat food, ur body shuts down and ur metabolism just falls..and the next time u eat wat ever, its just going to turn that into fat.    u have to eat, but eat healthy, eat things under 100 calories like snacks..  and eat things with a low fat content...  trust me i do this and i have abs and strong..listen to me ok..good luck..    also if u want things to get faster, u should start having cardio like running or dancing and things u like.|`|UwiGwDGdaa	They can go for quite awhile, but not without excessive damage to the body.   A starvation diet is a slow road to a painful death. The moment you begin to eat after starvation, even if it's only 50 calories, your body will store it all as fat for use later when it's not eating. The body is a miraculous thing - if you starve it, your body will automatically go into preservation mode. You could end up GAINING weight through starvation - when the body preserves all of the calories you take in, even if it's a small number, they will immediately go to the fat cells.     Not only that, the pounds you lose first will come from muscle, organs, and your BRAIN. They are the most nutrient-dense storage items in your body, so it will eat those organs first because they provide more nutrients than your fat cells. That's why the calories go to fat cells after starvation - your organs are still intact and so is your brain, so it will eat and eat and eat those organs until just the bare minimum is left, then move to the fat cells.     GREAT things to look forward to if you starve yourself to lose weight:  1) Mood swings  2) Insomnia  3) Depression, anxiety, anger, paranoia, obsessive behaviors  4) Incontinence - this means you get to wear a diaper because your bladder and bowels will evacuate themselves without your consent   5) Low electrolytes, electrolyte imbalance  6) Cardiac failure (aka heart failure)  7) Death     No bad comments?! How can you expect anything positive when you're asking if it's okay to starve yourself?     Instead, look at why you want to starve yourself. Are you truly in need of weight loss? Did your doctor tell you to lose weight?     Or is it because you have low self-esteem?     Really truly ask yourself. The only one who can tell you if you need to lose weight is your doctor...not the media, friends, family, or UNQUALIFIED professionals.|`|jex1oIOjaa	putting your body in starvation will only make in take in more fats foods and water weight and you will gain all back if not more.       you can go 2 weeks. its a terrible idea|`|a66dbb5b3ea3ac07b4ed2c82e558e892aa	A person can go about 3 days without eating but if you don't drink water then 2 days, that's not good for you.

Muscle confusion, it has got to work especially if you are already small and only need to loose 20 to 30 pounds max!|`|36PrVK7Oaa	I think lunges are great for this, if u are already pretty strong you can do controlled ninety degee side leg lifts, but they have to be controlled and in slow motion and you have to stop at 45 degrees for three seconds before going to ninety degrees and hold at ninety for two seconds. remember to stand straight while doing them, keep your shoulder line horizontal and parallel to the ground. holding your arms out parallel to the ground can help with your form. keep ur tummy tight while doing them, also so there is no strain on the back

Back to the Doc I should think.|`|Tc23KWgzaa	You need to see a doctor, and not the ones you've been seeing.  Call them back, and ask for a referral to a specialist.

V4fEgYIQaa	I used to have a phobia of throwing up, too! I grew out of it, thank goodness. I was living my life in a constant fear of being sick, which ended up just *making* me sick! It's okay to not like throwing up- who does?? But don't live your life anticipating that it's always going to happen. Don't let it hold you back from anything! If it happens it happens, and there's nothing you can do about it, you can't think about it too much. If you're going to throw up, trust me, you will know. Usually what it is is just a general feeling of sickness in your stomach, a sudden feeling of disgust for food, maybe faintness or a headache. But if this happens what you can do is just lie down, fan yourself, and maybe get a glass of cold ginger ale to soothe your stomach. If you start to feel better then it's good to eat something light like saltines or chicken soup. That always helped me!|`|aracCoyEaa	well no is the basic answer, throwing up is usually one of your bodies defences, your body uses it to remove any bacteria or other dangerous substances that you may have consumed. so usually it follows ill health or some serious stomach aches. don't worry just because you have a stomach ache doesn't mean you are going to throw up, it has to be reasonably serious to cause you to throw up.    as to warnings, just before you throw up your mouth begins to water really bad, like so much that you almost have to spit all the saliva out, this is because the saliva lines your mouth and teeth to give them some protection from the stomach acid mixed in with your vomit. so if your mouth is watering really bad and you have a bad stomach ache then the chances are you are going to throw up.    But don't worry its not that bad, once you have thrown up just have some water , rinse your mouth out with it then spit it out, that should get rid of the foul vomit taste.|`|wBN8e6QLaa	WARNING: THIS WILL SOUND DISGUSTING  well sometimes you can feel it coming up your throat and usually there is an upset feeling in your stomach along with it.  also if you start burping you might be able to smell it-sorta disgusting doesn't happen all the time-or you might have to make yourself burp and it can help it|`|j0zDQQG2aa	1) You have a serious problem with this phobia, think about it, you have only been sick twice in your whole life.  You need serious psychological help.    I have been sick countless times.    2) When you spin round and round on a chair and you feel really horrible (nausea), that is what you feel like when your about to be sick.    CREED

Shave with baby oil next time also use cold water.|`|iXWXllhQaa	the skin down there is extremely sensitive, that's why you have razor burn. it's technically not supposed to be shaved off.    i don't know how to prevent it, but atleast you now know why you have it.    sorry , i couldn't answer|`|vOjSr0Yhaa	just use wax  it hurts but results are better|`|AA11433347	go to walmart and get stuff called bikini gel works wonders|`|TkPJYlaMaa	What can you do. Just use some soothing lotion|`|3EQsrBxCaa	use aloe vera - it speeds the healing process and soothes in the mean time.    As for next time - take a hot bath before shaving.  The time spent in the bath will open the pores and allow you to shave only the hair and not the skin.|`|6qsocyK3aa	Nothing can stop it really. Just put some cream on afterwards. Use something like E45 cream that is supposed to calm irritated skin.|`|VbCs0vGjaa	I read its best to exfoliate before hand, and leave the shaving gel on for a few minutes, to soften hairs.   Or theres Bikini-Zone.|`|QK4r41Hqaa	The only thing I can think of is using really short strokes.   And make sure to put lotion on after, I had a problem wiht ichyness because of my dry skin.
X8gIe9Tqaa	have you noticed any lumps in the breast of discharge from the nipple. if so i would consult your doctor.     sometimes one nipple may become more sensative than the other so that could also be the reason. also pregnancy but if ya sure you not preg that npothing to worry about.    i dont think it is owt to worry bout unless you notice any changes in your breast or you get aching or pain    hope this helps    xxx|`|mOLRYES3aa	If it was both I would say you could be pregnant, but if it's just one, I dunno I would see a doctor. Could be nothing though if it's just hard. Mine get a little hard too. Not trying to be too personal but it happens.|`|76QS2eYhaa	It is just hormons flowing through you body you could be growing but most likely its just hormones  some times the levels of them in your body change just depending on some things you have done recently so it is normal and will return to normal but if you nipple begins to hurt contact your doctor.
RGvNRH8Iaa	You can use wax or maybe Nair--if you try Nair, test it on a small area of your skin first to be sure it doesnt irritate your skin (I personally cant use it cause my skin is too sensitive).      honestly, those are some unusual places for a girl to have hair; you may want to see a doctor just to be sure it is not caused by some kind of hormone imbalance.|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	wax it|`|3PEQAUT9aa	Some girls bleach them so they don't show as bad. Sometimes shave it. Every girl has that problem. But my hair is light so it's not noticeable.    Sorry.|`|D58bzW4Jaa	I have that under my belly button...I just have to shave it every few days.|`|7n4rtfp6aa	I remember, I used to have so much hair on my hands- not too hairy,but enough to make me self conscious. So, I started shaving it and it grew even more darker, until I just learned to accept myself the way I am.  Do not shave the hair- it will grow darker and more thick, and I don't suppose You'd want that:)  Ideally, I would advice you to just focus on your other body bits that are attractive to you and in time you'll stop being so self conscious!  Or..just wax it :) But trust me, I think it's all in your head :)|`|2wrEoTYgaa	HOLY **** I HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM!!!!  I shave it but omfg it has like its stubble... its sooo embarassing.|`|6qsocyK3aa	You can either wax, shave, dye, use cream on it or have lazer treatment. All have their their good points and bad points so just do your research. :)|`|a12cbnR4aa	Waxing the hair will only make it darker. have you tried tanning? that way maybe the hair will blend more with your skin.|`|1LhZgZllaa	you could bleach it with bleaching cream, then the hairs will be whita.  eventually it fades but its less painfull than waxing|`|dALX1qQdaa	get waxed.|`|BOQxPnjCaa	try finding a wax place  there gunna charge alot  but get every thing waxed [=  lmao im south asian soo i sooo kno how yuh feel  were all brown black haird monkies xD|`|5J0sIvksaa	You could trim or wax the hair if it makes you self- concious. But if you wax your back, then wax the other places. You could also get laser hair removal. I hear it's painless. Good Luck!|`|Qr7EiDo8aa	I shave mine, its easier than that bleach cream. ugh that stuff takes forever to work! if you tan alot it will make it less noticable because it turns the hair blondish and makes it blend in with your skin tone. but dont be embarrassed we all go through strange things, believe me I have a friend who has a huge strip of hair from her breast all the way down to her womanly region and its bright orangish because she is a carrot top that is to be embarresed about not what you have!|`|9cYqY6vWaa	Everyone has body hairs, some to more degrees than other. Speaking from experience, don't remove it, shave it, wax it, whatever. Just leave it.     I have a little hair under and around my belly button and since I was going to get my belly button pierced I was self conscious about it. It wasn't bad at all but I decided to use hair removing cream to remove the hair. It looked awkward and it DOES grow back darker and thicker. Trust me, the hair DOES grow back worse.     You have to understand that everyone has this and nobody is going to be staring at your back, looking close enough to see it.     It you are still very self conscious I suggest maybe using a hair highlighting kit or even some Sun-In (a hair lightening product) or something of that nature and lightening the color of your hair, but not removing it.|`|h97v9PHjaa	hair removal cream?|`|AA10420187	You should shave and wax it.|`|mOLRYES3aa	It's just pubic hair don't worry about it. I have it too. A LOT of girls have it.

Once you shave it you'll have to keep shaving it because the hairs will be all messed up. You could try a wax or nair lotion thing.|`|YwaZMnnGaa	personally i love hairy girls, nothing like pubic hair in your throat in the morning.|`|MOqLx1FRaa	i had that to and i hated it so much 2 words creame bleach|`|DR4LYQBtaa	First, it's not really embarassing, you are immature and childish if you think it is. Everyone has hair, all over, some more than others but still.  Second, if it's that big of deal to you, get it waxed, go someplace and get a full body wax, or get it bleached. You could also shave it or have someone else shave it.    Good luck growing up and learning to deal with things!|`|zN8mKq66aa	I'm sure its not as obvious as you think!  Try shaving, waxing, bleaching, hair removal cream or what ever works for you.  I suggest trying a couple of different things. See what works and whats comfortable for you.  If your worried go to your doc but im pretty sure its nothing to worry about loads of girls have this.    Take care!  x|`|CUheLLwFaa	well first of all you need to tell your parents and then ask your mom about shaving so GO 4 IT
AA11176387	hi    I had 4 severely herniated disks in my back from over 20 car wrecks including being run over by a car.    The way my chiropractor explained it to me was that once someone is injured often they can get so well but each time just a little below normal due to being injured.  I went from being in a wheelchair a lot for a year to 15 months to being able to walk again but it still years later hurts me a lot to stand and harder though I can work up to about 45 minutes is kind of hard too.      I will never be the same but I am so much better,  A neurologist told me my back was severely herniated when the car ran over me and that I needed immediate surgery.  I refused saying I would try conservative treatment with my chiropractor (cause I knew he fixed 3 previous herniations and that a government studies showed chiropractic to be the best treatment for back pain followed by exercise.    They were going to do one on neck injuries where chiropractic also excels but the AMA got it cancelled as they fared so badly in the first study)..the neurologist got angry when I refused surgery and yelled down the hall after me when I left.he yelled "you'll be back.  I guarantee it..you will not be able to stand the pain"    Well, needless to say, I never went back.  Chiropractors are wonderful..even when better though it is suggested you have occasion visits after recovered.  Therefore, I would suggest that you try another chiropractor where you are.    I could never replace my wonderful chiropractor but if I did not have access and needed one, I would go to another one..just be sure they are trained with the palmer method. Who knows he might even have additional advise to offer.  Some use supplements too.    Here are a few other suggestions besides getting in to see a chiropractor for a while.    take hot and cold showers on the area massaging as you do then..here is how to do them            Hot and Cold Showers: (the most effective way to move the blood and create circulation ) Once daily, you must do a complete hot and cold shower. You will start with hot water for 1 minute, then cold for 1 minute. Re-peat this 7 times so the shower should last about 15 minutes. Another time, daily, you can do a complete hot and cold shower routine again or a partial one just applying the water directly to the affected area. Make sure while you are doing both hot and cold showers that you pay special attention to the affected area and massage it vigorously. If the shower is impossible then use Hot packs and Ice packs. 8-1    also try an ointment    this is a good one but not as great as he suggests IMO    http://curezone.com/schulze/handbook/dto... you buy it at herbdoc.com    or try as*kisser (also called a*s kicker) by little moon http://www.amazon.com/s.html?ie=UTF8&nod... or tiger balm or something similar at the health food store    little moon  also has some soaks on the same page with the body damage cream (scroll down for the cream)    also massage    I also had a torn cartilage in my knee which they said would hurt all my life without arthroscopic surgery which I refused and I went on Dr Richard Schulze's incurables program (from the save your life videos) for cancer and it fixed my knee  (he is the same guy who sells the deep tissue repair oil)     I have the links to the free videos and manuals on how to do the program..email me if you want it.    so in conclusion    1 see a chiropractor    2 do hot and cold showers on the area while massaging it    3 use a herbal cream on it like a*sskisser or deep tissue repair oil    4 massage    5 continue your exercises    6 optional hot soaks with little moon    7 if all else fails do the incurables program    you might try some things like bone, flesh and cartilage formula    see these links for more help from the master healer who trained schulze    if making any of his formulas or using herbs, be sure they are organic or wildcrafted and take them in the form of a tincture not capsule (teas would be 2nd best)    http://www.herballegacy.com/ThesisExperi...    http://www.herballegacy.com/Purcell_Expe...    http://www.herballegacy.com/Arthritis.ht...    http://www.herballegacy.com/Hoover_Exper...    http://www.herballegacy.com/Sprains.html    http://www.herballegacy.com/Complete_Tis...    http://www.herballegacy.com/Nerves.html|`|H0aiDO9Paa	See your health care provider as soon as possible. Conservative treatment, including physical therapy and anti-inflammatory drugs, is often successful in relieving pain from a herniated, or "slipped," disk. Unless the pain or numbness is severe or nerve function is impaired to the point of weakness of your leg muscles, you should try those alternative for two to three months before resorting to more invasive techniques such as local cortisone injections or surgery. And good luck.|`|91b27b540655ebe4e66c72274b49dd33aa	need the surgery to fix|`|UZxeBrxQaa	Spinal surgery is a last ditch effort to alleviate unbearable pain.    More than one patient has ended up in worse pain after surgery than before.  This must be a decision weighed carefully against the risks.    A chiro might be able to help manage chronic pain, but you may need nothing more than a muscle relaxant and pain killer from your physician.    Stay away from surgery.  Its not a guaranteed answer for this type of disorder.|`|4MtR8MLpaa	I had back "problems" for years. The surgeon found out one disk was gone, one disk was herniated and one vertebrae was broken and shifted out of place. They did the whole thing on me, physical therapy, shots in the back and  finally surgery fixed it, thank god! I was in pain for years and my back hasn't hurt for years now.    If therapy can alleviate the pain then do that. If you cannot get to your therapist regularly then ask for a plan that you can take with you and do at home. It may not be as good but it should help and maybe enough to stretch out the time between treatments. I know your pain I wish you well. It can be fixed. Good luck.|`|5843355184faeff731f1a94bbecb55e4aa	While physical therapy may have been ineffective for you initially, there is a book by a physiotherapist which you may find helpful that may make you more aware of what you are encountering in your normal daily activities that is hindering your progress.  The vast majority of these problems should be resolved within a couple weeks to a couple months...two years...especially in someone so young...is potentially encountering a barrier.    This book is a good suggestion for understanding what happens when you have a herniated disc and what you can do to understand, correct and prevent the pain.    Recurrent pain with a herniated disc is very common...but those who learn what to do to fix it themselves (which the vast majority of people can...without a chiropractor) are much more satisfied and obtain a higher level of funciton.    Check out: "Treat you own back" by Robin McKenzie...paperback available at most major bookstores.     Also, know that there are some stretches that should be done daily...if not several times a day...a concept covered in the book.     Also go to www.mckenziemdt.org
oLsMOmp8aa	That sounds good enough. Just make sure your consuming the "good" calories though, such as vegetables, fruit, grilled chicken, ect. I wouldn't worry about the fruit. I never count calories in raw fruits and vegetables, as long as they aren't covered in sugar or something. It will probably take a couple months at the least, but do not give up. I promise you'll see results in the first couple of weeks.|`|puQEeOUIaa	At that rate, it would take you about 5or6 weeks to lose about 20lbs|`|fcaasfx0aa	Personally, I consider fruits to be free. You can never eat too many fruits or vegetables. The more you eat, the better you will feel.    And your diet depends on where your calories are coming from. 1200 is pretty low, but with careful planning, you can get all the nutrients you need. It sounds like you have the right idea. Good luck!
p0WEjAwdaa	im having a similer problem with not being able to lose much weight, it sucks doesnt it?    some healthy and delicious foods are pasta with tomato sause on it  or rice with stirfryed vegitables.  also, fish is healthyer than meat    a really tastey desert is fruit in low fat/ natural yoghurt with little bits of cookie or shorbread biscuit crumbled into it.    also try eating whole grain bread as this will fill you up better than white bread    it will help you to eat more fruit and vegitables if you buy plenty of it and have it out in a fruit bowl or something. and buy as few unhealthy foods as possible, because this reduces the temptation.    something that iv found helpfull is stop eating so much, is to structure your eating habbits and make a meal planner.|`|Zyfm8vnnaa	you can clean around the house ;|`|AA12275351	drink lots of water. seriously. like drink only water. and have tea thats really good for you. but im a lil over weight and i started drinking like water all the time like 2-3 bottles a day or 4-5 glasses a day. and like in the first month i started drinking only water i lost almost 7 pounds. its been almost 2 months now and i lost a lil more than 10 pounds. and as for food. the reason you might not get full as easy is because when u eat a lot more than other(resulting in being over weight) your stomach becomes stretched out so u need more food to fill it up. if you feel like snacking. have a bowl of salad. try to stay away from junk food(cookies, chips, soda, crackers, etc.) as good as it is. its really bad for u. the worst thing you could have is soda. that has so many calories and its one of the main causes of gaining weight. have smaller meals less often. and even if you dont feel full. tough it out. and eventually you wont feel hungry even after you eat a small meal. when ever you get a chance or have free time. take a walk. walking is extremely good for you. once you get into shape and you loose the weight. do pushups and crunches around the house for defenition.|`|FfeEStStaa	weight watchers. lets you eat real food and loose weight|`|7dHJPtr1aa	Do Weight Watchers!!!!|`|5DkAMti9aa	Exercising is important. If you don't have time, just start out with simple lifestyle changes like taking the stairs, walking to the store. park your car further.     I think the most effective way is to change your eating habits if you do not have time to work out at all. Eat meals at consistent times. Get enough rest. Give up the bag of chips (yes, it's tough). There are other healthy snacks that are just as tasty. Be sure you get your nutrients in.  Try cutting your meal sizes by 30%. That would be 30% less you'd be eating a week! If you must eat more, then substitute fries with a salad. But be careful not to drench your salad with dressing. That defeats the purpose. I don't believe in starving yourself. You'd just give in eventually. Just aim for a healthier meal to start with.|`|xdM1N6Wjaa	Yoga and pilates should help. I need to lose weight too. Do sit ups/push ups/ yoga and exercise tapes, and eat healthy (smoothies, soups, meat, whole grain bread but limited, and cheeses, yogurts, etc.) If you want to lose weight FAST do the 20 carb diet. (20 carbs a day) I lost 20 pounds in 1 month from that.|`|U8R2o1P3aa	Run some laps around your house, dorm, campus, or town. Do some occasional, not too overworking, exercises.  Since you said you don't have much time for that, eat mini meals. Like instead of 3 full meals (and a couple snacks) a day, eat like 6 mini meals consisting of an array of balanced food groups. Like eat some buttered toast and fruit for one. Then eat some chicken ceasar salad, so you get your protein and green veggies. Have some milk and cheeses. But you should always have SOME sort of physical exersion in there.  Good luck!|`|LPEWAoWCaa	Try weight watchers, it works great and is fairly easy|`|CIZX6PyQaa	Well I can only be honest with you... dieting will only get you so far.

Dieting doesn't get you very far.|`|hucsWXhgaa	yes eat less portions and more healthy and work out that simple|`|SNC58uQvaa	There is a book called Lean Bodies by Cliff Sheets. The author  was very over weight and unhealthy before his diet. The book actually has a menu for you to follow. He gives you protein sources and complex carbohydrates. The theory behind his diet is to raise your metabolism.You can have water mellon, straw berries,cantaloupe, and honey dew melons.    The book tells you what you can safely order in fast food restaurants  as well. Unless a diet is sound and healthy, it will not work.      Everyone that I have ever talked to that stayed on the diet lost weight and felt better.    I am sure that you are already beautiful so the mind set you want to get in is that losing weight will make you healthier and it will raise your energy level.

Exercising is the fastest way to lose weight. Try to run at least a mile a day and eat what is above, and you will lose weight fast. No fast food!! Make it yourself.|`|ad6YgqZlaa	making substitutions in your diet is a good way to start e.g. instead of having a chocolate bar as a snack have an apple? save about 200 kcals!    make changes in your daily routine, maybe walk to work or wherever?     make a meal plan so that you know what you're eating and try and stick to it    set yourself goals e.g. loose 1 pound a week. maybe buy a goal outfit like a really nice dress that's in the size you aim to be which will motivate you to keep trying!  good lucky|`|ga58xm4naa	stay out of the kitchen! seriously, whenever I go to my kitchen its like heaven and it gets out of control cause I just sit there and watch tv; eating. weight watchers works SO good for me because all you do is write down what you eat, but you can still eat whatever you want. you just have to order that little chart thing to add up your points. even if you go over your points, at least you realize how much your eating. trust me it helped. and do stuff on your own like walking outside and fun stuff like boxing, HOT YOGA, and weird things like that...keep yourself busy it will help!
woOeYFrEaa	Just relax as much as you can.  If you're nervous, then you're even tighter down there.  Make sure you tell them that you're a virgin and they'll use a smaller speculum than normal on you.  I wouldn't say the exam hurts, just that its kind of uncomfortable and I've had several of them as a virgin.    The pap smear just checks your cervical tissue for abnormalities.  They always follow that up with a pelvic exam where they insert a finger or two and basically feel around with the fingers inside you and pushing on your belly with their other hand.  That part of the exam can detect uterine fibroids, ovarian cysts, etc.    The key is to relax, take very deep breaths and try to distract yourself.|`|a12cbnR4aa	Don't worry your doctor should walk you through everything. If you have any questions be sure to ask. Good for you in taking the right steps in protecting yourself and taking care of yourself.

fcaasfx0aa	Yes, it's okay to eat junk food once in a while when trying to lose weight. Usually, it's best to choose a single day of the week, say Saturday, and on that day eat whatever you want. And I mean whatever you want. Every other day, restrain yourself and think of your free day coming up...    And no, walking to Mcdonalds doesn't really make much of a difference. I'm sorry to say it, but 2/3 really isn't that far--that's hardly over a mile there and back. Better than nothing, but you can do more.    Unless you're eating a salad.The salads at mickey d's are actually pretty good...but everything else is pretty calorie-laden. Not a good way to lose weight, or to live a healthy lifestyle.|`|tgh0yJp4aa	you will not lose weight if you continue to eat mcdonalds. no it will not cancel out the fat in your heart and body. if you are really trying to lose weight dont eat junk food and cmon you can do more than 3 mins|`|FaVYRoXqaa	Will this counteract the McDonalds? No.    Did you eat that badly while there? Not really.  Could've had a single cheeseburger.    Is it okay to have junk food?  Well it doesn't hurt every once and a while (like less than once a week), it's not exactly a good thing to do if you want to form healthy eating habits.    Build up your cardio stamina by practicing.|`|KDUwFiBPaa	No you will not work off the calories you will consume if you walk to McDonald's.  A double-cheeseburger, fries, and soda will still run you about 600 calories at least.  Walking there will probably less than a hundred.  Even if you sprinted there you wouldn't burn enough calories to consume it.  Plus the sodium and fat calories are something to be concerned about too.  If you really want McD's then just get a hamburger, no fries or soda.  It is okay to have junk food once in a while, they're called cheat days but you just can't over do it on that day.  To build up stamina you have to just keep on running, pushing yourself harder each time.  Every time you think you can't do it any longer, push yourself 5 more minutes or another mile.  Doing crunches will help build up your core but you aren't necessarily going to lose weight by doing them.  It's all about cardio, a strict diet, and will power.|`|AA11658197	I would say yes.   Exercise is good, food is good, enjoy your meal and the fresh air.    Wait a minute I just noticed Diet coke - get the regular coke because they are healthier. I don't know any skinny people that drink Diet Coke.|`|IM3QwSS2aa	NOT! the additives in the food is addicting and walking, running off the calories may work but that stuff they put in it to make you come back is NOT good for ya.    Check out from your local library the dvd: SuperSize Me.  After watching that hope you Empathize and Sympathize with that brutha.    /Jerome|`|RXI8ImdIaa	Eating fast food once in a while should not be a problem, as long as it's not a huge amount of food. The meal that you mentioned is a reasonable size. It will be better if you get it without cheese, or with one slice instead of two.     Walking to and from McDonalds is better than driving but it does not cancel out the food that you are eating there. I would limit this to less than once a week, if I was trying to lose weight.    Or even better, walk to McDonalds and get low-fat stuff instead of burger and fries ;)|`|TuOp3hNPaa	first dont walk to mcdonalds. JOG to mcdonalds. as fast of a jog as u can.  walking hardely does anything.  then thats good for the crunches jus make sure ur not jus bending ur head up an down. make sure ur back is straight an ur lower back comes off the ground.  they will help but do them everyother day, not every day, ur body needs a day to rebuild an get stronger.    -swt song btw|`|AA12298409	It is ok to have junk food once in a while. If you say you can't have it you will want it more then binge. If you go to Mc Donald's the walk is great but try getting a fruit and yogurt parfait for a healthier snack. Anything you do to lose weight is great but the object is to burn off more calories than you take in. To build up your running stamina each day you walk up your speed a little and in no time you will be running. Keep up the good work.|`|8722a385a740fd3c165b65c08ed568ffaa	yes, some junk food is okay; but it seems like it would be a lot easier just to not go to mickie d's in the firt place|`|oyB861Swaa	Wow you're doing really well!  I wouldn't have so much junk food though. You're right it's good to have portions. Have more fruit and a little chocolate maybe. Like for ever 6 strawberries have a bite of chocolate!!|`|nBnAFkisaa	your dumb, u don't eat brownies and cupcakes when your trying to lose weight, make a freaking sandwich, an apple, then some water, don't walk to mcdonalds, walk to subway, and don't be a fatty
n7KCez59aa	Hi !    I know first hand how difficult it can be to loose a large amount of weight.   I suggest simply changing your eating. When a person is trying to loose weight, and they have to loose more than 100 pounds, just changing what you eat will help you drop roughly 80 pounds in 8 months.   The best way to loose weight is by eating a variety of foods; lean meats, vegetables, fruits, unsalted nuts and fiber. This includes salads, fruit and/or vegetable smoothies, whole wheat bread and water.   Exercising, starting out, I would suggest walking for 30 minutes a day. Then, after the weight loss of about 80 pounds, you will have more energy to venture out into longer exercises.   Eating healthy meals for 5 days of the week and leaving 2 days to eat junk food will help wean you off of the addiction to junk food. Doing this for 2 weeks, you will notice the cravings are less and less.     I hope this helped.|`|hpadhXUiaa	First check out what is your blood group and what diet is good for your health .

KDUwFiBPaa	veggies, fruits, lean protein like fish and chicken breast|`|WgIZUcYfaa	Your favorite fruits and veggies. If you don't like it, don't buy it, cause if you wont eat it what's the point? Your favorite salad dressing (again, if you don't like something there is no point in buying it). Also some oatmeal and cereal for the mornings, fat free milk, tea, high fiber breads, multivitamins, crystal light, lean chicken, ground turkey...try to keep to the outside of the store as that is where the most healthful things are kept. Keep an eye on the nutrition labels. If you aren't much of a cook there are frozen meals called lean cuisines that you may like. They are expensive but they are good for portion control and they give you everything you need in a meal. Hope I helped. Good luck!

SO7zRZK9aa	It does mean losing your virginity. You were right. It's literally referring to the breaking of the hymen, the small piece of skin over the vaginal opening although, in active girls, this is very often broken long before they lose their virginity.|`|PCpC4iS1aa	it means that you lost your virginity or some wants to burst you when doing you meaning pop your cherry|`|VXwT93TBaa	it means that you had sex with someone for the first time|`|iKREKLGpaa	losing your virginity|`|EQDyE8Rpaa	the cherry is a slang term for the layer of skin in the vagina that is broken thru when a woman is losing her virginty when it is broken thru it is "popped" dont worry its not a stupid question everyone wonders|`|b5UV15gCaa	the only way I have ever heard it used was the same as the way you thought it meant.|`|HLMzKR53aa	well it does mean loosing virginity but in some cases people can "pop there cherries" from physical acvtivity such as sports. they just probably would not use that term in that case.|`|mfbxyfEbaa	it dosent nesicerally mean that she has lost her virginity that isnt lost until the penis enters the vagina. having your hymen broken or "popping your cherry" simply means just that it meens that your hymen broken. this can happen during sex but for some people it pops while using a tampon or during sports.|`|7p0TO6ePaa	um the propper word for it is the hymen "popping the cherry" is just like slang. but its a piece of skin around the vagina that bursts and bleeds a tiny bit if you have sex or are fingered or it sometimes pops when horseback riding.

It is when a girls hymen is broken..  Hymen is a covering of skin inside a womans body that when penetrated with the penis, rips and it bleeds.|`|af43e8f6af5feac294cdbceeba67f982aa	Okay if someone says "I popped her cherry"  it means that they did have sex.  There is a layer of skin called the hymes (spelt wrong), whenever something enters the body and breaks the skin, a little blood comes out.  This can happen when a women has sex for the first time, when a tampon is used (it happens) or if the girl is activies like horse riding or dancing could break.    Having the cherry popped in your story means they lost their virginity.|`|InsYyclPaa	it is losing your virginity but more specifically its when a girls hymen breaks causing bleeding hence the "cherry"    it is possible that the hymen gets broken in another way besides intercourse including tampon use, intense exercise, etc.|`|0TQKFdBpaa	okay that is just slang for when a girl has sex and her Himond gets torn and that is a little piece of like skin or what ever and it is in the vagina! but yeaa... if someone says "he popped my cherry"  it means he took her virginity! and if you don't have sex for at least 7 months the skin heals and you can "pop your cherry again"  but your virginity is something you give away the first time you can never get it back!    -Cheyenne-|`|478a3b599d9af6e44518e2133d9ee442aa	It is what it is.

AA12266052	Nasal polyps are fleshy outgrowths of the nasal mucosa that form at the site of dependent edema in the lamina propria of the mucous membrane, usually around the ostia of the maxillary sinuses.  Treatment may include medication, such as steroids or antibiotics. Some people may need surgery, such as functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS).|`|kFlMHSKIaa	My husband's had nasal polyps removed 3 times.

MRDJu8v3aa	I am sorry that you want to become asexual. Not that the choice is not yours to make but it does not sound like that is your true sexual identity.     My guess is that your sexual experience has not been good for the last few months. I can totally understand your mind being turned off to sex while your body still feels that hormone driven urge.     I know that priests make pledges to not have sex but I do not know how they can do that. I have heard that exercising can burn off some of the urge.     I am in the opposite situation wanting sex but not having a partner hehehe.|`|xXa3eQOeaa	It is frustrating, knowing how OUR "instinctive/natural impulses" can wage war against US.  While the desire to "have sex" is natural, IF you are not "in love" AND not committed in your heart, you should continue to resist, as it would send "mixed signals". YOU are in charge of YOU, not your hormones.  Successfully maintaining your resolve is a sign of maturity, and responsibility. Too many young adults are so foolishly irresponsible with their sexuality, thus we have a ridicules amount of unwanted children. THAT results(not in ALL cases) in high numbers of young mothers on welfare & other financial assistance programs, child neglect, or abuse, AND ultimately, those children have no idea "how to parent" because their parent(s) didn't know "how to parent"! It's a very BAD "snowball effect".  Stop the erosion of our society by maintaining YOUR "self-control".

They get lots of mail from teenagers who think they have discovered the cure for cancer.|`|ce83aaa18b48dd89e8f2ce5b7f9d7885aa	The only way to know you have a cure for cancer is to do a trial. This involves, in part, giving the treatment to a group of cancer patients while giving a placebo to another group. None of the patients know whether they are getting the real thing or not. This is called a double blind study. Then you check the results. If the treatment works, then you have a potential cure. You should contact your nearest cancer center. Something tells me that you don't have a cure.|`|69SHxWA9aa	You talk to people until you are blue in the face, while they give you a blank stare that says they either think that you are lying, or you are not informed properly, because the cure for cancer seems to difficult - according to all the Medical Doctors.    Unfortunately, it is not that difficult at all, it is the Pharmacy that does not want it cured, and the educators that receive grant money from the Pharmacies that pay for the medical schools, so you are stuck with medicine to cure Cancer, not finding the real problem    That director of research at UCLA knows they are going to get several grants from a Pharmacy, and that if they "Discover" a cure to cancer, then those grants will go away.  So they keep "Searching" for the cure.    Wade Lightheart found a cure for his cancer, and lack of ability to think.  Do a search for his book on Amazon.com.

QjoWA99Yaa	No, you're not too young. I started about that age too.  First things first you need to relax by taking a bath, putting some music on, getting him to give him a massage, whatever does it for you.  Then you need to stop thinking of orgasm as your aim. Sex/foreplay isn't about that. If you orgasm you orgasm but just enjoy the feeling for what it is rather than the actual climax.  Also I would lay off masturbating yourself for a while. Sounds like you have go too used to your own touch. If you leave it for a while then your boddy will be so gagging for it it, any touch will get you there.  Good luck!|`|aIwGPbgVaa	i masturbated when i was 5, but my mum told me it was bad so i stopped.

It might just be a bit too soon for you two.|`|8G8ZbNLQaa	I think that maybe you're not close enough to him to be having a sexual relationship.

Dont impose it just say, hey listen can we try it this way?  Just once.  Then, he will notice you might enjoy it more.  By the way, one of the reasons is maybe your not relaxed enough.
KOcwI41Iaa	When you have your adenoids out, you will go home that day.  Yes, it will hurt.  Your doc will give you a pain medication to help with the pain.  One other thing to help reduce pain is to keep on sipping fluids.  The best way to avoid pain pain after a tonsillectomy is to make sure your throat is kept moist; the same is true for adenoids.  You will have very sore throat.  Eat a lot of Popsicles, and drink cool fluids; they help make you more comfortable.  The worst part is what you are going through now; you are very afraid of the unknown.  You will probably miss several days from school, until the doctor gives you permission to go back to school.  Taking pain medication and going to school don't mix well.  The last two questions are actually the same one.  All surgery patients have IV's, to give all the medication for drifting off to sleep, giving you other medications during surgery, giving you pain medications after surgery.  So, you will have to have an IV put in, and once that's over, there should be no more needles.  The anesthesia team will probably give you a little something to help you calm down, and then get you into the OR, where you'll get on a bed.  At that point, you will get hooked up to a variety of monitors which will be watched closely the entire time you are in the OR.  Once all that is done, you'll start to get induction agents(fancy name for putting you to sleep).  Once you are asleep, a tube will be put into your throat to make sure that you are breathing well throughout the surgery.  At the end of the surgery, as you start to wake up, the tube comes out before you are awake.  The monitors will be removed and out to the PACU you go.  PACU is where you really wake up, and the nurses there monitor your vital signs(heart, breathing, awareness), and to make sure that you get the pain control you need.    One note about your fear of needles; usually, sometime before surgery, the doc will order a blood test.  That will be a lab stick.  :et me give you a couple of hints to help you through that.  First, tell the person doing the lab draw that you are afraid of needles(same thing with the IV start).  You will be told everything before it happens.    Most important things to do are to relax your arm as much as you can and to take slow deep breathes in through your nose and let them go out of your mouth.  Concentrate on your breathing, rather than on what is going in around your arm.  Hold your parent's hand and breathe.  Don't look at your arm, either.  The more you can relax yourself, especially your arm, the easier it will be.    If you have any questions that I can help you with, please contact me.|`|qSMF6QIYaa	I got them out along with my tonsils when i was 6.  since i was so young and also had my tonsils i cant say much but.  They put me to sleep with that laughfin gas stuff. its fun, you'll feel floaty (i saw animals flying on the walls, lol). I left the hospitol the same day, and i belive only was out of school for a week (note;; my tonsils)  i dont think the adnoids will change much,  But you usally always skip the next day of school after surgery.    The worst part is having to deal with people in blue scrubs.    I dont remember anything bad besides my throat being sore from the tonsils. And I mean, it hurt badddd, not to scare you but to warn you that it wont be fun. i rmeebr my moms car being full of tissues cause i couldnt even swallow my spit on the ride home.  but afterwards i hardly got a soar throught. And you have less a chance of bad breath cause thats what 'hallotosis'? Grows on.    Less organs=less stuff for bacteria to grow on.      And you'll wiegh less =)
WXpdkbG8aa	You just try everything and anything. Wear something super sexy and suprising that will turn your man on. Read Cosmo and The Lover's Play Book. They have AWESOME sex tips to keep the fire burning! ;) GOod luck!|`|K4zsztkRaa	I have this same problem with my partner.   The sex is still good but it isn't as great as it used to be, it gets predictable and boring.    One thing I reccomend is sitting down and talking about your deepest darkest fantasys. Talk to eachother about maybe something you have always wanted to try but never have.  Sex toys are a great thing to try, especially if you are weary about them.(they always change your mind) They are something fun you can use on eachother and just have fun with.  Also what I hear is off the charts, go to the drugstore and get the KY Yours and Mine. I hear that stuff makes sex amazing, and it gives everything a new feeling and it's fun.  Also try having sex in a different place, maybe a public one? That's always a fun idea.  Try a new place and a new position, you can try ribbed condoms, go online and find new ways of doing things. Basically just have fun.    Also what always works oddly with my partner and I is we just don't have sex for a while. Maybe like a week? and then once we do it again we wondered why we waited a week lol.    -Connor|`|OBFyz3z8aa	Try the pretzel position.|`|AUx0rVHSaa	well if you and your partner are "bored" with sex take some time off and almost tease each other with dirty photos or text messages and just wait a week or so and just get the tension built up until your about to burst and then finally give into temptation and just let him ravish you|`|g2R7e2eVaa	Next time you are in the 69, jam your finger in his butt. JK    Try public places or buy a porno and copy what they do in the movie.|`|KCiRI9K7aa	Talk about your sexual fantasy with each other, try acting out some of them out to spice things up. Also you can go to the book store and look at some of the erotic section. You may want to try going for twice as much time as usual with out having sex, so if you guys make love on Sundays then wait an extra week,  it can build excitement.  Blindfolds can make the experience more interesting.
LPEWAoWCaa	You lose an average of 2lbs a week on weight watchers, and it's pretty easy|`|AA12298409	I lost ten pounds in a month and it was hard to do. I cut down my intake significantly. And exercised more. I would eat one boiled egg or bran cereal with skim milk for breakfast. A grilled chicken,fish or turkey breast for lunch with veggies on the side. And salad for dinner. I did pilates or yoga once a week and stepper machine every day along with fifteen to thirty minutes of cardio. I got tired of the same stuff everyday then went about learning more healthy foods and snacks. There are tons out there.  I like this one.  http://www.foodfit.com/cooking/menuWeek....|`|riRSmlqdaa	Eat 5 small meal such as small breakfast (a cup of coffee or tea with 1 toast) at 7 am--Eat a small meal at 10 am (biscuit 2 or 3 slices)--Eat a amall meal of lunch with vegetables at 1.00 pm( up to you, but without oil is much better)-- eate a snack at 4 pm(a cookie with a glass of juice)---and eat a small meal dinner such as egg with vegetables at 7 pm-- at go for jogging at 10pm till 10:30 you have to sweat.  Try it it really works.
7aqysN5saa	well, that is still blood, you need to get a pad on! That will the prevent the blood from leaking.   And tell your mom :]|`|MhpccWpmaa	just blood from your vagina
aoCEGXvuaa	Allright, first you have to walk briskly and combine that with a little jogging and work your way up. A typical day would be to walk for 10 minutes, jog for 3 minutes(slow) and then as you feel more comfortable and get more fit and you'll find that you can jog a little longer. Make sure the calories your taking in are normal, but cut back only a little bit because think about it if you work out and burn off 400 calories then you'll need enough food to replace those lost calories. Most people say to lay off all bad foods but if you personally cannot do that(like me) then I would recommend rewarding yourself at the end of the week with a little something. And plus you'll be more motivated to burn off more of  those calories!    I realize you said jogging is difficult but just like anything else you've just gotta work at it and do it about 30 minutes for a few days out of the week.    Best of luck|`|AA11557192	I know I had not been running for many years and then I decided to start this summer.  There is short 1/2 mile loop across from house.  I started walking and then would jog a little bit - just across driveways.  Then I tried jogging from driveway to driveway.     After a couple of months I finally worked up to jogging around the loop!  I was working on two times around and then it got cold and snowed :(    So start small, mix jogging and walking and keep adding a little bit everyday!|`|xJgILr5faa	Run for as long as you can maybe go to a track or where ever don't stop until you can figure out why you are stopping is it you breath your legs then stop and walk do not be hard on yourself give yourself good thoughts on how well your doing then tell yourself i will do this again tomorrow  then when you do it again just go a little further use that spot as a threshold to improve yourself little by little is a lot better than nothing
fwWq2llXaa	I was always tired and wanting to sleep.  The medication Abilify help lessen these symptoms as well as help my OCD|`|RCWDyzogaa	One of the issues could be from the medications you previously took.  Another answer could be diet and how you sleep.  Do you toss and turn?  If so, try to get a bed that is comfotable enough so you don't toss and turn all the time.  Also you can eat foods that give you more energy.  Natural foods have proven to help me.  I used to fall asleep in high school all the time and for my first 2 years of college, but since I've been eating healthy and sleep more sound I don't get tired anymore.  Carbs are a good source of energy, stay away from excessive amounts of sugar they only make you crash halfway through the day.  Too many carbs is bad though, you will gain weight if you eat them in excess.|`|ltMbMIPlaa	are you taking any meds for OCD now? is so, that is one of the side effects. all you have to do is to drink some coffee. you need some pcik me up drinks like red bull or that  5hour energy thing|`|eJWD0eILaa	go back to the doctor and get your iron levels checked. Low blood pressure will also cause this problem there are lots of possible reasons which you are better off discussing with doctor so they can do test.|`|erygtAraaa	Well the depression causes all the things you told me, i say you should go to another doctor and get another answer. A second answer is always good! =]    For now take a lot of protein, vitamins, fruits and well sleep only the hours you need. If you get tired do somethin that can keep you busy so you dont sleep a lot. I hope this helps!    Hope you get better!!!

AxplwMKTaa	Hiyahh im 13, I got my first one in september 2008 and it lasted roughly about that time, But as it came in november it lasted about 6 day or a week. Also yes it is normal for it to be short but it will get longer a normal period is about a week..     =]] x|`|LMRaSXFeaa	your period can be diffrent each time you have it.  a typical period is 3-7 days.|`|g3OCU69Zaa	No it won't always be that short. It will take some time to become regular. It will usually last 5-7 days.|`|1rMEP8HAaa	when you start your periods they are often hay wire it will take a few months for it to regulate it is normal though, a period usually last for 7 days but if it's your first it's usually short|`|S1jddreQaa	Since this was your first period it was probably shorter then you period will be when its becomes more regular. It might stay then same, but when I got my first one it was 4 days, and now I've had it for two years and its 7 days long. Periods are usually around 3-8 days long.|`|QjoWA99Yaa	If you've only just started them, they're going to be irregular so don't worry about it.  The typical period is about 5-7 days long but many people are very different to that.

Am7J9MVBaa	Firsty, don't try swalling pills in front of people. You won't do as well if you're rushed or embarrassed.  Next, stop thinking about it so much! If you forget it's there, and drink water normally, it should go down!     I wouldn't suggest breaking it in half, the medicine can leak a nasty flavor.|`|DjtNLFHsaa	i swallowed my first pill in 3rd grade. (12th now) it wouldnt go down the first time. but its really simple. just put the pill on your tongue and swallow. if it doesnt go down the 1st time. gulp more water. or have water in your mouth then put the pill in. sooner or later you have to learn how to swallow a pill. JUST DO IT !! its simple. k bye|`|WXpdkbG8aa	I put the pill under my tongue, take a sip of a drink and then let the pill mix in with my drink and swallow. It feels like just taking a sip of a drink because no pill is really too large. Hope that helps!|`|DujXZCd9aa	Put it in pudding or water and just slurp it all down. Sooner or later you will have to get rid of it.|`|ikVcbHMIaa	I had the same problem. I just drink a lot of water with them, and eventually it gets down. You could always break them in half some way - that would make it even easier|`|kltRWD81aa	Wow I always thought this was just me! (Im a 13 year old girl) I can only swallow little tiny pills. I am getting better at swallowing bigger ones ,but Im always afraid I am going to get choked. But what I do is get a pill put it in your mouth, And take a drink of water and swallow it like you are just taking a drink. Good Luck! I hate swallowing pills too! Good Luck! Hope I Helped!|`|aiyU3Qf9aa	Try (by yourself) wrapping the pill in something you like; sweet, chocolate, etc. and swallow that down. I know it sounds corny and it's how we get our pets to take pills but it's worth a try. Any regular bite of food you take  will be WAY bigger than a pill and you can swallow that, so it's just getting used to the idea of taking a pill that you need to work on. After the first two or three times you'll have no problem.
52bgCRpjaa	5,000 calories is unhealthy, usually when you are sick or have a "bug" you don't tend to eat as much as you would when you are healthy. Maybe, you just felt hungry today, wanted some things that you haven't had in awhile. It is okay to do this every now and then, just not on a regular basis.|`|1oWCTV1aaa	It is a possibility to lose weight fast but you should be realistic and understand that if you lose weight fast then you will almost certainly put it all back on again just as fast. The only diet which clearly delivered for me is wu-yi tea, it can be checked out in the resource box below, they have a small number of free trials left, it was featured in Fox News and USA Today. I melted away 20 pounds, it clearly does work!|`|rDsKB0uXaa	that's unhealthy eat salads
tDaU7eYXaa	DO NOT TRY DIETS. It will flush out all of the crap, but it will leave you weak and not feeling great. You could take a couple laxatives daily in good tasting flavors if you want, though. You should excersise. Do a couple of push-ups. Every day. It REALLY make you feel awesome, knowing that you ARE losing. The burn doesn't last as long as you stretch. You will know you are staying fit, not thin and frail and weak and all that crap. Just do around maybe 10 a day. Do not work out one day each week though. You need to be devoted. If you know you can't work out one week, don't even go that week. You'll just be wasting energy and making yourself hungry. If you decide to eat healthier, just make sure you still eat a little of your comfort foods. We don't want you to have a sudden outburst of eating junk! Remember, don't starve yourself and turn weak, try to work on fitness. Eat healthier as well. You WILL see results. Nobody likes frail people whose bones are showing!!! Go person, whoever you are!!!!|`|yoAcz6GLaa	The south beach diet worked for all my family. Basically you just stop eating carbs.

BVIPL2Tiaa	have a light breakfast, like maybe  a couple of eggs, hve like a meat sandwhich, without mayo for lunch and eat a healthy dinner. try to seriously minimize your sweets, and salads in between. to treat yourself eat like a bowl of ice cream once a week. eat yogurt when you feel weak . then do some ab workouts at home, and like 30 pushups a day. this should healp you loose about 2 lbs a week. also, try running around the block or running in place. good luck.|`|zWqKuIQuaa	Stop eating  run around the block.|`|WqI4rCrhaa	YOU TUBE! obviously don't eat empty calories like white bread/pasta when you're trying to shed weight- but you can find fun ways to work out on You tube like TaeBo and Dance routines.

wXKs94nDaa	Okay, so I have been struggling with my weight for a long time. Finally I decided to cough up the money and join weight watchers. (BTW, I dont have a lot of  money).     So its about $18 per week, and I gave up junk food so Im saving about $30 per week. (just a thought)     I lost 12 lbs starting december 15 so on average, I have lost about 1.7 lbs per week. Its a lot of food, I am never hungry and I have a huge variety of food to choose from.     I gave you all the information that you could, now its your decision. (PSST! JOIN WEIGHT WATCHERS)

KRo3Ik3Baa	Well, the last time I looked at the scar I had from my appendix removal, it was the right side.  And yes it could be your appendix.  If you are running a temperature, have general abdominal pain that is tender to touch, have minimal to no apetite, and pain, it's a strong possibility and you should get checked.  You will have an elevated white blood cell count.  Don't wait too long - I did, and I wound up full of gangrene.|`|aXnVFFUkaa	left side is appendix|`|Pmb0MeB8aa	The appendix is NOT on the left, it is on the right.

Upper right pain is more likely related to the gallbladder (or simply gas pain).  If you have never had gallbladder problems before, don't eat anything (drinking water is OK),  and go to the ER if you also have nausea or fever.  If you have only pain at this point, it might be OK to try to wait until tomorrow to see a doc - you can still go to an ER at any time if things get worse.|`|9orKxie9aa	Your appendix is on the right side of your body. However, I have heard that the pain from appendicitis is extremely painful, like you wouldn't even think about posting this question to yahoo answers because it hurt so much, either you would be doubled over in pain, or on your way to the hospital. It is possible that it could be a pulled muscle.Or your gallbladder. Either way, if the pain is getting worse, better to be safe than sorry.
VALxlwYSaa	Yes it's normal.   Is it healthy? No. Not emotionally or physically. You don't want to hear it but you should get some help or talk to someone.     - not trying to be rude or anything just stating the truth.     [:|`|Am7J9MVBaa	A lot of people will probably call you emo for this.   Hahah... I think it's pretty normal though.

9GUZzm5Saa	Finding That Elusive G-Spot    A G-spot on a woman is not easy to find, but once you do you can give her great pleasure and intense orgasms. When your partner is lying on her back you can find the G-spot located around 1.5 inside the vagina on the vaginas upper wall. The most intense orgasms can come when a woman has her G-spot stimulated.     The G-spot tends to have a different texture that the rest of the vagina, as it has ridges and is not as smooth. When the G-spot is aroused it can feel a bit spongy. If your partner has a G-spot orgasm you will know it, as she will be in heaven for a few minutes afterwards. It is defiantly beneficial for you to find your partners G-spot, as it will not only make her feel fantastic but she will thank you for it in reciprocal ways.    Here is one G Spot technique that may bring your partner to ultimate bliss. Having your fingers around 2-3 inches inside her vagina move them in circles around the inside of the vagina. Keep firm and constant pressure on all the walls of the vagina while you are fingering her. You can add a bit more pressure near her stomach but make sure you do not break the steady circular rhythm. Stop rotating your fingers and keep your fingertips on the, generally ridged, area of her vagina, which is a little behind her pubic bone exerting pressure upwards towards her stomach. This is direct stimulation of the G-spot and it tends to feel best for your partner when your fingers are moving about in a subtle and not jerky manner. Depending on what feels better for her you can either move your fingers in slow circles or keep your fingers pointed and keep them rolling back and forth over the G-spot. You can tell by her body language what area feels the best and what motion feels the best. But it also never hurts to ask, as the better you are at communication in the sack the more likely you are to find out where her erogenous zones, in this case the G-spot, are.    A more advanced technique of G-spot stimulation is combining the two finger motions listed just above. Using your fingers you can trace the inside of her vagina while moving in and out of it. You have to be sure that the ends of your finger are always going over the G-spot after each rotation of your fingers, as this will give it constant stimulation and may build up to an intense orgasm. You have to find the rhythm and technique that gives her the most pleasure and when you have found it she will definitely be glad you did.    When you move to intercourse try to use the angle and position where her G-spot will still be stimulated. If you stimulate the G-spot during intercourse it will make it more likely that she can reach orgasm.    This site is a great resource for information.|`|5bknapOQaa	It's about 2 inches in the vagina, your boyfriend just needs to find the right spot.|`|tCq1xpqraa	no one knows where it is! haha seriously most ppl dont have a clue.|`|272aa91fee0690c497ce8d228459dc94aa	It's about an inch inside, towards the front. If he inserts his finger and bends it upwards, that should stimulate it, providing he's found the right spot. Or if you're having sex, penetration from the back allows easier access and the right angle to stimulate it repeatedly more so than the missionary position.

GHDqJIkKaa	hey honey im struggling too so your not alone.  it will help you to get lots of info so i put a link to google:)    well...cut out fatty foods with saturated fat and such. i know stopping things like soda or your morning doughnut but they are just bogging down your body with junk.  eat fruits and veggies and things like beans and nuts.make sure to get your calcium and iron, we teenagers need them.    most likely you will tone your body with adequate exercise (which will also make you lose weight:))you might try just getting your body moving at home with like jumping jacks, push-ups, sit-ups, crunches, jump rope, or just dance to music. i have to say, tho, that push-up are great because you get to use your whole body and you can make them harder by doing more.    when the weather gets warmer try to get outside and run. you can have a parent use his or her car to track a mile in your hood. you could also get a membership at a pool and swim. swimming is good because you burn calories by swimming laps and by playing with friends.    you said you were (going to be) 14, 128lbs, and 5'4" so your BMI is 22.0 which is normal weight. on this other website it said your height's ideal weight would be 117 pounds. an unhealthy weight for your height is less than 107 pounds. it is considerd unhealthy to lose more than 1-2 pounds per week so for you to lose    remember to listen to your body. and give yourself some slack when you slip up girly!    happy birthday in advance    xx  chicky-poo|`|WXpdkbG8aa	You're not fat at all.

Try to avoid too ygreasy foods and if you stop drinking soda that can help too.  As for toning up, I honestly have no idea bc I've never been able to tighten my stomach.   Also, when you start to lose weight the chances are it will come from your thighs, chest, and butt first... weight loss can't be targeted at one area

lhOd2hvXaa	It would be an exhalation.....inhalation is active, exhalation is primarily passive.    Good question, hope this helps :)|`|UZ0t2tz4aa	Usually a series of gurgles...a deep breath then a slow exhale.....the body continues to fight to breath until it can't....the muscles relax and the air goes out....then the decay starts.|`|jJwuMTSqaa	I think it could be both. I think it would depend on how you die. More so inhale, I think...|`|kIblsxJQaa	could be either.  All depends whether you are inhaling or exhaling at the point of death.|`|SsB7aRExaa	Exhale.  As the muscles relax, the chest collapses, thus expelling the air inside.|`|SlhuFfuZaa	My grand pa snored heavily and noisily as he slept. He could be heard even in the upstairs attic bedroom of the old log house that had been built in the early 1800's when his dad had first came to the hills of north Arkansas.   When he snored, he almost growled while inhaling and a loud whistle on the exhale.  He and I had been out working all day in the heat, plowing a five acre field behind mules. He had forgotten to wear his hat that day and the temperature rose to over 100 degrees and his head had gotten a bad sunburn.  When we finished plowing we walked the three miles to one of his daughters, the closest place to the field. After a drink of cool water from the well, we went inside and my aunt said for us to stay for supper.   Grand pa said he needed a nap before eating as it wasn't time yet.  He sat in an overstuffed arm chair and dosed off, snoring in just a short time.  About thirty minutes later grand pa quit snoring. We had heard the growl and the whistle, but no further sound. I checked on him and he was gone, died from sunstroke. He was 105 years old.  His last breath was an exhale, as was my mothers and fathers. I have seen three others die two in my arms and they exhaled their last.  So I would say the last in most cases, anyway would be exhale.|`|fvwLFWqwaa	both they just die when trhe y die|`|OUMK0bgiaa	exhale...what goes in must come outtt!|`|Me8JEgzpaa	People can die not breathing at all. Most of the time they will exhale. It is like work. Sooner or later you will quit or retire. You can't stay in there forever. Like air, you can stay there forever. If someone is choked to death, then it is neither. You can't die inhaling, but you can die not breathing.|`|652c9c4ac00397e3d3a672481ae4771baa	I don't know.  I'll tell you when I'm about the kick the bucket, alright? :)|`|xsizQ5X1aa	Exhale.

If they were alive long enough to draw in the final breath, but died before they exhaled, it would be an inhale. if they died while still in the exhale state, it would be an exhale.|`|dPzXLo9uaa	I believe it's an exhale.  Your organs relax then shut down.  Upon doing that I've heard that more than breath can come out.|`|lr29szFDaa	Exhale!!!!|`|ojiO3svoaa	exhale. it is called the death rattle. everything relaxes.even your bowels sometimes. very sad to see.|`|8ece086bcb9def7d0fac85bdcbb1039faa	I would have to believe it would be an exhale due to simple physics.  If your last breath was an inhale and you died, the pressure in your lungs would naturally force the air back out.  Take a breath then relax and see if the air stays in your lungs.  Definitely exhale.|`|hdnI8ARiaa	no inhale, that takes muscles.

It's normal to feel uncomfortable showering around other men, but even in the extremely unlikely even that every single one of those middle aged men was gay, the chances that someone was going to jump you is virtually *zero*.    Statistically, 95 percent of those guys were straight and/or married; and even the five percent who were gay would almost certainly be interested in someone their own age.  (Pedophilia is talked about a lot, but in actuality is *extremely* uncommon even among gay people.)

yNvA3Wreaa	Depends on what kind it is.  Melanoma is most serious, squamous cell carcinoma tends to be less so, and basal cell carcinoma can be very slow growing.      He needs to go to the doctor.  Many cancers can be cured with treatment, but delaying this makes the treatment more complicated and less likely to succeed.  Your father might just need a minor procedure to remove the growth at this point.      There's really no downside to seeing the doctor.  If it's not cancer, then he can stop worrying about it.  If it is cancer, he can get treatment.
5I7Ifrmraa	Unlike bacteria, viruses are not "living" organisms but capsules of genetic material. They require living hosts  such as people, plants or animals  to multiply. Otherwise, they can't survive. When a virus enters your body, it invades some of your cells and takes over the cell machinery, redirecting it to produce the virus. The virus may eventually kill the host cells. Some viral infections, such as influenza and HIV, are contagious. Others are not.|`|xsizQ5X1aa	bacteria spread through cell division. Viruses take over other cells to replicate.     Many other differences but that's the main one I think. Been a while since bio class|`|2xpzhN5faa	Bacteria are cause by bacteria and tend to be harder to get rid of.  Viral are caused by viruses, and not so difficult. Some viral infections may not even need medication.|`|K8qMighsaa	viral disease: disease caused by a virus. generally, virsus cant be cured. like the common cold or hiv/aids, they either run their course and go away on their own, or you die from them! you can only treat the symptoms, like headache or inflammation or fever, but that doesnt cure the infection/disease, it only makes you feel better while the virus is doing its thing. textbook definition follows>>>>>    A virus (from the Latin virus meaning toxin or poison) is a sub-microscopic infectious agent that is unable to grow or reproduce outside a host cell. Viruses infect all cellular life. The first known virus, tobacco mosaic virus, was discovered by Martinus Beijerinck in 1899,[1] and now more than 5,000 types of virus have been described.[2] The study of viruses is known as virology, and is a branch of microbiology.    Viruses consist of two or three parts: all viruses have genes made from either DNA or RNA, long molecules that carry genetic information; all have a protein coat that protects these genes; and some have an envelope of fat that surrounds them when they are outside a cell. Viruses vary in shape from simple helical and icosahedral shapes, to more complex structures. They are about 100 times smaller than bacteria.[3] The origins of viruses are unclear: some may have evolved from plasmidspieces of DNA that can move between cellsothers may have evolved from bacteria.    Viruses spread in many ways; different species of virus use different methods. For example, plant viruses are often transmitted from plant to plant by insects that feed on sap, such as aphids, while animal viruses can be carried by blood-sucking insects. These disease-bearing organisms are known as vectors. Influenza viruses are spread by coughing and sneezing, and others such as norovirus, are transmitted by the faecal-oral route, when they contaminate hands, food or water. Rotavirus is often spread by direct contact with infected children. HIV is one of several viruses that are transmitted through sex.    Not all viruses cause disease, as many viruses reproduce without causing any obvious harm to the infected organism. Some viruses such as HIV can cause life-long or chronic infections, and the viruses continue to replicate in the body despite the hosts' defence mechanisms. However, viral infections in animals usually cause an immune response, which can completely eliminate a virus. These immune responses can also be produced by vaccines that give lifelong immunity to a viral infection. Microorganisms such as bacteria also have defences against viral infection, such as restriction modification systems. Antibiotics have no effect on viruses, but antiviral drugs have been developed to treat life-threatening and more minor infections.    bacterial infection: a bacteria is a "germ" that can be cured. so if you have a bacterial infection/disease, the doctor will prescribe some type of antibiotic to zap the sucker before it zaps you :-X more on bacteria follows >>>>>  The Bacteria  [b?k?t??r??] (helpinfo) (singular: bacterium)[] are a large group of unicellular microorganisms. Typically a few micrometres in length, bacteria have a wide range of shapes, ranging from spheres to rods and spirals. Bacteria are ubiquitous in every habitat on Earth, growing in soil, acidic hot springs, radioactive waste,[2] water, and deep in the Earth's crust, as well as in organic matter and the live bodies of plants and animals. There are typically 40 million bacterial cells in a gram of soil and a million bacterial cells in a millilitre of fresh water; in all, there are approximately five nonillion (51030) bacteria on Earth,[3] forming much of the world's biomass.[4] Bacteria are vital in recycling nutrients, with many important steps in nutrient cycles depending on these organisms, such as the fixation of nitrogen from the atmosphere and putrefaction. However, most bacteria have not been characterized, and only about half of the phyla of bacteria have species that can be cultured in the laboratory.[5] The study of bacteria is known as bacteriology, a branch of microbiology.    There are approximately ten times as many bacterial cells as human cells in the human body, with large numbers of bacteria on the skin and in the digestive tract.[6] Although the vast majority of these bacteria are rendered harmless by the protective effects of the immune system, and a few are beneficial, some are pathogenic bacteria and cause infectious diseases, including cholera, syphilis, anthrax, leprosy and bubonic plague. The most common fatal bacterial diseases are respiratory infections, with tuberculosis alone killing about 2 million people a year, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa.[7] In developed countries, antibiotics are used to treat bacterial infections and in various agricultural processes, so antibiotic resistance is becoming common. In industry, bacteria are important in processes such as sewage treatment, the production of cheese and yoghurt through fermentation, as w

ORluWHGAaa	1. Do you have any LED blue light? (alarm, bedside light..etc) If you do, take it away because it can effect your health and make you can't sleep at night (use red light)  2. Too much food, especially fatty, rich food, liquid, caffeine can interfere with your sleep  3. Quiet your mind. There are many things you can do to help your brain wind down and prepare for sleep. Relaxation techniques set the stage for quieting the mind. Make some simple preparations for the next day, like a to-do list or laying out the next days clothes and shoes.  Some people find jotting down a list of worries makes them more manageable.   4. Wear socks to bed. Due to the fact that they have the poorest circulation, the feet often feel cold before the rest of the body. A study has shown that this reduces night wakings  5. Also eat a small piece of fruit. This can help the tryptophan cross the blood-brain barrier.  6. Take a hot bath or shower before go to bed  7. Put your work away at least one hour (but preferably two or more) before bed. This will give your mind a chance to unwind so you can go to sleep feeling calm, not hyped up or anxious about tomorrow's deadlines.

HdEnrf0gaa	this does point to a period, sometimes it takes 2-6 months before it begins, this happened to me. I got my period in December a year ago. but my period began in September. It was just dried up blood and some white goo (vaginal discharge) then in december i started for real. Don't worry about being the last. I was the last one in my grade too. AND it's better NOT to have it, because IT'S A PAIN! If you're maturing that's a sign, i started getting pubic hair 2-3 months before my period started. I think the vagina just discharges a bit to prepare itself.  About the pad: YES! Keep a pad, but keep in a place, like your backpack...try to make it's a place that zips up. Keep 2 or three. If you feel like you don't want a stained underwear...keep an extra underwear in ur backpack too.  Cramps, well yea they hurt. Drink Chamomile, or a warm tea. Also take a pain reliever when you drink the tea.  If you get blobs of blood that's normal, it's just blood that didn't get discharged the last month.  If your period is late, it's all right. Beginners have that happen. I've had my period for a year and I still get it late.   FOOD YOU SHOULD AVOID DURING YOUR PERIOD:  BANANAS: They cause your period to slow down, and it actually makes it stink.  SPICY FOOD: Causes cramps, and irritation  ORANGES: Same symptoms as spicy food.  SODA: Same symptoms of spicy food, and oranges.  When you get your period make sure to shower 1-2 days AFTER it began. My mom says it's bad, and it might cause blobs, and slows down your period flow.  If you're craving food that you usually don't want, or that you JUST NEED...well that's a symptom that your period is coming.  if you need any other help go to:  http://www.gurl.com  hope everything helps!|`|jky64DZ8aa	i don't think you should worry about it, just enjoy not having it as an extra worry for the moment    keep a pad in a zip pocket in your bag in case you need it in an emergency    as long as your a healthy weight and everything you'll start when you ready which sounds like it will be soon although i dont think cramps should be so bad as to make you feel sick, if you have anymore that bad i would probably talk to you mum about it and she'll be able to help you.

The cramps are another symptom. Sure, it's always good to have an extra pad on hand. I'd just keep it in a little pocket of my backback instead of my locker-it's more accessible there. I don't really know a place you could hide it in your locker, unless you like tape it behind your books or something? idk I think the backpack is better.

Please do not starve yourself - that is really unhealthy, and in the long run your body can go into "starvation mode" and start saving extra fat to keep your organs functioning, and it'll get rid of your muscle mass instead.  And if you do an extreme diet, you may lose weight quickly, but will come back on very quickly as well.|`|HNLskA4Aaa	oh god. Don't STARVE YOURSELF. You'll kill yourself. Unless that's what you want. You're proabably eating alot of meat. Eat more fruits and vegtables, and excersise. Bannanas have the same amount of protein as steak, y'know? Unless you're too young to go to a diet program, losing weight will take slower, unless you're really serious about it. eat LESS, but not too less. Not meat much meat, and try excesising in the morning, or as much as you can. That's my advice. But every body works differently. My answer, and other people  s answers wont be 100% guaranteed.|`|ffe5fd93595474e278dc16274aa2a2d4aa	don't starve- if you do you will slow down your metabolism too much and as soon as you eat ANYTHING extra, you will end up wearing it if you get what I mean.    Insted, reduce your caloire intake by up to 500kcals per day (no more) so your eating around 1350kcals per day, no more then 1500kcals per day.    Excercise, do an hour a day of something that gets your heart rate up.    Work out your muscles, they not only take up less space then fat gram for gram, but they need to burn calories just simply to exist: meaning you can be burning even more calories just by sitting down infront of the TV.    Eat 3 to 5 portions of fruit a day, and 3 to 5 of vegetables a day, every day. It will fill you up for fewer calories and help stop you losing out on the many vitamins that dieters often miss out on.    Do not drink ANY full sugar drinks, just don't, its not worth it.    Make sure you are eating enough protein, without it, you will find it near impossible to develop muscle and so will insted gain carbohydrate storage which will later be converted to fat. Fruit, veg, its all carbohydrates, so basicly its essential you eat 1 gram of protein for every kilo of your body weight. Make sure you read on the back of the packet for protein, 100grams of cheese has about 20 grams of protein in, 100grams of tuna has about 40 grams of protein in, 100grams of quorn has about 25grams of protein in, so being a vegetarian, you have your work cut out for you!    Try:  Breakfast 300kcals: Porridge, 40 grams with skimmed milk, and cup of tea OR coffee     Lunch: 400kcals: Salad made with extra low fat Protein such as quorn, or just have a sprinking of nuts- (not sure what is apporpiate for vegans) and lettuce, tomatos cucumber..etc with balsamic vinegar NO OIL! and a small fruit salad afterwards    Dinner: 500kcals: find out what you like and keep to 500kcals, can be anything but make sure your getting enough fruit and veg.    Snacks: to have in the day time: from 200 to 300kcals of fresh fruit and veg.    Take an evening primrose oil capsual or a vege/vegan omega pill every day, it will make alot of difference to your skin, and keep you feeling better and so better to cope with the diet.    If you have a msitake, let it go, just try to salvage what you have got and carry on afterwards- never wait "until tomorrow! its just not going to happen, leaving it till tomorrow is too long away.|`|6f52c047b2a7fd8bfc275fa11892816caa	you don't need to starve you need to exercise!  no lifts,use the stairs.  walk rather than use car etc  press ups, sit ups, lunges, squats, plank can all be done at home.  jog, get a bike or join a gym.  If you want to lose weight fast then build up fairly quickly to an hour 5 days a week and don't start eating extra just cos you're exercising.

vEGkSHMsaa	Don't surround yourself with unhealthy food. Before you go out with friends or whatever, eat at home so your not hungry later. If you are stuck ordering something outside your home, there are plenty of foods that are healthier than others. For example, when you go to a fast food joint, order a chicken sandwich and ask for a cup of water. If the rest of your diet is in check and your exercising it wont make a difference. Do you live to eat or eat to live. Start making better decisions and eat more nutrient dense foods. You dont want to do all this exercise for nothing.|`|oyB861Swaa	I have the same problems  I have a friend who is so skinny and pretty.  I always tell her she is my inspirtation advice.

Bring two fingers close to your eye (index and thumb)  Separate the fingers slightly   Push them very gently against two opposite ends of the contact.

9l0GdKbbaa	Treatment for bacterial vaginosis are special antibiotics. They are not the same as the antibiotics used to treat other things.   'Flagyl' is taken by pill or by gel you put in your vagina with a little plastic tube.   Also is the cream 'Cleocin' that you put in the same way.   The pill can cause side effects, but is believed to be the most effective treatment.     There are many steps you can take to prevent future vaginal infections. Try some of these before you get your next vaginal infection.     Always wipe from front to back after going   2 to prevent "stuff" from entering the vagina.    Don't Douch. Douching messes with the balance of organisms in the vagina which leads to bacterial or yeast infections and also spreads infection up into the reproductive tract where it can do damage.    Keep the vaginal area clean and dry and avoid tight clothing and always wear cotton panties that help absorb moisture and allow air to circulate.    Avoid scented toilet paper, perfumes, and harsh soaps or detergents if the vaginal area is irritated.    DO NOT use vaseline because it will make it worse by trapping the bacteria and making it spread.|`|IM3QwSS2aa	I don't know how you gonna generate 15 points when best answer is 10. unless... never mind.    however take some Oil of Oregano capsules internally to work on the infection internally.

W1tx1p2iaa	A polysonogram or sleep study can identify about 80 plus different sleep disoders.  Sleep apnea is by far the most common.  It can tell if you have any siezures or brain wave abnormalities from the EEG  They can tell if you have any heart rythm abnormalities from the EKG.  The leg wires are EMG and they can tell if you have restless leg syndrome.  The wire on your finger can tell what your oxygen level is all night.  Other wires include the snore microphone, flow sensor (in the nose), the face electrodes are generally EMG wires.  They can tell when you are in REM.  The belts around the chest are to show respiratory and abdominal effort.  It helps to determine if you have central sleep apnea vs. obstructive sleep apnea.    Hope this helps

DRINK LOTS OF WATER. when your hungry but you dont want to eat chug a bottle of water. seriously, it keeps you full and you lose water weight. also slim fast works! drink those and only have one real/healthy meal a day. dont get strssed and make a plan for yourself. you might not drop 2 dress sizes in a month but u will lose weight. promise. hope this helps!|`|NKE6Apz9aa	its hard to lose weight but before you eat anything unhealthy think about it. also eat small amounts of food.  if your going to the gym your probably losing weight.|`|00w8ELLOaa	Try the accelerated fat burning diet, visit the link below:   http://tinyurl.com/dckjx4
803c63e1bdfd226d14f4e5cafdc52f7eaa	Sure it works. But it's only because it's low calorie. You can substitute any cereal or food for that matter for the Special K as long as it's the same amount of calories and you will lose weight.     I lost about 20 pounds having Special K for breakfast, a banana a couple hours later, a Weight Watchers dinner for lunch, almonds for a snack, and another dinner for dinner. I was h ungry at first but after a couple of days your stomach shrinks and you find out you don't need that much food. I was at the point where I was too full to finish most of those dinners.     I'm thin now, and I recently had a tummy tuck after a lot of weight loss, and all I could eat during that time was cereal. I lost another 5 pounds in a week. So yeah, it works!|`|db479662109a13fa062d0f7c3ccf7629aa	no  Special K is crap-- sugar, corn syrup and cheap grains.  It's not enough calories to remain healthy.  It's not enough protein to be healthy.  If you currently have a poor diet, but substitute it with our cereal - you may lose 4.4 pounds over the first two weeks. You will be probably feel very hungry while restricting your calories, and will may find eating cereal for dinner or lunch to be untenable after a while. Boredom could well set in. History shows that a low-fat, higher-carb diet can work, but in the long run it may backfire|`|0OQDnKCmaa	It's basically just a low-calorie diet.

lXDK0iuraa	ok you want a strength training system, a lot of people say to be healthy you have to run, but when your slim you dont need to as much you need to lift,  get in the gym and insted of running to build up legs (running gives you speed and endurance not power) do squats, deadlifts, leg press and cleans, also for your arms get on the bench press (there will be three types an incline, a declina and a flat, they all work out diffrent areas of the chest so use all of them they also get your triceps so be sure to do curls too so your tris dont look rediculous next to your bis, that will get you big, also eat a lot of protien chicken beef, if thats not enough or your a vegitarian get protien supliments (they can be pricey) protien biulds muscle but it also makes fat so make sure you keep a consistant cardio workout about 3 times a week, that should help you.    last thing when you do the workout do a "pyramid" were you start at a resonable weight that you can do 10 times, then increase by a resonable interval (10lbs- a side for bench, 25lbs for legs, squats and dead lifts and 5lbs for curls) and do it 2 times less so ill give you an example    bench:  10 reps 180, 8 reps 200, 6 reps 220, 4 reps 240 2 reps 260    then go back down, also do a burnout or put on a weight you would find easy before you started so lets say you max on the bench was 220 youd put 110 on there (half your max) and do as many times as you can.|`|af336b3495713e4f9a1c9b7ad6397609aa	5 day plan   warm up 10 mins on treadmill or on watever else everyday  Streatch for 5-7 mins  chest shoulder day first  bicep tricep day 2nd  legs  back & abs  day 3rd  then repeat day 1st & 2nd   Make sure to take ur suppliments like multivitamins & drink protein after workout|`|ua9jhWPIaa	hey dude! I'm around 140 too. If you want to bulk up, heres what you need to do:    you need alot of protein, use protein shakes, like whey or just eat lots of meat. I suggest chicken because it's high protein and low fat.    Second, you should do heavy weights, like for example, do curling for biceps. Lift a weight that is heavy, but not too heavy whereas you lose form. Keep the weight at a pretty heavy setting. Do 3 sets of 5-7.     For triceps and pecs, do Benchpressing, for thighs do squats. Remember to keep the weights heavy.    Also, it's good to alternate your workout.    Here's a good protein shake, I use it for myself.  http://www.gnc.com/product/index.jsp?pro...

1vZ1n0agaa	it does sound like blood but you may be having an allergic reaction to the food you are eating    i went ot webmd and it says you might be having food poisoning (actually it just says poisoning), antibiotic use, or medication reaction    Poisoning Overview    If you, a family member, or a friend has swallowed or breathed in a poison and you have serious signs or symptoms (nausea, vomiting, pain, trouble breathing, seizure, confusion, or abnormal skin color), then you must either call an ambulance for transport to a hospital emergency department or call a poison control center for guidance.    If the person has no symptoms but has taken a potentially dangerous poison, you should also call a poison control center or go to the nearest emergency department for an evaluation.    Poison is anything that kills or injures through its chemical actions. Most poisons are ingested (swallowed). The word poison comes from the Latin wordpotaremeaning to drink. But poisons can also enter the body in other ways:        * By breathing      * Through the skin      * By IV injection      * From exposure to radiation    Poisoning Causes    We usually think of poisons as highly toxic chemicals not meant for human use, such as cyanide, paint thinners, or household cleaning products.    Many poisons, however, are substances meant for humans to eat, including foods and medicines.        * Foods      * The mushroom that turns out to be poisonous      * Drinking water contaminated by agricultural or industrial activities      * Food that has not been properly handled      * Drugs      * Drugs that are helpful in therapeutic doses may be deadly when taken in excess. Here are some examples:            o Beta-blockers are a type of medicine used to calm and slow the heart.            o Coumadin is a blood thinner used to prevent blood clots. It is the active ingredient in many rat poisons and may cause heavy bleeding and death if too much is taken.            o Vitaminsespecially A and Dif taken in large amounts can cause liver trouble and death.|`|PdJRjwQJaa	I don't know what you have but for the the taste you could try listerine|`|T1z1SGe3aa	its blood.  spit,if your spit is red or brown,then its blood.  but i doubt its respiratory,unless you have to cough up the blood.  but you always taste it so its not respiratory.  any loose teeth?that could be it if youre young|`|UxdjYFJaaa	Are you taking Naproxen?

6MwIvHlNaa	Your muscles adapt to the HEAVIEST weight you lift in a workout.    If you can do 19 reps at 180lbs, why not do 4-6 at 220+?    Try this for a few weeks:    bar only x 12 (warmup 1)  100lbs x 12 (warmup 2)  heaviest x 4-6  heaviest - 20 lbs x 6-8    It will take a bit of experimenting to find a weight you can just about lift 4 - 6 times.  First 2-3 should be without any help from spotter, then rest with just a small bit of help at sticking points.    Finally, NEVER bench more than once a week or your muscles wont have time to recover fully.|`|TjPwxbuJaa	That's a good amount of weight considering how much you weigh (you must be quite thin!) and you can do 19 reps. I'm about the same height as you but weigh a lot more (220 pounds -- but very lean). I can bench up to 315 pounds, but certainly not 19 reps!  I wouldn't focus on comparing to what you or others think is bad/good/average, but always strive to improve yourself. If you goal is to improve strength, you should do a weight where the maximum number of repititions is between 6 and 8. For things like bench presses, you should use a smith machine or spotter for such heavy weights. If your goal is to increase mass, then strive for 10-12 reps.  This follows for other exercises as well. Don't focus on just the bench press, either. I don't understand why so many people do that. There are so many more important exercises!

Yes you can over train and you will eventually injure yourself. And doing it everyday to failure will not help you. When you lift your body, your essential breaking up muscle, so you need that rest so they can repair and be stronger.     So to improve your push-up, go into a gym, work out your pecs, deltoids, and triceps. Focus on muscular endurance. Vary your push up as well.

ba57fb92aa421eaa3a4ae7f0f80f397caa	Certain types of neck injuries can be dangerous, but probably not the type of injury you are describing.   Dnagerous injuries are ones that affect the spine, the carotid artery (sort of under and slightly behind the ears), or if they damage your esophagus or larynx.      It sounds like the injury you have is to the muscles rand tendons in your neck - a severe bruise and maybe also some minor tearing in the muscle.  Since people tend to constantly move their heads around when they are active, this type of injury is very painful because you don't get any relief.
yY2Czxy2aa	As far as I can tell, there are no proven weight loss benefits from the acai berry, juice, or capsules.    It does seem to be a great supplement (I take it, but don't sell the stuff!) and is full of anti oxidents, which help prevent damage to your body. But that's what you should take it for, not weight loss or fat burning.     The acai berry itself is an amazing thing - has a lot of anti oxidents etc and is really good for you.    But there's nothing really to suggest in scientific terms that it helps with weight loss.     And there are a lot of scams out there, be careful where you buy it from!    I take it, and I think I feel healthier and better. But it's not some type of magic formula, sorry.|`|NPzDQmlQaa	One thing that brought my dieting and losing weight out of the plateau I was in so long was the Acai Berry.  I was stuck at my weight loss goals and this brought me through it and made me lose a lot of weight.  So in my opinion it helped me lose weight tremendously.  I know a lot of that dieting stuff is expensive but I found a free trial of Acai Berry(I think it only cost me like 7-8 bucks at the time for shipping.)  The site was http://starturl.com/efblc -  All I did was try it out for a month and I was sold,  I saw the results I wanted to and like I said I was in that plateau with my weight loss.  This kicked it up a bunch.    Good luck and I hope this helps.|`|qCPnoKy2aa	I'm sure people out there have found success with them, just has they have found success with other fad diets.     I'll say what I always say...    Unless you want to take Acai Berries every day for the rest of your life, don't start.    "Don't do or take anything to lose weight that you wouldn't do or take to keep it off."|`|LCAzlHhEaa	I have tried them; been using them for like 2 weeks now.  But I have also been eating healthy, and working out everyday for at least a half hour to an hour and I have lost weight.  But I don't know if it is because of the berries or because I have been working out.  Also, they say the berries clean out the liver so I have been urinating alot more than I used to; but I also drink more water and have cut out every other type of drink no tea, no soda, no alcohol, just water.|`|18d2fdea791cf6a9b6520bd88025c920aa	I tried the acia berry/colon cleanse combo. A 2-week program. I started at 187 . By day 2, I was at 188 . Day 3, 186  Day 4, 187 . From that point forward, I kept bouncing between those three numbers.  I suppose you could SAY I lost about 12 , but it was the same 2   over and over. The day after it was done (yesterday), I weighed 184  Today, 185 . I weighed at the same time every day, and wearing the same things. I also did not change my dietary habits during this time, except to add some additional water. Draw your own conclusions from this.|`|S730dpLfaa	WARNING! Read this blog before trying Acai Berry!  http://acaiberryscams.wordpress.com/2008...

ItJzrvQ4aa	jogging is an excellent exercise because it let you lose weight  evenly throughout your whole body. If you want to lose weight in  specific areas, you should target them with exercises. If they are  your problem areas, they will be very difficult to tone. You will have  to work double on them. The best approach is this:  1. Lower/control your daily calorie intake (control for normal  weight, lower for overweight).  2. Run/jog to lower your overall body fat percentage.  3. Target your problem areas with exercises.  an  excellent  exercise,  you  can do it in front of your TV: sit on a  stool,  and  put  your toes under something (piece of heavy furniture,  for  example). In your hands hold a little dumbbell. Please, make sure  that  it  is  not very heavy, start with one kilo, for example, or you  will  damage  your  back and spine! Slowly move the upper part of your  body  back, until it's parallel with the ground. Stop for a second and  move it back to the sitting position. Repeat ten times. Every week add  to  the  number  of  repetitions.  You will see the results in a week,  guaranteed! You will see or feel under the fat - if you have any - six  pack  and  muscles.  Dumbbells  do  wonders.  Much  better  than these  crunches  -  I  came  up to three hundreds and there was no results AT  ALL. With the dumbbells you will see it in a week.|`|lXDK0iuraa	do interval running it has been proven to cut stomich fat, its a 30 minute rutine so your going to need to know what (roughly) your avrage is for a 30 minute run (in speed) then you are going to start at a rait faster than that i.e. if you avrage 5mph you do 7.  you run at this pace for 3 minutes, then a slow walk for 3 minutes and you switch also an intense version is you start at your walk speed then you go to your average speed for 3 then you sprint for 15-20 sec, then you go down to your average then you walk, it is a great workout

The 2.5% would most likely irritate less, but check with a doctor if you should use it at all, especially if it irritates eyes.  Make sure when you put in on your face that you don't put it near your lips, or on the skin around your eyes.  Also, be sure you're not putting it on too thick.    if it's giving you a burn or rash, stop using it right away,as you don't want more scarring or breakouts.|`|jw6Lpt37aa	use warm water and salt and then apply olive oil to your face and massage it very good starting from down to up in circulation movement using your finger tips this will help to get your face more relaxed and will cure it from acne for good

jsS03HSNaa	No.  The scars never heal, but they do fade.  Sticks and stones may break your bones, but words hurt like hell.  Don't let anyone ever tell you different.  But remember that you are a stronger person because of it.  I know how destructive it is.  Nightmares, the crying, the fear- I know all about it.  You can trust again, though.  It takes awhile, but you will.  I know I will always be cautious.  Volunteering made me feel a lot better about myself, because I started working with young children and they thought I was their hero.  But you have to learn to be happy.  For me, I would be crying inside but would keep up the happy facade and no one ever suspected anything.  I'm still hurting, because, like you, the abuse came from someone I thought was a friend, and that hurts more then any traditional bully.  But what happens, it's bullying.  And we are their merciless victims who let them get away with it because they were our friends.  I congratulate you for getting out.  When I got out of my abusive friendship, she threw me into a locker and badly injured my hip, then got her friends to internet bash me for the whole school to see.  I know what you're going through.  But one day, you will meet a person who will be there for you unconditionally and all the pain melts into nothing more then a memory.

You should probably get your glucose tested to see whether or not you've got high blood sugar, and if this is the case, they could either diagnose you or monitor you.      Be careful though, because sometimes they may misdiagnose you with a kidney infection, so if you're seriously worried about this, you should consult your doctor - and if, after that, your condition does not improve, you may want to seek another opinion - but don't go alone, because high glucose levels often result in comas.|`|kwbTEhA0aa	The most common sign of diabetes is the consistent urination. When I say this I mean, that if you are waking up in the middle of your sleep to go to the bathroom, you might have diabetes. But there are little signs that can be important too.

dy7aFbhqaa	Well, one thing you can do is try to make it a game.  Write down the calories or carbs that your eating.  Then, try to beat it, and compare with each other as a compitition.  Make something fun for the winner at the end of ever 2 weeks or something like that.  It's always easier to diet with someone, same goes for working out and many other things.  When you don't see it as a diet anymore it becomes easier to follow.

31718204759da1a7cdd40b824d43650aaa	I would say No.   And I am male.    Many females place too much attention to breasts.  Sure we look at them.  Sure the big ones attract a great deal of our attention, but its the flat girls that are most desired.    The reason is because it represents youth.  Also breasts are mainly FAT.  And the more of that you have the more of it is seen elsewhere.    Few females understand this from what I see.    Perhaps the most common error girls make is breast size alteration or concern.  Males don't care much if you are flat.   Or have little pimples on them. Some off the best females I have ever dated could not fill an A cup, and one had nothing at all.  Strange cause her nipple were normal to large.  As it turned out she even laughed at her own flatness.  She was great.  Perhaps the finest date I ever went on.    While a highschool kid might use this to tease a girl.  In the real world its the opposite.  We simply do not care if you have little pimples on the breast.  It makes little difference.  What males care about is sex, and whether the girl will have it with him or just string him along.    The issue of breasts plays the most irrelevant of all parts.Sure if you like guys to look then inflate them, but do so knowing how little value we place upon them.  We talk about them cause its the only sign we have that a girl may be willing and of age.    Believe it or not they are more concerned about their penis size then your cup size or liittle pimples on a breast.  So I would say Naaaaaaaah.      8-)|`|qmbm6wlkaa	i have them too, hopefully its normal lol, dw, if your with the right guy he wont care as long as hes with you|`|p2CJ8zNEaa	you have to ask your man as every one has different turn on's and turn off's

However, masturbating that much may be excessive and could cause problems in the rest of your life.  I don't mean health issues, but social and personal issues.

33QOl2Ahaa	I'm on depo, and i'm switching to normal birth control (pills) in March.   Depo was probably one of the WORST decisions of my life.   A few weeks ago, I started spotting and then full-on bleeding. The pain that came with it was unbearable. I couldn't stand up straight, I couldn't go to school, and it would wake me up in the middle of the night. It made me cry out in pain, literally.   So I went back to my gynecologist and explained what was happening. She gave me estrogen pills to help with the bleeding, and she prescribed "ultram" for the pain. Ultram is similar to codeine, but isn't a narcotic-- THAT is how bad the pain was (and still is).     I would never recommend the depo shot to anyone, ever.   It has ruined my monthly cycle and everything that comes with it.|`|Q3wDaHITaa	I am so sorry. Call your GYN at once and tell her about these symptoms.Do not get another round of depo, your medical provider (who is forbidden by law to discuss anything you tell her with your step mother) can deal with her.     Depo is absolutely vile. I had the worst reaction to it. I gained almost 80 pounds and grew hair on my face.     Talk with your father as well, as far as I am concerned your Step Mother has no right to tell you what form of birth control you have to take. This is a decision to be made between you and your gyn. Maybe your father can put an end to her abuse.
pa7hVLAHaa	Eat all whole organic foods.  This means only eat vegetables, fruits, meats, nuts, tubers, and grains.  All natural stuff that nature intended for you to eat.      Stay away from processed foods and refined sugars.  If you can't pronounce the ingredients, then don't eat it.     Eat this way and exercise and within two weeks you will begin to lose weight.
niLvdq0Qaa	First off--I am very sorry to hear of the difficult decisions which you are going to be facing.  Your Mother has a wonderful son, for most would not be so kind and caring. I am sure she is very proud of you.  If your Mom is entering a Hospice-you will have a wonderful team of professionals to help guide you through this, they are there for you.  Take care of your Mom in a way that will give her the respect and dignity which you gave her all this time, ask her what she wants and how she wants it. Be there for her, with her and let her know how you feel about her and what she has meant to you as a Mom.  I am sure that when the Lord calls for her you will feel the grace of God in the room as your Mom goes to her next dimension in life .  I have worked in a Hospice for over 10 years--you will be fine.
62ls1hm0aa	Yes, running is very good.  I changed my life style 2 years ago, and I have definitely seen results.  Run every other day, and lift on the days you don't run.  When you run, you don't want to keep a stagnant heart-rate;  you want to keep it changing.  Run for a bit, then sprint, then run, then walk etc.  When you lift, you want to feel the burn(not just have difficulty lifting the weight, but actual burn).    Also, try drinking nothing but water and milk and you will see small changes in a month.  Two months and you will feel great.  If you need more assistance or advice, you can feel free to e-mail me (this goes for anyone else reading this as well) at OviperO@SBCGlobal.Net|`|AA11557192	I thik running is probably one of the best exercises.

SO7zRZK9aa	I'd just like to point out the irony of Rats2211 "no"ing that he is more "intellagnt". As for your problem, you're 5'10", what are you worrying about? If you really have the bone structure of a 12 year old and that is causing other problems at all, you might end up taking hormones which will also make you grow. You might just be way behind and it will catch up eventually. Either way, unless you're physically deformed, you have nothing to worry about. You're only 3 inches shorter than your dad and oldest bro.|`|DKnBzCUpaa	Yoghurt, cheese, and boiled chicken. Your bones need phosphorus, calcium, and magnesium while your muscles need water, protein and carbohydrates to grow. Since you are growing taller, both your muscles and bones are getting bigger and longer. Don't waste your money or your health on drugs, alcohol or cigarettes.      Have the hair style that makes you appear taller. In order to appear taller, a hair style should be thin at the sides and higher up top, which can make you appear as much as an inch taller Avoid clothes with horizontal lines. Belts are horizontal so make sure you conceal it in your clothes.  Avoid clothes with a tartan or checked pattern. Avoid cuffs that makes your legs appear shorter.    ? Wear clothes with vertical lines or striping. Vertical lines or stripping make a person appear thinner,  and thinness in turn gives impression of more height.    Wear shoes that will make you appear taller. If you are a female, this should be easy since you can find a lot of female shoes with 2 or 3 inches heels. For males, wear shoes with thick soles to add the illusion of height.    To increase your height, it is important that your blood is oxygenated as blood provides nourishment to your bones. Regular breathing will also purify your blood. There are three phases to breathing:  1. Inhaling - take in air into your body through the nose  2. Retaining - hold your breath inside your body  3. Exhaling - blow out air from your body through the mouth    It is during deep sleep that growth hormone does its job of thickening and lengthening your bones. So appropriate sleeping time (not the longer, the better) and correct sleeping posture is very important for your body to grow. Sleep is defined as a natural periodic state of rest for the mind and body, in which the eyes usually close and consciousness is completely or partially lost, so that there is a decrease in bodily movement and responsiveness to external stimuli.    During deep sleep, growth hormone produced by your pituitary gland is released into your blood stream and travel through your body and causes the thickening and lengthening of your bones. Therefore, you should achieve "deep level" sleep on a daily basis in order to coordinate your affords of exercises and proper diet. The following are some helpful tips on how to easily achieve deep level sleep.    Sleep in a comfortable and firm mattress.  Sleep in a room that is dark, quiet and fresh smelling.  Sleep with clean, soft, and comfortable clothes.  Keep your hands and feet warm. Scientific studies have shown that warm hands and feet will help induce REM (rapid eye movement) deep sleep. Cold hands and feet will keep you from deep sleep.  Drink a big glass of water before going to bed and when you wake up; this will help clean out your system.  Practice total relaxation and deep breathing for a few minutes before you go to bed.  Relax from head to toe. Close your eyes and relax every part of your body.  Maintain a habit of sleeping at the same time everyday, including weekends.  Sleep on your back with a flat pillow under your knees. This will align your spine properly and prevent any back aches caused by sleeping in a bent position.    Undoubtedly, the quality, quantity, and type of food we eat affect our height, growth, and health. We cannot emphasize enough how important your food intake is in determining how much growth you can possibly obtain. The types of food you eat will either improve or decrease your growth potential.  After careful consideration and research, the daily content of protein, carbohydrates, fats and water can be achieved if the following items were taken regularly.    Carrots Fish Liver  Egg Yolk Beef Red Meat  Milk Cheese Apples  Green Vegetables Potatoes Nuts  Yellow Vegetables Almonds Bananas  Peanuts Chicken Beans  Peas Salt 6-8 glasses of water per day    If you eat a lot of peanut butter, your height will not necessarily stop. Neither does masturbation stop height.  What might stop you from growing is smoking, drugs, alcohol, lack of sleep, stress, digestive problems, or lack of exercise.    Height Growth Products : The first approved natural product for height increase is Super-Growth http://www.super-growth.com or http://www.super-growth.org with this product it is possible to gain additional height growth even after puberty.  I love Super-Growth . I've been using it as a height booster for several months now This stuff is great, It is rare for a product to live up to its advertised hype. But this one actually does. It Works as advertised. Also, this specific product advertises improved joint health. I injured my knee and could find no relief, but after 3 weeks of using the Super-Growth I no longer have knee pain. I have tried other height gaining products, but I have seen the best results from this product. My height continues to grow .|`|tpvJAKj1aa	it all depends but remember short people are more intellagent than tall people i/m short and i should no
Wz9tSKTaaa	He should certainly get that checked by an ENT specialist, but I wouldn't panic. I'm no medic, but I used to get fairly bad nosebleeds at the slightest thing and that lasted for years and needed sealing twice.    The problem was always just that that the healing process got disturbed if I sneezed, rubbed my nose, laughed too much.... anything really within hours, days or weeks. There was a minor infection at some point, but nothing more. It's now been a number of years since I had any trouble, thank God.    Still, it is one of those things that should always be checked, just in case.|`|4r0Cyih5aa	I used to get alot of nose bleeds back in my day. We just stood on our heads, try that. It worked for my brother Markie.|`|Q2bGrCeKaa	I suggest you take him to the hospital or tell your parents to take him to the hospital......Hope he is ok.
MhpccWpmaa	If your hymen is broke, which it very well could be either from the masturbating or using tampons, no you will not bleed the first time you have sex
9pLdhuBnaa	One thing that could be of help with the back problem especially sleeping is something like a body pillow (an example only), or even to put a pillow between your knees which can help ease some of the pressure (another example only).    However, I would recommend seeing your doctor for further evaluation of the situation to see what they say.
Exv4AjqCaa	You have to realise that you're doing it because of ideas you've created/decided about yourself.    So you need to sort out how you think about yourself, until you change how you think you'll find it very hard to overcome these urges.    You have a boyfriend, you have friends, you have parents who care for you clearly....whatever negative thoughts you're having about yourself arent as important (or true) as you think they are. You are just to used to believing them to think otherwise. Thats what therapy is designed to help you with, help you get to the root of why you're thinking so negatively about things. Depression is all about being unable to rationally think through how things actually are in reality, all people who are depressed see is the negative & worry/panic about it.    Makes them feel down about themselves when other people looking in cannot see the issue.    Get out of that habit and you'll stop getting the urges to do it get sick.|`|0gONjiSzaa	It's very, very important that you get help as soon as you can, before your behavior becomes more extreme. It's really good that you've recognized that your behavior is unhealthy and that you want to do something about it. I know that you said you hated therapy when you had to do it, and I did too, until I found my current psychiatrist. You have a much better chance of getting better if you combine therapy with medication. Try taking a look at what psychiatrists/psychologists are covered by your insurance plan, and go to as many as you have to until you find one that works for you. I went through three total, and the first two were miserable. It was worth it in the end, if I hadn't found the psychiatrist I see now, I don't know if I'd be here to answer your question. Please get yourself as much help as you can and don't give up.|`|ua2E4WK4aa	Eat food, dont puke, rinse repeat.|`|C88VCkvnaa	It might be a good idea to talk to someone - your parents especially - even if you don't want them to have the burden. I am sure they would rather know, so they can help you.  I am not sure I can help much, but try to think about how much happier you are when you are not doing these things to yourself. You are damaging your body and just think how much healthier you could be. :) It's great you are looking to change your lifestyle.  Please get help. It's something you are going to need help with. I don't want to see you hurt your body more! =[  I wish you the best of luck and wish I could be of more help. Be strong!!! |`|0b9zOBnOaa	I know that you might not want to get your boyfriend involved in it, but if you are planning on staying with him it is going to be something that he will have to deal with eventually.  And if you don't want to tell your parents you are going to need some kind of support.    I am a 24 year old guy and have never had an eating disorder, but almost every girl that I know has had one at a different time in her life.  I dated a girl for several years who was anorexic for quite a while before we started dating.  I had to check up on her a lot.  I asked her almost daily what she ate, though I had to trust she was being honest with me.  Here's the bottom line.  I don't know how to help you with your body issues.  I wish that there was an easy way to do it.  Something that might help, especially from your boyfriend, is to tell him that you need him to compliment you on your body more.  I promise guys do not care as much as you think they do.  I have dated girls that were barely more than bones to girls that weighed almost what I do.  Don't let our initial shallowness beat you down.  You need someone that loves you for you, and you need to hear that from them.  It's not going to be easy to get over this, but if you want to, you can do it.  I know that I only have a guys perspective on this, but I hope it helps a little.|`|dkR5XPwpaa	Hi hun,   i have suffered from bulimia and was hospitalized for it which was absolutely horrible! But in the end i got over my bulimia. I tried to eat a little bit of food every day, only a little to start off with so that it wasn't even worth sicking up. Then i gradually built it up, even though i hated hospital and therapy it did help, i didn't want to die. You have to be careful though because eating disorders are a vicious cycle. Although i have got over bulimia i am now suffering from anorexia which i have also been hospitalized for. One thing that really did help was my family and friends, they are helping me over come my anorexia at the moment. I am sure they would rather help you than let you die, it is so much easier to over come eating disorders with people around you to help you.    if you want any more help/ information or just someone to talk to email me xxx
rVi0UEWlaa	Cardio workout I believe in pure cardio  that will help you lose the most weight. you don;t want to weight train that builds muscle. try doing it an hour a day or more if you can. Use a treadmill if you have access to one if not its a great investment if your serious about losing the weight. Good luck
MhpccWpmaa	The baby being dead inside of you (while possible in extremely rare cases, but highly unlikely) wouldn't make you miss your period. and if you had a ectopic pregnancy you would be 5 months by now and would've experienced the consequences already. You should go to your local planned parenthood regarding your concerns with not getting your period, they don't tell your parents and probably won't charge you anything
5Qo6OWNzaa	depends really. Free weights are good for building biceps,, cable machines are good also. Each offers unique benifits. But elastic bands? do they give you enough resistance? If so, then they should be fine..they will keep a constant load on the muscles
jym7hecUaa	You'll have plenty of time to grow more. Height also depends on your parents' heights. Although, this is not always the case. I am 5'9 but my both my parents are shorter than me by at least 4-5 inches. I frequently play basketball so that's how I figured to have grown this tall. According to your parents' heights, you'll be fine.    Sports such as basketball will probably help you grow taller.  If you plan on lifting weights when you're in high school, do not do exercises such as squats or anything that might stunt your growth.  Do not take any unnecessary vitamins.  Drink milk.|`|ua2E4WK4aa	wear some funky funk, disco platform shoes! Bring it back please I want to feel normal again.|`|I2gat01haa	you cant     "get" taller.|`|bqcySzS5aa	Hun, there`s nothing you can do really.  Wait for puberty and you`ll have a growth spurt.  If your parents are tall you`ll probably inherit it.  Just wait and see.   Also, im unaware if you are a boy or girl, but if you are a girl,   wear heals !  They make you tall and look more slender :)
5Qo6OWNzaa	try the phase 1 of Atkins at www.atkins.com   and yes, its free.     Or you could do any number of things.. losing 10 lbs is not the hardest thing..keeping it off is.. which requires a change of attitude about eating and excercising.

M3pRAe7Vaa	It is fine for it to be brown.  All this means is that the blood is older (rather than fresher), and has been sitting for a bit before flowing out.  There is nothing wrong with this; the color can change depending on your cycle.  Mine is often brown.|`|AA11318156	Typically darker blood as you've described would indicate that your body is getting rid of "old" blood. This happens frequently to a lot of women, especially at the very beginning of their periods. Some of it depends on whether the cycles are regular or irregular.
AA11309238	If you are naturally slender, you will start your period later.  A woman's body needs to be at 18% body fat before it can support a pregnancy, so it won't start a period before that.  Many women athletes will reduce their body fat to the point that they no longer have a period.  Be patient.|`|WQK42mRsaa	It probably isnt because you are under wait, although, 100lbs is the wait most people get thier period.|`|40xNl5gnaa	No no, as long as yuu are underweight but healthy then yuu are fine.

qxedFynqaa	Moisturise, all that stuff on your face removes oils need for your face so your skin becomes dry. Try just using it once a day before you have a shower. Make sure your face it very hot, it will open the dirty pores. Now rub on the stuff and wash off with warm water this closes your face back up. Pat your face with a towel. If your face is still very dry apply a touch of moisturiser. I would recommend nivea for men, very good product.|`|ie3dYKYZaa	That alwayas happens to me. Come down....all you have to do is use Aveeno lotion. Got it?
M3pRAe7Vaa	I would definitely advise talking to a counselor, as you mentioned this helped previously.  I too have had experience with depression and have seasonal depression (more depressed in colder, darker months).  Speaking from past experience, talking with a counselor can help pinpoint why you are one person at school, and are able to become a happier, outgoing version of yourself when you are with family and friends.  Talking, certain exercises, and maybe even medication can help.      The move and new school likely precipitated a change in mood, and talking with someone about this is important for your well-being and happiness.  You can fix this, and feel better.  I was once there, and it is possible to get help and get back to feeling better.    Best of luck to you.|`|NOvJgnE6aa	I know exactly how you feel... im going through the same thing right now... i've been really depressed since i was like 12 and now ill be 17 next month... i just moved and it seems like at this new school things are just not right and im a lot more reserved... however when im with family and friends im more open and out there... i really don't have an answer but i just wanted 2 let you know that you aren't alone out there...

k5X78IM3aa	Low fat diet...It is not really a diet but a healthy way of eating that eliminates the bad fats.  The doctor gave it to me when I was having problems with my gall bladder.  There is a list of foods to avoid & those that are okay to eat.  There are foods in all food groups to eat & to avoid so your food intake is well balanced.  As I said, my doctor gave me mine, but I did a google for it the other day & it was there.  Be sure to get the one for GI problems & not Nutra-System etc.  You don't have to spend any extra money for special foods.  It works.    Also, I like to eat veggie dogs & boca burgers...no fat.  With mustard & catsup & all the trimmings they really are pretty good.  I lost weight w/o even trying
iAv9P3HTaa	When you hit 10% body fat it will start to show.Avoid fatty junks too.    here are the best exercises for hard core abs:    Side Bends    * Holding a dumbbell in you right hand, stand with feet shoulder width apart and your knees slightly bent.  * Place your left hand behind your head and slowly bend sideways to your right lowering the dumbbell down to your knee.  * Return to an upright position and repeat for the desired number of reps.    Medicine Ball Sit Ups    * Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor.  * Hold a medicine ball (choose a 5 pound ball to begin) to your chest and have a partner stand at your feet (not on them).  * Push your lower back into the floor flattening the arch and hold.  * As you curl up throw the ball to your partner. Hold the crunch as your partner catches the ball and throws it back to you.  * Catch the ball and slowly return to the start position.  * Tip: Don't sit right the way up as you wait for the return pass. Your shoulders should be no more than 6 inches off the floor.    Weighted Curls with Medicine Ball    * Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor.  * Hold a medicine ball (or weight plate) to your chest (start with 5 pounds).  * Push your lower back into the floor flattening the arch and hold.  * Curl up just enough to lift both your shoulders off the floor a few inches.  * Hold for a count of 2 and return to the start position.    Cable Crunch    * This exercise requires a triceps pushdown machine with a rope attachment.  * Knee down in font of the machine holding the rope just above your head.  * Slowly crunch down to your right knee and hold for 2 seconds as you breathe out.  * Return to the start position slowly and repeat to the left knee.    Abdominal Exercise Guidelines  Perform several (3-5) abdominal exercises 3-5 times a week. Start with exercises and repetitions that are comfortable for your fitness level and as you improve increase the number of repetitions. You do not need to do all the exercises; simply select those that work well for you and vary your routine over the months.|`|d46e5bc188a340e7729a4bfdfb5ed476aa	fat loss is a slow process, could take up to six months if you know what you are doing|`|8sH0rlswaa	Just keep at what you are doing, vary your ab exercises, and you'll see progress in time.  It's not gonna happen over night.  It's gonna take some time and work, but you will get there.
5Qo6OWNzaa	first you have to define a lot of protein.     Many people slam atkins or southbeach and say eating a "high protein" diet is bad but cant tell you what high protein means.     For someone working out with weights, its suggested to eat 1 to 2 grams of protein per pound of lean body mass. for me thats about 250 grams a day. Trust me, its hard to get that much protein.. I rarely do and I eat a lot of chicken, drink a protein shake etc etc.     So defining "lot of protein" is important

BzGnuWs4aa	Social anxiety stems from childhood experiences, usually negative ones. Were you picked on in school? Did your parents ridicule you?  Did you move a lot when you were a child? Those are just examples that can bring on social anxiety in later years.    I would first see a dr. about medication. There are all kinds of anti anxiety meds out there but they can make you drowsy. Also, cognitive therapy is a GREAT approach to treat changes in your life, anxiety, depression, etc.    If you can access a therapist, you will be given tools and resources that will give you sound, dependable coping skills to help you get through.    If you ever need to talk, please feel free to email me. I've been there, done that.    Peace and joy be with you~|`|siTibEIGaa	Try talking to a counselor. They will help you decide if you need meds, or just talk therapy. Social anxiety is common among people new to a country, or even if you just move to another city. Try finding others where your from, even if it's just on the internet and talk with them about your anxieties. You are most definitely not alone.|`|glynFK9haa	Me too!  I hate the feeling.  I don't take medicine, but I do try to talk to people about my problems.  I think I am starting to overcome it, though, slowly but surely.

A hiccup is an unintentional contraction of your diaphragm  the muscle that separates your chest from your abdomen and plays an important role in breathing. This contraction makes your vocal cords close very briefly, which produces the sound of a hiccup.     Acute or transient hiccups  Although there's often no clear cause for a bout of hiccups, some factors that can trigger acute or transient hiccups include:     Eating spicy food. Spicy food may cause irritation to the nerves that control normal contractions of your diaphragm.   Eating a large meal, drinking carbonated beverages or swallowing air. These can cause your stomach to expand (distend), which pushes up your diaphragm, making hiccups more likely.   Drinking alcohol. Alcohol can relax your diaphragm and vocal cords, making it easier for other factors to trigger hiccups.   Sudden temperature changes. A quick change in temperature, either inside or outside your body, such as drinking hot liquids and then cold liquids or your shower water switching suddenly from hot to cold, can set off hiccups.   Tobacco use. Tobacco use may irritate the nerves that controls the diaphragm (phrenic nerves), causing hiccups.   Sudden excitement or emotional stress. Although it's not clear why stress or sudden excitement causes hiccups, it may be due to the effect being startled has on one of the nerves involved in the hiccup reflex (vagus nerves).   Persistent and intractable hiccups  Rarely, hiccups may be the result of an underlying medical condition. When this is the case, the hiccups usually last longer than 48 hours. More than 100 causes of persistent and intractable hiccups have been identified. They are generally grouped into the following categories:     Nerve damage or irritation. Damage or irritation of one of your vagus nerves or phrenic nerves is the most common cause of persistent or intractable hiccups.     The vagus nerve serves as a communication pathway between your brain and organs, such as your heart, lungs and intestines. There's one vagus nerve on each side of your body. These nerves run from your brainstem through your neck and down to your chest and abdomen. The phrenic nerve controls movement of your diaphragm. There's one phrenic nerve on each side of your body. The phrenic nerves run from your brainstem through your neck and down to your diaphragm.     Examples of conditions that may damage or irritate these nerves include a foreign body (often a hair) in your ear, a tumor, cyst or goiter in your neck or chest, gastroesophageal reflux, or an abscess on your diaphragm.     Central nervous system disorders. A tumor or infection in your central nervous system, or damage to your central nervous system as a result of trauma, can release your body's normal control of the hiccup reflex.   Metabolic disorders. Metabolic disorders that may cause hiccups include a condition that interferes with the ability of your kidneys to keep wastes from building to toxic levels (uremia) and a condition that results in less than the normal levels of carbon dioxide in your blood (hypocapnia).   Surgery. General anesthesia and complications following surgery can cause intractable hiccups.   Mental or emotional triggers. Anxiety, stress and excitement have been associated with some cases of persistent or intractable hiccups.|`|LUNx8Llzaa	From a physical standpoint, hiccupshiccupshiccups are caused by uncontrolled spasms of the diaphragm. Each spasm causes quick intake of breath, which makes a hiccup. The phrenic nerve, which controls the diaphragm, is directly responsible for these spasms. From a physiological standpoint, the medical community has not reached a consensus on why hiccupshiccupshiccups occur. One thing doctors agree on is that hiccupshiccupshiccups do not seem to serve any useful purpose.    There are many factors that can cause a person to have the hiccupshiccupshiccups.

TCpTlCTRaa	You can read about the common and rare types of childhood hair loss in these articles.   common- http://www.vzbotanicals.com/articlecommo... rare- http://www.vzbotanicals.com/articlechild...    I am wondering if the blond thin hair could possibly be vellus hair. If so it would be thin and wispy like newborn baby hair. I hope you find the articles helpful|`|9pLdhuBnaa	Hormone imbalances (an example only but there are some that do affect children) can cause the hair to be thin.    The only way to know for sure is to have her see her Pediatrician for further evaluation of the situation.
4kQxbFZTaa	dude....      You don't want to stop eating...    I am a current kick boxer and former national rugby player.  I started pumping weights around your age and I had the same problem.  Don't start on supplements yet, but if you have to, take a multi vitamin and buy whey protein powder.  Pretty cheap.  To gain weight you have to kick your eating into high gear.  More than you ever thought you could eat.  But not crap.  You have to eat healthy, and often.  at least six meals a day.  You will notice a huge difference in weight and muscle retention in the next couple of years, but in the meantime focus on eating these foods...:    Lots of dairy    1% chocolate milk  cottage cheese  yogurt  veggies  cheese  chicken breasts  steak  stay away from pork if you can  nuts are very good for both nutrition and protein (peanuts, cashews, ETC)    Eat all this stuff and lots of it.  The more you eat, the more your stomach will stretch and the more you'll be able to pack away.  BUT BE CARE FULL!!!!! continue to exercises.  Lots of kids stuff like soccer, volleyball, and all the outdoor activities that you love.  Stay active or you will just get fat and the girls wont like ya ;)    When you hit 15 or 16 start working out.  But listen bud, you have to know what your doing.  Start reading magazines like mens health and flex.  NEVER USE STEROIDS!!!! your nuts will fall off.  Well not really but there bad news guy.      I put on weight because I read as much about nutrition and proper exercises as I could.  Education will give you the edge so read stuff online.  in the next few years your going to start putting on muscle regardless.  But read and ask people who know as much as you can.  STAY AWAY FROM STEROIDS!!!!!! your still so young and just because your a little smaller now it doesn't mean you'll always be like that.  Different people grow at different speeds.  Stay active, eat your butt off!  You'll be just fine guy.  You have lots of years of growing ahead.  I recommend martial arts.  Sometime being small can be an advantage.  Try karate!  mostly, enjoy your life bud.  Your still young.  Keep smiling.
hoWPKcztaa	No,  Its not bad at all,  You're period can be irreular for a year to even two years,  if you want ot know more about this you can visit  www.beinggirl.com|`|iPcO4kmKaa	mine is like tht ALL THE TIME. its fine nothings rong. just the discharge mixin with...well ya|`|0WOvEw2Daa	it will level out after a couple years. my first year i only had my period like every three months, its weird but it will even out with time =]

Rest every other day, and if you do all of that, it is definately possible to lose 30 lbs in 3 months.|`|m0XWJfJdaa	wii fit|`|vGiXqViXaa	you can do it with will power|`|4TNJcyaqaa	go for it!! just rember to stay committed to your routines. good luck :)|`|c25xSVutaa	no
MyV9qm99aa	Like es said, its a FAD and you should go on a diet the old fashion way. Eat tons of vegetables, fruits, protein if you want muscle, work out 1 hour a day or more, and you know the drill cut the junk food 5 days a week.    GOD BLESS :P|`|uu0UN29vaa	Theres really a lot out there. There are so many products out there so what I end up doing is starting with the less expensive and trying out a few different trials and measuring the results.The site is pretty good at http://www.pure-acai-berry.saverightnow.... visit and see if it interests you, I did.|`|XvGQq1gBaa	Acai really is a solid dietary supplement that works well in conjunction with a proper diet and exercise for weight loss. However like most supplements, you really have to be careful about the quality provided by the supplier.|`|jlHz0Fg1aa	any kind of diet that's named is likely unhealthy in many respects.  nothing replaces physical exercise and cutting unneccesary calories.|`|S730dpLfaa	WARNING! Read this blog before trying Acai Berry!  http://acaiberryscams.wordpress.com/2008...  Thanks to this blog, it helped me a lot to choose the best.  Hope this helps :-)|`|cb2NxPERaa	It's just another FAD diet. The word FAD should tell you about it's quality (bad). They will just come and go, don't mind them.

l1vzoQ1uaa	wow, im the same way. i dont think thats bad but you should really try to eat a little more so that you get a good meal.
HSUfe3m7aa	It's easy and totally safe. I got my period at 8. Get the slim/teen ones for size. They are very comfortable, the key is to relax when inserting it.|`|n6zqu8gKaa	It is safe to use tampons if you have been having your period for a couple of years.sorry but i dont have a website for you to go to.|`|PbFnmOqpaa	ok the first thing you have to do is tell your coach that u have your period he/she will understand    Next, DO NOT USE TAMPONS AT YOUR AGE!!          ( SOMETIMES IT CAN BREAK YOUR HYGEN IF U PUT THEM WAY INTO DEEP)    AND FINNALY, DONT WORRY JUST USE PADS, IF U HAVE HEAVY FLOW US ALWAYS MAXI NIGHT AND IF ITS NORMAL USE ALWAYS INFINITY HOPED I HELPED :)|`|Kc0SO4Kwaa	Save the tampons for when your older. I'm 21, have been using pads since I was 11; doing fine with them. I also get heavy periods.|`|WX8nVNRNaa	You can wear tampons. You  wear whatever you feel comfortable wearing. If you plan on swimming then tampons are a must; pads will not do.|`|iPcO4kmKaa	yea its fine. just make sure u put it in rite b4 u dive in. ask yo mom or sis or some1 to help    if u got no 1 then read the box VERY VERY careful my mom said i wasnt allowed to use them so i had 2 teach myself...and the 1st time i did it rong....and swam....|`|iFTa9FqZaa	Yes its safe to use tampons. I first used them 6 months after I got my period. You can just use tampons for swimming. Tampons are not bad and don't be afraid, just takes practice. Remember to relax when inserting and taking it out.    Good luck :)|`|SFoMSEpgaa	I think i would want my child to avoid tampons at your age...But its safe, but might be uncomfortable...You can get out of pe in school if your swimming and on your period, have your mom call it in for you.|`|pn88K8UXaa	you can use a tampon. its easy. i suggest using one if you don't want to/cant skip swimming. plus after a while, they are a LOT more comfortable. here are a few tips and articles to read. i wont type it all on here, its more productive to just give you these :D    good luck.|`|lYr1zmQeaa	that's what tampons are for! get some next time you have your period and as long as you don't leave them in for more than 7-8 hours or use a super when you don't need to it's completely safe. don't worry it's no big deal and all the other girls have to do the same thing. just read the instructions in the box and you'll be fine. using slender the first few times you use them will make it easier until you get used to them. don't worry about it so much :)|`|7waA9vGeaa	Tampons are perfectly safe, just make sure you change them every few hours. (And yes, you can wear it when you go swimming and no one will ever know.) If you don't know how to use one, make sure you ask your mom, or sister, or a close female adult. If none of these options work, follow the directions on the pamphlet found in most tampon boxes.
YEd9Q5KZaa	Yes I knew. I ain't scared to eat.|`|a12cbnR4aa	Your body will use your muscle for energy if it does not have food for energy.    Edit: I was just adding more detail. I wish more girls were aware of how much eating disorders really affect their bodies in a terrible way. They may be skinny, but is in unatractive to be in the hospital because of other illnesses these disorders cause. There are healthier ways to become fit and lose weight. Thanks for bringing up this topic.|`|S1jddreQaa	hun, i wasn't going to stop eating before i read this, and i'm still not.|`|rV9eqW0yaa	It is very scary isn't it? I knew someone who had anorexia. She started losing her hair and her teeth. There are a lot of consequences... Thanks for sharing about the long term ones.|`|lRdF1aUUaa	Hah at Spencer. :) That was good.   To answer your question; yes, I knew. Not eating is dangerous. :) Food is fuel, people!|`|ca8edf2a66d3abd8c642d9f347f4b0b0aa	I knew that. I enjoy food too much to stop eating. Oh, and I am at my perfect weight.
Y3dFm6uGaa	Hello!      Years ago, my 7 year daughter broke her arm from a fall out of a tree on Easter Sunday.  When the doctor came into the room, I asked if she could play the violin?  The doctor replied, "Of course, she will be able to play the violin."  I said, "Well, she could not play it before!"  My daughter was so embarrassed that she was ready to walk out of the Emergency Room!      Since she was a small child who was injured, the E.R. folks were looking for a child abuse angle.  Everyone who came into the treatment room asked my daughter what had happened.  (She fell out of a tree.)  The E.R. folks always asked me to leave the room before asking what happened.  I heard her reply, (quite loudly) "I've answered this question five times!  Isn't somebody writing it down!"    I hope your recovery goes quickly.  It sucks to be in pain!|`|nEVoabeSaa	So if you throw a baseball at a window what happens? You have a point of impact, chip, dent and then several cracks coming out from the impact site. Best of Luck|`|hoDin3UYaa	There's nothing to be sad about. Your elbow will heal fine after awhile  and then you will be as good as new.
KWqZe31Haa	Your body is naturally developing, it isn't uncommon to lose weight (or gain weight) during your teenage years. In order to gain weight, the basic rule is to take in more calories than you burn. So you should combine a good diet with an exercise regimen. Eat lots of protein-rich foods like eggs, fish, red meat, etc. and plan a weekly workout schedule. Make sure you incorporate cardio into weight training otherwise you will see bulkiness occurring, and you want to get that defined, leaned look. Drink plenty of water on top of this, to stay hydrated, and you should be gaining weight in no time. Be patient as well, everyone's body is different. You already have the muscles, it's up to you what you make them to be. -Fig    P.S when I was in high school, a lot of the guys on the football team would take creatine supplements in order to gain muscle mass. Look it up. The stuff works.  And for a good website http://www.gainingweight.info/|`|48846255239e6cfd4e8b805cbae9c844aa	carbs and protein, lift heavy weights.|`|ROAS5EGLaa	If your talking about gaining muscle, eat 5-6 small meals a day and about 18 calories per pounds you weight which would be around 2700 calories. On the days you don't workout cut back to around 2300-2400 calories. Each meal should include some protein and carbs. Get your protein from chicken, fish, lean turkey, eggs, and protein powders if you can afford them. Get your carbs from brown rice, oatmeal, sweet potatoes. Make sure to get some good fats in your diet from fish, almonds, and avocados. Your meal after your workout and breakfast should be the biggest meals of the day. Workout 4 days a week as follows. Monday-chest and triceps. Tuesday- back and biceps. Wednesday rest. Thursday-legs and calves. Friday- shoulders and traps. Saturday and Sunday rest. Try to get about 4 exercises per body part at about 8-12 reps each. Rest 1 minute between sets. Make sure you get the compound movements done. They are most important. Squats, bench press, deadlifts... etc. Good luck!|`|xthjbUg2aa	EAT LIKE HELL!!!|`|hzbUVANiaa	A lot of pasta !!!!! :D|`|vR7fzZkXaa	well you could try drinking weight gain drinks and working out to build muscle|`|C6kfzKA1aa	I am 15 and in the same situation just lke you just eat protien shakes and  maybe eat some carbohydrates or fiber foods and keep workin out|`|n7KCez59aa	Hi !    Increasing your intake of junk foods and greasy foods is not a good way to gain weight.   Healthy fats include omega-3 essential fatty acids sources like tuna, salmon, flax, and walnuts. Good sources of protein include lean meats, fish, poultry, nuts, seeds and legumes. Healthy carbohydrate sources include fruits, vegetables and whole grains.   Exercise is also important for healthy weight gain. Resistance training exercises such as lifting weights will help to increase your muscle size. Aerobic exercises such as running and stationary bicycling are better for fat loss and excessive aerobic training may cause you to lose more weight.     Tools to Help You Gain Weight :  Add healthy calories to breakfast with an extra slice of whole-grain toast and peanut butter.   Mid-morning and afternoon snacks should be nutritious, not junk. Trail mixes contain healthy nuts, dried fruits and can add healthy calories to your diet.   Don't add calories to your meals by choosing unhealthy fried foods such as french fries, chicken nuggets and fish sticks. Choose healthy foods such as baked potatoes, baked chicken and fish, just make your portions a bit bigger.   Keep your meals balanced. One meal should have a healthy protein source such as fish, low fat meat, chicken or legumes plus two or three servings of vegetables. Green vegetables add lots of vitamins and phytonutrients while starchy potatoes and corn add extra calories.   Drink healthy beverages such as milk and fruit juices to add calories. Don't choose sugary sodas, which only add calories and no nutrition.   Design a weight training program with help from About.com's exercise site .
SUdzZ3jtaa	Lol dude once ur body gets used to the fiber bars your little farting incident will go away. Your body will get use to it and learn how to digest it or it could be that you don't eat a lot of fiber and your body was like wtf! to much and it pushed out everything bad out of ur stomach which is good.|`|BqO6Gko2aa	By all means stay away from open flames.All kidding aside start by slowly adding fibre to your diet until your body can adjust.Things should come up smelling like roses in no time.

If you want to lose weight you need a proper diet.  If you want more info on that check out this free book: http://www.dietspy.com/simple-weight-los...|`|dX3Zlp2Jaa	The pattern for losing weight is not difficult - consume less and move more often - the difficulties surface when we actually try to put that into practice! There are a lot of temptations in the real world aren't there?! The sole method that definitely delivered for me was wu-yi tea, it can be viewed in the resource box below, they have a few free trials left, it has been reported in Reader's Digest and CNN. I melted away 20 pounds, it definitely does produce results!

Wu0XyNspaa	They are interesting-tasting, haha.  The first time I tried them, I didn't like them.  But I got used to the taste and like them now.    They are like a mix between cranberry and cherry, but have a slight bitter taste to it.  But it's not really recognized as bitter because it's also sweet.  It definitely tastes exotic.  Also, they are dried, I don't believe you can find fresh goji berries, unless you purchase the juice.  But they're chewy, and wrinkled and look like dried cranberries.|`|1FWYRIchaa	OK,I keep your advises as god friends  you see www.GoodbyeToFriends.com/ind
p6pESvHDaa	Don't waste the money or the time on thermo suits.  You don't burn off any extra fat, just water weight.  That water weight will come back within days.  The extra sweating will drain your body of energy that could be used to burn off calories and fat.    Not to mention the health issue of dehydrating, which could cost you a trip to the ER.|`|oJltJdENaa	ur going to gain that 5lbs bk once u drink or eat something. Sweating is only helps alittle. Its not going to make u lose any real fat. So Dont Wear a thermo suit. Ah Yeah like i said sweating doesnt make u lose weight....
HATHuVjnaa	the best thing for burning fat is no hands down running. You nat leasteast twenty minutes of aerobic exercise(such as running) in order to burn fat. Try starting off at that and everyday try running for longer and longer. Its not so much how fast u run but as long as you keep your heart above 140 BPM (beats per minute) alot of treadmills have built in pulse meters. That will help u get rid of fat. To tone muscles try and keep ur workouts at a low weight with alot of reps. This will give u lean tone nice looking muscle.
IvfEtJi8aa	If you make it at home, then you should know... I think. Otherwise look at the label?    Just in general, I would say Pesto sauce. It has more oil (though its usually olive oil) but also has considerably less sugar and salt than most store bought tomato sauces.     tomatoes are good antioxidants though. They're both pretty good, it just depends on what's been put in them.
AA10648436	Why would you care if people notice or not.  If you gain weight eventually people would notice, but if you feel that you want to gain weight and thing you would be happier if you did then who cares what others think?|`|8SRjELNBaa	Wear baggy clothes|`|xDSScmkDaa	No im sorry hun, well i guess it depends how much. Less then 3 or 4 pounds isnt noticeable.
NSayh9jDaa	It may be infected so you might want to run it under water and wash it with soap. If it's your first time...veins may not be used to it and was 'shocked in a way'. I know even when I give blood that spot or vein will be tender for 3-4 days afterwards. If pain persists more than 2 days you may want to see a doctor.|`|TkPJYlaMaa	Might wanna get that checked.....
KOYC3XkJaa	Sometimes nonstick gauze has 2 sides, a "right" and a "wrong". Only one of the sides has the nonstick coating. Is that possibly the problem in your case?   If that's not it: how much ointment are you applying? If you're putting on too little, it won't make a difference in the gauze sticking or not. How long is the gauze on for? The longer it's on, the more likely it is to end up sticking. Try changing it twice a day instead of once.   If it still sticks, the only way to get it off is soaking in warm water or running warm water over it. Once the bandage is saturated with water, it will start dissolving the crust of fluids and softening up any scabs that are causing the gauze to stick. Then work your way around the border of the gauze, gently pulling it off until you come to where it's still sticking. Soak again. Work around the bandage again. Etc. After a while you should have the whole bandage off with minimal pain. Good luck.|`|oO4TUkVkaa	vasoline to the edge of the non stick gauze that touches the wound.  This will keep the gauze moist so it won't stick.|`|lu4lqwnPaa	Place the wounded area through running water. You can also soak them in a tub or in a basin.   Let it stay there for a minute.   While the wounded area is under the water, try to GENTLY remove the gauze pad.  Most likely, it's still hard to remove.   Soak it in the warm water again for a minute. Or two.   Try to remove again.   By this time, the sides of the pad is getting loose.   Repeat steps until the pad is loose enough for you to pull it out.   Be careful for removing a stuck pad from a wound might hurt.   Clean the wound, apply antibiotic, and put a new gauze pad.  Wear loose clothing the next time you put on the pad.    Do not sleep on the wound, or this will push the gauze pad onto the wound as it heals, and the wound will heal onto the gauze pad. Thats about it.

AA12218624	antioxidants to put it simply are cancer fighters. they help protect the cells in your body from becoming damaged or oxidized as it's called. examples of antioxidants include vitamins A, C, and E (which can all be found in fruits and vegetables), and polyphenols (which are found in teas; green tea is your best bet). but in addition to cancer, antioxidants have been found to protect against all sorts of diseases including aging. you really can't go wrong with consuming more antioxidants.|`|Vho4qkBjaa	They are basically vitamins (C, E, Melatonin...) they are either essential, gained through proper diet, or are synthesized by our bodies. They assist in vital function and combat oxidative stress.|`|0XYt2JhGaa	Antioxidants are substances or nutrients in our foods which can prevent or slow the oxidative damage to our body. When our body cells use oxygen, they naturally produce free radicals (by-products) which can cause damage. Antioxidants act as "free radical scavengers" and hence prevent and repair damage done by these free radicals.  Health problems such as heart disease, macular degeneration, diabetes, cancer etc are all contributed by oxidative damage. Indeed, a recent study conducted by researchers from London found that 5 servings of fruits and vegetables reduce the risk of stroke by 25 percent. Antioxidants may also enhance immune defense and therefore lower the risk of cancer and infection.
UZJ7wVc8aa	If you want to lose weight, you need to two things: eat less and exercise more. Weight gain happens when you create a calorie surplus (eat more than you burn). Your body takes the excess calories and converts them to fat which get stored around your stomach, arms and thighs. The longer you remain in a calorie surplus, the more weight you'll gain. To lose that weight, you need to do the opposite. You need to create a calorie deficit (start eating less than you burn).     Your first step is to figure out how many calories you burn on a daily basis. This calculator will help you out http://calorieneedscalculator.com The number you get from this tool is what your body burns on a daily basis. To lose weight, simply eat less. It sounds a lot easier than it is but making small changes helps you adjust to a new lifestyle. Don't think of this as a diet, think of it as a new life. Instead of eating foods high in sugars, white flour and saturated fat, go with fruits, vegetables, whole wheats, fish, lean meats, nuts and beans. In addition to eating less, you also need to exercise more. Start off at 1-2 times per week and work your way up to 3-5 times per week.    Don't make all of these changes at once or you won't be able to properly adjust to them. Generally, eating healthier foods will decrease your calorie intake. Compare a doughnut to an apple and you'll see that healthy foods are lower in calories.

97oxJ0B8aa	That doesn't sound fat.  It depends on your muscle to fat ratio though.  Stop eating after 9 pm.  Replace all drinks with water.  Those two easy tips alone can make a huge difference.|`|HVKfuhp3aa	I gotta say your a little on the chubby side. I'm about 150-155 and I'm 3 inches taller and I have a bit of meat on my bones.   Eat healthy and exercise;obvious answer but ya know..   Try and eat 5-6 "meals" a day. Not quite a meal, but not quite a snack. It' healthier than eating 3 full course meals everyday. Instead of soda, pick an alternative, like milk or juice.   When you eat, eat a little slower. This gives the body more time to process the food so you will feel fuller and eat less. Sometimes, when your bored, chew a piece of gum. People tend to want to eat when they're bored, and I found chewing gum helps curve it.  To lose weight, you need to do cardio workouts. If you live in a warmer place, try riding your bike. If a colder place, run on the treadmill or up and down the stairs. Remember to do a warm up then stretch before fully working out and drink water.   Sit-ups/pushups/etc. is not a good way to burn fat, but it does tone your body. After your cardio, you should do some strength exercises.  Good luck, hope I helped. :D|`|rsAqrbsgaa	Ye.  I'm 5'8 and 152.

UZJ7wVc8aa	Gaining weight is a two step process. I'm assuming that you want to gain the good kind of weight - muscle, not fat in which case you have to eat more and lift weights or engage in some sort of strength training routine.    The most important rule to remember if you want to gain weight is to eat more calories than you burn. Only by doing this can your body use the excess energy to build muscle. If you eat less than you burn, there is no way to gain weight, it's as simple as that. Your first step is to figure out how many calories your body burns per day. Use this calculator http://calorieneedscalculator.com  to get an estimate. Now eat more than you burn and you're on your way to gaining muscle.    Gaining weight is as simple as eat more than you burn but if you want to gain muscle, you also need to exercise. If you just ate more without lifting weights, you'd just gain fat and become unhealthy and overweight. When you lift weights (or participate in any strength training) you're actually causing some damage to your muscles.     When you rest, your body uses those extra calories to repair and rebuild the muscles. When this process is complete, the muscle is stronger and a bit bigger than it was before. You obviously won't notice a difference right away, but over time you will find yourself becoming stronger and bigger.    You need to keep your diet clean to gain the right kind of weight. Stay away from sugary and simple carb foods such as candy, foods made with white flour, soda and other junk. These foods will promote fat storage, something you don't need. Stick to foods made from whole wheat flour, oats, brown rice, lean sources of protein (chicken, some cuts of beef, fish), nuts, beans, legumes and protein shakes - yum yum. If you need more details, go to the Guide to Gaining Muscle -  http://straighthealth.com/pages/guides/g...|`|KjF0p72naa	Keep eating that protein. Go for healthy portions and three meals a day with a snack between each. Try not to eat lots of junk but don't be afraid of the healthy fat in a good meal.  Lifting weights is great. My very thin bro hit the gym every day (or at least 6 days a week) and started to have muscle instead of just bone under his skin. He stopped after while bc he got lazy and is now back to what he doesn't like about himself so it can be done but you GOTTA stick with it!|`|Q5eUUbB4aa	Heres my routine    Chest and Bies    Benchpress  3x20    Incline Benchpress  3x20    Flys  3x20    Preacher curls  3x20    Standing curls  3x20 (20 in each arm)    Standing 2 hand curls- 3x20    Back    Wide grip pulldowns- 3x20    Narrow grip pulldowns- 3x20    Rowing machine- 3x20    Pullups- 3x as many as you can    Bent over rows  3x20 (20 each arm)    Shrugs  3x20    Legs    Lungs  3x20    Squats - 3x20    Leg Press - 3x20    Calf Raises - 3x20    Quad machine - 3x20    Hamstring machine - 3x20    Shoulders and Tris    Stading arm raises - 3x20    Seated dumbbell military press- 3x20    Seated horizontal arm raises- 3x20    Skull crushers  3x20    Behind head triceps raises  3x20    Triceps pull downs  3x20    Do these 4 days throught the week, then when your back to the first one instead of doing everything x20 go heavier and just do x6 this shocks your body so you never get use to anything, Then the next week go back to x20 and so on do your own abs/cardio routine after the exercises iv listed.
l4WEwTWwaa	That is very unhealthy and you should consult a doctor to see if you have a high metabolism (your body burns calories faster than it should causing you to lose more weight than you should). Or it could just be a part of your diet. Do you eat a balanced diet? If your tests come up negative for any health conditions that can be affecting your weight, consult a nutritionist about your diet.

4YqBHfkkaa	Try the paleolithic diet.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleolithic...    It's not only good for losing weight, but is also best for optimal health in general.

And carbs don't ever make you full. They just make you hungrier. If you eat more fruits and veggies, your body won't be craving it anymore. Cause all your body needs when it's "hungry" is nutrients, which are in fruits and veggies!
zI8zr7g4aa	the easiest way to do this is by cutting out breads and sugar.  go to atkins.com...which shows you this plan.  After not eating bread and sugar for so long, you body goes into something called kitosis.  This is your body's fat burning mode.  if your body does not have carbs to burn it will turn to your bodily fat to burn. at this point you will lose weight quickly, but it is still healthy because you are eating, lean meats, protein, vegetables, fish, nuts, and seeds.|`|TeoTd5gNaa	WALKING

This may not be 10 lbs but it may help u fit into the dress easier.
vEGkSHMsaa	1.) Most cereals that claim they are healthy really aren't. A good alternative is oatmeal. Get the plain oatmeal and add some fruit in there. Or you can get the pre-packaged one and mix 1/2 of the sugary stuff with the plain stuff (thats what I do).     Having visible abs has very little to do with doing abdominal exercises, and a whole lot to do with how much body fat you have. Doing lots of ab exercises is irrelevant if your abs are covered in a layer of fat. To get abs, you need to get your body fat down with diet and exercise. And ab exercises wont make fat over your belly go away, either. Abdominal exercises rarely make a difference in how you look, though the can be beneficial for other reasons.    Jumping rope is GREAT cardio (the best in my opinion) Keep doing it. Your legs will get use to it. Try adding in different variations of it (double overs, criss crossing, jogging in place, etc...)    Make sure your diet is in check. It probably is, but just in case heres a couple general rules:    First, the obvious stuff: fast food and soda.  As in, cut that stuff out.  Most fast food has little nutritional value (soda has ZERO). Just get rid of it. You can have it every now and then, but it shouldnt be a part of your diet more than 2 times a week.    Your dietary staples should include:    Lean animal protein sources, including but not limited to:    -Most turkey and chicken in general, especially if it is skinless.  Turkey and chicken breasts especially.  Contrary to dumb internet rumors, going to the deli counter to have them slice up a roasted or smoked turkey breast for you is also fine.    -Ground turkey, chicken, beef or pork that is >90% lean    -Virtually all forms of fish, even the fattier fishes are very good for you.  Canned fish is still often packed in oil, however, which should be avoided.    -Whole eggs.  The unhealthiness of whole eggs is a myth; contrary to past assumptions, they have no impact on heart disease at all.|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	Doesn't anyone realise that those overly processed breakfast cereals are full of preservatives and wreak havoc on your digestion????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    Have homemade muesli or porridge, you can add fruit, nuts, raisins, honey, yoghurt .... or have some wholegrain or wholewheat toast with a boiled or poached egg and some fruit.     If you are sensitive to wheat - and many people are but they don't realise it - try bread that's made of rye and/or spelt flour.     A good guide is to eat a king's breakfast, a farmer's lunch, and a pauper's dinner. I personally like the 5 small meals a day diet, because I'm never hungry and it speeds up my metabolism.|`|8SRjELNBaa	Haha, im in the same position as you.. but male!  Cereal is good, but depending on what it is, it might have a lot of sugar.  Sugar's which you are already getting by carbohydrates.  It's like more energy with the added calories :(    For breakfast, what i think you might want to eat are egg whites, chicken tenders and oatmeal (try to add as little unhealthy things to your oatmeal as possible).  1 egg white has 17 calories, 1/2 cup of oatmeal is 150 calories, and a small chicken tender is just 50!    Oatmeal will sit in your gut like a paste, it's amazing. Strongly suggest it.  Plus it's got carbs which will give you your energy for the day without any extra sugar calories, if you can stay away from the sugar. By the time your breakfast digests & you begin to feel hungry, it's time for lunch.  No snacking inbetween    The bottom abs will show through with leg lifts.  Sit on the end of a bench with a 10lb free-weight in between your legs & do 3 sets of 15.  They really suck, i hate them, but it's "mind over matter".    Another good ab workout is when you lay on your back and pretend your riding a bike, I'm not sure what it's called exactly, but i think you get the general idea.    Jumping rope is amazing.  It's one of the few exercises which requires an immense amount of concentration.  I bet you calves & shoulders were a little sore in the morning? Boxers do a lot of jumping rope for coordination & it's one of the most physically intensive activity. So if they do it, it should be great for everyday people.    Good luck! Hope i've helped!

It may not happen right away, but you will eventually become really sensitive to hot/cold temps. and get more and more cavities. Aside from that, your mom is trippin. You should be a runway model! Seriously though, don't listen to her. Just march to the beat of your own drum and don't let her meaningless words bring you down! :)

Youre not eating the food! 200 calories is not healthy at all.|`|uuHDQr1paa	Uh...no.  You have to "swallow" to binge eat.  You are what is known as a binge "chewer".  That's far creepier in my book.|`|NNmDDo39aa	EAT MORE!! dont starve yourself!!!!! and no it isnt binge eating but you shouldnt be doing that!!!  i think you should get yourself to the dr because i think you might have a eating disorder|`|LlMS9NsSaa	Binge? Sounds like your aren't consuming too much food but not eating enough. Not enough calories.|`|HbmHRiwLaa	Ana,    yes.. you know it's an eating disorder.. i have a problem too.  I binge and then don't eat for a while.    you probably need help, or just someone to talk to...     google: ana's secret obsession|`|o4tblEZaaa	Well, sort of. If you cannot stop, and aren't really eating at all most of the time, I think this may be a problem. Maybe you should consider just eating healthy in the first place, rather than eating junk and eating too much, and just spitting it out. Your body needs the nutrition, and you should take care of your body, because it's the only one you've got.|`|2NnZ5yCtaa	200 calories is way too little, as a normal intake for adults is 2,000 calories. I don't think what you do is an eating disorder, but you might want to try just swallowing end eating less instead of eating more and spitting it out.|`|1FTFCtaNaa	way too little. you need to eat more. youre still getting starch and stuff from chewing so kind of it is binging|`|Vxy7fV5jaa	Its not binge eating because your not actually consuming anything.    But yes that is somewhat of an eating disorderm and 200 calories is wayyyyy to few!|`|l3MED8Itaa	Chewing and spitting out is a form of anorexia|`|EkZDP3Oyaa	That is an eating disorder, it's called the chew spit syndrome, and I'm not even kidding you.  And that is way too little calories to be eating, you should be eating like 1,200 a day.|`|yqI6Nfpfaa	Adults usually need around 2000 calories a day. Also, just chewing then spitting out isn't even eating. And it's gross. Just EAT, it's awesome!|`|AA11334468	No you would be bulemic if you gobbled everything down and then induced vomiting|`|hat60KYXaa	i don't know how old you are but you need AT LEAST 1,500 calories a day to be healthy.  chewing and then spitting something is just a strange way to be anorexic. get help!|`|Q2DY4Mimaa	that's not healthy...  I hope you mean 2000  An average person should be consuming at least 2000! That's only 10% that you're eating. I recommend contacting your family doctor or try talking to your parents.  Yes that is a eating disorder.|`|5UlD5mVpaa	200 calories is way too little; 2000 is what most people need.  So I'm going to have to go with "yes" it is an eating disorder, or at least a poorly managed diet.|`|WN6tWLdYaa	that is horrible. its not really binge eating if you chew it and never swallow but its not healthy either. you should really stop that because that is basically heading down the road to anorexia.|`|fgu3ihZ4aa	yes thats an eating disorder, i think it was called chew and spit.. i saw it on the tyra show once. thats way too little, just eat healthy and eat the food.  i dont know what your going through personally, but my bestfried is recovering from anorexia.  theres day programs you can go to at hospitals, theres eating disorder annonomus (i cant spell sorry)  just try to get yourself some help, talk to people, because this is the start of somthing very dangerious.|`|361f8be8c14edc074d91a2eaebcb5b15aa	It isn't binge "eating" but I know there is a psychological condition associated with excessive chewing.  It also applies to those who bite their nails, or chew their own hair or skin but do not eat it - and those who do.    It doesn't sound like you've anything to worry about, though.  We tend to get very worried about these little things which are often just habits or a sign of nevous energy - I'm a little prone to it myself.  Ask your doc if you're really concerned.|`|dlgQCSocaa	Binge eating if when you eat a lot at one time - like binge drinking.  At certain times you eat a large quanity of food.  Chewing food than spitting it out is an eating disorder known as buliema.  You only eat 200 calories a day??  200 calories is not nearly enough!! Most people need at least 1200 - 2000 calories a day.  If you cannot stop this behaviour, I suggest you talk to someone you trust to get some help.  Good luck.|`|1227NWVzaa	umm it kinda gross but do  like 250 cal to help u|`|9uorn5Qyaa	No, binge eating is eating A LOT in one period of time.    200 cals???? Woww.....for me thats like impossible! But yes, that is wayyyyy too little! It depends on how much you weigh. But you should be eating at least 1,000-1,500 calories a day.|`|fmr98EBtaa	I don't know what the term for it is, but considering that 2,000 calories a day is considered the average, then you seem to be eating much too little. By eating so little you are putting yourself at risk for malnutrition, among other things. You should also note that when you eat so little, your metabolism will slow down, slowing the weight loss effects you are hoping for. Weight loss isn't a one time deal, it requires a lifestyle change if you want to lose it and keep it off. The way you are going about this is not healthy. I would suggest that you talk to a therapist or dietitian in your area who can help you with this. The website listed below may be helpful.|`|n68tCJ7zaa	yes, this is an eating disorder  it's not binge eating because you aren't eating anything    even for active women, you should be eating at least 1200-1500 calories. anything less than 800 is putting your body in starvation mode which isn't actually burning fat.  you aren't helping yourself losing weight by not eating, you are actually just deteriorating your health. so any "weight loss" you might see is actually your body killing itself.|`|1l7o0Ixkaa	yes omg if u r tryin to diet u need to eat at leat like 1000 clas just so u hav enough energy. god like get some counseling or something|`|lH2UOet1aa	Not only is that too little, that's dangerously unhealthy.  In my opinion, your situation could very well be considered an eating disorder. I would advise talking to your doctor, don't let this go on any longer.    When you chew food, there is an enzyme in the saliva that breaks down starches and sugars into smaller sugars that the body can absorb and use. But obviously, this will not cause you to gain any weight. You could almost say you have a disorder leading up to anorexia.     Please get this checked out.|`|XBXY91YYaa	Umm yes, that is a common method of some people suffering from eating disorders. It might be found under the category of Eating Disorders not Specified.  This can be a very addicting method, I know from first hand experience. I started chewing and spitting about a year ago, and its very hard to avoid, because you know that you aren't actually consuming the calories in the food. I still have yet to completely break myself of the habit, because it is so convenient. Just know, that this can lead to alot of decaying of you teeth depending upon how you chew and spit the food. If you chew the food in your mouth repeatedly, the saliva can wear the enamel off you teeth. Other ways are holding the food in your throat but not swallowing it, so that the food isnt rehashed in your mouth.  You will find more about this on the Internet, it might not be considered big next to Anorexia or Bulimia, but it is associated with these disorders.
5TM9P8tsaa	*I have had carpal tunnel in both wrist. I did the injections for several years threw an ortho. When the injections stop working  I had the surgery. I have never regretted it. Try the injections and wrist supports first. Always go with the non evasive procedure first and surgery last. If you do opt for surgery, you will not regret it.|`|3yvuMkzTaa	I was in am accident, & lost the use of my right are. I have to do EVERYTHING with only my left hand. After a few years the pain became very bad. I finally had the carpal tunnel surgery. Afterwords the difference was incredible. I had the surgery over 8 years ago, & have never had a problem since!!!
xqQO81Omaa	I totally agree with you.|`|KJgOAntNaa	Because very few people actually care about health. I care about it, but most find appearance to be more important.
FCWq1v6oaa	Aww, it sucks, I know.  I have anger management issues and it's hard to deal with.  I did a report on it, because I needed some ways to deal with anger and tame it.  Now, I'm about the same age as you.  At early ages is the best time to start doing something about it.      First, I want you to think back to when all your anger started building up.  Violence that takes place in your house can be stressful, and can build up anger.  If anything happens that is dangerous, tell someone that can help, don't let it continue.  Moving to a new school and getting bullied can make you angry to.  Some signs are very irritable and crabby, tired and restless, excited and wired, paranoid, nervous, strong feeling toward minor problems, confused and concentrating becomes harder, doubting self ability, and smiling less the usual.     Here's how to help.  Get a rubber band that fits around your wrist.  When you feel urges to become violent, snap the rubber band.  Snap it once or twice to snap you out of it and distract you.  Another good way is get a journal!  Write your feelings and also write letters that aren't the best things to say to people face to face.  Walk away from the scene before you flip.  Sit down, cool off, and come back to maturely deal with the situation.  You can ten deep breathes from your gut, not your chest.  It will calm you and help you deal better.  Another one is yoga, yoga, yoga.  It may not be for you, but if it is, do it.  It helps you connect to your feelings and think things through.      I don't recommend anger management classes for your age.  If it comes down to it, you may need to, but if those help, don't do it.      Please, email me anytime for anything else.  I have MANY more tips I can share with you.  Take care.|`|c71316f440c7c102ff8ab9c606b89e49aa	its your hormones.    just take a breath and remember that your the bigger person.  people verbally attack others cause they themselves are insecure.  just laugh it off and tell them to piss off|`|eb603a32531b733c208d6a3685da0228aa	See if you can get in to see your school counselor.  They do have ways to help you learn to control and manage your temper, and can actually teach them to you.  For what it's worth, it's not that unusual for a teen your age to feel this way sometimes.  And you are a step ahead of the game, because you recognize it's a problem and want to get back in control.  Your school counselor should be able to help you out with just a few meetings with you.  Don't feel bad, we all have to learn to control our tempers, just like we learn to control everything else we do.
7d16b3b33c15681f9d53425cac12ac67aa	Dear,     This is all normal well the discharge and all is normal. Some women have more pain then usual when it comes to their cycles. You should see an OB/GYN, if you're not comfortable with a guy checking you out, seeing that you are a virgin then you should go to a woman OB/GYN.     An Ovary tweak means that sometimes you have more pain with one Ovary than another.     I don't have the hurting breasts but I do have the cramps very very bad. And I am on Birth Control and I still have the cramps but not as bad as I did have before.. Yes, I am on Birth Control pills and I am LDS. They are used to control cramps, and to regulate your cycle and I am on it for both.  It's not always used for what it says it does. Anyway hope this helps.    EDIT: For short term relief you should take some Advil. Sometimes I also use a heating pad for the cramps as well. The heat feels really good when you're crampy.|`|6f8ZKDJ4aa	You should see a doctor before something serious happens.|`|sEFmjAJkaa	YOU Don't  ask a Peditriiciain (Young Kids Dr.)  about these things......you go to a Woman's Doctor.........|`|4xL9vqpjaa	I wish i could help you... but i have no idea.  i don't think that's normal... hazel?  brown?  uh... well the same is kind of happening to me now at the end of my period but i'm not quite comforted either.  maybe it is normal... maybe it's not.  I hope it is!  when i get my period, my cramps don't hurt... they kill!  it's like a sharp throbbing pain.  Sorry i couldn't help... but i thought maybe it would make you feel better if you knew you weren't the only one!|`|HyRGxu4Qaa	Get on birth control it helps your period, a lot.|`|AA11146445	Okay sweetie my advice about the brownish discharge is to go to your doctor and tell them how long its been that color,keep like a little journal and take notes of when it occurs so that when you do go see your doctor about it she can tell you if it's normal or not    As for the backpains and cramps i would ask your doctor about taking "birth control"..i know what your thinking..birth control is only used if your having sex but that isn't the case..birth control is also used to balance you menstrual cycle and hormones. My sister takes birth control because she used to have the symptoms you describes and the pills really did make a difference for her. So talk to your mom about it and set up an appointment with your doctor.    I hope i helped hun    good luck.  you can come to me if you have anymore questions.|`|zRit8suXaa	EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW TMI!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|v7W8yBP7aa	no actually it is all perfectly normal, you have nothing to be worried about, the same things happened to me and it sucks but it will get better in time just be patient and dont worry you'll be okay! feel better, good luck! i hope this helps =)|`|PGJKLZCVaa	I would talk to someone at a clinic.. there are phone numbers to call.. and also birth control  will help with having cramps and heavy periods.|`|6iuZEUhzaa	as a doctor, seems like an ovary "tweek" (doctor's term)  i suggest you see a doctor its nothing serious though|`|QrSFskUpaa	It is normal that you feel pain and have cramps, headaches, and chest pain. Every girl go through that during their first period. Even older we still feel pain because our menstrual periods. But if you feel that it is too much go see another doctor. Maybe the pill will help you but you're still young though.|`|glYQY52maa	i think thats normal your just irregular and your doctor said its normal too. but i thinks its weird how much you get it and the stuff you said happend so just tell your doctor if they could give you some pills to make it regular. my cousin takes pills for pregnant ladies and it helps alot i dont know wat their called so just ask your doctor.|`|nTQVQI6vaa	Everything your saying is completely normal, including the blood clot that came out (it happens to every girl during their heavy period days). When i first got my period at age 12 I had everything your explaining in your question. But one day I got a really sharp pain where I couldn't even walk and I got it checked out, only to find out that I had an ovarian cyst. Today I take birth control and my periods are a lot less painful. (and I'm a virgin..meaning You don't only take birth control to prevent pregnancy) so you should check with your mom and doctor about getting an ultrasound to see if you have a cyst...if you don't great....but still ask about birth control because it really does help regulate your periods and makes it way less painful.      I hope this helps
YjUyBWPEaa	Yes you should take another day off.  How come you didnt go to the doctor?  You honestly may need an antibiotic and wont get better without one.  For now, take a few pain medication pills such as Advil or Tylenol.  Take a hot bath and soak a while for the body aches.  Then go to bed.  First thing tomorrow call the doctor.  A cup of hot tea may help with the sore throat.|`|BOyMZQ76aa	Zicam!!!!!!!!!!|`|UsH20vSAaa	Hi,    You definitely need to go to the doctor.  You may have the flu, a upper respiratory infection, or sinus infection.   Any of these can be dangerous.  Ibuprofen I have found works best for inflammation and pain.

1a03fd470e002c088b333c229350271faa	1/2 cup of veggies or fruit typically constitutes a serving, except when it's a leafy vegetable like lettuce, in which case it's 1 cup for a serving.    I'm not sure about the Nutri-Grain bars, but often with most products, if it does make up a serving (or more) of a veggie or fruit, it will say it somewhere on the box or the wrapper (look closely, they don't usually make it big). I only noticed this a few months ago, but it's helpful!    EDIT: I was just reading an article today about unhealthy food and healthy alternatives, and it talks about Nutri-Grain bars - which are unhealthy and which are good and have real fruit - it made me think of your question right away so I came back to give you the link, check it out:    http://health.yahoo.com/experts/eatthis/...|`|108cbf465aba14d306cf8d0e8081f6e3aa	Only if you're able to suspend disbelief. Nutritionally speaking, the refined carbohydrate (i.e. sugar, white flour) content cancels out any benefit that can be derived from the iota of fruit in those.    Half a cup or 4 ounces is a serving of fruits/vegetables.|`|1l7o0Ixkaa	yes a half cup of fruit
wX3P9Tlcaa	i doubt it will help at this point,lazy eye usually is diagnosed early  in life while muscles in the eye are still growing ,at this stage in life surgery might be indicated. for some reason certain children favor 1 or the other eye and look through it almost exclusively ,the unused eye without stimulus starts to wander and at some point there is little or no vision is there anymore(untreated).then there is the eye patch. cover the favored eye and you force he child to look through the lazy eye. the muscles strengthen up and the child gets used to seeing through it ,several months of this and you can remove the patch,and no more problem.

There's lots that can be done to keep you feeling this way, and it's dangerous for you to feel so faint.  What happens if you're driving or walking home in the cold?

5Qo6OWNzaa	its a hard question to answer but I think you can expect to be "back in shape" in about 4 weeks. Personally, I find that with running, I usually can get back to where I left off in about 2 weeks.|`|3tnistZQaa	There's no definite answer for this. It depends on how good of a shape you were in before and how much worse you've gotten since then and how intensely, how frequently and how long you're going to do what you plan on doing.    If you work hard enough you could probably get back in shape within a month. But that means at least 1 - 2 hours of training at least 5 days a week.

R4dSJbtQaa	is a common medical condition in women in which endometrial cells are deposited in areas outside the uterine cavity. The uterine cavity is lined by endometrial cells, which are under the influence of female hormones. Endometrial cells deposited in areas outside the uterus (endometriosis) continue to be influenced by these hormonal changes and respond similarly as do those cells found inside the uterus. Symptoms often exacerbate in time with the menstrual cycle.    Endometriosis is typically seen during the reproductive years; it has been estimated that it occurs in roughly 5% to 10% of women.[1] Symptoms depend on the site of implantation. Its main but not universal symptom is pelvic pain in various manifestations. Endometriosis is a common finding in women with infertility.|`|QKGuNLb4aa	its when endometrin tissue grows in other places like the fallopian tubes or on your ovaries.

UsH20vSAaa	Hi,    It sounds very much like depression to me.  I would recommend going to a Dr.  even a general practitioner is better than nothing.  There are many things that can help with depression exercises being one of them.  I know I hate exercising too but it does help.  Even going to the park for a nice walk helps.  If you have a dog take them with you.  I have suffered from depression for many years and know exactly how you are feeling.  The best thing would be to find professional help and never let yourself get to a point where you are seriously considering suicide.  In my opinion it is a cowards way out.  Please feel free to contact me if you would like to talk.|`|1Tdkb8OGaa	Yes, you should go get help before you really hurt yourself.|`|KjzR1k1Kaa	Oh, honey, it's ok..

I would suggest you find an interest or job you can realistically pursue (work does wonders to keeping the mind busy! and you can get paid!) that way you would be occupied doing something constructive, so your brain can't focus on being depressed. you'll gain confidence as you advance in the area of work that you love!   perhaps talk to a therapist or doctor, a close friend, a family member, a neighbor; there are always people who care about you. i'm sure you are a beautiful and special person, but the most important thing is for you and only you to realize that. once you begin to gain confidence in yourself, youll get better at it.  And whatever you choose to do, please do NOT continue hurting yourself. that won't help anything, and it's just not good, right?!  Good luck with everything! I wish you the best of times ahead! :)|`|fNfeYuyVaa	Everything I've read about depression matches those symptoms, but i had seemingly close symptoms about a year ago and started physically harming myself, but when i went to the doctor they told me i may just be suffering from a lot of stress, and that the stress of possibly having depression was making it worse. my advice is to visit a doctor, although i really don't think it will help. after visiting my doctor i stopped thinking i might have depression, i started feeling better. i still am not that social, i have trust issues, and it's hard for me not to cry. i wish you luck because i know its really hard. visit your doctor and take his/her advice.  good luck,|`|5EFHyGVbaa	I recommend you check out this social networking community called LetsReflect.com.

Every single thing you just listed is a symptom of MDD (Major Depression Disorder).   1.) See a counselor, even ask your school counselor for help. (It seems lame but trust me, the school counselors are there for a reason)  2.) take a deep breath and ask your parents (or ask the counselor to ask your parents) if you can take anti-depressants. They could seriously help you.    If you ever DO want to talk to anybody, my name is Sarah and my email is FOBdevotee95@gmail.com. I've seen someone else through this and I might be able to help you. =) and remember, I'm completely, er... anonymous I guess. I can't tell anyone you don't want me to, you don't have to tell me anything you don't WANT to, you can tell me anything you DO want to, and I'm completely unjudgmental. =D

YgDO6sxAaa	maybe you have a high metabolism which means your body's digestive system gets rid of more fat than a normal person. it's not a bad thing though. you just have to work out to be fit and not skinny. working out could make you a little more fit if that's what you want. :)

jrc7V1Gqaa	Nicloe:)  I work in the medical field and I know how it is to lose a family member, it is time for you to understand that although a person may physically leave that as long as they are in your heart and mind they are never gone. As one of my Doc's told me after loosing a patient He told me "When the Good Lord has His arms rapped around them we need to know to let them go".It is a hard thing to learn but you can do it. If you let your Grandma know what you are feeling I am sure she will tell you that her Love is always with you so she is always with you. Respects to you and your Family|`|yegDdZfRaa	Hi Nicole - spend as much time as you can with your grandma and let her know how much you love her. Pray for her comfort and make sure she knows the Lord before she is ready to let go.    Do whatever you can to make her feel more comfortable and just be there for her, whether it is to fetch her a pillow or just sit by her side.    If you do all of these things, you will never have any regrets and all of your precious memories will stay in your heart as long as you live.    {Hugs}|`|8XigtCWGaa	Hold her hand and talk to her. Sing to her and keep her comfortable... tell her you love her.Hospice is a great place. Toward the end, they will keep her loaded with drugs so she will feel no pain and members of the family can sleep on a cot at their facility until the end.|`|799756bd4c88f2ce87a508802ca1e9cdaa	Cottage Cheese and Flax Oil Cures Cancer!     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSoddptWL...

Wtm9ynqjaa	It's a decent amount of exercise however i would not recommending using the treadmill because it normal only gives you endurance. It's better to go for a run somewhere outside like a track or trails, if it's cold hockey arena's work also they have stairs which are great way to build up your cardioid. Good luck :)|`|YQYMPGK3aa	it sounds like enough.    remember to keep your heart rate up constantly. (walk quickly)|`|pVqFwMVfaa	great excercise but if you want upper body muscle assuming ur a girl then you dont need it really|`|WwCBomTMaa	Yeah, that sounds like a great routine to lose weight. However, it won't do you any good if you go home and eat whatever you want. Make sure you are on a healthy diet as well. Lots of fruits, veggies, lean meats and whole grains. Good Luck!!|`|32E2SvPAaa	its hard to loose weight even with exercise. Try lifting weights and build muscle and muscles incinerate cals.|`|hJyBSjuXaa	yes
ijduNTgyaa	Ok for eating, dont eat junk...duh, thats easy a lot of people know that. Try to not eat a lot of salty things, it traps water in you and it doesnt help you lose weight. Drink lots and lots of water, stay away from slim fast/vitamin water/energy drinks, some might be good the energy drinks are horrible for you and water beats them all out for quality and its FREE! Water is the bodies oil. Drink more and youll feel great. Try to eat small but more portions of good food throughout the day, it speeds up your matabolism.     To burn fat, you need cardio and lots of it. Go running, biking, swimming, jump rope is pretty good and fun sometimes and rowing.     But if your serious about losing FAT you need to forget about your scale and just look at your body. Muscle weighs a lot more than fat so if you start working out and get discouraged because your gaining weight its because your getting toner, and thats a good thing!     Ok then, some good work outs for ya...These are gonna be good for ya because you dont even need a gym or any real equipment, just mostly dead weight exercises.    For the buns  Plie  Stand with feet slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, arms at sides, toes turned out.  Tuck tailbone under and contract glutes.  Lower body into a plie squat as low as you can go without allowing knees to creep past toes.  Simultaneously raise arms to shoulder height in front of body, palms down. Hold for 2 seconds, then return to starting position.  After 20 reps, pulse at the bottom for 20 seconds.    Hip-Lift Progression  This is an awesome way to relieve tension in your lower back and work your butt at the same time. (A cushy mat will keep your tailbone from crying afterward.)  Lie on your back with your arms at your sides with your knees bent and your feet on the floor.  Lift your hips toward the ceiling. Hold for 1 count, and then lower back down.  Repeat the lifts for 60 seconds, squeezing your glutes and hamstrings at the top of the range of motion. Be careful not to overarch your spine.  To make this exercise more difficult, extend one leg at the top of the lift. Keep your thighs parallel and hold the lifted position for about 5 seconds.  Keeping your hips up, place your foot back on the floor and then lower your hips.  Repeat this exercise for 30 seconds; switch sides and do the move for another 30 seconds on the other     Dumbbell Squats  A simple way to kick off even a quickie workout, these squats are powerful little moves. Over time, increase reps and dumbbell weight to amp them up.  Start with your feet shoulder-width apart and 8- to 10-pound dumbbells by your thighs.  Squat down as if you were going to sit in a chair, keeping your weight over your heels.  Squeeze your glutes as you return to the start position.  Do 15-20 reps.  As you continue, keep the weight in your heels, making sure your knees do not past forward of your toes.  For a bigger challenge, try it without the weights, jump explosively, and land in the squat position.    Legs  do lots of squats. also do leg lifts on your side and your back (lay on your back and SLOWLY lift you legs up and down, if it doesnt hurt, do it a lot slower. shoot for 25 lifts, if it doesnt hurt, go to 50)    arms  Bicep Exercises  Standing Barbell Curls   1. grab your weight with an underhand grip with feet shoulder width apart  2 . allow the weight to hang in front of you, keeping your elbows close to you at all times.   3. moving only your forearms bring the weight into your shoulders.  4. hold for about 5 seconds and then repeat.   Dumbbell Concentration Curls  1. sit on the end of a bench with your legs spread  2. reach down in between your legs and pick up a light weight with one hand.  3. place your elbow on your knee and make sure your arm is fully straight.  4. place your other hand on your other knee so the upper body has some support.  5. using your forearm only bring the weight to your shoulder and hold for a few seconds.   6. repeat and then switch arms  Triceps exercises  Lying Barbell Extentions  1. lie on a workout bench with feet shoulder length apart on each side.  2. grab the weight and hold it above your head with your arms straight.  3. using your forearms only, lower the weigh until it is about one inch above your forehead.  4.then push the weight back to starting position and then repeat.  Tricep Dumbbell Extensions  1. grab a light weight with one hand with feet shoulder length apart  2. lift the weight so your arms are straight above your head  3. slowly lower the weight behind your head  4. then slowing lift the weight again above your head until your in the starting position.  5. repeat for one set of 10 times and then do the same for the other arm.  Forearm exercises  Barbell Wrist Curls  1. grab a weight with your wrists facing down.   2. sit on a workout bench with your arms resting on your legs and your wrists hanging over the bench.   3. using your forearm strength, curl the weight using only your wrists  4. hold the weight
sQu3LLqtaa	Girls usually stop growing at 15 and often there is no further growth 2 or 3 years after your first period.    There are no healthy ways to stunt your growth but under eating is likely to stunt your growth and, of course, that is very unhealthy.    A bone X-ray can determine whether your growth plates are still open or already closed.  Once your growth plates are closed no further growth is possible.|`|ILUYVQ0naa	Well you could have the doc look and see how much more of your epiphyseal plates are left. That is usually a good indicator. I doubt you will have a problem unless your body produces too much growth hormone.
9l0GdKbbaa	Hi Dylan. That is a very good question. My best advise would be to ask a lawyer. Like 1-800-CALL-SAM    Hospitals have really good protection against something like this. I have been there recently myself. A doctor prescribed my dad a new blood pressure medication and it dropped his blood pressure so fast he had a stroke. I called around for legal help and nobody would help me because they don't want to get involved in malpractice accusations because it's too hard to prove the case and that it wasn't something HE did to himself... so they told me!!    Just call around and Good Luck !!
yY2Czxy2aa	As far as I can tell, there are no proven weight loss benefits from the acai berry, juice, or capsules.    It does seem to be a great supplement (I take it, but don't sell the stuff!) and is full of anti oxidents, which help prevent damage to your body. But that's what you should take it for, not weight loss or fat burning.     The acai berry itself is an amazing thing - has a lot of anti oxidents etc and is really good for you.    But there's nothing really to suggest in scientific terms that it helps with weight loss.     And there are a lot of scams out there, be careful where you buy it from!    I take it, and I think I feel healthier and better. But it's not some type of magic formula, sorry.|`|S730dpLfaa	WARNING! Read this blog before trying Acai Berry!  http://acaiberryscams.wordpress.com/2008...  Thanks to this blog, it helped me a lot to choose the best.  Hope this helps :-)|`|RC88KUXPaa	Hey there,    I haven't used Acai Burn, but I did use a similar product - Acai Berry Ultimate - and had good results with it.  I paired it with a colon cleanse product and lost about 40 pounds in 3 months.    If you're interested in learning more about how I did it, check out my blog at the address below.    Hope this helps!  Sara|`|5djYUeefaa	The acai burn definitely did not work for me. I started taking it on january 5th, and according to the website I would lose about 10-15 pounds by January 27th.  Well here it is a month later, and I have only lost about 3 pounds! I was drinking plenty of water and exercising 3-4 times a week, and I took the acai pill twice a day as the website stated to do, and nothing happened! I just cancelled my membership! The acai burn is definitely a waste a money and you're better off going to a health food store and purchasing the actual berries or just not using the product at all.
4oDfFoQFaa	I can't say I ever heard of using it in your bath, but you can buy Ginger tea and drink it.  This is really good for the flu or a cold.  I had a cold and then the flu and the ginger tea saved me.  Good for an upset tummy and also good for a cold.  I got mine a the health food store, but I have seen it in some the the big super-markets.  Hope you feel better real soon.|`|teeQmWsBaa	Would it be the same as food grade ginger? I have never heard of a ginger bath: a poster before me suggested ginger tea, which is common. I would suggest making a paste of ginger and rubbing it on your feet: then socks.
RVicFEyFaa	Do they have speed dating in Ireland? It's really popular in the States. It basically runs like this, a group of people show up for the date ( they age group before hand ). You have five minutes at a time w/each person to talk & decide if you want to go on a real date. It takes the pressure off of having all those pauses. It's fun really. You can't just smile & think of what to say or ask, your asking & answering but not over-speaking to each other, it reminded me of your post. It helps you on thriving skills. Your suggestions for yourself were good! I would also try & ground yourself for downtime. I donate my free time to an animal shelter, it more then makes up for the time spent between relationships. And fills that need of dependency, I put out instead to shelter dogs/cats more needy. I love looking up my favorite artists or actors or musicians on Wikipedia.com & knowing certain obscure history. I love to cook with fresh herbs, began growing Basil indoors w/a heat-sun lamp. When you loan out your soul to those less fortunate it can be a win/win. All the best
Id20HSTraa	This is just a shot in the dark, but hopefully it helps.    first of all, your nightmare IS scary!  I would do the same if I were to have a similar dream.    You may have a fear of something bad that happened in the past coming back to hurt you, like some bad thing your buried in the back of your mind coming back to haunt you and ruin your life now.  The cracked armoir, something that stored the bad memory or bad experience cracking open releasing your old fears.      Maybe you feel this is triggered by your family members no longer playing such a key role in your life?  Your sister was there for you back then when you were dealing with that old stuff (helping you pack it all away), but she's not there as much anymore.  maybe she's not actually dead, but it could be that you don't spend as much time with her or are not as close as you once was.  Then you feel that the old problems you had in the past will come back and hurt you because she's not there to support you?  It could be that it's not even your sister, but someone in your family you depended upon a lot but is not so much a part of your life anymore?    The door swinging are new fears and troubles that come to add to the old stuff you're dealing with.  You feel you can't control how these things come at you, they come "faster and faster" while you can do nothing to stop them.  These voices, maybe they're doubts you're feeling about going out into the world or moving on with your life beyond the troubled past. But at the same time you're trapped in a uncertain world tortured by your old demons.       You can't define the things problems that will come, and you can't deal with problems you had, so you feel yourself torn apart by something invisible to you.  It's something you know is there, but you cannot see, or perhaps do not want to see.      I'm not a psychologist so I can be totally wrong.  Please don't take it all too seriously, it's all just speculation.    Here's some real help:  Whenever I have a really bad dream, I take a few steps to deal with it:    1. Figure out what stress in my life is causing this problem, and talk to someone about it.  Usually I get nightmares from stress that I'm dealing with.  2. Exercise  3. In my dream, I tell myself that it's not real.  Tell yourself it's a dream and that it cannot hurt you.    4. I try really hard to think of a person I love or trust helping me.  Focus real hard on a good memory where you felt safe or a safe place.|`|AptLo5hPaa	it was just a dream    usually dreams are used to help sort out or deal with whats going on in real life. maybe ur stressed out or some thing. dreams help ur mind process the information in the day|`|AA10302340	In my opinion, dreams, and nightmares don't mean anything.      Did you by chance recently watch a scary movie, or recently think about the farmhouse?  (or perhaps both)      Even if not, I would just brush it off and forget about it.      Here is some information on nightmares.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nightmare    There are things called night terror's, but that is probably not what you had.

Ks6Ac9SSaa	I do not drink my water because it has sediments and farm chemicals  in it.  It's well water.  I have been drinking bottles water for about 20 years because of that.  I usually get it in gallon jugs from a filler machine at the store, though I do get the 20-24 ounce bottles for taking with me.    Dark yellow urine might be caused from certain medication or vitamins.  For the constipation eat more fiber such as fresh fruit and vegetables and oatmeal.  And/or take a fiber supplement with lots of water to bulk it up in your digestive tract.    So start eating healthier, drink only water and juices, no coffee or pop, get exercise which will also help your stools.
WlhKoxulaa	1st AND foremost>> be certain you have good health insurance, because if you have no insurance now and get diagnosed with Crohns or Colitis, you will find getting insurance is nearly impossible..     You might have Crohns Disease.   Check with your family doctor.  See if you can get a small bowel follow through, which is an xray of the bowels and digestive system, using barium to highlight any problems.  Don't mess with this as it can turn out to be serious..  If it isn't treated it WILL get Worse..  Take my word for this one.. I sure do know..
Y0j4N2x0aa	getting "nutrition" through another animal's fat or flesh is detrimental to the skin and health.  going green and natural from the earth with whole grains, fruits, veggies and beans is so much healthier.  it takes alot of time to digest and pass animal flesh.  the other stuff is so nutritious it just flows right through and your body is fueled to vitamin and mineral capacity:)|`|8oBawBYLaa	not eating meat is good for weight loss because you are reducing the intake of animal fat into your body.|`|RumoQkohaa	its healthy because its not a lot of fat and its eco friendly because cows fart a lot and shipping meat takes a lot of energy|`|FYXgfY1Vaa	or maybe because you don't like to eat animals.|`|PIUAUgCaaa	It helps you lose weight and eating veggies makes you have more energy.|`|dX3Zlp2Jaa	The pattern for losing weight is simple - eat less food and workout more often - the issues arise when we in reality try to put that into operation!

Women especially need to eat meat for heme iron or they can become anemic. Some plants contain protein but animal protein is the only protein that is absorbed quickly into the body.

AA11295695	Why were you having unprotected sex in the first place?  BC pills are only about 99% effective when taken CORRECTLY.  In your case, you were not taking them correctly.  You could be pregnant, if you are 48-72 past when you had unprotected sex, Plan B will not help.

oKwXjVolaa	You might have to start taking vitamins, because sometimes iron deficiency or other vitamin-related things can cause dizziness.  Are you on your period? That can cause dizziness. Is there a possibility you may be pregnant? That causes it too.  Just plain hormones can cause it as well, like if you're ovulating or PMSing.   There are so many things that cause random dizziness, and if it doesn't continue, there's nothing to worry about. If you ever pass out or it continues and gets worse, see a doctor.|`|pX4crBjgaa	That used to happen to me too, it was because I had really low blood pressure.

The dizziness means that, for some reason, you're not getting enough oxygena nd blood to your brain. If you take hot showers, the steam may be the problem, and if you're exercising so hard that you get out of breath, same thing.  I would sometimes get dizzy if I stood up quickly after sitting for a while, because all of my blood would suddenly rush down into my legs due to gravity!  But it's not really anything to worry about. go see your doctor; they can check your blood to see if your low on iron or anything else just in case, but otherwise, no worries.|`|sXeyRD9taa	Do you have low iron?

9iXGakohaa	People wouldn't say you were slim if you were fat. They just wouldn't say anything! Being in the recommended range of weight means you are skinny! Why would that mean people are lying to you? It is recommended because it is healthy to be fairly slim.     Since you've started exercising, the muscle under the belly fat is pushing it out, Making your waist expand as you noticed. However in a week or so all the fat will be steadily reduced so you are back to the size you were, or maybe even trimmer.|`|TNbhUSAIaa	It matters on your build.

qBkJAlQ1aa	headache everyday is nothing usual...  you must see a doctor..and he won't say its nothing........    He'll probably asks you....  1. onset, duration, precipitant causes, accompanying symptoms like nausea vmiting, blurring of visions, loss of consciousness or seizures, fever, nose bleeds, infections  2. he'll ask you to characterize the headache if gnawing, pounding, constricting etc,'  3. he'll ask you the location or is it all over or is does it transfer  4. he'll ask you what alleviates the pain asde from analgesics  5. he'll ask you if you're losing sleep, appetie changes, weight loss, history of head trauma, seizures, weakness, paralysis, and a lot more  then...  6. he'll do complete physical examination..........  7. he'll requests for lab work-ups...    Now, are you sure it happens daily, is it severe, does it get worse, does it impair your functioning?|`|sQu3LLqtaa	Perhaps your consumption of sugar and foods loaded with sugar is too high and you are getting sugar headaches.

I know it'll all be blurry, but see if you can't maneuver without them for at least an hour or so into the morning.     It could absolutely be just the glasses, or you may just be dehydrated. Try drinking more water throughout the day and see if that helps. Personally, if my heat is on too high in the morning, I too wake up with a headache and sever sinus problems. If you are experiencing any vision impairment, such as dizziness, see a doctor immediately. You could be experiencing migraines - and if that's the case, you should see the doc anyway for some medication.

nUu7tUiqaa	Whenever you stop taking pills, you will start a period. This is not like normal periods, as when you are on the pill you do not ovulate, making these periods basically useless. Continue to take the pill, it will not stop this period. Take your pills as you normally would and everything will work itself out by the end of the next pill pack.

That worked for me several times.|`|5nSMgYkiaa	tampons rock omg try them  or you can use pantyliners if you are rly scared  or toilet paper sometimes works..but not as well  just ask your mom to buy you some!!|`|AA10063292	tampons are easy   In the beginning it takes a couple tries.    You put it in until you only see the string and grab the plastic tube or cardboard and pull it out if its uncomfortable take it out and put the next one farther in.    If you dont wanna then put toilet paper a bunch in the way of a pad.|`|b8QAG31laa	use a wash cloth|`|JwdU9nVBaa	Tampons are definitely the best. And it depends how heavy you have it, for me a panty liner would not be enough, but you might be different. You could also just ask a friend to bring you a pad or something.|`|9cYqY6vWaa	Go to the nurse and get one from her. They give them for free at my school but you have to pay in some schools.     Or put a tampon in. Practice, practice, practice.     But panty liners will NOT be enough, even if you layer them.     Maybe ask your mom for a day off school until you get supplies? It might work!|`|9mMQxpSCaa	You could wear panty liners, and then you can put alot of toilet paper over, but changed the toilet paper alot because it gets weird after awhile.|`|9FC7vflwaa	I say you should work on trying to get a tampon in.  but if not.  double or triple up on panty liners and when you get to school, either go to the nurse and ask for one, or have a friend bring you one.

One time I ran out at a carnival, and I just put paper towel and toilet paper in my underwear to line it. Just change it often. It feels kind of gross, but it'll be okay. If you go to school tomorrow, I'm sure most other girls will have some pads. Or your school nurse. Good luck!|`|FpZYDsiJaa	If you have a light to medium flow, put on the panty liners then fold up about two squares of toilet paper. You should be good, but check on it alot, go to the bath room enuf as possible. I do that in emergences when im on my last pad, and i usually only have to change the toilet paper

DJDlGjbLaa	In all honesty, just using baby soap won't make the problem worse, but it won't get any better either. The best natural cure is to eat LOTS and LOTS of yogurt. Yogurt has active cultures that can combat and prevent yeast infections.    However, it does take longer than your standard course of treatment. My best advice is have your dr. call you in a prescription of diflucan. It is one pill and you start seeing results within one day.|`|xNkmK0SHaa	Well, you can safely use it, but it won't relieve symptoms for longer than 15 minutes and it won't cure a yeast infection.    You ask that you be given no "immature answers".  I wonder if you are mature enough to have given enough information about your condition.    I wonder how you are certain it is a yeast infection.  I wonder what activities may have predisposed  you to one.    There are now test kits that can be purchased that indicate whether or not one has a yeast problem.  They are not inexpensive. Then there are OTC remedies for treatment.  They are not always effective.    If you are sexually active you should be examined by a physician, preferably a gynecologist.|`|Qh2rc1DNaa	Soap will not cure the infection.  In fact, it could make it worse.  Yogurt is supposed to help cure a yeast infection...but the over the counter cures work too.|`|Zcx9JOGXaa	no it wont cure it.i heard yogurt work.|`|9pXiFQMwaa	Soap will not cure the yeast infection, and if its not an all natural soap or hypoallergenic it might actually irritate you and make the pain worse. What you need is Monistat 7 or 3, I haven't heard of anything else that actually works other than a long painful time. While you have the infection, you should use something like johnson& johnson's baby soap which won't hurt you down there!  Don't worry, many women including myself have used things like Monistat and had no bad side effects, only the positive one of having the infection go away!
l4WEwTWwaa	It's an ok workout but honestly I would suggest running for 20 minutes. You will burn three times the calories you would just using stairs for 30-90.|`|pCP3u5uaaa	Yeah, it is a good workout, but it can hurt yhour knees if you do it everyday for that long
zZ55CRulaa	I would really suggest that you visit bodybuilding.com. They are the best site on the web for workouts, training, and nutrition info. They also have a really great selection of supplements if your interested in that.|`|MK5Ddtiiaa	Crunches and staying away from fatty foods. Aw damn, I can't do it!
lEXTHOZPaa	Continue to swim and it is a good for belly.    Big belly is usually the biggest concern of those who are overweight, and they are keen to find out what is the best way to lose belly fat. In fact, reducing your belly fat is not a rocket science at all, and all it requires from you is to stick to the right exercise and diet.    Between the two, exercise is probably more important than diet. Some people did manage to lose substantial body weight with strict diet only, but their bellies are not tightened enough and are very prone to gain fat again once they return to normal diet. The correct type of exercise you need to take is called "interval" training, which means alternating different exercises at different intensities and duration.
WYztbMO2aa	eat PLENTY of greens (dark ones are best).  be active for atleast 2 hours a day.  and if you run, run for ATLEAST 20-25 minutes.  just eat healthy and in smaller portions.  good luck:)|`|D9JVpmDVaa	walk/jog for like an hour and do cardio atleast five times a week.  eat basically all organic things. just plane fruits and veggies and whatever meat replacement vegetarians use. that should work. good luck! :)

Even I'm wanting to lose 25-30 pounds (I'm 5'4, 140 pounds)  But it won't happen that fast.  It took time for you to gain it, it'll take time to lose it.|`|hafFbjm8aa	yeah right!! your so skinny. I'm five three and i weigh 148.

I've been doing it for about a month. I've lost about 10 pounds so far.|`|1TvtX9D3aa	your weight is in no way out of control. getting rid of more than 2-3lbs per week is dangerous.  there's one solution to losing weight in the long run: cardio exercise + good food. anything that gets your heart pumping for 20+ minutes per day should do the trick along with healthy food. yes, that means eat your veggies. i'm a college kid. i know how hard all this can be. just know you're worth it.|`|decWPAHkaa	You are 5'2 and 110lbs. What adult in their right mind would tell a child standing at 5'2 and weighing 110lbs that she needs to loose weight.. this is the most ridiculous thing I've heard all day. Your mom definitley needs help! 80 pounds is not cute!
9cIMbdBzaa	Well it depends on your metabolism and body type (ectomorph, mesomorph....etc). and how many calories you are burning. A safe estimate would be around 2500.
AA11865529	It is  normal for young people, but generally you grow out of it.    Could be a kind of ADD.    Perhaps you overindulge for too long and overdose on it.
6jXuUCdraa	your not used to being happy, it scares you. the only way you can escape it is by cutting.   i suggest writing down things that make you happy, and doing a few of those things daily untill you get used to being happy on a regular basis.

9cba094486c6e7ab49a59ac5ea44682faa	It would be far better for your husband to have a Vasectomy. Laparoscopic sterilisation can be very painful and risky.The procedure itself has a number of risks; there is the risk of anaesthetic itself, abdomen surgery is always a high risk procedure,post -operative pain because the peritoneum is entered and gas is pumped in, clot risk and there is always a risk of infection.    Many women suffer long terms effects of sterilisation which can include pelvic pain, problems with menstruation and many find that they later in life need a full hysterectomy.    In contrast, the vasectomy is a minor procedure with local anaesthetic and a few small incisions.|`|Rk46lIBwaa	In direct answer to your question, I don't really ever recommend female sterilisation.    It is a significant long term increase in period problems, pelvic pain and even hysterectomy in sterilised women. There is also the short term anaesthetic risk, and the surgical risks of entering the perineum.    In my view the only correct spelling of sterilisation is V-A-S-E-C-T-O-M-Y! A minor procedure, carried out under local anaesthetic in 20 minutes with the short term risk of bruising and no term implications. Besides it only seems fair as the female has really done most of the work as far as both contraception and childbirth is concerned. It is time the male took some responsibility!    (Well said Rhianna, but it is also imnportant that a man makes the same points!)|`|WnMrgSg4aa	No! your too young at the moment. Circumstances could change and you might decide you want a baby. You will feel a lot of regret if you do it and then decide you want children but cant have them!  Why not try a less permanent form of contraception for now?    And yes, your periods change, become irregular and some people experience symptoms of the menopause.    The decision is yours, hope you make the right one for you!|`|6qsocyK3aa	You need to think this over long and hard. How do you know you won't change your mind in, say, five years time when it's still perfectly possible to have children?    If it's truly what you want beyond any shadow of doubt good luck to you.    I imagine it does change a lot of things because it will probably change hormone levels.|`|pM9RWQM2aa	you can always get an IUD placed ( there are several types, lasting 5-10 years) and they are safe. studies have shown that women who have a hysterectomy at a young age regret that decision, which is why intrauterine devices are used for those who don't want children for some time. if you change your mind and want to have children, IUDs can be removed very easily. u should see you ob-gyn for more info on this.|`|MVVMCO7Paa	i would only do it if you really wont to,  & are certain you don't wont any more kids,  u would no wont to regret anything,
AEZ75dJ7aa	Get out the vaccum cleaner- use the hose part-COVER the end with panty hose and vaccum everywhere you may have dropped it.  Check the end frequently.  Do this after you check in your eye.

Go back to the optician, he might replace you one, since its a trial period. I don't think its still inside your eyes otherwise it would have be clear. If you have spare ones, you might have insert another one, making it 2, which I have done before, and that also blurry, Because it would be too powerful.|`|RZgByhoEaa	omg im so so srry ok well try calling the eye doctors office see if they help call the one where they prescribed the contact lens.

IeOeYOJ3aa	Try to reduce the number of processed foods you eat.  That's just crap. Try to eat more vegetable, fruits and whole grains. Drink more water, anything else is pretty much just filled with sugar and more sugar. Don't eat at fast food places.  If you want you could try reading "Fast Food Nation" by Eric Schlosser, it's disturbingly good! It also briefly touches on other types of processed foods and gives other possible suggestions to further read.|`|d8jH5lU1aa	Probably no junk food and more veggies and fruits ohh and H2O =]|`|5GIdz30eaa	You could try the, "eat this, not that", books to help you get started.  They are really helpful.  I was reading one the other day and it turns out turkey bacon is actually worse for you than regular bacon, contrary to popular belief.  Also when you are starting to eat healthier, it is always a good idea to pick the healthy foods you actually like and not just eat things you hate because they are healthy.

It is also a book.    Very informative.|`|70LIxqdxaa	Do what the firs answer told you to do.|`|zqlfqc8naa	hey, when i started to have a healthier diet i went for what was the best choice without pills or supplements. I drank water. I drank water everyday instead of sodas. I found that drinking water everyday and a lot of it will metabolize the fat stored inside your body and flush it away. So when you start drinking water...you will feel the need to go to the bathroom a  lot. That's good...since your body is detecting new water coming in, it can flush out the toxic water that have been stored in your belly all that time that causes that bloated look. Another thing you need to do is eat fruits, yogurt is good, and vegetables. Also, if you run for at least a mile everyday, you will become fit. I lost 10 pounds in 2 weeks by doing this.|`|O6LsFkE9aa	What worked for me was slowly WEENING myself off of bad foods and substituting calorie-free foods for calories ones, for example...  - on a sandwich, first take of the cheese, then slowly get rid of the mayo  (replace with mustard)  -when making tuna salad or sardine salad (which are great for losing weight by the way), USE mustard in place of mayo  -don't use extra salt  -don't drink soda (water ONLY)  -if you eat chicken take off the skin    those are just some examples of how you can eat healthier!!!    and eating pure things is much better for your body, processed stuff is harder for your body to break down (less stomach aches!!) lol     around thanksgiving time, i decided i needed to lose weight...i was about 5'6" and 205 lbs. what i did....    had egg whites wth loads of veggies, whole wheat wraps, whole wheat bread, salads, tomatoes, onions, garlic, fruits like grapefruit, strawberries, bananas, and also almonds, and clementines, tuna salads, etc.     also working out almost every day    barely over two months later i weigh just under 170 lbs....it is so worth the work|`|pMAqetBUaa	why don't you try to inquire in wikipedia.

At least, go to the doctor and have a physical and tell him your problem with over sleeping.  Good luck to you!  edit - I notice I said he "was" the same age as you.  It should read he is the same age as you, lol!  He got on medication for his thyroid problem and is doing fine.  He is very healthy and is going to college and working part time.|`|HmvGOCyqaa	It isn't that you are tired. It is that you are tired from sleeping so much. TIRED FROM BOREDOM.... You need to fix a time for sleep say go to bed and 12 and wake up at 9 after that do something else. Anything else but sleep. Do this for about a week or so, and by doing that your body will adapt to the 9 hour sleep routine. It seems to me, I might be wrong, that you have been doing this a lot, sleeping all day.... and so your body has adapted itself to sleeping so much... Try cutting it down. and you will be back to normal....

Your best answer will come from a doctor who could tell you most about your body...and if you don't have the time, WEB MD helps too.....look it up....  Hope you get better and get some sleep tonight!|`|pTbGI4sZaa	Sometimes sleeping too much will sap your energy even more.  It can be a vicious cycle.  As hard as it may be, you need to work to stay up and get moving.  Exercise can help - sounds backwards, but often physical exertion will increase your energy level.    On a side note, I would see your doctor and have them run a thyroid panel.  Many people are actually suffering from an underactive thyroid and don't know it at all.  That can cause a lack of energy, weight gain, and other issues - often misdiagnosed as depression, especially in teenagers.

ILVCgXcYaa	flu  Symptoms of influenza can start quite suddenly one to two days after infection. Usually the first symptoms are chills or a chilly sensation, but fever is also common early in the infection, with body temperatures as high as 39 C (approximately 103 F). Many people are so ill that they are confined to bed for several days, with aches and pains throughout their bodies, which are worse in their backs and legs. Symptoms of influenza may include:    Body aches, especially joints and throat   Coughing and sneezing   Extreme coldness and fever   Fatigue   Headache   Irritated watering eyes   Nasal congestion   Reddened eyes, skin (especially face), mouth, throat and nose   Abdominal pain (in children with influenza B)
z5JkgFOyaa	Only a doctor can tell for sure if you have a yeast infection by taking a swab and run some tests. Most of us can sometimes tell by the feel, look, and smell that you have a yeast infection. If your symptoms don't match this list, or you are confused or uncertain, go see your doctor if at all possible.    It feels like an intense itching, burning sensation, localized in your vagina and vulva. This itching is not always present, but can get really bad, so bad you can hardly walk, let alone sit still or concentrate on anything.    It looks like clumpy white stuff. Most medical descriptions compare the discharge to ricotta cheese, but it can range from thick and not clumpy to faintly yellow to thin and clear.     It smells like bread or beer. In fact, it smells pretty much exactly like yeast.    There are other types of infections that can sometimes infect your vagina and vulva and it's helpful to know the symptoms of all of them so you can be really sure before you go treat yourself for a yeast infection you might not have.     A bacterial infection of the vagina can feel a lot like a yeast infection if the vulval area is itchy or painful. Unlike a yeast infection, the discharge can be dark yellow, green, or brown and it won't smell like bread, it can smell like fish or something rotting. If you think you might have a bacterial infection, or if you're not sure, get I would recommend going to see your doctor as this has to be treated with prescription antibiotics.     Urinary tract infections (UTI's) are due to bacteria infecting the urethra rather than the vagina. UTI's can be fairly easily distinguished from vaginal infections by a host of symptoms, including pain or burning when urinating, blood or mucus in urine, needing to urinate often, pain or pressure in back or lower abdomen and a fever or chills. If you think you might have a UTI, don't delay, go see your doctor, because the infection can travel up past the bladder, causing kidney damage.     Another type of infection called trichomoniasis is caused by a parasite that can infect both the vagina and the urinary tract, and is primarily sexually transmitted. If you have a trichomoniasis infection, your vagina can be itchy or painful, it can hurt to urinate, intercourse can be painful, and occasionally you can experience pain in your lower abdomen. Again, you have to see a doctor to get antibiotics to treat this.     I would recommend you see your doctor just to rule out any other infections and to get a proper diagnosis and proper treatment.    Good luck :)

The reason why the box says to take it at the end of your period is because you don't have to wait a week for it to become effective.    I hope that makes sense.. haha.

Just don't say that....  Just comfort them... and tell them that everything will be alright, and they will get out and they will have support from you and that you will be with them throughout the whole thing that you are there to support them and make them feel better and all you want is for them to be healthy happy and clean. And that you loved the way they were when they weren't on drugs and that your miss it, and you want it back so so much....   it really works.... all someone in Rehab wants, is support and love.
aOmDuXubaa	You have a form of sciatica.  You probably hurt your back or tweaked it at one time and now it's causing you problems.  What happens is that the muscles in your core (hips, thighs, buttocks, lower back) spasm and get knotted.  When this happens they pull your pelvis and spine out of alignment.  What I did to stop my problems is to start doing inversion therapy or hang upside down with gravity boots.  As you invert the muscles of your abs are stretched and the knots are broken up.  As this happens they release their grip on the muscles in your hips and thighs.  As they loosen they will release their grip on the muscles in your lower back.  As this happens they in turn release their grip on your pelvis and lower spine and allow it to go back into alignment naturally with gravity.  When your spine and pelvis are out of alignment it effects the sciatic nerve and that's what's causing your pain.  I guarantee if you try inversion therapy within a week or so your pain will be gone.  Here's a good site to read about what I'm talking about.  Hope this helps.  Google: online health inversion therapy for more reading and info.  Hope you feel better...|`|OfQwVhD2aa	GET OF THE WEB & ET TO YOUR NEAREST HOSPITAL ER ASAP!!

cLfIJgudaa	Eat smaller meals more often. That way you are eating throughout the constantly, just smaller portions. eventually your body will get used to less calories and your stomach will shrink and you wont NEED as much food. Every time you feel like you are eating out of boredom, just chew gum instead :)|`|uC0xTgkeaa	complex carbohydrates and protein take longer for your body to break down, so you'll stay full longer. also, if you feel hungry fiber is great too because it fills you up with much fewer calories and it's essential to your body.     It's important to eat something when you are hungry, because otherwise your metabolism slows down, and you'll have a hard time keeping weight off.     Before you eat ask yourself if you are really hungry. If the answer is yes, grab a healthy snack. If you're still hungry after you eat wait 20 minutes or so, because it takes your brain a while to get the signal that you're not hungry anymore.     Since you eat when you're bored, try finding something that you really think is cool, or something you'de really like to be able to do and pursue it. It may take awhile (for a long time, i wasn't passionate about anything, and i didn't think i was good at anything i liked. it might take awhile, but don't give up. we all have something we could be good at if we apply our selves)    Sleeping is good too, and if you're not getting enough sleep, you tend to eat more, even when you're not hungry. This is a recent scientific study. (sorry, I don't remember which hormones cause this, I just remeber reading this in newsweek on saturday.)    Another thing you could do would be to go for a walk, jump rope, lift, or just work out. It might be hard, but when the endorphins kick in, you'll be one happy camper.    It totally stinks to be the only one your age, believe me. i know the feeling. I used to go to a country school like that, and the only person my age that went there talked about mowing lawns, and pheasant hunting. that was it. It will be hard but, you can make it. Good luck. Hope this helped.|`|dX3Zlp2Jaa	The term overweight signifies different things to different people. It's a good idea to start at the beginning, and establish if you are really overweight for your size or not, by computing your BMI (Body Mass Index). To be honest, the sole diet that definitely worked for me is wu-yi tea, it can be seen in the resource box below, they have a few free trials remaining, it has been highlighted in Reader's Digest and USA Today. I melted away twenty pounds, it definitely does produce results!|`|tRJBvDdGaa	what you can do to stop being hungry.  take a walk, bring your ipod/mp3  don't eat to much. make a food chart, list or something.  if you have brothers, sisters, family, then do some activities with them    you just have to find something to do.

Also, there is the recommendation out anyway that you should not expose babies/kids to peanuts or peanut butter before the age of three, whether they have a family history of food allergies or not.

a92aaf69c31f3c24aa6470a18ea029d9aa	Birth control pills are easier on your system. One pack comes with 21 active pills and 7 placebos. Start the pack on the day your period starts, or the Sunday after it starts. You should not have unprotected sex until you finish the first pack. You should be able to get them from Planned Parenthood. Your doctor will not give them to you because of your age.|`|ywXMv5MVaa	I am absolutely not here to judge you, but I do want you to first fully understand what you're getting in to when you become sexually active.    Besides pregnancy (which it looks like you're prepared to guard against), there are always so many worries with sexually transmitted diseases--including infertility, infection, pain while urination, sores, etc. Once you become sexually active, it's very important that you see a gynecologist or family doctor to start annual pap smears. Pap smears are relatively painless, and they are used as screening tests to predict potential cervical abnormalities. Also, it is a great time to get an STD test.    But to answer your question: you should get birth control pills. The morning-after pills (also called Plan B) are available over the counter (meaning you don't need a prescription), but most states require that you be a legal adult to purchase these. The Plan-B pills contain a really high dose of progesterone (a hormone) that would prevent a fertilized egg from implanting in your uterus-- they don't induce abortion. However, these are only taken up to 72 hours after a different form of birth control has failed (the condom breaks, you forgot to take your birth control pill, etc..)    Birth controls are daily pills that contain natural female hormones that keep the body/ovary from releasing an egg, and also thicken the naturally-occurring mucous around the cervix (where your uterus meets your vagina) to keep sperm out.     There is also a birth control method called the NuvaRing. It's a flexible plastic ring that you insert into your vagina and leave it in for 3 weeks. You will get your period, and a week later, you will insert a new one. The ring continuously releases hormones, so it has the same effect as the pill. You don't have to take the ring out during sex, and usually your partner won't notice it. It won't "get lost" (there is no place for it to go!) or "fall out", as the vaginal muscles keep it firmly in place.     In order to start taking birth control pills, you will have to see a doctor and obtain a prescription. If you aren't comfortable telling your parents or using their insurance, you can go to Planned Parenthood.     Good luck, and I think it's awesome you want to protect yourself.
TC21ao0Paa	This a normal reaction from receiving an injection ( s). However, some hurt more than others depending on the medication. The ingredients that are in a injectable medication vary, some ingredients are more irritating than others to the skin area where the injection is given. Plus, the technique ( the proper muscle and the right way to give it ) can make a difference too. My daughter has had the Gardisil injection and has said that it was the same as receiving a tetanus shot. Her upper arm felt fine the next day.  It OK to take Tylenol for the pain, apply ice to the area but, do not place directly on the skin. Place the ice over a small towel or pillowcase. Do this for about 15 - 20 mins, three-four times a day. Or, if you prefer, you can take Motrin ( Ibuprofen), Advil, or Alleve which have an ingredient to reduce swelling, unlike Tylenol. Take Motrin , Advil or, Alleve with a glass of milk or with food to reduce stomach upset.  The discomfort should go away within 3-5 days or, sooner.|`|5lH1ZPPdaa	Yea, defiantly normal. Some weirdos like me like that swollen feeling. I don't know why though. No, I think that I've had it and it doesn't hurt. =)|`|3J3cNZpZaa	Yes It usually hurts or a week or so in some people. In the future try to keep your muscles as relaxed as possible when you get a shot and you should be ok in 3 minutes. However, shots r made out of a neutralize dform of teh actual virus. The virus is harmless, but it gives your body the chance to know teh virus and produce antibodies which will kill real viruses if you get them. So it is a localised infection of sorts, it might hurt for a while.|`|QIEqHH9laa	Yes it's completely normal
a92aaf69c31f3c24aa6470a18ea029d9aa	It can take 1 to 3 years for your periods to become regular.|`|VjFCNozjaa	You need to write down the first and last day of your period each month so you can track that. Everyone is different - some girls get their period every 21, 28, or even 34 days but you need to keep track every month so you can see how your body works.    Is there a possibility you are pregnant? When was the first day of your last period? Even if you  use a condom there is a slight chance of getting pregnant.    If you are under 21 these things can change until your hormones level out.     Also keep in mind that stress, weight gain/loss, diet, exercise, and teenage hormone changes can also affect how often you get your period.|`|ea42eb25a8abec1d31b842b732c7d5e2aa	well depending on your age it could be totally normal  like if you're a teenager it's totally normal to skip a period for a month or even 2 but if you're an adult you should maybe get it looked at and if you're middle aged (like 40-60's- but i'm assuming you're not) then that's also normal, it's called menopause.      but you get your period about a week or two (well it depends on your body) after you ovulate (when you're most fertile) so it won't come on an exact date.

No matter what a doctor tells you about how "easy" it is to take care of your diabetes and be healthy, it sucks to be diabetic.  That being said, it is normal to feel frustrated and even angry over being diabetic.  You are a normal diabetic with how you feel right now.      Unfortunately you are stuck with it until they find a cure.  Being diabetic puts you at high risk for depression so I suggest that you talk to your doctor ASAP.  Let them know how you are feeling and you may want to consider getting a counselor.  This can really help with all the emotions you are feeling.    It is great that you want to reach out and get support.  Check out http://www.dlife.com/diabetes-blog/ to talk to others.  Some other good sites are:    http://www.diabetesdiscussions.com/    http://the-bad-blog.blogspot.com/    http://www.diabetesdaily.com/    Also here is a guy with some good diabetes videos that can cheer you up, he has dealt with all this stuff too:    http://www.youtube.com/user/1HappyDiabet...    Hang in there and know that you are not alone.  Lots of us out here are fighting the good fight and living with this disease. It is alot of work but you can have a pretty normal life.  I have been diabetic for over 20 years (since I was 13) and I struggled alot too.  I have done the things I want in life (I am married, have a great job, have my master's degree, been a good friend and sister over the years....) Don't get me wrong, it wasn't always easy but if I can do it, you can too!|`|Lckon4W0aa	Definitely! There are also camps for kids living with diabetes. It gets really hard trying to deal with it all the time. I babysit 2 type 1s, and they aren't too happy most of the time, either :P Their dad sent them to a diabetes camp in the summer where they made a TON of friends of understood them, and didn't see them as diabetic. Diabetes was normal. Their dad also talked to the kids' doctor about other type 1s in the area. He didn't give outright info, but the doctor did talk to other parents of the kids, and they set up a date for the kids to hang out. There are all kinds of things online that help! Try the D-life, ADA, or tudiabetes websites. You'd be surprised what you can find!|`|96agLgIjaa	How old r u? ive felt the same way MAny many many times b4 & im 11|`|iK3YYRaTaa	Depression is not generally listed as a complication of diabetes. However, it can be one of the most common and dangerous complications. The rate of depression in diabetics is much higher than in the general population. Diabetics with major depression have a very high rate of recurrent depressive episodes within the following five years. (Lustman et al 1977) A depressed person may not have the energy or motivation to maintain good diabetic management. Depression is frequently associated with unhealthy appetite changes. The suicidal diabetic adolescent has constant access to potentially lethal doses of insulin.   At this point in time, it is well accepted that psychological factors and psychiatric conditions can affect the course of medical illnesses. There is some suggestion that the stress of depression itself may lead to hyperglycemia in diabetics. The interaction between cardiovascular disorders (such as heart attack and high blood pressure) and depression has been extensively studied. Anxiety and depression can also affect other conditions including irritable bowel syndrome, headache and skin diseases. Treatment of anxiety and depression may lead to a better medical prognosis and well as a better quality of life.     For over three hundred years, physicians have suspected an interaction between the emotions and the course of diabetes mellitus. Studies have examined whether stressful events or psychiatric illness might precipitate either Type I (insulin-dependent) or Type II (Non-insulin dependent) diabetes. So far, study results are not conclusive.    Now that we have more accurate methods of measuring glucose control, it has become easier to measure both short-term and long-term effects of emotional factors on blood glucose level. One study found that children judged to have a "Type A" personality structure had an increased blood sugar elevation in response to stress. Children with a calmer disposition had a smaller glucose rise when stressed. (Stabler et al. 1987) A 1997 study suggested that Type I patients with a history of a psychiatric illness might be at increased risk for developing diabetic retinopathy. Those patients with a psychiatric history were found to have a higher average glycosylated hemoglobin. (a measure of long term diabetic control) (Cohen et al. 1997) Children whose relatives made more critical comments had significantly poorer glucose control. Interestingly enough, emotional overinvolvement between family members was not correlated with poor diabetic control. (Koenigsberg et al. 1993) Diabetic adolescents had a higher incidence of suicidal ideation than expected. Those with suicidal ideation took poorer care of themselves. Not living in a two-parent home was associated with poorer long-term diabetes control. (Goldston, et al. 1997)    Recent studies have suggested that effective treatment of depression can improve diabetic control. In a study by Lustman and colleagues, glucose levels were shown to improve as depression lifted. The better the improvement, the better the diabetic control. (Lustman et al. 1997a)    Being diagnosed with diabetes is a major life stress. It requires a large number of physical and mental accommodations. The individual must learn about a complex system of dietary and medical interventions. Lifestyle, work, and school schedules may have to be altered. This can consume a lot of energy for both the individual and his or her family. Just as important, are the psychological adjustments. One must adjust to a new view of oneself. For those who liked to see themselves as invincible, this may be particularly difficult.    Many newly diagnosed diabetics go through the typical stages of mourning. These are denial, anger, depression and acceptance.    Denial: This can be one of the more dangerous stages of the grief process. It may not occur only once. Many individuals cycle back to this phase several times. The honeymoon phase, associated with early Type I diabetes, may reinforce denial. Denial is a common stance for adolescent diabetics.    Anger: It really does seem unfair. The type II diabetic, trying to lose weight, may envy heavier people who seem to enjoy good health. One might erupt at someone who innocently offers a desert. Unfortunately, anger can drastically affect glucose levels.    Depression: Mild depressive feelings are a normal part of grieving and adaptation. As long as they are not pervasive or prolonged, they may not be harmful. However, when the depression lasts a long time, becomes severe or interferes with diabetic management, one should seek prompt treatment.    Acceptance: Individuals achieve different degrees of acceptance and inner peace. Some will need to experience the denial, anger and depression several times as they move through different phases of life and different stages of diabetes. Some people move through a chronic disease to a state of much greater self-knowledge.|`|WROvNbBsaa	Hang in there.  You are not alone.  This link below is to an article discusses some ways to cope with diabetes.  Hope it helps.      http://www.ehow.com/how_4708155_develop-...
J9ezdaiqaa	The way to lose the fat on your stomach is through proper diet and exercise. You need to concentrate on proper nutrition methods and exercise that have been proven to provide results.
klNLX8D4aa	I get like that too when i have a space heater pointed towards me.  Im guessing its just our skin drying out from the heat and its makin it dry and itchy.|`|jFpaKZ2Baa	probably just a heat rash. It happens when you sweat too much and get a rash from it.  If you see little red bumps on yourself, it's heat rash. Either way, try baby powder.  It usually helps.|`|6coPZY71aa	i have this it is called prickly heat. I cant go to foreign countries in the summer because im miserable. lol. but there are things to help. a steroid cream can help for a short while, e.g. while your on hospital, and a thing i personally find works a treat is Daktarin Aktiv Ice Cooling Athlete's Foot Spray it provides a cooling sensation and takes the itch away to give you ease.    there are often certain creams and irritants that will set it off e.g. if you are allergic to a moisturiser or suncream.    i hope this helps you.|`|4c692d7ab158ee64f8b0f7a892d3e769aa	me to i hate it! x
3YCs5nDJaa	follow the tips given below  http://www.maintain-health.blogspot.com|`|1LBwXPpMaa	Just eat right and when you exercise make sure you break a sweat. I would eat about 1200-1500 calories a day and work out for at least a half hour. It is not that healthy to loose 10 pound in two weeks but if your really dedicated you could do it in about three or two and a half weeks. hoped I helped.                                                             Julia |`|uC0xTgkeaa	hun, you are just fine.
OBaP0Hf3aa	First of all, DON'T crash diet. The weight will come right back on.    What you should do is alter your diet a little bit more. Try limiting the number of calories you consume. Try going for around 1,400 or 1,300 per day. If you do that, make sure what you're eating is very nutritionally rich, or you'll start feeling weak or faint. Try cutting out the yolks of the eggs if you eat them a lot - all of the cholesterol and most of the fat is in the yolk. Drink a lot of water - try to get down at least 8 glasses a day, because water aids in the burning of fat.    It sounds like you exercise a lot, but maybe amp up the intensity of your workouts. If your cardio is usually walking or jogging, try running. Don't push yourself too hard, though. Also, building up muscle helps to burn fat, so if it's size you're worried about, do more strength training, but if it's only weight you're worried about, don't do as much - muscle weighs more than fat.|`|ygTr3fvVaa	Maybe up your strength training. Muscles burn fat.
AEAxZEveaa	Just make sure you don't injure yourself doing that. I used to run 8 miles a day as a teen and I still have injuries. Listen to your body.  From what I've read, you lose weight faster and get your metabolism up faster if you weight train than just doing straight cardio. I've had much more luck with atkins than traditional low calorie diets. And make sure you don't go too low with the calories, you will lower your metabolism and your weight loss will slow way down.
1nC4fVw3aa	don't be worried, every ones period is different and its completely normal for you to have it late because for me mine is very weird and i am your age|`|hNFfRTQGaa	cycle's change over time its normal, don't stress over it, if you a virgin then there's no problem it'dll come soon.  Goodluck.
UZJ7wVc8aa	The key to starting an exercise routine is to make the changes slowly. You can't go from being sedentary to active overnight and hope to succeed. Start out by exercising 1-2 times per week and eventually moving up to 3-5 times per week. Only increase the amount of exercise you do per week when you feel ready.    Exercise routines also have to be well rounded to be successful. You need elements of flexibility, cardiovascular and strength training. You don't need to go to the gym to get a good workout, but having access to that type of equipment is a definite plus. Flexibility isn't very intensive and can be done on most if not all days of the week. It won't directly help you with your goals but it will lead to better performance - it will make exercising a lot easier.    Cardio should be done 3-5 times per week while strength training should be done 2-3 times per week. The more weight you want to lose, the more you need to exercise. If this seems confusing, you can get a free personalized workout routine at http://shtrainer.com
HAKQ1BMSaa	What is the name of your medication? It might be a side effect of the medication or it might be something else.|`|gQ8EMW8gaa	your hypertension medication|`|3Zqc29ueaa	OK first thing, mention it to your doctor, it could be a side effect from the h/p med your taking. Their are a long list of h/p meds out there its just a matter of finding the right one for you, one without side effects,,,As far as the numbness and tingling feelings in your legs, I get that sometimes to, it comes and goes, I think everyone gets those feelings at one time or another, but talk to your doctor about that to he might do a blood workup, he might test for diabetes, or might even send you for a leg ultra sound just to make sure you have good blood circulation in your legs, It's better to find out about it then to be worrying about it.     Good Luck.|`|gNBO8M71aa	It sounds like side effects and that it's affecting your circulation. I would google your medicine's name and check out the "call your physician if..." section.
UZxeBrxQaa	Any abnormal skin lesions or conditions on that body part is immediately suspect.  It, unlike your hands, does not get dry skin easily, and the "dry spots" can be caused by a number of problems.    Simple chaffing would resolve on its own, so if its been there for any period of time, there has to be another cause.|`|7K3RcnNcaa	How much is your sexual health and peace of mind worth?  $10?  $50?  $100?    If you don't want to spend the money, many communities have free and confidential STD clinics.    Get tested.  If you really thought it was nothing, you wouldn't be asking this question.  Reassurance from a well-meaning but unqualified person is worse than useless--it could actually be harmful.|`|Su0O55W8aa	Ummmm ok your body isn't something to play around with, especially with diseases and money shouldn't matter in this situation.  However, you can go to your local Health Department and get tested for FREE and receive FREE treatment if needed!
9440e28b2ef820fd5eab4d5cfc34217faa	Use steam, and drink lots of water. You might even want to eat something hot and spicy.    But if you're sick, you really should be staying home getting well, not spreading whatever you have.
7aqysN5saa	No worries :]  it happend to me!  It's icky :p  your period should be coming soon!  Be thankful you don't have it yet!  No, i'm kidding it's not that bad ":]  cept for the icky part !  ahha.  If you have any questions e-mail me @ aly.5495@yahoo.com
KPtrfsEYaa	the only way to get rid of fat is through cardio!|`|FrMR6TnWaa	go to youtube.com and type in love handles && thighs workouts.

2b4cf122bf028b6f310138970448a801aa	It might depend on what type they are buying you. If it's just like Dove clinical strength, this really might not do the job. I have this exact same problem. I forgot the technical name for it. But it's actually pretty common. Chances are you're just wearing regular deodorant. I use Certain Dri (The roll on kind, no Certain Dri AM) It's a special kind of antiperspirant, even better than the other "clinically proven". You can buy it at more drug stores or Wal-Mart. Be sure you read the directions!! It can be harmful to you, but really only if you use it right after you shave. Also be sure to apply it at night and then wear a regular deodorant in the morning. But this works wonders. I don't sweat period under my arms anymore. I also used to buy Maxim, which I could only find on the internet, but it seemed to have stopped working for me after a few months.
Tu9S1WaNaa	You need to tell your Doctor.  You need to have some tests ran.    It could be from stress, but you need your heart checked.  You also need blood tests to make sure your potassium isn't low or high.|`|AA11535062	The answer to your question MAY be Mitral Valve Prolapse. This is were the valve going into the left ventricle prolapses or folds backward in to the left atrium. It is most common in younger women. The symptoms are activity intolerance (weakness), dizziness, syncope (blackouts) and palpitations. Pain can also accompany the other symptoms . Do any other women in your family have this issue? There is a family link. It affects 5% to 10% of people. Obviously you need to see a doctor concerning this issue.
SuSdQd6jaa	Well it depends. There are two different types of Diabetes, The first one is when you have to take an insulin shot. You feel dizzy and I think your blood sugar has to be around 300 to be diagnosed with it. The other type Type 2, which my father has, is if you have to much sugar and carbs in your system. You have to lay off the sugars, Mainly stick to sugar free food and low carb, it's a challenge but it's worth it If you want to stay healthy and live longer|`|ZYpRcIPQaa	First, the ideal level is 72mg/dl to 126mg/dl.  Acceptable is 130 to 180. More than that you're diabetic. But sometimes your doctor will ask for several test before comforming you're diabetic. So, GO to your doctor first.     I'm diabetic too, and it was hard at first as you hear all those complications and warnings and such. But, actually it was simple. You only have to manage your life and diet. If you follow the simple rules you can live a long and better life than normal people.    well, first, lose your weight... means exercise.  Then, lose the sugar.... means less sugar in your diet.  Then, lose the oil, fat, add more vege , fruits and plain water.  Eat more fish. Eat less meat, poultry and other seafood.   Then, you can add cinnamon and bitter gourd to your diet.  They are said to lower blood sugar.    Good luck!!|`|G6ZCpYwYaa	It honestly depends on what type of diabetes you are diagnosed with.    Type 1 - insulin dependant  Type 2 - diet controlled    I have type 1 diabetes, when i was diagnosed when i was eight, i lost alot of energy, and i drank alot of water. (not by choice). I was never aware of my sugar level during these symptoms, but when i was taken to hospital it was 28.8.    If you need anymore advice, feel free to ask :)|`|68edad4826bc75b2b9f39ed5a85d8cf5aa	Your best bet is to see an endocrinologist and get a dx so you know what you are dealing with.|`|VYtlFDpxaa	I'm not sure about the first question. When I was diagnosed my blood sugar was >800. It's not terribly hard to live with, but it's pretty annoying. The only thing I think that makes my day really difficult is the insulin shots. I have a huge fear of needles, and I have to give myself insulin 4 times a day. Like you can't just say, I'm hungry, and then go eat something. You have to check your blood sugar, then you have to count the carbs, and you have to figure out the right amount of insulin you need before you eat. Drinking water is the only thing I know to do to lower your blood sugar. I'm pretty new with this.
kK4GG6Z2aa	DISREGARD THE HERPES ANSWER..you'd both know if he had that..as he would show signs on his mouth ...cold sores and on his genitals...You too would have the symptoms.  It could be any number of things and only a doctor will be able to find out the cause with various tests.  Doctor will probably take some blood tests to find out the problem.  Hope he feels better soon..try not to get too worried.  I know its difficult - but it won't be too long now before you get a diagnosis which will put your mind at rest..knowing what is wrong is far better than all the things that may be going round in your mind and will be easier to cope with in the long run.  Good luck and take care|`|kA0xb0MVaa	You need to include more information in your question.  How old is your husband.  Other than the fevers is there any other symptoms.  Are there symptoms before the fever or a few days after?  How long do the fevers last? Does he have any other medical conditions? Does he take medicines or natural supplements?  You can email me directly if you would rather not post.    I could list a variety of horrible illnesses that would include this symptom, and scare you half to death.  But the reality is that without blood test results, this single symptom is not enough information.  This could be absolutely nothing.  But without blood tests or other symptoms, there is no way to tell.  If you have questions after your doctor appointment, feel free to email me. or post an additional question.      I'm sorry I can't be more help.

VuhhcINOaa	I'd suggest doing crunches every day (if possible) to help strednthen your abs; also bend to the sides when doing a crunch to target your obliques. Try not to eat foods high in sodium; they can make your stomach swell. Also avoiding fatty or too many sugary foods would help.Try to exercise in ways that won't bore you; maybe try turning up your stereo and dancing. Cardio will help your body all over, but maybe get a gym membership temporarily, and see if it's worth committing to. You can also find a friend to exercise with so you can motivate each other. Aaaand, eat plenty of fruits and veggies!

qqNxUxPNaa	You have cervical dysplasia.  These are pre-cancerous cells on your cervix.  DONT WORRY!  It doesnt mean you are going to get cancer.

mA6ZUMPgaa	buy protein prouder. make it with milk. if you want Whole milk. from break fest and dinner. if you have PE and do that, you will gain muscle weight and thus not fat weight. but if you want to get fat, just eat everything you can see even if you feel full. not recommended. btw since ur young you have a fast metabolism, meaning anything you eat turns into physical energy fast and not stored fat|`|1YcKHGLqaa	You may have a metabolic problem, or even a parasite. You should DEFINITELY see a doctor about this -- no matter how hardcore your metabolism is, this shouldn't be happening. You are very, very underweight.     Go to a doctor, ASAP. Seriously. Point out to your mother that you're developing, and that being underweight at this age can seriously screw up your health for the rest of your life.    I have a high metabolism, and have to work pretty hard to keep my weight up, but this is a serious issue you have here. You can use me as a story for your parents if you need to -- I'm your height and at 15, I was around 100 -- so 20lbs heavier than you. Even that messed me up enough to make my hypoglycemic, something I'll have to deal with the rest of my life, and something that could lead to diabetes.|`|h31I5hSAaa	ya i think im underweight too.... i eat a lot... cant gain weight!|`|0S5qfrncaa	So you most likely have a super high metabolism.

vvB0Etysaa	Hi:    1200 is the basic for starving your body.  Its quicker to lose the weight but you will only put it back on.    1600 is more reasonable and much better for your body intake on vitamins etc.   Try not to lose lbs to fast as you will gain it back (Pronto)|`|ea42eb25a8abec1d31b842b732c7d5e2aa	well it depends on your gender, height, weight, age, etc    but i'd say 1600 calories a day

UZJ7wVc8aa	Gaining weight & muscle is a two step process: you have to eat more and lift weights or engage in some sort of strength training routine.    The most important rule to remember if you want to gain weight is to eat more calories than you burn. Only by doing this can your body use the excess energy to build muscle. If you eat less than you burn, there is no way to gain weight, it's as simple as that. Your first step is to figure out how many calories your body burns per day. Use this calculator http://calorieneedscalculator.com  to get an estimate. Now eat more than you burn and you're on your way to gaining muscle.    Gaining weight is as simple as eat more than you burn but if you want to gain muscle, you also need to exercise. If you just ate more without lifting weights, you'd just gain fat and become unhealthy and overweight. When you lift weights (or participate in any strength training) you're actually causing some damage to your muscles.     When you rest, your body uses those extra calories to repair and rebuild the muscles. When this process is complete, the muscle is stronger and a bit bigger than it was before. You obviously won't notice a difference right away, but over time you will find yourself becoming stronger and bigger.    You need to keep your diet clean to gain the right kind of weight. Stay away from sugary and simple carb foods such as candy, foods made with white flour, soda and other junk. These foods will promote fat storage, something you don't need. Stick to foods made from whole wheat flour, oats, brown rice, lean sources of protein (chicken, some cuts of beef, fish), nuts, beans, legumes and protein shakes - yum yum. If you need more details, go to the Guide to Gaining Muscle -  http://straighthealth.com/pages/guides/g...

lUe3IRozaa	I'm a skater, and I have to deal with scrapes all the time, lol.    It really depends on how bad the wound is, and how hot your skin got during the 'burn'.    Often times, these kinds of wounds will start hurting less after about a week-a week and a half. You can expect it to scab over in three to four days, depending on how damaged your skin is and how you take care of your wound. Remember, even though Neosporin is good for preventing scars and keeping out infection, it will keep the scabbing soft, wet, and oily. A good thing to do would be to add the cream while the skin is still raw, and then let it air-dry as the scabbing becomes more flexible so it doesn't rip. ALSO: NO BANDAIDS! Bandaids can keep wounds too moist and don't allow them to breathe.    Hope I helped! :]
1e39dc21d986e999b9cf7fb54b59088daa	i suggest you run miles weekly. play ball. eat healthy. chew your food, 5 bites more, do yoga or polities.|`|lEXTHOZPaa	This time frame is too short to lose weight.  Try to avoid junk foods, fatty foods and walk at least two miles a day. You have to continue at least for a month to find some improvement in weight loss.

8PIiHCZaaa	I am on methadone, and let me tell you: DO NOT GO ON IT.  It is way more addicting than heroin.  It should only be used as a last resort.  Have you heard of Suboxone?  This is a neat little miracle drug that can even get you through the withdrawals.  It is also an opiate blocker.  It has mild to no withdrawal symptoms.  I would recommend it, but be sure you're ready to quit.  It only works twice.  You can get it without goin inpatient anywhere, and usually you only have to see your doctor for refills.  Although if you think you could benefit from counseling, go for it.     Other than that, the best thing to do is to fill up your time so you don't have so much idle time to fantasize about blasting off.  Get rid off ALL ur rigs, cookers, any old cottons, all the gear.  Hang out with people that don't do dope.  Start smoking weed.  Trust me, compared to heroin, weed ain't ****.    You can do it without AA/NA.  You really don't need it.  At least by me, NA is very cliquey.  Sort of cultish too, if you think about it.  If you like that sort of thing, go right ahead, it has helped lots of people in the past, I just don't agree with a lot of their ideas.  They like to keep you for life.|`|w1iHxDL1aa	Dr Phil and Rehab all the way !|`|odiTRvpvaa	whenever you crave heroin smoke some weed|`|ea42eb25a8abec1d31b842b732c7d5e2aa	well the way drugs work is it basically screws up your brain and makes it so that it only releases endorphins when you're high  so you should just muster up all the will power you have and seriously try to quit (that is it you really care, you kind of have to hit rock bottom before you can actually get better)    if it takes moving again, you might have too :/|`|wQSsw8QHaa	im still looking for the answer to and am seriously considering rehab  i have a drinking and smoking problem and am going thru the same crap i just pray alot and it will eventually go away i suggest switching jobs for sure i had 2 cousins on the rigs but they couldn't quit meth at that two week period try to go 1 more week and the erg will probable leave good luck God Bless|`|jKmbJyxJaa	Is it possible to move, or tell your family? I really don't know what to tell you. Maybe you could go to NA meetings or some other type of program. It worked for my dad. He said it is most important just to find something you enjoy doing besides heroin and get treatment for the depression that usually follows.    Good luck. I've helped my dad, an ex, and now my sister's boyfriend with their addictions. They were able to quit, and so can you. Don't listen to anyone that would put you down!    One more thing:  I don't know where you live, but maybe you could try the drug called Suboxone. You can google it. My dad said it was a lifesaver.|`|qpln6o9Yaa	I had to kick alcohol some years ago and even though I know it is not coke or heroin, I had it bad and it was not easy at all. But the first step was really wanting it out of my life. I had to have the meetings. I needed the support and a sponsor when I felt like falling off that wagon. Have you tried a support group? They are there for you 24/7 if you need them. I wish you luck and hope you can finally lick this. God Bless.|`|znvKmRY8aa	listen ive detoxed on my own in my own house and it wasnt as easy as you think it is! i had to lock all doors and windows and post my bro outside of the door. im letting you know now that detoxin alone and without proper care is serious health concern! u need to becareful. you need to join a support group (NA, AA) and find a sponsor, better yet start talking. get everything off of your chest and releive everything. thats when you find your true triggers. people there will respond to you with help and respect. theyve been thru what you have and understand it all! good luck and please try to remember it isnt a something that will just go away tomarrow. your an addict and will always be!|`|6SJ8QHKcaa	Think about what Ray Charles went through.  He almost lost his wife & kids because of heroin.  His wife told him that his usage was more important than they were and she would take their kids & leave!  SHE was able to reach him and he put himself in detox, suffered through dehydration & hallucinations.  After the trauma of getting off of heroin, he just made his mind up that he didn't want to go through this again.    There is a drug to help ween you off of heroin, but you can only get it if you check yourself in to rehab.  They will also have to give you counseling.  If you go through all of this, then it's really up to YOU to NOT DO IT AGAIN!  I feel real bad for you ... and others like you ... you're slowly killing yourself & I pray to God that you take it seriously enough to STOP!  It won't be easy, but think of what you are doing to yourself and those that love you... they feel like their hands are tied.  God Bless You & Good luck!  Stay strong & MAKE IT HAPPEN!

Most people find relief in working out or doing sports.  If that is not your thing try and study, read, focus on school, get a job, paint anything.  Just try to think of things you enjoyed before you started using and try to have fun with it again.  It doesnt matter if it was playing chess with your grandma as long as it keeps your mind off of heroin.  The key thing to do is to mentally keep your mind off of it and tell your dealer your trying to get clean so for him to not pick up your phone calls....depends on what kind of dealer you HAD but hopefully he will understand|`|ce9pMwKMaa	i used AA - i found it to be the most organized of recovery meetings - although there are good and bad meetings and quality is everything.    you need to learn how to deal with issues - ie your need to use - your coping skills - to take responsibility and to have the tools to deal with it.    you can be flying high today and nose dive tomorrow - but then you knew that.    part of recovery is to swallow your pride - not be abused but get humble with a good group.    get over your hypersensitivity - you need tools and self esteem to do that.  cognitive therapy with a recovering addict would be great.
O3t4Rccsaa	An Orthopedic doctor is a surgeon,, you're insurance would have to pay for it if your GP recommends it.  Find a clinic in your area,, most cities have them    I've been operated on by an Orthopedic doctor 3 times and all were don't at no cost to me because I went through a clinic.   (UCSD Medical Center)    If you are in California there are a LOT of UC medical centers in the state|`|mX27tszPaa	It depends upon what type of orthopedic specialist that you need to see.  I would say an office visit would probably be around $120 dollars + xrays or anything else that they need to do.  If you are seeing an orthopedic foot doctor that would probably be around $175, from my experience they seem to cost a little more and I don't know why.  If you need custom orthopedic shoes (my mom did) that can be really expensive, probably around $500.  I put a link to an eHow article below that might help you with the shoe part if you do need that (couldn't tell from your description what type of orthopedic help you need so I wanted to be thorough.)    http://www.ehow.com/how_4759016_custom-o...

There are a lot of opportunities to fail in the real world don't you think?!

The trial isn't even free, you have to pay using a credit or debit card. From my personal experience I can say that you should ALWAYS BE CAREFUL WHEN USING YOU CREDIT CARD ONLINE. I used my card and to my disgust, I was charged for something that I never even purchased. I strongly believe that this Acai trial stuff is a way to scam people and they are acquiring many people's account numbers and selling them out to other company's. I had my account closed and had to start a new one all because of some stupid trial that won't even help because 2 weeks is definitely not enough time to see results. Plus if you don't return the bottle in 2 weeks, they will automatically charge you $40 for the entire thing. The bank is currently investigating this company.

Plus most of the companies that sell it aren't legitimate. In order to get the free trial, you have to give them your credit card number. When they get the number, they start charging you for things before your free trial is up.|`|yY2Czxy2aa	As far as I can tell, there are no proven weight loss benefits from the acai berry, juice, or capsules.    It does seem to be a great supplement (I take it, but don't sell the stuff!) and is full of anti oxidents, which help prevent damage to your body. But that's what you should take it for, not weight loss or fat burning.     The acai berry itself is an amazing thing - has a lot of anti oxidents etc and is really good for you.    But there's nothing really to suggest in scientific terms that it helps with weight loss.     And there are a lot of scams out there, be careful where you buy it from!

I know a lot of that dieting stuff is expensive but I found a free trial of Acai Berry(I think it only cost me like 7-8 bucks at the time for shipping.)  The site was http://starturl.com/efblc -  All I did was try it out for a month and I was sold,  I saw the results I wanted to and like I said I was in that plateau with my weight loss.

You can't sit around eating pizza all day and expect some fruit pills to magically make the weight disappear.  However, both products do help boost metabolism and energy levels, so you might find it easier to lose weight using them.    As for where to get them, there are lots of places - online and offline - where you can purchase them.  There are a lot of online companies that offer free trials, which can be a great way to see if the products work for you, but you need to know what you're getting into.  Read the fine print before you hand over your credit card information so that you know if the company is legit or if you're signing up for a scam.    Hope this helps!  Sara|`|78e2varYaa	You have to be really careful when you choose acai berry products because there is lot of scam. There is acai berry programs which you can't cancel because they simply don't answer the phone or their phone numbers are fake.    On the other hand most of the colon cleanse products are good and in combination with good nutrition plan and exercise they really works.|`|76075de38faee453846c87739c1ee336aa	yes.  my friends have ordered samples from the website below and they have lost weioght.... but they stopped eating carbs, too|`|T0m0gZAtaa	For your meals on a colon cleanse you need to stop eating prepackaged items. You will want to cut out all salt and sugar in your diet. These items are what can lead to the toxins building up in your.    Your meals need to consist almost entirely of fruits and vegetables. These fruits and vegetables are to be plain. You can not use seasoning, butter, and dressing on them. You can eat these healthy foods raw or you can cook them. The best way to eat them cooked is steamed. There is no added fat in steaming. This method also keeps the nutrients in the foods for the colon cleanse. It is important when you follow a colon cleanse to make sure that your body is still getting the nutrients that you need. You do not want to be starving yourself.    While you are following the easy colon cleanse, the only thing that you should drink is water. Stay away from caffeine, juices, milk, and other types of beverages. You can flavor your water with cut up lemon and limes. Stay away from lemon and lime juice that are sold in stores. These contain preservatives that can stop your easy colon cleanse in its tracks.    Follow this diet for four days to cleanse your colon and be on your way to being healthy.
E2kx5kwjaa	Actually, it is good to eat adequate fruit and vegetables while minimise on intake from animal source.    The following are the benefits of consuming from plant source:        * plant foods contain absolutely ZERO cholesterol      * are generally low in total fat content      * are low in saturated fats (except coconut and palm oil)      * are only source of fibre, which is important for colon health      * easily appeal to our taste buds, can be eaten raw or as it is      * are full of vitality and important enzymes      * contain antioxidants, which helps against free radical      * are only source of phytochemicals      * are the best food source of folates|`|29maScwJaa	Yes, it affects it positively. Vegetarianism is one of the best and most beneficial choices I have made so far in my life.|`|TFiGVGYZaa	i think yes,   but would be far better results when combined with natural supplements, you can find more at http://deermagazine.com .  because it combines with the suplement, can help with weight-loss, increasing energy levels, skin antioxidant that helps promote healthier looking skin.|`|NLuyzMOOaa	your choice on what you do, but vegetarians to me usually come across as a pain in the ***.   anyways, its all a balance. too much of anything isnt too good. i like my veggies, but i love my animals too. no harm here.|`|eOO3cKZEaa	when you become a vegetarian it changes your attitude to everything in life because you are being selective, picking and choosing in a vital area of your life.     If you eat indiscriminately as your culture taught , you would be normal but not exercising any form of personal  direction.    If you became vegetarian you would probably notice you are taking an active interest in food quality as it pertains to your health and feelings. With this change the process of intelligent discretion would automatically become a part of your life and selecting other factors to move you into a more complete balanced state would become part of your personal positive growth .     You take one step and the rest will  follow.|`|AA10539102	yes............      wait what is your question again?|`|mXwO9xmCaa	no its actually more healthy to be vegetarian
lXE75yQjaa	Personally, I wear a tampon shooter. You just can't be too careful these days.  http://www.tamponcrafts.com/gun.html|`|ZKHaLbdEaa	Hang them from your ears, or pin them to your jacket for Tampon Awareness Month.  Good luck and congrats on your menstrual bits!|`|3WItFAwlaa	It's not weird.  Women aren't born knowing these things.  Everyone has to ask someone.  Ideally, that would be your mom.  But my mom was very comfortable with the fact that I was growing up so I can understand if that might be difficult for you.  I was lucky to be in a summer camp situation where a group of older girls were happy to tell me and my friend everything we needed to know... and more. lol      The easiest way to insert a tampon is with one of your legs up.  One foot on the toilet seat is a good idea until you get used to it.  Use the directions but there are a few tricks.  My sister had trouble with them.  Make sure you push the plunger all the way in before you start to pull the applicator out.  You probably won't get it right the first time.  That is ok.  Nobody knows this stuff without practice.  Don't tell anyone make you feel dumb for asking these things.  Those people apparently don't remember how scary it was when their bodies started changing out of the blue.    Take care... and talk to your mom if you can.|`|AA10285288	Read the directions on the package they came in.    LOL. Pimp should be a Sex-Ed teacher.    Thanks for the link Jili! I must get me one of those!|`|PNLwOIOraa	There's a paper in the box they come with, with very detailed instructions and pictures.|`|gUWcvxzuaa	Little known fact - boys have a built in tampon training tool. Too bad you have to be 16 to operate it ;)    In your case, read the packet or ask your GP/mum/big sister etc. etc.|`|Puygvee8aa	You don't put them on...you put them IN. The easiest thing to do is buy a box and study the directions. They tell you everything. I suggest juniors or slimfits for your first box. It's pretty simple, once you give it a shot.     Here's a couple of hints. Insert the applicator all the way up to where your fingers are holding the grip. Aim toward your tailbone, not straight up. Push up on the bottom of the applicator. There should be NO cotton left outside your body otherwise it will be exceedingly uncomfortable.|`|7p0TO6ePaa	use the directions on the box hon! you stick it in with the applicator on the push up on the side with the string then pull the rest off.. just examine the tampon before you use it. it may help.|`|jWlZG1J6aa	Inside the box of tampons are the directions on how to best use a tampon. I personally prefer to stand up and squat down to make sure it goes in straight. You can do it while sitting on the toilet or standing up. The one thing to remember is that if you feel the tampon you did not do it right and you need to take it out. Also, ask your mom to show you (not literally) but give you a demo on how to do it.
o08LJ9Jwaa	First set goal for your self on how big do you want to be.
AFi5kTiEaa	here is no fast fix unfortunatley.  it is the hardest part of the body to get rid of, its the last piece to the puzzle is what i was told.  You should run and do lower ab and leg workouts...for the lower abs.  You have to diet to loose that fat and workout like a maniac, running will really help.|`|ea42eb25a8abec1d31b842b732c7d5e2aa	i'm sorry to tell you this, but there is not healthy fast fix to get rid of fat. you need to just eat healthy, get lots of rest, take regular bowel movements, and exercise at least an hour a day.      well there is one way you can fake being slimmer, if you cut salt out (salt makes you retain water) you could actually look slimmer, but not by much    sorry :(
9pLdhuBnaa	Depending on overall medical history it is probably ok, but I would recommend checking with your doctor first before taking it to see what they say.
GoluIRIAaa	Yeah wear goggles or don't open your eyes under water but i would recommend you wear goggles and your eyes will be fine.|`|UZxeBrxQaa	While the eye heals rapidly, generally you should wait at least a week for it to completely heal.    Remember that the salinity of the ocean is identical to that of our blood.  Therefore, any pathogens in saltwater will thrive in your body.    If you just must go, at least wear goggles and keep them on.|`|vlki0YmHaa	I would really not do that to be honest, that salty water is bad enough for uninjured eyes, wouldn't test it; an eye is the worst place to allow any infections.|`|W9WiJJTMaa	Make sure you wear really tight goggles, even if you don't open your eyes underwater you still might get a little bit of water in them.
Kj8J3clpaa	my period is 2 days late and ive been having cramps for like 3 days now but i havent had sex so idk maybe that will help idk wahts wrong with me either tho
OQeAfd24aa	If you are trying to lose weight and you have that is definately a plus.  Just because you can see differences in your body just yet, if you keep it up you have to at some point.      There are a couple of things to do to lose weight on the stomach and thighs....running and biking.  There are more things to do but these are the most effective.  Stationary cardio workouts tend to leave out your stomach and buttocks.     Try running, it gets your entire body moving and therefore burns calories (fat) off of it.     Also, think if you have lost 13 pounds in 3 and half months that is less than a pound a week.  Maybe you just haven't noticed because of the time frame.    Guarenteed if you run everyday at least 20 minutes (along with diet) you will see results in your thighs and stomach within weeks.    Stay away from situps/crunches for a while, they can make your stomach feel and look bloated.  And don't lose to much weight, keep your body weight at a healthy level, and if you are a male you shouldn't lose anymore weight.|`|mxqAOxYRaa	If you've lost 13 pounds, you've lost 13 pounds|`|74209f509512526a7c775597bcd23f8eaa	Be sure your efforts are not becoming counter-productive. Be sure you are losing 13 lbs of fat and not part fat & part muscle. Eatting healthy is only part of the puzzle, you  " Must " be sure you are eatting enough of calories for your body mass & the exercise your doing. You must also get into the nutrients, be sure your getting the right ones. So eatting a low fat meal is not all there is to it.    13 lbs in 3 months seems low to me, if your eatting right and exercising daily I would think you should lose at least 10 lbs per month ( for exercising daily).  I think, you must cut out all the sauces and condiments. Thngs like gravy, ketchup etc. I thnk, eat two slices of bread 2 times a week only. I thnk, start measuring everything and eat only the proper amount. I think, no second serving ever - even if its healthy too much will still add lbs.  For some reason you are picking up extra weight or not burning enough. Move the intensity of your workout up also, and extend your time. " MAKE IT BURN "  You must sweat and hurt if you expect to burn fat ...  Document everything you put in your mouth - Keep A Food Journal so you can see where the extra calories are coming from this week.   Walk a lot...outside .. on the treadmill...cycle...weights....keep moving the entire time you are working out...  Weight-in every third day to know where you're at. Weigh-in only first thing in the morning after you empty your bladder.    13 lbs will not show up in the mirror or on the tape measure so you know. Your clothes will begin to fit loser once you lost about 40 lbs...above all else  " Stay Hydrated."

But that also depends on your frame size. I'm 5'3" and 117 and i feel great : )|`|YFLfaeAOaa	Well it's quite different if you're going to compare yourself to the american standard. At your height I believe it would probably be between 110-120. That seems to be the average weight. You also have to factor in if you do sports, since muscle weighs more than mass, and also other factors.
Cn6UklwGaa	I don't think it matters much..  maybe he just appreciates you taking care of your body! ;) guys always seem to appreciate a nice body on their woman!    hopefully that helped
C88VCkvnaa	Hm, maybe eat more for lunch if you are trying to eat more? I usually have a day similar to yours, but for lunch I have a turkey sandwich, some sort of fruit, and then some pretzels or rice quakes. :D  Also, switch up your snack occasionally. Celery and peanut butter? Nuts? Pretzels? Etc =)|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	That's not a breakfast, that's a joke. Eat something more substantial! You're 14! You need to feed yourself!    Have a boiled or poached egg with wholewheat or wholegrain bread and some fruit.     Watch out for those granola bars, they are actually very sugary. You would be better off having something like veg soup, or a sandwich with just meat or cheese in it.     At 14 you don't need to be worrying about calories, pet. Not if you're eating properly, and eating good food.|`|jw6Lpt37aa	multiply your weight in pound by 13 the result is your daily calories your body need if you want to lose weight you need eat less calories from food http://www.caloriecounting.co.uk/resourc...|`|GZqaWCGBaa	yeah thats very healthy. just make sure your getting enough vitamins|`|I2iNfYCyaa	very healthy indeed!|`|hCSuAhfjaa	The answer for this question will not fit everyone.  It depends on your general health, you lifestyle, what your goals are (weight loss?), and more.  For your height, you don't weigh very much!  Try adding more proteins and carbohydrates to your diet for dinner.  After a week of eating like this, see how you feel and be ready to make a change if you notice any adverse side effects.|`|Lalr2Jayaa	A better question...  are you or are you not full? Your stomach knows exactly how much energy you need based on your lifestyle. water can trick yous system into thinking you're full, so be careful not to "under-nourish". Some days you might eat more than you need, and another day you might not feel like eating much at all. you're developing, so let your body tell you.|`|fe1b76b6a20dce1bd151bf45adbc8d6daa	yeah its healthy, thats for sure. but its not gonna last for more than a day, so whats the point|`|8SRjELNBaa	In terms of health, it depends on how skinny you are. If you weight 100 lbs, i would strongly advice eating something a bit more caloric. However, if you weight 200 lbs i think it sounds like a great idea.    A quick Google search of the foods with the keyword "calorie count" will give you your calorie count.|`|2Dlo82f5aa	girl/boy? because it will depend.  sounds healthy,

I can't remember why, though.   But the last time I had a UTI, I drank a ton of Cranberry juice and it cleared up before I even made it to the doctor.|`|hZWup7xXaa	it helps to get rid of one. theres something in it that helps but im not sure what it is. i have had many doctors tell me to drink lots of it as i get alot of them
p6pESvHDaa	I'll give you some advice that he can use to get strong arm muscles...but 400 push ups won't help him as much as he thinks.    First, he will have to work his way up to 400 push ups, I am 3% body fat, can bench over 250 lbs. and I doubt I could do 400 push ups in 1 sitting.  I've been working out for several years now.    Second, the push up works the pectoral muscles (chest) the most, the delts and triceps the second, and then the biceps as third.    Without the even distribution of muscle mass be added to each arm, he won't get the toned, muscular look he will desire.    If he doesn't like working out at a gym, he should do calisthenics at home. They don't require weights, and can add muscle, tone the muscle, and reduce the fat covering the muscle.  He can achieve the look he desires rather quickly if he is already in some shape.    Do a yahoo search for calisthenics, or the marines or navy seals work outs.  They are practical for just about anybody.  Good luck, and remember personal trainers like me care about people like him.  We only want to help you reach your goal.|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	He needs to build up to 400 push-ups. He'd be better off aiming for 50 at first, then building up from that gradually.     It would only really tone his top half, the legs also need work.|`|IFs6MWDJaa	No law saying you gotta have muscles to wear a Muscle t- shirt|`|Lalr2Jayaa	There are so many variations of a push-up. rather than that, tell him to find something active that he enjoys doing so he won't have to stress whether he'll get it done or not, also he won't dread it. If he dosn't like the gym but wants a workout, he can jog, do sit-up, push-ups are fine too, but be careful with squats as they will probably tear his knees up.
pM9RWQM2aa	you should go to the ER. you're febrile and since you're feeling weak and dizzy, you're also probably dehydrated- drink fluids with electrolytes like gatorade. but make sure you go see a doctor so you can get IV hydration and antibiotics because this likely is from an infectious etiology. also, having recurrent nosebleeds means that you could be thrombocytopenic ( low platelets) causing you to bleed.|`|ADP9swbMaa	I'd definitely see a doctor asap.
7mhqRhJKaa	You will only lose weight if you burn more calories than you consume.  It is very easy to consume a lot of calories, and very difficult to burn them off.  One hour of running will probably burn about 800 to 1000 calories.  An 8 oz steak with potatoes and sauces followed by dessert is probably about 1200 to 1400 calories.  You will only lose weight if you also cut back on the calories you eat.  Try not to eat and drink anything with sugar or alcohol, and cut back on  potatoes, rice and pastas.  Eat at least four meals a day, do not overeat at any meal and keep running.  You should then lose weight.|`|Lalr2Jayaa	more details would be needed to answer for sure, but 3500 cals= one pound of fat.  and please, don't over work yourself. If you think loosing weight will make you happier, keep in mind that you're countering that effect if you tourture yourself with an indecent amount of heavy work.If you like running a lot, go for it and eat enough so you don't burn muscle to do it.|`|a429735b11d5ee8244a7769333ae26ffaa	To lose weight, you should running before eating...and eat when you completely exhausted and have that empty stomach burning feeling...where you feel very light....and when you do eat....eat only fruits and vegetables.....now...you can eat about 30 times a day b/c what you will eat will be very light and will make you feel light.  This will make your body use the alternative energy;fat w/o damaging your muscles.|`|FyCWaQn7aa	You should also do some weight training and some other exercises, the more muscle you have, the higher your metabolism goes. That's a lot of running though, you will probably lose weight. Make sure you are still eating and drinking plent of water.|`|73U1wJmnaa	You should lose weight. But it really depends on how many calories you consume. You said you're not an unhealthy eater, so you should be doing good on your diet. But to lose some more weight, change up your cardiovascular exercises. After a while, your body will get accustomed to you running your 10 miles a day. Try doing wind sprints and suicides. This will work up a sweat and increase your endurance quickly. Rather than a gradual pace for 5 miles at a time. I hope this helps|`|BINKHZKtaa	Yeah, you'll lose weight but that is a lot of time to waste running.  Instead of running 10 miles just run 3 miles faster.  Try for a time under 20 minutes (about a 6 and a half minute mile).      Also, do intervals.  like sprint balls out for 30 seconds, then jog for 4 minutes, then sprint balls out for 30 seconds, etc.  This sucks bad but nothing burns fat better or faster.  This is what soccer players do to get those hard bodies.      Good Luck!!|`|joiacDUdaa	You'll probably tone-up and gain muscle so you'll weigh more but, look more toned.... Make sure you stretch and have good shoes.. That seems a bit excessive to just lose weight...    good luck|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	If you are currently unfit, forget about running 5 miles AT ALL. Do you not realise how long 5 miles is?     Much better to walk briskly for 30 minutes a time, and you can do this twice a day if you wish. This will be about 3.5 to 4 miles in total, which is much more achievable.     If you want to tone your body in addition to this, I would suggest doing Pilates or yoga as well. Pilates is marvellous for building strength and streamlining the body. Many professional dancers use it as part of the training route and for maintaining physical strength.|`|8cLLhDrfaa	yeah you will. but running that much is crazy.|`|jw6Lpt37aa	will done this really amazing go on and you'll lose weight and your body will be firm and toned in a very short time|`|duyN8ahBaa	Absolutely .......but if you are doing this in regular basis !!!
55ht6KX3aa	If this is the norm for you, then it's "regular" for you. If you are just starting your period, it can take a while for things to stabilize. If you are much older, you may be entering menopause. If it concerns you, ask your doctor.|`|yp8NtB0faa	Yes, I would say that is irregular.  Your period should be around the same time every month.  maybe 2-3 days off.  Birth control helps u get ur period regular. If u need further help, see your docter.|`|tPOvhDOVaa	It can be like that!! mine is like average ooh 30 days but most go every 28 days|`|P8vt2aLhaa	I always thought that irregular meant to miss a month or a drastic change in the length which would be a red flag and should be checked out by your gyn.|`|ySvXRghEaa	Menstrual cycles can be really crazy. If you're really worried go see your OB. As long as you are having cycles that aren't accompanied by CRAZY cramps, odd spotting, etc... then you should be fine!|`|Zu2oVVhoaa	no its normal ... mine use to be like that before I started birth control! womens bodies are made differently! Dont stress about it!
MhpccWpmaa	I've always been told that you start the sunday after your periods starts, regardless of whether you're still on it or not.  I would just wait until you get your next period to be on the safe side|`|xdM1N6Wjaa	You can start it on Monday. I take yaz and my pack starts on Wednesday. Just take it around the same time everyday (put an alarm in your phone or something) and it will work perfectly.|`|h6NqNzHAaa	Already you are not taking it as directed. Start it next Saturday like the doctor told you to,|`|X58gVB7Eaa	Yes, the package gives you those stickers so it reminds you on what day you started the pill. So just put monday as the day you started. You dont have to start on a saturday or sunday. And yes take the pills at the same time everday, its okay if your an hour late to take the pill. For example if you take it at 7 p.m. normally, its okay if you take it at 8 p.m. as long its not any longer then that.|`|EVtJANawaa	First of all you should read the product label. It is not about the day of the week i.e. Saturday, Sunday or Wdnesday, but the first day of your period- which is the first day of your cycle. That is it. If you've not taken the pill on the first day of your period you can do so now, but you will not be covered, for the first 14 days or so, but really to be on the safe side I'd recommend using extra protection until the next period. You need to absolutely get it tight, and it may be confusing especailly if you've never been on a pill before. Also, make sure you take the pill at the same time every day.|`|ffQIT60Aaa	you can start taking it when ever butttttt,   if you take it saturday or sunday it makes   it where youll never have your period on   the weekends   :D|`|OkR3hrzZaa	Ok ocella is the generic for YASMIN. Yaz is different. Yaz doesn't have a generic yet. Its newer than yasmin. As for your question regarding the day you start, yes that is absolutely fine. So long as you take it everyday and you start after your period has ended. They tell you to do this to make sure you are not pregnant. If your period ended on Monday than you can start it monday. Just put the labels on that match your cycle. You also want to make sure you are taking your pill at about the same time each day. This allows the time in beteween your pills to stay consistent. If you were to miss a day than take 2 the next day at the normal time you would take them. Your periods may not be the same for a while. You will most likely spot a little and have some break through bleeding throughout the month. This is normal. This will happen up to the first 3 months and by then it will be normal. The difference between yaz and yasmin is that yaz has shorter periods. I think its like once every 3 months. Yasmin is just your typical birth control with a period every month. Good luck!    ---and as for the comment about you not being protected until the next month if you dont start it on a certain day, thats not true. You are protected 2 weeks after you start regaurdless if its 1 day or 3 days after your period. The doctors say sunday or saturday to give you a guidline. Thats all it is. It has nothing to do with the pill not working if you dont. You ovulate about  1-2 weeks after your period ends so they want you to start the pill before then. If you wait until your half way through the month after your period, you would have already ovulated and the pill would do nothing for you.
YEd9Q5KZaa	Oh yesss it's so very normal. You will likely get it again, but it's possible that you won't. If you don't, go to a doctor.|`|MhpccWpmaa	Yes this is normal.  Many girls and even women have irregular periods throughout their whole lives.  Mine was extremely irregular until I got on the pill so now I know down to the day when it's going to come which is really nice.  But in answer to your question, this is normal and yes, your period will come again.  Just keep a  pad or tampon handy for when it decides to show up!|`|OI3bf4yjaa	It's normal to have irregular periods the first couple years of your period. Don't worry about it.    If it continues (for a long time, like years) and you're still not having a regular period, you should see a doctor. But so far, it sounds fine.|`|ADP9swbMaa	Periods can sometimes skip, come late, or be a lot heavier or lighter than usual. No one is completely regular.|`|g6Vci5SUaa	There are all sorts of factors that can affect getting your period from hormones to excessive exercise to unusual stress.  Keep some protection on you as you don't know when it will start now.  It's normal, and yes, you'll get your period again. :)|`|GXnfJfU8aa	It's fine. In the first couple years of your period, it will be a little irregular. Be thankful that you might have this month off!

It is also possible that you have a cyst on your left ovary (it's a bit complicated, but basically when it 'pops' it scars over instead of discarding the tissue, and the excess buildup makes it more painful), and those are harder for doctors to detect. Finally, it could also be an intestinal issue.    As I said, you need to get checked out...and make sure the person checking is someone else, because you need a second opinion.

I suggest you have your mom schedule an appointment with your pediatrician to determine your BMI. Up your walking to perhaps 20 or 30 minutes, and I suggest that you have some form of cereal and skim milk for breakfast. Raisin Bran is excellent for your digestive system, and it's fairly tasty. Make sure to drink plenty of water, too! Also, I suggest inserting some whole-grain breads into your diet, because you need the starch.|`|rjwDfBkyaa	You really are going to far. You probably do not need slimfast. You weight is fine but if you are not satisfied, do some sit-ups and push-ups( and not the one with your knees) You should see good results without eating so little.|`|dvcDsuFAaa	walking|`|Z1amRTQlaa	Eat lots of junk food|`|pFBaMlI8aa	it sounds like you are eating fairly healthy foods - and that is a good thing. if you want to lose weight at this age though, you should not go on a diet unless your doctor tells you to, which, at 120 lbs, is not very likely. you are 65 inches - which is slightly above the average height for your age and gender. your weight is also slightly above average - but this is reasonable since your height is in the same range. however, if you want to lose weight, exercising for 20 or 30 minutes is a good choice - and it would be even better if you got outside to exercise because you can vary your route each time and get some fresh air as well. if you have dogs to walk that would be even better.   the amount of food you are eating is okay if that is all you are hungry for. if you are still hungry, for goodness sake you should eat more food. you are still growing and need the food. also, it is proven that if you eat less than what your body needs, then your body will keep your fat for as long as it can because this is a natural reaction to lack of food - it responds to a lack of food by slowing your metabolism, making it hard to lose weight, and clinging to the fat you have already.  make sure you eat enough breakfast, it's the most important meal of the day. i would get rid of the slim-fast and the protein shakes, and eat either a bowl of cereal (for the calcium), eggs, (for protein), or even just plain fruit. also, don't eat any food within 3 hours of the time you will go to bed, because all of that will be stored as fat. and, obviously, don't eat any snacks if you wake up in the middle of the night.  at 14 years old, you should not worry too much about your weight as long as you are not extremely overweight, which you are not. just drink plenty of water, eat only what you are hungry for (it will take about 15 minutes from your last bite to realize that you are full), and once in a while, you can even have an unhealthy snack, as long as it is not huge, and not multiple times a day.

It's called becoming "in shape" when it starts to become easier to do your daily workouts. It is most definately still effective even though your not feeling that pain anymore. If you want to push yourself, try doing a different type of exercise along with your Torso Track. :) Goodluck!|`|AA12298409	It means your body is getting accustomed to your workout.

So the fact that they are not aching anymore is very good. train and change your body. good luck.
NNdkhCy0aa	Well done for being so close to your goal!  Do you feel better?  I hope so!  If you want the wrong answer then it is to stop drinking water.  Do not do this!    It's towards the end of any goal of weight loss that it all slows down.  Not fun really.  It's hard work to shed the last bit.  It's like the 80/20 rule.  You spend the first 20 percent of time completing the first 80 percent of a task, and the remaining 80 percent completing the final 20 percent.  Okay, it's not hard evidence, but what they call a truism.  Here are some good tips for your weight loss completion.     First thing is, when it doesn't all drop off as quick don't get frustrated and give up/binge etc..    Don't get depressed but instead look at what you have completed.  Rather than getting weighed, it is a better idea at this point to have your body fat ratio (it's called body mass index, or B.M.I.) measured.  If you go weighing yourself when you are 'heavy boned' - and it is true, you can be heavy boned - then you will only get frustrated.  You may not have as much to lose as you thought.  Don't go trying to work out your body mass index by any of the formula you can get online.  It doesn't account for muscle density, bone density etc..  Get checked by a health professional.  Or in the end, just look in the mirror!  If you have been trying to lose weight you may have had a restricted diet.  Your body by now will have slowed its metabolism down.  It is a natural process from cave-people when there was a scarcity of food and you needed to keep fat layers around you.  Slow metabolic rate is the number one reason why people find it hard to lose.  To speed it up, increase your calorie intake a little, eat really good quality food (you can get a free nutrition guide at http://www.toneupyourstomach.com) and eat those calories over a 5 meal period.  Your body then will realise it doesn't have to hold onto its last few calories.   You also could change (or start) your exercise program.  Even light weight training will make a difference because weight training has been proven to be the best thing to increase your metabolic rate.    Hope that helps  Andrew|`|cGK3c1A7aa	wu yu tea do not eat after 7 o clock wrks for me|`|EVtJANawaa	That depends what you are doing already and how you lost the weight in the first place. You can try changing your training routine to shock your body and/or make some alterations to your diet.   Another alternatives are supplements- products that help you boost the fat loss and kind of help your body remove fat effectively. I know a very good one is Fatrstripper by www.lamuscle.com or CLA based products like Sclupt as they help maintain definition and lower body fat.|`|AA12298409	Change up your routine. I hit the plateau and found after changing my routine up a little I started losing again. Your body gets used to the routine and when you change it it jump starts it again. Good Luck.
73nTYgdraa	Might be sleep, might be your lack of food, or maybe too much food.  If you wanna lose weight, it won't help to stop eat.

You probably need to eat more, simple as that. Have a really good lunch, with pasta or other carbs, salad, meat, veg - then you'll have energy for the gym in a couple of hours time.    Alternatively have a really good breakfast with musli or porridge, toast, egg, fruit.     You might also need to take a day off from the gym just to give yourself a rest - the body needs a day or two each week anyway.|`|wNSI1wdCaa	How much food are you eating? Not eating enough can make you tired. You should be eating between 1200 to 1500 calories daily or you won't have the energy to lose weight.|`|4f46a3ab367e69b76b30e6290112ed68aa	Are you sleeping?

Also drink alot of water, or gatorade and stay hydrated during and between workouts.|`|5lM9tZuHaa	Dont drink energy drinks... that's the worse thing you can do.    Are you eating well?? Maybe you are not eating well and that's why you are feeling too tired at the gym.

Also, many drinks which advertise that they contain your intake of Vitamin C, or any other vitamin, is usually not put into a form that can be absorbed by your body- so "100%" usually means "0%."
i7VjKFP3aa	Ok, first of all you need to see a GI specialist, if you haven't already.  Secondly, the gallbladder is usually considered to be malfunctioning at 35%, if yours is only operating at 40 then it's possible that it's in the process of failing, but it hasn't quite failed yet. And the HIDA scan isn't foolproof either. You might consider having another one done, just to be on the safe side.   I had 3 HIDA scans preformed over the course of a year when I was having gallbladder problems, the first said that it was operating at 76%, the second said that it was 42, and the last one I had said that it was 0%. The first two tests were preformed at a different hospital than the third, and my doctor said that it was probably error on the part of the technician.  When you were having yours done, did you experience any discomfort, cramping or nausea, or if you already were experiencing it, did it get worse? If it did then you definitely need to consider having another one done.   Try eating foods low in fat (no more than 4g or 5g of fat per serving), cut out chocolate, fried, sugary, spicy (tomatoes, onions, garlic), cheesy, fatty, fast and citrus foods completely and see if that helps at all. And drink lots and lots of water.  You really, really need to see a GI specialist, ASAP. It takes awhile to get an appointment, so do it sooner rather than later.  I hope this helps, and I really hope that it turns out to be your gallbladder since it's a pretty easy fix. Good luck, and get feeling better soon!

Some countries allow the use of cold caps, but this is controversial since it might compromise the chemo reaching portions of the skull/scalp.     If you're going to go to the trouble of getting chemo, you might as well let it do its job completely.    Hair grows back pretty quickly. Its no big deal.|`|8cDWPlEpaa	I was also recently diagnosed with lymphoma and had the same question.  There are "cold caps" which is a cap made cold gel or ice that can be placed on the scalp during chemo treatments.  The cap slows the blood flow to the hair cells which in turn slows the chemo from killing the cells.   Your grandmother probably won't be able to do this because she has lymphoma and there are lymph nodes in the neck that may need to be treated.  Depending on the type of chemotherapy she has her hair may not be affected at all.   In any case it is important to use a mild shampoo and brush your hair gently and only about once a day after chemo starts to prevent premature hair loss.  Good luck with everything.|`|17orTrcRaa	Some people won't lose their hair, but most will.  It's  a fact of chemo.

In some cases the hair loss is dependent on the patients own bodies reaction.    There is no sure way of stopping the hair loss.    Her oncologist will give her an indication of the likely hair loss she will suffer to enable her to make appropriate plans.    Hats, scarves, wigs are all possibilities!

DfPyyDssaa	1.) Try to avoid most caffeine-infused products. This would include chocolate (although chocolate is not the biggest culprit), coffee, caffeinated sodas such as colas and darker colored sodas, tea, caffeine supplements such as diet aids, waking aids and other types of stimulating supplements with anything like guarana or kola nut in them.     Caffeine and stimulants, when taken internally, can actually counteract the effects of natural breast enlarging supplements due to their diuretic (water ridding) nature, and the tendency to speed up the metabolism of nutrients and calories, which may hinder the very natural breast enahncement process that you are trying to achieve.    2.) Reducing stress by exercising moderately, getting plenty of sleep and eating the right foods that keep blood sugar stable is a must for keeping hormonal balance, which provides an excellent conduit to breast growth while on an oral breast enhancement supplement.     3.) For some reason, it has been found that oral breast enhancement supplements work best when consumed with higher protein meals and preparations such as protein shakes and egg white egg salad. Lean, pure protein will help you get the results you want, especially with a product like Bountiful Breast.     4.) Take the supplement exactly as prescribed by the manufacturer of the particular product, at approximately the same time every day (just like you would a birth control pill, for maximum effectiveness). This is very important if you are to achieve the maximum growth potential for your body type, as with any other dietary supplement, timing and consistency are going to dictate the effectiveness and efficacy of the ingredients within your body.     5.) Try to let your breasts be as free from constraints as possible at all times, even if this means wearing a looser bra, or no bra at all once in a while. This really is a good rule of thumb for breast health in general as many doctors will tell you, as well as a very beneficial practice for natural breast enlargement, as it will help faciliate making your breasts grow bigger since they are not constrained and the tissues is allowed to "expand" more easily on it's own without any restrictions. Many doctors advocate going braless believe it or not, as even tight bra wearing has been implicated in causing breast cancers - believe it or not. Maybe we should all burn our bras anyways then :)     6.) Light to moderate breast massage will help stimulate making your breasts grow, especially when paired with one of the quality topical breast enhancing creams or serum specially formulated for breast growth stimulation. This method of faciliating natural breast growth and helping to make the body expand and grow your breasts naturally has been used for years in other cultures along with special herbal tinctures as an accepted method of natural breast beautification, and is just now starting to realize its merits here in the US.     7.) If a particular breast enhancement supplement you are using is not agreeing with your body in any way for a period of time after the initial "adjustment" period that sometimes occurs, discontinue use and seek a refund from the manufacturer.     8.) Remember that everyone's body chemistry is different, and some formulations may not work for one person or disagree with them, while it works wonders for another.     9.) Choose the natural breast growth formula that agrees with your body and gives results. This may take a little experimenting on your part (unfortunately). One product that works wonder for one person may not have any real effect on another. As with all other dietary supplementation, natural breast growth products work the same way, there may be some trial and error before your find what truly works for you.    The key to getting the best results in making your breasts grow really is hormonal balance, which all of the above steps and techniques will help you to achieve.|`|nnoLKZguaa	Well don't worry you should eat and live healthily, avoid caffeine, eat protein and pretty soon you will fill out.

It doesn't really matter how old you are, as soon as it starts hurting her it's very likely she'll quickly dry up.    it's really just going to take time for her to loosen up a bit. Since you can hardly get it in... it might be that her hymen is refusing to tear... you can look here:  http://www.youngwomenshealth.org/hymen.h...  and she can use a hand mirror to see if she has one of the types that make sex difficult.    Maybe hold off on the sex for a little bit and try multiple fingers for a couple weeks.    To be honest with you, it's been 5 years for me and my fiance and it still takes me a couple minutes at first to adjust and for it to stop hurting.    It's really great that you're being a sweetheart and you don't want to hurt her :-)  Good luck!|`|ADRc8gJiaa	def use lube!!! and have her buy a larger toy or something so she can stretch it out herself so she feels comfortable. or you can just try and start using more fingers to stretch her out, but def go slow.|`|MT1498npaa	Why does she have to stop you? Continue putting it in, a little bit of pain isn't too bad.|`|dFBccLExaa	Lube can definitely help, but usually, if she's too tight, it's due to her being subconsciously nervous. Since a child's head can fit through there, it's almost impossible not to fit the appendage in there. So I'm guessing that she's just nervous, and needs to relax more. Lube also helps, though. A LOT.|`|86692840fce86f8a24dea58512123d09aa	first you gotta work her up so she's wet. then finger her for a while till she's loose and add a bunch of lube. there's never such thing as too much lube.  goodluck n be safe!|`|0JERmAslaa	go easy and slow at first and then when her vagina begins to stretch u will fit better|`|XbRc9Hdaaa	To her to relax, use lube, and do some foreplay.

I was always stopping him and I was tight as hell. But then I go on top of him and I could control how much and how fast it was going in, It hurt like hell!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  But I went it. I really recommend using lube. I didnt use it but Now Im thinking that I should had.    Good luck! be gentle! and maybe she's scare about you going in. thtas why shes stopping you.     use a condom always.|`|v0V5BKnsaa	Jam it in there. itll fit|`|YJDZwIjKaa	get her to masturbate more.|`|UsojaTuuaa	try more lube. maybe go more slow and just keep working on it.  it will get better.  shes lucky to have a nice guy|`|uqWdNf3Faa	it's going to hurt no matter what. maybe foreplay would help?|`|EgsuMGLPaa	First things first, if you just rock a little bit back in forth, you can usually transfer some of her "natural lube" ;) from the front of your.....tool towards the back, which helps, at least in my similar situations.  Now, if you use lube, whatever you do, DONT use anything with sugar in it.  Just don't.  Also, work it with your hands, no need to bring in the big guns immediately.  Hope this helps :)|`|eCKNRcIVaa	More lube will definitely help.  However the fact that you are well endowed is just awful for her in this situation.  Have her go to the doctor ( or planned parenthood ) and get a pelvic exam, that will help stretch her a bit.  I have to say it but if you really love her if it is just too big and too painful ( and I am telling you I felt like I was being torn in half the first few times and my BF wasn't that well endowed - maybe she needs someone else to be first who isn't as big as you )|`|d394deddf7460bf1dcede85f98862daaaa	Lick her until she ejaculates.  Then work it in.  Slowly at first, once you are in, find the "magic angle" and push past the point of no return.  It's going to hurt.  Once it's in, it should be ok.  Once you are in, just don't move for a while and let her get used to it.  She'll let you know when you can start to move or if it's just too much.|`|VeDJa0m9aa	First of all, kudo's for thinking about your gf feelings and not forcing her to do anything without being ready. More lubs will help. Also, as I did once with a virgin, we went just a little bit further in her, one night at a time for her to get use to it. She finally lost it on our sixth night. Go gradually over a long time for her to adjust. Have  fun and be careful...|`|NXBmcEz7aa	Try K-jelly.  That will help you more lubricated.

eb603a32531b733c208d6a3685da0228aa	A booger is mucus that was produced by the mucus membranes of your nose and upper respiratory tract to help trap pollen, dust, bacteria and viruses that you breathe in.  Since I presume you are picky about what you put in your mouth, I'd presume you would not choose to put a gooey wad of gerbies and dirt in your mouth.  After all, your body trapped all that gunk and was trying to get it out.   Picking your nose and eating it rather defeats the purpose.  It's socially unacceptable, and that would tend to make people avoid your company.  Normally this subject gets covered when you are about 2 years old, and doesn't need to be revisited once you are old enough to type on the computer.  Although I don't suppose you will die if you do it, you will certainly get sick more frequently and be lonesome for company.

LeaUjOoUaa	You can have gas used. Basically you breath in nitrous oxide or laughing gas and it knocks you out. While sleeping, the dentist does the work and you don't have to worry about the needles and such. In a situation like this, if the cavities are small, it may be possible for the dentist to do multiple fillings so you don't have to use the gas over and over again. You will feel a bit drowsy after the procedure and will need someone to drive you home afterward. A lot of people have the same fears and so this type of arrangement is very common with dentists. You just need to check to find a dentist who uses gas. Good luck and hope you are able to find one soon.|`|VCz1CtiLaa	You should look into sedation dentistry.

tc8nbxmyaa	Genital herpes is a contagious viral infection that affects an estimated 45 million Americans. To place this in a broader more mentally visible picture, genital herpes is affecting as many as one in every four people who are sexually active. There are an estimated 1 million new cases each year that are believed to occur. Genital herpes is caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV).            There are two types of HSV and both can cause the herpes symptoms. HSV type 1 most commonly causes sores on the lips and is often referred to as fever blisters or cold sores, but it can cause symptoms of genital herpes infections as well. HSV type 2 is most often related to infections and symptoms of genital herpes, but it also can infect the mouth. The virus remains in certain nerve cells of the body for life, causing periodic symptoms of genital herpes in some people. Many people who are infected with HSV never develop any symptoms of genital herpes at all.    The infection is usually acquired by sexual contact with someone who has symptoms of genital herpes. People with oral herpes can transmit the infection to the genital area of a partner during oral-genital sex and result in symptoms of genital herpes. A person who is infected with HSV but has no noticeable symptoms of genital herpes can also transmit herpes infections. Such asymptomatic shedding of the virus may be fairly common, occurring from 5 percent to 20 percent of the time in infected individuals.       Symptoms of genital herpes in a primary episode vary widely from person to person. They usually occur within two to 10 days of exposure. Typically the symptoms associated with genital herpes that are recognizable involve small red bumps that may develop into blisters and open lesions. These bumps appear at the site of infection, which may be in or around the vaginal area, the cervix, the penis, urinary tract of both men and women, and around the anal opening, buttocks or thighs. Sores also may appear on other parts of the body where broken skin has come into contact with HSV. Over a period of days, the sores become encrusted and then heal without scarring. Symptoms associated with genital herpes in a primary outbreak tend to take longer to heal because the body has yet to build up an immune system resistance to the viral outbreaks.    Other herpes symptoms in a primary episode may include fever, headache, muscle aches, and swollen glands in the groin area, painful urination or vaginal discharge.    Some of the most common symptoms of genital herpes that are often misdiagnosed are misdiagnosed as yeast infection, insect bites, jock itch, urinary tract infections, abrasions or razor burn, ingrown hair follicles, and even hemorrhoids. If you suffer from recurring infections or symptoms of any of the listed conditions, it is advised to see a medical professional for observance and testing when symptoms occur. It is quite possible the recurrence of such conditions could actually be symptoms of genital herpes.         It is never safe to assume that condoms will protect you from a herpes infection and prevent you from ever knowing what symptoms of genital herpes really are. Condoms do not cover herpes infected areas in many of those infected with the herpes virus. The best way to protect yourself from every knowing symptoms of genital herpes is to practice abstinence. Getting to know your partner, engaging in proper STD testing prior to intimacies and being as completely honest and forthright as possible is the most assured way to combat a future infection.    With so many people who are infected with the herpes virus never showing any symptoms of genital herpes, the increase for proper testing is recognized and strongly encouraged.    If you are a person that suffers from symptoms of genital herpes, there are a number of treatment options available. Antivirals are available by prescription from your health care provider and a number of over-the-counter treatments are available and are affective in treating symptoms of genital herpes. One such|`|07YBD5mJaa	Genital herpes is an infection caused by a virus (a kind of germ).    You get the herpes virus by having sex with someone who has it.  It can be spread by having vaginal, anal, or oral sex. It can also be spread by touching the infected area of someone who has it.  It causes small, painful sores or blisters. The sores can come and go, but once you get herpes, the virus is always in your body.    Symptoms:    Most people with herpes get signs of the infection, but some people don't.    Most people get blisters or sores. They can show up in any of these places:    The vagina or penis  The thighs or buttocks  The mouth  These blisters or sores are different for everyone:    Some people get a painful rash of blisters or sores.  Some get only a blister or two that just itch.  Some people feel like they have the flu along with the blisters.  The sores and blisters will heal.    Some people get the sores only once.  Some people get them many times.  Even when you have no sores or blisters, the herpes virus is in your body, and you can pass herpes to others.|`|EkZDP3Oyaa	Herpes is spread through skin to skin contact with an infected area on the body, sometimes even when there are to symptoms on the infected person.  Herpes is a sexually transmitted disease that shows up as broken open sores on the area.  They are red and painful and pretty much gross looking|`|gUy60Efhaa	your best bet is to google search it on the web.... try WebMD.com|`|GUOsn4BFaa	How Herpes is Spread:    The herpes simplex virus (type I and II) are spread from skin to skin contact. The virus replicates and the copies are shed from the skin.     A person does not have to have a current outbreak (with symptoms) to infect someone else. Most people acquire an infection from someone who was NOT showing symptoms.    The increase in oral sex (almost all of which is unprotected) is resulting in an increase in anogenital herpes infections. Yes, a cold sore on one person can cause anogenital (vaginal, penile, anal) herpes in their partner if they engage in oral-anogenital sex.        Symptoms:    -swollen lymph glands   -leukocytosis (elevated white blood cell count)  -painful inflamed blisters develop around infected area   -headache   -myalgia (muscle pain)  -pyrexia  (fever)  -vaginal or penis discharge   -infection of the urethra causing a burning sensation during urination   a burning sensation in the genitals   -lower back pain   -small red bumps may appear in the genital area following earlier symptoms,  later developing  into painful blisters, which crust over, form a scab, and heal.|`|kK4GG6Z2aa	Close contact with another who has herpes.  Genital herpes is caused by sexual contact and presents itself in sores in that area.  Herpes on the mouth is spread by kissing...and presents as a tingle on the mouth nose and face-followed by a small painful lump that gets larger then becomes a blister..It is extremely painful and as on the mouth can prevent one eating properly. One has to be particularly careful with herpes of any form. (Using an ice pack on mouth can reduce some of the tingling burning and painful symptoms) though make sure one covers the ice pack with some form of material as the lips are so sensitive and pack could burn the skin.  Making sure that one uses towels and face flannels and not share with others whilst the virus has flared up.  One can get flu like symptoms with herpes. and can suffer with fatigue  If the herpes is on the mouth (cold sore) one can now get an electrical zapper which can be used at the first signs and prevent it getting to the blister stage.  Both my daughters suffer from cold sores and are 32 and 35 yrs old.  Both have suffered so much that the doctor has given them this 'zapper' as they call it on prescription. And has been used to great effec.  However once you have it you have it for life.  But at least the 'zapper' as they call it prevents the sore from developing and spreading to nose eyes etc.  It is well to remember that the virus is incredibly contagious with physical contact...and to ensure one washes their hands if they do touch the blisters..it is easily transferred to the eyes, nose etc.  It can cause scaring of the lips too.   Once in the system and has erupted it's there for life I believe.  However simple precautions can protect others from catching it...genital herpes..always use a condom...mouth sores ..herpes no kissing .  Genital herpes is recognised as a sexual transmitted disease and one can also get anul herpes.  I believe it comes from the same family as shingles and chicken pox. Have given you some websites for info..there are loads of sites for you to look at.  Hope this has helped.    http://www.ihmf.org/general/resources03....    genitals herpes    http://www.avert.org/herpes.htm

Occasionally and rarely strep will present itself in this manner.  Did they do a "rapid strep" throat swab?      You need to have your parents call your pediatrition or local MD and get an appointment asap.  If you can't see your local MD, have your parents take you to the ER.    Here is why:    Scarlet Fever    Scarlet fever is another form of group A strep disease that can follow strep throat. It is usually contagious and lasts for a specific length of time whether or not it is treated.     Symptoms of scarlet fever     In addition to the symptoms of strep throat, a red rash appears on the sides of your chest and abdomen. It may spread to cover most of your body. This rash appears as tiny, red pinpoints and has a rough texture like sandpaper. When pressed on, the rash loses color or turns white. There may also be dark red lines in the folds of skin. You may get a bright strawberry-red tongue and flushed (rosy) face, while the area around your mouth remains pale. The skin on the tips of your fingers and toes often peels after you get better. If you have a severe case, you may have a high fever, nausea, and vomiting.     Transmission of scarlet fever     You can get scarlet fever the same way as strep throat-through direct contact with throat mucus, nasal discharge, and saliva of an infected person.     Treatment for scarlet fever     Like strep throat, your health care provider will treat scarlet fever with antibiotics.     Hope you feel better and please let me know how you are doing.    2/3/09:  How are you feeling?  Did you get to the Dr's today?  What is the verdict?  Feel better!
Ca0DGDThaa	I have PCOS, in order for it to be diagnosed offically, the doctor had some blood work done for hormones levels.  And I had an transvaginal ultrasound.  If you dont have insurance both the blook work and the ultrasound is very expensive.  I didnt pay a thing for mine because of excellent insurance, but when I got my explaination of benefits it was well over $1700 for both the blood work and the ultrasound.  Just a heads up before you go requesting such tests.
95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	Well, the running should take care of the cardio fitness, in any case, and tighten up the bum and thighs. You could set yourself a time and try to run a little faster, challenge yourself a bit on some days, while on other days you might try adding another 10 minutes running.    To strengthen and improve the rest of your body, try pilates or yoga or both - but you should do it with a qualified instructor to show you how to do the exercises properly. Both pilates and yoga are absolutely marvellous for toning the body and building strength.     I wouldn't worry about losing weight, pet, not if you're growing now - any excess baggage is likely to disappear soon anyway, with all the running you're doing.|`|WbGNp5L6aa	In his book "Good Calories, Bad Calories" Gary Taubes talks about a study that was done quite a few years ago with overweight teenage girls. The girls tried all the usual stuff - low fat food, diet soda, non-fat milk, etc., until they tried something entirely different. Instead of sticking with the low-fat advice that you see everywhere, (and which didn't work) they started eating as much meat (with fat attached) as they could, and stayed away from anything with sugar, wheat products, and processed corn. I can't remember what they did about their veggies. I do remember that the experiment was a success.    I would also suggest that you have one fruit smoothie a day, made from half a can of coconut milk (from the Asian section of the supermarket), some frozen fruit of your choice, and a bit of stevia extract to sweeten it. It will fill you up and help you control your appetite,  and the coconut oil may improve your immune system and help your brain concentrate on your schoolwork.

I failed to do this and was kicking myself all through Swahili for 2 years. Make sure to be well rounded as a person and show some civic leadership, charity work, athletics etc. AP classes are important. Basically, an A in social studies is not equal to an A in AP physics. Get it? Ultimately, dont stress over it too early. You dont have to go to Yale to become a great surgeon. Medical school is medical school, basically.

If your period seems to be extra long or extra heavy, you may want to consider talking to your doctor. Make sure to keep a calendar of your periods - doctors always want to know when your last one was and how long it was. It will also help you see if you're period's acting abnormal.

gsS0c3yVaa	Here is what you need to do. You need to *** first.  Either masturbate in front of him or let him get you there orally or both, whatever.  Bottom line, it takes the pressure off him to "be the man" right out of the gate.  Then he can go slow and you can both enjoy intercourse. Fun apart about sex!?!!??!  Practice makes perfect ;-)    Yes, you have him SO turned on, he he can't hold it.  It's mother nature ensuring his seed is planted first. Think animal kingdom here. Follow me???  Now, go be animals!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|dBoC8fR2aa	Sure, that's is right, as he said. If he were to have sex with an ugly girl, do you think he will come? Or for you, if you have an ugly man, do you feel nice?|`|Gw1LLzDgaa	Yes, sex with someone you  care about (whether you are straight or gay) excites you more, and therefore causes you to orgasm more quickly if you are male.  Anyone who says otherwise has never really cared about their partners IMHO.  I suggest that he masturbates about 2 hours before the two of you are going to have sex (or 3 hours if he won't recover in 2 hours.)  I think you will find that he gets quite a bit slower after that.    Kind thoughts,    Hermes|`|XXbZAriNaa	no - he needs more self cotrol I suppose|`|2dr0hoU0aa	somewhat yes  umm u can do all the work slowly?  he is premature n he had sex with other ppl before?:O|`|r1fVrEwcaa	lots of foreplay to make him last longer and yes because he likes u he will *** fast|`|yVKlAQ0oaa	It may be attraction but I very much doubt it but I hear this issue alot. The best thing you can do is get him off about 20 mins earlier and then just do foreplay until he is good to go again. Once he is ready he should last much longer the second time.|`|ca6pFETbaa	no.... the truth is... your bf suffers from premature ejaculation.  and he is saying that so he doesnt look like a puss|`|lAyQqRVjaa	If he likes you he would be more turned on, and so more harder. and if you are tight, and depending on the position, he will *** faster. Try a position that isnt doggie or anything where he can go to town as when he does he will blow faster and try not to close your legs either as it will make u tighter around him which means their will be more grip for him so he will *** faster.|`|haFNLKXMaa	i think you need another man, he is just 21 and you had sex just 2 times. leave the man, it would be good for him, and look for a pornstar, coz u wont give him any time.    i hope he would asked somewhere that why his girlfriend is such a dumb vegetable.    make him use steroid creams or drain him orally 2 times before u have sex, and also let him feel at ease and dont just remove ur panty as soon as u see him and start humping .|`|kgBQF4JXaa	could be because he likes you, could also be because you make him nervous|`|DFJ9m4WKaa	I definitely would say that means he likes you and finds you very sexually arousing. Just keep in mind just because a man orgasms, doesn't mean sex has to end right there. Every guy will need a short time to recover after orgasm. In fact its called a refractory phase, and in most young men it only takes a few minutes to recover, if that. Some men don't even lose the erections after climaxing.    At any rate, when he orgasms before you switch to doing something else - let him go down on you, finger you, engage in foreplay even just make out and spoon or something.    If it really is a problem several suggestions I have:    Let your boy friend masturbate in the bath room, or even in front of you, with you, if that could be part of your sex play. Either way let him flush the pipes once or even twice. That usually makes it easier for men to last longer a second or third time. As an alternative you can go down on him or give him a hand job.    When you first start to have sex let him penetrate you but have him not thrust, just have him keep himself in you. And for a few minutes just make out or kiss each other.  Then after a few minutes have him start to slowly thrust into you and let him get gradually faster and faster, until you're at the rate you like.    If its really bad and none of that works you may need to see a sex therapist to help him over come his performance anxiety. But in the mean time you can use either analgesic creams or even certain medicines to reduce the urge to orgasm in men. Any cold medicine containing HCI in the ingredients will supress a man's urge to orgasm. Doctors actually do prescribe certain anti-depressants as well which have the same affect.    PS Also try to give your boy friend a little break, it is only the second time you know. The more you have sex, the more comfortable he'll get and the easier it'll be for him to last longer.|`|5ieWhvYCaa	I can see why STD's are really high. Don't people know how to use a condom. I was reading your question and it said he wore a condom the 2nd time. Why do people like spreading diseases?
bvoZZY3uaa	Prozac have very little effect on norepinephrine and dopamine in the brain, taking a low dose of a typical antipsychotic will help with the anxiety and paranoia.
ldpDzaolaa	no, I wouldn't call it that, just maybe you like things more orderly as that is how you are comfortable. not eveyone is like that and it may bother you about other people, but there are people like you and that's what makes us different, but also, what makes the world run, there is a certain order to nature, too.  I like things in their place, too,. so I can find them. you'll change a bit when you get older as it won't be so much of a priority, but,good habits are great and you have them, so it's not a negative aspect of your personality. just like yourself the way you are, but, you can't hold others to the same,so, that may bother you and you have to come to terms with that.

The problem, as it turns out, was all in my head.  Attitude and mood go a long way to determining if you're going to have an orgasm.  Can you climax while masturbating?  If so, it's most likely not a physiological issue, and definitely a psychological one.  You may need therapy.|`|zMDkllJvaa	let the semen build up for awhiole then get exstremly aroused do what youve oways dreamed of
LyR6DudNaa	1. Strike up a small conversation. This will help you learn little things that will come in handy in the future. All girls are different, so be aware of the signs. Listen to the tone of her voice: if she's shy, the tone of her voice might be a little higher and she might start to play with her hair (smoothing it down, twirling, flipping) or adjusting her clothes. Another sign she likes you is if she laughs at a normally boring or stupid joke. (Though, don't be dumb and use bad jokes as a test or you'll just look like a comedic loser.) She may not be able to look you straight in the eye and she might giggle a lot.    2. Watch for signs of flirting. If she's flirting, she may be difficult to read. Flirtatious girls may flirt with guys who they consider to be just friends, and it can be misconstrued as a crush. Because most girls do not want to be obvious, the flirtatious ones might flirt with you a little bit less or they might flirt with you even more. Either way, don't "flirt around". Do not flirt with other girls. If she ever sees you putting your arm around another girl or sees another girl hug you, she may jump to conclusions and assume she doesn't mean anything to you.    3. Notice if she touches you more often than what friends do (she's constantly trying to touch your hand or something). If she finds excuses to do so, then you're probably on the right track. But conversely, don't assume that just because she isn't touching you that she doesn't like you. She may be too nervous of you to touch you yet. Break the touch barrier yourself.    4. Observe how she looks at you. If she like you, she will either hold it for a long time or pull away immediately. Either of these could mean that she likes you. If she pulls away quickly, it means she is nervous but she still likes you - which means that you should probably make the first move. If she holds the stare, then she is confident and she may make the first move. If you happen to glance at the girl and you see her staring back at you, then this means that she likes you, although she may quickly dart her head in a different direction. Look for her eyes to light up when she sees you or hears your name.    5. Look at her friends. If you see most of her friends glancing back at you and smiling or giggling, this means that she is telling her friends about you. If her friends are loud and immature, you'll hear "(your name), (her name) likes you!" Her friends might be making it up, however, just to tease her. When she is having a conversation with her friends, and you come over, she might stop talking all of a sudden. This likely means you were the subject of the recently ended conversation. If she likes you and she told her friends about you, they might come up to you and start a random conversation about things such as: Who would you rather date?, Who do you like better?, Who is the hottest?, and such. If they name a list of about 3 people and her name is in the list, she probably told her friends about you and they're trying to search for clues to see how you feel about her.    6. Look out for the damsel in distress. If you're outside and the girl you like is nearby and starts loudly saying "I'm cold!", that's a subtle hint that she wants you to give her your sweatshirt. This is a very sweet gesture, especially if you want to show the girl that you like her. If there are other guys and she likes one of those guys, however, she might act disappointed when you offer yours to her first, in which case at least you'll know how she feels and can move on. Sometimes a girl will pretend to be really bad at something, and say that they can't do it. That is your cue to offer some assistance, and she will most likely be doing this on purpose just to see your reaction.    7. Smile at her. Do a natural smile - don't freak her out. If she smiles politely, or frowns and looks away, say goodbye to her. She is obviously freaked out by you. If she returns a soft or big smile and continues to look at you, then she is interested. If she smiles then darts over to the crowd of her friends and hides in the group then she may be nervous and curious if you know that she likes you.    8. Her Hair If she tugs on her hair or plays with it,when she is around your or when she sees you come into a room, it means she's nervous. She's nervous about seeing you.    9. Staring Depending on how much she likes you and how good of an actress she is, she can give you long looks when your not looking or glance at you.    10. Hallway If you see her walking down the hallway, she'll look at you once, quickly. She'll probably smile, but you know, try to contain it.

It is a little teapot looking thing that has a spout and you put warm water (not too warm) mixed with non iodized salt.  You tilt your head and pour it up your nose and it flows through that nasal cavity and out the other nostril.
SNsr2tzyaa	I don't really understand what you did wrong...To me it looks like you had a crappy friend and that's it. From what I read it just appears she was jealous, this person really does not deserve you. So when your feeling guilty just think, "What did I even do?" Have friends? Be liked by other people? You should never be sorry for those things. And remember, life does not revolve around you. No not like your thinking, I mean it as in just because something is going wrong with someone, there is just as likely a chance that it is not YOU with the problem but your FRIEND. But a lot of the time we see it as our problem and we try to fix what does not need fixing, or blame our self when there is no blame needed at all. Not everything that happens in your life is from your decisions, its others decisions as well. If being around her remind you of that time when you felt guilty, then maybe it might be time to move on? You already took the first step by transferring, maybe you just need to leave it all behind you.

You'll repeat lessons until you learn them. When you forgive others, you forgive yourself. On a larger scale, We've already been forgiven by God, even though there are some religions that want us to believe that God is a punishing God, I don't believe that. I was raised catholic, but their interpretation just didn't work in my life or the world. That doesn't mean you can just do bad things, you'll still be accountable in this life. You sound like a normal teenager to me with normal confusion and fears. Think positive and towards the future.When I was in High School, I took a class for /about women (1975) learned from some older women (50's) that life gets better and more calmer in your twenties/thirties/forties. It did.  I'm in my early 50's now, so, I'm glad I enjoyed that time and learned from life as it gave me the skills and resiliance I needed to cope with a major illness that I have now. Be happy and grateful for the life you have and give to others, don't dwell on the bad stuff, there is enough of that going around as it is and always the  people that perpetuate it. you will learn that there are bad people and that bad things happen to good people, we are all learning and in this world together and just about everything that has happened in your life , has already happened to someone else, it's just how you deal with it and go on from their. I promise life will get better, even if there are rough times, something good always comes out, everything is for a reason and we don't have control over everything in life. I know. I thought I did,until I became ill. So, you learn to prioritize and don't sweat the small stuff or make mtns out of molehills. there are always people to help you and you can always help others.

I believe the drowsiness and "bombed out" feeling is definately a side effect especially when you up the dose. I now have to take it no later than 8 pm just to be able to function the next day. It works wonders though. Just figure out the right time to take it is all. Good luck.

It is their job to make you as comfortable as possible.|`|fHEt1Xj6aa	well being that it is your first time explain that you are a bit nerves and want ur doc to go over everything that will be done before the exam. and you should not have any problem..... good luck:)|`|PfE6bg5iaa	Well, obviously you'll ask about your breast pain    If you're curious, you can ask if your hymen is intact. It doesn't make a difference, but if it's not intact you're less likely to experience a lot of pain the first time you have sex. You can check that yourself tho:  http://www.youngwomenshealth.org/hymen.h...    Otherwise, there's really nothing to ask unless you're interested in starting hormonal birth control. Then you'll want to know about your options, side effects, effectiveness, possible complications....    Congrats on going to the gyno, a lot of women are so nervous that they just never go. It's good to be safe, get everything checked out down there, get your pap smear, etc. Just because you're a virgin doesn't mean you shouldn't go... the general rule is 18 or sexually active, whichever comes first.    Good luck!|`|2e103842ea492d6dca1571e0a0df8befaa	Since this will be your first visit. I think you should ask her what to expect during your visit. This can help to put your mind at ease. Find out other than coming for your annual check up, what are other times you would possibly need to come in for a visit. This is helpful for the future if you're experiencing pain or having abnormal periods, rather than going to see your regular family doctor, you should go see her.     I hope you have a great doctor. Oh and let her know about the pain in your boob(s). Could just be related to your period. But it's good to let her know so she can check just to make sure everything is fine. And so she's just aware and can make a note of it in your chart.

x3EPqezJaa	It's your shoes. I found that a great shoe for flat-footed people is the Brooks Beast. Brooks is a sneaker company. I used to have shin splints all the time--constantly. I could jog for one day and get shin splints. Even walking a lot one day could cause my shins to be super sore. Then, I got properly fitted in a running store for running shoes, and I haven't had any problems with shin pain AT ALL. NONE. I know this sounds like one of those paid testimonials, but believe me, it's not. I've never had such an extreme difference occur just from ONE product. It's that amazing. The situation is that that as a flat-footed person, you need MOTION CONTROL sneakers, and the Brooks Beast is the best there is at Motion Control. Every other major brand of sneaker  does have a motion control shoe, though, so if you'd prefer another brand, just be sure to ask for motion control, when you go to the store. Any good running store will know exactly what I'm talking about. So if it's OK for you to wear sneakers at work, then get these. You should get your first pair in a running store, so you can try them on. Brooks shoes tend to run small, so it's recommended that people get a full size larger than they usually take. With such variation, you've really got to try them on and see. But after that first pair, there are a few on-line running stores that have them a bit cheaper than brick-and-mortar stores. See:   http://www.roadrunnersports.com/rrs/prod...  or  http://www.kellysrunningwarehouse.com/cg...
bf91d06b562880a5c61ff5e05223f4f5aa	Here... Read this:   How to Calculate Your Protein Needs:     1. Weight in pounds divided by 2.2 = weight in kg  2. Weight in kg x 0.8-1.8 gm/kg = protein gm.     Use a lower number if you are in good health and are sedentary. Use a higher number (between 1 and 1.8) if you are under stress, are pregnant, are recovering from an illness, or if you are involved in consistent and intense weight or endurance training.     Example: 154 lb male who is a regular exerciser and lifts weights  154 lbs/2.2 = 70kg  70kg x 1.5 = 105 gm protein/day     The Ensure website shows that each serving of its shake gives you 26 percent of your minimum daily requirement of protein.

pfm0wcEIaa	My mother always told me that was lack of vitamin A.  I haven't read any literature, but it seems to work for me just fine.  I see those speckles on and off.  And I too get my eyes checked regularly and never had anything wrong.  The speckles go away after a few days of taking or eating vitamin A.    Make sure you get some good vitamin A supplement or just eat lots of carrots.  Vitamin A may be harmful if you take it in large amounts or if you drink excessively or smoke.  In order to ensure it causes good and not harm, you should make sure the pill is free of hydrogenated oils and that you take it along with a vitamin C supplement as well.    ... And that is why it is probably just easier to eat a bunch of carrots or drink carrot juice instead.    You should do this for three days or so.  On the third day, you should start seeing results.

HbQmDGb6aa	Force yourself to go to bed at night, and get up early and stay up all day. Even if you can't fall asleep at night, stay there. Your only problem is that you aren't doing anything to expend your energy in the daytime (or night, for that matter) so you have no urgent need to sleep. You said yourself you do nothing productive. So do something!  You don't want medicine-I'm a big believer in only natural remedies myself, I think meds only make everything worse. But even if I didn't believe that, I wouldnt suggest medicine. There's nothing wrong with you!! You just need to do something throughout the day. Go exercise, park at the farthest side of the lot, take stairs, don't sit around all day being unproductive. Bodies are meant to move. When you're only moving enough to do everyday living, you're not going to be tired simply because you're not doing enough.  Don't eat too much past 7 or 8, and limit caffeine to the morningtime.   Just discipline your body into getting back to a normal cycle. It's easy, just stick to it.|`|fb00332ba009d82d6e7d60255fbc96bfaa	you sound unemployed.  you need to find a physically exhausting hobby, exercise or a job. or find a natural herb that you can smoke at night to relax your restless mind and body.|`|hUynmdRSaa	For a while if I went to sleep before 12, I only slept for 4 hours. If I was still awake after 12, I didn't sleep at all. Eventually my dad started giving me his sleeping pills that could knock out a horse really early and I started sleeping. He did this for a few days until I could get a sleep cycle going. Now I go to sleep early every night and get great RPM sleep. I completely understand not wanting to take pills. I hate taking pills for anything. I suggest trying to stay awake by going out with a friend or something active. Do NOT drink an energy drink. These are horrible and even worse when your this tired. Just try to stay awake until about 9 or 10 or whenever you would like a good bedtime to be. Then go to sleep. After a few days your body should adjust.    I'm sorry this was so long but I hope it helped.|`|1aagL3uvaa	Here's what I like to do when I can't sleep:    Try banging your head on something REALLY HARD.  Works every time =]

I must say that I used to be forgetful when taking my medications, so when I restarted Zoloft I got the side-effect of nausea. So, I stopped again, and sure, I felt great for a while there. I thought I didn't need to take them anymore. NOT TRUE. 3 days later, I was close to suicidal again. My doctor switched me to a different antidepressant and I have not noticed any side-effects.

The other I tried for almost two months, and it never got better, so I stopped.  I have not had anything for a week now, and just noticed yesterday that I had no stomach trouble for the first time in two months.

vs5YwpzWaa	Hey,  Don't be worried, it's no big deal. I gave blood all the time. Just when you tell the nurses that its your first time and your a little scared. They'll treat you like a king.     Truth be told it's a lot of fun! They ask you a whole bunch of silly questions (like if you had sex with a black man in 1967, in the country of south african who had that drugs or money for sex, and who's sexual history you did not know)    Plus you get cookies at the end!    However you may want to mention about the whole gay thing.  I know where I live they don't let you give blood if your gay. After all "all gay people have aids" or at least that's what blood Canada likes to assume.     But otherwise go for it, go be a hero and save three lives!|`|mkI36iQJaa	it doesn't hurt.|`|1DE9uaBqaa	u are already brave as it iss!!!    and yes just ask for a fully trianed nurse whose been in the business for a while, usually at blood drives, they give u all the beginners, soo do wat ever u can to stay away, just say u want the other one cus she "looks lik ur mom" and is comforiting ahah any excuse would work, but yea try and work out or lift somethin heavy b4 the shot, so ur viens pop out more!|`|tOgw5jzuaa	I'm 17 also and I gave blood in a high school blood drive for the first time this last November. I was also really scared because I've had bad luck having blood drawn at the doctor's office in the past. However, the people were really nice and it went well! The needle goes in quickly and though it hurts at first, they give you a little sponge to squeeze  the rest of the process is pain-free. Afterwards you get a bandage and you basically feel no pain. Plus, you have the satisfaction of knowing you saved three lives! Make sure you drink lots of water and eat raisins or veggies at some point before giving blood, that's what I did because it keeps your iron levels high which you need to give blood.    I actally felt so good about what I did that I ended up giving blood again a few days ago. The second time was just as easyas the first. Don't be scared, it really doesn't hurt. Good luck!|`|AA10756487	Don't worry. The nurses that are at the blood drive always have methods for finding veins if they are not readily accessible. Everything will be fine as the nurses are all qualified and know what they are doing. You will be briefed on the whole thing and if anything you can always contact the nurses.    I gave blood 3 times before and the experience was fine.|`|qGaTcEliaa	No it doesnt hurt   it feels just like a pinch|`|qoukd2Gmaa	Its nothing to be scared about. I HATE needles and given blood at my high school twice. Its a quick pinch and you can barely feel it. After they put it in you sit there and wait for it to fill up a bag. You can chat with your friends while doing it. The plus out of it is you save up to 3 lives, get food and drink afterwords, and get out of class.|`|o9oc0GxZaa	I hate getting my blood drawed even though i like blood it just freaks me out! and i have to go get it done soon cuz im on a new medicine =( and it dont hurt it only stings and when they put the rubber band on your arm  i make them tak eit off cuz it hurts me :)|`|SohrsIBoaa	your going to go through a lot more pain then a little tiny needle in your life. im sitting here with a shattered femur bone on a lot of pain killers that do NOTHING wishing for only a needle to be stuck in my arm. you'll be fine kid. and think of the person your blood is going to go into and how much your helping someone live by that one little baby needle. good luck.|`|dGM6JGqdaa	Hey man don't worry if they can't find a good vein they will use a bigger needle and stick you in you neck you know the Jugular Vein so don't panic they want your blood so they will figure a way to get it !

They aren't going to use you for target practice.  I'd be surprised if it takes more than one poke to hit the target.  When you draw blood, you don't aim at what you see, you aim at what you can feel and where you know a vein should be.  That's what all the rubbing and poking is about before you get stuck with a needle.  If they can't feel the vein, they don't stab at it.  Being stuck to give blood isn't the worst pain in the world, you know?  There are lots of things that  hurt far worse, and you have already survived a good many of them.  Ever stub your toe?  Cut yourself?  Skinned a knee or elbow?   At least the poke to give blood is quick and it only hurts for a second.  I suggest you focus your mind elsewhere when the time comes, grit your teeth, and think about the person who will be very grateful for your donation effort.  And keep in mind, life has a few hurts to come that will make that needle poke seem like a walk in the park.  Trust me, there.  Roll up your sleeve, grit your teeth, and give a unit.  You will be glad you did.
uKmNYqGgaa	I take generic Wellbutrin SR (150 mg) in the morning, and Lexapro (10 mg) in the evening, for depression and anxiety.  I've been taking that for over two years, and it's working very well for me.     The Wellbutrin SR seems to help me to be more alert and active - and wanting to do things - while the Lexapro makes me more mellow, and it helps me sleep better, too.  They are relatively low doses of each medication, which keeps side effects at a minimum.  I really can't tell I'm taking any medication at all.|`|yorfmfiBaa	I am on it...it will make you sleepy, but i lost 20 lbs and im doing better at my job. :) no more snapping off and i dont need as much coffee. good stuff.|`|uomYVsiLaa	great product only had one side effect took extra time and was difficult to shall we say to um hmmmm erupt the volcano not like that's a bad thing (lol) other then that everything worked fine and I felt great on it!

UZJ7wVc8aa	Gaining weight & muscle is a two step process: you have to eat more and lift weights or engage in some sort of strength training routine.    The most important rule to remember if you want to gain weight is to eat more calories than you burn. Only by doing this can your body use the excess energy to build muscle. If you eat less than you burn, there is no way to gain weight, it's as simple as that. Your first step is to figure out how many calories your body burns per day. Use this calculator http://calorieneedscalculator.com  to get an estimate. Now eat more than you burn and you're on your way to gaining muscle.    Gaining weight is as simple as eat more than you burn but if you want to gain muscle, you also need to exercise. If you just ate more without lifting weights, you'd just gain fat and become unhealthy and overweight. When you lift weights (or participate in any strength training) you're actually causing some damage to your muscles.     When you rest, your body uses those extra calories to repair and rebuild the muscles. When this process is complete, the muscle is stronger and a bit bigger than it was before. You obviously won't notice a difference right away, but over time you will find yourself becoming stronger and bigger.    You need to keep your diet clean to gain the right kind of weight. Stay away from sugary and simple carb foods such as candy, foods made with white flour, soda and other junk. These foods will promote fat storage, something you don't need. Stick to foods made from whole wheat flour, oats, brown rice, lean sources of protein (chicken, some cuts of beef, fish), nuts, beans, legumes and protein shakes - yum yum. If you need more details, go to the Guide to Gaining Muscle -  http://straighthealth.com/pages/guides/g...|`|IFqlSDGeaa	well try to eat more protein like red meat and more vitamins Protein is very important if u want to gain weight

These people are non judgmental and they deal with teen pregnancies and stuff, I am reasonably sure they would talk to you on the phone and tell you how confidential they are.  I of course live in Canada, I do not know where you live or the things available in other countries.    One thing you can try on your own, it is not a sure indicator but a pretty good one.  Try inserting one finger and if it is tight and you could not insert a second one you are a virgin.  If you can get two but not three and it is very tight and somewhat uncomfortable you are probably a virgin.  If however there is no tightness no matter how many you try, your hymen has probably been broken.  Hope this helps.|`|dALX1qQdaa	did you bleed? if he did rape you, it is very serious|`|OI3bf4yjaa	You are a virgin until you have sex. It doesn't matter if your hymen was broken - unless you've had actual sex.. you're still a virgin.|`|N19mmDELaa	i think u should try talking to your mom. it might be hard at first but it'll be better for her to know than not know. i use to keep things from my mom. i found it easier to talk about it to her than hide it. and if u cant talk directly to her, email her or txt her.  then u can take it from there and see a doctor about it.|`|5Sd8UunSaa	u r still a virgin if u didn't have sex yet|`|1f644ebbaa	No there is no way to tell, the only way is to just "know." A doctor couldn't tell because there's always the possibility that your hymen was broken as a child by playing sports or horseback riding. I don't know what the situation with your brother is, but if you can, you should ask him. Im 98% asking him is the only way you will ever know. There is HOWEVER a chance you will know, when you do decide to have sex. If your hymen hasn't been broken there is a chance you will bleed a bit. Not all girls bleed but there is a chance you will. If you do bleed there a good chance you were still a virgin. Sorry to hear about what happened, I would hate not knowing. Good luck.|`|XFYOQOOdaa	Its would be too hard to tell if you were actually a a virgin.  A girls hymen can tear from things other than sex like inserting tampons, masturbation, etc.  you could probably go to some kind of clinic that would be anonymous.|`|glfVdxanaa	omg where is your brother now...u shld go to the geyno they noe right away if your a virgin or not
47Sn5nnxaa	Make it a lifestyle change- not just a diet. This way, you will set yourself up for sucess, not failure. Make small changes instead of big ones, like portion sizes and monitoring fat content, etc. Make sure you do it the healthy way- no "only 19.95!" diets- (including acai...) just good ol'fashion diet and exercise. Remember- .........who-... you-...are... Simba...---|`|OySU2oAkaa	1. water    2. interval training (30 min of low and high intensity mixed)    3. doing a lot of cardio at least 2 times a week if you don't play a sport    4. greens for dinner and fiber in the morning (for energy)    5. no alcohol or soda whatsoever    6. chewing gum to curb appetite (mint does that)    7. plenty of protein! can't stress this enough    muscle confusion workouts are good too if you want to get a good toned body. for more info you can always check out http://i-dietandfitness.com    hope that helps!|`|B12E4rYiaa	To lose the weight you need to have a calorie chart and log everything you eat and drink it all counts. You need to eat smaller portions and no seconds. Eat low calorie low fat foods. Eat healthy low fat snacks like apples or other fruits.     Do small doable goals don't think of it as losing 100 pounds that's too much to think about. Think about losing 5 pounds at a time, set a goal to lose 5 pounds then keep resetting the 5 pound goal and before you know it those 5 pound goals will add up to 100 pounds.     If you feel like emotional eating call a friend instead of eating and talk to them instead this will take your mind off of food.    Try to workout in the mornings it's the best time then you get it done so if you're tired later you won't blow it off. Do cardio you need to get your metabolism to speed up to burn fat. Add weight training in there if you can so you will be toned after you lose and not flabby.    You can do it, but you must start and not put it off.|`|JAwhXqljaa	Do regular exercise..eat less Junk ..instead of the burgers and french fries eat fruits and veggies..and drink more water as u feel full...eat half grapefruit before every meal .It makes u feel fuller and u dont overeat.

WDN3SAwwaa	It is very impressive to know you are so deeply concerned about your mother's mental health. Sometimes what appears to be the problem, really isn't the problem. There may be deeper issues that you are unaware of, and perhaps your mother isn't really aware of them either.  This isn't really a great place to attempt to sort through such a deep, personal issue, especially since you are not too likely to obtain reliable information here on Yahoo Answers.  I believe it would be a good bet to look around within your own environment to find someone to help your mom. Perhaps she has a close friend or family member, someone at work or church or even a family doctor who could offer her support, that is if she wants help. Not everyone is willing to open up and try to overcome her problems. Perhaps she doesn't even believe she has a problem, it's hard to say. Best wishes for finding a way to help her through the tough times.|`|6jXuUCdraa	take her to a beauty salon and you both could get make overs     do her hair     tell her shes beautiful    talk to her and ask her if everythings okay    get a gym member ship together if shes worried about the weight     if her hairs so bad get a wig    theres always eye surgery that could easily fix a lazy eye|`|hKax9Jl6aa	Go somewhere and treat her like a queen that she is!

XvGQq1gBaa	Wow im glad someone asked this question.  I personally think that Muscle Tech products cost WAY to much.  I mean paying like $70 for something thats going to last 2 weeks or so.  My advice is go to ebay and find someting comparible.  If money is not an issue and you still want a good muscle tech product I would try the Vapor.  I have heard when you take this you have incredible strength gains and insane mental focus. Best of luck|`|ngkQckpEaa	you should try glutamine and creatine. creatine hydrates the muscle and will help you be able to bulk up.|`|1HEWFvmZaa	I think Gakic is the best Muscle Tech Product.

e60910afcb632aae09c5ff7f00635a4aaa	The closest thing available over the counter is the acrylic fingernail stuff.  (Like Lee nails)  Use some clay that hardens to push over the fronts of the teeth (or plaster if you have it... just make sure the teeth are wet). Once it is set, paint in vaseline then press in some soft clay to make the positive of the teeth.  Once that is set, paint those with Vaseline and apply the Lee nails acrylic (wet the brush, then pick up powder and tap it in place).  Use an X-acto knife to trim away excess after it sets.  The material is roughly tooth colored.  Glue them in place with denture glue (clear)|`|DzHB8z6Yaa	How to Create a Fake Tooth out of Putty  Step1Mix the alginate according to manufacturer recommendations in the porcelain cup with the plastic spoon. You need about one tablespoon.     Step2: Pour the finished mix into the mouth guard.     Step3: Gently bite down on the mouth guard to create an imprint of your teeth. Do this over a paper towel to allow any overage to drip down. Do not swallow the material!     Step4: Wait until the alginate putty sets. Usually this only takes about three minutes, but depending on the brand you chose, it may take up to five. Gently probe the mouth guard with your tongue to get a feel of the alginate. If it feels pretty rubbery, it is time to remove the mold.     Step5: Open your mouth and lift the mouth guard off your teeth. Try doing this in a straight motion to avoid any snags or rips, especially if the alginate went in between tight fitting teeth.     Step6: Set aside the mold; brush, floss and rinse your teeth. Remove any alginate that might have stayed behind in your mouth. Although the material is rated as food grade and thus not toxic, it makes for a rather weird feeling if you keep it in your mouth and it begins to gradually disintegrate because of any foods you are eating.     Step7: Take a paper towel and gently dab dry the mold of your teeth you created.     Step8: Allow the mold to set completely. In the meantime, mix another smaller batch of the alginate putty. You are now going to create a fake tooth out of the putty using your very own cast!     Step9: Carefully pour the mix into the mold you fashioned. Fully set alginate will not bond to itself so you should have no problem removing the putty tooth once it had a chance to set.     Step10: Cut apart the set of teeth and excise just the one tooth you want to use.     Step11: Paint your tooth using professional tooth paint which is also used on dentures. Your finished product is now an example of how to create a fake tooth out of putty.

Or she's afraid to talk to her mom about it.

When it comes to her pubes, you SHOULD mind your own business. Maybe you think a thick bush is gross, but maybe she likes it that way - and it's HER body, not yours.     Not only that, but I'd bet money that you were at least a little insulting or mean when you told her. You say you "confronted" her - why on earth would you CONFRONT someone in that manner, about that sensitive a subject? You could have just taken her aside and said "Pssst...dude...your pubes are kinda showing right here..." then show her where. If you got in her face and used words like "gross" and whatever else, it's not surprising that she got angry with you.     You seriously owe your friend an apology. Seriously.

Just eat a whole lot less|`|j4hmUPJgaa	Wow, 800 calories a day is kind of nuts, but I will tell you low fat foods that should keep you somehwat full. You need to know that if you currently are  not on a diet that  a dramatic cut in calories can have the reverse effect. For example- your body is used to so many calories a day, if you go down that dramatically without excercise it could store what little food it is getting as fat because your body doesn't know when you will feed it properly again.  Now that I have told you the bad news, here is the good news.  Progresso soup has weight watcher points on them- these soups are as little as 60 calories per serving (or 120 for the whole can). I suggest you try & eat a can of soup for dinner with a grilled cheese (on low fat wheat bread with 2% cheese & low fat butter). That meal will cost you minimal calories- about 360. Try getting slim fast shakes or meal bars to consume for breakfast & lunch. Go with a shake for breakfast (190 calories) & a meal bar for lunch (220 calories) & that will leave you with 30 calories to spare I think. However, you should try to eat some fruit throughout the day. A nectarine with your meal bar wont ruin your crazy diet! You'd go over by a few calories, but you'd be fine. If you want to lose a pound a week, you need to cut out like 3000 calories that week from your normal schedule. Just don't be silly & starve yourself.|`|k4iUVgMcaa	Im not going to lecture, but here are some tips that have helped me on my reduced calorie diet.   -eat frequent small meals. purpose being to significantly boost your metabolism, thus burning more calories faster.  -snacks AREN'T bad if you eat healthy ones (low cal yogurt, fruit)  -high fiber foods (like bran flakes) help curb hunger tremendously!    ALSO NOTE, that once these "few weeks" are over, unless you maintain healthy eating habits, the weight will come back on in no time. Take into consideration possibly increasing to 1000-1200 calories as you will be burning calories a LOT faster with frequent small meals.    Hope this helped.|`|lAgN6bpgaa	Ok, no lectures but when you're dying with a skeleton bod, call me. Please I did this, i got VERY sick and almost collasped. It's NOT GOOD!!! Eat 1,200, burn 500 Calories and there you go. If you eat that much (800) you're skin will get all saggy and your face will look like a vajajay. TRUST ME.|`|B12E4rYiaa	The problem is not it being bad the problem is that it will slow your metabolism down to a crawl and that's really bad since it's metabolism that burns the fat. You want to speed it up not slow it down.    Your body will go into starvation mode and to protect itself it will slow down your metabolism then it's very hard to get it back up so you will gain weight quickly.     You will defeat your purpose. It's best to eat 1200 calories and exercise 3-5 days doing cardio to speed up your metabolism so that even while resting you will burn fat.
uJKTR4d2aa	First of all, all your disorders are part of being bipolar. not seperate. Bipolar is a vague term for 8 million disorders in 1 which is stupid in my opinion. but however,    im diagnosed "severe manic depression with psychotic features" so i know how you feel.    You do need to go to the hospital if you feel like killing yourself. they dont just shove you on the street. I have no insurance and they have taken me in twice now, even to the er when i attempted suicide, and even lowered my bills from over 20K to now 500 dollars.|`|2fZQkMuUaa	My Wife didnt have insurance and she went threw all of this, over time it got worse, she finnally went to the doc and they started to get her the treatment/ help/ meds ect that she needed.  if she had gone sooner iit wouldnt have been as hard as it was.  That was 16 year ago, she is doing better, so keep on fighting, u are needed on this earth by more than u know.|`|037b3afb94b00bdfef7a62639de1add1aa	I know you said no hospital, so here is an alternative. Prayer.  God can heal you from anything. Seek out a priest, pastor, someone, Keep a prayer journal, believe you can and will be healed.   I will pray for you. Email me if you need help!
RVicFEyFaa	Awww honey, your selling yourself short just because you don't have a fat purse or insurance. The freebie system of mental health care is YES, a crap shoot, depending. You don't mention your area. Lets talk first about the immediate benefits of certain "freebies" that you would qualify for. If your brain is talking you need some med. support to pull you through, something gained as easily as calling 911 or your local hospital & asking for a mental health mobile unit to come to your address, they will give you a paper for a prescription. Lithium is a drug that can have immediate results, though I would recommend it short term ( i'm on the fence about long-term), until you have your bearings. Your too special to die, don't be so vulnerable to not get certain armor on your side. I've been there, have been there poor too. I'd still like to blame certain mirages on Ghosts LOL, but I came around through initial drug support & free therapy...I made a 3 session call if that person was ideal for me or not, but I kept at it & found the fit. How can you really do this by yourself.?! Our friends arn't objective enough, our family gets crazy worried, that alone can make one worse ! Our daily norm. can become a stage. Your sensitive & bright I can denote that  from your post, you just need a lift. Group helped me alot, man I thought I was the worst or the least suffering...BAM listening to anothers suffering, or experience was uplifting & enlightening, Also free. Even if your sitting across from an x-crack head that succombed to bi-polar, your day will be full. I know it sucks, but it rocks everyday you find yourself again & the new self that can submerge from something like this, can be amazing. I wasn't a brain before it, nor knew great humor, am now !. Don't get stuck, your not alone. You've gotten your feet wet having been diagnosed, I wouldn't put too much emphasis on that either. Though "breakdown" isn't regognized in the phsic. books, it often is a temporary loss of mind. If yours is perminate you will know once you have better self-esteem & mental health guidence. Relinquish yourself to maybe having bouts of this your entire life....you'll have the tools to deal w/it. Keep a journel of what your head say's it can be crypt from a childhood trauma or even a past life. Be specially intune to how you take care of yourself, some of us deserve a medel for just getting out of bed (we can enjoy our lives too !!!). E-mail me if you want to. This can be conquered, but you have to be willing to work with the supply.|`|GoluIRIAaa	I know you don't want to go to the hospital or anything but you desperately need to go to a psychiatrist if you REALLY don't want to do that try calling a local mental health line. Not treating these problems could be dangerous and I would really recommend you talk to someone     Eating disorders: 1-800-665-1822  Mental health line: -800-661-2121|`|tNhL3tfdaa	Call suicide hotline.

HRAqdnGfaa	yea, that is a good work out, i personally would do more pull ups and push ups and skip the bench.  also try to do some bicycles or something to get your obliques|`|oTHGgowsaa	Sounds good, but instead of 7 reps of 7, add more weight until you can only do 3 reps of 7-10, and if your really looking to build muscle rather than just tone, make sure your getting 0.88 to 2 grams of protein per pound you weigh daily. Also, working until you can't anymore is very effective in building muscle, so have a spotter when you bench, and bench until your muscles completely fail, doing this will cause your muscles to tear far more, and therefore repairing more, building it up. It's extremely important to get the protein in you to build these muscles up after you work them to failure, just as important, you'll need to rest more, maybe even a few days at a time to let your pecs and arms rebuild.|`|5xfJBapNaa	u should but at least 25 on the curls and try 100 situps leg lifts are good try 40 pushups and 5 pullups is good|`|7pkxOc6Raa	No, looks like crap.

OhyEivqbaa	ewww don't do it again! It can cause HAIRY TONGUE!!! No joke! Or mouth cancer...    but to answer your question it wont effect you long term just doing it once, it'll only effect you short term...    HAIRY TONGUE! google it! You'll never go near that stuff again!|`|UYDAOJxcaa	If you brush and maybe mouthwash (tobacco is stinky) you should be fine, but only if you don't do it again!!!!!!!                   Good Luck!       Ry|`|cCxK6MKQaa	Chewing Tobacco will not affect you the very first time and for less than one minute. If you chew for months/years is when you have a chance of cancer or mouth problems. My advise is dont even mess with the stuff, i have been addicted to chewing tobacco for 12 years and its not worth it|`|6kZpsumdaa	It was stupid to have done it in the first place. Just use some Listerine or whatever mouthwash you have. Scrub your teeth with your toothpaste and cleanse with a lot of water (yet properly). Then, get a breath mint or some ice-cold gum and chew sor at least 10 minutes. Well, it would have any long-term effects, and probably you won't have any short-term effects either. you might, however, get a little rash or itch (but that is highly unlikely, but can happen). You breath, hands, and teeth must smell really bad -- so clean yourself up! Never do it again!!

kK4GG6Z2aa	Believe it or not she could actually be constipated.  You say she gets diarrhoea...the bowel will often pass 'watery' substance because it can't pass hard faces.  this will cause gas, and cramps and will cause severe bloating and the gurgles and growls you can hear.  It is probably not her stomach you see moving..but her digestive system which is massive.. and is probably clogged up.  Also back pain is another symptom as the bowel will push on the spine and cause pain. I know this as i am on a lot of pain killers for a disability and am often constipated this causes me terrific back pain.  However I don't think it wise to tell you what medication I take as I am not a doctor and my suggestions on diagnosis may not be correct.  I doubt if she has worms as she would have itching around her anus.  One way (this may sound stupid but it works) of finding out if you have worms is to place selotape on anus at night...as this is when worms come out..they will show up on the selotape.  Others may think I am joking but I am serious.  I was advised to do this to my daughter once..as she had itching in that area and had been in contact with dogs.  Using over the counter medication for symptoms such as these are of no help and could in fact disguise the real problem and be dangerous.  She may be embarrassed to see her doctor but as a good friend you would be really helping her if you advised her to go and perhaps offer to go with her.  Doctors have seen and heard it all before so try and encourage her to see her doctor as soon as possible.  My guess though that it really is constipation.|`|TEyzimuYaa	Yes.

As such I'm going to give you the benefit of many years of health and nutrition classes and do my good deed for the year.    I'm going to tell you how to not only lose weight but change the composition of your body, increase your health, and best of all.. keep it off.    First, let's dispel some common myths.    Myth 1:  Eating less calories will make me lose weight.  Unfortunately this isn't always true. A lot of different factors program your metabolism but one of the key things is how OFTEN you eat. If you fast all day long and then have a 500 calorie meal at the end of the day almost ALL of it will be stored by your body.    Myth 2:  I can have a diet with no carbs and be healthy.  This really is a testament to how much Americans want a quick fix. Diets like the Atkin's Diet cause your body to start devouring itself, increase your cholesterol, and in certain cases can even kill you. One thing I WON'T argue, death will indeed cause you to lose weight, permanently.    Myth 3:  If I go on a diet I will lose weight.  99% of people who go on diets will end up putting on MORE weight than they lost from a diet. This is because diet is supposed to be a LIFESTYLE change, not something you do for 2 weeks. If you starve your body it will make fat cells and increase their size even faster.    Myth 4:  I need to go out and exercise to lose weight.  This isn't actually true but it's important to say that having daily activities WILL keep you healthy. If you burn almost no calories every day what else do you think your body is going to do with them? Balancing a healthy lifestyle with a good diet is what you want here, not killing yourself by running every afternoon.    Myth 5:  The scale in my bathroom gives me a good idea of how healthy I am.  The dreaded bathroom scale does NOT tell you how healthy you are. Let's say I have 10 lbs of fat, don't drink water, and have little muscle mass. Then I work out for 3 months and hydrate every day. I lose 5 lbs of fat but gain 7 lbs of muscle and 3 pounds of average water weight. What will happen when I look at the scale? Are you being fair to yourselves? Judge yourself by how you feel, not what a spinning number under your feet tells you.        With these common myths out of the way I'll tell you the secret. It's five simple steps.    ~~The Anshar Diet~~  1. Only eat until you are no longer hungry.  This does NOT mean that you starve yourself. It means after you take a few bites of food ask yourself if you're still hungry. If you're not, into the fridge it goes. While we're at it, CHEW YOUR FOOD. at least 10 times per bite (using common sense if you're eating applesauce, this isn't an excuse to be an idiot).    2. Eat at least 6 (more if your schedule allows) meals a day.  I know this seems counterintuitive, but hear me out. If you eat 6-8 meals a day the meals are very small (often around 100-200 calorie "snacks"), provided you are only eating until you are NOT HUNGRY. When your body is not hungry your metabolism will not try to store energy as fat. It really is that simple. Smaller meals aid in digestion, they increase the nutrition you get from your food, and they keep you from being lethargic. If you eat when you're hungry your body stores MORE of it as fat ("Hmm. I'm hungry, I don't know where my next meal will come from! I'd better hold onto this.")    3. Eat BEFORE you get hungry.  Schedule your 6-10 meals throughout the day and stick to them. If you're waiting until you get hungry to eat you've already screwed this up. Your body stores energy if you're hungry, if your body sees food and just takes what it needs then you're running at optimum efficiency. This is called programming your metabolism.    4. Eat breakfast. Always.  Your first meal of the day is also the meal you have no choice over being hungry for. Your body has been replenishing itself all night and needs fuel. Since now you KNOW that hunger means you store your food then that means you want to keep breakfast LIGHT. A cup of cereal and a banana. A granola bar and an apple. LIGHT does NOT mean you skip breakfast. If you skip breakfast you are telling your metabolism to turn ALL of the next meal you eat into stored fat.    5. Drink water.  (I'm a big hypocrite on this one, but I can't stress it enough) Most people think that if they pick up a glass of orange juice instead of a soda they're doing themselves a favor, and that's not entirely true. A glass of orange juice can have just as many calories as some sodas. Try looking at the label sometime. If you're thirsty, drink water. If you love your soda then have your soda (real soda, not diet, artificial sweetners have been argued to be one of the worst things to ever happen to western civilization). If you decide to have a drink to treat yourself, pour yourself a half glass, don't take a can or bottle with you and for go

The air is colder and drier and you need a cleanser for sensitive skin and a moisturizer daily.  Try a gentle exfoliating cleanser a couple of times a week to get rid of the dead skin layers that are peeling.  Follow with a mild astringent like witch hazel and a moisturizer, of course.  You might just have to play around with different kinds until you find one that doesn't break you out.

aapuQ5u2aa	Well it seems like you definitely have depression and some kind of paranoia or anxiety. Anti-depressants to dont really help anything, because all they do is overload your energy with bad chemicals.    The best way to remedy depression by yourself is to make some good friends. If you have any really close friends, especially the opposite gender, talk to them about your problems. I guarantee that they will be understanding and be able to help you. It's such a relief to get all the pressure off your shoulders, JUST by talking about it. Another way you could just let out your feelings, if you don't trust anyone to that extent, is to talk to (if your in school still, the guidance counselor) or you could schedule an appointment with a psychologist/therapy.    I go through this daily, but I have some friends that are girls that are just my life savers. If they didn't listen to all the crap that I tell them and guide me through life, I'm not sure where I would be now.     I really hope this makes a difference in your life. I know it works for me.

But mostly , Know that what you are goin through is very common and generally gets better over time . youre not WEIRD or alone .  chin up|`|wQWTQo4eaa	yeah, this is similar to the post i just wrote.  i'm going through the same thing.  i've tried about 6 medications, and they never really helped.  well except one kinda helped just a teeny teeny bit but not much at all, so i wantedt something better but i haven't found anything that really works. therapy hasn't helped, it actually makes me feel worse when i talk to my therapist about my problems.  it's hard on my boyfriend that i am going through this. but he's there for me which is great.     from my anxiety and paranoia, it's so hard for me to talk to people.  i get anxiety even over using yahoo answers sometimes unfortunately.   i've been going through this whole anxiety thing for a really long time, but it has gotten worse in the last two years because some really bad stuff happened to me that traumatized me emotionally.      i really don't know what advice to give. i guess just talk to people who are going through the same thing as you.  i would say to see a therapist. that does help for some people.|`|e90oXWlzaa	OMG u remind me of me .....wat helped me was exersice go 1 time around the block everyday...trust me on this i really want to help cuase i know how that feels its the worst....an another thing ..GET PLENTTY SLEEP BUT NO NAPS!!!!....in teeling u from personal experience just trust me on this....ant depressents didnt work for me ...run!!! run your asss od swim a couple of times aorund the pool watever just try this for a week...trust me youl be much better|`|ParFJxnSaa	Self esteem/confidence is addressed in section 38, at http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris Some advice, and options: Volunteer, even from home, at first, to provide a solid basis in reality for the daily affirmations: "I am a good person, who is valued by my community, because I... (insert activity here)..". Section 47 also refers. On volunteering outside the home, you will come into contact with supportive people, and receive positive feedback for your efforts, which will be obviously appreciated; there are many options; one is sure to suit you. I have recently encountered another opinion, however, which is that, just as it is important to build a house on a solid foundation, so it is with self esteem. Learn to forgive yourself for your past mistakes, and failures, or inadequacies.     Accept that you, too are just a human being, with the frailties, insecurities, and tendency to err, occasionally, that the rest of us have. That is the beginning of self love, self acceptance, and self esteem. Regularly monitor your internal monologue (self talk): write down the negative ones: "I'm really ugly" and then the converse: "I'm fairly good looking", and next time you become aware that you are thinking the former, visualise, as vividly as possible, a big "STOP!!!" sign, and/or a stern faced person wagging a finger at you, and deliberately repeat 5 times, either aloud, in a big voice, if alone, or subvocally (to yourself, in your mind), the converse affirmation.     Habits take about 30 - 40 repetitions to become established, with most people. Make a list of all your good points, strengths, and achievements. Put it somewhere so you can easily refer to it, from time to time; perhaps on the refrigerator door, or print it; (large typeface, or capitalise) have it framed, and place in your bedroom, or in a position of prominence, such as on the television, or lounge room wall. Practise one of the relaxation methods on pages 2, 11, 2c, or 2i, daily, and when needed. Also, give the EFT a good tryout, to see if it helps you. Section 53 at ezy-build also refer.

AHk1r9wbaa	I was always the fat kid, the kid everyone picked last to be on their team in gym class.. the kid who had no friends, the one with the crazy mom and the possesive father who abused him.. I could go on, lol but I wanted to stand up for myself, to all the kids who continually called me different names, bullied me for my weight, teased me everyday and slapped me because they knew I was too self-concious to do a thing about it..    I started working out with a friend of mine who played baseball.. we basically ran everyday, I kind of walked/jogged..    My friend was kind of weak, and skinny and he wish he had my size, I wish I had his metabolism.. We were two whole different people but we helped eachother..    I knew I was strong, and if I got into a fight I could mess their shyt up..   He knew he was pretty fast, and was in really good shape, he just wanted to get stronger..    We both went on no-sugar diets, and we walked the treadmill everyday for 30 mins, then played basketball for an hour on Mon, Wed, Fri..    We worked out for an hour and did HIIT on Tues, Thurs, Sat, and we took a break on sundays..    In about a month, I noticed I could actually jog for about 3-4 minutes without getting tired, and a lot of kids at school asked me if I was losing weight which I thought was funny, then I did something I haven;t done in a long time.. I looked at myself in the mirror, and hell yeah i was about 10lbs lighter when I checked the scale..    My buddy on the other hand wasn't.. I felt bad for him, I was doing good and him, not-so-much.. So i spent the next week, in my free time, browsing diff articles about weight gain and gaining muscle.. stubled across diff protein shakes, that's when I started taking the shakes, and tweaked my diet.. ruled out fastfood and most other bad stuff for me.. I see about 50lbs loss that year, played football at linebacker.. got my bench from 135 to 275 in 2 years, weighin in at about 195..    I watched a lot of action films, like bloodsport, brucelee movies.. studied diff martial arts and ufc films.. did pushups everyday, situps everyday.. kept a journal of my workouts, and diet.. make workouts in studyhall a lot, tweaked them.. scheduled when i would have time for a candybar every few weeks.. in the long run it paid off.. I couldn't even do a pushup, now I can crank out 80 non-stop.. never dreamed of a pullup, even after i got a few pushups.. can do 30 nonstop, and 5-6 1 handed pullups.. rented a bunch of workout videos w/ my buddy, did some taebo, learned some diff judo flips from a cousin.. me and nathan joined the wrestling team together on a dare, ended up goin 16-3-1.. he was 10-1 he got injured in the middle of the season.. I learned a whole lot from my weight loss journey.. It's not really just a diet, a workout plan.. .. I changed how I felt about myself and how others feel about me.. Because I care for me, now other people can too..    My buddy got about 20lbs in the next 4-5 months.. That was 3 years ago, he used to weight 135 as a freshmen, now he's a meaty 198-200.. I feel like a totally different person, like I mean something in this world.. I kno how ya feel. Stick with it brother|`|coZ7Fm79aa	i was always the skinny prick a lil 5ft 4 95lber well i had very bad nutrition habits some days i didnt eat cuz i was sad some days i pigged out on junk after about 6 months of this i was playing a soccer game and passed out on the field i was hospitalized they said i had off balance electrolights and i need to go on a diet plan and fix it  i was stuck in a hospital for 9 days..9 damn days it sucked so i decided to get into bodybuilding and gain that weight that way not just getting fatter well 1yr later im 5ft  6 145lbs now cutting down a lil cuz i wanna be leanerbut still strong...and ive promised myself to never go back to my old habits this is what's keeping my body healthy and i just love it|`|HwxBL1B1aa	same **** man.  o yah  buh i was skinny then fat
AA11311516	apply a heating pad or make your own (get a big sock and fill with rice, tie it in a knot and put it in the microwave for a few minutes)     and put it on your stomach.    take pepto, mylanta or other stomach medicine. I like the heat it works best.
BoBHyKoAaa	This is the purpose, it is a spiritual one, it was put there as part of a blood covenant between your husband and God.  As a way of binding a man and a woman together as husband and wife as one with God. Some women do bleed during sport activities but not all of it is broken only when you are with a man is it broken and creates a covenant with that person and God.|`|kUE3Ddktaa	It really doesn't have a purpose.

The presence or absence of the hymen does not say much about a woman's sexual experience. Many women lose their hymen through physical activities such as bike riding, while others maintain their hymens even through early sexual experimentation.     It is true that most body parts have a function, but this doesn't necessarily imply original purpose. So we continue to speculate. Think of the hymen as an embryological dead end.

PUZbOj1waa	Before the pack finished you need to speak with you doctor in order for a new birth control regiment to be established.  Other than oral contraceptives there are internal methods that are permanent and temporary.  There is the patch that is a switched weekly and then left off for one week out of the month.    Overall, you need to speak with your doctor in order to narrow down your choices that fit you and your significant other best.|`|c5eaPg1faa	You need to speak with your doctor.

Also discuss protection methods with your doctor, everyone is different.|`|AA10836047	Unless you want withdrawl bleeding you should wait until the end of your pack. If the side effects are absolutely irritating than you can stop whenever you want but you will probably bleed for a few days or even a week. Have you tried any other type of birth control? What's the negative side effect for you? They make others with different levels of the hormones... even ones with no estrogen, just progestin. Maybe something like ortho-tri-cyclen-lo with lower levels of the hormones giving fewer side effects. Have you tried Mirena? They can take it out any time you want to conceive.

q9yGiIPUaa	Hon, this is normal. It just means you may have a little bit stronger feelings for her so it will take a little bit longer. If it seems she is flaunting her new found bf then maybe she is trying to make you jealous.   My advice is don't run from it by sitting at another table. You need to hit this head on because your going to have this for the rest of your dating life. Just go to school tomorrow with your head held high. When you sit there make it a point to say hi. You do not want to seem like an a hole. After you say hi just start talking to another friend and try not to notice that she is even there.   Try finding a new gf to get your mind off of it. If she was single then this probably would not be as hard but since she is with someone so soon you are feeling a little depressed because she has someone and you don't.|`|f9dnldJraa	dude, I've learned that you cant trust anything unless its on your belt. Try getting a hobby that involves guns. Even if its just seeing them in magazines and books. Learn military things like tactics, history, weapons, hand to hand combat. You might feel degraded and less of a man. But I tell you, women don't know what men really are. They like losers because they think they are "cool" then after their all second hand goods their looking for a real man. I say let them suffer like we real men had to in the beginning of our lives. Don't give them the satisfaction of being with a real man after they chose every one else first. I just picked up these hobbies and it doesn't bother me when some retarded girl thinks some looser is a better man. If you know your a man that's all that matters. Picking up such hobbies would help your self esteem as a man. Try Boy scouts or something. Your pretty bad *** if you have wilderness and survival skills. Like rambo or something. yeah, rambo. And don't tell anyone about your new hobbies unless they like them too.

Beyond that when she dies to settle her estate her house and belongings will be sold to pay expenses first and be divided among survivors second. This is true even if there is a will. You really need to get everything together and contact an attorney ASAP. It really isn't that expensive.|`|QcP1lJU5aa	If you mom doesn't have a will it would be much advised for her to do so. She can get a will done even if she has a terminal illness. All the will would need to have on it is that your mom is leaving everything to you. You would become her beneficiary. If something would happen to her before she gets a will, the state could get the house. The best thing to do is talk to your mom. I know you thinks it's hard for her to even go down that road, buts it's not. She will welcome the talk, sometimes it's hard for her to think about all that needs to be done. So, just open up with her and let her know you just want to make it easier on her and that you are willing to do what ever it takes for her. Now, with that being said, don't think your mom can't beat this thing. I have had cancer myself and know lots of women who were given a few months and they are still going strong. So, I will pray that your mom is one of the lucky ones that will shock the socks off the docs. Best of luck and may God Bless you both.

It also uses subliminal programing    I have used it for 5 years, and recommend it.    Also, if you have a good local library, you can find some really good CD's that you can convert to MP3 files    One thing I can promise is that whey your find a good one, you will really become to appreciate and use it on a regular basis.

al0cCPb6aa	Go to walmart or one of those stores. They have so many seasonsings that don't contain salt. Start playing with spices too...like rosemary, cilantro...all that stuff...does he like spicy food? Then try some chayenne powder. I try not to have a lot of salt or sugar because it's just bad for a person. Make some fish and chicken using just salt free seasonings...cook fish with lime juice and lemon juice for flaors and use different spices. Spices really make up for the lack of salt. You can really make anything with out salt as long as you're making it 100% fresh. When you make dinner...make extra so he'll have enough for lunch the next day.      I go crazing with seasons...I put whatever in whatever! haha, I love Italian seasoning which contains no salt, I use that in pracially anything.

djBMmP3Taa	So how can you fall asleep easily? Ideally without the use of sleeping pills or other drugs.    1. Soak in a long, hot bath    Taking a long bath (or even a shower if you haven't got a bath) will help your body to relax and get ready for sleep. Feel free to use bubble bath to add some "flavor" to the occasion.    2. Turn off the television    And the computer while you're at it. Television can be distracting and downright depressing if you choose the wrong channel. The computer - even if you're aimlessly surfing - will also keep your mind more active than it needs to be, which will harm your chances of getting to sleep.    3. Practice deep breathing    Take long, slow breaths in and out. Yawn a few times as well. This will help you slowly relax.    4. Play soothing sounds or music    If you've got a favorite CD that you relax to, play that quietly in the background. Or get hold of a nature's sound CD - whale music, sounds of the ocean, that kind of thing.    5. Stay calm and rational    Which is maybe easier said than done if you're stressing about not getting to sleep. Distract your mind. Maybe even get up and sit in your most comfortable chair. Chill out and do your best not to stress about not falling asleep.|`|RlPeaD8Qaa	dont munch on sugary foods before you go to sleep  Do as many pushups as you can, then crawl into bed. trust me, this works.  dont drink any caffeine within 8 hours of sleeping.|`|e7eb28bb492c5eedd55da24da0a04504aa	Generally, lack of sleep may result in[1][2]    aching muscles[3]   blurred vision (especially up close if you are farsighted and have glasses or contacts)[citation needed]   clinical depression[citation needed]   constipation   dark circles under the eyes[citation needed]   daytime drowsiness and naps, excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS)[citation needed]   decreased mental activity and concentration   delirium[citation needed]   depersonalization/derealization[citati... needed]   dizziness[citation needed]   fainting[citation needed]   hallucinations[4]   hand tremors[5]   headache[citation needed]   hyperactivity[citation needed]   hypertension[citation needed]   irritability[1]   loss of appetite   memory lapses or loss[6]   nausea[citation needed]   nystagmus (rapid involuntary rhythmic eye movement)[citation needed]   pallor[citation needed]   psychosis-like symptoms[citation needed]   severe yawning[1]   sleep paralysis (while awake)   slowed reaction time[citation needed]   slowed wound healing[citation needed]   slurred and/or nonsensical speech[citation needed]   synaesthesia   temper tantrums in children[1]   weakened immune system[citation needed]   weight loss or weight gain[citation needed]   symptoms similar to:   Attention-deficit Hyperactivity Disorder[1]   alcoholic intoxication[citation needed]    Effects on the brain  Sleep deprivation can adversely affect brain function.[8] A 2000 study, by the UCSD School of Medicine and the Veterans Affairs Healthcare System in San Diego, used functional magnetic resonance imaging technology to monitor activity in the brains of sleep-deprived subjects performing simple verbal learning tasks.[9] The study showed that regions of the brain's prefrontal cortex displayed more activity in sleepier subjects. Depending on the task at hand, the brain would sometimes attempt to compensate for the adverse effects caused by lack of sleep. The temporal lobe, which is a brain region involved in language processing, was activated during verbal learning in rested subjects but not in sleep deprived subjects. The parietal lobe, not activated in rested subjects during the verbal exercise, was more active when the subjects were deprived of sleep. Although memory performance was less efficient with sleep deprivation, greater activity in the parietal region was associated with better memory.    A 2001 study at Chicago Medical Institute suggested that sleep deprivation may be linked to more serious diseases, such as heart disease and mental illnesses, such as psychosis and bipolar disorder.[citation needed] A 2003 Universtity of California study found that REM sleep deprivation alleviates clinical depression. Although the mechanism is unclear it is suggested that the deprivation mimics the effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) however the study also indicated that REM sleep was essential for blocking neurotransmitters and allowing the neurotransmitter receptors to "rest" and regain sensitivity which in turn leads to improved regulation of mood and increased learning ability. Non REM sleep may allow enzymes to repair brain cell damage caused by free radicals. High metabolic activity while awake damages the enzymes themselves preventing efficient repair. The study observed the first evidence of brain damage in rats as a direct result of sleep deprivation.[10]    Animal studies suggest that sleep deprivation increases stress hormones, which may reduce new cell production in adult brains.[11]      Effects on growth  A 1999 study[12] found that sleep deprivation resulted in reduced cortisol secretion the next day, driven by increased subsequent slow-wave sleep. Sleep deprivation was found to enhance activity on the Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (which controls reactions to stress and regulates body functions such as digestion, the immune system, mood, sex, or energy usage) while suppressing growth hormones. The results supported previous studies, which observed adrenal insufficiency in idiopathic hypersomnia.|`|OWl6wfriaa	Get comfortable in your favorite PJ's, use a fan on low for white noise.  Try to clear your mind and concentrate on slow deep breathing.  Think of how you breathe when you ARE sleeping, and try to mimic that when trying to get to sleep.  Almost pretend like you are sleeping.  It really works for me.|`|UZxeBrxQaa	1.  No caffeine after noon.  2.  No heavy foods after supper.  3.  Go to bed at a given time every night.  4.  Room completely dark, no night lights.  5.  No noise, no music.  6.  No thinking.  Complete blank mind.  7.  Shut your eyes and concentrate on the darkness.  8.  Wake up.|`|EECePKs6aa	what about some warm milk? It helps :D|`|2308f20102f23791e696d293e30462a0aa	yeah....you've got 3 options:     1. try not to nap during the day, and go to bed even if not sleepy (might take time)   2. pills (they're ok, but, c'mon)  3. have a strong drink (fast and simple, if you're willing to cope with the headaches :)) )
Jzrx2GeMaa	I can't tell you how many times I went to the dr for difficulty breathing, and how many OCD/DEPRESSION/ANXIETY pills they put me on for it.    I don't know how much you weigh, but I lost 30 lbs and the problem went away miraculously. So if you're overweight, try losing a little to see if it gets better.    If you aren't overweight, then yes it could be anxiety, but there has to be a core reason you are feeling this way. What is going on in your life? Anything extra stressfull or depressing you? Get to the bottom of that and fix it!    Also, how are your sinuses? Do you think you are having a hard time breathing because of congestion? Do you have allergies to anything? I've been using a netti pot for my sinuses and can breath a lot better now. http://www.neilmed.com/usa/nasaflo.php    As someone mentioned about as well, yoga does wonders for breathing.    Hope I helped, this is just what I know I have experienced, and how many 100's of dollars I have spent having tests and getting prescriptions, and all along no one told me "lose some weight you fat ***".. it just boggles my mind.|`|lnUrm4sGaa	its more than likely panic attacks hun|`|LJkPRqN0aa	it sounds like a panic attack more than an anxiety problem..but both involve breathing problems|`|3meIiIsmaa	Yes - anxiety causes breathing problems. If you start feeling light headed and are breathing fast and shallow - it is prob. hyperventilation. Hold your breath for a few seconds - or breathe into a paper bag. Hyperventilation is actually too much carbon dioxide. Give your lungs time to process it -|`|Wn0nwNFjaa	Yes, classic. I often have periods where I feel I can't get quite enough air into my lungs and try to yawn all the time. Try to reassure oyurself that this is just anxiety and not illness. If it persists see your GP but don't let them push you into a prescription of xanax.|`|yb4FbFiSaa	Yes it is.  Breathing too fast is a common symptom of panic attacks.  I'd strongly urge you to investigate some methods of relaxation; there are lots of different techniques, and you'll find some suit you better than others.    I'd also have a word with your doctor about a few sessions of CBT.  CBT (cognitive behaviour therapy).  This will help you to work out what thoughts are leading to feelings of fear, which in turn give you those feelings of anxiety.|`|OCgZACJqaa	You are having panic attacks.    Try and breathe in slowly through your nose with your mouth closed counting to six and then purse your lips as if you were blowing a candle out and breathe out through your mouth counting to six.    This will calm you down, just concentrate on breathing slowly and you will get the hang of it.    If someone has asthma, they have to get control of their breathing also.|`|Ld1vLH8Kaa	Yes that is a classic anxiety symptom. You will be fine : )|`|qHCtBq07aa	Yes, it occurs during Panic Attacks and is a very classic symptom.   Feeling like you can't breath, or your chest is constricted.|`|7wMZIuooaa	Yes, I have been there its horrible, you are over breathing through panic.  But there is a way to get past this honest.  I tried yoga, it really helped.  Sometimes these attacks used to happen to me when I was driving, which was very scary, through controlling my breathing it would ease off.  Once I had all the tests and realised that I was not having a heart attack then I decided that I was the one to control it....    Find yourself a good Yoga teacher, go there once a week and then practise this at home as often as you can.  Buy also some c.d's of relaxing water type music, put them in your car or home and listen to them as often as possible......    Sometimes if I was in the car on my own and I realised that this attack was coming I would sing out really loud loads of old songs that cheer me up and ones that I knew all the words too, usually this would stave off the attack.    Being honest with yourself and writing down on a piece of paper all the things that work you up. then examine this carefully and see what you can illiminate.  Take control back, know that you are not going to pop your cloggs and it will soon pass, the fear is the enemy.    Yoga will help to lower all your stress levels, it works on the inside of your body as well, and you will learn some really good techniques for giving yourself more power or energy especially in breathing, its also lots of fun, especially when you bend over and someone in front has a bit of wind!!!.....  I always got so relaxed that I ended up snorring....how very rude.    Good luck.

aXnVFFUkaa	yes if it  is severe, you would be put on a drip until there is enough fluids in your body    edit reading your previous question i hope you are not intending to without fluids purposely as it can be very dangerous if not caught in time and can make you very ill|`|wbZp6ZcPaa	Yes if its severe. Sometimes though if it's just really bad you can be put on an IV drip in the ER and sent home when the drip is done.|`|e7eb28bb492c5eedd55da24da0a04504aa	Yes, it can be extremely dangerous.    In humans, dehydration can be caused by a wide range of diseases and states that impair water homeostasis in the body. These include:    External or stress-related causes   Prolonged physical activity without consuming adequate water, especially in a hot and/or humid environment   Prolonged exposure to dry air, e.g. in high-flying airplanes (5-15% relative humidity)   Survival situations, especially desert conditions   Blood loss or hypotension due to physical trauma   Diarrhoea   Hyperthermia   Shock (hypovolemic)   Vomiting   Burns   Lacrimation   Use of Methamphetamine, Amphetamine and other stimulants.   Drinking of Alcohol.   Infectious diseases   Cholera   Gastroenteritis   Shigellosis   Yellow fever   Malnutrition   Electrolyte disturbance   Hypernatremia (also caused by dehydration)   Hyponatremia, especially from restricted salt diets   Fasting   Recent rapid weight loss may reflect progressive depletion of fluid volume (the loss of 1 L of fluid results in a weight loss of 1 kg or 2.2 lb).[1]   Patient refusal of nutrition and hydration   Other causes of obligate water loss   Severe hyperglycemia, especially in Diabetes mellitus   Glycosuria     Wikipedia|`|bVbFAyzjaa	yes, particularly if it is severe dehydration.|`|QXKqEmfGaa	Yes. I once got real sick and didn't eat or drink at all for a while because everything tasted nasty. I was around seven years old when it happened. I got dehydrated, during the time of not drinking. I ended up in the hospital and if my parents hadn't of took me then, I would have died. One funny thing that happened though, was a threw up on a nurse. xD|`|UZxeBrxQaa	You can.  It can be life threatening.    Severe enough and it interrupts clear thinking.  The cause of the condition, flu or bacterial infection, may prevent you from retaining fluids, so IV fluids may needed to be given, along with painkillers and antibiotics.    Electrolytes are out of balance.  Heart rhythm and blood pressure can be affected.    Usually a one day/night stay.

SjTAVdcKaa	Go by how you feel. If you fell ok, go for it.     But remember, lack of sleep catches up to you.|`|xyNGYgJWaa	You need to catch up on your sleep, you shouldn't be working out when you're tired, you wont enjoy it! When you're going to have a workout you should feel fresh and energised and ready to go. Then you wont have to skip any of it and you can do your weight training for around 15 - 20 minutes and then go a nice jog for 20 - 30 minutes. Then when you come back you should feel really good!|`|16vMIGPiaa	Do not skip your workout altogether!    If it was me, and I had to choose between getting more sleep and paring down my routine, I'd stick with the cardio.  You get more joint movement, which keeps you limber, it works on your endurance, it encourages deep breathing, and of course it exercises the heart.

If you starve yourself your not going to grow|`|gERaZGZeaa	Lifting weights will not stunt your growth.  Proper nutrition, proper sleep habits, and a good amount of exercise all help promote height growth.  Limiting factors are your genetics, exposure to air pollution, things like that.|`|t81MEJ82aa	To reach your maximum potential eat healthy, and stay fit. How tall you will be is determined by genetics so building muscle doesn't not stunt your growth.     The fact that you have tall relatives should give you some hope. My father is 5'3, and my mother is 5'1, while relatives on my mother's side were taller than average, except her of course. I grew to be average height, almost 6 feet.|`|al0cCPb6aa	if both your parents are short most likely you'll be it's genetics and if you're already past your growth spurt nutrients and health really isn't giong to help you. Sometimes genetics skip and the child will be tall but that's really a rarity.|`|mExAfokFaa	this scarred me too, my coaches tell me no you cant, my friends and family say you can, I know that you have to work and stretch out your spine, in between workouts, because when your lift weights, you put alot of pressure on your spine pushing it together, but if your stretch it out between workouts, then i dont think can get shorter from lifting weight if your do it right.
16vMIGPiaa	15 pounds in a week was mostly water and clearing your bowels.  It's not sustainable.    And - flatter abs requires toning the muscles AND reducing total body fat.  It's been show over and over that 'spot exercising' simply does not work at all.  Remember that the abdominal girdle is comprised of several muscle groups, not just the ones that show in front.  You have to exercise all of them, all the way around.

As for losing weight you could try what I do. I only eat three times a day with nothing in between meals.  Don't eat until you are hungry and once you are no longer hungry quit eating. Don't wait until you are stuffed to stop. When i do this i lose at least one pound a day!|`|V4fEgYIQaa	If you're 13, the last thing I would be thinking about is trying to lose 20 to 30 pounds, especially in 3 months! That's just not happening! You can always maintain a healthy exercise routine and diet, but don't go above and beyond... and certainly don't take any dietary supplements! As far as your skin goes, just wash your face regularly- morning and night, and moisturize with an oil-free moisturizer. Wash your hair often and make sure you rinse your ahir and body well, because sometimes if hair conditioner gets on your skin it will clog pores. Try not to use too much product in your hair when you get out of the shower, too! Try to wear less blush, concealer, or foundation to keep your pores unclogged. As far as stretch marks go, those are normal, and will probably fade as you get older- you're growing now! Just try rubbing some cocoa butter on them before you go to bed every night.

vlki0YmHaa	The best thing any one person can do is work on that social anxiety. Though being shy is very common, hiding the fact that you truly are shy is the best way to overcome it. Try a few days out of the week to be outgoing and very talkative, soon you'll get into a rhythm of thinking "Hey, this is easy." Depression will come and go, it does for everyone. Focus on all the good things in your life, instead of the negatives.

If you date this girl, you will never be able to be comfortable in your own skin around her.  If you want to be an actor, go to Hollywood, don't do it in you everyday life.  Let her go.

ohx1RwEkaa	hey buddy! well first I gotta tell u that theres no need to take these pills if you having minor anxiety worrying over something non significant. Being diagnosed it is much more difficult to handle things, you are one strong man. Post surgical procedures do include prescribed medications, usually xanax and prozac, so you'll get to feel that buzz sooner or later.   What you probably having is mood variation, for which you need moodstabilizerss, and one I know that is an 'alternative' for xanax is Topamax. It is also an Rx drug and does very much does the same thing as xanax affecting only certain parts of amygdala in your brain that help you relax and relief the outside pressure. This one is not as strong as xanax but you'll feel that very same effect as you would from xanax.  Get better.

I would see a gastroenterologist ( a doc who specializes in disorders of the GI tract ), begin an appropriate diet ( no nuts, popcorn for starters ). With this disease, you develop little pouches in the intestinal wall. Food gets trapped in there and can cause inflammation, if not infection. Sometimes, these diagnosis' are a blessing in disguise as we are forced to take care of our bodies. Mild is no big deal, but if not taken care of, will be. So, see a GI specialist and dietician/nutritionist. Best of Health!|`|e934d8011992b7643157c6eb91e2a37baa	No it is not normal. You could seek a second opinion from a gastro dr. some diet changes are usually made. You don't want things sluggish in your bowels.|`|0lCnu1g2aa	Diverticulosis is simply the outpouching of the colon, kind of like polyps but they protrude to the outside like little balloons.  Diverticulitis is the inflammation and infection of one of those pouches. Having the pouches at your age is not really that unusual, but is considered abnormal. If your not having problems with small amounts of liquid BM, and NO solid stools then I would not be really worried. The pain is usually to the left abdomen and somewhat severe, People are often nauseated and vomitting and feel like they have the flu and it wont go away.      My question for you is have your ever had a colonoscopy? If not you should get one asap. My brother was diagnosed with colon cancer at 36 and I was 29, I demanded to have one and I was clean. Had one again last year at 34 and clean (Thank God). The colonoscopy is even better at finding out what is going on in your colon. The prep the day before is the worst part by far, but well worth it for the peace of mind!|`|mxqAOxYRaa	See a doctor, a doctor can help more than the average Joes on Y!A|`|hneetSf2aa	Yes that doctor should be shot...my dad had it and he never knew untill his belly got real big like a pregnant woman and so he went to the hospital and they had to operate right away..they said if they would have waiting a hour longer he would have died from his stomach exploding|`|ro5vFj9Aaa	i would be concerned divertuculitis is not good you can't eat anything with seeds it could cause lots of pain. also the colon if he died of colon soemthing if you get that its death most usually sometimes they can cut the divertic. out and it can be ok which is one way to rid of it and it could oly be a few inches i would have it done if you have a mind to also it could cause cancer i would think  not sure what you dad had converting to that.

However, the urge to drink too much beyond a certain limit may be the result of an underlying disease, either physical or emotional. Excessive thirst may be a symptom of high blood sugar (hyperglycemia), and can be an important clue in detecting diabetes.    Excessive thirst is a fairly common symptom. It is often the reaction to fluid loss during exercise, or to eating salty foods.    You need to go see your Primary Physician.    What to Expect at Your Office Visit:    The health care provider will get your medical history and perform a physical examination.    Medical history questions may include the following:    * How long have you been aware of having increased thirst?  * Is it consistent during the day?  * Is it worse during the day?  * Did it develop suddenly or slowly?  * Are you eating more salty or spicy foods?  * How much salt do you have each day?  * Did you change your diet?  * Have you noticed an increased appetite?  * Have you noticed an unintentional weight gain?  * Have you noticed an unintentional weight loss?  * Has your activity level recently increased?  * What other symptoms are happening at the same time?  * Have you recently suffered a burn or other injury?  * Are you urinating more or less frequently than usual?  * Are you producing more or less urine than usual?  * Have you noticed any bleeding?  * Are you sweating more than usual?  * Is there any swelling in your body?  * Do you have a fever?|`|cx5Z5XEtaa	increase your WATER  dehydration , your sodium seems high, try drinking propel vit b water  and gatorade 1 x a day make sure it stops or your diabetic and see a Dr? certain medication casue this symptom allergy medication

yfvmR6lEaa	No, its not bad for you, just for your matress. Its the support of the bed frame that keeps the mattress held up.     When its placed on the floor the mattress will compress with the weight of your body over years. It wont harm you in anyway, just shorten the life expectancy of your mattress, but if you follow the rule of changing out your mattress at lease once every 7 years your fine.     And make sure to rotate your mattress every 4 months and flip once every year.|`|IFQFt25naa	No it is not bad for you not to have a bed frame.  (Though it might look bad/tacky).      But consider yourself lucky at least you have the option. Where I am located there are many many people that do not even have a mat to sleep on, just a blanket if they are lucky then simply sleep on the floor or worse.    But ultimately regardless of if it is good or bad health wise for you, you should do what your family tells you to do regarding the frame.  For not following what you are told could be why it will be bad for you more than anything else.    May Our Creator watch over you and your family.|`|mhLaOFZRaa	What would be the difference of sleeping on the floor in a sleeping bag or sleeping on a blow up bed ?    I would say your family needs to do some research on the answer because it will not hurt you. Indians slept on the ground for many years without a bed frame and it didn't hurt them, and many people in other countries sleep on the floor.    Do what you have to do for now. Maybe later you could build a wooden box to put your box springs and mattress on. If you look online many of the decorating sites show these type of beds and I like that idea better than a bed frame.     Or when you can afford it you could go to the Salvation Army or Goodwill or other second hand store and buy a USED METAL FRAME that is adjustable for your box springs. Sometimes they only cost about $10.00. They really have neat things at these stores so try them. Many times the Salvation Army in our area will have BRAND NEW mattress sets, dining room sets and living room sets because one or several of the local Furniture donates them for tax write off.|`|YZddJuahaa	Hmmm..

Just a few years ago my son found that his friends teased him too--even his closest friends. Some days he just wanted to haul off and hit them. But the bigger issue was that it was his best friend who did the teasing. My son was a very sensitive fellow and we had many long talks about why kids tease. He really had a hard time with it. But when he started to understand that his friend teased him for what he didn't like in himself, it started to make a difference.   Your friend teases you because she sees in you what she could never handle in herself. She is actually telling you more about herself than she is about you. A great man once said the best response to any criticism is one sweet short word, "SO."   So whenever your friend teases you, your only job is to say, "so." and if she says, "don't you care what others say or think," your answer is "so, so, so."    If you're overweight it's not very much. What does your doctor say? Ask him and if you want to drop weight for yourself then you can do it. But first love you the way you are and know that your friend has the problem-- a self image problem. It would be good for both of you to read Psycho Cybernetics by Maxwell Maltz (I hope your library has a copy of it).

BG8vMyZjaa	The medical term for knock knee is genu valgum. 'Genu' is Latin for knee and 'valgus' means bent outwards. The opposite condition, where the knees turn outwards, is called genu varum.    Treatment options for knock knee may include:    * The inner edge of the heel of the shoes may be raised slightly to try to correct the line of the leg.    * In severe cases, walking braces or night splints may be used.    Surgery is considered only in very severe cases. The operation involves cutting and realigning the large leg bones known as the tibia (shin bone) or inserting staples on the insides of the knee bone to slow down growth. The surgery is performed under a general anaesthetic and recovery usually takes around two weeks.    Your GP, or a physiotherapist, will be able to recommend some exercises for your child that will help to stabilise their knees.|`|0UHI7CoRaa	I think the opposite of bow-legged is called Rickets.

emNCaAq7aa	Your systolic, the 135, is a little high but not by much. 130 and below is considered normal and they like less than 120. The difference in the two numbers is nothing and is not a big deal. They are measuring two different things. The systolic measures the pressure of the blood going out from the heart when there is tension on the artery and the diastolic is the blood returning to the heart when there is little tension. It is suggested that you take your pressure in the evening when you are relaxed and that the cuff be at heart level.  Your pulse is good and your weight is just a little over. The fastest way to lower your blood pressure is to lose a little weight by eating more vegetables and whole fruits.  I have been amazed at how well niacin has worked for me, much better than all of the prescription drugs I used to take for cholesterol.   I would suggest that next time you see your doc you have an HbA1c test.

OhyEivqbaa	It depends on your teeth really... They bleach the enamel on your teeth but some people have dark dentin (the material under the enamel) and that doesn't bleach. So, it'll either work or be a waste of money. The only way to figure that out is to get it done though. Also for 24 hours after having your teeth bleached you can't eat anything colored otherwise your teeth will turn that color. It's also painful after getting your teeth bleached, you get these little "zingers" that shoot up through your teeth and they're super sensitive to cold. At the dental office I worked for you were given bleach trays along with the in office bleach. You don't have to use them after but it's a good way to keep your teeth as white as possible.     One last thing... the "one hour bleaching" is usually two hours. It takes an hour to get you all set up and prepared for the beaching and then the actual bleaching process is an hour.    Hope I was of some help!|`|kogsyGAPaa	I've never used that, but honestly for me I used crest whitestrips and they have worked wonders!

UZJ7wVc8aa	Everyone has a problem spot. It can be around the stomach, thighs, arms or chest. No matter where your trouble spot is, the solution is exactly the same. You need to eat less and exercise more. The reason why there's only one solution for all of these problems is because it's impossible to tell your body where to burn the excess fat from.    When you eat too many calories, your body stores the excess energy as fat in different areas around the body. To lose this fat, you need to create a calorie deficit (eat less than you burn) to force your body to start burning that fat for energy. There is absolutely no way to control where your body goes to find this extra fat.     The larger your calorie deficit (a bigger calorie deficit means a bigger difference between what you eat and what you burn) the faster your body will burn excess fat and the quicker your body fat percentage will start to decrease. You can increase your calorie deficit by cutting your daily intake and exercising more. Sit ups will do nothing to target the fat around your abs just like squats will do nothing to target the fat around your thighs.

You probably had a slight injury that's causing sciatica now.  Inversion therapy sounds like it could be perfect for you.  Inversion therapy is when you hang upside down with gravity boots or on an inversion table and the weight of your body pulls your spine or elongates it so that your spine can straighten out and go back into alignment and straighten up.  This will also fix your posture problem.  Once you begin to invert your spine will get used to being straight and will stay that way after a while.  If you invert you can also do mini crunches to strengthen your spine and to build the muscles in your back.  Inversion therapy is the best thing for you sweetie.  Give it a try, you won't be sorry.

Hope it gets better. |`|J6JFiNL8aa	no not normal....go see your doctor|`|CpiVte0gaa	I also do this. It is really scary my Lady dr(ha ha) told me she could get me on pain pills like heavy duty ones. But it could also be a cyst. Go to the DR and make sure though because i still have not gotten checked out and it;s not good for your body. Oh also blood sugar drops a lot plus your supposed to drink a lot of water but i don't really. hope i helped

UTIs don't go away without treatment and can turn into bladder or kidney infections, which can be life threatening.    best wishes..|`|GR07LyyTaa	get some cranberry pills from the vitamin section at like a walmart or something, that's what i use and they work great. just follow the instructions.. and drink a lot of water or cranberry juice (not cranberry cocktail). that should help. cranberry helps promote healthy urinary tract|`|12ORrojXaa	it may be that your infection came back.  did you complete your round of antibiotics?  if so, then you may have a resistance to that specific antibiotic.  call your doctor asap, so that if it is an infection it can be resolved.  it may also be a bladder spasm...there is also medications for that.  good luck!

JHlS5VDMaa	Well, normal is a good question.  Those side effects have been reported so they are not uncommon. About 1% of people complained of back pain, 2% complained of abdominal pain (some can confuse upper GI pain with chest pain so I am including this info here) and less than 1% complained of angina (chest pain).  Angina is definitely cause for concern.  Not to cause you any panic, but I would contact your doctor first thing and let him know the area, severity and duration of you symptoms (both back and chest)- and don't let him/her brush you off. There are plenty of other medications available for the treatment of heartburn.|`|8q4RhpZWaa	Who knows the FDA is so corrupt they push drugs onto the market and act like they're safe, give them to paitents and don't even warn them of the dangers and effects.

I have had like 2 showers today and it's 2:30pm. I am in Australia though, so maybe we haven't got the same bug if you're in America. I think it might be food poisoning, because I went to a BBQ friday and I got sick on the Saturday. Just think of something you might have done, or eaten to trigger it.

I don't think that you could say that you wouldn't date somebody just because they've struggled with depression and/or suicidal ideations in the past.

d6GLWehvaa	Sit ups are hardly effective if you want to lose weight. What you really need to do is have a diet high in fiber, and eat a lot of fruits (colorful) and vegetables. Cardio is the most effective way to lose weight. Start out slow, and gradually work your way up. You can do sit ups, but in order to lose weight, you need to work your entire body. You need to gain muscle to lose fat. If you build muscle, and you gain a few pounds, don't worry about it, because muscle weighs more than fat. Well, don't worry about it if you are gaining muscle. The fat loss will follow. The most important thing to remember is that you NEED TO STICK TO A SCHEDULE and you MUST EAT. If you don't eat, you will never lose weight. You will gain it. Remember to stick to a 2,000 to 2,400 calorie diet, but you don't need to count calories. Just eat natural foods, like raw veggies. They are very low in calories. It sounds difficult, but the hardest thing about it is getting started, like with everything. Once you get started, and you have it in your mind that you actually want to lose weight, you will find it easier to keep a routine. And, it always helps if you have a support system! It gives you more incentive if you tell at least one person of your goals. By the way, you don't need to waste your money at a gym. If you have tennis shoes and a sidewalk, you'll be fine. Work on the muscle by doing 10 push ups and twenty sit ups (not crunches) every morning and every night. Every week, add five more push ups and ten more sit ups. Many people do sit ups wrong, though. You don't need to sit up all the way to your knees, because that's using your lower back, and that can be counteractive. Only use your abdomen. By running, doing push ups and sit ups, and eating right, you will lose weight in no time at all! I hope this helps you!|`|CBByqMXuaa	treadmill for 20 min. i lost 2 pounds! 100 sit ups a day for a week is 2-3 pounds!

Influenza or The Flu is a respiratory illness with fatigue cough body aches and general run down feeling, also fever.    Flu bug is a general term for a viral illness, it can be respiratory or gastrointestinal which is what you are talking about.      1.  Start by not eating or drinking anything for about 12 hours while you are vomiting.  Then start back on a diet of liquids (clear) jello, apple juice, tea, flat cola, sprite etc.  No solid foods for a while.  If you are able to hold the liquid down then go to the BRAT diet.  Banana, Rice, AppleSauce, Toast before progressing to regular food.    For sleep, make sure you avoid caffeine.  Low doses of benadryl are often helpful for mild insomnia.|`|kK4GG6Z2aa	Oh poor you I sympathise as I too have had this bug.  However, I wasn't vomiting with it.  You will have trouble getting to sleep because of your illness.  I would advice a hot milky drink before going to bed, but if you are vomiting this would be unwise.  Perhaps it is best to get a check up with doctor...especially if you have been vomiting for more than three days.  In the meantime do drink plenty of water as you will get dehydrated with high temperature, sweating and vomiting.  Hope you are well soon...take care.|`|AA10420187	Yea get some sopositories!!

If you are on SSI you can get State Medicaid usually Soc. Sec. automatically enrolls you.  If you are not on SSI there are programs available through your county hospital system for medical until you reach 24 months on Soc. Sec. disability which at that time you automatically are enrolled in Medicare and have Medicare Part D benefits which is hospital, dr and prescription benefits.  So check with your county hosital system they have programs that will assist you until you reach your 24 month Medicare eligible status.|`|WKfoiiN6aa	Get as much resource as you can maybe is one  option,however it could be quite time consuming,here  http://www.healthinsurance-onlinetips.in...  is one resource i have had good experience.
lbR1IoiSaa	If your symptoms seem to be getting worse, chances are you've got a sinus and/or ear infection going on, and if you don't have any connections to get free antibiotics, it's going to cost you an office call and a prescription for some antibiotics.      It is possible also, that you have bad allergies, but if your symptoms are getting worse, then probably not with a fever of up to 102.      You'd be best to make an appt with the doc, or if you don't have one / can't afford his or her's office call, then perhaps try the Walgreens clinic (if they have one in your area).  I understand they can cost as little as $29, and can bill insurance if you have it.  Then just make sure you get a prescription for amoxicillin unless you're allergic to it - that is usually available to be filled at Wal-mart under their "$4.00 prescription plan."     Good luck, and I hope you feel better soon, it's tough to be miserable!|`|fdP9UJOsaa	The first girl said a "snake bite" but that seems sort of od, were you any where near snakes?

hvjWpq2naa	You are doing what you think best for your own health, if you are a twig and dont want to eat a lot, that is your thing.   Bulimics toss cookies after eating? you dont do that, so its up to you stand aside and not listen. there might be something if your ribs are sticking out, but not bulimia. if you really look that bad (ribs sticking out, no breasts) then you should look for some help. People like me are usually avoiding this kind of question, its personal, its up to you to decide what you want to do.
UZxeBrxQaa	Eighteen years of age is NOT the best year/years of your life.    But, they are the most opportunistic years of your life.  What you do during the next few years, the decisions you make, the skills you develop socially and intellectually, will determine how you spend the rest of your life.    I would love to be 18 again, but I would need to be able to understand what I know now for it to be advantageous.      Best plan is to plan!  Take a hard look at where you want to be, generally speaking, in ten years.  White collar job, blue collar job, professional, even if you don't know exactly what you want to do, you need to develop a general plan, and start to pursue it.      The next two years are likely to be general development and studies anyway.  Plan to be a dentist, and start with science studies, as an example, but get started on something.  You can define exact goals later.      Don't wait for fate to decide for you, or leave it up to chance.  Get on the general path toward where you want to end up, and narrow that path later.    The biggest mistake young people your age make is not a sense of direction.  Then, when they do decide where they want to be, it is often too late to start.  Avoid that!|`|jCCxrVJyaa	oh yes, 18 is was the best time of my life|`|47Sn5nnxaa	If I could go back, I would be more random|`|589bd0c75644f69916a6625eb75cb262aa	um i don't know I'll get back to you on that.|`|KvCD7wQMaa	Yeah I just turned 28 and I would love to be 18 again!!

They know how hard it is to get a body that shows dedication.

9d60a294b6864b585406ddb61a14d757aa	ANYTHING that comes from China is suspect in quality.  The only way to know whether they block UV adequately is take them to an optician who can put them under a UV meter and tell if they block UV.  That would be a little offensive to me, though, if you went out and bought a pair of sunglasses somewhere else and then brought them to me to check the qulality.  If you aren't willing to pay the optician something for his time and trouble I would either throw them away or just wear them and hope for the best.  I sure wouldn't ask him to do it for free.
aUnAy8uFaa	Sounds to me like your suffering from depression, however, it may just be for a short while. As we age our body changes, that means that our brain starts working different as well. Things in our past as well as concerns for the future always weight heavy on our hearts and minds too.     So although your parents split 3 years ago deep down in side you may very well still be struggling with feelings of loss and or abandonment. As for feeling like no one likes you that is a tell tale sign of depression, it signifies that you feel low and worthless about yourself. Having head aches and crying is another sign that you may be dealing with depression, when our bodies begin to shut down (ie, being tired all the time and having head aches) it means that it's time to start looking for answers to problems that we are dealing with inside our heads and hearts. May I suggest you talk to a doctor or nurse about getting a counselor, or calling a mental health hotline.    Also if you have a close relationship with your parents talk to them, they may not realize that your struggling with emotions and up set feelings.       I wish you all the best in the future and remember it's always a good idea to look in the mirror every morning and night and tell yourself that you are a beautiful person who is worth being loved. But remember no one can truly love you unless you love yourself.|`|5EFHyGVbaa	I recommend you check out this social networking community called LetsReflect.com.

Talking to someone about your problems always seems to lift the stress off of my shoulders.     If you can't talk to one of your friends, considering going to your guidance counselor or psychologist at your school and ask them not to talk to your parents. They will usually keep their word unless they fear for your life.    Trust me, I feel like this all the time and understand how frustrating it is. Just bear with it. Look on the sunny side of life, even though that may be very hard. Do things that you like to do, like pitching, skating, or anything.|`|ZVu9NAlJaa	There are a few possibilities. If you are taking any medications they are probably making you depressed and causing your symptoms. Otherwise, it is psychological and you are depressed because of some recent event (like you breaking up with a boy friend or most probably because of your parents divorce.) you may think you have gotten over it, but it is subconciousely coming back to you.|`|QTjP6Nx4aa	i must say, you have some serious issues. You very well may have a chemical imbalance and i urge you to seek counceling and medication. one thing that many get twisted is that medication ALONE will solve their problems. Medication alone WILL NOT solve the issues, you need to talk to someone about your problems. This is the only that you can get to the base of your anger/sadness or anything else that's bothering you.

5kXxr6r0aa	Every bodybuilder an athlete in the world knows that the words "gain" and "really fast" can never be used in the same sentence.    the first month of working out though, will give notably faster progress as long as you know what you're doing.    if you've alright got a decent bicep, it sounds like you've maybe hit a wall where progress is going slower all of a sudden. what you've gotta do is shock your muscles by doing different bicep workouts every week, so that your biceps need to adapt to an all-around increase in intensity to workouts instead of just adapting to being able to do the same workout whenever they need to.    as for bulking and cutting, it works great if you know what you're doing, just make sure you do a lot of research online before you start.    hope that helps, good luck with your goals man!|`|8SRjELNBaa	Tell this same exact story to your PE/Weight-lifting instructor at school & they should be more than glad to help you, probably give you better and more specific instruction than we can here.

Hope this helps :-)|`|NPzDQmlQaa	One thing that brought my dieting and losing weight out of the plateau I was in so long was the Acai Berry.  I was stuck at my weight loss goals and this brought me through it and made me lose a lot of weight.  So in my opinion it helped me lose weight tremendously.  I know a lot of that dieting stuff is expensive but I found a free trial of Acai Berry(I think it only cost me like 7-8 bucks at the time for shipping.)  The site I got it from was theweight lossplace.com -  All I did was try it out for a month and I was sold,  I saw the results I wanted to and like I said I was in that plateau with my weight loss.  This kicked it up a bunch.    Good luck and I hope this helps.|`|yY2Czxy2aa	As far as I can tell, there are no proven weight loss benefits from the acai berry, juice, or capsules.    It does seem to be a great supplement (I take it, but don't sell the stuff!) and is full of anti oxidents, which help prevent damage to your body. But that's what you should take it for, not weight loss or fat burning.     The acai berry itself is an amazing thing - has a lot of anti oxidents etc and is really good for you.    But there's nothing really to suggest in scientific terms that it helps with weight loss.     And there are a lot of scams out there, be careful where you buy it from!    I take it, and I think I feel healthier and better. But it's not some type of magic formula, sorry.|`|c4kOwX0eaa	You hear about it all the time so it must work for some people at least!

Acai is an awesome health food, in fact you will probably feel the difference in your body within a week of taking a daily acai supplement. So, why is it so good?    Acai berries have far more antioxidants than any other fruit. Even more than blueberries! Besides that, the nutrients in acai berry supplements help many other diseases and maladies, from diabetes to arthritis to blood clotting. It really is a worthwhile supplement to add to your daily nutrition.    Acai can also be a great weight loss aid. The berrys natural concoction of essential fatty acids, fiber, phytosterols and amino acids work together to help your body burn fat more efficiently, process food more quickly and shed the unwanted pounds that youd like to lose.    The fatty acids and amino acids aid in both muscle development and proper digestion, both of which are essential to fat loss. The fiber helps your body to move food out of your system quicker and also to help you feel full, as do fatty acids. Phytosterols help fortify your digestive tract, moving waste materials out and absorbing nutrients more efficiently.    Acai has great anti-aging benefits, will cleanse and detoxify you, and has destroyed cancer cells in recent studies. You really can't go wrong by adding an acai supplement to your daily vitamin regimen. So far it's working for me by helping my digestion, curbing my appetite, and by giving me more energy each day... I don't even get sleepy around 3pm anymore.    My friend at work showed me this website where she ordered her Acai berry from. It's a great deal and there is even a free trial offer, check it out!    http://www.news-pulse.com
7rD3uJzdaa	It is from the stress? Stress as far as i am concerned is the number one factor for grey hairs? Number 2 is heredity? Hope my answer was helpful?|`|dBoC8fR2aa	Only 3 grey hair, what's the fuss. Use a black marker pen, paint on them to make them black again. Or simply pluck them out provided you still have plenty more black ones.|`|newfiOPOaa	Most likely it is normal.  When I was in college this guy had a shock of white hair right in the middle of his head of otherwise dark brown hair.   I almost thought it was fake until we were taking a shower after swim class>  He had the same white streak on his pubes.  Yeah I looked.  It was just so unusual.|`|r1fVrEwcaa	you should dye your pubes or take em off completely|`|vy5TCwTjaa	it just means that you are aging prematurely and will therefore die sooner
Dx6dsQx1aa	I don't think it's prohibited for A1C's over 8, but that's probably a good guideline.  The issue is that being on a pump requires a lot of maintenance and monitoring.  You will have to check your BG's faithfully 6-10x every single day, and you have to change out your setup every 2-4 days.  You will also need to upload data from your pump and generate reports to help your doc/diabetes educator make adjustments.  It's not like you just hook up the pump and go on your merry way.  So If you are too stressed out and too busy, the pump will probably not be a good choice for you.  Better to wait until your life settles down a bit so you can put focus on it.  Otherwise you will just be disappointed and in worse shape.|`|G6ZCpYwYaa	I was always are that they gave the pumps to patients that HBA1C's were out of control.    Surely your doctor would be recommending one if you are struggling?    If you want one, and are struggling, request one from your diabetic doctor.    Hope this helps.|`|96agLgIjaa	Your doctor won't let you because your a1c is 9? That is bizarre! Did you ask her/him why? Because theres got to be a reason. I started using a pump w/ an a1c of 8.2 - 8.3 and I had no difficulties. Ask your doctor why. That's the only solution I can think of.|`|AA10545252	I have heard that if your A1C is too high you will be denied.  I think it is the insurance that has these silly requirements.  My son was almost denied because his A1C was 7.2.      The pump is the best way to go though.  Good luck.|`|ZNbauLJzaa	No, that's not my endocrinologist's practice.  Ask why.  If you are taking a lot of shots, the pump really may help you get under 9.  I wonder if your doctor finds that the patients work hard to get under 9 to receive the pump as a reward.  An insulin pump, IMO, is a tool not a reward for good managment.  Can you arrange to talk to another endocrinologist?|`|cASB8Sh3aa	What you didn't mention is how often do you test your sugar?  If you are not testing often enough and your A1C is high then often insurance companies and doctors will say no to a pump for you.  If you are willing to test 8 to 10 times a day (or you already do this) then you need to ask the doc why they said no.  Also contact your insurance company and find out what they need to approve this.  Often times all they need is a letter of medical necessity from the doc.  If the doc will not give you a good reason why they said to get a pump and then told you no, then find a new doc.  Also consider contacting the pump companies.  Often times they will help you work with your doc to get the approval you need.    A pump will help you lower your A1Cs if you are willing to do your part.  This includes testing alot, eating healthy (especially when you first start out on the pump and they are setting your insulin rates), and eating on a regular schedule.  If you can do these things for 1 to 4 weeks (the average time it can take to get all the numbers set right for you) then you are a perfect candidate for a pump.
emNCaAq7aa	Colon cleansing empties your colon, not your stomach. There is the pyloric valve in the way.  The statements you hear about carrying 15 pounds of gunk in your colon is BS. You do lose a lot of weight from the cleansing but it is all water and protective mucous.   If you are constipated you may need an enema because the stool has dried out and can't move but a colon irrigation can be dangerous.  Colon cleansing by taking extra fiber adn stuff like senna (a laxative) will clean you out. You really don;t need the senna if you have regular bowel movements. Just the extra fiber, like Metamucil, will do the trick. fiber and water going through your esophagus is the real natural way to keep your colon happy and clean. Sticking a hose up your butt is not natural or really healthy in the long run.  You gain back the weight after an irrigation as soon as you drink enough for replacement.  The only reason you may need a colon cleansing is if you are going to be scoped and usually the docs don't go for irrigation but just a stimulant and lots of water.|`|2wptPP8xaa	If your going all that trouble have your colon scoped.  See your doctor.|`|rgDLovFhaa	Since when are colons supposed to be clean?|`|AA11922229	Allow two days if you are using herbal formulas.     All that is not necessary. Just eat lettuce and fruit for two days. Go back to a lean diet for a few weeks. Eat salads, and breakfast cereal. No dairy ever. Fast for 24 hours on natural fruit juice, 1/2 water. Repeat for a few months. You'll loose weight too.
13f7f9399c9bc7922d4dc2fb3445e850aa	better run,  or get a good lawyer, you are going up the river|`|fb00332ba009d82d6e7d60255fbc96bfaa	i swallowed a few pennies as a child none of which put me in the hospital. unless he choked on it or inhaled it into his lung he shouldn't be adversly affected by the penny.|`|ccFeMoFbaa	First of all, if you are trying not to get caught you shouldn't be posting this online for the world to see. Secondly, I doubt that a penny could kill him. Why don't you just tell the truth? Your intentions were not to harm him, and that is what matters. Oh, and you don't get the penny back. You just don't.|`|KelRhs4Naa	Theres probably a very small chance the penny will kill him. Most doctors in this situation just let it pass through his bowels and in a couple days he will have pooped it out. As long as he doesn't know it was you you should be fine. Oh and if you want the penny back stay with him for a few days and look through his crap :D

aqdDFdm8aa	weed is no doubt bad for you. But you are right it has no worse effect than liqueur, ciggs, and junk food. So why don't they just legalise it? I think it's because they wouldn't be able to tax it successfully. If it is legal then growing it would be and there-for people would just do it themselves. Weed can pretty much grow anywhere. Plus the fact that because it is already illegal makes it harder to be un-done.|`|fFqzD3aMaa	The greatest consequences are the legal ramifications.|`|7XyIyNSnaa	I don't.|`|776cf4cc9dc31fae3b35bd08e9ead34eaa	Its not bad for you. Its just illegal, unfortunately.|`|fb00332ba009d82d6e7d60255fbc96bfaa	I don't. i've been a smoker for 21 years and the worst thing to come of it is multiple trips to the county jail.|`|45f427df1deeccc715106e52ff789d64aa	the only known health risk is lung damage from the smoke which doesnt apply to vaporizors. legalize. would type like 5 pages about legalizing but im on a psp|`|ded89ca8feeab936770d2d0fcafcf9aeaa	Pure propaganda. There's a theory that claims all this anti-cannabis movement started because hemp can replace a lot of DuPont's products (Nylon, Neoprene, a lot of plastics, etc.). If you check the historical usage of marijuana in the world, you'll see nobody gave a sh*t about this drug until the XX century, which was when DuPont started its business, heh...    I think Cannabis is as dangerous as any other activity. You know, there are a lot of addicts to WoW (World of Warcraft), gambling, alcohol, internet porn, and so on. Nobody is trying to forbid those activities. They tried with booze and failed.|`|OPhMTPqyaa	According to a long study, another one that is, turns out that marijuana is not gonna give you cancer after-all. This is just another story in a long line of stories that seem to point out the hypocrisy of our lives at the moment. Why is it that the two established vices that are legal seem to have a mountain of evidence supporting that they are quite addictive and detrimental to your health yet weed seems to have this stigma that it's going to kill you and lead to a heroin addition. If anything, Alcohol leads to heroin addiction.    With the mounting evidence proving the weed is the lesser of the two evils when it comes to recreational vice, legal or illegal, I think its time to reevaluate why it continues to be illegal. Oh yeah, I know why; cause it would cut into alcohol sales. That's who's blocking this. Doesn't it make sense?     It has helped me more than anything else. I smoke medical weed as I have epilepsy.|`|4gURZK2laa	I know its bad for you. I know a couple kids that look like they hav smoked 2 lbs too many. Haha but I can tell it slows down your reaction time if ur a daily blazer.  And if really messes up ur head aftr a while.     But spark that **** anyways mutha f*ckers
b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	The only chance you have of stopping your period is to skip the sugar pills at the end of the pack and just start taking the active pills in the next pack this month.  If your pills are 28 days and the last 7 are a different color, they are sugar pills, just there to remind you to take a pill every day and your period should come while you are taking those.  Don't take those at all and just start the active pills in the next pack and you could stop your period from coming.  It may not work and you could have some spotting anyway, but it could work and  you would have no period.    good luck..|`|FnDz57xRaa	do what she said, keep taking the pills, obviously NOT the sugar pills.  as long as you take the active pills you will not have a period.  i have had friends do this and have a normal period once they stopped taking active pills, and others had  a   really heavy period
uxq33y1maa	Spotting for a few minutes is exactly what breakthrough bleeding is like. It may need a pantyliner, and is usually brown, or lighter than normal period blood. Or you might just wipe and notice it on the toilet paper. It might last a few days, but it will come very slowly and will not get heavier, only lighter. It will not affect your normal period.|`|9224e8b748564d6e1de3380f08bb6c43aa	That sounds like breakthrough to me.  I don't think there's any way it should look, but I think if it's a lot you need to get a higher dose of bc.|`|GoybSG1Yaa	sounds pretty damn disgusting if you ask me.
qMmo3k2Daa	uh yea very realistic 4 months is a long time and like all u have to do is lose 5 pounds a month and actually u can lose more than that in 4months|`|HOXWWmsFaa	yes. just diet and and exercise|`|qxw1k0Kmaa	Yes, If you control your eating and excerise at least 30 minutes everyday you can drop about 2 pounds per week.|`|jWmnSXlLaa	Yes that is very possible. Well lower your carbs and up your protein. These things will help alot. I  don't know how much you weigh or your activity level but you can walk outside. Your can also get a dvd called walk off the pounds. It is fast and easy to do. This helps since it is so cold outside.. I love the sweatin to the oldies videos and have an exercise bike. leg lifts,leg kicks or just dance around. Anything is good for exercise. Take the stairs instead of the elevator and park farther away in the store parking lots. All these things will work together to help. Good luck.|`|I8MUpN04aa	yes, 5 pounds a month is not unreasonable. just increase your exercise, and don't eat junk food or sweets. try to imagine dividing your dinner plate into 4 sections. have 1 section for your starch, i section for your meat, and the other 2 sections for veggies. if you keep eating double the veggies, you will be loosing the weight. as for exercise, do what you like doing- can be walking, biking, swimming, running, skipping- anything, as long as you do it at least 3 times a week for at least a half an hour or more at a time.|`|5pGfmlxcaa	it is possible thats what im doing now!!   just cut back on calories like im saposed to eat 2,450 calories per day but i cut back 500 calories and i eat 1,450 calories a day i think its really working for me|`|b2aw7iWtaa	5 lbs a month, i think that is very realistic, well, depending on how over weight you are...    i would just try the obvious first, less sweets, mabe a gym membership...|`|iZYmoSweaa	yes it is possible! i actually lost 20 pounds in 1 month! Believe it or not you just need to find which diet plan works for you! if i do No or Low Carb i loose 5 pounds a week like that but for my mom if she does Low Fat or No Fat she looses 5 puns in about 2 weeks! its easy you just have to be devoted to it and try your hardest oh and also the gym do about 45minutes to an hour three times a week at " LA FITNESS" they have Free trainers they are so nice and easy to work with! try it i believe in you all you have to do is believe in your self ( yeah i know that was cheeezy) Goood LUCK! :)|`|FnDz57xRaa	yes and no. the pounds lost is relative.  it is all about working to get your body to a point where you feel healthy and confident, and happy with how you look.     it all depends on your health and level of exercise that you can tolerate.  walk, then jog, then jog briskly a few times a week, gradually increasing level and intensity of exercise, eat healthy, increase fruits and vegetables, lower carbs and include whole grains, cut empty sugars like non-diet sodas and white bread and white potatos.  increase protein and fiber so you feel full|`|dDgwMinYaa	5 lbs a months, that's about a pound a week.  Definitely realistic.  I would say just don't eat as much junk, eat more healthy food, and stay fairly active.
YQZoGNOYaa	absolutely that is realistic. consistency is key. do cardio for at least 30-45 minutes 5 days a week and eat healthy (you know what that means!) and don't skimp on the water. good luck!!
hHSsMyNpaa	Follow your doctors instructions.  If you are experiencing side effects, call the doctor and you will be told what to do next.  The doctors are very experienced in dealing with their patients and drugs.  Anti inflammatory drugs are very necessary because it prevents more damage from occurring.  If you absolutely do not want to take it then take 3 400mg Ibuprofin 3 times a day, but that is a very poor substitute.  Tiny chance anything bad will happen.  Bigger problem if you dont take them.|`|HwxBL1B1aa	got o the  pharmacy and get a muscle relaxer with emu oil  take it from me it takes a crap load of tension off|`|AA11570236	You should take them,just have a friend of family to help you relax.  The pain can get pretty bad.|`|IhhDwGBmaa	give them to me :p|`|AA10820533	I take the same thing.  The first few times I took it I had the dizziness.  i started cutting them in half.  Then i started taking the full after a few days.  I still get the dry mouth though and keep a glass of water by my bed for in the morning.
029366e443f706114f76140b91711233aa	I wish you the best!    I think of my son, who is an alcoholic, and says that he is just doesn't feel like he has any fun unless he is out drinking even though it has affected him to where he can't hold a job or have a healthy relationship.    First, I think, you are going to have to change your thinking...change your priorities. The things that you find to fulfill yourself may not be kick@ss, drunken laughfests but you have respect for yourself and others around you will have respect for you when you stop getting drunk.    It's all about perspective...is it REALLY fun when you can't remember what you did the night before...is it REALLY fun when you betray a friend or embarass yourself...really.    Get some help if you need it but you've already taken the first step...admitting it.|`|jfwmelYgaa	I was the same way...but when I was drunk I also used cocaine and ecstasy frequently, enabling me to drink 10X what I normally would...I also never missed work and kept up on my child support payments...I only drink when i have friends in town visiting me...other than that I don't go out at all because I don't trust myself...I bought an xbox 360 to keep me busy and I buy dvds and stay home....I also go to the gym and skateboard a lot and most of all being with my daughter keeps me sane and sober.....the trick is keeping yourself occupied...I didn't like AA or NA because they put religion(or a highjer power) into all aspects of it and  I noticed a lot of the people were so fake it made me sick.|`|EPaYoJaiaa	Since you can't even think about going to the movies without drinking (which is one thing that us that don't drink very much or at all do) then yes I think you should go to a support group. As you said you don't have the 'classic' signs but you're beginning to. I'm glad you've realized this before it's too late!    I drink but not a whole lot, last drink I had was at christmas time. I like the taste of some alcoholic drinks but getting drunk never appealed to me. I don't like the idea of not being in control of myself, getting sick, and/or not remembering hours at a time of my life.     I like to do jigsaw puzzles, knit, go shopping for random things with friends, hang out, go to the movies, my best friend and I get a pedicure together every month, bowling, reading, I like to write stories, I get goofy sometimes and just dance alone in my room (a lot more fun than in sounds i swear), calling friends and just having a pointless conversation, I love showers lol, baking and many more that I can't really think of right now.    Of course anything can be done WITH drinking, the trick is to not do it, which is why I suggest the support group since you can't think of going to the movies without drinking.   Also, if you're friends do the same things you do now you'll have to start distancing yourself from them, especially if they try to peer pressure you back into that lifestyle. I know you understand that it'll be hard but leaving your friends behind might even be harder than leaving the drinking. It's a destructive lifestyle and in order to succeed you'll have to leave those that indulge in it.    good luck!|`|AHLUW1HNaa	Smoke dough    :]      I'm kidding|`|UinOWcMUaa	Try Jesus.. what do you have to lose besides you'll soul. Everything to gain, it makes sense to be waiting for the Lord's return which is imminent.

Hobbies.  You could look at gardening.  Volunteering. Embroidery.  Scrap booking.  Needle arts.  Photography.  Decorative Painting.  Crafting in general.  Sewing.  Metal sculpting.  Auto mechanics.|`|7CouboDraa	My boyfriend is an alcoholic. He has struggled with it for pretty much all of his adult life and has been sober on and off, sometimes for only a few months, sometimes for a couple years at a time. It is a terrible disease.     I don't believe in AA nor does he. My boyfriend did the 90 meetings in 90 days and has hated it ever since. If you actually look into it, it is very cult-like, so I wouldn't suggest going to meetings. By AA's standards my boyfriend is not truly sober, he is a "dry drunk" because he did not get sober with AA. (He hasn't drank in a year and he did it on his own.) You'll basically be told by AA that if you don't take part in AA, you'll never be sober and will die drunk. As someone else mentioned, the people in it tend to be very fake, even lying about how long they've been sober. If you need a support group, then I'm sure your boyfriend and family would be more than happy to support you.    The thing you need to do is make the decision within yourself to stay away from alcohol COMPLETELY. That doesn't mean your social life has to end, it just means you need to try to stay away from situations where you will be around alcohol. If you have certain friends that like to party a lot, perhaps you should consider how that is effecting you. You also need to find hobbies that YOU enjoy doing, not what people on here enjoy doing. Find somewhere to volunteer at, paint, draw, hike, cook, sew, learn how to play an instrument, etc etc. Just find something that you will truly love to do.    Good luck, and be proud of yourself for realizing that you have a problem.|`|Aj99vuqYaa	Reading, walking, hiking, writing, dancing, sports (swimming, baseball, tennis, badminton, swimming, running/track, rock-wall climbing, etc.) video games, music... you can go to a gym and exercise and do rock climbing there if they have it... or find a group to play sports game with. You can play card and board games, watch movies, paint/take up art, learn a musical instrument (violin, drums, guitar, paino...whatever). There's a LOT you can do. And if you got friends who are, or you can get, interested in the same things, it makes it all the more fun for you. =)|`|j6x87Ledaa	go deepsea fishingwith your boyfriend one saturday morning   it sounds boring but the excitement you feel when u catch sometign is awesome and relieves alot off stress. also the water will give you such a calming effect and then ull get the rush from the catch. you actually might enjoy it,  i am 26 and never did it before i did it with my man one time and im litterary ... hooked!!!   lol  no pun intended|`|0e88c2210c8510ae47dbd15b433d18a8aa	You need to stay away from any place that serves or you can by alchol at.

You can beat this!|`|B8Af2SAgaa	The first thing I would like to tell you is......Good For YOU!  Realizing the problem and excepting it is your first step.  Baby steps are required to help you get through this.  I will share a little bit about me...  8 years ago I decided I wanted to quit drinking.....I was into the heavy stuff.  Woke up in the morning with it, and passed out sometime throughout the day with it.  While my daughter was in pre-school, I should have been at work......I didnt.  I lied.........I lied a lot.  I am a single mom.  Raising my daugter was my number 1 priority, but alcohol was taking over.  Slowly it started to destroy my ability to cope with the simplest things.  My daughter was young.....only 4.  She still noticed it though.  Shame on me......but like I said, alchohol was taking over.  I began to really hate myself.......lost interest in all things.  Including the fun I used to have with my daughter.    One morning after I grabbed the bottle and chugged a couple down,  I went to my daughters room and just sat there, watching her sleep.  So peaceful, so relaxed and so ALIVE!  I couldnt do this to her anymore......I couldnt do this to me anymore.    I cried and cried and cried.............  Scared to death of what would happen to us.    I went to my telephone and called for help.  I found a place called REDGATE.......a program for DETOX, and RECOVERY.  I would have to stay there for 10 days DETOX, and 30 for  RECOVERY.  I really wanted to stop, but I was affraid for my daughter.  She had never been away from me before.  I called a relative, and explained the situation.  They agreed to watch her while I underwent my program.  It was a very, VERY scary first step, but DAMN if my daughter wasnt worth it.    Right away I went in.  The quicker I got myself in there, the quicker I could get back to being MOM.  40 days later..............DONE!...........WAY DONE.  SO DONE.  Never again will I allow a stupid bottle to abuse me again.  How dare I allow alchohol to control my life and take away precious moments with my beautiful child.    I tried the AA.......not for me......I dont have time to sit around and hear everyone elses drinking problems and hope it helps keep me sober.  NOT FOR ME.  NOPE!......my daughter is all I need..and a new outlook on life.  My daughter is now 13 years old.....beautiful and happy.  She's got her Moms full attention.  You ask what people do in place of the drinking.......  Well..............at first I took that extra time to get things back in order around the house.......was it a mess.  LOL  Then I gradually started getting out of the house.  Trips to the beach and the park are nice.  I even go to our local nature center for a nice hike now and then.  I needed to get back to work, so I found a really nice job.  One with no stressers!  Hobbies.....I like to put together puzzles and put on a good movie at home.    Friends.....well.......those are few, but its o.k.    They know I dont want to drink anymore, so they understand.  I changed my lifestyle, so most of my so-called friends kinda disapearred.    I love horses, so my job is at a ranch.  I love the outdoors, and working with the horses.  I can ride whenever I wish, and its so wonderful  Maybe you and your boyfriend can take horseback riding lessons.  heck!...with all the money you'd be saving on not purchasing the juice, you could learn to ride.  Then go out on trail rides together.  How about boating?  You could take sailing lessons.    or....roller blading......or.......get a dog, and go on long walks in the park.........jogging?.........go to the beach and fly a kite.......kites are o.k. I suppose........skiing?........surfing?..... diving?.......  Bake cookies?........get manicures/pedicures?...........take up painting?......an art class.............Photography.....thats fun!......  Make a scrapbook........get together with family for a bar-b-que.?  Visit a zoo?.......visit your local shelter?........get a fish tank.....fish are fun.....go to a spa?..........start a work out program at your local fitness center.......Order pizza, rent a movie........Bike ride?.......

First, walk into a barnes and nobles and see what catches your eye. Look at EVERYTHING!    Or if you like live music find a place that isn't really known for it's bar but more for the music. You'll want to listen to the music and be able to remember the fun you had then drink.    join a gym.|`|dh1LrDO7aa	Good luck! You just let partying get the best of you, but you can easily beat this!   Mind you I'm not much of a party girl, but I do some fun things. I go on the internet sometimes, but you already do that obviously. It's great to join a gym, because you won't be drinking for that. I love movies and going out to eat, and you could try to break away from coupling that with a drink here and there. I just started guitar lessons a month ago and I'm already learning Blackbird from The Beatles. You could try museums and shopping and stuff like that. I also want to take up some photography or art. Just go outside maybe on a nature trail or with your bike somewhere. It makes you feel great.

Nothing makes them larger except pregnancy, weight gain & maturity    if you build the underlying muscles then they will push what fat you have up and you breasts will appear larger.

x3EPqezJaa	Huh. Interesting. I have no idea if it's common or not. I wouldn't feel guilty about it--it wasn't your fault, there was nothing you could do about it. When I've woken up from anesthesia, it's felt like parts of my brain wake up at different speeds than other parts, which can have strange effects--like I start thinking in sensations rather than in words. I wonder if, in your case, the most basic reptile brain wakes up first, senses threat, and attacks. Your frontal cortex, the executive functions of your brain, are still asleep. It sounds really scary to be strapped down. Yet it might be the best of bad options, given that you've broken someone's nose. I could easily imagine you hurting someone, or yourself, worse than that. Yet you'd think there could be another solution, like different anesthesia combinations or something.
cmzPR1Q7aa	Hey buddy,    I was also blessed with being quite short (5'7) so my frame is always quite small. This is actually as I said a "blessing" and it is much easier for people like me and you to add weight to our frames and have a bigger appearance.    First of all you need to get down to the basics. You want to gain mass, how do you gain mass? You eat! Your diet will be the key factor in adding quality mass to your frame.    Diet is an entire different story but you asked about supplements so I will give you the inside scoop on what supplements work.    1. You will need a quality Protein. You will want a Fast Digesting Protein (Whey) for your pre and post workout supplementation. You will have a protein shake 30-45 minutes before you workout and 30-45 minutes after you workout. Your post workout shake will need fast digesting carbohydrates so you might consider making it with a variety of fruits. Two scoops of Vanilla Protein (Im assuming the average protein serving per scoop is 20-22 grams), Two Bananas, Two tablespoons of Peanut Butter and you have one of the best tasting and best performing post workout protein shakes available.    The second protein supplement you will want to look at is an all day protein (A combination of Whey and Casein Proteins) This type of protein is best consumed throughout the day and right before you go to bed. I use CytoSport Muscle Milk as my all day protein. All of the flavors taste great and all you need is water to prepare the shakes.    2. Creatine is a great supplements to add both size and strength. Creatine Monohydrate is the most "well-known" creatine on the market but it is outdated and will bloat you beyond what you think is possible. I am a fitness model and when I first started lifting I used a simple generic creatine monohydrate. My strength went through the roof but the water I retained made me look chubby and I eventually had to quit using it as my ab's became less and less defined. Spend the extra money and go with a quality Creatine Supplement. The only creatine I will recommend to my Clients are:    a. Gaspari Size-On  b. Controlled Labs Green Bulge    Sure there are many other creatine products on the market that work just fine; however as a fitness model and a Fitness Coach these are the best performers for all of my clients.    3. Beta-Alanine. I am one of the few people that will recommend Beta-Alanine as it is a relatively new "in" supplement. Beta-Alanine will increase your endurance and help you hit higher reps in the gym. I was involved with AEN's testing of IntraXCell when it first was released and to make a long story short; I got ripped.    Please Check out Athletic Edge Nutrition's IntraXCell.    4. Beyond those three supplements you can go many different ways but nothing will compare to the combination of the first three supplements I mentioned.    You may want a quality pre workout supplement such as No-Xplode which basically is Nitric-Oxide (a vaso-dilator which expands your blood vessels allowing more nutrients in to the muscles) Caffeine (Will  get you jacked up and ready to move iron) and a bit of CEE (One of the best creatine types on the market)    Beyond these supplements it will boil down to your diet and how hard you train. Remind yourself everyday what Supplements are; Supplements are used to SUPPLEMENT your DIET.     Get 1.5 - 2 grams of protein for every pound on your body, get 8 hours of sleep every night, go to the gym and train HARD, eat many small small meals throughout the day, take your supplements and in a year you will have a body that will make you feel proud.    Please check out http://www.myonlinesupplements.com for great Diet, Supplement and Workout information.    -Dylan|`|oTHGgowsaa	It's not simple, you have to know what to eat, how much, and how often. Also, if you don't want your extra weight to turn into fat, you need to work out either to build muscle or just to burn off calories. Eat lots of calories, eat about six 500 calorie meals per day, more carbs and protein than fat. Protein and carbs both contain 4 calories per gram, while fat contains 9 calories per gram. Just get more calories than your body needs, I love bodybuilding, and there's a free program online at www.fitday.com which lets you keep track of how many calories your getting, what kind, and how much your burning and how your burning them. If you want to build muscle you should be getting 0.88 to 2 grams of protein per pound you weigh DAILY. And be sure to work these proteins into repairing and therefore building muscle tissue so it doesn't go to fat. Unsaturated fats like olive oil etc. are good for getting some quick calories, but try to eat lots of animal byproducts. Also, if your having trouble getting that many grams of protein per day, you might want to consider a suppliment. There are all natural ones like 100% whey protein, and that way you can get the protein you need. If you want e-mail me (thefreshprinceofvernon@hotmail.com) I'd be happy to e-mail you a list of weight-gaining foods and ways to work them into muscle. As far as supplements go, I'd say 100% whey protein to build muscle, it works for me, but whole foods are much better, only use supplements when your not getting enough nutrients from whole foods
6da5a77fa2ae9ecdc85aad0e7e8f2db3aa	Hey Foxy :)    Some of us have had this discussion a few times on an Australian low carb forum. Firstly, Japanese supermarkets usually stock them, I don't know where you are but assuming all states have one then Chinatown is usually a good start. I found some in a Japanese supermarket in Chinatown, Adelaide, I posted a picture of the ones I found in this thread: http://www.apinchofhealth.com/forum/vbb/...     Later in that thread I know another lady found some online in Australia, plus there should be a few other places mentioned in there or in some other threads on shirataki. I remember Melbourne markets was one place.    Good luck :)
rv5vSzXuaa	Squats will do the trick. They work your legs and your butt. So it'll skinny up your thighs and give you a great lookin *** while you're at it. I would recommend doing at least 20 - 25 if you feel tired at the end, make sure to stretch by reaching for your toes without bending your knees. Do that for a couple weeks and you'll be fine for your legs. Also to get rid of the belly, do jogging, biking, or dancing. If you're going to jog, do it for at least 45 minutes, don't slack off in between though. Dancing, never tried it but it looks great for getting rid of belly. Biking is hard core leg and abs exercise. Also, if you're having an eating problem, just gradually eat less, don't do it all of a sudden because your body will burn less calories like that. Cut out soda too, it's not worth it, it's just a fizzy drink. Good luck!|`|IYLlupdkaa	run|`|D2k17FDBaa	i would say running, or even jogging, run like an hour a day and you will lose weight all over your body, or run as long a you can everyday if you ahve less time, it is one of the quickest way to lose weight where u want to
g6pqGjrkaa	I hope you are in the early stage of pregnancy. any way check with your doctor.
JHlS5VDMaa	The headaches are more than likely due to the Accutane. A question, do you wear contacts?  I only ask because contact discomfort and eye/vision related headache has been brought to my attention more than once.  This medication can affect the fit of your contacts.  It can also cause decreased night vision and cause various visual disturbances that may be contributing to, or be the root of your headaches. I would talk to your doctor and let him know about the new symptoms. He may decrease the dose, or give you something for the headaches.   But please be aware that it does NOT "mess with your reproductive system".  The warnings for women are there because this medication causes MAJOR birth defects and abnormalities both internal and external, spontaneous abortion, premature birth and mental retardation. It does not affect your reproductive organs- if it did so it is unlikely you would be allowed to use hormone based contraceptives.  Thalidomide- an immunosuppressant agent- is an example of another medication that has very similair warnings and a prescribing program also very similar to Accutane's iPLEDGE program.  Thalidomide was at one time commonly prescribed for morning sickness and as a sleep aid during pregnancy, until the correlation was made between it and all the babies being born with birth defects.  It is always best to talk to your doctor and/or pharmacist if you have any questions about side effects, development of new symptoms or if you do not feel safe taking your medication.|`|UZxeBrxQaa	Given that the headaches may be dosage related, you might be wise to speak to your physician, or at least call the office and ask about reducing dosage to alleviate the side effect.|`|x3EPqezJaa	I'd go off the Accutane, personally. It's likely messing with your reproductive system, and you're getting menstrually related migraines.
AA12400635	When I was younger I moved into an apartment with some friends, the day I moved in one of the roomies was going to Texas to visit his GF at her school, he wasn't feeling well but hopped the plane anyway and flew out. That night around 10pm we got a phone call from a Doctor in Texas who advised all of us to head down to the hospital ASAP to get either the shot or the pill course as my roomie had meningitis. Apparently it is contagious enough and dangerous enough that my roomies Doctor thought it important to call us in Maine at 10pm at night and suggest we get straight down to the hospital.    That said there are 2 types of meningitis one more contagious than the other, call your doctor or have your son call his and ask for clarification and any precautions he should be taking while waiting for his test results.|`|0IuWhmWUaa	very high, meningitis is very contagious, and im not sure what its incubation period is, but you are vunerable and should get him to hospital asap.  Meningitis patients are highly isolated.|`|kK4GG6Z2aa	Do look at this BBC website as it will give you all the info you need.  there are two types of meningitis- one worse than the other. So have a read and you will be able to decide which one your son has.     I'm sure he will be having tests to find out if he has been infected with the lesser one as being a medic his colleagues would know which type of meningitis he was exposed too.  If they have not isolated him I don't think you have anything to be worried about with regards to him being around people.  Hope the site helps you..and I hope your son will not have been infected in anyway.  Send him my best regards.    http://www.bbc.co.uk/health/conditions/m...
AA11176387	yes, and it does not hurt even if it sounds like it    take a big garlic clove (organic if you can)and peel it. run a thread through it and knot the ens like threading a needle. Insert into vagina (you can also put a few slits in it to increase strength) remove via the string..insert new one ever day or two    some people insert yogurt research on google but I used and preferred the garlic method that I learned from Dr Richard Schulze, maker of the save your life videos    I would try the garlic method and follow it up with yogurt internally and externally (plain organic yogurt not flavored internally) be sure it says it has active cultures on the container|`|47eiwyMLaa	Yeast infections are encouraged to "grow" because of high blood acidity. If you can eat foods that are more chemically like bases (alkaline), your body chemistry will discourage yeast infections.    There's a link below describing pH diets and a link to eHow on defeating a yeast infection naturally. A lot of the advice about yogurt, garlic and sugar works because it is based on the pH of those foods :)    Keep in mind that the natural way may not always cure your specific case of yeast infection. Give it a good effort, but if it's still around after 2 weeks, you might want to consider the OTC medicine or the doctors medicine to cure this one. Get your body chemistry in check and keep very clean with a regular vinegar douche so it doesn't happen often.|`|7576ccf58b0f0d06d5465ee6303c37b2aa	Yogurt with live active cultures is good for yeast infections.  Acidophilus (sp?) at the drug store works too.  If there is irritation in the area, you can also put yogurt there for immediate relief|`|TCFX0S5oaa	Yes, your can cover a tampon in PLAIN yogurt and leave it in over night, you can ties a sting to some garlic wrapped in gauze and leave that in over night, you can eat garlic, you can take a probiotic. All of those things should at least help, if not cure it. Good luck, yeast infections are the worst!|`|hl4kkvXhaa	I've never heard of dipping a tampon in yogurt...but when I used to get them I would eat yogurt and drink cranberry juice.  If you can't tolerate the tartness of plain cranberry, try cran-raspberry because the raspberry is actually good for strengthening the uterus (though many think it is just the leaf, my doctor said that the actual raspberry is also good for this).  Another method I've used for stubborn infections is to drink a glass of unsweetened grapefruit juice, a tablespoon of honey, and a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar.  It flushes the bacteria...but don't do this too often as it can also cause weight loss, so drinking too much can be unhealthy...just a glass a day is fine.|`|qPZ6qzeGaa	Douching with about 3 tsp.of hydrogen peroxide to a quart of water  til' the symptoms subside works great.|`|a8f515200862ad34c4fe6b422c7fd708aa	wash yourself regularly and hang some garlic around your neck.|`|ur3vgbXoaa	PLAIN Yogurt (Not Vanilla, just plain unsweetened yogurt)  Insert a spoonful of plain yogurt into your vagina before bed...but wear a pad - it can get messy.     Yeast Infections, take acidophillus pills.       For the burning INSIDE vagina, soak a tampon in plain yogurt, freeze it, then insert it, and let it thaw.     TO PREVENT yeast infections STOP using scented soaps.                  "Basis" BRAND or Neutrogena "original formula fragrance free" is good.|`|Fyz94ApAaa	At the health food store they sell natural remedies that help. Also you want to stop eating and drinking anything with sugar (sugar is food for yeast), and eat non-sweetened yogurt. You can eat the kind with fake sugar if the non-sweetened is too bland. Yogurt has beneficial bacteria that will colonize inside your body and kill off bad bacteria and yeast.    If you have had sexual intercourse recently you may want to make sure it isn't an STD so if this is a possibility then get checked out too...hope this helps.

ParFJxnSaa	"I always have something on my mind" suggests anxiety, to me" - there is a quiz for it in section 6, at ezy build, below, and for depression, in section 2; page J (see page R, first if indicated). Visit your Uni counselor, to unburden yourself, with completed quizzes.Set yourself a specific time period for worrying about anything, (say; around three quarters of an hour, possibly when you get home, or after your evening meal, but not too close to bedtime) after which, resolve firmly to refuse to even entertain the thought of worrying again on that day: realise and accept that to do otherwise would be counterproductive to your mental health, and enjoyment of life. You will have had your "worry time" for the day, and can just write down any more thoughts that come to mind, and say to yourself: "Well, I'll just have to worry about that tomorrow, won't I?". Doctor Wayne Dwyer once said: "Negative emotions are preceded by negative thoughts". It is important to regularly monitor, and deal with a negative internal monologue (self talk), or mental process, such as disturbing thoughts, images, impulses, or emotions, by the process of (a): recognising it, and (b): challenging it immediately.     Technique For Re-Programming Negative Thoughts: When you notice something negative, such as: "I'm never going to get over this!" or: "Why am I always so pathetic/useless/such a loser?" or even: "I can't do this/will never get over this!", even an image, emotion, or a memory; recognise that this is being generated from the negative part of your mind. Having identified and labelled it, visualise a large, red, flashing, "STOP!" sign, and/or possibly a stern faced person wagging an index finger at you in a negative manner, then say to yourself as forcefully as you can, even aloud in a big voice, if alone: "I know this tactic: GO AWAY FOR A WHILE !!!" You may want to use either: "ruse", "ploy", "game", or "trick", instead of "tactic". In the case of an image, visualise a large "STOP" sign, or your preferred version. Some people go so far as to keep a wide rubber band in their pocket, then put it around their wrist, when they catch themselves backsliding, stretch and release it, as a method of reprogramming their mind sooner, but I don't regard it as being strictly necessary.     Remember to remove it, afterwards, if you use this method. Try replacing a negative thought with a positive affirmation of your choice, like: "I am a unique individual, with my own set of skills, and good points", or "I may not be perfect, but I'm doing the best I can, right now". Practice one of the relaxation methods in sections 2, 11, 2c, or 2i, daily, and when needed. Tai Chi, or yoga suits others better. Alternatively, give the EFT a good tryout, to see if it helps you. There is also a version for use in public places, (if you like, you can claim to have a headache, as you massage/lightly tap your temples, but you would then be restricted to subvocalising: saying it to yourself in your mind). Section 53, and pages 2, 2.q and 2.o at http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris also refer: "Even though I sometimes suffer from anxiety, I deeply and completely accept myself." Neurofeedback treatment for anxiety is increasingly becoming available.     Herbal remedies, such as valerian, (which is not recommended for use if depression is also present) passionflower, or St.John's wort, are often effective, but the idea is (as with anxiolytic medication) to use them like water wings, or training wheels on a bicycle, providing initial support, and giving time for other treatments, such as therapy, and relaxation techniques, to take effect. Imagine, as vividly as you possibly can, that your concerns, anxieties, worries, fears, your self-recriminations, all the agonizing "I'm-so-Stupids," and "I'm-too-fats"; every painful "I-can't-I-have-it" or "I-can't-do-it"are huge raging, hurtful bulls snorting and charging at you. You see them coming at you and you hold out your red matador's cape at arms length and simply let them charge right by. Every time they come at you, hold out your arm with the red cape and let them rage and snort and go right on past.|`|5EFHyGVbaa	I recommend you check out this social networking community called LetsReflect.com.

W3bcdCymaa	No you won't definatley get them you just most likley have the virus. The virus would be HPV, Human Papaloma Virus, they check you for it when you get a pap smear. It's possible that you didn't catch the virus especially if you used a comdom. HPV is what causes Cancer, be sure to go get a pap smear. But not everyone gets warts from it, that is the only way to tell if  guy has it and most men... and women never know they have it (until the women gets cancer) which takes years to develop! So get tested and be safe.... just a fact 80% of women contract HPV.|`|t2R3mEMoaa	You may not get genital warts but you may contract the HPV Virus.

A lot of overweight, too skinny, "unpretty", etc. people will often get depressed. They usually feel that they aren't what they want/suppose to be and they don't like the way they are, act, and feel. Overweight people sometimes also have a problem with people picking on them, which also leads to depression. "Unpretty" kids think that if they don't have the best fashion, best makeup, and they think they aren't pretty enough may lead to depression.
JHlS5VDMaa	To furthur speedracer's answer... lifestyle factors are factors that can be changed/eliminated.  So- as an example only: the risk factors for heart disease: age, gender, smoking, family history, obesity    age = can't change = risk factor  gender = can't change = risk factor  smoking = can change = lifestyle factor  family history = can't change = risk factor  obesity = can change = lifestyle factor|`|ILUYVQ0naa	risk factor could be a predisposition such as diabetes and you are at risk for coma if you don't monitor your glucose, lifestyle risk could be something you do everyday that puts you at risk for something like smoking or drinking

sEUnAmv6aa	tell the doctor it's very important it can effect the anesthesia.|`|eb603a32531b733c208d6a3685da0228aa	You have to make a hard decision here.  Your family member's doctor REALLY needs to know she is taking Seraquel before she has surgery.   When the doctor finds this out, I do not know if they will agree to continue with the surgery or not.  Discovering she has essentially withheld essential health information will make them question what else she may not have told them, or how likely she is to follow the aftercare instructions.  It is not a good idea for her to undergo surgery and take the Seraquel unless the doctor and anesthesiologist both know she is taking it.  Yes it can interact with other drugs that they may need to give her.  If she won't tell the doctor, then you should.  It really is that important.  It puts you in a hard spot, and you can try to encourage her to tell first- but if she won't tell, and you love her, then you should tell.  The consequences could be that serious.|`|Fu6NRGpEaa	First off Seroquel is a antipsychotic/antidepressant. The doctor needs to know for sure. Some medicines have a different affect on the person once they are out of surgery. It could mix with the anesthesia and potentially become harmful. Maybe you should talk to her before she enters surgery or you could pull her doctor to the side and tell him under strict confidentiality that she is on seroquel.
3Kqe5ZrPaa	I never had TMJ but I have all 4 of my wisdom teeth taken out at once which I highly recommend, make sure your under when they do this. I wouldn't want to have it done 4 times, ouch!! Good luck :o)|`|QFf9phAmaa	.......................|`|wRtzGgRxaa	I can't speak for the TMJ surgery, as I have not had it done, but I had my wisdom teeth removed when I was in 9th grade.  I was completely out for the surgery, so, obviously, the surgery itself did not hurt.  After waking up from surgery, I took my prescribed Vicodin every 4 hours as scheduled (even through the night), so most of my pain was well managed.  The biggest thing about pain management is to take your scheduled pain medication at the prescribed intervals around the clock.  Don't take a Vicodin at night before bed and wait to take another one when you wake up the next morning.  Pain medication is most effective when the pain is relatively managed when you are taking the next dose.

You will not finish puberty until you are at least 21 years old!  There will be all kinds of changes taking effect within your body during this time.  They are all called 'growth spurts'.  There are no quick fixes nor magic potions to hurry things along.  Each person must wait their turn to complete development - and you are no exception.  Everything will happen in due time - and not before.  The keyword here is PATIENCE.|`|jCCxrVJyaa	Everything you have mentioned is normal, your voice will change don't worry about it, and your area starts to stink because you either don't wash down their  enough or its smegma causing it.(dried up sperm).|`|XbRc9Hdaaa	1.

Normal Age Range: 9-12, Average: about 10   Male hormones are becoming active, but there are hardly, if any, outside signs of development. Testicles are maturing, and some boys start a period of rapid growth late in this stage.    2.  Normal Age Range: 9-15, Average: 12-13   Testicles and scrotum begin to enlarge, but penis size doesn't increase much. Very little, if any, pubic hair at the base of the penis. Increase in height and change in body shape.    3. Normal Age Range: 11-16, Average: 13-14   Penis starts to grow in length, but not much in width. Testicles and scrotum still growing. Pubic hair starts to get darker and coarser and is spreading towards the legs. Height growth continues and body/face shape look more adult. Voice begins to deepen (and crack). Some hair around the anus grows.    4. Normal Age Range: 11-17, Average: 14-15   Penis width increases, as well as length. Testicles and scrotum still growing. Pubic hair begins to take adult texture, although covers a smaller area. Most boys have first ejaculations. Underarm hair develops. Facial hair increases on chin and upper lip. Voice gets deeper and skin gets more oily.    5. Normal Age Range: 14-18, Average: around 16   Nearing full adult height and physique. Pubic hair and genitals have adult appearance. Facial hair grows more completely and shaving may begin now or soon.    During the late teens and early twenties, some men grow a bit more and develop more body hair, especially chest hair.    Credit: J. Geoff Malta, MA, EdM, NCC Adolescent Therapist  Puberty 101 Archives    http://www.puberty101.com/p_pubguys.shtm...    Most penis growth happens between the ages of 12 and 16 with a subsequent slower rate of growth until the age of 17 or 18.  Remember that growth during puberty often happens in spurts so dont worry if you are a little behind at any particular point... you will probably catch up. Some guys claim that their penis continued to grow until they were in their early 20s.    Approximate erect lengths for under 18s are:  At the beginning of puberty          2.4 (6 cm)  12 to 13 ....... 3.0" to 4.0 (7.6 cm to 10.2 cm)  14 to 15 ....... 4.0" to 5.0 (10.2 cm to 12.7 cm)  16 to 17 ....... 5.0" to 6.0 (12.7 cm to 15.2 cm)|`|qDYsaMv0aa	it sometimes takes time but it will drop eventually good luck|`|68r4mmOnaa	1.

UnSTw2Zeaa	For me, I have always lost my appetite while on just about any pain medicine. But codeine was always the worst. I think It's because it messes with your stomach if it's empty, or if it's too strong for you. After your healed, you'll want to eat again. Don't use them for diet pills though.(not that you would but I'm sure someone is thinking that) They are nothing to mess around with. It sounds like you were having fun before you got hurt. These pills will make it so you never have fun again as long as your on them. I know you didn't ask for all that, but if I could warn the whole world I would. I hope your feeling better soon. Try to eat "something".|`|Fuch8hldaa	yeah.. they are the side effects, i had it before and have been pescribed some last week, i'm taking them only when i need them, i suggest you do the same, you will also experience consipation ..    hope your foot gets better..x|`|UZxeBrxQaa	You can expect to get really constipated!    Drink lots of fluids and increase your intake of fiber, such as Metamucil, to offset this symptom.    The bowels motility, ability to move waste, is severely curtailed by codeine.  You probably weren't prescribed a lot of tablets.  So the symptoms will be alleviated when they are gone.

8IfePMa3aa	Infections are red, hot to the touch, swollen, yellow/green puss, and often have an odor.   Some people get skin tags, allergic reactions, etc. so a check-up with your piercer might be all you need. If you feel it's definitely infected, you must go to the doctor as soon as you can for antibiotics. Do not remove the jewelry! This will create an abscess that will need to be cut open.|`|fna0OfuCaa	I would either take it out now, or go back to the piercer and ask them what you should do.|`|GUOsn4BFaa	Follow these steps:    1. wash it with soap and water  2. apply some hydrogen peroxide  3. apply medicated neosporin   4. cover it with medical gauze and tape    Repeat this process every 4-6 hours.

Get some saline solution & the next time you are in the shower (you need to be naked & standing up) squirt the solution all over the area. Turn your belly button ring (or move it up & down) to make sure you totally saturate it in the solution. If you can squeeze the ooze out, then do it. The opening where the ooze is needs to be cleaned very well & needs to scab up. Peroxide the infected area & boil your body jewelery (unless it's plastic, if it's plastic then soak it in a solution). You need to air the infection out, do not bandage or congest it. That will only create moisture & moisture feeds an infection. There is a chance that your body is rejecting the piercing (this happened to me) & if thats the case you may want to discuss it with your piercer.

If your dentist wanted to pull 8 teeth at one time, that would be different and more of a cause for concern.    I think I had about 3 pulled before my braces.

Hmm.. that sounds a bit sketchy to me. I was a dental assistant for three years and we NEVER did that. I know we had wisdom teeth taken out all the time because most mouths are too small to accommodate all 32 teeth. Having the first 4 pulled (I assume they were your 1st bicuspids) is normal but not pulling 4 more so wisdom teeth can come in. I would definitely get a second opinion with a dentist who makes time for your questions, not one who rushes you out with questions you still need answered.    Good luck!|`|m23PLmvyaa	Do you mean they want to pull 4 more teeth to make room for your wisdom teeth to come in? Because that sounds strange, and I would definitely seek another dentist's opinion.  Or do you mean they want to pull your 4 actual wisdom teeth? That makes more sense.    You need to clarify what exactly your dentist told you before you can get an appropriate answer.|`|RoDjZKknaa	I'm a little confused by your question but am happy to help you.  Sometimes when you enter into Orthodontics they will extract one set of bicuspids, the teeth between your molars and your canines.  You have 8 of them.  After your Ortho is completed it may be necessary to extract your wisdom teeth, they come in behind your last molars and most people - probably 95% don't have room for them, or have them come in well enough for them to be appropriately cleaned daily to prevent gum disease.  You can go for a second opinion, but if I understand what you are saying, it doesn't sound out of line.    Also, they take the xray to determine the location and eruption pattern of the wisdom teeth.  They can determine if they are lying on their side, coming in sideways etc.  This helps them decide if there will be space for them and if you will be able to care for them.  And, most all dentists "multi task"  they go from room to room, caring for one patient as another gets numb, and as another has the assistant take films etc.  It doesn't mean you are not being treated well, or having less than appropriate attention.   Good luck|`|SslUWT0Jaa	I'm only 16, but that sounds like bull to me, especially if they were rushing you around, and not taking there time to explain the issue.  I know that my wisdom teeth are comin in, I can feel the pressure with my front 4 bottom teeth.  I plan to fight the dentist as much as possible to keep a them, even if it mean braces, which I've never had.  I don't see how it would cause a cavity, if you keep up on flossing, and mouth wash.  I'd find a different dentist.
kK4GG6Z2aa	No you won't die.  Your finger is obviously infected and as you say you have had your booster shot it is just infected and you have not got  Tetanus.  However you should go to your doctor or local hospital outpatients it may need to be lanced to let the poison out...A tiny bit of Rusty metal may be inside the finger thus causing the pain and swelling as the body tries to eject it.  The doctor or nurse will probably also give you some cream and maybe antibiotics.  Don't let it get any worse..see a medical professional as soon as possible.  My young grandson was on holiday and somehow managed to pierce the skin under his finger nail with a staple.  He did not mention this to us, then, after spending a day on the beach he was in great pain and we could see redness under the nail.  Luckily it wasn't too far down the finger nail and we were able to cut the nail back and soak his little finger in warm water and release the poison.  The pain went immediately as did the pressure under the nail.Good luck and hope your finger is fine soon.|`|GUOsn4BFaa	Yea I agree.  If you haven't had a tetanus booster in a while, I'd head to the doctor if it starts to get ugly.  But, tetanus isn't the only thing that you could have been exposed to.

It is the cheapest way to go also. The dentist can match the filling exactly also if you chose the white fillings. They have a "shade guide" that they hold up to your teeth before the procedure begins and they can work with you to see which shade you think matches the best.     Hope this helps :)|`|RoDjZKknaa	You can likely have fillings, and the dentist can match the shade so they are not so visible.  If they are in front, though, you'll have to be cautious because eventually the margin of the filling may start to become noticable due to stain etc. If you are a coffee drinker or a smoker this could be a potential problem.  Veneers are beautiful if done by a competent dentist, and don't change the shape of your teeth, they are pricey and delicate, so I would try the fillings first. good luck

It also makes the hair thinner.

A lot of hair could be an indication of elevated testosterone level. This can also increase your sex drive.

uZbDZOAJaa	It's not unusual for a girl your age to be going through this. Teenagers often feel overwhelmed and depressed. There are lots of hormones that are fluctuating in your body. Plus you have the pressure of school and so many choices ahead of you. You are on the right track to go to your counselor, or any adult that you feel comfortable opening up to. I hope she's a good one. I hope she listens well and gives you sound advice. If she's worth anything she'll probably asks you some questions to get an idea of the severity of your symptoms. If you seem like you need more help than just getting things off of your chest then she'll probably give you some information so that you can reach out to people who are more knowledgeable, and better qualified, to help with your particular situation.You sound like a smart girl who just needs a little more support to stay on track. The fact that you recognize that you need a little help, and have thought of positive ways to get it, is a really good sign. Take a deep breath.

Well done :)     Your school counselor would of course ask you why you are depressed and some other questions to access you, to find out the root of the problem. If needed, she may refer you to a therapist or psychologist. What your school counselor needs to follow is ethics whereby what you have said to her must be kept confidential. She cannot tell your friends, teachers or parents what you have told her. If she did that, you have all rights to report her to the relevant authorities. However, she has the right to do so only if you showed any signs of wanting to hurt yourself or someone else.     Good luck.|`|l2mJxB1Caa	she can't do anything except listen. she has to keep confidentiality|`|OOptQPnFaa	ur consulor will talk things through with u although if u want to b kept a secret or you dont want ur parents knowing the results go to a consulor outside school i did when i was depressed and it helps. i know how u feel. i was there last year.  good luck! keep your head up im sure ur a bright fun person!|`|5LR1RZelaa	When I was in high school I went to the school counselor once about depression.

ovi4hOpiaa	one day you will get sick of ppl walking all over you for being shy or for making your plans b/c u cant speak up to make them 4 ur self.|`|5wAAnZPYaa	All that you need is to shed your shyness.You try boldly to be outspoken.One or two appreciations and successes will boost up your confidence.|`|ParFJxnSaa	View the information and weblinks for social anxiety/shyness, and self confidence, in sections 9, and 38, at http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris Here is an exercise that can help you. It is called "Act as If." When you are in a social situation, act as if you are outgoing. Talk more, smile at everyone, ask questions, speak in a normal or excited tone, not a meek tone. Watch some of your outgoing peers, and imitate the style of their social behavior. (I PRETEND that I'm an ACTOR, PLAYING a PART).  Research shows that when you "act as if" continually, your image of yourself begins to conform to your new behavior. In this case, you will gain self-esteem and self-confidence, and begin to see yourself as socially normal, not shy. You will become more socially successful, and this will motivate you to continue your new social behavior until it becomes a habit. Try this for a month, in every situation you can. I am confident that you will become much more comfortable and outgoing.    One form of therapy is to go somewhere that nobody knows you, and deliberately make an utter fool of yourself: put on a paper hat, and scream out: "I'm queen/king of America!", or an alfoil one: "I am Zeguxy, Overlord of the Andromeda galaxy. Bow before me, primitive Earthlings, or I shall vaporise your backward planet!", or something else ridiculous, (make up your own - have some fun, safely) then get back in the taxi, (warn the driver of your intentions, first) or car, and leave. People will point, and say: "Look at that idiot". But, you may not be up to the stage where you can do that, yet (I can, and I used to be shy). Or, preferably in the company of a friend, or family member, on a different train, or bus route to your regular one, call out the names, or numbers of all the stops. It will teach you that, although it isn't actually pleasant, (EXPECT MODERATE DISCOMFORT) you will survive; be stronger for the experience, and the next time (should you need to repeat this type of therapy) will be considerably easier. Remember: "A fear avoided is a fear strengthened; a fear faced is a fear reduced." Regard it as your final test: once you have accomplished it, the barrier will be broken; just don't go too far, the other way! Learn to laugh at yourself, and give a big, cheesy grin when others see you do something foolish, as we all do, occasionally.    It is endearing, if you don't do it too often. Use positive affirmations: for example: "I am very likable and other people feel comfortable around me". Write down all of your self limiting beliefs; then write down the positive counter of them, (exact opposite) and repeat them and imprint them into your mind. Most importantly: Force yourself to approach somebody and initiate some sort of communication. Start out small by asking the time and directions and gradually go bigger. Although there are anti-anxiety medications (anxiolytics) available, these come with risks, and the possibility of side effects, habituation, even addiction, and withdrawal problems, and are unsuitable for young people.     Try having a cup of "Tension Tamer", herbal tea, by Celestial Seasonings, (from supermarket tea, or health food aisles) or make some at home, and cool, then bottle, and drink as needed (I find it so strong tasting, that I need to drink it quickly, followed by something like fruit juice, to take away the taste, but others may find it more tolerable). C(h)amomile tea is a more palatable option. As with all herbal/green teas, use lemon/lime, and/or a little sweetener (NOT ARTIFICIAL!!!) but no cream, or milk. Xylitol, or Stevia is preferable, (health food stores) or fruit sugar (fructose, such as "Fruisana", from supermarket sugar aisles).|`|lXgQ8hXcaa	It is because of one and only fear.

It turned out she wasn't in my year, but later after school I saw her at my bus stop and introduced her to my sister who was in the same year.

But the development of relation will erase invertism. Try to think how many ways you can speak with one/two or more persons.

y6jPCsi2aa	The Anshar Diet    As an American I've seen enough crazy fad diets in my day to fill several weeks full of infomercials and advertisements. As such I'm going to give you the benefit of many years of health and nutrition classes and do my good deed for the year.    I'm going to tell you how to not only lose weight but change the composition of your body, increase your health, and best of all.. keep it off.    First, let's dispel some common myths.    Myth 1:  Eating less calories will make me lose weight.  Unfortunately this isn't always true. A lot of different factors program your metabolism but one of the key things is how OFTEN you eat. If you fast all day long and then have a 500 calorie meal at the end of the day almost ALL of it will be stored by your body.    Myth 2:  I can have a diet with no carbs and be healthy.  This really is a testament to how much Americans want a quick fix. Diets like the Atkin's Diet cause your body to start devouring itself, increase your cholesterol, and in certain cases can even kill you. One thing I WON'T argue, death will indeed cause you to lose weight, permanently.    Myth 3:  If I go on a diet I will lose weight.  99% of people who go on diets will end up putting on MORE weight than they lost from a diet. This is because diet is supposed to be a LIFESTYLE change, not something you do for 2 weeks. If you starve your body it will make fat cells and increase their size even faster.    Myth 4:  I need to go out and exercise to lose weight.  This isn't actually true but it's important to say that having daily activities WILL keep you healthy. If you burn almost no calories every day what else do you think your body is going to do with them? Balancing a healthy lifestyle with a good diet is what you want here, not killing yourself by running every afternoon.    Myth 5:  The scale in my bathroom gives me a good idea of how healthy I am.  The dreaded bathroom scale does NOT tell you how healthy you are. Let's say I have 10 lbs of fat, don't drink water, and have little muscle mass. Then I work out for 3 months and hydrate every day. I lose 5 lbs of fat but gain 7 lbs of muscle and 3 pounds of average water weight. What will happen when I look at the scale? Are you being fair to yourselves? Judge yourself by how you feel, not what a spinning number under your feet tells you.        With these common myths out of the way I'll tell you the secret. It's five simple steps.    ~~The Anshar Diet~~  1. Only eat until you are no longer hungry.  This does NOT mean that you starve yourself. It means after you take a few bites of food ask yourself if you're still hungry. If you're not, into the fridge it goes. While we're at it, CHEW YOUR FOOD. at least 10 times per bite (using common sense if you're eating applesauce, this isn't an excuse to be an idiot).    2. Eat at least 6 (more if your schedule allows) meals a day.  I know this seems counterintuitive, but hear me out. If you eat 6-8 meals a day the meals are very small (often around 100-200 calorie "snacks"), provided you are only eating until you are NOT HUNGRY. When your body is not hungry your metabolism will not try to store energy as fat. It really is that simple. Smaller meals aid in digestion, they increase the nutrition you get from your food, and they keep you from being lethargic. If you eat when you're hungry your body stores MORE of it as fat ("Hmm. I'm hungry, I don't know where my next meal will come from! I'd better hold onto this.")    3. Eat BEFORE you get hungry.  Schedule your 6-10 meals throughout the day and stick to them. If you're waiting until you get hungry to eat you've already screwed this up. Your body stores energy if you're hungry, if your body sees food and just takes what it needs then you're running at optimum efficiency. This is called programming your metabolism.    4. Eat breakfast. Always.  Your first meal of the day is also the meal you have no choice over being hungry for. Your body has been replenishing itself all night and needs fuel. Since now you KNOW that hunger means you store your food then that means you want to keep breakfast LIGHT. A cup of cereal and a banana. A granola bar and an apple. LIGHT does NOT mean you skip breakfast. If you skip breakfast you are telling your metabolism to turn ALL of the next meal you eat into stored fat.    5. Drink water.  (I'm a big hypocrite on this one, but I can't stress it enough) Most people think that if they pick up a glass of orange juice instead of a soda they're doing themselves a favor, and that's not entirely true. A glass of orange juice can have just as many calories as some sodas. Try looking at the label sometime. If you're thirsty, drink water. If you love your soda then have your soda (real soda, not diet, artificial sweetners have been argued to be one of the worst things to ever happen to western civilization). If you decide to have a drink to treat yourself, pour yourself a half glass, don't take a can or bottle with you and for go|`|I5BXiTzLaa	I have many weight loss tips in my blog:  http://rorysblogspot.blogspot.com/|`|zLsj2NGmaa	There is a great free resource over at http://www.fastweightlosetoday.com - they have a whole lot of free articles and information where i am sure you can find the answers you are after - check it out.|`|YNssCMkfaa	Stop buying snack at your high school vending machine( worked for me) or dont eat your entire lunch.|`|93XfX6Ouaa	Don't eat...that's how I do...5'5" and 96 pounds...you know it brahhhh|`|4d3Md9pnaa	The one that's been proved true.  Good eating habits/diet and exercise.    Good diet consists of all your major food groups, and getting a minimum of 1500 calories per day.  Exercise for about 30 - 60 minutes a day.  As a note, it's okay to have sweets, but in moderate. Don't freak out if you mess up a bit.

Just eat when your hungry.    The diet humans have today is soooooooo unnatural.    Humans arent supposed to eat so much.    Just eat when your generally hungry.

Eat 3 meals a day and healthy snacks in between like low fat yogurt, 2 tbsp of nuts, crackers with cheese, or fat free popcorn, etc.  Eat more salads - but be warned a lot of dressings are LOADED with calories such as Ranch, Ceaser. Make sure you check the calorie content before buying or you could ruin your diet.  Drink lots of water throughout the day.  Try making your food at home more, such as soups, they are really yummy, and you can control what goes into it.

3WItFAwlaa	12/26/08 was only a week ago.  lol    You probably have an STD.  Get to a doctor before it causes permanent damage such as infertility.  A yellowish discharge is not normal.  Anyone who says it is a dangerous idiot.|`|Vh5DrXvOaa	As long as it doesn't have an odor you are probably ovulating and this discharge is normal.|`|KeeaVzxpaa	Sound like an infection of some kind, either yeast or bacterial. A gynecologist is the person to ask.
7d281f9b4fc45d76f68621de3af55bc7aa	True - everybody has good days & bad days.  It could be from a health perspective or mental or physical or attitude or mood swings or sexual or otherwise.  Why do you want to know?
d6GLWehvaa	You are probably coincidentally just having sex when you aren't ovulating, or when your fertility hasn't peaked. It's completely normal for women to not get pregnant. If you are worried about it, or even when you're the most fertile you still don't get pregnant, I would suggest seeing your doctor. It's a possibility, however unlikely, that you may not be able to have kids. I don't want to worry you, because it's probably not the case, but you never know. So if you're stressed, the best bet is to go see your doctor.|`|FTRs5w3eaa	It could be any number of things really. The Depo shot is notorious for really screwing with the hormones in a womans body. Even one shot can have effects lasting anywhere from 6 months to over a year!     If you are really worried about it, or want to start having children, I would talk to your gyno. This could be a sign of something else fertility wise, or just the effects of the shot.    Also, you may still be getting your period, but may not be ovulating, which is very common.|`|063067d907467829790739b42988690eaa	http://www.epigee.org/guide/shot.html    go there.  I read a little bit of what this page said.  That shot can possibly lead to infertility.  Hopfully you're still fertile just incase you want kids one day!!|`|dDgwMinYaa	Consider yourself lucky, that is of course you're trying to get pregnant. lol
lvJUDy78aa	Sounds like you did great. If this was your first time, you aren't going to be the stair master right away! In the beginning don't push yourself too much or else you will be hurting your body. Instead, do what you were doing, just a couple of minutes longer each time. If you mix this with a good diet then you should start seeing results in a few weeks. Be patient! Once results start to show, your body will make faster results! good luck|`|8SRjELNBaa	Half the struggle is actually getting to the gym.  So yes you did very good today for your first time!    Try walking at a brisk speed on the treadmill for 30 minutes with 5lb weights in your hand.      The stair-stepper is a pain the first time you get on it, but if you try you will find yourself doing more steps/minute for longer. For example, I remember i hated it.  I started on a low speed for 5 minutes (just like you),  then 10, then 15 minutes... slowly working up the intensity. Twice a week, with other exercise i do the stair-stepper and i'm able to do 65 stairs/minute for 20 minutes.  It's just a matter of building up your legs, which takes time.    As you keep going to the gym, if you push yourself, you will become in better physical shape & you'll notice that you will begin to push your body more.  Eventually you'll find yourself going 5 days a week, instead of 3.    It'll take a few weeks (atleast 4) to begin to see noticeable results if you stick to your plan.    After your done drink atleast two glasses of water & a small piece of meat (like a few slices of lunch meat or a small chicken tender).    Good luck!|`|rv5vSzXuaa	Squats, and lots of them will tone your butt and your quads. Lunges are another alternative. If you want to tone your butt and your quads, you don't exactly need to go to the gym. The gym just offers heavier resistance which leads to increase strength for muscles. If you just want toned, do squats and lunges. You can step it up by holding up a pair of weights while you're doing them.
W3bcdCymaa	Yes it is true... it could just be the hormones but just to be on the safe side take a test, and you don't always have to wait till your next period to take another pack. Sometimes If I have a special occasion or weekend instead of taking the sugar pills and get my period I will start another pack so I don't get my period. But back to your question it is possible you could be prego if u didn't use any protection, but wait it out a week and if you don't get it get a test. goodluck!!|`|GoWPQvgHaa	Your body is readjusting it's self back to "factory settings", so to speak.|`|UiQ6V377aa	Yes it is true. Your body is used to the hormones "telling" your body when to have a period and when not to. Your body gets very confused when you go on and off birth contol.    Chances are you're going to get your period very late or skip it all together. You'll also most likely going to have some break through bleeding or "spotting"    Don't start and stop taking birth control. It confuses your body and it's going to take another 2 months or so for your body to adjust to the hormones in your body.    And remember...while you're off the birth control use another form of protection when having sex please!!!!|`|I8MUpN04aa	your body is all messed up with its hormones now. it takes at least a month for the body to get the hormones regulated when you start the pill, and it also takes time to deregulate the hormones when you stop taking the pill. you shouldn't ever do this again, because you run the risk of getting pregnant. take the pill the way you are supposed to and you will be safe.|`|uqWdNf3Faa	birth control regulates your period. when not on birth control it is completely normal for your period to be a little late or sometimes it can even skip. make sure you are exercising/sleeping/eating right and not stressed out because those factors can also affect your period.

AFBy5aozaa	xylitol is an ingredient that supports saliva production in the mouth. saliva  reduces the chance of a person getting cavities by keeping the mouth lubricated and remain the right ph in the mouth. cavities can be caused by too dry of environment in the mouth.  sara, RDH|`|OhyEivqbaa	It's good sugar!

VLO7e4tMaa	Proactive didn't work for me, and then they keep sending it to you anyway.  This will sound weird, but it DID work... pour some olive oil in a little bowl and mix in some table salt.  Gently massage it onto your face AFTER you wash it.  Leave it on for at least 30 minutes, then rinse off.  Kinda messy, but it really works!  I have dry skin, too, so most of the over the counter stuff just dried me up worse.  Found this recipe on the internet.  My skin was clear and really soft in less than a week!!|`|uefXAfVbaa	I have used proactive before and it works for a while, a lot better than most over the counter skin care formula, for example, Nutrigena. it is also cheap and you are guaranteed your money back. Don't be fooled thought as with everything there is a catch. You have to keep using proactive, after a while (depending on your body) you may get used to it and the acne start coming back. Best case if you can see a dermatologist who can recommend something that best suits you as an individual.
t3A9qpQIaa	If you live near a city with a teaching university medical center, go there and find a orthopedic surgeon who also teaches.  Those guys are the best.  They are not in it for the money and they keep up to date.  Take all x-rays, everything.  Get his opinion.  Insurance will pay for 2nd opinion.|`|831e735ba92bb0dfd3b16be0d4995ccfaa	Who are these "other people" that told you you didn't need surgery and why did you listen to them instead of the doctor ? you might have an infection in there that keeps acting up, if I were you I would see that doctor and find our some facts, not from friends.|`|Xce2KvGnaa	your doctor knows best.  Don't be afraid to do the surgery. It's only on the wrist.  Some people have to undergo more serious surgeries.
NxgUXKE5aa	Because you're desperate for the drug (for the RIGHT reasons), I'd have the school psychologist who recommended that you begin treatment with Adderall (and maybe even the neurologist who diagnosed you with ADHD, although I'd assume it would be mush easier to visit the school psychiatrist, as you see him five days a week) write you something of a "letter of recommendation" for the drug, and then visit a psychiatrist. A diagnosis from a both a neurologist and a psychologist will makes you seem a great candidate to begin treatment with an amphetamine.     *NOTE*: Because of it's lower risk of abuse, Vyvanse is being prescriped in Adderall's place more and more commonly. If you receive, instead of a script for Adderall, a script for Vyvanse, do not be disheartened...Vyvanse is a prodrug of dextroamphetamine (the main ingredient in Adderall), and is BASICALLY the same thing.   All I'm saying is, if you get Vyvanse instead of Adderall, you'll still get the help that you need for treatment of your ADHD.|`|zgfIOZ6raa	i'm taking adderall XR right now and i can say that it has changed my life. in regards to your question, it doesn't seem that you have a general physician so that would be the first step. unfortunately, most of them are private, so make sure your insurance covers the co-pay. the doctor will do a cursory exam to determine whether the medication is a logical treatment course, and if s/he feels that it is, then a prescription will be written. :]
d6GLWehvaa	It makes girls absolutely adore you when you tell them sentimental things, like "I love when I am so close to you", because it shows them that you are deeper than just wanting a sex toy to play with. Also, do oral on her. And if you both are in the mood, do it standing up. Add in a little risk factor by taking her randomly against a wall in front of a window. All of those things will make her go absolutely nuts!|`|aqegafmTaa	If you guys are comfortable enough with each other, get a vibrator! Girls, as much as they hate to admit it, go crazy for these.  Sorry boys, but there's no way you can move your fingers like that ;)   Start by stimulating the skin around her vagina gently ("teasing") and then switch between vaginal insertion and stimulating her clitoris. She'll be going crazy, and after some time, focus just on her clitoris and she'll love it.|`|SslUWT0Jaa	stimulating the clit is great idea, something that vibrates like crazy(somebrands of tooth brushes work great).  world of wonder for you if you use the vibrater thing on clit and you (youknow where)|`|I8MUpN04aa	spend a lot more time stimulating her clitoris. use a well moistened finger, or your tongue, and stimulate it continuously for at least 20 minutes, and then see what happens. after that, you can keep stimulating the clitoris with one hand, and insert the other finger inside her- she will love it.|`|AA11148934	you could always do oral and play with her clit. or you could try to make her squirt|`|8fhOtfgAaa	pencils.  telephones.  your computer.  a tv.  a pillow.  your leg.  a tv remote.    come on, use your imagination.
XEbrGfZuaa	In the month of December I read that a new strain of Whooping Cough  was going around. It can start with you coughing hard to the point of  gagging at the onset. I had it two years ago, and didn't know it was  going around. It is highly contageous and will mimic a chest cold.  People usually don't go to the doctors as they think it's a bad cold.  But they will do something if they find through a blood test, that it is  Whooping Cough. Check for fever as that always indicates an infection. If it's some odd virus, then without a fever they generally will  have you just cope til it goes away on its' own. Until you can see a  doctor, start drinking hot tea and letting it go down your throat slowly  to soothe it. Buy some menthol or medicated cough drops and suck  on them. I had to keep them in my mouth when I slept to keep from  hacking. I had a friend catch this same thing. She went to the doctors'  and I didn't because I didn't know it was Whooping Cough. People  can still spread the virus when they are out and about. You pick up  germs from shopping carts and from passing too close to people  in stores, etc. Wash hands from now on, when you get home and  wipe down anythiing someone else could use, and carry in on their  hands. I think it's a good idea that in Japan, they often wear surgical  masks in public to keep from spreading known colds or anything  else that's catching easily. People should do it here as well.      I'd advise from my own lacking in judgement to see your doctor so  he can run a blood test and not just assume you have a cold coming  on. If he's concerned for your welfare, he'll take the time to order the  test to rule out anything serious and depleting of energy. I was sick  for almost two weeks and sat in an upright position as everytime I  laid back, I'd start coughing again. So I know how miserable you  must feel. I hope you see a doctor soon and get some help.  Take care!|`|ILUYVQ0naa	Every microbe is different and some take a while to show full effects and some just appear all of a sudden, also your condition before you got the virus/bacteria or what ever can effect how you feel, such as not getting enough sleep can lower your immune response|`|Tq3UnaToaa	this happened to me  less than two weeks ago, all of the symptoms were identical. the doctor didnt do much for me but you should go if you are worried, whats the worst that could happen? i got better after about a week but the cough is still with me now. real bummer! hope you feel better =)|`|l0oDymHYaa	Hi Dear    Mix salt in warm water and gargle.

5gkBaGZoaa	I have the same problem. The family doctor can prescribe antibiotics, but if it is continual you may want to see a urologist to check more deeply into it.     There are a couple things that could possibly be causing the UTI to recur. First, if you are sexually active, be sure that immediately afterward, you wash off down there and drink a glass of water. I know this kills the "Cuddly mood" afterward, but it is very important to keep the UTIs from coming back.    Secondly, antibiotics very often cause yeast infections. So if you get a yeast infection, the yeast can get into your UT and cause an infection, so then you take the antibiotics to cure the UTI, and it continues in a vicious cycle. So if you find that you get yeast infections after taking antibiotics, have your doctor write up a prescription for Diflucan along with the antibiotic so that you can take it once you finish the round of antibiotics.|`|kLPaq30Eaa	You should see a urologist. They specialize in that area of medicine.|`|Tt2pFEqFaa	a general practitioner should be okay.|`|bn1Cw4sYaa	Well go to your family doctor, or whoever.

They'll be able to pinpoint precisely why you keep getting UTI's. Good luck and let me know he it goes.|`|MvY4iOaQaa	normal one i thought...second guess would be a gynecologist.|`|uN1zCMmjaa	regular. :)|`|wRtzGgRxaa	You should wait to see the gynecologist until your doctor recommends that route.  Drinking lots of fluid and adding cranberry to your diet can help quite a bit.  Also, use unscented pad when you are menstruating, avoid hot tubs, and urinate before and after sexual intercourse.  These are all ways to help prevent recurrent UTI's
K7x1RHVFaa	Go to a SPA.    Get a deep tissue massage. This will relax you.    Join a gymnasium and try yoga or some sort of meditation to gain focus.    Get a new boyfriend. It helps to have someone to talk to that you do trust.    Never buy microwaveable burritos. The are destined to explode on you.    And just for giggle go see your gynecologist. Some of your behavior could be the result of a menstrual problem. I know that sounds ridiculous but if you look up the term hysteria you might see a possible connection here. It could also be hormonal so have your blood checked out as well.    Good Luck.|`|RVicFEyFaa	Your acting out is the term.

You need this & if it really is exhausted, try group therapy. You are having more then a bummer of a hard time & need others that feel as suffocated, to pull you through. You would also benefit from grief consoling, you've suffered a huge loss & too many changes to wrap a brain around.

s0HTHGd4aa	It seems that Zoloft was working well for you except for the side-effects.  The other two meds didn't work at all, so you weren't even getting relief from the panic attacks.  Have your doc's considered putting you on an anti-anxiety med?  These are debatable meds to be on, due to the fact they are addictive.  Or *can* be addictive to some people.    Back to the Zoloft--depending on what side-effects you were having it may be wise to try it again, maybe at a lower dose coupled with an anti-anxiety med to help even out the attacks.  If you're not on such a high dose of Zoloft, then you may not have the side-effects.    On the other hand, you may want to try another anti-depressant.  Prozac and Welbutrin aren't the only ones out there.  In fact, it can take doing a whole med merry-go-round to finally find the right med and the right dosage.  It's frustrating but worth it when you finally find the right one.    I would talk to your current doc about getting off the med you're currently on and trying another one.  Good luck...I've been there and know it can be so frustrating.|`|a8ea9deb7ab29f8f7b54263085c0e342aa	I know what you are going thought, I have it too, but not as severe.

However, if she is married or in a relationship I would not touch her if I were you. You don't want to get involved in a fight.    Good luck. Have fun!

Don't be scared when it does first come, it seems really gross and abnormal, but all girls go through it. Welcome to womanhood :)|`|kdeiN3k5aa	If you're only 86 pounds you probably won't get it for awhile. You have to wait for your body to get big enough (puberty) and usually smaller girls get their periods later. So probably not for awhile, and if you have been having discharge for 6 months it sounds like you need better hygene. That just sounds gross.|`|uJ7Birl9aa	you will probably get it sometime late this yr.

EDXh0tk9aa	You don't have to insert your fingers to figure out if you have a yeast infection or not.    Different Types of Discharge:    White: Thick, white discharge is common at the beginning and end of your cycle. Normal white discharge is not accompanied by itching. If itching is present, thick white discharge can indicate a yeast infection.    Clear and stretchy: This is "fertile" mucous and means you are ovulating.    Clear and watery: This occurs at different times of your cycle and can be particularly heavy after exercising.    Yellow or Green: May indicate an infection, especially if thick or clumpy like cottage cheese or has a foul odor.    Spotting Blood/Brown Discharge: May happen right after periods, and is just "cleaning out" your vagina. Old blood looks brown. This may occur when you are ovulating/mid-cycle. Your first period can look like this also.    Different types of infections:    Signs of yeast infections:  White, cottage cheese-like discharge   Swelling and pain around the vulva   Intense itching     Signs of bacterial vaginosis:  A white, gray or yellowish vaginal discharge   A fishy odor that is strongest after sex or after washing with soap   Itching or burning   Slight redness and swelling of the vagina or vulva|`|OsT64mqMaa	You can never tell.

23d3af9dcdd255b62e87492847a05af0aa	Ok Ive got the perfect regimen for you:    Im a 21 year old Mixed martial arts fighter who is 5"8 160 pounds, only 11% body fat, ripped abs, in very very good shape..    In order to notice a change in muscle tone, you must do cardiovascular exercise and tone with light weights together so...    (3) times a week you should run on a treadmill for 30 minutes a day at a steady speed, not too fast you dont wanna burn yourself out.    (3) times a week you should do light weight training    Tummy-  bicycle crunches, leg lifts works great for abs, just lay down flat and lift your legs up and down, really kills the abs..    Arms- take 5 pound dumbbells, one in each hand- do shoulder raises, curls, and female push-ups (push-ups on your knees) do 3 sets of 20 repititions.    Thighs- Place your back against a wall, and go half way down, now lift yourself up, you will notice a big difference in the thighs within 2 weeks do 3 sets of 20 repititions twice a week, you can only work your thighs twice a weeks because your always walking on them..    MUSCLES NEED TIME TO REST IN ORDER TO TIGHTEN (TONE).  Hope this was helpful hun, goodluck    They sell dumbells in Walmart, Target etc...|`|XFYOQOOdaa	For thighs I would suggest two things, lunges and squats.  Both of these exercises will tone up your quads, hamstrings and butt. You can also do wall sits. Try doing them during commercial breaks while watching tv and gradually increase the duration.  For your tummy there are a few variations of situps and crunches you can do.  Try doing just regular crunches then follow that with a set of crunches with you legs straight up in the air. That will help a lot with your lower abs.  For your arms you can try using either one of the elastic/rubber workout bands to do bicep curls or just use free weights. To tone your tricep try using a neoprene dumbell. Hold it with both of your hands in a sort of diamond shape and bring it behind your head and extend up. Keep your elbows locked in straight so that you really isolate your tricep. Lastly pushups are always good for chests, arms and shoulders.|`|rNq83Wgkaa	wait, why do you want to get rid of that. I my country that is sexy and show that the women is fertile and is well taken care of.|`|P2eCpu5gaa	To reduce your belly ,  you can do some sit-ups  Arms can be easily toned by Biceps training with weights  Legs can become stronger with running or walking  But to top it all you need to have will power and do alot of exercise coz its not easy to lose weight...  This is just a tip- You should go to a gym and ask the supervisor for instructions or even hire a personal trainer, Hope this helps :)|`|gGDfd5uzaa	Squats are an exellent burning exercise for your whole body. A good thigh one is, lay down on your side, put your top leg over the front of your bottom leg , firmly on the ground and with your other leg which is still layed out straight, make little circles in the air. Its very simple and effective. As for your arms, go out and buy some weights, not heavy ones, I suggest 1 kg each, and lift them as often as you can, this will help with the toning of your arms.|`|9QZhWarmaa	I heard from the Denver Broncos trainer, that the best way to burn fat and or extra wieght. is to walk, not for 20min.. but for an Hour.

MS5OBY9Waa	You are susceptible to TSS any time you use a tampon.    "the risk of TSS may be greater in children and young people because older people are more likely to have the necessary antibodies to protect them from the toxin that causes TSS"|`|kzkrll3Xaa	you have to leave it in for a very long time, you would KNOW if you had TSS chill out woman,|`|a0v3q3J4aa	Any time.     TSS is basically when you leave a tampon in too long and allow bacteria to grow and "poison" you.    "There are two types of this condition. The first, toxic shock syndrome, is caused by Staphylococcus aureus bacteria and has been associated with the use of tampons. (TSS was initially linked to a particular type of tampon, which has since been taken off the market.) Although the exact connection is still not clear, researchers suspect that certain types of high-absorbency tampons provided a moist, warm home where the bacteria could thrive.    TSS can affect anyone who has any type of staph infection, including pneumonia, abscess, skin or wound infection, a blood infection called septicemia, or a bone infection called osteomyelitis.    The second type of related infection, streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, or STSS, is caused by streptococcus bacteria. Most often STSS appears after streptococcus bacteria have invaded areas of injured skin, such as cuts and scrapes, surgical wounds, and even chickenpox blisters. It almost never follows a simple streptococcus throat infection (strep throat)."|`|F2ishnWOaa	TSS is really rare and virtually unheard of. Don't worry about it. If you get it, you'll know at once for sure. But chances are slim. So relax.|`|fd86a2638e2a47fa0b12005b94499a32aa	TSS is a risk every time you use tampons and remember that TSS is far from the only risk associated from tampon use, if you had caught TSS you would know about it as it kills within a week. Within that time I can guarantee you that using tampons has caused other health problems, things such as cramps or infections are very common in tampon users but as many dont know the risks they dont put two and two together so never realize its tampons causing the problems. Tampons cause TSS, various vaginal infections, increased flow and cramps, and are linked to illnesses like cancer and endometriosis. Take a look at TSS sites such as http://www.toxicshock.com and http://www.tamponalert.org.uk also sites about other tampon risks such as http://www.spotsite.org and http://www.frontiernet.net/%7Eruthb/Tamp... What you have to consider is that tampons prevent vaginal cleaning and give bacteria somewhere to grow, over time bacteria multiply remaining trapped within your vagina along with decomposing menstrual material. Tampons also absorb vaginal fluids drying your vagina causing ulceration which along with certain bacteria causes TSS, many brands contain synthetics that cause more damage, and chemicals which increase bacterial growth.     Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS) is a potentially fatal illness that can affect anyone but most common in menstruating women using tampons, it's caused when the common bacteria staphylococcus aureus start to produce TSS-toxin1 that gets into your bloodstream and attacks your body. Initial symptoms are fever, sore throat, headache, aching, vomiting, diarrhoea, red eyes, skin flaking around hands and feet and low blood pressure. Symptoms begin after your period starts, and you may not get all symptoms, but if you suspect TSS remove the tampon saving it then go to hospital telling them you suspect TSS, even if you have doubts quick action may save your life. The serious phase lasts 4-5 days and it can kill within a week, survivors can take months or years to recover and are left with life-long health problems such as kidney/liver damage and deafness/blindness. The risks are increased if you use commercial tampons such as Tampax due to synthetics, additives, chemicals and bleach used within the tampons. TSS can occur any time you use a tampon, from as soon as you insert a tampon.     You need to take precautions to limit your risk of TSS and other health problems, as well as changing often don't use tampons at night as less blood flows into them so more vaginal fluids are absorbed increasing damage, same as using tampons when not menstruating or during light days. Using tampons all the time increases risks by a factor of 33 so alternate as pads give your vagina a chance to clean out bacteria and fibres left from tampons. For each 1g increase in absorbency risk of TSS is increased by 37% so use the lowest absorbency for your flow. Organic tampons such as Cottons http://www.cottons.com.au lower risks as they don't contain synthetics or chemicals. TSS is a small risk but still an avoidable risk, if not TSS then you are certainly very likely to suffer serious vaginal infections from misusing tampons. To avoid health risks all together I'd recommend you look into menstrual cups like Divacup http://www.divacup.com or softcups like Instead http://www.softcup.com which are internal like tampons only far safer and hygienic so there's no risk of TSS or other health problems. Cups can be worn for twice as long as tampons, up to 12 hours including light to heavy flow, before your period, during night and for sports, plus menstrual cups don't ever leak like tampons do. Cups are superior to tampons as they're easier to use, less fuss, less mess, convenient, reliable, safe and clean.
bZSpHPEOaa	Yes dear depression and stress do cause irregular periods ...and that brown -ness.....but browness should be followed by atleast a day of regular blood flow.  Poor diet too is another cause of such a condition.  Take proper diet, exercise 15 minutes daily, relax and you should be fine next month.....|`|F2ishnWOaa	It could. Although I've never heard of it being this extreme. Depression usually causes your body to be stressed out and that affects your hormones. But I don't think it's something serious. Just relax and try to be more optimistic. :)
fd86a2638e2a47fa0b12005b94499a32aa	You can go swimming while on your period, there is nothing you cannot do while on your period but although menstrual flow isn't toxic and there could certainly be worse things in the pool, it's not pleasant for other people to see your menstrual blood in the pool so you need protection.    TAMPONS AREN'T THE ONLY OPTION!     Most people use tampons for swimming but they are hugely unhealthy and unhygienic, they are better than pads however have down points as they have strings you have to hide, they absorb pool water that can feel uncomfortable, and they need to be changed often as they leak  leaking in the pool will be embarrassing. There are a lot of other options you can use, just most people are ignorant so don't know their options, one option is using sponges which are like tampons only a bit better as they have nothing showing outside your body and they are slightly better for vaginal health than tampons. Jade & Pearl sponges http://www.jadeandpearl.com      Pads can be worn for swimming, but some will go soggy in water and come unstuck, you'd have to use cloth pads but only with light flow as when wet pads can't absorb as much flow. Period belts are longer than pads fastening around your waste so better protection and easier to hide, better still would be period panties, underwear with pads built-in so sit closer to your body giving you more protection. With pads wear shorts over the top to hide them. Lunapads cloth pads and padded panties http://www.lunapads.com Reddy's period belts http://www.reddyspads.com     Menstrual cups are the best option for swimming as well as in general for dealing with menstrual flow, they are bell-shaped cups that collect menstrual flow, they are healthy, hygienic and more reliable than tampons or pads. You can leave them in for 12 hours without leaking so are better for swimming as you don't have to worry about embarrassment, they don't absorb pool water, and there is nothing outside your body so they are more discreet. Softcups are a similar idea, they are like menstrual cups but made from soft plastics and diaphragm-shaped so sit further up in your vagina. Divacup menstrual cup http://www.divacup.com Instead softcups http://www.softcups.com    You can go without any protection at all if your reaching the end of your period and blood isnt so frequent, its not gross or unhygienic as long as it is a chlorinated pool, however you can only really do this if your period is very light. Its a myth that your period stops in the water, however flow does not come out of your vagina constantly so when light very little menstrual flow will be leaving your body, not enough to be noticed during swimming. I would suggest wearing shorts over your swimsuit or getting someone to watch your back in case you leak, its not exactly the best idea and certainly there are better options but it is an option none the less.|`|1MGXHYq9aa	Being a Great White Shark, I have to swim no matter what period it is.|`|AFkjkqcSaa	You can only use tampons hunny, I swim with them in and they are fine.|`|oEOo9U7iaa	If a great white doesn't chomp you, an alligator will.

Tampons really aren't that bad, they're so much more comfortable than pads, you can hardly tell you have one in and you don't feel yourself leak or feel like it's obvious your wearing one, although I know some people are nervous about trying them... I wouldn't recommend swimming without one.|`|7Q7dFghmaa	Your other option is to push your trip back 1 week and avoid the problem altogether.

When you're in the water, the water will stop anything coming out (just like it does when you're in the bath), but when you get out of the water it could get embarrassing.  It sounds to me like your options are to get a box of tampons for your trip or go to your doctor and get birth control to prevent your period for your vacation.   I hope that helps.

8SPRJUHIaa	I would go see a doctor.  Is there anyone you can get to take you?  I don't know how long ago you gave birth, but it could be related to the birth of your babies.  If it's been long enough after and you're not breast feeding it could be your period, but I still think I would go to the doctor and get it checked out.  Especially if it gets any worse, but I would go before that point.    If it is menstrual cramping, it can get really severe for some women, some need prescription medication, other's can use over the counter painkillers.  I take Pamprin.  However, if you are breastfeeding you will need the advice of a doctor anyway.      Like I said though, I would go see the doctor.  Hopefully you have someone that can help you with you're children and take you to the doctor.  Go see you're doctor.

AA10766729	Monogamy is essential, because the IUD is sitting within your uterus.  It has strings at the end of it, which can act as a conduit to your uterus for infectious diseases (i.e., STDs), which in turn can lead to permanent infertility (fallopian blockage, among other things).      If you're not in a stable, monogamous relationship, it is not recommended that you use an IUD because you are at a much higher risk for contracting STDs.|`|r0BmWIuFaa	You have to be an adult to handle that type of birth control.|`|oy7mNHJNaa	They recommend a stable relationship because it does not protect against STD's.

DJvrrVFCaa	once you have reached your target weight, you need to go back on a balanced diet of at least 1900 kcals a day-otherwise you will continue to lose weight, nutrients and it will affect long-term health. you will probably put on weight when you start eating properly at first as you have been starving your body on 1200 a day and as soon as you start eating, it will 'hoard' fat and water as it doesn't know when the next meal will come because it has been 'starved' for so long.    'In broad and wide averages "normal" people who eat about 2000 calories a day or need about 2000 calories a day enter into starvation mode around 1,000 to 1,2000 calories a day.'    Check out the facts here: http://www.answerbag.co.uk/q_view/628480    or type 'starvation mode' into google.    especially when exercising to lose weight, you need to be consuming 1500 kcals a day in order to prevent your body entering this mode.|`|8K4Hxc5baa	Muscle is heavier then fat so on the scale you will appear to be heavier since you have muscle.

ylh8dRokaa	Usually girls tend to start their periods around the same time their mothers did. If you are comfortable talking about this subject with your mom, I'd say ask her how old she was when she started menstruating. You'll most likely start your period around the same time.  If you already have pubic hair... and discharge... I'd say give it about 6 months. Have your breasts been growing as well? Are they extremely tender and sore? These are all indications that your period will start soon.   I got mine when I was almost 13. It kind of sneaks up on you when you're not thinking about it. So if you are constantly thinking and worrying about it, it may delay it.  Enjoy it while it hasn't come yet.

If you really think your thighs are a problem, you can start doing exercises that focus on thighs (a lot of thigh exercises also tighten hips and/or other parts of your body).    I couldn't find anything, but I'll bet if you search Google or ask some friends, you'll find perfect exercises (if you feel it's needed).|`|oKDYbBr0aa	Two words: Burger King. Hahaha!

blneMcSZaa	Listening to songs like these...    http://www.motivationalpower.net    You could also do incantations.

TAKIN' IN SPERM, AND SPITTIN' OUT BABIES!|`|mOKZRbfSaa	No, not exactly. Like penises every vagina is different. It's also harder to measure a vagina as it is internal. The size of a girls vagina though can be determined by many things, but I doubt race plays a role in it. If a girl is a virgin, has never used a tampon ( or very rarely) and has never given birth then she may be quite small in terms of the opening,  On the contrary, if she is larger and has had kids vaginally it may be wider......  Of course weight and height play a role too. I've seen health exams in class and can say that they vary greatly like penises, but unlike a penis its different in measurement, and does not correspond to race.  Hope this helps!
vEGkSHMsaa	Right here my friend    http://startingstrength.wikia.com/wiki/F...    That has plenty of videos and detailed explinations on how to do the lifts properly, if you read it and are interested, drop me an email and I'll hook you up with some more info (free of charge of course[seems like everyone on here is trying to sell people something])|`|qHUcyrytaa	The cheapest and best way to get started is with some dumb bells. You can do arm curls and use them for bench pressing and tons of others exercises. There are hundreds of exercises to do that works different parts of your body.|`|c8sqeza4aa	I say, from my personal experience. Start from almost nothing  If you have a Weight set, like one of each size.  Then start from 1 for 3 days. Then go up to the next size for 3 days, then again, then again, until you are at the top.  My advice is to do it in the morning and in the evening.|`|TuOp3hNPaa	join the football team an lift with them. ull learn how to lift an get stronger an bigger an then u can either play football or jus not go out for the team.|`|RCWDyzogaa	You need to put together a routine.  A few things to help you get started. . .Use dumbbells to help isolate the muscles more instead of doing regular bench press all the time.  Dumbbell press is what I am trying to tell you to do basically.  This will help build your chest a bit.  You can then do dumbbell flies.  Be sure not to do more weight than you can handle.  This is done the same as the Dumbbell press.  Lay on a flat bench, press the weights, but instead of doing a constant press up and down like the dumbbell press, lower the arms in an outward motion (almost as if you were doing to try and fly away hence the name dumbbell flies) and bring them back up in a motion like wing flapping.  Do this for the desired amount of reps.  My suggestion is to youtube this if you have problems understanding my description.  For an effective workout you should go up in weight every set at least 5 pounds.  For example: do a set of 12 reps with 25 pounds (if you don't lift often this may prove to be heavy because your muscles have not been trained for this type of motion).  Then a set of 10 with 30 pounds and the last set of 8 reps with 35 pounds.  You will see dramatic increases in strength as the weeks progress if you do not cheat the rep suggestion and weight suggestion.  Also, let me remind you that a good diet is the key to becoming ripped.  You do not have to eliminate junk food completely, but do try to eat healthy.  Carbs give you the energy you will need for your workout.  I personally drink a protein shake about an hour before my workout and then I drink another immediately after my workout.  This helps you rebuild muscle fibers and form new ones to build bigger muscles.  Once you see results you will start to feel better and you will get into a routine of healthy eating habits and lifting on a regular basis because you don't want to lose a body after so much hard work.  Also try to make it to the gym at least 4 times a week at the least so your muscles get conditioned to a constant workout schedule.  If you want I can give you more suggestions for lifts, just email me and I'll tell you my workout program.  Works pretty good considering the results.  I was 216 a month ago and now I am 190.  So that is 26 pounds in a month, not supposed to be able to lose that much weight, some is of course water weight, but with the hard work comes the results.

UDKLeWd2aa	well you see if you workout but take lots of protein shakes, then you wont feel sore becuase most of the healing of muscles has been done, i tried it, once i worked out with out protein shakes and the next day i was sore, but then when i started taking protein shakes, i was not sore|`|Yatf7VIoaa	Well did you just start working out? or have you been doing it for a while now? if you just started then you either didn't workout hard enough. if you have for a while then your muscles are used to being worked.    For you triceps: Pushups, Bench press, Reverse curls(lay on back and arms over head stretched out grab your weight or dumbbell and with out bending your elbow lift the weight till it is over your Pecs. like doing a leg lift but with your arms.     Your Biceps: Hammer Curl dumbbells(one arm then the other), Incline dumbbell(lay on bench with incline),Barbell curls, Barbell curls against an incline(laying your chest on the bench. Chin ups.    True muscle fatigue is experienced as a marked and uncontrollable loss of strength in a muscle, arising from the nervous system (motor unit) rather than from the muscle fibers themselves. Extreme neural fatigue can be experienced as temporary muscle failure. Some weight training programs actively seek temporary muscle failure. meaning being sore after is one of the goals after a work out.  Hope this helps|`|f6YsA2kfaa	i know the feeling, but i would say the muscles were not pushed hard enough.|`|7fzlQ3Kgaa	well u may not b sore depending on what all u r doing. i work out 3 times a week for football and my muscles don't and hardly ever did make me feel sore.    and if u work out in a gym ask the personal trainer since there r so many different workouts. they would know best. or u could get involved in school sports if u r still in school  and school sports like baseball, football, basketball all usually strengthen u.  hope that helps

Kk6LQAf9aa	I'm 44 years old. I have three daughters - one with behavioural difficulties, one with autism and, the eldest, a stroppy teenager. I spent the early part of my 20's not wanting kids, then I got the nesting feeling and three kids, a messy divorce and quite a few years later I'm paying the price both financially and mentally.    You have a wise head on your shoulders. Listen to it and not to mother nature. Mother nature is very persuasive in convincing you that your kids will be different to everyone elses.

When we become upset, our brains and bodies overreact and work overtime by producing chemicals and hormones.    Crying helps eliminate these extra chemicals that we don't need.    The chemicals and hormones disappear from our body through the form of tears. As our tears flow, they sooth our sadness or distress by withdrawing these chemical agents.    That is why many people feel calmer or more refreshed after crying--because the tears get rid of these hormones that are produced when we are sad, happy, or distressed.|`|J5SwPR0qaa	Crying can also help to flush out any irritating matter caught in the eyes.

A neuronal connection between the tear duct and the areas of the human brain involved with emotion was established. No other animals are thought to produce tears in response to emotional states,although this is disputed by some scientists    According to a study of over 300 adults, on average, men cry once every month, and women cry at least five times per month, especially before and during the menstrual cycle, when crying can increase up to 5 times the normal rate, often without obvious reasons (such as depression or sadness).

fd86a2638e2a47fa0b12005b94499a32aa	TSS is a real risk from as soon as you insert a tampon, the risks increase the longer you use a tampon so you need to change every 4-6 hours. What you have to consider is that tampons prevent vaginal cleaning and give bacteria somewhere to grow, over time bacteria multiply remaining trapped within your vagina along with decomposing menstrual material. Tampons also absorb vaginal fluids drying your vagina causing ulceration which along with certain bacteria causes TSS, many brands contain synthetics that cause more damage, and chemicals which increase bacterial growth. Tampons cause TSS, various vaginal infections, increased flow and cramps, and are linked to illnesses like cancer and endometriosis. Take a look at TSS sites such as http://www.toxicshock.com and http://www.tamponalert.org.uk also sites about other tampon risks such as http://www.spotsite.org and http://www.frontiernet.net/%7Eruthb/Tamp...       Why do you want to stat using tampons? In this day and age there is no reason for women to use tampons as there are many other options that are not only safer and more hygienic but also easier to use, more convenient and more reliable than tampons. If you do use tampons you have to take a lot of precautions as well as changing often don't use tampons at night as less blood flows into them so more vaginal fluids are absorbed increasing damage, same as using tampons when not menstruating or during light days. Using tampons all the time increases risks by a factor of 33 so alternate as pads give your vagina a chance to clean out bacteria and fibres left from tampons. For each 1g increase in absorbency risk of TSS is increased by 37% so use the lowest absorbency for your flow. Organic tampons such  as Cottons http://www.cottons.com.au lower risks as they don't contain synthetics or chemicals. TSS is a small risk but still an avoidable risk, if not TSS then you are certainly very likely to suffer serious vaginal infections from misusing tampons. You need to know the symptoms of TSS, initial symptoms are fever, sore throat, headache, aching, vomiting, diarrhoea, red eyes, skin flaking around hands and feet and low blood pressure. Symptoms begin after your period starts, and you may not get all symptoms, the serious phase lasts 4-5 days and it can kill within a week so if you suspect TSS remove the tampon saving it then go to hospital telling them you suspect TSS, even if you have doubts quick action may save your life. You also need to know how to spot vaginal infections, which are very common in tampon users, and make sure to keep up with regular check-ups to do all you can to prevent vaginal health problems.     I'd recommend you look into menstrual cups like Divacup http://www.divacup.com or softcups like Instead http://www.softcup.com which are internal like tampons only far safer and hygienic so there's no risk of TSS or other health problems. Cups can be worn for twice as long as tampons, up to 12 hours including light to heavy flow, before your period, during night and for sports, plus menstrual cups don't ever leak like tampons do. Cups are superior to tampons as they're easier to use, less fuss, less mess, convenient, reliable, safe and clean.    EDIT: TSS can be contracted from as soon as you insert a tampon, it is not just an illness that is contracted if you leave a tampon in for too long. The longer you leave a tampon in the greater the risks due to more time being given to bacteria to multiply, but the risks are always there. TSS is very rare but not nearly as rare as people make out, only around 1/3 of all cases are recorded so many more cases occur without people being made aware of them. Furthermore rare or not TSS is a serious life-threatening illness caused by tampons, and made worse by harmful ingredients used to make tampons, women should take these things more seriously.|`|dALX1qQdaa	nope.  dont sleep in them. and take them out every 4-6 hours and replace it|`|CdbTaQU0aa	using tampons is ok as long as you use them the right way. the longest you can keep one in is for 8 hours but if your flow is medium-heavy then i would change it probably every 3-4 hours. you can't get TSS as long as you don't keep in the tampon for too long. if you do start using tampons, just make sure that you don't go over 7 or 8 hours and DO NOT go to sleep with one in. put on a pad when you go to bed instead.|`|5hyr0dPraa	toxic shock syndrom is very very very rare.  chances are you wont get it.  As long as you clean your hands first and follow the instructions properly.  Dont sweat it girlie. :)|`|ohsxAbeuaa	me being a female you can get tss if your not clean with you tampon. but if your on top of it, and change it when it needs to be you have nothing to really worry about.|`|MgZXxgqUaa	Use pads! You can sleep in them! You can't get TSS from pads OR tampons. But if you don't want to keep changing than use a pad
sQxPTjUAaa	your not always going to gain weight when you gain muscle, sometimes you wont lose anything but its basiclly your body replacing the fat with muscle, so even though you might werigh the same or more, you will see that clothes fit better ect. for example, a swimmer like me can weigh 150lbs but when everyone guesses my weight they will guess 120-130...and someone who never really worksout and who eats junk and weighs 150lbs it will be much more noticable.    one way you can measure body fat is google "body fat calculator and put in the numbers it asks for|`|UwiGwDGdaa	Yes, gaining muscle will cause you to gain weight. Muscle weighs more than fat.     Your body measurements and strength ability are a good indicator of muscle mass increase. You might find your waist size decreasing and your arm size increasing, for example. Another example would be you can bench press 120lbs now when four months ago you could only bench press 100lbs...or you can run one mile 5 minutes faster than you could four months ago...and so on!     There are certain electronic scales that measure body fat, or you could try the old method of fat calipers. These are all available for use if you go to a gym.      If you're exercising 2 hours a day, unless you're training to become a professional athlete, that's a bit obsessive and dangerous, especially if you're not under the supervision of professionals. Overworking a muscle group and not giving it time to rest will cause tears in your ligaments and even LESS strength. The body builds muscle AFTER a workout (usually in the 24 hours after a workout), meaning that if you never give your body time to recover, the muscle will break down and not develop.     Are you alternating muscle groups to prevent muscle deterioration?|`|XHnpraaxaa	To gain muscle you must eat more protein foods and do more exercise.|`|MePCnsaYaa	I bought a set of scales from Boots (in the UK) that measure body composition. They were by weightwatchers and cost about 50.  They measure body fat % and also water %.    If you are 12% fat (which I have to say, seems way too low to be healthy) you are not 88% muscle.  You will be about 50% water and also have bones and internal organs before you get to muscle.    Anyway, body composition scales will track any gain or loss and you can set targets|`|FyI9qlxBaa	im not sure.. i think if you gain fat you can tell because you are more flabby, but if you gain muscle weight then you can tell because you are all firm and toned up
b77c2aa72e0d0d360129311f88b3a5c0aa	I know someone like this and it IS an illness. They seem to leap from one debt to another. One debt is cleared up and then if she gets depressed her bank card gets a real pounding! Also she takes most of the stuff she buys back to the shop. I try to help and have bailed her out of many scrapes before her husband has found out! I can no longer do this as MY funds are depleted now..... I call this OCD. I expect you have heard of  Obssessive Compulsive Disorder. Doctors do recognise this one and there is help out there. It's just whether your Mum is willing to see someone about it.

She is needing help...not a label. You need to be supportive, not vindictive....|`|s2IOyj8iaa	she is certainly a shopa holic and maybe her credit cards need to be destroyed. Perhaps you can have a garage sale and reap in some money to help her debts. I was reading an article only yesterday in our Australian newspaper about a new film being released about a shopaholic .the actress in it is an australian girl I believe they may now live in America Isla Fisher whose partner is Sacha Baron Cohen she went along to meetings for shopaholics to help her in her acting role and found various forms of shopa holics . so there is help out there. And maybe you can take Mum to the film I think its called Confessions of a shopaholic. You can try googling it.

bFKjV7U5aa	When I was diagnosed with ADD, and began taking Adderall to treat it, I found that it REALLY helped my winter blues. I think its because when my ADD is being treated, I can actually get things done and feel more productive and awake.    My advice to you is to look up the symptoms of ADD and tell your doctor about all of the symptoms that you are experiencing. If he doesn't believe you, find a different doctor.
tZIO9K8Kaa	you  gave yourself an orgasm? i think thats what you said...  but that is totally normal... i mean you know what turns you on and so you did it!!  and with men... trust me... it might be 4x4x4x4x4x4x4x4x4x4x4x4 times before you get an orgasm!!! men are usually selfish when it comes to sex and finding that one person that knows what you like (because you''ve told them) and they actually listen, then thats a keeper!!|`|0uarmMg5aa	There is nothing wrong with you or them they just aren't hitting the right spot.|`|nAvTMXmgaa	Woman usually dont have an orgasm by penetration. there is a low percentage of woman that do.  Normally we have to be stimulated in the clitorix, So use your hand to make some part of the work.  Or make him go down on you.

Good Luck!!!!|`|AA12269955	This is going to sound pervy, but touch your self more often.  If you've only had sex four times and haven't 'gotten yourself off' before you don't know how to help your guy give you the big 'O'.  Guys honestly are clueless about female anatomy. Some have a better understanding than others and it varies all the time, but only you know and understand your body.   So the more you explore what makes you 'happy' on your own, the better equipped you'll be to help your partner|`|RPdtHKk5aa	Don't worry, there is nothing wrong with you. It can be much harder for a woman to have an orgasm than a man.  Next time you have sex, tell your partner what you like, encourage them to do whatever they need to do in order for you to have an orgasm. From my experience, guys like it when you are happy in bed, so just keep trying and it will happen. Good luck! :)
0hSpsSByaa	It may or may not be cancer; that is why your doctor is sending you to a specialist for more tests.  Many women have abnormal cells on a pap test and do not have cancer, so try to stay calm, but you do need to have further tests.  Good luck.|`|8PDzaAJcaa	could be lots of different things, it is possible that the next pap won't show anything abnormal at all, I wouldn't worry too much about it until you see a gyno, then bring all of your questions to him/her.|`|vXzqImKZaa	What causes abnormal Pap smears?  Abnormal Pap smear results are often explained by an infection or an inflammation. Yeast infections, herpes, trichomonas, recent sexual activity, or use of vaginal preparations, are often things which cause an abnormal Pap smear result.   Many times the culprit is HPV or human papilloma virus, sometimes referred to as genital warts. HPV is a common infection in women and has been detected in women in their seventies; up to 60% of sexually- active women may carry this virus on their cervix, genital area, or skin and are completely unaware of it.|`|oy7mNHJNaa	It could mean nothing at all.

TAqwdOK8aa	They can feel and give love. Personally, I have no idea if I have the disorder, but I am very familiar with mood swings. It is just that the perception you hold shifts, and does so, very suddenly. One moment, all can be perfect, and the next, even a loving touch can make you cringe.     You can feel love, though. It is just that, at times, the feeling escapes you, and you forget yourself, is a good way to put it, I suppose.|`|EE7sAaMlaa	if ur bf is really bipolar than surely he would be on meds?? - once diagnosed the doctors pay a close eye on patients and wud neva just ignore someone with bipolar. we can feel and give love, sometimes to the very extreme of anyones abilities, which makes it more painful for us when we are hurt by someone we love. It runs in my family aswell, im 16 and my dad committed suicide as a bi polar, basically he just had terrible mood swings which cause you doubt who you are. I have days when i can cope and i love everyone and then others when i hate the world more than i can bare and i want to die. i put myself in a very self - destructive cycle.|`|a0v3q3J4aa	The best way to describe being bipolar is that:  One day you feel on top of the world, and the next day you feel like you don't even belong on it.     That's a gross over exaggeration though but that's generally how you feel. The manic vs depressive cycles can last weeks or months or years depending on what type of bipolar you are. If you have more than 4 episodes a year of drastically changing mood swings then you are considered severe bipolar.     It's not that we can't feel love. It's that we aren't entirely sure how to interpret it. One day we love everyone and everything around us and not too long after that, we just want to be left alone and hate everything.  It's a very difficult disease to live with.|`|5edd13b91e6ca6a91c699a9220d74413aa	get a new boyfriend and get family therapy with your mother.  you don't need two of these in your life and you can't get rid of mom!

There is no normal or average size for a soft (flaccid) penis because they vary enormously. Some guys shrink a lot more than others when soft. You can NEVER judge how big a guy will be when he is erect from his soft penis size.    Most penis growth happens between the ages of 12 and 16 with a subsequent slower rate of growth until the age of 17 or 18.  Remember that growth during puberty often happens in spurts so dont worry if you are a little behind at any particular point... you will probably catch up. Some guys claim that their penis continued to grow until they were in their early 20s.    Approximate erect lengths for under 18s are:  At the beginning of puberty          2.4 (6 cm)  12 to 13 ....... 3.0" to 4.0 (7.6 cm to 10.2 cm)  14 to 15 ....... 4.0" to 5.0 (10.2 cm to 12.7 cm)  16 to 17 ....... 5.0" to 6.0 (12.7 cm to 15.2 cm)    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penis  http://www.kidshealth.org/teen/sexual_he...|`|HXr2Qeiraa	According to statistics, you're about average.

The only thing that should stick out of you is the string part.|`|UPN3zqq6aa	well i think tampons are comfy to be honest and no its surposed to be all in and only the string hanging out, gawd that sounds weird but yer lol x|`|dALX1qQdaa	nope, just the string.  you dont have it in all the way. i was a virgin when i 1st used tampons and it didnt feel uncomfortable at all.|`|046473fd7f160fe7a30e657aa5faaf75aa	There is a product insert inside the tampon box.  Read it for instructions with illustrations.  The tampon should not be uncomfortable and it should not stick out.|`|g7yLNVK1aa	It should feel a little uncomfortable. But the head part shouldn't be sticking out.|`|zIBj7RV0aa	Im a virgin and it didnt feel uncomfortable for me.. its all in your mind!  If you have and discomfort take it out and try again!! Because when in you shouldnt feel it at all!!    Congrats on getting one in, i know it can be very tricky!|`|sXeyRD9taa	Haha, I'm on the same boat as you right now my mom just bought me tampons and I just tried it(it didn't go well). Hopefully I get the hang of this
hZGhZuizaa	Go to Google and type in BMI and click on the first link and type in what it says and it will tell you what is a healthy Weight, what you have to weight to be underWeightt, and overWeightt.     or here is the link below. i use this.    http://www.nhlbisupport.com/bmi/|`|MpTZjdLJaa	130|`|44fbG4IUaa	i would say about 120-130.|`|piTonkZiaa	http://www.nhlbisupport.com/bmi/    it is a bmi caculator this is how i tell if im a healthy weight|`|AA12298409	Check out this site it will help you.  http://www.nhlbisupport.com/bmi/|`|cRuqfZdsaa	i am 5'7" and i'm 15 and i weigh 145 pounds. i'm not overweight..it's mostly muscle..try a BMI calculator to help you see if you are at the "normal" weight.
XHnpraaxaa	You can add a cup or two in the morning.  If later in the day do decaf since that can also be counted as part of your water intake while regular coffee cannot.  Remember for every cup of coffee you drink that you need to add two cups of water to your daily intake.   It has been proved that caffeine can give us a boost but can make people stay awake or sleep bad even if they have it 12 hours before bed time.|`|eWVqUjtYaa	sure anything u want|`|yhkBh6hPaa	No coffee actually increases your metabolism. Don't drink too much though or it won't have the same effect.
d508e71226a169afed7ebfc7e78bbc5baa	The FLEXIBALL is an incredible product; but there is one great use and there is a good use, the good use is a ball big enough for your toddlers to play with and the incredible use if you don't weigh to much is a flexible chair to sit in.  Any other uses, they don't work.|`|GXrHjEgvaa	It does for me and I've been using one for three weeks    7 and I don't know what else to say about it.
UwiGwDGdaa	You want to lose 20 pounds in a few weeks? That's a ridiculous expectation. You can lose 20 pounds in 10 months if you do it in a healthy way. Unless you're very obese, 20 pounds in a few weeks won't happen.     The best way to look good? STOP letting the media dictate what you should look like, BE CONFIDENT in YOURSELF, and stop giving a crap about what other people think.|`|vEGkSHMsaa	Well, if your expecting to lose 20lbs in a few weeks, its not going to happen (healthily anyway). Best way to lose weight (fat) is by eating healthy and exercising. Cut out fast food and soda from your diet completely!     Fast food is almost always extremely unhealthy, high in saturated fat and trans fat, very calorie-dense, and should thus be avoided by everyone.    Lift some weights, the best routine I know of for beginners is here:    http://newbie-fitness.blogspot.com/2006/...    And do some cardio on your off days. You'll look better in no time.
7mCCAqXzaa	YEA i have one it is the greatest bed in the world my number is a 45 kinda squishy. and when you need a firm mattress for extra curricular activites you pump it up to 100. Really though it is a very comfortable bed it takes you about a week to get your number set but once you find your number that is it. I did not buy the best one i figured the bigger the pillow top the softer it would be i got the medium one there is a bottom of the line medium low meduim and high quality line the pillow top on the top of the line was too soft for me even on the 100 setting.   It has a good warantee i try the memory form and the other ones but those are just a big spoonge getting out and in the foam bubbles pop and eventually will loose its shape.   Sleep number can hold 600 lbs so you cant pop it    curtdude|`|3f3c29287aa543056f2f47ef05dbdf6baa	Try it well at the store first. I didn't like it AT ALL. They had it in a hotel room I was in. It's kinda just like an air bed, and is kinda loud when you blow it up. I felt like I was camping with an air matress, and I didn't find it comfortable. I like memory foam, tempurpedic, or the memory foam matress pads they have at costco (With a sheet under the pad so it doesn't slip) But you know what you like, test a few in the store.
5sSjx4GXaa	I think you will reach the goal of 6 ft 2. When I was your age I was the same height as you. I am now 23 and 6ft 2, so you do have a chance.|`|4MtR8MLpaa	Check out this web site. It even has a growth calculator to estimate your final height.    https://www.nutropin.com/patient/3_5_3_g...
3fd2288554aaf55a30c81ff30a54bba2aa	If your doctor or counselor wants you to go inpatient, then go voluntarily. If they put you on a 72 hour hold, that will go on your record, and you could lose some of your civil rights.  (For example, in some states, such as California, if you are put on a 72 hour hold, then you lose your right to own firearms. If you are a rural person or go hunting, or have a spouse who does, that is quite a problem!)  In at least one state, even going inpatient voluntarily will do that, but that is Illinois.  Texas will get you for having bipolar disorder, though, total discrimination.  Anyway, what I am saying is that you should avoid a 72 hour hold, or social services and law enforcement groups will keep track of you, and do you really want a paper trail?  Go in voluntarily, if you need more help than you can get outpatient because it may well save your life.  Take good care of yourself!|`|0rAgtGNgaa	I know you can be involuntarily committed under mississippi law but I am not sure bout Texas law|`|eWk2AMsVaa	I was by my doctor. The maximum days are 3, if invonuntary.  I was in Ft. Worth. Once they evaluate you they may be able to help you. You are right it is considered a danger to self. If you are admitted. It is not that bad and you may be able to get the help you need. Passing out is not good at all. You need nourishment. And could develope other medical problems.  It also depends how under weight you are.   It is the mental part that is important to take of, that could help in your eating.  Good luck and don't worry.
c14d3b5cbe3c5671fb48605311d2e82caa	no not at all! the ideal weight for your height is 135 and you are quite a bit under that!|`|uJKTR4d2aa	Its impossible for us to tell. The weight is at the right number, but if your fat or not is another question. Look in the mirror. do you have a lot of excess fat? if you do then yes, if not then no.|`|TuOp3hNPaa	cnt tell ya unless i see a pic.  for my weight an height im very close to being over weight but im not over weight at all cuz im all muscle an i looked ripped.|`|RPuZgfyZaa	No of course not, if you think your fat..  im 14 years old and im 5 '' 5 and i weigh 133 lbs,  but apparantly my backs really slender and im a 32c.|`|lXDK0iuraa	that depends, a musculer person will be more than a fat person, so im 5'7" but i am very strong and though I am not skinny by any means I would not say that I was at all fat you have to look in a mirror and look at yourself, if you cant tell ask a good friend seriously|`|8IYZvLLjaa	Uhm, I'm not sure.  The weight doesn't determine anything.  You have to weigh yourself in a special  scale that tells you your fat percentage.  Girls your age should be around 15-25 %|`|IrQVe88zaa	no your not fat, you are just about under the certain weight limit|`|vIUS5J3paa	i spell my name like you!  "ashleigh"        just saying,  anyway, by the way it sounds, your way way way way fine!  don't worry about it.|`|cba5feb703629f6498f3679e65a4cc03aa	no your not fat at all, that sounds like an ideal weight  if your worried about it, just do some exercise every few days and i garentee you will feel better.
72iZuDjeaa	urologists dear...|`|IM3QwSS2aa	the urologist.    Jerome can save you time and money.  Take some STIFF NIGHTS to regain those youthful, spontaneous, rock-hard erections.    s/Jerome, would not sign his name unless he believes in it.|`|Ok3XlTV3aa	A urologist|`|h1XcYcJ7aa	I don't really need to check in with all your good answers but yes, it is a urologist.
vEGkSHMsaa	Lol, I guess you didn't like my last answer. In that case, I heard liposuction works pretty well. Or you could starve yourself and sprint a couple miles every day.|`|8722a385a740fd3c165b65c08ed568ffaa	sorry, but why do you want to do that in 2 weeks>?|`|FaVYRoXqaa	Well I guess you're screwed.  You shouldn't have let yourself get in such a situation.  Maybe you could cut off a limb or something...|`|lXDK0iuraa	honestly it is possible but it is dumb, and depending on the weight you are know the langths it would ake could kill you, but if your willing it depends, an easy way to shed pounds for a short period of time (like if your trying to make weight for wrestling or somthing) is to dehidrate yourself, I would however strongly recomend you dont do that.  I know many wrestlers and before they go to weigh in they wont eat or drink the day before then do an intense workout to sweat, also you say you dont want to hear eat right and exersise, but thats really the only way you are going to permanatly lose weight outside of sergery.|`|a66dbb5b3ea3ac07b4ed2c82e558e892aa	You can't lose 20 pounds in 2 weeks, that's not healthy. At the very best you can lose 7 to 10 pounds. If you try p90x for 3 months you will lose 20 pounds. Say you do lose 20 pounds in 2 weeks, as son as you eat you will gain it back!! Do it the right way and don't rush|`|QOLw2sRMaa	well with the restrictions you mentioned; don't want to exercise, don't want to be anorexic, i would say....     impossible.|`|qFf7jliLaa	I'm sorry to say, but this goal is almost impossible. Of course, what you could lose depends on your height and weight now. The unhealthy advice would be to count calories. When I say this I mean strict calorie intake.|`|sQxPTjUAaa	its not going to kill you, thats silly!    google the scarsdale diet, its pretty strict but the food combonations somehow help in loseing weight reallly qiuckly, i have tried it and it works, just VERY hard to stay on and you gain most of it back once you start eating helathy. i didnt even have to workout on it|`|fcaasfx0aa	uh, I really don't think it's possible to lose that much...maybe in water weight. But a good exercise routine for two weeks will tone you up, and wearing the right clothes can make you look like you've lost twenty pounds. I'm sorry to say, but if you don't have time for exercising then you don't really want to lose weight...    I would say find a flattering outfit.
eQqhFv9yaa	Prozac is a SSRI which has the unintended side-effect of being an antiandrogen which results in a lower libido and at times the inability to orgasm.    Talk with your psychiatrist or physician who prescribed the SSRI for depression. There are a variety of other medications that address the depressive symptoms that don't have the side effect profile you listed.    Really it will be up to you and your psychiatrist on whether you're doing better with the depressed symptoms and poor orgasm or if you're willing to try a medication switch and maybe increase depression as a trade off for orgasms.    A bright side is there are medications that address depressive symptoms that don't negatively affect libido - just talk with your doctor and find the one that's right for you.|`|AA11080047	yes it your tablets am afraid it tells you on the leaflets that comes with the tablets.|`|4MtR8MLpaa	Yes, that is one side affect of it. My doctor had to try several different combinations to help with the depression and have no side affects that hurt my lifestyle.|`|hIsWsxsLaa	Yeah prozac does that, I havent heard of it actually stopping it all the way, but its one of the side effects: decreased sex drive and delayed orgasm.
e205d688e231b13af75443c794fc1564aa	YOu have to be at least 100 lbs overweight with a BMI of at least 40.  You have to be approved first be your dctor and then by a Bariatric Surgeon.  You need to have been significantly overweight for at least 5 years.  You need to document every diet you have been on and ow much you have lsot/gained with each diet.  You need to have been on a medically supervised diet.  You need to see a Nutritionist and psychologist.     If you are approved and have the surgery, you MUST workout.  Even if it means putting those kids in daycare for two hours a day.  If you don't move, you don't lose.  The surgery is not a cure-all for obesity.  Many patients gain all the weight they lose back because they do not chnge thier habits.  Yes, the key is DIET and EXCERCISE even after the surgery.|`|bCmqScVlaa	For the gastric bypass, I believe they want you to be at least 100 lbs. overweight, so you will most likely qualify.|`|cPRuJQ1Paa	I had my gastric bypass surgery through Forerunners Healthcare Consultants in India I don't regret it at all I had a baby since then and I'm still able to take the weight off so far i am very happy. The key is to use a reputable surgeon. You want to be carefully screened beforehand to make sure you are a good candidate. Since my surgery I can walk without getting tired, I can play with my son; I can walk down the street with my head held high. I feel pretty for the fist time in years. I was given another shot at life. The surgery is a tool and how well that tool works is up to you!!    I would do it again in a heartbeat. I would recommend to every one who is suffering from the same problems as I did before but I would urge anyone who is interested to seek the best surgeon possible and make the decision based on the surgeons recommendations and your own personal goals!! Make sure the reasons for the surgery are the right one. The surgery isn't for someone who just "wants to be skinny". Do it for your health, for your life, for family. FOR YOU.    You can checkout their website.  http://www.forerunnershealthcare.com  Hope this helps.
52zR9SHDaa	You are not doing anything wrong, weight will come soon enough.    Don't forget is much easier to put weight on than loosing it.
STGs27mhaa	I'm not sure, probably about 200, 100?   i wanna try this for a week and see how much weight i lose.  I'm Muslim so i fast but you also do catch up because you eat a lot at the beginning and end of the day so i didn't lose much weight like that.
ItJzrvQ4aa	jogging is an excellent exercise because it let you lose weight  evenly throughout your whole body. If you want to lose weight in  specific areas, you should target them with exercises. If they are  your problem areas, they will be very difficult to tone. You will have  to work double on them. The best approach is this:  1. Lower/control your daily calorie intake (control for normal  weight, lower for overweight).  2. Run/jog to lower your overall body fat percentage.  3. Target your problem areas with exercises.  an  excellent  exercise,  you  can do it in front of your TV: sit on a  stool,  and  put  your toes under something (piece of heavy furniture,  for  example). In your hands hold a little dumbbell. Please, make sure  that  it  is  not very heavy, start with one kilo, for example, or you  will  damage  your  back and spine! Slowly move the upper part of your  body  back, until it's parallel with the ground. Stop for a second and  move it back to the sitting position. Repeat ten times. Every week add  to  the  number  of  repetitions.  You will see the results in a week,  guaranteed! You will see or feel under the fat - if you have any - six  pack  and  muscles.  Dumbbells  do  wonders.  Much  better  than these  crunches  -  I  came  up to three hundreds and there was no results AT  ALL. With the dumbbells you will see it in a week.|`|fmvcEqEyaa	Do crunches fast.|`|803c63e1bdfd226d14f4e5cafdc52f7eaa	You already have abs. Everyone does.     You can't see yours because they are covered with a layer of fat. The only way for a woman to see ab muscles is to get her body fat below 7%. And that's LOW.
V4BaRBtnaa	You do not need to lose weight.    Ask your parents to make an appointment to see your family doctor for a physical. Ask your doctor whether you need to lose weight, or perhaps even gain weight.    I have a female friend who is about your height, and weighs around 110 pounds. She looks great! She is a bit older than you, so I am guessing that at 15 years old your weight is fine. I repeat, you do not need to lose weight.    Take care of yourself.|`|taEM0EgDaa	heck i am like 1.5 inches under 5 ft. and i weigh 70 lbs!!! and i am way to skinny..... dont worry, if anything you need to eat more!! of coarse you should eat healthier, everyone should!!|`|eGPZpfr5aa	get help and talk to someone you are way too skinny|`|UjhWIrJ1aa	You need to eat a big cheeseburger w/ extra cheese. Get a little meat on your bones, your body is still growing.|`|ouLKDu2taa	Yes. Because when i was 11 I was around 100 - 106 pounds. (I was real tall)|`|WqI4rCrhaa	Weight is just a number- its not a very good indicator as far as general health is concerned- But mentally I think you might be a little unhealthy....     The rule of thumb for median body weight is to add 5lbs to 100 for every inch you are over 5ft. By that rule you an average girl 5'5" would weigh 125lbs- but that means some girls will weigh more and some will weigh less.  You may have an extremely small frame, and little muscle mass which would make you weigh less...     You're def. not overweight so I wouldn't be concerned with losing any. If you want to change the way you look I would suggest strength training so you can become more toned. This will most likely add weight but you'll look great
